been a real blessing to us and uh it was inspired by a statement that Charles Spurgeon made in a in a sermon called the happy Christian he was talking about trusting God and he said God is too wise to be mistaken God is too good to be unkind so when you don't understand and when you don't see his plan when you can't trace his hand trust his heart listen to the words of this song and I hope it'll be

unkind when you don't understand when you don't see his plan when you can't trace his hand trust his heart [Music] he sees the master plan and he holds our future in his hand so don't live as those who have no hope all our hope is found in [Music] him we see the Pres clearly but he sees the first and the last and like a tempestry he's weaving you and me to someday be just like like him God is too wise to be mistaken God is too C to be unkind when you don't understand when you don't see his plan when you can't train his hand trust his heart he alone is faithful and [Music] true he alone knows what is best for [Music] you God is too to be [Music] mistaken God is too good to be unkind when you don't understand when you don't see his plan when you can't trace his hand trust his heart when you don't understand when you don't see his plan when you can't trace his hand trust his heart [Music] are you in here there she is got another special [Music] I love you for what you are doing

back safe and sound did you have a good time in Arizona praise the Lord God bless you happy to have you here tonight the different ones also with us praise the Lord we're going to invite you right to St John chapter 15 we're going to carry on this evening with our little thought on abiding in Christ amen try to get a little more ways through it tonight I'll get as far as I can I won't get all the way amen the Lord seems to just keep adding to it at any rate a wonderful announcement this weekend we'll have brother Paul of Fontaine ministering for us so we're looking forward to that and uh brother Paul hasn't been here in quite a little while and uh it's hard to believe him being one of my favorite alltime preachers in the planet amen but he's a busy guy so we're happy to get him here amen this coming Sunday so you come expecting I promise you you'll have a wonderful time in the word of God Amen appreciate everybody getting those prayer requests to me I just happen to think of that today when I sent out the announcement that works a lot better for me rather than right here you know sometimes I'm looking and at the last second there's two or three popping in and I'm trying to conduct the service and respond to that and sometimes I miss them I get in my back office and there's one or two I didn't even get to and makes me feel bad so I sure appreciate you getting those into me we got about a half a dozen or so we want to get to this evening amen but first let's get our reading F first four verses of John 15 I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now you're clean through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me let's just pray father I thank you for this time to be in your house I've looked forward to it Lord all day just setting myself Lord in in your presence to figure out Lord what is that mind of Christ and what is it that you want to say tonight now Lord of course there's more to say than I can get to tonight uh Lord here in a midweek service we don't want to hold the people too late so I just pray that your quickening power Lord would be upon me that I would know exactly what you want to say for this service tonight Lord I commit it to you I'm uh and we just are so happy to do that Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you seated really um such a wonderful time um on Sunday and I I sure would like to just take uh a moment and thank all of those people I just had so many wonderful uh comments uh excuse me I'm just posting a prayer request that just hit uh those wonderful comments amen she's my sister-in-law so she can get by with sending it to me late amen amen the Lord get that amen praise the Lord and you can if you didn't get it to me you can still send it to me not going to reach out and kill anybody amen praise the Lord so uh we want to just make sure we try to get them all amen my I had so many wonderful comments from the service on Sunday and I will just say that wow that service meant a lot to me this whole thought I had one brother particularly um dear to me a minister senior pastor to me a great man who I look up to quite a bit and uh he was just telling me how much he enjoyed it and I said well you know I I'm I just was so that come from Deep deep inside my heart for God's people but for me as well amen I hope you caught that that Sunday I was really pouring my own Heart Out friends and I just think that that that's you know that's the beauty of the Brotherhood of Christ and the saints of God and the camaraderie that we have and hey there's no big eye and little you we really are all in this thing together amen and so I just appreciate your willingness to let me uh open up my heart like that and I want to continue on tonight there's still quite a bit I want to say and we'll just go so far tonight and we'll just uh stop right there at a certain point couple of things that as we were closing out on Sunday we were making some of the comments about how that there was such a need in this hour for True Vine Jesus said I'm the True Vine and my goodness did we ever find out how much we needed there to be a true vine there is such a an impersonation of Christianity in this hour and Satan has become such a master more more than any other age it's unparalleled in history un unprecedented we're facing unprecedented times that that God's family has never faced before and uh but but we but we do know that that that the Lord is mindful of the things that we are facing and long before we ever got here he he had a plan and really when it comes down to it tonight if I could really get you to absorb this thought that that is that is really the heart of this matter is that Jesus gave us the solution to survive the impossible and not just to survive but could I say to thrive and so I realize that we are striving I I understand that and there's a reward to those at the end time brother Brenham contrast our age to the age of the martyrs and how that they will have a reward in that they have given meaning that they gave their lives but they didn't face uh you know they they face things that we don't face as far as none of us are called to go to the Lion's Den but we Face such an impossible Darkness how that we are going to survive as I said to you on Sunday uh we're we're living at a time that was impenetrable even to a prophet couldn't even see and thought my nobody could survive that one they asked him the reporter there in South Africa and ask him why did you pick 1977 he said because it got so dark at that point I thought nobody can survive it you're living in the time of that where it's unsurvivable it's in the time of a of a Darkness impenetrable you're going to have to have the mind of Christ seeing for you you thinking for you moving for you or you're not going to survive it friends not talking about losing your salvation I think we made the case Sunday that's quite impossible and we're we're we're showing here the the side that Jesus is speaking to we know it has a compound meaning but our aim is to speak to those who have passed from Death under life but Jesus is saying to you if you want to bring forth fruit you're going to have to come God's word way and his word way is the mind of Christ uh there there's such such similarities there in in in the in what we see today where Satan would was was it was prophesied to us that he would be so deceptive that the similarities could be so close as to become uh you know you can't disentangle I I don't want to dare get into my part three um although I can feel myself trying to be drawn in that direction but let me just say friends that we're living in a in an age where there's such a a a a mingling such an amalgamation of light and darkness such a such a mixture of of what is perfectly good and what looks like really good and it's only one% not good and it's and it's death we're living in a time this is a a serious hour where when brother brandham saw the he he saw the Mamba there you remember he's coming he's walking on a map to palestin he's two-thirds of the way to crossing over and and and there was a great fear among all the people and he said I heard it crashing through you know the the the coming through the bush and he said it came out on the road and he said as soon as I saw it I knew it was a large Mamba one bite you're done if it and he said there was a brother with me and he said it went after him and I'm here to tell you something friends this is Brother Jason I just believe that that brother represented me and it represented you and brother brandham said he was jumping and spinning and jumping back and trying and sometimes that's how we feel in life I'm just constantly jumping around trying to avoid the devil trying to avoid the world and and brother brandom screamed out oh if it ever hits him he it'll kill him and and and and and and he he called on the name of the Lord and the Lord came down and what was the answer you got to be more sincere you won't survive that Mambo will take you out you might not lose your Eternal destination but everything you've tried to strive for can be lost and I don't want to lose I want to win it's not the hour to quit now it's not the hour to get lazy now this is the time to press the battle oh how we needed a True Vine I gave you how Sunday where brother brandham gave us the plan of God that he had a three-fold plan and the whole thing was to bring the kingdom back to its rightly position we're not going to go back through all of that again just remember that the plan at the end time that that phase two was for God to get complete control of his church and we know of course and I don't have time to teach on it tonight maybe when I've got more time but clearly we can see that God is in complete control of his church in the in the alpha age and again in the Omega age we know that in the ages in between it was what brother brandham called an ad mixture of God's word mixed with a mizing of the word of God and it and it produced a hybrid now thank God Christ was back in the eternity's interceding on behalf of his family see and so but we realize that he comes forward to claim the book and we're not here to linger on in a half truth or almost all the truth I want the full unadulterated word of God only and we have it and it's here and it's powerful and you can access it and you can use it and it's for you and you're going to find it's actually part of you which is why you have have access to it abide in me you know Jesus wasn't saying and I may be getting a we bit ahead of myself but I'm just going to have to go as I feel in my heart Jesus was not you know suggesting that when when he's talking about you know a abide in me because without me he goes on down without me you can do nothing amen now he wasn't saying that you won't accomplish things right he just simply he was just simply saying they'll equal nothing without me you might accomplish all kinds of things you might become the king of the world you might Ascend to a station in life you might set records you might become famous you might you might do all kinds of extraordinary which is which you know is extraordinary you might do all kinds of extraordinary things and accomplish extraordinary things for the world for yourself for your whatever for your family for your children for your own life for the for the uh the economy for the community but Jesus is simply saying listen it's all going to Ash and sinder the only things that will survive is eternal things and that has to come through me so it so so it comes back to the question of what are you chasing what are what is the priority priorities of your life what are your priorities dad for your for you and your home and your family and your children and your Offspring you'd be amazed how how much your life demonstrates what your priorities are you think nobody sees it they see it it doesn't matter that they see it or that I see it I preach I I I'm going to preach what I preach regardless and you know you might this whole church might allow God to purge so that they can bring forth more and then when you as I've said before you think well okay finally I I now I've brought forth more now that I get now I where I get to go to Disney World the Lord's going to let give me a big all expense paid and the answer is no actually I'm going to purge you again so you bring forth even more and you might accomplish that and we might accomplish that as a church that be the Delight of me as your pastor but I'm still going to preach that you need to keep pressing I'm still going to preach you can't rest you can't hold back you still got to go forward cuz we still ain't out of here so Jesus said abide in me I think Andrew Murray says it best when he made this statement this message abide in me is especially for those who have heard the gentle call coming unto me the Lord now extends a deeper invitation abide in me we're here we're Christians we're Believers because we heard come unto me and we did we came to the word we came to the son of man we have received eternal life but now do you hear the the the deeper call do you hear the the deeper Challenge from the Lord don't I'm glad you come to me but now I need you to abide in me as I said to you Sunday Calvary wasn't the end Calvary was the beginning for you that's where we begin now we're moving forward and under the grace and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit see so so so the new birth then of course we you know we we've taught it many times the new birth must be in place um can I just say it like this the new birth must be in place our navigation in this darkness is impossible not saying you won't make tracks and go forward but you're not going to navigate it according to the word of God and if you don't navigate according to the word of God you don't you don't get the reward of the word of God Amen so we know that brother Brandon in defining the new birth said it's a revelation of Jesus Christ who is the word this is from Christ is the mystery of God revealed it is the Revelation what is the new birth brother bandam it is the revelation of Jesus Christ who is the word personally to you see so it's the word of course we've taught on this before the word is is logos logos means the established word it's the unchanging inherent word but but then then what is Rema Rema is the Living Word when you have believed the established word then your life becomes not just the established word doctrinally but it becomes the Rema of the word alive and you're living according to the established word it's not a different word or a second word it's a furtherance it's what God is doing to you in the New Birth the new birth brings your life into Rema your life then becomes a living a living testimony to the logos which is the established word it's not hard to understand so it's personally to you the word is made personally the revelation of it there's an there's an amen in the voice of your life and you know why that you can have an amen to the voice of the word because the gene of God that is in you is the word it's just another form of the logos and when the Holy Spirit comes and annihilates your old nature and the life of that Gene comes to life that's Rema see that's what devils are afraid of there's an amen in the voice of your life because the gene is now perpetually perpetually REM it's a Living Word it's brought to life by an experience of the Holy Ghost and no other way can't end around that you can't join a church you can't just believe God sent a prophet you can't just come in on Mom and Dad's experience you've got to have your own personal fire breathing experience of the Holy Ghost eternal life then of course is within you and and you know don't let it just become a cliche it's not just a the new birth that's not just a cliche born again it's not just a saying you understand that the new birth changes a part of you there's a Third Realm you're a Triune being Body Spirit and soul that new birth transforms your nature and it's now the life of God it's the mind of Christ and how do I get it stronger by daily surrendering and surrendering and surrendering it's eternal life within you bringing the rest of your body to a body change amen I want to get the rest of me hallelujah hallelujah I'm glad for what's happened in my soul but I want to get the rest of me somay and not just in a Rapture I want the I want I want the me that's still here to be under the power of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I want the me that's still right here right now the one that has to face the world every day I want that Living Word of this hour living in that man Hallelujah so now we come to abiding you get me so now we come to abiding that's what abiding is about it's what it's for not just abiding as a cliche but there's a fervency I want to challenge you tonight to be fervent in your faith God is Not Looking for lukewarmness he'd rather you be cold than lukewarm he's looking for the Zeal of the Holy Ghost he's looking for fervency in our lives a total surrender the abiding of Christ The Living Union with him this is an experience of his daily presence his his hourly presence not only his presence but his keeping thank God I believe he has a keeping power that can live in our lives in this wicked adulterous gener generation and I want that I want to see consistent manifestation of his life in control of my life how about you bethle Tabernacle I want to see all of the Purity and all of the Power and all of the love and all of the joy and I I want to have all the fruit bearing and all the blessedness and all the sacredness that Jesus connected to abiding because he connected it say I want Power he connected it to abiding I want joy I want blessedness amen see so I I want fruit bearing how many want fruit bearing he connected it to abiding not just your new birth but abiding in Christ daily hourly um hey who's back there Josh let's I'm give you a workout give me Luke nine I want to go through a number of verses so you just keep your trigger finger ready brother Josh and I'll go slow and then sometimes I'll go fast and Luke 923 all right Le let's let's let's um let's um stir us up by way of remembrance all right I'm going to give you some abiding qualifiers Luke 9:23 he said to them all if any man will come after me let him read it with me deny himself take up his cross yearly did I read it wrong y'all didn't agree to a wrong reading did you let him take up his cross daily and follow me see so so self-denial is a Daily Commitment say I want to abide great it's a Daily Commitment to follow Christ is symbolized by taking up your cross see representing a full surrender and unwavering loyalty that's what Jesus was showing when he took up his cross he was showing unyielding unbending undying loyalty unwavering loyalty total complete full surrender to the will of the father and now he turns around to his church and he says as the father's in me and I in him now you be in me and I'll be in you how are you going to abide say brother Jason I love this whole idea of abiding oh my goodness tell me how to get it there you go Matthew chapter 6 brother the Josh Matthew chapter 6 verse 24 no man can serve two masters so I think it's pretty clear who the two masters are Christ or Antichrist God or the devil good or bad light or Darkness right no one can serve two masters either you will hate the one and love the other or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other you cannot serve both God and money amen now I'm going to tell you a story you can take it down just for a minute brother Josh I'll I'll get you in a second we'll go to another one when Israel came out of the Exodus and they wandered in the wilderness all those years and you know the whole story I'm not going to rehearse it to you learned it since Sunday school you know what happened at kades Barne and then they wandered and then they came back under Joshua and and we find out that when it got time to cross over Joshua had to make good on a promise Moses had made to two and a half tribes Gad and reuben reuben and Gad and later on finally even half the tribe of Manasseh said you know we'll just stay on the east side of the river y'all can just cross on over into the promised land we'll just stay right here and it's incredible because that that when you really realize what they're saying is that they didn't want to occupy all that the Lord had promised them and and to them coming out of Egypt was enough I came out of Egypt I'm born again I received the word of this hour I say Amen to every word but you know I I don't I just don't need to press on into all that stuff y'all carry on you know we'll we'll pray for you I we'll even come over and help you fight and help you settle it but I don't want to I don't want to deal with having to get all the promises in the word applied to my life it's interesting because when they said to Moses and I'm not going to go back into the Old Testament to read it tonight I'm just telling you the story you can go read it yourself their heart was made clear when they said to Moses Moses said why do you want to stay over here and they said well we you know what here here's the reason Moses we want to it's better over here for our livestock We Can Make a Better Living uh it'll be a little easier on us because we're herdsmen and we can build houses and barns for our animals and our children so even their their livelihood in their mind was a higher priority than their children because they actually put it their animals I'm I'm worried about my animals you know you got kids yeah them [Laughter] too now Moses turned it around on him because the word always corrects the error when Moses said back okay here's what I'll do but you're going to have to go help help your brothers you're going have to cross over and help them fight and then you can come back and build your houses and when you build them let the word correct the error they're going to be built for your children then your animals don't be putting your livestock don't be putting your livelihood don't be putting your money don't be putting your business don't be putting your career like the world does ahead of raising your children in the admonition of God if you're going to stay over here and you're not going to take the promised land that God has promised to help you with all right you've came out of Egypt fine you're Reuben you're Gad you're half the tribe of Manasseh you're you're you're you're in God's word and you don't you don't want to press over all right I'll make that deal but if you're gonna stay over here understand nothing comes ahead of demonstrating the token to your family and I have seen too many families and too many children who grew into teenagers and they weren't that sweet little child anymore and as soon as they grew into teenagers into the world they went because no one ever brought them daily into contact with the Holy Ghost now you can do every bit of that or they can still go that way I understand that look Adam and Eve had the best parent in the world God they lived in a perfect a perfect home the garden and they still fell it can happen I'm not here to brow beat anybody that can happen but I can tell you as a parent and as a grandparent there's no Agony worse than seeing your family struggle because you know you did not establish the token in prayer and an altar and and bring your children daily like you should have there's no pain like that amen amen and conversely there's no joy even when you know you didn't do that to see God come down in his Mercy anyway and rescue them oh we got some in here tonight we didn't always get it right did we but God is rich in Mercy Hallelujah see so they were even joined by the half tribe of of manasse and and the same thing Manasseh that was what they said it's more suitable for our livestock so they let me just try to make it applicable so they they they agreed they chose to help the rest of the church take up their fight for the promised land um so they were a benefit to the kingdom right sure but Reuben Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh placed their own Pursuits of wealth and ease above occupying God's promised word amen I can't say it pler I'll let the Holy Spirit make it to make it real to you to whoever's listening tonight they were in and the and the sad part is that they were entitled to go there they had waited for 00 years they had been in slavery and after all that sweating it out for 430 years and they finally and God would have helped them he would have helped them he said you'll go over there you won't even lose a man and they didn't want that fight so they just stayed back on the east side you know what happened when the Assyrians came in and took the northern 10 tribes of of Israel from Samaria do you know that they had come a decade sooner and took Gad Manasseh half tribe of Manasseh and reuben reuben Gad and Hal tribe of Manasseh went into slavery 10 years ahead of Israel and Samaria and then as as far as it relates to Jerusalem and Judah and the City of David that that they were taken 146 years years before the third wave of the Babylonians came through and sacked Jerusalem for the third time and burnt the temple and took all the people the first time they came they took Daniel then they then they came again because of a rebellion and then they came a third I think the second time they took hezekia and he got taken and then the next time the third time they said okay we're done with you rebellious Jews we're just going to sack the city raise it all to the ground and burn the temple and you're done you're going into captivity and Israel ceased at at being in nation and and and we find that it took it took 70 years before they could ever get back and I can't keep going in that because that breaks into other things and I've I've got it for later but do you see parents here and listening online do you see the impossibility of div Ed loyalties do you see why Jesus said you cannot serve God in Mamon you can't you'll you'll you'll give all your attention to the one and despise the other one call that that that Jesus was calling in our in our verse that we read he says no man can serve to Masters put it back up for me uh U brother Josh Matthew 6:24 no man no one can serve two masters either he'll he will hate the one and love the other or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God in money it calls for exclusive here's what Jesus is meaning and abiding in me abiding we're not talking about just being born again we're talking about Abiding and abiding calls for an exclusive Devotion to to him above all worldly attachments full stop amen Galatians 2:20 brother Josh there's another abiding scripture Paul says Galatians 2:20 I have been crucified with Christ and I no I'll wait for you brother Josh Galatians 2:20 all right I have been Cru I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God not faith in the Son of God which led him to a new birth but now he's Abiding and he has the faith of the Son of God who loved me and and gave himself for me then how can I not give myself for him see so it requires complete allegiance to Christ as dying to self to where you are living this is abiding abiding is living entirely through faith and and Christ's indwelling presence pleased to dwell in you pleased to lead you pleased to be around you not grieved Romans 12 I know you're probably about to collapse under all these but let me keep going can you take it can you take the apostles words do you know Paul loved you Romans 121 therefore I urge you Brothers I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service I urge you this is Paul's heart pouring out I urge you Jesus wants you to abide there's there's there's many things in the promised land that you are entitled to and you don't have to live like a popper and you don't have to get beat down by the devil and you don't have to get drugg around by your the your flesh and your senses you can have Victory friends it's to you it's for you Christ died so you could have it this verse calls Believers to dedicate their entire lives to Christ as a Living Sacrifice you know why because when you dedicate your life to Christ as a Living Sacrifice then your life reflects a continual worship amen you you didn't when you come into church and start singing songs and worship you're just extending what you've been doing all week just your everyday walking talking life is a Perpetual continual flame before God it's a constant sacrifice it's why the Bible says give him the sacrifice of your praise your life I I can't say it any plainer than this your life is a living worship that's abiding let me give you another one Colossians 3 brother Josh Colossians 3 uh let's go to 17 you good breathe just breathe you'll be all right whatever you do Colossians 3:17 we'll get there in a second Colossians 3:17 and whatever you do whatsoever you do you do in word or deed whatever you do whether it's in word or whether it's in deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ giving thanks to God and the father by him no matter what it is in word or deed do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father through Christ see so oh Paul is emphasizing that every action and every word should be done for the glory of Christ amen every action every word I'm here to tell you something friends you have less than no chance to pull this off outside of a holy ghost New Birth and you then you've got at least a chance but it's going to require a willingness to abide in Christ this isn't come unto me first of all Jesus said come unto me that's to the whole world all ye that are weary and heavy laden I'll give you rest he said if I be lifted up I will draw all men see so so the whole world Jesus died for the sins of the whole world so so come unto me is to everybody but abide in me that's for an elect lady those who know him in the power and his resurrection who are willing to give up their lives and give up Pursuits and let Christ take over their life and mind in all things word or deed the very action and word should be done for Christ make up your mind tonight let me say it that way make up your mind tonight make up your mind in this service that there's no and there's no way to get around it I'm here to tell you that God is calling for men and women to step up and be and be ambassadors of the word of God there's no way to get around the call of the Lord upon his family for total Allegiance in all aspects of Our Lives this you have to understand all right take that down for now brother Josh and I'll I'll have you get another one here in just in a minute or no I probably won't I'll just because they're familiar and I'll just slow me down just a little bit you still good you understand that and I have have to be careful how I explain this but I can demonstrate what I'm going to say but and let me just say it like this the revelation of Jesus Christ in the word um who who was always the word he didn't become it he always was that see so that that Revelation came on Old Testament Saints too I mean how do you think Abel knew what to offer how do you think Enoch knew how to build how do you think Noah knew how to build see how do you think how do you think David how do you think Solomon figured out how to do it David knew how to get all the the the right supplies Moses knew that what he should do because the the word could be revealed for what what couldn't in fact is it was it was so powerful that even at times they had to put a a veil over the face of Moses and the Bible called him a God to the people Bible at another place called him a king he was a king in just sure and and so we realize that God could come on Daniel and could come on Ezekiel he could come on Solomon he could come on David he could come on Enoch and Noah and Abraham what he could not do that he can now do is abide inside of them and remain there he can abide with you he can abide in you are you willing to abide in him you have a privilege they didn't have see so so it it remains now and it lives on the inside of you and I and and and of course and and of course you know not only that but I mean it it can come on people inspiration of the word God can reveal the word to people who aren't even born again yet that's how he gets you to a born again State he reveals the word and you start following it amen he went into Matthew 16 here's where we won't I won't put it on the screen but he went to Peter who do men say that I am Peter's not born again Peter don't have the Holy Ghost yet the Holy Ghost hadn't yet been given but he said who who do they say well you're this that or the other who do you say you're the Christ the son of the Living God Jesus testified no one told you that my heavenly father told you that you see so so so so we find out that that that that it came to the woman at the well in John 4 the the the scripture that probably I would say you know off top of my head probably other than maybe Hebrews 138 um maybe John 1 and one John 4 the woman at the well brother Brandon went to that over and over and over again he peep catch people in the prayer line and say now here we have a scene exactly like John for here's a man here's a woman they don't know each other and he said but Jesus started talking to her contacting her spirit amen and here's she is she's not the Holy Ghost isn't yet given but yet I love it because brother Brandon talks about her harlotry and how that and this is not a direct quote I don't have it in front of me but the point he's making and and he says to this to this exact effect yes her body had long been polluted but her soul was still virgin Hallelujah nothing had ever reached down to that Gene of God it had been laying there her whole life and Jesus revealed himself to her now it's interesting because two things happened in Rapid succession the Bible says in in St John 4:26 Jesus said unto her I that speak unto thee am he verse 27 says and upon this he said I that speak to thee am he and upon this and when when once you read upon this two things happened right together I'm here to tell you something friends she the first thing that happened is she threw down her water pots she didn't need the world anymore she didn't care about none of that stuff she was and and you know something else the disciples came up and the Bible says none of them dared ask none of them dared speak and I'm here to tell you when Christ comes to you and you don't hear nothing else there's no other voices talking if just you and him I remember that day do you remember that day she threw down her water pot she didn't need that kind of stuff anymore and she was she was such a Believer even before the Holy Ghost could live in her daily that she ran into the city doesn't even say a village she ran into the City and she said come see a man who's told me everything that I've done is not this the Messiah and her testimony was so powerful her life was so changed it converted it started a Revival Ral all over the city I'm here to tell you you can start a Revival in your home you can start a Revival in this church you can start a Revival where you work where you go to school all you need to do is come to Christ that's how I was I only wanted to hear his mind and his mind only Jesus only I didn't I didn't care anymore about the siren song of the world I didn't want to follow that my flesh still battles me that's why I abide in him that's why I found my strength it's the life of the word upon the gene of God in your soul that's what brings anyone to a birth that life is the supernatural El El it it literally it it it it it brings you something that Fallen man can't acquire for himself it's impossible he can't save himself even if he knows he needs to even if he don't want to die and go to hell he still can't stop it see only the word of God coming don't lose your day of visitation friends God has sent a word in this hour it's not to be toyed with are played with it's to be believed it's to be eaten it's to be absorbed God has a plan for you to become the Living Word this was never intended to stay in a book brother Brenham said when the book is closed for the last time the word will be flesh hallelujah oh my it's not natural because our our sin birth is contrary to it you'd never be able to get there it's not natural it's it's it's contrary to our nature and and it'll be contrary to your nature for your entire life except that he comes and fills that vessel fills it with lightting drives out the darkness that we're born under and he brings forth the nature that's inside that Gene that was there all along but now see that's nothing less than the new birth and now he says to you who have passed from Death To Life abide in me you can't do anything without me I'm the vine you're the branches in me you have all the promises without no don't abide in me you have no access you have no guarantees the enemy can just come in and even though you have believed the word and have had an experience with God and many and we could I think we could all hear tonight and say I could say have you had an experience with the Lord if you ask me that I'm sure I'd give you the same answer you'd give me I brother Jason I've had many experiences with the Lord and I hope to have many more experiences with the Lord but there but I read you enough passages in the Bible to show you what Paul is interpreting what Jesus meant this is self- crucifixion this is dying daily this is denial this is in prayer this is in in dedication to the Lord this is your whole life this isn't staying on the east side of Jordan This is moving into the promised land and being willing to fight for God's God's given rights to you this is that portion this is that portion that involves you the new birth just the grace of God it's Grace plus nothing it's God God even God even gave you the faith to believe it you he not only gave you the word and gave you the gene he even gave you the faith to believe it see biting is the portion that involves your participation your willingness as I'm saying at the beginning your willing willingness as I'm saying at the beginning your willingness to survive or Thrive amen it's up to you to minut us to survive or Thrive many of us I'm I'm afraid are are only surviving on God's bottomless well of grace and mercy but Jesus wants you to have life and he wants you to have it more abundantly he wants you to have life and he wants you to have health and he wants you to have blessing and he wants you in the promised land and he will he wants you to have it abundantly a good friend of mine minister of the gospel and I'm I'm not going to name drop him tonight a fine man sees Visions I've known him for years I knew him when he was a single man I've definitely seen the power of God working in his life and his ministry you know and and and and I'm not here to expl it any further than that he God came to him he gave a testimony that I heard very recently and he actually came to his own pull pit and preached on John 15 on the exact same weekend I was preaching on it and and he tells a testimony I listen to the Saturday night very very powerful very moving I haven't got to hear the Sunday morning yet but the way it came to him and since I know him and the gift that operates in him and I've seen it over the years I have a lot of confidence in it he said that he saw himself on the on a boat out on stormy seas and on this boat he said he saw uh another best I can remember I think it was another boat that had capsized something like that anyway there was people in the water and there was all they were they had fallen overboard and the wave had capsized whatever it was and all of those people were in the water and he was oh we've got to do something what what can we do and and he said they were bobbing and going under and coming up and some of them were trying to dog paddle and swim as hard as they could and others were trying to roll over on their back and they were trying to float and they were trying to get you know and and the waves and he he thought I I got to go do something and he said a voice came SC cried out to him what will you do and he he ran and he said I'll look for life jackets and he couldn't find any life jackets and he thought I'll I'll find one of those life rings and I'll throw him a life ring he couldn't find that he said and he said I kept running I was running all over the boat and these people are drowning and he said I finally I found a rope and he said I came with that rope and I thought I'll throw this rope out there and I'll pull them all in and he said when I went to throw it he said suddenly it just just shriveled in his hands until it became this little skinny Vine just a little skinny Vine and he thought this won't even this will never I won't even pull one person with this this will break immediately and he said I I thought and he said the voice said what are you going to do and he said I yeah I answered back I'll just work with what I've got and he said I hurled that vine out there and he said the people started trying to swim for it and grab it and he said I thought it would break and he said that voice came roaring down through there and he said it's John 15 and they'll be all right it's John 15 and they'll all be all right I'm here to tell you something friends it's John 15 tonight and you're going to be okay there's a Lifeline that's to you tonight
