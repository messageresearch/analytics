[0:06] [Applause]
[0:09] there's a pair of glasses sure that
[0:11] someone is lost has been found in the
[0:13] church if anybody if they belong to you
[0:16] or you're on the platform
[0:18] on this pulpit
[0:20] now i know that many are working and
[0:24] they have to go home early and so i
[0:26] won't speak very long and then have a
[0:28] prayer line to pray for the sick that
[0:30] gives me an opportunity to to catch up
[0:33] and some of the emergencies have just
[0:35] been in the room protection just now for
[0:37] coming in and this afternoon some of
[0:39] them of course
[0:40] very very bad and violent
[0:42] i've been making the calls and praying
[0:44] for the sick seeing the hand of our lord
[0:46] jesus heal the sick and the afflicted
[0:49] that's how wonderful he is
[0:51] now not too often that we get into these
[0:53] healing services because usually we the
[0:56] holy spirit will come around he's in the
[0:58] emergency case and desert it right quick
[1:00] and pick it out and say something about
[1:01] it then the rest of them we just maybe
[1:04] it's nothing
[1:05] too bad so we just pass it on by i
[1:07] thought being here twice today it should
[1:10] be that we dedicate one service for a
[1:12] prayer for the sake
[1:15] i believe in healing the sick i believe
[1:18] it is the bible command we cannot preach
[1:20] that without the full gospel without
[1:23] including that
[1:24] now it's possible
[1:26] i don't know yet i haven't called home
[1:28] yet tonight it may be possible that next
[1:31] sunday i'd be through here again and if
[1:33] you if you don't hear from us this week
[1:35] if billy don't let you know he'll know a
[1:37] little later on in the week if you don't
[1:39] hear then we'll be here again next
[1:41] sunday because that gives you a labor
[1:43] day you see to rest up and uh so to get
[1:46] home
[1:47] and
[1:48] so we'll try the lord willing now
[1:50] if you don't hear i think billy drops
[1:52] your card or tells you to do this
[1:54] service to some way so if he doesn't
[1:56] call you then i'm coming back for for us
[1:58] just next to come and send me if brother
[2:00] never just saw it one of them
[2:02] blessed
[2:03] some lady something oh that's fine
[2:06] if anybody wants to know
[2:08] this little collins here
[2:10] and during the time of the seven seals
[2:12] the doctor
[2:15] had told that little boy was rheumatic
[2:17] fever
[2:18] that he had to lay on his back and drink
[2:20] to a tube
[2:21] that's that was it
[2:23] and the father and mother brought in the
[2:25] home and set him in the room
[2:27] prayed for him and the lord jesus
[2:29] healing so completely he went back to
[2:31] school and the authorities called them
[2:33] in about
[2:34] so they called a specialist who was
[2:36] waiting on him and she couldn't believe
[2:38] he couldn't believe such a thing as that
[2:39] and they brought the boy down for a test
[2:42] and he was perfectly normally played
[2:47] then jesus came
[2:56] you know strange thing i was going to
[2:58] ask someone to sing that song tonight as
[3:00] i was ministering in the room there here
[3:02] comes someone saying it out there then
[3:05] jesus came
[3:06] if that wasn't saying i was going to ask
[3:08] someone to sing it before i i spoke
[3:11] tonight so
[3:12] he works all things right
[3:15] now many of you will be waiting over to
[3:17] in the mornings it's got a long distance
[3:19] to go
[3:20] and i i appreciate that
[3:22] effort some of you will drive home
[3:24] tonight cause you got to go to work but
[3:25] daylight in the morning
[3:27] and i
[3:28] i know it's hard and then when i think
[3:30] and see that i get spells too you know i
[3:34] get moody
[3:35] i get to the spot to where i what gets
[3:38] me
[3:38] is where i get to those spells when i
[3:41] get all overworked
[3:43] and satan comes tell me
[3:45] why nobody cares for you you really
[3:48] haven't got a friend in the world see
[3:50] and so
[3:51] remember i'm not amused from temptation
[3:54] i got to overcome that then when i look
[3:56] back and see something like this i put
[3:57] it right back in his face and say what
[3:59] about that
[4:01] that helps me to
[4:02] overcome what about that
[4:05] like a certain friend of mine sitting in
[4:08] the meeting here there was a
[4:10] a clan
[4:12] kind of uh a clan that doesn't believe
[4:15] in divine healing come to this young
[4:17] fellow
[4:18] uh
[4:19] recently and said to him that stuff is
[4:22] there preaching here about that divine
[4:23] healing there's nothing to it
[4:25] and this man lives in kentucky right
[4:28] near an old woman that when was it
[4:31] acting campground that was dying with
[4:34] cancer
[4:35] and her sister came to the meeting that
[4:37] night with a handkerchief in her purse
[4:39] that she'd taken
[4:41] and uh the holy spirit called out the
[4:44] woman back there and i've never been in
[4:45] that country before
[4:47] and told her that she had a handshake in
[4:49] her purse that she had there she took
[4:51] them home and her sister was up on a
[4:53] certain ridge there dying with cancer of
[4:56] the stomach the doctors give her up
[4:58] and i say go put the handkerchief upon
[5:01] the woman for thus saith the lord she
[5:03] shall live
[5:05] and that's the night the neighbors that
[5:06] they thought they had the salvation army
[5:09] when brother ben got up there
[5:14] and then that lady was so perfectly
[5:17] healed until she does her own work and
[5:19] the neighbors were
[5:20] so this young man knowing that he said
[5:22] then explain her case
[5:27] explained you know she had cancer she's
[5:29] hearing low when the doctors to perform
[5:31] the operation and just simply turn sort
[5:34] of put her back and nothing can be done
[5:36] and now she's perfectly normal well said
[5:38] explain that
[5:39] that's settled
[5:41] you know what the bible says and they
[5:43] could say nothing a myth because the man
[5:46] was standing right in their midst
[5:49] that's where we it puts satan to the
[5:51] shame does it the man was standing there
[5:53] as the miracle was performed on
[5:55] amen does god raise the dead here's the
[5:58] man in my ear raised by them
[6:00] amen
[6:00] god heal the sick oh my the hands could
[6:02] just go everywhere god heals the state
[6:05] and we know he's the great
[6:07] the great i am
[6:09] not the great i was or will be
[6:12] i am
[6:14] i am at every present everywhere all
[6:16] time
[6:17] the same yesterday today and forever now
[6:21] i hurry let's turn now into the blessed
[6:24] bible i want to read a passage that
[6:28] that used to just turn me around when i
[6:31] read it
[6:32] and i want to have a prayer line and i
[6:35] pray for everybody that wants to be
[6:37] prayed for
[6:38] and now we're going to turn to mark
[6:40] saint mark's 11th chapter
[6:43] of saint martin
[6:45] and we're going to begin to read about
[6:48] the
[6:49] the 22nd
[6:51] verse of the 11th chapter of saint mark
[6:55] and many of you know this scripture it's
[6:57] very familiar
[6:59] it was a scripture i was thinking on uh
[7:02] brother russell when those when he spoke
[7:05] to me and said about those squirrels
[7:07] and they that was just the very
[7:09] scripture i was thinking of it's always
[7:11] been a puzzle he said if ye say
[7:15] not if i say if you say
[7:18] now let us read
[7:20] jesus answering
[7:22] said unto them have faith in god
[7:26] for verily i say unto you that whosoever
[7:29] shall say unto this mountain
[7:31] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[7:34] the sea
[7:35] and shall not doubt in his heart
[7:39] but shall believe that those saints
[7:41] which he saith shall come to pass
[7:45] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[7:48] and
[7:49] therefore i say unto you
[7:51] what things so every you desire
[7:54] when you pray believe that ye receive
[7:58] them and you shall have them
[8:02] and
[8:03] when you stand please forgive
[8:06] if you have ought against any
[8:08] that your father also
[8:11] that your father also which is in heaven
[8:13] may forgive you your trespass
[8:16] but if you do not forgive
[8:18] neither will your
[8:20] father which is in heaven forgive your
[8:23] trespasses
[8:25] now
[8:27] faith is based on
[8:29] forgiveness now
[8:32] and then as we said this morning trying
[8:35] to get the church into the place to
[8:37] where we could
[8:38] really see apostolic
[8:41] times moving among us that's what we all
[8:43] hunger
[8:45] and it's just laying right at the door
[8:46] yeah we see it
[8:48] but we want to see more of it
[8:51] we wanted such a flow that it'll it'll
[8:53] be a help to us
[8:55] flow out to others remember
[8:58] jesus as we had in the lesson this
[9:00] morning he never used his power for
[9:02] himself
[9:04] he used it for others
[9:06] that's what it was set for
[9:08] and you think sometimes why would a man
[9:12] that was so full of power like him would
[9:15] have ever be sick yes sir
[9:18] i've read and some books somewhere where
[9:22] when he raised up that boy for the
[9:24] widow's son from nahum
[9:26] of lisa prince the house of david that
[9:28] he stepped on a rock and grown with a
[9:30] headache
[9:32] he bore our infirmities bear means to
[9:35] pack them
[9:37] he bore and he had all things and like
[9:40] we have he had sickness he had
[9:43] temptations he had trouble he had
[9:45] flusteration just as we have because he
[9:48] had to be the right kind of a mediator
[9:51] so he had to be partakers the husband
[9:53] and of the fruit before you even know
[9:56] the woman has to well and many things
[9:58] see if we look right into the scripture
[10:01] i want to say that i believe every
[10:03] scripture
[10:04] never been up to this room
[10:06] there's critics today that don't want to
[10:08] believe that
[10:10] a critic once said that when jesus
[10:13] said there was disciples to where that
[10:15] colt was tied
[10:17] were two ways met that he pre-arranged
[10:19] that
[10:20] for where that quote was time
[10:22] see they don't understand that god
[10:25] rearranges
[10:27] god
[10:28] told me other day was brother down here
[10:31] and i would shake his hand on the street
[10:33] again
[10:34] that's very strange i wasn't here that
[10:36] morning
[10:37] but two minutes longer or a minute
[10:40] longer i'd not met him on the street but
[10:42] i stepped off the car just in time to
[10:44] shake his hands when he was coming in on
[10:45] the street
[10:47] he didn't know
[10:48] he had his glasses off he couldn't see
[10:50] me when he heard my voice he started
[10:52] crying
[10:53] what was it usually he doesn't do that
[10:55] but it was the answer to what was told
[10:57] him up there under the oxygen tank he
[10:59] would do it
[11:00] i said you were also set in the church
[11:03] again
[11:04] his heart's desire was having chicago
[11:06] meeting he wanted to come to that
[11:09] meeting his heart was part
[11:11] i sent him a telegram and greetings for
[11:12] us and the children told him was praying
[11:14] that he could get well right quick
[11:17] and a loving brother who visits him said
[11:20] that you he just wanted to come so bad
[11:22] but here he says tonight
[11:25] see that was not pre-arranged
[11:28] the same god arranged it he makes
[11:31] everything work perfectly on the doll
[11:33] amen a critic once said
[11:36] that no wonder jesus could take five
[11:38] loaves and feed five thousand said the
[11:41] loaves were bigger in that day and he
[11:43] just cut each soap to feed a thousand
[11:46] i'll give you to understand a little boy
[11:48] had it in his lunch
[11:49] [Applause]
[11:53] a little child
[11:55] of five bowls of bread that could feed
[11:57] five ounces
[11:59] then what about the twelve basketballs
[12:01] taking that fast
[12:03] oh they just
[12:05] that's just critics that's all
[12:07] that doesn't change god's word
[12:09] it's just the same thing moves on now
[12:13] we want to speak now upon faith and a
[12:16] different type of faith perfect faith
[12:20] that's a great thing
[12:22] now a faith we're told in the bible
[12:26] faith cometh by hearing
[12:29] now you cannot be saved without faith
[12:33] and faith is something that you have to
[12:35] believe is there
[12:37] that really nothing else will declare
[12:39] but faith
[12:41] now
[12:42] i'm trying to
[12:44] bring faith to you so that you can be
[12:46] ready for this prayer line in the next
[12:48] few minutes
[12:50] now
[12:51] faith he that cometh to god must believe
[12:55] that he is
[12:57] and it's impossible to to please god
[13:00] without faith
[13:02] you cannot please
[13:04] and if you say you believe god you have
[13:06] never seen him
[13:07] see
[13:08] so then you've got to believe it by
[13:10] faith and if you could see him it would
[13:12] be no more faith
[13:14] the anything that the census declares is
[13:16] no more faith it's a scientific fact see
[13:20] it's not no more faith but you have to
[13:22] accept him by faith
[13:24] and he that cometh to god
[13:27] must believe god and faith comes by
[13:30] hearing the word of god amen see you
[13:34] must first believe this is god's word
[13:39] and you must come to
[13:42] god by the word amen see
[13:46] just take the word what it says and
[13:48] that's right
[13:49] everything else contrary to it is not
[13:51] right
[13:53] abraham had to believe just what that
[13:55] boss told him
[13:57] and when he was 100 years old 25 years
[14:00] later he was stronger believe that he
[14:02] was 25 years ago when it was given to
[14:04] him
[14:06] he believed it
[14:08] and he staggered not at the promise
[14:10] of god through unbelief but was strong
[14:13] giving praise to god knowing
[14:16] that he was able to perform what he
[14:19] promised
[14:20] that's where everyone must be that way
[14:22] you must come with an unfailing faith
[14:26] believing that god made the promise but
[14:29] now you have to be in a position to have
[14:31] that faith that's what we're going to
[14:32] talk about
[14:33] to receive that faith
[14:36] in hebrews the book of hebrews 11th
[14:38] chapter we are told that faith is
[14:42] the substance of things so far
[14:45] now here's where many people
[14:47] fail to receive
[14:50] their healing or what they're asking for
[14:52] because they take faith to be something
[14:56] that it is not see they don't believe it
[15:01] it's not a
[15:04] imagination
[15:05] it is a actual
[15:10] substance now listen closely
[15:14] it is not what you imagine
[15:17] it's just as real to you as any sense of
[15:20] your body will declare anything else
[15:22] it's just as real as my eyes says this
[15:26] is a piece of paper
[15:28] it's just as real as to say that but
[15:30] that is a lie
[15:33] it's just as real as the that i feel my
[15:35] coat
[15:37] it's just as real as the as i hear that
[15:40] baby talking uh there or making this
[15:43] noise see it's just that real it's music
[15:46] playing
[15:47] it's just as real as i taste anything in
[15:49] my mouth
[15:51] it is that real only you can't show it
[15:54] to somebody else
[15:56] you have alone
[15:58] amen
[15:59] it's yours
[16:01] faith is the substance amen see it's not
[16:06] just a myth so many people call now
[16:08] these are real
[16:10] deep lessons
[16:12] and i'll catch the top of it and then
[16:14] you dig down in it
[16:16] notice
[16:17] it is something that you possess
[16:21] ah not imagination
[16:24] you really have it
[16:26] it's just as real to you as any other
[16:30] thing that could be it's just as real as
[16:32] as you know that you're right in your
[16:34] automobile it's just as real as you know
[16:37] that you're sitting in the church
[16:39] it's just as real as you hear my boy
[16:42] it is a substance
[16:44] not an imagination not an emotion
[16:47] but something that you have
[16:50] and it comes to you by hearing the word
[16:53] of god in that only
[16:55] amen faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[16:58] the word of god
[17:00] that puts it back
[17:02] don't worry
[17:03] your faith in is not in some individual
[17:07] it's not in a man it's not in our
[17:09] organization it's not in a group of
[17:11] people it's in god because god is the
[17:14] word amen
[17:16] your faith is in god
[17:19] faith cometh by hearing the word of god
[17:23] then when god by his word not what
[17:26] somebody else did somebody else did
[17:29] but by what god's word said
[17:32] he said let every man's words be a lie
[17:35] and mine be truth
[17:37] now you see somebody else do something
[17:41] by a word act of god or promise of god
[17:45] and many of them say i can do that too
[17:47] it's an imagination
[17:50] and when they do you find them rigged up
[17:52] out there somewhere yes
[17:54] it's got to be a substance
[17:57] now that is potentially a faith
[18:01] that is something that would bring you
[18:03] to a faith
[18:04] it's potentially like if you ask me for
[18:07] an oak tree and i'll give you an acorn
[18:10] potentially you have an oak tree but it
[18:12] hasn't produced itself yet but when it
[18:14] really brings itself out it is an oak
[18:17] tree
[18:18] and when you imagine that god does this
[18:21] but when it's revealed to you it's a
[18:23] faith stand a perfect faith that cannot
[18:26] fail
[18:28] that's the reason those visions are so
[18:31] so tremendous to me
[18:33] because it's been proved right every
[18:35] time
[18:36] see
[18:37] and i know that he promised that and he
[18:40] promised in his word and here he comes
[18:41] and promises for this day therefore you
[18:44] know where you're standing when he says
[18:46] so
[18:47] that gives me a faith because he never
[18:50] does nothing contrary to his written
[18:52] word
[18:53] see if it was contrary to the word i
[18:55] couldn't have faith in it
[18:57] brings it right back again to the word
[18:59] see faith in hearing the word of god you
[19:02] must share the word god's word is that
[19:05] all sufficient word that's all you have
[19:08] need of is this word now faith being
[19:11] deception and in there we find out in
[19:14] hebrews what faith was and what those
[19:17] did you have faith
[19:20] see there's many times that people have
[19:22] faith today and tomorrow they haven't
[19:24] got it the next day there's something
[19:26] and something else but when god wants
[19:28] anchors
[19:29] and you see it there's nothing ever
[19:31] going to make you move from it
[19:34] you're just poking
[19:35] reaching pursuing and pursue this
[19:38] adventure without authority you're just
[19:40] trying this and trying this and go to
[19:42] this and run here and run there you
[19:44] haven't got the faith yet
[19:46] but when
[19:47] that is what we call things
[19:50] excuse me i want you to thank you
[19:53] i i want you to get this now we the
[19:57] church has got to lift itself in the
[19:59] power of god
[20:00] how we're too close to the end now
[20:04] and to the end now and i believe the
[20:07] church is in condition where we can
[20:09] teach it a little deeper things and rub
[20:11] some of this make-believe out
[20:14] and get into something real see it's got
[20:18] to be something that you know
[20:21] if you say uh uh brother branham uh that
[20:26] isn't a lie
[20:27] yet i'll annoy the light
[20:30] how do you know it's like i'm looking at
[20:33] it
[20:34] well how do you know what you could be
[20:35] wrong my side has always declared to me
[20:38] that that was life
[20:40] and that's the reason i believe those
[20:42] visions because it's always declared to
[20:44] me the truth because it comes from the
[20:46] word amen
[20:48] then if he says it that settles it
[20:50] now when it's declared like that there's
[20:52] no more guesswork
[20:54] it's going to be
[20:55] then you hear it thus faith the law see
[20:59] because
[21:00] it's beyond human thinking it's up into
[21:02] the realms of the large things
[21:04] but you're standing here just as the
[21:06] vine
[21:07] just as the branch producing the fruit
[21:10] that's in the vine
[21:11] see god uses man and man only
[21:14] god doesn't use machinery god doesn't
[21:16] use groups of man god doesn't use
[21:18] organization god uses individuals
[21:21] always
[21:23] now faith is the substance and by we
[21:27] understand all those things are done
[21:29] it's not a it's not a imagination it is
[21:32] a substance especially
[21:35] perfect faith that's what i'm talking on
[21:37] tonight getting to perfect faith
[21:40] it is not an imagination
[21:43] now other just people can say well i got
[21:44] all faith oh i sure have or are you
[21:47] standing here for us
[21:50] see your your very actions prove that
[21:52] you haven't got what you're talking
[21:54] about
[21:55] see
[21:56] if you have faith then where you
[21:57] standing for airlines
[21:59] what do you do these things for see if
[22:01] you had perfect faith you'd look right
[22:04] straight to god and believe it and walk
[22:06] away and you would you would have no
[22:08] need of coming into a prayer
[22:10] you'd have no need of these things
[22:12] because your faith has done made it so
[22:15] ever see
[22:17] what would be the use for me saying i
[22:19] got to put a shirt on
[22:21] i got a shirt on
[22:23] how do you know you got a shirt
[22:25] well i see it feel it and i know it's
[22:28] there
[22:29] well that's just how real that when
[22:31] perfect faith takes the hope
[22:34] you don't need no more great
[22:36] already done you know hallelujah how do
[22:38] you know it faith tells me so amen
[22:41] that's it see do you get it now one of
[22:44] these that's perfect faith not otherwise
[22:47] i'm venturing out well i'll go the bible
[22:50] stick all the elders let them know they
[22:51] want to pray over i know how i'm going
[22:53] and you say well i'm going to be healed
[22:55] you're making yourself if don't watch
[22:57] how you're going to make yourself just
[22:59] it's worked out
[23:00] then when he passed you you say
[23:02] oh i still don't see there he was
[23:06] you didn't have faith your genuine faith
[23:09] would do it right there your your
[23:11] genuine faith will make it so surreal to
[23:13] you that
[23:14] look at that little woman with a blood
[23:16] issue she said if i can only touch the
[23:18] border of his garment i'll be made well
[23:20] and as soon as she did it she said she
[23:23] felt within herself that her blood
[23:25] issues stopped and
[23:28] she actually believed it
[23:31] and when she touched it the fruit that
[23:34] it stopped it stopped jesus turned and
[23:36] said who touched me
[23:39] that's perfect faith
[23:41] and that same perfect faith tonight will
[23:44] touch jesus christ just as it did then
[23:47] a woman come with a perfect faith for
[23:49] that time
[23:51] now
[23:52] now we see
[23:54] at first the disciples didn't have this
[23:57] perfect faith
[23:59] they didn't have it
[24:00] because they had christ walking with him
[24:04] but then afterwards christ was in that
[24:06] amen and so you see
[24:09] it's hard then to have this perfect
[24:12] faith
[24:13] without the holy spirit
[24:15] it has to bring it
[24:17] it does now you say the disciples didn't
[24:19] have perfect faith no or they had an
[24:22] epileptic child there
[24:24] that they were trying to cast this devil
[24:26] out
[24:27] and they couldn't do it
[24:28] and the father seen jesus coming and he
[24:31] said we have brought my son
[24:33] to to your disciples and they could not
[24:36] cure him
[24:39] and afterwards the disciples asked jesus
[24:42] saying why could not we cure him and
[24:45] jesus says because of a lack of faith
[24:49] and of your unbelief
[24:51] that's right because of your unbelief
[24:54] that's
[24:55] i remember
[24:56] they had this house
[24:59] jesus had given them power
[25:01] the healer was sick to raise the dead
[25:03] and cast out devils just a few days
[25:05] before that yeah
[25:07] they had the power
[25:09] but not the faith
[25:11] to use the power
[25:13] there's the brandon tabernacle there's a
[25:16] church the bride today
[25:17] the holy spirit is here with the power
[25:20] amen but you haven't got that faith
[25:24] amen
[25:26] see what i mean
[25:29] it takes faith
[25:31] to move it
[25:32] here i got a shell that i hand loaded i
[25:35] know what it'll do by ballistics like
[25:37] the word
[25:38] but i've got to fire the gun the fire
[25:42] has to get to the power the power's got
[25:44] the power of it's got to have the fire
[25:46] to light it off
[25:48] and the same thing that powers in the
[25:50] shells
[25:51] but it needs
[25:52] bait to charge it
[25:57] that's what it takes
[25:59] the perfect faith to ignite the power of
[26:03] the holy spirit which we have now since
[26:05] he's come upon us amen faith to ignite
[26:09] to see great things
[26:12] is to the faith something that presents
[26:15] it to you for the heart full of joy you
[26:18] walk into the stick room knowing exactly
[26:19] what you're going to say
[26:21] walk in there i know what's going to
[26:22] happen something's already been revealed
[26:25] and you know it
[26:26] when you walk in in the name of jesus
[26:28] christ rise up from there
[26:30] say up the law
[26:32] there you are that's perfect faith
[26:35] if there'd be 10 million people said
[26:37] they're saying it wouldn't happen you
[26:38] know what's going to happen anyhow
[26:40] because you know it
[26:42] it's going to happen regardless what
[26:44] anybody else says you're the ones got
[26:45] the faith
[26:47] could you imagine joshua
[26:50] he called the elders of israel together
[26:52] and said uh brethren
[26:54] we are the servants of the lord i would
[26:57] like for you to say uh ask the lord if
[26:59] it'd be all right if uh if he give us a
[27:02] little more sunlight see
[27:04] and hold the son of the one
[27:06] no
[27:07] he had need of it and without prayer
[27:10] without anything he had need of it and
[27:13] he just commanded the son
[27:16] he said stand there amen
[27:19] i have need
[27:21] and i'm in the service of the lord
[27:24] and he sent me over here to do this job
[27:27] and i'm doing the best i don't know how
[27:29] and the enemy is routed
[27:31] and they're out in here if i let the sun
[27:33] go down they'll get together and cause
[27:34] me more trouble so stand still
[27:38] you hang there
[27:40] hey man
[27:41] for 24 hours
[27:43] [Applause]
[27:45] now if the world's turning it holds it
[27:47] up and the sun stays in the place and it
[27:49] don't run what happened then
[27:52] that's right
[27:53] now you make yourself a infidel
[27:56] if you say
[27:57] this and then if you don't you shouldn't
[27:59] full of science because they said the
[28:00] world stop and drop so now what
[28:03] if you say god's word is not right then
[28:05] you're an infidel
[28:06] yeah
[28:08] but it happened that's the main game
[28:10] i don't know the mechanics of it but it
[28:12] happened
[28:13] i don't know the mechanics of the holy
[28:15] ghost but i know it fell on me
[28:17] i can't tell the mechanics of it but i
[28:19] know the blessings of it that's that's
[28:21] all i i don't know about is the blessing
[28:23] of the holy ghost and mechanics keyword
[28:26] semester is secret
[28:28] this boy cannot be healed because the
[28:30] disciples had power jesus gave them
[28:32] power to heal all manner of sickness to
[28:35] cast out devils to cleanse the efforts
[28:37] and to raise the dead
[28:40] he gave that power
[28:42] but they didn't have faith to operate
[28:44] the power that they had and then they
[28:46] questioned jesus and said well now why
[28:48] couldn't we do it now remember they had
[28:51] the word
[28:53] and the word was flesh then
[28:56] and the word told them i give you power
[28:59] heaven
[29:01] amen
[29:03] i give you power
[29:05] and they had the power
[29:07] but they didn't have faith to operate
[29:10] the word that was in that
[29:12] amen see what i mean yeah
[29:14] but
[29:15] jesus had it
[29:18] he was the word and he had faith that
[29:21] what he said would happen
[29:23] and man he said oh bring him here
[29:27] how long will he suffer
[29:30] he has faith with his power
[29:33] how did he
[29:35] he said i can do nothing in myself
[29:39] wow he relied upon
[29:43] what he was
[29:45] he relied in knowing that he was the
[29:47] word
[29:48] and he had faith in god
[29:51] who made him the word
[29:53] he was god the word
[29:55] and it was in him and that giving faith
[29:57] because he understood his position
[30:01] he knowed what he was because the
[30:03] scripture had said he was this
[30:06] and here the scripture is hiding to
[30:07] prove that he was exactly what the
[30:09] scripture said he would be and he knew
[30:12] what he was
[30:14] therefore he relied upon what god had
[30:18] made him amen
[30:20] and if he did that then can't we rely on
[30:23] what god made us as believers
[30:26] these signs shall follow in that belief
[30:30] [Music]
[30:31] he had faith
[30:33] and what he was
[30:35] and if you are a believer you have faith
[30:37] in what you are
[30:39] you are a believer
[30:41] and if you've got faith in god the bible
[30:43] says over here
[30:45] if our uh
[30:47] if our hearts condemn us
[30:49] then we can have faith
[30:51] but if our hearts don't condemn us then
[30:53] we have faith
[30:54] we have confidence towards god
[30:56] if you want to read that found saint
[30:58] john 3 21. i got the scripture written
[31:00] down here amen
[31:03] then i mean first john 3 21. uh notice
[31:06] if our hearts condemn us not
[31:09] then we have confidence towards god but
[31:11] as long as you're doing things that's
[31:13] wrong you can't have confidence towards
[31:15] god
[31:16] so you see you can you automatically
[31:18] know that you're wrong
[31:21] you automatically touch yourself like
[31:22] you're a sinner
[31:24] by knowing that you're wrong
[31:26] but when your heart don't condemn you
[31:28] and you know you are a believer and
[31:30] there's nothing between you and god you
[31:32] can ask what you will and know that it
[31:34] will be given amen because it's the word
[31:37] that's given to you just like it was to
[31:39] those disciples now the only thing you
[31:40] have to do then is have faith in what
[31:43] you
[31:45] and have faith in what the word says you
[31:48] are
[31:48] and jesus has faith in the word of god
[31:51] that says what he was it is written on
[31:53] thee
[31:54] didn't david and the psalms and the
[31:56] prophets and all of them speak of him
[32:03] [Music]
[32:19] you
