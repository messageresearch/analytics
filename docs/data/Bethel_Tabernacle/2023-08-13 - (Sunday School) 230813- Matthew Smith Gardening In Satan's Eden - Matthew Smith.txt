TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and God said behold I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the Earth and every tree in the witch is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat and to every beast of the earth and every fowl the air and everything that creepeth upon the Earth wherein there is life I have given every green herb for meat and it was so and God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening in the morning were the sixth day okay y'all can be seated so um I was I was seems like these days there seems to be a um an obsession with uh you know what does it mean to be a human being like what is it you know like we have um the gender movement you know everybody's talking about what does it mean to be a man or a woman all these things and I was in I was hearing a discussion about that and it occurred to me you know in the Bible one of the first things that you know really when you look at what when God created Humanity he really lays out what humans most fundamental inner workings are right I mean this Obsession of what is what does it mean to be human I mean people philosophers have been going on about this for thousands of years really I mean you talk hear ancient Greeks have written down what they thought about what it meant to be a human you know 400 years BC I mean this is people have been you know frying their brains trying to figure this stuff out for a long time but really if you look at what how the story of God's creation of of man it really lays out fundamentally what you know there's there's certain fundamental aspects of what we are and how we function in that and um I find it interesting you know we would think well you know everyone's heard the phrase to air is human right humanity is imperfect and everything you do you have to it's the contending with the imperfection of your own abilities well according to the Bible you were something before you were imperfect right like the the I mean we would think that that Frailty and and and and mortality are some of these the fundamental aspects of what it means to be a human no actually beyond your mortality and imperfection is something a lot older than that right there's something bigger that's beyond that um before humans were imperfect and mortal they were made in the image of God right before it's I find it interesting that when God made Humanity the the two things that they were from the word jump right was that they were made in the image of God and that male and female created he them right that we can see that God made males and females and he made them in the image of God from the very beginning it was before man fell it was before they were anything else right they had the Divine spark of deity within them right they were the representation of Christ on the Earth and that they were male and female which I think is an indication of exactly where we are today why is it historically that every time a civilization Rises higher and higher in Civilization they're we always see a cultural movement to start questioning what gender is right you see these big why is it in Satan's even the Pinnacle of Satan's Eden we're breaking down what gender is right this is like the again one of the things that God instilled within humans from the very spark right from the very beginning because ultimately what it is is the devil is trying to destroy the the absolute Foundation of what God created humans to be and within this I thought you know as I'm reading through the story it it struck me that what God called humans to be what he his his Ideal Image um in some sense are gardeners right humans were to take he created a garden and he set Adam and Eve to have dominion and to be caretakers of a garden right that they would have and see gardening has a um gardening has a a particular atmosphere about it right it's it's in order to be a gardener you have to have patience you have to have it can't be about instant gratification because you will kill your plants doing that right you have to have a certain amount of um faith that what you what you put in the ground is going to come up later there's so much of everything God has of of what we as Saints of the end time are is wrapped up in in in in seed in in in planting and of growing right um so the other thing that I that I noticed is and this is this so struck me about humans being created in the image of God right um number one is that um it speaks to why because if you're the image of God speaks to why uh certain things are the way that they are we as far as I'm aware there's not a whole lot of this maybe somebody could correct me on this I don't know I was not able to find it um but I don't know of any particular scripture where it deals where the Bible specifically talks about nicotine I don't know of any where the Bible talks about smoking however we teach that that's you know that God does not uh this that's not acceptable for a Christian to do why not well it's because you're the image of God and by partaking in that you are defacing the image of God right you're poisoning that thing that God created as his representation on the earth and you're destroying it I mean it's it's I know there's there are some scriptures that deal with this but we don't we generally don't you know we preach against things like piercings and tattoos and and things like this why because it defaces the image of God right there's a you know if if we if there's a statue of George Washington out in town and when you found it there was you know spray paint all over it and you know garbage piled up on it and people dug big gouges out of it and you know shot Nails in it with a Hilty gun we're going to look at that and say well clearly somebody doesn't like George Washington very much right it's pretty obvious their motivations for doing this well when you see somebody who is covered in piercings and their body has been covered in tattoos and they have all these things you know they're they're uh poisoning their bodies with all kinds of substances well we can pretty much infer that if they're supposed to be the image of of God that something is driving them to to deface that and whatever that thing is it doesn't like God very much right um but moving on to to where I was saying with what we are as a you know to to be a gardener right God has given us a a small you know a garden to rule over you think well I mean Adam and Eve they kind of had the whole this whole Garden of Eden and does that really apply to us well yeah you have a little piece of the earth that you have full dominion over right you're made of the Dust of the Earth you might not have any authority over anything right maybe you're just a young person but you do have authority over that you have you have dominion over that piece of Earth that God has given to you um and it's your it is you know going back the last time I did Sunday school we talked a lot about you know freedom and responsibility and I guess the what I was really trying to get at with that was that you know in America we have so backwards the idea that will we have freedom we have freedom and it's just magically we have freedom God gave us freedom and God gave us these rights you know it's all about rights it's my right well the reason you have that right is because you are made in the image of God and you have a responsibility to act like it right you have a responsibility to do the things that God has commissioned you to do that is your responsibility and because of that you nobody has has the the the authority to come between you and fulfilling what God has for you to do and that's what that's what real freedom and liberty is is the is the freeness to fulfill God's commission right um I I ha I can't as Pop come back to my mind I I one of the things that I I thought of was um you know going back to the whole idea of of defacement right of the of the human body is ultimately a defacement of of the image of God you know it's it's so striking to me that you know that's you have these kids and I don't know this is a new thing but I think it's it's uh certainly seems more modern maybe it's just because of our awareness of it but it seems like anymore so many young people are dealing with suicide and self-harm right how many how many typically young girls though it's I don't certainly don't want to uh you know put a a bottleneck on that but you get a lot of kids covered in scars from cutting and things like that or kids who are um having having suicidal issues well what is that it's something within them that is and it's not just young people there's old people dealing with this too it's people who are there's something that hates God so much it's trying to destroy the image of God right it's the it's a devil who hates the image of God so much he's he's obsessed with covering it in scars right which is ironic the irony here the the thing to bear in mind in this the irony of that whole situation is that by doing that it is the devil admitting that you look like Christ because otherwise he wouldn't want to face it right it's the that's the that's the irony in the whole thing is that because there's this move in this time to destroy the human to destroy a Christian and what it means to be a Christian it's it's really an indication you know it's it's it's it's unfortunate and it that's the the ugliness about mental issues like suicide and things like that is the person is convinced that they're worthless and yet the fact that that's the struggle is an indication that the devil sees something worthwhile there that he's trying to destroy anyways um wow that time is fine today um so I'm I want to look at this idea of being a gardener right the idea that that uh God had commissioned Adam and Eve to to have dominion over this Garden to to plant and just and to sow and things like that and so much of our Lives you know we have this the garden that is yourself you know it's the it's the you have your the things that you can touch right you're you're the the things that God has given you dominion over whether it's your family whether it's whatever it is whatever it is that you have um you have a responsibility to um maintain that and be a steward of it and to raise that up into something that would be pleasing to God and I find it interesting um we first of all I would I so often we tend to as humans tend to neglect certain things right and this is where I remember driving past a a field um it was clearly it was a farmer's field that had not been planted and it hadn't been planted for a while and it's just overgrown I mean it's I mean it's up to your waist in Weeds and when you look at that you recognize if you don't plant something that doesn't mean nothing will grow right oftentimes we as humans have a tendency to neglect certain things we'll neglect corners of Our Lives we'll neglect certain areas and if you've ever tried to grow a garden you're very much aware that the little places that you are not constantly on top of the little corners of the of your garden plot will grow they'll grow something and you don't have to do anything it'll be all by itself and it's nothing that you want and a lot of the times the stuff that we're not constantly proactively on top of the stuff that we're not constantly putting effort into bringing into subjection to the word will be though something is going to grow there and it won't be anything that you want right and so oftentimes we get slack and we'll get lazy and ultimately it's it's a it's a product of the fall right I mean what was the thing that what happened when Adam fell as God condemned him to contend with thistles right I mean you you can read that in um uh decided to hang on my notes ran away um yeah in Genesis chapter 3 verse 16 do we have a screen yet okay um if you could pull up Genesis chapter chapter 3 verse 16. but I mean ultimately it's it's God recognizing that um because Adam fell part of his curse um uh do go to 17 please just for the interest time yes and Adam he said because thou has hearkened under the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying thou shall not eat of it curses the ground for thy sake and sorrow thou eat of it in all the days of their life um is there a verse 18 . um yeah thorns and thistles shall bring fourth unity and thou shall eat the herb of the field 19. um in the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread till I return to the ground for out of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art and unto death shell thou return this is ultimately this this everything that you are is this Fallen nature of your flesh is going to produce habits that you didn't ask for it's going to produce um uh um it's going to produce um behaviors and attitudes and bitterness and anger and depression and all this this string of things that you didn't ask for your body your flesh your your who you are it's just gonna do it all by itself unless you are constantly tending it unless you are constantly speaking the word to it unless you're constantly bringing it into under subjection to the word and um just uh have to start wrapping up here but I you know we have um you know brother random talks about I don't have time to pull it up now but brother Brandon talks a lot about how you know Adam uh he he could just speak and things would happen right you know this tree needs to move over here he would speak and the tree just uproots itself and moves over there you know this mountain needs to not be there this Valley needs to go over there you know these things you know Adam could just speak and the Earth would just manifest in into what he spoke right and you know the the and so and then it talks about you know obviously we're aware that you know when God created the heavens Earth he speaks you know let there be and then out of the earth the earth just manifests into what he spoke right the seed within his word right that when he spoke within that word was a seed and that seed would go to the Earth and then Sprout and grow into um the Fulfillment of of his of his word and Adam in speaking intending the garden through the spoken word is is replicating what God the way God operated right he was an amateur God on the Earth well ultimately isn't that what we're called to do right we have um we have uh a position right God has put us on the earth and he's calling us back to a place of Eden so doesn't that imply that when we're attending our Gardens that we should be operating that doing that through a spoken word by by speaking in accordance with the word of God and then what we speak manifest right we to have faith in that would it would happen um I want to read this this quote um here it is this is from at Thy Word In 1953 it says um at Thy word Lord I'm going to rise up from here I don't know how I'm going to do it but at Thy word Lord that's it take God at his word in God's spoken word will materialize and produce just exactly what it says it will listen the right mental attitude to attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass I don't care what it is if you uh plant if you want corn you plant corn water corn leave corn alone it'll produce corn is that right wheat will produce wheat the promise of Salvation will produce a Christian the promise of the Holy Ghost will bring it to you the promise of Divine Healing will make you well any Divine promise of God and the Bible said that the word of God is a seed is that right Jesus said that A sower sowed and if you'll just take it in your heart and don't dig it up every day to see how it's getting along just sink it in your heart and settle it that's all walk right on God will take care of the rest of it he's obligated to his word do you know that everything that you see tonight is God's word materialized do you know that your body is God's word materialized do you know that the uh let's see um that concrete is God's spoken word materialized you know the whole earth is God's spoke is God spoke and said let there be and he believed his own word and an Earth come into existence if it didn't where'd it come from right and so so oftentimes we're running to these issues and oftentimes it's not so much you know that we're we have issues of you know what's going on around us that we struggle with right I mean though it happens you know sickness and and financial things and things like that it comes up we we um encounter those and and I find that oftentimes it's so easy for us to pray and and walk on faith when you know we're we're in a in a situation that we're kind of um sort of a exterior World sort of situation but when it's something in your heart something on the inside we have a lot less Faith or maybe it's just me I don't know it's a lot less Faith to say well that needs to come into subjection of the word and I'm going to speak and then it's going to come on come to pass right it's a lot harder for us to say this bitterness that I feel is going to come under subjection when I speak right it's harder for us to do that you know it's harder for us to to to to deal with with a a um you know anything that that uh you know like an addiction or something like that harder for us to look at that and say well I can walk on faith and and just speak the word and it'll come to pass it's harder for us to do that um and I think that but ultimately that's that's what it that's where uh we are in this day that was what the whole uh that's what um that's that's our over our Dominion right if you don't have dominion over the this piece of Flesh right this piece of the earth that God gave you then what do you have of anything this is the this is where you should have dominion the most right you should be able to walk on out on faith and and and overcome these things that that beset us so easily you we we have the authority to do that right the the devil has no more authority to to bind you the only way that he has the ability to do it is because we don't actually recognize that we can tell him to leave we tend to tend to just lay down and die instead of fighting and just accepting the Fate it's not that's not you know ultimately um really the the the the the the the drive that we should have is to is to recognize that we're free of these things and move forward and to because ultimately ultimately the word of God says there's going to be a perfect bride at the end right I mean God said it I I had a this is where we're freestyling now I don't have this in my nose I uh the other day I was talking to my wife and I said you know the Bible says that God swear by himself because he could not lie well I always could thought of that as well doesn't that I don't know this is the way I always took it was well that's just because God is physically incapable of saying something that's not true right you know if he knows that it's green and he says it's blue that would be a falsehood so we can't do that there's just he's impossible to do that well maybe but isn't it also possible that a being with the power of the spoken word that when he speaks reality rearranges so that what he said was true if he said it was green but it's actually blue would it would it be a lie if when he said it it became what he said it was right if if we're looking at ourselves saying oh we're imperfect we're the imperfect thing we could never be a perfect bride of Christ but God said there was going to be a bride of Christ so whether you are or not is kind of beside the point if what he says is going to manifest you and what he said it would be right is it a lie no it's just that your reality hasn't caught up with what he said yet um so anyways we're out of time uh so we'll have a word of prayer and let y'all worship Lord let's have a we'll stand Lord father thank you for this opportunity Lord to maybe say something that would benefit the people or just an encouragement might even just be the one Lord thank you for the opportunity to help just one Lord asked that you would take these things that I've said and maybe that the people will be able to grab hold and it would give them a little bit of extra encouragement to to not to not give up in this dark time Lord we thank you Father and we thank you for this opportunity to worship you and invite you to the service and that you would be with us as we praise your name in the upcoming service that we would ultimately partake in the ultimate form of worship and the hearing of your word and we ask these things in Jesus name amen
