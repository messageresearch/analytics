========================================

his glory with no one and that he says at the same time you'll be glorified so how is that how does that work it's because it's God's glory through us and in us and he wants his glory to seen it be seen in and through us so just these two words here are a whole series of sermons in themselves his glory in the bride and then it says the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel so what is what does he want from a bride he wants to produce seed he wants to produce his life on a multiplied form so the bride is going to take this word she's going to be the manifestation of that word and that word then is going to multiply in other words we're going to go out and we're going to get the the remaining of the predestinated seed we're going to call them and all those will come forth and bring forth fruit in their lives so then on the other on that's the that's the positive side that we see the negative side is that in our day we we have a day of feminism a day of uh women's Liberation is what they call it remember anytime you see the world use the term Liberation you can bet that it's exactly the opposite of that when you see Democrats speak about Freedom you can be sure that totalitarianism is coming what you see these things coming coming about in our day and what is what is it it's about it's a bondage to sin it's a bondage to evil a woman is not free by divorcing herself of what God created her to be she put she's putting herself in a position that ruins her and brings her to sadness depression sorrow Etc this is not being the one who wears the pants so to speak in the family is not what God has ordained for a woman to be and I'm getting way 20 screens ahead of myself so let me just let's go Ephesians 5 22 and 24 through 24. wives submit yourselves and to your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their husband their own husbands in everything amen so not a not a very fashionable verse right now and I'm sorry that's very hard to read uh people my age and older cannot read it young people probably can so I'm going to read it from my iPad here so this is from Lang's commentary on the scriptures just to give a picture here says the exhortation wives submit yourselves to your own husbands the Apostle had in this one precept of obedience for the wife a good and sufficient reason for defining the husband with your own this justifies the sharpening by which the command appears a natural one as to the Lord as you see there in the scripture submits yourself to your husband as unto the Lord right the singular requires according to the context a reference to Christ and as marks a reality behind the husband stands the Lord himself thus the obedience is characterized the obedience is to be rendered not to the husband as man but as to your own husband in and by whose person the Lord is honored who has established the relation whom the husband himself must obey hence it's not the husband as Lord so you see see there when you're as a wife when you are honoring your husband when you're submitting to your husband you're doing it unto the Lord that's your service to Christ right when you submit to your husband it's as unto the Lord just as when it says servants obey your masters right not with not as men Pleasers right we're to and and we're also to work heartily as unto the Lord right it doesn't mean the master is somehow so much greater and better and so forth that there's not an equality we know that there's no difference between a servant and a master a boss an employee there's no there's no there's no differing value but there's a different position there's a differing place it's not as though because the wife has to submit she has is lesser in value or lesser important in importance in the body of Christ or in the Family itself that's not what it's speaking about it's speaking about what her position is in the home what is God has designed her to be she's to submit to her own husband as unto the Lord in other words you're honoring and glorifying God when you submit to your husband right all right let me keep reading from the next screen verse 23 it says because the husband is the head of the wife so this designates generally every husband who has such is head of the definite wife Chosen and one by him the position of the husband is thus marked as of an organizing managing controlling and deciding character which is further set forth by the comparison immediately following as Christ also is the head of the church so it places him as parallel with the husband places Christ as parallel with the husband on on the head of the church the wife and the church then are placed as parallels right in a I think it's in Colossians 3 it says and husbands be not bitter against them it speaks of ruling with harsh rigor and like a dictatorship the Bible expressly commands don't lead your wife as a dictator right then in verse 24 it says nevertheless as the church is subject to Christ nevertheless means speaks of in spite of the difference between Christ and the husband right it's a the resemblance between the church and the right wife remains so it's it's like a adverse particle in the sentence nevertheless means I understand that Christ and the husband are exactly the same Christ is perfect without sin your husband is nevertheless the type stands right nevertheless your husband isn't perfect he makes mistakes and he'll Lead You imperfectly nevertheless nevertheless the church is sub as as the church is subject to Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands right if this strongly marks that this is reading from the commentary this strongly marks the analogy the verb is to be supplied as in verse 22. the emphasis rests on the final words in everything from such a command we are not to infer that the reference is to Christian wedlock this must indeed also be thoroughly correct neither the one or the other is to be accepted in everything is limited by the context of that to that which the husband as such commands and which the wife as such has to do but in neither contrary to the Lord Hodge says it teaches its extent not its degree it extends over all departments but is limited in all first by the nature of the relationship and secondly by the higher authority of God you see understand you understand be subject to your husbands in everything in other words it's that's a that's in a limited sense right it's in a limited sense as to what the relationship implies right so what the relationship implies is what the Lord implies it's not what we get to say it means it's what what that relationship implies and secondly the higher authority of God in other words if your husband commands you to do something contrary to scripture you're not obligated to obey your husband you're obligated to obey God but don't say that every time your husband speaks I'm obligated to obey God okay huh so let's look at the value of women that Jesus brings an incredible transformation Mark 15 41 understand there was not a single School in the days of Jesus that taught women the Torah yep today to this day you go to Israel and if you go to a worship place there's a barrier and there's a little tiny spot for the women to go worship and there's a big giant area for the men to worship even at the Western Wall big huge open area for the men to go little tiny area that the women have to go in this is the concept women don't have the same value in this system leading up to the time of Christ women were not it's even written by the rabbis don't teach other than what she has to do in her responsibility in the home do not about keeping it kosher and so forth don't teach her anything about the Torah she doesn't need to know so here we have Jesus coming setting things in order who also when he was in Galilee followed him and ministered unto him and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem we read this we just go right over it like whatever okay but this is a this is a this is a quite a statement that's made he has women that are following his ministry that are listening to his ministry and ministering unto him this is what kind of rap weird Rabbi is this no Rabbi has such a thing Mark 16 9-11 now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast Seven Devils and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believe not so even the disciples the same approach as the rest of the society a woman's telling us something it's not true we can't believe that this is not merely because they were mourning and they didn't understand it this was more than that this was the approach of society at the time a woman's a woman's testimony meant very little so Look what Jesus Does God could have ordered he could have ordained anyone to be there if if if we want to make the gospel true in that day because we consider it you know we're making a fake right he he swooned and then gets up and they're they're trying to make a fake surely they're not going to send a woman and even write about it they'll cover that up goodness don't say that that's offensive don't say the woman was the first to witness him no one will believe us this is too fantastic and yet Jesus appears first to Mary Magdalene what is he showing he's showing the value of a woman to him is just the same as a value of as a man her word her character her life to Jesus is exactly the same John 4 7. remember this starts with Jesus says I must needs go by Samaria why didn't you make a better choice God you should have appeared to the leader of the synagogue and met him that's not what he chose to do he chose to go to the people who were considered no value I mean talk about no value this is a prostitute this is a woman with many husbands that no one would listen to she couldn't even go to the well at the same time as the rest of the women because she was of ill repute and Jesus there was a predestinated seed there in that soul in that woman and he chose he chose to send her to tell her testimony the opposite of what the world would expect or anticipate or think was right but here he must needs go by Samaria because there's a woman that he had to redeem and she went and said come see a man which told me all things that ever I did is not this the Christ then they went out of the city and came unto him amazing so this is the value that the Lord Jesus we can continue on on this on this topic but even what what I what we read before that the world would consider my goodness husbands love your wives even as Christ loved the church wives submit to your husbands they think this is crushing women it's completely different than what Society had made for for women in that day and age in that day and age it didn't matter if you were a Greek or if you were Egyptian or whatever Society you were in women were property women were merely owned women were taken cast aside and used for whatever you wanted to their voice had no say in the home their their life was not worth the same as a man Jesus is and Paul are coming to show us there's a different way this is the re this is the redeemed way they're not showing us that a man doesn't have a role and a woman doesn't have a role this is what our modern theological seminaries are put moving forward today no it's all egalitarian and a woman can be a preacher and a woman can you know lead the home and be a leader and etc etc they think that's what Redemption the Redemption of Christ where it says there's neither Bond or free neither male nor female right neither Jew nor Greek so they think all relationships are set aside well Paul is writing to people there are Bond or free people there are Masters and slaves right that's not what's being said it's not saying that the there's these relationships are over with it's saying in Christ we look at things very differently we approach things very differently this is this is our approach we don't approach women and men as as though they have inequal value we don't approach slaves and Masters as though they're they have unequal value right everybody has the same value everybody has the same standing in Christ not everybody has the same role he goes through that in First Corinthians 12. it shows that even even within the body everybody has a different role not everybody's called to preach not everybody's called to speak with tongues not everybody's called to prophesy not everybody's called to a leadership position right everybody has a different gifting the way the Lord has ordained and the same applies to to the home to to Civil Life to all these different things to the leadership of the church God has ordained a very specific pattern and program for us to follow the gospel restores that and brings that to the place right place where it's supposed to be it's a relationship of love and honor just think about that a home with love and honor between the husband and wife I wish I could get to it today but I'm not going to get to it but the the one of the portions when I speak about this is that it's a it's a beautiful I'm going to try to find this I think it's important I'm going to come back there men and women are different at the very cellular level every cell is marked as either male or female men have denser bones larger hands greater muscle mass men tend to be more aggressive and as a result have a greater tendency to be attracted to conflict competition and Leadership women tend to be attracted to nurturing and relationship building men tend to come part compartmentalize women tend to connect everything men are wired As Leaders women are wired to nurture are the way I would put it is to influence right so I wanted to get that and then go back here likewise your husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and is being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered so dwell with your wives according to knowledge what knowledge what knowledge should a husband have as he dwells with his wife she's a weaker vessel and your heirs together of the grace of Life airs together she's not inheriting the grace of life through you this was one time the idea there's the head of a household his CH his children his wife his slaves all inherit the grace of life through him so whatever he says that's what everybody has to do and they get the same benefits he's saying whether you are or not pal your wife is has inherited eternal life so you both have are inheriting it together your heirs together so understand that in the eyes of God you stand equally before him at the same time physically speaking she's a weaker vessel when we look at that word vessel we look at Second Corinthians 4 7 says but we have this treasure in Earthen vessels the act that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us now remember we go back to the very beginning we go back to the verses we read in Timothy that she he says I suffer not a woman to teach or usurp authority over the man right and she's she's to be in that position because why Adam was first formed then Eve so this is in God's very design it's not a result of the Fall it's not a result of sin God's very design is that the woman is a weaker vessel right and the man is a vice versa the band is a stronger vessel as I just read it's a very cellular level it's a very the way we are designed no matter how many times they try to tell you men I mean they sit in in Congress and they ashamed a young lady because she she was saying I was a swimmer and they put a man in in the team and we had to be all around this nonsense in the locker room and everything and of course they're he's stronger and better than we are right no matter how hard you try to make that not the case men are just merely stronger you look at tennis Serena Williams I think it is played against played and lost multiple times against the 220th ranked tennis player in men's so you see there's a there's a great difference between the strength of a man and a woman we're made differently we're made to have different positions right the man is to be there he's he's the one that should take the hits take the strikes take take the difficulties right he he shouldn't say and say oh my wife will my wife will take all that no we're to stand and be strong and take the difficulties take the trials and be there as a protector and our wife is there to be along our along our side and support us and all that and give us strength many times we as husband receive the strength of our wives because they they love us and they believe in us so they honor us and they try to help help us and push us along it's a beautiful thing that God does there doesn't mean she's weak spiritually or that she's supposed to be weak spiritually proverbs 31 shows us that completely different doesn't even mean she's supposed to be necessarily weak it's just that she is weaker than a man of course a woman should be I believe strong strong in faith ready to face trials together with her husband ready to face trials in her life before she has a husband or if she doesn't she should be ready to do that she should as the scripture says she should laugh at the time to come she looks at the future and it doesn't bring fear she has faith proverbs 31. who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies the heart of her husband does safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life she seeks wool and flax and works willingly with her hands she is like the merchant ship she brings her food from afar she arises also while it is yet night and gives meat to her household in a portion to her maidens she considers a field and buys it with the fruit of her hand she plants a Vineyard she girds her loins with strength and strengthens her arms she perceives that her merchandise is good her candle goes not out by Night She lays her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaff she stretches out her hand to the poor yay she reaches forth her hands to the needy She's Not Afraid of the snow for her household for all of her household or clothed with Scarlet she makes herself coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the Elders of the land she makes fine linen and sells it and delivers girdles into the merchant strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come she opens her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness she looks well to the ways of her household and eats not the bread of idleness her children arise and call her blessed her husband also and he Praises her many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all favor is deceitful and Beauty as vain but a woman that fears the Lord she shall be praised give her of the fruit of her hands and let her works praise her in the gates my goodness you read this verse and what is it I believe you sisters young ladies take this and look at this as this is what God is calling you to now you go through everything she she's doing I'm not so sure that it's EV impossible to do all of those things at once I think the picture is not it's a proverb right it's not saying you have to have this business and this business and this she's got like seven small businesses she's running out of her house that's not what it's saying about that what it's saying is she knows her place she knows her role and she does it with all her might with all of her heart and she doesn't look to do things the way the world wants her to do him she does it the way God has called her to and her the vision of her life is come comes to a head in these last two verses virtue we don't even know what that means anymore in our society she's a virtuous woman we're going to talk about this more next time we don't have time favor this means charm she knows that charm is deceitful you a Charming woman can be sometimes the very worst most deceiving person you think that it's that this is this is oh she loves me she cares for me she just wants to use you so a Godly woman doesn't mean you lack all Graces but a Godly woman knows focusing on charm is just an outward thing it doesn't last right it's deceitful and beauty is vain you know brother Branham says a woman should want to make herself beautiful right but you know what place this has what what place this holds outward beauty is vain it's meaningless right but a woman who fears the Lord she shall be praised that that should be our your vision that should be the vision we're preaching to the young to the young ladies all the ladies this is God
