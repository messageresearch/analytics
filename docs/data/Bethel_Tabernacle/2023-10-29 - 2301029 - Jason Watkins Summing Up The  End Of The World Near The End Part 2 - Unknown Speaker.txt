glad I got some people to preach to we've got quite a bit out amen under the attack of the enemy but uh he still ain't nobody amen you know don't ever forget my meaning that's not just I'm not just saying that you know like a wise guy you know you ain't nothing it's really not that what I'm meaning is more definitive than that he makes no decisions about my life period he ain't nobody to me amen he's my adversary but the Lord already defeated him so if I'm in the line and Order of God's word then God is obligated to back his word amen he doesn't owe me anything but he owes his word everything amen so you just remember that today Satan makes no decisions for your life that's what he wants you to think that's not true amen my life my times as David said are in God's hands alone that's it amen and I love reminding the devil of that amen praise the Lord you believe it happy to have visitors here with us today thank you for coming to make up for our uh slim crowd today sister princess so good to see you today amen praise the Lord everybody turn around stare at her amen right there happy to have her here been too long sis you should have been here sooner amen we're going to be remembering different families that are out today amen and even in my family different ones uh grandkids and everything amen so just the devil just angry and mad and uh Prince of the power of the air but remember Jesus said I've given you power over all the power of the enemy doesn't mean he doesn't have some power and ability but the power you have is greater than his power because your power is pure uncut power of God his power is God's power perverted see the difference amen praise the Lord Isaiah chapter 55 today want to continue by the help of the Lord from Sunday previous to the camp amen I only got a little ways down into that and I have more ground I want to cover today I won't get to it all amen looks like there'll be at least a third part minimally and so uh and so we just want to cover today what the Lord has burdened our heart with and I had to figure out where where that limit is amen but I believe I found it amen I believe I I've got the mind of the Lord I want to hear it again we're going to recap a just a wee bit this morning Isaiah chapter 55 and we're going to read verses 6 through n you have it say amen and I don't think I had any other announcements to make Isaiah 556 to N Seek Ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near boy is that good advice all right let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord here's the good news and he will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon you'd think nobody would turn this down I mean that's amazing that the offended party is willing to be forgiven forgiving and we're not the offended ones he is we're the ones who offended him and yet he's coming forward to say just return to me and it'll all be okay wow um for my watch what he said now we have a hard time understanding that but he's going to help help us here in verse eight for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayith the Lord thanks be to God if I was running the kingdom of God we'd be in a mess if you were running the kingdom of God we'd be in a mess hallelujah thank God everybody say thank God Hallelujah he's in control verse nine for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways now there's the heavens are uh unlimited friends we're not just talking about the clouds we're going on out into the Milky Way and on out into Alpha centor and on on on and on and on to No End Amen that's how far his ways are above our ways for as the heavens are higher than the Earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts let's pray Master we thank you for your word this morning I thank you for the anointing to preach and Lord let it be upon my body Lord so many of us not hitting on all cylinders today myself included but I know the anointing will make up for it so I'm willing to spend and be spent Lord for your kingdom for your people I pray you will help us now be with my voice and my throat and uh give me your mind I pray in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated amen praise the Lord better this Sunday than a couple weeks ago when I had to call that out so I hope it ain't just because of a thin crowd don't forget don't you know don't be running in and out so much friends you need to be here you need to hear every God there's always Necessities sometimes it has to happen mothers with babies and different things like that and little kids sometimes have emergencies so to adults but uh let's just that you know pleasing to the Lord so last time when we took up this thought summing up the world near the end and that's where we are and so I I we took this uh this this philosophical approach we didn't that wasn't the approach to our sermon we were taking the word udonia from we were contrasting the aristotlean way of contentment fulfillment and joy and happiness and we were contrasting that with the ways of Christ and the word of God and brother brandham did that and we were patterning this sermon is and I've recommended that you go and hear it because this series is patterned off of brother bram's sermon wisdom versus faith and we're not talking about the good kind of wisdom which is God's wisdom that's the only one that's good we're talking about the wisdom of man all right so let's go back and let's revisit that so we can get that fresh in your mind because it's been a couple of weeks I'll take my PowerPoint now brother Caleb and there's only a couple of slides so you can just make the change for me brother Caleb all right let's this is udonia or udonia it's pronounced various ways it means happiness according to the Greeks all right keep that in mind all right next screen um thought we had a backup one Caleb I see so I'm wondering where my text is let me read this for you since I somehow it's not there uh udonia is a term which comes from Aristotle's work called neoman ethics and it means individual well-being and happiness got that individual well-being and happiness and and Aristotle is going to put it forward as a Pursuit not just a that this an important Point not just a temporary feeling but he's saying this is this should be your Pursuit he's trying to teach you his ways to find peace contentment and happiness in your life all right it combines the prefix EU meaning good and Diamond which means spirit in the Greek Socrates also delved into goodness and the virtues of knowledge leading us to achieve the ultimate good now keep it brother bram's sermon in your mind wisdom versus Faith all right now my next screen oh there it is the word udonia is an ancient Greek word that appears in many philosophical texts historically it has been translated as happiness in philosophical uh context though it can mean wealth Prosperity or Good Fortune however most modern historians claim that this is an inaccurate translation udonia is not an emotion it is more a constant state of being all right take that down now we're not trying to as I said to you last time I'm not looking to preach a psych to you today all right but but but don't don't shut me off because I'm coming from the angle that brother brandham took wisdom versus faith and he took it and not only in that sermon but brother Bram talked about the reasoning of God and Eve reasoned the word word and should have stayed with God's word and this is a constant battle and the reason for that and I'm going to say this more than more than one or maybe more than a couple times you're going to have to remember that the that even though you're born again of the spirit of God you're still living in an unconverted body and your flesh which brother Bram divides it up between flesh and spirit that's really those 10 senses that make up the Fallen part of you that soul that's you is the nature of God that that's the real you amen as Paul said at one time we were all um had our conversation in the lust of the flesh the things of the world is that right is that right and and we were the children of Wrath even as others right but God who is rich in Mercy loved us while we were Sinners he loved us already he didn't start loving me when I repented he loved me because I came from him and he knew he always knew I would believe his word and I do because I can't not you say well what about the parts you don't understand friends if your faith doesn't go beyond your understanding you're in a world to hurt my faith always is going to go beyond my understanding because God has already told me his ways are higher than mine and his thoughts aren't like mine and if I try to figure him out with my own thinking I'm going to be in a log Jam things aren't going to seem right they're not going to seem fair they're going to you know we've got to realize that this Fallen let the mind which was in Christ be in you see let that one operate let that one inform your thinking let that mind guide your footsteps is that fair if you don't then then you'll you'll find find yourself you in in a in a ditch sure sure enough want to be in a ditch amen praise the Lord I want to I want to be amen balanced in the word of God I my goodness I I heard a great man make a great statement he said you know and to this effect that if you're going to walk and follow Christ you're always going to have people you know who who get offended when you're not in their ditch I don't want to be in nobody's ditch I want to be in the middle of the road amen so we found out then that that that part of you that that memory and reason and affection conscious and imaginations say well I thought it was you know my taste my touch my SM those are just inlets that's how you contact the world through your touch through your sight through your hearing through your smell through your taste but that that that part of you that makes decisions is in your mind where the memories are and Satan can anoint those and then he can he can light up your imagination and tie it to a memory and then pour in some reasoning and get you thinking there and if you're not careful then that thought which it could be contrary to the word of God will cause your flesh body to act out in ways that aren't according to this amen see and that's why my dad always told me he reminded me of the scripture bring every thought subject every thought can we agree with that today bring because I should because I have to know you know a man's got to know his own limitations amen man's got to know his own limitations a man's got to realize that that that that that his heart is is is exceptionally Wicked and deceitful see that human that Fallen part of you and it will misguide you and mislead you and and disappoint you and you'll be disappointed in yourself you'll say how did I do that how did I let this happen because you didn't bring every thought subject and my dad said if you'll just do that it'll never get to the flesh because if you'll take that thought contrary to the word and bring it to to the Holy Ghost he'll kill it we remember all remember brother brother Joe how Shell's you know what was it the hobo or the bum that he threw throw it in jail and and and he you know he said he thought of it that way you know put him in prison oh my it was so funny but it was so good so so we find that this is this is so necessary my there's so much I want to say today but I'm going to have to be real studious and stick to my notes or I won't get uh what What the Lord Has for us today I feel myself wanting to run ahead so so just as a refresher so make make sure sure we're clear in wisdom versus Faith so this term this Greek term yudia is a concept of ancient Greek philosophy and it refers to a state of flourishing well-being or happiness that in Aristotle's View the higher value in the approach of Christ see toward uh udonia or toward what is real lasting happiness and fulfillment in part one we exposed the flaws and the inferiority of man-made wisdom amen since since since I since Aristotle's view his approach relies on and here's the Fatal flaw it relies on the goodness of humanity which God had already said that there's none good not one see and you know just like I I said here it's not in my notes but the Holy Spirit brings it back to my memory you know we just came from our youth camp and we believe that young men and young women should should seek the will of God within the family of God should seek God to bring their predestinated mate and their focus should only be and they should never look outside the family of God and and and and and if you find yourself uh with a a fancy for someone outside the word of God stay out of the way and let God bring them in cuz all you'll do is hinder God and you'll hinder that person see and so you say well oh he's a good boy I've heard that so many times girls who uh go outside the the safety of God's word oh he's a good man no he's not there's none good boys say oh she's a good girl no she's not there's none good until you're born again of the Holy Spirit and even then you're still got a fallen nature in your flesh see so this was this was the aristotlean flaw because it relied on the goodness of humanity which is never guaranteed whereas in contrast God's word and God's ways are always good and they're always correct so Aristotle's approach while sounding admirable it has its limit limitations precisely because that it it relies on human willpower and effort to achieve a sense of of real uh joy and happiness in other words it puts the burden of something I it it puts the burden of the individual to be good and virtuous the way of Christ on the other hand as we said last time offers something much more it offers a spiritual transformation that comes not of our own efforts but clearly from the grace of God this is why denominationalism is no good it all it is is denominationalism is only just more of aristotlean theory what it's based on see it's based on as brother brandham said it's man's Wisdom it's reasoning of man that's the beauty of the Christian message that God loves us unconditionally and made a way for us to be reconciled to him through Christ regardless of our failures regardless of our shortcoming this is why brother Brandon would say that that that God will never condemn a man for being a sinner said because he was born a sinner see God knows that God's a just God you're not going to impune him with Injustice every he he said he knows that man was born a sinner brother am said that's not what'll condemn him what'll condemn him in the end is that he remained a sinner when he didn't have to that the blood of the Lamb provided a way out see and so in part one we found that the human that human happiness and this was a big point that human happiness and I and I didn't make this I didn't really cabbage down hard on it on part one so I really want to nail it down today that human happiness and human Joy are different from the joy of the Lord which is our strength because the joy of the Lord that is our strength doesn't require happiness or fortunate circumstances or blessing in the rain you still have it in the Cloudy you still have it in the trial you still have it the joy of the Lord supersedes all condition that we might face that's what's that's why it's supernatural it's not natural It's Supernatural so it's only achieved through the indwelling spirit of Christ Jesus ha having him living in you Jesus brings it down to as they say you know we have these these sayings Jesus brings it down to the brast tax in in St John chapter 3 Jesus as we would say puts it on the money Jesus as we would say he hits the nail on the head here you ready for this you ready to hit the nail on the head you ready to bring it down to Brass tax are you ready to put it on the money John 3 uh Caleb let's go with John 3 verses 1 to3 there was a man of the Pharisees named nicodem Nicodemus all right now I want you to pay real close attention uh to to this verse and look at the language it's actually saying there was a man of the Pharisees named at Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these men do do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him because they're seeing the sign of the son of man they hadn't seen that at that level since the man that came to Abraham in the tent in the cool of the day that to see it they' seen it through the prophets in a degree but to see it like that they're saying wow we haven't seen that since the days of Abraham so we know that you are a man come from God all right now catch it for for for we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man now catch it look at the Gap in his Revelation Jesus to him is just a teacher he's just a man and that's the problem see for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him that is so short of the truth God wasn't just with him God was in him God was him Jesus answered and said unto him here he is going to put it on the brass tax truly truly or verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God that's the that's hitting the nail on the head that just bypasses everything Aristotle ever would think that bypasses man's Wisdom you've got to come wisdom man's Wisdom is no good it's wisdom versus the faith of the Son of God I already know what I want today but you no way to get it until you willing to surrender you stop being you now since we're talking about man thank you brother Caleb since we're talking about man but be ready I got some more we're going to be in the book of mat Matthew quite a bit so since we're talking about man all right uh let's go to the owner's manual all right we need to thoroughly understand our subject so let's go to Matthew 4 and we'll catch 18 to 19 this is the plan of God for us all you ready how many want to know God's plan and Jesus Matthew 4:18 and Jesus Walking By the Sea of Galilee saw two Brethren Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were Fishers nothing wrong with that they had a good career they were dutifully support supplying the need of their family and he saith unto them follow me and I will make you Fishers of Men it didn't change their human occupation to do this in other words he's tying it together that yeah you're going to have jobs and families you're going to pay bills and take vacations you're going to have times of church and Recreation and prayer you're going to have what we call the functions of living but just remember I'm calling you to be more than that I'm actually calling you that in your life I need you to not just be Fishers of fish but Fishers of Men see all right Matthew let's go on to Matthew chapter 6 watch the warning of the Lord Jesus here one second make sure yeah okay so so we're we're we're coming down and we're talking about the the the difference between human it and God and what it really takes to have a fulfilled life so Jesus here is going to caution us and Matthew 62 and he says therefore when thou doest thine arms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the Hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have Glory of men today I thought to myself I'm going to announce that I'm I I almost subtitled my sermon the problem with men now calm down sisters I don't mean it like that calm down we're talking about Mankind we're talking about Humanity all right man ever sister in here set up straight when I said that tell it brother Jason therefore when thou doest thine arms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the Hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have Glory of men verily I say unto you they have their reward it's an interesting thing that that Jesus actually never accepted the praise or the testimony of men they come to him in John said who you know who give us your credentials you know you're you're you've got one witness who's your other Witnesses and Jesus just told him look them right the ey he said I don't first of all I don't receive the witness of men but you know if you if you have to know what about John what did John say I was if you believe John then you'll receive me if you don't receive me then you wouldn't believe him see because my Prophet came to declare me but but just so you know I don't I'm the head of a I'm the head of a kingdom that's going to be filled with people who don't regard the testimony of menen we don't we're not interested well I don't need men to to uh vote and agree with me I need God to vindicate my Ministry see and so actually Paul amplifies it in his letters in his letter to the Romans we're not going to go there today but Paul takes it teaching that not only not only do real Believers not depend on it that actually real Believers don't pursue it they don't chase it they don't care about fortune and Glory popularity clicks or likes they they don't they don't accept it and they don't chase it Hallelujah my men mankind is just messed up I hope I can get you to see that today I hope I can get you to see that they say well man you're going to hurt my feelings well I'm hurting mine too see we're we're messed up people and there is no chance for us except God come down in his mercy and give us his mind today how many want his mind today here's another problem on into Matthew Matthew 19 see so as we come to Matthew 19 so so I I want to I just want to make this I'll give you the verse in a second brother Caleb I want to make this final Point here at Matthew 6 is that acceptance by the world or agreement from the world order is not required for me to have perfect faith in what I'm doing in fact really in and probably in perfect contradistinction if I'm if I'm getting the Applause of the world I probably have a problem amen I mean you know it should be a red flag if we find that our beliefs and our ways are comparable with the world order or the world view I don't have nor want a world view not the world order I don't mind being here in the world it's God created it's my world I own it it's part it's for my f for his family and but I don't want the the world order in its Fallen condition and I don't I don't want the applaud it of the world cuz then I would be nervous how is it that the world is accepting me so easily They didn't accept Jesus They didn't accept the prophets Jesus said that to them which of the prophets did your fathers not kill tell me which disciple which apostle was popular that they didn't murder see so it's not that the Lord is saying to us go out and be an oddball brother Brandon was against you doing that he said now he's not against you being an oddball but he was against you making yourself odd because that's just another form of of of wisdom of man's Wisdom don't make yourself odd just be a Christian you'll be odd enough just doing that see all right now Caleb we'll to Matthew 19:12 here's men promoting and positioning other men for there are some Unix which were so born from their mother's womb God made them that see and there are some Unix which were made Unix of men Welly the last thing I would I would want to think that when I when I go home on Sunday afternoons I always find myself grateful that I can look back and see how God moved in his word and I already know it's beyond me and I'm so glad to know that when problems come and trials and tribulations and things and you have problems or I have problems I'm so glad to know that I've not been called of men and I've not been hatched out of an incubation chamber we we are the true living Saints of the Lord God he's obligated to us to keep us to protect us to help us to instruct us I I I think that every time I come out that door Lord I'm about to bring the word I can't do anything for these people but I know the word is Supernatural and it'll go out and wherever believing Hearts receive it it'll fix them it'll fix me it'll fix us hallelujah see so some are made Unix of men why is that a bad thing why is it a bad thing to have men and these programs of men glad you asked that's a good question mark chapter 7 Mark chapter 7:21 here's why that's a bad thing for from within out of the heart of who men out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts adulteries fornications murders so I if we are if I'm a man and I am then I and I don't have adulteries and fornications in my mind and I don't have murders in my mind I I I think about the love of God and about purity and about Holiness so I have to conclude that I'm a different kind of man than what he's talking about thank God I'm not that kind of a man see let's go back to Matthew chapter 15 sorry to jump you around today brother Caleb getting a good workout so here here you're going to find in Matthew 15 and we're going to go 6 to9 you're going to find out that the worship of men is rejected by God thus have you made the Commandment of God of none effect by your tradition ye Hypocrites well did Isaiah prophesy of you saying this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain do they worship me brother Bram would take this so many times and say look they actually worshiped Cain worshiped they all they all triy to come and worship Judas tried to worship caiaphus made a living worshiping Caiaphas see and so but Jesus doesn't deny their efforts to worship but in vain do they worship me here's why teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men there's no value in it if your experience in the word of God is just human wisdom and human Ascent to teaching if you can logically if if this is the limit I logically can see this teaching of God's prophet in the Bible so I agree with it I believe it I I that's the way I should do that's the way I should go that's the way I should live i g tell you something friends that's a good thing and I got because the brother Ram said it has to start there you have to agree with the word said if he can ever get that inner man to agree with the word then that nature dies and a seed Gene comes to life that's the new birth but it's got to go from here to here it's got to because this will this I promise you this will desert you in times of trouble if the you say well i' I've had trouble but if the temperature gets hot enough this will desert you this will have all kinds of things this will K do you like that right there you won't know whether to go you whether to come here or sick them you won't can't go forward you can't back up you're just going in a circle you're just in chaos come back and let the mind of Christ be in you I mean I want you to think about how Politically Incorrect you know in a large part of America if Jesus showed up in Washington DC and said this about the Jews with the climate right now with a political climate right now if Jesus Christ showed up at the Capitol rotunda and stepped out on the steps of the capital building and said you Jews you're Hypocrites well did Isaiah prophesy of you saying you draw nigh to me with your mouth and honor me with your lips but your heart is far from me my the conservative right would want to shut him down see but Jesus is not speaking just narrowly to Jews who who were unfaithful to Jehovah you know that it it's broader than that it's Jesus is speaking universally to anybody to to anybody that takes the traditions of men over the word of God am it doesn't matter what your lineage Heritage or nationality is he's speaking to the whole world see so the traditions of men can't be relied on history shows that history shows implicitly incontrovertibly that that mankind is forever straying away from the word of God you know the original word of God and and it and even you know I would say that one of the most reliable things about Fallen humanity is he's unreliable to stay true to the word of God that's his most reliable characteris ISC is that he's unreliable to stay true to the word of God and it doesn't matter if he starts in a perfect environment like Eden or if he starts in a perfect Recycling and a perfectly cleaned off world like Noah from there man will still go off the path and it didn't even take long I I I want to explore that further in part three but I I want to move on so he always starts you know doesn't matter what the condition of the Lord is Humanity has never not done that over time here is a a look at the history of mankind I'll give you this much of it here's a here's a a sneak peek a quick peek of the history of mankind towards the word Jesus is going to give us this in the middle actually a little further than the middle cuz he's he's at he's at roughly you know the 4,000 year mark since Eden roughly and there's only about roughly a couple thousand more years until the whole Plan of Redemption is wound up so he's he's a good two-thirds of the way when he says in Matthew 17 and we're going to catch verses 22 to 23 and while they Abode in Galilee Jesus said unto them the son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men and they shall kill him so the appetite for fallen Humanity has proven over 4,000 years at this point over 4,000 years Jesus is speaking authoritatively that the appetite of Fallen humanity is not toward God's word Matthew 16:23 but he turned and said unto Peter get thee behind me Satan Thou Art an offense to me for thou savest not the things that be of God but those that be of men friends I I I've had weeks to think about this I I I preached part one two weeks ago and all of the concepts that I'm bringing you today were in my mind when the Lord began to lay this burden on on my heart read it again but he turned and said unto Peter get thee behind me get thee behind me Satan he's not talking to Peter he's talking about the spirit that's anointing him Peter's not Satan you you're if you're a child of God you're not the devil and you never can be if you're predestinated to be a wheat you'll always be that amen see and so he turned to Peter get thee behind me Satan Thou Art an offense unto me for thou savest not the things that be of God but those that be of men so so I have to conclude that even sons of God you know um even even sons of God who make it a practice of being led by the spirit of God can actually find themselves thinking 180 degrees opposite of the will of God now it's a fair argument if you say that Peter didn't have the new birth yet that's true but the new birth didn't take away the Fallen nature out of his Fallen flesh Paul picks that up when I would do good evil is still present I want to do the things of God but I and the but I don't the things I don't want to do I find myself doing I'm a Wretched Man this Paul's speaking of his Born Again self I'm still a Wretched Man who shall deliver me there's only one I can't deliver myself it's Jesus Christ so so it is true that Peter wasn't Yet full of the Holy Spirit but even after he received the new birth he still had his Fallen T senses you know so I mean you you could say today preacher wow you're starting to really step on our toes who who who who you talking about preacher you know you remember my story about being stopped out in this parking lot many years ago were you preaching on me yeah I was I was preaching to everybody if the shoe fits wear it y'all know the other half if you don't like the shoe grow and it won't fit no more see here's a better question here's a better question and and and not to ask the preacher but ask yourself from because remember from the owner's manual y'all remember in the owner's manual when David said I thought on my ways Hallelujah so here's the question we should be asking it's the question I must ask me I'm going to ask three people me myself and I and the question is do I do I want to do something or anything without the leadership of the Holy Ghost and the answer is no no I don't not ever not today not tomorrow I can't trust me but I do trust him do I want to lead myself no I don't not today not ever see if Mankind in his Fallen condition could accomplish this without the help of the lord we wouldn't need a millennium if in his Fallen condition he could accomplish this there would be no more Prejudice or bias or Injustice there would be no lust to conquer or dominate it would truly be one for all and all for one and I'm here to tell you thanks be to God that'll never be more more true than in a millennial world oh I'm looking forward to that day friends with all my heart where G where the Bible God told through Isaiah I make a new Heaven and a new Earth Peter picked that up he said I make all things new give me Isaiah 65 Caleb let's read it before we go home oh yeah I'm doing good just pray for my strength here's a beautiful beautiful scripture Peter this is this is the verse he was talking about he said so for it's written and verse Isaiah 66 verse 22 through 24 for as the new heavens and the new Earth which I will make shall remain before me saith the Lord so shall your seed and your name remain isn't that beautiful and it shall come to pass that that from one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another shall All Flesh come to worship before me saith the Lord I know the world is in turmoil I know it's falling apart but it shall come to pass I know there's trouble and killing and violence but it shall come to pass I know we have ups and downs and trials and tribulations but it shall come to pass Hallelujah and they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of men that have transgressed against me for their worms shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be an aboring unto all flesh you see I I if if you if you if you look at it from a human perspective you you'll always be out of balance because we find that if if I just said to you today let let me just give you a quick breakdown and this is a simplified version okay it's far more intricate than I have time to cover today but God working among men simplified you ready so God has only ever directly and underscore that word because God has dealt with he God the sun comes up every day and declares the glory of the Lord Paul said the ancient people saw God in nature doesn't mean he was directly talking them like he did Abel or like he did Noah or like he did Enoch or like he did Moses you understand you understand but go but God fills all time space and Eternity but but but God has only ever directly worked through his seed line and that alone directly see that that you see that manifested from Seth to Noah Before the Flood and that's of course before Abraham and his blood descendants before the Jews ever even came on the earth amen couple thousand years before the the Jewish Nation ever came on the earth God was working with his seedline and and and um Dr scoffield picks that up and brother brandham endorses that where scoffield named those five you know you start out with innocence the Age of Innocence Adam and Eve in a Garden of Eden remember that they were innocent there was a veil they didn't know they were naked they there was no such thing as Sin see and then and then you come out and then you're going to pick up uh after the fall then the Bible refers to every man did what was right in in his own sight remember that then number three I think was human government this is from memory and uh and then and then number four was because human government under remember Nimrod and they come out of the Ark and then they started populating the Earth and I'm going to go into that more heavily in in part three but then they came but then come the age of Promise under Abraham remember that and then and then number five was the law under Moses then the then the then Grace under Christ amen then then the kingdom the seventh the kingdom and that's why brother brandham said these seals when he was preaching the seals and he comes to the seven seal he said I guess you noticed the little Collins boy the case in that leukemia girl and those were great Miracles brother brandham said what is it it's the kingdom coming as it has been because it had been coming once those seals were open that's the beginning of the Lion of the tribe of Judah bringing the kingdom hallelujah oh what are you a part of today friends you don't have to go by your own wits you don't have to worry about your own sick mind you can you can say I want the mind of Christ and you have access to it Hallelujah thank you see so so he manifested from Seth to Noah from from Noah to Abraham you know and then from Abraham came Israel and then through Moses and then David and then all the way out to John the Baptist and now God once again from the time of Moses he's dealing only directly with his seed line in the earth and that's Israel and then we find that Jesus the Christ comes who's the Keystone between the Old and New Testament and after Israel's rejection of Messiah as a nation and for the last 2,000 years he has only dealt directly with Christian Gentiles only see so they're they're s because there's salvation in no other name is that the Bible is that what the owners's Manuel says there's no salvation in any other name except the name of Jesus see so and then after his this is this is simplified and then after his Gentile bride is taken to the wedding supper he will again return uh under Moses and Elijah to claim true Israel totaling 144,000 remember that's 12,000 out of each tribe 12 tribes and uh and and from the so from the time of Abel God has always punished sin and Rebellion against his word and so it's not about a nationality see God will destroy all ungodliness he will he will destroy the ungodly Christian so-called he will destroy the ungodly Jew socalled he will destroy the ungodly Heathen see so you know and then of course heathens presumably the at least the ones down through time who responded to the word correctly enough you know in some way uh even perhaps if if it's just in nature alone they're they're going to be granted to be raised up in the Millennium to hear to have their chance to hear the gospel oh God's got a plan my goodness what a plan and then after a thousand years of peace on Earth comes that great and final Judgment of all Humanity from Genesis forward see so it's not about a nation it's brother Bram even talked about during the Holocaust how that he said it's not those those who are granted eternal life he said it's not a nation because they protected Jews because there was a number of European nations that took Jews in and brother brandham said that's not going to give their Nation a pass just like this land had the greatest Prophet never Strike since Paul that's not going to give America a pass because she rejected it you see so so not all Christians are real Christians not all Jews are real Jews not all Israel is real Israel understand so we don't get caught up in the political you understand we don't get caught up in the political that's not for us I know the plan of God I know who his people are I know what'll happen to Jerusalem Jerusalem will be the capital of Christ the King and Israel will be the re restored as the leading nation of the world that's prophecy but it's not the Wall Street guys it's those real children of Abraham it's not just C you joined a church or shook the preacher's hand but it's a bride who has given up her identity to Christ alone and she surrendered her mind and she's in tune with the word of God for this hour brother Brandon makes this statement and I started to put it in a PowerPoint but I didn't I just want to read it to you it's one quote from blessing prophet brother Kenny bring your team and come come on I want to read this CL don't don't run out the door now just let the team come don't be distracted I want you to listen I'm closing brother random says in blushing Prophet November the 25th in an evening service in 1956 this is one of not the but this is one of the last sermons that the America will get to hear while she still has an opportunity to change course and repent as a nation and follow Christ sadly she doesn't take it 1957 Dawns with America under an irreversible inescapable judgment so here's a prophet when I read this I thought Lord I'm going to include this in my sermon today because I want to identify I'm guilty that a way for a prophet to start I'm guilty I'm guilty of not doing the job of God like I should do I'm confessing it that I'm wrong I'm asking God to be merciful to me I look out here and see the opportunities that I have missed because of petty things little old insignificant things that didn't mean nothing I'm ashamed of myself as a gospel Minister before you I Repent before God and ask God to forgive me and the church to forgive me for being so dilatory about the work of God by the grace of God and by the help of God how many want that by the grace of God and by the help of God I'll not listen to what everyone trying to tell you something to do they got a program they got something for you to do nonsense I know God's program it's written out here in his Bible and I'm ashamed see brother brandom is trying to get away from the idea of not only men but even his own mind even his own self see and I I I and I when I go come to this again brother brandham gives a lot of detail about what happened to him in Africa and got trapped up in organized men who paid for his trip and he was and he was stuck because he didn't have enough money to get home and they wanted to change his itinerary and God told him not to do it and they pressured him and he did it Lord what can I do I'm trapped I'm stuck and the Lord said okay you do it but I I'll bless it however you're going to pay a hard price for it and I want to go I want to go to there in part three and he saysi know God's program it's written out here in the Bible I'm ashamed of myself as a minister of the Gospel 1 million Souls won I ought to have 10 million Souls one I'm way [Music] behind wow I can't hardly get my mind around saying that I ought a million Souls won and I still feel bad because it should have been 10 million back in the day I used to write a lot of poetry writing is kind of what I do essays and things like that I excel at that thank the Lord have an easy time putting my thoughts to paper and I used to I used to be quite the Romantic amen sister Debbie has a stack of poetries to write to her and I would write it about other things as well anything that struck my fancy and uh once I caught her I didn't write it so much anymore and when my mother-in-law who I loved so greatly passed away and I was there you know with her in her last days and something happened somebody made a statement and I just caught I thought wow there's that old inspiration and I grabbed a piece of paper and just started writing and I wrote a poem and actually used it at her her funeral her memorial service and I read it and family appreciated it and I appreciated the Lord for it and it seemed like it opened up something and I I was thinking about this sermon and I wrote this it's it's two different versions of me there's a me and then there's a a real me there's a you that's this but there's another you and it's the other one that needs to be in control Amen brother B said I found out there was another William brandham who was not the son of Charles and Ella Branham but he was actually a son of almighty God come from the Jee pool of almighty God put your mind around that and so I wrote these words the me from he that was to be must be the he that leads this he you see would always be the all he planned for me it's me where all the troubles be where Falls and fails occur so I must learn to yield and bend to his Most Blessed yearn to place my trust in Powers High beyond what I can see what he would have for me to be would be the me [Music] of bow your heads with me Lord I Thank You for Your word today I thank you for helping me in in body and I could feel the enemy trying to shut it down but you just prevailed and we got through it and I got to the point where I felt like I could pause for today we'll pick it up again Lord if there is a tomorrow if there's not Lord for us and tomorrow is our home in the sky well that' be just fine by all of us Lord we long to be there father we long to be at that wonderful gathering around the Throne of God where all the family of God where all wrongs will be made right where everything will be fixed and we'll be fixed I thank you Lord for your grace your mercy in the word today I commit myself into your hands as I read the this read The Prophet's own prayer I I take such an identity with it Lord and I ask you to forgive me Lord if if whatever way we've accomplished for you there's no doubt we should have accomplished way more according to the prophet 10 times more so Lord I just say father help me today I can't I can't go back and fix everything and uh I I can't go back some things aren't fixable all I can do is go right now from here and go forward trying to let your mind operate Lord in my life and I pray you'll grant that to every one of us here today Father we're summing up Humanity at the end time we're summing up Lord where we've come to and what we're facing in the last days ahead
