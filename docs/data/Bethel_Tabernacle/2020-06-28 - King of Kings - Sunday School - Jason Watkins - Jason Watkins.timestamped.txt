[4:15] start preaching a man but it's a good
[4:18] meal it's a good diet seven course meal
[4:20] amen
[4:21] it's the bread of life you believe that
[4:24] in Revelation chapter one let's just get
[4:29] those first eight verses the revelation
[4:33] of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him
[4:36] to show unto his servants things which
[4:39] must shortly come to
[4:41] pass and he sent and signified it by his
[4:44] angel unto his servant John who bare
[4:48] record of the word of God and of the
[4:51] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[4:54] things that he saw blessed is he that
[4:57] readeth and they that hear the words of
[5:00] this prophecy and an amazing there's a
[5:03] blessing just in hearing it read and
[5:04] reading it or hearing it read and keep
[5:07] those things which are written therein
[5:10] for the time is at hand John to the
[5:13] seven churches which are in Asia grace
[5:16] be unto you and peace from him which is
[5:19] and which was and which is to come and
[5:22] from the seven spirits which are before
[5:25] his throne and from Jesus Christ who is
[5:29] the faithful witness and the first
[5:31] begotten of the Dead and the Prince of
[5:34] the kings of the earth unto him that
[5:38] loved us and washed us from our sins in
[5:41] his own blood and hath made us kings and
[5:46] priests unto God and his father to whom
[5:50] be glory and Dominion for ever and ever
[5:54] amen
[5:55] behold he cometh with clouds and every
[5:59] eye shall see him and they also which
[6:02] pierced him and all Kindred's of the
[6:05] earth shall wail because of him even so
[6:09] amen
[6:10] I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and
[6:14] the ending saith the LORD which is and
[6:17] which was and which is to come here's an
[6:21] important word the Almighty amen if
[6:25] you're the Almighty that means you're
[6:27] the most mighty amen
[6:29] let's pray father we thank you for your
[6:32] word this morning and there is indeed a
[6:35] blessing in the reading it and just
[6:37] hearing it read father but that blessing
[6:40] attaches to those who obey it Lord
[6:43] that's the finished part of that verse
[6:44] Lord that those who keep the sayings
[6:48] which are written therein so father we
[6:51] know we don't want to be merely here
[6:55] but we also want to be doers of all your
[6:58] word help us today be with my lips Lord
[7:02] keep me from misrepresenting your word
[7:05] in the slightest father we just want to
[7:07] lift you up today and teach this little
[7:09] lesson we commit it to you now in Jesus
[7:12] name Amen god bless you as you're seated
[7:14] a couple of quick things that I want you
[7:20] to notice right out of the gate is that
[7:23] when Jesus is returning there's a couple
[7:27] of things to notice it speaks of his
[7:30] return beginning in verse 7 and it
[7:34] describes it further in verse 8 he
[7:37] cometh with clouds and every eye shall
[7:40] see him so we realized then that this of
[7:44] course is the second coming of Christ at
[7:47] the end of the Tribulation Period
[7:50] because in this verse it describes how
[7:53] that every eye would see him and in fact
[7:57] is every eye that will see him and they
[8:01] also which pierced him you say well
[8:04] that's kind of a redundant statement the
[8:06] Jews saw him 2,000 years ago why does it
[8:11] mention it again because don't forget a
[8:13] prophet in this day linked that
[8:16] crucifixion and brought it into the
[8:18] modern day and indicted a generation of
[8:21] the earth to say you have once again
[8:23] crucified the Son of God afresh and so
[8:27] this will be the time when the systems
[8:31] of man religious political and what more
[8:33] will see him everyone will see him there
[8:36] will be no doubt that he is there will
[8:39] be no doubt who he is there will be no
[8:41] doubt what the truth was and and and
[8:46] it's and if you'll notice that that's
[8:48] not the rapture of the church at the
[8:53] before the tribulation because when the
[8:56] rapture of the church goes prior to the
[8:58] tribulation the Bible describes him as
[9:00] coming like a thief in the night no one
[9:02] sees it no one notices it he gathers his
[9:04] his elected takes him home the
[9:06] tribulation set
[9:07] and at the end of the tribulation is
[9:10] when all eyes shall see him and those
[9:13] that pierced him all Kindred's of the
[9:16] earth noticed this shall wail because of
[9:20] him so this is not going to be a party
[9:24] this is not going to be a jubilee
[9:28] this is going to be people wailing
[9:30] because of the sudden absolute reality
[9:34] that they have followed the god of this
[9:39] evil age and they weren't following in
[9:42] fact Jesus that they thought they were
[9:44] they were following another Jesus we'll
[9:47] get to that more in the open the main
[9:50] service and so he we find this
[9:54] description they shall all Kindred's of
[9:58] the earth shall wail it's either these
[10:00] are too loud or this is too loud I'm not
[10:02] sure brother Joe but cut maybe just the
[10:05] monitors down maybe that's all that's
[10:06] needed just seems like I'm in a well but
[10:10] but all the Kindred's of the earth shall
[10:13] wail now catch the language because of
[10:17] him
[10:18] not because of the tribulation they've
[10:21] endured 42 months of the unimaginable
[10:25] horrors of the tribulation period
[10:27] they're not wailing because of their
[10:30] pain or because of their circumstances
[10:32] or because the world is ending
[10:35] they're wailing because of him because
[10:38] when he appears then every eye shall see
[10:41] him and everyone shall know where they
[10:44] stand and then they shall understand
[10:47] that their destiny is not a good one now
[10:51] it's interesting when we talk about the
[10:54] time of the end of the world we we could
[10:58] you know we look at the signs of the
[11:00] world today and it's not lost on us I
[11:03] don't think it certainly shouldn't be
[11:05] that the things the calamities that are
[11:08] be falling the world that the world is
[11:11] is in a state of almost stupid fication
[11:14] over they every report is just it's
[11:17] unprecedented it's son you know it's
[11:19] it's there's no
[11:20] reference they don't know what's
[11:21] happening every news report is bad and
[11:25] as soon as we get a little bit of good
[11:27] news
[11:27] it comes back bad again I believe and
[11:30] maintain this belief until I'm shown
[11:33] otherwise that we're never going back to
[11:36] normal as we knew it the world cannot
[11:38] get better according to Bible prophecy
[11:41] it has to get worse it must get worse
[11:45] because Christ is coming to take his
[11:48] bride out and then the then the sudden
[11:52] you're talking about falling off a cliff
[11:55] I want you to imagine this for a moment
[11:58] that in the that you know we can talk
[12:01] about and go back over hundreds of years
[12:03] and centuries and multiple centuries and
[12:05] even millennia and and you can look down
[12:07] through multiple millennia two three
[12:10] four thousand years back through human
[12:13] history and you will always see that
[12:15] global crisis is a gradual oncoming it
[12:21] just gets worse it gets worse something
[12:23] bottoms out there's kind of a redoing a
[12:25] government passes away an empire passes
[12:27] away another power rises up things start
[12:30] again and these things go over decades
[12:33] and centuries and and many centuries and
[12:36] so you don't find you know the last time
[12:40] you find the earth suddenly coming to a
[12:44] a disastrous catastrophe was in the
[12:48] antediluvian world in the days of Noah
[12:50] you don't find that again from that time
[12:53] all the way down through history and if
[12:57] you can imagine now that when the when
[13:00] the elected Bride of Christ is taken
[13:02] from the earth and a secret catching
[13:04] away that in the space of a mere 42
[13:08] months that's it the earth will go from
[13:13] fully functioning governments around the
[13:19] world civilize law commerce trade
[13:24] economies births deaths politics social
[13:29] issues religion
[13:31] the earth will go from from operating at
[13:35] full tilt on hitting on all eight
[13:38] cylinders and in the space of 42 months
[13:42] will come to a complete end you're
[13:46] talking about a precipitous fall
[13:47] that's almost uncharted you'd have to go
[13:50] back to the days of Noah to exceed
[13:52] what's going to happen to the earth and
[13:54] and so we find that you know these
[13:58] things that are happening today I'm not
[14:00] here to be the bearer of bad news
[14:01] I'm here to interpret modern events that
[14:04] are made clear to us by prophecy because
[14:06] knowing is half the battle and and and
[14:10] there's a there's a a peace and knowing
[14:13] there's a peace and you know it's when
[14:15] we say peace that passes understanding
[14:17] there is that that the Spirit of God
[14:20] gives us it gives us peace in our heart
[14:23] even in times of sorrow even in times of
[14:26] trouble but there's also a layer of of
[14:29] Shalom a layer of peace that comes upon
[14:32] us when God can reveal what you see
[14:36] happening in the word and you look at it
[14:39] and then you look at it and you go oh
[14:41] okay I see this is supposed to be
[14:45] happening okay y'all everybody calm down
[14:48] God's still in control there's a peace
[14:52] that comes with that and so I'm glad for
[14:55] modern events made clear in prophecy
[14:58] because the with the world you have the
[15:01] exact opposite the Bible prophesized
[15:03] that men's hearts and the last day would
[15:06] fail for fear and there is no greater
[15:08] anxiety or fear than a fear of the
[15:10] unknown just saw a documentary on that
[15:12] very thing where they were talking about
[15:15] that that's the greatest cause of fear
[15:17] and hysteria is when a calamitous event
[15:20] is occurring and no one knows what's
[15:22] happening or why it's happening and even
[15:25] and and they don't know what's going to
[15:26] happen and so this brings a great fear
[15:29] I'm glad today that I know what's
[15:31] happening I know why it's happening and
[15:34] I know what's going to happen say you
[15:37] can predict tomorrow with a 100%
[15:40] certainty say what's your prediction I'm
[15:43] in his hands
[15:45] hallelujah what's your prediction he's
[15:47] got his eye on me I know that he holds
[15:50] my life and he as David said my times
[15:53] are in his hands and I'm glad that it's
[15:55] that way you're looking at a man today
[15:58] friends with the madness of the world
[16:00] I'm glad I'm not making the decisions
[16:03] for my life
[16:04] I'm glad long ago I turned him over to
[16:07] the Alpha and the Omega who could see
[16:09] the end from the beginning there's an
[16:12] article that I read very recently from a
[16:16] professor at a university and he's gay
[16:19] he's garnered quite a bit of attention
[16:20] and in the academic world because of an
[16:25] almost uncanny predictions that he made
[16:29] a decade ago
[16:31] his name is Peter Turchin and he I'm not
[16:34] going to give you the bio on his life
[16:35] he's a university professor and at the
[16:38] University of Connecticut and today he's
[16:41] a 63 researcher who teaches cultural
[16:46] evolution at the University of
[16:47] Connecticut to give you that much and in
[16:49] and in 2010 he took a number of metrics
[16:54] and I don't want to do the whole
[16:56] breakdown today because it's not really
[16:57] what my whole class is about but I just
[17:00] want to drop it in as a note that he he
[17:03] made uh he made startling predictions
[17:05] that at the time in 2010 sounded
[17:08] fantastic that they were just it was too
[17:10] fantastic to believe he he was held even
[17:13] in derision and and yet his predictions
[17:16] have hit on the money and he predicted
[17:19] ten years ago based on multiple metrics
[17:21] that he was measuring historically and
[17:25] it was a complete scientific equation
[17:27] that that in that in or about 20/20 and
[17:31] he actually named 20/20 he said this
[17:34] nation would go into upheaval like we
[17:37] had not seen and he started talking
[17:40] about politics and and and he starts on
[17:43] my political tension he mentions racial
[17:46] tension he talks about finding you know
[17:49] monetary disparity you know between the
[17:52] haves and the have-nots he talked about
[17:54] so
[17:54] issues that we're not getting solved and
[17:57] and he looked back over history and he
[17:59] could see markers and he could see that
[18:01] that about every 50 years that we go
[18:05] through a cycle and he said we're gonna
[18:07] hit one in 2020 and it's interesting now
[18:11] that his colleagues are coming around
[18:13] going
[18:13] my goodness Pete you really hit that one
[18:16] on the head now his response to that is
[18:18] listen you you didn't understand me back
[18:21] then you all jumped on me and you know
[18:24] let me have it because you thought I was
[18:26] prophesying I wasn't prophesying I'm not
[18:29] a prophet I was predicting based on
[18:32] measurable metrics what I was giving you
[18:34] was hard science and and now he has no
[18:37] doubters because seeing is believing and
[18:40] and now here I'll give you this final
[18:44] thought here it's a whole article that
[18:46] you're welcome I'll share it too if you
[18:47] ever want to just let me know but he
[18:50] here's something that caught my
[18:52] attention that he says on top of
[18:55] everything that we that we see that it
[18:58] would need something to touch it off
[19:00] that he said there was such underlying
[19:02] tensions in a multiple multiple areas of
[19:06] human life in America especially but he
[19:09] talks about it being global even and he
[19:12] said there would need to be something a
[19:13] catalyst to touch it off like a powder
[19:15] keg and that ended up being Cove at 19
[19:18] now the scientists can't predict that
[19:20] God has to allow that so you understand
[19:24] that that what we see happening
[19:26] historically in the present in the
[19:28] future are not based on the contrivances
[19:31] of man the best laid plans of mice and
[19:34] men mean nothing to God they don't mean
[19:37] that to God God has everything in
[19:39] prophecy it's going along exactly I'm
[19:43] here to tell you we're exactly where
[19:45] we're supposed to be God is doing
[19:47] exactly what he said he would do and
[19:49] there is a remedy for our lives who are
[19:52] believers who are receiving a blessing
[19:56] from reading his word hearing his word
[20:00] and doing his word keeping those things
[20:03] which are written therein he says here
[20:06] at the end of his art
[20:07] on top of all of the metrics that I
[20:09] measured he Sturgeon says the COBIT 19
[20:12] pandemic has further worsened the
[20:14] well-being of large swathes of American
[20:16] population leading a leading driver of
[20:20] national instability and could make the
[20:24] public less likely to trust government
[20:27] institutions boy is that an
[20:29] understatement now listen to this here's
[20:31] his last scent here's his last phrase as
[20:35] millions of Americans remain jobless
[20:38] Turchin says there will be other
[20:41] triggers after this now here's a man and
[20:45] said that's coming a trigger that's
[20:47] gonna set the powder keg off and he's
[20:49] now saying there will be other triggers
[20:51] I can already see it in the same science
[20:53] there will be other triggers and he
[20:57] worries tensions these are his words not
[20:59] mine I'm not an alarmist I'm reading an
[21:01] academic paper to you his words are that
[21:06] there will be other triggers after this
[21:08] and as a scientist he worries that
[21:12] tensions may escalate all the way to a
[21:16] civil war he says here's his last
[21:20] statement
[21:21] unfortunately he says things are not as
[21:24] bad as they can be things are not as bad
[21:28] as they can be now these are the
[21:35] realities of where we live this is our
[21:39] life this is what we see happening so
[21:42] what's what what's what's a man to do
[21:44] what's a believer to do I'm here to tell
[21:47] you something friends I read you all the
[21:49] way down to verse 8 because verse 6
[21:53] calls him verse 5 calls him the Prince
[21:58] of Kings that means he's the king of all
[22:02] Kings
[22:03] that all kings have a prince over them
[22:06] and they're sovereign over them is Jesus
[22:09] Christ and it doesn't matter whether
[22:12] they call themselves a prime minister a
[22:14] president a Chancellor doesn't matter
[22:17] what they want to call themselves if you
[22:20] can call them a
[22:20] tater you can call them whatever you
[22:22] want you can call them
[22:24] but-but-but doesn't matter because they
[22:27] have a king over them and that is the
[22:29] Prince of all the kings he is almighty
[22:33] and he is in control my first and before
[22:41] this is Robbie Zacharias I love this
[22:44] make sure we got good volume on it okay
[22:53] revolutions and counter-revolutions
[22:55] wealth accumulated and wealth disbursed
[22:58] Shakespeare has spoken of the rise and
[23:00] fall of great ones that Evan flow with
[23:02] the moon I look back upon my own fellow
[23:04] countrymen of England once upon a time
[23:07] dominating a quarter of the world most
[23:09] of them convinced in the words of what
[23:11] is still a popular song that the God who
[23:13] made the mighty shall make them mightier
[23:15] yet I've had a craze cracked Austrian
[23:17] announced to the world the establishment
[23:20] of a German Reich that would last a
[23:21] thousand years
[23:22] I've seen an Italian clown saying he was
[23:25] going to stop and restart the calendar
[23:27] with his own ascension to power I've
[23:30] seen a murderous Georgian brigand in the
[23:31] Kremlin acclaimed by the intellectual
[23:34] elite of the world as a wiser than
[23:35] Solomon more humane than Marcus Aurelius
[23:38] more enlightened than Ashoka I have seen
[23:41] America more wealthier and in terms of
[23:43] military weaponry more powerful than the
[23:45] rest of the world put together
[23:47] so that had the American people so
[23:48] desired they could have outdone a Caesar
[23:50] or an Alexander in the range and scale
[23:53] of their conquests all in one lifetime
[23:55] all in one lifetime all gone gone with
[23:59] in England part of a tiny island of the
[24:02] coast of Europe setting with
[24:03] dismemberment and even bankruptcy Hitler
[24:05] and Mussolini dead remembered only in
[24:07] infamy Stalin is a forbidden name in the
[24:10] regime he helped found them dominate for
[24:11] some three decades America is hunted by
[24:14] fears of running out of the precious
[24:15] lose that keeps a motorway is roaring
[24:17] and the smog settling with painful
[24:19] memories of a disastrous campaign in
[24:21] Vietnam and the victory of the Don
[24:23] Quixote eyes of the media as they charge
[24:25] the windmills of Watergate all in one
[24:27] lifetime all in one lifetime all gone
[24:30] with the wind behind the debris of the
[24:33] fallings of our solemn supermen and
[24:35] imperial diplomatists lies the gigantic
[24:39] figure of one person because of whom by
[24:43] whom in whom and through whom mankind
[24:46] may still survive the person of Jesus
[24:50] Christ now I want you to catch that
[24:53] because because Robby is saying my
[24:57] lifetime I witnessed the rise of these
[25:00] tyrants
[25:00] I saw them rise to power and make these
[25:03] fantastical claims and I in my lifetime
[25:06] has seen it go Gone with the Wind and
[25:09] yet he's also observed that in his
[25:12] lifetime one power has never ceased and
[25:16] that is the one supreme power of Jesus
[25:19] Christ now it's interesting about Jesus
[25:23] and we're talking about King of Kings we
[25:24] read about him in Revelation and how
[25:27] that there's many many many scriptures
[25:29] that prophesy of Jesus in the Old
[25:33] Testament alone I'm gonna give you some
[25:34] numbers gonna blow your mind
[25:35] so really buckle up you ready in the Old
[25:38] Testament alone just the Old Testament
[25:41] Jesus Christ fulfilled more than 40
[25:45] major prophecies concerning him in the
[25:49] Old Testament there's actually around
[25:52] 300 prophecies that are related related
[25:55] to him in some in some way he in his
[25:58] just in his earthly pilgrimage on his
[26:01] ministry he fulfilled more than 40 of
[26:04] them direct now that's a number watch
[26:06] this now so when we talk about Jesus
[26:11] fulfilling
[26:13] all of those prophecies the odds now
[26:17] watch this
[26:18] the odds of a single person fulfilling
[26:23] just eight of those prophecies the odds
[26:28] of one man fulfilling eight because the
[26:31] book was written over many years by many
[26:33] different people and the odds of a
[26:35] single individual fulfilling merely
[26:37] eight of them is it's a number I've
[26:40] started to put it up here but it's got a
[26:42] lot of zeros it's basically this 1
[26:45] million trillion to 1 the odds of one
[26:52] man fulfilling merely eight is a million
[26:56] trillion to one and he fulfilled more
[26:59] than 40 of them people don't even
[27:03] understand what a million trillion is
[27:05] let me just let me just break down
[27:07] million billion trillion all right if I
[27:10] said to you today if I said to my son
[27:12] Chris I said Chris I want you to sit in
[27:15] that seat for a million seconds million
[27:18] seconds Chris Chris would say okay
[27:20] million seconds that's pretty fast one
[27:22] two three I mean what am I gonna what
[27:26] could it take few hours how about twelve
[27:29] days a million seconds is 12 days now
[27:36] what about a billion seconds I know what
[27:39] you're thinking before I read and I
[27:41] thought the same as you I thought well
[27:42] if a million seconds wow I was shocked
[27:44] it's 12 days I forgot a few hours okay
[27:47] so it's 12 days well then a billion
[27:49] let's let's dump let's triple it let's
[27:52] triple it and add some let's just call
[27:54] it 50 let's call it 50 days if a million
[27:58] seconds was 12 days a billion seconds
[28:01] I'm sure if I triple it and then add
[28:04] some more fur for just for safety then
[28:06] I'll be sitting there 50 days try 31
[28:09] years now Jesus fulfilled not eight and
[28:18] it would to fulfill eight would make it
[28:20] a million trillion to one a million
[28:23] trillions we haven't even touched
[28:24] trillion yet so you say
[28:26] okay if million seconds is 12 days then
[28:30] you can sit there still for 12 days
[28:31] Chris you sure couldn't sit there for 31
[28:35] years if I asked you to sit there for a
[28:37] billion seconds so I need you to sit
[28:39] there for a trillion seconds Chris okay
[28:42] so let's just really reach out there
[28:45] this time I'm not gonna get fooled I'm
[28:47] gonna go ahead man if a billion was 31
[28:50] years I'm gonna double it I'm gonna
[28:52] triple it I'm gonna Quadra
[28:54] let's just go all the way out there and
[28:56] let's call it 200 years try 31 centuries
[29:05] that's math for you a million seconds is
[29:09] 12 days a billion seconds is 31 years a
[29:13] trillion seconds is 30 1688 years that
[29:20] is more than five times longer than the
[29:24] human history since Adam in the Garden
[29:28] of Eden more than five times since the
[29:32] days of Adam five times and that's one
[29:36] trillion for one man to fulfill eight
[29:40] Old Testament prophecies would be a
[29:42] would be a million trillion to one I'm
[29:46] here to tell you something you're King
[29:48] of Kings has earned his title you're
[29:52] king of kings in fulfilling 40 more than
[29:56] 40 Old Testament prophecies I'm here to
[29:59] take some friends you don't need to
[30:00] worry a prince is in control we don't
[30:03] need to fear that somehow this thing's
[30:07] gonna spiral out of control and
[30:09] forensics in forensics DNA evidence will
[30:15] convict a person of a crime based on one
[30:18] in six billion basically out of all the
[30:21] people on the earth the evidence points
[30:24] only to one person that's one in six
[30:27] billion and and that don't even touch a
[30:30] trillion and we're not even going to
[30:32] speak about a thousand trillion or
[30:34] 10,000 trillion or a hundred thousand
[30:35] tree and how about a million trillion
[30:37] and Jesus only fulfilling eight of
[30:39] would hit that heath fulfilled more than
[30:41] 40 I'm here to take something friends
[30:44] let the earth rock and real I've got a
[30:47] prince on the throne I've got one who
[30:50] has who is so overwhelmingly proven to
[30:55] you that I told my wife today I said if
[30:57] I don't accomplish anything else in my
[30:59] Sunday School class we should be able to
[31:02] dispel anxiety over what's happening out
[31:05] there in the world say what's the
[31:07] government gonna do I don't know it
[31:09] don't matter he's in control what's
[31:11] gonna happen to my life tomorrow what
[31:13] about this circumstance and what about
[31:14] that circumstance and I got this and
[31:15] thing and I got that thing he's in
[31:17] control somebody who fulfilled for the
[31:21] Old Testament I mean I don't even know
[31:23] what the number would be to say how
[31:25] could that even happen I'm here to taste
[31:27] something friends he is in control

[31:54] same one who blew a million trillion to
[31:59] one out of the water has made you kings
[32:03] and priests with him brother Branham
[32:06] says when a man or woman is dressed in
[32:08] the full armor of God
[32:09] it ain't power its authority from on
[32:13] high when he says Devils will scream and
[32:16] brakes will squeal squeak even death
