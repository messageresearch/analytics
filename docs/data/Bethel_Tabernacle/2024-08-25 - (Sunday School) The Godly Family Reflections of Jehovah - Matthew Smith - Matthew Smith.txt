========================================

for for for [Music] for [Music] for for [Music] [Music] e e e e this is Genesis chapter 1 verse 27 um says so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them y'all can be seated um so this morning I I titled let me pull up and see what I texted the booth What My Title was um my title for this morning is The Godly family with a subtitle of reflections of Jehova so um I was I Brother JD was out out of town today and he was scheduled so he asked me to cover for him and then so I was I was preparing something very different um for today and then this morning I just got hooked into this um just wouldn't leave me alone so Lord changed my direction um entirely um and I guess you know brother JD's been covering the his family Series so I guess someone needed to hear about the family today um so I I had some a long time ago I had done a study on on just sort of marriage and and the Dynamics of the man and the wife and and how the the a man and a wife coming together in marriage why it's important what it does and and and a lot of just different things about that um and ultimately like I said it is about creating a family and um so this morning I I maybe just want to take a moment and think about why this is important and and you know because it occurred to me all right so you know brother JD's been covering the family and then it just seemed like it hit me out of the blue this is what I need to cover this morning so I'm thinking you know Lord why why is this important and so I'm kind of meditating on this and just some thoughts that came to me is you know here it is that God created man in the beginning um male and female right that that God makes man with male and female to together and then later separates in Genesis chapter 2 um separates the female from the male and and creates a family right and this ultimately when when God made man in his own image what is going to happen with Adam and Eve and what Adam and Eve are and become and do is a pattern of God because if Adam is made in the image of God then we can make some determination about what God is based off of what Adam was so here you have Adam dwelling alone in the garden and it's not good he's lonely he needs he needs another another human to be there so God takes a portion of Adam and makes a helper for him makes a a a companion and these two people um you know that so that man would be alone right because he needed a family God you the man needed a family well this is an indication that God needs a family right we can we can say that God self the self-existing one dwelling alone you know nothing created him the the unmoved Mover sees that he's alone and he that he needs he needs companionship so what does he do he reaches into himself and takes a rib or something and makes Humanity out of that right he makes a church he makes a bride out of himself right and so we so you you you know we can see the pattern here that with Adam and Eve here they are um uh with you know as as um I guess so I guess my my point is with um the reason it's so important to study these things right this to to to really pay attention to what your marriage is doing right I I if if you're if you're married or or looking to get married or whatever your situation may be your relationship with your spouse is going to inform your relationship with God right these two things your family should be patterning itself after the family of God right God's program is the pattern that you're supposed to be patterned off of if your family is if you are in the image of God and your family's in the image of God it's going to look a certain way it's going to be organized a certain way it's going to function a certain kind of way and if it's not functioning that way it means something's out of cater and something about your view and your relationship with God is out of whack because if your relationship with God was right then your marriage would be right right if and if you're and so vice versa if if there's a so if there's a problem with one there's a problem somewhere else so um keep track of my time here um I want to and then furthermore um obviously you know with with a marriage it creates children so many times and with kids we know that what um you know we know that with the the parents are the first version of God that that kid's ever going to see right if you're marriage is not in line with the word of God then you're going to produce effects in those kids that are not it's going to multiply right whatever your marriage problem is is going to end up baked into the psychology of your kids and those kids are going to suffer and they're going to end up with baggage because your marriage wasn't squared away am um you know you great I've seen this happen a lot um in both extremes just as an example you know you take a um a man who's a tyrant right he's he's got a little too much pride and he thinks that he's just the the you know biggest baddest guy in town and he's going to rule his family with an Iron Fist and there's no Grace and there's no anything right there's no no room for error and he's kind of legalistic well what happens is the kids end up with a with a because that's the first version of Jehovah they will ever see so now without consciously thinking about it right without them sitting down and and and doing the math it's just sort of baked into that kid because they were raised in that environment their view of God is going to be one of a tyrant with no Grace and legalistic and there's no room for the flesh whatsoever it you no no room for the grace for the flesh so there's no chance at at walking any sort of Christian life because the first time you stumble and fall and you're just done and worthless and and God's done with you right and so you might as well not even try and there's no there's no Grace for anybody else and there's certainly no Grace for yourself right if that's the if and I've seen that happen with kids where that's the environment they were raised in and that's and so they end up not even trying to be a Christian because there's it's pointless in their mind right because their view of God was directly informed by the view of their parent right by by the by where the man was not operating in accordance to the word of God but then you can go on the other side and you have a dad who's completely just just no backbone will just let anything slide no you know just let things come and go way too overly permissive and so now the view of the kids that the kids end up having going in their view of God is that well anything goes God doesn't really care I can live like the devil and it doesn't matter as long as I come to church and raise my hand and Praise Jesus on Sunday right right and that it's and so what you've done there is now the man has abdicated his responsibility as headship right he's completely completely abandoned his position as being a leader in the home and giving it over to the mom who's you know the the woman in the household so now you have a female headship in the home and it creates in the kids a denominational attitude because think about it right what's a denominational system it's when the church has usurped Authority in the relationship between the church and God Amen right it's the church is putting their own mentality their own ideas over uh you know what what morality and goodness and and the right way to live is and and kind of letting um you know I just read this the other day um Isaiah chapter 30 verse one I'll actually just uh let me pull that up real quick um it says woe to the rebellious children sayith the Lord that take counsel but not of me that cover with a covering but not of my spirit that they may add sin to sin yeah right that this is a denominational attitude that here Adam and Eve are in the garden they sin what do they do they make their own covering a sort of religious covering well I'll just go to church I'll go do some good deeds I'll pay Ms and give some charity but when it comes to actually affecting my my real lifestyle what I do what I crave what I desire what I spend my time on I will not let that be subjugated by the word of God right and so you have the church now taken Authority in the relationship between God and the church that's a denominational attitude amen right and so now you end up with when you have an overly permissive husband who just allows anything to go and lets the woman run the household then you end up with kids who have a view of God that just allows anything to go and that they particular view of what is good and decent and right completely out you know in their own mind outweighs whatever you know they they well you know God God will just let it slide it's because I I love God and it's it's all good in the end right and you know they're completely failing to recognize that this is they're they're living in a in a spiritual fornication you know it there and and you know it's no it's no surprise that in this day and age where you know brother brand call it the woman's age right and and we see it in this I mean if you study history at all whatsoever you a lot of people talk about well women are oppressed today compared to what compared pick a time in history and tell me when it was better um you know and and you know that's not to say that anyways my my point is women have it better off now than they've ever had it um in in a lot of ways it's gone way so far the other direction where it's it's like you know women can can do no wrong and and and there's no there's no accountability there's no check right so so now there's it's it's the woman's age right the prophet said that it would be this way um and again like you know there there's other times in history where it was the other way and and not to not to say that it's you know Justified to to abuse women but my my point simply is that when you get to a point where women have totally taken control that now you know the the household the typical American household is so heavily controlled everything is the the the idea the culture completely humiliates the idea of of a strong man right that that you know you any any kind of mainstream depiction of a of a nuclear family shows the the man as a bumbling idiot at best and and the woman as sort of this this smart intellig person who's really running the show um and so they've completely degraded and and and and um mocked the idea of of male leadership to the point that it's almost laughable that that a man would be the head of the household and it's not a coincidence that in that environment we also see the rise that it would be this day of all days in this age that the the prophet for our our day like his one of his fundamental primary things that he came to tell people was that it would be this day above all other days above all other ages that the church would take Supreme political Authority that's the culmination of this age that a World Council of churches will rule the world that all po iCal power will be subsumed by a religious system that history of the world that a church would have supreme authority over the entire planet so when he says that it's a woman's age it's more than just social standing in women it's also the fact that the church which is a type of a woman is going to take supreme authority and and the whole world will do it willingly and gladly and and think it's a beautiful wonderful thing when they do it why because they want a covering right they they want counsel for their lives but not God's counsel they want a covering but not God's covering right because every human instinctively knows that your sin needs a covering right that's why Adam and Eve instinctively made coverings when they failed but it's not God's covering it's not God's covering you know it's not the not the blood of a lamb it's a it's a man-made construct that that can ease our conscience and make us feel less um you know less ashamed of what we've done um I have completely derailed off of the family um uh but but this is but so this is this is the this is the the result that we we have when when headship is not in its place right when when the man is not in it in in his place when the woman's not in his place and when it's everything's functioning functioning correctly and everything's functioning the way it's supposed to and it's after the pattern of God's word then it's beautiful and you end up with with healthy children and and and good relationships with God and you end up with with uh you know all this dysfunction that we see in the world is a direct result of again the family not patterning itself a in in the way that God intended it to to function um I do want to actually get to my notes at some point um we'll go to Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 21 says um submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleans it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious Church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife love himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined unto his his wife and they two shall be one flesh so um just kind of um you know it's this is a very common scripture read anytime you're talking about marriage and family and you know uh headship and all that stuff um the the what I what I thing that I I really want want to point a point that I want to make I've got five minutes left um is that you know this scripture is often thrown out as wives submit yourselves to your husbands right that's the first part of the the passage and that is true you know you submit yourselves even as Christ uh is as a church under Christ you know and and again so if if you have a wife not submitting herself to her husband then it's an indication that there's a problem there because it's it's there's no submission into to the word either right and likewise but but there's the other side of it as well which is that the you only get that you only get the submission of the wife to the man if the man loves her the way Christ loved the church right you don't get one without the other and if you try to have one without the other then you end up with an imbalance and you end up with Calamity and you end up with a broken home right something dysfunctional and evil um and so I you know we can a lot of times people will take one angle or the other and and they'll go you know uh beat the women into submission or they'll take the men and beat them into submission um really what I think that would behoove us all is to recognize that this is a this is a partnership at the end of the day we we are married because we want to love each other right we this this isn't winning it's not a team sport right you're not it's not it's not a a uh uh you know when God made man and he he had man and then he separated Eve from Adam he had to do it that way because now there was they were from the same flesh right so there's immediate connection there they they're drawn to each other there's already connection right so they can finish each other's sentences and yet because she has feminine nature and he has none of that therefore she can do things that he can't she can see things that he can't you know they can they can connect they can intuitively communicate and yet she can say stuff that he'll never it'll never occur to him right like you know we should turn the temperature down when we're trying to sleep at night it would never occur to a man to do that um and yet my wife does all the time um and it doesn't occur to me to do that I'm making a joke but the point is women do that the women will know things intuitively about a situation that a man will completely Miss and because she's got wiring that he doesn't have she he has she has like extra senses that he's completely oblivious to and likewise the way a man thinks a woman will never get her head around that half the time because they need each other God made them to to need each other to not be able to function without each other so they're tied together and can't leave because you know humans would if we could half the time and so because it's a it's a team effort it's it's both parties putting in in 100% then we end up you know then you can have a situation where it's you know you can have the balance that the that Ephesians is trying to produce that the the man the the wife is submitting herself to the husband and she's she's following the example you know like brother JD's been hitting a lot lately with and fair no no criticism there it needs to be said listen the man is the head of the home when he says he his word supersedes everything but that's because he's the one making the sacrifice right he's the one who if he's in the position of Christ that means that he has to do what Christ did which is of his own valtion go give his life for her and that doesn't just mean like dying that means giving your whole life for somebody everything that you wanted all your dreams and hopes and Ambitions are now subject to making sure that that your wife is taken care of right everything that you want goes to the side because your family comes first right that is the sacrifice of Christ and if it's not if that's if if you're putting your entertainment and Sport and whatever you you if the man is putting him his own desires ahead of the needs of his family then he is not being Christ in his family you know if if nothing wrong with anything in particular but when a man makes his whole life about something that's not his family the family's going to suffer and he's going to answer for that there's going to be a price to be paid and likewise you know when when the wife doesn't submit to that because at the end of the day the man's responsible for everything that happens right if the if the man is the head and the wife is the body right as as as the Bible says then you know in the Bible when when say you know if a if a man murders another man the Bible always the phrasing is always the the murdered man's blood is on his head it wasn't the head that stabbed the man it was the hand right what the hand does the head is responsible for okay what the wife does the husband is responsible for right you with the what the body what your family is doing or not doing the husband is the ultimate the the the man of the house of the ultimate Authority there god holds him accountable that's why he also has the final say it's not fair to give him all the the the responsibility but none of the Authority right and so this is this is the kind of dynamic and when it's working properly and it's working in accordance to the word of God then we get something beautiful that everyone is ultimately happy with which we will have to talk about at a later date because I'm out of time so let's stand and have a quick word of prayer father Lord I hope that something I've said would be a help that someone could take something away from this that wouldn't just simply be a a nice thought but Lord that it would be uh edifying that it would help them draw closer to you and to see you and in everything that they do lord it's our desire that you would take total control of everything that we do all of our relationships and our and our families and everything that we would patter ourselves after you and and your perfect pattern we ask that You' be with through through the remainder of the service be with us in the song service that we'd be able to open our hearts to you and we be able to worship and create an environment in which you'd be pleased to dwell in ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen e [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
