[31:45] look right to saint john chapter 3.
[31:48] we've got a number of prayer requests
[31:50] that i'm going to go to that's probably
[31:51] a little too much monitor for me brother
[31:53] matt
[31:54] um
[31:55] i'm going to
[31:56] take a number of prayer requests
[31:59] this morning
[32:01] and things that came in right as i was
[32:04] in the back and on the way
[32:06] just want to have some special prayer
[32:08] for them let's let's read our
[32:11] our scripture let me let me say before
[32:13] we read it because once i read it then i
[32:15] don't want to back out
[32:17] um
[32:18] as you can see we're underway
[32:22] with the painting and so i sent out a
[32:24] message today to please make sure you
[32:27] keep
[32:28] kids and anyone i actually i don't even
[32:30] want adults back there because if adults
[32:32] go back there teens will follow you and
[32:34] if teens go back there kids will follow
[32:36] them
[32:37] so there's
[32:38] there's debris nails screws things like
[32:41] that there's paint
[32:43] and i've had too many accidents on
[32:45] painting jobs where five gallons of
[32:47] paint gets turned over on concrete and
[32:48] it's a nightmare
[32:50] so just please avoid the back of the
[32:52] property you don't need to go back there
[32:54] and fact is we're not going to be able
[32:56] to open the fellowship hall this
[32:58] afternoon
[33:00] there's some there's some painting crew
[33:01] that i'm working with that i uh hired to
[33:04] come out and help me uh and jonathan on
[33:06] the painting they're working on the
[33:07] fellowship hall exclusively they may
[33:09] come here
[33:10] in the early afternoon so i told them i
[33:12] would keep it closed and the ground
[33:15] should probably be cleared somewhere
[33:16] around two o'clock depending on how long
[33:18] the preacher goes
[33:20] but
[33:22] so just make sure that you you don't go
[33:24] back there and please
[33:26] bear with us we're still working
[33:29] um this is still a work in progress
[33:32] um there's a one wall here painted you
[33:35] can't even look at this and tell it's
[33:38] what it's going to look like when it's
[33:40] finished
[33:41] so i know everybody in here is going to
[33:42] have an opinion because you're human
[33:44] beings please let me get it finished
[33:47] and i have a vision in my mind how it's
[33:49] going to look i know exactly what how i
[33:51] want it to look and i'm taking counsel
[33:54] from
[33:55] um
[33:56] from my wife my daughter-in-law and
[33:57] other different ones who are helping me
[33:59] to make some of these decisions but
[34:01] i have an exact vision how i want it to
[34:03] look
[34:04] and i'll get there amen hopefully by the
[34:06] will of the lord i'll be able to come

[42:31] commit it to you in jesus name amen amen
[42:35] all right you can be seated friends
[42:36] we're going to continue reading
[42:39] verse 4.
[42:42] nicodemus saith unto him
[42:44] how can a man be born
[42:47] when he is old
[42:49] can he enter the second time into his
[42:52] mother's womb and be born
[42:54] jesus answered
[42:56] verily verily i say unto thee
[43:00] except a man be born of water and of the
[43:02] spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[43:05] of god
[43:06] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[43:09] and that which is born of the spirit is
[43:12] spirit
[43:13] marvel not that i said unto you you must
[43:15] be born again the wind bloweth whether
[43:18] where it listeth and thou hearest the
[43:20] sound thereof but thou canst not tell
[43:22] whence it cometh and whether it goeth so
[43:24] is everyone that is born of the spirit
[43:27] nicodemus answered and said unto him how
[43:30] can these things be
[43:32] jesus answered and said unto him art
[43:34] thou a master in israel a teacher
[43:37] and know us not these things verily
[43:40] verily or truly truly i say unto thee
[43:44] we speak that we do know and testify
[43:48] that we have seen and ye receive not our
[43:50] witness if i have told you earthly
[43:53] things and you believe not how shall ye
[43:56] believe if i tell you of heavenly things
[43:59] and no man hath ascended up to heaven
[44:02] but he
[44:04] that came down from heaven even the son
[44:06] of man which is in heaven that's a
[44:09] mind-bender yeah amen that that blew all
[44:12] their minds
[44:13] all right
[44:14] this gets reported
[44:16] there there these kinds of stories get
[44:18] told and repeated publicly
[44:20] and this along with
[44:22] when you're going to hear brother
[44:24] branham deal with it in a minute where
[44:26] they heard him say things like this they
[44:28] heard that he had said this they heard
[44:30] him say
[44:31] except you eat my flesh and drink my
[44:33] blood and all of these things you know
[44:35] he didn't he didn't fully explain
[44:38] everything all the time all right and so
[44:41] people had uh had to overcome a lot of
[44:43] these five senses
[44:46] to believe by the sixth sense and i'm
[44:48] here today friends you're in a
[44:49] challenging hour where you're going to
[44:51] have to
[44:52] you're going to have to unsee to see
[44:55] some things
[44:56] all right so you're going to have to
[44:58] ignore a lot of times what these eyes
[45:00] see in these ears here and these senses
[45:02] feel you know or or or what your mind or
[45:05] your emotions tell you and you're going
[45:08] to have to look beyond it to something
[45:09] more real
[45:12] and that's a promise of god a promise of
[45:14] god is more tangible than what you see
[45:18] a promise of god is more tangible than
[45:20] the earth you stand on
[45:22] because the earth you stand on is just a
[45:24] shadow it's just a negative image
[45:27] of a more positive
[45:29] now that's hard for us to get around
[45:30] because we we walk around on the terra
[45:33] firma
[45:34] you know i this is real man i can feel
[45:36] this is solid this is a shadow amen
[45:39] see what's in that realm is more
[45:43] more real
[45:44] you say well how can that be because it
[45:46] was before this realm
[45:48] it was original it was first you
[45:50] understand and so even god's thoughts
[45:53] thank you for the bread even god's
[45:55] thoughts
[45:56] are more real his thoughts are more real
[46:00] than your existence
[46:03] amen
[46:04] all right so now so now when we when we
[46:07] look at these things
[46:09] we're we're seeing how that
[46:12] he says here
[46:13] verse 15.
[46:15] all right let's go back to i'm sorry uh
[46:17] verse
[46:19] verse 13 again and no man hath ascended
[46:22] up to heaven
[46:24] but he that came down from heaven
[46:26] even the son of man which is in heaven
[46:29] that's a head scratcher because how's he
[46:31] in heaven but he's standing in front of
[46:33] me
[46:33] all right
[46:35] and as moses lifted up the serpent in
[46:38] the wilderness
[46:39] even so must the son of man be lifted up
[46:42] that whosoever believeth in him should
[46:44] not perish but have eternal life for god
[46:47] so loved the world that he gave his only
[46:50] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[46:53] him should not perish but have
[46:56] everlasting life it doesn't mean that
[46:58] everybody's going to not perish and have
[47:00] everlasting life it means that whosoever
[47:02] believeth in him
[47:04] and it doesn't mean
[47:06] this this verse
[47:08] isn't telling you that anyone will
[47:12] it's not telling you who will or even
[47:14] that anyone will it's just saying
[47:16] whosoever will
[47:18] whoever does believe
[47:21] will be have everlasting life you say
[47:23] well then the next obvious question is
[47:25] who's going to believe well the bible
[47:27] answers that in acts 13 them that were
[47:30] ordained believed
[47:33] all right so you're not going to get
[47:34] around the sovereignty of god no matter
[47:37] what you do you're not going to come up
[47:39] with your
[47:40] human inferior will and think that's
[47:43] going to trump his will you think he
[47:45] doesn't have a will people say oh i got
[47:47] my free will what do you think so that
[47:49] means god don't have one
[47:51] and who do you who you think is going to
[47:53] win
[47:54] yours or his
[47:56] so
[47:57] so we find that he says here
[48:00] verse 17 for god sent not his son into
[48:03] the world to condemn the world but that
[48:06] the world
[48:07] through him might be saved he that
[48:09] believeth on him is not condemned but he
[48:13] that believeth not is condemned already
[48:15] because he hath not believed in the name
[48:18] of the only begotten son of god
[48:20] all right and this is the condemnation
[48:23] that light is come into the world and
[48:26] here it is
[48:27] men loved darkness
[48:30] rather than light doesn't say god forced
[48:32] them to do that or god tricked them into
[48:34] that or god entrapped them to do that
[48:36] they made a choice they loved it they
[48:39] had an opportunity as every man must get
[48:41] and they chose to stay with what they
[48:44] had which was a fallen condition and
[48:46] they enjoyed the pleasures of sin for a
[48:49] season and forsook the joys of the lord
[48:52] in eternity
[48:53] right now watch
[48:55] so
[48:56] verse 19 and this is the condemnation
[48:59] that light has come into the world and
[49:00] men love darkness rather than light
[49:02] because their deeds were evil for every
[49:04] one that doeth evil hateth the light
[49:07] neither cometh to the light lest his
[49:10] deeds should be reproved that's how
[49:14] i
[49:14] know
[49:15] i'm of god
[49:18] because i make mistakes and i regret
[49:21] them
[49:22] and i come to god to have them removed
[49:26] amen
[49:27] that's how i know my heart is turned see
[49:30] that's how i know i don't love the
[49:32] things of this world if i did why would
[49:34] i repent of them
[49:35] see my flesh gets weak my flesh stumbles
[49:38] but that takes me to my knees see i
[49:42] can't live there because i pass from
[49:44] death unto life and my nature has
[49:46] changed
[49:47] all right
[49:48] so and he but he verse 21 but he that
[49:52] doeth truth cometh to the light that his
[49:55] deeds may be made manifest that they are
[49:58] wrought in god all right now
[50:02] we'll go to my to my powerpoint please
[50:05] brothers and we'll put that up and i i'm
[50:08] going to just give you a bible lesson
[50:10] today
[50:11] that's been on my heart for more than a
[50:14] week actually and uh started piecing
[50:16] some of this together some weeks ago and
[50:19] i don't know if i've
[50:21] made some of these points
[50:23] i i i preach so often i'm on bible study
[50:26] every morning and i'm here twice a week
[50:28] and i never know what i said where so if
[50:31] i repeat something you just hear it
[50:33] again the lord knew you need to hear it
[50:34] again
[50:35] so
[50:36] i love i'm titling this sermon today
[50:39] seeing
[50:40] the unseen
[50:43] are you going to am i going to run it
[50:45] from here i guess
[50:46] so this is good
[50:49] all right
[50:51] so seeing
[50:53] the unseen
[50:55] and i want to take for subtitle
[50:58] unseeing
[50:59] to see
[51:00] all right unseeing to see that's a very
[51:04] important
[51:06] almost my subtitle if you don't get that
[51:09] you're not going to really benefit from
[51:11] the title
[51:12] all right but i'm going to present to
[51:14] you today a very strange
[51:17] thought
[51:18] that many times you're first going to
[51:21] have to unsee
[51:23] to see
[51:24] when people are formally indoctrinated
[51:27] the first thing you got to get them to
[51:28] do is unsee all of that
[51:30] see that's paul had to unsee everything
[51:34] he ever thought was right paul said i i
[51:38] forgot i unseen all that i knew
[51:41] to know christ
[51:43] i had to unsee i had to unhear i had to
[51:46] unlearn that because it was all
[51:49] erroneous and wrong and i i had you know
[51:52] if i wanted to see god for real just
[51:55] like when the
[51:57] when the
[51:59] greeks
[52:00] who love knowledge love it those guys
[52:03] love knowledge
[52:04] and they came to see jesus
[52:07] and they come to philip and sir we would
[52:10] see jesus and philip telleth andrew and
[52:12] andrew takes them to jesus lord these
[52:14] men want to see you
[52:16] and you would think that common courtesy
[52:19] jesus would have got up and stepped
[52:21] across and shook their hand hello i'm
[52:22] jesus of nazareth good to meet you how
[52:24] can i help you what are you what are you
[52:26] here for but it's almost like
[52:29] jesus immediately
[52:30] was just like in another realm
[52:33] and he starts with this weird parable
[52:36] about except a corner of wheat die to
[52:38] bite us alone
[52:40] lord these men want to see you oh they
[52:42] do
[52:43] except the corn of wheat diet bideth
[52:45] alone
[52:49] okay did you get that yeah i think i got
[52:50] it what does he mean i have no idea
[52:53] [Laughter]
[52:56] and so you know there's no business
[52:58] cards exchanged there there's no they're
[53:01] they're not ex they're not doing
[53:02] linkedin
[53:04] so
[53:05] so you find that jesus goes into this
[53:07] parable to begin to explain
[53:10] what nicodemus also struggled with that
[53:13] listen i know you think you see me
[53:17] and your eyes do see me
[53:19] photons are striking your pupils and the
[53:22] brain is turning that into image
[53:24] but but unless you join me in death
[53:27] burial and resurrection you will never
[53:29] see me
[53:31] you can't really see me you can see me
[53:32] but you can't really see me you get it
[53:35] and so so
[53:37] it's it's it's interesting that uh so
[53:40] i'm saying all this to get your mind
[53:42] focused on this thought today
[53:44] so
[53:45] first i want to look at this scripture
[53:47] in revelation 6. now this is the the
[53:50] scripture concerning the seals and i i
[53:53] don't want to get sidetracked in that or
[53:55] boy i'll really burn up all my time
[53:56] going down a rabbit trail with that i
[53:58] just want to focus on one particular
[54:01] line here
[54:02] that and i saw when the lamb had opened
[54:05] one of the seals and i heard as it were
[54:08] the noise of thunder
[54:10] one of the four beasts saying so now
[54:13] catch it
[54:14] the the four the
[54:16] when one of the four beasts
[54:18] spoke it sounded like thunder
[54:22] you get me so he he hears the noise uh
[54:26] of a thunder and it's actually one of
[54:30] the four living creatures
[54:32] saying
[54:33] come and see
[54:35] so
[54:36] and then then it's gonna say that same
[54:38] thing in the second seal
[54:40] the same thing in the third seal and the
[54:42] same thing i jumped to the fourth just
[54:44] to cut to the chase
[54:46] and when he had opened the fourth seal
[54:48] now that's our age we're living in the
[54:50] fourth seal under the mysteries opened
[54:54] under the seventh seal
[54:56] remember
[54:57] the the don't think of the seventh seal
[55:00] as some object the
[55:02] it's a seal
[55:04] that
[55:05] that had a mystery locked inside it and
[55:08] that mystery was the was the mighty god
[55:12] understand
[55:13] and the world had lost the understanding
[55:16] of who the mighty god was fully in the
[55:18] ages brother branham said irenaeus was
[55:20] the last one to have a full
[55:22] understanding of the mystery of the
[55:25] godhead that's why right after that in
[55:27] the fourth age
[55:29] at the end of the age which is when the
[55:31] messenger comes going into the fourth
[55:33] ages says you've not denied my name
[55:35] because and that's the last time
[55:37] you're going to hear the name mentioned
[55:39] until hundreds and hundreds of years
[55:41] later in the philadelphian age
[55:44] when he comes and and he's going to now
[55:46] restore the name because an open door is
[55:49] set at the end of the age which would be
[55:52] the beginnings of the restoration of
[55:55] understanding that jesus and god are the
[55:57] same person
[55:59] he's not a third person now that was
[56:01] only the beginning and that set there
[56:03] after wesley was gone because wesley
[56:05] died a trinitarian this was the
[56:07] beginning of the jesus name jesus only
[56:10] movement amen it even actually proceeded
[56:12] just a little bit before the azusa
[56:14] revival and went into the azusa revival
[56:17] and that's why brother branham would say
[56:19] laodicea properly as an age is really
[56:22] almost an extension of philadelphia
[56:24] because it's in philadelphia where he
[56:26] began to restore the mystery of who god
[56:29] is
[56:30] now all they saw
[56:32] was
[56:33] jesus only
[56:35] and because the seventh seal had not
[56:37] been broken that that unveiled all of
[56:40] the mystery that had been hidden
[56:42] amen they had it in the early age but
[56:45] that age backslid amen
[56:48] and so instead of jesus being able to
[56:50] come for his bride he must sit back down
[56:53] now seal the mystery under seven seals
[56:56] intercede for the ignorance of the
[56:58] churches through seven ages
[57:00] amanda's elementary
[57:02] if you're a believer but at the end time
[57:04] it shall be light in the evening time
[57:07] when he would send forth a messenger who
[57:10] would ironically be the same seventh
[57:13] angel to laodicea
[57:15] who had all the understanding of
[57:17] laodicea that's why he could preach the
[57:18] church ages even before the seals under
[57:20] inspiration but when the seals come that
[57:23] messenger can't open them only the lamb
[57:26] can open them
[57:27] but he's got that messenger in the earth
[57:29] so that when the lamb opens it he brings
[57:32] it to the messenger and the messenger
[57:33] gives it to you and you see yourself in
[57:36] the book
[57:37] because that's the mighty god unveiled
[57:41] see
[57:42] so the trinitarians in their formula
[57:44] they've got him in three persons the
[57:46] oneness in their formula doesn't include
[57:49] his body
[57:50] the seventh seal revealed that
[57:53] christ was the mystery of god revealed
[57:56] and now the bride his body is the
[57:58] mystery of christ revealed it's just a
[57:59] continual a continual unfolding
[58:02] that's why you're the final voice of the
[58:04] final age that's why you have to eat the
[58:06] book
[58:07] because you must prophesy not you don't
[58:09] got to get up in a pulpit like me or be
[58:11] a prophet like brother branham but your
[58:13] life has to be a living testimony to the
[58:15] world
[58:16] that's why you're here without that you
[58:20] have little purpose
[58:23] amen
[58:24] say that's a pretty bold statement
[58:26] you're saying people that are not born
[58:27] again have almost no purpose that's
[58:29] right
[58:30] did you know they're not even living yet
[58:32] brother brown said until you're born
[58:34] again you're not even living only when
[58:35] you're born again you finally are living
[58:38] when you're before you're born again
[58:39] you're only dying
[58:42] you're born and you're aging out
[58:45] and you're burning your candle and
[58:47] you're going to die but once you're born
[58:49] again jesus said you will never die
[58:53] see
[58:54] so so we find that when god unlocked the
[58:57] mystery of the of the seals he was
[59:00] unveiling himself
[59:02] amen to the bride so that
[59:05] so that
[59:06] as jesus
[59:08] was the walking living breathing
[59:11] manifestation of god
[59:14] amen
[59:15] now your job is to be the walking
[59:17] breathing living manifestation of christ
[59:21] amen
[59:22] because we're headed to a day when the
[59:25] kingdoms of this world will become the
[59:28] kingdoms of our lord
[59:30] and his christ that's not to lord's
[59:32] doctrine that's jesus and his bride
[59:35] christ and his bride all right so so we
[59:39] find then that when he says
[59:41] come and see
[59:44] remember friends
[59:46] these are the same cherubs
[59:49] these four living creatures
[59:51] are the same cherubs remember when they
[59:53] fell in the garden of eden and god put
[59:56] angels
[59:57] with flaming swords to drive them away
[1:00:00] from the tree of life and drove them out
[1:00:02] of the garden of eden
[1:00:03] this is those same living creatures
[1:00:06] these are the same living creatures that
[1:00:08] guarded the way you see it in matthew
[1:00:11] mark luke and john they're guarding the
[1:00:12] gospels are guarding the mystery of god
[1:00:15] and and that's why that's why it's got
[1:00:17] to be every word line upon line line
[1:00:20] upon line see and then the apostles and
[1:00:22] prophets are to continue on but they've
[1:00:24] got to preach according to what jesus
[1:00:27] taught and then you become obligated to
[1:00:30] receive the words of christ and the
[1:00:32] words of the apostles and prophets
[1:00:34] because it's god working in harmony you
[1:00:36] understand
[1:00:38] and so so we we're finding then that
[1:00:41] that these are the same exact living
[1:00:44] creatures
[1:00:45] who were come and see
[1:00:48] at one time it was stay back i'll cut
[1:00:51] you
[1:00:52] amen i got a flaming sword i will wipe
[1:00:54] you out if you try to approach
[1:00:57] but now brother branham said these same
[1:00:59] angels are now trying to drive you back
[1:01:02] to the tree of life
[1:01:04] come and see is the angels driving you
[1:01:07] back to the to the tree of life
[1:01:10] [Applause]
[1:01:12] i'm going to tell you something friends
[1:01:13] that is that is a jubilee
[1:01:15] that is so glorious and god has allowed
[1:01:18] you to be a part of it
[1:01:21] to be to understand these deep things of
[1:01:23] god that
[1:01:25] the bible says great sages and men of
[1:01:27] old and even angels desired to look into
[1:01:30] these things and couldn't see it god
[1:01:32] having something better for you and i at
[1:01:34] the last day
[1:01:36] see so here we are
[1:01:38] we've been given a commission come and
[1:01:40] see
[1:01:41] and i'm going to tell you if you're
[1:01:43] going to see christ properly you're
[1:01:45] going to have to do some unseeing first
[1:01:48] yes
[1:01:50] you're going to have to now i don't just
[1:01:52] mean and that's an important point
[1:01:54] i don't just mean unsee like lose your
[1:01:56] former doctrine because some of you been
[1:01:58] raised in in this some of you been under
[1:02:01] my ministry for decades i'm not here to
[1:02:02] tell you you got to unsee all that now
[1:02:05] i'm not talking about doctrine that's
[1:02:06] one
[1:02:07] element of it but now here's something
[1:02:09] you're going to have to unsee you're
[1:02:11] going to have to unsee the
[1:02:13] the collapsing of the world if you're
[1:02:15] going to have faith
[1:02:18] if you can't unsee it you're going to
[1:02:19] live in fear
[1:02:21] amen amen when you see what all is going
[1:02:24] on in politics when you see what i was
[1:02:26] going on in religion and you see what i
[1:02:28] was going on in demon powers because
[1:02:29] that's a trifecta
[1:02:31] a trinity of political religious and
[1:02:33] demon powers say do you all this this
[1:02:36] this this pandemic this was just a plan
[1:02:38] gimmick it's a pandemonic
[1:02:41] i don't i don't care who planned what
[1:02:43] when how or where it's all listen don't
[1:02:45] lose sight of this god's in control
[1:02:48] god is in control and if you run in fear
[1:02:51] from this if you can't handle the
[1:02:53] footman how are you going to run with
[1:02:55] the horseman
[1:02:57] i'm here to tell you something friends
[1:02:58] don't be fearing these footmen but it's
[1:03:00] going to get worse the horsemen are
[1:03:02] coming and i'm here to tell you it's
[1:03:04] time now that we cast down fear and
[1:03:07] imagination and stand on the word of god
[1:03:09] you say but people are dying only
[1:03:12] because god allows it but even god's
[1:03:14] family are passing away only because
[1:03:16] their time was up
[1:03:18] the devil can't kill god's family
[1:03:22] he can't do anything to god's family
[1:03:26] except by permission
[1:03:28] these things are in the hand of almighty
[1:03:30] god i might die from i might die from a
[1:03:33] pandemic tomorrow i might get hit by a
[1:03:35] bus tomorrow
[1:03:38] you understand but at my as david said
[1:03:41] my times are in his hands
[1:03:45] so you know what we do we operate with
[1:03:47] prudence
[1:03:48] because we're commanded to read the song
[1:03:51] of solomon read the book of proverbs
[1:03:53] don't tell me prudence isn't a major
[1:03:55] factor in our lives
[1:03:57] but we don't operate in fear
[1:04:00] see
[1:04:01] we will be prudent we have been we will
[1:04:03] continue to be we will do what's prudent
[1:04:06] but we're not going to run in fear
[1:04:08] because it's not going to get better
[1:04:10] amen so come and see you're going to
[1:04:13] have to see past sometimes if you're
[1:04:16] sick today you need to unsee symptoms
[1:04:22] if you got a dilemma in your life if if
[1:04:25] you've got wayward teenagers you're
[1:04:26] gonna have to unsee that
[1:04:28] you're gonna have to believe a promise
[1:04:30] of god if you got something you need in
[1:04:32] your life or your home or your family or
[1:04:34] your marriage stop looking at the
[1:04:36] circumstance
[1:04:39] look to the promise
[1:04:42] see
[1:04:44] so
[1:04:45] so then he goes on here
[1:04:48] i keep up with myself
[1:04:50] or i'll get sidetracked and this is this
[1:04:52] is a really organized sermon more more
[1:04:54] so than normal so i'm trying to be
[1:04:55] studious second corinthians 3 18 here's
[1:04:58] another one
[1:05:00] but we all
[1:05:02] with open face
[1:05:03] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[1:05:06] lord let me read that i'm breaking it up
[1:05:08] let's read it more with more flow
[1:05:11] but we all with open face beholding as
[1:05:13] in a glass the glory of the lord
[1:05:16] are changed into the same image
[1:05:20] from glory to glory
[1:05:22] even as by the spirit of the lord so
[1:05:24] what we're finding is that is that what
[1:05:29] you're transformed into what you gaze at
[1:05:34] that's why if you gaze on the wrong
[1:05:35] thing if you're if you're gazing at too
[1:05:38] much hollywood you're going to start
[1:05:39] looking like that
[1:05:42] if if if your mindset is the is the
[1:05:45] career path and success at any cost when
[1:05:48] god never called one of us to be
[1:05:50] successful he called us to be faithful
[1:05:53] amen and people have traded being
[1:05:56] faithful for success
[1:05:58] and that never ends well for a child of
[1:06:00] god you go ahead and do it but you're
[1:06:01] going to take a beating for it
[1:06:03] because god loves you too much to let
[1:06:05] you get by with that trust me
[1:06:08] and so so we find that that
[1:06:11] that that we're looking
[1:06:14] and becoming yeah now that's a critical
[1:06:17] juncture i can't even move on in my
[1:06:19] notes until i know you've got that
[1:06:23] looking is becoming
[1:06:25] what you gaze at you're transformed into
[1:06:29] so now come back to what i said you need
[1:06:32] to unsee some stuff let me say it this
[1:06:34] way you need to ungaze
[1:06:37] you need to turn your eyes upon jesus
[1:06:40] look full in his wonderful face
[1:06:43] and the things of this world that ran
[1:06:46] you around and merry-go-round and never
[1:06:47] give you peace and rest
[1:06:50] will grow strangely dim
[1:06:52] in the light of his glory and grace see
[1:06:56] so
[1:06:57] if you think about these these examples
[1:06:59] in the scripture we can i want to think
[1:07:01] of a few
[1:07:03] uh i love how brother branham this is
[1:07:04] william branham stop preaching right
[1:07:06] here because
[1:07:07] brother branham would make his points
[1:07:09] and then he'd go back and show you bible
[1:07:11] examples and i'm just going to give you
[1:07:12] four five that you're very familiar with
[1:07:14] we go back to elijah
[1:07:16] and
[1:07:18] and elisha following elijah and it's a
[1:07:21] it's a type of christ in the bride it's
[1:07:22] a there there's a type there of our
[1:07:24] elijah and us continuing his ministry
[1:07:26] onto the coming of the lord brother
[1:07:28] branham said i wanna i wanna see these
[1:07:30] young men here take the message and
[1:07:32] carry it on to the coming of the lord i
[1:07:34] just say i'll i'll do that
[1:07:37] i volunteer amen i hear both my hands
[1:07:39] lord amen amen so so that that that's
[1:07:42] why brother jd is is overseas right now
[1:07:46] that's why brother matt and i brother jd
[1:07:48] brother caleb that's why we that's why
[1:07:50] we're preaching because we're carrying
[1:07:53] on to the coming of the lord and we want
[1:07:56] you to go with us
[1:07:59] so don't get mad at us if we have to say
[1:08:01] things that hurt your feelings because
[1:08:03] we want you to come with us
[1:08:05] amen
[1:08:06] so so we find that elijah
[1:08:10] says you know what is it that you want
[1:08:12] from me and elisha reveals his whole
[1:08:15] heart he wants to have that same thing
[1:08:17] that's on elijah upon him i want to
[1:08:20] carry on after you're gone i want this
[1:08:22] same ministry i want it doubled to me
[1:08:25] all right and so so i so now elijah says
[1:08:30] two things and i think i mentioned this
[1:08:32] here last time but one of the things
[1:08:34] that elijah says to him
[1:08:37] is you've asked a hard thing
[1:08:39] but now it's not like
[1:08:42] you've asked a hard thing like it's
[1:08:43] going to be hard you're going to lift a
[1:08:44] rock that weighs 400 pounds is going to
[1:08:46] be hard
[1:08:47] it's not that kind of a hard thing it's
[1:08:50] that it's a harder way
[1:08:52] you've asked for a harder life
[1:08:55] you've asked for the narrow way
[1:08:57] you've had the narrow way in the greek
[1:08:59] means the grinding way
[1:09:01] so elijah elisha understand elisha
[1:09:05] don't put your hand to this plow now i
[1:09:07] know you had your hand on a plow and i
[1:09:09] came and put my cloak on you and said
[1:09:10] follow me and you did
[1:09:12] but now someday the messiah's gonna
[1:09:14] stand on the earth and he's gonna say
[1:09:17] this plow whoever puts his hand to this
[1:09:20] plow and takes it off that's a really
[1:09:23] bad position to be in so think elisha i
[1:09:27] want you to think about this
[1:09:29] what you're asking is a harder way
[1:09:31] you're not going to be popular
[1:09:35] you're going to struggle harder than
[1:09:36] everybody else has to because
[1:09:38] satan hates your guts
[1:09:40] he's the god of economics he's never
[1:09:42] going to let it work for you smoothly
[1:09:44] he's always going to be jabbing at your
[1:09:45] finances he's always going to be trying
[1:09:47] to make you sick he's always going to be
[1:09:49] trying to eliminate you he's always
[1:09:51] going to be trying to discourage you and
[1:09:52] depress you
[1:09:54] i'm going to tell you something friends
[1:09:56] you know
[1:09:57] between i i'm here to to battle the
[1:10:00] devil i i see myself as a warrior
[1:10:04] against him and i don't want to see both
[1:10:06] of us can't be happy
[1:10:09] i don't ever that's it's i mean let me
[1:10:11] tell you something friends it's mutually
[1:10:13] exclusive we can't both be happy at the
[1:10:15] same time one of us is going to be
[1:10:17] unhappy i'd rather it be him
[1:10:19] one of us is going to be depressed i
[1:10:20] don't want it to be me one of us is
[1:10:22] going to have anxiety one of us is going
[1:10:23] to have stress i'd rather it be him not
[1:10:26] me
[1:10:28] amen if somebody's going to be stressed
[1:10:30] out let it be me making him stressed out
[1:10:32] if somebody's going to be afraid let it
[1:10:34] be me making him afraid if somebody's
[1:10:37] going to be depressed or unhappy let it
[1:10:39] be the enemy not me
[1:10:42] amen not here to sign a treaty with him
[1:10:45] or not looking for you know
[1:10:48] the you know it's not that both can't be
[1:10:50] true at the same time
[1:10:53] either you're depressed or he is
[1:10:56] either you're stressed out or he is
[1:10:59] either you're afraid or he is
[1:11:01] either you're happy unhappy or he
[1:11:04] if you're unhappy he's happy
[1:11:07] you're not both happy at the same time
[1:11:09] amen if you if you're both happy at the
[1:11:12] same time it's because he's got you
[1:11:13] tricked and fooled into thinking you're
[1:11:16] okay when he actually knows you're not
[1:11:19] amen
[1:11:21] amen
[1:11:22] see
[1:11:23] so so he says to elisha
[1:11:26] listen this is not going to make you
[1:11:28] popular do you understand the queen
[1:11:30] hates me he's trying to kill me you
[1:11:31] understand that elisha you understand
[1:11:34] that ministerial school over there that
[1:11:36] school of prophets they don't like me
[1:11:39] you understand elijah i want you to get
[1:11:41] it you're not going to be socially
[1:11:43] attractive if you're a believer
[1:11:47] you're not going to have smooth sailing
[1:11:49] the the powers that be in the world are
[1:11:52] never going to let you be on the end if
[1:11:54] you're following me
[1:11:57] so think it through elisha think it
[1:12:00] through strong because once you put your
[1:12:02] hand to this plow son don't take it off
[1:12:05] that's a really bad thing if you do that
[1:12:08] see
[1:12:09] and the and of course the other thing is
[1:12:11] if you see me when i go in other words
[1:12:13] if you haven't defected if you're still
[1:12:15] with me to the end you'll carry this
[1:12:17] gospel on if you haven't if you haven't
[1:12:19] ran back across jordan and joined up
[1:12:21] with the school of the prophets and
[1:12:22] forsook the message then then you will
[1:12:25] you will have this anointing on you and
[1:12:28] you'll carry on to the coming of the
[1:12:30] lord
[1:12:31] amen
[1:12:32] but the but the point was
[1:12:35] that he had to keep his eyes that if you
[1:12:37] see me
[1:12:39] if your focus is on me if your focus is
[1:12:42] on the school of the prophets you're
[1:12:44] going to lose track of me i move quick
[1:12:46] elisha
[1:12:47] and and there was even times where
[1:12:48] elijah would say to him listen i'm going
[1:12:50] to go over here to dothan i've got to go
[1:12:51] over here to a place you don't need to
[1:12:53] go it's kind of hard i don't even want
[1:12:54] to put you through it elisha said as the
[1:12:57] lord god liveth i will not leave you
[1:13:01] i am determined i'm here to tell you
[1:13:02] something friend i'm determined to see
[1:13:04] this thing through
[1:13:06] i'm determined i'm never quitting god
[1:13:08] may toss me aside for my failures but
[1:13:10] i'm never going to quit
[1:13:12] i'm in this thing for keeps i'm in this
[1:13:14] thing for all the way
[1:13:16] amen and so that's i'm constantly
[1:13:18] praying david's prayer lord goodness
[1:13:20] don't judge me by my works i'm finished
[1:13:22] if you do judge me by my heart that
[1:13:25] loves you lord
[1:13:26] how many want to pray that prayer today
[1:13:30] you know i remember years ago brother
[1:13:32] eugene teaching a a lesson about how
[1:13:35] that
[1:13:35] you know david was controlling the
[1:13:37] kingdom of israel long before
[1:13:40] he was ever seated on the throne saul
[1:13:42] was actually the king saul had the crown
[1:13:45] and all the authority and the army and
[1:13:46] everything but david was controlling
[1:13:48] israel you know why because saul was
[1:13:50] always worried where's david
[1:13:53] what's david doing what's up with david
[1:13:55] anybody ever got a report on david and
[1:13:58] and and through that because saul had
[1:14:01] his eyes off the target saul was all
[1:14:03] saul was looking at the wrong thing
[1:14:05] where's david what's david what's going
[1:14:06] on about david conspiracy this
[1:14:08] conspiracy that you know and and
[1:14:10] jonathan tries to tell him david loves
[1:14:12] you you know and but but it didn't
[1:14:15] matter
[1:14:16] because listen friends if you keep going
[1:14:19] down that path
[1:14:21] eventually truth stops
[1:14:24] speaking to you
[1:14:26] it's still speaking but you've stopped
[1:14:28] listening
[1:14:30] you've stopped hearing and the truth can
[1:14:33] absolutely be be be right right in your
[1:14:37] ear and god absolutely uh trying to get
[1:14:41] you to understand his word and you you
[1:14:44] literally become you know uh deaf to it
[1:14:47] you can you no longer can hear because
[1:14:49] you you resisted so long
[1:14:51] and so uh i i remember um i remember let
[1:14:56] me see if i can find it here quickly
[1:14:58] this was a wonderful statement from
[1:15:00] spurgeon
[1:15:01] he says
[1:15:03] thy grace
[1:15:05] must give us even to know our need of
[1:15:07] grace
[1:15:09] that beautiful
[1:15:10] thy grace must give us even to know our
[1:15:13] need of grace we are not
[1:15:15] willing to confess
[1:15:17] our own sinfulness
[1:15:19] until thou dost show it to us
[1:15:22] though
[1:15:23] it stares us in the face
[1:15:26] our pride denies it
[1:15:29] and our own inability
[1:15:31] is un
[1:15:33] and our own inability
[1:15:35] is unperceived
[1:15:37] by us
[1:15:39] we
[1:15:40] we steal thy power and call it our own
[1:15:44] till thou dost compel us to say that we
[1:15:47] have no strength in ourselves
[1:15:51] and so often times you'll find people
[1:15:54] making that dreadful mistake i'm glad
[1:15:57] i've i've often uh thought that you know
[1:16:00] the wisdom of god to only put a window
[1:16:04] in the top of the ark so noah couldn't
[1:16:06] look around
[1:16:09] god wanted him look in one direction
[1:16:14] see he even had to use
[1:16:16] birds of the air to figure out if the
[1:16:18] flood waters were deceived he couldn't
[1:16:20] even get him to look around
[1:16:21] see he could only look at the heavens
[1:16:23] and god did it that way he had a side
[1:16:26] door but god closed it he couldn't open
[1:16:27] it
[1:16:28] remember they wanted him to open it
[1:16:29] they're beating on the side of the door
[1:16:31] no
[1:16:33] no
[1:16:34] help noah we went to high school
[1:16:36] together
[1:16:38] [Music]
[1:16:39] no our family's picnic together noah
[1:16:44] open
[1:16:46] noah said i didn't close it i can't open
[1:16:48] it
[1:16:49] you were warned for 120 years you were
[1:16:52] warned
[1:16:53] and now god has closed it i can't open
[1:16:55] it but one thing he could look up was a
[1:16:57] window looking to the sky
[1:17:00] and so so we find that god would not
[1:17:02] even allow noah the ability to look
[1:17:06] around at at the at the terrible plight
[1:17:10] of the earth and and i'm going to tell
[1:17:12] you something friends god wants your
[1:17:14] focus in one direction jesus said that
[1:17:17] jesus gave a whole bullet list
[1:17:20] of terrible things that are unfolding at
[1:17:22] the end time and he said when you see
[1:17:25] these things
[1:17:26] look around and get involved
[1:17:29] he didn't say that
[1:17:31] he said look up
[1:17:33] your redemption draweth nigh see
[1:17:37] so so we find brother branham told the
[1:17:39] story you remember the story about the
[1:17:40] boy on the bicycle you know to get that
[1:17:42] new schwinn bike i remember as a kid man
[1:17:45] oh man if i could get a swim bike i i
[1:17:47] was gonna be it'd be like a porsche
[1:17:51] and uh i finally did get one i forget
[1:17:53] how we got one but somehow my mom got me
[1:17:55] a swing and we at least throw that thing
[1:17:57] to we broke it in half
[1:18:00] and uh but brother branham talks about
[1:18:02] that little boy that nobody thought he
[1:18:04] could ride the plank all the way they
[1:18:06] had this narrow little plank and it's
[1:18:08] ups above the ground
[1:18:09] and you got to write it it's one thing
[1:18:12] to write a line on the ground but get up
[1:18:14] in the air and write it right the same
[1:18:16] line on a plank somehow it messes with
[1:18:18] your mind
[1:18:19] and and all those boys would go a little
[1:18:22] ways and they'd go off and this little
[1:18:24] guy jumped on there and
[1:18:26] pedaled all the way to the end crossed
[1:18:28] finish line and won then won the schwinn
[1:18:30] bite and when they asked him how in the
[1:18:31] world you do that we thought you were
[1:18:32] the last one that could have done it he
[1:18:34] said i'm gonna tell you where your
[1:18:35] problem was boys he said i noticed as
[1:18:37] every one of y'all was writing it you
[1:18:39] got to looking at the ground and looking
[1:18:40] around and he said me he said i put my
[1:18:43] eyes on the end and i just never took my
[1:18:45] eyes off and i just rode straight to it
[1:18:47] he said i knew the board went there so i
[1:18:49] just looked to there and i just rode
[1:18:51] amen i'm gonna tell you something
[1:18:52] friends get your eyes off of your
[1:18:54] surroundings unsee fear unseed stress
[1:18:58] unsee anxiety unsee the problems in the
[1:19:01] government unsee the problems in the
[1:19:03] nation unsee the problems and see the
[1:19:06] promise
[1:19:09] see
[1:19:10] you know the their brother ram tells the
[1:19:12] story about the musician you know how he
[1:19:14] he didn't care what the audience was you
[1:19:16] know clapping thunder salvations said he
[1:19:19] wasn't even looking at him so he's
[1:19:20] looking up in the balcony he was waiting
[1:19:22] before he would even take a bow he
[1:19:24] waited for the master
[1:19:26] to stand and applaud
[1:19:28] and then he knew see so so we find in
[1:19:31] the scripture that you remember here's
[1:19:33] another example for you
[1:19:35] you remember simon peter
[1:19:37] now you talk about an important man he's
[1:19:39] going to be the spokesman for the church
[1:19:41] and here he gets sidetracked
[1:19:43] thinking about what's up with john
[1:19:46] and he comes to jesus
[1:19:48] and it's it's peter's just like so many
[1:19:51] of us wow at least we're in good company
[1:19:54] you know
[1:19:55] you ought to be thankful that you're
[1:19:56] even still alive
[1:19:58] you denied the lord
[1:20:00] you straight denied him peter you sold
[1:20:03] him out
[1:20:05] and
[1:20:06] he forgave you
[1:20:08] and you were like one of the worst
[1:20:09] sinners among us but he forgave you and
[1:20:12] now you're high and mighty and holier
[1:20:14] than thou and now you're worried about
[1:20:16] everybody else's life and judging
[1:20:17] everybody else really peter
[1:20:20] and so many times i see people do that
[1:20:22] you know forgiven for so many horrible
[1:20:24] things and then get so judgmental about
[1:20:26] everybody else and you're lucky to even
[1:20:28] be alive
[1:20:30] see
[1:20:30] and so he says to jesus what about him
[1:20:34] and jesus immediately turned and said
[1:20:36] what's that to you
[1:20:38] follow me get your eyes off him put your
[1:20:41] eyes on me peter see it was going to be
[1:20:42] too vital god couldn't let that pass
[1:20:45] because peter was going to be the one
[1:20:46] with the keys to the kingdom he was
[1:20:48] going to be the first one to put the key
[1:20:49] in the door and turn the lock jesus
[1:20:51] didn't have the keys to his kingdom he
[1:20:52] gave them to the church
[1:20:53] and peter's going to be the very first
[1:20:55] one to use them on the day of pentecost
[1:20:56] and tied joel's prophecy to a modern
[1:20:59] event made clear in prophecy
[1:21:01] that's what was happening it was a
[1:21:03] modern event made clear by joel's
[1:21:05] prophecy
[1:21:07] because they were unclear they thought
[1:21:08] they were drunk and peter said no
[1:21:11] that i'm going to identify this modern
[1:21:13] event to you by prophecy this is what
[1:21:15] joel prophesied about and he and okay
[1:21:18] then and he convinced him then they said
[1:21:20] oh what must we do implying what must we
[1:21:23] do to be saved and he he brother bram
[1:21:25] said now here he goes he's going to put
[1:21:27] the key in the door for the first time
[1:21:28] and turn the lock and open the kingdom
[1:21:30] of heaven to people and he said you've
[1:21:32] got to repent and be baptized in the
[1:21:34] name of the lord jesus christ for the
[1:21:36] remission of your sins and you shall
[1:21:38] receive the gift of the holy ghost amen
[1:21:40] amen and that never changes nobody
[1:21:43] nobody else could ever close that door
[1:21:45] when simon opened it and so his job was
[1:21:48] too important god could not jesus
[1:21:51] immediately corrected that because he he
[1:21:54] said i'm sending you
[1:21:55] as sheep among wolves it's going to get
[1:21:58] worse he tells them in matthew 24
[1:22:00] they're going to hate you for my name
[1:22:02] they're going to persecute you they're
[1:22:03] going to kill you they're going to try
[1:22:05] everything and it's too dangerous it's
[1:22:07] too it's too wicked it's too risky the
[1:22:11] stakes are too high
[1:22:13] for you to have your eyes on the wrong
[1:22:15] thing you hear me bride i'm here to tell
[1:22:17] you you've arrived at the worst of all
[1:22:19] days and the stakes are too high
[1:22:21] for you to have your eyes on the
[1:22:23] government or the pandemic or other
[1:22:25] brothers and sisters in christ or what's
[1:22:27] happening in religion and what's
[1:22:29] happening you know about a career in
[1:22:30] wealth and all the social prestige get
[1:22:33] your eyes back on jesus
[1:22:36] unsee all of that
[1:22:39] amen see
[1:22:41] this is where we must be on our guard
[1:22:44] you see because you're not you're not
[1:22:47] you can be fooled i i understand the
[1:22:49] brightest predestinated not to be
[1:22:51] deceived that just means that she's
[1:22:53] never going to take the mark of the
[1:22:54] beast she sees it and exposes it and
[1:22:56] she's never going to
[1:22:58] that
[1:22:58] which
[1:22:59] would be so close that it would deceive
[1:23:01] the very elected if if possible the
[1:23:03] bride is predestinated not to fall for
[1:23:05] that
[1:23:06] now it doesn't mean she might wiggle
[1:23:07] around in a little bit until she gets
[1:23:09] her bearing straight and god might have
[1:23:10] to lead her out of some
[1:23:12] out of sight and god let us all out of
[1:23:14] one thing this that or the other at some
[1:23:16] point in our lives but he was obligated
[1:23:18] to because we were predestinated not to
[1:23:20] be taken out by that
[1:23:22] amen amen and so
[1:23:24] but you can be the devil can trick you
[1:23:26] and he does he does it on on a big scale
[1:23:30] you remember joshua who had the
[1:23:33] commission
[1:23:35] to cross the jordan and he did
[1:23:37] and take jericho and he did
[1:23:39] remember and now he's taking the
[1:23:41] promised land and he was
[1:23:43] and here comes the gibeonites
[1:23:46] and they're saying wow these people have
[1:23:48] literally wiped out everybody including
[1:23:50] egypt
[1:23:51] so let's let the bible said so they
[1:23:53] disguise themselves violently
[1:23:56] you know like wiley coyote you know they
[1:24:00] it's subterfuge they put on old shoes
[1:24:03] and old clothes and they got stale bread
[1:24:06] and they put dust all over their animals
[1:24:08] and over their self and they they were
[1:24:10] only three days ride away and they
[1:24:13] showed up and they said we be from a far
[1:24:17] away country now they had to say that
[1:24:18] because
[1:24:19] they were god had already told joshua
[1:24:21] displace everybody don't leave anybody
[1:24:23] in the land don't leave any trace that
[1:24:24] they were ever even here destroy even
[1:24:26] every trace of them and and take down
[1:24:29] all of their images take down everything
[1:24:31] don't have any trace of them because
[1:24:32] it'll infect your homes see and so they
[1:24:36] come in
[1:24:37] in a sneak and said we we're no no no
[1:24:40] we're not from around here you have to
[1:24:41] kill us we're from a long ways away look
[1:24:44] at our bread we we packed we baked this
[1:24:46] on the day we left
[1:24:48] look how old and moldy it is look at my
[1:24:50] shoes good grief
[1:24:52] and and oh why are you here because we
[1:24:54] heard what you did and we want a treaty
[1:24:56] with you we want to we want to have
[1:24:58] friendship we don't want you to ever
[1:24:59] come and think you're going to destroy
[1:25:00] us so our elders said go and make a
[1:25:03] covenant with them and you know just
[1:25:05] kind of stroke joshua's ego a little bit
[1:25:07] you know you guys are the are the latest
[1:25:09] thing and we're afraid of you and and
[1:25:12] you know what you know and joshua fell
[1:25:13] for it
[1:25:14] do you know why joshua fell for that
[1:25:16] because he failed to keep short books
[1:25:18] with the lord
[1:25:20] i want to tell you something friends you
[1:25:21] better keep short books
[1:25:23] that means you check yourself daily you
[1:25:26] die daily you constantly go to the lord
[1:25:28] lord should i do this lord should i not
[1:25:29] do this lord don't don't think that
[1:25:31] three days ago's permission to go
[1:25:33] forward is today's permission to go
[1:25:35] forward you need to keep short books and
[1:25:37] joshua should have gotten the priest and
[1:25:39] went to the lord and consulted to see if
[1:25:41] these men were lying or not but you know
[1:25:43] he uh
[1:25:44] these guys seem like pretty good guys
[1:25:47] and uh they are obviously from a long
[1:25:49] ways and he got fooled he got tricked
[1:25:50] i'm here to tell you you can get tricked
[1:25:53] laodicea is tricky
[1:25:55] higher education more money more career
[1:25:58] social prestige come on don't go quiet
[1:26:02] you lay the sins you live here with me
[1:26:05] come on i'm here to tell you this thing
[1:26:07] is wicked and tricky and it'll trick
[1:26:09] young people it it'll trick old people
[1:26:12] it'll trick me it'll trick women it'll
[1:26:15] it'll get you so wrapped up in the
[1:26:17] laodicea the very thing you're supposed
[1:26:19] to destroy
[1:26:21] will end up becoming a part of your life
[1:26:24] and the best joshua could do after that
[1:26:26] was put on the tribute and said well
[1:26:28] you're going to carry water and wood for
[1:26:30] the temple services from here on and
[1:26:31] they did
[1:26:32] but they couldn't kill them
[1:26:34] see they couldn't get rid of them
[1:26:36] because they had they had not kept short
[1:26:38] books and they had allowed the enemy
[1:26:42] to trick them
[1:26:44] and you're never been you've never seen
[1:26:46] an age more cunning
[1:26:48] more wildly than today
[1:26:51] see
[1:26:52] all right let's let's move on i'm going
[1:26:54] to have to keep moving on
[1:26:56] brother branham says now watch this here
[1:26:58] he is in modern events
[1:27:00] are made clear by prophecy
[1:27:03] for you're a gene of your father isn't
[1:27:05] that a wonderful statement see
[1:27:08] you're a gene of your father and you
[1:27:10] were in your father yet your father had
[1:27:12] no fellowship with you because he
[1:27:15] you was in there but you knew it not and
[1:27:18] he knew it not but you was manifested
[1:27:22] that you might that he might fellowship
[1:27:24] with you
[1:27:25] and you being born again you're born
[1:27:28] again of eternal life and that's the
[1:27:30] only one form of eternal life and that's
[1:27:33] god's life zoe the greek word is z-o-e
[1:27:36] only one form of eternal life
[1:27:41] then
[1:27:42] if you are a son of god or a daughter of
[1:27:46] god you were in god all the time but he
[1:27:48] knew
[1:27:49] what bed and time like a garden where
[1:27:53] you're gonna which bed you're gonna put
[1:27:54] the seed in which bed you're gonna put
[1:27:55] this seed in you got me
[1:27:57] but he knew what bed and time that you'd
[1:28:00] be planted in
[1:28:02] all right so now you're made a creature
[1:28:05] a son of god
[1:28:07] manifested son of god or daughter of god
[1:28:10] to do what
[1:28:12] to meet the challenge of this hour
[1:28:17] that's what that's where joshua was
[1:28:19] failing when he got tricked he couldn't
[1:28:21] meet the challenge of the hour fully
[1:28:24] and here you are friends
[1:28:26] you're here to to meet the challenge of
[1:28:29] the hour what is the challenge brother
[1:28:31] jason what is the challenge of the hour
[1:28:33] to vindicate
[1:28:35] the true
[1:28:37] and living god of this hour the message
[1:28:40] that's coming forth in this time
[1:28:42] that is my life
[1:28:45] that is my purpose my everything is to
[1:28:49] vindicate how do i vindicate by
[1:28:52] manifesting it
[1:28:53] by living it it doesn't do you any good
[1:28:56] to believe it or tell it or speak it or
[1:28:58] quote it if you're not living it
[1:29:01] if you're not living it you're not
[1:29:03] accomplishing the purpose why god put
[1:29:06] breath in your lungs to begin with
[1:29:10] if all you're interested in is making
[1:29:13] friends with the world and living in
[1:29:14] that quasi-no man's land where the world
[1:29:17] kind of lets you get by and you're not
[1:29:19] really on fire for god
[1:29:21] i'm a friend you are a sad broken person
[1:29:25] i'm here to tell you you need to say
[1:29:26] lord give me the zeal give me back the
[1:29:29] joy give me back some fervency
[1:29:32] that's nowhere for an eagle to live
[1:29:36] an eagle's never going to be happy all
[1:29:38] you'll do is be miserable and the devil
[1:29:40] will put you on a merry-go-round today
[1:29:43] and you'll never get off he'll just
[1:29:44] speed it up speed it up speed it up i
[1:29:46] just say to you like i said here a
[1:29:48] servicer go jump off of it
[1:29:51] just jump off of it now jesus will catch
[1:29:53] you
[1:29:55] and let him purpose your life see
[1:29:59] so
[1:30:01] this is what you're
[1:30:02] here for
[1:30:04] see that's right he says
[1:30:06] you were
[1:30:08] done there before
[1:30:10] the foundation of the world if it wasn't
[1:30:13] he wasn't chosen that way no matter how
[1:30:15] much you try to impersonate it
[1:30:17] you'll never make it
[1:30:19] how can you get blood from a turnip when
[1:30:21] there's no blood in there so now don't
[1:30:24] lose sight of the fact that we're not
[1:30:27] talking about there there's
[1:30:30] you know brother branham would say
[1:30:32] he said now being a former baptist i
[1:30:35] know they don't like the word
[1:30:36] predestination
[1:30:37] because he knew he had been a baptist
[1:30:39] himself they don't like predestination
[1:30:42] he says but now all we're saying is is
[1:30:45] god simply foreknew
[1:30:47] who would and who wouldn't
[1:30:49] he's going to give them all an equal
[1:30:51] chance
[1:30:52] he's going to have to do that he's going
[1:30:54] to he he he you know he
[1:30:57] as it rel you know for all of humanity
[1:31:00] the bible says jesus died for the sins
[1:31:03] plural of the whole world so so we must
[1:31:08] preach to all
[1:31:10] see we're not selective on who we preach
[1:31:12] to we preach to everybody to give
[1:31:15] everybody to give a chance to all though
[1:31:18] god already knows the choice they'll
[1:31:21] make but it must here it it must be a
[1:31:25] lived out manifestation to be evidence
[1:31:28] at their trial god even for the heathen
[1:31:31] who never heard it they're going to be
[1:31:33] raised up in the millennium to hear it
[1:31:35] you understand god can't condemn people
[1:31:37] without evidence and therefore we preach
[1:31:39] the gospel to them and they make the
[1:31:41] choice and it's a legitimate choice sure
[1:31:43] god knows what it's going to be and
[1:31:45] therefore he can predetermine what's
[1:31:47] going to happen to them but he doesn't
[1:31:48] trap them or force them to do it right
[1:31:51] you understand he just simply already
[1:31:53] knows that a choice they're going to
[1:31:54] make so he can set his books you and i
[1:31:56] don't know so we preach to everybody
[1:32:00] amen but that is a completely dif that's
[1:32:03] just to the world but that that's not
[1:32:06] the same
[1:32:08] garden bed as his elected genes
[1:32:13] for his elected genes
[1:32:15] they're they they're that's not even you
[1:32:18] choosing him that's him choosing you
[1:32:21] because
[1:32:22] that kind of election is pure origin i
[1:32:25] come from god so i go back to god
[1:32:28] and that's why i see the message of the
[1:32:30] hour i won't be the only one in heaven
[1:32:32] there will be many the foolish virgin
[1:32:34] you understand you understand the
[1:32:36] foolish virgin will be there because
[1:32:38] they were righteous people they were not
[1:32:41] they were not get this out of your head
[1:32:43] forever they were not these fake
[1:32:46] christians who have a form of godliness
[1:32:48] but deny the power
[1:32:50] those people are going to
[1:32:52] hell amen
[1:32:54] 100
[1:32:56] there's no chance for a person who looks
[1:33:00] at god and has the word revealed to them
[1:33:03] and will not follow it they doom
[1:33:05] themselves
[1:33:07] now
[1:33:08] say so you get to be the arbiter of who
[1:33:10] that is thank god no
[1:33:14] thank god no
[1:33:15] i'm not the arbiter of who that is i'm
[1:33:18] only speaking generically of a principle
[1:33:20] of god's word
[1:33:22] that when i read matthew 25 i see that
[1:33:26] people are being destroyed and some
[1:33:28] people are given eternal life and the
[1:33:29] ones that are granted eternal life are
[1:33:31] the righteous
[1:33:33] the sanctified ones
[1:33:37] not these who those who had a form of
[1:33:39] godliness who were fake christians and
[1:33:42] 99 of christians are that
[1:33:46] according to the bible
[1:33:48] according to the bible broad is the way
[1:33:51] that leadeth to destruction many shall
[1:33:53] go therein but
[1:33:55] narrow is the way that lead to life and
[1:33:57] few there be that find it
[1:33:59] in the days of noah it was only eight in
[1:34:02] the days of enoch it was only one
[1:34:04] amen
[1:34:06] so if you if you disagree with it i've
[1:34:08] got more evidence than you i've got
[1:34:10] scriptural precedent to read
[1:34:12] i can see what happens to people who
[1:34:15] just make who do who just make
[1:34:17] christianity a religiosity and they're
[1:34:19] no more born again than that chair is
[1:34:21] born again they're not going in a
[1:34:23] rapture they're not going to heaven they
[1:34:25] don't have eternal life they're going to
[1:34:26] be destroyed unless they're born again
[1:34:30] jesus said to nicodemus a righteous holy
[1:34:32] man you must be born again
[1:34:35] if you're not born again you're you're
[1:34:37] just going to live out your death
[1:34:39] sentence that you were born by
[1:34:42] because you chose not to take god at his
[1:34:45] word and believe on his son
[1:34:48] and people have a mental
[1:34:51] idea of that but it doesn't change their
[1:34:53] life that's just a social gospel
[1:34:56] those are the ones who try to get in by
[1:34:57] building by doing works and jesus says
[1:35:00] no you can't you those were iniquity
[1:35:02] they he doesn't deny their works he says
[1:35:04] they were iniquitous
[1:35:06] because you actually knew
[1:35:08] you knew
[1:35:09] that you were just trying to force my
[1:35:11] hand
[1:35:12] but you knew you were evil in your heart
[1:35:15] and you tried to earn it by works guess
[1:35:17] what
[1:35:17] you're not going to get in
[1:35:20] and they head straight to the lake of
[1:35:21] fire i didn't write that he did
[1:35:26] and i'm not going to sit back and let
[1:35:28] people under my care think that that's
[1:35:31] not true
[1:35:33] if if you disagree with that you need
[1:35:35] another pastor because i'm going to
[1:35:37] preach to you god's word i want to get
[1:35:39] it down into your heart now because your
[1:35:42] job is to manifest the word of this day
[1:35:46] you're the only chance they have
[1:35:49] the only chance they have is if you put
[1:35:52] on the whole armor of god and be a
[1:35:54] vindication and be a a living reality
[1:35:57] that's the best chance they have
[1:36:00] if you live a wishy-washy carnal life
[1:36:03] that's unspiritual how are you ever
[1:36:05] going to get anyone convinced of the
[1:36:07] word
[1:36:09] it's impossible
[1:36:10] and i can't be silent to that i'm a
[1:36:13] watchman on the wall and i cannot be
[1:36:15] silent to that and the more wicked the
[1:36:18] world becomes and the more i see my
[1:36:20] sheep headed in that direction the
[1:36:22] harder i will preach it from this death
[1:36:26] i love you too much
[1:36:29] amen and i fear god too much
[1:36:32] to let that go i'm i'm i'm going to
[1:36:35] teach it to these young people i'm going
[1:36:37] to raise a generation up under this
[1:36:39] ministry that doesn't believe that bunch
[1:36:41] of nonsense we're not here to be a half
[1:36:44] christian there's no such thing
[1:36:46] you're either full of the spirit of god
[1:36:48] or you don't have any of the spirit of
[1:36:49] god
[1:36:51] either you're completely converted or
[1:36:52] you're not i get in maturity i get you
[1:36:54] got to grow i get that of course yeah
[1:36:57] duh no kidding
[1:36:59] of course we've got to grow of course
[1:37:01] we've got to put on of course we've got
[1:37:03] to add to and add to an add to but
[1:37:05] that's that has nothing to do with them
[1:37:07] with a new birth if i'm born again i
[1:37:09] don't need to add two to cast out devils
[1:37:12] i have the authority of heaven the day
[1:37:14] i'm born again to cast out devils to
[1:37:17] preach the gospel hallelujah to see the
[1:37:19] enemy bound and his lies exposed
[1:37:23] amen
[1:37:25] amen
[1:37:26] amen
[1:37:29] so so i i'm obligated to tell you the
[1:37:32] truth amen
[1:37:36] it must be
[1:37:38] a lived out manifestation
[1:37:42] our life must be
[1:37:45] a lived out
[1:37:46] manifestation brother branham says here
[1:37:49] in the seed
[1:37:50] is not heir with the shock now notice
[1:37:54] but at the opening of the seven seals
[1:37:56] revelation 10 the full word is to be
[1:37:58] born into manifestation again and
[1:38:00] vindicated by the spirit of god in the
[1:38:02] full strength as it was when it was here
[1:38:04] on earth manifested in the same way
[1:38:07] doing the same things that it did when
[1:38:09] it was here on earth amen hebrews 13 8
[1:38:12] said jesus christ
[1:38:13] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:38:16] saint luke 10 17 30. jesus said in the
[1:38:19] last days as it was in the days of sodom
[1:38:22] when the son of man will be revealing
[1:38:24] himself again
[1:38:26] it'll be the exact same thing in that
[1:38:29] glorious
[1:38:30] the world in a sodom condition
[1:38:34] and the church has went into sodom with
[1:38:36] it like lot and his wife
[1:38:40] now
[1:38:41] john
[1:38:42] 3 13.
[1:38:44] no man hath ascended up to heaven but he
[1:38:46] that came down from heaven well i'm
[1:38:48] almost out of time
[1:38:50] even the son of man which is in heaven
[1:38:53] now
[1:38:54] this is an interesting because i want
[1:38:56] you to i want you to think about this
[1:38:58] for a minute and brother branham is
[1:38:59] going to take this and he's going to
[1:39:01] mash it up with except you eat the flesh
[1:39:03] of the son of man drink his blood you
[1:39:05] have no life in you so he's going to
[1:39:06] mash them up together
[1:39:07] and uh and and and give the principal
[1:39:10] so we find that
[1:39:17] that it's come to a sodom condition
[1:39:20] and the church
[1:39:22] has went with it
[1:39:23] like lot
[1:39:25] and his wife
[1:39:26] and so
[1:39:27] while we say that there is an elected
[1:39:30] church somewhere in the world
[1:39:32] you know that's that's that's literally
[1:39:34] being pulled out and set aside and and
[1:39:37] literally is setting aside the world and
[1:39:39] unseeing the world and pressing on
[1:39:41] because the manifestation of god what
[1:39:44] what did that to your life
[1:39:47] because the manifestation of god has
[1:39:50] attracted your attention
[1:39:53] i mean why else would you be here
[1:39:56] with having somebody tell you that
[1:39:59] except you're born again you're going to
[1:40:01] hell
[1:40:03] except you're born again you'll in no
[1:40:05] wise see the kingdom of heaven amen
[1:40:09] and so so so we realize that even even
[1:40:13] coming to the millennia even coming to
[1:40:15] the millennium
[1:40:16] the foolish virgin are not there
[1:40:18] amen why for the 144 000 are yeah
[1:40:23] and it's almost like wow it's kind of
[1:40:24] weird revelation 15 has them both they
[1:40:27] both came up out of great tribulation
[1:40:28] and one of them had the song of moses
[1:40:30] and one of them had the song of the lamb
[1:40:31] the ones who had the song of moses 144
[1:40:34] 000 get to be in the millennium and the
[1:40:35] ones who have the song and lamb don't
[1:40:37] get to what gives they're even in the
[1:40:39] same verse
[1:40:41] because the 144 000 received this
[1:40:44] message of the seventh seal under moses
[1:40:46] and elijah
[1:40:47] when the bride leaves here this same
[1:40:49] eagle anointing lifts up and flies east
[1:40:51] and picks up moses and elijah and takes
[1:40:53] this message of the seventh seal to the
[1:40:55] jews under the seventh trumpet
[1:40:57] and they actually receive the holy ghost
[1:40:59] and they're actually born again
[1:41:00] believing this same message
[1:41:03] the fullest virgin who have come up out
[1:41:05] of great tribulation did not believe it
[1:41:08] they actually rejected it and had to go
[1:41:10] through the tribulation and suffer for
[1:41:12] it and they're not going to be in the
[1:41:13] millennium they'll be somewhere with
[1:41:15] life they're not going to be in hell but
[1:41:17] they're not going to be in the
[1:41:18] millennium and then at the end of the
[1:41:21] millennium a thousand years later
[1:41:22] they're brought up and judged with the
[1:41:24] rest of the world and then they're given
[1:41:26] eternal life at that time amen
[1:41:29] that's plain scripture
[1:41:32] and so so we find then that that when he
[1:41:35] comes here to
[1:41:36] no man has to send it up to heaven but
[1:41:39] he that hath came down from heaven
[1:41:41] all right so brother branham says
[1:41:44] so he turned around he had 70 with him
[1:41:46] he said to that 70 will you
[1:41:50] what will you say when you see the son
[1:41:52] of man
[1:41:53] ascending up into heaven from whence he
[1:41:55] came
[1:41:56] now he never explained it
[1:42:00] they looked at one another
[1:42:02] and said well the son of man ascending
[1:42:04] up from where he come from well
[1:42:07] now watch
[1:42:08] look at what they're seeing
[1:42:11] we know his mother we we know his
[1:42:13] brothers and his sisters we seen the
[1:42:15] manger he was laid in
[1:42:17] when he was born we seen the cradle he
[1:42:19] was rocked in why he's come from
[1:42:22] nazareth coming up from there this is a
[1:42:24] hard saying and they didn't walk with
[1:42:27] him no more
[1:42:28] now all the time these disciples stood
[1:42:32] right there they didn't know it either
[1:42:34] but they believed it they couldn't
[1:42:36] explain it they he never explained it
[1:42:39] see but they were ordained to life they
[1:42:41] couldn't explain it but they sat there
[1:42:44] so he turned and said i've chose 12 of
[1:42:47] you one is a devil he said do you want
[1:42:50] to go also
[1:42:51] and they said
[1:42:53] uh uh or let me and and you know the
[1:42:55] answer lord to whom would we go thou has
[1:42:58] the words of eternal life
[1:43:00] so we find that
[1:43:01] that here's
[1:43:03] here's people
[1:43:04] hearing jesus say
[1:43:07] you know except you eat my flesh and
[1:43:08] drink my blood except you'll be born
[1:43:10] again you can never in the spirit and
[1:43:12] never enter the kingdom of god how would
[1:43:14] you think if you saw the son of man
[1:43:16] which is standing right in front of you
[1:43:17] but yet he's in heaven
[1:43:19] and yet you see him here
[1:43:20] and you know what they couldn't get past
[1:43:23] they couldn't unsee
[1:43:25] they couldn't we know his brothers
[1:43:29] i knew his sisters
[1:43:31] i i saw the manger he was born and i saw
[1:43:33] the cradle i know his family isn't he
[1:43:36] from nazareth is carpenter's son this is
[1:43:38] a strange saying you know why because
[1:43:40] they couldn't unsee that
[1:43:43] i'm here to tell you something friends
[1:43:44] there's there's things that he didn't
[1:43:46] explain and even the disciples didn't
[1:43:48] understand it and he didn't explain it
[1:43:50] to them it would take the holy ghost
[1:43:53] just know this friends god's not here
[1:43:55] today let me say this god's not here to
[1:43:58] explain everything to you i may have
[1:44:02] even muddied the water more for you by
[1:44:05] some of the things i said it's not about
[1:44:07] understanding it's it's are you a
[1:44:10] believer
[1:44:11] do you believe that this message is the
[1:44:13] message of this hour sent to rapture
[1:44:16] bride and if you don't believe that then
[1:44:19] i will just ask you then what message
[1:44:21] would you point to if it's not this one
[1:44:25] there's none other out there even
[1:44:27] remotely close to it and i say to you
[1:44:30] this is a message to rapture a bride and
[1:44:33] there's no other message out there it's
[1:44:35] the message that will make real
[1:44:37] christians go in a real rapture
[1:44:40] [Applause]
[1:44:42] and there is no other message that will
[1:44:44] accomplish that
[1:44:47] and he said what about somebody on a
[1:44:48] deserted island then god will send them
[1:44:50] up uh somebody will drop a book out of
[1:44:52] 33 000 feet and it'll land on their head
[1:44:54] and they'll read and believe it i don't
[1:44:56] know i don't know it's not up to me to
[1:44:58] know but i know this message is sent to
[1:45:00] gather a bride from around the world
[1:45:03] amen
[1:45:05] amen
[1:45:07] see
[1:45:08] but it's the sodom condition and this is
[1:45:10] what they
[1:45:12] needed so desperately to look past
[1:45:16] see
[1:45:17] so he says
[1:45:19] but you'll now watch this you'll stick
[1:45:21] anything down that soul just anything
[1:45:23] any kind of a creed
[1:45:25] and never look brother branham brother
[1:45:26] brown talks about let me go back so you
[1:45:28] don't read ahead of me brother ram talks
[1:45:30] about you sit in a restaurant
[1:45:33] and they bring you soup and it's got a
[1:45:35] bug in it
[1:45:37] and he said you won't eat it
[1:45:40] some spider some roach some fly whatever
[1:45:43] you won't eat it
[1:45:45] you'll actually complain make them take
[1:45:46] it back and then you probably won't know
[1:45:47] i don't even want any more i don't want
[1:45:49] where that came from
[1:45:51] but brother branham says but
[1:45:53] you'll stick anything down in that soul
[1:45:56] just anything any kind of creed never
[1:45:59] look into it to see whether it's the
[1:46:00] right thing or not there's a way that
[1:46:03] seems right to a man search the
[1:46:04] scriptures
[1:46:05] and that is that soul is eternal you
[1:46:07] know so don't just watch what you put in
[1:46:10] there see these creeds and all these
[1:46:12] things we just got it like a lodge join
[1:46:14] a lodge and that settles it and that's
[1:46:16] the way people think today
[1:46:21] that's the reason
[1:46:22] [Music]
[1:46:24] they have no time to be studying
[1:46:27] meditating searching things and trying
[1:46:28] to figure out whether they're right or
[1:46:30] not
[1:46:31] because they're filling their soul with
[1:46:34] so much stuff
[1:46:36] so much nonsense of the world and their
[1:46:40] their spirituality's gone out the window
[1:46:43] and they they they've lost the ability
[1:46:45] to stop and go wait a minute
[1:46:48] is what i'm believing the truth
[1:46:51] i mean you you you should you shouldn't
[1:46:53] just swallow anything even this message
[1:46:55] of the hour you need to ask god reveal
[1:46:57] it to me
[1:46:58] make it real to me because no man can
[1:46:59] come except the father draws him and
[1:47:01] nobody can approach the father except by
[1:47:03] the son and whom the son will reveal him
[1:47:05] to
[1:47:06] that that scriptural principle is why we
[1:47:09] don't hold billy graham type crusades
[1:47:12] because i'm not trying to gain numbers
[1:47:13] i'm not trying to we're after a where i
[1:47:16] only need a few good men
[1:47:19] and women
[1:47:20] god has an elected few now i want to
[1:47:23] preach to the whole world i'm going to
[1:47:25] cherokee to do just that because i don't
[1:47:27] know who all's a seed and who's not so
[1:47:29] we're casting it everywhere it's why
[1:47:31] i've been around the world so many times
[1:47:32] preaching the gospel because i'm trying
[1:47:34] to find the last seed but i'm not naive
[1:47:38] i'm not naive to think that everybody
[1:47:41] who says lord lord is going to enter in
[1:47:44] see
[1:47:45] so so we find that he says
[1:47:48] whether whether they're right or not all
[1:47:51] right
[1:47:52] what is the evidence of a believer
[1:47:55] that will believe the identified word of
[1:47:58] the hour it's always been that way the
[1:48:00] people get it scrupled up in all kinds
[1:48:02] of traditions and religions and
[1:48:04] denominations and elections education
[1:48:06] and so forth but god comes along with
[1:48:08] his word and confirms it for the hour
[1:48:10] that's the evidence you believe the
[1:48:12] confirmed word and brother branham says
[1:48:15] it's always been that way
[1:48:16] and i have said that as a student of
[1:48:18] this book since a boy it's always been
[1:48:21] that way
[1:48:22] there's no instance in here where
[1:48:24] anybody ever found acceptance in god's
[1:48:27] presence except by believing the message
[1:48:30] of their hour whatever hour they were in
[1:48:33] see that's not a new thing
[1:48:36] all right so he says here in dedication
[1:48:38] now we find out i'm out of time but i'm
[1:48:41] at the bottom of my notes so just stay
[1:48:42] with me i just want to read you these
[1:48:43] quotes
[1:48:46] been working on this for more than a
[1:48:47] week so just give me a few times a
[1:48:49] little bit of time
[1:48:51] now we find out
[1:48:52] that there is a great spiritual
[1:48:54] application here that i would like to
[1:48:56] mainly refer to now if you read the
[1:48:57] first kings you'll find in this solomon
[1:49:00] being as a young man to build this
[1:49:01] temple that his father had been promised
[1:49:04] though god through god that he would
[1:49:06] build you see he stays in line with the
[1:49:10] scripture
[1:49:12] he stays in line with the scripture all
[1:49:14] right let me get to catch catch up to
[1:49:16] myself
[1:49:18] all right
[1:49:20] he stays in line with the with with the
[1:49:22] um that's not right do we find out and
[1:49:24] then oh yeah i'm sorry all right now
[1:49:27] that's what we must always do to be
[1:49:30] successful is to stay in line with god's
[1:49:34] promises i could not give you better
[1:49:37] advice than that
[1:49:39] if you gave me a million dollars today
[1:49:42] i could not give you better advice than
[1:49:45] that
[1:49:46] stay in line with god's promises and in
[1:49:50] order to do that you're going to have to
[1:49:52] ignore some lies of the age and the lies
[1:49:55] of the enemy and you're going to have to
[1:49:56] unsee some things
[1:49:58] see
[1:49:59] stay with in line with god's promises
[1:50:02] now no matter how it seems best to go
[1:50:05] this way or that way stay lined with the
[1:50:07] scripture young people follow that
[1:50:10] if you do you'll be successful
[1:50:13] if you go off of that if that's not your
[1:50:15] life's motto then you're in trouble
[1:50:17] see you're going to roll around and burn
[1:50:19] a lot and you waste a lot of time see
[1:50:22] so no matter how it seems best to go
[1:50:24] this way or that way stay lined with the
[1:50:26] scripture solomon know that god had
[1:50:28] promised his father david that he would
[1:50:31] build the temple
[1:50:32] and then now now brother branham i'm
[1:50:34] going chronologically since 1962 and
[1:50:37] he's saying stay in line with god's word
[1:50:39] stay in line you get me
[1:50:41] now he's going to come to masterpiece in
[1:50:43] 64. he's talking about those girls that
[1:50:46] he saw remember remember he saw he saw
[1:50:48] the early church and she was holy and
[1:50:51] decent and then he saw that the church
[1:50:53] is out of the church ages and until it
[1:50:55] got down to the last one of america and
[1:50:57] he said she's the worst of all of them
[1:50:59] remember how depressed and embarrassed
[1:51:00] he was and then the voice said the bride
[1:51:03] must come into preview again because
[1:51:04] there had to be an omega to an alpha
[1:51:07] and man you had the first bride she has
[1:51:08] to come into preview again that's you
[1:51:10] and me
[1:51:11] and brother branham said
[1:51:13] now then as they started leaving two or
[1:51:16] three of them this is that sainted bunch
[1:51:18] of little girls smooth clean marching to
[1:51:20] the step of the gospel left right
[1:51:23] left right left marching in harmony to
[1:51:26] the gospel
[1:51:28] and he says i see two or three of them
[1:51:30] in the back kind of get out of step
[1:51:32] those are the ones at the very tail end
[1:51:34] those last members just before the
[1:51:37] rapture
[1:51:39] right
[1:51:40] they and i was going to holler at them
[1:51:44] and they was trying to get back in step
[1:51:47] again and i seen them just the vision
[1:51:49] just fade out and change from me he
[1:51:52] comes to 1965 in the rapture i noticed
[1:51:54] one of them trying two or three of them
[1:51:57] trying to get getting out of line i
[1:51:59] screamed stay in line
[1:52:01] and the vision left me and i was
[1:52:02] standing in the room screaming stay in
[1:52:04] line
[1:52:06] now i don't i didn't
[1:52:09] put the next quote up we'll stop right
[1:52:11] there
[1:52:12] but brother branham tells in another
[1:52:14] place
[1:52:15] the thing
[1:52:16] that made them lose step was they were
[1:52:20] watching that other group
[1:52:23] they were watching that church that
[1:52:25] fallen church of america go off the edge
[1:52:28] and the screams and the howls and they
[1:52:30] were like oh my gosh what's going on
[1:52:32] and it caused them to you know
[1:52:35] from from left
[1:52:37] left
[1:52:38] left and they kind of left right left
[1:52:41] left and brother brandon says stay in
[1:52:43] line
[1:52:44] and i and i and i love how brother stacy
[1:52:46] goodbread told me because he i think he
[1:52:47] was in the air force and he said you
[1:52:49] know brother jason if if you get out of
[1:52:51] line and he said it's left left left
[1:52:55] right left he said if you get out of
[1:52:56] line you're only half a step to get back
[1:52:58] in don't ever think the devil's got you
[1:53:01] so far you can't recover he said all it
[1:53:03] takes is is left right and he said then
[1:53:05] you just
[1:53:07] just make a little half step and you're
[1:53:09] back on track again don't let the devil
[1:53:12] pull you out and say oh it's too far i i
[1:53:14] i can't get back yes you can
[1:53:17] all you got to do is get back in step
[1:53:18] with the word of god all you got to do
[1:53:20] is line your life back up with the word
[1:53:22] of god you don't have to you know the
[1:53:24] bible says there's coming an age in the
[1:53:27] holy ghost where no one's going to need
[1:53:29] to cross the ocean and say hey can you
[1:53:31] go get the lord and bring him to us
[1:53:33] nobody's going to have to say can
[1:53:35] somebody fly up to heaven and bring him
[1:53:37] back down he said because in the holy
[1:53:39] ghost he'll be in you the word of god is
[1:53:42] nighty it's even in thy mouth call on
[1:53:44] the name of the lord today
[1:53:46] allow him to bring your life back into
[1:53:48] step unsee
[1:53:52] but say that to you today as we close
[1:53:54] unsee the circumstances that are
[1:53:56] hindering you
[1:53:58] turn your eyes upon jesus turn your eyes
[1:54:01] away from these things unhear unthink un
[1:54:04] uninvolved
[1:54:06] disconnect
[1:54:08] yourself
[1:54:10] from the things of the world
[1:54:13] that are pulling you
[1:54:15] inextricably i mean
[1:54:17] you're you're you're never going to be
[1:54:19] able to resist the the gravitational
[1:54:22] pull of sin except god do it for you
[1:54:26] and so my advice to you today is is
[1:54:28] reach up and say lord help me today i've
[1:54:31] been i've i need to unsee some things i
[1:54:33] need to unthink some things i need to

[1:54:43] my life and i want to see that in this
[1:54:46] last hour right here i want to be a
[1:54:47] manifestation
[1:54:49] of the word of god

[1:54:57] is mutually exclusive between you and
[1:54:59] satan it's at no time can you both be

[1:57:30] debris so that people can make an
[1:57:32] informed decision
[1:57:35] i can't make it for them
[1:57:37] all i can do is encourage them to follow
[1:57:39] it and try to live it in front of that's
[1:57:41] that's the limit
[1:57:43] that's all you've asked me to do was
[1:57:44] stand in your presence and i have
[1:57:47] and you said that if i'd stand in your
[1:57:49] presence i'd called your people to hear
[1:57:51] your word and i know this he's promised
[1:57:53] it
[1:57:54] that if your people hear your word
[1:57:55] they'll go free from their sin

[1:58:23] than a week now lord it's been rolling
[1:58:25] around in my heart and mind

[1:58:51] day's coming not just today
[1:58:53] but the days coming they'll ponder some
[1:58:55] of these things and maybe not everything

[1:59:00] but
[1:59:01] let the holy spirit
[1:59:03] blow his breezes upon them
[1:59:06] granted lord i committed to you i commit
[1:59:08] these people those on the internet you
[1:59:10] can't you can't draw such lines in the
[1:59:13] sand and not expect lord to cross
