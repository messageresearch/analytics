[6:18] james a servant of god
[6:20] and of the lord jesus christ
[6:22] to the 12 tribes which are scattered
[6:25] abroad greeting you can be seated this
[6:28] morning
[6:30] i'm going to show just an eight-minute
[6:31] video
[6:33] that is not the best video i could find
[6:35] but it was good enough to just teach us
[6:38] just a little bit of history
[6:40] and i believe it's important to
[6:41] understand who the the context not just
[6:44] the writer as we talked a lot about
[6:46] james the writer we talked a little bit
[6:48] about his letter what he wrote last time
[6:51] we spoke on this
[6:53] now we want to talk about the context of
[6:56] why he wrote what he wrote and to
[6:58] understand who the book was written to
[7:01] verse one let's look at it again here
[7:03] together paul's that just for a moment
[7:05] just have it have it ready that's fine
[7:07] james one verse one let's read it again
[7:09] james a servant of god
[7:11] and of the lord jesus christ to the 12
[7:14] tribes which are scattered abroad
[7:18] so this is what the jewish
[7:22] history refers to as the dispersion we
[7:25] know the first dispersion was under
[7:28] babylon when they were exiled from
[7:30] jerusalem and sent into babylon and they
[7:33] were taken captive and then even after
[7:36] cyrus uh through nehemiah and through
[7:38] ezra allows them to go and rebuild the
[7:40] temple
[7:41] yet some jews stays in babylon some jews
[7:44] goes back some of the jews went back
[7:48] uh to rebuild the temple but that was
[7:50] the first dispersion and you're gonna
[7:52] hear a lot about that and you're gonna
[7:54] and it's gonna help you understand a
[7:55] little bit just the history of a journey
[7:58] and i could have chose many different
[8:00] videos and this one's a little bit
[8:02] childish so we're teaching sunday school
[8:04] and so just to be like children here
[8:06] this morning this might be in uh
[8:08] animated and they've got some funny
[8:10] music in the background but i believe it
[8:12] does a good job uh
[8:14] just just just uh exploring some of the
[8:16] history
[8:18] of the jewish people and what they call
[8:20] the dispersion they have another word
[8:22] for that but what is called the
[8:24] dispersion because this is
[8:27] intricate it's uni it's very
[8:30] uh it's very uh
[8:32] an important part of jewish culture and
[8:36] what the jews believe today about
[8:39] um how their entire history from all the
[8:42] way from the exodus
[8:44] where they're taken into taken into
[8:46] egypt and made slaves and then they're
[8:48] they're brought through in exodus on a
[8:50] journey out of egypt
[8:52] uh through to the promised land and all
[8:55] the way to the time when jesus comes on
[8:57] the scene
[8:59] do you realize that the bible says that
[9:01] at the fullness of time that jesus came
[9:04] and that when jesus came
[9:06] the timing was perfect
[9:09] god doesn't do anything happen uh
[9:11] haphazardly
[9:13] or just randomly
[9:15] but when jesus comes on the scene
[9:18] it's the perfect time
[9:20] do you realize that the the reason why
[9:24] that the jews were dispersed that jesus
[9:26] when jesus comes on the scene you have
[9:28] the roman empire he didn't come before
[9:31] but now you have the roman empire and
[9:33] what is rome
[9:35] one of the one of the things that rome
[9:37] was most popular for was roman roads
[9:41] so prior to the roman empire there were
[9:43] no roads so now there's roads
[9:47] and now there's a greek language that's
[9:49] universal among the entire world and the
[9:52] jews are now dispersed not not from
[9:54] babylon but the second dispersion
[9:56] and the jews are scattered
[9:59] across the entire mediterranean so jews
[10:02] are scattered there's roads and everyone
[10:04] speaks the same language and then jesus
[10:07] comes on the scene
[10:08] at the right time
[10:10] and now there's roads for the gospel to
[10:12] spread to the entire world
[10:15] and and jews aren't just huddled in one
[10:18] spot in jerusalem but now they're
[10:20] fragmented everywhere and it was god who
[10:23] set it up that way
[10:25] at the right time
[10:27] go ahead and play that video for me this
[10:28] is just going to be just a little lesson
[10:30] here eight minutes long go ahead make
[10:31] sure it has plenty of volume
[10:37] and conflicts
[10:39] this video will trace their stories back
[10:41] to the time of judah kingdom after the
[10:44] death of king solomon in 931 bc the
[10:47] united monarchy was split into the
[10:49] kingdom of israel and the kingdom of
[10:51] judah
[10:52] in 722 bc the kingdom of israel was
[10:55] invaded by the assyrians the remaining
[10:57] population fled to the kingdom of judah
[11:00] and its capital city jerusalem
[11:02] the region was put under the control of
[11:04] the assyrians for a century until 612 bc
[11:08] when the assyrian empire was overthrown
[11:10] by the babylonians
[11:12] in 586 bc babylon conquered judah
[11:16] solomon's temple was demolished and the
[11:18] jews were exiled to babylon
[11:20] in 538 bc babylon fell to the persian
[11:24] aka minute empire the new king cyrus the
[11:27] great
[11:28] decreed freedom to subjugated nations
[11:31] the jews in babylon returned to judah
[11:33] where they rebuilt the city and
[11:35] organized the foundations of jewish
[11:37] culture with the reconstruction of
[11:39] solomon's temple and the writing of
[11:41] torah part of the jewish bible
[11:43] two centuries later alexander the great
[11:46] of macedon made a conquest of the
[11:48] acamented empire
[11:49] after the success due to the death of
[11:51] alexander at a young age the empire was
[11:54] divided among his generals into various
[11:57] hellenic kingdoms
[11:58] following the incorporation of judea
[12:00] into the seleucid kingdom in 198 bc the
[12:04] crack
[12:05] between the religious jews and
[12:06] hellenized jews emerged
[12:09] this was a time of religious struggle as
[12:11] the jewish population split under the
[12:13] reign of king antiochus iv the second
[12:16] temple which was built on the ruin of
[12:18] solomon's temple was desecrated due to
[12:20] the set up of a pagan altar to zeus
[12:23] in 165 bc the religion-driven revolt
[12:26] against the seleucid empire and the
[12:28] hellenistic impact on jewish life had
[12:31] started the success of the revolt led to
[12:33] the establishment of a jewish
[12:35] independent rule the hasmonean dynasty
[12:38] a century later the roman conquered the
[12:40] region triggering two major revolts
[12:43] the great revolt from the year of 66 to
[12:45] 73 resulted in the destruction of the
[12:48] second temple and the downfall of
[12:50] jerusalem walls except for the western
[12:52] wall only the second major revolt from
[12:55] 132 to 135 led to the massive jewish
[12:58] depopulation as 580 000 jews were
[13:02] perished in battle not including those
[13:04] who succumbed to diseases and hunger
[13:06] after this war the jewish communities
[13:08] were devastated but the remaining
[13:10] population was strong and thriving in
[13:12] galilee where they migrated to after
[13:15] being barred from jerusalem
[13:17] the romans gave the name palestine to
[13:19] judea with a view to breaking the jewish
[13:21] connection with the land of israel
[13:24] during this time christianity which
[13:26] started off as a jewish sect ultimately
[13:28] became a distinct religion it was the
[13:31] dominant religion towards the end of the
[13:32] roman empire
[13:34] between the 4th and the early 7th
[13:36] century under the byzantine and
[13:38] visigoths empire the thriving jewish
[13:40] community in the mediterranean basin was
[13:42] subjected to the persecution and forced
[13:45] conversion to christianity
[13:47] after the birth of islam an arab
[13:49] conquest began and to some extent the
[13:51] jews support it in the hope of better
[13:53] conditions they were tolerated by the
[13:56] arabs forced conversion was only applied
[13:58] to polytheistic people
[14:00] the dome of the rock was built on the
[14:02] ruin of the second temple making
[14:04] jerusalem the holy city to three
[14:05] monotheistic religions judaism
[14:08] christianity and islam jewish
[14:11] communities were tolerated and gradually
[14:13] established all over western europe as
[14:15] the new millennium approached
[14:18] in 1099 christians in europe launched
[14:20] several crusades to bring the holy city
[14:22] back to the hands of the christians
[14:24] after christians in jerusalem were
[14:26] intensely persecuted by the seljuk turks
[14:29] a central asian people with a strong
[14:30] desire for the expansion on their way
[14:33] they massacred the jews who they
[14:35] considered to be killers of jesus
[14:37] between 1346 and 1353 the jews were
[14:41] scapegoated as the cause of black death
[14:43] the disease that killed half of the
[14:45] european population in just five years
[14:48] they were accused of poisoning wells
[14:50] persecuted along the rhine and rhone
[14:52] region and eventually expelled
[14:55] after the reconquista ends in 1492 the
[14:59] expulsion in spain began and the ottoman
[15:01] empire became the main new land that the
[15:03] jews chose to settle in in nearly 30
[15:06] years from 1520 the walls of jerusalem
[15:09] were rebuilt and the jewish population
[15:11] in jerusalem expanded
[15:13] during the 16th century the
[15:15] polish-lithuanian commonwealth adopted
[15:17] favorable migration policies making it a
[15:20] new haven for the jews from western
[15:21] europe
[15:22] in the early 17th century about half of
[15:25] the world's jewish population settled in
[15:27] the region
[15:29] however the kumalnitsky uprising in
[15:31] ukraine between 1648 and 1654 changed
[15:35] everything
[15:36] being accused of having a privileged
[15:38] relationship with those in power the
[15:40] jews were slaughtered in less than two
[15:42] years the ukrainians killed between one
[15:44] hundred thousand to three hundred
[15:46] thousand jews and spread their massacres
[15:48] to other countries over the next ten
[15:50] years
[15:51] toward the end of the eighteenth century
[15:53] the polish-lithuanian commonwealth
[15:55] weakened and eventually collapsed the
[15:57] russians acquired its territories the
[16:00] jewish community was divided and nine
[16:02] hundred thousand jews were in the
[16:04] russian empire unwelcomed
[16:06] during the first half of the 19th
[16:08] century the jews were cruelly killed in
[16:10] pogroms violent riots that demonstrated
[16:12] the russians anti-jewish wave
[16:15] after that the immigration to the united
[16:17] states and western europe began
[16:20] there the living condition of the jews
[16:21] was vastly improved
[16:23] the first zionist congress in late 19th
[16:26] century took place and strived for the
[16:28] creation of a home that secured by law
[16:30] in palestine for jewish people
[16:32] this idea was fiercely opposed by the
[16:34] ottoman empire
[16:36] after world war one erupted the ottoman
[16:38] empire sided with the german empire in
[16:41] the effort of garnering support for the
[16:43] allies the british minister of foreign
[16:45] affairs issued the balfour declaration
[16:47] promising the jews a national home in
[16:49] palestine in return for the support from
[16:52] the zionist movement concurrently
[16:54] britain supported the great arab revolt
[16:56] against the ottoman empire by promising
[16:59] them independence in the liberated
[17:00] territories after world war one
[17:03] following the increasing jewish
[17:04] population in palestine jewish arab
[17:07] tension and violence escalated
[17:09] world war ii broke out and claimed
[17:11] almost 6 million lives of the jews in
[17:13] the holocaust
[17:15] after the war fierce opposition of jews
[17:17] and arabs prompted an overwhelm britain
[17:19] to withdraw from the region
[17:21] the u.n partition plan proposed to split
[17:23] this british mandate into an arab state
[17:26] a jewish state and the city of jerusalem
[17:29] right after the adoption of the plan due
[17:31] to the rejection of the arab league a
[17:33] civil war between the arabs and the jews
[17:36] broke out on may 14 1948 with the
[17:39] declaration of independence by david
[17:41] ben-gurion a jewish state the state of
[17:44] israel was established in response the
[17:47] arabs declared the first arab-israeli
[17:49] war from this year onwards israel has
[17:52] also engaged in various military
[17:54] conflicts including suez crisis six day
[17:57] war yom kippur war and two lebanon wars
[18:01] the israeli-palestine conflict which has
[18:03] its roots from the mid-20th century is
[18:06] still ongoing today
[18:07] also since the establishment of israel
[18:10] its jewish population has doubled as
[18:12] waves of jewish immigration landed on
[18:14] this territory
[18:16] despite the constant instability due to
[18:18] long-running conflicts amid political
[18:20] turmoil israel home of the largest part
[18:22] of the jewish world population has been
[18:25] thriving economically
[18:26] thank you for watching please like share
[18:29] and don't forget to subscribe to our
[18:31] channel for the daily update
[18:46] look at james now we're gonna paul we're
[18:48] gonna that brought us all the way up to
[18:49] date but going back to when james writes
[18:52] let's read it again together james
[18:55] chapter 1 verse 1 now you understand
[18:57] when he says a servant of god and of our
[19:00] lord jesus christ to the 12 tribes which
[19:03] are scattered abroad
[19:06] scattered abroad so this is the
[19:08] mediterranean jews that james is writing
[19:10] this to
[19:12] now
[19:13] it's amazing because there's always been
[19:14] this struggle when you look at jewish
[19:16] history
[19:17] of
[19:18] isolation too much isolation
[19:22] and too much too much assimilation
[19:25] and striking the balance in between
[19:27] those two
[19:29] is the struggle of not just jews but of
[19:32] believers
[19:34] because
[19:35] some jews chose to be like the jews in
[19:37] jerusalem who never left jerusalem and
[19:40] they stayed isolated huddled up
[19:42] in one spot
[19:45] and never left
[19:46] because there's a there's a sense of if
[19:49] we just close our sort of like the amish
[19:52] if we just close our ears and close our
[19:54] eyes and just keep everybody you know
[19:57] huddled up together you know in one
[19:59] commune then we're we're free from the
[20:02] outside invasion of things that don't
[20:05] align with our culture our or our
[20:08] beliefs sounds reasonable
[20:10] the problem is
[20:12] is that salvation
[20:14] the the people whose salvation is to
[20:16] come through is
[20:18] you and i
[20:20] and so it sounds reasonable except that
[20:22] the bible says who takes a candle
[20:26] and sits it under a bush so that no one
[20:28] can see it so under extreme isolation
[20:31] how are you going to save anybody
[20:34] amen
[20:35] and so people get isolated and they get
[20:38] into a little huddle and and you be that
[20:40] you you see the seeds of legalism even
[20:43] there
[20:44] and there's there's no there's there's
[20:46] no way for a jew to who who is going to
[20:49] come the redemption of the world there's
[20:51] no way for that to ever spread if
[20:53] they're so isolated then you have the
[20:56] jews not the jews who were isolated and
[20:59] they were they were they were they were
[21:01] um
[21:02] choking
[21:03] and preventing and hindering the gospel
[21:06] from spreading but then you have the
[21:09] jews who went into the world and lived
[21:11] amongst the people and lived that's why
[21:14] jews were you see from this video is
[21:16] they travel that's why jews you find
[21:18] jews in
[21:20] um in in seamstress and
[21:23] and and sowers why because you could
[21:25] pack up your goods
[21:26] because they were constantly on the move
[21:28] and traveling
[21:29] that's why you find jews as jewelers
[21:32] because the same exact reason some of
[21:34] the trades that they that the jews are
[21:36] in business are most popular with are
[21:38] things that are easy low impact they
[21:41] could pick up they can leave
[21:43] and so jews went into business and they
[21:45] were very successful in business very
[21:48] successful in fact in medieval uh times
[21:51] christians weren't allowed to uh to
[21:54] that's why the jews are in charge of the
[21:55] money in the banks because jews were
[21:57] allowed and permitted to handle the
[21:59] money and so
[22:01] it's a it's it's an isol jews who were
[22:04] isolated
[22:05] in a world unto themselves and then you
[22:08] have jews who went into the world and
[22:10] then they become assimilated to where
[22:13] you can't tell them apart from anybody
[22:15] else
[22:18] so because of the scattering abroad
[22:21] where they were scattered everywhere
[22:23] there's this sense of fear that we're
[22:25] gonna lose our culture we're gonna lose
[22:28] uh we're just
[22:30] we're just gonna fade off into history
[22:32] and so that's why you see the traditions
[22:34] held by truth by jews and rabbis to
[22:37] where jewish tradition is and they and
[22:39] even the some of the things that we we
[22:42] we were seeing in the video here about
[22:44] the dispersion some of the some of the
[22:47] the reason why
[22:49] religion or religious ceremony is so
[22:52] important to jews is a effort to not
[22:55] lose
[22:57] what they believe amongst their children
[22:59] and their grandchildren
[23:01] and so you have on one side them that
[23:04] get too isolated and on the other side
[23:06] them to get that they get too
[23:08] assimilated and they're like anybody
[23:09] else and if we're not careful as
[23:11] believers we could fall into one or
[23:13] those two categories ourself
[23:15] to where we're so isolated that we don't
[23:18] have anything to do with anybody
[23:20] yet we're the vessels of mercy and of
[23:22] grace for the gospel to come through us
[23:26] yet if you go the other way and you're
[23:28] too assimilated then how does the world
[23:30] even know and you become so much like
[23:32] the world that they can't tell you apart
[23:34] from anybody except the fact that you
[23:36] might come to church on sunday
[23:38] and then who do you invite
[23:42] hello somebody
[23:45] so there was always this struggle that
[23:47] you see here and this is james let me
[23:49] just get back to my text here james when
[23:51] he says he's right into the 12 tribes
[23:53] which are scattered abroad and uh
[23:55] greeting his nickname or he's given a
[23:57] name james the just what a wonderful
[24:01] name to be given
[24:03] to be just means to be fair
[24:06] he was a fair person he didn't favor
[24:08] anybody there was no favoritism
[24:11] god i'm thankful that god's given us
[24:13] good leaders and we should thank god for
[24:15] good leaders who are not favored
[24:17] favoritism to groups or to classes
[24:20] but are just we should be just we should
[24:22] be people who are just and fair
[24:25] equitable to everybody
[24:27] this is what james starts you see in
[24:30] some of his some of the verses you'll
[24:32] read especially in chapter one and two
[24:35] against the rich
[24:37] and so james is talking about the rich
[24:39] how that you they would they would
[24:41] literally have
[24:42] people who had more money and let me
[24:44] just say this by the way by new
[24:46] testament standards everyone in this
[24:47] room is rich
[24:51] right by new testament standards by new
[24:54] testament church standards were all the
[24:55] rich who jesus said it was impossible
[24:58] you imagine the deceitfulness of riches
[25:00] and it's an impossible for a rich man to
[25:02] enter into the into the kingdom of
[25:04] heaven and james covers this exact same
[25:07] thing because there was a sense of of
[25:10] there was there was deceitfulness but
[25:12] there was a false sense of security
[25:15] to those who had wealth
[25:18] and so james says you allow the people
[25:20] to come into your churches and you seat
[25:22] the rich in the front then you let the
[25:24] poor just go into the
[25:26] you know sit somewhere in the back
[25:28] and so he's crying out against that kind
[25:30] of favoritism to say you you shouldn't
[25:33] do that because the rich and the poor
[25:35] there's no classes in the kingdom of god
[25:37] there's they're no more important and
[25:39] riches has a sense of
[25:40] of uh the bias why the bible calls it
[25:42] the deceitfulness has a way to deceive
[25:45] people into believing that they're
[25:47] somehow because of their money they're
[25:49] successful and then those who don't have
[25:51] money are somehow not successful or a
[25:54] failure in life
[25:56] you see how deceiving that is
[26:01] it's amazing because
[26:04] when you look at the life of
[26:06] of of james
[26:07] and the bible called the the the
[26:10] scripture calls him and his nickname
[26:12] even another another nickname that i
[26:14] can't pronounce
[26:15] that he's given if you studied his
[26:17] history through josephus it means a
[26:19] bulwark
[26:20] he's a he's a pillar in so much that
[26:23] he's he's put as the overseer of the
[26:26] jewish of the church in jerusalem
[26:28] and he's he's he is he's he holds that
[26:32] position he's even called an apostle
[26:34] in galatians chapter one he wasn't one
[26:36] of the twelve but he's made an overseer
[26:40] by the apostles
[26:42] and and throughout his entire
[26:44] life until the time he dies he remains
[26:46] in that position now he dies
[26:49] in a.d
[26:50] 62. and so his you read the account of
[26:54] him as a martyr and there's multiple
[26:57] accounts that you can read uh of james
[27:00] and his martyrdom and i'm just going to
[27:01] cover just a minute just for a minute
[27:03] here before we
[27:04] close but he's the the bible or the
[27:08] history records that he dies
[27:10] in a.d 62.
[27:13] i'm not going to pronounce some of these
[27:15] names right so you scholars will have to
[27:17] forgive me i'm just going to give it my
[27:19] southern english
[27:21] um hegesippus which is a second century
[27:24] christian and there's not a lot known
[27:26] about him but he's quoted by
[27:28] in the in in
[27:30] in the
[27:31] ecclesiastical history volume two if you
[27:33] look at chapter 23 it gives the account
[27:36] of his
[27:36] of of of his martyrdom
[27:39] and it's incredible because
[27:41] you look at what
[27:43] i'm just going to read literally i'm
[27:45] going to read verbatim this account from
[27:46] history josephus also if you're if you
[27:49] ever study or look at the writings of
[27:51] josephus a jewish historian he covers
[27:54] also an account of the martyrdom of
[27:57] james and it's pretty incredible
[27:59] because james and i'm just going to read
[28:00] it here for a moment
[28:02] but james uh there's there's a gap in
[28:06] between roman rulers and in that gap
[28:08] where there's uh no ruler that was
[28:11] benevolent or kind to the jews they
[28:14] murdered james and i'm just going to
[28:16] read some of it here so just bear with
[28:18] me i would have put it on the screen but
[28:21] but i didn't have time
[28:22] it says after a while james influence
[28:24] became so strong that even some of the
[28:27] rulers believed which horrified the
[28:29] scribes and pharisees
[28:30] they became afraid that soon the people
[28:32] would be flocking to jesus as the christ
[28:35] somehow perhaps because of his strict
[28:38] observance to the law the pharisees
[28:41] thought they could get james to
[28:42] discourage the people from believing
[28:44] they asked him to stand at the pinnacle
[28:46] of the temple on passover and speak this
[28:50] is amazing because where did in the
[28:52] wilderness did satan take jesus
[28:55] to the pinnacle of the temple remember
[28:59] and he says cast yourself down
[29:02] throw yourself down for surely the
[29:04] angels will bear thee up and not allow
[29:06] thee to dash thy foot and that would
[29:08] have been true for jesus it wasn't true
[29:10] for james james was going to be cast
[29:13] from that pinnacle and and he was going
[29:15] to die
[29:17] now this is this is just one account of
[29:19] many of the early christians who
[29:21] suffered
[29:22] and were martyrs
[29:24] for the name of christ
[29:26] it goes on it says they asked him to
[29:28] stand at the pinnacle apparently james
[29:30] agreed they brought him to the top of
[29:32] the temple and they shouted to him from
[29:34] below o righteous one
[29:37] in whom we are able to place great
[29:39] confidence
[29:40] the people are let us stray after jesus
[29:43] the crucified ones so declare to us
[29:46] what is this way
[29:48] jesus
[29:49] obviously there wasn't obviously this
[29:51] wasn't a very wise thing for them to do
[29:53] james was ready to take full advantage
[29:56] of such a wonderful opportunity as this
[29:59] his words are memorable
[30:01] mrs james why do you ask me about jesus
[30:04] the son of man
[30:06] he sits in heaven at the right hand of
[30:09] the great power and he will soon come on
[30:11] the clouds of heaven the pharisees were
[30:14] horrified but the people were not they
[30:16] begin shouting hosanna the son of david
[30:19] the pharisees realizing the awful
[30:21] mistake they'd made begin crying out oh
[30:24] the righteous one is also an error so
[30:27] they they tried to set him up to go to
[30:29] the top of the temple and denounce jesus
[30:31] but james says this is a perfect
[30:33] opportunity to spread the gospel and he
[30:35] begins to to to what we just read here
[30:38] is he begins to preach to the people and
[30:40] now the pharisees horrified says the
[30:42] righteous one also is an error
[30:45] you can probably guess that this had
[30:47] little effect on the crowd so the next
[30:49] obvious thing to do was to push him down
[30:52] from the temple letting the people know
[30:54] exactly what happens to those who dare
[30:56] to believe in jesus
[30:58] they climbed the temples as the people
[31:00] shouted reach the they they climbed the
[31:02] temples the temple as the people shouted
[31:05] reached the top and threw james from the
[31:07] pinnacle of the temple it didn't kill
[31:10] him
[31:11] he rose to his knees
[31:14] and this is amazing because this is from
[31:16] four accounts you could read four
[31:18] accounts of history and all four
[31:21] different from different writers all had
[31:23] the same exact and agree on the same
[31:25] exact account
[31:27] of the death of james
[31:30] he rose to his knees and began to pray
[31:32] for them
[31:34] i beg of you this is james
[31:37] lord god our father forgive them
[31:40] they do not know what they are doing
[31:44] this would not do the pharisees on the
[31:46] ground begin to stone him as he prayed
[31:48] while those from the roof rushed down to
[31:50] join the execution
[31:53] one of the priests however a son
[31:55] mentioned by jeremiah the prophet
[31:57] shouted stop what are you doing the
[31:59] righteous one is praying for you
[32:01] it was too late
[32:03] a fuller took out one of the clubs that
[32:05] he used to beat clothes and smashed
[32:08] james had james on the head
[32:10] killing him with one blow
[32:15] history goes on to record that is they
[32:17] take the body of james and here's here's
[32:20] the the jews and they take the body of
[32:22] james and for the first time they show
[32:25] is gideon still in the booth josh can
[32:27] you show that picture go ahead and show
[32:28] that they show james and they see his
[32:31] knees and this is the historical record
[32:34] that they they they commented and said
[32:37] his knees look like camel's knees you
[32:39] ever seen camel's knees
[32:42] this is what i had gideon bring up just
[32:44] a an image of this and if he gets it
[32:46] good you can if not you can google it on
[32:48] your phone camel's knees i thought that
[32:50] was incredible when i read that because
[32:52] i we don't have camels around here
[32:54] and i couldn't remember i always
[32:55] remember the picture of a camel when
[32:57] he's
[32:57] on the ground
