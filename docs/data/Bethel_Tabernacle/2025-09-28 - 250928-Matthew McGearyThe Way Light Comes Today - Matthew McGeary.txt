Um, I want to remember brother a special request from sister Elaine for her husband Dawn is not feeling quite right. Uh, sister Melissa has a fellow teacher that is uh just got diagnosed with breast cancer and uh so we want to pray for her. Um, I have a sister actually it's my in-laws on the other side of my oldest daughter's marriage. She was um going through chemo and things and was cleared of cancer a couple years ago and now she's back doing chemo again and um I just really feel burden for her. She lives in Montana. She doesn't really have she counts this as her home church. So I just want to remember her also and um I would like to welcome the guests also our visitors and stuff that God bless you richly. May this be a service that you can remember and that God has touched you and give you strength for the journey. Let's pray. Father, we love you this morning. And Lord, when I think of those that are not feeling well, battling cancer, Father, it can be such a debilitating disease going through the medical process, Father. And I just pray that you would help them, Lord. Remember our brother Dawn this morning. Father, touch his body, Lord, and be with Sharon as she's with this woman, Sylvia she lives with. Father, I pray that you would work that situation out. And Lord, Melissa's friend, fellow teacher. Lord, the devil is just seeking whom he may devour. But we come, Lord, you said you would raise a standard in this last day. And Father, we raise the standard of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ against these things. Father, your word, you said you would keep it. We believe it. And that settles that, Father. We commit these requests into your hands today. And Lord, we are expecting to hear from you. We pray that you would bless the brother, move him aside. And Lord, that we would open our hearts to receive what you have for us today. Yesterday's gone, tomorrow may never come, Father. But here we are in present tense. Help us to receive what you have for us, Father. As we collect the tithes and offerings, I pray that you would bless the cheerful giver, Father. Lord, we thank you for the bounty that you give us and we thank you and we ask you that you would help us to be diligent with that for your kingdom. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can move. You can have your seats as well. Thanks. [Music] &gt;&gt; James 4:8 says, "Draw nigh unto God and he will draw nigh unto you." Yes, &gt;&gt; I just want to draw nigh to him this morning and &gt;&gt; see what he'd have for us today. &gt;&gt; I draw nigh to thee. [Music] Draw thou nigh to me, Lord. fill my life till Christ is all you see. [Music] What did your blood purchase, Lord, as it flowed down that old rugged tree? Was redemption's price paid but for part? For your intention to have all of me, [Music] I draw nigh to thee. [Music] Draw thou nigh to me, Lord. fill my life &gt;&gt; till Christ is all you see. If there be anything, Lord, [Music] that would hinder communion with thee. Help me to cast it aside [Music] for it is nothing to me. [Music] Oh, I want to give you my all [Music] and be what you'd have me to be. [Music] I just long to be near you, Lord, and taste of your presence so sweet. I draw nigh to thee. Draw thou nigh to me Lord. Fill my life. &gt;&gt; Till Christ is all you see. Your presence falls down like rain. My soul rejoiceth to see your life as it blooms in my heart. [Music] Your nearness, oh God, changing me. I draw nigh to thee. Draw thou nigh to me, [Music] Lord. fill my life till Christ is all you see. Lord, fill my life [Music] till Christ is all you see. [Music] Amen. Appreciate that. Let's all stand to our feet this morning. Sweep over my soul. Sweep over my soul, sweet spirit. We want to turn our hearts now. Amen. To the Lord. Did you come with a need upon your heart? Maybe something you need the Lord to minister to. Amen. Why don't you raise that up and hold it up before the Lord? We come to see Jesus. Amen. That's why we gather. It's the only reason. We appreciate all of the the you know everybody here, but he's the he's the most important. He's the main thing as brother Brandham said. He's the main spring. So we we just want to make our brother Matthew feel welcome. Invite him to come at this time. Take his liberty. Sweep over my soul. Sweep over my soul. Sweet spirit, sweep over my soul. [Music] My rest is complete. While I sing at your feet, sweet spirit, sweep over my soul. Could you raise your hands and sing it like a prayer? Sweep over my soul. Sweep over my soul. Oh sweet spirit sweep overs that your prayer. Yes Lord. Oh my rest [Music] is complete while I sing at your feet. Sweet spirit, sweep over. One more time, let's tell him like a prayer. Oh, that is our Lord. Sweep my soul. Sweep my [Music] sweep over my soul. Oh my, what a song. I raise that truth. Oh hallelujah. While I sing at your feet, sweet spirit, sweep over my soul. Amen. God bless you today. Turn around, shake hands with somebody standing near you. Make them welcome. We got a number of visitors with us today. Amen. Happy to have all of you here in the house of the Lord. Amen. Always good to see a a church full of believers gathered around ready for the word of God. Are your hearts ready and prepared? Amen. I uh we're thrilled today. We got a banner day all day today. Wonderful time. Amen. Brother Matthew uh and Sister Gabrielle here with us with their family and we're happy to have them here with us. Amen. Our brother Matthew has actually preached with brother Matt McGary in services and u this will be today be my first time hearing him preach live as far as I remember. I'm pretty sure that's true. I think I've heard him speak before but uh as far as a full-on sermon expectations are high. I appreciate a brother who is well taught in the word and uh he said to me paid you all a nice compliment. He said, "I know I'm at a church who are well established in the word of God." Amen. So, we're thankful to God for that. Amen. Friends, if it wasn't for this message, we would have very little to say, very little to say. This would be just your average Sunday morning pullpit. And um there's value in that. But when you're when you're in the house of God and the true word and the full word is being proclaimed, you're guaranteed to hear things you won't normally hear in the average Sunday morning pull pit. So, we want to make Brother Matt feel completely welcome. Give him his complete liberty. I've already done that. I want you to have your hearts ready. Pull on the word of God. Amen. That you're the one, Brother Brandham said, you're the one operates the gift. See, the preacher gets himself out of the way. It's you pulling with your needs. Let's sing it again as we invite Brother Matt to the pull pit. Sweep over my soul. Sweep over my soul. Sweep over my soul. Sweet spirit. Oh yes. Sweet over my soul. [Music] &gt;&gt; My rest is complete. All I see at your feet, sweet spirit, sweep over my soul. Sing it again now. Sweep over my soul. Sweep over my soul. [Music] Sweep over my soul. Sweet spirit, sweep over my soul. [Music] For my rest is complete. Well, while I sit at your feet. [Music] sweep over my soul. Amen. Hallelujah. Is there anybody here that's ever felt his presence come by your way? And and you just say, "Lord, I want you to sweep over my soul once again." Just as we have the musicians, if they just continue to uh to play, maybe there's somebody here and you have a need, maybe in your body, maybe a lost loved one, and you want to be like Rahab and say, "I want to get them all in." &gt;&gt; It's going home time, church. I I I say uh the time of laying up treasures in this life should be over for the believer. You know, we get so focused on a new car and a new house and a better career and a better job and and we start to lose focus and and we get lulled to sleep by Lady Oia and and the grind and the race of everything. And I say, Lord, let's let's refocus this morning. And I want to say, you know, tomorrow's not guaranteed, &gt;&gt; but what we do have is right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to say there's nothing like his presence. You have an uplifted hand, a request, and we'll pray that the Lord will just sweep by. Once again, I want to tell you, there's nothing like his presence. &gt;&gt; There's nothing like when he comes &gt;&gt; to you personally. Oh, it might be wonderful of the outp point of the blessings in a group setting, but when he comes down to your row and your aisle and your chair, he starts to wrap his arms around you and say, "It's going to be all right. I I've been there the whole time. I know what you're going through and and I just want to talk to you a little bit. I want to talk to you a little while. I want to let you know that I got it all under control." Lord Jesus, we're so thankful &gt;&gt; to live a to serve a a living God. Not a God that's just some God way off yonder out in the space somewhere, but you're a present God right here, present with us, Lord. And you said, "I'll not only be with you, but I'll be in you until the end, Lord. There's been many hands that have been lifted up, Lord. There's needs in our body and in our lives, Lord. And Lord, many times there's needs that we don't even know we have. But as your word comes, you start to minister and to deal with our heart because your word is a discerner of the thought and intent of the heart. So Lord, may we just start to look to the supernatural this morning and get out of the routine as the prophet would say. Sometimes we got to get out of the routine long enough to get saved, Lord. And Lord, I say, Lord, come come to my aisle. Come to my chair, Lord. Father, even I'm standing behind the sacred desk, Lord, but I need more of you, Lord. I need more, Holy Ghost. I need more revelation, Lord. I need answers. I need direction. I need your leadership, Lord. And Father, I know you're here to do exceedingly abundantly more than we could ever think or ask. So, we just commit the preaching of the word to you, Lord. Ask that you would come, Lord, and break the bread of life as only you can, Lord. But I'm always reminded of that little boy who come and the multitudes were there and he just had a little fish and some little loaves. How could that Lord feed the multitude? But when it was placed into your hands, Lord, a little was enough. And it was more than enough. Lord, may as we would go from this place, Lord, may your word be more than enough. and may they have plenty to go share with those they come in contact with. Lord, we love you. We ask these blessings in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Praise the Lord. Wow. Just good to be in his presence. &gt;&gt; My what a what an honor and privilege. We thank you musicians. If you have your Bibles, we'll be reading out of John. I just want to say what a what a an honor and a privilege it is to stand here before you. I I just want to let you know I love Brother Jason uh and his ministry. &gt;&gt; I I've I've just always cherished it and marveled at at the gift of God and and we're just so thankful that God would place uh uh gifts in the body. We know that the five-fold ministry is for the edifying and the perfecting of the saints and I've I've had opportunity to minister uh with brother Matt and and uh I just come to know and appreciate him and his family and it's just good to be here. Are y'all interested in the word? &gt;&gt; I say, why don't we just relax oursel in his presence? &gt;&gt; I I want to tell you, I believe the message. &gt;&gt; And so, uh, I'm just going to preach the message. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Cuz, uh, as as brother Jason said, I I mean, I I ain't even the prophet said, I ain't got a thought coming. &gt;&gt; So, I I ain't none of this is mine. I'm just going to rehearse some things that's maybe familiar to you and maybe by the grace of God, the Holy Ghost will come by and just start speaking to each individual. We're reading in John chapter 8 and we'll read the first 12 verses there. I like to hear the the pages turning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All right. And early in the morning, he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him, and he sat down and taught them. The scribes and the Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery. When they had set her in the midst, my could you imagine? They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery in the very act. Now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned. But what sayest thou? This they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him. Oh my. Isn't Isn't Satan an accuser of the brethren? &gt;&gt; I say God forbid that we ever take up that spirit &gt;&gt; to be an accuser of our brothers and our sisters. Love covers a multitude of sin. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But Jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not. I tell you, sometimes that's what we got to do. &gt;&gt; So when they continued asking him, he lifted himself up and said unto them, "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her." And again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convict convicted by their own conscience, went out. And one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last, Jesus was left alone. And the woman standing in the midst. Isn't that amazing? All of her accusers were gone &gt;&gt; and she was just left standing alone. And there was only one. And when Jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman, he said unto her,"Woman, where are those thine accusers? &gt;&gt; Hath no man condemned thee?" She said, "No man, Lord." And Jesus said unto her, "Neither do I condemn thee. Go and sin &gt;&gt; no more." Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. Amen. You may be seated. I hope it's all right to take off my jacket, but I I I I have come to know Brother Jason and brother Matt well, so I'm just going to make myself at home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say this in shalom. He would say, "The Son is the word of God. In the beginning, God said, "Let there be light." And when the manifested word of God, when the word of God was manifested, there was light. First, God spoke it. What if it didn't manifest? Then it wasn't light yet. But when he spoke it and then it was manifested, vindicated, his word was vindicated. Light come into existence. And that's the only way it can be done now is when the word is vindicated. God's written word vindicated. Then it shows light. It it's it's a portion is lit or put out for each age. We find in the church ages. We find in the Old Testament church ages, each time that there come a time for a certain manifestation of the journey, there was a prophet come on the earth and the word came to the prophet and he made that word live. And when that word was identified, it reflected God and there was the age, there was the light and that's the way light comes today. And that's what I'd like to minister to you on is the way light comes today. So the word came to the prophet and he made that word live. It was light to the age. And in John 1 and6, it would say there was a man sent from God whose name was John. The same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe. And then John uh Christ would come back in John 5:35 and he would say speaking of John, he say he was a burning and shining light and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. And as we just moved to to lay in a foundation, brother Brandham says this further in shalom. He says John was the light. He was more light than Elijah and them had. Elijah, he wasn't Elijah's light, but he was Elijah in another form of vindicating the light. See, he was. And when Jesus come, he said he was a burn, a bright and shining light for a season. You love to walk in his light. See, and John said, "Now I must dim out. I must go out. My light's finished shining." Ain't that something? And he said, "I must go out. He must increase. He's the light." And he said, "I am the light of the world." Right? Amen. That's right. The same yesterday, today, and forever. He's still the light of the world. And what is he? In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God. Why? Why? Why was he the light of the world? If he'd come and said he was the Messiah, and he didn't do like the Bible said the Messiah would do, then he wasn't the light of the world. See, it's the vindicated word that makes it the light of the world. The prophet showing you that all the prophets and everybody that had spoke of what the Messiah would be, here come the word. In the beginning was the word and the word was made flesh and the word uh uh dwelt among us. And so if he was the Messiah, then he would be fulfilling the scriptures that was spoken of the Messiah to do. Yes. &gt;&gt; And if he was the Messiah, then he would be doing and fulfilling that word that was spoken. And so, we're understanding the principle that he's throwing out here that the word of God made manifest is the light. And and we could take some time, we had to cut away from some things, but the prophet of God would talk about how Moses was the light of his hour. And a and just maybe just to throw this in there to anchor this down, the prophet of God would say Moses might have not even known himself. But he was the anointed word of the day. He was the anointed messenger. So if he was the messenger of the hour, he was the Messiah of the hour. He was the anointed one. So So I just showing in the principle just as the scripture said, I'll send a deliverer. And you know, as Abraham knew his people would sojourn for 400 years, but God would send a deliverer. So when Moses came, Moses now was the vindicated word. Moses was light to the people. &gt;&gt; He was the anointed word. And brother Brandon would go so far to say that he was the Messiah of the hour because it was the word of God being manifested to the people. It was God's deliverance. It was God's life. It was God's provided way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we could we could run through types and shadows and and we laid in that quote talking about John. John was the life. Uh but what what ultimately was he doing? He was introducing the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we know that Jesus was the anointed word, &gt;&gt; is the anointed word. &gt;&gt; He is the anointed Messiah. &gt;&gt; But I just maybe jumping because I I I uh I I I just want to move quickly. Now with all of this in mind, we we look at the types and the shadows in the Old Testament and and moving all the way up. And now uh uh uh Christ, he's fulfilling all that was spoken. &gt;&gt; Right. Every prophecy, everything uh uh uh concerning as he came to the earth was being fulfilled in his earthly ministry. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. And now here here's here's Christ speaking to his disciples. And and like I said, I'm so thankful that you're well taught. So I I know I'm I'm jumping and jumping and and there's so much we could lay in there. Uh but uh now now think of this here here in John 16:7. Nevertheless, I tell you the truth. It is expedient for for you that I go away. &gt;&gt; For if I go not away, the comforter will not come unto you. &gt;&gt; But if I depart, I will send him unto you. &gt;&gt; It's better. It's it's more profitable that I go away. Could you imagine sitting there? If we were standing here, here's the Lord Jesus and everything we've been believing for and looking for. My this this is the Messiah. All the prophets in Malachi and Isaiah and Moses, they all spoke of the one that's coming, our redeemer, our Messiah. He He's taken on flesh. He's standing in our midst. Here he is, &gt;&gt; but I got to go away. &gt;&gt; I I got to leave. And that's profitable. &gt;&gt; How is that a good thing, Lord? You're everything we've been looking for. You're you're everything that we ever needed. We left our jobs. We We left our careers. We left our family members. We left everything to follow you. And now you're telling me that you're going away. How is that profitable? Lord, I don't understand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, what what are you wanting to do? What? I I I can't understand this because what is he wanting to do? It's profitable that I go away. It's a better thing. &gt;&gt; If I could say it like this, I see the Lord standing there. See this body that you see now, you're not going to see this body again until the meeting in the air, but I'm going away. But I am coming back to you. &gt;&gt; The same spirit that's in this body, this body's going away. But I want to come back and I want to use your body. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Look, I I've taken on on form and in this in this flesh and in this body, but I I want to go away because I just don't want to fulfill the word in this body. I want to fulfill the word in your body. I I want to come down in a many member bride body and I want to manifest the written word. I want to manifest the spoken word. It's profitable that I go away because I want to come again in you. &gt;&gt; Oh, I just want to lay this in there because the prophet of God would say this. He says, I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of the son of man in human flesh in the bride's body accept his call. I say, Lord, I don't understand maybe how everything is going. And as those disciples were saying there, Lord, I don't know how that's profitable. But I say one thing, Lord. I want to accept your call. &gt;&gt; I I mean, hey, maybe maybe we've done a lot of learning and maybe we've been real educated. Maybe we know what the prophet said, but I say we want to accept his call and not just intellectually by a revelation, by a translation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, then Jesus would say this. So, we understand that he is the light. But he comes and says in Matthew 5:14, "Ye are the light of the world." A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. And I just as I was reading that scripture, I I got to thinking, "Oh my, a city that is set on a hill." And I got to thinking about the new Jerusalem. And and in Revelations, John would say, I saw the new Jerusalem coming down out of heaven like a bride adorned for his husband. I want to tell you, uh, you are that city. You are that new Jerusalem. And we have been set up on a rock of revelation. In the time of trouble, I shall set you up upon a rock. Oh, we have received the opening of the word, a revelation. You are that city. &gt;&gt; I say each one of you, you ought to accept his call that he wants to be Christ, the anointed word, &gt;&gt; the son of man ministry in your body. Oh, brother Matthew, that was just for the prophet. No, Jesus said it's expedient that I go away. That might have been a first one to maturity, but he ran his race. He ran his course. He He's already gone home to his reward. He's gone away. But now God is saying, just as I manifested myself in a first one to maturity, it was only testifying of the wheat field that I have planted. &gt;&gt; And you are that seed. You are that word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are that new Jerusalem. You are You have been lifted up. You've been raised up out of Lady of Sea. Out of out of the dead traditions of denominations, you've been set up upon a rock. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not This bride is not wondering and and where am I going? What am I supposed to do? And uh who are we? And look, we know what we're doing. &gt;&gt; We know where we're going. We have thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word being vindicated in our lives. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; And when that word that was spoken takes on flesh in you, &gt;&gt; that's the vindicated word. &gt;&gt; Oh, I got too much. I got I got Christ the mystery of God revealed. I got the invisible union. &gt;&gt; When that word &gt;&gt; takes on flesh in you, it is light. It's the vindicated word. &gt;&gt; And Jesus would say now in Matthew 5:16, "Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look, this book right here is not going to walk off the pulpit. &gt;&gt; Come on. This book right here is not going to walk off the pulpit and go to your job. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to take the book. &gt;&gt; You got to eat the book. And your life must prophesy again. &gt;&gt; Hey, it ain't good enough just to quote the quotes. You got to live this message. And I want to tell you, it ain't a bunch of rules and regulations and dos and don'ts and if you do this, I'll do that. Oh, I want to tell you I I just comes to mind. God made an unconditional covenant with Abraham. It wasn't about what Abraham could do. It was about what God promised. And God promised, I'll have a bride without spot or angel. It ain't about what I can do. It's about what I can surrender myself to and let him have his way. &gt;&gt; You got to take the book and eat it up. &gt;&gt; We are written epistles known and read of all men. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, "The real way to testify is not in the church. &gt;&gt; It's out in dark places. &gt;&gt; Let your shine, let your light shine where it's dark. Go to the road houses and different places and where sin and things is heaping and then let your light shine. There is the place to do it. &gt;&gt; Uhoh. &gt;&gt; My we we want to be a good Christian on Sunday. We want to be a good Christian on Wednesday. We want to testify to the brothers. We want to testify to the sisters. But what about your coworker? &gt;&gt; What about your neighbor? What about the store clerk at the gas station? See, we want to we want to let our light shine where it can't be seen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I believe according to the message of the hour, the pillar of fire is here this morning. &gt;&gt; Because each one of us bring our licks of fire. We bring a portion of the pillar of fire and we all come together. There's a great burning light swirling right now in Buford, South Carolina. &gt;&gt; When I say right now, we sit in a place where all things are possible. &gt;&gt; But we live in a dying world, a dying generation. Darkness, gross darkness upon the people. But arise and shine. Thy light has come. &gt;&gt; You are the light. &gt;&gt; So how are they going to see the light? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, that might not be popular, but &gt;&gt; you know, I I remember the prophet of God said, you know, how many how many have the Holy Ghost? How many have the Holy Ghost? Okay, h we'll see if you have it or not. How many sigh and cry for the abominations? &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz the ink the the the writer with the ink rider is going around market. I said, "Oh, God, forgive me." &gt;&gt; I I'm just I I don't even care for lost souls, you know? I I go to work and I just want my paycheck and I want to go raise my kids and go on a rapture. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine if Jesus Christ came to this earth and he said, "Well, I come to do my job, so where's my cross?" &gt;&gt; Not even interested. &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I say we got to have the love of God shed abroad in our heart. &gt;&gt; The word manifested is light. You are the light of the world. Look, I I I don't I don't think he's just a savior. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know he's a savior. &gt;&gt; I I don't think he's just a healer. I I I know that he's a healer. I I just don't think he is a deliverer. I know because I've been delivered. &gt;&gt; I I tell you, you know, I you don't have to uh uh when it's become a reality to you, you're not just rehearsing something that you've heard. &gt;&gt; Look, has anybody ever been shocked or electrocuted? &gt;&gt; Now, what? Explain to me what that feels like. It's kind of hard to do it. &gt;&gt; But if you've ever been electrified, you know you've been electrified. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you, if you ever been saved, you know you've been saved. If you've ever been delivered, you know you've been delivered. And I want to say, if you've ever been set free from sin, oh, it sets your soul on fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The word says it is the spirit that quickenth. &gt;&gt; The flesh profiteth you nothing, but the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life. The prophet of God said, life comes only by the word of God made manifest. He said, as long as it's just in the book like this, it can still be questioned. &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you a lot of times you can go witness to people and you can go out and and you can tell people uh that God sent a prophet and and you can you can give them a track and and I want to tell you but you know what they can always question that &gt;&gt; but I tell you one thing they can't question &gt;&gt; I once was lost &gt;&gt; but now I'm found. I once was blind but now I see. You can question a lot of things like that blind man on that day. They they said, "Oh, oh, give God praise. &gt;&gt; Tell us. We we we know that man is a sinner." &gt;&gt; And he looked at them. He said, "Look, I I don't know whether he's a sinner or whether he's not a sinner." And nowadays, they're all trying to trying to raise questions. Well, is he a true prophet or is he a false prophet? Well, all I can tell to you is you can call them whatever you want to call them, but I once was lost, but now I'm found. I once was blind, but now I see. This book was once closed, but now it's open. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You can question a lot of things, but you qu can't question my revelation. &gt;&gt; It's mine. That's why you want to you you know the best way to witness is tell your tell how your candle got lit. &gt;&gt; Because you you can you can give them a bunch of information. &gt;&gt; But you know what somebody wants to see? They they they want to see something real. &gt;&gt; They want to see something genuine. They want to see something. Hey, if God did that for you, &gt;&gt; he can do that for me. But just it's good to give information and seow seed. I I say there's nothing wrong with that at all. But I say you ought to get to a place where you can let your light shine. &gt;&gt; You can't question that. &gt;&gt; I I don't I don't think this message is Christ. &gt;&gt; I know this message is Christ. &gt;&gt; I know it's the anointed word. I know it's God's provided way. I know it's taken me into my body change. I know it's taken me into a rat. Look, you can question a lot of things and a lot of men have fallen away because it's harvest time. Those seeds have to manifest who they are. But oh, there is another seed. There is the royal seed of Abraham and they have heard from their theophony and they also are manifesting the very spoken word of God and ye are the light. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now in 1 John 15 and 6 just speaking along those lines he says this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Friends, there's no darkness in the word of God. &gt;&gt; There is no darkness in the revealed word that we've received. There is no darkness in the the message of Malachi 4:5, Luke 17:30. &gt;&gt; Look, you you might have questions and I want to say questions are good to have unless you're questioning its authority. &gt;&gt; You know, I I've witnessed to people and uh and they they they didn't have any questions. Uh that's actually kind of alarming. &gt;&gt; They're like they're just good with everything. I mean, yeah, you know, you're just &gt;&gt; and it doesn't take them anywhere. &gt;&gt; But somebody that's hungry and searching, &gt;&gt; you Anybody ever look for a good restaurant to eat at? &gt;&gt; You got questions. &gt;&gt; Well, what does what does Yelp say about? I don't know about Yelp. Can I trust you? I'm going to look on Google. Well, you know, you know, Brother Matt, this one got 4.6 stars and this one's 5 4.5 4.6. Oh, but this one gots more reviews than that one. And and well, why what are some of the bad reviews in there? Oh, it's because of the weight. there. All the bad reviews are because they had to wait an hour for the food. That means that's good food. &gt;&gt; That's not a bad review. That's a good review. Hey man, the food's so good you can't even get in there. &gt;&gt; But you want to have if somebody's telling you, "Hey, take this. This is really good. Eat it. Eat eat it." Well, what has it done for you? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; How many times have you eaten there? Or every time in the air, I tell you what, that's actually a destin. I go out out of my way to eat there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why you come this morning. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; While the rest of the world is sleeping in and watching their ball games, you've got a hold of some mana. You've come in behind the veil. You're shut away in a secret place in a hidden life. You say, "Lord, give me that hidden mana. I want more. I've tasted. Oh, taste and see that the Lord, I can't get enough of this. &gt;&gt; Give me some more. Give me some more. You get people that are uh church hopping and bouncing all over the place expecting some man to feed them. I tell you what, if you can get past the veil just one time and come into his presence and the angel of the Lord come and start feeding your soul with the revealed word of the eye, it'll sustain your wants. It'll sustain your desires. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; then you can be God to a church. &gt;&gt; So many people just want to go to the church and have the church fix their problems. pastor, fix my life. Fix my marriage. &gt;&gt; I got a bunch of problems. Well, praise God, we got God called Cold, man. But that's just a vessel. &gt;&gt; And the only thing he wants to do is introduce you to Christ. &gt;&gt; And I've said it again. I I said it before and I'll say it again. You know, I don't think when those disciples busted out of the upper room on the day of Pentecost, they didn't need no counseling. Amen. &gt;&gt; They were so filled with the Holy Ghost, they could stand there and say, "I am the light of the world. This is that which the prophet Joel spoke of. I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh." And I want to say, if that same spirit that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead, dwell in you, it will quicken your life. It will quicken your thoughts. It will quicken your marriage. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I haven't lost my mind. I know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; It ain't just in a book. &gt;&gt; It's in my soul. It's in my life. It's in my mind. It's in my thoughts. It's on my lips. &gt;&gt; It's in my car. &gt;&gt; It's on my computer. It's in my phone. It's in my marriage. It's in my kids. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; The only person that should need counseling around you is the devil. &gt;&gt; I got a quote &gt;&gt; that a man could be so surrendered &gt;&gt; till the devil don't know what to do with you &gt;&gt; now. Quit acting like that's a challenge if you can do that &gt;&gt; and start recognizing it's a promise that you will. Wow. &gt;&gt; Look, it was impossible for Abraham and Sarah to have a child, &gt;&gt; but he judged him faithful who gave the promise and he was strong in faith. &gt;&gt; Giving glory unto God. &gt;&gt; Well, then don't sherk back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Devil, &gt;&gt; you're not going to know what to do with me &gt;&gt; because &gt;&gt; the word is becoming flesh &gt;&gt; and the flesh is becoming word &gt;&gt; and I'm becoming so much like the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; We are one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have a ministry. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, if you come to church like that, it's like I tell people in situations, you know, somebody got to be God in the situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, brother said that and this brother said somebody somebody got to be the word. &gt;&gt; Somebody somebody got to be God. &gt;&gt; No one wants to be God. &gt;&gt; Everybody wants everybody else to be God. Well, man, if they would just be a real message believer, &gt;&gt; if they really believed the message, &gt;&gt; if they really had a revelation, &gt;&gt; if they really caught the opening of the word, &gt;&gt; well, praise God, the prophet didn't act like that. &gt;&gt; We got to let our light shine. &gt;&gt; Give me something big &gt;&gt; to shine my light in. Okay, I will. Children, sweep the floor. &gt;&gt; Hey, I got kids here. &gt;&gt; Sweep the floor. &gt;&gt; Do the dishes. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about, preacher? That's shining your light. &gt;&gt; Well, well, well, give me the big things. &gt;&gt; It wasn't too big for the prophet &gt;&gt; to come home. &gt;&gt; The wife's nervous and frustrated. Kids are all crying and everything. &gt;&gt; He come in and what did he do? He was in his position. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh. Oh. We We want the big great things to do, &gt;&gt; but we want our our wife to keep the home and fix all the problems. Honey, I worked all day. Will you Where's my dinner? Why the kids fussing? &gt;&gt; I've worked all day. Yeah, you worked eight hours. She works 24/7. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Honey, I'm going hunting. &gt;&gt; Where are we at? Let's get out of here. But no, you're called to be in your position and shine your light in the home. &gt;&gt; Shine your light on them dirty dishes. Shine the light on them dirty floors. Make your bed. Pick up the trash. Mow the lawn. Be a real Christian. Clean your truck. &gt;&gt; Act like what you got, God gave it to you. We treat the things that good that's been given to us like we got it from the devil. Like we got it from Lady. Like we we got it from the from from somewhere else. We treat it like garbage and throw it in the corner. Can I say, man, if God's blessed you with a car, if he's I don't care if it's an apartment in the hood, you ought to keep it so clean and spotless &gt;&gt; that when somebody would come in there, they would say, "My it's a nice place to be." Oh, just like the prophet one day, there was a woman crying out for her boy. She said, "Oh, God, I I I was like that uh that woman that had that child that was dying, and she said, "Where's my Elijah? And he come down into the hood and he was walking down there and there as he was saying as your mother was hanging there on the fence said good morning parson he said when he come into that home oh that was a home where somebody knew how to pray &gt;&gt; I don't care if you got a a 25,000 foot home if God ain't in it ain't a good place to be. But if you got a 5x5 sale and you've been locked up, if Jesus Christ is in there, that's a place I want to be. &gt;&gt; I don't know where we're at, but we're going to come. Let your light shine. &gt;&gt; Take care of the things that God gave you. &gt;&gt; Minister to your wife. Minister your kids. You kids, you ain't too young to minister to your parents. Your battlefield is in your home. Your battlefield is in school. &gt;&gt; Look, friends, we're going in a body change. We're going in a rapture. &gt;&gt; And you young, you young men, this message is not above you. &gt;&gt; You are the message. You young ladies, God's interested in you. He wants to fill you and use you to sweep on the coming of the Lord. Look, I want to tell you I out there in the world, if it's gotten so dark and so grim that 10 year olds are committing murder. &gt;&gt; So much so 8-year-olds and six-year-olds, they're being possessed by devil spirits. I say if if the devil can do that out in the world, what about the revealed word of the hour? Have we not a message of the hour to get our family under the token where they can be born again and filled with the Holy Ghost? Our 5year-olds, our sixy olds, Amen. &gt;&gt; Look, if the devil's able to get him that young, &gt;&gt; there ain't no age too young. &gt;&gt; So much so that the Bible says that John the Baptist was filled with the Holy Ghost from his mother's womb. So, I don't know how it's going to happen, but I believe when that sweet comes, even if it's the baby in your womb, &gt;&gt; in a moment, in a twinkling of eye, we're all going to be changed. &gt;&gt; We got to let our light shine. Church, &gt;&gt; let it shine in the community. Let it shine in your house. Let it shine in the dark places. &gt;&gt; You can question a lot of things, but oh my, when it's made real in you, there's no darkness in this word. Going on and reading that scripture, 1 John 1 and6. Now he says, "If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie &gt;&gt; and do not the truth." Well, I know we don't like that. &gt;&gt; But it's the word. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "If you don't have works with your faith, it shows you haven't got faith. You're just talking from your mouth." &gt;&gt; Well, I've met some of them. I I've met some people that are just talking from their mouth. You look, you you can you might be able to fool men, but you can't fool God. &gt;&gt; I said, you might be able to fool men, but you can't fool God. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus would would even stand there and say, "Oh, you hypocrites." &gt;&gt; Well, did the prophet Isaiah say, "You draw nigh with your mouth. You honor me with your lips, but what? Your heart is far from me." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You know, I think maybe we need to deal some some heart trouble in the church this morning. &gt;&gt; Yeah. What is it? It's heart trouble. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh. Oh. What are you talking about, preacher? Well, let me tell you. In Jeremiah 17:9, it says, "The heart is a deceitful is deceitful above all things." &gt;&gt; And desperately wicked, &gt;&gt; who can know it? &gt;&gt; I the Lord search the heart. I try the reigns even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings. Look, people honor the message. They honor the prophet. They quote the quotes. &gt;&gt; They go to church. &gt;&gt; But I want to ask you, where's the life? &gt;&gt; Where's the good works? &gt;&gt; Where's the fruit of the spirit? By this you will know that they are my disciples, &gt;&gt; by their backbiting, &gt;&gt; by their gossiping, &gt;&gt; by their questioning one another, by their pointing fingers at one another, &gt;&gt; by their their good deeds and how much uh they've given to charity. &gt;&gt; No. By their perfect record at church. &gt;&gt; I get to church 20 minutes early. to have you to know. And I go to church three times a week. And little did you know that third one I'm talking about cuz we're only open uh Wednesday and Sunday, but I stream also for extra credit. I am a real message believer. &gt;&gt; That's good. By this, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; they will know &gt;&gt; that ye have love one for another. &gt;&gt; What did Paul say? Oh, if if if if I had the gift of prophecy, if I knew all the mysteries, if I had faith to remove mountains, &gt;&gt; but you don't have charity. &gt;&gt; It doesn't profit you anything. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what Jesus says. Oh, I shouldn't say exactly, but Jesus also says this in Matthew 7:20. He says, "Wherefore, by their fruits you shall know them." &gt;&gt; By their fruits. Does anybody know what that means? &gt;&gt; Means by their fruits. &gt;&gt; You should know them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But see, I I it's not it's not just you can't make it, oh h just so uh uh structured and oh, we go to church and we believe the same thing. No, the Sadducees and Pharisees would have had us all beat &gt;&gt; by their fruits. You know, I what I do for a profession is I'm a certified arborist, a tree doctor. You know, I I I cut trees, trim trees, plant trees, treat trees, you know, if they're sick. We we, you know, the people call the tree doctor. I go out there and look at the tree and and we try to diagnose and what's wrong with it. And, you know, and sometimes uh uh you know, there might be a tree that's uh sprouting up. You know, it can be very hard to tell what a tree is uh when it first starts to grow. You know, it could be a little sapling there and and you can see the see the leaves just starting to bloom out and it it can be very difficult, you know, to to try to to determine what it is. You're like, maybe that's an elm tree. Maybe that's an oak tree. I And you know, as you maybe can discern or you you learn more about plants, you can start to identify them even in their even in their uh seed form or even even in their infancy as they just start to sprout up, you can actually, oh, I know that that I know what that is. And and so I'll come out there on the job site and and I'll go around and and and I'll look at a tree and I'll say, "You're an apple tree." Or I'll say, "Uh, we don't got no apple trees out there, but uh you know, you got apple trees around here." Man, that's nice. We can't grow anything over there. No fruit trees. But you can tell them by their fruits. We got some pears out there. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you can't identify it by its leaves and you can't identify it by its bark, you can identify it by its fruit &gt;&gt; because you know them by their fruit, you know. And one one day I was just I was just thinking about that, you know. I was, you know, just thinking about how I'll go around and I and and and I'll I'll say you you you are an apple tree. And I'm there calling and and telling what that tree was and then it struck me because the trees are what? They're identified by their characteristics. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so I'm going around and I'm saying and and then it struck me. I'm not telling that tree what it is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm the tree doctor and you're an apple tree and and you're an oak tree. And then one day it struck me like, wait a second. I'm not the one telling what it is. &gt;&gt; The tree is declaring to me. &gt;&gt; It's telling me I'm an oak tree. Look at my big broad branches. Look at my my my the my the nuts and the fruit of the tree. I I I'm a I'm a live oak. Look over here. It's not like I'm not saying you're an apple tree. No, the apple tree is declaring I'm an apple tree. If you can't tell by my bark, if you can't tell by my limbs, if you can't tell by by the leaves, look at my fruit. I'm declaring to you, I'm an apple tree. Oh, and I say this message has come back to seed form again. You don't have to look at the bark. You don't have to look at the leaves. You can look at the fruit and you can say, "Hey, take a bite." The original word has come back to seed forth in the bride again. It's come back to fruit. It's come back to seed. &gt;&gt; This bride ought to be declaring, I am the bride. I am going in a rapture. &gt;&gt; I am the word made flesh. I am justified. I am sanctified. I am filled with the Holy Ghost. [Applause] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe my words, believe my works, they testify. &gt;&gt; But as long as it's in a book, &gt;&gt; it can be questioned. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the way light comes today. &gt;&gt; When this word comes in you, &gt;&gt; you are the light. &gt;&gt; You know them by their fruits. The prophet of God said, "The world is one of the most chaotic times of darkness that it's ever stood in." And yet it's standing in again the most blessed light that ever did shine. &gt;&gt; And there is the difference is just like it was in the beginning. Now watch closely. When there was gross darkness upon the earth and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and said, "Let there be light." And God separated the light from the darkness. And I believe that we are now living in that hour again. That when God is separating light from darkness and he's present to the other side of the world, &gt;&gt; that the light might be made manifest. I just want to maybe lay this in here. What he said, the spirit of God moved. And I believe the spirit of God is moving upon your life by the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Amen. The light of this message, the light of the revealed word is pressing the darkness out of your life. We we were reading first John in verse 7. It says, "But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our text said, "I am the light of the world. He that followth me shall not walk in darkness." Friends, I want to tell you, follow the message. Follow the light. &gt;&gt; You can walk right out of the darkness. &gt;&gt; You can walk right out of your prison. &gt;&gt; You can walk right out of your depression. &gt;&gt; I look, this isn't a dead letter. We ain't a bunch of uh organized denominational Christians and we got some tag called the message and we got some emblem that's the pillar of fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh, get that out of your mind. This this is a living word. &gt;&gt; This is a living savior. This is a living Christ. And I want to tell you, he's right here right now to meet you in your need that the light of God's word can shine into your home, into your marriage, into your heart, into your depression. &gt;&gt; What have we gotten so messageified that we ain't got no problems? &gt;&gt; We We just try to act like we're good Christians and we ain't battling the word. God knows what you're doing on your cell phone. &gt;&gt; Some of you looking at pornography and some of you got Netflix and and you got all these apps and you're feeding on the things of the world and you come to church and say, "Bless God, we're going in the rapture." And you're living like the world. I say we need a real cleaning up from the pulpit to the back of the church. I want to go home. I want to go in a rapture. Lord, clean up my cell phone. Clean up my marriage. Clean up my home. I say, "Let's apply the token. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We got people taking communion. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't want to go there. &gt;&gt; Many are sick among you cuz we're not discerning the Lord's body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a living word. &gt;&gt; A bleeding bloody word. Yes. &gt;&gt; And when you catch a revelation, some of us just need to repent. &gt;&gt; We need to hear God Jesus Christ's first doctrine. Repent. &gt;&gt; Be born again. &gt;&gt; We got a lot of people that believe the message and they ain't even been born again. &gt;&gt; We filled our churches with it. We Oh, &gt;&gt; our young people, they they they if they grew up, they'd just be a good buyer. I ain't trying to be negative. We'll turn it to the positive. But if we're not careful, &gt;&gt; you young people, if you're not careful, it just becomes an idea or religion. Just like there's good Pentecostal kids. But I want to tell you, you got to get down in desperation. If you haven't, man, come to the altar. Pour your heart out. Say, I want to know the God of the Bible. I want to know the God of the message. I want to know the God of William Brandom. I want to know the God of my parents, of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I want a real living God. I want to be changed. I want to be born again. I don't want to keep going through cycles of death and revival. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The problem is that some of us like it too much. &gt;&gt; We kind of like &gt;&gt; going to church and getting washed up and then going home and back to our dainties. &gt;&gt; It reminds me of Isaiah 4, you know. Oh, say it says seven women laid hold of one man &gt;&gt; and said, "Let us eat our own bread, &gt;&gt; let us dress the way we want to, &gt;&gt; but only let us be called by your name. &gt;&gt; Just call me a message believer, Brother Jason. &gt;&gt; But you know, my private time, don't go in there. No, don't don't tell me what I can and can't do on my cell phone. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me what I can and can't do in my marriage. And I ain't talking about the man standing behind the pulp. I'm talking about the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost, you know, when the Holy Ghost is dealing with your heart. You know, the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. And the very word is right now discerning your life. And you can either accept it or you can reject it. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you know the way you're living is not right, you ought to just repent &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, oh, what was the zeal for the age?" Be zealous therefore and repent. The prophet of God said to say, "I am wrong." Oh, God, help us. If anybody needs to say, "Lord, I'm wrong. Lord, I've been wrong. I've been so wrong, but Lord, you're right. And I need your Holy Ghost. I need the pillar of fire just to come and change me. Wash me over, Lord. Change my thinking. Change my mind, my ideas. Lord, if there be any wickedness in me, Lord, you search the reigns of the heart. Lord, wash me up. Cleanse me up. Lord, I want to go in a rapture. &gt;&gt; It's too late of an hour. The death angel's passing. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. But God has given us a word that if you'll just surrender to that this morning, you can walk right out of the darkness, right out of the bondage, right out of your condition. God can restore your marriage, &gt;&gt; he can save your prodical sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; If you believe, I've been taught by a vindicated prophet, if you have enough faith for salvation, you have enough faith for your kids. Quit letting the devil haunt you about your sons and your daughters and stand upon the word and hit that devil with the word and say, "Satan, I got a promise. The same Jesus who saved me. The same Jesus that sanctified. He give me my babies. He give me my girl. He give me my boy. Back up, devil. You can't have him." And if the devil don't move, the prophet said, "Hit him again. Hit him again. Hit him again. My son will be saved. My daughters will be saved. I'm going to give my mama. I'm going to give my daddy. I'm going to get them all under the toe. Come on in to the message of the devil. You can't have a Hey, the prophet of God said, "This bride don't have a halfway religion." Moses stood before Pharaoh. Oh, if I can say it like this, I'll stand before the God of this evil age and say, "You can't have my family. You can't have my brothers. You can't have my sisters." We're all going. &gt;&gt; We ain't leaving a hoof behind. &gt;&gt; I am of the royal seed of Abraham. Lord, I'm coming for you. &gt;&gt; The kings of this world might have taken you. &gt;&gt; Come on, ye men. Come on, ye servants. &gt;&gt; We're going in a rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have a message. &gt;&gt; We are not pushed around &gt;&gt; from pillar to post. &gt;&gt; We are not wondering. We are not wondering can I if I will I &gt;&gt; you got the wrong one this time. &gt;&gt; I am the gene seed of God. &gt;&gt; God said the gene that was in him at the beginning found me. &gt;&gt; I come from God. I'm going back to God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said I've come to the spot. I believe that people don't even know what they're doing. It come to the time to where the human beings has looked like become such a subject to evil until it's a pathetic thing. &gt;&gt; Seems like there's a shadow of darkness just over the people &gt;&gt; that's oppressing them. &gt;&gt; So many times we want to put that out in Lady Osia. &gt;&gt; We want to put that out on that church or that family. Oh, but you can feel the pressure &gt;&gt; in your home, &gt;&gt; in your marriage, &gt;&gt; when you wake up and you try to pray. &gt;&gt; Pressure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pressing the people. There's gross darkness, a shadow of darkness over the land. Just over the people, pressing them to empty substitutes and drugs and lust and alcohol and music and entertainment and religious devils and religious spirits. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Religious spirits of hypocrisy hiding right in the framework of the message. &gt;&gt; Coping with the darkness, coping with the pressure. &gt;&gt; Too much pride. &gt;&gt; Friends, don't let pride hold you in a cycle of revival and death. &gt;&gt; There ain't going to be no pride on the day of judgment. &gt;&gt; Ain't no time for it there. And my Bible says we ought to have boldness in the day of judgment. &gt;&gt; You ought to be zealous. Therefore, look, if you are going through a cycle and you can't get the victory over lust or you can't get the victory over entertainment or you delete the apps and you download them again, &gt;&gt; I believe you can come be prayed for and be delivered this morning. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I believe in total deliverance. &gt;&gt; I believe in total victory. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe in being so one with the Lord Jesus Christ that I am he. &gt;&gt; Well, let me say it where it's more familiar. She is him. &gt;&gt; I ain't the one that said it, Brother Jason. &gt;&gt; A vindicated prophet &gt;&gt; said that you are him. &gt;&gt; I think it's time we start believing what a vindicated prophet said. I think a vindicated prophet told you, you are the bride of Jesus Christ. You are the spotless. Come on. Virtuous pride. Hey, I'm starting to feel pretty good. I feel like preaching. I think it's time we start believing who we are. You are the bride. You are justified. You can go on a rapture. You can put every devil under your feet. Every suicide devil, every depression, every lust devil. Hey, I've been called and raised up in this hour to put that devil under my feet &gt;&gt; in my home, in my car, in my life, in my private life, in my church, in my family, in my marriage. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just getting started, so forgive me. But to think in the midst of all this darkness and all this chaos and confusion of Lady Osia, God has a seed laying right there in the midst of all of it. And the prophet of God would say it like this. I should be closing, but it's all right. Y'all okay? You know, I know I'll call this my second home. It's like I tell the church back home, you know, this isn't mandatory, the same doors you came in are still right there. &gt;&gt; You you you know, you can come and go as you please. &gt;&gt; Hope that's all right. &gt;&gt; But if you Hey, &gt;&gt; if you want more, there's more for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "Well, now the seed was already upon the earth. I believe God had planted the seed and just as long as the sun could get to that seed. &gt;&gt; Put yourself there, church. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, this Satan's trying to pile up so much chaos and darkness and confusion on your life, but just as long as the sun could get to that seed, it began to grow. &gt;&gt; And that's the reason it has only taken days to bring forth these things, because the seed was already in the earth. All it needed was light. &gt;&gt; Look, the transforming powers already laying in you. No light, no life. I want to tell you church, this isn't a historical lesson. This isn't a history class. The prophet of God said, "This is what's happening in this day right now. God has predestinated seed that he's laid right into the age. And as long as the sunlight of this word can strike that seed, it will begin to grow." I want to tell you, he's right here, right now. I say, why don't you let him have his way? Open up your heart. Let the light of God's word shine into your heart. Don't reject him. I said it's time to rise and shine, church. He said, and that's the way God has it today. His seed is already here, his word. The only thing it needs is light on it. &gt;&gt; And he is that light. For he is the word. The word and the light is the same thing. The life in there is the light of the word. See, it's the life. &gt;&gt; That's why you can stand there and say, "Shalom, &gt;&gt; peace. It's light time for the believers." &gt;&gt; But I'm wanting to turn the corner just as you've experienced the light, the sen of God's word and this transforming power in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you are the light. &gt;&gt; So then I'm preaching on the way light comes today. You are the light of the world. &gt;&gt; The way light comes today is in you. It's in you. &gt;&gt; It's in you. &gt;&gt; How's your neighbor going to see the light? &gt;&gt; Do Do men light a candle and hide it under a bushel? &gt;&gt; Oh, God help us. &gt;&gt; We've been hiding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, what are we afraid of? We afraid to lose our job. &gt;&gt; We afraid to not be able to go to the block party in the neighborhood cuz they know I'm a believer. They better already know you're a believer. &gt;&gt; Praise God for our wives. &gt;&gt; Some of you brothers, the only reason people know you're a Christian is because they see your wife. &gt;&gt; It ain't because of your testimony. It ain't because of your life. Oh, glory to God. Help me now. &gt;&gt; Hey, some of you sisters, you've won more converts and you've shined your light more than some of us brothers. Because all we do is go to uh work with a tail tucked in and we don't tell nobody about it. But our wives when they go to the store and they go to the grocery store and they go into the highways and byways they're shining their light that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today. I say if our sisters got enough Holy Ghost to not cut their hair and wear their dresses. Lord, you brothers got to have enough backbone to say I got your back. I'll go into the highways. I'll go in the valleys. I'll tell the whole world my God lives. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; I'll be like a John the Baptist and stand before our ro. It's not lawful for you to have her. &gt;&gt; Cut my head off. Throw me in the dungeon. &gt;&gt; Lock me up. But one thing, I will not bend. I will not pow. For I am like those Hebrew children. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Since when did we become pushovers? Hold out. &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Quit ye like men. &gt;&gt; You are the light. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, "Well, we're trying to come to a close." And the Messiah, he said, "Then when God was made flesh and become the Messiah, &gt;&gt; we okay for 10 more minutes? Amen. &gt;&gt; In the Messiah, he said, "Then when God was made flesh and became the Messiah, then if we can yield ourselves to be anointed like he was, &gt;&gt; we become Messiahs, &gt;&gt; little lights, &gt;&gt; remember, it's expedient that I go away." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look, if Brother Brandon was still here, I'm sorry. I wouldn't be preaching. &gt;&gt; I'd be in his meeting somewhere. &gt;&gt; And brother Jason probably might just be there, too. &gt;&gt; Call me crazy. &gt;&gt; Do Do you know what that ministry was? &gt;&gt; It was the son of man ministry. &gt;&gt; Christ veiling himself in human form. Yes. &gt;&gt; The same son of man ministry that came I hope that's all right. The same son of man ministry that came to the Jews &gt;&gt; has come back to the gentile dispensation to prove that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And just as Jesus Christ told the disciples, "It's expedient that I go away because I want the son of man ministry to be in you." Christ come down in a first one to maturity in the office of a prophet proving he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He has run his course. He was uh the the the light of the day. He was the anointed word. But now, where is that anointed word? It's in the bride. It's in the bride body. &gt;&gt; And when the God was made flesh and became the Messiah, you are little, he goes on, you are little lights. That's what the church is supposed to be is lights, little anointed ones. That's God's church. Look friends, as long as it's just in the books and on the tapes, it can be questioned. But when that word is made manifested in you, then it is light to the age. Prophet of God said, "But when it's made manifest, then you see the product of what it spoke of being manifested. Then that is light on the word." Is that your heart's desire? We'll just call for the musicians as we move towards a close. Prophet of God said, "That's the way God's church is, his eagllets, his messiahs." Is it okay if you just sit there for a moment without playing? Is that okay, brother Jason? &gt;&gt; I have a bad habit of that. So, it reminds me though. I'll get to preaching for another 10 or 15 minutes and I'll look and see the musicians and be like, "Oh, yeah." &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, "That's the way God's church is." Look, I'm talking about you now. We We've dealt in the negative, but we're bringing it to the positive. He said, he said, "That's the way God's church is. His eaglets, his messiahs." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They look like him. They act like him. They preach like him. They do the works that he did. The things that I do shall you do also. More than this shall you do because I go unto the father. These shines shall follow my eagllets. They'll do just as I do. If my spirit is in them, then they'll do the works that I do. If they don't do the works I do, that's because that spirit is not in them. &gt;&gt; Uh don't be condemned. &gt;&gt; Welcome the word and say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; that's my portion. That's my promise. Look, your life declares what you are. And I want to say, maybe you don't look like what you will be, but there is a voice speaking out declaring what you are. Oh, I I got quotes I want to read. The prophet of God said, "You are the pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son of the living God. Every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned in the first place. You are perfect. There is a voice of God crying out to you. What you are, what you will be. &gt;&gt; If you start playing something softly, please in our text, here's this woman. She's brought before Jesus. She's dead concerning the law. She sinned, caught in adultery. Think of the condition maybe of the church age in the world and the denominations, adulterers. I think of my own life. We're born in sin and even raised in a message home. But I too was like this woman. I was guilty of the law. And I believe we're taught that if you're guilty of the least, you're guilty of the whole. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I I if I were standing there, there's no hope for this woman. &gt;&gt; The law of Moses is clear. There's not just one witness. There's multiple witnesses, hopeless situation. But the word took a hopeless situation and he shined his light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Into the moment. And maybe you're in a situation right now and it looks hopeless. You're needing direction. You're needing deliverance. Maybe you've come to the altar and time and time again. I don't know. But you know that same one that stood in front of that woman and stooped down started to ride in the sand. He's here right now. And so many times we're worried about what the accusers will say. Or sometimes we make our brothers and sisters the jury. &gt;&gt; We're worried about what they'll think, what they'll say. Oh, if I go for prayer, if I go to the altar, I've been serving God 25 years. I got a position. If I tell brother Jason, I've been struggling with pornography. What will that do to my life? It'll set you free. Yes. &gt;&gt; It'll relieve you of the condemnation. &gt;&gt; It'll put you back in your position as a son of God. &gt;&gt; Look, friend, it's too it's too late to be playing church. I didn't come here to preach a fancy sermon. I come that God might minister to you in your need &gt;&gt; and prepare your heart and restore your heart because it's going home time. This ain't about how much message you can quote and and who's the best preacher and who got the best church. This is about sons and daughters of God recognizing that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. That he can deliver you out of your bondage. He can save you from your sin. He can set you free from the darkness and the bondage. And the light of God's glorious gospel is here to shine into your situation. &gt;&gt; Where are your accusers? None but you, Lord. I want to I wonder maybe with every head bowed, is there somebody that wants to come to Jesus? [Music] Is there somebody that wants to make their life right? Is there somebody that wants to hear them words? I I I don't accuse you. I died for you. I carried your sins to Calvary that you might be forgiven. That you might be set free. Lord Jesus, we just just pray that you just come in a special way. Lord, I feel in my heart right now there's specific need. Lord, you went this way and I'm just trusting, Lord. [Music] Lord, I I once was that woman. I was so bound in darkness, worthy to be killed and condemned. Lord, you stood there and said, "I don't accuse you. Go and sin no more." Lord, and I believe that you're here right now to set somebody free and to shine your light into their situation and start to deal with their heart. Lord, as we just just worship you in your presence, Lord, I just want to turn the service over to you, Lord, that you just walk up and down these aisles, Lord. And may there be a true surrender, Lord. You said it's expedient that I go away, Lord, because you wanted to come and tabernacle yourself in sons and daughters of God. Lord, we've allowed the things of the world to fill up our minds and our heart and our lives, Lord. But Lord, we just want to empty out this morning and ask that you would just come so fill us with the Holy Ghost. Lord, grant us revelation. I pray change my heart. Oh, &gt;&gt; change my heart, oh God. May I be like you. Change my heart, oh God. Let's all stand to our feet apart. Make it ever true. Change my heart, oh God. Oh, let the Lord deal with hearts today. May I be loved. &gt;&gt; This is why we come to church. Hallelujah. The power I am the Oh, let's give him some worship. Oh, me that made me.

[Music] Let all heaven and earth proclaim king. the kingdom. &gt;&gt; They will pass away. &gt;&gt; But there's something about that day. [Music] Oh Jesus. Jesus. Jesus.

Jesus [Applause] l heaven, heaven and earth and earth. Proclaim. Let the family of God proclaim it. Kings [Music] and kingdoms declare it. They will declare it. There's something. There's something about that. &gt;&gt; One more time. Jesus. Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let's raise our hands, friends. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let's sing it to him now. &gt;&gt; Jesus. [Music] There's just something something about about Thank you, Lord. That name. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's the name given. Oh, master. Our savior [Music] Jesus is like the fragrance and that's so true. How many know him in that way? How many know him? My Jesus. [Music] Jesus. Oh my Jesus. Let all heaven, heaven and earth and earth, &gt;&gt; heaven and earth, and all the pride, all the believers declare it now. All kings and kingdoms will all pass away. But there's something &gt;&gt; But there's something about that name. [Music] &gt;&gt; Is he worthy, friends? &gt;&gt; Is he a worthy God? &gt;&gt; A worthy. &gt;&gt; Oh, worthy is the lamb that was slain. &gt;&gt; Think about the power of the name of Jesus Christ. You know, Brother Brandham said, "If they could have just ever got that rod out of Moses' hand, they could have whipped him." Brother Brandham said, "But that rod is the name of Jesus to you today." &gt;&gt; See, and it was that rod. He said, "Stretch out your rod. Do this. Do that." I'm here to tell you something, friends. I We don't have to carry around a rod, but we've got the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's just as powerful today as it has ever been. Amen. &gt;&gt; I so appreciate the Lord coming. It just goes to show you that the Lord can come in 2025 just like he did on the day of Pentecost &gt;&gt; in an upper room 2,000 years ago. And the same God whips the same devil and the same family of God. Come to know him. Hallelujah. In a new and living way. I'm so appreciative of the Lord. My I think he deserves a wonderful hand of applause today for the Lord and his graciousness. You know, brother Matthew, I thought he might come to this quote as soon as he got started. I thought about this quote out of Feast of the Trumpets. And brother Brandham is talking about this very theme that this is the promise for this age. We're living in the age that his coming will be in. Think about that. You are the last generation that'll ever be on the earth. Amen. You're the generation, the Bible says, upon whom the ends of the world have come. I'm glad for me and you it's not ending. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, he says she must be identified in him. Any woman must be identified with her husband. The two are one. And Christ bride has to be identified with him for the two are one. He is the word, not a denomination, the word. We are to be the children of the light. The light is the word which is made light &gt;&gt; for this age. Now, he's about to tell you what makes it. He said it's the Let me read it again. He said, "We're the children of light, and the light is the word which is made light for this age." How do we know light except it comes from the word? All right. The word made flesh is the light of the age. When you see it, the Bible said so. Now, it's interesting, you know, it's not just that when you see the message or when you see the truth, but when the people can see the word living in you and me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's when it's the living word made flesh to the people. You can tell anybody about God sending a prophet and feed them all kinds of doctrine. That don't that won't the devil ain't afraid of that. See, he's not afraid of how religious you are, how right you are in your doctrine. He knows if you miss that life, you won't come up anyway. I want the life on display. Do you realize if you think about it, friends, I was talking to a sister here just recently and I and you know she's just just praying for her husband and I said sister I said you are actually your husband is more of a believer than he realizes because he's in love with the manifestation of the word and the manifestation of the word is a much better version of the word than a written book. Even this book &gt;&gt; when Jesus came, was he the word? &gt;&gt; That's not a trick question. He was the word. Did he come as a a scroll with words or did he come as a human being? &gt;&gt; And that and Paul and Peter said, "We we have a more sure word of prophecy." They had the writings of Isaiah and Ezekiel and Daniel and all that, but Peter says, "We saw him. We went to the mountain with him. We have a more sure word." I'm here to tell you something, friends. The the earth has had a Bible for thousands of years. You are a more sure word of prophecy to the world. Brother Brandham said, "When the books are closed for the last time, the word will be fleshed." &gt;&gt; I'm all for loving our Bibles. You should. It should be the most treasured, cherished item you possess. And I hope you possess one. But let me tell you something. God never intended to stay ink on paper in a book. &gt;&gt; He's intending to live behind flesh. your flesh, my flesh. Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God. And a prophet taught us and the word teaches us, you are a continuation of that same creation. Can you rejoice in that today? &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. There's no one loves, you know, sometimes, brother Brandham, he took his his old Bible and he laid it in a chair and he said, I just started walking around it, Brother Jack. He said, "I was in my office just walking around." And he said, "I just looked at that book laying there in that chair and I just kept walking around it." And he said, "I thought to myself," he said, "I pointed up my Bible." He said, "I thought to myself, God, there's life in there if the people will just receive it." Oh, no wonder you can become the light of the word of the world because you are the light of the word &gt;&gt; made flesh and living in this dark impossible day. Amen. And do you know that it's all by design? You know God did it that way on purpose. He on purpose had you born in the darkest of all hours. &gt;&gt; And you say the devil beats me up so bad my mind battles and this and that. Listen, just remember God put you here on purpose because he knows you'll believe his word. And when you believe his word, friends, there's no devil, no power on earth that can stand against that. You believe God's word, Brother Brandham says, and that makes him love you and you get what you ask for. Amen. How many have enjoyed being in the presence of God today and enjoyed the word, enjoyed the ministry? Amen. Praise the Lord. I think I we'd like to have brother Matthew come back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to let you go. Amen. It's been wonderful to be in the house of God today. We'll have uh brother Matt and sister uh Gabrielle here and the kids all fellowshipping throughout the afternoon. You'd be welcome to shake their hand. Amen. Let them know how much you appreciated them being here with us. They're on their way through and we talked him into stopping here and Amen. coming to see us in Buford. I'm so glad you did, brother Matthew. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen. Turn around and shake hands before you go. We're going to have brother Matt uh you got a Jubilee on on hand or what you going to say? [Music] I love it. That works. &gt;&gt; Weapon may be formed, but it won't prosper. God bless you, friends. We're glad to have had you here today. &gt;&gt; At your leisure, you can be dismissed. You can stay here to sing a while. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Cuz the God I serve knows only how to triumph. Oh my God will never fail. Oh my God will never fail. I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory. For the battle belongs to the Lord. Oh, I'm going to see a victory.

The more that I can humble myself, the more he lifts me up. Every day I live, Lord, I love you more. And it gets easier to understand the road I'm traveling down. No more wondering away. I'm standing on solid ground. And I know I'm headed to my future home. And the voice I hear is yours alone. Every day I live. Lord, I love you more. The more that I surrender, the more that I surrender, the lighter my Lord. [Music] The more that I release my cares, the more he takes control.
