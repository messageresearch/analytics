========================================

flying just under the wire today all right let's uh stand and have a word of prayer you don't mind dear gracious father Lord we come before you this morning hoping that to hear from you Lord that father I believe you put this thought on my heart a week ago Lord and I'm asking now that you would help me to step out of the way way that with your help that you could express this thought to the people in the way that it was expressed to me and that father that they would gain something from it they could be edified and and grow and be encouraged Lord we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen um while yall are standing we'll go ahead and read okay um we're going to go ahead and turn to Genesis chapter 1 um and verse 26 it says Genesis 1 and verse 26 and um God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth y all can be seated um so if I go ahead and get my point up there it is um so I give you a little bit of background on this um well first I'm just going to read this quote um this is from marriage and divorce and it says remember Adam was both masculine and feminist in the original creation um one but then he was separated by a rib notice but a byproduct and notice the only one of all God's creation of every animal and every she was the only one designed this way every other female was in the original creation every other female was in the original creation but Eve was not in the original creation see that had to be made that way we'll get to it after a while notice in this creation that she was not in the original but a byproduct and in this creation um now I don't want to hurt your feelings but I want to tell you the truth and you just sit still you're doing nice okay now this quote uh if we go back to that oh did I do I have control over it no okay so this quote has bothered so many people okay it bothered me for years because what we do is we read the red part right where we read the whole quote we get to the red part and it says she's not in the original but a byproduct and that's all we hear right because it it it seems unpleasant somehow that the woman is some byproduct some secondary thing some afterthought that wasn't in the original creation right and this bugged me for a long time and then one day about this would have been trying to remember the exact time it would have either been very late in 2019 or sometime in 2020 I was working with Travis doing AC work and I can tell you exactly where we were we were in I95 going north to Columbia and we were listening to marriage and divorce in the truck and I heard this quote brother brandom said it and it was like a light bulb went off in my head and I went wow this is beautiful and I and and everybody gets hung up on this and it's and it's not it shouldn't be like this is it's it's not something to be upset about because and and you know I it occurred to me and it just popped in my head and then I you know you try to explain it to people and it never really sticked like you you have a hard time explaining it to people the way it kind of occurred to you um if I could hit that next slide um so well let me let me finish on with my explanation a little bit because I had always had a hard time explaining it to people never really landed with people the way I was hoping to the way like I could tell like I'd explain it and just never like okay that's nice but they never really get it the way I got it and then last Sunday brother JD is doing his Sunday school and he read that same quote and it was like it hit me again and this time I knew exactly how to explain it to people hopefully so this is my original explanation that never really stuck with people I'm sure y'all can understand why um so and I know it's I know it seems a lot more complicated oh B basically you just got to be able to see the colors um this is obviously a a a very it's a this is a actually um pictures out of a organic chemistry textbook I had laying around the house um but the main thing is I just want you to see the see the colors right because everything in the top leftand corner you see that that's chemicals in a reaction and then it goes to the right the arrows to the other side of the arrows it's gone through the reaction and it's a two stage stage reaction and then you go down to the bottom left and then across okay and and the bottom right hand corner is the finished total reaction okay now I put colors and I highlighted everything with colors so you can see everything in the end that is marked products and byproducts was in the original mix there was nothing in there that wasn't in there in the original and there's nothing missing right every so when brother brandham calls Eve a byproduct he's not calling her an afterthought because when a chemist makes a does a synthesis of a chemical he knows what byproducts are going to come out of that if he's worth ass Sal at all right kemist who don't understand their byproducts blow themselves up um God knew what was going to happen to say that Eve was an that's not true and by the way when people hear the word byproduct what we hear in our brain that you know we hear the word byproduct but what our brain tells us is waste product that's not the same thing okay I'll give you a really good example back in the late 1800s um whales were hunted to near extinction because the fat was rendered down to use for lighting and cooking right well the whales almost died they didn't have any more whales so they had to come up with something else so some guys found this this black goo coming out of the ground and they figured out if you boil it you can you can drain off a chemical called kerosene and kerosene became the number one lighting chemical like it's what was used in replacement for whale oil well in the process of that they had this other byproduct that they didn't know exactly what to do with um that was really really volatile and it burned way too hot and you couldn't use it for lighting and it was really like had a lot of really nauseous fumes that came off of it and a lot of times they just dumped it in the river and that was called gasoline okay and so in modern times kerosene is an afterthought who uses kerosene basically nobody but that byproduct right gasoline people fight Wars over that stuff right so don't get hung up on the word by product right um You could also use the term secondary product that's also just as relative of a term in chemistry it's it is another product that is inevitable with this with what's happening here it is a it is part of the original creation it's not an afterthought am um and so that was that was kind of the original take on this now if I could jump back to that first slide the part that hit me last week that I never quite I and I knew this it just I didn't know how to say it just right is the part in blue right says and notice the only one of all God's creation of every animal and everything else she was the only one designed this way every other female was in the original creation every other female was in the original creation but Eve was not in the original creation she had to be made that way we'll get to it after a while okay the fact that Eve is a byproduct is special it's Unique it is required in order for her to be made in the image of God okay if she's not a byproduct she's not in the image of God okay because God said let us make man in our image male and female created he them right she was special and God did that on purpose right it was all part of the plan why why did she have to be made it be part of Adam as a byproduct as a rib as part of Adam and extracted out of him because Adam was made in the image of God and their entire relationship was a mirror of God and the church the church came out of God and God before the foundation of the world the lamb was slain and by the way if the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world why was a lamb slain if there was nothing to redeem right if the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world the church had to be there in order to be redeemed okay so now Adam and Eve have to match that that's their purpose they're if they're in the image of God then they have to mirror the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and the purchase of the blood right so in order for that to happen Adam has to literally be a a photocopy of God in which he is formed alone and then his sweetheart manifests out of him okay what the problem is when people have a it's so sad that that the modern feminist you know I started a 100 years ago so it's not even that modern over a hundred years ago that people have said like made this idea that you know um of feminism and and and women's Liberation and all this stuff and and on its face it sounds so nice and so lovely but don't forget what it's doing is it's it's driving this wedge into the plan of God which is that the woman comes out of the man and if you you know people get hung up on this oh well she was just afterthought so now she has to listen to the man and and she has to be a subservient to the man yeah but it's a pattern of of God in the church so does the church tell God what to do does the church rule over God does the church take leadership in the relationship with God is does God conform to the vision of the church no obviously not and we don't complain about that we don't say oh we're so oppressed poor Christians because we have to conform to the word of God us poor poor poor put upon enslaved Christians you know no we we do it and so if a marriage is done correctly then a man will love a woman the way Christ loves the church and she will be able to submit to him as as the church submits to Christ if you know so I don't I I lost my train at where was I going with this um anyways so people get get you know they they they push out this thing well I don't want to be a I don't want to just be a byproduct well when people don't want to be a bride product what they don't on its face it sounds like a problem with headship in reality it's a problem with Redemption because Redemption speaks of origin right what is the what is the patter the the the the example that is always given of redemption right the man goes to the pawn shop he gives the pawn shop owners something to hold of his he comes back later with money and redeems it back from the pawn shop it he couldn't have redeemed it if it wasn't his in the first place when Adam when when Eve uh Falls with the serpent it is technically in Adam's Power to just say God I'm through with her wipe her off the face of the Earth and make me a new one okay but he couldn't do it because she was part of him like it's in it's conceptually in in your power to go hack your hand off with a meat cleaver and throw in a wood chipper no one's going to do that you can't do it it that's that's like that's like repulsive to even think about but anymore than than Adam could let this woman that he cared about be destroyed she was his rib she was part of him it was it I mean he was willing to destroy himself it's the Bible says that by one man all of uh that that the World fell one man Adam was the one who sinned cuz he knew exactly what he was doing and he did it knowing full well I'm going to be destroyed for this and I'm going to do it anyways because I would rather be wiped out and burn the Garden of Eden to the ground than watch that woman die sir that's what being a byproduct means if she wasn't part of him then there then he could have just said fine get rid of her if she just came out of the ground with Adam like all the other animals if she would have been just like when people say well women shouldn't be considered a byproduct what they're saying is women should be considered like all the other animals can you can you advance forward for a little bit go Advance forward to one rooster many hens Advance please there's a one bull elk and a bunch of cows okay one more time please there's a male lion and a bunch of lionesses those are all animals in which the females were in the original creation and what does it produce it produces if you will advance one more Isaiah 4:1 and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread we will wear our own apparel and let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach that is what it produces when you don't want to be considered a byproduct it produces the modern man some of y'all older people are not gonna understand this younger people you are going to get this modern the modern secular non-Christian dating Market is a bunch of women chasing after 20% of a bunch of very handsome wealthy dudes who do not see them as anything more than a a sex object to be included into a Harum okay that's what the modern dating Market is and that's what Isaiah predicted and that is a result of people right okay then you get to be congratulations you get to be co-equal you could be just the same as the man and you will get treated as such if you don't want to be special if you don't want to be the byproduct of a man that means you don't want to be in the image of God and you want to be just like all the other animals it's the byproduct is for your protection it's because if she wasn't a byproduct she would have been burnt with the serpent she'd have been poof gone right it's because if she's his byproduct she's part of his heart he's willing to die for her he's willing to do anything he's willing to burn the whole world down for her he's W look Christ is willing to go to a condescend and and put aside the the Comforts of heaven and descend to Earth and take up a robe of Flesh and be be humiliated and and and and and live on the side of a road he willing to be homeless and and put upon and destitute just so his Grand Finale could be tortured to death like maimed and beaten and and and tortured and and publicly humiliated like the crucifixion was not just like oh we're going to nail you to a cross no it was it was like a whole process they made a whole day of it like it was it was like a a big to-do like they they beat them and then they specifically engineered the cross to be like the most uncomfortable awkward thing to carry that would cover you in splinters when you carried it and then they made the convicted carry the means of their own demise like that was all part of the thing and Christ knew all this going into it and he's like yep that's where I'm going I'm going go do that and then when he gets there and and it's happening you know at any moment you would talk about oh he could have just spoken and summoned a legion of angels to just wipe them all out and or he could have just spoke himself to Heaven yeah that's true I mean if he was a vengeful man he could have spoken a legion of angels to crucify everyone who's crucifying him right or or better yet huh he could have just been like well I know I have to go through with this but I mean I can at least speak myself some painkiller right he could have at least deadened his own nerves if he wanted to he had that power and he said nope I'm going to feel every ounce of this I'm going to feel every pain I'm going to feel every ache I'm going to because it's it's necessary it's required and why was he doing it because he loved the people who were doing it to him don't forget that when they hung him up there he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing they don't they don't get it when on in Acts chapter 2 when when when Peter is preaching on the day of Pentecost he tells the Jews that it was Christ that you crucified there were people in that crowd who said crucify him there were people in that crowd who called for Barabas to be released and they got the Holy Ghost Christ died for them and that's when look when Adam ran to Eve and said I will die before I let her be destroyed don't forget that she was only going to be destroyed because she cheated on him like I mean let's this is talk about a a man that is going to to you know people I think the reason why women are so afraid of of um women are so afraid of of this this idea of being subservient to a man is because we've heard so many horror stories of of women being you know conned and and and you know get left after 10 years of marriage with three kids destitute as the some snake in the grass slithers back into the weeds that he came from you know I mean yeah that's that's hideous that's that's horrifying I mean the only solution is to make sure that the man that you're marrying is the kind of man who's not going to walk away who would who would rather hack off his own hands before he loses you before he before you're not in his life anymore and the only way a man is ever going to live up to that is if he's living up to the standard of Christ yes right the only way that a woman can genuinely be rest assured that the man that she is committing herself to is worth all of this worth the risk is that there's really only one man who's ever been worth it right that's the reality Christ is the only one who's ever actually lived up to the standard and you might think well how is that going to work right how can a woman have any Assurance well because before Christ left he said I'll be with you even in you on the day of Pentecost that same Christ who went to the Cross who is willing to sacrifice himself for a Humanity that hated him will dwell inside of a man and then women can be rest assured that that man is not going to treat them any worse than Christ would treat them amen that is the only option right that's how you can be rest assured that your marriage is going to be in the image of God that's the only possible way it doesn't work otherwise where was I at um and uh just as I'll I'll I'll kind of wrap up with this um you know the natural types the spiritual did I put that quote in my Advanced one yeah there we go that's probably hard to read um so it says no I don't see people here um but what's old enough to understand this and I got a mixed congregation this would be a doctor's talk and I'm your brother um so listen in the life the first thing in a baby when it's born a natural birth the first thing is water is that right blood then spirit it's got twitching of muscles but it's not um but not uh till it's born has it life but notice I mean breathing life for anybody who was confused used on the topic of abortion um you know what I mean now look so it is in the spiritual birth and I want I'm just going to skip down for the sake of time says notice justification by faith sanctification through the blood and the baptism of the Holy Ghost when a baby is born water blood and spirit when a baby's born newborn baby in heaven he comes through water blood and spirit the natural types the spiritual everything on Earth amen that was my first Bible to watch nature you get nature um typed up with God and you find out you got the same things I want to I underlined and bolded that the natural types and spiritual everything on Earth if a woman is kicking at the idea of or just anybody let's be real is kicking at the idea of a woman is a byproduct and that's rude the natural types the spiritual if you cannot wrap your head around that then that is 100% an indication of your spiritual relationship with God Amen if you cannot say Amen to every word of God you're going to have a problem okay even when it says something that doesn't really fit your taste okay amen so when this is so you can see this brother random talks about the the airplanes and and you know advancing for horse and buggy airplane you know automobile airplane rocket ship okay isn't it odd isn't it odd that in the era of the feminist movement is when the denominational Church typed as a woman would supersede the word of God and declare her word above God isn't it odd that when in the natural world when women start declaring themselves refusing to be seen as you know submissive to to a man that the that the church world would that is the era in which the word would be crucified AR fresh isn't that interesting and so if you think that we as Christians are just going to have a modernistic uh interpretation of what marriage is if we think that we're going to have a modern pattern our marriages and our homes after something other than the word of God and then expect that our relationship with God will remain intact I'm sorry but the natural types the spiritual and your natural Affairs absolutely are an indication of your affairs with God and and you you're you're gonna the wheels are going to come off of that thing anyways I am grossly out of time I better quit before I am in trouble so let's stand and have a word of prayer father Lord I Thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak my heart to these people and Lord that maybe through the foolishness of this that something would have been said that would encourage people and give people some sort of understanding that that people wouldn't be it wouldn't hurt so bad when they hear something they don't understand Lord that maybe some understanding could happen that they could take hold of it and and say Amen to it and that they would be able to understand it and see that Lord you've never said anything that was intended to hurt people so father we thank you for this and we we invite you into our midst into our service Lord be with us through the remainder of our service in the worship and in the in the ministering of the word Lord be with us father min minister to our hearts in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
