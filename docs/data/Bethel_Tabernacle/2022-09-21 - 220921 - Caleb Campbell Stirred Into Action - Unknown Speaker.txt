hand clop of Praise thank you Lord glory to God Amen friends let's turn right in the scripture tonight we're going to turn in our Bibles to hagi hagi the very first chapter in Hagi it's right after Zephaniah and it's right before Zachariah towards the end of the Old Testament for good reference amenah amen we're going to start in verses 12 we're going to read down through 14 it says then zerubabel the son of shaale and Joshua the son of josc the high priest with all the remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the Lord their God and the words of haggi the Prophet as the Lord their God had sent him and the people did fear before the Lord then then spake Hagi the Lord in the Lord's message unto the people saying I Am with You saith the Lord and the Lord stirred up the spirit of zerubabel the son of Shel governor of Judah and the spirit of Joshua the son of josc the high priest and the spirit of the remnant of the people and they came and did work in the house of the Lord of hosts their God Amen we're going to turn into one more scripture uh Psalms 146 Psalms 146 says praise ye the Lord praise the Lord oh my soul while I live will I praise the Lord I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being amen whose prayer is that tonight put not your trust in princes nor in the son of man in whom there is no help his breath goeth forth he returneth to his Earth in that very day his thoughts perish happy is he that have the god of Jacob for whose for for his help whose hope is in the Lord his God which had made Heaven and Earth the sea and all that therein is which keepeth truth forever which executeth judgment for the oppress which giveth food to the hungry the Lord loose the Prisoners the Lord openeth the eyes of the blind the Lord raises them that are bowed down the Lord loveth the righteous the Lord preserveth The Strangers he re he relieve the fatherless and Widow but the Way of the Wicked he turneth upside down the Lord shall reign forever even thy God oh Zion unto all generations praise ye the Lord amen let's just bow our hearts tonight dear precious Heavenly Father Lord we just humbly approach your throne this evening father we just pray over the reading of your word Lord we pray that you would just come into this place tonight Lord and that not me Lord God there's no words that I could say father that would be a blessing but Lord we

now in the mighty precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen you can have your seats tonight by the help of the Lord I want to Min Minister tonight on being stirred into action amen and I sure do love the word of God am amen now I believe in the power of prayer amen I believe in the power of praise I believe it changes atmospheres and I believe it changes situations I believe it changes circumstances amen the psalm I opened with praise ye the Lord praise the Lord oh my soul while I have breath in these young lungs I will praise I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being amen when we sing praises to the Lord no matter what is happening no matter where you're at it gets you out of the Earthly realm and into the Heavenly realm amen sometimes we don't even know how to pray or what to pray but Romans 8:26 will say that likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered amen the spirit the spirit which with is in US maketh intercessions hallelujah amen and as Pastor was saying the other day the Bible tells us when we pray that we need to pray in the spirit amen Ephesians 6:18 says praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit watching there unto with all perseverance and supplications for All Saints amen amen I W to by the help of the Lord I want to go into Acts chapter 12 and I W to read a little bit about what happened when Saints pray in the spirit amen here in Acts we can turn in our Bibles acts the 12th chapter we read of at this time Herod what what the king at this time was grandson to the Herod the Great was seeking after Fame in verse 1 and two it says that he took the sword and he killed James and martyred him and seeing that that action had pleased his F followers it pleased pleased them pleased the Jews in verse three he proceeded further to take Peter also and when he had apprehended him he put him into prison and delivered him into four quadrants quadrant of soldiers to keep him intending after Easter to bring him forth unto the people amen while while he was in prison while Peter was in the prison during this trial it says that the church was in constant prayer to God for him in verse five he was so bound with shackles in verse 6 that said it said Herod kept him so completely bound that scripture says that he was bound not with one but with two chains between two soldiers and with even more soldiers guarding the prison doors so Shackled In this trial that there was no way out there wasn't even a chance for him to get free one commentator writes he says Peter was sleeping Between Two Soldiers bound with two chains Roman prisoners had a chain fastened at one end to the wrist of their right hand and at the other to the wrist of the Soldier's left hand leaving the right arm of the keeper free in case of any attempt to escape for greater the security the prison was sometimes as here chained to two shoulders on each side the enemy always thinks he's got a firm grasp on you amen he'll try to chain you up on both sides he'll put guards at every single stop but but the fragrance of those sweet prayers broke into another atmosphere amen the constant prayers that were being offered up it put the angel of the Lord into action that night Hallelujah it says that the angel struck his side in verse 7 waking him only the light of Deliverance Shone brightly amen and when those words that were spoken by the angel he says arise quickly make haste Peter we're breaking you free from this trial we're breaking you free from this prison but we're on the enemy's territory so we must move quickly make haste Saints oh my it takes a purpose-driven faith amen the angel says listen You'll Be Free but it's not a time to mess around it's not a time to keep those carnal things in your life it says to make haste and keep your eyes fixed on this light Amen on this Vision follow me stay close there isn't time to slack Hallelujah wow we are living in brother brother Jason was saying we are living in the time of all things Hallelujah and it's time time to arise and to do it quickly as he says to make haste and to have your purpos driven Faith Hallelujah good amen with your eyes on that light Peter thought he was in a vision in verse 9 verse 11 it says by the time that he had escaped he came to himself he realized that he was delivered Hallelujah he was supernaturally delivered from this if you go to verse 12 and it says while they were lifting up their prayer for Peter a little old Believer by the name of sister Roa heard that knock of the door you know these were the these were the Saints that had prayed in the upper room these were the Saints that had a Pentecostal experience I believe that that night they were praying in the spirit amen I believe that they weren't just they weren't just Lon around they were praying with Earnest faith that Peter needed a deliverance and they were praying with an expectation that no matter what happened to him that God was in control of the situation and just at that time that they were praying at the very time that they were praying she the a knock comes on the door amen Oh Sister Roa she she heard that knock on the door and before that she even opened the door she recognized The Voice Hallelujah who's recognized The Voice tonight oh praying for his Deliverance through the night I can just think of it there Saints she was too excited to even open up the door that she ran back in the house she didn't even open the door she interrupted the very prayer that they were currently praying for Peter at the time yeah and they couldn't even they couldn't hardly believe it the Saints the Saints they were they thinking that she was mad and after listening and insisting they all concluded that it was the spirit of Peter Hallelujah my goodness we ought to we ought to Just Praise when our prayers are answered for it is our creator responding to our needs and he finds it important enough to supernaturally react sure Prayer Changes Things friends I'm just building something up I just want to build your faith up for a minute my what a testimony but Peter said to keep silent he said keep this testimony quiet he said the enemy can't find my whereabouts oh my goodness I can just imagine sister roota there that night and he she tells us that tells him that and how can I keep quiet the very thing that I was praying for you you're you knocked at the door how do you expect me to keep quiet Hallelujah how many times friends when we were yet offering up a fragrance of prayer a fragrance of a Deliverance a fragrance of something that we needed in our life he is yet sending his Angel down to Deliver us from our enemy am amen what a stir it caused Hallelujah in verse 18 and as much of a stir that was happening with those Believers the next scripture goes on to say that a stir actually was caused among the soldiers can you imagine these soldiers that were literally chain to this man now we're still sitting there they woke up the next morning and they're still in bondage they're still in Chains but the one that their prisoner the one that they were watching out for was no longer even there he had gotten out of their guard he had gotten out of the the the insurmountable odds that were all around him Hallelujah can you imagine Hallelujah can you imagine the stir among the ranks of hell when you break free from a trial when you break free from a Deliverance when you come to something in your life and that hedge is dropped Hallelujah glory to God I can just imagine those Devils oh man the devil would just have a chain he'll have these his little demon minions chained to you and he'll have every everything around you in every way possible and then one day he he realizes how did you get free it doesn't even make any sense I've built these Hedges I've built every single thing but how did you get free glory to God I'll venture to say that it's similar to what had happened here hallelujah oh glory to God oh there is thinking there isn't any way of Escape then one day he wakes up and realizes you've escaped glory to God I pray we can be encouraged in that tonight Hallelujah more than once my brother my sister more than once you've caused a stir and I'm talking to each and every one of you tonight who claims to be a Christian who claims to be a believer of this message who claims to have the Holy Ghost because you have that possession within your heart he said once you have caused a stir and I want you to have I want you to put yourself into this you have caused a stir among the ranks of Hell by the word of your testimony Hallelujah we all remember the story we remember the story of Paul and Silas friends and we remember that they were just in prison they were in bondage that night and you know they they the scripture doesn't really talk about this but I can just imagine the Mind battles that were going through their mind I can just imagine the oppression on the walls of those prison just bearing down on them they everything was against them they had insurmountable odds but what happened they just began to lift up their praises to God they began to do the only thing that they really could do it says that they began to pray and to begin to praise begin to worship God and their their atmosphere was changed Hallelujah the they were Shackled to their circumstance and their trials bound up Hallelujah but they just had their only defense that was praise glory to God praise changes things Prayer Changes Things Hallelujah am notice in both of those scripture circumstances in both of those times they were not alone when they were doing that it wasn't anything one that they could do of their own power of or of their own will Hallelujah it was something that was placed within their hearts within their souls it was the spirit of God that was just crying out Hallelujah and all they could do was surrender Hallelujah but they Wen strengthened by one another Hallelujah it seems to be a theme when I when the Lord just put something Upon My Heart Lord to to to be in one mind and one Accord with one another because it's important that we bind together in prayer we're strengthened by one another Hallelujah I was listening to a sermon brother Jack duve not too long ago and he began to to to minister began to describe what Belgian horses and I found out I did some research found out historically they were used as a work horse they were used for farmwork and plowing and an amazing thing is is one horse by itself can pull 8,000 lbs that is four tons by itself Hallelujah but interestingly enough when they began to work together they don't just carry if you put two together they don't just carry 16,000 lb a pair of them when trained together can carry up to 32,000 lbs that is quadruple just them by themselves friends Hallelujah there is something in having in one being in one in mind in one Accord Hallelujah when we pray when we pray we carry a heavy load when we earnestly earnestly lift our voices to praise thanks bro Atmos atmospheres can shift but when we enter in together how much more can those strongholds be broken Amen on glory to God when they are put into action in one mind and one Accord Hallelujah brother Brenham picks this up in uh what message is this I have heard but now I see he says in order to stay stay with God stay gentle God is gentle in order to stay with God stay with love God is love stay Meek not never be self-sufficient always rely upon him never use your own mind take his thoughts Hallelujah let his thoughts be your thoughts and take them into your carnal mind Hallelujah and repeat them over and over and say oh God take all of my doubt away Lord Oh Lord take all of my let all my thoughts be your thoughts and you sick people do is we're speaking just take away Cast Away the thought of sickness take God's healing thoughts and let them excuse me let them become your thought hallelujah amen we ought to say that tonight oh God take away all of my doubt and let all of my thoughts be your thoughts amen hallelujah if we're standing in need tonight of a Deliverance maybe it's a healing maybe it's something spiritual in your life maybe it's a mind battle maybe it's an oppression but take those thoughts those healing thoughts Lord take all of my doubt away and fill me Lord hallelujah brother Brandon picks this up and he says think upon these things and the Bible said if there be any praise and if there be any virtue and what he's doing is he's referring to Philippians 4:8 where it says finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things of are a good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on on these things it says to think on these things friends there's going to be there's going to be mind battles that say that you're not delivered there's going to be things in your mind that say that you're not healed there's going to be times where it feels like you you're just you can't get over this but you think on these things you think on these Praises Hallelujah I've got a praise tonight I got to give a little testimony brother Jason Hallelujah I stood up here 15 16 months ago and my first sermon I just claimed and I believed I had the healing in my stomach I had I went to the doctor and he told me he said oh you've got this and these pre pre cancerous cells were the words that he used and he said I want to see you every once in a while and I want to make sure that that they don't grow into anything more than what they are now and and he just he just basically just told me that this is what it was going to be and I declined that in my heart I declined it Hallelujah I declined those thoughts and for months and months I still had that I still had those those pains I still was not able to but Hallelujah I I got a phone call the other night I had a procedure done I had both endoscopy and I colonoscopy done hallelujah and to this day to this day he said he called me two nights ago and he said that we did three biopsies and everything that we found the last time is completely gone it's completely gone every I don't even want to see you anymore because it looks like a brand new stomach Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah my God is alive tonight if you have a need you find your promise in that book and you take a hold of it Hallelujah I apologize for my voice Hallelujah I have heard of it that thou would create squirrels I've heard of thee that thou would create a ram but now I see this is brother brandom and the rest of that quote th then the vision was made visible when God promised anything that's what he'll do Hallelujah that's what he'll do notice he says when you have a need perhaps like Joshua he had a need he never thought of the circumstance hallelujah oh the devil is always trying to get your vision on the circumstance he's always trying to keep your eyes fixed on what you can't do or where you can't go he's always trying to get you to look at the shackles or to look at the the the Devils that are just bound you or look at the walls that are around you oh glory to God but don't think of those circumstances Hallelujah he spoke it and it was God this is this is the rest of that quote he says do you believe that the sun still stood still friends do you believe that do you believe the scriptures Hallelujah so do I how did it do it how did it do it don't try to figure it out he says but it did it Joshua did it he raised his hands in that crucial moment he had access to God hallelujah and that's what happened it was timely the spirit of the Living God had seen the need of it and pushed upon Joshua to say it Hallelujah the same God seeing the need of Abraham the same see the need of confirming the scripture to me that that scripture is true Hallelujah that same God seen the need of those two predestinated boys and it was in that moment that he proved and he was confirmed in his word glory to God God thank you Lord thank you Jesus I just God is good he's so good he's he's worthy to be praised he's worthy to be glorified hallelujah amen thank you Lord he picks this up in the Easter seal he says let me say this again when the spirit has found you the individual and has come upon you it is the potential of your inheritance that God thought of you and made for you before the foundation of the world amen this is you friends you have the potential inheritance placed within you before the foundation of the world this this is the prophet of God saying this to you this isn't Caleb this is the prophet of God and he says and when we believe on Jesus Christ Our Savior and when we repent and are baptized and come to believe him God recognizes our repentance towards him our faith towards him and he sends down the abstract and the abstract is the assurance it's the guarantee that everything that was ever held against you you thoroughly repented Hallelujah and the property is boughten and you hold the abstract for that Assurance glory to God think on these things friends hallelujah oh my hope I hope this is building your faith tonight sure did build mine glory to God Amen oh he picks this up he says uh I like quotes amen is this all right amen glory says for you see Faith sees what God wants done yeah oh I hope this goes in faith doesn't look at the present time Faith doesn't see here Faith looks to see what God wants and it works accordingly that's what faith does it sees what God wants done and Faith operates through that glory to God this is beautiful he says faith is a long range Vision it it don't lower its sights it holds to the Target amen any good shooter out there knows that you see it's the long range it's the telescope it's the binocular that you don't look around here you don't use binoculars to look to see what time it is see you don't use that but you use binoculars to look way off and Faith does that Faith picks up God's binoculars both of them both sides the new and the Old Testament and he sees every promise that he's made and Faith sees it out y and Faith chooses that regardless of what the present tense says here he looks at the end he don't drop his sights to look this way he looks out yonder he keeps the Crosshair dead sinner of the word glory to God that's what faith does that's the faith in a man that does those things it's not anything that I did it's not anything that I could do but it's the faith that God placed Within Me by Revelation glory to God it's a long range Vision hallelujah thank you Lord the enemy's job is to keep you focused on the past friends it's to keep you focused on your failures it's to keep you focused on what you can't do anything about that God is already completely disregarded he doesn't even see he doesn't even know Hallelujah in Ezra we don't have to turn in our Bibles but just reference in Ezra they began rebuilding the temple and the Praises began to go throughout the city oh they were in Jubilee they had a jubilee they were building their Temple and they were out of they were out of uh of of of tribulation they were out of Exile Hallelujah but some of the priests began to lose focus o of the vision Their Eyes Were fixated backwards on the previous Temple yeah yeah on the previous blessing of God it says that the shouts of Praise versus the shouts of weeping could not be discerned they were living in the past friends oh my goodness it is the devil's full-time job to keep you living in the past to keep your eyes off the future but let me tell you something all the devil is is an accuser amen he will take you back as many years as necessary to get you living under guilt and under condemnation oh but brother Barry's message it was a few months back was so Grand the sin question is already settled the Bible says that you are free from that condemnation you are free from that guilt there is no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus who are in Christ Jesus tonight I claim that I am in Christ Jesus and I've laid it at the foot of the cross I am the biggest sinner I know but I've laid it all at the foot of the cross Hallelujah I've made the more mistakes than I could ever even wish to ever try to to explain to you oh but glory to God it's all under the blood of Jesus glory to God Amen and it's all settled in his eyes amen glory to God and I'm going to keep looking through that lens amen amen amen hallelujah I made mistakes friends I'm the worst but my goodness but that beautiful Grace that just makes his grace that much more beautiful to me oh Grace Grace Wonderful Grace oh because it isn't anything I deserve it's not Merit it's not works it's Grace it's sweet sweet Grace hallelujah oh that stirs my heart into action tonight hallelujah it's not time to to live carnally it's not time to friends it's not time to live in the past it's time to look forward to look to look toward the future goal we are living in the time of all things Hallelujah glory to God I want to be a part of it Hallelujah I am a part of it hallelujah oh glory the lord spoke to Zachariah through a vision after the temple had been failed right after those indiscernible shoutings had happened opposition right after those right after those IND discernible shouts had happened opposition began to rise and the enemy began to strike and the enemy always comes when you're at your weakest always and it did the work had ceased for years and years we read in Zechariah 4 if we want to turn in our Bible Zechariah 4 in verse one it says know this is about a vision that Zachariah has said now the the angel who talked with me came back amen we'll turn in our Bibles maybe if we can turn up there now the angel who talked with me came back and weakened me wakened me I'm sorry as a man who was wakened out of his sleep and he said to me what do you see so I said I am looking and there is a lampstand of solid gold with a bowl on top of it and on the stand seven lamps with seven pipes on the seven lamps two Olive treeses are by it one right by the bowl and the other on its left and I answered and spoke to the angel who talk to me saying what are these my Lord then the angel who talked with me answered and said do you not know what these things are and I said no my Lord amen I must have a different version but he said no my Lord and he answered and said this is the word of the Lord to zerubabel he says not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord then he says in verse seven he says who are you oh great Mountain before zerubabel you shall become a plain and he shall bring forth the capstones with shouts of Grace Grace to it the enemy stop the work with might and with power but it isn't going to be the same way when I come and finish the work it's going to be by my spirit Spirit sayith the Lord and when it's finished and this mountain that you're that you feel like is in front of you it will become a plain and it'll be my grace Hallelujah it'll be my grace that is pouring out hallelujah oh it'll come forth with shouts of Grace Grace my goodness who's thankful for his grace tonight hallelujah amen oh and by this Vision their hearts were stirred into action as we go to Hagi the first chapter is what we read in the at the beginning he says says the Lord stirred up the heart of zerubabel verse 14 I'm sorry let's read it off of here and the Lord stirred up the spirit of zerubabel the son of shiow governor of Judah and the spirit of Joshua the son of jehos the high priest and the spirit of all the remnant of the people and they came and did work in the house of the Lord of hosts their God their hearts were stirred the Lord caused a stir among the people that caused them to be put into action and it just it wasn't just on the priests it wasn't just on the leaders it wasn't just on it was on everybody Hallelujah it says the spirit of all the remnant of all the people and they came and worked on the house of the Lord hallelujah oh glory to God Amen is this all right tonight a little bible lesson I like I love I love the Bible we read of a familiar event that took place at the Battle of Jericho amen we can turn if we want to turn to Joshua 65 sorry brother Josh I'm giving you a little workout says Joshua 65 and when you hear the sound of the trumpet and all the people Shout with a great voice and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall Ascend up everyone on high right says that all the people shall Shout with the great shout and the wall of that City will fall down amen we're all familiar this is a Elementary story amen but I read the commentary on this and it says that this the shout of steadfast faith is in direct contrast to the moans of wavering faith and to the whales of discouraged heart wow Hallelujah contrasting here friends we're contrasting what those priests did and we're contrasting what these people did he says among the secrets among the secrets of the Lord I do not know of any more that is valuable more valuable than the secret of this shout of faith says the Lord said to Joshua see I have given thee into thine hand Jericho and the King thereof and the Mighty Men of valy and he has said I will give but I he didn't say I will give but he said I have given it belonged to them already and now they were called to take possession of it Hallelujah but the question was how right the question with us is always how are we going to do this it looked impossible but the Lord declared his plan as he always will maybe not to us sometimes but he always has a plan Hallelujah now no one can suppose this is still in that commentary no one can suppose for a moment that this shout caused the walls to fall but yet the secret of their Victory lay in this shout for it was the shout of a faith that dared on the authority of God's word alone to claim a promised Victory wow glory to God while as yet there were no signs of this Victory being accomplished and according to their faith God did unto them hallelujah oh and so when they shouted he made the walls to fall Hallelujah sometimes we just need to send a shout of Faith saying Lord I know I'm Healed Lord I know I'm delivered Lord I know that I've got these mistakes but you don't I've already I've already asked Lord Lord you've already placed them under the blood they in your Seas of forgetfulness Hallelujah glory to God sometimes it just takes a shout of Faith to dare to act on the authority of God's word amen and it was on the seventh day when they had had to get up out of bed when they had to get up out of maybe some discouragements when they had to get up out of this it was on the seventh day that their Victory would be made manifest glory to God is the seventh day now friends and it's time to turn our shouts to shouts of steadfast Faith Hallelujah glory to God oh if we could only catch that Vision Glory this is brother Brandon picking up in God uh calling Jesus on the scene oh if we could only catch that Vision the very Jehovah that made the heavens and earth is right in this little vessel of yours amen glory to God he's right in this little vessel of yours while we're sailing life Soloman for the Holy Ghost is Jehovah in spirit form you see in you see God the holy spirit is God himself in you Jesus said at that day you'll know that I am in the father and the father in me and I and you and me oh my then God all that God was he poured into Jesus and all that Jesus was he poured into church into the church he divided himself on the day of Pentecost the pillar of fire came down and busted itself the Shina glory and it put into put it into different ones tongues of fire was seen upon each one the Holy Spirit God identifying himself in human beings oh friends if we could only catch that Vision tonight Who's caught that Vision tonight glory to God he's identifying himself in you yes Hallelujah that is your promise tonight friends that is our promise the enemy will all always get you to look at your circumstance always he's always going to try and keep the vessel quiet he knows that he he can't destroy the spirit he knows that so he always goes for the vessel he always tries to destroy confidence in the vessel amen he's always trying to keep you quiet brother BR picks up this in the Ephesian church he he says no matter how just and upright a Christian is before the public and how gracious he is to his fellow a man doing not but good let him confess Christ as his Savior and acknowledge the operations of the gift of the holy spirit in tongues and prophecy and healing and miracles and he will be condemned oh but the spirit of this world hates the spirit of God because it can't overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit of Truth dwells friends the spirit of Truth dwells within you so he is going to try to destroy Your Vessel and he's going to do everything he can to destroy it Hallelujah glory to God we find a man friends we find a man in Mark the 10th chapter brother brandom dramatizes this so well but his name was bmus friends we're familiar with the story and he's standing at this he's standing at this gate and he's blind and he's not far from the very place in Jericho where that steadfast Faith had been shouted out where those walls were were in Ruins he wasn't far from that place and he had been at this gate and he had been blind but he had remembered her hearing those stories he remembered hearing those scriptures when he was a young man Hallelujah and he began to ponder on those things and he began to think my goodness if only that captain of the Lord's host that came to Joshua if only he was passing by this moment I'm I know I'm not far from this from the city from the ruins I'm not far from that City Jericho I'm not very far if only he would pass by one more time I know that he would touch my eyes I know that he would make me whole friends he was pondering these things he was pondering on he was thinking on those things glory to God and as he was doing that it said brother brenon dramatized as he was doing that it says that he became he says that the crowd started stirring he says what is that noise and it was Jesus it was that captain of Deliverance he was walking by he says what is that noise and just to dramatize if that's all right was what is that noise and his friends oh that's Jesus Jesus you mean Jesus the son of the son of David who we've been hearing about you mean Jesus the the Healer you mean Jesus The Miracle Worker oh my goodness he began shouting hey Jesus Jesus Jesus oh Jesus I can just hear him oh my goodness he just began shouting oh but it says the scripture says that they begin to to cry to quiet him they be they begin to try to hush him the crowd was like no don't what are you doing why are you making a fool of yourself oh what do you mean why am I making a fool of myself that very same Captain is here I was just praying about this very same thing and he's here I want him to hear my voice glory to God I want him to hear my voice tonight glory to God Jesus Hallelujah glory to God that Faith laid within that shout and nothing was going to hinder that Oh Glory he didn't yell he didn't yell Jesus Son of Joseph he didn't yell Jesus Son of Mary he didn't yell Jesus son of man he yelled Jesus Son of David all that Faith laid within him glory to God hallelujah he possessed the faith within his cry

way thy faith hath made the whole glory to God and immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way I think this is such a beautiful scripture because it says your faith has made thee
