[18:19] 22 Matthew 6 and 22 if you haven't say
[18:23] Amen the light of the body is the
[18:27] eye if therefore thine eye be single thy
[18:31] whole body shall be full of
[18:34] light but if thine eye be evil thy whole
[18:39] body shall be full of
[18:41] Darkness if therefore the light that is
[18:44] in thee be Darkness how great is that
[18:49] Darkness let's go to Romans chapter
[18:53] 6
[18:55] Romans chapter 6
[19:02] read that ver verse
[19:05] 13 Romans 6
[19:09] and13 the Bible says neither yield ye
[19:14] your members as instruments of
[19:17] unrighteousness Unto sin all right but
[19:20] yield yourselves unto God as those that
[19:24] are alive from the dead and your members
[19:29] as instruments of righteousness unto God
[19:33] for sin shall not have dominion over you
[19:37] thank God for ye are not under the law
[19:41] but under grace verse
[19:44] 19 I speak after the manner of a
[19:49] man because of the ministry of your
[19:52] flesh I mean because of the infirmity of
[19:55] your flesh for as ye have yielded your
[19:59] members servants to uncleanness and to
[20:03] iniquity yeah unto iniquity unto
[20:06] iniquity even so now yield your members
[20:10] servants to righteousness unto
[20:13] Holiness amen may the Lord had a
[20:15] blessing to the reading of his word you
[20:17] can have your
[20:19] seats
[20:20] amen how many glad to be in here tonight
[20:24] you know tonight I'm kind of going up
[20:28] operate as a chef all
[20:30] right all
[20:32] right kind of GNA operate as a chef
[20:35] tonight just to kind of give you a
[20:37] visual of what we're dealing with and
[20:40] tonight by the grace of God my subject
[20:43] is how do you measure up you know and I
[20:46] I I want you young people to understand
[20:48] that uhh uh you're important to the
[20:51] kingdom of God you know and when you go
[20:53] back through the scriptures you know
[20:55] there was a place where the children of
[20:56] Israel were marching through the
[20:58] Wilderness and the people complain and
[21:01] complain and God said you know what I'm
[21:03] not going to deal with y'all anymore I'm
[21:05] going to take all those young people and
[21:07] I'm going bring them into the promised
[21:08] land you know he took all the young
[21:10] people you know the people that the
[21:12] parents thought didn't understand the
[21:15] people that the parents may have thought
[21:16] were too young the people who thought
[21:19] that the parents were just going to be
[21:20] prayed God said I'm going to watch over
[21:23] them and I'm going to bring all of them
[21:25] into the promised land so you know if
[21:27] you just take that type Hallelujah that
[21:30] you are a part of the promised land but
[21:32] you know I I want to deal with uh how do
[21:35] you measure up and you know I want to
[21:37] talk about
[21:38] ingredients you know but just to give
[21:41] you a visual you know what this is amen
[21:45] this is called a measuring cup and you
[21:48] know this cup is used to put ingredients
[21:52] in to make something or to produce
[21:55] something and you know when we're
[21:57] looking at the Bible the Bible says that
[22:01] the light of the body is the eye and if
[22:04] therefore the
[22:06] eye be single the whole body shall be
[22:09] full of light so what the scripture is
[22:12] saying is very important what you look
[22:14] at hallelujah it's very important what
[22:17] you spend your time Hallelujah bringing
[22:19] it through your eyes why because your
[22:22] eye has a connection to the main thing
[22:24] I'm going to deal with tonight which is
[22:26] your spirit Hallelujah
[22:28] and you know uhh I'm sure you know the
[22:30] word has been preached in this place
[22:33] over and over and over again you know
[22:35] and and the fivefold ministry is here
[22:38] and you know HH uh I'm sure you've heard
[22:40] of the term Body Spirit Soul
[22:45] amen amen young people I see I got to
[22:48] walk tonight huh H y'all know I'm a
[22:51] walker and a talker Hallelujah but you
[22:53] know there's a body there's a spirit
[22:56] there's a soul right but tonight I don't
[22:58] want to deal with this I don't want to
[23:00] deal with your body Hallelujah because
[23:02] you spend a lot of time especially young
[23:05] girls and young men you spend a lot of
[23:07] time making sure the body look good all
[23:09] right you know you you uh no doubt
[23:11] tonight you put on a a a a nice pair of
[23:14] clothes and and and some of you sisters
[23:16] got your curls done and you know and
[23:18] some of you brothers made sure you had a
[23:20] line up or whatever the case is and you
[23:22] put on your nice shoes and your nice
[23:24] shirt and and the jacket and match you
[23:27] know you want to make sure that the body
[23:28] is presentable Hallelujah but you know
[23:31] one thing God doesn't care about your
[23:34] flesh come
[23:36] on Hallelujah you know we spend a lot of
[23:39] time worried about the body Hallelujah
[23:41] but what about your spirit H your spirit
[23:46] is is is if I can say it like this even
[23:49] more important than your body because
[23:52] what goes in your spirit Hallelujah will
[23:55] conduct how you walk in your body
[23:57] Hallelujah on so your spirit is very
[24:00] important Hallelujah and you know uhh
[24:03] what does it mean now I want I want you
[24:05] to I want you to grasp what I'm saying
[24:08] hallelujah there's a body there's a
[24:11] spirit there's a soul now catch it in
[24:14] between your soul and your body there's
[24:17] a spirit H now your spirit it can either
[24:21] connect in a good way to your soul or
[24:24] connect in a good way to your body
[24:26] Hallelujah cuz what's going on in your
[24:28] spirit is going to affect your body
[24:31] Hallelujah and if you don't get it right
[24:33] it can damn your
[24:36] soul yes
[24:39] sir
[24:41] Hallelujah but you know how do you
[24:43] measure up what's going in your spirit
[24:46] tonight it says that the light of the
[24:49] body is the eye hallelujah what are you
[24:52] watching what are you looking at what
[24:54] gets your attention you know hhhh and
[24:57] I'm sure you see this you know you could
[24:59] be riding down the road and a and and
[25:02] and a car pulls pulls up beside you and
[25:05] the music is
[25:09] booming and it got lights on the wheels
[25:13] you know they changing colors green red
[25:20] yellow why does that happen so you can
[25:24] turn and look yeah it's there to K get
[25:27] your attention Hallelujah and as your
[25:31] eye looks upon these things what the
[25:33] enemy is trying to do is deal with your
[25:37] desire oh
[25:40] my oh my what the enemy wants to do he
[25:44] wants to catch your attention by the
[25:47] things that can easily connect with your
[25:49] body Hallelujah get in your spirit then
[25:52] want you to Crave and desire those
[25:54] things
[25:56] wow and you say let's keep reading it
[25:59] says the light the same Matthew 622 it
[26:03] says the light of the body is the eyes
[26:05] so we dealing with the eyes and then it
[26:07] says if therefore thine eye be single
[26:10] then the whole body is full of light
[26:12] Hallelujah if you keep your eyes if you
[26:14] keep what you watch your whole body will
[26:17] have a measure of good things in it
[26:20] Hallelujah and did it says but if thine
[26:23] eye be evil see the same eye that sees
[26:27] good things is the same eye that can see
[26:29] evil things so it's up to you Hallelujah
[26:33] to have the right things in your
[26:36] spirit oh my you know in the in the Book
[26:39] of Mark Mark chapter 4 if you can put
[26:41] that up Mark chapter 4 verse uh 24 I'm G
[26:45] finish reading this this this verse of
[26:47] scripture first though it says but if
[26:48] thy eye be evil thy whole body be full
[26:51] of Darkness if therefore the light that
[26:54] is in thee be Darkness how how great is
[26:58] that Darkness see sometimes we don't
[27:00] realize Hallelujah by the things we
[27:03] watch and and what we love to look at at
[27:07] how dark is making you become wow
[27:13] wow you say well brother
[27:16] digs I like watching a little movie
[27:18] every now and then you know uh sometimes
[27:21] it has a little cursing in
[27:23] it sometimes it it has a little
[27:26] fornication in it oh man you know
[27:29] sometimes you know has a little naked
[27:31] girl in it or a naked
[27:33] boy what is that poon that's a
[27:39] measure of
[27:43] Darkness now you see this vessel started
[27:47] out
[27:49] clear but as the eye begin to partake
[27:52] certain things in
[27:54] measure the vessel got dark just a
[27:58] measure of it it's not all it still got
[28:00] some clear parts so there's still help
[28:02] Hallelujah all right there's still help
[28:04] why because it's coming in a measure
[28:06] Hallelujah and that's what Satan does he
[28:09] doesn't just you don't just Wham
[28:11] Hallelujah end up in a condition that's
[28:14] drunk and backslid and all no it starts
[28:16] with a
[28:18] measure you know

[28:23] one one of my great mothers in the
[28:24] gospel she sung a song sister Lewis
[28:26] little by little Hallelujah little by
[28:29] little that's what the enemy does he
[28:30] gives it to you little by little

[30:06] peace Hallelujah and I turned out to be
[30:08] this kind of
[30:11] vessel Hallelujah Mark chapter 4 the
[30:15] Bible says in verse 24 he says and he
[30:20] said unto them take heed what you hear
[30:24] with what measure you meet it shall be
[30:27] measured to you and unto you that here
[30:30] shall more be given Hallelujah so
[30:33] Hallelujah you can also be affected in
[30:35] your spirit by what you
[30:42] hear so it's very important to be
[30:46] listening to the right thing hallelujah
[30:48] it's very important Hallelujah to have
[30:51] your ears Hallelujah consecrated to the
[30:54] things of God you say well brother digs
[30:56] you know
[30:57] uh I I like I like uh uh Christian music
[31:02] but it it got to have a little Twain to
[31:04] it watch out you got to give me a little
[31:07] Bumble
[31:11] of at Le something that I could feel see
[31:15] that's your
[31:16] body and as long as you're trying to
[31:18] satisfy your body you'll take things in
[31:21] that will corrupt your soul
[31:25] wow you say what brother digs you know I
[31:28] need something that going to make me
[31:31] move you do
[31:37] huh you say
[31:39] yeah I like Christian music but I like
[31:42] Christian rock and
[31:45] roll I like Christian music but I like
[31:48] rap
[31:50] gospel I like Christian music but I like
[31:54] a visual where you know everybody
[31:55] shaking their head and going crazy and
[31:57] beating it on the
[32:01] drum that's another
[32:04] measure now you dealing with the first
[32:07] measure was what came into your eyes now
[32:11] the second measure is coming above what
[32:13] you hear look at the vessel it's getting
[32:15] darker and
[32:18] darker how many with
[32:23] me let's measure up but
[32:28] what if you come to church and and the
[32:32] preacher's preaching and he presents a a
[32:34] a opportunity for you to get prayed
[32:37] about that thing an opportunity for you
[32:40] to come and say well I don't want to
[32:42] just listen to anything amen I want the
[32:44] right thing going in my spirit I want
[32:47] the right songs going in my spirit I
[32:49] want songs that can produce the Life of
[32:51] Christ then what's
[32:56] happening that's
[33:02] right now you have another
[33:04] measure of Christ
[33:07] Hallelujah and I hope you're catching
[33:09] what I'm saying your life shouldn't be a
[33:13] seesaw a measure of the devil a measure
[33:16] of God a measure of the devil a measure
[33:17] of God somebody's got to
[33:20] win Hallelujah and why not Christ why
[33:24] not let Christ win because there are
[33:28] things that connect with your spirit
[33:30] Hallelujah and if you let it connect too
[33:32] much it's going to bring other things
[33:34] into your spirit because what I want you
[33:37] to realize is hallelujah these things
[33:39] that I'm talking about you know music or
[33:41] whatever you know I I I I could I could
[33:44] hit ding a little bit but I'm I I think
[33:47] you get the point you know if if you say
[33:49] well brother di I I I spent I spent a
[33:52] little time you know maybe an hour on
[33:55] social media
[33:58] ain't nothing wrong with
[34:00] that I'm pouring in the good glass right
[34:03] are you with me I'm pour in a good glass
[34:06] but then that hour on social media turns
[34:09] into four
[34:12] hours that which could have been good
[34:16] now turns into something bad because you
[34:19] spent too much time and did it got in
[34:22] your spirit and It produced something
[34:24] that's no
[34:25] good
[34:28] my okay listen I ain't going to be long
[34:31] Hallelujah I hope y'all with me how many
[34:35] understand what I'm talking about what
[34:36] am I talking about talk to me young
[34:38] people I'm talking about the measure of
[34:42] God or the enemy in your spirit
[34:48] amen
[34:51] listen in
[34:53] Romans chapter 6 where dealt with the
[34:57] previous verses before that Paul was
[35:00] saying when I will do good I do
[35:05] evil and he said that lets me know in my
[35:09] good evil is present Hallelujah I want
[35:12] you to understand right now at this
[35:14] youth meeting tonight the enemy is
[35:17] trying to make some of you
[35:18] disinterested because you feel like I'm
[35:21] good you know I'm good I come out of a
[35:23] good house and you know I you know I
[35:25] haven't I kept my virtue haven't done
[35:27] anything this and that but what's in
[35:29] your
[35:31] spirit cuz you could be right in church
[35:34] Hallelujah and your heart not be
[35:37] Sanctified where you have desires for
[35:39] other things outside of the church
[35:41] Hallelujah you know what brother Jason
[35:43] I've watched young ladies desire to get
[35:45] married and get married and and they
[35:47] find the guy they want Hallelujah and
[35:50] maybe he's a Christian and goes to a
[35:52] good church and got good parents but
[35:54] that guy Hallelujah that you find
[35:57] cripples to God in your life that ain't
[36:00] the right man for
[36:01] you you used to sing but now you don't
[36:04] sing no more but you found a good Gody
[36:06] you used to pray but now you don't pray
[36:08] no more why what's happening it's a
[36:11] measure of the wrong thing overpowering
[36:14] the God in your
[36:17] life and really really what's happening
[36:19] is the enemy will pervert something
[36:22] that's good having a desire to have a
[36:25] good Christian make somebody that's
[36:28] equally yolked Hallelujah that's a good
[36:30] desire but if that person comes in and
[36:33] begins to Rob your spirit from a
[36:36] relationship with God then that's the
[36:39] wrong person now ask yourself Hallelujah
[36:42] you say yeah I got him I got her but
[36:45] since you've been with that person how
[36:47] is your relationship with
[36:50] God uhoh we in it
[36:53] now we in it now got some relationships
[36:56] going going on not only relationships

[37:02] because that relationship is crippling
[37:04] Hallelujah your spirit to develop the
[37:07] Holiness of God the cleanliness of God
[37:10] remember in the Bible Hallelujah there
[37:12] were three that God gave talents to and
[37:14] some of you got talents but your talents
[37:16] are not on
[37:20] display
[37:22] why because there's too much of a
[37:24] measure of the wrong thing

[37:33] ingredients ingredients are things that
[37:36] goes into something to make

[41:07] enemy what gives the devil
[41:10] power or should I say who gives the
[41:13] devil
[41:15] power we
[41:17] do the enemy is only as great as you let
[41:21] him be thisen what the prophet of God
[41:23] says everybody all right Hallelujah that
[41:27] was kind of weak everybody all right
[41:29] Hallelujah y'all never know I might have
[41:31] some prizes after
[41:34] this Hallelujah Glory Glory listen this
[41:40] is this is in the message um Oneness of
[41:43] unity he says now when the meetings
[41:45] going on are we in a meeting tonight
[41:48] we're in a youth meeting Hallelujah I
[41:49] want you to see how important it is to
[41:52] have the right Spirit he says now when
[41:55] the meeting's going going on an evil
[41:57] spirit in the meeting that spirit is
[42:00] almost harmless until he can catch
[42:02] somebody that he can work
[42:05] through so your problems all the things
[42:09] you're worried about they're no good
[42:11] unless you give it
[42:15] attention the devil can't do anything in
[42:18] the service tonight unless you yield
[42:20] what your eyes your ears your spirit to
[42:28] him he's
[42:31] harmless let's keep going you know
[42:34] that's kind of amazing because when you
[42:36] think about that thought you know a lot
[42:38] of times we look at our life and we say
[42:40] I'm unhappy because you give the enemy
[42:44] Hallelujah power in that area to make
[42:47] you unhappy
[42:48] that's Hallelujah you say brother
[42:51] DS my
[42:54] anxiety because you give the the enemy
[42:56] power in that area to produce
[43:00] fear everything Satan has is a
[43:03] perversion of truth remember it started
[43:06] out with a clean vessel all right but
[43:09] it's the things you add in as a measure
[43:12] that makes it
[43:14] dark yes sir
[43:17] true I believe all of you are good
[43:20] people hallelujah remember the prophet
[43:23] of God said even a fallen child of God
[43:26] is a child of
[43:28] God so God let me say like this God will
[43:32] always have love for
[43:34] you but the thing of it is you got to
[43:36] love him back that's why some people not
[43:39] going to make it because they're not
[43:41] able to love God
[43:45] back Hallelujah listen he says now when
[43:49] the meeting's going on the evil spirit
[43:50] in the meeting that Spirit almost
[43:52] harmless until it can catch somebody
[43:56] that it can work through then when it
[43:58] can work through it'll certainly do
[44:01] damage because it is an evil spirit
[44:04] Hallelujah see so once you give play to
[44:07] it it can only produce what it is this
[44:10] can only produce what it is hallelujah
[44:14] and all the things in it you know if I
[44:16] just drink this Hallelujah over and over
[44:19] and over again now it say zero sugar but
[44:21] yeah
[44:23] right Hallelujah and a lot of
[44:27] times we have to have faith Hallelujah
[44:31] in the things that are no
[44:35] good you say what are you saying I have
[44:38] to trust that this has the right in all
[44:41] the ingredients that they say out in
[44:43] here but how do I
[44:45] know I have to believe it by
[44:48] faith and you do the same thing we do
[44:51] the same thing Hallelujah we actually
[44:54] have a Measure of Faith to believe
[44:55] believe in the devil got
[44:59] youright Satan say you sick you
[45:03] say yeah yeah yeah I am you turn into a
[45:07] believer of his thoughts right you give
[45:11] him your faith oh
[45:14] my listen it says he says then then you
[45:18] know it'll certainly do damage because
[45:20] it's an evil spirit it says and the Holy
[45:23] Spirit is here somebody say amen amen
[45:26] how many knows that the devil wants to
[45:28] be just like
[45:30] God he wants to be worshiped Hallelujah
[45:33] he wants to have all your attention
[45:35] hallu he wants to be light so everything
[45:38] he does he got it from God first but
[45:41] what he does is he perverts it
[45:42] Hallelujah church this right here cannot
[45:46] be made without
[45:51] water it starts clear
[45:54] first and and then as they begin to add
[45:58] measures of different ingredients
[45:59] measures of different things measures of
[46:02] this and measures of fruit toast and
[46:03] glute coast and no ghost and South Coast
[46:06] and East Coast and West
[46:08] Coast and as it goes from coast to coast
[46:10] it gets darker and
[46:13] darker that's what we don't want to be
[46:17] Hallelujah and everyone in here you have
[46:20] a right to be
[46:24] this
[46:29] listen he said the holy spirit is here
[46:31] somebody say
[46:32] Amen trying to find somebody to work
[46:36] through Hallelujah wouldn't you want to
[46:39] be that body tonight that the Holy
[46:41] Spirit can work through Hallelujah and
[46:43] if you and if you don't have that desire
[46:46] it's because you have too much of us in
[46:49] you I've been there been in church
[46:52] hearing the word I'm like yeah yeah yeah
[46:54] yeah yeah I hear you preacher but I just
[46:55] say ain't quite there yet that's because
[46:57] I had too much of the measure of the
[46:58] darkness inside of me but as I begin to
[47:01] Hallelujah lose my desire for those
[47:04] things it got clearer and clearer and
[47:06] clearer Hallelujah to where the darkness
[47:09] couldn't overpower me anymore Hallelujah
[47:12] you ask yourself why do we preach so
[47:14] hard about these things why do we come
[47:16] to you so hard about these things
[47:18] because we know what it means to
[47:20] overcome the flesh amen hallelujah and
[47:24] we Hallelujah there's a story that the
[47:25] prophet preach about a young
[47:28] girl I want you young girls to listen to
[47:31] me he said she was a young girl she grew
[47:35] up in a Christian home some young girls
[47:37] say
[47:38] Amen that was kind of weak she grew up
[47:42] in a Christian home you say but she
[47:45] chose a worldly
[47:48] boy now that worldly boy Hallelujah
[47:51] didn't have the same upbringing she had
[47:55] so what was in his Spirit was something
[47:57] completely different than what was in
[47:59] her
[48:00] spirit but what she had to do she had to
[48:03] yield to the thoughts and the actions
[48:05] that were in his Spirit to become what
[48:07] he was or either he had to yield to what
[48:11] was in her spirit to become what she is
[48:14] now which one are you
[48:18] doing but the story goes it says
[48:20] hallelujah she chose a boy that smoke
[48:24] why because she had two much of the
[48:26] wrong measure in her even though she was
[48:29] sitting in
[48:32] church oh my she chose a boy that smoked
[48:36] Hallelujah and he got her to
[48:40] smoking see if her spirit entered into
[48:45] the next level of Holy Spirit she could
[48:48] have never been overcome like that
[48:50] because there would have been something
[48:51] inside of her that would say no I was
[48:53] raised better than that I'm not going to
[48:55] do that
[48:56] Hallelujah and I know we all them men
[48:58] there Hallelujah we got friends we got
[49:00] worldly friends who are doing certain
[49:02] things even in the church they're doing
[49:04] certain things and there's something
[49:05] inside of you say no I ain't going to do
[49:07] that what is that that's the
[49:09] consciousness of God in you
[49:13] hallelujah oh
[49:15] my listen this girl she chose a boy that
[49:19] smoke and he got her to smoking and one
[49:22] night they went out on a date Hallelujah
[49:25] instead of giving her just a just a
[49:27] regular Coke he mixed up mess in it that
[49:30] was all so dark oh
[49:32] my and she couldn't tell the difference
[49:35] she thought she was drinking regular
[49:36] Coke but there was another measure of
[49:38] something else Hallelujah and sometimes
[49:40] the devil will give you something and
[49:42] because it might look the same there's
[49:44] another measure of something else in
[49:48] it he'll give you a nice looking boy
[49:51] that's in the church Hallelujah but just
[49:53] has a little measure of darkness and out
[49:55] of him that you can't see a nice looking
[49:58] girl who's in the church without the
[50:00] holy ghost that may have a measure of
[50:03] Darkness inside of her that you can't
[50:05] see can't
[50:08] see that's why it takes the Holy Spirit
[50:12] huh don't go by your flesh don't go
[50:15] after the things that this body going to
[50:17] want because you know what this body
[50:19] does this body is a measure of what
[50:22] dirt and it's going back to the dirt it
[50:25] has no
[50:26] value your body has no value that's why
[50:30] the the scripture says Flesh and Blood
[50:32] shall not inherit the kingdom of
[50:35] God we ever heard that
[50:37] before
[50:39] amen oh
[50:41] my and this boy once he gave us some
[50:45] Darkness he took a measure of something
[50:47] else some alcohol pour it in there and
[50:50] she couldn't tell the
[50:53] difference she drunk it and she started
[50:56] getting a little
[50:57] woozy and she drunk it and drunk it and
[50:59] kept drinking and next thing you know he
[51:01] took advantage of her and he stole all
[51:03] her virtue from her Hallelujah and it
[51:06] made her feel so bad CU she feel like
[51:09] well I'm here
[51:10] now I'm here now might as well continue
[51:14] but I want to say tonight you don't have
[51:16] to
[51:18] continue Hallelujah you don't have to
[51:21] continue Hallelujah all you have to do
[51:23] is tell the devil get back I will not go
[51:26] down this road with you anymore I have a
[51:28] greater hunger for something
[51:30] else Hallelujah but this girl who had no
[51:34] fight even though she was raised in
[51:37] church even though she came out of a
[51:39] good home Hallelujah in her spirit those
[51:43] things she was coming across she got to
[51:45] had a little desire for it and then that
[51:48] desire over take it went to smoking it
[51:50] with to drinking and the drinking
[51:52] Hallelujah the measure of alcohol turned
[51:54] into
[51:58] prostitution measure after measure of
[52:00] Darkness made the temple darker and dark
[52:03] and
[52:04] darker but she came out of a good
[52:07] home she was raised right she probably
[52:10] was sitting in church like you guys
[52:12] are but in her mind or in her spirit or
[52:15] in her ears she was intaking the wrong
[52:18] things that was resting up Hallelujah
[52:21] and you know Church she got to a place
[52:23] to where she smoked Hallelujah then she
[52:25] drank she turned into a prostitute
[52:28] Hallelujah next thing you know all of
[52:30] those
[52:33] measures all those measures begin to
[52:37] overcome
[52:38] her I'm going end up with us it started
[52:42] little by little then it turned into an
[52:44] overflow to where she wouldn't even
[52:46] fight anymore then she found herself
[52:49] being overcome all the way to the brim
[52:52] to when the prophet met her she was in
[52:54] the in s
[52:58] institution because she allowed these
[53:00] things by measure to get in her
[53:06] spirit and the prophet would talk to her
[53:09] and we got to find out who going to
[53:10] drink this now cuz we ain't going to

[1:00:42] learned about God every time God correct
[1:00:45] me is for my
[1:00:46] good every time he corrects me is
[1:00:49] because he loves me so much he doesn't
[1:00:51] want me to continue in error he doesn't

[1:00:57] darkness oh my listen he says see the
[1:01:01] two Spirits their motives objectives

[1:01:08] spirit is on you you are motivated by
[1:01:14] Spirit You're motivated by Spirit now

[1:01:41] motivates your life and if your life
[1:01:44] Bears the fruit of a Christian it's a
[1:01:46] Christian Spirit Hallelujah now you may
[1:01:49] be lift you may be filled now this is
[1:01:51] one of my favorite quotes that I like to
[1:01:53] give to the young people I ain't going
[1:01:55] be too much longer everybody all right
[1:01:58] listen the message come follow me we
[1:02:00] consider ourselves to be young people
[1:02:02] amen amen
[1:02:05] hallelujah come follow me he says you
[1:02:08] make yourself when you're
[1:02:10] young I want you to understand tonight
[1:02:13] you're making something wow wow through
[1:02:16] the course of your life you're making
[1:02:18] something how by the ingredients you
[1:02:21] take it through your eyes and your ears
[1:02:23] that gets your spirit that turns you
[1:02:26] into
[1:02:29] something you make yourself when you're
[1:02:33] young you set your Ambitions Hallelujah
[1:02:37] to what you want to do amen one of the
[1:02:39] most ambitious beard that we've heard
[1:02:41] about through this decade was Kobe
[1:02:45] Bryant but even he was so ambitious with
[1:02:48] his basketball he studied everybody he
[1:02:50] did all these things he still was just a
[1:02:53] man
[1:02:55] with Hallelujah ordinary unconverted
[1:03:01] desires even though he was a great star
[1:03:04] and and and and you know he was well
[1:03:06] loved in the basketball Community he got
[1:03:09] caught in
[1:03:10] adultery even though he he scored 50 60
[1:03:14] points and all these things his
[1:03:16] teammates say he wasn't a good
[1:03:19] teammate so even though he had measures
[1:03:21] of talent and all these other good
[1:03:23] things he still had measures of Darkness
[1:03:25] inside of
[1:03:27] him on one end he looked to be great he
[1:03:30] looked to be good Hallelujah because of
[1:03:33] his talent and then on the other end who
[1:03:35] he was on the inside made people sick oh
[1:03:39] Jesus
[1:03:41] Christ and I don't know him personally
[1:03:43] but I'm just going by the testimony of
[1:03:46] from others others that spoke on him he
[1:03:48] say ambitious to what you to do he said
[1:03:51] what you're trying to achieve in life
[1:03:53] Hallelujah you're Ambitions the things
[1:03:55] that you desire who you want to be will
[1:03:58] drive you
[1:04:01] yeah
[1:04:03] now don't let your Ambitions be solely
[1:04:06] about who you can be in this
[1:04:09] flesh let your Ambitions be who you can
[1:04:12] be in the
[1:04:13] spirit who you can be in God's
[1:04:18] kingdom because Abraham was just an
[1:04:20] ordinary man until you begin to take on
[1:04:24] and believe what God said he
[1:04:27] was Hallelujah if I could use this one
[1:04:30] before I close Samson was a great man
[1:04:35] until Hallelujah he let his flesh take
[1:04:40] over as long as he tried to operate
[1:04:43] Hallelujah by the word that God gave him
[1:04:46] he was over okay he was okay but as soon
[1:04:49] as he allowed his body to have control
[1:04:52] he failed in his spirit
[1:04:57] my listen he says you think of it and as
[1:05:01] you think of course your mind it
[1:05:05] presents it into your mind by an unknown
[1:05:08] something that dominates your
[1:05:11] mind Hallelujah I almost call this
[1:05:14] Hallelujah domination tonight I want you
[1:05:17] to understand young people where you are
[1:05:20] there's something in your life
[1:05:21] dominating you right now wow
[1:05:24] either it's God or the enemy something
[1:05:28] dominate you when you leave this church
[1:05:30] that spirit is going to come back on you
[1:05:32] and dominate you
[1:05:34] again if it's the wrong Spirit if it's
[1:05:37] God it'll increase if it's the enemy
[1:05:39] it'll
[1:05:45] increase you say and then when it
[1:05:48] becomes in your mind then you speak it
[1:05:52] Hallelujah that you're going to do do it
[1:05:55] and then your Ambitions drive you to
[1:05:58] it how do you measure up
[1:06:02] tonight this right here this
[1:06:06] Darkness it'll begin to if you get
[1:06:09] enough of us in your system it'll begin
[1:06:12] to shut down things in your body that
[1:06:14] was once operating
[1:06:17] right and when you get too much Darkness
[1:06:20] Inside by measure it'll begin to shut
[1:06:22] down things in your life that once God
[1:06:25] could
[1:06:29] use ask yourself ask yourself right now
[1:06:34] over the course of the of the past
[1:06:35] couple months how much of God have you
[1:06:38] really surrendered
[1:06:40] to you can ask yourself that your
[1:06:44] parents know your pastor know different
[1:06:46] ones may know who are close to you and
[1:06:47] are watching you they they they can they
[1:06:50] can they can see the dominating force in
[1:06:52] your life H you say oh praise God
[1:06:54] brother digs I have a good job but how
[1:06:56] much of that job is dominating your
[1:06:59] spirit you say oh brother digs you know
[1:07:02] I'm in a good place of school and and
[1:07:04] and I'm getting my book work and how
[1:07:06] much of that knowledge is dominating who
[1:07:08] you
[1:07:11] are in closing everybody all right we
[1:07:15] love those words
[1:07:17] inclosing Hallelujah in closing this is
[1:07:21] what the prophet of God says and I'm
[1:07:23] going to break into the of this quote
[1:07:24] this is in uh uh Waters of
[1:07:28] Separation Hallelujah can't we
[1:07:31] see don't we see Sodom on the
[1:07:34] earth talk to me young
[1:07:37] people see unlike your day my
[1:07:42] day my day brother even even more than
[1:07:45] brother Jason's day hallelujah
[1:07:47] hallelujah when he was a child coming up
[1:07:50] you couldn't walk around like people
[1:07:51] walk around
[1:07:52] today
[1:07:55] why because there was more of a
[1:07:57] consciousness of
[1:07:59] God but now because of the measure of
[1:08:02] Darkness that's been given to be okay
[1:08:05] the consciousness of God hallelujah you
[1:08:07] got to look for it
[1:08:09] now Hallelujah there was a time when a
[1:08:12] woman wouldn't wear pants to
[1:08:16] church even in a Baptist or a Methodist
[1:08:19] or a Pentecostal Church they wouldn't
[1:08:21] come like that why out of reverence to
[1:08:23] God
[1:08:26] but now the measures of these things
[1:08:28] have come in and made it dark and dark
[1:08:30] and everybody's like it's all right you
[1:08:31] know one thing about this Hallelujah one
[1:08:35] thing about this Hallelujah I want you
[1:08:37] to catch this the more you drink it the
[1:08:39] better it'll
[1:08:42] taste and you'll said you'll be thirsty
[1:08:46] because being thirsty is it's something
[1:08:48] natural Hallelujah but you're really not
[1:08:50] thirsting for this you're thirsting for
[1:08:52] this but but because this tastes better
[1:08:55] you'll run to this every
[1:08:57] time it'll become like second
[1:09:03] nature remember it starts out
[1:09:08] how that wasn't everybody it starts out
[1:09:11] how starts out how okay I don't want to
[1:09:15] hear a Brothers I want hear a sisters
[1:09:16] starts out how a that was weak
[1:09:21] sister I know you soft spoken that's
[1:09:23] good
[1:09:25] it starts out by just a
[1:09:28] measure and then you get more and more
[1:09:31] and more hallelujah how many of you
[1:09:33] sisters like cooking no don't raise your
[1:09:40] hand but you know when a you young
[1:09:43] Brothers may not do much cooking but you
[1:09:45] know let's just say Bing a cake huah you
[1:09:49] can use the same measuring cup to put in
[1:09:52] the ingredients
[1:09:54] two teaspoons of this and four teaspoon
[1:09:57] of that and this and milk and eggs and
[1:10:00] cream and butter and all that into a
[1:10:02] cake right trying to bake a cake you
[1:10:05] need all the right
[1:10:06] ingredients if you got the right
[1:10:08] ingredients you get the cake but what if
[1:10:09] you leave out one
[1:10:11] ingredient you're not going to get the
[1:10:13] product that you're looking
[1:10:16] for and I wonder how many of us tonight
[1:10:20] how many young people across the globe
[1:10:22] are leaving out ingredients
[1:10:28] listen the prophet of God say it
[1:10:30] behooves you to check your spiritual
[1:10:32] condition every hour of the day and be
[1:10:35] ready for you don't know what the time
[1:10:38] is coming God has made a way Oh my he
[1:10:43] said he sending everything the preaching
[1:10:46] of the word signs wonders he's give one
[1:10:49] message of preaching another signs
[1:10:52] message he said another thing
[1:10:54] not willing that any should
[1:10:57] perish God don't want nobody in this
[1:11:00] room to be lost but you got to have a
[1:11:02] will and a want to to move on with
[1:11:07] God he said his gifts in order in the
[1:11:11] church and so forth and still people
[1:11:14] continually made right on through and
[1:11:16] just like that didn't even pay any
[1:11:20] attention to
[1:11:22] it and I'm sure what I've said tonight
[1:11:25] you've heard it before maybe in a
[1:11:27] different way cuz there's only one
[1:11:28] brother
[1:11:29] digs you've heard it before
[1:11:33] amen but are you
[1:11:35] listening and one thing about God he'll
[1:11:39] bring it back why because he knows
[1:11:40] somebody's not doing
[1:11:42] it what is that that's his
[1:11:46] Mercy Hallelujah that's his Mercy he
[1:11:49] loves you so much he'll keep saying to
[1:11:51] you over and over and over again why
[1:11:54] because he wants you to get it he wants
[1:11:56] you to understand that he loves you and
[1:11:58] you're a child of
[1:12:01] God don't just brush him off because God
[1:12:04] ain't going no way Hallelujah and in my
[1:12:06] closing Hallelujah think about how do
[1:12:08] you measure up let's just say right now
[1:12:11] Hallelujah I was the boss of everyone in
[1:12:13] this room Hallelujah and you were going
[1:12:15] to receive wages by how you receive what
[1:12:19] I preach
[1:12:20] tonight and God showed me in the spirit
[1:12:23] each and every individual in this room
[1:12:25] how you receive what I preach
[1:12:30] tonight you think you have a big check
[1:12:32] or a small
[1:12:34] check you
[1:12:36] know you might want a big check but I
[1:12:39] said wages based upon what you receive
[1:12:43] and how you received
[1:12:44] it not what you want what are you doing
[1:12:48] with it Hallelujah because you go to a

[1:13:24] am the spirit
[1:13:26] man think about your spirit come on
[1:13:28] musicians I'm
[1:13:34] closing if they only realized that in
[1:13:37] their soul was a spirit of the devil
[1:13:41] that was dominating their life then it
[1:13:45] can't be something
[1:13:50] else this is not a night or a message of
[1:13:54] Doom and Gloom but let's be aware
[1:13:58] Hallelujah that the enemy is not just
[1:14:00] going to let you sweep or walk your way
[1:14:02] into heaven no you got to fight for it

[1:14:29] believe it was the prophet who said he
[1:14:31] didn't even know how to talk to God he
[1:14:33] would just go out there and say Mr
[1:14:36] God and I think of one place they uh it
[1:14:39] was somebody who
[1:14:41] just just begin to say ABCs or something
[1:14:43] to that
[1:14:45] effect
[1:14:47] amen see God God's not looking for us to
[1:14:50] be somebody big and great he's looking
[1:14:52] for us to be
[1:14:54] sincere
[1:14:56] [Music]
[1:15:01] Hallelujah that's what God
[1:15:04] wants he wants us
