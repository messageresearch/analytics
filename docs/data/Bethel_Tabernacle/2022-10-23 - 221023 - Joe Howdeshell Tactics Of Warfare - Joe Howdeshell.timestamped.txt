[4:37] we're happy to have her in she's been in
[4:41] town she's going to be working helping
[4:43] with the camp and she brought her a
[4:46] tribe along to go to the camp so we're
[4:48] happy to have all of them here with us
[4:51] sister Sarah's home folk amen there she
[4:53] comes amen praise the Lord everybody
[4:56] turn around and stare at her right there
[4:59] so we're happy to have her here today
[5:01] amen with us as well
[5:05] um I want to make just a few quick
[5:06] announcements before we turn brother
[5:08] Tony loose because once you turn him
[5:10] loose there ain't no stopping him amen
[5:12] but um there our midweek service for
[5:16] this coming week will be on Tuesday
[5:19] as opposed to our normal Wednesday
[5:21] service the reason being is because so
[5:24] many of our team members will be gone
[5:26] headed to the camp to get set up that's
[5:29] such a herculin effort that it takes
[5:32] over there and it's a it's a big event
[5:34] and so this is only our second annual
[5:37] camp I thought our first one was
[5:38] smashing in its success the Lord blessed
[5:41] it mightily and so uh this is our second
[5:44] annual camp and so so many will be gone
[5:47] on Wednesday we're going to hold the
[5:50] midweek service on Tuesday and I'd like
[5:53] to be able to at the end of the service
[5:56] maybe gather everybody kind of in the
[5:59] old way of the way we used to do it
[6:00] before pandemic kind of gave us pause on
[6:03] that but
[6:05] um amen we might as I have to go back to
[6:08] that somebody mentioned it to me
[6:09] recently I remember who now who it was
[6:10] saying my goodness let's go back was
[6:12] that you Caleb somebody mentioned it to
[6:14] me said man we need to go back and start
[6:16] gathering around the front again and
[6:18] it's like yeah you got my vote man but
[6:21] the we would have never stopped it but
[6:23] the planned demonic stopped it and uh
[6:25] amen but we're not going to give credit
[6:27] to the devil so we enjoy gathering
[6:30] around and so we're going to do that
[6:32] this Tuesday night to pray for our young
[6:35] people that the Lord will come on the
[6:38] scene mightily amen
[6:40] so quite naturally you can imagine
[6:42] brother Jason would certainly be
[6:43] expecting all of the parents Amen to be
[6:46] involved in that this this coming
[6:49] Tuesday night but it's a regular service
[6:51] come one come all and the there will be
[6:55] no live service here next Sunday on the
[7:00] 30th the camp services all of them
[7:04] should be live streaming we have the the
[7:08] stuff set up for that and we should be
[7:11] having a good even a better one than we
[7:13] had last year last year it wasn't all
[7:15] that great but we've added some
[7:18] equipment hopefully that'll come out
[7:20] better this year I will be posting
[7:22] myself or brother Matt will be posting a
[7:24] link
[7:25] to the Bethel Tabernacle WhatsApp chat
[7:28] for the live streaming of the entire
[7:31] Camp I would encourage everyone to hear
[7:33] it and be a partaker of it amen not just
[7:37] a a spectator but a partaker amen so
[7:41] we're looking forward to that
[7:45] um Brother Brad submitted a praise
[7:48] report today to praise to our lord for
[7:51] helping Rebecca and I find a nice place
[7:53] to live helping us through the
[7:55] transition we were all praying with them
[7:58] amen you remember that God answers
[8:00] prayer friends my goodness you start
[8:02] praying prayer this changes everything
[8:04] amen and uh says we found a nice place
[8:08] in helping us through the transition God
[8:10] be praised and just want to say how much
[8:12] I appreciate our ministry in Beaufort me
[8:16] too amen praise the name of the Lord I
[8:19] want to give you a quick just a quick
[8:22] brief update on our current where we are
[8:26] in the building phase now as you know we
[8:30] finished phase one I think it looks
[8:31] amazing and uh phase two has been
[8:34] underway for a little while now brother
[8:36] Kenny was actually going to give a
[8:39] presentation today but we couldn't get
[8:41] that together we didn't have enough
[8:43] information for that but what I would
[8:46] just like to kind of put as a as a
[8:49] thought in your mind is that
[8:52] there has been activity going on behind
[8:56] the scenes almost like it's almost like
[8:58] the silence under the seventh seal
[9:00] there's a that you don't look like A
[9:02] lot's going on but A lot's happening
[9:04] behind the scenes amen and uh but this
[9:07] is this is the uh The Unsung Parts where
[9:10] all the brothers are working behind the
[9:12] scenes and there's planning there's
[9:13] plans there's meetings with the city
[9:15] which we've had there's permits that
[9:18] have to be gotten there's there's
[9:19] drawings there's architectural there's
[9:22] engineering stamps and this all has to
[9:24] go about and then you you have to you
[9:26] just have to go at the pace that you can
[9:28] and I just want you to know lest you
[9:31] think nothing's been happening uh quite
[9:33] a bit has actually already been
[9:35] accomplished and we've also been saving
[9:37] money the trustees felt like that they
[9:40] wanted to get at least to the fifty
[9:43] thousand dollar range before we start
[9:44] that's not going to build our second
[9:46] phase but I have every confidence that
[9:50] once we get once the people start seeing
[9:52] that again then a spirit to give you're
[9:54] already been giving it's been
[9:55] accumulating and all of your stuff that
[9:57] you send in weekly has been uh you know
[10:01] inching it up and up and up and we
[10:03] should have that threshold met in fact
[10:05] as we're probably there now and so
[10:08] that's enough to get us started but
[10:10] we're still working on uh some plans and
[10:13] some engineering and and the permits
[10:15] from the city so just keep that in
[10:17] prayer that the Lord will uh you know
[10:20] keep that moving forward it is going
[10:23] forward so I just want to make that
[10:26] announcement to you now I want to come
[10:29] to another announcement my final
[10:30] announcement
[10:32] I'm not going to minister today we have
[10:35] brother Joe how to show who's going to
[10:37] carry the service for us today and um I
[10:40] had a little bit of a troubling symptom
[10:44] this morning as you all know the history
[10:46] that I've dealt with uh with a heart
[10:48] situation I feel perfectly fine it was
[10:51] just a mild symptom and I did a a an ECG
[10:55] on my on my watch which sister Meredith
[11:00] and brother Andrew felt just enough
[11:01] caution with the accompanying symptom
[11:04] which was really just heartburn and the
[11:06] reason that's a symptom for me is
[11:08] because I don't I don't ever get
[11:09] heartburn ever and so I indigestion and
[11:13] that's a different thing that's that was
[11:14] The Telltale sign when I first started
[11:16] having problems that is not back I
[11:19] haven't had that all is good I'm
[11:22] exercising fine I have no problem with
[11:24] it whatsoever but this morning I had a
[11:28] terrible bout of the of heartburn and I
[11:31] couldn't get it to stop and that's what
[11:33] was alarming and then they looked at the
[11:36] ECG and said and that's only one lead
[11:38] because a watch has technically Savvy as
[11:41] it is is only one lead so they
[11:43] recommended I go to get a 12 lead I did
[11:46] I went right to the fire department
[11:48] right behind my house they took me right
[11:51] in EMTs and everything was normal that
[11:54] said everything looked good and there
[11:56] there was no nothing that concerned them
[11:58] at all brother Andrew conferred with the
[12:01] they actually knew each other the EMT
[12:03] and they conferred and they said nothing
[12:05] jumped out at them at all everything
[12:07] looked good brother Andrew's words where
[12:09] it looks very good so I feel perfectly
[12:12] fine but just as a as a matter of
[12:16] caution and as a better part of wisdom
[12:18] they both recommended that I not
[12:20] Minister today and get through the
[12:22] weekend take it easy maybe the Lord knew
[12:24] I just need needed some more rest I have
[12:27] been very tired and been going just
[12:30] almost at a supernatural Pace this
[12:32] entire year and it's been quite unusual
[12:35] to me I will assure you I promise you
[12:37] I've only taken the meetings that I've
[12:40] felt leded to take and I have
[12:41] disregarded many other invitations but
[12:44] then we've I've also had a lot of of
[12:47] unscheduled stuff tucked in I've had to
[12:50] leave town and go preach funerals I've
[12:52] had to leave town and for my wife's
[12:54] parents and and we just got back from
[12:57] that and so you know there's probably
[12:59] been a half a dozen unscheduled trips
[13:02] tucked in between all of the many
[13:05] scheduled meetings that I've taken this
[13:08] year haven't taken so many since my days
[13:11] of evangelizing amen and so it's uh it's
[13:14] caught up to me maybe the Lord knew I
[13:16] needed to rest today maybe it's all of
[13:18] the above maybe brother Joe's got
[13:20] something and I'm going to be listening
[13:22] for What the Lord Has for me today now
[13:25] you need to take that as a personal
[13:27] challenge to say Lord what do you have
[13:28] for me today because I know that there
[13:33] are no accidents there are only God
[13:36] sentence amen and so we're looking
[13:39] forward to that today so I'm going to be
[13:41] right here on the platform pulling hard
[13:43] amen and uh me and brother Luther we get
[13:46] a we get an echo of amen's going and
[13:48] then and then brother Joe comes over
[13:50] here in his shouting corner and brother
[13:52] Charles and different ones of y'all some
[13:54] of y'all are are more loud than others
[13:56] and I wish all of you were more loud
[13:57] than each other amen so amen I love to a
[14:01] good pull on the word of God and I just
[14:04] wanted to say that to you personally so
[14:05] you can see that I am totally fine feel
[14:07] perfectly fine uh and this is just kind
[14:10] of uh taking a better safe than sorry
[14:12] but the Lord knows all about it
[14:15] amen so God bless you today Amen brother

[47:43] I'm so glad this morning we haven't
[47:45] Oasis amen if you have your Bibles while
[47:48] you're standing we'll go ahead and
[47:50] read a verse of scripture Matthew
[47:53] chapter 16.
[47:57] verse
[48:02] we'll just start with verse uh
[48:05] 16. Matthew chapter 16 verse 16.
[48:11] and Simon Peter answered and said Thou
[48:13] Art to Christ the son of the Living God
[48:16] this was the answer to the question that
[48:18] Jesus gave him
[48:19] who do men say that I am
[48:22] some say you're John the Baptist Elias
[48:26] and Jesus answered and said unto him
[48:28] blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh
[48:31] and Blood hath not revealed unto thee
[48:33] but my Father which is in heaven
[48:36] and I say also unto thee that thou art
[48:39] Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my
[48:42] church in the gates of hell
[48:44] shall not Prevail against it
[48:46] let's bow our heads Heavenly Father
[48:49] Lord as we stand here so
[48:52] thankful Lord for your blessings and
[48:54] thanking you Lord that we're here for
[48:56] another opportunity Lord to stand and to
[48:59] minister to your people Lord the
[49:01] precious purchase of your blood Lord as
[49:04] Lord So Unworthy Lord of anything that
[49:06] you would give us Lord but we stand here
[49:09] father with open arms and Open Hearts
[49:11] Lord ready to receive your word o God
[49:13] and Lord let it not just come into US
[49:16] Lord but flow through us oh God come in
[49:18] and grow Lord that we can Proclaim this
[49:21] gospel to others Lord and show it to our
[49:23] brothers and sisters father in Jesus
[49:26] name we pray amen you can be seated
[49:30] now just as a little uh
[49:33] Foundation here and I wanted to read
[49:35] this scripture because
[49:37] what many people think that the church
[49:40] uh the Catholic church was built upon
[49:42] Peter because it says in Thou Art Peter
[49:45] but we know that Jesus wasn't saying the
[49:49] church is built on a man
[49:50] but when you ask him who do you who do
[49:52] men say that I am he said you are the
[49:55] Christ the son of the Living God he said
[49:57] Upon This Rock
[49:59] the revelation of who Jesus Christ is
[50:01] that's where I'll build my church
[50:04] see it's the Revelation and so that's
[50:06] the very Foundation we have to go all
[50:08] the way back to the very Foundation if
[50:09] you want to start off right
[50:11] so now Jesus is telling Peter he says
[50:14] and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail
[50:16] against it now I don't know about you
[50:18] and the and the the title of this sermon
[50:20] this morning is the tactics of warfare
[50:22] all right but I've never seen a gate
[50:24] ever attack anybody
[50:27] a gate is a fortification yeah so what
[50:29] is Jesus referring to when he's talking
[50:31] to Peter here that the Gates of Hell
[50:33] won't Prevail against you
[50:35] or it won't Prevail against this
[50:37] revelation
[50:39] see
[50:40] so what is the gates of hell all right
[50:42] so in our bodies in our lives and and
[50:45] all that we have
[50:47] our strongholds that that when we're
[50:52] born again of the spirit of God
[50:55] the Holy Spirit comes in and our life is
[50:57] changed
[50:59] but there's a little bit of something
[51:00] that's left in there
[51:02] now why don't we turn to Second
[51:03] Corinthians
[51:05] 10 and we'll read about what Paul says
[51:08] here
[51:16] now I Paul beseech myself beseech you by
[51:20] the meekness and gentleness of Christ
[51:23] who in presence and base among you but
[51:26] being absent and bold toward you
[51:28] but I beseech you that I may not be bold
[51:31] when I'm present with that confidence
[51:34] wherewith I think to be bold against
[51:35] some which think up to us we walked
[51:38] according to the flesh for though we
[51:40] walk in the flesh
[51:43] we do not war after the flesh
[51:46] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[51:50] carnal But Mighty
[51:52] through God to the pulling down of
[51:55] strongholds see
[51:57] now when he says that the weapons of our
[51:59] Warfare are not carnal that means it's
[52:01] not psychology you can't get a self-help
[52:04] book to make you better
[52:06] it might make you a better citizen or a
[52:08] better Democrat or a debt a better
[52:09] Republican or whatever it will be but
[52:12] it's not going to pull down those
[52:13] strongholds in your life
[52:16] there's only one thing that'll do that
[52:17] as the weapons that God has provided for
[52:19] you this day
[52:21] they're not carnal
[52:23] and also the strongholds are not your
[52:25] brother and sister
[52:27] amen we don't try to tear down one
[52:30] another
[52:31] we try to build each other up
[52:33] [Applause]
[52:35] amen
[52:38] as Paul was saying I may not be bold
[52:41] when I don't want to I don't want to
[52:42] come and do these things with confidence
[52:44] we're with that thing to be bold against
[52:45] some which think of as we walked
[52:47] according to flesh for though we walk in
[52:49] the flesh we don't war after the flesh
[52:51] what he's saying we had to live in these
[52:53] bodies in these pest houses that we have
[52:57] oh we don't live according to the Flesh
[53:00] of this world
[53:02] we've got a an answer this morning oh my
[53:06] God we've got an empty grave that we can
[53:07] look to
[53:08] [Music]
[53:10] Because He Lives
[53:12] now we have an oasis amen that we can
[53:14] run to
[53:16] get a Cool Drink of Water amen
[53:20] now
[53:22] we want to talk about that how that and
[53:24] all right let's go ahead in Ephesians 6
[53:26] and I'm just going to cover this right
[53:27] fast and we'll we'll go ahead and read
[53:29] that one Ephesians 6 10.
[53:34] keep your Bibles in your laps this
[53:35] morning
[53:38] did you bring your sword with you
[53:40] [Applause]
[53:40] [Laughter]
[53:42] oh my we don't go into battle without a
[53:44] sword do we
[53:47] amen this is your weapon this morning
[53:49] amen we're gonna find out exactly what
[53:51] the what weapons that we need
[53:55] finally my brethren be strong in the
[53:57] Lord and in the power of His might put
[53:59] on the whole armor of God that ye may be
[54:01] able to stand against The Wiles of the
[54:03] devil for we wrestle not against flesh
[54:05] and blood but against principalities
[54:07] against Powers against the rulers of the
[54:10] darkness of this world against spiritual
[54:12] wickedness in high places
[54:15] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[54:17] of God that he may be able to withstand
[54:19] in the evil day and having done all to
[54:22] stand therefore having your loins go to
[54:24] about with truth we ought to have the
[54:25] truth
[54:27] you can't walk in there
[54:29] you've got to have the truth
[54:32] that's the foundation
[54:34] you can have all kind of ideas about
[54:36] things
[54:38] feel good stories or whatever but you
[54:40] better have the truth and that's
[54:41] something that's something that is so
[54:43] they can't even nail down what truth is
[54:45] anymore
[54:47] I can't even tell you what a man and a
[54:49] woman is anymore
[54:51] I saw they when they were um
[54:53] interviewing the woman to be the the uh
[54:56] the uh
[54:57] Supreme Court
[54:59] a woman who's going to be
[55:01] um
[55:02] deciding the the cases that's going to
[55:04] impact all of our lives in the in the
[55:06] nation
[55:07] and they asked her what is the
[55:09] definition of a woman yeah
[55:11] and here she is a woman
[55:13] calls herself one she said I can't even
[55:16] tell you that
[55:19] it's it's not a politically expedient
[55:24] same argument is going what's going in
[55:26] Jesus day when he's talking to Pilot
[55:28] pilate said what is truth so these
[55:30] philosophers have been doing this for
[55:32] years wow trying to obscure the lines
[55:34] and and blur the lines between right and
[55:36] wrong good and evil what's up is down
[55:39] now what's down is up
[55:41] and the Bible tells us that it would be
[55:43] that way in this day
[55:44] that they would call good evil and evil
[55:46] good
[55:48] if you stand for what's right you're
[55:50] considered a bigot and a hater
[55:55] is that right
[55:58] but every time that there's ever a
[56:00] battle so we want to go back to the
[56:01] battlefield the tactics of warfare
[56:04] so
[56:06] brother Branham he typed when they run
[56:08] into the promised land a lot of folks
[56:10] think well that's when we die and go to
[56:11] heaven but that's not what he typed it
[56:13] as when they entered into Canaan land
[56:15] that was receiving the Holy Ghost
[56:18] foreign
[56:20] they had to fight for every inch of
[56:21] ground that they had
[56:24] but now anytime that uh that a nation
[56:26] invades another nation and we see what's
[56:28] going on in Russia and Ukraine
[56:30] that every time that even though there's
[56:32] a a overwhelming Force that'll take it
[56:36] and I think about in in the days of uh
[56:38] when Germany attacked Poland and
[56:40] attacked France and attacked Russia and
[56:42] the different nations and took them over
[56:45] they had little groups in those every
[56:47] one of those areas and in Russia they
[56:50] had the partisans which was um they were
[56:52] like guerrilla warfare they would like
[56:54] blow up the Rail lines they would um
[56:57] they would try to do everything they
[56:58] could to uh to slow down the advance of
[57:01] the enemy
[57:03] that was called a pocket of resistance
[57:05] and any time that ever happens is always
[57:08] it's there to just worry and agitate it
[57:11] it doesn't really do a whole lot in the
[57:13] scheme of the war but it does help
[57:15] behind the lines if they need a bridge
[57:17] blown or or to interrupt the supply line
[57:21] and see that's the same as you and I
[57:23] when we receive the Holy Ghost
[57:25] he comes in an overwhelming for us but
[57:28] see there's still some things left in US
[57:31] little pockets of resistance is left
[57:35] little partisans in the in the French
[57:37] call it the French Resistance
[57:39] and they were well they were well
[57:41] trained well equipped and they had a
[57:44] purpose yeah and that purpose was to
[57:46] disrupt the enemy
[57:49] now the pockets of resistances in US is
[57:52] is demon powers
[57:54] it's the old man the Old Devil that's
[57:58] still in there
[57:59] and even when they took the the promised
[58:02] land they still had the jebusites and
[58:04] the Hittites and the parasites and the
[58:06] Canaanites amen yeah
[58:08] that they had to fight he's one of them
[58:10] although they were in The Promised Land
[58:14] and just because you received the Holy
[58:16] Ghost does not mean that you're immune
[58:18] from battles
[58:19] doesn't mean that you're immune from
[58:21] these these uh pockets of resistance in
[58:23] your life
[58:26] and in each one of these little
[58:28] strongholds is in your life
[58:30] is the enemy and he can stay there and
[58:33] he could send out little forces
[58:35] send out strike teams strike parties and
[58:39] disrupt everything in your life
[58:42] a lot of times me and he'll that little
[58:44] pocket of resistance called lust he'll
[58:46] send out a Strike Team
[58:48] and the next thing you know he said cut
[58:50] off your supply line
[58:54] brother Branham asked Paul Rader one
[58:56] time he preached like 2 000 messages in
[58:58] a row he said how do you do it he said
[59:00] as long as I don't get a kink in the
[59:02] hose
[59:04] it just flows right on down
[59:06] let me tell you something the devil's
[59:07] here to put a kick in your hose this
[59:09] morning
[59:11] in any way that he can out if it's with
[59:14] your job if it was with finances if it's
[59:16] with your family
[59:18] it was with somebody at church maybe
[59:20] maybe you thought they said a little
[59:21] something and it hurt your feelings
[59:23] see God the the devil's always there to
[59:26] try to put something between you and
[59:29] that supply line from God
[59:31] [Applause]
[59:32] we don't need to get that hose kinked up
[59:35] this morning
[59:37] young people if you're listening to me
[59:39] let me tell you something less supply
[59:41] line ain't in Facebook it ain't in tick
[59:43] talking it ain't in whatever the
[59:45] mother's media platforms are
[59:47] [Music]
[59:49] let me tell you something I just heard
[59:50] too and I didn't know this that that
[59:52] Tick-Tock thing comes from China
[59:54] and they they actually program an
[59:56] algorithm
[59:57] and the algorithm that their children
[59:59] have in China is how to be a better
[1:00:01] person how to achieve at school how to
[1:00:04] do this that another but the algorithmic
[1:00:06] program for the United States is
[1:00:08] absolute foolishness
[1:00:11] it's sexual it's dancing it's it's it's
[1:00:13] funnest jokes and practical jokes
[1:00:17] to corrupt the minds of the young people
[1:00:19] don't you think Satan they owned the war
[1:00:23] he's on his job this morning
[1:00:27] I had no idea that they could do that
[1:00:30] there's certain algorithms yeah
[1:00:32] let me tell you something the devil's
[1:00:33] got an algorithm
[1:00:35] he knows exactly he's using those
[1:00:37] programs
[1:00:39] I don't believe all that's the mark of
[1:00:41] the beast but I tell you what
[1:00:43] um the devil can certainly use it

[1:01:36] find something
[1:01:38] older people too
[1:01:42] if you've got in your heart you can take
[1:01:45] a man out of the city and put him in the
[1:01:47] middle of the Rocky Mountain somewhere
[1:01:51] won't see another woman won't see a
[1:01:53] bottle of whiskey won't see a marijuana
[1:01:54] joint
[1:01:55] but it's still in his heart
[1:01:58] even though he's isolated away from it
[1:02:01] right it doesn't matter he still got it
[1:02:04] there
[1:02:05] and as soon as he gets around it boom
[1:02:07] picks it right back up again you see men
[1:02:09] in prison all the time they go to
[1:02:11] prisons they can't get it but it doesn't
[1:02:13] take away the desire
[1:02:15] see
[1:02:16] what we need this morning is a is a
[1:02:18] heart change
[1:02:20] [Applause]
[1:02:21] back in my back in my Wild and Woolly
[1:02:23] days as a Young Man
[1:02:26] I used to listen to a rock group and I
[1:02:28] hate to even call the name of them but
[1:02:29] they were good guns and roses and they
[1:02:31] had a a a album called Appetite for
[1:02:35] Destruction
[1:02:36] well I'm so glad this morning God
[1:02:39] changed my appetite amen
[1:02:41] I have an appetite for those things
[1:02:43] [Applause]
[1:02:45] it doesn't matter what if you take it
[1:02:47] away from if they've still got the
[1:02:48] appetite they're still going to Crave it
[1:02:51] gotta change the appetite
[1:02:54] help me Lord this morning
[1:02:57] oh my God
[1:03:01] but here's what you got to do here's
[1:03:03] what the enemy wants to do and this is a
[1:03:05] military
[1:03:06] cut off the beans bullets Band-Aids and
[1:03:08] then you get the bad guys beans is the
[1:03:11] food bullets is ammunition Band-Aids and
[1:03:13] medical supplies let me tell you
[1:03:15] something that's a tactic of warfare
[1:03:17] that's the three B Four B's beans
[1:03:20] bullets Band-Aids and bad guys y'all
[1:03:21] always remember that for the rest of
[1:03:23] your life
[1:03:26] you see we got to do that
[1:03:28] yeah we've got to cut the enemy off too
[1:03:30] you see this resistance Works in both
[1:03:32] ways we got to cut their supply line off
[1:03:37] is in your heart that's feeding that
[1:03:39] thing cut it off amen Jesus said if your
[1:03:42] eye feeds you plug it out now that's a
[1:03:45] metaphor
[1:03:47] we all know what a metaphor is
[1:03:50] but also it could be a medical
[1:03:52] terminology
[1:03:53] because if you get gangrene in your
[1:03:56] finger you better cut it off
[1:03:59] because it's going to poison your whole
[1:04:00] body
[1:04:01] if you get in the military a lot of
[1:04:02] times in the Army in the Civil War they
[1:04:04] get gangrene to arm or leg cut it off
[1:04:06] maybe that's what Jesus was referring to
[1:04:08] if it offends you if it's going to kill
[1:04:10] you you better get rid of the thing
[1:04:12] yeah
[1:04:14] if you stop by brother at a little
[1:04:16] convenience store and there's a there's
[1:04:18] a sweet-eyed young lady in there that
[1:04:20] bass her eyes at you every time you come
[1:04:22] in there and buy that
[1:04:23] Coke and pack of nabs that's what we
[1:04:25] call it packing naps cheese crackers
[1:04:28] and you start and you start kind of
[1:04:30] lacking that attention
[1:04:33] you start kind of liking that attention
[1:04:35] you better stay there you go
[1:04:38] you better take you another route yeah
[1:04:42] if you start getting on the Internet and
[1:04:44] you start seeing things that are that
[1:04:46] algorithm that's popping up
[1:04:48] better cut the thing off
[1:04:49] [Music]
[1:04:51] let me tell you something
[1:04:52] because what it's going to do is is it's
[1:04:54] going to cause you and I'm speaking from
[1:04:57] experience we've all dealt with this
[1:04:58] mess what it does is it causes you to
[1:05:01] start craving after that mess it's
[1:05:04] dopamine that's released in your brain
[1:05:05] it's a it's a physical thing that's
[1:05:07] actually going on
[1:05:09] yeah it's a it's an instant immediate
[1:05:11] reward
[1:05:12] to what you're looking at is it's a drug
[1:05:15] you can actually get addicted to these
[1:05:17] things and people do get addicted
[1:05:19] just all right this morning
[1:05:24] but let me tell you something the devil
[1:05:27] ain't playing paintball
[1:05:29] he ain't playing flag football
[1:05:32] he's playing for keeps
[1:05:34] he wants you he wants me he wants my
[1:05:37] children he would love nothing better
[1:05:39] than to see this church completely gone
[1:05:43] because we're we're standing in his way
[1:05:46] this bride in this world is standing the
[1:05:48] only thing holding him back
[1:05:50] it's the only thing holding that
[1:05:52] incarnate devil from standing on this
[1:05:54] Earth and being worshiped is God
[1:05:58] the Incarnate Satan will be standing in
[1:06:01] shoe leather is what we call it
[1:06:03] I mean incarnate devil will be but
[1:06:05] incarnate God will too
[1:06:08] that's you and I yeah
[1:06:12] you want to see Jesus this morning
[1:06:15] just look just look at your neighbor
[1:06:18] oh if we could just see Jesus in each
[1:06:20] other
[1:06:21] let me tell you something I want to see
[1:06:23] Jesus when I look in the mirror
[1:06:27] I don't see the old man oh my
[1:06:32] oh God I want to I want him to die I
[1:06:36] won't even be buried and rotten
[1:06:38] and never come up again
[1:06:40] that old man
[1:06:43] I don't want to just put on a a chain
[1:06:46] turn over a new Leaf this morning put on
[1:06:48] a new suit of clothes I won't exchange
[1:06:50] my life for his life
[1:06:52] [Applause]
[1:06:54] and the only way I know to do that is
[1:06:57] die to myself
[1:06:59] I was talking the other morning about
[1:07:00] prayer how that we we say prayer and we
[1:07:03] say things and it's like well it's a
[1:07:05] wish list well bless me and give me this
[1:07:06] and give me that oh oh Lord give me a
[1:07:08] Mercedes Benz all my friends have them
[1:07:12] I don't pray that
[1:07:15] but sometimes that's what prayer becomes
[1:07:18] well what prayer really is is a
[1:07:20] relationship it's a dying out of you and
[1:07:22] letting him come in more
[1:07:24] it's a conversation with the Lord
[1:07:27] talking to him oh God search my heart
[1:07:31] first off God I'm acknowledging you as
[1:07:34] Lord Of My Life
[1:07:36] I'm putting aside everything I'm
[1:07:37] shutting out all the voices I'm shutting
[1:07:39] out all the things in this world that
[1:07:41] takes my time away from you Lord I want
[1:07:44] to listen to you this morning what do
[1:07:45] you have to tell me
[1:07:46] [Music]
[1:07:48] can we find time in the morning to do
[1:07:50] that
[1:07:50] oh just for a little while I know we
[1:07:53] worked and we got things but just spend
[1:07:55] a little bit of moment just quietly
[1:07:56] alone like brother Jason was saying
[1:07:58] before you grab your phone before you
[1:08:00] turn on the the weather or anything else
[1:08:03] just pick up your Bible and say Lord
[1:08:05] what would you have me to read this
[1:08:06] morning what would you have me to say to
[1:08:08] read this morning and to take it to my
[1:08:10] old God I read your word now watch over
[1:08:12] that word in my heart hide it oh God let
[1:08:15] it grow Within Me Lord let me say
[1:08:17] something today that'll edify your
[1:08:19] kingdom God take away everything in me
[1:08:21] that's not like you let me hate what you
[1:08:23] hate and love what you love Lord
[1:08:26] dinner I know you're going to give me
[1:08:28] all the things that I need I'm not even
[1:08:29] asking for that but oh God as Jesus said
[1:08:31] give us this day our daily bread so Lord
[1:08:34] give me all that I have need of
[1:08:37] yeah but I love you just have a
[1:08:39] communion with him
[1:08:42] let me tell you something if you want to
[1:08:43] grow with God you read your Bible and
[1:08:46] you pray every day
[1:08:49] I'm not up here to here to see some
[1:08:50] great swelling thing that's the most
[1:08:52] simple thing that you can do and the
[1:08:54] devil will keep you from it every time
[1:08:57] he'll get you so busy and if you can't
[1:08:59] get you busy he'll get you depressed
[1:09:00] he'll get you mad about something he'll
[1:09:02] get you anxious about something he'll do
[1:09:04] everything that he can to keep you away
[1:09:06] from God's word
[1:09:09] my
[1:09:11] there's a blessing and Brokenness you
[1:09:13] know that
[1:09:14] [Music]
[1:09:15] how would you know how God feels about
[1:09:17] Sin how would Hosea have known if his
[1:09:19] wife hadn't went off so many times and
[1:09:21] he had to go get her he was hurt he
[1:09:24] wanted to divorce Israel because of what
[1:09:25] they did but he said look at what I look
[1:09:27] at what I'm putting up with Hosea I'm
[1:09:29] sorry you've got to go through this but
[1:09:30] this is what I'm dealing with every day
[1:09:33] and his wife would sell herself into
[1:09:35] into sexual sin and he would have to go
[1:09:37] buy her back
[1:09:39] every time
[1:09:40] and that's how sometimes we have to go
[1:09:42] through things to know how would we ever
[1:09:44] know what sin well how God failed until
[1:09:47] we hell we had to to uh deal with
[1:09:50] heartache we've got to go through pain
[1:09:52] and struggles in life that's the same
[1:09:54] thing that God feels every time you and
[1:09:56] I fail every time we sin he said it in
[1:09:59] his word
[1:10:01] amen but there's a blessing in that that
[1:10:05] we can grow
[1:10:07] now I want to talk in just a minute
[1:10:09] about letting them in the spirits in and
[1:10:11] I said this before
[1:10:13] but now and I want to say this as a
[1:10:15] before I get started if you have a cat
[1:10:18] this ain't nothing against you
[1:10:23] I'm not saying you can't have cats
[1:10:27] I like cats
[1:10:29] I like them outside
[1:10:33] but they're all right they're fluffy and
[1:10:35] furry my son he loves catself he loves
[1:10:37] every cat he sees
[1:10:38] so don't get me wrong this is just an
[1:10:40] allegory
[1:10:42] it's a big word ain't it yeah
[1:10:44] this is an allegory I have said metaphor
[1:10:46] a minute ago it said allegory
[1:10:48] so one time we moved into this house and
[1:10:51] we
[1:10:52] We inherited a cat
[1:10:54] no fault of our own just like we're born
[1:10:56] in this life and in sin
[1:10:59] no fault of our own that's just the card
[1:11:01] were dealt right
[1:11:03] so this cat's name was Snowball
[1:11:05] should have been Fury or demon or
[1:11:07] something else but it was snowballed
[1:11:10] and the people that had the house before
[1:11:13] us
[1:11:14] let the cat in all the time
[1:11:16] and and there's one thing I found out
[1:11:18] about a cat and if you laughing you'll
[1:11:21] know I'm telling the truth if you ever
[1:11:22] let him in one time
[1:11:25] you won't never get him to stay out
[1:11:26] again
[1:11:28] that's the truth you ever let him in and
[1:11:30] pet him and got him on your lap he
[1:11:32] thinks he's entitled then he's got a
[1:11:33] right to come in he'll climb you scream
[1:11:35] he'll cry out the door he'll get up in
[1:11:37] the windowsill he'll do all kinds of
[1:11:39] things and you're like hey you ain't
[1:11:41] coming in because snowball will come in
[1:11:43] and he had a bad habit of scratching up
[1:11:45] the furniture didn't know how to use a
[1:11:47] litter box
[1:11:48] and see there's a there's a thing about
[1:11:49] having cats in your house that maybe you
[1:11:51] may not know it because when you smell
[1:11:53] it long enough you don't smell it
[1:11:55] anymore
[1:11:57] but everybody else that comes over can
[1:11:59] smell it
[1:12:02] amen I can walk into somebody's house
[1:12:04] it's usually a lady and um
[1:12:07] and I know she's got cats I don't have
[1:12:10] to see a hairball I don't have to see a
[1:12:12] toy a litter but I just knows it because
[1:12:14] I can smell it
[1:12:16] and that's like you and I
[1:12:18] if you let something in your life you
[1:12:21] might hide in a little while but let me
[1:12:23] tell you something people that's you
[1:12:25] know not that close to you like some
[1:12:27] kind of wrong about Steve right now he
[1:12:30] ain't acting the way he used to act
[1:12:32] see you start you don't even realize it
[1:12:34] but there's something going on in your
[1:12:36] life you start kind of emitting little
[1:12:38] vibes
[1:12:40] especially if you're spiritual you can
[1:12:41] pick up on things like that one you know
[1:12:43] I just don't understand there's
[1:12:44] something going on
[1:12:45] but the ones that you got to really
[1:12:48] worry about and then them I could pray
[1:12:50] for Brother Steve and say well Lord
[1:12:52] there's something going on but it's the
[1:12:53] ones that's gotten them cats and these
[1:12:55] are the ones that they get me because
[1:12:56] I've never seen this before growing up
[1:12:58] but people can have cats and you don't
[1:13:00] even know they got them they're clean no
[1:13:03] smell at all they vacuum no hair or
[1:13:05] nothing else and that's just wonderful
[1:13:07] but let me tell you something what if
[1:13:09] that's a demon in your life
[1:13:11] that's like that and you can hide it so
[1:13:13] well that nobody else ever knows it see
[1:13:15] there's a spirit that you let in now you
[1:13:19] might get fed up with
[1:13:20] um Garfield and you want to toss him out
[1:13:23] well he's gonna try to get back in every
[1:13:24] time that's just like a spirit if you
[1:13:26] cast that you maybe you come to church
[1:13:28] you hear the preaching of the Gospel
[1:13:29] that thing's been bothering you boom
[1:13:31] it's gone
[1:13:32] but Jesus said that when the devil is
[1:13:34] cast out of a man it walks in dry places
[1:13:36] that's right now dryness and wetness the
[1:13:39] only thing I can figure is that water
[1:13:41] represents Humanity seas and Waters so
[1:13:43] it didn't have anybody else to go into
[1:13:45] so he's just walking around but then he
[1:13:47] said now I find my house is is well
[1:13:50] swept where I just came from and he goes
[1:13:52] back in and brings more with him now
[1:13:54] there's something else about a cat if
[1:13:55] you ever have one you ain't never got
[1:13:57] one you're gonna end up with two three
[1:14:00] four five
[1:14:01] I've seen it at so many times yeah
[1:14:04] it happens every time you feed one
[1:14:06] you're gonna have 15 before you
[1:14:08] and then they're gonna be calling you
[1:14:10] the crazy cat lady in the neighborhood
[1:14:14] I I've lived through it so I know what
[1:14:17] I'm talking about
[1:14:18] I ain't up here just telling you stories
[1:14:22] I'm telling you history
[1:14:24] unfortunately
[1:14:28] and so that old cat he would run soon as
[1:14:30] we would open the door and see that's
[1:14:32] what you do you sometimes you are you
[1:14:34] ain't coming in but you might crack that
[1:14:36] door just a little bit
[1:14:39] I'm not going to look at that little
[1:14:41] website but then it'll pop up and you
[1:14:43] crack that door just a little bit
[1:14:45] oh you talk about fast
[1:14:48] they'll come in between your legs and
[1:14:49] they're gone just like that right there
[1:14:51] yeah and now you got to deal with how
[1:14:53] you gonna get him
[1:14:54] so it'll run under the bed and we had
[1:14:56] carpet and how you gonna get that cat
[1:14:58] he's under that bed he's like looking at
[1:15:00] You Got Claws you know
[1:15:03] and it's just like if you want to get
[1:15:05] rid of him now you might call somebody
[1:15:07] to come in and get I need this demon
[1:15:09] gone well now you've you've called the
[1:15:11] preacher you've called another brother
[1:15:12] to come now that thing's going to be
[1:15:14] it's going to be fighting like crazy to
[1:15:16] get out from under that bed especially
[1:15:17] if you rap about the tail you ain't
[1:15:19] never seen a fight
[1:15:20] it's going to dig its claws into that
[1:15:22] carpet it ain't going nowhere
[1:15:25] see
[1:15:27] is that okay yeah
[1:15:30] y'all just think about your own life for
[1:15:32] a minute now
[1:15:33] you think about the things that you've
[1:15:34] let into your life
[1:15:38] cigarettes chewing tobacco alcohol
[1:15:43] you know movies all kind of it's music
[1:15:45] oh let's not even talk about music or
[1:15:47] let me rephrase that what they call
[1:15:49] music This Day
[1:15:51] foreign
[1:15:52] beats it's all here's a Beat
[1:15:58] let me tell you something the devil uses
[1:15:59] that stuff
[1:16:00] if you don't think he uses music to get
[1:16:03] the young people
[1:16:06] you're naive
[1:16:08] yeah yeah
[1:16:11] so now you try to get the cat out and
[1:16:13] you've called somebody to come help you
[1:16:14] and they help you get it out
[1:16:16] I try to get rid of this thing Brothers
[1:16:17] I need you to pray for me and to help
[1:16:19] you get it out but here's what happens a
[1:16:21] lot of times you walk outside maybe

[1:16:25] don't even know what time I started
[1:16:26] brother I gotta I gotta try to finish
[1:16:27] this up

[1:19:25] and on top of that you're going to
[1:19:26] hinder the rest of us
[1:19:28] because let me tell you something I have
[1:19:29] purpose in my heart
[1:19:31] to not be here
[1:19:33] when that when the Lord comes I I want
[1:19:36] to go with him when that fire falls I
[1:19:39] want to go
[1:19:40] [Applause]
[1:19:43] y'all got quiet not be here at church I
[1:19:45] mean be here when
[1:19:48] my mind was thinking faster than my
[1:19:50] mouth could go
[1:19:52] that's a that's a common problem with me
[1:19:54] I stuttered
[1:19:56] oh my each shoe leather a lot of times
[1:20:00] anybody ever stuck your foot in your
[1:20:01] mouth
[1:20:03] speaking of that have your feet shot
[1:20:05] with the preparation of the gospel of
[1:20:06] peace
[1:20:09] I want it shod
[1:20:11] with the preparation
[1:20:13] I want peace to come out of my mouth not
[1:20:16] fighting not not fussing and carrying on
[1:20:19] and worrying about Democrat and
[1:20:21] Republican who cares
[1:20:24] let me tell you something they so
[1:20:26] worried about the red and the blue
[1:20:28] States it's like the crew members of the
[1:20:30] Titanic rearranging the deck chairs
[1:20:33] well they need to go over here no they
[1:20:34] need to go over what there is all going
[1:20:36] down
[1:20:37] [Applause]
[1:20:38] man
[1:20:42] hey man
[1:20:45] above all taking the shield of Faith
[1:20:47] wherewith Yar you shall be able to
[1:20:50] quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
[1:20:52] now I read that back then you know we
[1:20:54] see in the in the pictures they had
[1:20:55] Shields of of iron but a lot of times
[1:20:58] it's wooden Shields and they would coat
[1:20:59] them with leather and they would soak
[1:21:01] them in water and that was to when they
[1:21:04] shot those fiery arrows at them it would
[1:21:06] quench those arrows you ever heard that
[1:21:07] amen
[1:21:09] take the helmet of salvation and the
[1:21:11] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[1:21:15] God
[1:21:16] now I want to tell you something else
[1:21:18] I've I've was reading about David
[1:21:20] y'all might have heard of him David and
[1:21:22] Goliath and so but you know we all face
[1:21:25] Giants in our life don't we that was a
[1:21:28] classic that was a Warfare battle they
[1:21:31] started trash talking each other I'll
[1:21:32] feed your your the buzzer's gonna eat
[1:21:34] you and this that I'll you know whatever
[1:21:36] and so it was just a good old-fashioned
[1:21:38] you know Throwdown and so what did what
[1:21:42] did David do he picked out that stone
[1:21:45] any any Lodge and let me tell you
[1:21:47] something a little hundred pound 110
[1:21:48] pound guy sling I don't care how fast he
[1:21:50] could have slung that rock would not
[1:21:52] have killed Goliath it would have he
[1:21:55] would have bounced off of him you're
[1:21:56] talking about a 10 foot 11 foot 12 foot
[1:21:58] guy yeah that's not gonna do anything
[1:22:00] but let me tell you something that
[1:22:02] happens and that's in your life also
[1:22:04] when you come up against something that
[1:22:06] you just can't get over you come against
[1:22:09] a mountain or a giant in your life that
[1:22:11] that you just can't get past it you
[1:22:14] can't defeat it
[1:22:16] when that thing comes in your life and
[1:22:18] try this the next time
[1:22:20] but when that thing comes up and that
[1:22:22] Temptation comes
[1:22:24] you just say oh God just like David
[1:22:26] picked up that stone and a stone is a
[1:22:29] sign of judgment it's also a symbol of
[1:22:32] Memorial
[1:22:33] so God I I'm not strong enough to fight
[1:22:36] this battle okay first off David said
[1:22:38] the battle is not mine but Lord I give
[1:22:40] it to you God it's your battle but when
[1:22:43] that thing comes up in your life you put
[1:22:45] that stone of faith of judgment and of a
[1:22:48] memorial of what God has done for you
[1:22:50] you think about that stone that they
[1:22:52] laid in front of the Tomb
[1:22:55] that they sealed they thought they had
[1:22:56] him Satan thought he had him let me tell
[1:22:59] you something on Sunday morning the
[1:23:00] angel rolled that stone away
[1:23:02] Lord I take that stone Satan thought he
[1:23:05] had you but you're the Risen Savior this
[1:23:08] morning I don't have any strength in my
[1:23:10] life I don't have any strength of my own
[1:23:12] because the weapon is not of warfare is
[1:23:15] not carnal
[1:23:17] amen so God I can't fight it just on my
[1:23:19] own I can't read self-help books I can't
[1:23:21] read this book or that book
[1:23:23] God I need you to fight this battle for
[1:23:26] me
[1:23:27] amen let me tell you something
[1:23:30] when David took up that that rock and he
[1:23:32] gave the battle to God
[1:23:34] when that stone left that sling I could
[1:23:37] imagine that it sounded like a 30-06
[1:23:39] breaking the sound barrier when it went
[1:23:41] there and it hit that giant and knocked
[1:23:42] him right on his back and he cut his
[1:23:44] head off
[1:23:47] and that's the same thing that'll happen
[1:23:48] to you because you don't have any
[1:23:50] strength of your own
[1:23:52] but our Lord is a strong tower
[1:23:55] and the righteous run into it then
[1:23:58] they're safe amen
[1:24:01] mm-hmm
[1:24:04] now Ephesians 5 15 tells us that we were
[1:24:08] to walk circumspectly
[1:24:10] how many of you knows what circumspectly
[1:24:12] means
[1:24:14] I had to look it up
[1:24:16] I've always you know nobody knows what
[1:24:19] circumspectly means
[1:24:22] that's a military terminology
[1:24:25] they'll tell you when you're walking on
[1:24:27] patrol Keep Your Head on a swivel
[1:24:29] that's what it means Look up the word
[1:24:31] circuit means taking account of
[1:24:33] everything that is around you above you
[1:24:34] down below you
[1:24:36] being ready at any time for the devil to
[1:24:39] come so you walk with your head on a
[1:24:41] swivel you're looking this way you're
[1:24:42] looking that way
[1:24:44] amen
[1:24:47] we don't need to get caught off guard
[1:24:49] oh my I think I've already covered that
[1:24:52] pretty good
[1:24:53] now
[1:24:54] actually let's go ahead and go to Acts 2
[1:24:56] 36.
[1:24:58] we usually read 238 but I just want to
[1:25:01] stop at 236 for just a moment
[1:25:04] is this okay this morning about five ten
[1:25:07] more minutes
[1:25:14] Acts 2 36 and this is after Peter the
[1:25:18] day of Pentecost
[1:25:19] and he's preaching to these people I
[1:25:21] mean he's letting it go
[1:25:24] and this is what he says he says
[1:25:26] therefore let all the house of Israel
[1:25:28] know assuredly that God hath made that
[1:25:31] same Jesus whom you have crucified both
[1:25:34] Lord and Christ now here's the one I
[1:25:36] want you to get
[1:25:37] now when they heard this they were
[1:25:39] pricked in their heart
[1:25:41] sit down to Peter into the rest of the
[1:25:43] Apostles men and Brethren what shall we
[1:25:45] do now hold that place
[1:25:47] and turn to Ezekiel
[1:25:49] 11 19.
[1:25:51] can you do that real fast
[1:25:54] I'll turn with you
[1:25:57] I hear some pages turning
[1:25:59] if the brother can get it up there
[1:26:01] Ezekiel he could probably do it faster
[1:26:02] than I can Ezekiel 11 19 some of you may
[1:26:05] already know where I'm going
[1:26:16] and I will give them one heart
[1:26:18] and I will put a new spirit within you
[1:26:20] and I will take the Stony heart out of
[1:26:22] their flesh and will give them and heart
[1:26:25] of Flesh
[1:26:26] so they had a Stony heart
[1:26:28] all right all of us have Stony hearts
[1:26:31] until God comes in
[1:26:34] and perform surgery on us
[1:26:36] [Applause]
[1:26:37] now here's the thing that I want you to
[1:26:39] see
[1:26:40] hold that all right you know go back to
[1:26:42] acts now I want you to go over to acts
[1:26:43] 7. it's just two pages over if you have
[1:26:46] a Scofield
[1:26:49] act seven
[1:26:52] and what is that 50
[1:26:56] 54.
[1:26:57] and and Stephen is preaching a holy
[1:27:00] ghost sermon right here
[1:27:02] he was preaching and just kind of he was
[1:27:04] kind of extolling them and telling them
[1:27:06] about the things about Egypt and and and
[1:27:08] and and Moses and Abraham but then
[1:27:12] something happens and the Holy Ghost
[1:27:14] takes over it I've read this scripture
[1:27:16] so many times you know exactly when the
[1:27:18] Holy Ghost takes over and Stephen stops
[1:27:21] talking
[1:27:23] that's right here in for in 48
[1:27:26] I'm sorry 51. yeast stiff-necked and
[1:27:29] uncircumcised in heart and ears you do
[1:27:31] always resist the Holy Ghost as your
[1:27:33] fathers did so do you which of the which
[1:27:35] of the prophets have not your fathers
[1:27:37] persecuted and they have slain them
[1:27:39] which showed before of the coming of the
[1:27:41] just one of whom you have now I have
[1:27:44] been now the betrayers and murderers who
[1:27:46] have received the law by the disposition
[1:27:48] of angels and have not kept when they
[1:27:51] heard these things
[1:27:53] they were cut to their heart and they
[1:27:55] gnashed on them with their teeth
[1:27:58] see there was a difference when Peter
[1:28:00] preached to that 3000
[1:28:03] because they they were genuine believers
[1:28:07] they said what must we do to be saved it
[1:28:10] was a different circumstance for these
[1:28:11] Pharisees they didn't all they were just
[1:28:13] trying to find a way to accuse Stephen
[1:28:14] and to kill him
[1:28:16] see they still had those Stony hearts
[1:28:18] but the other ones were open they had
[1:28:21] their hearts they had a heart of Flesh
[1:28:23] God had already started dealing with
[1:28:24] them see he starts on both ends he
[1:28:26] starts working over here then he had
[1:28:28] Peter stand up full of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:30] preaching and the Bible says now I'm
[1:28:32] going to use a allegory he took that
[1:28:34] sword of the spirit
[1:28:36] and what is that the word and he's and
[1:28:38] he stuck it right to their hearts now
[1:28:40] what that did when they were print to
[1:28:41] their heart they cut away all the all
[1:28:44] the old uh ideas and all the old
[1:28:47] denominationalism it cut away all the
[1:28:49] fleshism and all the traditions and it
[1:28:51] went straight to the heart and it
[1:28:52] bricked it and they were oh God we
[1:28:54] receive it and three thousand men were
[1:28:57] added to the church in one day
[1:29:00] but there's something different that
[1:29:01] happened when Stephen was preaching it
[1:29:03] because the Bible says they were cut to
[1:29:05] their heart and after it cut through the
[1:29:08] traditions and cut through everything
[1:29:09] and it cut through all their ideas and
[1:29:12] their man-made Creeds there was nothing
[1:29:15] else there
[1:29:16] but a Stony heart
[1:29:19] and that was revealed to them they knew
[1:29:22] he was telling the truth
[1:29:24] it reminds me of that young girl that
[1:29:26] that rejected everything that brother
[1:29:28] Brown tried to get her to do he tried to
[1:29:30] get her to stop going to the dances try
[1:29:32] to get her to quit running around these
[1:29:33] boys and she said oh she went down to
[1:29:35] another church and he said it was okay
[1:29:37] let me tell you something anything you
[1:29:38] want to do in life you can find somebody
[1:29:40] they'll tell you it's okay to do it
[1:29:42] she kept going down to that little old
[1:29:44] church and before you know it she got a
[1:29:46] venereal disease for running around and
[1:29:48] sleeping around and ended up dying in
[1:29:51] the hospital
[1:29:52] and what happens when the devil's got
[1:29:55] you and he knows he's got you she was
[1:29:58] dying and that demon said I've done my
[1:30:00] job I don't have to stick around so that
[1:30:02] all that anointing that she had and it
[1:30:05] just pulled off of her and then she knew
[1:30:07] her eyes were open and she's told that
[1:30:09] preacher she said you deceiver
[1:30:12] you deceived me
[1:30:15] because there was nothing in her heart
[1:30:18] everything had been cut away it'd been
[1:30:20] Stripped Away and there was nothing left
[1:30:22] now but judgment for her and she
[1:30:24] realized it and these men did the same
[1:30:27] thing when Stephen preached they
[1:30:28] realized they had nothing
[1:30:30] all that was there when the word came
[1:30:33] and cut away all the Traditions there
[1:30:35] was nothing there but Blackness and a
[1:30:38] Stony heart
[1:30:39] God this morning don't let me be that
[1:30:42] way
[1:30:43] oh God let me have if I've got if I've
[1:30:46] got anger
[1:30:47] if I've got a little unforgiveness in my
[1:30:49] heart and somebody if I've got anything
[1:30:51] Lord take it out of me
[1:30:53] oh God give me a heart of Flesh this
[1:30:55] morning one that you can mold
[1:30:59] one that you can prick me this morning
[1:31:01] Lord with your word
[1:31:03] oh God
[1:31:05] thank you Lord
[1:31:07] any good to us
[1:31:10] now I want to talk to you just a minute
[1:31:12] just a few more minutes I was talking
[1:31:13] about how Germany invaded in Russia
[1:31:17] and they had a diabolical plan when they
[1:31:20] uh surrounded the town of Leningrad
[1:31:22] which is now Saint Petersburg
[1:31:24] millions of people were in the city and
[1:31:26] they didn't want to expand the
[1:31:27] ammunition and the and the supplies it
[1:31:29] would take to go in and take the city
[1:31:31] and the Manpower so they were just going
[1:31:32] to just build a little hedge about
[1:31:34] around it and wall the entire city in
[1:31:37] it's called laying Siege to a city and
[1:31:40] they laid Siege to the city of Leningrad
[1:31:44] and and they starved them and they
[1:31:46] wouldn't let any supplies in
[1:31:48] and I wondered this morning if the
[1:31:50] devil's laid Siege into your life
[1:31:53] but sometimes those little things in our
[1:31:55] heart those little pockets of resistance
[1:31:57] can break out
[1:31:59] and might even take control of your life
[1:32:01] the next thing you know you don't even
[1:32:03] feel like going to church you don't feel
[1:32:04] like reading the Bible you don't feel
[1:32:06] like fellowshipping when your brothers
[1:32:07] and sisters now you're seized off
[1:32:09] Satan's got you hemmed around he's got
[1:32:12] you cut off
[1:32:14] oh my
[1:32:16] so Germany did this to the Russian
[1:32:18] people and they were dying they had
[1:32:19] wonderful beautiful works of art they
[1:32:21] were selling for just a handful of flour
[1:32:23] to eat they were chopping up their their
[1:32:26] beautiful pianos and things and and just
[1:32:29] use it for firewood just to stay alive
[1:32:31] and when it seemed like it was the worst
[1:32:34] time ever
[1:32:36] they were right to the back of the city
[1:32:37] was the Baltic Sea and it was got so
[1:32:40] cold that winter it was one of the
[1:32:41] coldest winters and that was that winner
[1:32:44] is what actually defeated Germany
[1:32:46] because the ground froze and then the
[1:32:48] Russian Vehicles could come across but
[1:32:51] also something that happened was the
[1:32:53] very thing that that held them and kept
[1:32:55] them from escaping
[1:32:56] the very thing that had been bound was
[1:32:58] the Baltic seed but something happened
[1:33:00] in the middle of winter it froze over
[1:33:02] yeah and they started bringing in trucks
[1:33:05] of Wheat and trucks of of bread and food
[1:33:08] and and they it was a lifeline and to
[1:33:10] the people of Leningrad and it saved the
[1:33:13] city it saved the people until they
[1:33:15] could come in and switch the enemy away
[1:33:17] and this morning maybe you've got to the
[1:33:19] lowest point that you can get to I think
[1:33:22] about the Hebrew children when they went
[1:33:23] into the fire
[1:33:25] and I know they're having a play about
[1:33:26] this up at the camp but I just always
[1:33:28] think about this this scenario when they
[1:33:31] walk into the fire and it's like the
[1:33:33] darkest time of their life have you
[1:33:35] prayed up yes I've prayed up are you
[1:33:37] going to buy we're not going to Bow
[1:33:38] God's able to deliver us but even if he
[1:33:40] don't we're not going to bow
[1:33:42] and when they got into the middle of the
[1:33:44] fire old brothers and sisters remember
[1:33:46] this the only thing that burned on them
[1:33:49] the only thing that burned not even a
[1:33:51] smell of smoke on them the only thing
[1:33:54] that burned on him was the roof that had
[1:33:55] him bound
[1:33:57] maybe God's taking you through the fire
[1:33:59] this morning maybe he's taking you
[1:34:01] through a trial or a battle to loosen
[1:34:03] the very thing that's had you bound you
[1:34:05] don't even realize why
[1:34:07] oh God I pray this morning that's the
[1:34:10] case
[1:34:11] that he'll loosen those things on you he
[1:34:13] might take that fiery trial to let you
[1:34:16] realize where you're at with him
[1:34:19] maybe you need a closer walk maybe you
[1:34:21] need to pray more maybe you need to be
[1:34:22] more sincere maybe it's the thing that's
[1:34:24] held you Bound for so long
[1:34:26] God's able to deliver you this morning
[1:34:30] you believe it
[1:34:35] oh my
[1:34:40] um
[1:34:41] you're loving this morning
[1:34:44] I got one more story I want to tell
[1:34:48] and this this always
[1:34:51] as far as fighting a battle sometimes it
[1:34:53] didn't always
[1:34:55] a fight
[1:34:57] you know the best way to fight a battle
[1:34:58] with the Lord
[1:35:00] it's surrender
[1:35:04] the international sign of Victory is
[1:35:07] what is it
[1:35:09] the international sound surrender is
[1:35:11] what
[1:35:12] is both the same
[1:35:14] I Surrender now I have victory
[1:35:17] I surrender all the Lord now I have
[1:35:19] victory
[1:35:22] but there was a picture I saw one time
[1:35:24] many of you might have seen it
[1:35:25] and uh it's always stuck with me and
[1:35:28] I've never forgot I read the fox's book
[1:35:29] of Martyrs and and those stories just
[1:35:32] rip your heart out and I was looking at
[1:35:36] this painting and it was if you can in
[1:35:38] your mind's eye just imagine this it was
[1:35:40] a
[1:35:41] uh Scene It was the Roman Roman Coliseum
[1:35:45] and they had
[1:35:48] you can see the sky this it was kind of
[1:35:51] the sun was going down it was almost
[1:35:52] dark because right at dusk but the
[1:35:55] beautiful painting the kind of like
[1:35:56] those clouds there you can see but it
[1:35:58] was getting dark and inside the the
[1:36:00] Coliseum was really dark except for
[1:36:01] lights like the Torches rolling around
[1:36:03] and then you start looking at the
[1:36:05] Torches and you realize
[1:36:07] those are people
[1:36:09] and they were hung on the cross
[1:36:11] and they say that they should take the
[1:36:13] women the the Christian sisters because
[1:36:15] they wouldn't Bob their hair off and
[1:36:16] things like that and they would take
[1:36:18] them they would dip their dip their
[1:36:20] heads down in the pitch and tar
[1:36:22] and they would light them on fire
[1:36:24] and that's what they used to light
[1:36:27] the Coliseum with
[1:36:29] and in the middle of the Coliseum was a
[1:36:31] group of Christians sitting there
[1:36:34] and they were
[1:36:35] they were all in their hands and knees
[1:36:37] probably maybe 20 or 30. and there was
[1:36:41] one old man standing up with his hands
[1:36:42] lifted up to heaven they all were
[1:36:44] praying he had his hands up to God
[1:36:47] and you can look over here on this side
[1:36:49] of the painting and there was lions
[1:36:51] they were getting ready and they just
[1:36:53] opened the gate and the lines were
[1:36:54] coming out
[1:36:55] and I've often looked at that picture
[1:36:57] and it's it's just it impacted me so
[1:37:00] much
[1:37:01] because I think about oh God you know
[1:37:02] where were you and all that
[1:37:05] where were you but I know that God took
[1:37:07] those people that sacrifice
[1:37:10] and they gave everything that they had
[1:37:11] they would not bow they would not relent
[1:37:14] they would not recant to the church or
[1:37:17] the paganism at the time
[1:37:19] but they stood fast and stood strong
[1:37:23] and even though their blood was spilled
[1:37:25] on that ground it made it sacred
[1:37:27] that grounded this day to me is still
[1:37:29] sacred it's Hallowed Ground where those
[1:37:31] Martyrs died
[1:37:33] oh my and I think about my own life and
[1:37:36] I think about my trials and my old card
[1:37:38] am I any better than them
[1:37:40] when I I'm in the midst of a trial or
[1:37:42] battle and I'm like oh God am I I mean
[1:37:46] am I any better than what they went
[1:37:48] through
[1:37:49] God forgive me help me Lord help me to
[1:37:53] be stronger help me to trust in you help
[1:37:56] me to not give up not let up but let me
[1:37:59] stay up pray up and then God you take me
[1:38:02] up
[1:38:04] I want to go up amen where the musicians
[1:38:06] come up here brother Tony whoever's
[1:38:08] coming
[1:38:11] do you love him this morning
[1:38:16] I just
[1:38:18] sometimes I feel so ashamed of myself
[1:38:22] I feel like oh what was me
[1:38:25] I guess I'm the only one in here
[1:38:30] woe is me
[1:38:33] but I know one thing he's faithful
[1:38:36] and he's true
[1:38:38] and he'll deliver you yeah
[1:38:43] maybe it's God's will that
[1:38:45] whatever trial you're going through is
[1:38:47] to be a blessing to somebody else
[1:38:49] but he'll make this trial a blessing and
[1:38:51] let me tell you something too let me
[1:38:53] tell you something too there's a song
[1:38:55] even the valley is higher ground
[1:38:57] and that's so true when you go up in the
[1:38:59] mountains we go we used to live in
[1:39:00] Virginia you go up Fancy Gap mountain
[1:39:02] and you're at 3 000 feet that's the
[1:39:04] valley for the rest of the mountains the
[1:39:05] rest of them are six and seven thousand
[1:39:07] feet up in there but once you're in the
[1:39:09] valley you're still 3 000 feet above
[1:39:11] down here
[1:39:12] and that's the life of a that's the
[1:39:14] Christian Life you may not always be on
[1:39:16] the Mountaintop
[1:39:17] there's an old song that says nothing
[1:39:19] grows high on top of the mountain you
[1:39:20] can't stay up there all the time
[1:39:22] and the mountaintops are really small
[1:39:24] areas
[1:39:25] you know it's not up there where you
[1:39:28] grow you go up there to worship and the
[1:39:30] praise and the the blessings of God are
[1:39:33] just moving in your life and you're just
[1:39:34] like man I'm on top of the world and the
[1:39:37] next thing you know wow the road just
[1:39:39] got pulled out from under your feet
[1:39:41] that's happened to me time and time and
[1:39:44] time again
[1:39:45] but you know what it's down in that
[1:39:46] Valley
[1:39:47] through the trials and temptations
[1:39:49] that's where your soul is restored
[1:39:53] oh we can't understand well Lord I'm in
[1:39:55] a valley well I led you here
[1:39:57] Psalms 23 he leadeth me beside the Still
[1:39:59] Waters the Lord leads you down that way
[1:40:02] sometimes
[1:40:04] well you can't always stay up there on
[1:40:05] the high amount
[1:40:06] and you ain't really going nowhere
[1:40:08] you're just there
[1:40:10] you can't really feed your sheep up
[1:40:12] there can you they got to come back down
[1:40:14] with the pastures of Green Meadows
[1:40:17] sometimes you don't want to be there but
[1:40:19] that's where you need to be
[1:40:21] and I thank the Lord for the the
[1:40:23] mountaintops
