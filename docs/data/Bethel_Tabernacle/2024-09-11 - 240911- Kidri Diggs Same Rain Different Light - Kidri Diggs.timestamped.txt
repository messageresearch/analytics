[35:57] father Father which is in heaven for he
[36:00] maketh his son to rise upon the evil and
[36:03] on the good and sendeth reigned on the
[36:07] just and
[36:09] unjust amen let's go to uh Isaiah
[36:13] chapter
[36:16] 10 familiar verse of
[36:25] scriptures Isaiah 10 and and
[36:31] 27 Isaiah 10 and 27 the Bible
[36:35] says and it shall come to pass in that
[36:38] day that his burden shall be taken away
[36:41] from off thy shoulder and his yoke from
[36:44] off thy neck and the Yoke shall be
[36:47] destroyed because of the anointing amen
[36:50] may the Lord bless reading of his word
[36:51] you can have your
[36:54] seats amen
[37:06] by the grace of God tonight I want to
[37:08] use for a subject same rain different
[37:12] light same rain different light you know
[37:17] and and and I'm G kind of start uh on my
[37:22] end
[37:23] backwards you know but I hope you can
[37:25] follow along uh um same
[37:29] rain different light now we know the
[37:32] Bible always speaks in in in Shadows and
[37:35] in
[37:36] types and if I say rain you know we're
[37:40] not really talking about rain as in
[37:43] leadership or or as in Lord I'm talking
[37:47] about r n rain like a
[37:51] falling a a a dripping a soaking a
[37:55] thunder but I'm not talking about the
[37:58] rain as far as being wet but I'm talking
[38:02] about the rain of the anointing
[38:05] Hallelujah you know and the anointing
[38:07] has been relevant and and and and around
[38:10] for forever amen you know at the
[38:13] earliest times where God called man the
[38:17] anointing was
[38:18] there but one thing I've I've I've come
[38:21] to look at and notice and you know uh uh
[38:24] your your pastor by the grace of God he
[38:27] he Pro he preached a message at the at
[38:30] the men's meeting lifting lifted lifting
[38:33] him up how how how was it Go lifted up
[38:36] From the Ashes amen you know and it was
[38:39] just so many things he said in that you
[38:41] know it just it it tuck me to a place to
[38:45] where I begin to ask myself am I growing
[38:48] in
[38:49] Christ you know and all together church
[38:52] we ought to be asking ourself are we
[38:54] growing in Christ now let's just start
[38:57] with the anointing Hallelujah when the
[39:00] anointing when the rain comes Hallelujah
[39:03] the Bible said at just the smell of it
[39:07] at the smell of it at the smell of water
[39:10] something begins to connect with that
[39:12] seed and life begins to come forth now
[39:15] if I ask the question how do you respond
[39:18] in church when the rain
[39:20] falls how do you respond when the
[39:23] anointing comes in the midst of bethl
[39:26] Hallelujah now it's the same rain
[39:29] Hallelujah that's that's that's falling
[39:31] in denominations
[39:33] hallelujah amen they seeing some of the
[39:35] same songs they're inspired by some of
[39:38] the same music but the question is when
[39:41] the rain comes it's something being
[39:44] unlocked in your
[39:46] life because clearly in job the Bible
[39:49] says that that this tree can be cut down
[39:51] and when the root Hallelujah comes in
[39:54] contact with the smell of water
[39:56] something begins to be unlocked and It
[39:59] prepares itself to grow again Hallelujah
[40:03] even though it went to a season where
[40:06] something cut it down it went to a
[40:08] season where something was dry just the
[40:10] smell of water Hallelujah just just the
[40:14] presence of that anointing that rain
[40:17] unlock something in that tree to say I
[40:20] want to give
[40:21] more hallelujah hallelujah and and one
[40:27] of the the reasons why I believe we go
[40:30] I'm going this way because uh in my
[40:32] travels I look around and I go places
[40:35] and people don't even respond when the
[40:38] anointing is
[40:47] falling we've gotten so used to uh good
[40:50] songs and a good song service you know
[40:53] and the presence of God comes down the
[40:56] rain comes down
[40:57] Hallelujah to drive demons away the rain
[41:01] comes down to give us strength the rain
[41:04] comes down in the power of his
[41:06] resurrection and we don't even respond
[41:09] to
[41:10] it but the rain comes so it can unlock
[41:15] something in the seed Hallelujah but not
[41:18] only unlock it comes and it falls so
[41:21] that you don't remain in the same
[41:25] condition that's the purpose of the
[41:27] anointing the anointing comes to break
[41:31] yolks the anointing comes to destroy the
[41:34] whole that the enemy has on you amen
[41:38] these songs these atmospheres that we
[41:40] are experiencing not for us to walk out
[41:42] the same way we came in but it's
[41:45] supposed to ignite something in our
[41:48] lives something Hallelujah is is
[41:52] supposed to respond when the rain comes
[41:55] hallah we us to sing a song open the
[41:59] floodgates of
[42:01] Heaven Let It
[42:04] Rain think about that Hallelujah if the
[42:07] rain is coming from the heavens
[42:11] hallelujah amen and we don't acknowledge
[42:14] it that means we're not even
[42:17] understanding his presence Hallelujah am
[42:21] oh my but look the reason why I said
[42:25] sing rain different light Hallelujah
[42:29] because we all have seen maybe churches
[42:32] online or whatever uh uh let me take the
[42:35] group um that everybody's listening to
[42:38] right now uh Maverick
[42:43] City I keep going I get you
[42:46] now but you take some of the songs they
[42:49] sing like promises and and all the rest
[42:54] of them you know what I'm talking
[42:55] about some of the these same songs that
[42:58] we listen to Under the inspiration of
[43:01] the rain Hallelujah see it's the same
[43:05] rain they feel the presence of God just
[43:08] like we do Hallelujah but the difference
[43:11] is the light Hallelujah see there's two
[43:15] things that's going on Hallelujah even
[43:17] in the service church one the rain which
[43:20] is the anointing and the other is the
[43:23] light Hallelujah the light is what the
[43:26] word Hallelujah people have experienced
[43:29] the anointing but there's a different
[43:31] light that we walk in
[43:34] Hallelujah if I can by the grace of God
[43:37] I want to read to you what the what the
[43:38] prophet of God said see what we ought to
[43:41] do is uhh not uh if I could say it like
[43:46] this let worship and things get so
[43:49] common to us on because when it gets
[43:53] common then it starts to lose its fire
[43:57] right when it gets caling Hallelujah
[44:00] then it starts to lose the effect of it
[44:04] Hallelujah and normally when things get
[44:06] common to us hallelujah we just ignore
[44:09] it when it gets common to us I never
[44:12] want the rain presence anointing of God
[44:15] to get common to me cuz it's those times
[44:19] Hallelujah when you least expected when
[44:22] God is in the
[44:24] room church for a moment Hallelujah ask
[44:27] yourself are you conscious of God are we
[44:31] conscious when we worship that you're
[44:33] not worshiping brother
[44:34] Tony Hallelujah these songs we sing We
[44:37] Sing unto almighty God hallelujah these
[44:41] brothers that are playing the
[44:42] instruments and sisters that are playing
[44:43] the instruments is not unto their own
[44:46] doing but it's for one reason Hallelujah
[44:49] and is to exalt the
[44:51] [Applause]
[44:53] king but when the rain falls how do we
[44:57] respond to the Rain listen the prophet
[45:00] of God say he says now we can do many
[45:03] things we can take communion Hallelujah
[45:07] we can be baptized we can come to church
[45:10] have our names on the book or just be or
[45:14] or be just as respect and reverent as we
[45:18] can be and still be
[45:22] Lov oh my think about that you can sit
[45:26] in the presence a god
[45:28] reverent you can be baptized pay your
[45:30] tithes do all these things and still be
[45:34] lost amen amen he said that's a solemn
[45:40] he said that's a solemn warning we could
[45:42] be
[45:43] just as just rejoice when the spirit
[45:47] would fall and in a meeting when the
[45:50] word was being preached and our souls
[45:53] would just Rejoice with the word and
[45:56] still be lost
[45:57] listen what he says the rain falls on
[46:00] the just and
[46:02] unjust now if I can stop right there
[46:04] Hallelujah the anointing the Bible
[46:06] brother DS ain't making us up the Bible
[46:09] the the Bible says that the rain the
[46:11] anointing is in the message and is in
[46:14] denominations all right
[46:18] that's hallelujah hallelujah or should I
[46:22] say it like this the rain when it falls
[46:24] in our midst Hallelujah people people
[46:27] with the Holy Ghost are blessed and
[46:28] people without the Holy Ghost are
[46:30] blessed Hallelujah and brother Jason I
[46:33] think that's what the problem is we walk
[46:35] out experiencing the rain and we walk
[46:37] out saying I'm all right no we must come
[46:39] into a
[46:40] birth H we must come into an experience
[46:43] with God where when God comes we
[46:46] acknowledge his
[46:50] presence all of creation acknowledges
[46:53] the sun when it rises
[46:57] not by choice they don't have a
[47:01] choice cuz nothing's going to stop the
[47:03] Sun from
[47:04] rising well listen he said the rain
[47:07] falls on the just and the unjust the
[47:09] same rain that makes the wheat grow
[47:12] makes weeds grow hallelujah amen but if
[47:15] I could say it like this my inspiration
[47:18] is tonight church is are you growing
[47:21] amen hallelujah amen we experience good
[47:24] Services good word good atmospheres but
[47:27] are you growing cuz the only reason why
[47:30] Hallelujah rain connects with the seed
[47:33] is to unlock the life that life may come
[47:36] forth now there's two things that a seed
[47:39] must have it must have Water and Light
[47:42] you're already
[47:48] dirt hallelujah hallelujah we already
[47:53] five and six feet of dirt so there's two
[47:56] things that we need need in our journey
[47:58] one is water we need a holy a holy ghost
[48:02] filled
[48:04] atmosphere H we need to come in contact
[48:07] with the anointing of God the rain of
[48:10] God H cuz it's by that rain that you
[48:13] grow it's by that rain that it unlock
[48:16] something in your life Hallelujah to
[48:19] give back to God what he put inside of
[48:21] you Hallelujah you see how important it
[48:24] is to respond when the rain is falling
[48:28] Hallelujah that seed is no good if it
[48:31] doesn't come in contact with
[48:34] rain amen
[48:37] hallelujah it can't grow without water
[48:40] am it can't produce without water we
[48:43] need the anointing but don't take it for
[48:48] granted no I ain't going to be long I'm
[48:52] about to
[48:53] close but church if we look and we
[48:55] examine think about how many powerful
[48:59] worship Services we've
[49:01] had and we walk out with the same
[49:04] struggles we walk out with the same
[49:06] problems the same questions the
[49:09] anointing came to do something in your
[49:11] life hallelujah amen and I love how the
[49:16] Pastor said it's it's it's lifting us up
[49:18] hallelujah amen it's not by choice but
[49:21] when we get in the presence of God this
[49:23] is the thing I want you to understand in
[49:26] that atmosphere fear when the rain
[49:28] Hallelujah is falling either you're
[49:30] yielding or
[49:36] resisting some people don't like
[49:40] rain cuz they don't want to be touched
[49:44] Hallelujah but sometimes the rain
[49:46] Hallelujah it'll identify what kind of
[49:49] material you
[49:53] are now I got certain shoes that I wear
[49:56] I don't like to wear in the rain because
[49:59] the what the rain will do the rain will
[50:01] War the the material or or mess it up so
[50:04] I don't wear that kind of stuff in the
[50:06] rain but then there are some things in
[50:08] the rain that are waterproof Hallelujah
[50:11] and you know what church there are too
[50:13] many Christians Hallelujah that are
[50:17] waterproof Hallelujah there too many
[50:20] Christians that can be in the presence
[50:22] of God and not be
[50:25] touched that to me people that can
[50:27] experience the rain and not be affected
[50:30] H I don't know about you guys but when
[50:32] I'm in a storm and I run from my car
[50:34] Hallelujah when I run from my car to the
[50:36] house I get wet I get affected by the
[50:39] storm Hallelujah sometimes I have to go
[50:41] and change clothes sometimes I have to
[50:43] go wash wipe my head Hallelujah but I
[50:46] get touched by the rain
[50:48] Hallelujah ask yourself we was the last
[50:51] time you were touched by the rain no I'm
[50:54] not trying to make you jump and Shout
[50:56] I'm asking you are you
[50:59] growing
[51:01] that's cuz the rain comes to unlock that
[51:04] seed even though it's been cut
[51:12] down even though it's been cut down when
[51:15] the rain
[51:17] falls something is supposed to be
[51:20] unlocked now you ask yourself am I in
[51:23] the same spot I was in last year that
[51:25] means you're not growing even though
[51:27] you're experiencing the same
[51:31] rain same rain yeah same rain same song
[51:34] leader same musicians some of the same
[51:38] songs same church same atmosphere and
[51:41] you are still in the same place
[51:44] spiritually something's wrong with that
[51:46] picture Hallelujah either Hallelujah
[51:50] you're not hallah being Reverend to the
[51:53] anointing H or you're ignoring it wow
[51:57] amen that's the thing about being a free
[52:00] more agent
[52:03] Hallelujah listen you say well brother
[52:05] DS what do you mean look hallu there are
[52:08] people hallelujah in this church that
[52:10] used to do specials I haven't heard do a
[52:12] special in
[52:15] years does that mean you're growing or
[52:18] you're dodging the
[52:22] rain think about it Hallelujah when the
[52:25] anointing fall because it's supposed to
[52:28] bring more out of you hallelujah how
[52:33] often we leave a good service and we
[52:36] knew God was in there we knew God talked
[52:39] to us and we walk out with the same
[52:45] attitude church now I I'm preaching to
[52:48] myself
[52:50] also because I feel like all of us who
[52:53] are still here that means we have
[52:56] haven't obtained yet that means there's
[52:59] still room for growth Hallelujah there's
[53:01] still more that God wants to unlock out
[53:04] of your life Hallelujah I've seen
[53:06] Hallelujah young people pray and pray
[53:08] for a spouse and then they get the
[53:10] spouse and they
[53:17] disappear anointed
[53:19] too anointed
[53:23] lies same
[53:25] rain different
[53:28] light so we can see that the rain
[53:31] Hallelujah the rain the anointing
[53:34] Hallelujah that's the type of the rain
[53:36] the anointing he says he says um he says
[53:40] in that day I'm going go back and read
[53:43] it Isaiah 10 it
[53:46] says and it shall come to pass in that
[53:49] day that is burden shall be taken away
[53:52] from off thy shoulders some of you got
[53:55] heavy shoulders you know why cuz you're
[53:57] dodging the
[54:01] anointing whoa oh my he said in his Yol
[54:04] from off thy neck and the Yoke shall be
[54:07] destroyed because of the
[54:09] rain because of the anointing how often
[54:12] do we come to church and we look for
[54:16] deliverance Hallelujah I ain't talking
[54:18] about a special meeting hallelujah
[54:20] sister J what about what about I'm sorry
[54:22] you're not sister J she look like a
[54:23] little bit but but but think about
[54:27] what if we Hallelujah are in a place in
[54:30] our life Hallelujah before we get to
[54:34] Camp amen before we get to Camp we're
[54:36] already anointed before we get to Camp
[54:39] we're already walking in his presence
[54:42] before we come back Sunday morning we've
[54:44] already bathed in the rain H the rain
[54:47] not just a drizzle but a downpour you
[54:50] bathed and you labored In God's Presence
[54:53] till all your yolks and burdens have
[54:55] been destroyed because of the
[54:58] rain what if right now you would tap
[55:01] into the anointing God would do
[55:03] something special in your
[55:09] life but what do we do we resist the
[55:12] anointing because people are afraid of
[55:17] emotion and if I can hallelujah what you
[55:22] call the thing uh a pet
[55:24] peeve I got a pet peeve amen why all of
[55:28] a
[55:29] sudden Ministries are badgering the
[55:33] worship come on come on why all of a
[55:36] sudden Ministries are taking a stab at
[55:39] the worship H because it's the enemy
[55:42] Hallelujah trying to keep you from
[55:45] Catching the
[55:47] anointing trying to keep you from
[55:49] Catching your freedom and your Liberty
[55:51] by looking at Hallelujah the way you
[55:53] worship and the way it sound who cares
[55:55] long as I get
[56:03] delivered oh brother you were just a
[56:06] little too
[56:08] loud
[56:10] KN oh brother no kicking and shouting
[56:14] you know what you people that feel like
[56:16] that I doubt they could have been in
[56:18] brother Brandon's
[56:21] meetings they say that message Believers
[56:23] but when they see the anointing
[56:26] sometimes they fall under the same tree
[56:28] that the Sadducees and Pharisees fall
[56:30] under because yeah they were fundamental
[56:33] yeah they had all their Traditions but
[56:34] when Jesus came who was the opening of
[56:37] the word who was the anointing himself
[56:39] they called it a
[56:41] devil my and it's still the same Spirit
[56:45] looking at the true anointing of God
[56:47] calling it a
[56:49] devil praise God
[56:52] onlu but I refuse to become cold formal
[56:56] and
[56:59] Powerless
[57:03] I I refuse to be a church with no
[57:06] testimony I refuse to be a church

[1:01:45] [Music]
[1:01:48] devil
[1:01:52] oh oh my church
[1:01:56] I preached a message
[1:01:58] on dealing with the
[1:02:00] Masterpiece and I use some quotes from
[1:02:03] Michelangelo and my subject was stay
[1:02:06] with
[1:02:06] division but one thing Michelangelo had
[1:02:09] to Hallelujah do he had to have his mind
[1:02:13] in a certain place
[1:02:15] Hallelujah to where all the distractions
[1:02:19] wouldn't deter his
[1:02:20] vision all the distractions with with
[1:02:23] with life wouldn't destroy
[1:02:26] what was in his mind Hallelujah and
[1:02:29] there's one place he says hallelujah if
[1:02:32] you knew what it take Hallelujah to get
[1:02:35] where I am you wouldn't want to follow
[1:02:39] me oh my church we haven't come through
[1:02:43] a Hallelujah a bed of ease so I say to
[1:02:46] all of you you have a right to rejoice
[1:02:49] in God oh my if we can hit it if we can
[1:02:53] hit it real good you got a right to clap
[1:02:55] on a 2 4 or 13 a 56 a 8 n however the
[1:03:00] Lord want to leave you to praise you
[1:03:02] praise
[1:03:06] am oh
[1:03:10] my
[1:03:11] but are you growing in the presence of
[1:03:15] that rain Hallelujah because the rain
[1:03:19] comes to pull something out of you yes
[1:03:22] now that's the first initiation all
[1:03:24] right we've EXP experience the rain but
[1:03:27] now the other thing that happens with
[1:03:29] the seed when it rains what also makes
[1:03:32] it grow is the light you need light but
[1:03:35] we don't have the same light we have a
[1:03:38] different light a more complex
[1:03:44] light oh
[1:03:47] my church you know as time went along
[1:03:50] don't get nervous I ain't gonna be too
[1:03:51] much longer you know as time went along
[1:03:55] how they how they projected
[1:03:57] light it progressed Hallelujah but it
[1:04:02] was always there
[1:04:04] amen only a certain group of people
[1:04:07] could walk in that light the revealing
[1:04:10] of that light now look Hallelujah the
[1:04:13] Bible
[1:04:14] says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and
[1:04:20] a light unto my path Hall so the word is
[1:04:24] a type of light Hallelujah
[1:04:26] see we don't have the same light that
[1:04:28] Luther had we don't have the same light
[1:04:32] that Noah had H we don't have the same
[1:04:34] light that Moses had we got the same
[1:04:37] rain but a different light Hallelujah
[1:04:41] he's still the same God the same
[1:04:43] anointing throughout the generations but
[1:04:45] now there's a different message
[1:04:47] Hallelujah because there's a different
[1:04:48] achievement or overcoming that God wants
[1:04:51] from this church are you growing in the
[1:04:55] light
[1:04:56] hallelujah look he said Thy word is a
[1:04:59] lamp unto my feet Hallelujah the light a
[1:05:04] light unto my path oh my so church as we
[1:05:07] walk in the light it illuminates our
[1:05:11] direction it'll show you where you
[1:05:13] should go and where you shouldn't go
[1:05:15] that's what the word of the hour will do
[1:05:18] if you're participating and paying
[1:05:20] attention in it and let me say like this
[1:05:22] when the true anointing Falls it'll make
[1:05:25] you want to go
[1:05:27] study oh that was kind of
[1:05:33] weak I hope y'all not waiting on the
[1:05:35] ministry to give it all to you
[1:05:38] on
[1:05:40] hallelujah
[1:05:43] look I just want to give you some forms
[1:05:45] of
[1:05:46] light one form of light is called
[1:05:49] hologen we've heard of that right a
[1:05:53] hologen light is is this that kind of
[1:05:56] light it gives you a natural feeling of
[1:05:58] white light now everything I'm going to
[1:06:01] every every every form of light I'm
[1:06:02] talking about I want you to put it in a
[1:06:06] bulb amen and you take a hologen and put
[1:06:09] it in a bulb it's it's it's a it's a
[1:06:12] natural filling of white light but then
[1:06:15] there's another one called
[1:06:18] incandesent it said this light
[1:06:21] Hallelujah is heated up until it
[1:06:24] glows amen
[1:06:27] wow oh my it's still anointed H but now
[1:06:32] it's a different light Hallelujah one
[1:06:35] light is is is is is there to feel more
[1:06:39] natural or more natural white but this
[1:06:41] light Hallelujah the next light is
[1:06:44] heated up Hallelujah but when it
[1:06:46] projects white it looks like it's
[1:06:48] glowing
[1:06:50] Hallelujah when was the last time the
[1:06:53] word was in your life and you felt like
[1:06:55] you were
[1:06:56] glowing you feel like the word was
[1:06:59] having such an effect in your life that
[1:07:01] when somebody seeing you they say when I
[1:07:03] see you I see the
[1:07:04] [Music]
[1:07:08] F John the Baptist was
[1:07:11] glowing oh
[1:07:13] my the disciples Hallelujah they were
[1:07:17] glowing oh
[1:07:19] my listen those are two forms of life
[1:07:22] but then if we keep going in the stages
[1:07:25] of life light the light gets brighter
[1:07:27] there's another light called
[1:07:31] fluorescent fluorescent it gives off a
[1:07:35] color of white see not only is it white
[1:07:38] but it's giving off the natural color of
[1:07:41] white it's not glowing but when you look
[1:07:43] at florescent see the thing about
[1:07:44] fuorescent fluorescent light you can add
[1:07:47] different colors in it
[1:07:51] amen oh my but the one I like is the one
[1:07:55] I think we're all familiar with
[1:08:02] LED most of our cars have what kind of
[1:08:05] light
[1:08:07] LED because
[1:08:09] LED is 90% brighter than the other ones
[1:08:13] I named but it's still
[1:08:15] light what makes it brighter
[1:08:21] Hallelujah LED light Hallelujah
[1:08:26] it lights up 90% more efficient
[1:08:29] Hallelujah than the other lights because
[1:08:31] they said there's a certain energy
[1:08:33] moving through the bu Hallelujah there's
[1:08:36] more energy moving through a LED Hall
[1:08:38] see it's not just coming to church it's
[1:08:40] not
[1:08:41] just Co but an experience there there's
[1:08:45] something that's taking place there's an
[1:08:47] energy there they can feel God in the
[1:08:50] room Hallelujah we need an LED
[1:08:53] experience
[1:08:56] amen that's right
[1:08:59] aise God it's still like but it's giving
[1:09:03] off more
[1:09:08] energy some of us we come to church and
[1:09:10] we give off the same
[1:09:13] energy every time we come come on we
[1:09:17] hear we experience the anointing sing
[1:09:20] good
[1:09:21] songs and we hear good preaching
[1:09:25] and this is all the energy we
[1:09:37] have your amens are not even a
[1:09:49] voice what kind of energy is
[1:09:53] that do you think God will respond to
[1:09:56] that Hall you get what you expect
[1:09:59] hallelujah
[1:10:01] hallelujah oh my look church amen listen
[1:10:04] what the prophet of God says and I and I
[1:10:07] ain't going to be too much longer by the
[1:10:08] grace of God but I want to I want I want
[1:10:10] to show that Hallelujah that seed you
[1:10:13] and I our seeds in these two things
[1:10:16] every time we come to
[1:10:19] service every time yes we need to
[1:10:22] experience the water the rain amen the
[1:10:26] anointing and we also need to be present
[1:10:29] when the light is
[1:10:30] shining not your mind drifting off way
[1:10:33] know because this light this light what
[1:10:35] is it doing every time that light comes
[1:10:38] in contact with that seed it pulls it up
[1:10:41] a little bit higher just like the Su n
[1:10:44] when it comes in contact Hallelujah with
[1:10:47] the S D it what does it do it has the
[1:10:50] effect to pull it out of its
[1:10:53] conditions it pulls it out out of the
[1:10:55] dirt pulls it out of the surroundings
[1:10:58] and nothing can stop it once it comes in
[1:11:01] contact why because there's something on
[1:11:03] the inside
[1:11:07] happening you can have a hurricane and a
[1:11:10] hurricane come through and tear
[1:11:11] everything up but when that season of
[1:11:13] light comes back around that seed will
[1:11:16] continue to grow just like it
[1:11:23] did Hallelujah prise God look listen
[1:11:26] what the prophet of God
[1:11:29] says are you happy
[1:11:32] tonight cuz you know y'all know I've
[1:11:35] been going around and there's something
[1:11:38] that our churches have been missing
[1:11:40] we've been hearing the word all this
[1:11:41] time years and years and years and we've
[1:11:44] gotten mature come on come
[1:11:48] on come on I'm
[1:11:51] mature we don't we don't need all that
[1:11:53] brother dicks that's just you're just a
[1:11:55] little too
[1:11:58] radical on what we need to get back in
[1:12:00] church brother Matt in
[1:12:09] unison this is our
[1:12:12] power come on brother this is our power
[1:12:16] when you interact with the word with
[1:12:19] this how can God
[1:12:21] resist when you tell God you know what
[1:12:24] this says when you say this this means I
[1:12:27] believe this means god you're talking to
[1:12:30] me this means just like Mary be it unto
[1:12:33] me according to the word that I just
[1:12:36] [Applause]
[1:12:39] heard but we become good message
[1:12:42] Believers with no interaction with the
[1:12:50] [Music]
[1:12:53] anointing we get more exced excited
[1:12:55] about things that ain't going to do
[1:12:56] nothing for our life I guarantee that
[1:12:59] some of you are watching the debate last
[1:13:04] night a't ain't going to do nothing for
[1:13:06] you
[1:13:08] right we already got the
[1:13:11] light we already know what's going to
[1:13:15] happen Hallelujah we already know what's
[1:13:18] going to happen when we come to church
[1:13:20] we ought to be that more excited
[1:13:22] Hallelujah we got a man running and they
[1:13:25] can't be that that they can't control
[1:13:27] and we got a woman that'll take power
[1:13:29] which will be a
[1:13:32] prophecy and we come to church with
[1:13:39] no oh my oh
[1:13:43] mylah
[1:13:45] church just in case you
[1:13:49] forgot the
[1:13:50] anointing is not in the
[1:13:53] music come on
[1:13:56] no the anointing is not in the music the
[1:14:00] anointing is in your
[1:14:02] revelation of how you see God hallelujah
[1:14:06] hallelujah that's where the anointing
[1:14:08] lies Hallelujah cuz you look at it when
[1:14:10] David Hallelujah begin to fight Goliath
[1:14:13] he wasn't fighting with his own strength
[1:14:15] he was fighting by Revelation and that
[1:14:18] anointing that was there to help him
[1:14:20] defeat a lion and a bear was there to
[1:14:22] meet him when he fought Goliath what no
[1:14:24] music
[1:14:25] playing what was that anointing that
[1:14:28] anointing was supreme power under
[1:14:31] control knowing how and what Hallelujah
[1:14:35] now is the time David
[1:14:40] said but what we've done we've made it a
[1:14:43] a good song I pledge alance to the
[1:14:55] and there's nothing wrong with worship
[1:14:57] and worship and songs
[1:15:00] Hallelujah but is God still there when
[1:15:02] there's no
[1:15:05] music can you still
[1:15:09] say listen the prophet of God tells a
[1:15:12] story he's sitting in the living room
[1:15:15] and he's telling some of the Saints
[1:15:18] about the third pool he's talking about
[1:15:21] the Silver Tip Grizzly he's talking
[1:15:24] about Hallelujah the storm on the
[1:15:26] mountain he's talking about the little
[1:15:28] fish that rolls Hallelujah he's talking
[1:15:31] about the caribou and there was a woman
[1:15:33] sitting there
[1:15:35] listening who wasn't there at any of
[1:15:38] those events but she caught the
[1:15:41] anointing she caught the anointing for
[1:15:44] salvation hallu she caught the anointing
[1:15:46] for the supernatural by just doing what
[1:15:52] saying but just saying that ain't
[1:15:54] nothing but the truth you know when she
[1:15:55] was telling the prophet she was saying
[1:15:57] so be
[1:16:01] it and the devil don't want us to amen
[1:16:03] the word the devil don't want us to be
[1:16:06] free enough to say hallelujah he don't
[1:16:08] want us to be free enough to say thank
[1:16:09] you Jesus for the word that's your
[1:16:13] power thank you
[1:16:16] Lord and don't give me that non sense
[1:16:19] that's just the way I'm built
[1:16:28] yeah you need to be torn down and
[1:16:31] rebuilt Hallelujah but she's sitting
[1:16:34] there and she is listening to all the
[1:16:36] stuff the prophet was saying and she
[1:16:39] wasn't there at none of those events but
[1:16:42] something was
[1:16:44] clicking the rain was coming
[1:16:48] down was no instruments being played
[1:16:52] hallelujah amen was no music nothing

[1:17:07] mountain the same anointing that was
[1:17:09] there with the bear in The Caribou the
[1:17:11] same anointing that was there with the
[1:17:13] little fish was the same anointing right
[1:17:16] there in that living room when she said

[1:17:21] the same anointing

[1:17:29] another
[1:17:31] seed church we can experience some of
[1:17:33] the same things that the prophet
[1:17:35] experienced if we would just amen the
[1:17:43] word that's why I ain't got time to be
[1:17:45] fussing and arguing with people about
[1:17:47] what's right and what ain't
[1:17:50] right
[1:17:52] huah Sons and Daughters of God are led

[1:26:34] brother dig say this this where I'm
[1:26:40] comfortable and that's why you miss God
[1:26:43] because you've become
[1:26:46] comfortable I don't never want the
[1:26:47] presence of God to get comfortable to me
[1:26:50] Hallelujah I want him to shake me up
[1:26:52] every time I come H I want to expect the
[1:26:55] unexpected HJ I want God to sweep in and
[1:26:58] touch me like he didn't touch me last
[1:27:01] week I want God to come in and speak
[1:27:03] words to me that I've never heard before
[1:27:06] I don't want to be comfortable
[1:27:07] Hallelujah I want to be alert I want to
[1:27:10] be on edge Hallelujah I want to be All
[1:27:12] Shook
[1:27:15] Up I want to be to a place almost I'm
[1:27:19] I'm just almost uh shaking because I
[1:27:22] don't know what he's going to do next
[1:27:25] am
[1:27:27] am that's where I want to
[1:27:30] beu I want to be all traditional and all
[1:27:33] got everything together I'm a message
[1:27:35] believer you know who was like that the
[1:27:37] Sadducees and
[1:27:38] Pharisees they were so traditional with
[1:27:42] Moses's
[1:27:45] message that when Hallelujah The Light
[1:27:48] Came they were stuck in the same
[1:27:52] anointing amen come on The Light Came
[1:27:57] Hallelujah and they called it a
[1:28:00] devil because it didn't match up with
[1:28:02] their Traditions that's
[1:28:05] right I'm all right I know you know
[1:28:07] people call me all kind of stuff it's
[1:28:09] all good my mama still call me by
[1:28:13] name you can say what you want just
[1:28:16] spell my name
[1:28:17] right
[1:28:19] Hallelujah and now I'm getting to a
[1:28:21] place where I'm correcting people on how
[1:28:22] they pronounce it it's been too long for
[1:28:25] people to be still calling me
[1:28:28] kidy Hallelujah on it's like Sky Kai
[1:28:35] Dre all right Kai Dre all right okay
[1:28:40] praise the
[1:28:41] Lord but look what the prophet of God
[1:28:45] says this is what the prophet of God
[1:28:49] says he says now what God separates
[1:28:53] Darkness from light
[1:28:55] or light from darkness and he separates
[1:28:58] death from life and he does it by his
[1:29:02] word his word is what always brings this
[1:29:05] forth amen see so church is not just
[1:29:09] only the anointing that separates us
[1:29:13] it's the word that we're
[1:29:15] hearing it's the word that you're living
[1:29:18] that separates you from any denomination
[1:29:21] hallelujah it's the light that you're
[1:29:23] walking in
[1:29:24] it's the path that's been illuminated
[1:29:26] hallelujah it's all these things that
[1:29:29] coincide with the revealing of light
[1:29:31] that makes you who you
[1:29:34] are
[1:29:37] Hallelujah so when we come to church we
[1:29:40] ought not just to be here to be here but
[1:29:43] there should be an expectation and a
[1:29:46] participation Hallelujah I'm going ask
[1:29:49] the question again tonight are you
[1:29:51] growing
[1:29:54] because the rain causes the seed to
[1:29:56] unlock and the light pulls the seed out
[1:29:59] of its present
[1:30:01] condition Hallelujah so if we got the
[1:30:04] rain which is the anointing and we got
[1:30:06] the word which is the light we should be
[1:30:09] different we should be
[1:30:11] growing Hallelujah God we shouldn't be
[1:30:15] just coming around with the same old
[1:30:17] experiences the same old testimony no
[1:30:20] there should be growth in our
[1:30:22] journey Hallelujah sir he says now light
[1:30:25] well now need was always was was already
[1:30:29] upon the earth I believe God had planned
[1:30:32] plant the seed and just as long as the
[1:30:35] sun could get to that seed it begin to
[1:30:38] grow and I believe in this church God
[1:30:41] can get to the
[1:30:44] seed let's stop blocking the light and
[1:30:47] let's open up the way so the light can
[1:30:50] just Shine On Us yeah we experience the
[1:30:53] anointing the anointing is
[1:30:55] here but let's let the word have its way
[1:30:58] in our
[1:31:02] life
[1:31:05] Hallelujah
[1:31:07] listen he says and that's the way God
[1:31:10] has today his seed is already here
[1:31:13] somebody say amen he said his word the
[1:31:16] only thing it needs is light right amen
[1:31:20] and I believe in this church the truth
[1:31:23] of the light is is being preached so
[1:31:26] what what am I saying that we should be
[1:31:32] growing you you you you can call me
[1:31:34] crazy but I believe when we come to
[1:31:37] church Supernatural things should take
[1:31:39] place every time we
[1:31:41] come if the anointing is here if God is
[1:31:46] here there should be a testimony every
[1:31:49] service amen
[1:31:52] amen sometimes God to do things and
[1:31:54] you're not even aware of
[1:31:57] it
[1:31:59] Hallelujah he said the only thing it
[1:32:01] needs is light upon it and he is that
[1:32:04] light for he is the word the word and
[1:32:07] the light is the same thing right are
[1:32:10] you with me Church the light I'm talking
[1:32:12] about is the word which is the same
[1:32:17] thing the word and the light is the same
[1:32:19] thing the life is in there in the light
[1:32:22] of the word see is the life Hallelujah
[1:32:26] your life is where in the word that
[1:32:29] you're hearing for your
[1:32:32] day amen and as long as the anointing is
[1:32:35] present Hallelujah and the word comes
[1:32:37] forth we should be experiencing
[1:32:40] spiritual
[1:32:41] growth amen amen when your baby is born
[1:32:45] you don't expect that baby to stay an
[1:32:48] infant but you expect that baby to grow
[1:32:51] and as it's growing you're teaching it h
[1:32:54] based upon what is going to
[1:32:59] become you teach it how to walk why
[1:33:01] because you knew the potential was
[1:33:03] already there you teaching how to talk
[1:33:06] why because you knew the potential was
[1:33:07] already
[1:33:08] there Hallelujah God teaches us how to
[1:33:11] walk spiritually why because he knows
[1:33:14] the potential is already there God
[1:33:16] teaches us how to talk spiritual why
[1:33:18] because he knows the potential is
[1:33:20] already
[1:33:21] there amen
[1:33:24] Hallelujah pise God some of us have been
[1:33:26] babies too
[1:33:30] long and if that one ain't good enough
[1:33:32] for you I got it in blood
[1:33:38] too
[1:33:40] Church let's get on the edile
[1:33:44] seats Hallelujah let's stop getting
[1:33:47] trapped in true tradition on let's stop
[1:33:50] getting trapped in walls of
[1:33:52] religion and let get back to being free
[1:33:55] as God made
[1:33:56] us hallelujah where God can have his way
[1:34:00] with our lives but we would come and
[1:34:03] expect to be touched by God we would
[1:34:06] come and expect to hear from God we
[1:34:08] would come and expect Our Lives to be
[1:34:11] changed

[1:50:35] taught of God hears my words I just say
[1:50:39] Lord I'm so glad to be taught of God
[1:50:42] what a privilege you ought to think

[1:50:47] when when the overwhelming majority in
[1:50:50] the days when Jesus was walking the
[1:50:53] shores of Galilee everybody walked away
[1:50:56] but 12 and one of them wasn't no good
[1:50:58] and and I just say Lord I if I'm the

[1:59:49] my wife and I just got back from trip of

[1:59:54] wonderful things for me so I just want
[1:59:55] to give him the praise for it when we
[1:59:58] first got on the plane at New York and
[2:00:01] we were going to Athens the um you're
[2:00:04] supposed to take your laptop out of
[2:00:06] course you all know that's my bread and
[2:00:07] butter so you put it in a bin and then
[2:00:10] behind that they want you to take
[2:00:11] everything else out so your wallet your
[2:00:13] passport your money everything and then
[2:00:15] my bag and it goes through the thing and
[2:00:18] they aren't paying any attention it gets
[2:00:19] all bound up my laptop top flips over
[2:00:24] falls and hits the floor all my money my
[2:00:26] passport everything right underneath
[2:00:28] their equipment wow and I started
[2:00:30] freaking out and of course I get on my
[2:00:32] hands and knees and crawl around and I
[2:00:34] get everything and the laptop's okay and
[2:00:37] I was just very thankful that the Lord
[2:00:39] protected it and then several days later
[2:00:42] we flew to an island from Athens and um
[2:00:45] I was so busy trying to get off the
[2:00:47] plane helping people get their luggage
[2:00:50] from up above actually left my phone on
[2:00:53] the
[2:00:54] plane and I didn't even realize it until
[2:00:57] we got to where we were staying an hour
[2:00:59] later and I asked the driver I'm like
[2:01:02] you got to turn around you got to take
[2:01:04] me back to the airport and so I go back
[2:01:07] to the airport I'm expecting him and he
[2:01:09] speaks Greek I don't I'm expecting him
[2:01:12] to help me right and we pull up and he's
[2:01:14] like all right I'll be out here driving
[2:01:16] in circles good
[2:01:17] [Laughter]
[2:01:19] luck I just started praying I was like
[2:01:21] Lord just tell me what to do and um I
[2:01:24] couldn't get anybody anywhere to help me
[2:01:26] so I finally decided I'll just walk
[2:01:28] where I'm not supposed to walk in
[2:01:30] security and I'll get all kinds of
[2:01:32] attention and sure enough I had two
[2:01:34] police officers come up to me and they
[2:01:36] explain and I explained and I went and
[2:01:39] got a a piece of paper that said lost
[2:01:42] and found and they let me back there
[2:01:44] thank God somebody on that plane saw my
[2:01:47] phone and it was the
[2:01:50] one got phone back while I was there and
[2:01:55] then the third thing that happened to us
[2:01:57] and I'm just so thankful so I had hurt
[2:01:59] my foot and I told my wife I'm like you
[2:02:01] might as well put me in a wheelchair and
[2:02:03] just get one of them wheel things and
[2:02:06] and so the lady was helping us and she
[2:02:08] was putting all the luggage and Mike and
[2:02:11] I she started pushing me we were
[2:02:13] laughing having fun there's a little
[2:02:14] video on Facebook but we didn't NE one
[2:02:17] realize it we were in Charlotte and that
[2:02:20] was on the way home we had another
[2:02:21] flight 3 hours later 15 minutes before
[2:02:24] we get on the other flight we realized
[2:02:25] that neither myself nor my wife nor that
[2:02:28] lady had taken my luggage and put it
[2:02:30] underneath that thing and there's no way
[2:02:33] we were ever going to get in time we had
[2:02:35] to go back out go to security and all
[2:02:37] that I just started praying I was like
[2:02:40] all right Lord just it's whatever it
[2:02:42] wasn't even tagged I actually had
[2:02:44] carried it on the plane so it didn't
[2:02:46] have they couldn't trace it or nothing
[2:02:48] so I get home and I call my buddy that
[2:02:50] lives in Charlotte I'm like will you do
[2:02:52] me a favor will you please go to the
[2:02:54] lost and found in the Charlotte Airport
[2:02:57] and uh I see that my luggage is in the
[2:03:00] airport because I have a tracer on it
[2:03:02] and after about five different people
[2:03:04] send him in all these different
[2:03:06] directions he finally sends me a picture
[2:03:08] back of my luggage so God did that those
[2:03:10] three things for me and I just want to
[2:03:12] give him praise for it and I I thank him
[2:03:14] for watching over us and all the little
[2:03:16] things that he does yeah amen
[2:03:23] amen anybody else before we go praise
[2:03:25] the lordon oh where you at okay go ahead
[2:03:28] brother um Saturday we were driving home
[2:03:31] from town and our car threw a check
[2:03:33] engine light which whatever check engine
[2:03:35] light but this one made it go into limp
[2:03:37] mode so we couldn't go over like 25
[2:03:39] miles an hour so I was freaking out and
[2:03:41] our our car is too smart for its own
[2:03:43] Goods so it sent us a text message like
[2:03:45] hey there's something wrong with your uh
[2:03:46] drivetrain you need to take it to the
[2:03:48] dealership immediately and so I was like
[2:03:50] oh great so I went to the auto part
[2:03:52] store immediately cuz the dealership
[2:03:54] wasn't open and had him check the code
[2:03:56] and it was a
[2:03:58] p1061 there's a recall out on my car
[2:04:00] right now for catastrophic engine
[2:04:02] failure but they don't have the stuff to
[2:04:05] do all the recall on everybody's car
[2:04:07] right at the second so basically they're
[2:04:09] just doing them as they blow up and so
[2:04:12] so I took it to the
[2:04:13] dealership and uh on Monday and they
[2:04:18] didn't get a chance to look at it and I
[2:04:19] was like oh man what are we going to do
[2:04:20] so I was like like well let's just go
[2:04:22] run a car so we went to the Run Place
[2:04:23] they didn't have any cars so I was like
[2:04:25] okay well I guess we'll just figure it
[2:04:27] out there's three other people living at
[2:04:29] my house besides my family and so we've
[2:04:32] got cars we'll figure it out and um so
[2:04:36] they called me um
[2:04:38] Tuesday and before that I went and
[2:04:41] pulled that recall notice out and it
[2:04:43] said it your car will throw code
[2:04:46] p161 um just bringing to the dealership
[2:04:49] I was like oh great and then I was
[2:04:51] looking at the fin it's like this uh
[2:04:53] this recall is good for 10 years 100,000
[2:04:55] Mi well I got 155,000 Mi on my car even
[2:04:59] though it's only not even three years
[2:05:00] old yet but um was like great I guess
[2:05:04] I'm going to have to put an engine in
[2:05:05] myself so they call me to on uh Tuesday
[2:05:08] and he's like hey uh Simmons you're um
[2:05:11] we checked out your car uh everything
[2:05:13] seems to be fine we went ahead and reset
[2:05:14] the check engine light and we've been
[2:05:16] driving around and it hasn't come back
[2:05:18] on so uh basically just take it home and
[2:05:20] drive it if the check in light comes
[2:05:22] back on just bring it back to us we'll
[2:05:24] replace the engine under warranty I was
[2:05:26] like are you sure I was like CU I just
[2:05:28] check the recall notice and he looked up
[2:05:29] on the computer he's like yeah he says

[2:05:33] said but there is an amendment in here
[2:05:34] that it is doesn't there's no mileage uh
