[0:00] we invite you to this into our presence
[0:01] father that you promised that where two
[0:03] or three were gathered in your name that
[0:05] you would be there and we're gathered in
[0:07] your name father so we expect you to be
[0:08] here we ask these things in your name
[0:11] the lord jesus christ amen now
[0:13] um
[0:15] we are
[0:16] y'all can be seated um we had
[0:19] some
[0:21] oh come on now
[0:23] my machine is
[0:25] acting up all right
[0:27] so uh y'all bear with us bear with me
[0:29] this morning i got scheduled to do the
[0:31] sound booth and the sunday school today
[0:33] so we're gonna not gonna have a screen
[0:36] for now um but uh the um so i expect
[0:39] y'all to have bibles um you know at
[0:42] church who'd have thought um
[0:45] so i'm gonna
[0:47] uh pull my my thing up here so we'll
[0:50] turn to james chapter 1 and verse 17.
[0:59] and uh y'all give me a give me a nod
[1:02] when you're when you got it everybody
[1:04] everybody good
[1:05] all right
[1:06] it says in every good gift and every
[1:08] perfect gift is from above
[1:10] and cometh down from the father of
[1:12] lights with whom is no variableness
[1:14] neither shadow of turning
[1:17] now for a title or my sunday school just
[1:19] to give you some idea of where i'm going
[1:21] um the title that i took today is the
[1:23] light of the world
[1:25] um and here we so in here in james it
[1:28] shows that uh says james or i'm sorry
[1:30] that god
[1:32] is the father of lights
[1:34] which is a
[1:35] interesting way of saying that um
[1:38] there are a couple things that this sort
[1:40] of implies is number one it implies that
[1:42] god is light obviously because if god is
[1:44] having is the father of lights then must
[1:47] be light
[1:48] um also implies that his children are
[1:50] lights
[1:51] right all of all of you are lights um
[1:55] and uh
[1:58] it's so
[1:59] i have just a couple bullet points i
[2:00] kind of want to go through as i read
[2:02] this scripture these are just the
[2:03] thoughts that kind of came to me
[2:05] so it's the light is originating with
[2:07] god but expressed through his children
[2:11] and so we we can take matthew chapter 5
[2:14] and verse 14 you're the light of the
[2:15] world a city that is set on a hill
[2:17] cannot be hid neither do men light a
[2:19] candle and put it under a bushel but on
[2:21] a candlestick and give it and it giveth
[2:24] light unto all that are in the house
[2:26] let your light so shine before men that
[2:29] they may see your good works and glorify
[2:31] your father which is in heaven
[2:34] and so we see that the the purpose
[2:37] right that the purpose of
[2:39] god's children is to be a light under
[2:41] the world that there would be a that the
[2:43] world would be covered in darkness and
[2:44] that the the children of god would light
[2:46] that world up by shining by being an
[2:48] example by living
[2:51] presenting light
[2:53] to the to the world
[2:58] because the purpose of this
[3:00] is because that all life
[3:02] starts with light
[3:04] okay um in genesis chapter one right in
[3:07] the beginning
[3:09] god created the heavens and the earth
[3:10] right he created stars that's light and
[3:12] his also said let there be light nothing
[3:14] on earth like the first day of creation
[3:17] of creating life on earth was let there
[3:19] be light right all light all life starts
[3:22] with light
[3:23] but we can take this in a spiritual
[3:24] aspect as well look at the burning bush
[3:26] right or paul getting knocked out of his
[3:28] saddle what happened to great light
[3:29] shown right in order for that for god to
[3:32] be revealed in that spiritual life to
[3:34] activate
[3:35] in in someone's heart
[3:38] that
[3:40] supernatural light of the of god's word
[3:42] has to flash across their their life
[3:45] and uh
[3:46] there's several i have a couple
[3:47] different quotes here where brother
[3:48] branham talks about this um says in uh
[3:50] we would see jesus says um
[3:53] all the father has given me and i'm just
[3:54] kind of skipping through these i'm not
[3:56] reading the whole quote just because for
[3:57] time's sake but um just some highlights
[3:59] it says all the father has given me will
[4:01] come and when the light flashes across
[4:03] that predestinated seed something takes
[4:06] place like that poor little adulterous
[4:07] woman that we spoke of tonight she was
[4:10] sick and tired of the way they were
[4:11] doing as far as we know she belonged
[4:14] nowhere but she had been foreseen by god
[4:16] and as soon as she seen that light flash
[4:20] even in face of the priests of that day
[4:22] who didn't know what it was
[4:24] like the blind man when he received his
[4:26] sight okay in sermon why
[4:30] it says and now god you put
[4:32] our names on the lamb's book of life
[4:34] before the foundation the world father
[4:36] god i pray tonight if there's any of
[4:39] that seed laying here in this church
[4:41] tonight
[4:42] i'm no judge you are i'm only
[4:44] responsible for preaching your word but
[4:46] if there's any of that seed here tonight
[4:48] lord i believe that light flashes over
[4:50] it it's got to come to life
[4:52] and then in jehovah jireh
[4:54] this is just god's seed materializing
[4:57] that's all his words coming down
[4:59] now when the light of god flashes across
[5:01] that quickly that seed recognizes it
[5:04] because it's born of god it's abraham's
[5:06] seed forenode by god that's why the
[5:08] light flashes is to catch that seed
[5:12] um can you play that video
[5:15] so the other thing that
[5:17] so you know i'd heard these quotes a lot
[5:20] um
[5:20] [Music]
[5:22] talk you know brother i'm talking about
[5:23] the light flashing across the seed and
[5:24] then i saw this is it is it playing it's
[5:27] kind of slow there's no audio or
[5:28] anything
[5:29] um
[5:30] there we go so this is a an egg cell
[5:32] being fertilized and right now they're
[5:34] using some different like light spectrum
[5:36] imaging so you can't really see it but
[5:38] in a minute it's going to show a
[5:42] you can read the the text here
[5:46] that when that egg is fertilized
[5:49] there is a flash of light that actually
[5:51] takes place
[5:53] and it'll show in a second
[6:00] so watch
[6:07] that's that's
[6:09] a grid of egg cells being fertilized
[6:11] automatically or is that's the moment of
[6:13] fertilization
[6:15] um
[6:17] the
[6:18] so here we see literally a seed the seed
[6:20] of human life a light literally must
[6:22] flash across it in order for for it to
[6:25] become alive um and the
[6:27] the
[6:29] the important one i don't know if they
[6:31] mentioned it but only a mature egg will
[6:34] will flash
[6:35] if an unmature egg that cannot is not
[6:38] prepared to bring forth life the light
[6:40] won't flash
[6:42] it won't happen it requires that like
[6:44] that flash of light is integral the
[6:47] chemical reaction that produces that
[6:48] flash of light is integral to that egg
[6:51] becoming a life
[6:54] and so
[6:55] you know when you see a type like this
[6:57] runs
[6:58] all the way through nature and the bible
[7:01] right this is this isn't something that
[7:03] you just
[7:05] kind of uh
[7:06] you know take for granted this is this
[7:08] is something that
[7:09] to me it's
[7:11] it really shows that this is a core
[7:13] pillar of the way god really built
[7:15] everything that everything from the plan
[7:17] of salvation to
[7:19] you know every living creature i mean
[7:21] even in animals this was
[7:23] the video here um you can take that down
[7:25] um but
[7:27] that video that was of humans but they'd
[7:29] originally figured this out decades ago
[7:32] with cows
[7:33] and it just takes a very long time to
[7:35] actually
[7:36] prove it happens in other animals too
[7:38] but point is all pretty much all life on
[7:40] earth this takes place all life takes
[7:43] place with a flash of light
[7:46] um
[7:48] and so likewise
[7:50] when uh
[7:52] you know like like i said with paul you
[7:53] know any child of god
[7:55] um i know
[7:57] i hadn't put this in my notes but i know
[7:59] when i got saved i was talking brother
[8:01] jason and when he said the right words
[8:03] that
[8:04] struck my life that just cut through all
[8:07] of my doubt and and really quicken that
[8:08] word when he said that i remember at the
[8:11] time it so stunned me because when he
[8:14] looked at me
[8:15] i saw a physical light flash in his eyes
[8:18] right like it's
[8:20] now maybe that might have happened for
[8:21] everybody but my point is
[8:23] the flash of light is associated so
[8:26] often times with
[8:28] that that seed becoming life
[8:31] now
[8:32] um i want to
[8:36] change gears a little bit here
[8:39] and talk about um
[8:42] uh
[8:44] this um let's see here all right so uh
[8:47] perseverance this is from perseverance
[8:49] it says every time you look at the moon
[8:50] it isn't the moon shining it's the sun
[8:53] shining on the moon
[8:54] if i just say moon what makes you shine
[8:57] it's just not me shining it's something
[8:59] shining on me i'm supposed to keep the
[9:01] light going in the absence of the sun
[9:04] and the church is a type of the moon
[9:06] we're supposed to reflect the light
[9:08] while the absence of the son of god
[9:10] because we are sons and daughters of god
[9:12] the lesser light and as long as we can
[9:14] see that moon
[9:16] see that moon reflects the same kind of
[9:17] light as the sun does oh it isn't the
[9:20] people it's god in the people
[9:22] so if if
[9:24] if
[9:26] if you want to spread eternal life to
[9:28] the people of the world the only way to
[9:30] do that is to be the light that flashes
[9:32] across their life
[9:33] right that's the only way to do it
[9:35] that's why god wants people to be the
[9:38] light of the world to to not be the
[9:40] candle under a bushel to be
[9:42] the the moon
[9:44] reflect in the darkness right when the
[9:46] sun is on the earth
[9:48] the world is light you don't you know it
[9:50] you don't need a flashlight or any kind
[9:52] of light because the the sunlight's
[9:54] everything you know when christ is on
[9:56] the earth
[9:57] you know
[9:58] that it wasn't as necessary for the
[10:00] people of god to be that light because
[10:02] the actual light was on the earth but
[10:04] within the absence of the sun
[10:07] that lea that's we have to be that light
[10:09] right the moon doesn't again the moon is
[10:12] only is reflecting the same light that
[10:14] is there in the daytime
[10:15] right just as a lesser version of it
[10:19] and
[10:21] what so often happens is you know
[10:23] there's the cycle of the moon right
[10:26] it's not always a full moon it's very
[10:28] bright in the full moon in fact um
[10:30] you know a lot of times when you've got
[10:31] a nice bright full moon it's almost like
[10:33] it's daytime out you know nice clear sky
[10:36] but a lot of times that that moon comes
[10:38] in cycles it doesn't always isn't always
[10:40] all bright and shiny sometimes it's
[10:42] obscured right
[10:44] well why is it why does it get dark
[10:47] well what happens
[10:48] is the world comes between the moon and
[10:51] the sun
[10:52] that's what happens and so
[10:56] if you're not shining to the world is
[10:58] only ever going to see the light of the
[11:00] sun in this dark day
[11:02] so long as the moon us can keep the
[11:05] world out from between us and god
[11:07] right the moment that
[11:09] the the world comes between you and and
[11:12] god is when you're stuck you stop
[11:14] shining right they're never gonna see
[11:16] that you
[11:17] right you there has to be that that
[11:18] clear channel
[11:20] um
[11:24] now uh let me come back up to up to here
[11:35] right okay so
[11:38] right so um
[11:39] i i want to pick up another side of this
[11:41] and that is likewise with
[11:45] you know the relationship between us and
[11:47] you know the just the general christians
[11:48] and god
[11:49] um
[11:51] is so often typed as the same as between
[11:54] a man and a woman right
[11:57] and um and if the type
[11:59] so a lot of the types are going to carry
[12:01] over so
[12:03] likewise if um actually let me let me
[12:06] come down and grab this because this is
[12:07] important before i go into that
[12:21] oh dear well that was a mistake i
[12:24] accidentally highlighted the entire
[12:25] paragraph and now i can't find what i'm
[12:27] looking for
[12:28] um
[12:29] okay well we'll just skip that for now
[12:30] um the the
[12:32] there's a particular quote um
[12:34] where uh brother branham says that um
[12:37] talking about prophets and reflectors
[12:40] um
[12:42] and uh he's talking about how every
[12:43] prophet is a perfect reflector and he
[12:45] just reflects the word of god he's not
[12:47] the prophet isn't presenting his own
[12:48] light he's only presenting the light
[12:50] that god shines on him and then
[12:52] reflecting that to the people so that
[12:53] people can see it and then at the end of
[12:54] that um at the end of that
[12:57] uh oh wait no i think i just found it um
[13:00] uh
[13:06] oh maybe i didn't oh well um anyways at
[13:08] the end of it it says uh he says and and
[13:10] he makes a statement he says and you are
[13:12] reflectors talking to the people
[13:16] that's an
[13:17] odd transition right he's talking about
[13:19] how prophets are these reflectors and
[13:21] then he looks at the people and says
[13:22] you're reflectors too
[13:24] right
[13:25] though though
[13:27] that that relationship between god and
[13:30] the people is one of the people
[13:33] ultimately conform to the light that
[13:35] they are that is being shined on them um
[13:38] i have here um
[13:40] uh where it talks about john
[13:42] um
[13:45] uh
[13:45] john the baptist had to eat the book in
[13:48] order to reflect the word that was in it
[13:51] right
[13:52] um
[13:54] and
[13:56] the ultimately what there's this
[13:59] sort of
[14:02] parallel where
[14:04] the the the the reflector
[14:08] is
[14:09] obtains the properties of the light
[14:11] source
[14:12] right but the light source
[14:16] is only going to be as bright as that
[14:18] reflector allows it to be
[14:21] um
[14:22] but i i wanted to pick up here where
[14:24] it's uh
[14:25] that parallel between
[14:27] man and woman christ and the bride and
[14:29] how of christ in the the parallel
[14:30] between the sun and the moon
[14:32] uh is christ and the bride
[14:34] likewise you can kind of transition that
[14:35] over into into marriages because
[14:37] um you know i'll read in ephesians
[14:40] chapter five and verse 22 why submit
[14:42] yourselves unto your own husbands as
[14:44] unto the lord for the husband is the
[14:45] head of the wife and his christ is the
[14:46] head of the church
[14:48] and he is the savior of the body
[14:49] therefore the church is subject unto
[14:51] christ so let the wives be to their own
[14:53] husbands in everything now
[14:57] we
[14:59] unfortunately a lot of sisters get beat
[15:01] over the head with that scripture and
[15:03] it's ought to be that way um because he
[15:06] immediately sta uh
[15:07] transitions to husbands love your wives
[15:09] even as christ who loved the church and
[15:10] gave himself for it um i don't think any
[15:12] man has a position to beat his wife over
[15:14] the head with submit yourself if he is
[15:16] not willing to go die for her right like
[15:18] this isn't and and more importantly and
[15:20] i i would just change this a lot of men
[15:22] would have like because we're kind of
[15:23] wired this way like oh yeah i'll totally
[15:25] die for you but how many are willing to
[15:26] give their life
[15:27] there's there's a really big difference
[15:29] between giving your life giving your
[15:30] life doesn't always mean just going and
[15:31] dying right that's almost the easy thing
[15:33] to do right the hard thing is is is the
[15:36] grind is the day-to-day of dealing with
[15:39] issues and
[15:41] dying is over quick
[15:42] right
[15:44] you know giving your life for someone
[15:46] um
[15:47] it takes the rest of your life right
[15:49] like
[15:50] that's that takes 70 years you know this
[15:52] isn't this is
[15:55] this is
[15:57] um
[15:58] you know and
[15:59] uh and so just reading down it says so
[16:02] men love their wives even as their own
[16:03] bodies
[16:04] he that loveth his wife love loveth
[16:07] himself for no man ever yet hated his
[16:09] own flesh but nourisheth
[16:11] and cherisheth it even as the lord
[16:14] uh as the lord the church
[16:16] and so if the moon
[16:17] is a type of a woman and the sun is the
[16:19] type of the man and the moon only really
[16:21] reflects
[16:22] the light of the sun
[16:24] this is where we get quotes um
[16:29] that's like this if i can find it
[16:32] [Music]
[16:34] where brother branham makes a statement
[16:37] um
[16:38] uh
[16:40] it hears from choosing a bride and says
[16:41] again
[16:42] the kind of of a woman that a man would
[16:44] choose will reflect his ambition and his
[16:46] character if a man chooses the wrong
[16:48] woman and reflects his character and
[16:50] when he ties himself
[16:51] what he ties himself to shows truly
[16:54] what's in him a woman reflects what's in
[16:56] the man when he chooses her for wife it
[16:58] shows what's down in him no matter what
[17:00] he says outside watch what he marries i
[17:03] go to a man's office and he says he is a
[17:05] christian pen-ups all around on the
[17:07] walls and old boogie woogie music going
[17:09] on i don't care what he says i don't
[17:11] believe his testimony because his spirit
[17:14] is feeding on them things of the world
[17:17] what say if he would marry a chorus girl
[17:19] or what if he would marry a sex queen or
[17:21] just a pretty modern ricketta it
[17:23] reflects it shows
[17:25] what he has in his mind of what his
[17:27] future home is going to be
[17:30] because he took her to raise his
[17:32] children by and whatever she is that's
[17:35] the way she will raise those children so
[17:38] it reflects what's in the man a man that
[17:40] takes a woman like that shows just what
[17:42] he is thinking of the future could you
[17:45] imagine a christian doing a thing like
[17:47] that no sir i could not a true christian
[17:49] will not look for such beauty queens and
[17:52] chorus girls and sex queens he'll look
[17:53] for christian character
[17:56] and um
[17:58] and uh this is from questions and
[18:00] answers on genesis um it says now i
[18:02] think that would uh get the man and
[18:04] woman now a woman is let me get this
[18:07] right good now so you can see it woman
[18:09] is subject to her husband and the bible
[18:11] says that a man should rule over his
[18:13] wife
[18:14] but um and i'm going to skip
[18:17] says um
[18:18] uh he says about the man he says you are
[18:21] going to have to answer for your wife
[18:23] but your wife is never going to have to
[18:25] answer for you
[18:27] you are the head of the woman and god is
[18:29] the head of man therefore he said let
[18:31] the man cut his hair because of christ
[18:33] and let the woman have her hair for it
[18:35] if she cuts it cuts her hair she
[18:38] dishonors her husband see that's what i
[18:40] mean by what the scripture says so
[18:44] the moon
[18:45] if the light you know if the woman is
[18:47] the type of the moon she's only ever
[18:48] going to reflect what's in that man's
[18:49] life in his heart
[18:51] you know this is
[18:53] so many times you'll see some you know
[18:55] if sister is struggling with something
[18:57] you know
[18:58] there's a there's a sort of a
[19:00] knee-jerk reaction a lot of times you
[19:02] see some sister come to church she's
[19:03] struggling with something
[19:04] the reaction's like oh that sister
[19:06] what's wrong with her she needs this
[19:08] that and the other no what's wrong with
[19:09] her husband
[19:10] right why oh you know that sister she's
[19:13] got come to church covered in makeup and
[19:15] you know her face and neck are two
[19:16] different colors and you can like
[19:17] everybody in the whole church could see
[19:18] it okay well what what happened to that
[19:21] poor sister
[19:22] what sort of what sort of of husband
[19:25] mistreated her and made her feel so
[19:27] unpretty that she has to go put some
[19:29] makeup on her face
[19:31] and and and
[19:33] to try to catch his attention because
[19:34] every other woman is
[19:37] right you know if if the wife is a
[19:39] reflection of the husband
[19:42] the you know if you see again you see a
[19:43] sister struggling with something i
[19:44] guarantee you what's actually going on
[19:47] is the is the man in her life
[19:49] is
[19:50] is not
[19:51] living up to his his calling not living
[19:54] up to the to the standard of
[19:56] what god has put in his called him to be
[19:59] and as a result
[20:01] you know we talk about the head being
[20:03] over the body well
[20:06] you know
[20:06] if
[20:08] when when a crime is committed you don't
[20:11] blame the body you know the bible talks
[20:12] about oh someone was murdered well their
[20:15] blood will be on the murderer's head
[20:18] right
[20:19] you know
[20:20] the body the hand might hold the knife
[20:22] that did the stabbing but the head is
[20:24] the what gets cut off right that's the
[20:27] that's the
[20:28] you know the head is where the
[20:30] consciousness that's where the where the
[20:31] responsibility lies
[20:34] what the body becomes is what the head
[20:35] has been feeding on right the head has
[20:37] the vision has all four of the five
[20:39] senses are in the head
[20:40] right
[20:41] um it's also where the eating happens
[20:44] right the body becomes subject
[20:47] you know what the what the mouth feeds
[20:48] on is what the body manifests
[20:51] right and so you have husbands again all
[20:53] to all this time anytime you have
[20:56] wives who are struggling with things
[20:59] i guarantee you it's the husband not
[21:01] living up to his potential and feeding
[21:02] on the wrong things not feeding on the
[21:04] word because if he was wives
[21:07] will
[21:07] like
[21:08] it just naturally happens that way
[21:10] like if it's all in accordance to god's
[21:12] word if the if the household is being
[21:14] run in the way it should be um
[21:17] the head ship is where the leadership is
[21:18] and if the leadership is is off course
[21:21] then he's going to lead everyone down
[21:22] into the ditch
[21:25] and so
[21:26] i want to
[21:29] that's why you know
[21:31] even so so much more for
[21:33] for
[21:34] for the men
[21:36] it's it's our duty to be the light right
[21:39] it's our duty to be the vision to to
[21:42] to
[21:42] shine that path you
[21:45] you know what what we as men feed on
[21:47] what we what we do with our lives what
[21:49] you know staying in the word you know
[21:50] studying the word is not just for the
[21:52] preachers
[21:53] um every christian has a duty to sharpen
[21:56] your sword
[21:57] right every christian has it has a duty
[21:59] to maintain your weapons you're a
[22:01] soldier in god's army you don't neglect
[22:03] your sword um or you will die like
[22:06] that's just how it works and um
[22:09] and if you if you if you don't
[22:12] well you know you're going to have
[22:14] hardship you're going to have struggles
[22:15] your family isn't going to work the way
[22:17] it's supposed to it's not going to work
[22:18] in the
[22:19] in the smoothness that um
[22:22] that that god would have for your life
[22:25] um
[22:26] and i just want to start to wrap up and
[22:28] kind of put a a bookend on this
[22:31] um this whole little thought kind of
[22:33] came because i saw a news article
[22:35] about an ancient artifact ancient
[22:37] chinese artifact that some
[22:39] archaeologists found
[22:42] it was all covered in dust and dirt and
[22:44] grime
[22:45] oddly enough they didn't find it in
[22:46] china they found it in a warehouse in
[22:48] chicago
[22:49] that it had originated in china
[22:52] and it was a mirror
[22:54] and there's the the museum in chicago um
[22:57] and they have a huge warehouse full of
[22:59] artifacts they said they had like a
[23:00] hundred thousand different ancient
[23:02] chinese artifacts and they have a whole
[23:03] section just on bronze mirrors um just
[23:05] thousands of them laying around well
[23:07] they're going through their archive and
[23:08] curating it and figuring out what they
[23:09] want to put on display and things like
[23:10] that
[23:11] and um
[23:13] by pure happenstance one of the curators
[23:15] noticed that there was a particular
[23:17] mirror that was very special looks
[23:19] identical to everything else the only
[23:21] thing that makes it special is the
[23:22] reflection that it produces
[23:24] okay now it's a special kind of mirror
[23:27] they used to make them back in the day
[23:28] not so much you could still buy them now
[23:30] but they're more of a novelty but
[23:32] back in the day they were kind of like a
[23:33] really rare thing and they were they're
[23:35] called a magic mirror
[23:37] and it looks just like a regular mirror
[23:39] it's a bronze disc they polish super
[23:41] smooth and to create a reflection
[23:44] but a magic mirror
[23:46] when you get it in sunlight
[23:49] so if you ever take like a mirror and
[23:50] say if like i took the light and i could
[23:52] angle just right you put a spot on the
[23:54] ceiling i could project a light spot
[23:57] if you take one of these magic mirrors
[23:58] and you it has to be sunlight
[24:00] no man-made light is bright enough to do
[24:02] this but the way that mirror is designed
[24:05] as long as the surface is clean there's
[24:06] no dust it's not grimy it's not covered
[24:09] in in carnal dirt you get it in the
[24:11] light of the sun
[24:13] right
[24:14] not some man-made light because man-made
[24:15] light won't do it you get it in the
[24:17] light of the sun that projection will be
[24:19] an image that's very been very carefully
[24:22] engraved in the surface of that
[24:24] reflector
[24:25] right that there was something when that
[24:27] thing was made when when god when god
[24:30] made a christian when god made the
[24:31] reflector there was a hidden image
[24:33] engraved and this particular one that
[24:35] they found in chicago by the way these
[24:37] are very rare um the chinese
[24:40] right the china only has like nine of
[24:42] them and they're considered national
[24:44] treasures every single one of them so
[24:45] the fact that they found one in chicago
[24:47] was kind of crazy but
[24:49] when this one they found in chicago the
[24:50] thing that it projected was the buddha
[24:53] right it was an image of the buddha
[24:54] their deity
[24:55] and so
[24:56] within people and it just so struck me
[24:58] like praise the lord we're reflectors
[25:01] with an image of deity inscribed in us
[25:02] that the world can't see it looks
[25:04] everybody is a reflector ever even the
[25:06] peop you know
[25:07] every every human reflects the things
[25:09] that you that you
[25:11] uh that you're around you know
[25:13] the uh in proverbs you know talks about
[25:15] as as face anthros answer his face in a
[25:17] pool of water so does the heart of man
[25:20] to man
[25:21] the people that are around you are you
[25:23] reflect those spirits of the people
[25:25] around you and everyone's a reflector
[25:29] and so there's lots of mirrors there's
[25:31] lots of mirrors but there's only
[25:33] some that have that image of deity
[25:34] hidden inside of them that it once they
[25:36] get in the light of the sun they'll
[25:37] reflect the image of deity
[25:39] right and so but the key here is that
[25:43] everybody has to make sure that you're
[25:44] in that light of the sun and that you're
[25:46] clean and not covered in dirt
[25:49] you know that your life stays pure and
[25:51] that you stay in connection with that
[25:52] with that sun
[25:54] and uh
[25:55] that's uh that's it for today we'll
[25:57] stand and have a word of prayer
[26:02] father we
[26:03] thank you for this little word that
[26:04] you've given us father asked you would
[26:06] and allow it to speak to the people and
[26:07] help them through the through their
[26:09] through their
[26:10] coming weeks and days and months
[26:12] that it would help somebody father
[26:15] and that they would be able to shine
[26:16] that light unto the people around them
[26:18] that that some
[26:20] some lost seed out there that's longing
[26:22] for you would have that light strike
[26:24] across that seat and bring it to life
[26:26] father that some someone would would
[26:29] take these words and maybe it would
[26:30] encourage them to just to not be a lazy
[26:32] light keeper and keep their their
[26:34] mirrors and reflectors polished that the
[26:36] the word not of any what light that we
[26:38] would have but that
[26:40] the light that you pre shine forth would
[26:42] reflect off of us and and encourage
[26:45] somebody else father we ask these things
[26:46] in your holy name of the lord jesus
[26:48] christ amen
[27:12] do
[27:21] [Music]
[28:15] [Music]
[28:22] do
[28:24] [Music]
