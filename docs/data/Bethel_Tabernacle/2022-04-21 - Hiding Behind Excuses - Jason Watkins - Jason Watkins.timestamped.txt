[42:08] them with a great slaughter at gibeon
[42:11] and chased them along the way that goeth
[42:14] up to beth iran and smote them uh to
[42:18] asaka and to makeda
[42:20] and it came to pass as they fled from
[42:22] before israel
[42:24] and were in the going down to beth heron
[42:27] that the lord cast great cast down great
[42:31] stones from heaven upon them in asga and
[42:34] they died there were more which died
[42:37] with hailstones than they whom the
[42:39] children of israel slew with the sword
[42:42] then spake joshua to the lord in the day
[42:45] when the lord delivered up the amorites
[42:47] before the children of israel and he set
[42:50] in the sight of israel's son
[42:52] stand thou still upon gibeon and thou
[42:55] moon in the valley of agilent and the
[42:58] sun stood still in the moon state until
[43:00] the people had avenged themselves upon
[43:02] their enemies is not this written in the
[43:04] book of jasher
[43:06] so the sun stood still in the midst of
[43:08] heaven and hastened not to go down about
[43:10] a whole day and there was no day like
[43:13] that before it or after it that the lord
[43:17] hearkened unto the voice of a man for
[43:19] the lord fought for israel
[43:22] and joshua returned and all israel with
[43:24] him unto the camp to gilgal
[43:27] but these five kings fled and hid
[43:30] themselves in the caves of makita
[43:33] and it was told joshua's saying the five
[43:35] kings are found hid in the cave of
[43:37] makeda and joshua said roll great stones
[43:40] upon the mouth of the cave and set men
[43:43] by it for to keep them
[43:45] and stay ye not but pursue after your
[43:48] enemies and smite behind most of them
[43:51] suffer them not to enter into their
[43:52] cities for the lord your god hath
[43:55] delivered them into your hand
[43:56] and it came to pass when joshua and the
[43:58] children of israel had made an end of
[44:00] slaying them with a very great slaughter
[44:02] till they were consumed that the rest
[44:04] which remained of them entered into
[44:06] fenced cities and all the people
[44:08] returned to the camp to joshua at makeda
[44:11] in peace none moved his tongue against
[44:13] any of the children of israel
[44:16] then said joshua open the mouth of the
[44:18] cave and bring out those five kings unto
[44:21] me out of the cave and they did so and
[44:24] brought forth those five kings unto him
[44:26] out of the cave and the king of
[44:28] jerusalem the king of hebron the king of
[44:30] jarmoth the king of lakish and the king
[44:32] of eglon and it came to pass when they
[44:34] brought out those kings unto joshua that
[44:37] joshua called for all the men of israel
[44:40] and said unto the captains of the men of
[44:42] war which went with him
[44:44] come near and put your feet upon the
[44:47] necks of these kings and they came near
[44:50] and put their feet upon the necks of
[44:52] them and joshua said unto them fear not
[44:56] nor be dismayed be strong and of a good
[44:58] courage for thus shall the lord do to
[45:01] all your enemies against whom you fight
[45:05] and afterward joshua smote them and slew
[45:08] them and hang them on five trees and
[45:10] they were hanging upon the trees until
[45:13] the evening
[45:14] and it came to pass at the time of the
[45:16] going down of the sun that joshua
[45:17] commanded and they took them down off
[45:20] the trees
[45:21] cast them into the cave wherein they had
[45:23] been hid and laid great stones in the
[45:25] cave's mouth which remain unto this very
[45:28] day

[45:32] hands for service just now and i pray

[46:51] all right praise the lord
[46:54] i want to by the help of the lord
[46:57] speak to you this evening
[46:59] on a title that i'm going to take hiding
[47:02] behind excuses
[47:06] hiding behind
[47:08] excuses it was quite a challenge that
[47:12] the lord
[47:13] gave to joshua
[47:15] and
[47:16] it required joshua to believe it i i
[47:19] don't think that
[47:20] there was any
[47:22] notion in god's mind that when he said
[47:24] to joshua
[47:26] i'm going to give you a complete victory
[47:28] and
[47:29] go take off go get them don't be afraid
[47:33] not at all don't have any fear for i
[47:36] have delivered them into your hand thank
[47:38] you sir and there shall not even a man
[47:41] stand before you you know why you don't
[47:44] read in the text anywhere where joshua
[47:47] begins to say well you know lord
[47:50] thank you but now you know could i have
[47:52] a a sign from heaven or could i have
[47:54] this or could i have that and are you
[47:56] sure maybe we should go forth a little
[47:58] more carefully the bible says joshua
[48:00] went quickly he rapidly closed on him he
[48:03] didn't he didn't he didn't play around
[48:05] you can tell
[48:06] that joshua was not interested
[48:10] in waiting he was not interested in
[48:13] reasoning he was not interested in you
[48:15] know military tactics it didn't say well
[48:18] you know we'll we'll do this we'll do
[48:19] that we'll do this with that and then
[48:21] we'll we'll get an upper hand on them
[48:23] you know joshua had already done some
[48:25] fighting joshua had already met the
[48:27] captain of the lord's souls joshua
[48:28] already knew what would cause failure he
[48:31] had already cleansed the camp of that
[48:33] failure when joshua goes into this
[48:35] battle you know he's he had learned a
[48:38] hard lesson
[48:40] of why they were here because it was the
[48:42] gibeonites who had who had deceived him
[48:45] and come like as if they'd come from a
[48:47] far country you remember the story and
[48:49] we become from a far country and you
[48:51] know we want a treaty with you and
[48:53] joshua made it and then suddenly when
[48:55] all the other five kings of the amorites
[48:57] heard about that you know if we'd have
[48:59] backed up and started from the beginning
[49:00] of the chapter you read how that they
[49:02] had a war council of these you know this
[49:04] league of nations and they said you know
[49:07] gibeon is in is in cahoots with them
[49:10] let's go let's go smash them and so now
[49:13] gibeon sends to joshua and says now we
[49:16] made a deal and uh yeah we kind of
[49:19] deceived you but you made the deal
[49:21] because joshua didn't really consult the
[49:23] lord and so you know joshua learned i
[49:26] i'm glad i like to think that i learn
[49:29] from my mistakes i i like to think that
[49:32] when i strip up and stumble then i say
[49:34] lord i'm not going to do that again and
[49:36] i'll be i'll be on the lookout next time
[49:38] for the enemy you know i i've said many
[49:41] years that mistakes you know are are are
[49:44] okay we learn by mistakes there were
[49:47] times when
[49:48] even in raising children and
[49:50] and i i would allow sometimes
[49:55] one of my children even if i knew it was
[49:57] making a mistake
[49:59] as long as i knew i could recover him
[50:01] and bail him out and i'd let him i'd let
[50:03] him go into that knowing it was gonna
[50:05] blow up and it would just my experience
[50:08] not that i was smarter than any of them
[50:10] but my experience told me that's that's
[50:12] going to that's not going to end well
[50:14] and then it would it get in a situation
[50:16] i'd come and say now son here's a
[50:18] teachable moment now just remember next
[50:20] time when you see that you see mistakes
[50:22] aren't so bad as long as you learn from
[50:24] them and don't repeat them
[50:27] but it was you know it's constantly
[50:28] israel was constantly and not just
[50:31] israel you know the old saying is that
[50:33] mankind is is constantly he never learns
[50:36] from history he's doomed to repeat it
[50:38] and repeat it and repeat it because he
[50:39] never learns from it and i i you know
[50:41] god gave us this bible as examples and
[50:45] paul said it's for our examples
[50:47] these people made mistakes so you don't
[50:49] have to
[50:50] you can actually learn how to run a
[50:53] family how to run a business how to run
[50:56] your life how to keep a testimony above
[50:59] above above ridicule how to
[51:01] how to be an honorable person my wife
[51:04] and i were commenting the other day in a
[51:05] little discussion i said you know it
[51:08] just goes to show you that that the
[51:10] bible really does it really is an
[51:13] instruction book for living
[51:15] and if people would just live by the
[51:17] standards of the bible the bible knows
[51:19] how you should run your life
[51:21] the bible is filled with knowledge and
[51:24] and and and people who who don't study
[51:27] it and don't read it and don't memorize
[51:29] it and don't practice what it what it
[51:31] preaches to you well then you know
[51:33] you're you're just going to be up
[51:35] against it that's all i can tell you but
[51:37] you know i'm not saying that that you
[51:39] know the christian life is a life of
[51:41] ease and fact is you make yourself a
[51:43] target but i've told you again and again
[51:46] i've said it and so say i again we don't
[51:49] live by the mercies of lucifer
[51:52] we know we shouldn't worry about that
[51:54] you should just say i'm going to
[51:56] fearlessly keep the word of god and when
[51:58] the enemy comes i'm going to advance
[52:01] upon him quickly i'm not going to
[52:03] when i see something uh a seat of
[52:06] discrepancy in my life or in my home you
[52:09] should be ready to take the sword of the
[52:11] word you should be ready just to cut it
[52:14] out of your life it ought not to be that
[52:16] god has to beat us to death
[52:19] to get us to learn a lesson and ought
[52:22] not to be
[52:23] a heavenly father will continue to
[52:25] chastise you until you learn the lesson
[52:27] but it but that's not that's never his
[52:29] desire his desire is that you learn it
[52:32] his desire is that you put it into
[52:34] practice and that you you you you you
[52:37] organize your life according to the word
[52:40] of god there is nothing like the word of
[52:41] god
[52:43] for organizing your life
[52:47] i wonder how joshua and you know
[52:50] the the the name joshua is the same as
[52:53] jesus and
[52:55] so you know when you're when you're
[52:56] seeing joshua here you can just think of
[52:58] the lord yourself and of christ but
[53:01] because that's the that's the uh the
[53:03] type the shadow that's the um
[53:06] that's the imagery the bible imagery
[53:08] it's showing and i i wonder how joshua
[53:11] would have reacted
[53:14] if those leaders
[53:16] would have shrank
[53:17] from the challenge of the moment
[53:21] joshua said now i want you captains of
[53:23] war
[53:25] you you've had a great victory today and
[53:28] the lord fought for you and in fact he
[53:30] killed more enemy than you did
[53:32] but now i want you to i want i want you
[53:35] to fully maximize
[53:38] what it is that happened here today this
[53:40] was more than just a fight
[53:43] this was more than god's showing you you
[53:45] know i i i'll save you you know when
[53:48] you're in a burning house i'll come in
[53:49] and pull you out don't worry no this was
[53:51] going to be more than that god was
[53:53] wanting to make this a teachable moment
[53:56] to say what you've seen today i can do
[53:59] that every time
[54:02] if you will obey me and you'll believe
[54:04] me and you'll put my commandments into
[54:08] practice then then this result you saw
[54:11] today will be the same result tomorrow
[54:14] and next year and it won't matter
[54:16] whether it's five kings or fifty kings
[54:19] or five hundred kings you'll not lose a
[54:22] man the son will even stand still and
[54:25] the heavens will back you
[54:31] so i wonder how it would have made him
[54:33] feel at such a
[54:35] monumental moment in jewish history
[54:38] to say come out here i want you to i
[54:40] want we're going to complete some
[54:41] imagery here we're going to show the
[54:43] devil something
[54:45] we're going to put fear in the enemy i
[54:47] want you to put your feet
[54:50] on the necks of these five kings these
[54:52] men who set on thrones and wielded
[54:54] scepters and thought they were better
[54:55] than you
[54:57] these people who would have slain you
[55:00] and your wife and your little ones and
[55:03] now today they're they're they were
[55:06] hiding from you and they're in they were
[55:08] in a cave we brought them out they're
[55:09] laying on the ground i want you to come
[55:10] and put your foot on their neck
[55:14] see
[55:16] i mean when we
[55:18] you know i had some notes i wasn't sure
[55:20] i'd get to them i think i'll jump ahead
[55:21] and just because just for the sake of
[55:23] you understanding uh the meaning in the
[55:26] verse
[55:28] because it's relevant when you
[55:30] when you look at joshua saying therefore
[55:33] you know uh
[55:35] those kings on uh he says here and it
[55:38] came to pass verse 24 when they brought
[55:40] out those kings unto joshua the joshua
[55:42] called for all the men of israel and
[55:44] said unto the captains of the men of war
[55:45] which went with him come near don't stay
[55:48] back
[55:49] come near
[55:50] put your feet on the necks of these
[55:51] kings and they came near and put their
[55:54] feet upon the necks of them because now
[55:56] this is exactly
[55:58] you know what what was going to become
[56:00] the standard
[56:02] in fact as david would write about it in
[56:05] psalms 110 the lord said unto my lord
[56:09] sit thou at my right hand until i make
[56:12] thine enemies thy footstool and that's
[56:15] exactly what these kings had become they
[56:18] had become the footstool
[56:21] of these mighty men of war put your foot
[56:23] on the necks
[56:25] is literally making them your footstool
[56:27] joshua you notice that joshua
[56:30] actually joshua didn't do it it was his
[56:32] subjects that did it
[56:34] see
[56:35] joshua's christ
[56:37] just like our lord jesus he's already
[56:40] bruised the head of satan he's already
[56:43] made him his footstool i'm here to tell
[56:46] you but he wants you to make the enemy
[56:49] your footstool
[56:51] he goes on in psalms 110 it's one
[56:54] through five
[56:56] the lord said unto my lord set out my
[56:57] right hand until i make thine enemies
[56:59] thy footstool verse 2 the lord shall
[57:01] send the rod of thy strength out of zion
[57:06] rule thou in the midst of thine enemies
[57:08] what a statement
[57:10] you're to rule
[57:12] not at distance
[57:14] in the midst of your enemies
[57:18] thy people shall be willing
[57:21] in the day of thy power
[57:23] in the beauties of holiness from the
[57:25] womb of the morning
[57:27] thou hast the dew of thy youth the lord
[57:30] now this is what's so beautiful this is
[57:32] what paul picks up the lord hath sworn
[57:35] and will not repent thou art a priest
[57:37] forever after the order of melchizedek
[57:41] the lord at thy right hand shall strike
[57:44] through kings in the day of his wrath
[57:46] i'm here to tell you that that is a that
[57:49] is a sign to us because a greater than
[57:52] than solomon is here and even uh
[57:55] we had melchizedek but now there's a
[57:57] greater than melchizedek and you're
[57:59] living in the time when the bride has
[58:02] become the full image of the word of god
[58:04] and you're to have your feet on the neck
[58:06] the is to be under your feet
[58:10] if there was ever a time when god was
[58:12] going to prove his supremacy of his word
[58:15] it's in you and it's happening right now
[58:22] so then it begs the question
[58:24] i'm sure you would agree
[58:27] i wonder how joshua then would have
[58:29] reacted
[58:31] if those leaders had shrank from such a
[58:33] challenge because of challenge it was
[58:37] you know i have found too many times and
[58:39] i know you won't disagree with this
[58:40] because we're all human beings and
[58:43] we know the tendencies of human nature
[58:47] i found too many times a tendency in
[58:50] people
[58:50] and when i say people
[58:52] please just remember this sermon burned
[58:55] holes in me before i'm using it to burn
[58:57] holes in you
[58:59] will you
[59:00] go with me
[59:04] i found too many times a tendency let's
[59:07] just say in us
[59:09] to offer very
[59:12] convincing excuses
[59:15] for failing to meet expectations
[59:19] divine opportunities
[59:23] achievements that we could achieve
[59:26] in christ
[59:28] you know when
[59:30] potential and a noble purpose
[59:33] runs high
[59:35] but performance runs very low
[59:39] people tend to shield themselves quickly
[59:42] they will shield themselves with every
[59:44] kind of excuse
[59:49] reasons why
[59:51] we couldn't meet the challenge of the
[59:53] hour
[59:54] you know even even when fully
[59:56] provisioned
[59:58] amen
[59:59] yeah i mean you know even when fully
[1:00:01] equipped to do so i'm here to tell you
[1:00:03] we're not unprovisioned
[1:00:05] god has given us a word in this hour
[1:00:07] there is no excuse i know we offer them
[1:00:10] but they don't hold water there is a
[1:00:13] challenge of this hour in the time of
[1:00:15] melchizedek to put your feet upon the
[1:00:18] neck of the enemy and put him under your
[1:00:20] feet
[1:00:22] god's not interested in your
[1:00:26] excuses what excuse would you give to
[1:00:29] god to hold unforgiveness
[1:00:33] an unpardonable sin
[1:00:35] one of two
[1:00:36] unpardonable sins
[1:00:39] to blaspheme the holy ghost and to
[1:00:40] refuse to forgive
[1:00:42] they're both unpardonable you can't get
[1:00:44] past that jesus said if you will not
[1:00:46] forgive
[1:00:48] someone their trespasses your heavenly
[1:00:50] father will not forgive your trespasses
[1:00:54] how is it that that we would
[1:00:57] think to hold
[1:00:59] you know feelings against a brother or a
[1:01:01] sister or even even feelings against
[1:01:03] anybody anybody brother branham talks
[1:01:05] about how that we know we're not even
[1:01:07] from here we're we're aliens one of the
[1:01:09] citizens of here that the people who are
[1:01:12] citizens here uh of here and this is the
[1:01:13] only life they'll they'll ever have
[1:01:15] brother branham said let them cut in
[1:01:16] front of you in line
[1:01:18] go ahead and take the back go ahead get
[1:01:20] at the back of the line let people ahead
[1:01:22] of you it's the rights
[1:01:25] i i don't have citizen rights here i'm
[1:01:27] not from here
[1:01:29] i'm a citizen of another world
[1:01:32] amen
[1:01:33] and and and we're always sometimes we we
[1:01:35] get in that same vein of of people's
[1:01:38] rights that's laodicea
[1:01:40] and you know nobody's gonna you know
[1:01:43] take my rights away from me what rights
[1:01:45] uh brother bannon says you've got all
[1:01:47] kinds of rights but a sheep surrenders
[1:01:49] its rights
[1:01:53] you know what would we how would we hold
[1:01:56] since we forgive in christ
[1:01:59] i mean how would you
[1:02:02] not forgive if you're a christian
[1:02:05] considering what christ forgave you of
[1:02:08] considering that god
[1:02:10] god swapped the completely guilty for
[1:02:14] the he said he swapped the the the the
[1:02:17] innocent the completely innocent for the
[1:02:19] totally guilty
[1:02:21] jesus was completely innocent
[1:02:24] and the bible says
[1:02:26] the bible says consider him
[1:02:29] who endured such contradiction of
[1:02:31] sinners against himself lest you be
[1:02:33] weird in your mind and faint
[1:02:35] you haven't yet suffered unto blood
[1:02:38] my goodness
[1:02:40] i'm sorry somebody stepped you know in
[1:02:42] front of you i'm sorry you broke a
[1:02:43] fingernail
[1:02:46] and that's about that you're you're your
[1:02:48] worst your worst uh thing con
[1:02:51] considering what you're headed to
[1:02:54] considering the world that's so
[1:02:55] wonderful that no trial here will even
[1:02:58] be thought of
[1:03:00] it's nothing more than a broken finger
[1:03:02] now goodness
[1:03:04] see
[1:03:09] so when a noble purpose when a very high
[1:03:12] purpose
[1:03:14] a very great challenge is put forth but
[1:03:17] you know performance is low we
[1:03:20] we tend to shield ourselves with excuses
[1:03:22] reasons
[1:03:25] why we couldn't meet the challenge even
[1:03:27] when
[1:03:28] fully provisioned to do so right away we
[1:03:31] give ourselves a pass
[1:03:34] amen
[1:03:35] it's the truth
[1:03:37] it's the truth
[1:03:38] i had to stand in the mirror for for
[1:03:40] today's wednesday i've had to stand in
[1:03:41] the mirror for three days and go amen
[1:03:48] we tend friends
[1:03:50] what we end up doing is we insulate
[1:03:52] ourselves from blame
[1:03:55] we tend and here's here's how it
[1:03:57] generally goes
[1:03:58] we we diminish responsibility
[1:04:01] you know that that we're facing or a
[1:04:04] responsibility that we're charged with
[1:04:06] by god we tell ourselves that it's okay
[1:04:09] it's not really that big of a deal we
[1:04:12] really don't need to worry too much
[1:04:14] about it you know this happens
[1:04:17] that tendency
[1:04:19] is bad enough just in and of itself
[1:04:23] but it becomes very
[1:04:25] bad when
[1:04:26] this this happens to be
[1:04:28] you know when when we face the
[1:04:30] challenges of the word of god
[1:04:33] that challenge us to excel
[1:04:37] and the word of god calls on you in this
[1:04:39] day and this hour to excel
[1:04:42] to be spiritually minded to cast down
[1:04:45] vain imaginations and this is the age
[1:04:47] where we got a lot to cast down
[1:04:49] it tells you to be strong in faith be
[1:04:51] vigilant be ready for a fight
[1:04:54] beast be spiritual pray read your bible
[1:04:57] attend the house of god
[1:05:00] and people have diminished that
[1:05:03] i'll tell you something friends i'm i i
[1:05:06] i love the
[1:05:08] the
[1:05:10] you know i love the brothers and all the
[1:05:12] efforts they're doing and the equipment
[1:05:14] to you know to give the audience
[1:05:17] streaming and uh a very good high
[1:05:19] quality i believe in professionalism
[1:05:22] don't get me wrong but
[1:05:24] you know we're not we're not after a
[1:05:26] marketing campaign
[1:05:28] not after a marketing campaign i i don't
[1:05:30] want to make it too comfortable
[1:05:32] i don't want to make it too good
[1:05:35] i you know i i i don't want to make it
[1:05:37] to where people can just be comfortable
[1:05:39] no believer should be comfortable never
[1:05:43] attending the house of god
[1:05:45] [Music]
[1:05:47] in some cases it's impossible i
[1:05:49] understand
[1:05:50] that i'm just saying that there should
[1:05:52] never be a comfortableness in your heart
[1:05:54] you should always be asking the lord
[1:05:55] help me to be part of a live assembly
[1:05:59] if i got it if i gotta change a job then
[1:06:02] change it if i gotta lose a career then
[1:06:05] lose it
[1:06:06] and let god give you the career you need
[1:06:09] let's let god add to the church daily
[1:06:13] such as he will
[1:06:15] not interested in marketing trying to
[1:06:16] gain members here i love the vision of
[1:06:18] everything i'm part of it i push it as
[1:06:20] hard as anybody but let's just remember
[1:06:23] that's my message to my brethren
[1:06:25] to just remember brothers it's not we're
[1:06:27] not a denomination
[1:06:33] see and so
[1:06:37] we we find ourselves to where
[1:06:40] when we receive challenges in the word
[1:06:43] of god challenges in this dark day
[1:06:45] challenges to be a light
[1:06:48] challenge is to shine with holiness
[1:06:51] we minimalize it
[1:06:53] it's not that big of a deal
[1:06:56] well brother branham said well okay but
[1:06:58] brother ham said a lot of things
[1:07:01] you know i mean he's just a man right
[1:07:04] you do know he made a few mistakes right
[1:07:07] well since i don't know but only one man
[1:07:09] who didn't yeah
[1:07:13] see thank god i that doesn't hinder me
[1:07:16] that helps me because then i say man
[1:07:17] i've got a chance then
[1:07:19] amen see
[1:07:22] and so
[1:07:24] we we tell ourselves it's okay we we
[1:07:27] diminish
[1:07:28] the responsibility
[1:07:30] in our own minds that we're facing or
[1:07:33] something that we're
[1:07:35] charged with
[1:07:36] i mean even when the cost of failing is
[1:07:39] high
[1:07:42] even when the
[1:07:44] cost of failing
[1:07:46] can have long lasting
[1:07:49] far-reaching consequences
[1:07:52] harmful neglects
[1:07:54] to our own selves and
[1:07:57] or even harmful neglects to those who we
[1:08:00] love most or claim to
[1:08:02] or should
[1:08:05] it's in human nature friends and you
[1:08:07] need to
[1:08:08] know the enemy
[1:08:11] see
[1:08:12] and you're more you're more of an enemy
[1:08:14] to you than lucifer is amen
[1:08:18] because lucifer can't keep you
[1:08:20] out of the glories of god but you can
[1:08:22] limit your glories see
[1:08:24] you can hinder the holy spirit's work
[1:08:27] that satan can't hinder the holy spirit
[1:08:29] but you can
[1:08:31] satan's never been able to stop the lord
[1:08:32] but you actually can
[1:08:34] see you're his children bill that's why
[1:08:36] the bible says let the mind which was in
[1:08:38] christ be in you you have to allow that
[1:08:40] you have to permit that thing he's not a
[1:08:42] he doesn't want a robot he's not going
[1:08:44] to force himself on you we've been given
[1:08:46] a great challenge in this uh in this
[1:08:47] hour and i'm here to tell you friends
[1:08:49] you know it as well as i know it we are
[1:08:51] in a day where everybody has an excuse
[1:08:53] and nobody takes blame and nobody takes
[1:08:55] responsibility and it's always somebody
[1:08:57] else's fault
[1:08:59] it doesn't even matter what happens
[1:09:01] nobody goes to jail nobody gets fined
[1:09:03] nobody uh you know the banks do this and
[1:09:06] the mortgages do this and the government
[1:09:07] does this and everybody rants and raves
[1:09:09] and social media lights up and people
[1:09:11] beat on the desk something's got to be
[1:09:12] done at the end of the day nothing gets
[1:09:14] done
[1:09:21] remember brother branham had to
[1:09:24] in his
[1:09:25] in in that spiritual dream about herding
[1:09:28] cattle and remember he's with um brother
[1:09:30] welch evans i believe if memory serves
[1:09:32] and they're driving cattle up one side
[1:09:34] of a river
[1:09:36] and it's very rough on this side the
[1:09:38] other side's very very smooth
[1:09:41] and brother branham says do i believe
[1:09:43] it's brother evans he says now brother
[1:09:44] evans you keep pushing you keep pushing
[1:09:47] them but i'm going to spur my horse and
[1:09:50] i'm going to ride i'm going to gallop
[1:09:51] ahead at a hard and a hard ride because
[1:09:54] up the way there's a crossing and if i
[1:09:56] don't get there to block these cattle
[1:09:58] they'll immediately cross over to that
[1:10:00] smooth side and that's not what we want
[1:10:03] we will never reach the destination if
[1:10:05] we go up the left side you can't get all
[1:10:07] the way there you've got to stay on the
[1:10:08] right side but because the right side
[1:10:10] was rough and hard it was a harder way
[1:10:13] and the cattle wouldn't naturally choose
[1:10:15] it
[1:10:16] see
[1:10:17] and so i'm not saying you're a horrible
[1:10:19] person i'm saying you're a human being
[1:10:21] but know thy enemy
[1:10:23] and understand that these principles in
[1:10:26] god's word are written here for a reason
[1:10:28] and we need to have courage today to say
[1:10:30] enough excuses i'm going to be a
[1:10:33] spiritual person
[1:10:35] i'm not going to be carnal why because i
[1:10:37] said so because god doesn't want me to
[1:10:40] be
[1:10:41] i'm going to bring my home under the
[1:10:43] guidance of the holy spirit i want my
[1:10:45] marriage i want my children i want the
[1:10:47] church i want the atmosphere to be
[1:10:50] charged to be a place where god can move
[1:10:54] it's not hindered
[1:11:02] we can know it would be
[1:11:04] a good thing
[1:11:08] but
[1:11:09] we also know there's a cost
[1:11:11] and when cost is involved where the
[1:11:13] excuses fly
[1:11:19] excuse as a noun
[1:11:22] is a reason
[1:11:24] or explanation
[1:11:26] put forward
[1:11:28] to defend or justify a fault
[1:11:31] or an offense
[1:11:34] there are a lot of excuses we use
[1:11:39] when we give ourselves a pass
[1:11:42] for not living strong spiritual
[1:11:44] lifestyles
[1:11:48] we offer ourselves and we offer god a
[1:11:50] lot of explanation
[1:11:53] to defend or justify that fault
[1:11:56] and i'm you know i'm not sure
[1:11:58] i thought about this i thought you know
[1:12:00] i i'm not sure
[1:12:02] who we offer uh the the most excuses to
[1:12:05] when we fail
[1:12:06] to uh to attain the victories that
[1:12:09] christ
[1:12:10] secured for us he secured a lot of
[1:12:12] victories
[1:12:13] i'm not i'm not really sure at times you
[1:12:15] know who it is we're trying to convince
[1:12:17] more do we do we try to convince god
[1:12:20] more or ourselves i i certainly know who
[1:12:24] who accepts uh our explanations more uh
[1:12:28] between you know between me and the lord
[1:12:30] and i'll give you a clue it ain't the
[1:12:33] lord
[1:12:36] okay
[1:12:38] i give myself excuses i give him excuses
[1:12:41] and i'm not sure who i give the most
[1:12:43] excuses to but i i for sure know which
[1:12:45] one accepts them the most and it ain't
[1:12:47] the lord
[1:12:51] an excuse
[1:12:53] excuses and
[1:12:55] and and passes
[1:12:58] you know that we give ourselves to to
[1:13:00] have carnality in our lives i want to
[1:13:02] tell you something friends carnality in
[1:13:03] your lives is a big ticket item
[1:13:07] it's not a small thing you can't imagine
[1:13:10] what a hindrance
[1:13:11] what what victories you could have and
[1:13:15] what achievements you could achieve for
[1:13:17] the kingdom of god i know it might be at
[1:13:20] a cost but i'm here to tell you the
[1:13:22] reward is out of this world
[1:13:24] hallelujah
[1:13:26] there's nothing so satisfying when you
[1:13:29] lay your head on your pillow at night
[1:13:31] and try to drift off to sleep and you
[1:13:33] can close your eyes and know that you
[1:13:35] are walking pleasing to the lord walking
[1:13:38] in his will walking in his statutes
[1:13:41] raise up in the morning open your eyes
[1:13:43] to a sunlit room and say good morning
[1:13:45] father what do you have on the tap for
[1:13:47] me today
[1:13:49] and know that your feet are going to hit
[1:13:51] the ground in the name of jesus christ
[1:13:53] and you're going to go forward
[1:13:54] conquering it in victory you're going to
[1:13:56] put your foot
[1:13:57] and people are going to see it
[1:13:59] on the neck of the enemy
[1:14:06] in fact friends i'm here to tell you
[1:14:08] that
[1:14:10] you know we almost always unfortunately
[1:14:12] we almost always
[1:14:14] accept our own excuses for carnality
[1:14:18] we
[1:14:20] come on on it
[1:14:22] come on holy people
[1:14:24] own it
[1:14:25] we accept our own excuses for carnality
[1:14:27] so easy
[1:14:29] see
[1:14:34] who's who's more
[1:14:36] you know
[1:14:38] i know which one is the easiest to
[1:14:40] persuade in it and again it ain't the
[1:14:41] lord
[1:14:43] in fact i don't think god accepts
[1:14:45] our feeble excuses at all
[1:14:49] not even a little bit
[1:14:53] you know brother branham tells a story
[1:14:55] and i i had some quotes i was going to
[1:14:57] read but i'm just trying to save time
[1:14:58] tonight
[1:15:01] brother branham starts telling a story
[1:15:03] about a man
[1:15:05] who was very sick and he was dying and
[1:15:07] laying on his deathbed and
[1:15:09] brother branham was there in the home
[1:15:11] and
[1:15:14] trying to offer some comfort and
[1:15:17] the wife was sitting there in the
[1:15:19] children and
[1:15:21] you know and and
[1:15:22] and and the lady was you know pleading
[1:15:24] brother branham isn't there
[1:15:26] there's something you can do well sister
[1:15:28] you know we've
[1:15:29] we've prayed we we're asking the lord
[1:15:31] let's just let's just you know let's
[1:15:33] just keep keep calm and
[1:15:35] and and you know and she's just this is
[1:15:38] her husband this is i mean if he dies
[1:15:40] this is catastrophic for their family
[1:15:42] this isn't a small thing
[1:15:44] i mean life is on the line and it's
[1:15:47] going to have a reverberating
[1:15:48] trickle-down effect to the wife and to
[1:15:50] the children for decades
[1:15:54] this isn't little
[1:15:56] and brother branham is just you know
[1:15:58] trying to give her a few words of
[1:15:59] comfort trying to encourage her faith
[1:16:02] and and she's pressing god's prophet
[1:16:05] pressing him you know i need more than i
[1:16:07] need more of an answer isn't there
[1:16:09] something that can be done and brother
[1:16:11] branham just he kind of says now you
[1:16:13] know sister look he says i you know i
[1:16:15] know where i know where this is going
[1:16:16] and he said now you see
[1:16:18] i mean i could do more but he would need
[1:16:21] to show me a vision now see if god would
[1:16:24] just show me a vision
[1:16:27] well
[1:16:28] then oh buddy let me tell you every
[1:16:32] devil would give way on that
[1:16:34] remember brother branham says if god
[1:16:36] told me george washington was going to
[1:16:38] raise from the dead tomorrow he said i'd
[1:16:40] invite the entire world to come see it
[1:16:44] because he'd never seen one of those
[1:16:45] visions fail
[1:16:47] but he got comfortable
[1:16:49] you're not going to throw something at
[1:16:50] me are you
[1:16:52] brother i'm not comfortable in that
[1:16:54] he's he's admitting he's owning it in
[1:16:55] this story you can go read it yourself
[1:16:58] and he says but you know if he would
[1:16:59] just show me a vision
[1:17:01] uh then then you know it could mean a
[1:17:03] lot more then we could go in there in
[1:17:04] the name of the lord and that be the end
[1:17:05] of it and brother branham you know well
[1:17:07] sister we'll keep praying god bless you
[1:17:09] have a nice wonderful day god be god
[1:17:11] richly bless you god be with you till we
[1:17:12] meet again and out the door he goes and
[1:17:14] he goes home and he's sitting there and
[1:17:15] he's in his study and he's thinking
[1:17:16] about that and the holy spirit starts
[1:17:18] turning screws on him
[1:17:20] and says what about my word
[1:17:25] why why are you waiting on a vision for
[1:17:28] why do you not have the exact same faith
[1:17:31] just because i said it
[1:17:34] just because many times
[1:17:37] as you've seen me move
[1:17:39] and keep these words
[1:17:41] and you've never seen me lose a battle
[1:17:44] and i've stood with you all these years
[1:17:46] and the best thing you can tell this
[1:17:48] woman
[1:17:49] is you need a vision
[1:17:52] amen
[1:17:53] what about the fact that
[1:17:55] by his stripes you are healed already
[1:17:59] what about the fact that if you say to
[1:18:01] this mountain what about the fact that
[1:18:03] if you ask anything in my name and don't
[1:18:05] doubt it in your heart
[1:18:07] and brother branham he realized it oh
[1:18:09] he'd been rebuked by the holy spirit the
[1:18:11] holy spirit didn't come and say billy
[1:18:13] you did a really nice job i want to pat
[1:18:15] you and commend you for comforting that
[1:18:17] sister lord send him back down the road
[1:18:19] go back
[1:18:20] stop giving excuses that was nothing but
[1:18:23] an excuse because you are afraid to
[1:18:25] believe my word and brother branham had
[1:18:27] to repent for it and then god come on
[1:18:29] the scene and healed the man
[1:18:31] no vision just based on the word
[1:18:34] see
[1:18:36] so a lot of times friends i i tell you
[1:18:38] that story not to ridicule
[1:18:40] our dear prophet but but to but to get
[1:18:43] you to understand that this thing can
[1:18:46] happen even to god's most faithful
[1:18:48] servants
[1:18:50] i'm glad it never happened to the lord
[1:18:51] jesus
[1:18:53] i love that quote brother matt read here
[1:18:55] i think he read it here in church read
[1:18:57] it in the men's breakfast and how that
[1:18:59] you know satan had been used to used to
[1:19:01] defeating god's champions and how he
[1:19:03] defeated you know defeated abraham got
[1:19:05] him lying and defeated moses and got him
[1:19:07] with a temper and defeated david he got
[1:19:08] him into this said but when he jumped on
[1:19:10] jesus that was a 5 000 watt vote and
[1:19:13] said it
[1:19:14] singed his wings and he jumped back and
[1:19:16] he realized this ain't moses
[1:19:19] this is more than moses
[1:19:27] and so that didn't hold up in the
[1:19:29] in the face of god's complaint
[1:19:32] saying a prophet saying well lord if
[1:19:35] you'd have just given me a vision that
[1:19:36] didn't hold water
[1:19:38] god did not accept that excuse
[1:19:43] he he absolutely rejected that as
[1:19:46] worthless
[1:19:47] you should have believed my word and
[1:19:49] went back and prayed for that man based
[1:19:51] on faith in the word where's your faith
[1:19:54] see
[1:19:56] god wanted to know
[1:19:59] why he didn't just go based on the
[1:20:01] promise in his word brother branham
[1:20:03] comes to this story of standing in the
[1:20:06] gap
[1:20:08] and
[1:20:09] it's interesting and i'm running a
[1:20:11] little bit of risk to to read too much
[1:20:13] and i won't read too much but it's a
[1:20:15] familiar story to you
[1:20:22] brother branham says so i'm he's driving
[1:20:24] down the road and
[1:20:26] and he's he's he's he's hatched a plan
[1:20:30] he's burned out on people
[1:20:34] he developed a complex and wearied
[1:20:35] himself and
[1:20:37] you know let took rejection too
[1:20:39] personally
[1:20:40] and you know he
[1:20:42] he just finally he just wants to go be a
[1:20:44] trapper in the wilderness
[1:20:46] and he's literally going to give god
[1:20:48] every kind of logical sensible reason
[1:20:51] why he should be able to do it
[1:20:54] and he says you know and and god has
[1:20:56] warned him you know he says coming down
[1:20:58] home to arizona i was coming now into
[1:21:00] utah and as i got there coming down from
[1:21:02] the mountains about 20 miles out of the
[1:21:04] city
[1:21:05] said said as i've told you about the
[1:21:07] morning about the squirrels and all
[1:21:09] these things how somebody went to
[1:21:11] talking to me
[1:21:13] a voice just the same as you hear mine i
[1:21:15] know it sounds neurotically
[1:21:17] but as i've got through expressing have
[1:21:19] i ever told you anything that wasn't
[1:21:21] right a voice got to talking to me i was
[1:21:23] talking to him and it said carry out
[1:21:26] your plans

[1:21:39] a man that reminded him he and then he
[1:21:41] saw a vision of and and there was this
[1:21:44] there was this certain man in a dream
[1:21:46] he'd been an alcoholic and he was a bomb
[1:21:48] himself and and now brother branham said
[1:21:50] in the dream he said i was standing
[1:21:51] there in the cold and it was dark and he
[1:21:54] said oh brother branham i'll find a
[1:21:56] place for you to sleep and he's down in
[1:21:57] a ravine and he's trying to get a slick
[1:21:59] place and they're trying to build a fire
[1:22:01] to get warm and brother branham says i
[1:22:03] stood there and that and that dark icy
[1:22:05] air hit me in the face and he said i
[1:22:07] thought just
[1:22:09] i used to preach to thousands
[1:22:12] tens of thousands came to my meetings
[1:22:16] people flew from all over the world for
[1:22:18] five minutes of my time
[1:22:20] he said i've seen the dead raised and
[1:22:22] i've seen the lame walk in the blind sea
[1:22:24] and i've seen sinners million souls one
[1:22:26] to christ and he said think now
[1:22:29] i'm just a bum
[1:22:31] nobody wants me
[1:22:33] and god had told him
[1:22:35] carry out your plans
[1:22:38] you'll be like that bum
[1:22:41] and i said lord
[1:22:43] i don't want to be like that
[1:22:46] said your wife will go too
[1:22:48] she won't live up there in them hills
[1:22:50] like that
[1:22:51] now

[1:22:54] mita branham you're never going to find
[1:22:56] this is i can't even get my mind wrapped
[1:22:58] around this knowing sister mita
[1:23:00] and my you asked my sister gene this is
[1:23:02] this like what says to me to leave

[1:23:14] become a bomb just as the dream showed
[1:23:17] you you would
[1:23:18] i said i don't want to be that
[1:23:20] but i don't want to have to
[1:23:22] live like that i i want to do something
[1:23:24] different i you called me to be a
[1:23:26] prophet and i want to live in the
[1:23:27] wilderness like a prophet hear these
[1:23:29] excuses
[1:23:30] brother branham says but i was using my
[1:23:33] own excuse so i could hunt my own good
[1:23:36] see
[1:23:38] and he said but and the lord said but
[1:23:40] that was the prophets of the old
[1:23:42] testament you've been called to be there
[1:23:44] in a much higher office than that he
[1:23:45] said you have more gifts besides that he
[1:23:48] was called to pray for the sick and
[1:23:49] preach the gospel in the apostolic form
[1:23:52] and and have greater things and many
[1:23:54] great gifts he said why why do you wait
[1:23:57] for me to move you every time you move
[1:24:02] why do you wait here's god taking his
[1:24:04] prophet to task
[1:24:07] why do you wait for me to move you
[1:24:10] every time you move
[1:24:14] where is your reward
[1:24:16] he says then i seen it

[1:24:23] dream in his dream or vision that you
[1:24:26] had done like moses you forgot the
[1:24:28] feeling of the people you forgot the
[1:24:30] call that i called you to
[1:24:32] i let the sick lay i wanted the lord to
[1:24:34] give me where to go and what and and not
[1:24:36] what to do and what not to do that's
[1:24:38] wrong
[1:24:39] i built myself a complex because the
[1:24:41] people didn't hear my message
[1:24:42] god forbid that i'll try to compare my
[1:24:44] life to like moses but it's exactly what
[1:24:46] moses did
[1:24:48] and and so brother branham
[1:24:50] he he goes on you know telling this
[1:24:53] story and and i don't just want to
[1:24:55] linger there but my you he's just giving

[1:25:16] around people anymore and i just want
[1:25:17] you to accept it
[1:25:19] and god wouldn't have anything to do
[1:25:22] with it
[1:25:24] and said carry out your plans
[1:25:27] and you'll be like that bum you saw in
[1:25:28] the dream
[1:25:30] see
[1:25:32] carry out your plans god reply and god
[1:25:34] god's replies why do you always wait for
[1:25:36] me to move you
[1:25:38] why do i always got to drive you to it
[1:25:41] i've called you to this office i've
[1:25:43] called you to be a christian i've uh
[1:25:45] come on bethel's tabernacle he's called
[1:25:47] you to be a son or daughter of god he's
[1:25:49] he's called you to be full of the holy
[1:25:50] ghost he's called you he's called you to
[1:25:53] raise your children in the admonition of
[1:25:55] god he's called you to be in the house
[1:25:56] of god he's called you to love him and
[1:25:58] serve him and be a light in the in the
[1:26:00] community
[1:26:02] what what is our excuses for our
[1:26:04] carnality and just holding back and
[1:26:06] holding back and holding back and
[1:26:08] minimalizing it minimalizing it i don't
[1:26:10] want to pay the price be honest you
[1:26:12] don't want to pay the price
[1:26:16] i think of elijah in the cave in
[1:26:18] elijah's defense and answers of why he
[1:26:20] was hiding in the cave
[1:26:22] you know the story we're not going to
[1:26:23] take time to read it very discouraged by
[1:26:26] the people
[1:26:28] everybody had forsaken him and
[1:26:31] now he's i mean if he's in the cave he's
[1:26:32] off the field if he's off the field he's
[1:26:34] not at war
[1:26:36] he's he's left the field of battle
[1:26:39] a mighty prophet like elijah
[1:26:42] see
[1:26:45] he's running from a woman he's hiding in
[1:26:48] a cave he's
[1:26:49] all down and depressed hiding in the
[1:26:51] dark and god comes to him what are you
[1:26:53] doing here elijah now you go back in the
[1:26:56] text god never sent him there god knew
[1:26:57] he was going to go
[1:27:00] fed him fed him and fed him a lot
[1:27:01] because he knew the journey he was going
[1:27:02] to go but there's no command for god and
[1:27:05] god comes there to finally brother
[1:27:06] branham says he says as a runaway
[1:27:08] prophet just like moses a runaway
[1:27:10] prophet
[1:27:11] and he said when moses said when god
[1:27:13] finally found him was back on the
[1:27:14] backside of arabia you know married to
[1:27:16] an ethiopian woman raising sheep when
[1:27:18] god found elijah when god found his
[1:27:21] prophet he was he was you know huddled
[1:27:23] up in the back of a cave sitting in the
[1:27:25] dark crying pleading to die
[1:27:27] amen
[1:27:29] with work left to do with souls that
[1:27:32] needed saved with the jehovah to be
[1:27:34] glorified
[1:27:36] amen elijah what are you doing here
[1:27:40] well
[1:27:42] nobody likes me and
[1:27:44] the queen's trying to kill me and
[1:27:47] everybody has forsaken your word in fact
[1:27:49] as i'm the only christian left
[1:27:52] nobody else is even believers except me
[1:27:54] and they all hate me and and and i've
[1:27:56] been rejected by everybody and the
[1:27:57] government's against me and and and i've
[1:28:00] i've run and i've worked and i'm tired
[1:28:01] and i want to go home and i just want to
[1:28:03] die
[1:28:06] now what do you say to that lord
[1:28:09] you know what the lord did
[1:28:12] okay elijah anyway what are you doing
[1:28:14] here
[1:28:18] just repeated the question like as if he
[1:28:20] just
[1:28:21] [Music]
[1:28:24] okay you done you done little baby
[1:28:27] why are you here
[1:28:31] and elijah because he's too much like us
[1:28:34] as the bible said he's a man of like
[1:28:35] passions just like us just like you and
[1:28:37] me
[1:28:39] brother branham said it man he he
[1:28:41] he had his ups and downs and
[1:28:44] as if as elijah's so thick he's still
[1:28:46] not getting it he just repeats the same
[1:28:48] thing when god asks the question again
[1:28:50] he gives him the same answer
[1:28:51] and finally god says elisha elijah
[1:28:54] you're not going to die first of all i
[1:28:56] got more work for you to do there's
[1:28:57] another prophet got to be anointed in
[1:28:59] your office there's has held got to be
[1:29:00] found you you got three tasks you got to
[1:29:02] go do elijah now get up out of this cave
[1:29:05] stop crying get back in the field of
[1:29:08] battle and god comes in a and a fire and
[1:29:11] a wind but elijah you know he he's
[1:29:14] learned a lesson that that that when
[1:29:16] you're going to serve god you don't just
[1:29:18] go on some emotionalism
[1:29:20] this has got to be something real it's
[1:29:23] got to hit at a deeper level and he
[1:29:25] ignored the fire and ignored the wind he
[1:29:26] knew god wasn't in that but then a still
[1:29:29] small voice came and he covers his face
[1:29:31] and comes out to hear the comes out to

[1:32:30] and arthur mccoy gives a testimony he
[1:32:32] said you know he said
[1:32:34] up until that time i thought i had been
[1:32:36] a pretty good fella
[1:32:40] you know i'd i'd preach the gospel he
[1:32:42] said but i
[1:32:43] you know i knew there were some little
[1:32:44] white lies that i told and
[1:32:47] little little deceptive little practices
[1:32:49] and i hadn't always just been
[1:32:51] exactly a completely honest
[1:32:57] and he said
[1:33:00] yes sir
[1:33:02] i've lied
[1:33:05] hmm
[1:33:07] arthur mccoy
[1:33:09] did you ever steal
[1:33:12] and he said i thought to myself
[1:33:15] i i don't
[1:33:17] no i i've never stolen act you know not
[1:33:20] exactly
[1:33:22] but i i do remember you know i'm
[1:33:24] thinking he's thinking but i do kind of
[1:33:26] remember some of those business deals i
[1:33:28] pulled and pulled a few little strings
[1:33:30] and kind of
[1:33:32] you know wasn't exactly right
[1:33:36] and he said let me tell you in that
[1:33:38] presence

[1:33:44] arthur mccoy doesn't even
[1:33:46] he doesn't even offer that verbally to
[1:33:48] the lord
[1:33:49] he's just thinking it in his own mind
[1:33:52] and he says

[1:33:57] the bottom line is
[1:33:59] i have stolen
[1:34:01] i have lied
[1:34:04] and he said the king
[1:34:06] his voice grew stern and he said

[1:34:15] and i sentence you and he says he was
[1:34:18] just about ready to hear him say depart
[1:34:21] from me you worker of iniquity into
[1:34:23] everlasting flames
[1:34:25] and he said right as he's getting ready
[1:34:26] to say it he said the sweetest voice
[1:34:30] i ever heard said father
[1:34:34] and he said i turned around and he said
[1:34:36] it was the sweetest voice i'd ever heard
[1:34:37] and the sweetest face i'd ever heard
[1:34:40] and he said he stepped up beside me and
[1:34:42] put his arm around me and says father
[1:34:45] it's true
[1:34:46] that he did lying he did steal and he
[1:34:49] hasn't exactly done everything right but

[1:36:48] he even had to tell brother branham you
[1:36:50] must be more sincere
[1:36:56] don't find yourself on the other side of
[1:36:59] guilt and being exposed and
[1:37:01] see if you feel like offering your
[1:37:03] feeble excuses then if even brother
[1:37:05] branham carried out his plan and would
[1:37:07] have been a bum
[1:37:08] and god wasn't mincing words
[1:37:11] he wasn't bluffing that was not an idle
[1:37:13] threat
[1:37:14] god wasn't being facetious god wasn't
[1:37:16] trying to scare him
[1:37:18] god was not mincing words he was very
[1:37:20] serious
[1:37:22] so i say to you tonight friends find
[1:37:24] your way forward
[1:37:26] find your way forward and for some of us
[1:37:29] i know in certain elements of my life i
[1:37:31] first had to go back to the starting
[1:37:32] gate and do some repenting and come back
[1:37:35] to the starting block and say lord now
[1:37:37] i'm going to go forward but i need to
[1:37:38] come back to this starting spot right
[1:37:40] here because i can't just go forward i
[1:37:42] got to fix some things in arrears and i
[1:37:44] had to come back to my knees and say
[1:37:47] father god help me today from this hour
[1:37:50] i'm rededicating my life to spirituality
[1:37:53] i'm throwing out carnality out of my
[1:37:55] life out of my home out of my occupation
[1:37:57] i'm making changes to my career i'm
[1:37:59] changing my priorities
[1:38:02] i'm done offering excuses i want to have
[1:38:04] the living god moving in my life
[1:38:08] i want to be an achiever i want to have
[1:38:10] satan under my feet i want to make all
[1:38:12] of god's enemies how many want to make
[1:38:14] god's enemies his footstool
[1:38:18] that's your part of it friends whatever
[1:38:20] it takes we have to go forward whatever
[1:38:24] it takes
[1:38:25] to take the land
[1:38:28] whatever it takes to take the land
[1:38:33] sometimes i wonder how is it that we
[1:38:35] seek deliverance
[1:38:38] from the very thing you keep feeding on
[1:38:42] how how does that make sense to us
[1:38:47] to
[1:38:48] try to take victory and
[1:38:50] you're you're even sitting here tonight
[1:38:52] and maybe the impact of this word and
[1:38:54] the and the the dynamic approach that
[1:38:57] the lord has inspired me to take and
[1:38:59] maybe you're sitting here with all kinds
[1:39:01] of zeal and burning and you can't wait
[1:39:02] for church to be over so you can go make
[1:39:05] you can you can uh my goodness i'm
[1:39:07] pledging my allegiance i'm i'm going
[1:39:09] forward again and yet tomorrow finds you
[1:39:14] tomorrow finds you
[1:39:17] once more
[1:39:18] feeding on the very things
[1:39:21] that are the fuel
[1:39:24] for the thing that has you trapped
[1:39:27] and you're hoping for deliverance from
[1:39:29] the thing while feeding on the fuel that
[1:39:31] feeds it
[1:39:34] this thing can't just be excitement
[1:39:37] this can't just be you know me whipping
[1:39:40] you up into a frenzy and i'm going to
[1:39:42] conquer i'm going to conquer i'm going
[1:39:43] to go forward you won't do nothing but
[1:39:45] fall flat on your face i'm here to tell
[1:39:47] you you're going to have to be more
[1:39:49] sincere
[1:39:50] this is an age where sincerity is going
[1:39:52] to have to eclipse every other age that
[1:39:54] we've ever lived in you're not going to
[1:39:56] have the kind of victories it's
[1:39:58] impossible god can't get behind that
[1:40:00] kind of life we've got to cast down all
[1:40:02] vain imaginations we've got to cast down
[1:40:05] all complexes get rid of them get rid of
[1:40:07] carnality and say lord today i'm not
[1:40:10] just purposing in my mind but i'm
[1:40:12] actually going to put footsteps to this
[1:40:14] thing
[1:40:17] we live in an age i'm just going to make
[1:40:19] these comments to you as i get ready to
[1:40:21] close
[1:40:23] we live in an age so fast-paced
[1:40:27] moving towards destruction and total
[1:40:30] insanity
[1:40:33] that we're constantly encountering
[1:40:36] one seat of discrepancy after another
[1:40:40] you can hardly overcome five and there's
[1:40:42] nine more behind it
[1:40:44] get get trip tip toe over those nine and
[1:40:46] there's 15 waiting for you tomorrow
[1:40:49] that's the age we're living in it's
[1:40:50] rapid it's fast paced it's headed for
[1:40:52] destruction it's headed over the cliff
[1:40:54] seeds of discrepancy are everywhere and
[1:40:56] my fear is that too many parents and
[1:40:59] even too many pastors and too many
[1:41:00] preachers are getting outpaced
[1:41:03] and out flanked by the enemy don't get
[1:41:06] out flanked
[1:41:07] by the enemy don't get outpaced by the
[1:41:09] enemy i'm here to tell you god has given
[1:41:12] us too much provision to allow that to
[1:41:14] happen he's done too much for us he's
[1:41:17] conquered every foe and he offers you
[1:41:19] that kind of victory if you'll accept it
[1:41:21] if you'll take it
[1:41:28] brother branham says in possessing the
[1:41:30] gate of the enemy after trial
[1:41:35] when a preacher stand and lets you women
[1:41:37] bob your hair and wear paint and stuff
[1:41:40] and don't correct you there's no genuine
[1:41:42] love there
[1:41:43] and won't call it out and let every
[1:41:45] men marry three to four times and all
[1:41:47] these other things and get by with it
[1:41:48] there's no genuine love there let you
[1:41:50] join a church and pat you on the back
[1:41:52] and smother you with some creed saying
[1:41:54] that's all you have to do
[1:41:59] has joined the holy church there's no
[1:42:01] love there
[1:42:03] or either the man has so totally lost
[1:42:05] himself he don't see it genuine love is
[1:42:07] corrective and brings you back to the
[1:42:09] word of god here tonight friends i'm

[1:43:26] his end he's like a roaring lion he's

[1:44:10] that that for every bit of purpose that
[1:44:13] you feel in your heart to go forward he

[1:45:11] the fountain that never runs dry

[1:45:18] then he'll at least
[1:45:20] severely hinder you
[1:45:23] if he can
[1:45:25] and cause you to miss every benefit he
[1:45:27] can
[1:45:31] brother branham says
[1:45:34] you believe every word

[1:45:39] we believe every promise in the word
[1:45:42] we are sealed by the spirit to confirm
[1:45:44] the promise
[1:45:46] that's what it's what abraham the way he
[1:45:48] did it then and then only
[1:45:51] have we the right
[1:45:53] to possess the gate
[1:45:55] of our enemy
[1:46:00] you have a right
[1:46:01] to possess it

[1:46:08] you don't even have a right to possess
[1:46:09] it without the spirit of god being first
[1:46:12] in your life and then when the spirit of
[1:46:13] god is first in your life you have full
[1:46:15] rights to possess
[1:46:17] the gate of the enemy after trial
