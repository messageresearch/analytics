e e e e e for e for for good morning everybody let's uh stand and have a word of prayer if you would gracious father Lord we come before you this morning Lord inviting you into our Sunday school service this morning Lord ask you would meet us here father that wherever there'd be two or three gathered in your name that you'd always come so father Lord I ask that you would be with us here you'd meet us you'd reveal yourself to us a little in your word father this thought that I have that you could take it and use it to speak to the people Lord that any any nervousness or any any emotion on my part father would be able to be set aside and become subject to your will Lord that people would hear what they the word that you would have for them this morning Father you come when you're invited we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen um if you would turn to Genesis Chapter 18 and uh start at verse one it says um we'll just read the first three verses says and and then all y'all can sit down and says and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamry and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my Lord if now I found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant y'all be seated um I'm going to kind of skip down and keep reading some verses um and just kind of do a quick overview of the chapter and it says I'm going to skip down to verse n and it says uh and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife Sha's son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure with my Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of aury bear a child which I'm old is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied saying I laugh not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou did laugh skipping down to 23 says and Abraham Drew near and said wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked per Adventure there be 50 righteous within the city wilt thou also destroy and spare not the place for the 50 righteous that are therein um that there be far uh that be far from thee to do this to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the Earth do right um and then finally verse uh 32 um and he said oh let not the Lord be angry and I will speak yet but this once per Adventure 10 shall be found there and he said I will not destroy it for 10's sake and the Lord went his way as soon as he had left communion with Abraham and Abraham returned unto his place um I kind of what inspired this thought was um was actually um I was doing some reading and there was actually historically um there was um well let me let me just start it like this so a lot of times people have questions about the American legal system in regards to a lot of times you see some news story or something where some guy does something you know heinous and everybody knows he's guilty he knows he's guilty everyone knows he's guilty the judge knows the prosecutor knows the defense attorney knows he he's wrong and he's guilty and he needs you know to suffer the penalty of of the crime and yet there's some sort of technicality someone didn't dot an eye or cross a tea on some legal document somewhere and the guy walks right and he's and he's gets scot-free goes off scot-free because of a technicality even though everybody knows he did it and a lot of people kind of like well this is kind of seems like it's a it's a corrupt thing right like it doesn't seem that doesn't seem just it doesn't seem fair that doesn't seem like a good thing at all all and you know the the instinct is to say well we should really you know tighten down on on the protections that we give the accused because it seems like it's too easy to get away with things but if you look at the the history of the American legal system it was designed specifically to protect the accused right it was built and it's based off of this thing this uh I believe it was in the 1500s it was actually based off of a what they call blackstone's Theory which is a a old legal scholar from back in the 1500s named William Blackstone who he famously said his theory was that if you're going to that the legal system should um be set up um to protect the accused because it's better that a hundred guilty people walk free than one innocent person is punished right it is always it and he said he said his reason for that he says because there's always going to be another crime someone else is going to do something wrong there's always going to be another guilty person to punish but you got to protect the innocent because that's rare right that's that's something worthy of protecting and the reason his basis for this right this is and this is you know really kind of makes you kind of look back and think you know people in history were were a different different breed you know different higher kind of person because his basis for this his entire basis for this legal theory was Genesis Chapter 18 because he said the nature of God was one who would not punish the innocent with the guilty that he could look at Sodom and know that that City needed to be absolutely wiped off the face of the Earth and here's Abraham bargaining with God just begging plee you know working him if there's just 10 left there's just 10 and you would think well you know who would have you know when God you know if you were met face to face with God in person he says hey I'm going to destroy the city you know who would think okay this is Jehovah in the flesh am I going to sit here and try to talk him out of it right I'm going to talk him out of it and yet Abraham could do it and God would go along with everything Abraham said because God already had a plan for this situation right God's you know it's kind of like I don't know if you ever have you know you're going to you are you get in your mind you're going to do something nice for somebody like your wife or your kids or something or your friend and you're going to do something nice for them and they ask you hey will you do this thing for me and You' already planned you were going to do it you know God had already had a plan God wasn't going to punish anybody because if if all right so look if if it would have been left up to Abraham then God would have had total justification to wipe out 10 innocent people with the rest of the city right and lot and his family would have been toast because only three made it out right lot and his family made it way under the threshold so but God's plan plan was that zero innocent people were going to be punished right there were going to be none he was going to make sure they were out before the city burned right because God won't allow the innocent to be punished with the guilty because he's a God of Justice he's he's he can't I mean it would be so contrary to God's nature to to destroy an innocent person with the guilty but all humanity is guilty on on some level right all humanity is guilty on some level and so God knowing this had to perform a great Injustice because he would he would punish an innocent person for the sake of all of humanity right that there would have to be one person who would have to completely innocent would ultimately be punished for the for sins of all Humanity right and that Christ stepping into that role right that God looking down at Humanity in love saying this is not a place for justice this is a place for love this is a place for for Grace this is a place for that that no angel could do this you know it's like you know brother Bram tells the story of of of the the um the three three Hebrews in the fiery furnace that how God looking over the bandits or seeing these the his children about to be burnt you know and all the Angels coming up with their oh we can flood them out you know worm would all destroy them with a flood and you know the other you know I'll rain fire from the heavens and and God says no this is a man-sized job right this is a job that only a man could do and the ultimate goal of this the ultimate goal of this Grace was not simply just to make the the guilty innocent for a Time you know because if the if if God just you know if if you just got a a one-off pardon well tomorrow you will fail again amen right it's gonna it's the the purpose of of Christ dying was not simply to wipe your sins away because eventually you will fail again it the the purpose was to allow you to have a new life which we man I I I I I just so wish that I could say this the way it came to me the in if we read you know Genesis Chapter 18 all this is built right there in the story right um maybe I should just I'm just going to read this quote and kind of so this is from um the voice of the sign 1964 and it says um and Jesus said uh that would return again now remember Abraham called that man Elohim god um God he would he would have to be why he could discern the thoughts and he was exactly on time and Elohim the god or the Holy Ghost not another person the same person returning into the church would do the same thing that would be the sign and the voice would be call them back to the word restore the faith of the children to the fathers there is the sign and the voice signs are usually accepted but the voice is not they don't like the voice but they'll take the sign usually they'll take it they like the sign because they like to look at it entertains them but the voice they don't want to do it remember now the voice and then I'm going to skip down um a paragraph and it says um turn back to the word again Jesus's sign of the Messiah according to Isaiah 35 the lame show leap like a heart and all this that was wonderful oh they accepted that that was good they believed that they believed the sign come on Rabbi to my church we'll give you full cooperation sure we believe you you're um you're the wonderful you're the rabbi uh you're the young Prophet come in all kinds of cooperation the sign is wonderful but when the voice speaks and said I and my father are one amen oh my they couldn't believe that you make yourself God they don't want the voice they like the sign they know that they admitted it admitted it was the sign of the Messiah but the voice they didn't like that the works that I do shall you do also and they said he is Beelzebub so here comes here comes uh you know brother brandom is calling that the sign that they had was God made flesh right that was the sign that Sodom had was there was God made flesh amongst them that was their sign right and and you know in another place I don't have it here but he talks about how those angels went down to Sodom and that they had a great Revival right they had a great Revival there were there you know so many times people like the sign they like go God made flesh they like to be around it there's lots of fishes and Loaves there's lots of lame people walking there's lots of blind people seeing when there's god-made flesh around right there's there's they like the the good works they like the the the benefits you know people really really like the the the results that God produces when he indwells within people but the minute that that word made flesh looks at them and says okay but now you can do the same works right now it's your turn oh suddenly you're be elub right suddenly when the voice of the sign right you know people liked the the the the the ministry of William brandham right oh people liked the the healings they liked the healing campaigns they liked it when he raised the dead they liked it when you know he emptied out hospitals but when the voice went forth and said come out of her my people oh suddenly people got their hackles up right suddenly oh we don't like that we don't like it when you know he's he's telling us how to live we don't like it when he's telling us how you know you know uh uh the the things that we like so much are of the devil right he doesn't you know people don't like it when you know they're they're uh huh when they have to confront the fact that denominational system that they're a part of is called a name of blasphemy by the by the scripture amen right people don't like that you know and in this day you know there's there's people who are the word made flesh right you you are the word made flesh that is Christ Living in you am the hope of glory and and you are living a life that only Christ could live through you and people you know you go out into the world and people like that people people like to be around you people like you know huh people like to hire message people right people like the fact that you know message people don't aren't a a security risk right they like to have message people on their payroll because they don't have to worry about them stealing from the company and that they're going to show it up or work on time and they're not just going to run the clock and they're actually going to do work on the on the you know when they're on pay on the clock they like the hardworking message people they like to you know they're friendly they're kind they they'll you know give you the shirt off their back they like message people right but the moment they go and ask a message person what makes you the way you are and now it's now they're presented okay we're not just a product of of a denomination this isn't just this isn't just doctrinal like this isn't just you didn't get this because we got some new updated version of no no this is this something to this there's life in this and the only way you're going to get it is through a message of the hour and that message of the hour is going to is going to call out a lot of the nonsense of the world oh people will suddenly I mean they'll love you and then the minute that they see what makes you who you are Oh They'll turn on you right oh then the knives come out because they love the sign right they love that sign of the word made flesh but boy they don't like the voice and so here's here's Abraham speaking to the to Jehovah made flesh right there's a man in front of him speaking to him and he and he does the and he he performs the the uh the Messianic sign right he discerns the hearts right this was always the sign of the Messiah well and the reason was the sign of the Messiah is because the Jews knew that that's how that's what Jehovah did when Jehovah met Abraham right that they knew that the Messiah would do the same thing because that's what Jehovah did and so anyone who does that it's an indication that there's Jehovah there right that only Jehovah can discern the discern the hearts that's why the woman at the well knew that Christ was the Messiah when he met her there because she told her everything that she had done so here's the question when William brandham turned his back on an audience and starts Discerning people in the crowd who did that now I'm not saying you know you know William Brandon was a man I'm not trying to make William brand the Messiah by any stretch but there was certainly a messiah there right there was something more like you know the man William brandham yeah he'll he'll you know he flew off into a temper and was going to go shoot a bunch of people over a dog you know or you know when he steep you know even after he got the Holy Ghost he's ministered for years steps out the back door and tells a lie because he didn't want to talk to a lawyer you that that's a man man you know people fail that's not that's not Christ but but when he's telling people what they had done and and the thoughts and intents of their heart that's more than William brandham that did that right so there was there was word made flesh there was word in flesh in our day and and here's here's uh Sarah and Abraham confronted with the word made flesh in their day and he's here he is deserting their hearts and so when he speaks Sarah laughs right Sarah says you know well that's ridiculous I I mean come on the circumstances of My Flesh do not allow for what you just said to to happen amen right I am too old I am too ancient it is biologically impossible for what for what the word made flesh just said to happen right and she laughed and we think oh that's ridiculous that's Jehovah he can do anything why would you laugh at that well I don't know Church why do we laugh at it right why is it that when when a prophet says you know when Christ says the works that I do shall you do also right not just Healing The Sick and raising the dead though that's part of it but living the life that he lived having the having the the the the love and the kindness and the and the the the the the willingness to sacrifice you know when those Works shall you do also and why do we say well that's impossible we could never bring forth the promised son in our lives our the circumstances of our flesh are far too great for the for the word to overcome that we do it all the time but but at the end of the day it doesn't really matter what Sarah did it didn't really matter whe the circumstances of your flesh are IR irrelevant right because at the end of the day that spoken word created a body change in Sarah right you know it created a complete Rejuvenation of the Flesh and that's that's the promise right that's the sign that you know people will reject but the bride won't right that's the sign because you know when when when uh you know as I said previously you know when the word came to Mary and she said be it unto me well again the the the circumstances of her flesh were such that the word was biologically impossible that was not a possibility and yet all it takes is Faith in that spoken word for it to bring it to pass regardless of the circumstances right just because you have all kinds of faults and failures and well my I just just can't get over myself you're right you can't but God can and God will God will obey the Overcomer it's you know it's the spirit of God within you that overcomes not you not you know some grit and determination but say Lord I I want to live right I want to do better I I I don't want to be subject to these things that that hold me down that hold me back these places where my faith is weak well and when you're weak he's strong and wherever you need you need uh Deliverance well the Lord is there to deliver you and and overcome your flesh because that's what he promised to do and the word it has to do it it can't not you know when when uh it's like when uh brother Jason was talking about this um we talked about the third poll here's Abraham taking his son Isaac to the mountain to sacrifice him and he says and Isaac says well here's the here's the the fire and the wood but where's the lamb and Abraham says God will provide himself a lamb what's that what was he doing Abraham spoke that lamb into existence right he spoke that lamb into existence when that spoken word Goes Forth it can not happen right it it has to happen and so when you have the prophet of the age standing behind a Pulpit calling forth a bride and saying and and calling forth people message Believers and saying you will be go in a Rapture you're going in a Rapture it has to be and speaking a word of Prophecy it's going to happen it has to happen regardless of your faults and failures regardless of of any weakness that you have regardless of anything it will happen and I'm out of time we'll we'll stand and stand and have a word of prayer father Lord we thank you for this time that you've spent with us Lord ask that you would be with us through the remainder of the service Lord as the singing and the worship come forward Lord that it would just be an extension of the worship of Our Lives Lord that that our lives would be a worship and that as we would sing it would just be the the the the recognition of what you've done for us already and father that throughout the service that our hearts would be open that we'd set aside the cares of the world and not be burdened down by by uh the things that the you know uh our minds that our our minds would be stayed upon your word Lord that our hearts we'd have the right mental attitude toward the word that we would hear today that we would be man we would manifest in our lives we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] l [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
