Let's give her a hand. Amen. [Applause] Test test [Music] on my own. Every time I try to stand, I start to fall. All those lonely roads that I have traveled on, there was Jesus. When the life I built came crashing to the ground. When the friends I had were nowhere to be found. I couldn't see. But I can see it now. There was Jesus. In the waiting, in the searching, in the healing and the hurting, like a blessing buried in the broken pieces. every minute, every moment, where I've been, and where I'm going. Even when I didn't know it or couldn't see it, there was Jesus [Music] with this man who needs amazing kind of grace. for forgiveness at a price I couldn't pay. I'm not perfect, so I thank God every day. [Music] There was Jesus [Music] in the waiting, in the search, in the healing and the hurting. Like a blessing buried in the broken pieces. Every minute, every moment, where I've been, and where I'm going. Even when I didn't know it or couldn't see it. There was Jesus on the mountain, in the valley. There was Jesus in the shadow of the valleys. There was Jesus in the fire, in the flood. There was Jesus always is and always was. [Music] In the waiting, in the searching, in the healing and the hurting, like a blessing buried in the broken pieces. Every minute, every moment where I've been, where I'm going. Even when I dear didn't know it or couldn't see it, there was Jesus. [Music] There was Jesus. [Music] There was Jesus. [Applause] Brother Levi Whitfield. Amen. Let's give him a hand. Amen. [Music] One dark night in Egypt, a fearful time had come for one little Hebrew boy. He was his father's firstborn son. And with the angel of death passing low, it was hard to fall asleep. For one little lamb stood in his mind. As he laid there counting sheep, he wondered why the young lamb had to die. While his blood was on the door, through the wind and the rain still remain, but he wanted to be sure. So called out to his earthly father with a trembling voice so scared crying father would you please look and see that the blood is still there. And he said, "Son, now don't you worry. For the blood is there to stay. The winds may blow, the rains may fall, but it won't just wash away. The blood will stand. The raging storm. It's been applied with love and care, safe, secure. You can rest assured that the blood is still there. Looking over all the damage Satan storm had left behind. A flood of endless questions and doubt had filled my mind. The fear that gripped my troubled soul brought me down on my knees and prayer. Crying, "Father, would you please look and see that the blood is still there? And he says, "Son, now don't you worry. For my blood, it's there to stay. The winds may blow, the rains may fall, but it won't just wash away. The blood will stand. The raging storm has been applied with my love and care. Oh, safe, secure. You can rest assured that my blood is still there, safe, secure. You can rest assured that the blood is still there. [Music] Sister Mary and Zoe. Amen. If you call me, man. Let's give them a hand. [Applause] [Music] Why do they leave? [Music] Isn't this still the same? Why do they seek for something more than simplicity? Why do they turn their backs on you? Oh Lord, why do they yearn for something more? [Music] Your truth is what I follow and it will still be true tomorrow. What I believe is not the works of any man. His kingdom can't be shaken on his glorious foundation. While others fall, here I stand. I know they said [Music] there is a great falling away. I know they try to complicate what you say, but in my soul, I'm sure of the rock I stand upon. One thing I know, I will press on. Your truth is what I follow and it will still be true tomorrow. What I believe is not the works of any man. His kingdom can't be shaken on this glorious foundation. While others fall, here I'll stand. [Music] On Christ the solid rock I stand on. Oh Lord, the ground is sinking sand. While others fall, here I stand. Your truth is what I follow and it will still be true tomorrow. What I believe is not the works of any man. [Music] This kingdom can't be shaken on this glorious foundation. While others fall, here I stand. While others fall, here I stand. [Applause] Let's stand together. Sometime I like to just take a little season just to worship the Lord a little bit. Amen. Before the word. Amen. How many have a heart of worship? Amen. Be thou strong, very courageous, disposes the inhabitants of your land. I have given you this promise and it's time to take a stand. You got to drive out your enemy so your children can go free. And little by little, you'll gain the victory. Oh, little by little, you can win every battle. Little by little, you can coner every f and I'll set boundaries around you. They will stretch from sea to sea. Little by little, I will prosper thee. Little by little, little by little, you can win every battle. [Music] Little by little, you can coner f. And outset boundaries around you. They will stretch from sea to sea. Little by little, I will prosper thee. You've got rights in the Holy Spirit. [Music] You've been given full authority in his name. [Music] There's no time left now for crying. It's a shame to complain. You got to kick the devil off your mountain. You're predestined and ordained. Don't you know that you're a soldier in the army of the king? And little by little, you can win every battle. Little by little, you can coner every f and I'll set boundaries around you. They will stretch from sea to sea. Little by little, I will prosper thee. Say, little by little, you can win every battle. Oh, little by little, you can coner f and I'll set boundaries around you.

Oh, little by little, you can win every battle. Little by little, you can coner every f. And I'll set boundaries around you. Glory. &gt;&gt; They'll stretch from sea to sea. Little I will prosper thee. Give &gt;&gt; the Lord a hand this morning. Hallelujah. Oh, give him some praise, little by little. You know, there's a there's a method to madness. They say, I want to tell you something. There's a method to overcoming. There's a method to being a believer and the Bible spells it out so clearly. I think we've had such a weekend of that, rooting that starting out with saying amen to every word. Just say a yes to the word. Listen, you might not be able to always I say, are you victorious? You might say, you know, are you are you overcoming? Well, but but how about this? The Lord has said you are you have already overcome. Just say yes. Just say yes. I'm just going to believe about me what the Lord says. Listen friends, little by little, you'll take it all. Amen. It's all about that daily coming before the Lord and saying, "Lord, today, today, how can I serve you today?" Do what? Jesus said, "Look, yesterday, there's yesterday, tomorrow to take care of itself. You can't go back and relive yesterday, but I can face today what's right in front of me." Amen. And that is a key. That's a a key. you'll just find yourself going up. I I told several people in the prayer line last night and and I've taken to saying it, you know, I said it to myself and that is, you know, we're climbing we're climbing Mount Zion. And every day just figure to reach up for a higher handhold. Pour yourself up to that one. The next day, reach up for another higher handhold. How many will do that? Now, you go from here and say, "I'm going to reach for a higher handhold tomorrow and then another higher one." I'm going to tell you something, friends. One of these days we're going to break through. Hallelujah. What a celebration. You're talking about a youth camp. My my that wedding banquet that's going to be the biggest youth camp gathering that's ever been conceived. Amen. It's going that table's going to have to stretch thousands of miles long. I'm going to be there. You going to be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, all too soon, just as we knew, uh, we started saying it, you know, even Thursday night, before you know it, it'll be Thursday, Friday, Saturday, here we are, Sunday. Amen. And I just think that what we should do is just start over and let's go all into the next week. I would have your parents calling me up saying, "Where is my child?" I say, "Well, we got in heavenly places and decided not to leave." Amen. Praise God. I sure appreciate I wanted to just say and take a moment and then we want to bring brother Donnie out and turn him loose again. He's the only man in the house dressed up. Amen. And so uh they said so this is a casual day. I said yeah it's a travel day. It's kind of a thing we do. I said brother Donnie be the only man dressed out. I said I ain't even sure if he will. Sometimes you know you never know. He might come in blue jeans as well. I said I don't care if he comes in bib overalls. Amen. As long as he's got the dress wear of the word of God around his life. That's what we're after, friends. Hallelujah. We want him to take his liberty again. I know we've we've had a lot of preaching and teaching and fellowship and food, natural and spiritual, but I just say once more, Lord. Once more, we got We're all going to travel home. We're all going to be Listen, the devil's going to be waiting on you next week to see if what you got here will really if you really meant it. And I just want to tell him right now, I mean it. &gt;&gt; I mean it. I I I I tell you what, I don't I might not, you know, my W and L column don't always I I don't get always get wins. Sometimes I have some some in the L column, but I'm glad the Lord doesn't keep up with my wins and losses. Amen. He's interested in the fight. Are you willing to fight? Are you willing to press forward and keep going? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother Wesley, you got out of my song. How'd you do that? You I didn't hear it last night, so Uhhuh. So you Okay.

His brother Biscoll and his mother-in-law and my sister, she wrote to me from Washington. She said, "Are you sure Wesley's going to be able uh to be there this year?" I said, "If he's not, we're cancelling camp. There's a few people that are so integral that we just have to cancel it out if they're not coming. So, amen. Y'all, y'all keep Brother Wes in prayer. Amen. That he's here every year. Amen. Praise God. Well, we're going to go right to the word. And I just want to give a word of thanks and gratitude for all the people. It would be impossible for me to start naming names. Um, I like to just, you know, think of all the teams, all the counselors, all the workers, all the musicians, the worship team, all the preaching of the gospel, every everybody that is anybody that made that made it all go. And uh, I'm certainly I'd be right down at the very bottom of that list. I probably physically do the least, but uh, I I appreciate all my teams that gather around and make this happen. Amen. Amen. I appreciate, brother Matt, sister Rachel. They kind of headed up head up the whole thing from the top. Amen. All I get to mainly do is write the checks. Amen. And I'm glad. Don't bring your problem to me. Go figure it out. Amen. Praise the Lord. And uh we thank you for coming and uh and and trust that you had a wonderful time in the Lord. Have you enjoyed yourself here at Bethl Camp? Amen. 2025. God bless you. God bless you for that. Amen. Praise the Lord. We certainly want to carry on for as long as the Lord will allow it. But I I I every year I finish by by wishing and hoping that maybe this would be the last one on this side and we'd all be in glory this time next year. Won't that be a time Listen friends, that's for real. Your future is bright. It's not uncertain. It's definite. Amen. Praise the Lord. And we have uh we have an appointment. I I tell you, if you ever want a conversation starter, be in a crowd of people and get them talking about, well, you know, the the end of the world, and just pipe up and say, "No, the world's not ending." No, the world is just transitioning. The world, the earth's an eternal attribute of God. It can never be annihilated. We're just headed into a new kingdom with a new king, and he's going to change the whole system. Amen. Praise the Lord. I'm here to tell you, friends, I will still be alive in in in 2125. I will I will still be alive. I will not have perished from the earth. I I may this body may go into a grave that that just a temple I live in. I will still be here in 2425. &gt;&gt; I will be alive in the 25th century, the 27th century, the 28th century. Do you understand that's a reality? Your future is just ahead of you. And that's the reality of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Well, it's not it's not my job to do the preaching today. I'm thankful I get to shout over here, sit over here and shout a few more times. Amen. Sometimes I I may get a little excited. I can't help that. And neither do I apologize for it. I just love the word. It gets so delicious. I feel like my dad, he said, I feel like blowing through the roof and landing out in the road somewhere. Amen. So, Amen. If I if I seem to get exuberant, it's because I love the word of God. Amen. And I strive every day, every day, Lord, let me be more like that word. Amen. That should be all of our desire, friends. Let the let the book live in me. That should be the loudest voice right now at this stage, this many decades in. The loudest voice in the message should be the voice of lived lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I've asked brother Tony to sing that song by his mother-in-law, Sister Brenda Lewis, and I want him to sing it again as we invite Brother Donnie. Amen. Little by little, you you remember that when you when tomorrow and the next day, you just keep saying, "Little by little, little by little, I'm going to take it all." &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. As we invite Brother Donnie to come, let's sing it again. &gt;&gt; Little by little, you can win every battle. &gt;&gt; Say that like a testimony now. &gt;&gt; Little by little, you can come. That's right. every fold. &gt;&gt; Receive that. Believe that. &gt;&gt; And I'll set boundaries. That's what he promised &gt;&gt; around you. &gt;&gt; They'll stretch. &gt;&gt; They will stretch from sea to sea. &gt;&gt; Little by little, little by little. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I will prosper thee &gt;&gt; again. Little by little. &gt;&gt; Oh, little by little. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; You can win every battle. Oh, little by little, you can coner every hole and I'll set the boundaries around you.

Oh, and I'll set boundaries around you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Stretch from sea to sea. And little by little, I will prosper thee. Praise the Lord. Thank you, Lord. God bless you, sir. Certainly appreciate the opportunity to be able to be with you again today. And we're grateful for all the effort that's been put forth in these meetings, all the things that go on behind the scene. All the folks that do that have to sacrifice, can't even hear the word, can't be able to be in service. I appreciate that. Don't you? It's great sacrifice for all of them. May the Lord bless them. And we want to just uh pray together. Want to if you just bow your heads. Lord Jesus, as we've assembled here today, Father, for the last service of these series that we've been privileged to be a part of, we want you to know that we're thankful some Lord already heading home. Brother Stephen Coffee, Brother Diggs heading toward home and Lord, you see our brother Charles Anderson and the church there, his wife. And Lord, we know each one of us were coming that way if the rapture doesn't catch us first. But we know how difficult it can be whenever they are called away. And you actually you let us borrow them for a while. As I was looking at it earlier this morning where your prophet was talking about his own little girl and he said that you loaned her to him and then you called her home. So we realize that our loved ones, our friends, our families are on they're on loan and one day you'll call the loan in. So we want to do everything we can while we're here in this life to be able to influence one another in the right way. We pray, Father, that you would help us as we come to the closing part of of the service today. Lord, help me. I can say something that would be a blessing to them. They've already heard so many good things from these other brothers. We're grateful for each one. Lord, we pray that you'd watch over all those that'll be traveling today. May the spirit of God just keep your hand upon them. How we long for that time when we'll gather together. Your prophet said, "Think of it, missing people. They come up together, missing on the earth, and we can't find them no more. And they're getting together with the rest of the group. That's the hour we're waiting for, Lord Jesus. But until that hour comes, we're going to keep on having youth camps and having meetings and church and doing carrying right home with the father's business. Help us today, Lord. We pray in the name of Jesus. Amen. I want to thank brother Jason for letting us come and be a part of it uh of the services. Always enjoy preaching with brother Jason. We've had some times together overseas and been a dear friend and certainly love and appreciate him. Let's read together if you would today. Mark chapter 5. I know we got a kind of a time thing to to be out of here. So, you don't have to worry about me. I've got under a 4 hour sermon, so we're good. Couple years ago, I was up with Brother Tim Prud at Brother Ron Spencer's church, and I had to preach two services, and brother Tim had to preach one. So, I asked Brother Ron, I said, "Why why am I having to preach two services, and brother Tim just gets one?" He said, "Well, I wanted y'all to have equal time. God help me. He'll hear this. Sure is the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to speak to you just a very simple thought today. He proves his word. Mark 5 22. And behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jaras by name. And when he saw him, he fell at his feet and besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lies at the point of death. I praise thee, come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed, and she shall live." And Jesus went with him, and much people followed and thronged him. You may be seated. Let's just continue reading there in verse 38, if you would. And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and sith a tomalt, and them that wept, and wailed greatly. And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this a do and weep. The damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and enters into where the damsel was lying. And he took the damsel by the hand, and saith unto her, Tisa Kumi, which is being interpreted, damsel, I say unto thee, arise. And straightway the damsel arose and walked, for she was of the age of 12 years. and they were astonished with a great astonishment. Now, we've heard some awesome things these days that we've been able to be together. And of course, it's not the first time that you you use have heard awesome things. You come from churches that believe the word and preach the word. Your pastors, evangelists, and men of God that he's called around the world to be able to bring the words of life. But when we come like this, it's a special meetings, a special times for sure. And every minister I'm sure they've studied and prayed and asked God to give them something that would be a benefit to you. So whenever you go back home, you back to college, back to school, whatever your normaly is whenever you leave here that you will have got something out of these meetings that will help you, something that will benefit you, make you a better Christian. I hear the prophet say there when he was there in 1963 that he wanted to bring something to the tabernacle, something that would make them better people. And he said actually in 1965 he said it this way that he wanted to give them something that would help them to keep the punches off of them as much as possible to keep the punches off of them because there's no way that you're ever going to be in this life free from war, free from trouble, free from heartache. But the thing of it is how are we going to deal with it? How are we going to be able to when it comes against us, what are we going to do? What's our reaction going to be? So, I'd like to uh speak to you today on that God proves his word. And I want to read you this quote from proving his word that he proves his word in every age by the most unusual way. But he always does it in the same way. You see, what did he do in the days of Noah? He was fixing to deliver the remnant. He sent Noah. Sent them Noah the prophet. and he sent Noah a sign. Now, as our brother just sang to us, the song even of the possession that our precious sister which has gone on to her reward was one of the many songs that the Lord gave her. Little by little, it's been sung all over the world. And it it has such a special meaning to us because we realize that this is the way that we take our land. This is the way that we take our inheritance, our possession. There's days that we will have great gains, but most of those days are going to be smaller gains. And as bad as we hate to say it, there will be days that we may actually retract some. There may be days to when we think, Lord, where are you? And you've you've heard wonderful things these days that are here that you are here and gather together and fellowship with one another. And in one way, we wish it could go on and on and on and never end. But you're longing for heaven when you're thinking about that. But we know that what we do is we get here and as that sign says right there, we're getting tools and equipment. &gt;&gt; Tools and equipment so we can be able to face the battle that's ahead of us. And we know some of the greatest trials in our life come under come after the most tremendous blessings that God has ever given. So after God comes on the scene and manifest himself as Jehovah Gyra to Abraham and him and Isaac come off the mountain, the very next verse in the very next chapter is what? Anybody know by memory? It is the deaths of Sarah. So after one of the greatest blessings in his life come one of the most difficult trials in his life as well. And we know that that's the way Satan does. So we gather together, we get many great things and tools and equipment as it were. And then Satan will try to come against us and then try to take away from us what we've actually accumulated while we've been together these days. And we know his tactics. We're not ignorant. And you know, I don't think we should leave these this place and other places like this and say, "Oh no. Oh no. I I I got so many things that I dread going home." There's no need for us to do that. we just face it and say, "By the grace of God, he's equipped us. He's going to give me what I have need of, and he's going to help me to be able to fight this battle that I'm engaged in." And we know that we are. And yet, when you look at it, Brother Rim talks about Joshua and Caleb. And what does he always do? He cannot use unbelievers to prove his word. Now, there are certain scriptures that I personally have no desire to fulfill. There's certain parts of the word I don't want to fulfill. No, there's somebody going to hell. I don't want to fulfill that part. There's people going to be lost. I don't want to fulfill that part. I hope I'm alive and remaining that I can be able to fulfill part of the rapture. But whether I'm alive or go by the way of the grave, I'll feel one fulfill one or the other. But there's portions of the word that you and I are called by God to fulfill. And part of that is victory. Part of that is testimony things that God's going to do in our life and exalt his power through us. And we know that it'll not just be old people, but there was many younger people that gave their lives in the time of the first century. There were many young mothers, as they put it on the skit yesterday. There were many young men. I'm thinking of one sister and her name was Srosa. And she had seven sons. All seven of those sons, they their lives were took. Some of them were pulled behind horses. Some of them they tied them between animals, excuse me, and they pulled their their arms and their legs off of their body. Can you imagine what how Sister Simosa felt when she went back to church the next time? And this all happened within about a week or 10 days and they killed all seven of her sons. Can you imagine what kind of testimony that she would have had when she went back to church the next time and they had a testimony service? Anybody want to testify? Anybody want to say anything about the glory of God? And Sister Sosa stood her feet and said, "I want to thank God for his mercy. I want to thank God for his grace." Now, we thank Lord. It's not just those victorious days when miracles are happening right and left, but it's those times when the troubles are are so mounting up on our lives and whenever you get wonderful things. And no doubt as sheep, you will ruminate over things that was said. And each man, each brother here that's been here is gifted by God in a very unique way. And they in their own unique way will say things that will be able to go to you and you and you. And God does that. God could have made every preacher exactly the same. But why would you need 5,000 of them? Only need one. Everybody follow him. So God makes us so diverse. And yet each man has the ability and his gift is so designed by God to be able to touch you and you and you and you. And yet there's others. And you say, "I I really love that brother. I really think a lot of him, but I just don't get that much from him." But thank God there's others that say, "Oh, you don't? Are you kidding me? My I love to hear that guy preach. Well, God does that on purpose. You know, Brother Dan Daisy told me years and years ago, he said, "Brother Donnie, you know, preachers are like lifesavers. They come in all different flavors." Well, I found that to be true. And yet, God is the one who diversifies it and makes it that way. So, you will begin to ruminate. Maybe you've already thought about things that statements of victory, statements of challenge, statements of of of encouragement that you've already logged in your memory and things that you will go back upon. And no doubt as you live after these few days of gathering together, these are monumental times to me. They're great times that we assemble as the saints of God. And there will be things that Satan will try you on. And remember, when you get something that is absolutely a permanent deposit of the revelation of God in your soul, that is added to the accumulative part of God that he shared with you. Remember what God is sharing with each of us is actually his deity. In 1949, brother Brown tells us that deity is no longer in a manger. Deity is not in heaven, but deity is inside of every one of you. And each revelation that you get is actually more of that deity of God that he's giving to the accumulative revelation of your entire life. What's it for? To help you be a better sister, help you be a better brother. Is that right? And then whenever Satan hears us respond in the services and he sees us respond and his demons are taking note of that and they're watching you and they can tell when something so strikes your soul and then you know what they will do? They will do their best to try to take the value of that away from you when you leave these meetings. So we don't leave victori not victorious rather and we don't leave down. We don't leave thinking well I'm going to pay for all this. Well, that may be true in one way, but God's going to give you the strength to be able to do it. So, God has anointed his men's servants while we've been together here. And they've said certain things that has been able to be a channel by which the spirit of God would flow to you and make a divine connection. It's hard to explain that unless you're a preacher. But there's certain people that in the congregation that if you'll find them while you're preaching and you'll see their eyes and you'll watch their attitude. It don't take everybody in the church. All it takes is a few. And the preacher can preach to the few of them cuz some of the rest of them they'll sit there and watch their watch. You know, they've got their mind who knows where it's at. And you kind of actually preach over the top of them. You don't even look at them. Is that right, brothers? You just preach over the top of them because they'll pull you down if you'll let them. as a preacher, they will. Others will sit there, they're not paying no attention to what you have to say. They're just kind of looking around and watching their watch and they're wanting to know how many pages I've got on my iPad. I ain't going to tell you. And they're wondering how's this going to go and that's going to go. But if you can find a few that you can preach to, you lock into them and they will pull out of you and the spirit of God makes that channel in between you. So that happens in every service and we know it's that way. And then God will give you a word. I hope and pray that many of you have got more than one word while you've been here. And then God will give you that word. And this is the phenomenal part about it. God will actually allow Satan to come back and try you after he revealed that word to you. And God is making a testimony about you that we never hear. Remember Job was not privy to the testimony meeting that went on in heaven. Now, most testimony meetings, it's people stand up and say, "Well, glory to God. I want to thank the Lord for what he done, and he done this for me and that for me." But you see, when heaven has testimony services, it's God testifying about his children. And he said, "I want you to know, devil, I've got young people down there. I've got young ladies. I've got young men. I've got preachers. I've got deacons. I've got sons and daughters. And they're going to stand faithful." And the devil then what the devil does is challenges God's testimony about you. And then God goes back and said, "No, I know my boy. I know my boy. Ben him's been fellowshipping. We've been having a time." And then what will God allow Satan to do? He will allow him to try you to see if you will stand on that word that God gave to you. Now, we know that there's two Greek words that are used to to describe our English word, and that is the word word. WRD in the New Testament. One of them is logos, which most of us are familiar with. But there's another one called Rama, Rh- A. Now, it's it's a same English word. Our interpreters didn't do it quite right. The translators, but anyway, whenever we look at that, the logos is the concept or the mandate of God for the hour. But a Rama word is a word that God takes right out of his scripture and God quickens it to you for your particular need of what you're going through. Now Jesus said man shall not live by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of or bread but by every word. And that word there is not logos but it's actually rama word. And whenever it comes to faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word that's not hearing logos, it's actually rama word. So it's a word that God quickens to you. Do you understand what's happened here these days that we've had together? You've got one Rama word after another after another. Now, it was already logos and maybe you've quoted it for years and years in your Bible. And then God caught you up in a moment of inspiration and the spirit of God had a preacher to use that same scripture, that same quote that you love with all of your heart. But all of the sudden, the inspiration caught that logos and transformed it into a rama word and it become your word for your battle right now. Don't you love it when God does it that way? Have you ever applied the word, whether you need healing or deliverance or whatever it is, and you say the same word over and over again. What are you doing? You're repeating logos. And then one day you get up and you quote that same scripture that you've quoted over and over again. And you quote it, but then you start seeing the manifestation of that word. Logos was being said over and over and over again. And it's accumulating. It's accumulating as it's building faith in your heart and then God will anoint that logos word and totally transforms that and it becomes a rama word and then it's your personal word. Now we realize all through the old testament that God did that for his children and of course in the new he's done exactly the same thing. I love the way brother Brandham says this and the proving of his word. This is quite a long quote so I won't read all of it just for the saving of time. I go down to paragraph 119. No matter how close you are to Jordan, no matter what your circumstances in, if you could only hold that promise of God in your heart, God will prove that it's so. In the midst of all unbelief, he'll still prove that it's so. How many believes that? And circumstances doesn't stop him. He will do the same as he has done. If his children will only take his word, notice he can prove it by you. Now you young people, do you understand that there are words that God will prove by you that he never will use to prove by brother Jason or maybe brother Paul or some of these other ministers that you look at and you have such great honor and respect for it and you should. But yet there's an allocation of the word that God has given that some of you will fulfill. I will never fulfill. Some of the people that you meet and that you rub shoulders with, you think that I'm it's up to me to go try to win them to the Lord. Up to brother Jason to go win them to the Lord. But God will have a divine allocation of his word given to your life. And guess what? Nobody can fulfill that word but you. You need to get this out of your mind that you are wasteless. That there's nothing about you that's any good. Your life is wasted. I've never accomplished anything. That is the thinking of the devil. And you need to realize you've been brought on the purpose to serve on this earth. Almighty God has a plan for every one of you. I don't care your age. I don't care your race or color. That is nothing to do with it. The Lord God loves you and he called you to be a representative of his truth in the last day. And God will use you to prove that word is absolutely the truth. Oh my. He doesn't prove it by the unbelievers. He said it cannot be proved by them because they are unbelievers. It's to him that will believe. If he can find somebody, oh Lord, I hope he can find somebody here this morning. If he can find somebody who will believe his word, he will prove his word by you. &gt;&gt; Now, you realize there's time slots by which God allocates his word. And we know that the rapture was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world. And even though Paul wrote about it, God would not use Paul's life to prove those which are alive and remain. Brother Random wanted to be one of those that was alive and remain. But God never took him to prove that word. I believe with all of my heart, I'm I'm standing right here today looking at some people that will not die. that God will use you to prove that word. Hallelujah. Those of us who are alive and remain. You understand what I'm saying? So God has certain words. He had a word for Noah. He had a word for Moses. We've heard it over and over again. He had a word for Luther. He had a word for Wesley, Pentecost, and so on. But God has words for us. And God has words for brother Brandham. And we know for years and years as message people that we focus mainly on the prophet. But we understand no matter how much we ever see our position, it will never take away from the prophet of God's place. Is that right? But the message of the hour is not just about brother Brandham. As a matter of fact, if you read Malachi 4 real close, you'll find out there's some more that is focusing on right there. Behold, I almighty God will send unto you Elijah the prophet. Do you understand? You also are in Malachi 4. It's not just Brother Brandham, but you also are in Malachi 4. Behold, I send unto you Elijah the prophet. That is your word. Hallelujah. That word has your name on it. And Satan is not going to stop it. Do you believe he could stop brother Brandham? No way. Then if he could not stop brother Brandham from fulfilling that word, you and I need to rise to the challenge of the hour and say he will not stop us. Though he tries me, though all kinds of things come my way, I will fulfill the word of God allocated for my life. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. He says if he can find somebody who will believe his word, he'll prove his word by you. And sometimes sickness and things happen to us that way that God can prove himself. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I'm telling you, I don't really enjoy them types of things. &gt;&gt; I enjoy health better than sickness. Anybody with me? &gt;&gt; Which would you rather have? A full wallet or a flat one? Would you rather have all your bills paid or all of them still laying on the counter you're going to be looking at when you go back home? &gt;&gt; Well, come on. That's our choice. Would you rather have great services and move all the time and all that or they're going to have services when it's going to be kind of dry from the start? And as a pastor, you sit back in the study and you say, "Oh no, it's going to be one of them kind." And it starts out draggy. The songs is draggy. The prayer requests are draggy. and the preacher get up and he's dragging and everybody drags home and drags out. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; And yet you say, "Oh Lord, well, after we left the camp meeting, my goodness, I can't believe the pastor's no more fiery." Well, if you'd pull on your pastor at home the way you pull on us at camp meeting, it might help your services be better. The preacher don't bring these revivals in his briefcase. The preacher does not the one that motivates it. But it's your expectation. If each one of you would go back to your home church and you get there Wednesday night and you go to say, "Glory, praise the Lord. Amen." You may have to pick the pastor up off the floor and resuscitate him, but in a few minutes he'll say, "Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus." But what is it? It's your portion. It's not the preacher that makes the service alone. Each one of you have an input. &gt;&gt; And the service right here today won't be determined by how much I studied. It will not be determined by how much I prayed. It will be determined by my part plus your part plus his part. And if we mix it all together, there ain't no telling what God will do. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now you see the Lord Jesus the prophet uses this about the little girl and we're all familiar with her whenever she died and Jesus made the proclamation that the girl is not dead. So now God has to prove his word but it was her deaths that brought that word in. &gt;&gt; I don't like them types of experiences. &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to be persecuted. Well, I've been one of them. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Y'all been one of them. Haven't you? &gt;&gt; Do you really? Is that one of your favorite things in scripture? &gt;&gt; How many wants to be hated? &gt;&gt; Cast out, talked about, run down. &gt;&gt; But somebody's got to do it. &gt;&gt; So what would most of us do? We'd go down there and select. Okay, I love this scripture. I love this one. Oh, I love Psalms 37:4. Delight yourself also on the Lord, and he'll give you the desires of thine heart. I love St. John 15:7. And if you abide in me and my words abide in you, ask what you will and it shall be done. I love the one in Matthew where Jesus said, "Hither too you've asked nothing in my name, but ask and you your joys will be full." Don't you love all them? Oh, they're so wonderful. Don't you love where Paul said, "Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in hell, even as thy soul prospers." Don't you love those things? Oh, happy is the people whose God is the Lord. Shout to the voice of the Lord with a voice of triumph. Oh, just wonderful scriptures. And then God comes over with these sad ones, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Valley scriptures. trial scriptures. &gt;&gt; And what would all of us do? Skip them. &gt;&gt; So, we're checking the box. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that one in Psalms. How good and how pleasant together it is for brethren to dwell together in unity. I love that one in Deuteronomy. Here, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. I love the one in Isaiah 35:3. Behold, your God shall come. The lame man shall leap as heart. The tongue of the dung. The tongue of the dung shall sing and they're going to rejoice and oh yes yes yes. I'll be with you. I'll never leave you. Yes. Yes. Check. Check check. &gt;&gt; But but but &gt;&gt; you will be hated &gt;&gt; of all men for my name's sake. &gt;&gt; And I skip over that one. &gt;&gt; You're going to be talked about. You're going to be run down. You're going to be despised and rejected. Right. &gt;&gt; But the truth of it is in reality, if that's what God wants from my life, Brother Jason, as much as it hurts my feelings, I want to fulfill that word. &gt;&gt; Now, most message preachers want to cast out devils. They want to heal the sick. They want to raise the dead. They want to have a great supernatural ministry. But how many message preachers want to be persecuted, run down, talked about, they want their face plastered on YouTube, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They want videos made about their preaching. I don't like that myself. Y'all y'all brothers like that? Y'all like having people run you down and telling lies on you? Nope. But you know what? Somebody's got to do it. If God wants to allocate that word to my life, then forget what I want. Forget what I think. Forget my personal preference. Well, come on. Let's have church this morning. What about it, young people? If God is looking for a young lady that he can be able to identify himself with and let her walk through Walmart and her long hair hanging down her legs and the world make fun of her. Is there any daughters of God here? Say, "Lord, I'll take that portion. I'll take that portion." What about it, young men? You want to live a holy life, a sanctified life. You don't want to commit fornication before you get married. You want to be men that can stand and be trusted and want to be men, young men that have credibility and character and let the world say what they will. Let them life. Are there any young men here that'll say, "Lord, I'll take that word. I'll take that word, Lord. Let that word be fulfilled in my life, dear God. That if God can take you, he can prove his word by you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We spoke about Samson a little bit last night, but today I'd like to take him in a little different light. Judges 16:2 was told the Gazites, saying, "Samson is come hither." And they compassed him in and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, "In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him." That's the way the enemy does, you'll lay low and lay a trap, and then they make their brag. And Samson laid on midnight and arose at midnight and took the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts and went away with them bar and all and put them upon his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that is before Hebron. Now I quoted it last night. I said it weighed 2 thou 2,000bs. It wasn't. Actually I quoted that wrong. They carried those gates 20 miles on his shoulders. &gt;&gt; That's how far it was from Hebron to Gaza. Just so you know, it's the same Gaza today that they're fighting over. &gt;&gt; Very same one. So, this was an emblem of Christ's resurrection. Even brother Brandham talks about it. And yet, he himself goes in there. What's God going to do? Prove his word. So the gates of Gaza were actually called the gates of hell. &gt;&gt; The gates of hell. So Samson goes and takes the gates of hell and setting up a shadow or a type of our Lord Jesus to be able to conquer death, hell, and the grave. Now, &gt;&gt; I want you to notice this that these gates actually weighed an estimate they found just recently by archaeological digs and they found the part of the the remnants of those gates and the gates and the posts that they said would have been between 5 and 10 tons. So total with the gates, it was 10 to 20,000 lbs. And Samson carried the gates to Hebrron, which was 20 miles away of an elevation of 3,200 ft higher from where he wound up than where he started. Why? Because Samson was a mighty man. The prophet tells us what Samson was. He was a curly-headed little shrimp. And he called him a mama's boy. A curlyheaded shrimp. Now you think that he went to the gym like brother Diggs does. They didn't have no gyms in Samson's day. That wasn't a miracle. But if we look at Samson tonight have little curly locks hanging down his head. Most of you boys would laugh at him. Said you little I wouldn't call him that when the anointing come on him though, would you? Why? Because God had a word that was allocated through an angel messenger to Monoah, his father, and to his mother. And there wasn't no one else that could fulfill that word. Now, we looked at it last night. Samson never fully gave his heart to the Lord, but what he gave to the Lord, the Lord certainly used, didn't he? And if God could use that out of Samson, what can God do through us? Now you can imagine these gates by the estimated weight and size and the post that they found they would have had to been around 10 foot high and 10 foot wide packed by a curly-headed shrimp 4t high himself. Why? God was going to keep his word. Now remember, in spite of our failures, in spite of our shortcomings, he does it. Listen how the prophet talks about Samson and a prophet. Oh my. He said more than a prophet. He was more than that. Talking about Jesus. He said all but this man took the keys death hell in the grave like Samson did the gates of Gaza. He took it out. Took the sting and death itself and swallowed up in victory. And and oh how we thank God for what our Lord Jesus did. Don't we appreciate that? But what I find amazing is that Paul in referring to the resurrection and the rapture said, "Then shall be brought to pass this saying that death is swallowed up in victory." Then my question for you is why did not the Lord Jesus fulfill that verse? &gt;&gt; You mean to tell me that portion of the word, death is swallowed up in victory, the Lord Jesus never fulfilled that? No, it was not his word. &gt;&gt; It's yours. &gt;&gt; You know that man that sat at the gate that was lame? You know that man sat there and was sitting there when the Lord Jesus was on the earth. &gt;&gt; How many days did the Lord Jesus pass right by that man? Hallelujah. But you imagine him saying, "I'm going to save this one for my boys." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to save this one for my boys. Hallelujah. Don't you see how much he wants us to be a part of his kingdom? He could have done all the preaching. He could have done all the counseling. He could have done it all himself down through time. Eliminated all of our jobs, brothers. And he could have done it all. I'm going to be the apostle. I'm going to be the pastor. I'm going to be the teacher in every church age. I'll come down and I'll do it myself. But he said, "That ain't the way I want to do it. I want my boys to be a part of my kingdom. I want my sons to be a part of my economy. And yes, they're going to make mistakes and they're going to have bad judgment at time. But in that, I'll come right back around and deliver them. And I will prove my power through them. Even though they're going to fall and make mistakes, he knew you would fall short of the glory of God. That's why he had John to write this in the word. Little children, I write unto you that we sin not. But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the father, which is Jesus Christ the righteous, which is the perpetuation of our sins, and not ours only, but the sins of the whole world. He don't want you to do wrong, but he knew you'd mess up, but he also gave you a way back. And when you come back, you're still fulfilling scripture. You're still fulfilling because you're being cleansed by the washing of the water of the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, let me move to one of my favorite characters of the Bible. Probably a lot of you as well. Little David. I love this little guy. He was quite quite amazing, quite simple. The Bible says he was ready. R U D Y which means kind of reddish skinned maybe not a handsome so much sort of a fella little scrawny guy. Now notice in 1st Samuel 17:4, "And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath." Now young people, I'm not here today to magnify the devil or his demons, &gt;&gt; brother. But I am here to let you know we have quite an adversary. &gt;&gt; And Peter tells us about that adversary. And he said he goes about as a roaring lion. But you know, if you know anything about lions, you know that whenever they're on the attack, I was in the Serengeti several years ago in a safari and riding with a brother who was a game warden of the Serengeti, a message brother. and we come out and we could go with him in places that everybody else couldn't go. So, we go out through the plains of the Serengeti. We actually get to take a balloon ride over it as well. But we're out there riding and I I see this this lioness and she's laying up upon a an antill. And there are some of those antills can be 8, 10, 12t high, but this one was about three and a half feet. And I saw the gazelle, the impala, the gimsbuck, the different animals that were around. And this lioness was laying like in the edge near some acacia trees. And I asked the brother, I said, "Why is she laying right right in the in the open like that? What is she doing?" And he said, "She's only a decoy." So he took his binoculars and he started scanning around and looking and looking and there's lots of tall grass, yellow tall grass. And the color of the the skin, the hair of the lion will merge right into the color of the grass. He said, "Right here. Here. Let me." So he gave me the glasses and I looked and whenever I saw there was all the rest of them and they were laying down, hunched down &gt;&gt; starting to move, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And they were heading toward all of those animals that were there. And they all had their eyes on that one. And where he found them was over here behind them. Not one of those hundreds of animals was looking in that direction. &gt;&gt; And there was the enemy sneaking up behind them. &gt;&gt; But they had a decoy. &gt;&gt; Now remember that Peter said he is as a roaring lion. &gt;&gt; But you know how the lion attacks, crouching, sneaking. Oh my. That's our enemy. But greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. But my point is, don't just watch this area and that area and that area, but watch all around you. Because our enemy has done this for thousands of years. Remember, our enemy today are the same demons that come against the people in Noah's day, in Lot's day, in Abraham's day, in Wesley's day. They are experienced. They have been fighting human beings and defeating them by the billions &gt;&gt; for thousands of years. &gt;&gt; And you're some of you are 18, 20, 25. How in the world could you ever face such experienced &gt;&gt; beings? &gt;&gt; Well, because you're serving a more experienced God. That's how. &gt;&gt; Now, if you try it on your own, you're going to be defeated. Now I want you to notice how the writer of Samuel describes Goliath that he was a champion. &gt;&gt; A champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of Gath whose height was six cubits and a span. Anybody know what the word Goliath means? Splendor. The devil knows how to name his boys, don't he? So six cubits in a span would have been 9 feet and 9 in 9 ft and I'm about 6 foot. So you imagine three foot added to my height. Now he had a big old massive head. His fingers were 14 in long. You imagine that dude had eyeballs about that big around. I mean, they just be down on you. And boy, when he come out, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. All he had to do was appear and everybody else disappeared. &gt;&gt; Anybody ever faced a champion like that? &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Some of you brothers, you're still battling pornography. You're battling lust. You're battling this and that. Remember, it's the same demons that was allocated out of hell that have come against many of our brothers down through the ages before us. &gt;&gt; They know exactly what they are doing. But so do we. We are not ignorant concerning Satan's devices. This is one thing we want you to leave with after these series of meetings that you are equipped because your battles will come and your difficulties will come. But we don't have to leave in fear and we don't have to say, "Well, I'm going to I'm just going to stay here at the camp forever." No. Remember Moses up on top of the mountain and the very hand of God come down and wrote the law. And when he come down off of that, what was he facing? The rebellion of the people and the idolatry of the people. Even his own brother made idols and said, "These be thy gods, oh Israel. Come straight out of the presence of God right down to a turmoil. Only God knows what each of you will face when you go back home. But let me give you a word today from the Lord. I will never leave thee, nor will I forsake thee. I will be with thee all the way to the end of the world. No matter what you go through, Jesus is going to help you. &gt;&gt; Now, let's look at this guy. Verse five. and he had a helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed with a coat of male. The weight of the coat was 5,000 shekels of brass. So he has a 30B helmet on his head. You imagine packing that thing around all day. Now in verse six, he had grieavves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass between his shoulders. So Goliath wore a bronze helmet and a coat of scale armor like fist scales weighing 5,000 shekels which is 125 pounds. That's more than David weighed. Brother Bam said he weighed 110. So just just this outweighed David. If they would stand and give you their resume, &gt;&gt; it would scare us to death. &gt;&gt; Cuz they could say, "I talked this man into doing this, and I talked this mighty man into doing that. I done this, and I've done that, and you think you're going to face me." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Well, should we all just camp out in here and not leave? &gt;&gt; Could all the cooks bring us something to eat so we don't starve to death while we're in here? tomorrow. Just stay in here and huddle up in a huddle. &gt;&gt; Watch it, brother. Watch it. Watch it. &gt;&gt; That's not what you're called to do. &gt;&gt; You're another generation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, we know the third generation, the fourth generation, and I believe that. But I also know there has always been exceptions in every one of those generations. And we are the exception, young people. There will be some, there is no doubt about it. There will be some in the third and fourth generation in the message that will go that way. But that don't have to be you. It will only be you if you choose to go that way &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; now. It has a long spear and it has a 15B iron tip on the end of it. You brothers that bow hunt, can you imagine shooting something like that? and all his armor would have weighed in the neighborhood of about 200 lb. Now notice in verse 7, and the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and his spear head weighed 600 shekels of iron, and one bearing a shield went before him. I love the way brother Renham describes him. and three kinds of believers. A great big giant like that walking up with a weaver's needle, which they claim to be around 20 feet. So he could stand right here and shave you, brothers. He could stand right here and cut your coat off and cut the cuffs out of your shirt. &gt;&gt; And you've got what? &gt;&gt; Yes. Bless. &gt;&gt; And actually, this one came from the little creek where David picked his up at. I was there several years ago and got several pockets full. &gt;&gt; In the valley of El. Now ask yourself, what would that be in comparison to a spear &gt;&gt; 20 ft long, 15 pound broadhead? Every buck in the country would take off running, wouldn't he? A helmet 30 lb and you are going to throw something like this at him. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. He had a 20ft spear in his hand. A man like that could stand there and pick up a dozen men and throw them. Look at verse eight. He stood and cried unto the armies of Israel and said unto them, "Why are you come out to set the battle in array? Am not I Philistine, you servants of Saul? Choose you a man for you and let him come down." So, a nonarmored Goliath would have weighed approximately 760 pounds. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all saying that ain't nothing compared to the Goliath Iway face. He's 1500. He's 2,000. He's 2500. It don't make no difference if he if he looks like 5,000 lbs. God can still whoop him. And you can too, young people. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, a nonarmored Goliath would have weighed around 6760 lbs. Adding the weight of his armor, another 125 or so, would have been 885 lbs. With his spear, shield, helmet, he would have been easily 900b. And you're 110. with your daddy's shoes on, which gives you more weight. And he took his staff in his hand and chose him, notice now verse 40, this is what David did, five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag, which he had, even in a script, and his sling was in his hand, and he drew near to the Philistine. This boy must be nuts. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was determined to use what he was familiar with. &gt;&gt; Now friends, remember the prophet said, "The only weapon the devil has is to try to make you doubt your weapon." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Now, we make Satan almost omnipotent on the mission. We got we give him all these attributes and he is not any of that. He's not all knowing. He is not omnipresent. He's not all of that. And he has no power against you. The power he's got is to get you to doubt your smooth stone. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Well, I don't mind telling you he's got a lot to use against us. I never weighed this particular one because I've got several back there in my briefcase. But a few ounces, maybe a few ounces. What would that be? Now, psychologically, I'm going to sit down and do the maths and the equation. What would be the odds David would win? &gt;&gt; What's going to be the odds that you're going to overcome these demons which have been loosed out of hell? As far back as 1961, the prophet said, "The lid, the lid has been tore off the kettle &gt;&gt; and demon powers are streaming in every direction." &gt;&gt; And what are the odds that you and I could face champions? Cuz that's what they are in their ranks. But God loves to take young people &gt;&gt; and defeat Goliath. Now listen to me. Goliath was a teenager. He was not an agent ancient preacher that had been preaching for 45 years. Glory to God. I've been around and I've seen this and I've done that. Hallelujah. But he's a teenage boy. &gt;&gt; Teenager. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But David had a word from God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And Saul couldn't fulfill it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, the battlefield is in the valley of Eli. Now notice in verse 41. And the Philistine came and drew near unto David. Big mistake. And the Philist and the man that bear the shield went before him. And when the Philistine looked about and saw you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He disdained him. Look at the meaning of the word there. Disdain. to despise, hold in contempt, to be despicable, to be vile, worthless. For he was but a youth. I want you to think of it, you young people. As far as we know, David never got to go to a youth camp. Can you imagine if David would have been here this weekend? The deacons had had to take him out of the church. &gt;&gt; I mean, when this music got to going and you you got to swinging around and praising God and waving your hand, he'd have been running around here everywhere. He was an odd sort of a peculiar type of a guy that loved worship. He loved going to church and he didn't even have the Holy Ghost. Can you imagine if David would have been here and brother Ronnie opened that service up and brother Diggs preached and brother Paul did here and David would have been running and screaming said, "What in the world is the matter with you young people? What in the world is the matter with you?" And I stood there that day in the valley of El. I stood by myself. I had no brothers. I had no sisters. I stood by myself. My brothers was against me. My king was against me. Anybody with common sense was against me. You young people, they've had this youth camp for you. Oh my. What would David tell you? Rise and take the rocks out of your pockets. Take the rocks out of your pockets, young people. Take your script, take your weapons, take what God's given you, and leave this camp today and face your enemy. [Applause] And the Philistines said unto David, "Am I a dog?" David could have said, "Amen." That thou comest to me with staves. And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. And the Philistines said to David, "Come to me and I'll give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field." Then said David to the Philistine, "Thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield." What you notice, David doesn't mention an extra extra extra large sword or an extra extra extra large spear. He just puts it in the same category. spear, sword, whatever, broadhead, you know, here you come. Oh, hallelujah. You know, it all depends upon how you're looking at your enemy. Saul looked at him and said, "Lord have mercy. How in the world could anybody ever face a man like that?" And his brothers looked at him and said, "Are you out of your mind, David?" But you imagine David coming up and look at him and said, "Good Lord, brothers, a target that big, how in the world could you ever miss him?" Amen. and he's a big old guy, but I figure the bigger they are, the harder they fall. When God brings him down, it will be a testimony to the power of God. Oh, yo people, how are you going to face your champion? How are you going to face your Goliath? Don't make his boast big. Don't make his equipment against you big, but acknowledge the power of God, the resurrection of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And David said to the Philistian, "Thou comest to me with a sword &gt;&gt; and with a shield, but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts." Bashim, Bashim, Jehovah of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel. What did David come in the name? I love the way the prophet says it in his report. The word interpreted &gt;&gt; is the manifestation of the name of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The Hebrews looked at it different than we do to them. The name was a representation and attributes of the character of the individual. That's why they'd rename people sometimes because they realized they had the wrong name when they were born and it didn't match who they really were. We had the wrong name, too. That's why the prophet in the Siluku said, "I no longer call you church, but I call you bride." We're renamed. Hallelujah. And we're not just saying the name of Jesus. We are part of that great name because we are his bride and he is our bridegroom and we have his name. Come on, somebody. That's why he said they can yell and scream the name of Jesus and they get nothing but we're revealed in the thunders. He said, which is what? The voice of God uttering the message of the day. Listen, young people, you're not fighting alone. The angels of God are with you. If we could have looked down the valley of El, there would have been angels on that side and that side. All around David, everywhere are the angels of God. Why? He's not fighting just his own battle. &gt;&gt; His victory is going to change everybody in the camp. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. [Applause] I love this Hebrew word. Your brothers probably know it. But what Goliath expected from David was certainly not what he got because David expressed the ineffable ineffable name which means it's indescribable. It's indescribable. It's impossible to describe the fullness of the meaning of the name. And this boy didn't even have the Holy Ghost. Let's get this giant killed so we can leave. Verse 46. This day the Lord will deliver thee into mine hand, and I will smite thee, and take thy head from thee, and I will give the carcass of the host of the Philistines." Now he jumps from one giant to the whole army. You imagine anybody hear him said he's beside himself. &gt;&gt; Poor guy. He's gone crazy. I mean, he's standing out there and he's attacking that now. Every one of us is going to pay for this girl. He's brought all this down on every one of them. Lord have mercy. No, you're fixing to taste his victory. What's fixing to happen to you? It wasn't God that delivered them because of that mighty army and Saul or even David's brothers. All he needed was one teenager. Lord have mercy. All he needed was one teenager that would say God can still move and God. Oh, you say I revive. Our church don't have a revival. Let one teenager full of the Holy Ghost leave this camp and go back to your church and revival can break out. Hallelujah. Revival can break out in your family. I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philist. I want you to notice he's describing two different hosts here. Now he says the Lord of hosts and then he describes the host of the Philistines. He knows who's the most powerful. I will feed them to the this day, to the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the field, that all the earth may know that there's a David in the camp. But he's the greatest man of God. I'll tell you one thing, he's the all the earth may know that there is a God &gt;&gt; in Israel. Your gifts, your gifts, my gifts, all the gifts of the brothers, they are not for us. They are not to glorify us. They are not to edify us. They are that the end time may know there is a God in the bride. And there is a people on the earth that believe he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; It's not for building a kingdom for some preacher, right? Amen. &gt;&gt; From this point on, I'm not responsible for my actions. &gt;&gt; Go ahead, brother. and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword &gt;&gt; and spear. &gt;&gt; For the battle is the Lord's. &gt;&gt; That is such a great revelation from God for you when you realize demons don't hate you because your name is Smith or Watkins or Raiken or Brown or whatever it is. They hate you because you belong to God. Satan has always hated everything that God loved. Everything that God gave special favor to, Satan has hated them. He hates you because you belong to God. And that makes your battles God's battles. They are not yours on your own. But the battle is the Lord's. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he will give you into our hands. I can follow a man like this right here, but it's not all about him. &gt;&gt; Now, all these hours are sending back. &gt;&gt; Is that your brother? I don't even know that boy. Are you kidding me? &gt;&gt; Oh, actually cut the head off that. Glory to God. That's my brother David. Praise be to God. That strength runs in our family. Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; But notice a real valiant leader. &gt;&gt; He wants the whole army. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To enjoy the taste of victory. &gt;&gt; Young people, the preachers, the preachers are not here so that they can impress you, &gt;&gt; right? that are so you can leave and say, "Oh, wow. What great men of God." &gt;&gt; They want you to taste &gt;&gt; of the victory. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He will give you into our hands. And it came to pass when the Philistine arose and came and drew nigh to meet David that David hasted &gt;&gt; and ran. toward the enemy. &gt;&gt; I tell the army of God, no angels, no ran toward the army to meet the Philistines. One man, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Not even a man, a boy, &gt;&gt; a teenager. &gt;&gt; Teenager, sir. &gt;&gt; You imagine his brother said, I mean, he's he's crazy. and him going out through there. He must have been drunk as a dog on the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Where is that devil? I said he's been in the wine. &gt;&gt; He snuck in the communion wine. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. And he's going to go out there. Oh Lord, he'll be an absolute embarrassment for the rest of my life. He actually made their family famous for the rest of their life and beyond their life. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God for men of God. Thank God for young people. a young boy, young girl that's willing to rise above the the reproach sometimes that you live under your family and under the reproach of this and that and said, "That has nothing to do with me. That has nothing to do with me. God call me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah." &gt;&gt; And David hasted and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. Now, I pull my rock out a little bit prematurely. Sorry, I got a little bit excited there a while ago. So, David is actually running toward him and he ain't even loaded yet. &gt;&gt; Your brother's imagining meeting a big old grizzly bear and you're just standing up and said, "Come on, big boy. I'm going to load up whenever I want to." Yeah, right. I hope I ain't hunting with you. And David put his hand in his bag and took fence of stone and slang it. Now that's the kind of slang I like [Laughter] and smoke the Philistine in his forehead. right? &gt;&gt; Which is the only place his helmet didn't cover a very very tiny spot. And now us brothers, we've got dot scopes, we got laser this, we've got this, that, and the other, you know, and my, we're so proud of our military because they've got these smart bombs. And God, man, these guys are thousands of years behind. God's been using smart rocks for years and years and years. [Applause] Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Now, I bet you David was very good at it, but it probably outdid his ability. &gt;&gt; No doubt you fought many things, but the thing you're facing today, it may be bigger than you this time. &gt;&gt; But don't worry, our God still has special armorament. &gt;&gt; He took the fence, the stone, and slang it and smoked the Philistine. in the forehead and the stone sunk. You talking about crosseyed in a second. I want you to notice how he fell, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he fell upon his face, &gt;&gt; right? With this velocity, there's no way he should have fallen on his face. He's been hit by a smart bomb from God, which was moving at 1,000 miles a second. &gt;&gt; Brothers, what would you pay for that kind of bullet? or said, "Where'd you get that?" I get it from the prophet of God. Cuz he said he set that loose and the Holy Ghost got a hold of that little stone and he picked up a speed of about a thousand miles a second and struck that giant right between the face and he fell forward. You imagine a thousand miles a second? Those of you brothers that hunt and you know that you hit a deer and oh sometimes it'll knock it or whatever. My I've shot animals in Africa and whenever you hit them it'll blow them plum off of their feet. You imagine something a thousand miles a second even with something no bigger than this. All science and all mechanics and all everything else should have he should have fell backward. But God said I'm going to humiliate you in your death cuz I'm going to have you bow. I'm going to have you fall face forward. Not so much to David. Hallelujah. But to the God of Israelel. Who will bow for listening? &gt;&gt; Let's say hallelujah. May I say before the bride leaves this world, every devil in hell, &gt;&gt; every devil &gt;&gt; will have been overcome. If one devil is left exempted from the bride setting her foot in his face and on his head and crushing him, that one devil be able to march before the throne of God at our rapture wedding supper and say blah blah. Nobody in the bride could conquer me. But sad to say, we don't get to choose our temptations. We don't get to choose our faults. Brother Bam called it the human grabag. For those of you that are tempted sexually, let me tell you what God's prophet said. He said the Lord Jesus suffered &gt;&gt; sexual temptation. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, how can overcome? He said he was tempted by women. &gt;&gt; He was tempted by drinking. &gt;&gt; He was tempted in all points like as we are. Lust will be slain in this last day. &gt;&gt; Pornography will be slain in this last day. &gt;&gt; Suicide will be cl will be slain in this last day. The spirit that gets on some of our young people, mainly our sisters, and has them cutting theirel, that devil will be slain. Remember the man in the tombs cut himself. It's not a sign of the spirit of God. It is a devil sisters that tries to get on you. Oh hallelujah. Ministers, deacons, trustees, lay members, song leaders, every one of us together as the army of God will be able to look all hell in the face. I won't as an individual. you want as an individual, but collectively all of us will be able to look at all at hell and say, "You were defeated." You were defeated. Lying, adultery, fornication, every devil, there won't be one that will escape. [Applause] So take your rocks out of your pockets &gt;&gt; and quit throwing them at each other. Use them for what they were given to you for. &gt;&gt; Don't you know David could have killed Saul? Don't you know David could have killed his brothers that spoke against him? But David knew this rock wasn't meant for his brothers. &gt;&gt; We need one another like never before. &gt;&gt; Let me close. To me, it's as it was when Geronimo and the Apache Indians had been taken by our government. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They lied to them, &gt;&gt; broke their treaties time and time again. And it was the Cherikawa Apaches, some of them that actually led the army, the United States Army to get Geronimo. They could have never done it on their own. And their brothers had a hard time with that. But you know what they' done to them? Whenever Geronimo finally surrendered, they put them on the train. They're going to send them to Florida &gt;&gt; to take them out of their homeland. That's exactly what Satan wants to do to you young people. He wants to take you out of your homeland. The message of the hour. &gt;&gt; I will fight for my homeland. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I will not sit around and be passive. Well, let them say whatever they want to say. Let them do No, sir. This is my homeland. I will fight for it. &gt;&gt; I ain't talking about our fists. I'm talking about the spiritual battle. They put the rest of those Apaches on the train and they felt like they had betrayed them in one sense of the word. You can see where they would. But they started raising their voices one against the other and was going to fight. And Geronimo looked at him and said, "There's so few of us left. &gt;&gt; There's so few of us left. We don't need to be fighting one another. &gt;&gt; I'm gonna tell you something. You get a message preacher against you, that man, oh man, he can be quite an enemy. &gt;&gt; Don't you see what Satan's done to us? Our studies, our capabilities, and if we're not careful, we're turn our own rocks right against ourselves. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Let's marry together. How many like to be remembered today before the Lord? As you leave this place today, young people, not just young, but all the rest of us. Maybe you know that enemy would be waiting for us, but that's quite all right. By God's grace, we'll face him. Honestly, we wouldn't stand before the Lord, would we? Would we want to? and God have to baby us and protect us and keep us in some type of shell. Never let hard things come our way. And then the martyrs walk up beside us. And after all they went through and we stood there and say, "Well, you know, I I was such a baby. God never could try me." I don't want that. No, I'm not asking for trouble. No, I'm not. But brother Bram said, "When we sit at that table and we'll reach across that table and take a hold of them battle scarred veterans, you remember the story whenever one of the great Caesars was going to have a a vic victory ride and you know what they would do? They would take the kings of the cities they' conquered and the men of great importance and put them behind Caesar's chariot and let them walk up through and show them how victorious they were. And Caesar was going to choose a man of his military that would ride with him. So all the generals trim their plumes and they polish their brass. He goes out and looks at him. He walks by a guy that's not a general, not a great man, scars all over him, wounded. And he said, "Where did you get those scars?" He said, "In the battle for my Lord Caesar," he said, "You climb up on the chariot and ride with me." Hallelujah. When that resurrection takes place, Paul, Antipus, all those martyrs will come out of there. Oh, children, we don't want to rise out with no scars on us. We want to reach across the table and look at one another. And all of a sudden, we'll feel this awesome presence. And we'll look up and here he comes. It's Jesus. I may be the last one at the end of that table, &gt;&gt; 1500 miles long and way down at the end. I'll sit there and Carol will sit by me. &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus will come to all you all and give you your award and he'll thank you for what you've done. He'll work his way down and come to me and Carol. And as he stands there, my tears rolling down my eyes, the prophet said he'll take his robe and reach up there and wipe them tears from your eyes and say, "Don't cry no more, child. It's over." &gt;&gt; Oh, all these battles that you fought, young people, all these things that you've went through for the cause of the Lord Jesus, it'll be worth it then. It'll be worth it. Heavenly Father, these precious darlings of God, what a great privilege it's been, Lord, to speak to him for just a couple of services. Dear God, to be able to associate with my brethren here. I want to stand with him in a former fashion the way that brother Brandham saw Brother Neville and the different people coming up and he said, "Oh, I know that brother. I know that brother." and watch him go up a young man, his mate in his arm, and then his name was called. He said, "I thought I'd never I'd have to walk that way." Lord, when all my brothers go up and you reward them, Father, and I know what it is to be a pastor, to be a preacher when much of the burdens that you bear not of your own, much of the thing that you go through in life, it's not self-inflicted. It's not because of yourself, but it's because of your sheep. But I know you well enough to know, Father, you're not beholding to any man. So one day, these ministers of the gospel will walk up. I want to be standing near them. Lord, when brother Jason, Sister Debbie walk up, these men of God and their wives. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. And we sat down at that table and the tears are wiped from our eyes. Oh Lord God, don't let me be missing. Father, let me be there that day. Lord Jesus, how many would say that to the Lord? Lord, I want to be there. Raise your hand to him this morning. Let heaven see your hand lift it up. Let heaven hear your voice. Tell him, Lord, I want to be there so bad. I want to be there, Lord Jesus. Oh father, we worship you today. Lord, Lord, we would be afraid to face these demons on our own, but we don't have to face them on our own. We can face them with you in us. I commit this camp to you, these people, these ministers, all the workers, everyone. Father, would you bless them? One day when the books are open and we'll stand there and this meeting will be recalled and you'll go to handing out rewards to the ministers and all the workers and those that serve the food and those in the kitchen and you'll not let it go unnoticed. Father, for there is a book of remembrance written in heaven. We love you, Lord Jesus. Keep us by your grace. I pray. God bless you saints. I love you so much. The weapon may be formed, but it won't prosper. Oh, when the darkness falls, it won't prevail. Cuz the God I serve knows only how to triumph. Oh my God will never fail. Oh my God will never fail. Oh, I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory for the battle belongs to you, Lord. Oh, I'm going to see a victory. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm going to see I'm going to see the victory. Victory worship for the battle belongs to the Lord. Oh, there's power in the mighty name of Jesus. [Music] Oh, every war he wins, he will win. He's going to win. Oh, I'm not packing down any giants. Here's what I know. Cuz I know how the story is. [Music] Oh, I know how the story is. [Applause] I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory. Oh yeah. For the battle belongs to you, Lord.
