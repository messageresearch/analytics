live by his mercies we live by the mercies of the lord jesus christ aren't you glad for that so you just pray for me this morning i was up early doing my call-in bible study and i was hacking and coughing and and my i thought i had my microphone muted and i didn't they were hearing me i thought oh well anyway the gospel has got to go forward so we greet you all in the name of the lord today and we're happy to have you here amen praise the lord happy to have brother anthony's family with us amen praise the lord so hopefully we can hang on to them a little while this time amen as they're among us and god bless you god bless you amen happy to have you all here today and we're going to invite you to leviticus chapter 25 a pretty easy to book a book to find right in the beginning of your bible amen all my old sunday school students remember janice's exodus leviticus we learned it as a song amen so we want to um take this thought that uh the lord put on my heart and anthony uh i left my water the very one i want that propellers on my desk if you'll bring me that amen and so i just again i covet your prayers and that you'll pray for me if i cough and hack oh well we'll blow it out and it'll be fine amen the return to our jubilee this is what i want to speak on today the return to our jubilee brother branham took three different sermons uh concerning the jubilee and one of the last ones that he took was return and jubilee because you know the the what the what the world has failed to understand is is the jubilee god kept his promise to the early church he offered that jubilee to israel and they declined it and they crucified the lord of glory the one who brought him the jubilee it's everything they had waited on you know for thousands of years and at the finish line they fell apart that's a sad sad reality but it worked into the plan of god to allow the gentiles to come in which god foresaw that and warned them it would happen in the old testament he talked about that he would bring up a people he'd make israel jealous because he'd call a people that were not formerly his people and that be the gentile heathens so we realized that they declined it and god poured it out upon the new testament church in the upper room amen and of course we know by the teaching of the scripture that um that that first church age just like israel they backslid committed adultery on christ and instead of christ being able to come back and take that bride home in a rapture he had to sit back down in the eternities intercede for 2000 years seal the word up under seven seals make it mysterious so just like he did in the garden of eden when he guarded the way to the tree of life wasn't guarding a path or a trail it was guarding the revelation of christ because the people were fallen and he couldn't let them partake of that tree of life in a falling condition because then they would live forever in a fallen condition so there's no way to do that so he he guards the way to the tree of life with the cherub and with flaming sword and of course that was the spirit of christ those cherubs that's what they were and so uh just backgrounding before we get going and then of course jesus was still using that exact same flaming sword in his day and he would say things like except you eat the flesh of the son of man drink his blood you have no life in you what was he doing guarding the way they couldn't take that it blew their mind they walked away said this is hard saying we can't follow this exactly and and you know he would he would say things like you know you see the son of man standing here but the son of man is in heaven and they couldn't put all that together and you know he would he would say why can you not understand my speech and my words why are they foreign to you it's because you're of your father the devil and so he's guarding the ways guarding the way because the only one that can give you access to the tree of life is the spirit of christ aren't you glad for that you should be glad it's protected it's protected see because that means that when you get to heaven it's going to be a perfect place because nobody else can get there without that revelation and there's no way to get that revelation unless he reveals it to you amen so it is a protected and it is a deeply guarded secret the revelation of the mystery of god and so we're look gonna so so when we find out then that that that the power under that jubilee and all the access that that jubilee was to give the church and lead them to a body change never happened in that first stage see that alpha h fell away but he promised at the end time in the omega he would restore the jubilee he would bring us back to the faith of the fathers amen which was the jubilee which was the abstract title deed remember the book of life that adam lost control of satan grabbed a hold of it but it vanished from him and it appeared again in heaven because brother and said his filthy hands couldn't hold it oh we're going somewhere today friends i hope you all are buckled up praise the lord i'm preaching ahead of reading my text but i wanted to just background you a little bit before we get going so you don't get lost in the shuffle amen leviticus 25 38-42 amen i am the lord your god which brought you forth out of the land of egypt to give you the land of canaan and to be your god not wonderful that was his whole purpose and if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be wax and poor and be sold unto thee thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant but as a hired servant and as a sojourner he shall be with thee and shall serve thee unto the year of jubilee and then shall he depart from thee both he and his children with him above that and shall return unto his own family and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return that's a promise for us friends we're headed back to the possession of our early fathers and our children with us amen hallelujah for they are my servants which i brought forth out of the land of egypt they shall not be sold as bondmen father we thank you for your word today and i'm praying that you'll be with me lord and this enemy trying with these lying symptoms but lord i've i've decided today that the prophet taught me that if i've got a situation or a problem just find me a bible character that had the same situation directly or indirectly and just do what he did and you'll come out the same way at the same deliverance and so when i look back at jonah and and i'm glad to pick jonah because nobody had worse circumstances than jonah and lord of jonah could come out of it then surely i can come out of this and jonah made a decision he actually decided he said and thought about it and he proactively decided to call the symptoms of the lie and he called the promise true he oh and he said the promise was the reality i'll look again toward jerusalem and i'll pray because he promised me that if i did that he would hear and he literally took the symptoms that were tangible and real and he made a proactive decision to call them the lie and decided to call the word the truth and believe it and it brought him out so today lord i'm calling these symptoms the lie and i'm calling your promise that by your wounds i'm healed by your stripes lord i am made well and so i commit it now to you i ask you to take over lord this vessel and use it unworthy as it is but i stand under the bloodstained banner today lord the blood's speaking for us thanks be to god we commit ourselves into your hands for service now in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated so leviticus is a wonderful promise that details the difference and it makes a sharp difference between a bond servant and a hired servant and we find that the reason that god would not allow god is making a difference between his family and every other human being in the earth and he's not embarrassed about that he doesn't he's not shy about that he's not uh you know he's not worried that that's politically incorrect he doesn't care uh what the rest of the world thinks he makes a difference between his family and everyone else in the world and he says now if it's somebody who's not a member of my family you're welcome to make them a bond servant but you can't make my family that they have to be a hired servant in other words they they're not just going to be out they're not going to be your bond servant you know just working off a debt they're actually hired by you they're still a israelite they're still your brother and you're actually helping them get through a rough time and as soon as the jubilee comes the dead is settled and they go free with their kids and all their possessions because they're they're still the person i purchased and brought out of egypt and it doesn't matter today that we have come in a fallen condition we're still children of god it doesn't matter that i came born the wrong way and i needed a savior i'm still a son of god it doesn't matter that i found myself poor sometimes spiritually and i make mistakes and you make mistakes but i'm still a son of god and and god is commanding the enemy my children are different yes they're born in sin yes they're trapped in a body yes the the demon powers are all over the earth but they're still my children who i bought and no amount of no amount of of reality that they live in now temporarily in this earth and and and they wouldn't be here they'd rather be at home in glory but they're here because i put them here it's in my plan but just know this satan i'm gonna get them back all of their children back all of their possessions back my family loses nothing nothing the jubilee restores everything say what does it restore to me brother jason give it to me in plain language the jubilee restores to you everything that god saw of you in his vision before the foundation of the world but a fallen birth hindered that and took it and things happened to you and you even were complicit in some of it and things didn't go always go good and you're sometimes you're a victim of your own feet to run swiftly to mischief sometimes the devil sometimes a family sometimes a church but whatever the devil has put upon you and has hindered that vision i'm here to tell you this return to jubilee is bringing you back to that full measure of everything you were ever intended to be there's not one part of you not one anything that god saw you have to remember god's words are eternal which means they're fixed which means they can't change that's why he's the same yesterday and forever see and that that's why that's why when the lamb was slain i was dealing with this in the in the morning bible study when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world there was that was fixed there was no way jesus wasn't going to perform that because that had to be because it it already was before it was it had to be because it already had been you understand and and that's what we find today friends i started in god i'm finishing in god i came from the mind of god i'm going back to the mind of god and there and that's what the jubilee has returned to you today that's what this message has returned to you rejoice for the bride hath made herself ready this is why we we need to take authority over the enemy in our homes and in our lives and in our families and let him know the jubilee is back and i've been restored back to a position of authority in christ i owe the devil nothing i owe him nothing he has no say in my life i don't i'm not interested in a treaty with him i'm not interested in any kind of uh armistice i i i won't kill him and every blow i hit is i'm trying to i'm trying for the knockout amen i i he's trying to kill me and i'm trying to kill him and this this is this is not a game this is for blood oh i'm here to tell you friends i'm glad that i'm part of the family of god because in the mind of god i already won hallelujah brother branham says in the message in 1962 returning jubilee now in a type or a figure we take israel because it's the jubilee time and the church was given a portion which was christ himself that was poured out by the holy spirit into each heart that would receive it and become sons of god now that was the promise that israel was given that they declined as a nation that he said there come a day when i know you've got that law you've got that tables of stone but there's there's coming a day he prophesied in in many many places where i'm going to take out the heart of stone and i'm going to put in a heart of flesh now what is he saying i'm going to actually come and live inside you i'm not just going to be above you and you're keeping some law of moses i'm going to come and live inside you but before i can do that i gotta come live with you to be a kinsmen to be a propitiation to be an atonement to be your total satisfaction so that god can come and live inside you because you give your life to me so this was the promise under the jubilee the church was given a portion he says which was christ himself that was poured out by the holy spirit to each heart that would receive it and become sons of god now israel was a servant to god they was given a possession and this possession was not given to anyone else it was to be to israel only palestine belonged to them so there is an assurance in the jubilee and you know when when we look and say well the jubilee then is found in the holy ghost today no well you know what all what all did it guarantee me what what did it guarantee the receiver who received and entered into this time of jubilee excuse me i'll have to make an adjustment this thing is too far out and a little bit of popping so it guaranteed a promise that his chosen people which were the jews that the promise of god in the world to come they were they were prophesied about a millennial reign when there would come the the house of david would pr would would put a king on the throne that would rule and reign for a thousand years and that there would be you know new heavens and new earth and there's nothing you read in the new testament that's inconsistent with what the promise was in shadow in the old testament they have a perfect correlation between them and so we're prompt they were promised that his chosen people would be the leading tribe of the earth in the millennium under the son of david ruling from jerusalem this is why israel was looking for messiah when they're under the boot of the roman nation of the roman empire and they're looking for messiah to come and establish the rule of the son of david and run the romans out and reestablish the kingdom of israel because remember that israel is a type of you in many ways one of the ways that we point out often is that israel was placed in the in the center of of of heathen culture and they were dropped right in the center of it i mean after the flood and the noah and his family come out and then they begin to year out and age out and die off and sham was the last one to die and then right after there you find samira miss and nimrod and you find the valley of shinard you've got a uh you know you've got a a tower of babel and and and history this is ancient history and it's going to go forward and eventually congeal into the babylonian nation which would then become a tool in the hand of god because god had called abraham out of that chaldean religion and set him apart as a family in the earth and said in thy seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed and so now you've got a family of god in the earth by faith because he believed god came right out of heathenism and then you've got the forming up all the while you're moving toward babylon as a leading gentile power and eventually down the road they're gonna clash israel's gonna become a nation i'm gonna have to really uh be careful with my voice if i blow it out here at the beginning i'll never get to what i really want to get to so i'm gonna try to slow down a little bit and save my voice a little bit so just follow along with me if it's a less dynamic just try to stay awake anyway amen and so so it should intrigue you i love this stuff but because you can see it parallel in history you take prophecy in scripture and overlay it with history and it's flawless this is the greatest history book ever been written it's history and prophecy and the the i have confidence in the prophecy because i see the history it point for point stroke for stroke line for line it's flawless and perfect and there's no way to have made it up because it was written thousands of years uh you know and and and we see it come to pass a thousand years written thousands of years ahead of it coming to pass and then it came to pass see and so so you can imagine then why i have confidence in its prophecies about tomorrow and what it's telling me i'm in today and where and it's telling me this is my day and there's a message here and there's there's to be a people to believe it how do you know it's true because i'm here and i believe it and if i'm the only one going then i'm still a believer say what about us well you need to have that singular faith that if there's only one it's going to be me amen just be careful i'll sneak up on you and club you amen because i'm going in amen so so we find out that they're going to finally congeal into a nation called the jews david's going to sit on a throne solomon's going to follow him it's going to be a type of the millennium almost for the venom said like a millennium unfortunately after that they're going to begin to backslide just like the early church did see and so we're we're going to find you know they had already even been asking for a king you know was was tantamount that's where brother branham drew the correlation of nicea with the old testament when they asked for a king and the prophet tried to say god is your king they said yeah but we want to be like the other nations right there they committed adultery against god see and so we find out that it was just the it was inevitable that they would eventually backslide as a nation and then wouldn't you know it god just kind of accidentally had babylon right all accidentally right yeah god happened to have babylon on the scene and called nebuchadnezzar his servant because he was going to use here here comes a hebrew prophet saying lord i think it's jeremiah and he's he's so distraught over the sins of israel and he's just almost demanding lord you've got to do so this is horrible i mean they're they're full of iniquity and god comes to him comes to his prophet it wasn't jeremiah it might not have been but but anyway the narrative is the same god comes to him and says says listen i'm going to do something that if i told you what it was you wouldn't even believe it and he says what are you going to do he says i'm going to bring the king of the north and i'm going to my servant nebuchadnezzar and he's going to come in and he's going to ravage the land and take him captive and then the prophet was like no i was just kidding now don't do that i don't please don't do that but it was too late it was already in god's plan to do that see and so so but they so now they're promised they're waiting in the time of christ somebody's got to come along and restore because they've got a promise about a millennium they've got a promise of a new world they've got a promise of a restoration of the kingdom and that was going to be uh the the the climax of of the type in the bible called jubilee that was a calendar time but that was going to be fulfilled in a in a whole new world in a whole new way and and and god was going to perfect the people and give them glorified bodies but of course that couldn't come until christ came as a sacrifice and which and then and then it still had to have the upper room experience you've still got to have the upper room experience you've still got to accept christ as your personal savior you've still got to have a personal revelation of jesus christ made personal to you individually see and so so this is what the receiver was guaranteed and of course we had an old testament bride for israel say you know and there's some people say well israel's his people but brother branham there's a direct quote where brother adam calls calls him a hebrew bride and of course that makes sense you say well they were his children they were his family of course they were but once you understand the godhead is by expression then it suddenly makes sense because yeah they were his family but they were his family because they were offspring from the original seed the original seed is a spoken word and and you know when you came here by a union between a man and a woman a father and a mother and cain and abel got here that way but that's not how adam came that's not how jesus came you understand they came by the spoken word and that's why brother brennan would even say concerning jesus christ he was the son that eve would have had see by that spoken word but she ran ahead of god's program and and i was so appreciating brother jason sunday school from uh our i mean uh i think the wednesday night service uh you know talking along those lines i thought that was profound i got some comments if i have time to get to him from it this morning but we find then that he says here in jeremiah 3 14 turn o backsliding children so they're his children saith the lord for i am married to you see so and i will take you one of a city and two of a family and i will bring you to zion all right and zion is the pinnacle that's that's where we're aiming that's where we're headed that's that's what our whole our that's what gives our existence purpose is we're marching to zion beautiful beautiful zion oh my this is this is what the return of the jubilee has accomplished for you because it's put you back in that cycle headed home the early church fell but the last day church was to come back to that and carry on to a body change see so of course it would include gentiles we've dealt with that also you know because he would they he would he would include gentiles in the taking of a people for his namesake as a bride there's also the 144 000 will be attendance to the bride and i you know i i know this much friends that this word that god has sent to us in this hour is sufficient if he can just keep you quiet and still it'll dress you in the garments of the word i know that this word is a jubilee word we have returned to the faith of our fathers and it will accomplish the purpose of why it came sometimes he's just got to get you to stand still long enough and allow him to deal with your life and don't always be in such a layout of sin hurry sometimes you need to get alone with god sometimes you need to be still and know that i am god see this same word that we're receiving today brother jason how how do i know i mean i just seem to have so many areas in my life that are still weak and they're chaos and well i'm going to tell you something friends this word came on an earth that was in chaos and brought it into order it created all the heavens and the earth and and and without interference it made all things work in harmony with the very nature of the creator and that's what you see no wonder brother branham would say that you know if god had chosen uh the wind to preach the gospel or he said he could have chosen the trees to preach the gospel brother brown says frankly would have probably been done a long time ago because the wind would have just obeyed him and the trees would have just obeyed him it's mankind it's humanity that always gives him his problems we're always getting in the way we can't get out of our own way much less try to get out of his way you know this is what the gospel is for this is what church service is for this is what your bible reading is for it's what tape listings it's what fellowship does it's what prayer does it's what a prayer closet does see it gets you alone with god there's there's so many times i i can't you know it'd be hard to oversell the value of having being alone with god jacob was alone with god jephthah was alone with god you you find that that jesus got alone you find that peter was alone on the housetop amen you find all of these times you find that cornelius was in prayer alone when the angel came to you fine john was alone on the island of patmos there's a there's there's value in getting alone with god and just quietly communicating with your master see laodicea tries to block that constantly it fills your life up with so much stuff see but if he would have just used the wind or the trees it would have all been finished they would have obeyed him even in a fallen i i noticed when i go out in nature i was talking to my son the other day we were doing some bird watching and and and and i was just commenting as we were running along uh walking along a nature trail i said i want you to notice this nature i said everything you see here is is is a is a testimony to the character of god all nature tries to worship and praise him the leaves clap their hands the wind the sun the bible says the sun rises every morning and declares his glory to the world to a world who hates him who doesn't even believe him many of him don't even believe he's true and yet a son is up there declaring his glory every day see and all nature you know joins and that's why the bible says all nature's groaning their their nature itself under this burden of sin sin is on the earth literally and it and and nature struggles and but yet the the trees and the flowers and you talk about death burial and resurrection how that you know that with the seasons you come and the leaves fall and then the spring the buds come back and then the leaves come out and then they die again and then winter time comes and then the buds come back and then it comes back again and this death burial and resurrection death burial and resurrection and and all of nature even under sin struggles to to to to to be an image of the character of god that's what a believer is friends that's what we are as sons and daughters of god yes we're in fallen bodies yes we make mistakes yes it's a sin a sinful world yes the lid is torn off and demon powers are screaming but but even under this struggle i'm constantly trying to to be an illustration of his nature i'm trying to show the world what it's like to have christ living inside of us isn't it true see i tell you something friends we're headed somewhere i i love that statement where brother branham talks about when you cross over and i don't know for all i know i'll cross over before tomorrow before i know for all i know you will before i know before for all we know the rapture could come any minute but you say well that's kind of uncertain well it's it's uncertain as to when but it's very certain that it is it is coming there is a world waiting and we are going somewhere this world is not my home not in its current condition and so we find that you know in that in that regard brother branham said when you cross over the first thing now you just take some peace in this this morning because the prophet will be the only one that could know this when you cross over one of the first things that'll go through your mind is why was i ever worried why was i and not just why was i worried that i might not make it i haven't worried about that in a long time i haven't worried that i would miss the rapture because i am the rapture but you know what to to say to say how that i was an overcomer you know there that's where our real battle is friends if we're real sons and daughters of god is that we've tasted of the heavenly manna and it causes us to want more and it causes us to want to be more i mean as paul said listen if if the resurrection isn't true then of all men i would be the most miserable see because paul had saw it paul got caught up to the third evidence like somebody inviting you over to a seven-course meal and letting you walk in and walk around the table and smell it and salivate and say now isn't that beautiful yes it's gonna oh it smells so heavenly sorry you don't get to eat it now please leave i'd rather not i'd rather not saw it i'd just rather you never told me about it i'd just rather you told me that the only thing in the world was potato skins and there's nothing else in creation other than that don't take me and then paul said i've already saw it and now that i've saw it i heard things that can't even be said i i can't even put it in language i have a prophet in this day who said i don't have enough words to tell you and if i'm not going i'd rather never know but i do know and i am going hallelujah and i take such courage in that today see i'm i i'm often amazed that anyone would feel the need to distance the last day bride from the original pentecostal experience in the book of acts it's just astonish unless it stuns me i i've never been able to get my mind around even the motive behind wanting to do that i can't i can't fathom that and so i mean to me that's everything that's the jubilee that's the holy ghost that's the new birth that's the life of christ that's my ticket home hallelujah you're not getting my ticket home you can have air take my houses my lands change my dreams my plans i've placed my whole life in his hands hallelujah i mean when you look at the revelation 10 1 angel give me that on the screen guys revelation 10 1. let's make a quick note i'm not going to break it down because there's a lot to be said revelation 10 1 angel of course is the lord jesus christ and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire there's four examples right there of christ appearing in the form of his bride i'll just deal with two of them a rainbow's upon his head just two of them all right he's got he's also closed with a cloud and i definitely could take you on a trail through the scripture to show you that's christ in his family and then his and his face was as it were the sun don't even get me started but just look at the rainbow brother branham said why why a rainbow because a rainbow is means a covenant angel see now this is not the strong angel standing with john there was a strong angel representing the prophet of our day standing with john who represented the bride amen so you've got you've got the strong angel you've got a mighty angel you've got the bride you've got the sea of glass crystal see because she's pure and holy and clean you've got the four and 20 elders you've got all the heavenly hosts you've got the one daniel sauce seated on the throne you've got christ stepping out of eternity hallelujah you've got a lamb's book of life and and christ coming as a lion as a slain lamb to take it call for a queen the only the only person you don't have in this scene is lucifer because there's therefore now no condemnation to them who are in the jubilee to them who are born of the spirit of god the book has been opened and you realize that you are the book of life your names are on that book and so brother branham said he has a rainbow because it's a covenant and brother branham would just go back i love i just love a hillbilly prophet because you can't beat him because he he's not going to go out there in theological deep waters that you don't even understand anyway and and your eight-year theology degree only confuses you worse he'll just stand over here in the shallow waters and go back and take a piece of paper and go back to the old chinese laundry man and he'd say you're right you bring your laundry you don't speak english you don't speak mandarin so you just write your name big on a piece of paper and he rips it in half he keeps the top half you keep the bottom half and when you bring it back you've got the lower half of who you are your name he's got the upper half see here's a descending angel it's a covenant he's got a rainbow because it's a covenant and it and it fits it comes back again and it fits perfectly hallelujah it's christ coming in in his body that's what the message of the hour is this why brother branham would call it the bride coming of christ see it is it is the lord jesus christ but revelation 10 1 portrays him in the biblical imagery of the bride coming of christ because that's what the world is blind to they're looking for the nail scarred man and they won't see him until revelation 19 at the end of the tribulation but to you who do see him now you say where is he i'm looking at him hallelujah where's the book i'm looking at the book hallelujah his feet are as of pillars of fire not pillar of fire pillars like in the upper room at pentecost he divided himself into his church oh hallelujah it's pillars of fire and you know what he puts one foot on the land and one foot on the sea because he's saying that old roman system of the of the old world i've got authority over that and in revelation 13 he comes up in the land and i got authority over him and this bright coming of christ has one foot on the land and one on the sea that every b system is under your feet and that's the jubilee fringe that's the liberty you have in christ jesus that's the authority by which you claim your children the authority behind it there's no you can't enforce that say i claim my children how are you going to go get them you can't say you couldn't save you how you gonna save them see and so i i have to bring my token well my my token is my page of authority it's my it's my id badge hallelujah it shows that i'm part of a part of christ coming in this hour oh this is what they they miss they they chop him into three pieces two pieces one piece oh he's you can never put him like that in some man-made explanation he's the ever unfolding expression of almighty god he'll be that in the ceaseless ages to come see so so the millennium then will be the full family of god as at pentecost but now with the adoption completed the family all having glorified bodies likened unto his glorified body that's that's our existence in the millennium see and so the royal family then would be the perfection of that church at pentecost so why would we seek to distance ourselves from it why ever even let that concept come into your mind we're say oh brother branham said you can't mix this with pentecost he's not talking about acts 2. he's talking about 1906 he's talking about what became a denomination of course you can't mix that with this he's not talking about the upper room that's the new birth that is the message of the hour see my goodness and so so this royal family in the millennium will be the perfection of that church at pentecost that's what we're aiming at that's why we preach you have to have an experience with the holy ghost see so human beings think about that in the under the authority of this jubilee human beings operating in glorified bodies the full mind of christ operating the power of god ruling and reigning with christ managing world affairs among the nations amen that's our millennial as priests and kings that's our that's our millennial destiny lords and ladies if you will of the royal family representing the justice of christ the peace of christ the laws of christ we're there to represent the king ruling and reigning with him for a thousand years so then so then when you read joel 2 now brother mark give me joel chapter 2 and let's catch 10 verses starting in verse 23. now i want you to follow along with this because if everything i'm saying is true about what we're headed for then you're being prepared for that right now and you're already coming into that right now so that when this bride receives a body change it's a very short step it's not a long listen they're they're they're you're going to see here in a minute about the former reign let's let's read it together verse 23 be glad then now this is joel uh where where peter was referring to brother branham said he's referring to joel's prophecy all right now remember she said well i was fulfilled in the early church right right right right but they fell away remember and now we're restored back remember they crested off started backsliding christ sits down seals the word seven seals at the end he opens it up brings us back to that and carries us on so now the omega is being restored to the alpha amen you get me all right so so you're here this is this is this now is you all right be glad then your children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and i will restore to you all right so now this this return this this jubilee that's coming is the is a time when the former latter rain is coming uh in the first month so yeah first of all you understand there there's a whole lot said about former latter rain and let me let me just kind of cut to the chase because it's a whole sermon where where we're positioned the former and where the latter rain started so clearly the let me just cut to the ladder clearly the latter rain starts with the opening of the seals because that's the restoration of the mystery of god amen now you say so so now here's the here's the pitfall in thinking and sometimes this ideology gets in people's heads oh um someday a power's coming under the third pool there's coming a new message and there's coming a great power and the bride's gonna have a revival that's gonna take us into the body change okay first of all that is completely upside down to the scripture and to nature because if you understand anything about raising crops is once your latter rain comes that's the last rain you want to head it to the heart to head it to ripening and in fact is once that's come if if it rains again you ruin a crop so the whole thing you're waiting on is the latter rain has come and now it's moved out there the shuck has pulled away the grain is out there baking in the presence of the august presence of god and what's it doing coming to a harvest we're not waiting for another revival you're in it we're not waiting for another superman we don't chase supers we have the only super we've ever needed hallelujah i'm here to tell you you're in it right now it's happening all around you so they say well what's the what's the significance then stop letting the devil live in your life and stop letting the devil push you around and stop letting the devil make you afraid and make you sick and make you fearful we have victory we have the authority this is the hour where we have the sayeth the lord amen they're experiencing that right now in ukraine as we speak i'll get to it in a minute so he says verse 24. this is this is this is right now this is what the jubilee brings you this is what the return of the token brings us and the floors shall be full of wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and i will restore to you the years that the locusts hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar in the palm or my great army which i sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed say well this is on the other side right but the elements of this are in play right now because this is what peter identified when they said these men are drunk and peter said no this is what joel prophesied would happen to us and that wasn't the rapture that was the birth of the church see watch you shall lead in plenty of verse 27 ye shall know that i am in the midst of israel and that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed i know that right now i'm not confused i'm in man-made theology i'm not trapped up in man-made denominations it's all well it's all going to the mark of the beast it's all blasphemous names my eyes have been opened i know who the lord is oh that's why brother brandon would say oh you in new york city you in tucson you out here you in there rejoice the bride has made herself ready that's why there's a rejoicing among the saints of god that's why we come here and there's an excitement to have the presence of god among us watch and it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams so certainly this is before the catching away you're young men because you got old man your young men shall see visions and also upon my upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit and i will show one now watch as he moves toward the end time and i will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the lord come see now we're trending now look at the very next verse and it shall come to pass see when shall it come to pass after the terrible day of the lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be delivered for in mount zion and in jerusalem shall be deliverance as the lord hath said and in the remnant whom the lord shall call i'm here to tell you we're going to make it we're going to make it friends you say how do you know that last verse is going to come to pass because all the other ones did i see all the other ones why would i doubt the last one hallelujah this world is headed toward a terrible day but i'm going to be home in glory hallelujah with the things friends that we know with the things that we know and how that we know they go forward in the millennium i mean there's some things we know we don't know at all because as a honeymoon a lot of it's kept secret but we there's some things we do know we know time continues we know that time keeps going see nations are reborn the heathen are raised up to hear the gospel preaching i just read it recently i just refreshed myself brother brown says it in a couple different places about that because the bible says we'll rule and reign for a thousand years and he said what's ruling and reigning if you don't have any subjects so you understand over a thousand years say well there's a thousand years enough time to do that good great friends what is this nation 250 years old 200 and however many and i mean look look how long our history seems to us all the way back to the days of george washington of course a thousand years nations will be long established and and there will be a royal family and there will be christ on the throne and we will be priests and kings and we will be the executors of his will and his word and his justice and his peace hallelujah we're going somewhere oh my for sure for sure for sure say what all do we know well i know for sure uh that that that the millennium will will be more than merely a thousand year church dinner and fellowship [Laughter] i love church dinners and fellowship but it's going to be more than a thousand year church dinner friends oh most of joel's prophecy that we just read is fulfilled on this side and that's what the jubilee is all about we have returned to jubilee see god god is going to make up for the 2000 years of misery and separation in a 1 000 year reign is going to make life there twice as good as it ever was bad here oh hallelujah when you read the martyrology and you look at what the church went through it seems unimaginable well he's gonna in a thousand years he's gonna make up for two thousand years and it's gonna be double good as bad as it ever was oh hallelujah oh god's going to make up for it friends oh my that's why brother brandon would say we're going to live we're going to life we're going to live see and and so so you know brother branham would say you know civilization education he said all of these things are of the devil and yet brother branham wasn't against education or civil civilized law because when you have the breakdown of civilized law then barbarism sets in that's history is unequivocal in testifying to that that you think people are so civilized just let civilized law collapse and you you'll find out what man is capable of doing to man in a fallen condition because outside the holy ghost he's just beast remember see he's civilized got laws but uh he's just beast and when that when that order collapses then you get barbarism every single time it never has failed even one time and so so we find that that brother brennan would say we're going to a civilization but a a civilization and an education so much higher than this one it would hardly even be compared said everybody brother ram said everybody's saying we got to go to the moon we got to go to the moon we've got to go to the moon brother brahm said i want to pass the moon so fast i don't even see it hallelujah amen oh my why is all this important see because i see that if i look at the millennium in this in this larger aspect and oh boy do i ever want to get busy getting myself ready oh boy do i ever want to be dedicated to the lord oh my goodness friends do i ever want to sell out everything and say father take over my whole life take over my whole mind that's the value of looking at what's coming oh i need to i think we need to get busy don't you friends come on i think we need to get busy and be serious because we're we're just on the verge of world transitioning i think we need to encourage each other to press toward the mark because we see it a little bit clearer today you are to encourage one another don't be a discouragement at one another encourage one another so what paul said to the thessalonians encourage each other with these words see so hey maybe we haven't been thinking large enough you know maybe we haven't been thinking large enough so here's a kickstarter for you we're going to life we're going to live friends that's what the jubilee has returned to us in this hour you know that's why i had such a particular appreciation for brother jason breaking that down about how that satan offered eve you know to be independent like him and self-governing call your own shot make your own decisions choose your own lifestyle be like god he does that be like him you know be independent make call your own shots he tells every teenager that you know see and and and i love how brother jd broke it down that it's just a it's like a it's just a trap you know it's it's a spider web and it's a black widow and she's just luring you in and and and there's absolute death waiting see lucifer knew he needed that book of life he knows that that book of life contains the secret see that's why he was chasing it he he went to take it from adam as we said in the beginning but his brother branham said his filthy hands couldn't hold it and we we see it again and it's in heaven i'm getting too much echo now and so we we see it that it was in heaven i mean that's why he accuses you there because that's where it went see so he's still after that book of life and the book of life but the book but what he's missing is is that the book of life was to be written behind skin just like i said to you the last time this this is the third iteration of the bible the stars were the first one the pyramid was the second one enoch's pyramid this one is the third and there's a fourth iteration and it's flesh that's why brother branham said when the books are closed for the last time the word will be flesh he's not coming to rapture your bible he's coming to rapture you this is the freedom that you enjoy friends oh my goodness teens want their freedom i thought how remarkable as i was listening to the wednesday night service and i was uh by rule i couldn't come because i was really pretty sick and so excuse me so but you know brother jd talking about how that teens want their freedom and i thought wow now here i'm going i'm studying on the jubilee on the on the setting free and here he is talking about teens are going to get trapped and people are going to get trapped and and i thought what a what a perfect foundation i hope you were paying attention wednesday night i hope if you weren't here you caught an archive it was vital it was top secret intel that the devil wouldn't want you to know you need to listen to it several times because that's the but you need to know your enemy i'm here to tell you something friends we're in the time of liberty now this is the jubilee the bride has come back to her freedom she's not here for bondage because i can promise you and i've i've studied humanity for years in ministry and i can tell you that when brother jd talked about it it's a trick just to grab more control and lock you under further bondage i want you to know something every drug addict knows that's true every sex addict every money addict every fame addict every power addict knows that's true if they don't die you know you know if they go on and if they don't end up dying a premature way they they finally reach many of them don't most of them don't when you become addicted to any one of those things it ends your life prematurely you die a sad lonely broken person you you you finally get to a point where you you had all this fame you had all this money this this sex addiction this money addiction this power addiction this fame addiction that this this drug addiction until finally people literally step beyond the fear of death and the fear of death can't keep them back anymore and they step in a closet and hang themselves after they were famous after they were rich and they even die and hang themselves rich and they're still famous and still rich and still couldn't sit down in a restaurant without being mobbed and they take their own life why because it's what every addict knows that when you go the way of the world and satan pulls you in and pulls you in you hear me young people he pulls you in he pulls you and he pulls you in i'm here to tell you every last one of them you read their life stories of all these rock stars and movie stars and sports stars and politicians and they died and jumped out of windows and hung themselves and shot themselves and they died young and died and overdosed drugs and their whole life was blown to pieces blown to pieces because they listened to the siren song of the enemy they they let the pied piper lead them down that path oh it's bondage the jubilee is here hallelujah you have authority now to make a claim in the name of christ oh my it means freedom you don't have to come to that haunting hopelessness that they all come to they feel so desperate they find no solace they lay awake at night and cry when no one's looking i've read their life stories i've read too many till it's sickening i i intentionally have done it just to understand where mankind can get to i'm here to tell you something choose christ choose christ now you young people with your fresh minds and fresh hearts you haven't been all contaminated by the world yet choose christ he said he'll give you a pure life he'll give you happiness he'll give you joy he'll give you peace and contentment hallelujah he'll he'll chase away loneliness he'll he'll give you purpose hallelujah oh and you say well it's too late for me i i've done done this and i've done done that or i got children here and i got children there this is jubilee take your badge of authority and lay acclaim hallelujah oh my friends i don't know what all the jubilee may mean but i know it means freedom from slavery i know it's the life in that life i'll have a new body i feel sorry for those who don't have a desire for god i feel so sorry for them i have such a desire for god you know and i'm i'm like you we're all in this together we win some we lose some i win then i lose and then i go again and then i win some more and then i lose again and then i go some more and then i win again and i lose again say why do you keep fighting this battle because i want to win i want to win there's no there's no in my in my mind there's no stopping there's no quitting i'm determined to march to zion hallelujah i'll never stop fighting brother branham says i gotta close here brother branham says further on in return in jubilee he says remember he could go free didn't have to pay nothing didn't have to do nothing just get up and go i don't care what kind of bondage you might have arrived at this building with today i'm just here to tell you you can just get up and walk away from it you don't have to leave here with the bondage you came with you can be free because this is the hour of return to jubilee he says that's all he had to do go back if he knew the sound of the trumpet but he had to know the sound of the trumpet see for they were sons of god this is why i said to you at the beginning i owe satan nothing i owe him nothing you owe him nothing don't feel any allegiance to him you owe him zero see brother branham says he goes on we jesus said in saint john 8 35 that the son abides forever in the house now watch uh give me second kings four brother mark and be prepared i'll give you the verse in a minute let's get second kings four ready he says jesus said in saint john 8 35 that the son abides forever in the house now a servant does not abide a servant does not abide remember he is a son not a servant if he's a son he's born a son if he's a servant he is joined or bought all right now here comes an interesting story in the days of elisha now watch second kings chapter 4 verse 1 1-7 now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the creditor her husband is actually part of the priesthood the lord and the creditor is co okay let me start again now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets under elijah elisha's saying thy servant my husband is dead and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen and elisha said unto her what shall i do for thee tell me what hast thou in the house and she said thine handmaid hath not anything in the house save a pot of oil then he said go borrow the vessels abroad of all thy neighbors even empty vessels borrow not a few verse 4 and when thou art come in thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons and shalt pour out into all those vessels and thou shalt set aside that which is full so she went from him and shut the door open as she shut the door upon her and upon her sons and brought the vessels to her and who brought the vessels to her and she poured out and it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her son bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there is not a vessel more and the oil stayed then she came and told the man of god and he said go sell the oil and pay thy debt and live thou and thy children of the rest you see friends that remember remember that it's obvious that the creditor here is a type of satan because he's trying to make these sons of israel bond servants and we read in our text that's illegal that that that that her to make her sons who were children of of abraham bond servants was illegal a jew could not be a bond servant only a hired servant to work off a debt so it proved that it was satan trying to take away the opportunity of eternal life so elijah what is elijah going to do he's going to show her how to create oil a type of the holy ghost i'm here to tell you i don't care what what debt you find maybe you find your children somewhere under the grip of the enemy and you say the devil says i got him brother brad don't you worry he can't keep her because she can't be a bond servant she's a child of god sister melissa don't you worry she's a she's a child of god all of them don't you worry sister don't you worry brother this is a lie of the devil we're in jubilee we have authority over him we have a token hallelujah glory to god [Applause] amen spurgeon prayed a very sincere prayer in his memoirs he unfortunately in 1887 he said in a prayer we thank thee once more that thou what is by some means this is a time of war facing europe it says cause peace to be reestablished throughout the earth he's praying asking god to grant it grant that this nation this will be england granted this nation may not be drawn into war we have been foolish once over at grant that we may not be so again but oh let thy kingdom come without the use of the sword oh angel of war will thou not rest all sort of the lord put thyself into thy scabbard and be still for the sake of the great prince of peace we ask it amen very noble prayer we are to pray for the peace of jerusalem there's nothing wrong with praying for peace i'm praying for peace for all of god's family even in a war conflict right now in a war zone right now listen friends right now brothers and sisters to us in christ who hold this message dear who have the books in their language and believe god sent a prophet like we have been privileged to have in this land for decades and decades and decades and they had to hide it in secret false walls i've seen where they used to hide their books and they had a wall that looked just like a wall but the kgb didn't know right behind the wall was a typewriter where brother nikolai has got a a hard typewriter and he's trying to translate in the message into russian and he he's doing five pages at a time and so he's got to take his finger and jam the button pow a pow m pow just to say amen so that it sort of go through five pages and copy and make five five copies and he's got ribbons in between it all and he's gotta smack it and and you know and he's got to try to use instruments and this is what they did just to spend months getting one book back in soviet days hiding behind false walls pounding out five pages at a time to try to secretly pass it get arrested you're going to the gulag and he was raided more than one time they never found his false wall i saw it kgb never got to see it why because i was in the family of god amen you know they brothers that went behind enemy lines through poland and through east germany and took this message in peril over their lives and sometimes caught and sometimes jailed jailed in asia and different parts of the world today fighting and right now they're fighting and this is a noble prayer that spurgeon is praying but it can't be granted because first of all jesus had said there be wars and rumors of wars and nations rise against nation but remember but remember that that the woes that that that you begin to catch up on in revelation 7 the woe one first world second with third woe first world war second world war armageddon that once that starts that that's just gonna keep going and the only thing that even holds it temporarily is an injunction by the angel who rose out of the east with the seal the living god showed it was christ of course because he's the only one who has the seal and and and you've got to wait till i brother branham said an interval of time to seal 144 000 jews under the trumpets but under the seals he's got a seal of gentile pride call her out of a church send a prophet sneak a prophet down nobody even believes he's a prophet call a bride who hears an eagle scream oh my something it it's a deep calling to a deep and what did we do we left churches and families and denominations and we became outcasts why because it was a jubilee because something about it spoke about freedom and i can be a real christian and i can have the real power of god in my life see so i mean that that's not just nation rising its nation now it's global world war what you're seeing happening right now is is precursors to armageddon it's global war and we could always think man we should then be gone well we're not say well before the first bomb falls well qualify that to the brothers and sisters who are getting bombed right now i get that brother branham's intimation was it was intimating nuclear bomb and i certainly believe that before that happens the bride will be gone but you know something i i said to some brothers i was i was talking to the other day in a chat and i said hey i said whoever said that the third pull and the power of missing limbs if necessary had to start in america i said i won't surprise me at all if we start hearing testimonies and stories coming out of our brothers and sisters over there i'm here to tell you friends the move is on and this bride is almost out of here hurry hurry hurry get your life ready get the holy ghost in your life these things are transitioning rapidly and it can't stop until it's over it goes to the consummation of the ages amen i read you a quick testimony i sure want to thank the lord for giving me strength today i've powered through this and this is from uh the brothers in mariopol this was three days ago now mariopl has been taken by the russian army we're praying for both sides because we got brothers and sisters on both sides you understand so for us it's not say well which nation are you from no i'm not from any of them i'm from glory i'm not from here i'm not it's not about being an american or russian or a bella russian or ukrainian or lithuanian it's not about i'm not an american they're not ukrainians i i wrote them a letter to say that remember we're sons of god and the ukrainian brothers are praying for the that none of the russian
