lord we're happy to have you here at the house of god tonight we got a really special treat amen brother don's coming to minister forrest brother jason sister amy's dad and uh with jason's father-in-law happy to have him sister mary and visiting with us wow i tell you this is uh this is a man with a fine spirit i it it's not hard for me to figure out that where the quality of that spirit comes in jason and amy because you you see that they've been geared amen in the right way this is a very precious brother we were just in the back uh rejoicing uh he was giving me a little more tidbit of of his sermon so i'm really really looking forward to it i'll probably be taking notes like a madman but uh i want to just take in the word of god amen listen friends there's life in the word you remember the story time brother branham tells about he just took his bible and just laid it in a chair just set it in a chair and he just started walking around that chair praying and brother brown said every time i walked past that chair i said i'd point to that book and say oh there's life in that book wow there's life in there friends and how many need life i need more of it i need it and i need it more abundantly and that is what is the the lord's desire for you is that you live that you have life that you have everything associated not just air in your lungs when you talk about life it's about zoe life so every characteristic that is that is represented in christ all the peace all the faith all the harmony amen all the all the power all the commitment everything that is in god is in that life that you're feeding on so don't under don't underestimate amen what god has done is doing and will do amen we're going to sing some more that sister dave i like clapping my hands hey man brother don we're going to invite you to come and take your complete liberty when we all will get to heaven oh what a day of rejoicing that will be [Music] [Applause] and disgrace [Music] he'll prepare for us a place [Music] [Music] god bless you all do you love him i hope you love him more tonight when you leave because we need to love him with all of our hearts brothers all of our soul all of our strengths and uh we're waiting for that capstone right remember what he says we got to fit with it it says when that joins together you won't be able to fit a razor blade in between there so what's he doing is he making me is he fitting me is he chipping away ah these are some of the things we'll be looking at tonight would you bow with me in prayer in the precious name of our lord jesus oh how we love you lord and how needy we are of you i just feel just waiting on you and father your spirit to take over right now take your place help me to get out of the way even father every human spirit take control that truly you might have the preeminence otherwise we meet in vain we meet in form we meet in ritual but not in spirit and truth and that's what we desperately need so the days of playing church are over but you're working in a bride mightily to fulfill your word in her now we submit ourselves to you father in the precious name of our lord jesus christ amen amen thank you maybe take your seats i know but you know what happened last time i was going for a half hour and they were looking when's he gonna go sit down you can sit down too yeah i'm an i'm an oddball born that way i think all right um i was looking into the scripture and doing praying and the lord led me to a message that has affected me actually several years ago but it made me face things i didn't want to face it had me look at things i didn't want to necessarily look and look at and it's from the message god's only provided a place of worship and brother branham somebody's trying to trick him on something he catches their thought and he says well he's he's talking about somebody makes a comment whosoever believes that jesus christ is the son of god will be saved and then he says it says that he says but remember it also is written it also is written you see so much of our christian lives even in the message people find quotes that are comfortable to them and then they camp on them and you'll never mature that way so the lord was dealing with me and he says time to grow up hoffman so this has sort of been guiding me for years is that it also says it also says and i have to take it also says in everything because brother branham says that if we have the holy spirit we'll say amen to every word of god so i can't be offended or things you know you look at the word of god okay and you look at where the holy spirit is taking us okay we got the doctrine down and we understand godhead we understand serpent seed we understand the man of iniquity um we understand these things but he says you're going to become the word okay well so if i'm becoming the word i can say amen to serpentine no big deal did it cost me anything did it hurt no well what about this word you shall love your enemies that one starts to hurt okay go through luke chapter six um give to those who ask brother jason i i was put to the test on that i'm going to tell you a little story i was getting ready for church and all we have just one tiny room that we rent and in the back is a little cubby hole and that's where i sit before service and pray and the lord led me to luke chapter six and i was sitting there meditating on it and says give to those that ask not if you count them worthy or you know it just says give so after church there was a manager in the building and came up to me i need some money i thought as soon as he said that the letter said here's your test yeah so i gave him so the next service i need some more okay lord and the next service i need some more do you like to be tested [Laughter] we're going to become the word how much of it do we want to become amen because he's very serious when he says i'm going to make you the word yes and we have to be serious along with him so with that we're going on a journey tonight and this whole subject is a journey this spiritual walk that we're on is not a level stopping point it's not oh i believe it i'm done the lord was going to say to every single one of you and he certainly does to me every day take my hand son we're going on a walk and if you follow him you won't be at the same place at night that you were when you started out that day it's a journey and i think the worst thing your worst enemy and my worst enemies and enemy as a believer is complacency and the worst death to a church is stagnation okay now i want you to think on that just for a second the seed of god is a hungry absorbent seed always hungry always thirsty right do you ever feel like you've had enough of the lord i want you to think when is the last time that you talked to joe blow on the street mr catholic and he says you witness to him he says well i'm just satisfied being a catholic watch that person they'll never know they'll never move another step in their life go to mr baptist i'm satisfied being a baptist and they'll stay baptist for generations go to pentecostal i'm satisfied with it i can speak in tongues i'm done so don't you ever say to god i'm satisfied ever that's death you always come hungry every day that you're here you are here for a reason every day that you are here he says take my hand we're going to take another step okay so we know in revelation okay 22 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take of the water of life really every day every single day so we're on a journey with that let's go to genesis 28 and i'll take my text would you stand with me please we're familiar with this story jacob and leaving home going out on his own and isaac has given him final yeah thank you just giving him his final instructions so he goes and he has his first night out alone and he's on this journey so let's read verse 12 to 15. and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it and behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lord god almighty god of abraham thy father the god of isaac the land wherein thou liest to thee i will give it and to thy seed and that seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed would you read verse 15 out loud with me and behold i am with thee and i will keep thee in all the places where thou goest and i will bring thee again to this land for i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken unto thee of i will not leave you i will not leave you until i have done that which i have spoken of the of let's pray heavenly father i commit this time into your hands and myself into your hands we need you lord in this day in this hour in this time like we've never needed you before the days are evil but you are good it's so black out there and so dark out there and so many spirits out there but your spirit shines brighter but only in the souls of your children bring us home lord do what you have to do in us we stand before you yielded submitted crying out with all of our hearts have your way you do what you want to do granted lord we ask in jesus name amen thanks you may be seated and behold i am with thee and will keep thee in all the places that you go and will bring thee again to this land for i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken to thee of my goodness we see jacob starting off his life's journey as a man of god and had everything he needed everything he needed for that journey the word of god to him and the presence of god to make sure it was fulfilled in him and that's exactly what you and i have today brothers and sisters ours is not literal but spiritual and uh we see the scripture fulfilled all around us and in us but that's the most important thing is it being fulfilled in me what's he doing here what's he doing in this skin so um i know hebrews 10 verse 14. you go there with me quick jacob set out on a journey ours is spiritual we're familiar okay we got these things that god is working in us to bring us to a place that he wants but he's working every single day and every single day should find us in a different place than we were the day before and in this place that he's bringing us to this place that we have to be ripened he has to have this place in us where he's got to take us where the entire world can be fulfilled in us because that's what the bride's all about she is mrs word she is him she is the fulfilling of all the word of this day so here god takes those that are perfect under the blood of the lord and does something with them he does not do with anybody else he continuously sanctifies them amen continuously and that's exactly the way the prophet teaches us we must lay in the presence of the son to be ripened right but there's more i believe listen to this i believe the church is beginning to hear the message and beginning to understand but friends listen we've got to lay in the presence of the son we've got to be ripened our faith isn't ripe intellectually we're hearing the message god has given us and seeing the signs that he showed us and proven it by the bible it's there but how the church needs to lay in his presence until it tenders up get sweet in the spirit okay a little prickly sometimes aren't we so that it can bathe down so there's a cleansing process here he says sometimes in speaking the message you get harsh and have to break it in like that because you've got to clinch it like a nail to make it whole but once once the church gets at the elective that's called out and separated then in the presence of the son i know it'll be something like the people that was there there's a blending when it takes the rapture so i'm not going to go to the rapture and expect a change i'm going to have a change starting to affect me now to join with those people already there you hear me what's going on now in making you in that transformation so here there's a sanctifying sanctification process there's a process of the holy spirit there's god moving in the hearts of the people he says i have to take you from here to here i have to move you from this place to this place i have to work in your life and i have to work on your heart daily not just wednesdays and sundays where am i on monday morning where am i on tuesday evening where is the love what attracts you what draws you television sports where's god where's the reality of him fulfilling his word in your life and in your heart where's he taking you what kind of journey are you on because this is real this isn't church do you know what brother brad and i have this do you know what he calls church members stinking church members have you ever heard him say that i don't want to be a stinking church member what good is it going to do me if i go play the part and i come before everybody's eyes and i appear accepted but you see they don't know what's going on inside of me really in my secret life on the inside when i'm home and what i'm flipping on the tv and what books i'm picking up oh and they'll never see it well god does but see what good is it going to do you because the effect of the blood of jesus christ has to be working in me now every day that life has to be there so here he's telling us things though we are in a place in hebrews chapter 10 for one off by one offering we're perfected forever them that are sanctified now i know you've gone over this verse but it's a very important verse because you can't come into this message and say i'm done i believe the message okay are you perfect under the blood he said you were but he's not done working with you okay you're done but listen to me your maturity is another thing you're perfect as far as the sin question but i've got to take you to a place i've got to mature you yeah and how many places and how many times and how many things in different messages does he talk about this even in the message it is the rising sun he says you know don't say i've made it don't say can i make it say i've already made it in that same message he says you're growing into the fullness of the resurrection there's a growth there right so i can't take one without taking the other i have to take them both and i have to ask the question is that growth going on where's the holy spirit taking me where is it moving me how is it convicting me every day how is it ruling over my life how is it ruling over this noggin up here and where i allow it to go and what i allow it to see and what i allow it to hear all these things have to be working because he said it would other things he tells us he's we're growing into the fullness of the stature of the bride he tells us those things you're not there he says you're growing into that remember in the message perfect faith he says you must have this perfect faith that's holding up the rapture right and then at the end he says you know it means a lot of shaving down you know shaving not shaking shaving in other words something's got to be like a plane out here got to get rid of some stuff it means a lot of shaving down for me and it means a lot of shaving down for you but he says together we'll make it so the question is what's going on in our hearts in these days what is the holy spirit doing how is it affecting how is this cleansing process going on how is this bathing down going on that he talks about in that quote how is that getting sweet in the spirit how's my temper how's my reaction to things um you know we must have that we must have that perfect faith that's what he said so all these things in the last day he says these last days the true bride church christ seed will come to the headstone and she will be a super church excuse me is she she will be a super race how am i super do you feel super tonight do you feel anything but doesn't something in your heart god help me this is serious [Music] i need to stand before him and say here i am i'm naked before you you know you know what goes on in this old noggin up here you know where my eyes are attracted to you know my ears and you know what's going on in here what's my where's my life how much time did you spend in the word today when's the last time you spent a full hour on your knees in prayer sweet hour of prayer sweet hour prayer are you kidding me sweet minute of prayer no really somebody who used to sing that song and they wrote a sweet hour of prayer that calls me from a world of care power really what's satan doing to us and are we fighting him back with the word of the hour you know where he tells the the holy spirit tells them to pick up his pen and write he said she'll be she'll be that super church they will be they in the bride will be so much like him can you can you say oh that describes me lift your hand up if you can say that see do you know what we've done with these quotes oh that's a nice quote i've heard that but where is the impact of those words where is the power of the spirit behind those words that say hoffman you better get serious often you better get on your knees hoffman you better get before the lord and get serious on these things because he said they'll be so much like him so much they'll even be in this very image now then the next words are pretty scary because he says this is an order to be united with him really i have to be this this has to happen before that has to happen so i'm going to ask you a question what good does playing church do you what good does it do to put on a facade in front of people and i was saying is there should be a desperation in every single one of us where am i before you god where am i what do you need to do and here i am and i'm laying myself before you and i'm pleading with all my heart do it do it do what you have to do god help us in these things he says these this bride they will be the manifestation of the word of the living god amen they will be the manifestation of the word amazing so then he is you go to this progressive work the progressive things that he said would be in the bride lay in the presence of the sun till she's ripened okay what does that mean now next question is what does that mean lord to me do i feel the heat of the sun baking down on me baking the greenness out because if that's happening that means there's a conviction going on because conviction and baking go together don't they that means there's got to be a cleansing process and that's what he also said in that quote they got to bathe down something's got to clean us more and i think this is very very interesting you go back to the message future home and he keeps talking about a further cleansing process okay so when you come to the lord are you cleansed when you leave the world you come okay then are you when you're justified are you cleansed some more yeah then when you're sanctified are you cleansed some more cleaner cleaners clean this desk test then when the spirit of the lord comes in you are you more clean than are you does he still keep cleaning you so you ask the question when's enough enough and he will say when i see me when i see me now because i've been thinking about these things here's the message the token we all know it you can probably recite most of it by heart so if i quoted you anything out of the token you'd say yeah we know that but the token is himself the token in a cis spirit right it's him and he says that has to be over me i have to be under it so then when he says when i see the blood when i see the token i'll pass over you so do you know what he's telling you stop and think about this jason i'm passing over you and i don't want to see jason when i pass over you i don't want to see you i want to see me right how serious are we on these things what's god doing where's he taking us and the biggest question of all for every single one of us is is he doing this in me amen don't worry about the guy next to you don't say oh what about brother such and such so what about sisters forget that you go look in the mirror and you forget about everybody else and say what about this guy here what about me if i came tonight would i really feel confident that i'd be gone did he produce did he make a son in the image of his son am i an obedient son or am i just playing a game am i just say well you know i'm wearing dresses and i'm cutting my hair if you're a man and listen to me this message has as many fig leaves as were in the garden of eden and your hair and your dress can be nothing but a fig leaf to you and men with your haircuts fig leaves and you can be dead on a doorknob on the inside and get all kinds of smiles coming to church and yet you're crying lord i need your life desperately i need you but let me tell you he still hears a desperate cry he will hear your cry and he will come to you but it's one on one right brother it's one on one let's think where he's taking us so with my scripture again tonight as it was told jacob i will not leave you till i've performed every word in you unless you say i'm not interested unless you tell him go find somebody else unless you say to him i'm satisfied then you'll be like mr baptist mr catholic and mr pentecost the minute you turn him down but i'll tell you what that seed of god is an absorbent hungry seed always desiring more always hungry always thirsty i was saying lord where's your manna for me today because if i don't have it i'm gonna die so here are the things that we're looking at is that god is with us no matter what faces us if we have an honest heart before him he'll hear your cry so there's this progression and that's we're talking about this journey that we're on because even in one of his last messages power of transformation he says now that we have been saved as we have now that we have been filled with the holy spirit as we have now we want the mind of christ to be in us that we might be transformed here you go from the natural things of life and brought in to do the perfect will of god there's that obedient sonship by transformation now isn't that interesting now that i've been saved now that i've been sanctified now that i've been filled with the holy ghost now i want the mind of christ now this is what i'm going to spend some time on because i'm looking at the life of the prophet and how god dealt with him as an example to us because in the rising of the son when brother branham's talking about that man what god has done to him there was a wave sheep waved over the people the lord jesus there was another wave she waved over us in this day and it was the what what was it the first one come to that means there's more coming right isn't that where all of our hope is so in that first one coming to maturity in this age we have an example of how god dealt with him so i'm looking here and i'm saying i think us bringing us to his mind cleansing us out because i've spent a lot of time at home going over three messages um greatest battle ever fought thinking man's filter knoweth it not it's also in um god of this evil age and uh god's word in this what's that word god's huh yes that too he talks about the body and the soul and spirit so much you know that that's nothing new to us but in there he says there has to be a cleansing process okay in thinking excuse me greatest battle ever fought he says this is where the battle is he says you have a conscience you have an imagination you have a reasoning and they're all plugged up by the devil did you know that and he says they have to be cleaned out because they have to become channels of the holy spirit okay so we're going to go into this and i'm going into these things the final frontier i call it is having the mind of christ the last enemy to be brought under the feet of our lord jesus is our carnal mind remember that brother branham said who was who was his own worst enemy him why why is that now turn with me to hebrews chapter 9 and you're going to see this very scriptural what what brother branham did hebrews 9 talks about the the old covenant hebrews 9 is talking about the temple the tabernacle and the parts of the tabernacle and we're going to start at verse 7 and the second which is the holy place went the high priest alone every once a year without not without blood that's in the most holy place okay which he offered for himself in the heirs of the people now look at verse eight the holy ghost thus signifying that the way unto the holiest of all was not made manifest well the first tabernacle was standing so only one could go in there only wonder what but brother branham preached a message unveiling of god and what did he say one time it was death to go in there he says now it's death to do what to stay out so i have to get there i have to get into that presence of god but look at what he says verse 9 which was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to what now that's weird so what's he telling me he says you know you cannot go into the presence of god with your conscience the way it is huh really well tell me what's the state of your conscience today and what does that mean and what's going on because this is a pretty important significant verse if i can't go into him into the presence of god in my conscience the way it is something's got to happen well he tells you further down in that chapter verse 13 and 14 for if the blood of bulls and goats in the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god do what so my conscience has to be purged so brother branham draws this out and he calls it in the message greatest battle he calls it your solar system so he must be a circle with little planets in here so if you draw an imaginary circle up here that's your human spirit and here's conscience affections imagination reason and memory he says now those are all plugged up by the devil but he says god has to scour every one of those out okay so i can't have my own reasoning come on brothers you feel like you got a little of your own reasoning in there how about your imagination how about your affections a bunch of reasoning that's a little frightening isn't it so i'm going to spend a little time into the message knoweth it not because this is where he goes into here and he says i'm gonna just take some some quotes from here just to set up this thing what was god doing this is the only message i know where he tells what god was doing when he tore his life apart it's amazing so he talks about body soul and spirit and he says now the outside man is the flesh and he says that's the evil one not much going for us there is their brothers and sisters huh so this is evil right this is the evil one he said inside as that is your human spirit and here's what he says about that he says that's your worldly nature and that was not given from god but permitted by him so you got a spirit there that was god's just permitted it but it's not from him but it has its purpose according to everything that he he does because he does everything perfect then he talks about the soul and he calls it sometimes he calls it the last man sometimes he calls it the first man sometimes he calls it the little inside man and he says now the last man is the soul and the only sense that can that has control is free will to choose or to reject now he says now here with your human spirit he says people can live in the spirit dance in the spirit every hour of their spirit they can go to church in the spirit they can be absolutely have the real spirit of god anointed in that spirit but still be lost and devil possessed with that spirit that little frightening so lord help me amen we've got to get honest before god get you know well it doesn't do any good for any of us to play church anymore brothers and sisters we each have a place where we stand before god and he's either going to do something in me and i'll go home or he's not going to do anything to me because i'm resistant and i'll stay do you know what he says he says the bride uh-huh she's cleansed she's sanctified by the blood of jesus christ there's a cleansing process up here in all of these things but what does it say about the foolish virgin she has to go through the tribulation for that so let me tell you something you know what this isn't a very nice thing but you're going to be cleansed one way or another you take your pick okay if you say i i'm not interested i you know i'm busy i got a life and you're so this is pretty secondary to me right now my spiritual walk he said that's fine i'm still going to deal with you you're going to be sanctified you're going to be cleansed but it's during the tribulation period you take your pick you want to do it now or later that's what he says so there's some something that has to happen something has to happen inside of me and i god i pray that it's happening now i don't want it to happen then so he's talking about this inside man and the outside man he's talking about these things going on in inside of us and they have to happen in page 17 knoweth it not he says the outside man is the flesh he says that's the evil one on the outside isn't that amazing the evil one goodness sakes that no he says the last man is the soul and the only sense that controls that is free is to choose or reject that's it you have nothing else to do then he goes on to say the only way up here in these spheres that you could ever enter in this little inside man you have to be ordained you have to be a part of god and i believe everyone's sitting here there's something in you calling you're not here playing games you're not here to be seen you got better things to do right so there's something in your heart pulling you towards him and there's something in your heart that has to work these things out to bring all of the word to pass but here in uh page 23. inside of that inside of the man is a little thai post there that that seed that was predestinated before the foundation of the world i don't care what takes place it'll hold him there just it'll hold him so then he goes on and he says something very very strange he's talking about what's happened to him and he's doing all of this teaching and then all of a sudden he just stops and the teaching stops and he and he starts his life story and i thought what oh why did he do that and he makes this most astounding statement he said what was going on what was happening in my life he says what did it do it was working from the outside to this first man think of that something had to happen in the prophet god had to deal with him and he dealt with him harshly listen to me if he dealt with me and you like he dealt with that prophet none of us would have families he was deadly serious about this it was working from the outside to the first man i was using my reason god says no more i was using my affections no more says you let me in there let me that i alone are your reasoning i alone are your conscience really yes or else it's death so he's taken the prophet to this place something from somewhere else said way down on the inside where were you to begin with the lord gave and the lord take away he says that that inside man doesn't reason at all no all reasoning is gone he says how did i get here on earth i come with a bun through a bunch of drunk drunkards how did i get there who gave me life who gave me a wife who gave me this baby where did my wife come from where did my life come from though he slayed me yet i'll trust him and he says there it is that something on the inside of the inside beyond all reasonings beyond all emotions beyond everything intellectual holds the inside man holds you so here in this thing he's telling you for the first time ever why god had to deal with him why god had to deal so harshly with him because he was using his own mind he was using his own thoughts he was using his own reasoning god says no you're not going to use those anymore you're going to use mine now do you want to see things god thing things god's way or yours do you want your own reasoning or do you want his because he'll deal very harshly with you till he gets you in a place where you're can be molded and shaped where his voice has its place in your life now he says what was he doing he was working from the outside to that first man isn't that an amazing statement he took away my wife you take away my baby and even in this message it talks about losing his father he had to lose it all before god could get his attention before god could say i need you i need this work done in you now i have two things here and their thoughts and i before i say them i'm not trying to promote anybody or anything but this is simply testimonies of what brother branham told brother vale personally okay 1963 they were out in the rockies and the blizzard came right after that they were traveling together and they were in a hotel and brother vale stood outside of his room waiting for brother branham and he just waits because he never knocks on his door because he didn't want to disturb him he just stood there he waited for a wild time brother branham came out of his hotel room came up to him and brother vel knew that the angel of the lord had been there with him and he didn't say a word because he felt the spirit so strong and brother branham just looked at him and said brother vale i have no more conscience of sin think of that 1965 same condition same scenario they were together in a hotel brother vale is out standing outside of his door of his room and he's waiting for brother brian and brother brandon walks out of his room and he walks up to him and brother vale doesn't say where he just waits for him to speak and brother brandon makes this comedy comment he says brotherly all of my thoughts are of god can you imagine that's the work of the holy spirit that is the work can you imagine look at all of my thoughts are of god now where is he taking me and where does he want to take the bride of jesus christ and where does he want to take you how filled do you want to be with the holy spirit how much can you submit yourself because these are things that he has to do you can't do them you can try and try and all you will do is get frustrated with yourself and lose your faith but if you just lay in his presence and submit to him and allow him to do the work because this is what he wants to do amen he wants to take you places where you thought it was impossible for me to go there he wants to do things inside of you say it was impossible for me to do of course and you know what you said to the lord i can't do this and i can just feel the holy spirit saying i've been waiting for you to say that for a longest time finally you said it move over let me have my place let me in put me in the control room now give me your conscience give me your reasoning give me your affections give me your imaginations and he says all of every one of those will become channels of the holy ghost every single one of them and that's the real spiritual journey that's where your election will take you to the point where our condition and election meet to fulfill the word of god listen to me again the real spiritual journey is where your election and his conditioning his work in you takes you to a crossing point your election and your condition now brother branham says he had to take me there he had to get me to this place it was painful it took him losing his wife but he said he had me to move me to this inside man he had to move me to this place where his spirit was in absolute control because that inside man is the soul and it can only say yes or no to god right so you know you can't get there and say no to god all the time no i won't let you hear no i won't let you there oh well where are you why is my life such a mess well you've shut me out but there has to be this place in the bride of jesus christ while she finally gives up and she yields everything to her savior to her lord and says i give you everything of me i give you it all now he has to do his work go with me would you to to genesis chapter 22. now this is very odd but i love it because god works in odd ways and i'm very odd too so we meet genesis 22 abraham you're very familiar with the story in chapter 22 he's taken isaac up to the mountain in obedience to the lord and he's waited a long time for isaac so how long did he wait 25 years it's a long test how long have you been tested how many of you have been tested 25 years over one test see god's not in a hurry but he knows what he's doing so how old was isaac after that 22 years and he was oh i've got the promised son oh he's here it's all over no it's not all over it wasn't all over at all so one day he hears a voice jason we've talked about this how old do you think isaac was some say he was 30 right that's a long time that's a long time so you've been enjoying your son and finally you have the promise of god and god says go take him up and sacrifice i mean what i haven't heard right that can't be now what kind of a covenant are we talking about with abraham grace covenant what did abraham have into it nothing so why did he put him through these things why did he have to come to these places why did he sell them after he had him and he was 30 years old do you spend this time with him and they've grown this relationship father and son take him and sacrifice him you've got to be kidding me so you notice uh look at verse 2. and he said take now this and only son isaac whom they'll love us and get thee to the land of moriah and offer him there a burnt offering upon one of the mountains that i will tell you of and he rose up early in in the mornings and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac and his son claimed the wood before the burnt offering and rose up and went to their place and then on the third day he lifted up his eyes and saw the place so far off now that's mean go sacrifice your son okay i'll go do it but i want it done today so they travel for three days and then they finally see it he gives them plenty of time to think about it i'm not going to make this easy on you you know what you're going to do you walk for three days and then you see it off in the distance okay so then you know the story my point is here do you have it do you have the kj are you on east sword no go to east sword i don't think oh that's too bad jason you got your e-sword i want you to go to verse get your kgv plus out there and i want you to go to verse 16 and i want you to look up the word because in ancient hebrew okay here's a man here's a man under a grace covenant here's a man with a covenant that says you have nothing into this nothing i've said it it's going to happen oh that's cool i like it so why does he put him through all this stuff he takes him he sees the place three days journey he sees it afar off gives him plenty of time to sweat to work out his faith to make sure his faith is in place to make sure that he's going to be obedient so go to chapter 22 verse 14 and abraham called the name of the place jehovah jireh as i said in this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen and the angel of the lord called to abraham out of heaven the second time and said by myself have i sworn set the lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son because because why is that in there because you have done this because you haven't will tell i will bless you now wait a minute that shouldn't be in there what it should reas you know what i promised this so it's just going to happen i promise this is a grace covenant you have nothing into it so why is that there isn't that interesting so all of a sudden god comes on the scene he says because you have done this thing because you have brought your son because you have built an offer because you were willing to take that knife and cut him because you did that i will fulfill my promise that doesn't sound like a grace covenant to me does it to you what was god doing there he was under a grace covenant but under that grace covenant a condition still had to be met of a maturity that he had to come to and he says because you have done this i'm going to fulfill my word interesting isn't it jason read that word in the ancient hebrew because the nomadic agriculture is carefully watches over his livestock and props by keeping a close eye on them isn't that interesting god's watching over he says i'm going to watch to see that you become the mature son i want you to become yes i promised you but yes it's not going to happen until i see this in you isn't that interesting yes it's a grace covenant but yes i've got work to do yes you are perfect under the blood of jesus christ yes you are perfect there but he says that doesn't mean you're done yes you are perfect under the blood of jesus christ but i'm still going to mature you and it's going to hurt you're going to be tried because although i have perfected you under the blood of jesus christ i haven't matured you and i haven't given you that character because i can't because that's not a gift remember what he said character is not a gift and you have to go through this victory so here is abraham in the same scenario in the same place he's under a grace covenant not if you will i will but i have already done it and god has to still bring him to this place he says because i'm watching over you i'm watching over this seed i'm watching it to make sure it matures and when it's mature finally i'll fulfill my promise you see where you're at today do you see what the holy spirit's doing in us today these things are there and they're both perfectly fit together like this but it's time we see these things and mature into them they're both in a grace covenant but because you have come to this place where you have trusted me with that promised son and you have given him into my hands and given yourself into my hands in total abandon that in blessing i will bless you now otherwise that because shouldn't even be in there should it it's a strange word in a strange place but it's there and he put it there so brother branham had to come to this place in maturity he took away his wife he took away his daughter he's dealing with him he said i have to move you to this inside man where i have to move you to this place i have to move you into this place where all reasoning and all conscience and all your own thinking is dead and nothing is alive but the word of god listen to me brothers and sisters look into the bible look at every man and woman of god that god greatly used and he on purpose took them to a place where they had to deny every single thing that their eyes and their ears and their senses told them go through the scripture true or not true abraham here's a promise every day ah here's another ache here's another pain here's another wrinkle so what until finally he's what does romans say he was as good as dead and he staggered not at the promises of god look at jacob and esau what does what was esau's testimony i'm going to eat this messes pottage and die right why there was a famine in the land it says that in verse 20 chapter 26 verse 1. what were the conditions like pretty terrible what did jacob say sell me your birthright why i have the word and somehow with that word god's going to do something in this body of mine i don't care if it doesn't rain for a hundred years he'll do something in this body where i don't need food because i got a promise he put them in a place where they on purpose they had to deny every single thing to stand on the word of god every single thing that their senses told them i'm going to ask you a question where's god taking you and don't be surprised when the trials come where he's going to say all right we're going to see where your eyes are huh what if this whole economy crashes what if the whole system collapses where are you so what do you know this is a reality do you know that he did this with his men look at noah no hey it's going to rain it's never rained before you're foolish you're crazy god said so everything in this life speaks against the word of god but the soul hangs on to the word of god against everything that your eyes and your ears and your senses tell you and you have to stand there on the word of god and if he did it to all of those men won't he do it to us won't we be tested it has to happen what does the word of god mean to you i tell you what someday it's going to mean everything or you're going to die and it's going to be life or you will be dead and it isn't just a nice sunday school lesson and this message isn't just oh we wear skirts and we look nice and i say the right buzzwords and i can say all the messaging things no where is your life with god and what's he doing and what's becoming a reality to you you know and where is god because it's brothers and sisters it's going to look pretty bleak because when god spoke to jacob and says i'm not going to leave you until everything that i've spoken concerning you is going to come to pass that's exactly what he's saying to you and me today i'm here and i'm not going to leave you until i fulfilled every single word inside of you unless you tell me lord i've had enough lord just leave me alone i'm satisfied that's fine he'll leave you alone don't you ever say that to him because you tell him to leave you alone and you see what your life turns into god is a gentleman remember so exodus chapter three we know the story you don't even have to turn there same thing i've heard the cries of my people right i've seen the affliction why didn't he just say oh 400 years are up it's time to go because 400 years was up and it was time to go but he doesn't say 400 years are up it's time to go he says i've heard the cry there had to be a condition in the people there had to be a condition that meets the election there has to be a condition in the people that meets the word of god there had to be a condition in abraham okay even though he had a promise and that promise was unconditional god was still waiting what was that picture jason and i i'm watching i'm watching why because because why is that word because in there i don't want it to be in there it should just say i promised it and here it is no because you've done this you've not withheld your only son because you were obedient because you did this because you were in this place with me and trusted me with everything beyond all of your senses and it looked crazy and looked insane who would offer their own son it's even against everything in the laws of god but you obeyed my voice and you came to this place and because of this all the promises of abraham are now on you think of that brothers look at your life look at where you are look what god is doing with you and you wonder why ah what a mighty god you see he's brooding over you he's brooding over each one of you each one of your life each one of you is precious to him each one of you has your own story each one of you he's working differently in he's not a cookie cutter each one of us you're unique and he's not going to work in any two of you the same way but he's going to do a work and he has he's very serious about what he's doing and that's bringing you to maturity so and again exodus three he didn't say it's 400 years time i'll go down he says no i've heard the cry i've seen the reflection what about me and you what's he waiting on you the time is up but there has to be a condition remember what he said how many of these things he said you know we're growing into the fullness of the erection we're growing into the fullness of the stature of jesus christ we have to be so much like him all of these things have to be in place are they what's working in your life are those things taking place is he molding you is this shaping you are you dying to the things of the world how about your conscience oh it's very alive and well what about your imagination no i don't even want to go there what about your affections leave me alone and you expect to get out of here listen if he had to deal with the prophet that way if he had to say i had what was he doing he was taking me moving me so that i wouldn't be affected by this outside man i wouldn't be affected by my reason i wouldn't be affected by my imagination i wouldn't be affected by he says because this inside man that he had to get me to doesn't reason at all it doesn't go by sight it doesn't go by analysis it doesn't go by mental it goes only by the word of god and that's where he has to get us to if he did that to the first one coming to maturity i'm going to ask you a question wasn't he the first one in the bright age waved over the people this life look at this life look at how mature it was look at the son of god isn't what did brother brown say there's more common what about me and you isn't he going to do the same thing to me and you we have to mature we have to we have to grow and listen i'm going to say something oh i hope you don't you might hate me after this listen i don't care what your church or what your pastor it's you and god and you can't use jason as an excuse and my people can't use me excuse hoffman you're a miserable failure i know i'm a miserable failure but i'm going to do everything i can to point you to jesus christ because he's the only hope you got and he's the only hope i got and he's going to do the work because he said he would and he said he's with me and he said he would stay with me and tell every word of god considering concerning me is fulfilled right i won't leave you until every word i've spoken to you is done and that's what he's saying to you and i today he's with you to do it so these things look impossible how can he do this how can he take me to this place if you loved him that's how if you surrender that's how if you resist it won't happen if you tell him you don't want to go there he's a gentleman he won't take you there if you tell him you're satisfied he'll leave you alone if you tell him you're not interested in growing don't worry about it you can stay as a dead as a doorknob and he'll leave you alone but the seed of god is hungry the seed of god is thirsty and the seed of god is very absorbent and the seed of god cries out i want all that you can give me i want everything and i'm open every single day i want more today than i had yesterday i want more tomorrow than i had today listen okay am i too late what time is it is it late i don't even okay how can this happen go with me to exodus we had in genesis our text today that told us how it's going to happen but here it is also exodus chapter 3. moses is before the burning bush okay god is with you my friend each one of you listen he has called you to walk with him and don't you dare mistake a walk with the church from a walk with him isn't it brother and how much churchianity there is in this message i'm okay because i go to such and such a place i've heard those words i go to such and such a place i said under such and such a pastor i'm okay you're not okay you're deceived you're delirious listen do you remember the message perfect faith and i don't even know because this has been on my heart so much do you know what he says about bride condition rapturing condition huh so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith i mean substance faith he's isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ now you're getting into bride material listen to me now you're getting into rapturing condition okay that means for each one of us not just the pastor not just the deacons not just the trustees that means every one of you amen that means the laity every single person listen to what he says every individual walks in a world with god alone nobody's in there but you and him this is his words not mine he gives the orders you pack them out whatever he says there's not a shadow of a doubt anywhere you walk right in if the lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it just the same that's perfect faith now i don't know of any other place where he's described rapturing condition and bride material so clearly but i'm going to ask you a question are you there i know of so many people that have a wonderful relationship with the church but have no relationship whatsoever of god where's your relationship well i sing in the choir i play the piano i do this no i'm not asking you that i'm saying where's your walk with god because he says you walk in a world with god alone nobody's in there but you and him he packs he gives you the orders and you pack them out you're that obedient son and i've said ever since i read this years ago i said brother jason i said i got to get the people to that place we have to do everything we have to get all of you to this place where you're walking with god alone you hear his voice you hear his orders to you you're obedient and there's that beautiful obedient sonship again don't replace it with churchianity oh i go to church oh i'll go to wednesday nights mostly i'm pretty good oh i did my duty let's get on with life huh oh you know i'm so sick of that i am so sick of it i'm so sick of people saying oh that was a good sermon let's go play football oh that was a good sermon let's go have a picnic i can't stand it anymore where is the word of god having its effect will you become a prisoner to jesus christ you you and him because that's the only thing that matters numbers don't matter buildings don't matter because you're the church not this building you're the church it's you and him it's you and your walk do you even know he loves you do you even know he wants your fellowship do you even know that he's longing to hear from you when's the last time you spent an hour in prayer do you even know what that's like when's the last time you've been on your knees on with your bible in your hand weeping over the bible and tears running down on those pages of the bible when's the last time and he's waiting and he's waiting and he's waiting oh it's wednesday let's go to church what sunday we'll go to church again oh let's get home and do our thing if doing your thing is different than the word of god you are deceived and you're going to be incredibly disappointed someday what's your thing what is it well i you know i got these ambitions what about his ambitions what about his life huh where is this reality in the bride of jesus christ exodus 3 i'm sorry here is god coming to you and he says i want you no i don't want just part of you i want you i want all of you i love you so much i'm jealous over you i don't want to share you i don't want to share you with the world i don't want to share you with devils out there i want you i am love so here is moses and he's been down in egypt then he's been on the backside of the desert now he's at the burning bush you know the story but here's a god that comes to him and in verse 12 he has the most beautiful thing let's go to 11 moses said to god who am i that i should go to pharaoh and that is that i should bring the children forth who am i well why do you want to ask the same question to god who am i who am i i'm just joe blow i'm just trying to work myself way through this life huh who are you you're his bride verse 12 he says certainly i will be with you and this shall be a token unto you now i have to read this to you because it's the out of the tanakh version it's a hebrew version of the old testament and it's so rich would you read it would you read 312 12. okay which word oh just read that verse and he said certainly come up here brother so they can hear i wanted the people exodus 3 12 and he said certainly i will be with thee and this shall be oh wow i love this yeah yes yes and this shall be a token unto thee that i have sent thee when thou has brought forth the people out of egypt okay now i want you to read the tanakh version this no it's this um i have it here bro that's another translation yeah it's called the tanakh okay but moses said unto god who am i that i should go to pharaoh and free the israelites and he said i will be with you that's a sign that it's me the very name of god in his name is his presence and he says to you this is how you know it's me i'm there i'm with you and i'm going to fulfill this word you can't do it and i know you can't but you know what i can because i'm god and you know what you can't be god but i'm very good at being god just let me be but isn't that the most thing he says certainly i will my be with you this is how you know it's me that's talking it's my presence is with you and brothers and sisters that goes down through the whole scripture that's how i know this is so perfect there but then jason type on the word token this shall be a token unto you in that same verse and read the word token to them in the ancient hebrew that's the whole sermon that's what i was asked to do okay so the word token verse 12 this shall be a token this shall be a sign and in fact is it's everywhere that he uses the term token yeah and so he says so the ancient hebrew is a pictograph of an ox um it's a picture of an ox and then a cross which is a picture of two cross sticks used to make a sign or mark combine these two pictures represent an ox moving toward a mark this is ancient hebrew okay when plowing a field with oxygen the plowman drives the auction toward a distant mark in order to keep the furrows straight if i may you remember brother brown i'm talking about elisha the thing that attracted god's attention is elisha kept his rose just straight and god knew if he cared that much about the furrows of his of his garden or his his crop he would care that much about his word all right so it's about getting your rose straight so he says um the the plowman drives the auction towards a distant mark in order to keep the furrows straight a traveler arrives at his destination by following a mark the traveling toward a mark destination or person this is token this is the word this is all in the word token this is a this is the same word in exodus everywhere 12. yeah this is genesis 6 yeah the covenant in the in the cloud the rainbow it's all do you know what it means listen brothers excuse me yeah keep going but i just want to say this you're on a journey you're traveling the world walk of god is a journey you have to keep moving moving is life stationary is death what happens when you get old and you get ready to die you quit moving yeah look at a little baby squirming all over look at the young people they love what do you call those places amusement parks why let's move let's move in every way we can possibly move right we get our age we're slowing down okay the arrival of one to a mark so that's a token the arrival of one to a mark a you is an individual who has arrived to me the coming toward a mark and then it goes into a standard flag with the family mark hangs as a sign an agreement or covenant by two where a sign or mark of the agreement is made as a reminder to both parties moving at something i'm moving at something there you go we're moving yeah yeah they have a destination we don't no stagnation is allowed around here no stationary you got to keep moving every day is different than the day before we're in a new place with god every single day right okay what was it you might be under a con unconditional covenant but you're still moving yeah you might be under an unconditional covenant of grace but god still had to see the maturity in his son abraham are you with me there's still something that he's doing even in an unconditional because you have done this thing because you've been obedient because you've come to this place where you denied all your own thinking all your own reasoning all your thing and lifted up a a knife to slay your own son what who would do something like that nobody accepts somebody that's fully trusting their god and totally denied every single sense that they had listen i told you god brings every single person to a place where that he's that they had to deny every single thing this life told them now i'm going to let's go to kedish okay what did their eyes tell them there's big people there what did their reasoning say they're stronger than me what did their affection say oh man those leeks and garlics were pretty good every one of their senses spoke against them and nobody could go against their senses except two men who says i'll stand alone on the word of god and deny every single thing that everyone's single sense of mind tells me and i'll go over and only two could do it think of that but if you're willing he'll take you by the hand and be with you and it's a journey the very word token is journey we're on a journey we're moving we're moving every day we're moving farther farther away from the world and closer into god and closer into the mind of god and closer into having the mind of god because we have to have his mind brother branham he had to move him to that inside man he had to he says i have to get you there if i'm going to do anything with you and look what he got out of that man huh listen that was the most astounding statement i've ever read because it's the only place i know well there's another place i found out let me read it see if i can find this here's another one why he explained the flood and losing his wife and losing his dad and losing this baby okay he was moving me to that inside person i couldn't he couldn't use me well as long as i still had my own reasoning think about that jason that's scary he can't use you as long as you're using your own brain up there submit to his your own conscience your own reasoning your own imagination your own affections nope they're plugged by the devil you got to get rid of them here's another quote when i lost my baby my little sharon that was the one thing that stumbled me i said how can that be for good how can it be for the good and months later when i seen her standing there and all the beauty of a young girl speaking to me standing by the side of that old wagon broken down i knowed here's what he said if she would have lived she might have turned out wrong god had to take her when she was tender and sweet think of that i'll see her again i know i'll see her i know beyond a shadow of a doubt i think of my wife 22 years old taken just a mere girl like a mother here with the papers of the headline a young mother just dies oh my how my heart bled i didn't know what to do but today i know it was all working for my good i know the life had to be ground and twisted and squeezed to get what was in it out listen to what he says there was too much branham does that scare you a little bit there was too much branham in there had to be squeezed out before god could make himself known listen to this there's too much you in you that's his words not mine i'm reading there's too much you and you till god had to squeeze it out through trials and while that squeezing was coming on it's hard but after a while the skies clear back and you can see the purpose of god then you cry i know my redeemer lives and at that last day he'll stand on the earth that's pretty amazing huh it's too much me and me i guarantee you there's too much you and you i know it it's too much us in us listen my brothers and sisters my question today he's still working you're perfect you're sinless you're spotless but you're not mature and i'm to work that out in you if you allow me to if you allow me to because i love you and i want you with me we got a ways to go we got a little journey to take take my hand exodus 3 12. i'll be with you i'll be with you you can't do it but i can i'll be with you that's how you know it's me it's my presence with you exodus 6 real quick then we'll quit god's rehearsal of what he's going to do notice what he says let's go to verse 2 and god spake unto moses and said unto him i am the lord j h w h capital l o r d that's the name of god over and over look at verse 3 as i appeared unto abraham and isaac and to jacob by the name of almighty god that's el shaddai but by my name jehovah i wasn't made known why he didn't appear to abraham in redemption brother branham talks about this very much he loved to preach out of the book of exodus exodus is the book of redemption he says everything he's doing and exodus is doing now today it's perfect time okay so by the name of jehovah okay j h w h that's the holy name of god so holy that the jews to this day cannot even utter that name because they know if they utter the name it brings his presence down and they would die but we are under the blood this is holiness but what did he say in chapter 3 this is my name and my name means i'm going to be with you think when you're baptized in the precious name of the lord jesus we know so little of the blessings that are there for us brothers and sisters when you're baptized in that precious name of the lord jesus you have you're surrounded you're immersed in his nature and because everything is in that name his nature is in his name his word is in his name his presence is in that name i'm with you this is how you know it's me what do you say to joshua i'll be with you huh what do you say what did jesus say i'll be with you how long till the end of the earth right i'm gonna be with you i'm gonna say i'm not gonna leave you i won't forsake you i'm here i'm with you to do what like you said you know what i'm here to do i want to fulfill my word in you i'm here for that i'm here for you will you believe me for that so here we are exodus i wasn't known to abraham by that name jhwh because that wasn't redeeming that was the seed establishment in redemption he makes his name dome in redemption it's jhwh the lord jesus christ jesus in redemption the name of god look at verse 4 i've established my covenant with them to give them the land of canaan in the land of their pilgrim i'm taking you we're going on a journey i'm taking you to the new jerusalem yep you're going to be there with me we got quite a journey to go through and it's through a lot of deserts and a lot of terrible things but you know what i'm gonna be there with you every step of the way i'm there i'm gonna pull you through because you are my covenant child and i will not leave you until every word that i've spoken concerning you is fulfilled that's your god so there he tells them look at verse 5. i have heard the groanings of the children of israel whom the egyptians kept keeping bondage and i have remembered my covenant wherefore say unto the children watch i am the lord capital lordy there's his name look at i will bring you i will bring you who's doing it you him i will bring you from the burdens of the egyptian what's the next one i will read you out of their bondage what's the next one i will redeem you with a stressed out arm verse 7 here's another i will take you to me for people next one i will beat you to a god and you will know that i am the lord your god that brings you out from the burdens of the egyptians and i will bring you to the land he tells you before they start i'm going to tell you then you're going to be there now listen as soon as he goes and tells them these things he takes them out for testing you know he takes them out and there's no water and they say you brought us out here to die they didn't hear a word he said because look at verse 9 read it out loud with me would you and moses spake unto the children of israel but they hearken not unto moses for what anger and for what they couldn't hear a word he said those words meant nothing to him so then when they went out into the testing they didn't have those words to gird them up they couldn't hear the words because of this they couldn't hear the words because of this they couldn't hear the words because of this their all of their senses told them they couldn't hear it if they would have heard only two men heard do you know that two two out of two million heard the words of god question when they were out there in the wilderness and they were all complaining okay what'd they say it's hot was it hot yep it's dry was it dry yeah they were hungry yup they were thirsty yup why didn't moses say that why didn't joshua say that because they had the word of god in them that said you know what i don't care if it doesn't rain today or tomorrow or next year if i have to go a year without water he's going to do something on my body because i got the word of god that is more powerful than any drought or anything else and that's where he has to take these people to a place where they deny every physical thing to stand alone on the word of god and that's all they got and are you willing to go there because he might take us there you might be tried like you've never been tried before listen i know the bride doesn't have to go through persecution but don't tell me you're not going to be tried trying is the greatest thing you can do so brother branham tells us but all of the types here everything is then he puts man in a position on purpose where they have to deny every single thing their senses tell them to stand alone on the word of god think of that and this journey is a journey and everything in the journey is going to say you know what he's not here that was her testimony he's not here you brought us here to die listen i want you to remember these words okay silence god gets very quiet you're in a time of testing silence never means absence you remember that silence never means absence he was there watching over every step and the ones that had the faith to believe that i'm going to stand alone on the word of god i don't care how hot i am i don't care how empty my belly gets i don't care how big those giants are because when he said take the land do you know what when he said go take the land they couldn't because of this and because of this and because of this right i'm going to ask you how much does this and this and this play in your life right now tell me tell me you can deny it look at you look at me we're very much in the flesh aren't we that he's with you to do in you and for you and through you what you could never do yourself all you have to say is here i am father i believe every word i don't know how it's going to happen but it's going to happen okay it's going to i will not leave you until i have fulfilled every word of god in you those words stand for the bride of jesus christ for every one of you every one of you wherever you are in life you follow him you follow him god bless you all wow i've never been given an opportunity to come up and help the preacher preaching it's like a dream come true my amen wow that was quite remarkable amen we're going to go to prayer and um got a couple of requests that came in and if anyone listening has any that they forgot to get in if you get them to me quickly directly try to get them on and if i can get them right away we're not going to delay i know it's uh children got to get up for school and adults up for work so we're going to let you go shortly but wasn't the word rich tonight my i so so enjoyed that i knew that i would i had talked to brother don we had breakfast he and i and brother jd and he cracked a little bit of that open and man i've been feasting on it all week long i've been i got on my bible study and started preaching some of that stuff about the token man it was tremendous friends that you know when you when you think about every time in the bible that god is going to bring somebody to a position of greatness like he did to abraham like he did to jacob like he did whoever it was or all the way to our day brother branham or to you and i and he's taking us to the highest echelon that's ever been achieved a global rapture of his bride so whenever he's going to do something like that he always if you look in the scripture he always starts him on a journey you know he comes to i thought that was so remarkable that abraham already had abraham had already invested 25 years in believing that he would be the father of many nations and now the one element he's got one element after 25 years to make that happen he's got a child and now the single element that took 25 years to even arrive and now years of life and now that's about to be lost but you know abraham believed god and his faith didn't waver even when he says the lad and i will go and the lad and i will return and what a faith that he knew that even if he slew him god would have to raise him up because he was operating on a promise and after 25 years he still wasn't done with his journey was he jacob comes after a lot of life already and dealing with esau and dealing with the the porridge and you know the having to run from esau and in the middle of the night it comes to bethel house it's going to be it's going to be the house of god and god says now i'm sending you on a journey and this here's the part that's going to be true every time i'm sending you on a journey and when you get back to this to this place you're gonna know you've been on a journey but here's what i want you to know jacob i will be with you every step of the way and i will never leave you i will not forsake you that's what that word leave means i won't fail i won't forsake i won't abandon you you know and you know i thought about the message coming in this hour and the mighty angel descending once he came to do what to take a bride to her perfection you know what his message is now you're going on a journey bride and we've been on a journey for these last 50 plus 60 years since the opening of the seals but you know what he says now that i'm here i won't leave you until we're done and we're all it gives me new meaning you know how many times we've said we're all in this thing together well i hope you realize
