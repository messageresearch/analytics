joel chapter 2 if you have your bible straight to the word tonight thank you musicians amen you love the lord i sent a uh video there to the gmail if you have that just ready um we'd like to maybe display it if we have time here i'm going to move this to the side josh i'll be on this mic here and then joel chapter 2 i'd like to preach to you tonight on restoring years restoring years amen joel chapter 2 very familiar amen scripture god bless all of our visitors amen here tonight still with us for the sal and his family amen the different ones amen maybe we don't know but god bless you pray that the word is a blessing to you tonight amen let's just begin reading here i want to take as a title restoring years and you're going to see just here in a moment amen why where we're going with this so joel chapter 2 let's just begin reading here at verse 21 fear not o land be glad and rejoice for the lord will do great things say amen tonight be not afraid you boost beast of the field for the pastors of the wilderness to spring for the tree beareth her fruit the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength be glad then you children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of wheat and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil and i will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten the canker worm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that i am in the midst of israel and that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed lord jesus we thank you father for your word tonight lord it's in that that we rest our hope our strong consolation lord as the apostle paul says you've given us lord so we pray god that these words that we have here to speak tonight may you settle our spirits may you settle our minds lord god i pray father that we just take this moment that we have here tonight and just focus in on you lord for what you would want to say we ask it in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated here tonight i like and i don't have these i wish that we did have time to put them on the screen i'm just going to read you amen a few things that the prophet of god had to say about this but it's amazing when you look at this uh this book of joel and and i believe that we have so much that we have been given by the message of the hour amen about this whatever you just did on the adjustment uh undo it i can't hear myself now i might need to just turn this there it's amazing when you look at this book of joel and he comes 10 years after obadiah and the bible tells us that he joel's message is going to speak specifically to the southern kingdom of judah and we don't have time especially on a wednesday to teach too much in this but i believe it's really elementary for most of us knowing that israel split into two kingdoms and so joel's message is going to come specifically to the southern kingdom it doesn't reference the northern tribes at all but the bible speaks of this in the time the scripture says about the time we would guess the dates would be around the time of king uzziah and we all remember that king really well uzziah king uzziah was a prosperous man israel enjoyed the prosperity and the success of this godly man for most of his life and you remember that in isaiah 6 isaiah begins to prophesy and he says that that the year that the king you he says the year that king uzziah died i saw the lord seated on a throne high and exalted and so this was this was what what isaiah is saying directly or indirectly was that with the death of king uzziah judah lost their king and and and and they lost that golden period that monarchy of of great uh success and and great prosperity and and there was really after uzziah there was no king uh for for judah after uzziah and at that time isaiah isaiah it says but i seen the lord high and lifted up so when man's kingdom ends god's kingdom begins and so when when uzziah dies isaiah says in the year that king uzziah died i seen the real king the real monarch the real amen uh king judah had lost a king but they had been given the real king i'm glad we have that king in our hearts here tonight and so that means that joel lives during this period in uh of this golden age of of uzziah and he's going to rule for 52 years uzziah is going to rule and the bible records in those 52 years that for israel this is a great time of great success of great blessing great bounty and every aspect when you study historically israel was uh had was in a season not just uh monetarily not just with money but their military was stronger than it it had ever been before their the administration that they were under the uh economically commercially industry everything was really going really good uh these would be what you'd call years of the bible would would call years of fatness and years of plenty and the bible says and it speaks of king uzziah in second chronicles you don't have to turn chapter 26 it says his fame spread as far as the border of egypt because he had became very powerful it says his fame and spread far and wide he was greatly helped and became very power powerful second only historians will say that this time of prosperity is second only to king solomon and so it was a great time and joel mentions this and is when you read joel 1 and and as he begins to prophesy he mentions this great time of prosperity where their vats were now that's not what we read in joel 2 but this when before joel's prophecy starts to go forth i'm letting you understand the setting that god's people were under because the message that you read that comes to israel deals directly more not so much with their physical condition or their natural condition but god's word always speaks to the spiritual condition you see to god your spiritual condition is really all that really matters now our physical life and our emotional life and all of those things are important to god but ultimately it's our spiritual condition that god is the most concerned with in so much that god will break your physical condition if it means it improves your spiritual condition i will say that again god will break your physical condition your health your money your social life whatever it is if god has to disrupt you're here tonight if god has to disrupt you physically to fix you spiritually then he's a heavenly father and as a heavenly father he'll do what he sees best for his children and you know it's often hard brother adam speaks of that no one likes spanking you take a small child and you see an error in that small child no no real mother likes to spank that child no real father likes to spank that child or enact discipline upon them but if you really love them brother branham says if you really love them even if it hurts you or hurts your feelings you'll correct the error of that child because why because their ultimate condition what they're going to be in life is more important to you as a mother as a father it's more important to you what they are becoming than what they are right now let me say that again i feel like some of you are just distracted so just pay attention here real close especially here at the beginning god cares more about where you're going to be than where you're at right now god puts more in what god is doing in your life maybe you don't understand what's happening or why certain pieces of your life are missing or why certain pieces seem out of joint or why things have been maybe mixed up a little bit but just remember god never really looks at the current condition but he looks at what you're going to be so god never gets discouraged by your failures right now god never gets discouraged by your by by how low you are right now so we shouldn't get discouraged by what our conditions look at right now don't ever get discouraged at what your life looks at right looks like right now what your children's life looks at like right now what your home looks like right now but say god i believe you're bringing me to something because you have a vision of me of what you want me to be and so whatever happens to me right now i'm going to believe it's because you're concerned and you're trying to bring me to something that you've envisioned for my life and so joel begins to prophesy to this he says their vines their their vines were flourishing were plentiful their vats were overflowing the fig trees the pomegranates were producing and the apples were producing and all the fruit trees were loaded down it was a it was a time of great spiritual high with our physical high naturally the land in israel was fertile it was producing it was green the barns were filled to the brim the olive oil was running over like a river and i'm not making this up this is right out of the bible and joel chapter 1 you can look at verse 10 let's look at that joel 1 verse 10. let's just look at some of these here for a moment joel chapter 1 brother chapstick we have that and let's just pull up verse 10 and then we'll go to verse 17. and joel begins to speak about this and he says the field notice this here in verse 10 i want you to look at this and he says the the field is wasted the land mourneth for the corn is wasted the new wine is dried up the oil languisheth go to verse 17 if you could and he says he says the seed is rotten under their clods the garners are laid desolate the barns are broken down for the corn is withered next verse just go to the last one how did the beast he says how do the beasts groan the herds of cattle are perplexed because they have no pasture yea the flocks of sheep are made desolate so what does this prosperity bring it doesn't always bring the best spiritual condition sometimes the greatest prosperity brings the worst spirituality i said sometimes the greatest prosperity brings the greatest spiritual decay and sometimes the greatest poverty brings the greatest spiritual revival i want you to notice what moses warns them in deuteronomy chapter 6. this was amazing in verse 10 and he's warned in israel and he says and it shall be when the lord thy god shall have brought thee into the land which he which he swore unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob this is deuteronomy 6 10 to give thee great and goodly cities which thou buildest not verse 11 and house is deuteronomy 6 verse 11 and the house is full of all good things which thou fill us not and wells digged which thou digest not vineyards and olive trees which thou plant us not when thou shall have eaten and be full then he says then beware hold on paul's mute the screen for a second mute the screen just for a second so god says when you come into the land he says you're going to find that you have houses that are full of all good things when you come into the promised land he says your houses you're going to find they're going to be filled with all good things that you filled not in other words you didn't do this god did it look pull up verse 11 again brother travis i just want to reference it he says house is full of all good things which thou fill us not and wells digged which thou digest not in other words there was no labor involved there was no stress there was no sweat you know when you work for something you can appreciate it when you put your blood and your sweat and your tears into something and you give your effort then you can appreciate it and you know what it means to have because you've gained it you've done it you take he gives the example of the well and he says when you've dug a well that well will be precious to you if you if you're the one you know no drill back in those days no big well we had a well dug when our property guy pulled up with the truck and big thing big uh tower raised up and by the end of the day he had dug 185 feet could you imagine what it was in those days when there was no machinery to dig that well could you imagine and you're digging it by the sweat of your brow and the the your own back breaking under the load of the however long months or if you're just one or two people months of work but you know what it meant when you've worked for something when you've labored over something then it brings on such a you you value it you you will protect it you will defend it you it means something to you i'm not saying you all have to go out and dig your own wells but i guarantee if you've paid that guy three thousand dollars to dig your well that will mean something to you if you've worked for something if you've worked hard at something and you you've you you you've gained notice what he says wells verse 11 which thou dig it's not vineyards and olive trees which you plant us not when thou shall have eaten and be full so what is what is the warning from god when god gives you a blessing a spiritual blessing and what is the holy spirit the holy spirit is a spiritual blessing it's a free it's free grace that god has given you it's a spiritual bounty or a spiritual increase and god has just given it to you out of his own goodness out of his own because he's a good kind heavenly father he gives you good things he fills your house with good things and so moses then warns them and says but because that you did nothing to receive those spiritual blessings verse 12 then beware lest thou forget the lord which brought thee out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage because when you're given something you don't value it the same as if you had worked for something that's just the nature of all of us here tonight you forget it you forget about it and he says i'm warning you when you get over there god's gonna bless you he's gonna fill your houses he's gonna give you vineyards that you didn't plant but don't forget the lord don't forget god who brought you up out of egypt don't forget the spiritual benefits that you enjoy you did nothing to deserve it he says you did nothing to deserve and this is exactly what happens this is exactly what happens to israel out of all of this prosperity out of all of this increase out of all this great physical uh uh uh fatness that they that they enjoyed the land being fertile and out of this great wealth they had begin to forget the lord and so what does god do the bible records that god sends them a plague why does god send a plague is it to punish them you know it's so important how we look at these things because if you look at it as punishment then you look at god as being cruel and god's not cruel why does he send the plague of locusts does he do it out of revenge you did me wrong so i'm going to do you wrong no it wasn't that about that at all why does god send the the plague of locusts uh is it is it because god is cruel or he's devised something to make them suffer just in some maniacal way that he just that's what that's what the secular world would have you believe but god does this because he's trying to fix their spiritual condition and anytime god has to bring something to your life it's for a good purpose and a good reason because as the song says he's a good good father that's who he is he's not a bad father he's a good father he's a heavenly father and so anything god brings about in your life no matter what you physically have to suffer god says it's for your own spiritual benefit and at the end of the day it's only spiritual things that lasts amen so god sends them this plague of locusts and chapter two is all about this repeated plague i want to show you if you have that video brother travis you could display it here for a moment i want you to see this just for a second what and we may not play the whole thing it should be in the email if you have it good if you don't i'll skip it i was tossed whether to play because it's about two minutes long okay good you can play that and then just turn the volume up nice and loud if you could just for a moment yep go ahead try that i think that's the right one yeah yeah yeah yeah press play and then to just turn the volume make sure the volume is nice and loud on the computer gotta unmute the computer channel actually it's not going to i've got it set up don't worry about that i want the volume's not important i want you to look this is madagascar they're suffering a plague the worst plague in 60 years of locusts because when you read that in the bible and you think a plague of locusts you know what does that really mean well this is sort of what it looks like and you know what does locusts do the the the man is saying that all of their crops all of the effort everything that they had put in for that year had been destroyed because those locusts go through and they eat everything they don't just eat the the the corn they eat the stalk they eat the tassel they eat the everything they they eat it down to nothing to where everything is completely destroyed and it's and it's out of control it completely takes over this is what god warns them of and and he gives them a natural disaster uh you can take that down and you can take that down that's just fine i want to give you a visual for that i want you to listen to what brother branham says here in leadership in 1965 he says oh god he says let me go lord don't don't leave me behind jesus let me go with you father i don't want to stay here on this earth to watch these tribulations coming on i say amen i don't want to stay here in this insanity i don't want to stand here when hideous sights the people losing their mind we look at man trying to act like beasts and look like beasts and the women trying to look like animals with the paints on their face knowing that these things are predicted to happen that the thing will they'll go so insane to locust will raise up that's revelations 9 with hair like women to haunt the women and teeth like lions and things that he says that you've said the mental condition of the people will be completely gone and he says we see it in the making right now we see it in the making right now the world going completely insane it's just a preview of what's coming it's just a preview you think plague they call covet to plague go read revelations 9 you'll read what a plague is what a real plague is it's just a little hiccup a baby a a little a little in miniature something so small that has wrecked the entire world and the bible says that there's things coming upon the earth to where men's hearts would have would have a heart attack heart failure over fear of those things coming upon the earth i say like god's prophet said lord don't leave me here how many feel that way so let me go with you say lord let me go with you father don't let me be here to experience those tribulations don't let me be here and experience that purge so purge me now lord purge me of anything unlike you let me go through the purge right now by the by the let the holy spirit be a teacher to me he says he says uh this is this is just a message here and god begins to say this in joel chapter 12 chapter 2 verse 12. he says therefore also now saith the lord turn you even to me with all your heart joel 2 joel chapter 2 verse 12. therefore i also now say the lord turn you even to me with all your heart and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning and rind your heart not your garments do you have that joel too he says go back to verse 12. therefore also now say the lord turn you even to me with all your heart have you have you done that i asked myself that question i've read this i read this and said lord have i turned to you with all my heart amen because so often we we turn some of us some part of us some aspect or some area but i say lord let me make sure that if i'm repenting if i'm turning around i turn to you with all my heart lord do you feel that way here tonight and say lord i want to turn to you with all that's within me he says say the lord turn you into me with all your heart and with fasting and with weeping you think that fasting doesn't mean anything to god i guarantee you it does you think weeping doesn't mean anything to god if you're not careful the devil will try to so microsize that and minimize that's not so important it's just important that you pray god says i see your mourning i see your weeping you want to get a hold of the holy spirit for your family for your job for your health for your children for your church god says then turn to me with all your heart i'll see your mourning i'll see your fasting i'll see your weeping he says in verse 13. he says and rend rip tear don't tear your clothes you see this is what israel the the the the priests would do they'd rip their garments and take ashes and sackcloth and and they'd go for i forget how many days it was they'd wear sackcloth and this this uncomfortable sackcloth is what it was this burlap that was we've taught on that hair before the burlap that was so uncomfortable and itchy and itch them to death you just you put that sackcloth on and then they'd take them as that as if that wasn't bad enough they'd take ashes and then just pour ashes and smear ashes all over themselves and they'd go through the city you know what they were doing repenting you know what they were doing they were trying to make amends with god and how many times do we do that and and and we come to god with ashes and sackcloth and oh god i'm so sorry no lord would you god says don't don't don't come to me with just outward external emotions don't don't come with me just outward external tears but rend your heart not your garments surrender your heart let it be a what we need here tonight is less external uh turning and attrition to god and more internal where a heart can turn to god and say lord i'm doing this because there's something inside of me i'm sick of myself i'm sick of my ways i'm sick of myself going in the same direction for years and i want to turn my entire heart to you lord. he says turn your hearts turn into the lord your god for his gracious i'm so glad for that he's merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repenteth him of the evil who knoweth if he will return and repent notice this and leave a blessing behind him even a meat offering in the drink over it lord your god blow the trumpet in zion sanctify a fast call a solemn assembly gather the people gather the people sanctify the congregation you think gathering's not important to god it was all the way throughout the entire bible gather the people sanctify the congregation assemble the elders gather the children those that suck the breast let the bridegroom go forth of his out of his chamber and the bride out of her closet let the priests the ministers of the lord weep between the porch and the altar let them say spare thy people o lord and give not thine heritage to reproach that the heathen should rule over them wherefore should they say among the people where is there god this is god trying to sow his word into their hearts he's given his desire i want you to repent i want you to have a good a heart that's irrendering before me he says let him let him call isabel a solemn assembly let the priest the minister of the lord weep between the porch and the altar you know what the reaction to joel's first call to repentance was that most people you know you know what you know what the bible records that after these words from the prophet of joel telling them to repent and to turn to repent and to turn and repent and turn you know what they did they went out and got drunk yeah they went out and they got drunk most of them most of them just drunk themselves into a stupor people have two different reactions to warning to judgment when judgment is warned upon someone's life they'll either bury themselves deeper to mute out that sound of conviction some people repent some people turn some people rin their hearts others get drunk man i thought you ought to be shouting and doing jericho marches when i said that it's true certain people you get to such a place to where darkness is so around you and the bible says they love darkness more than light when the light was shined the darkness comprehended not they loved their darkness more than their light and rather than hearing the words of warning whether you know i'm so afraid sometimes the word of god can just callous people's hearts sometimes and you do that of your own free moral agency and your own choice because you won't respond to the word of god when god's trying through sermons and through difficulties and through locusts in your life eating things away and rather than turning with your whole heart and repenting you just intoxicate yourself with more and you go deeper and you go further and further he said brother matt does that really happen that happens all the time and he promises them and he says if they do god says if you just rend your heart then i'll restore the years that the locusts have eaten he promises if there's total repentance then here's what you'll get total restoration when there's total repentance there's total restoration when god sees a total heart that totally turns for him god says we can forget about all those judgments and all those things in the past i'll reverse the curse from your life and i'll restore to you all the years you've wasted i'll restore to you all the love that was lost all the years that you toiled going the wrong direction i'll cancel it all god says i'm going to clear the debt you know what repentance does i'm just going to preach very nuts and bolts here so just listen to me you know what how powerful repentance is you know powerful repentances when a person really repents there's true repentance is there something that there's false repentance but when there's true repentance and in order to get to true repentance you've got to really humble yourself you've got to completely humble your spirit humble your attitude don't hold on to it at all the mental struggles sometimes when god comes and begins to deal with the person's heart and begins to through his own way and only the holy spirit can do that a friend can't do it a mother or father they can they can try and admonish you and and it's good to have admonishment from friends and family but you know the holy spirit can do a an inward work that man can't do and when god begins to deal with your heart and the holy spirit begins to work and move upon your spirit immediately you you realize how fast just underneath the surface is pride and there's self-justification you begin to justify yourself and justify this and in your own mind and then the comparative start and you compare yourself to this person i'm not as bad as that guy and i'm not as bad as at least i'm not over here doing this at least i'm not over here doing this you know brother branham says he says just take your pride and throw it on the ground and stomp it under your feet then god can god can speak to you but until you do that and two there has to be recognition that say i'm wrong i admit that i'm wrong and i'm throwing all my pride down i'm not justifying anything i'm wrong i'm truly repented and god says when there's total repentance there's total restoration can you say amen here when there's total repentance there's total restoration there's complete restoration and it's prophesied it's promised the bible we the bible says there's a great time of restoration and and and and the the the scripture says joel says in joel chapter 2 verse 1 he says the day of the lord cometh for it is nigh at hands the the heavens the the heavens will quake the earth will tremble him not only you know the scripture it says do not only shake uh earth or heaven but it will also shake the earth and he says it's time this is why it says blow the trumpets and sound the alarm get right with the holy spirit and he promises and he says he says here's what i see this is what i see in joe 2 verse 24 we read it we want to read it again he sees floors full of wheat he says flour is full of wheat and the vats overflowing with wine and oil now joe is seeing not years not canker with the cankerworm and the caterpillar and all of the decay and all the rot you see what joel is beginning to do he's beginning to prophesy of what's coming he's beginning to prophesy of not what's here now but what could be god says this is what could be this is what i see this is what i desire this is what i want floors full of wheat and he says vats overflowing verse 24 with wine and oil what is it a prophet only a prophet can do this because a prophet doesn't look at what's right now he sees what's coming and he says don't look at the condition right now but there's a restoration promised there's a restoration coming because god is not a god of decay and corruption and breaking down he's a god of building up he's a god of restoring the years and restoring what's lost and giving back what satan's taken from you and god says i'm prophesying through joel a year of restoration and he says where i'll restore all the famished people will once again eat in plenty he says in verse 26 eating in plenty and fully satisfied hallelujah you showed him plenty be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed the shame the the the shame will lift god's people will eat in plenty he says and be fully satisfied you know what god is doing god through the prophet is beginning to prophesy and he's reminding us saying that that the lord's going to do this this is going to be the lord's doing he's going to execute his plan he's going to he's going to execute a promise and he says in verse 25 and i will restore to you the years that the locusts hath eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you you know david david begins to to to say this about the righteous and he says in psalms of verse chapter 1 verse 1 he says the righteous shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth fruit with leaves that don't wither this is what the righteous shall be the righteous god's family god's elected shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth fruit in the season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper you know what that is that's in the midst of a wicked age in the midst of a world that's falling apart in the middle of satan's eden in the middle of total insanity the righteous shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water who has fruit when the rest of the world is barren who's producing when the rest of the world is going and groping in darkness the righteous shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water this is what god has prophesied of this church of your life of your family of your home i say god i accept it i believe it i claim it i'm making a steak on your promise for my home it won't be a home that's withering it won't be a fruit that's barren but it'll be a fruit overflowing wine filling the weed filling the floors my vats will be overflowing you know this is what god promised in restoration and he says that promise is to to not to the sinner but to the righteous not to those who love their sins but those who are repentant of their sins who've given their whole life over to god david says the ungodly are not so they become weak they become withered blown about by every wind and wave of dark of doctrine compromised christians compromised believers are like likened unto withered trees diseased and corrupted with every every kind of caterpillar and canker worm and palmer worm this is what the devil wants to put upon your life canker worms that eat caterpillars that decay it wants to rob you you say brother matt of what if my health if that if if if if robbing you of your health gets you to turn your back and lose your faith on god satan will attack your health he wants to bring a caterpillar and a locust and a palmer worm and a canker worm to eat away your spirituality to rob you of your intimate see with god and your fervor and your zeal and your fire of the holy ghost satan hates that about you and he'll put anything in your life to trip you up or to hinder the spirit of god if he has to clog your channels with some memory or some bitterness or some jealousy you know what saint's trying to do to make you jealous he's trying to clog up those channels when when satan puts something in your life he wants to take that trial that god meant to perfect you and to bring you character and he wants to begin to eat away at your mind to cause that trial to make you bitter hello to make you bitter to make you disease to make you corrupted to corrupt you to take away your time of you know you know you know what brings spiritual health to your tree so that it won't wither this you see i got to get some sunlight on this seed open the book open the book i got i got to water that seed uh open the book and then water begins to flow when the word of god begins to be read god you you you take that time away with from the rest of the world and shut away with god listen to god's word have it plain in your ear reading the bible every day you know what it's doing it's bringing sun and light and atmosphere to cause that seed to grow so satan will do anything you can to keep that he'll belittle that and devalue that in your life devalue the word of god devalue the message of the hour to value the the the spirit of god in the presence of the lord in your life because he knows that that out that when the when the sun is shining and the plant is healthy there's no cankerworms there's no caterpillars there's no palmer worms there's no there's no fear of doubt and anxiety and stress and worry joel says in verse 12 of chapter 1 he says all the trees of the field are withered joel 1 verse 12 for all the trees of the filter withered for their joy has dried up for their joy notice this the vine is dry the fig tree languishes if you could go to yeah verse 12 perfect uh he says the pomegranate tree the palm tree also the apple tree even all the truth of the filter withered because joy is withered away from the sons of men when satan can rob you of your joy and man there's a lot of joy thiefs in this life there's a lot of joy thiefs satan will bring any kind of thing in your life to rob you of your joy to take away your smile to take away your happiness he'll plant any kind of palmer worm or canker worm that begins to eat that away even if he has to completely delude your mind and you look at things differently and life is just so drab it'll get you to such a condition to where all you see is the negative you know there's a lot of negative in your life i'm sure it's right now you're facing negative but don't ever let the devil allow you to focus on only the negative because you focus only on the negative you become a negative person and a negative person doesn't produce fruit doesn't produce happiness doesn't produce zeal and passion for the lord but negativity always and it's amazing satan will always get you in a negative condition and then he'll put you around somebody else in that same negative condition and negatives attract negatives negatives attract negatives you ever notice that critical people are attracted to other critical people you think that's an accident that's a spirit hello somebody that's a spirit that comes upon people and in the tracks birds of a feather flock together and that same cancerous canker worm will begin to eat away and eat away in it before you know it it's spread through the whole church where was i he'd do anything to rob you of your joy and do anything to rob the church of its joy to take away the joy of the lord because the bible says the joy is your strength the joy of the lord is your strength and listen to me friends you need strength today you need strength today you don't need to add to your list of negatives there's enough in this world you need to add to your positives if the news is making you negative stop reading the news and then if that podcast is making you negative stop listening to it cut it out of your life we need everything we can to enrich our spiritual lives not to destroy it you need every moment of fellowship to enrich that strength because because there's strength in numbers did you know that there's strength in numbers if there's strength in numbers then there must be weakness and solitude and isolation amen this is a wednesday night i can get as practical as we we need to be there's there's there's i i know some covet has brought forced isolation upon a lot of people let me just say this don't be any more isolated than you need to be don't be any more not isolated than you have to be because if there's joy there's strength in numbers and there is when the family of god gets together when the body of christ brings all their licks of fire into the house of god something begins to happen a spirit of revival starts to fall upon the adults and upon the young people upon the ministry and before you know it satan's defeated and the voice of god speaking to his people and there's joy and shouting in the camp and god can do something in that kind of atmosphere i say we need to get behind each of us need to get behind the spirit of god trying to do something in this church and say bring it on lord i want to be a supporter of it i don't want to be a detractor i don't want to be a hindrance lord let my life support what you're trying to do do you feel that way church do you feel that way say lord you're trying to move let me be in the don't let me be in the way don't let me get in your way don't let me be a hindrance let me give my voice of support let me give my my participation and support notice what he says here he says he hath verse 6 he hath the teeth let me make sure it's where i want to go to he hath the teeth of a great lion joel one verse six he hath laid at my vine waste and barked my fig tree you know what that means it means he's chewed it off he's chewed it off verse seven he says he hath laid my waist barked my fig tree it made it clean bear and cast it away the branches thereof are made white imagine remember brother branham goes to that forest there forget what forest it was and he said all the trees were just bleached white you remember that and he says and he says and i just seen he said they and i forget forgive me if i get the story i'm just calling it by remember i think there was some if i remember right some kind of bomb that it went off or some kind of radiation maybe or something had happened and he says he went through that force and said all the trees were he says they were they were white and all the bark had came off and remember he says there was that when the wind would come through he said to make that creepy just that eerie how the prophet of god begins to say he says that it's like the church he says satan's ate away the bark so much dried them up just dried them up gave them so much religion you know just enough religion can make you miserable that's that lukewarm condition that revelations 3 speaks of can make you miserable he says that howling through there he says oh just that little howling wind that came through the trees and he says but then i s i i picked up i tipped over a little rock i think it was a rock and he says i tipped over that little rock and he says and there was a little green sprout he said a little green leaf a little green sprout that had sprouted up think of it in the midst of all that white bleached and all of that death and all of that howling god had protected that one little plant god has preserved its life and notice what he begins to say i will restore the years of that the canker worm that the caterpillar that the palmer worm all my great army he says i'm going to begin to restore it back to you i'm going to restore the joy the years of joy lost i'm going to give you years of joy he says my vain was barked he says embark my tree chewed off the bark the branches thereof are white clean bear blant just completely white bleached white disease dried up wasted desolate broken down it begins to give all these adjectives broken down vineyards laid waste my vines laying waste the seeds the fruit are rotten the trees are have no life you know what he's doing he's not describing the physical condition he's describing the spiritual condition and he says this is you see you look you see a forest of great trees you see great plenty you see great success you see great prosperity but when i the lord your father looks i see bleached white trees death rotten fruit vineyard that's laid waste he's describing so so perfectly that lydiac in church said well i'm rich i'm increased with goods i have needed nothing brother adam says their their their their evaluation of their own condition he says they looked in the mirror of god's word and said look at me i'm i'm good i got everything i'm rich increased with goods i have need of nothing and and god says and knoweth it not that you're miserable you're poor you're blind you're naked you're wretched what a condition to be and sin is so blinding and people that are chained by sin look at themselves oh you might look at your life oh man i got it going on i i got everything my life whole life's ahead of me got all my plans got all my dreams everything's working out you know you know and satan would lie to you and tell you that i was all going good you know just keep going and and you know just just keep on he said just like those he said on pearl harbor the day that it was going to be bombed and he said and that man at that bar tried to warn him and say they're the they're they're coming they've already spotted them they're coming to to destroy and blow everything up oh he says that that woman reached over put her whiskey glass down said oh you get out of here you get out of here you worry wart he said you get out of here speaking negative things can't you you're disturbing the atmosphere man you're messing up the vibe you're ruining the vine for us it was feeling good we were dancing we were grooving we had all the man we were feeling good in here oh but don't you know the they're coming they're going to destroy you you're all going to die he's trying to sound the alarm and blow the trumpet oh get out of here you negative preacher get out of here always trying to you're trying to ruin the atmosphere you know that's what the devil will try to do to you try to whistle you and tell you it's all okay it's all right everything's fine just go back to sleep shh it's just fine it'll rock you to sleep and all the while those japanese were coming going to destroy them all he preaches that in the uh i'm trying to remember the name of that message there but he he says it's the warning signs the sad flashing red light of his coming and he says but everyone's ignoring it they're so that's why we said you either respond with repentance or more alcohol and you'll go deeper and you'll go deeper oh i don't i don't know who this is for here tonight but let me just say that don't don't assess your condition based upon how much money you got don't assess your condition based upon how few of stress that you have or how peaceful your life seems or how many cool friends you have but look in the mirror of god's word and say lord have i made my call in an election short i don't want to look at how how the world views me but how does your word view my heart tonight how does you do it to do i look like a a tree that is bleached and has no fruit in my life lord what does my life look like am i miserable blind poor and naked thinking that i have everything what a condition what a condition to be in an army of canker worms are closing caterpillars eating away eating away robbing outwardly appears as trees that are planted by living water but inwardly they're waterlogged ever seen a water oak before we had two of them go to go down in our backyard hurricane matthew my name's sake came and put down two 70-plus tall trees big children had played around them never knew i i know i know i thought i knew what a you know a good healthy oak tree looked like from the outside completely healthy just looked green leaves and everything on the outside just looked great you know what you know the only thing that changed that the wind yeah the only thing that changed the condition changed my outlook on those trees calamity and calamity revealed the real condition of those trees and calamity peace and prosperity never really tell you what's really in your heart but what how do you respond to calamity and crisis really reveals what's on the inside are you like a tree planted by the rivers of water that water oak looked perfectly healthy 80 70 plus feet tall two of them and just hurricane matthew came through none of my oak trees none of my magnolias none of my pines nothing went down but those two water oaks with just a little bit of wind one of them started coming down others started coming down hit the other one hit a magnolia tree and we came home to a mess got up behind that tree couldn't believe it i thought what in the world what's wrong with these trees realize walk to the back side to where the root ball was like this tree's coming like this walked to the back side and i could see about about probably 15 feet up that tree hollow completely rotten on the inside on the outside looked healthy oh they also looked everything was fine everything was good man life looked good tree's gonna live forever you know the bible says that the fire will try men's works that there's come in a purifying fire and it will try every man's work those that have built their house on hay and on stubble and on sand it tried them and it didn't stand the test the wind the the the the calamity came and they couldn't stand they both fell and came to the ground completely rotten on the inside but outside looked perfectly fine that's why joe joel is saying don't god says don't render the outward clothes but rend your heart make sure you've made your call in an election shore canker worms caterpillars corrupting weakening disease not bearing fruit but spiritually are drying up destruction canker worms doing destructive work eating the bark of the tree eating deep within those that have gotten away from the nearness of the presence of the lord and the nearness of god that canker worm and that caterpillar begins to eat away your faith begins to eat away your joy and you become an unhealthy christian spiritually weak spiritually frail you know why that's that's why so much depression and anxiety and people are put on pills because depression and anxiety and worry and stress all the time prayerless half-hearted are you here tonight so weak joel joe begins to say oh lord in joel 2 verse 17 give not that inheritance or reproach that sin should rule over them why should people be saying where is their god it's what he says says oh lord he says don't give your thy heritage to reproach that the heathen should rule over them he's praying this this is the heart of joel and he's saying lord don't don't let it stay like this and god says i'm not going to let it stay like that i'm not going to let sin just dominate people's lives i'm not going to let your children be carried off at the foreign nations i'm not just going to let the canker worm continue to eat i'm not just going to let the caterpillar keep eating away and to get you to such a state of fear and anxiety but i'm going to restore all the years that they've eaten at you i'm going to bring your children back i'm going to bring and restore your joy i'm going to restore your happiness i'm going to restore saith the lord all that the damage you say what are you going to restore lord all the damage all of the years that satan has had free reign and one day in one moment in one instant in one second might have ate away for years and years and years but in one supernatural moment my brother when you contact the lord jesus and when you really meet him down on your soul and he really does a change inside of you he makes you not he doesn't give you a renovation and and renovate your outward flesh he makes you a brand new person and god says years satan ate away but in one instant i'm gonna restore you i'm gonna take away all the caterpillars and all the diseases and all the bugs that have ate away and in one moment i'm gonna in an instant i'm gonna change what you couldn't change when you really meet the lord oh when you really meet the lord jesus and it's not just a mental experience not just a mental repentance or just because you mentally thought this or you became under conviction but i'm talking about a real experience in the holy spirit when you've really repented of your sins and god accepts that and god does something on you i just want to testify how many contests of how many sinners do we have that god has transformed and changed and you could say he completely changed me i couldn't change myself i tried self-help i tried psychiatry i tried to better myself but when jesus did something inside of me he did what nobody could do he did what he did and he did something to me that i couldn't do for myself he restored he restored all the years and i pray oh god i pray oh god restore the years i say lord restore all the years you say i've lost and lord restore all the years that have been lost let me stand as a mighty army before you could just stand to your feet amen by your heads musicians could return just read that and raise that hand up
