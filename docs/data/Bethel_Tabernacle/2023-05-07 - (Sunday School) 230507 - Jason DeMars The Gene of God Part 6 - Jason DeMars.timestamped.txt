[5:31] [Music]
[5:51] everyone
[5:52] I bless you
[5:54] Let's uh let's go right to the scripture
[5:56] we're going to continue on the gene of
[5:57] God part six
[5:59] stand
[6:00] yeah
[6:04] Romans 9 13.
[6:09] as it is written Jacob have I loved but
[6:12] Esau have I hated let's pray Heavenly
[6:16] Father we ask Lord that your Holy Spirit
[6:18] would come and take your word and break
[6:20] it open to our hearts Lord
[6:22] reveal yourself to us Lord we just want
[6:25] to commit this time lord and the Sunday
[6:28] school and the service into your hands
[6:31] for your glory Lord would you just
[6:32] create an atmosphere that the word would
[6:34] brood over your people Lord and enter
[6:37] into their hearts Lord by faith we ask
[6:39] in Jesus name amen God bless you and be
[6:42] seated
[6:45] so I know brother Jason announced that I
[6:48] was going to be preaching regular
[6:49] service but we switched that up a little
[6:51] bit I took Sunday school and my
[6:52] father-in-law and Brother Don Hoffman
[6:54] will be taking the regular service so
[6:57] just in case that was in your in your
[6:59] mind what and what he's going to preach
[7:01] and do Sunday school what's the deal
[7:02] here
[7:04] so continuing from last week I think we
[7:08] I felt like we made good progress last
[7:11] week getting to where I wanted to go to
[7:12] but I went really fast and there was a
[7:15] lot there so I want to really take the
[7:17] time to
[7:19] really establish more of the things that
[7:21] I said using scriptures and quotes
[7:25] um
[7:25] we had them there and I referred to them
[7:27] but we're going to use more this time so
[7:31] Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated
[7:34] kind of picking up from when I spoke
[7:36] about before right in the same
[7:38] family you have elect and non-elect
[7:42] right in the same family right from the
[7:43] same parents right from the same pool of
[7:46] genetics
[7:47] and as we talked about and we're gonna
[7:50] we're gonna look at this closely is that
[7:52] God took his life
[7:55] when he created Adam he put his life
[7:58] into Adam
[8:00] and and his life into Eve and God's
[8:04] desire and his purpose was to from them
[8:08] bring forth
[8:11] I'll call it the god race the seed
[8:13] predestinated seed of God so that this
[8:16] Earth would be filled with
[8:20] everyone who's made in God's image and
[8:22] likeness Satan came in Temptation
[8:25] against that purpose
[8:27] and injected that hybrid seed into the
[8:32] human race right then we fast forward as
[8:35] time goes on and we get to the the the
[8:38] era leading up to the flood says the
[8:41] sons of God saw the daughters of men
[8:43] that they were Fair two seedlines Keynes
[8:46] line the daughters of men and uh Seth's
[8:50] line the sons of God
[8:53] right so Seth was the son of Adam Adam
[8:56] was the son of God so that life coming
[8:59] forward passing down to Seth but then it
[9:03] goes forward those two lines become
[9:05] hybrid
[9:06] and then we watch and see God says
[9:09] every thought and Imagination of the
[9:11] heart of a man's heart is evil
[9:13] continually I'm going to start over but
[9:15] then what was produced from Adam and ham
[9:18] Shem and japheth and their wives
[9:20] same thing
[9:22] directly to the Tower of Babel
[9:24] dictatorship false religion
[9:26] and so when we look at this the portion
[9:29] that becomes uh is the mystery I believe
[9:33] that God showed to brother Branham
[9:35] through who is this Melchizedek and some
[9:38] of the different sermons is that this
[9:40] this genetic life this life
[9:44] and even through the teaching his
[9:46] teaching on the Virgin birth
[9:49] that genetic life from God is to be
[9:53] passed down through the human race
[9:56] through mother and your mother and
[9:58] father and in one family you can have
[10:02] some children predestinated of God some
[10:06] that are not why because that Gene goes
[10:08] in there and as we looked at it can be
[10:10] dorm it can it can it can be a gene
[10:13] that's inactive
[10:14] so it's not the gene of God is
[10:16] inoperable then the next Generation
[10:18] raise up and it goes through and passed
[10:21] on and it's active
[10:23] right
[10:24] and so again I'm explaining it there's I
[10:27] have quotes behind all this and I want
[10:29] to I want to show you this but that's
[10:31] the portion that if you start to preach
[10:33] this in a denominational Church you'll
[10:36] get a boot out
[10:38] the place because they consider that
[10:41] this idea as complete nonsense complete
[10:45] fanaticism
[10:46] to to say that the genetic life but if
[10:49] because of that they twist the Trinity
[10:51] trinitarian into a trinitarian
[10:53] understanding
[10:54] to make Father Son and Holy Spirit three
[10:57] separate persons because they don't
[10:59] understand the how the life of God works
[11:02] and that to me probably the greatest
[11:05] Revelation that God brought to brother
[11:07] Branham was how the life of God operates
[11:11] and how it works and you see with
[11:14] serpent seed and then you see the
[11:16] necessity that there be a virgin birth
[11:17] why because everyone was tainted by that
[11:20] Serpentine nature every one of us are
[11:23] mixed hybrid right there in our body
[11:27] Soul and Spirit completely so then he
[11:30] has to bypass that totally and then
[11:33] they're the life of God is Born the very
[11:35] the very Son of God
[11:37] who was God himself
[11:39] why was he God himself because the very
[11:41] life of God was in that human body which
[11:44] had a beginning
[11:46] these things these things are are if if
[11:49] you're not amazed and stunned and in awe
[11:51] of them you're missing something because
[11:54] what brother Branham teaches is Inc is
[11:57] absolutely incredible
[11:59] earth-shattering stuff it really is
[12:04] so
[12:06] the word Genesis in the Greek
[12:08] translation
[12:10] uh is the word beginning in the
[12:12] beginning
[12:13] our term Gene it has the same same
[12:15] origin
[12:17] Gene is a unit of heredity which is
[12:19] transferred from a parent to offspring
[12:21] and is held to determine some
[12:23] characteristic of The Offspring
[12:25] Gene speaks of origin in connection with
[12:29] its characteristic our nature and
[12:32] characteristics come from our origin
[12:35] as we spoke about before
[12:38] every aspect of our being
[12:42] comes from our parents our genetic life
[12:45] what we are we're made up of DNA
[12:48] that DNA
[12:50] is what determines what we are
[12:53] that comes from our our parents and the
[12:56] the heretic hereditary line that we come
[12:59] from all is passed down there Body Soul
[13:02] and Spirit
[13:04] all of that
[13:07] and so we looked at this before dominant
[13:10] and recessive genes dominant refers to
[13:13] the relationship between two versions of
[13:15] a gene individuals receive two versions
[13:18] of each gene known as alleles from each
[13:20] parent if the alleles of a gene are
[13:22] different one allele will be expressed
[13:24] it is the dominant gene the effect of
[13:26] the other allele called recessive is
[13:29] mask
[13:31] and you can see that that is an
[13:33] explanation of why in one family why you
[13:36] have Jacob who is from the genes of God
[13:38] and Esau who is not right there in the
[13:41] same family
[13:42] and then you go on down years years and
[13:46] the gospel starts going to the Gentiles
[13:48] and then people from Esau's line begin
[13:51] to receive the Gospel
[13:54] Hebrews 7 5 and then we'll read nine and
[13:57] ten and verily they that are of the sons
[13:59] of Levi
[14:00] who received the office of the
[14:01] priesthood have a commandment to take
[14:03] take tithes of the people according to
[14:05] the law that is of their Brethren though
[14:07] they come out of the loins of Abraham
[14:11] see there's the picture coming from the
[14:13] loins of Abraham
[14:15] and as
[14:17] I may so say Levi also who received
[14:20] tithes paid tithes in Abraham for he was
[14:24] yet in the loins of his father when
[14:26] Melchizedek met him so in in God's sight
[14:29] it's not just a you know there's there's
[14:32] there's there's DNA passed on and it's
[14:35] just generic and it's we don't know
[14:38] who's coming forth no God is literally
[14:40] looking at Abraham and say Levi is
[14:42] coming right
[14:45] David is coming etc etc down the line so
[14:47] it's not it's not as though it's some
[14:49] generic DNA but it's God molding and
[14:52] shaping something through that genetic
[14:54] line
[14:56] Ephesians 1 3 and 4 blessed be the God
[14:59] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[15:01] has blessed us with all spiritual
[15:02] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[15:06] according his he has chosen Us in him
[15:08] before the foundation of the world that
[15:10] we should be holy and Without Blame
[15:12] before him in love I think this is
[15:14] important
[15:15] to look at what does it mean that we
[15:18] were chosen in him before the foundation
[15:21] of the world again are we looking at
[15:24] just an expression of thought
[15:26] is it is it merely a thought that we
[15:29] were there as a thought
[15:31] in him before the foundation of the
[15:33] world or is is it speaking something
[15:35] more than that that he had we were
[15:37] literally in him
[15:40] we our life
[15:42] was in him if was Levi just a thought in
[15:45] Abraham he wasn't even that
[15:48] right but he was genetically in Abraham
[15:51] Abraham didn't choose that Levi was
[15:54] going to be his grandson or anything he
[15:57] was just there
[15:58] right and so we are chosen
[16:01] in God so where were we our genetics
[16:05] our DNA
[16:06] was in God and what is that it's beyond
[16:10] just coding
[16:12] it's There's an actual life there's a
[16:14] substance there's something real that's
[16:17] that's there we were in him
[16:19] before the foundation of the world for
[16:22] all of eternity
[16:23] if if you catch that in the church ages
[16:25] book because God doesn't have new
[16:26] thoughts
[16:28] our thought the thoughts of God are
[16:30] Eternal they're unchanging we were there
[16:32] in him for all eternity as a part of his
[16:36] life no you didn't know it you weren't
[16:37] existing literally
[16:39] in Fellowship but your life was in him
[16:41] just like
[16:43] Levi's life was in Abraham
[16:47] now I want you to look at this from
[16:49] questions and answers on Genesis
[16:51] speaking about
[16:53] God's order
[16:55] he was in other words Adam the first man
[16:57] in the lower creations of God
[17:00] so now I want you to notice what he says
[17:02] the first creation was God himself this
[17:04] isn't saying God was created it's
[17:06] speaking the order of creation so God is
[17:09] first in order right God is first then
[17:13] out of God came the logos which was the
[17:15] son of God which the logos is not
[17:17] created either the logos is birth it's
[17:20] it was a part it was in God for all of
[17:22] eternity than just prior to Creation it
[17:24] comes forth as a birth out of God
[17:27] brother Branham says a part of God went
[17:29] out of God he didn't say the word was
[17:32] created he said a part of God went out
[17:35] of God that's significant because it's
[17:37] his life expressed
[17:39] uh then out of God came to logos which
[17:42] was the son of God then out of the logos
[17:44] which was the word in the beginning was
[17:46] the word and the Word was with God and
[17:47] the Word was God and the Word was made
[17:49] flesh and dwelt Among Us
[17:51] out of the logos came forth the man
[17:55] so you see this understanding is we're
[17:58] we're we're talking about the life
[18:01] so the life is coming forth the life of
[18:05] the word was in God
[18:07] the the life of Adam was in the word
[18:10] right so this life is coming forth
[18:14] it's coming out of him in unveiling of
[18:16] God
[18:17] says that's the way God did he bred this
[18:19] one to that one this one to that one to
[18:22] this one to that one until he got
[18:25] exactly what he wanted that's how he
[18:27] come down
[18:29] do you see that significance there he
[18:32] says he's got he's working in the very
[18:35] uh genetics of the human race to produce
[18:39] what he wants to produce is isn't that
[18:41] an incredible thought
[18:43] in our ancestors I mean he he was
[18:46] planning you
[18:47] and if the Lord Darius he's planning
[18:49] other Generations right
[18:51] in he he was all of this goes back
[18:55] thousands of years to this one married
[18:58] this one nothing happens by chance every
[19:01] God is totally Sovereign in everything
[19:03] that he does he's totally Sovereign in
[19:06] your family's parentage he's totally
[19:08] Sovereign and your grandparents great
[19:09] grandparent and and on and on Down the
[19:12] Line because he wanted to produce
[19:13] something you right
[19:18] we read this last week I'm going to read
[19:20] it again from the Rapture in the little
[19:21] literal discharge
[19:23] of the male there's somewhat a million
[19:25] germs comes forth a male at each time
[19:27] and somewhat a million eggs from the
[19:29] female at the same time but did you know
[19:30] in all of them little gerunds moving
[19:32] around a million of them then there's
[19:34] only one of them ordained to life and
[19:36] there's only one egg fertile and that
[19:39] little germ will call right up through
[19:41] every one of them other little germs
[19:43] right over the top of every germ looking
[19:45] just like him and come over the top of
[19:47] that and come over here and find that
[19:49] fertile egg and crawl into it and then
[19:51] all the rest of them die why talk about
[19:53] the Virgin birth oh it's not half as
[19:55] mysterious as a physical birth how it's
[19:57] foreordained predestinated by God you
[20:00] see what care
[20:02] what involvement God has in every aspect
[20:06] to produce that life there he looks even
[20:10] to the very
[20:11] spur proper sperm and proper egg to
[20:14] bring together and then he sets forward
[20:16] the DNA just the way he wants it
[20:21] so this is just referring to some uh
[20:24] putting together a few different quotes
[20:26] from last week
[20:27] this is from communion in their nature I
[20:29] was a sinner
[20:30] all the habits of the world laid right
[20:32] in me but down in there too was another
[20:34] nature presidency predestinated a little
[20:37] spot of eternal life down there from the
[20:40] genes of God
[20:42] then in another sermon he says now the
[20:44] genes in the father and the mother of
[20:46] this boy no matter how much they are
[20:47] converted Still Remains the flesh that's
[20:50] been interbred out to this boy
[20:54] so and in in that quote if you remember
[20:57] he's speaking about the nature of his
[21:01] Spirit right his attitude his his
[21:04] characteristics so that body Soul and
[21:09] Spirit all there is being passed down
[21:12] through that genetic line
[21:15] then the last quote he's a hybrid he's
[21:18] got to be born again you see that's the
[21:19] reason we have to be born again because
[21:21] that false Serpentine life has been
[21:24] injected into the human race
[21:27] and we have to be born again because our
[21:29] first birth is wrong
[21:34] Souls that are in prison now
[21:37] and the soul is something that's the
[21:39] nature of the spirit and then when the
[21:41] nature of a man when he said we are dead
[21:43] the scripture plainly tells us we are
[21:46] dead and our lives are hidden God
[21:47] through Christ sealed there by the Holy
[21:49] Spirit now it wasn't that your body died
[21:52] it wasn't your spirit died it was the
[21:54] nature of your spirit died see the
[21:57] nature which is the soul the nature of
[21:59] your soul is God if you're born again if
[22:01] it's not it's of the world and to keep
[22:04] reading we're going to put this together
[22:07] communion in their nature I was a sinner
[22:10] I came to the world a liar all the
[22:13] habits of the world laid right in me
[22:15] but down in there too was another nature
[22:17] present see predestinated was in there
[22:20] by God in the same body
[22:24] see two Natures in there
[22:31] continuing from communion pop and Mom
[22:33] they're gone on now to the rest of them
[22:35] days they were Sinners there was no
[22:37] Christianity in our homes at all and all
[22:40] my drinking and parties and carrying out
[22:42] on it made me sick I'd take my Lantern
[22:45] and my dog and go to the woods to stay
[22:47] all night in the wintertime I'd hunt
[22:49] till the party was over maybe daylight
[22:51] in the morning come here wouldn't be
[22:53] over I'd lay on the I've laid on top of
[22:55] a shed and sleep waiting for daylight to
[22:57] break what was it
[22:59] there was another William Branham see a
[23:02] little spot of eternal life down there
[23:04] from the genes of God the word of God
[23:06] that was placed in there each one of you
[23:08] can think of similar things see it was
[23:11] working
[23:14] now then one day as I walked on that
[23:16] voice talking don't never smoke drink so
[23:19] forth and the young fellows and all got
[23:21] older see there was something moving but
[23:23] yet all at once I looked up and I said
[23:25] I'm not the son of Charles and Ella
[23:27] Branham there's something calling like
[23:29] my little Eagle I'm not a chicken
[23:30] there's something up yonder somewhere oh
[23:32] great Jehovah whoever you are open up I
[23:34] want to come home amen there's something
[23:37] in me calling
[23:38] then I was born again that little life
[23:41] was laying there the life of water was
[23:44] poured upon it then it began to grow now
[23:46] that old life was forgiven put in the
[23:48] sea of God's forgetfulness to Never Be
[23:50] Remembered against me no more a seed now
[23:53] we stand Justified as though we had
[23:55] never sinned in the presence of God
[23:59] all right but inside of you this from
[24:01] leadership you've got a soul and that
[24:03] soul is the gene that come from God
[24:08] modern events made clear by prophecy but
[24:10] the real ordained of God that real Gene
[24:12] that real germ a soul of God that was in
[24:15] God before the foundation of the world
[24:17] now you see that connection that Soul
[24:20] was in God before the foundation of the
[24:22] world how did it get to you did it come
[24:24] directly from God to you we saw and read
[24:27] before no it comes through it passes
[24:30] through
[24:31] the human race the genetics of the human
[24:33] race you are born with that Gene from
[24:36] God inside of your soul
[24:41] and that what what does brother Branham
[24:42] say I think I have
[24:45] yeah
[24:46] so let me let me pause myself there for
[24:49] a second and read this scripture Romans
[24:51] 6 14 for sin shall not have dominion
[24:54] over you for you are not under the law
[24:56] but under grace you say what in the
[24:58] world does that have to do with anything
[24:59] I want you to understand we have two
[25:01] Natures I think I have this yeah
[25:04] so the soul is the nature of the spirit
[25:06] right
[25:08] we have two Natures in our soul
[25:11] there's a gene of God in our soul
[25:14] there's also Serpentine genetic in our
[25:16] soul as well those two Natures before
[25:19] the New Birth the serpentine nature in
[25:22] our soul dominates
[25:24] the gene of God right
[25:27] yet as we read from Brother Branham the
[25:29] gene of God is there somehow
[25:32] producing like a covered over
[25:35] desire for righteousness and for God
[25:39] see it's it's there brother Ben I'm
[25:41] telling that sore it was in there that
[25:42] Gene was in there working
[25:45] right
[25:46] but what is it it's under the Dominion
[25:48] of sin that's the condition we are
[25:52] before we're born again we are under the
[25:54] Dominion of sin so in that Soul there's
[25:57] two Natures one is dominating the other
[25:59] right
[26:01] well what does the new birth bring it
[26:03] flips that now the gene of God should be
[26:06] dominating the other one
[26:08] the word causes that the gene of God's
[26:11] influence to grow you understand the
[26:14] Bible says you're dead and your life is
[26:15] hid from God brother Madam said what is
[26:17] it that nature dies it dies but do you
[26:21] remember that you're battling against
[26:22] sin every single day you're fighting
[26:25] against sin every single day we have to
[26:27] Die daily in other words we're in a
[26:29] process right and that Gene of God is
[26:32] there
[26:33] and the domination when the new birth
[26:36] comes the Holy Ghost comes to us that
[26:37] domination flips over now the gene of
[26:40] God becomes dominant
[26:42] but not totally dominant when you're
[26:44] when you're a babe in Christ you have
[26:46] struggles you have difficulties you have
[26:48] things that you look back on and say
[26:49] what did I ever struggle with that for
[26:51] before why because you're you're a babe
[26:53] in Christ you're that Gene has to start
[26:56] growing brother Baron talks about
[26:57] watering it the life has to water it
[27:00] there's what is it we're Washed by the
[27:02] washing of the water of the word
[27:04] and that Holy Spirit Waters that also
[27:07] Waters that word so that Gene of God
[27:09] that seed of God so there's that
[27:11] watering process that grows that we have
[27:13] to grow and grow and grow and when you
[27:15] look when you're a newborn babe in
[27:17] Christ and you're struggling with many
[27:18] things you wonder why can't I get over
[27:20] this and then as as you keep feeding on
[27:23] the word and keep fellowshipping with
[27:25] with God in your in that jeans in your
[27:28] soul what happens the domination of the
[27:31] life of God per this begins to permeate
[27:34] your whole body until you're very until
[27:37] this very body is changed
[27:41] in this this very body becomes subject
[27:44] to the Rapture amen
[27:48] all right so that's overcoming the gene
[27:51] of God is overcoming the serpentine
[27:53] nature within us
[27:58] so so we went over this last week but I
[28:00] I think I went fast so I'm going to slow
[28:01] down a little bit
[28:03] I got through the major portion I wanted
[28:05] to get through
[28:07] um with a little bit of time left so
[28:09] all right looking back Kane derived his
[28:12] genetics from who
[28:14] the serpent
[28:16] only the serpent no The Serpent and Eve
[28:20] remember Adam could not be deceived he
[28:23] was in the original creation
[28:25] Eve was taken out of Adam was in the
[28:29] secondary creation brother random says
[28:30] it's a byproduct
[28:33] people hear that and they they take it
[28:35] as a negative thing like a hot dog is a
[28:37] byproduct of a pig
[28:38] that's not what brother Branham is
[28:40] saying that's the word that he chose to
[28:42] use he's saying he comes out of Adam she
[28:46] wasn't a leftover she wasn't in the
[28:48] second thoughts were you in the
[28:50] secondary thoughts of God no
[28:52] God's original purpose was Adam and Eve
[28:55] but he made her in the second second
[28:57] secondary creation as a byproduct so
[29:01] that she could be deceived
[29:03] because God had a purpose
[29:05] God had a purpose to to express himself
[29:07] to us
[29:09] so the jeans in the father and the
[29:10] mother of this boy Remains the flesh
[29:12] that's in her bread out to this boy
[29:16] so Abel and Seth genes of Adam and Eve
[29:20] if Eve can be deceived
[29:22] guess what
[29:24] her
[29:26] children can be deceived as well
[29:30] Genesis 6 2 we we talked about it before
[29:33] sons of God saw the daughters of men
[29:34] it's the SAS line and Cain's line coming
[29:38] in and hybriding together
[29:42] brother Branham says the sons of God saw
[29:44] the daughters of men and caused the sons
[29:47] of God to fall into delusion delusion
[29:50] speaks of being deceived
[29:53] in a blushing Prophet 1956 grieved the
[29:56] heart of God when he looked upon them in
[29:58] the days before the antelope
[29:59] antediluvian destruction that he ever
[30:02] made a man what happened the sons of God
[30:04] saw the daughters of men was fair it was
[30:06] perversion it was a sex mix-up it was
[30:09] that thing that drove the children of
[30:11] God from the Garden of Eden
[30:13] see there's that hybrid
[30:18] in the Fallen the flashing red light of
[30:20] the sign of his coming notice the women
[30:22] of that day in the days of Noah must
[30:25] have been the talk of the day see you
[30:26] sons of God Seth Seth's Sons saw the
[30:29] daughters of Cain that they were
[30:30] beautiful why they were Wicked and they
[30:32] were Daughters of Cain when the sons of
[30:34] God saw the daughters of men they were
[30:35] Fair they took unto them women
[30:39] and you remember if we talked about last
[30:42] week many people are teaching that
[30:45] Fallen Angels came down and pressed
[30:47] their bodies or their their spiritual
[30:49] bodies into into flesh and produced and
[30:54] and and took women
[30:56] and produced the Nephilim the Giants so
[30:59] they think that they they use this
[31:03] scripture
[31:04] which is it always makes me laugh they
[31:06] they condemn serpency Doctrine which has
[31:09] multitude of scriptures from Genesis to
[31:12] Revelation to demonstrate it
[31:15] uh they say how could that possibly be
[31:17] that's disgusting and then they fast
[31:19] forward five chapters and say that's how
[31:22] it is it's exactly like that and a
[31:24] spiritual being came down and had sex
[31:26] with women and produced Giants
[31:28] oh that's disgusting
[31:31] so we don't we don't uh base our
[31:34] Doctrine on whether it's disgusting or
[31:36] not we base it on the word
[31:39] and Jesus said Angels can't reproduce
[31:43] right
[31:45] otherwise they would be make you'd make
[31:47] Satan be a Creator and it wasn't Satan
[31:50] directly that joined with Eve it was the
[31:54] serpent he was a created Animal just
[31:58] like the man but without a soul
[32:01] right so
[32:03] we'll continue on
[32:04] Genesis 6 produced a mixed hybrid race
[32:08] God wanted to bring his family forth
[32:10] through Adam and Eve but through serpent
[32:13] seeds injection into Humanity first
[32:15] through Cain then through the daughters
[32:16] of men every one of us are hybrid I
[32:19] think that's clear from scripture
[32:22] you know you can fast forward and say
[32:23] well Noah was perfect in his Generations
[32:25] but that's absolutely true
[32:28] I believe Noah was the very last pure
[32:31] born son of Adam
[32:34] but what did his family line produce
[32:38] me
[32:40] a sinner
[32:41] you a sinner it's hybrid it's clear it's
[32:44] hype hamsham and japheth produced all
[32:46] hybrids the whole world is full of full
[32:48] of that
[32:54] and we saw in this read this last week
[32:56] but we'll repeat it John 8 37 I know
[33:00] that your Abraham's seed Sperma
[33:03] but you seek to kill me because my word
[33:05] has no place in you
[33:07] so he says I know that you're physically
[33:10] from Abraham
[33:13] in verse 39 and this this helps us to
[33:16] understand serpent seed you know
[33:19] maybe not so much more but you used to
[33:21] hear people saying oh that one I know
[33:24] that he's serpent seed well do you know
[33:27] that you are you have that life in you
[33:29] too
[33:30] that's the mix-up is when we start
[33:31] thinking of there's these pure genetic
[33:34] lines and that's where many of the
[33:35] racist doctrines you see black
[33:38] nationalists say white people are
[33:41] serpent seed and you see white
[33:43] nationalists saying black people are
[33:46] serpent seed they're all ignoramuses is
[33:48] what they are
[33:49] they have no idea that the scripture
[33:51] because it very clearly shows we're all
[33:54] a mixed race
[33:59] so verse 39 they answered and said unto
[34:02] him Abraham is our father Jesus saith
[34:04] unto him if you were Abraham's tecton
[34:06] children
[34:08] tecton means sons that there's a
[34:10] relationship a bond a similar
[34:12] characteristic a similar nature if you
[34:14] had the same nature as Abraham you'd do
[34:16] the work of Abraham
[34:18] you worry of your father the devil and
[34:20] the lust of your father you will do
[34:22] so here we see this there's a genetic
[34:25] line right that he's looking at and by
[34:28] election in the very same
[34:30] Nation there's Abraham's seed who are of
[34:33] the devil and there's Abraham's seed
[34:36] who are sons of Abraham and they have a
[34:39] place inside of them that can receive
[34:42] the word
[34:43] those who are Abraham's seed who are of
[34:46] the devil there's no place in them to
[34:47] receive the word they can't receive it
[34:49] it's impossible
[34:52] all right let's uh
[34:55] let's stand
