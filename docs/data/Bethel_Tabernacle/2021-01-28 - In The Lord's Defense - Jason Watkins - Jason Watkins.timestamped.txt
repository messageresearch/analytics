[43:29] amen we're going to invite you to
[43:30] jeremiah chapter 3 this evening
[43:32] appreciate all the
[43:33] music and singing amen i enjoyed that
[43:36] song
[43:37] brother travis sister josie that was
[43:39] awesome sister that was quite a dream i
[43:41] heard about
[43:42] wow praise the lord
[43:45] so we want to look tonight and i'm
[43:50] i'm not titling any
[43:53] in my title i'm not attaching to
[43:55] sunday's
[43:56] thought but i do want to kind of launch
[44:00] from a certain
[44:01] spot that we just mentioned in
[44:04] on sunday but tonight i want to take a
[44:07] text from
[44:08] jeremiah chapter 3 and i want to speak
[44:11] tonight on a burden the lord put on my
[44:12] heart
[44:13] called in the lord's defense now i want
[44:16] to make
[44:17] just a disclaimer and it's it's just
[44:19] kind of silly that i have to
[44:22] but i feel like i need to because
[44:26] just taking that title you might well
[44:28] imagine and
[44:29] you it would be normal to imagine that
[44:33] i'm probably gonna
[44:34] you know defend the message against all
[44:36] these defectors and nonsense
[44:38] that's not even in my mind and i'm not
[44:40] even going anywhere near that
[44:43] and uh because i don't need to the this
[44:46] message doesn't need defending
[44:47] amen god has proven it so overwhelmingly
[44:51] and we made some comments sunday and i
[44:54] stand by them
[44:55] and uh but tonight i i have a completely
[44:58] different burden on my heart i'm
[44:59] thinking of a more
[45:01] global approach to the world that has
[45:03] spurned the lord
[45:05] and has you know brother branham in a
[45:06] number of places
[45:08] preached a message called the trial in
[45:10] fact is it was in birmingham
[45:12] one of the places he preached that where
[45:14] my mom and dad were and that's where my
[45:17] dad went to the prayer line
[45:19] and i was healed hundreds of miles away
[45:21] instantly
[45:22] of an incurable illness and so
[45:26] you know brother branham felt the need
[45:28] several times
[45:30] to take up the cause of defending the
[45:33] lord to
[45:34] to against a world that was
[45:38] you know not they weren't being fair
[45:41] to god and worse than that they were
[45:44] outright
[45:45] false accusing god and it wasn't the
[45:48] first time in history
[45:49] in the scriptures even israel got caught
[45:53] up
[45:53] in that and you know they they were
[45:56] under
[45:56] harsh trials and really all it was was
[45:59] the
[46:00] tender hand of jehovah correcting their
[46:03] lives
[46:04] amen the lord does that you know and we
[46:07] we should be happy because it means he
[46:09] loves us
[46:11] and uh and they you know they they just
[46:15] they couldn't reconcile all of the
[46:17] misfortune
[46:18] that was happening to them and they they
[46:21] they accused god
[46:22] to the prophet that he wasn't being fair
[46:25] and you know the prophet takes that
[46:27] message to the lord and the lord sends
[46:29] back a message
[46:30] said you go back and tell them you you
[46:32] say i'm not
[46:33] fair i'm not equitable that i'm not just
[46:37] i'm actually saying that you're the ones
[46:39] who aren't just and fair and equitable
[46:42] i you know i've been over and
[46:44] overwhelmingly gracious and merciful to
[46:46] you
[46:47] and you're the ones who constantly do me
[46:49] wrong
[46:50] amen and so you know it's it's mankind
[46:53] has
[46:54] is always doing that and so the lord
[46:57] put a burden on my heart tonight and i
[46:59] want to take it up and it's gonna
[47:01] be a little bit of a strange angle to
[47:03] approach it from so you just bear with
[47:05] me will you do it
[47:06] amen in jeremiah chapter 3
[47:10] we're going to pick up from verse 6 and
[47:12] i'm going to read 6-13
[47:18] the lord said also unto me in the days
[47:20] of
[47:21] josiah the king
[47:24] has thou seen that which backsliding
[47:28] israel hath done
[47:34] she has gone up upon every high mountain
[47:38] and under every green tree and there
[47:41] hath played the harlot
[47:43] and i said after she had done all these
[47:47] things
[47:48] turn thou unto me but she returned
[47:52] not and her treacherous sister
[47:55] judah saw it and i saw
[47:59] when for all the causes whereby
[48:01] backsliding israel
[48:03] committed adultery i had put her away
[48:06] and given her bill of divorce yet her
[48:09] treacherous sister
[48:11] judah feared not but went and played the
[48:14] harlot
[48:15] also isn't that astonishing
[48:18] and it came to pass through the
[48:21] lightness
[48:22] of her whoredom that she defiled the
[48:25] land
[48:26] and committed adultery with with stones
[48:30] and with stocks
[48:32] and yet for all her treacherous sister
[48:35] judah
[48:36] hath not returned unto me
[48:39] with her whole heart but but
[48:43] feigningly saith the lord
[48:46] so you know she she feigned a repentance
[48:49] it wasn't really genuine
[48:50] it wasn't wholehearted it was kind of a
[48:53] half
[48:53] measure and the lord
[48:56] said unto me the backsliding
[48:59] israel hath justified herself
[49:03] more than treacherous judah go
[49:06] and proclaim these words toward the
[49:08] north
[49:09] this is to israel and say return
[49:13] thou backsliding israel saith the lord
[49:16] and i will not cause mine anger to fall
[49:19] upon you for i
[49:20] am merciful saith the lord and i will
[49:23] not keep
[49:24] anger forever only acknowledge thine
[49:28] iniquity
[49:29] that thou has transgressed against the
[49:31] lord thy god
[49:33] and has scattered thy ways to the
[49:35] strangers under
[49:36] every green tree and ye have not obeyed
[49:39] my voice saith the lord
[49:43] he goes on and on eternal backsliding
[49:45] children goes on and on and on
[49:47] and um let's pray
[49:52] father i stand here tonight lord with
[49:55] the word open before me
[49:57] and a and a very simple burden on my
[49:59] heart and how to express it
[50:01] that's always lord what we must depend
[50:04] on you for now master i
[50:07] i ask you for your help lord because i
[50:11] this has meant a lot to me and i i know
[50:14] that it will mean a great deal
[50:16] to the rest of your family if i can just
[50:20] get myself out of the way lord and just
[50:22] let you be the preacher tonight
[50:25] may you grant that to me father we
[50:27] humble ourselves
[50:28] before your presence and ask this of
[50:31] thee humbly
[50:32] in jesus name amen god bless you as
[50:35] you're seated
[50:48] when i read jeremiah 3
[50:51] this passage here verses 6 through 13.
[50:55] it it it leaves me amazed
[50:58] that anyone could read
[51:02] about a being this merciful
[51:07] and then accuse him of somehow
[51:10] not being you know uh fair
[51:14] or equitable or reasonable uh
[51:17] you know that that you could read this
[51:18] that here
[51:20] here is the the offended one
[51:24] you know humanity is always getting
[51:27] offended at god
[51:29] and uh you know this is if you just
[51:31] would think for a second how
[51:33] upside down that is that
[51:36] god builds life
[51:40] builds a world builds a universe
[51:44] builds it all perfect puts perfect
[51:47] atmospheres
[51:49] nature perfect people
[51:52] perfect everything and man comes in
[51:56] and ruins it all and then turns around
[51:59] and says
[51:59] you know god you know we hate him you
[52:02] know we
[52:03] he he's not good we don't want to serve
[52:05] him we don't like god
[52:06] and and the whole world in mass
[52:09] overwhelmingly an overwhelming
[52:13] majority down through history
[52:16] has always chosen everything
[52:20] but god and
[52:23] you know and and then people somehow
[52:26] have this idea in their mind that
[52:29] i ought to be able to live my life
[52:33] how i want to and yet
[52:37] you didn't give yourself life you can't
[52:40] keep your life
[52:41] you can't keep the breath in your lungs
[52:43] if god doesn't do it
[52:45] you're you've got maybe however long you
[52:48] can hold your breath to live
[52:51] all right so if god just come down in
[52:54] this building and said right now okay
[52:56] i'm done i'm taking everybody's breath
[52:58] however long you can hold your breath
[53:00] that's how long you have to live in the
[53:02] earth
[53:03] and so you know you you have to realize
[53:06] that
[53:07] everything that is made was made by him
[53:10] and for him and you know it's
[53:14] it's all for his purposes and his
[53:17] accomplishments and somehow
[53:19] man rises up as if god owes him
[53:22] something and really the long and short
[53:24] of it is
[53:25] is that god set man in the world with
[53:29] eternal life
[53:30] man gave it away and then
[53:33] god comes down and says okay i'll tell
[53:35] you what
[53:36] i'll clean up your mess and save you and
[53:39] mankind still hate him amen
[53:42] amen and they constantly i'm a little
[53:45] hot in the monitors brother man
[53:47] they constantly uh
[53:51] you know resist his guidance and
[53:55] even though his way uh leads to life
[53:59] even though he's the only source of life
[54:02] he's the only one who can save you
[54:06] and if he doesn't save you you're
[54:07] finished
[54:09] you're doomed so you know it
[54:12] it it becomes a situation where you say
[54:16] wow how how is it that mankind
[54:19] can possibly take this path and you hear
[54:22] it all the time you hear people
[54:24] mock god on a regular basis and all fear
[54:27] of god is gone from the earth today yeah
[54:29] amen now it was supposed to be that way
[54:31] because that's how it was in the days of
[54:32] noah
[54:33] that his all across the earth his mind
[54:36] the mind of man
[54:38] was evil continually
[54:41] and that every imagination that he had
[54:44] was evil to to the degree that it
[54:47] repented god
[54:48] that he had even made man and so you
[54:51] know god
[54:52] came down in this amazing act
[54:55] of mercy for the righteous and said
[54:58] i tell you what i'm just gonna i'm gonna
[55:02] get rid of all the evil
[55:04] and you know something friends you say
[55:07] wow
[55:07] that was that was pretty tragic but at
[55:10] the same time
[55:11] i can imagine noah with his righteous
[55:14] spirit
[55:15] and his righteous ideas and his love for
[55:18] god's righteousness and his family
[55:20] you know as sad as it was to see
[55:22] everybody perish
[55:24] they had a chance and you know there had
[55:27] to be some satisfaction
[55:29] for noah to as tragic as it was to step
[55:33] out in a world
[55:34] and go whoo we get to start over
[55:37] man no more wickedness no more evil and
[55:40] then of course we know
[55:41] that it it didn't take no time it didn't
[55:43] take no time
[55:45] but by the time noah's son
[55:49] shem has passed away he's the last one
[55:53] mankind is already corrupting himself
[55:55] again in the
[55:56] in shinar and building a tower and you
[55:59] know at the tower
[56:01] brother branham shows how that they
[56:03] built the tower
[56:05] so as so that that if god ever decided
[56:09] to come after him again with the flood
[56:11] we'll just run up in the tower so
[56:14] don't worry y'all we've got a insurance
[56:17] policy
[56:18] that go ahead and live how you want to
[56:20] live no you don't have to
[56:21] follow god we don't have to be like noah
[56:26] well yeah but the lord destroyed the
[56:27] word it's okay we got a tower
[56:31] so you can have your cake and you can
[56:33] eat it too
[56:35] you can have fun and you can do what you
[56:37] want to do
[56:38] and we're not obligated to serve god
[56:42] now that worked out really good up until
[56:45] the point they died
[56:47] and suddenly that's not a very good plan
[56:50] anymore
[56:51] amen and so so
[56:55] so here comes god to his own family now
[56:57] if you look at our reading
[56:59] he's saying to israel he's saying to
[57:01] judah you know
[57:03] this is what you've done i didn't make
[57:05] you do it you went out
[57:06] and you played the harlot and you you
[57:08] did it this way
[57:09] but if he'll just repent and come back
[57:12] to me i'll forgive you
[57:13] and then they wouldn't even do that amen
[57:16] and then he appeals to him again he
[57:17] comes back he says
[57:18] listen i won't be mad forever just come
[57:20] back to me
[57:21] and i'll and and we if we could have
[57:23] kept going i could have kept reading and
[57:25] how that he would send them pastors and
[57:27] they'll care for you and i'm gonna
[57:29] take care of you and i'm i'm gonna love
[57:31] you and you're gonna be my possession
[57:33] and
[57:33] and and yet for all of his entreaty
[57:36] you know they they they still somehow
[57:40] man has it in his mind that you know i'm
[57:42] just gonna do it my way
[57:46] even though that's the craziest idea
[57:50] you could possibly have because
[57:53] at the end of it all you will have
[57:55] traded
[57:57] what what what the bible what job
[57:59] describes
[58:00] that a man born of a woman here in your
[58:03] best okay
[58:04] here's going to be the best possible
[58:06] outcome for you as a human
[58:08] you're going to be full of few days and
[58:11] full of trouble
[58:12] amen okay where's the good news yeah
[58:15] that's it
[58:17] no i mean the part where i enjoy myself
[58:19] well you know i want to long enjoy
[58:22] no you'll be a few days well but i'll
[58:25] surely have good times well
[58:27] for all the trouble you have the good
[58:29] days will hardly be noticeable amen
[58:34] and then here comes god along and say uh
[58:38] hey i got a i got a better way
[58:41] um i got a i got a plan that if you will
[58:45] if you will follow my statutes and keep
[58:47] my laws and
[58:48] and observe my ways then i that long
[58:52] life you wanted
[58:53] i'll give you eternal life and those
[58:55] joys you wanted you
[58:57] you won't you can't even comprehend what
[58:59] i'll have in store for you
[59:02] now you would think that a deal like
[59:04] that that the world would be
[59:07] 99.9 righteous
[59:10] and only you know .0001
[59:14] wicked and yet the reverse is true
[59:18] amen
[59:22] you know i i here's where i wanted to
[59:25] just
[59:26] launch off from from last weekend when
[59:29] we
[59:29] go into revelation 19 and i'm not going
[59:32] to go there tonight so we're not going
[59:33] to go there josh just stay right where
[59:35] you are because we're going to go to
[59:35] psalms here in a minute
[59:37] but we find that when the when the
[59:41] lord come riding out of heaven on a
[59:42] white horse
[59:44] and the armies of heaven followed him
[59:47] that his name was called the word of god
[59:48] and you remember that i pointed out to
[59:50] you
[59:51] that it's interesting because that's
[59:53] exactly
[59:55] what a prophet in this last days tried
[59:58] to tell the world
[59:59] he tried to tell the whole world he went
[1:00:01] around the world seven times
[1:00:03] and he went among those denominations
[1:00:05] and among all those great movements
[1:00:07] and he said listen he's not an organized
[1:00:10] religion
[1:00:11] he's not in a creed he's not in a
[1:00:13] man-made theory
[1:00:15] you can't get him by education he's it
[1:00:17] doesn't come that way
[1:00:19] okay william branham then then tell us
[1:00:22] who
[1:00:22] christ really is and brother brennan
[1:00:24] would say he's his word
[1:00:26] and he would go back to john 1 1. in the
[1:00:29] beginning was the word
[1:00:30] and brother branham would use that over
[1:00:32] and over and over
[1:00:33] again he's the word he's the word
[1:00:35] there's no way to get to him
[1:00:37] outside of going by the way of his word
[1:00:40] and they kept refusing it and kept
[1:00:42] refusing it and kept refusing it
[1:00:44] until by the time you get to chapter 19
[1:00:46] of revelation
[1:00:48] the world has been enduring 42 months
[1:00:52] of tribulation like has never been
[1:00:55] recorded in history it's not a happy
[1:00:58] ending
[1:00:59] amen it's not happily ever after
[1:01:02] technology's not going to save him it's
[1:01:03] going to destroy him
[1:01:05] amen amen so finally
[1:01:09] as if it as if it couldn't possibly get
[1:01:12] any worse
[1:01:13] then the proof comes before their
[1:01:17] eyes of what a prophet tried to tell
[1:01:20] them
[1:01:21] and now here it is the proof there's no
[1:01:23] more doubt i doubt that they doubt it at
[1:01:25] that point
[1:01:26] but now there's absolutely no doubt
[1:01:29] because the armies of heaven
[1:01:31] who believed the prophet's word
[1:01:34] are following him on white horses and
[1:01:38] they haven't even been there for the 42
[1:01:40] months of tribulation at all
[1:01:41] they've been in a wedding supper they've
[1:01:44] been in a glorious time
[1:01:46] and and after three and a half years and
[1:01:48] the world has went through
[1:01:50] on and i just want to say friends and i
[1:01:52] wish i had a stronger english word
[1:01:54] unimaginable horror yes amen
[1:01:58] unfathomable amen horror
[1:02:01] incalculable horror
[1:02:04] unprecedented i mean without
[1:02:08] remedy that's going to be the real sad
[1:02:10] part is that the
[1:02:12] tribulation will bring things upon the
[1:02:14] world
[1:02:15] that by the time that 50 of them are are
[1:02:18] are have have you know 50
[1:02:21] things have hit they still haven't
[1:02:23] figured out how to solve the first one
[1:02:25] yeah amen amen that's what the
[1:02:28] tribulation is going to be
[1:02:29] and by the time it's several years deep
[1:02:32] and
[1:02:33] and so many things have happened and
[1:02:35] they still
[1:02:36] because the things that are coming upon
[1:02:37] the world have a unique twist to them
[1:02:40] they can't be fixed there's no solution
[1:02:45] there's no antidote there's no remedy
[1:02:47] there's no vaccine
[1:02:49] not even a bad one none
[1:02:53] and they're they're they're literally
[1:02:56] and that's that's pretty bad
[1:02:57] when you are when you're helpless it's
[1:03:00] that's bad enough but when you're
[1:03:01] helpless and hopeless
[1:03:03] that's about as bad as it gets and yet
[1:03:07] god constantly in this day and hour
[1:03:10] is still trying to warn the world i mean
[1:03:14] when you try to put it in this context
[1:03:16] the way i'm i'm
[1:03:17] the way i'm approaching it tonight it it
[1:03:20] it
[1:03:20] then who's crazy amen
[1:03:24] are we crazy
[1:03:27] oh you're nuts you think i'm crazy
[1:03:31] what are you crazy you think i'm crazy
[1:03:35] because you know it's it's amazing that
[1:03:38] jesus
[1:03:39] made these words and i'm going to tell
[1:03:41] you something friends there has never
[1:03:43] been
[1:03:45] in the history of mankind a more
[1:03:48] reliable
[1:03:49] statement now this is a day of
[1:03:52] you know unreliability i mean nobody
[1:03:55] keeps their word anymore
[1:03:57] in fact is lying as an art an art form
[1:04:00] yeah
[1:04:00] in in politics and in religion and and
[1:04:04] and and and social media and and
[1:04:07] fake news and even the real news and
[1:04:09] even it's all with a twist
[1:04:11] i mean they're they're so so there's
[1:04:13] there is no
[1:04:14] sure ground today
[1:04:18] that's the reality that the world is in
[1:04:20] and and
[1:04:21] and one day looking out over a crowd
[1:04:24] jesus of nazareth gives the most
[1:04:27] reliable statement
[1:04:29] in human record when he says
[1:04:32] i am the way
[1:04:36] the truth and the life
[1:04:41] there has never been it's equal
[1:04:45] you're talking about a reliable
[1:04:48] statement
[1:04:50] all of heaven and earth would pass away
[1:04:53] but that one brother i'm going to tell
[1:04:55] you something when he said i
[1:04:57] am the way in other words he was saying
[1:05:00] my way is the truth and it leads to life
[1:05:05] and there's no other path to get to life
[1:05:09] outside of the truth that is my way
[1:05:13] amen
[1:05:17] reliably he's the way reliably
[1:05:21] he's the truth assuredly
[1:05:24] his way leads to life and there is no
[1:05:28] plan b there's no alternate path
[1:05:31] there you there a man tried that jesus
[1:05:35] covered that in a parable
[1:05:36] that a man actually got into the wedding
[1:05:39] supper
[1:05:40] only he crawled in a window yeah
[1:05:43] and jesus confronted him even called him
[1:05:46] friend friend
[1:05:47] how did you get in here without
[1:05:50] without being dressed in the garment of
[1:05:53] the word
[1:05:54] and the bible says the man was
[1:05:56] speechless
[1:05:58] he was astonished he was so busted he he
[1:06:01] he didn't even have a good answer i'm
[1:06:03] gonna tell you some friends
[1:06:04] that that is in the tribulation period
[1:06:08] that kind of astonishment that kind of
[1:06:11] uh you know where they're just
[1:06:13] speechless
[1:06:15] with no you know right now they've got
[1:06:17] every kind of
[1:06:18] oh they make every kind of claim they
[1:06:20] make every kind of
[1:06:21] uh of joke about god and every kind of
[1:06:25] sacrilegious thing
[1:06:26] that they can say and they deny his
[1:06:28] existence and they take his name in vain
[1:06:31] and they make fun of his family and they
[1:06:33] and they laugh and jeer from the highest
[1:06:35] to the
[1:06:36] lowest at all levels in all corners of
[1:06:38] the world
[1:06:39] amen but in a tribulation period nobody
[1:06:43] be laughing amen
[1:06:48] all comedians will go out of business
[1:06:51] in the tribulation period there won't be
[1:06:55] anything they can say to make people
[1:06:57] laugh
[1:06:59] that's how horrid that's how
[1:07:02] bad the tribulation will be
[1:07:08] and to think that a prophet and this is
[1:07:11] why god said to them now
[1:07:12] in that 13th verse only acknowledge
[1:07:15] thine iniquity
[1:07:17] that thou has transgressed against the
[1:07:20] lord thy god
[1:07:20] and and has scattered thy ways to the
[1:07:23] strangers under every green tree
[1:07:24] and you have not obeyed my voice saith
[1:07:26] lord admit it
[1:07:29] why can't you just admit it and we're
[1:07:31] living in an age where nobody
[1:07:33] takes responsibility for anything
[1:07:36] nobody takes blame it doesn't even
[1:07:39] matter if they know
[1:07:40] every kind of company that gets in
[1:07:42] trouble these days the government the
[1:07:43] only way to get them to admit
[1:07:45] to to pay to to not have to go to court
[1:07:48] and drag it out with lawyers who can
[1:07:50] who can drag the government out for
[1:07:51] years the government says okay
[1:07:53] if you'll pay you know 20 million
[1:07:55] dollars and they say okay we'll pay that
[1:07:58] since that's only about a month of our
[1:08:00] profits anyway and but we will not admit
[1:08:02] guilt and so let me get this straight
[1:08:05] you're going to give the government 20
[1:08:07] million dollars
[1:08:09] and but you don't want to say you're
[1:08:11] guilty
[1:08:13] i never figured that one out
[1:08:16] why you think i'm guilty how about 20
[1:08:18] million reasons
[1:08:21] i mean who would pay 20 million dollars
[1:08:23] or 50 million or a hundred million
[1:08:26] and and you're not guilty and of course
[1:08:28] they're guilty and everybody knows
[1:08:29] they're guilty and even they know
[1:08:30] they're guilty and they know you know
[1:08:31] they're guilty
[1:08:34] they don't even didn't they but but they
[1:08:36] want it they don't want to have to admit
[1:08:38] to that
[1:08:39] and you know corporations poison the
[1:08:42] earth and people get sick and nobody
[1:08:44] admits it
[1:08:45] and politicians lie and and they get
[1:08:47] caught and then nobody will admit it
[1:08:49] and pharmaceuticals and you know the
[1:08:52] military and
[1:08:53] the fbi and i mean churches people
[1:08:56] your neighbors sometimes even god's
[1:09:00] family
[1:09:00] can get caught in things and and we just
[1:09:03] have the hardest time in the world
[1:09:05] you know it's it can be difficult for a
[1:09:08] human being
[1:09:10] when they are when they are in the face
[1:09:14] of their con the con they're having to
[1:09:17] deal with the consequences of bad
[1:09:19] decisions
[1:09:19] one of the hardest things in the world
[1:09:21] for them to do is say you know it's all
[1:09:22] my fault

[1:11:05] he's trying to help you it's not here
[1:11:08] god is not an evil ogre you know he's
[1:11:11] not some
[1:11:12] you know some terrible uh fiend who
[1:11:15] who wants to put the whole world under
[1:11:17] his thumb he's not even like that the
[1:11:19] bible said
[1:11:20] his very throne is established in mercy
[1:11:24] god god got excited in the word
[1:11:28] to be able to declare that mercy
[1:11:31] rejoices against judgment
[1:11:34] that in sacrifices and offerings thou
[1:11:36] has had no pleasure
[1:11:38] but a body has thou prepared me this was
[1:11:41] always god's way this is god's desire
[1:11:44] is to have mercy upon sinful men
[1:11:48] when he doesn't even have to he him
[1:11:51] the offended party
[1:11:55] him the offended party trying to make up
[1:11:58] with you
[1:12:00] that staggers the mind because nobody
[1:12:02] does that anymore
[1:12:05] he said if you only acknowledge your
[1:12:07] iniquity
[1:12:10] he says here in psalms 143 give me that
[1:12:13] josh brother josh
[1:12:14] psalms 143 verse 1.
[1:12:19] hear my prayer o lord give ear to my
[1:12:24] supplications in thy faithfulness
[1:12:27] answer me and in thy righteousness
[1:12:31] listen to this plea and this is david
[1:12:34] crying out and
[1:12:35] enter not into judgment with thy servant
[1:12:37] for
[1:12:38] in thy sight shall no man living be
[1:12:41] justified
[1:12:43] for the enemy hath persecuted my soul
[1:12:47] now i want you to pay close attention to
[1:12:48] that statement
[1:12:50] for the enemy hath persecuted my
[1:12:53] soul he hath smitten my life
[1:12:56] down to the ground that's a pretty bad
[1:12:59] enemy
[1:13:00] amen amen this enemy ain't no joke look
[1:13:03] at what he can do
[1:13:04] he hath smitten my life down to the
[1:13:08] ground
[1:13:09] he beat me to the ground
[1:13:13] he hath made me to dwell in darkness
[1:13:16] nobody does that voluntarily this enemy
[1:13:19] beat him to the ground and forced him
[1:13:23] into a dark into a complete darkness as
[1:13:26] those
[1:13:27] that have been long dead
[1:13:31] therefore is my spirit overwhelmed
[1:13:34] within me
[1:13:36] my heart within me is desolate
[1:13:40] i mean here's a man who has his enemy
[1:13:43] got a hold of him
[1:13:46] and persecuted his soul
[1:13:50] and the persecution was so bad he
[1:13:53] likened it
[1:13:53] to being beaten to the ground and
[1:13:56] dragged into a dark dungeon
[1:13:58] and left for dead
[1:14:02] say brother jason why are you making
[1:14:04] such a deal over
[1:14:05] the enemy that hath persecuted my soul
[1:14:09] because your soul has no
[1:14:12] closer enemy than your flesh
[1:14:20] your soul doesn't have a closer enemy
[1:14:24] amen your flesh is the closest enemy to
[1:14:27] your soul possible
[1:14:29] if a man was standing six inches from
[1:14:31] you you'd still be closer to your soul
[1:14:33] than him

[1:14:57] soul so much so that you can get into a
[1:15:00] place where you just feel like
[1:15:02] i've been left for dead in a dark
[1:15:04] dungeon i've been completely beaten down
[1:15:07] but here's the good news friends there
[1:15:09] is one
[1:15:10] who can take control of your greatest
[1:15:13] enemy

[1:17:02] said in numerous places i'm just going
[1:17:04] to take one from spoken word as original
[1:17:06] seed
[1:17:09] he said all that's in the scripture
[1:17:13] has got to be fulfilled amen
[1:17:17] then if god said anything there you are
[1:17:20] it's got to be
[1:17:21] fulfilled or if it isn't that's not the
[1:17:24] word of god the word of god then
[1:17:27] if it is that isn't the word of god see
[1:17:30] where then where are we at
[1:17:33] let's get something in other words he's
[1:17:36] saying
[1:17:37] if if if the word of god fails
[1:17:40] let's get something that looks like god
[1:17:42] or or anything
[1:17:44] we want to do as the bible said eat
[1:17:46] drink and be merry for tomorrow we die
[1:17:49] now if that is not the word of god
[1:17:52] then we're all lost amen i mean
[1:17:56] there's where our soul hangs tonight
[1:17:58] friends if
[1:17:59] if this book is not true
[1:18:02] you might as well eat drink and be merry
[1:18:05] for tomorrow we die
[1:18:07] amen so so there's you understand
[1:18:10] there's no
[1:18:11] middle ground there's no second place
[1:18:14] there's no
[1:18:14] second bus either this is true or it's
[1:18:17] not true
[1:18:18] and if it's not true let's just all go
[1:18:21] out and and blow it out but if it is
[1:18:23] true
[1:18:23] then let's give our whole life to it
[1:18:25] because it's the only way
[1:18:28] the only truth that can lead us to life
[1:18:30] and life is what i want
[1:18:32] amen life is what i want happy life
[1:18:35] long happy life oh yes i love life
[1:18:40] i love living but i don't love living
[1:18:45] as a failure amen i don't like
[1:18:49] living i don't like underachieving i
[1:18:51] don't i love knowing i'm a son of god
[1:18:54] i love that god loves me i love that i
[1:18:56] love him i love that i
[1:18:58] i love his word i love that i love it i
[1:19:01] love that i believe it i
[1:19:02] love that i see it because
[1:19:05] because the overwhelming majority of
[1:19:08] humanity
[1:19:09] doesn't see it say that's favoritism no
[1:19:12] god said they closed their own eyes yes
[1:19:14] amen
[1:19:15] but there was something inside of you
[1:19:17] something inside of me that said that's
[1:19:19] not for me
[1:19:20] i don't want to close my eyes i want to
[1:19:22] know
[1:19:23] i want god to be honest with me and tell
[1:19:25] me and god is so reliable he'll do that
[1:19:28] he'll tell you here's your problem
[1:19:30] here's what you need and what lord what
[1:19:32] can i do don't worry i can fix it
[1:19:33] just give me your life

[1:19:40] built it i invented it i invented life
[1:19:46] i'm the progenitor of all life all life
[1:19:49] comes from me
[1:19:52] so he says if it's not then
[1:19:56] then wow if it isn't the word of god
[1:20:00] then let's get something that looks like
[1:20:01] god or anything that we want to eat
[1:20:04] drink and be merry
[1:20:05] and and and and if it is the word of god
[1:20:10] watch this now here's a great confidence
[1:20:12] builder
[1:20:14] if it is the word of god
[1:20:17] then god is absolutely honor-bound
[1:20:21] he's honor-bound the god
[1:20:24] who is the fountain of all honor who is
[1:20:27] the beginning of all honor
[1:20:29] who is the source of all honor who is
[1:20:32] the source of all truth
[1:20:34] has got to stand by what he said
[1:20:38] and if this isn't god's word then who is
[1:20:42] god
[1:20:43] where is god or is there
[1:20:46] a god
[1:20:49] brother branham comes to the feast of
[1:20:50] the trumpets and now he's coming to the
[1:20:52] tribulation period
[1:20:54] and how that there was there's a debate
[1:20:57] even in his day it's even to this day
[1:20:59] that that the church goes through the
[1:21:01] tribulation and brother brown said sure
[1:21:03] yeah the church does but not the bride
[1:21:05] right and see that whole wait what
[1:21:08] the church the bride war you you talk
[1:21:10] like they're different
[1:21:11] well they they didn't used to be
[1:21:13] different
[1:21:14] but a unique characteristic of the last
[1:21:17] age
[1:21:18] is like in the first exodus when god
[1:21:20] called a nation out of a nation
[1:21:22] uniquely at the end time he calls a
[1:21:25] church out of a church
[1:21:26] and labels her says i don't call you
[1:21:28] church anymore i call you bride
[1:21:30] you're the elect lady you're the full
[1:21:32] restoration of what
[1:21:33] was back there in the alpha and so he
[1:21:36] says you say the church has to go
[1:21:37] through the persecution for the
[1:21:39] perfection of it brother adam says the
[1:21:40] blood of jesus christ perfects the bride
[1:21:43] a man who chooses a wife don't put her
[1:21:44] through a lot of punishment
[1:21:46] he's already found grace with her she
[1:21:48] has found grace with him
[1:21:50] he engages to her and if and if there is
[1:21:52] anything he'll keep her from every place
[1:21:54] to turn her hand his grace is
[1:21:56] so great upon them and so will it be
[1:21:59] upon the bride and so
[1:22:01] is it on the bride we listen
[1:22:04] we unworthy creatures deserving of hell
[1:22:09] but his grace holds us through it
[1:22:11] [Applause]
[1:22:13] amen that tells me that i wasn't good
[1:22:15] enough to get there you're not gonna
[1:22:17] have to get there
[1:22:18] get off your high horse get over
[1:22:19] yourself and just admit it
[1:22:21] we all deserved hell but his grace
[1:22:25] holds over my life hallelujah
[1:22:28] hallelujah praise god
[1:22:32] psalms 51 brother josh psalms 51-1 i got

[1:22:52] kindness
[1:22:53] according unto the multitude of thy
[1:22:56] tender mercies
[1:22:57] how many want to say this with me blot
[1:22:59] out my transgressions
[1:23:02] wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity
[1:23:05] and cleanse me from my sin
[1:23:07] for i acknowledge
[1:23:10] my transgressions
[1:23:14] and my sin is ever before me against
[1:23:18] thee
[1:23:18] thee only have i sinned and done this
[1:23:20] evil in thy sight
[1:23:21] that thou mightest be justified when
[1:23:24] thou speakest
[1:23:25] and be clear when thou judge us in other
[1:23:28] words
[1:23:29] david is making sure i love this now
[1:23:31] this really turns to the heart of my
[1:23:33] message
[1:23:34] david is is is taking a global stand
[1:23:37] here
[1:23:38] to say listen earth listen all you
[1:23:42] population
[1:23:44] i got nobody to blame but me
[1:23:47] it's not my parents fault it's not my
[1:23:51] spouse's fault it's not the priest's
[1:23:53] fault
[1:23:54] it's not the prophet's fault it's me
[1:23:57] i alone i am guilty i'm standing before
[1:24:01] god
[1:24:01] and i want you to i want the world to
[1:24:03] know i'm
[1:24:04] asking for his mercy amen
[1:24:08] i'm pleading for his loving kindness
[1:24:11] but when he judges me whatever he
[1:24:14] decides
[1:24:15] i want you to know now he's just amen
[1:24:19] amen i want to make this declaration to
[1:24:22] the world
[1:24:22] he's right yes and we're all
[1:24:26] wrong amen all of us
[1:24:30] we're wrong he's the only one
[1:24:34] who's right he's the only one
[1:24:38] who's just say what if what if he
[1:24:41] decides to destroy you
[1:24:42] i don't think he will because my heart
[1:24:46] is crying out for mercy
[1:24:48] and i mean it with every fiber of my
[1:24:50] being and i'm acknowledging my
[1:24:52] transgression
[1:24:52] and i'm not trying to hide my sin and
[1:24:55] i'm pleading to god to have mercy on me
[1:24:57] and he promised that's the kind of
[1:24:59] people that he'll have mercy on
[1:25:02] not of people who are arrogant want
[1:25:04] their own way and don't tell me what to
[1:25:05] do
[1:25:06] just go right on to destruction with
[1:25:09] that kind of thinking
[1:25:10] not me let me off that train let me off
[1:25:13] right here and right now
[1:25:15] i'll take the way with the lord's
[1:25:16] despised few
[1:25:18] hallelujah
[1:25:22] he says
[1:25:26] behold verse 5 behold i was
[1:25:29] shapen in iniquity and in sin did my
[1:25:33] mother conceive me
[1:25:35] behold thou desirous truth in the inward
[1:25:38] parts
[1:25:40] and in the hidden part thou shalt make
[1:25:43] me to no wisdom
[1:25:46] purge me with hyssop that's not
[1:25:50] fun purge me with hyssop
[1:25:54] and i shall be clean wash me and i will
[1:25:57] be
[1:25:58] whiter than snow make me
[1:26:01] to hear joy and gladness
[1:26:05] that the bones which thou
[1:26:08] hast broken may rejoice
[1:26:13] this isn't some weird psychology of some
[1:26:17] man who

[1:26:48] mercy
[1:26:50] and i don't deserve it but that's really
[1:26:52] the point isn't it

[1:28:00] across the street make me a great man of
[1:28:03] wealth and influence

[1:29:06] dependable statement ever made
[1:29:08] was when jesus said i am the way the
[1:29:10] truth and the life declaring that his
[1:29:12] way is the truth
[1:29:14] and there is not another one and it's
[1:29:16] the only way that leads to life

[1:29:22] i and i'm just
[1:29:23] i'm just going to just abandon my notes

[1:29:50] her whole family and
[1:29:52] and black churches and pastors and i was
[1:29:53] sitting on the on the platform

[1:30:17] saying to this black audience he's
[1:30:20] saying
[1:30:21] he said i don't care what you think he
[1:30:24] said
[1:30:24] i'm a black man who believes in a white
[1:30:28] prophet
[1:30:30] and i just kind of i just kind of that's
[1:30:32] when you become a mannequin man you just
[1:30:35] you don't you don't you're not going to
[1:30:36] have a reaction because you're trying to
[1:30:37] look around to see what everybody else's
[1:30:39] reaction to that is
[1:30:42] i can smile okay good brother jewel's
[1:30:44] sitting right here and he's laughing
[1:30:45] okay i can laugh
[1:30:48] and and he meant it
[1:30:52] and he said and and it got excited and i
[1:30:54] kind of got excited because i love
[1:30:55] brotherly anyway
[1:30:56] and he got he got preached and he said
[1:30:58] i'll tell you right now he said
[1:30:59] if you don't believe that he said you
[1:31:01] can meet me out in the yard and he said
[1:31:03] and we he said when you do he said
[1:31:05] brother jason will be standing right
[1:31:06] beside me
[1:31:08] and before i could even stop myself i
[1:31:10] had jumped to my feet
[1:31:11] and i said you got that right and he
[1:31:14] turned around he goes is that right
[1:31:15] brother jason i said you got that right
[1:31:19] and and you know and it was quite a
[1:31:21] moment
[1:31:26] and you know what he brother brother
[1:31:28] blue went after went after
[1:31:30] his own race of people and he said
[1:31:33] y'all can say what you want to and he
[1:31:35] said i know all the political things
[1:31:37] that's going on
[1:31:38] and he said all the black lives matter
[1:31:40] and
[1:31:41] and all of the racist stuff that goes on
[1:31:43] he said
[1:31:44] y'all know as well as me he said we've
[1:31:47] deserved a lot of that stuff that we've
[1:31:49] got
[1:31:51] he starts talking about the the the
[1:31:53] mistreatment
[1:31:56] the abuse by the police and he
[1:31:59] and here's brother i couldn't say that i
[1:32:01] was no way i was going to say that
[1:32:03] because first of all i wouldn't say it
[1:32:05] right and because i got a whole
[1:32:06] different mindset
[1:32:08] yeah and brother blue can say it because
[1:32:10] he's black speaking to his own people
[1:32:11] and he said
[1:32:12] y'all know y'all all know a lot of times
[1:32:14] we deserve those kind of things
[1:32:16] or these boys got beat down like that
[1:32:19] and i just said wow
[1:32:20] and then you know what i thought about i
[1:32:22] thought about yeah that's right
[1:32:24] you know i'm a white guy and i can stand
[1:32:27] here
[1:32:28] to a wide audience and i can remind you
[1:32:30] what brother branham said about us
[1:32:32] yes that the white man is the rascal of
[1:32:36] all of them amen and i can stand and
[1:32:39] look out over any white audience and say
[1:32:42] come on y'all you know racism
[1:32:45] runs deep here in the south
[1:32:49] don't you even try to deny that here's a
[1:32:52] white guy looking at you white people we
[1:32:54] know that's true yeah amen we might as
[1:32:57] well own it we shouldn't hide from that
[1:33:00] brother branham said that's why the
[1:33:02] white man's got it coming because what
[1:33:03] he did to the native american
[1:33:05] and what he done to the african slaves
[1:33:07] yes amen
[1:33:09] and he said the white man is the rascal
[1:33:12] of it all
[1:33:12] you know it would it would it would be
[1:33:15] difficult for brother blue to come to a
[1:33:17] white audience and say that to you but i
[1:33:19] can say it
[1:33:20] and we know it's true yeah amen
[1:33:24] we we even right within the ranks of the
[1:33:27] message there has been times where
[1:33:29] you know we have uh done things and said
[1:33:31] things and we ought to be ashamed of
[1:33:33] ourselves
[1:33:34] amen me included and so

[1:34:50] salvation we all deserve to die and i
[1:34:53] want to say to
[1:34:54] to the humanity of the world everybody

[1:40:28] lift me up higher lord i i want to be

[1:40:38] above your head
[1:40:39] ready to pour down all you have to do is
[1:40:41] reach up and make contact
[1:40:43] just like abraham when he was looking
[1:40:45] for a city
[1:40:46] build an altar and looking for it he's a
[1:40:49] stranger and a pilgrim
[1:40:50] and brother brahm said right where he
[1:40:52] built his altar city was just above him
[1:40:54] right there he he knew it was somewhere
[1:40:57] because he had met its king
[1:40:58] that's what happened to us lord we met
[1:41:00] the king
[1:41:01] we met the king of salem we met the
[1:41:04] priest of the most high god we met
[1:41:07] one under the order of melchizedek
[1:41:11] and now lord god i don't want to be i i
[1:41:13] i don't want to
[1:41:15] [Music]
[1:41:17] to carry on in the mad in this mad world
[1:41:20] and all of its madness and all of its
[1:41:23] all of its comforts and all of its
[1:41:26] carnality
[1:41:28] i want to be like abraham i'm on a
[1:41:30] journey somewhere lord i'm trying to get
[1:41:32] somewhere
[1:41:34] i'm not looking to stay at the level i'm
[1:41:36] at lord i'm
[1:41:37] thoroughly tired of the level that i've
[1:41:39] been at i want to move higher
[1:41:41] it just seemed like lord what a way to
[1:41:43] start a new year
[1:41:45] to come in with just back to back
[1:41:47] services like that and
[1:41:49] one right after another and one right on
[1:41:50] top of another coming back in here
[1:41:52] tonight i was so anxious to come here
[1:41:53] again into this building
[1:41:55] lord pour out your spirit among us pour

[1:42:14] your rightness we want to acknowledge
[1:42:18] lord god the sad
[1:42:21] the sad reality father

[1:42:34] lord god tonight if there is anyone
[1:42:39] who finds themselves at ease
[1:42:43] in this sin cursed world
[1:42:46] lord i pray somehow you break through
[1:42:49] that darkness
[1:42:51] break through it father because there
[1:42:54] there's a disease that a prophet
[1:42:56] referred to as like a pleasure madness
[1:42:59] he called it being pleasure mad over and
[1:43:01] over said it in a message over and over
[1:43:02] and over and over
[1:43:03] pleasure mad pleasure mad pleasure mad
[1:43:06] and he started naming
[1:43:08] actual activities and and things that
[1:43:11] dabbling in this and dabbling in that
[1:43:13] and involved in this and involved in
[1:43:14] that pleasure mad
[1:43:16] and it broke his heart lord because he
[1:43:19] he actually knew that some of people
[1:43:22] who were caught in that affliction with
[1:43:24] that you're talking about a virus you're
[1:43:26] talking about a disease
[1:43:28] [Music]
[1:43:29] and he said many of them lord are your
[1:43:31] children and they don't want to be
[1:43:33] like that they don't want to be caught
[1:43:35] in that
[1:43:37] but satan's got such a grip on him
[1:43:39] master i'm praying tonight
[1:43:41] lord we're going to take up some sick
[1:43:43] requests but the
[1:43:44] the the the thing that needs the most
[1:43:46] prayer is the souls of your
[1:43:49] believing family help us as a church
[1:43:51] help us as a family
[1:43:53] lord god let there be let let this year
[1:43:56] if this is our last year lord
[1:43:58] let us cross the finish line running i i
[1:44:00] i don't want to be
[1:44:02] dull i want to i want to be sprinting to
[1:44:04] to the home line
[1:44:07] lord let us be about the father's
[1:44:09] business let us shake ourselves if we
[1:44:11] have to
[1:44:12] let us make the changes in our lives
[1:44:14] that are necessary
[1:44:15] and break free
[1:44:16] [Music]
[1:44:18] tear free from the pleasure
[1:44:22] madness that grips our minds grips the
[1:44:25] minds of our young people
[1:44:27] every kind of pleasure madness no
[1:44:31] spirituality at all
[1:44:33] no spirituality in the home the whole
[1:44:34] home pleasure mad
[1:44:36] [Music]
[1:44:39] father i'm asking for your help tonight
[1:44:43] as we come to the end of this service
[1:44:45] lord god
[1:44:47] you're the only one i've preached your
[1:44:49] word and i've said everything

[1:54:17] side effects i kept saying there were
[1:54:19] none
[1:54:19] which baffled the doctors i asked

[1:54:39] other than scans periodically i'm so
[1:54:42] overwhelmed
[1:54:43] by the goodness of the lord i'd like to
[1:54:45] thank him for
[1:54:46] all he's done for me a miracle in 2021

[1:55:10] he told her initially she might as well
[1:55:14] get used to it
[1:55:15] doctors visits would be part of her life
[1:55:19] for the rest of her life but today
[1:55:22] he said that isn't necessary now come
[1:55:25] maybe every three months for scans
[1:55:27] our god is so wonderful
[1:55:30] that that just happened hallelujah
[1:55:35] i'll tell you something friends god
[1:55:37] moves
[1:55:38] by prayer brother ronald dean was just
[1:55:42] telling from his own pulpit i didn't
[1:55:43] hear it sister debbie
[1:55:45] was telling me about it and he said he
[1:55:47] was recently at the doctor and he's a
[1:55:48] living miracle
[1:55:49] and he said his last his last visit
[1:55:53] he's sitting in there and he can hear
[1:55:55] the doctors coming and there's a
[1:55:56] there's another doctor shadowing him and
[1:55:59] he says they stopped just outside the
[1:56:01] door and ronaldine could overhear him
[1:56:03] and he said he heard his doctor saying
[1:56:04] to this other doctor he said now
[1:56:06] we're about to walk in here and he said
[1:56:09] when you see this man
[1:56:11] you're going to wonder why is he even
[1:56:14] here
[1:56:15] he said he's going to look and act
[1:56:19] and talk completely normal
[1:56:22] and he said you're going to wonder why
[1:56:24] are we even
[1:56:25] talking to this guy and he said but he's
[1:56:29] the sickest man in this building
[1:56:32] and he said but yet every
[1:56:35] everything we're looking at one miracle
[1:56:39] after another one i'm going to tell you
[1:56:40] something god is backing that thing down
[1:56:43] one step at a time and everything those
[1:56:45] doctors have said
[1:56:46] they have to keep keep taking it back
[1:56:47] keep taking it back
[1:56:49] and he said he said the last thing you
[1:56:51] heard that doctor say now
[1:56:52] we're going to go in here and you're
[1:56:54] going to see that he said but he said
[1:56:56] i'm just going to tell you
[1:56:58] that's just his god
[1:57:01] that's just his god hey guess what
[1:57:03] that's my god too
[1:57:05] guess what it's your god too hallelujah
[1:57:09] and he is still here and he's still
[1:57:11] working miracles

[1:57:16] and you know it's it's not we're not in
[1:57:18] a hopeless situation friend

[1:57:27] bother praying you're not going to get
[1:57:29] nothing from god
