[0:02] well i've seen god's people pray by a
[0:06] hospital bed
[0:10] and i've seen them struggle
[0:12] for their daily bread
[0:17] seen him standing at a grave of one who
[0:20] left us so young
[0:23] and i've heard them crying out for their
[0:27] wayward son
[0:31] but i've never no never
[0:35] seen the righteous forsaken i've seen
[0:38] them with tears in their eyes
[0:41] seen them with their hearts breaking
[0:44] i've seen them tested and tried
[0:48] i've seen them with their face shaken
[0:52] but i've never
[0:53] never
[0:55] seen the watches forsaken
[1:01] i seen it when it seemed like there was
[1:04] no help in sight
[1:08] i've seen it when it seemed like life
[1:10] was nothing but night
[1:14] but in the eyes of heaven
[1:17] something else was going on
[1:20] they may have been all by themselves
[1:24] but they were never alone
[1:29] i've never no never
[1:32] seen the righteous forsaken i've seen
[1:36] her with tears in their eyes
[1:39] seen it with their face shaken i've seen
[1:43] them tested and tried
[1:46] seen them with their face shaken
[1:49] but i've never no never
[1:53] seen the watches forsaken
[1:57] i seen it when it seemed like there was
[2:00] no help in sight
[2:04] i've seen it when it seemed like life
[2:07] was nothing but night
[2:10] but in the eyes of heaven
[2:13] something else wasn't going on
[2:16] they may have been all by themselves
[2:20] but they were never alone
[2:25] i've never no never
[2:29] seen the righteous forsaken i've seen
[2:32] them with tears in their
[2:34] eyes seen them with their face shaken
[2:38] i've seen them tested and tried
[2:42] seen them with their hearts breaking
[2:46] but i've never no never
