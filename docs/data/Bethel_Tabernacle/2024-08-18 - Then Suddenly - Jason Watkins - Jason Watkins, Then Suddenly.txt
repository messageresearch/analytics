different ones amen here today God bless you any of our other visitors God bless you happy to have you Matthew Chapter 13 we want to be praying for um brother Matt he's away ministering amen and I'm not aware of any of the other team members deployed today but I want to be praying for him he's in Arkansas there I think for brother Ben prit so praise God Matthew chapter chap 13: 54 to 57 amen I'm going to preach you today on a on a sermon titled that I'm just titling very simply then suddenly I'm suddenly GNA start preaching amen praise the Lord you were singing everything was going along and then suddenly I walked out amen Matthew 13 vers 54 to 57 you have it say amen amen want to also let me uh before I forget I'll pray over them when we pray but um I know that brother Jack uh was not feeling good this morning sister Kathy said was actually doing good and so now he's with fever and chills and everything brother Mark also not feeling well and uh Brother Bruce sent in h a request for um a woman with a heart condition amen my list here isn't populating for some reason but I remember that's what it was about out so let's be praying amen for that Matthew 13:54 oh yeah here it is brother Jason please remember a friend of mine in prayer her last name is I think it's meric m r c h a ke and she is having trouble with her heart the doctors did a catherization found an artery on the back side of her heart completely plugged they tried breaking through the block but were unsuccessful I didn't even know that could happen and said according to her husband husband or heart is not in the normal position which prevents them proper access that's probably why um prayer is her only hope amen so we're going to join with Brother Bruce for this request brother Mark this morning brother Jack also Amen brother Matt ministering Matthew Chapter 13 Verse 54 and when he was come into his own country he taught them in their synagogue in so much that they were astonished and said whence hath this man this wisdom and these Mighty works is not this The Carpenter's son is not his mother called Mary and his Brethren James and Joseph and Simon and Judas and his sisters are they not all with us whence then hath this man all these things so it's obvious they knew him and he hadn't demonstrated any of this before until suddenly one day he did and they were shocked the Bible says they were astonished verse 57 and they were offended in him imagine that but Jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honor Sav in his own country and in his own house the Bible goes on to talk about many mighty Works he couldn't do because of their unbelief amen so you don't want to find yourself astonished to the at God in anything that he does or anything he allows in your life because he might suddenly let the world turn upside down on you or he might suddenly bring you out of a dark trial and suddenly the clouds break and the sun is out and you're not almost out you're not light at the end of the tunnel you're just out suddenly the world is about to experience the sudden secret coming of the Lord amen the bride is the bride is about to experience the sudden secret catching away of the Lord amen praise the Lord let's pray father we thank you for your word today and I just relax my own Spirit Lord I'm I'm an anxious to cover this material and I ask for your Divine help today may you be with me may you give us all quickened Hearts this morning to believe every word we commit ourselves into your hands in Jesus name amen amen God bless you you can be seated amen praise the Lord and the Lord touch brother Mark brother Jack and this lady for Brother Bruce Lord have mercy on that situation how many know him to be a merciful god amen he sure is my goodness he has come to me in at times where I got to the point where you know and God sometimes not only does he shock you in his suddenness but he astonishes you in how he does it I've had the Lord come to me before when I was suffering with a sickness I remember standing in brother Tim PR's uh guest bedroom and I had meetings there in lisiana and and I was scheduled to preach and it was starting that night Friday Saturday Sunday and I was just at the end with the stomach condition and I was on quadruple prescription medication and could not get relief and I was standing there in such Agony in my stomach that and when that happens to me it feels like the only way I've ever been able to describe it is if you can imagine swallowing a baseball and it's just stuck right there it's not heartburn it's pain that almost you can't function and so I just stood there and I had been praying and praying and praying I went to the meetings praying I got there praying I'm standing in the bedroom I've been praying all day I've been trying to study I'm Walking the Floor Services you know 45 minutes away we're getting ready to leave the house and and I just I'm standing there in the room and I just said Lord I can't go on you've got to heal me and suddenly very softly nothing there was no Thunder there was no lightning a voice just spoke just just a snatch less than an audible voice in the room that's how clearly I heard it and all it said was all right you're healed that was it and I stood there for a minute and I just went okay man said I'm Healed okay I'm Healed and I took a step and I was healed amen and I've had the Lord do that a number of times I remember in a deep dark trial one time impossible no way to get out of it a financial situation many years ago that I'd got myself into and I just said Lord you've got to deliver me I was laying there in the bed just tears because I knew I did it to myself and I said Lord you've got to deliver me a and that same exact voice said all right you're delivered and in 72 hours this happened this happened this happened and I was out and I don't mean light at the end of the tunnel I mean I was out and it was so sudden and so shocking and it left me astonished at the Lord Brother brandham said he preached a whole sermon and a number of other sermons similar to this one but he comes with a title and he says God moves uh God does the unexpected am in unexplainable ways in his Kentucky way of saying it I want you to catch that again God says brother BR says that God does the unexpected in unexplainable ways amen so now I want to just u pull up my PowerPoint we're going to jump right into it I I purposely put this up let's have my title slide Brother Jay and uh we'll we'll get going through it amen praise the Lord all right so I want to take this title today then suddenly and I'm taking for a subtitle God doing the unexpected in an unexplainable way amen all right now I just want to refer you to a few scriptures just to so you get your mind caught up with me on this whole idea of suddenly all right it's very familiar to us Acts 2 verse 1 and 2 and when the day of Pentecost was full fly come they were all with one Accord in one place and what suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled the house where they were sitting I'm going to read you some commentary on that word suddenly from manage thinkers be brilliant Beautiful Mind of of ministers down Through the Ages who who have a take on this word suddenly why does why does Dr Luke write this word suddenly see and he's got a purpose in it and its own purpose it's intentional and he's trying to get your attention all right now here's another verse that doesn't use the word suddenly but it's going to be necessary in my sermon Job 14 but man dieth and wasteth way yay man giveth up The Ghost and where is he now that's been an age-old question people still asking that today and some of them conclude well you're just nowhere this is it when you're done here you're done there is no next see and so they think we're all fooling theirselves well they're wrong because I know my redeemer liveth see he say how do you know because I've met him I talked to him who do you think spoke to me twice and said okay you're healed okay you're delivered that was it and I was both times when it was impossible for it to happen he comes down to verse 14 here's the here's the here's the conundrum of humanity for Millennia multiple Millennia if a man die job could see the trees and the grass and they went down and they came back but if a man die shall he live again he's asking Lord is there an after this I is this it is there an after life now that's an important question because if there is then you need to think about what Jesus said concerning laying up Treasures for it if it's there now Jesus assured you it was there and the fact is I love brother Abraham's take on that he says I go away to he says in my father's house or many mansions and if it weren't so I would tell you and brother abam says you know Jesus was just so honest that he said to the people listen I if I was a fake I would just admit it if none of this was true I would just tell you I would just own it I'm not a deceiver but in my father's house are many mansions and I and guess what I'm going to prepare that place to receive you see so it's real and it's true and there is if a man dies shall he live again all the days of my of my appointed time will I wait till my change comes Joel would go on to catch a revelation by a vision he would see he said I know my redeemer liveth and on the last day I'll see him these eyes I myself will see it so it was the promise of a redeemer why is that important because when you die you're suddenly going to be somewhere else when Jesus was long enough in the Tomb he suddenly the Bible talks about there came an earthquake and there came an angel and rolled the stone away and and there was an an earthquake on his resurrection morning and out he come and it was so shocking that here you have uh here you have Mary talking to him and she thinks he's a gardener it's so inconceivable that this could be the Lord think of how astonished that she was think of how astonished you would be if you if you were talking to a person and sudden realize it's your lost loved one who crossed over years ago and now they here they aren't a young body imagine your shock when you suddenly re wreck oh my goodness see so so he goes on now watch here's another one behold Malachi 3:1 behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his Temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom you Delight in behold he shall come sayith the Lord of hosts and you know from the time Israel had its last prophet it's like 400 years until finally John just comes out of the Wilderness nobody had seen him since a boy 9 years old his parents pass away he goes into the wilderness he's raised by the Lord like like like a wild man he comes out eating W you know wild locust and wild and and wild and honey and he's wrapped in a in Camel's hair and he looks anything but like a prophet at least what they were expecting I'm here to tell you God all always takes the form the world's not Desiring it to be in but it's still him the world because it's that's that doesn't mean there's the world's full of all bad people it just means that Satan is the god of the age and he's always wanted Christ's Kingdom he's always wanted it for himself and so he always goes after it in ways of beauty and ways of uh you know of education and ways of Science and ways of culture he has always done that he has never not done it that way I don't know why people would think today he's going to suddenly change his plan that he's been using very successfully may I end for 6,000 years and so he he managed to deceive the analivian world he managed to deceive Nimrod he managed to deceive all of the great conquerors down Through the Ages he managed to deceive the Caesars of Rome he managed to deceive the church he he man he's always and he comes down to the end time and I'm here to tell you the the word is not like what the general Christian world says it is and Christ is not like they portray him to be and Christians are something different than what the world and that's not abnormal that's natural that's normal it should be expected amen but when the world sees you they think you're weird how's that possible they think you're a cult really me us here here we are we we're wholesome families and love God and Holiness Reigns Supreme we have the token of applied to our home the supernatural Works Among Us people's lives are completely changed from Darkness to light and and somehow we're we're weird and we're CAU and we're wrong when has the Church the true church ever not been like us oh my yeah you're listen friends let me tell you young people let me tell you here me you have not followed cunningly devised Tales you're following a very ancient truth and it's and and all this message in the world is all it is in the world is what God promised he would do a restoration of the original truth it's not anything different than that see we didn't need to write another Bible like the Mormons we didn't need one we got this one this the one we go by we didn't need to come up we didn't need to change our name you know we didn't need to do like Jehovah's Witness where Jesus is just a prince he's not he's the king of glory he's God very God we don't everything we stand stand for is provable in this book I challenge the world to prove otherwise see so so it shouldn't be strange but it is strange and when he appears after we're gone to the wedding supper and he suddenly comes out riding on a white horse and the armies of Heaven following and then every eye shall see him it's sudden it's shocking and the people are astonished and they start wailing amen amen I've said so many times how would you imagine a Christian would see Christ and start wailing I mean what you does that inform your thinking does that weigh does that cause you to think about what would cause that these are Christians supposedly and they see Christ and they're afraid and they're wailing why what Christian wouldn't see Christ and both hands would go up and you start screaming Hallelujah see so there there's got to be something behind it now Brother brandham Talks quite extensively um Let me let me let me pause that for a moment did we read it all he shall suddenly come to his Temple right let's read it behold I send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord who whom you seek shall suddenly come to his Temple even the messenger of the Covenant we did read it whom you Delight in behold he shall come sayith the Lord of hosts so in the in this in this appearing it's going to be people who Delight in the Lord see not not everybody delighted when when he came to his Temple when Jesus came to his Temple the Bible says they were offended at him see and he said well a prophet's not without you know accepting his own He he'll have honor everywhere except the people who know him and so but yet even still when he went into the synagogue a place where they claimed they're worshiping him and he takes the book and set reads Isaiah's prophecy sits down all the eyes are fastened upon him and he said this day guess what suddenly you should have been expecting it I know what I'm about to say is going to astonish you but hang on breathe it's okay what's happened is is it may have snuck up on you I know it's been 400 years but you ought to have believed John you want to have believed I told you I would send Elijah before me I did he came here I am what's the problem and he says this day this scripture is fulfilled and they go to try to throw him over a cliff see you you they're so astonished they're so stunned that nothing is like they thought they knew it was coming it's not like they thought it would be see but he suddenly comes anyway brother brandham goes into a lot of detail let me make sure I don't want to go yeah correct we'll go there and we'll pause it brother brandham talks about we're going to read it here in just a little bit about how that you know historically they were the Jews were expecting a great political leader a great warrior a great Champion a great Soldier a great military General to come in and and give them back their autonomy reestablish them as a nation kick the Romans out and be able to reestablish a theocracy there uh in in Israel and brother bam didn't pull that out of thin air he people don't realize yeah he he only had a seventh grade education you know perfectly speaking but brother brandham if you ever seen his library and I have a list of all the books he read he has all the classics all the history and he read them all and he read a lot he was a very well- read man and and it didn't even take me just that long I didn't it didn't take me minutes to to figure out wonder where he got this claim that they were looking for a general and they were looking for a political leader but Alfred idim writes about it in The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah Joseph clausner writes about it in the Messianic idea in Israel uh Julius Scott Jr writes about it in the Jewish background of the New Testament and but instead of a great political leader God did the unexpected they were expect in a great political military leader but God did the unexpected he humbled them by sending them a baby in a Manger instead amen now so so let's let's just talk let's just talk about some more sudden shocking astonishing moments we find that the Shepherds there in Luke's gospel when they were in the fields feeding their sheep and suddenly the angel of the Lord appears and and announces the birth of Christ and within moments a heavenly host of angels are suddenly everything lights up and there's a whole chorus of angels praising God and worshiping God and they're saying oh we bring Good Tidings of good news where we get the song Noel see it mean it's a it's a Latin word meaning there's been a birth see the savior is born and he's in Bethlehem and and this was this was astonishing uh to to these Shepherds they were astonished now because it had never happened before and all the chronicles of their history among all their Heroes I mean going all the way back to Abraham and even Beyond now Angelic visitations of course had not were not new but announcing the birth of Messiah wait what see so so that you know th this was this was you know because Abraham I mean we we we read about job that job had seen a redeemer amen you say those Shepherds should have known yeah they should have been expecting him because he had been prophesied job saw him Abraham had been told going all the way back to Abraham they knew that Abraham had been made a promise that your seed Not seeds seed singular Christ seed the word seed amen will produce a kingdom that that will be will outnumber the sand grains of all seash shores that this seed will bring forth a kingdom of saints that will outnumber the stars of heaven and they don't even know how many stars there are they they know there's more galaxies than there are grains of sand on all the beaches over all the Earth that's what they can see and then they they don't even know what they don't know yeah and so here Abraham has made this promise you would think that it wouldn't shock anybody that when it got announced yeah it was sudden but everybody should have just was said wow okay everything we've been waiting for I'm here to tell you something friends for 2,000 years the Christian church has waited for the Rapture and what the world is missing is it's already started and it's already in process and you talk about something shocking when you say that to people so this is not not just another announcement because like all prophecies announcing his coming these Angels were not announcing he's coming the angel of the Lord came to them to say I'm not here to tell you he's coming I'm here to tell you he's here that's exactly what he did at his second coming a prophet steps up and he says my Ministry is not to tell you he's coming the church has known that for 2,000 years I'm here to tell you he's here among us see so you know that should certainly speak to us as it relates to the ministry of William brandom that was constantly that he's not coming that he's here and what's what's a what's you know more ironic to me is that he would he would come to the end of a prayer line and this happened thousands and thousands of times you can hear 1,00 times just listing to tapes when brother brandham is going to start the prayer line and he's just talking away he'll say you know what I'm waiting for and then suddenly brother Brandon would say okay he's here I mean who had the audacity and the authority but not only could William brandham say he's here he could prove it and he proved it over and over and over and over and over and over did I say over over that's a lot of times and over more and more and more and more and he proved it around the world thousands of times said now he's here I take every Spirit under my control for the glory of God I'm here to tell you friends that one that came here has never left here a prophet went home but now he's here to to to be enthroned in your heart so that you can now take authority over every evil spirit for the glory of God you can take authority in your home in your life among your children don't unell what God's presence means to you in this moment of time so he taught us that his ministry was not merely to say he's coming but he's here Herod also when he received the announcement of the wise men two years later saying that Messiah is already born in the earth he's already here and you know he seemed shocked he seemed confused the all of his wise men he starts asking around and they're all running around they're all in confusion they they they the the sudden realization appears to have shocked and Confused everyone amen think of the runup now think of the runup and I'm I I'm going to try not to get too deeply in the in the details because I'm not really trying to correlate I just want to say that I'm not trying to perfectly correlate every type in Shadow here I'm just going to speak generally you good because the runup to Messiah you had all of these prophets coming on the scene and they're all talking about from the time of Abraham on and every time a prophet's coming he's got Messianic prophecies and the Old Testament is filled with Messianic promises about Messiah about he's coming he's going to be here and then Malachi comes and says the one whom you seek yeah we're all been seeking him since the days of Abraham well guess what he'll suddenly come to his Temple okay great where's he at man it's been an hour it was going to be 400 years it's going to be a lot of hours a lot of generations were going to be going like that wow see so so you think of the of the runup to Messiah and then and then what do you get a long protracted lull like nothing's really happening Lots was happening but it didn't it it it looked like a l we're we can feel that way today we can we can say man seals were open we know that that couldn't have come to the ministry of the son of man we know the ministry of the son of man was the sign of mezc that was the last sign the world would see before the bride goes home that's not an opinion of a man or my opinion your opinion that's scriptural prophecy laid out clearly see and so so but yet here we still are more than half a century later see and so but we're and and really all we have to go by is constantly we hear you know Peter saying hold on don't think that the Lord is late late to the party he's just very gracious trying to get everybody in that he can he's got to find all those names on the on the Lamb's Book of Life some of them weren't even born when the seals were opened amen amen I wasn't born when the seals were opened I was born months later and so so they had to and and and you I've had children and my children have had children and the generations are coming up now I'm here to tell you there is a last generation and I believe it's on the earth now there are two prophets to go to Israel and I believe they're on the earth now there is a message and it's here now Hallelujah the presence of Christ is here now Glory a table is being prepared now the world is falling apart and that's happening at Breakneck speed say could it go on another 100 Years brother brandham answered that he said it could go on another 100 years but I that was from his day I would just tell you if you ask me that question today I would just have this simple answer I don't see how the Earth could survive another hundred years there it's so insane and and everything on a hair trigger right now you remember we just show preached a sermon where we were showing you nuclear proliferation and and and and all it takes is one madman that's just one see and so you think the world might have a few Mad Men has there ever been a day like this day with Mad Men see so you think about the runup to Messiah and then suddenly there's a law you know and and and even and I think it's John who says you know he'll come and he won't tar John it's been 2,000 years since you said that buddy so then where's the mind of God versus your mind cuz God not lying and his Apostles not lying see and and I realized that really it's perfect because when when brother brandham says you know you you say this and you say it's wrong he says you'll find out one day when California is laying beneath the ocean out there and Hollywood is sunk down that that's going to come suddenly see yeah that's going to shock you're talking about a shock to the world we did that the numbers on it you're talking about it's not it's not catastroph Ric it's cataclysmic it's almost off the scale and and so we find out that you have this run up then there's this law then a Revival breaks out after a long LW John is baptizing saying the Kingdom of Heaven is coming and there's one among you now now I don't know who he is yet amen but I was told what to look for see but I know here's my here's the message of Elijah he's here now among you see and so then suddenly suddenly suddenly like every other day at the Jordan John's been baptizing people for months now and suddenly here's another day that just looks like another day oh one of those other another days is going to come for you and I friend and suddenly John comes up and he looks into the crowd and here comes Jesus pressing through he wasn't born right then he'd been born for 30 years and suddenly he presses through the CR out and John goes there he is that's the one of whom I told you that he who's coming after me I'm not worthy to lose his you who is he John be clear it's the Lamb of God no ambiguity that's what a prophet would say he's not a denominational system he's the word he clearly identified him by the word and this is what the word say how do you know that it's Christ influencing my life if your life matches this then it's a a foregone conclusion because this is Christ in letter form amen so suddenly the Lamb of God the Messiah I've been telling you about he's here John 1:15 I don't have it on my slide says John bear witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom I spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me imagine a human looking at another human and and the birth record records at the hospital showed this was a lie John said he was before me hold on John we went and found the records of the hospital apparently you don't know when you were born see so God's prophets are all the time misunderstood like that amen so when the presence of the Lord you know and the spirit of Elijah would come again today he would often say the very same thing Behold the Lamb of God he's here and he can prove it but just you remember that when he in when the spirit said pick up your pen and write it would not he actually said that the the the the the duty of the prophet of this day was to point out the word born bride to identify her clearly that she because there's 33,000 different versions of of everyone saying we're the bride and it took a prophet with prophetic insight to show who the real bride is see and this is the part of the word of God Brother JD was talking about this in his last sermon on Wednesday so brilliant because you have to realize that that there's all kinds of listen friends this will help you there's all kinds of parts in the word of God that a student can sit down they did this in the man age yeah amen and a student can compare verse with verse and there's a lot of stuff that they can eek out and pull out and it's actually accurate it's actually not even close to Accurate it's actually perfectly accurate see and and but yet we find that there's parts of the mystery of redemption the mystery of redemption as a whole is not you can't do it that way it requires the teaching of the Holy Ghost it requires a new birth brother Bram said it won't it can't just take a student comparing verse with verse it's going to take somebody with prophetic Insight who's not a student but he is a a conduit he is a microphone that God can speak through and and reveal the mystery of redemption cuz that's locked away no one can understand the mystery of redemption until the spirit makes it plain to them amen amen see so people who say we don't need a prophet in this day they just don't know what they're talking about even if we and Brandon was prophet there has to be one see so so you know um so as we were saying as as related to the Fulfillment of Malachi 3:1 although the Jews by this and many other prophecies they knew that Messiah would come and yet they were surprised at his sudden appearance on the scene moreover the the the reality of the form he took shocked them um because they said wait a minute yeah we we got a lot of confidence in John but Jesus of Nazareth you understand say we saw him raised as a boy we know his dad his mom his brothers his sisters we watched him playing in the streets you know as a teenager he was over at my house hanging out with my kids and you're saying this is the Lamb of God this boy we grew up around that was exactly right and to disbelieve it was a death sentence see so so as far as being the Messiah he was nothing like they expected they they expected you know God to drop down a conveyor and the Son of God would just come down he'd be a great General so then and then all right now now let's let's look it further let's just follow it along for a minute again I'm not trying to uh dot every eye and cross every tea as far as applying types to what we saw in history I'm just speaking generally because it wasn't long after that that John was taken off the scene rather gruesomely to everyone's shock and dismay and then it went on to Jesus and then he shook the world with his ministry and then and lo and behold he gets killed and he's dead and he's in a tomb mindblowing what amen I mean you we'll talk about it in places I mean it was so discouraging Peter just said Peter what are you gonna do I don't know what do you think about all this you know what I'm just going fishing I'm just going back to what I know I cannot explain why he's dead I cannot explain why he's in a tomb I cannot explain why the devil apparently won I thought he would be a king I thought this was it we thought it was the restoration that's not that's not that's not that's not no it's nothing like we thought he came on the scene and astonished us he left the same way you know amen is that Bible Jesus meets them on those walking on the road to EMAs and they're all downcast and he says why are you downcast they said 'w you what are you a stranger' you don't read the news you the the of Jesus of Nazareth what about him well we thought he would be the king of Israel and now they killed him and it's been three days he's by this time he's stinking and there's some crazy cooky women who said they saw him well how ridiculous is that see God does the unexpected in unexplainable ways see so he he appeared to them in the room and at first first when he just walked in and there the the 11 the 11 disciples who are remaining out of all of his big church he had hundreds and hundreds and everybody flocked to him and and he he's got thousands and now he's down to 11 troops and they're sitting in a room and suddenly he doesn't open a door he doesn't crawl through a window he just walks through the wall and it appears suddenly and at first they can't speak because of fear amen and then when he preat some food and proves to him it's him then suddenly they can't speak for joy see so so the whole thing is that it was so sudden and it was so unexpected now it shouldn't have been right because he told them this is what I'll do this is exactly what will happen and so they're you know they're they're back to fishing again and and they're in the boat and Peter and John and they're fishing and the next thing you know Jesus suddenly appears on the shore wow children have you any meat who's that old guy and John's looking wait a minute that's the Lord Peter rips off his tunic Dives in half-dressed swim he can't even wait on the boat he swims all the way to the shore I mean this was sudden this was unexpected this was UN inexplicable and yet this is how God operates he he you know they they come to the to the Mount of Olives and they my goodness they pepper him with questions you know when shall these things be and when will there won't be one stone and is this the you know are you going to now restore the kingdom he comes there on the Mount of Olives as he's get ready to to sin will you now restore the kingdom and you know um some of the questions he'll answer uh some of them he he won't answer some of them he can't answer see CU he doesn't know yet he's going to get a revelation uh later and that's why John's going to be put on patmas and so so we find that but but he did have some instructions oh yeah he did say to them here's what you need to do don't worry about when the kingdom is coming the father has I promise you the father's got this I know it doesn't look good I know there was a big lull and then there was John and then he was gone and then I was here and then I was gone and then the tomb and I and and I appeared in the room and I talked to the GU on Aus Mary didn't recognize me and you're trying to ask me now is the kingdom no it's actually not but here's here here's what I here's what I can tell you go and be ued T in the cityall until how long until now it's going to turn out to be 10 days because at this point it's 40 days and it's got to be 10 more days for the Pentecostal Feast out of the Old Testament in The Book of Leviticus but he says go and and Terry and he didn't tell them 10 days he just said until I'm here to tell you when God gives you a vague order he knows how long it's going to last he knows what's going to happen just do it don't question him just go do it how long Lord how long we wait what do we do what you know which just go do it just go t until because the power is coming but that power that was to come was not only already known of God it was already it was a a perfect point that the Lord knew I'm here to tell you when is the rapture coming exactly when the Lord knows it's time when are we going to see our loved ones not one minute past that time Hallelujah friends when are we going to be at a marriage supper of the Lamb I don't know but I know we won't be late hallelujah how long's this trial going to last I don't know but he's got it how long will I suffer I don't know I can't say but I know by his stripes you can claim healing I know that you can have faith for your family I know they're out there I know what this has been happening I'm here to tell you God knows all about it Hallelujah it doesn't matter if it's a la or it's unexpected or it comes in a different way your trust is to be in his word hallelujah and he gave us a word to be trusted do you believe he's earned your trust third of you do you believe Jesus has earned your trust certainly has earned mine see so a power is coming on you and you'll be a witness of me from this Jerusalem then it'll be out into Judea and then you like a concentric ring then you'll go all the way out to Samaria and then you'll go to the uttermost part of the earth see so from Jerusalem to all the world all the world H all the world so we're not going in the Rapture right yet when this gospel has went into all the world then the end shall come then they came to 10 long days of questions and lot more bewilderment why am I brother Jason what's why are you preaching on this today because we suffer a lot of the same bewilderment what's going on what's Happening why are we still here the world's crazy we can't take it Lord's left us here too long what's up see I'm here to tell you it's all perfectly harmoniously synchronized choreographed under God's control in God's hands by God's power see you I mean if you don't believe that then how did you get born again I promise you you couldn't have done it to yourself amen there had to be a time and a place when you were running but somebody could run faster Hallelujah and somebody tripped you from behind you were trying to get away you might be trying to get away today I'm here to tell you he can outr run you he can out weigh you he can put you on the ground Jacob found that out wrestling the angel I'm here to tell you I would just say surrender surrender surrender see so you know brother Brandon talks about that you know there's so much bewilderment and controversies about what do we do and you know brother Brandon picks up The Narrative there and he says you know some of them said you know you know you know you know Simon i u i feel something man I I just think we must already have it and we've been here like four and a half days how long we supposed to you know nobody God's not we got God's reasonable God's not going to expect us to stay here for five days come on I I did you hey did you feel something the other night yeah I felt a little funny feeling and and I was thinking about the word and something kind of started happening in that we must have it let's go boys come on and 500 who seen him go by the time I don't know what happened to him Bible doesn't tell us all I know is by day 10 only 120 are left yes amen only 120 didn't run off here and run off there but 120 stayed with what he said stay until you be endued with power hallelujah it's no time to run run for the for the exits friends that's not the time our Redemption draw us nigh we're almost home oh Hallelujah so then and then the Bible says then suddenly there came a rushing Mighty Wind so I'm not trying to explain every detail I'm not trying to correlate every event with minute Precision I'm only attempting to show you that God does the unexpected and he does it in unex it's not just the unexpected but when he actually does it it's an unexplainable ways amen see so as to the end time sequence of events how they unfold I often encounter people in this day in bewilderment and questions you know we're still here you know uh well but we didn't expect to be you know Prophet was saying this and a prophet's saying that and I look for him every morning and there's nothing left for the church I'm not looking for Revival I'm looking for the coming he said he's right among you now it's the kingdom coming so many different things the prophet said watch let's look let's look at some of it oops cut it off so I can cut it there we go God doesn't call now notice that title God doesn't call a man to judgment without first warning him amen a prophet foresees way off he's going to talk about Amos here in a minute here's a lesson for you about prophets this is prophets 101 all right a prophet foresees way off see see the things that is coming he sees the cup of God's Wrath full before it's filled he can say thus sayeth the Lord God will destroy this city except you repent why he's an eagle he rides way up yonder sea and he looks way off here and he sees that Cup of Wrath poured out that's what the prophet's looking at he ain't looking what's going on here he's looking Yonder he's saying it's coming he can go so high till he can see that shade he said the world will be dark referring back to Isaiah darkness and gross Darkness he's up high enough the Sun's shining now but he sees that shade coming and he's saying what he's looking at it ain't here yet but it'll sure be here the world wasn't totally insane in 1964 1965 but a prophet could see it and says I'll prophesy to you in the name of the Lord the world will go completely insane he wasn't talking about there he was talking about here he was seeing it there which was here and saying it's right Among Us now and yet it took more than a half a century more than we've been here almost 70 years and and I'm just only in the last 10 years have we seen the madness that defies all human logic and explanation defies the science itself they're all the time saying trust the science I wish they would amen everybody wants to trust wants me to trust the science until I go to back to basic biology and then suddenly nobody wants to trust the science see so so he he he goes on watch uh let me see where I'm at you good all right so he says that's right it's going to be here gross Darkness upon the people he knows it's coming years away yet he sees it Amos that anointed prophet of God he saw the darkness and the Judgment see he seen Syria come down with their chariots and sweep through there slaughter them people out he saw it coming and the Judgment of God was upon them now 50 years before it happened but you see being a prophet he was lifted up into the spirit and he saw it far off he saw the cup full before it was filled amen see all right so he sees it full before it was filled so we agree today we agree on the general events of the Rapture of the church but how it will be played out is the question but here's but here's what I do see I see a pattern that after Revival there can often appear in the Scripture A a pattern of lingering law until suddenly yes amen it's all running up and everybody's going and this thing is gety up let's go and all of a sudden something happens what wait huh how'd that happen and then a long low and then and then everybody's like wow man it's just never going to happen until suddenly brother bham said you're going to turn around one of these mornings in your kitchen and there's going to be standing that parent or that loved one that crossed over you'll feel a little funny feeling like a little pain last pain you'll ever feel I'm here to tell you something friends the world is not expecting that they're not expecting what's going to happen because the Bible says that the day is coming like has never been you understand and and and so there we're going to be gone home and then the Wrath and the judgments begin to be poured out I mean look how how off guard look how surprised and astonished Putin was just a couple weeks ago he never expected Ukraine to be so audacious that they're going to launch a now they're actually controlling hundreds of miles and cities in Russia and they don't know what to do about it and he's s trying to scramble armies they got to come up with a solution I promise you you know that I mean in the Middle East everything's on a hair trigger amen and it's only going to take one madman right brother Bram carries on now when he speaks of his vision whether it's wrath or whether it's healing it may linger but it's got to come to pass if he speaks it in the name of the Lord see it might be a blessing that he speaks for you he might tell you a certain thing and you can't see it at all right you can't see it at all right you say how can it be why it's uh I he told me thus sayith the Lord this is going to happen and that was going to happen and it ain't happened the man is wrong now you'll be judg for disbelieving it but it's going to happen anyhow see it's got to happen happen though it linger quoting the scripture though it linger the Bible said yet it will speak in its season it'll come to pass the prophet's only looking off and seeing something he's talking about what he's looking at he ain't thinking uh he ain't thinking about here and what you look like now he's looking what it's going to be I'm so glad the Lord does that I'm so glad the Lord don't don't grade me whether I'm Rapture Ready by way I look now but I know on that morning I'll look different I'll be different and then suddenly I will be different Hallelujah see so he says and when he speaks that if it's in the word if it's if it's in the word of the lord it's already been spoken there's nothing in the world can stop it you see that's right only God himself notice he says he still good yeah notice I haven't even been an hour yet so everybody I can feel you starting to get tired but just stay with me will you do it I hope I haven't ruined you to 58 minute sermons so just stay with me today this is this is life and death friends notice now we find that when he speaks his vision the prophet does now sometimes he speaks good things he speaks of your healing all right you might think it's just can't happen I've got I I haven't gotten any better then what does that do that just brings the Judgment of God upon you that's right when he said that you can be healed by his stripes and then you disbelieve that and you start confessing the opposite of that well then you wonder why your sickness remains see and so he goes on he says here Jesus promised to save you if you if you'd believe it if you don't believe it it won't happen to you you got to accept it you got to believe it see and you got to know from where it comes from that gives your faith in God or your Prophet see you got to believe it all right you've got to believe it now let me get down through that all right so that often times is where the crisis lies because he he makes a prophecy concerning the end time and he says when I come how many are looking for him to come he says will I find faith not will I find church members or find Christians will I find Faith remember that there there' come in the last days people who would who would uh have a form of godliness but they would deny the very power thereof in other words the real reality of it because because there you know will I find faith in other words will I find action and will I find power and demonstration manifesting in a people who are overcoming the deception of the age if God comes today is that what he's going to find in you say well I've been a church member I go to church I do this I give bombs I pay I give to the poor I pay my ti I sing in a choir I read my Bible but but will he find faith is your life being lived worthy of the Gospel are you overcoming will he find Faith amen see so because if you notice in the scripture here's a pattern for you I've not been trying to pull patterns but here's a pattern you can look at when both times when the ministry of Elijah comes at his first coming and the ministry of Elijah comes at his second coming in both cases the word the next event is the word made flesh living in humans amen you understand as soon as John came as Elijah then Jesus came on the scene a prophet comes Elijah comes back in the this day and what happens the word gets made flesh again in a people John went home that didn't stop Jesus a prophet in our day went home that doesn't stop the bride will he find faith in your life be honest answer that question to yourselves see so this word suddenly is a very powerful word carries a sense of unexpectedness that things happen often without warning or Preparation and that's the real rub that that's why Jesus said make sure you're you're careful don't get laxed don't get lazy cuz the master will come back and catch you unawares you'll suffer many stripes for that see so I I feel so sorry for people who go the way of the world and you and I'm sitting here knowing what's going to happen I've done that myself and I know what what what is inescapable and then suddenly the Lord's going to Spring the Trap and they're going to get caught in it and they're going to realize that they walk that path for a little too long and suddenly now they got to turn around and all kinds of problems are in their wake and now they're needing God to help them help me with my career help me with my finan help me with my children help me with my grandchildren help me with my church help me with this yeah why didn't you just take the way of the word why didn't why did you sew seeds of discrepancy and then pray for a crop failure Hallelujah come on is this right see so he so he says you you don't do that because he's going to come at an unexpected time in an unexpected way so so we find that it carries this sense of it it it can evoke feelings of surprise this word sudden it can invoke shock it can even evoke fear I'm just reading from from Webster and different things Google looking it up and he says and and one commentator says but it can also signal a positive change a sudden burst of good news this word sudden see it can be um it can be a a pleasant turn of events that's an understatement on rapture morning amen it's a word that catches your attention and it Demands a reaction I mean hey if you're downtown and you step off a curbed across the street and you don't see that car coming quick and suddenly you see him you better have a reaction I promise you you better have a reaction you better not stand there and go three two one well I guess I better you'll get well I guess I better see so this is why acts two and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven Malachi 3 and the one whom you seek will suddenly come to his Temple so it so in in in and here's a here's a commentary on Luke's word I told you that that they comment on Luke's usage of the word sudden because it signals a significant God God fueled event the sudden in Malachi 3 the sudden coming of the Lord to his temple in Acts 2 and two suddenly again it serves to emphasize the unexpected and the miraculous nature of the event in both of these cases in both of these scriptures the word suddenly carries a sense of urgency and anticipation so this has happened you need to have reaction what we need to do whatever you're doing needs to be quick whatever it needs to you need to get some gumping you need to have some Faith you need to get stirred up you need to go pray you need to figure out get in your Bible go back talk to the Lord whatever you do don't just sit in the lethargy of leod deia and be lukewarm it's going to pass right by you Hallelujah I don't intend to let it pass by me oh that morning when the trumpet of God sounds I expect to go home I know it's been a l I understand that but I'm expecting the soon sudden coming of the Lord Jesus Christ see amen can I carry on so it reminds us the use of the word suddenly reminds us that God works in ways that we often cannot predict and sometimes cannot fully understand see so I mean look let's just let's just take this for an example the world the denominational Christian World knew has known for 2,000 years that Christ is coming is that fair so imagine their shock I get it imagine their shock when a prophet steps up who they've called a prophet he didn't call himself that they've called him that they according to their testimony it's the greatest Supernatural Ministry since the days of Jesus that's their words and the that's replete I wish they'd print some of that on their stupid sites all the evidence we actually do have not the stupid speculation that they aim at but actually all of the almost an innumerable amount of Highly regarded Christian men who lived back there during his time and walked with him and said he was the most humble man they'd ever seen said that gift was never wrong never and tens of thousands of times NE they went back to his translators who weren't followers of his message and they said no he never made a mistake that was always perfect always perfect see and and and to have that man step up and he's gonna he's going to say something about the event they've expected for 2,000 years the Rapture of the church and he comes to the pull pit not of his own he said i' have made a horrible mistake he came in the room and told me and he comes and preaches and informs the bride that the Rapture you remember that that 2,000 year thing we've been waiting on it's already started imagine the shock that they wow how could a prophet with that kind of accuracy be wrong and it's left them in a conundrum they they can't dis they can't discredit him there's too many there's too many thousands of witnesses there's too many documents too many doctors too many people got in line to testify but how are they going to make sense of this the Rapture is on yeah because it's in a shout that's it's actually what you didn't know was Paul was saying it's in three stages I'm so glad that I see that I'm so glad I'm a part of it I'm sorry they don't see it but I'm glad I do see it and I pray that you'll see it today we're not waiting on it to commence it's already underway are you a part of it he's not coming to find Faith he's asking today do you have it in your life now in this Serv right here where you sit can he see the faith in you and say what does it look like it looks like the power of God overcoming the deception of the age and taking a stand for the word of God that's what faith looks like see prise God you talk about something unexpected I mean have we forgotten that have we have we forgotten that has the law been this many decades long to where we have forgotten that is that possible that the world has went on for these decades and I've already proven to you that's not unusual but we have to ask ourselves the question what's going on under my roof yes amen what's going on in my heart what's going on in my life and in the life of my family you you see it's one one thing to say I'm a Believer but but does your life does the wake coming behind your life look like Faith amen or has Leo DEA just LED you into a a place of lethargy my I I wonder sometimes if we I wonder sometimes can I just be honest now as a pastor I wonder sometimes and I wonder about this within my own self now I'm not just pointing at you my wife and I have this conversation all the time you know what happened to so many of the old standards that have just been swept aside standards for our home standards on the way we live standards of our church attendance standards for tithes and offerings standards for our children standards for our teenagers standards for all of these all of these ancient landmarks and standards have just like well they just don't matter they just like dulled out almost like grayed out you know you're like you're looking at a screen and there's a link but it's grayed out you can't click it anymore and and and I and I just wonder has has the has the fact that the Rapture that we're not waiting on it it's already underway and it's already in the voice and the last thing to happen is the dead in Christ to rise and maybe California first which I think probably maybe on the same morning they'll hit Sy synchronously but and I can stand here but I'm not telling you anything you haven't known for for 70 years but has it become background noise me look you all in the eye has it become background noise man I'm not going to look you in the eye anymore that's too serious wow because when I'm looking at you I'm looking at me you're the product of my Ministry so what's up has that fact become background noise in our marriages in our homes in our teenagers in our work in our careers in our prayer life and in our T I mean the the list goes on and on and on and brother Brandon described it as a lowering of the bars and sheep are getting out and they're grazing in the grasslands of the world and say what's so bad about that there's poisonous weeds out there the shepherd don't have any poisonous weeds in his field they're all taken out by the word am it ought to concern us see because I'm here to tell you you being in a state of lethargy ain't going to stop the suddenness of it it's going to suddenly and and I'm and now and now I'm not even talking about the catching away you might have tomorrow where something happens in your life and it's going to it could happen suddenly and you realize you need God and you are miles from him amen see amen and you suddenly need to repent and you suddenly need to pray you suddenly need to get me on the phone you suddenly need help see the Rapture of the church is on it's underway right now you talk about something ultimately unexplainable to someone outside someone without a born again experience how you going to explain that the Rapture is already on you you you can't even hardly put it in words now that that that doesn't mean you can't explain it in the scripture right amen of course you can can explain the three phases I can explain the coming of the Lord I can tie it back to Luke 17 I can tie it to Malachi 4 I can tie it to Revelation 10 I can tie it to Revelation 18 that's easy to do that's just X's and O's you understand that's just a spec sheet but but but it's not that I can't accurately describe it in the scripture it's certainly explainable in the scriptures but that doesn't mean they will believe you it doesn't mean they will see it but to God's family it immediately becomes clear the Bible becomes a brand new book to you as well am I preaching to people who believe that today who've experienced it you discovered guess what you discovered that you're an eaglet you're also part of the eagle family also and you hear a prophet and you begin to feel lift coming up under your wings try to explain that to someone try to explain that you you begin to get a sense of altitude you realize I'm not in that barnyard of the world anymore somehow I got up here in the upper Stratosphere you can't put that in the language it's Faith it's in your life oh you discover you begin to get this sense of it see I'm not I'm not I'm not trying to put this feeling into words to you but a fellow you know what a fellow Eagle he don't really need my words you're already there you already know what I'm talking about it's already a living reality to you that words cannot explain Hallelujah when you open your Bible when you turn on a tape you feel yourself lifting up into another dimension try to put that in in an understandable way to explain it to somebody that's not something you can fully explain easily it's something you have to experience it's let me tell you it's something the Lord can do for you right now in this service say that's weird to me that's strange I don't know anything about that you can you can and you can know about it right now the Holy Spirit can suddenly a sound can come from heaven and sweep into this building and maybe you don't need to hear a sound in the building but it's echoing in your soul right now and you don't just want to say Lord I want to get that altitude I want to feel the lift under my wings hallelujah oh my those in in Jerusalem they knew they were supposed to be infused with power amen they knew that yes Luke's use of the word suddenly you know it was it was it was saying to the world that something incredible has happened to us something incredible is the word of the hour incredible to you yes see or has it lost its Savor has it just become background noise H have you let the devil lure you away because it's been this many decades even though that's scriptural and and yeah we had all this great power we still do there was so much Supernatural there still is it's popping happens all around us friends the very fact that you can still be a believer in an impossibly Dark Age is all the power you need to get you home I don't need God to ever do another thing he don't have to heal me he don't have to deliver me he don't have to do nothing he brought me out of the deep myy clay set my feet on a rock to stay hallelujah what more power you want people in the streets here's what here here what was amazing people in the streets when they saw those Jews come out of that Upper Room like man what in the world we got to we got to have a reaction here we need to explain this and you know they they they thought maybe they were drunk you know it was I mean what else could they think it was so otherworldly it this was so out of the norm they had never seen Jews act like that they knew it to to sometimes affect prophets that way and Prophets would do really strange things but here's a whole group of people here's a whole church of 120 people and they're climbing out windows and they're falling down the stairs and they're out into the street and we heard rumors that they were a bunch of mechanic filled cowards those rumors weren't false but they're not that anymore since the sudden rushing might wind came in and they're they're they're they're trying to put an explanation you know but but you know I mean I mean it they're trying it's the only thing they could think of can I say it that way it's we can only correlate there's only one thing we can think to correlate what we're seeing you guys must be drunk uh really third hour of the day yeah that's tough yeah it don't make sense to us you know you know what happened that's the way the world looks at it but it was it was happening right in front of those devout Jews in an unexplainable way and you know what it took it took Peter anointed of the Holy Ghost to reveal what was happening it took Peter to go back to Joel's prophecy and say you know you remember Joel yeah you remember he said that he would pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh yeah this is it this is that this is what you remember on All Flesh and old men would dream dreams young men would see Visions yeah this is that you mean where the handmaidens and everybody gets involved and it becomes a whole church and a whole Kingdom yeah yeah exactly this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel th th this prophecy they're looking at this prophecy and Peter is trying to get them to understand that that prophecy ain't coming it's here now it's Among Us now it's happening in real time brother brandham says and here I think maybe it's my uh one of my last quotes it's it's short watch brother Brenham comes in what is the attraction on the Mountain Junior Jackson listening in you remember the dream he had that I interpreted going towards the setting of the Sun and this happened sunset Mountain it's the evening time sunset time the sunset message through a setting of history now watch Brother Brad um he'll come he'll he'll Circle back and and amend his statement see because the takeoff is on Sunset Mountain so it's a it's a it's it's it's that like an sww it happened on Sunset mountain and brother brandham says it's sunset time the sunset message through a setting of history and he amends it a setting of Prophecy rather being fulfilled see and he goes on all right all right so now let let let me let me stop there want to explain something okay you good so he says Deb tell him he can preach later not right now so so brother brandham is coming now and I'm I'm just trying to my notes and just just give you my heart so he says it's a setting of history now he didn't say a settling of History the holy spirit's very specific it's a setting so for instance you come to my house and there's a table and there's food and there's a sink and there's a stove what's that setting it's my kitchen you go into my living room you won't find a stove you won't find a setting food in there you'll find chairs and recliners and rockers and swivel chairs and rugs and picturers and coffee table that's a living room you can go into my bedroom there's a bed there's a dresser you know and you go to my bathroom and you have sinks you have shower you have toilet you have all these that's the setting so he he so he's coming back to say he's coming back to say oh it's a setting of history no wait because what happened on Sunset mountain is not a setting of History it's a setting of Prophecy now now just go back to acts two because that's what Peter is trying to get them to do Joel you remember Joel yeah this is a setting of Prophecy he's not in other words what he's not saying is this is a a settling or an accomplishing or a it's not a one-off it's not a oneand done it's not a settling of history or settling of anything it's not even a setting of History because it's right now and it's not just history it's prophecy because it's to you and to your children and to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call whenever the Holy Ghost comes it's going to act just like this it's a setting of Prophecy it's unwinding and unwinding and unwinding and it's going to unwind for 2,000 years but know this that when the restoration of the word comes we're going to go back to that same experience you say what was the experience power came into the people's lives Faith to be an overcomer for the age the word became flesh so what happened on Sunset mountain in the cor not of farest 30 miles north of Tucson a setting of Prophecy a setting of Prophecy in the evening time it shall be light the light doesn't end when a prophet leaves the light travels on to that new day oh Hallelujah friends that's where exactly where we're at the promise is unto you see so again it's God doing the unexpected in an unexplainable way but it took the Holy Ghost to explain it to those Jews it took the Holy Ghost through Peter to explain it to them in a way I mean he calls them murderers amen that's pretty tough and nobody gets mared you can't hardly say anything today you you can't even Brother JD and I get it I've I've had the same thing happen you try to get in the pull pit and you try to take a stand on the word of God and and teenagers and adults are so brainwashed by the poison of the world they can't even come back and go wait a minute this is biblical standards for men and women this is the proper place of a woman this proper oh he's misogynistic what what happened to the old standards of the word I'm here to tell you whether you believe them or not whether you've been in Ed by leoda the word of God stands Eternal and there's a place for a man and a place for a woman and a place in a home and a way of marriage is supposed to work and a way that fathers are supposed to be the high priest of the home and and and here a brother is just reading scriptures and he's quoting quotes and there's a kickback like oh we don't like that I'm here to tell you the Holy Spirit stood there on that day and preached to Peter and said not only are you murderers but you murdered the Prince of Life himself they didn't get mad it pricked their hearts they wanted we got to fix this what do we do here's the here's the prescription you got to repent and you got to be baptized in his name and that day there were added thousands to the church that's how you get in the church you're born into it amen see he's indicting them for murder murdering their own Messiah see but to those devout Jews they didn't get mad they wanted to fix it you see no matter no matter how hard the word comes to the elected amen it sounds like Freedom right to the elected it sounds like job when he said I know my redeemer liveth when you accept the word of this day that's what makes sense to to you of the word amen so I'm I'm coming this is my last point I promise this is my last one but I want to finish it so despite so let me let me Shore up now give me 60 seconds short up and I'm going to come to my last Point despite prophecies I'm reading back from the definitions and expectations surrounding the coming of the Messiah and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit Spirit Luke's use of the word suddenly in these verses suggests that there was still an element of surprise and unexpectedness when these events actually took place this could indicate that while people may have had some idea of what was coming they could not fully anticipate the timing or the manner in which these events would unfold it reminds us that God often Works in ways that are beyond our understanding and our expectations so even when we think we uh we know what's coming we can still be taken back by the suddenness and all inspiring nature of God you agree now here's here's my here's my last thing on my notes brother brandham comes to the world falling apart and he says so the whole world then was falling apart like it is today every nation was looking for someone to hold them out of this tragedy that was about to strike the world and trying to hold them together the nations were looking for something and each nation was looking for it but they looked like they didn't want to accept what God sent them see now talking about the Jews they were looking for a general they're looking for uh a political somebody with power to kick the Romans out and set them make them an autonomous Nation again amen see so so God sends him a baby all right now watch they didn't they they look like they didn't want to accept what God sent them they were asking for a man a messiah that would stomp out the rest of the Nations and God give them a baby asking for a general and got a baby God knowed what they had need of he humiliated them amen I want you to just think about that word for a minute he humiliated them that's the way God does he humiliates us when we think we know something like he said to Job you so got so much wisdom where was you when I laid the foundations of the world when the morning Stars sang together and sons of God shouted for Joy where was you job why his wisdom was done see God performed his wisdom in dealing with job dealing with job now we find out that the world wants their own Messiah Russia wants theirs United States wants theirs the church World wants theirs each one wants their own Messiah but they want it in a way that they can control it see they want to have see that's the same as saying I want to be a Christian but I don't want to be told what to do see they want to have control over this Messiah oh sure yeah if they if they could have see if God would send it in their own taste they certainly would accept it but you see then God knew their needs he's not promised to send us our wants and what we ask for but our needs they wanted a general they got a baby see that's what they needed everybody say that's what they needed that's what they needed they needed a baby what to hum humiliate them to Humble them that's what the self- style church needs today humble itself back again see now he's I I I switched to the world is again falling apart I didn't tell you we switched to a one they're about six months apart God to a place there is no confession and there's no love among the people it seems like it's a dying daily church is cooling off everywhere you find the Revival is over and you find a cooling off we need a humiliating amen amen we need what do we need yeah not asking you what you want I'm asking you what do you think you need see now it's interesting and that's my last of my PowerPoint you can take it down Brother Jay so I I want to make this statement to you as I'm coming to the Finish Line I want to say it like this the world humiliates Ates in a way vastly different from when God does it looking up the word humiliation and uh you know I I had to to go and and and and the and I'll just give you some sources the psychology of Burton uh Neil Burton the psychology of humiliation Walter Torres uh humiliation its nature and consequences was in the Journal of American uh Psychiatry um uh there some other words I can't even pronounce and so psych website Psychology today and they're they're dealing with the anatomy of humiliation at working different things like that so I just want you to know this is where this is coming from so so humiliation now because I've said to you the world thinks of it differently than God does I just read you a prophet talking about how God humiliated Israel see he gave them what they need not what they wanted humil is often used in a way to assert power control or dominance over another person the general purpose can vary but it typically includes regardless of the and it makes this footnote regardless of the intent humiliation often leads to significant emotional distress and can have longlasting effects on the person being humiliated amen the general purpose of I realize now I've got it twice is because it's from a different Source the general purpose of humiliating a person often revolves around exerting power and control over them humiliation is a deliberate act intended to make someone feel inferior ashamed or disgraced often in the presence of others it seeks to have power and control it seeks to they'll they'll use humiliation and punish ment and deterrence they'll use humiliation and social dynamics see so that it can be used to enforce Conformity and social norms see you you don't believe that wokeism but you're you don't want to stand out so you just kind of be quiet and look like you're going along with it see there's psychological impact the effects of humiliation can be profound and longlasting lead to feelings of worthlessness depression anxiety and even post-traumatic stress the psychological damage can be severe affecting the victim's sense of self-worth and identity there's retaliation and revenge sometimes humiliation is used as a means of retaliation the humiliator May seek to inflict emotional pain on someone as revenge for a perceived wrong this can perpetuate cycles of humiliation and conflict so you just start a cycle rolling and then they do the same thing to the next person and they do the same thing to the next person see overall overall while the intention behind humiliating someone can vary it is generally a destructive act that can have significant negative consequences for the victim both psychologically and socially so I thought to myself what a contrast to the way God humiliates and you say brother Jason how can you say such a thing because in my experience and I dare say the experience of every child of God when God took me down a notch or two and laid me flat on my back he did it so that I could look up and see the one whom my soul loves is that your experience amen he knocked Paul out of the saddle and Paul though blinded could still see that light and hear that voice and that's all that mattered the you know Paul got knocked out of the saddle said that's horrible that didn't matter compared to what happened he saw the light he heard a voice he got a he got a porn again experience that's all that matters oh can I tell you today don't let the world young people don't let the world socially pressure you into moving away from God's word don't let Styles and Fashions and you might have friends going that way try to get them to not go that way but don't you go that way because you weren't destined to die here in a tribulation God didn't take you down notches and humiliate you and he won't if he's going to humiliate you tomorrow it won't be out of Revenge it won't be vindictive he's not doing it to cause you PST PST or psychological he's doing it so you can look up and see the one you love and see the one who loves you oh my friends I don't know I I don't know your view what your view of God is today or perhaps you know maybe I don't know maybe someone's display of Christ to you was false maybe someone gave you a false narrative I don't know what you went through but but I but I know this Jesus has the answers Oh my he has the answers he he he's he can be your all in all he can tell you what life is all about he can he can settle all your fears he can remove all your anxieties he can give you a very reason and a purpose to live not to die but to live he settles all my fears settles all my anxieties oh let Satan go about like a roaring lion let him let him let the Heathen rage the Heathen will always rage let the world fall apart I'm here to tell you today brother Jason is here to look you all in the eye and tell you I feel protected under his wings I feel safe I feel secure I know the world is going crazy I I I but but I feel my I I just feel my own Wings my own Eagle wings Lifting me over the top of it I'm just flying right over it how about you today friends he's not come to like the world to humiliate you or socially pressure you or get V uh revenge on you or give you PTSD that's not why he comes H trials don't even come to hinder your faith they come to grow your faith don't let that trial H you say how how can I prevent it I'm in pain understand that the love of God might be behind it no child getting a spanking would call that a joyous event but I can tell you I'm glad for every one of them I ever got because they made me into the kind of character that I am oh do you believe that friends this is the presence of Shalom Among Us Tony bring your team this is the presence stand with me this is the presence of Shalom among us this is the Capstone Ministry time amen amen this is the capping of the pyramid this is the homegoing time of the Bride listen I I I know about sometimes the the dullness we can feel at times yeah I I'm aware of that we all have those times in our lives we all have those valleys and those mountain tops can you just remember that every Valley is bookended by mountaintops that's what makes it a valley so just keep going forward because I promise it wouldn't be a valley if there wasn't a mountain ahead and every mountain is bookended by valleys so that you're going to have mountain tops you're going to go through a valley but you're going home you're marching to Zion one of these days friends we're going to crush that last one one of these days we're going to be like Enoch and we're going to get so high up to top of that mountain and suddenly the Lord's going to say you're closer you're closer to Heaven than you are no need for another Valley come on higher oh hallelujah it's such a place of insanity the World drains us of our spiritual energy doesn't it brother brandham said it's a world we don't seem fitted to live in I I have such an affinity with that statement when a prophet says the world it it seems like we're not fitted like I'm not built for this you're not wrong you weren't Built For This you're built for a Garden of Eden you're the family of God I I know it's a place of insanity and you fought hard to stay up you know and uh and sometimes I you know if you're like me you can you you can feel more behind than you feel up but I'm here to tell you God can suddenly rush in let me just assure you God can suddenly rush in Bow your heads with me sometimes we've prayed a long time for lost loved ones sometimes we've Satan has had them for a long time could I say to you today but suddenly Hallelujah I know maybe you've been sick for a long time but suddenly prise I know the world can seem wearing I know it can drain us of our energy can can sap us of our spiritual fortitude ude but one of these mornings suddenly suddenly friends one of these mornings take courage today because suddenly the one whom you expect will suddenly come to his Temple father we love you today we thank you for this word we thank you for these people I thank you for the promise that's in your word today Lord I I want to be a part of that I want to be identified with that Lord sometimes you come and and and you do unexplainable things you come in unexpected ways and you do unexplainable things and I cannot account for everything that's happened in my life sometimes I don't know what to make of it sometimes I get in trial sometimes people get in trial they call me up they want prayer I don't even know what to make of it it seems so off-kilter it just seems so would would God actually do that but Lord you do all things well and even sometimes it's not necessarily that you did something but rather that you allowed something but I know this Lord I know this for sure one of these mornings suddenly one of these mornings I'll turn around and suddenly I'll be changed suddenly my loved ones will stand in my living room they're not dead they're is a next life there job knew that that was the question that plagued job it plagues all Humanity that does not have this Faith abiding in their hearts if a man die shall he live again if I go to church will I make it to Heaven if I read my Bible will God have favor on me if I do good deeds could I could I possibly earn my way these are questions Lord that people have strong believers who believe the word who believe it for real lord who love you with all their heart who love this word who who loathe their weaknesses and loathe their mistakes but yet the world so filled with drainage and and it just pulls it out of us and we have to constantly press and strain and press and strain father we dare not miss a service we dare not miss our prayer life we dare not miss opening our Bible we dare not Miss Fellowship of the saints of God we dare not apply the token I dare not apply the token over our homes Lord this is an age of insanity and it's pulling even hard at God's people we seem unfitted but suddenly what are these mornings suddenly oh god oh I look forward to it Lord I don't know if people here are weary maybe they've got sickness they fought a long time but suddenly maybe they've got children in the world but suddenly Lord you can suddenly come in in an unexpect Ed way and do something that is completely unexplainable I pray today that that'll be the result of this sermon I've went long the people have been patient but Lord it was on my heart you wouldn't allow me to stop I've told them time and time again I always seek to get permission can I stop every time I tried to stop you said keep going keep going I don't know maybe it's the last time someone will hear my voice but Lord may you come today maybe May to to prevent that from happening maybe somebody maybe some teenager maybe in this building maybe on the Internet is is is about to make a fatal decision may it not be so Lord may my words today echo down through the Canyons of their soul may they look up to you and say Lord God have mercy on me oh Lamb of God may it be so today Lord You've you've set my heart on fire with this sermon I just said I I because I so identify with it I identify with the struggle I but yet I identify with my love for your word but yet I identify with the weariness but yet I identify with my faith yet I identify with the influence of the world but I also identify with the truth of this hour it seems like Madness Lord but oh God I know you have a plan I know you have a purpose I know you're finding that last seed give us courage Jesus give us courage Lord fill up our hearts oh God let today be a fresh filling of our tank let today be a a an outpouring a sudden outpouring of the Holy Spirit may you grant it to us Lord one and all young and old male and female married and single Lord may you grant it to us I pray we don't know there's so much we don't know we don't know how much longer we'll be here we don't we can't know we don't know we we know generally I I know we're not going into tribulation but Lord it seems to be nipping at our heels we know that the man of sin is being revealed but we also know that we we he can't be fully until we're gone we must be close we must be close the prophet's been gone the bride is now grown she's she's receiving her Capstone Ministry she's ready for a flight to the sky eyes encourage our hearts Lord whatever is left let it be so in our hearts and our minds that we'll say Lord God whatever remains I want to be found running the [Music] race whatever lies ahead I want to be found running this race father and if I should stumble tomorrow I will not quit I will never quit I Will Never Surrender amen I will fight him at church I'll fight him in my home I'll fight him in my vehicle I'll fight him at at family dinners I'll fight him at Fellowship dinners I'll fight him in Walmart I'll fight him everywhere I go I will not surrender me or my family my loved ones this church we're not leaving anyone behind Lord we're claiming every promise we're looking for a fresh refilling of the Holy Spirit we're looking for the Dynamics of this church to be a refilling of the Holy Ghost may maybe it'll come in an unexpected way and at an unexpected time and it'll be almost unexplainable but we'll know it's you grant it to us Lord help us let there be Revival father let there be Revival from here to Yan oh God across the world let there be that one last surge to get us to the cross the finish line Lord may it be so we love you today we thank you
