[25:39] a request." Um it's concerning her her
[25:42] daughter Olivia in her car. She's in at
[25:45] school and she says um I know God is
[25:48] able to do all things. I love I love
[25:52] that. You know, Paul said, "First, I
[25:54] thank my God." I love to see a request
[25:57] start out with a praise.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I have another request. I know God
[26:01] is able to do all things exceedingly
[26:04] abundantly above all we can think uh all
[26:07] we can we we can ask for or even think
[26:12] for [clears throat] my daughter Olivia's
[26:14] car which is in need of a full engine
[26:17] replacement at no cost to her through a
[26:20] call back I guess there's some kind of a
[26:22] call back that Kia has offered but you
[26:24] have to qualify uh praying that God let
[26:27] her car meet all the requirements amen
[26:30] to have her engine replaced with no
[26:32] out-ofpocket. I mean, this is ex this is
[26:34] express this is explicit. No out of out
[26:37] of pocket expense. Amen. I've had that
[26:40] happen before. I had a bought a car for
[26:42] Sister Sweetheart one time and the U
[26:45] engine was bad in it and the factory
[26:47] they I just prayed. I've had that happen
[26:49] so many times over vehicles and they
[26:52] literally uh Infiniti in Japan
[26:56] off the assembly line, put it in a crate
[26:58] and sent it and they [laughter]
[26:59] installed it. didn't cost me a dime.
[27:01] Amen. So I know this can happen. Amen.
[27:04] Praise the Lord. Um so it says with no
[27:07] outofpocket expense to her. This is her
[27:10] only source of transportation at Cornell
[27:12] where she's at university there in
[27:14] Ithaca, New York. Uh so this is an
[27:16] urgent request um sister Elizabeth is
[27:19] asking for. So please have the saints
[27:21] agree and lift this request up before
[27:24] the Lord. How many are going to agree?
[27:26] Amen. Brother uh Caleb and brother Uriah

[27:55] right about now uh headed home and uh he
[27:58] had some very successful meetings. I
[28:00] don't know if we were able to get the

[28:11] there many times. Amen. When you're
[28:13] abroad like that and you're just you've
[28:14] preached multiple days and probably
[28:17] driven more hours than you've preached
[28:18] and uh so we're just uh thankful. I want
[28:21] him to come home and give us a full
[28:23] report. Amen. All right, we'll catch
[28:25] these prayer requests
[28:28] after we read our our script, our text.
[28:31] Mark 12
[28:34] and uh let's begin at verse 28.
[28:44] And one of the scribes came, and having
[28:47] heard them reasoning together, and
[28:50] perceiving that he had answered them
[28:52] well, where Jesus had kind of put the
[28:54] Pharisees to silence. He had answered
[28:57] them well, asked him, "Which is the
[28:59] first commandment of all?"
[29:03] And Jesus answered him, "The first of
[29:06] all the commandments is here. O Israel,
[29:09] the Lord our God is one Lord. And thou
[29:13] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[29:17] heart and with all thy soul, and with
[29:21] all thy mind, and with all thy strength.
[29:25] This is the first commandment."
[29:29] Let's [clears throat] pray.
[29:32] Father, we thank you for your word that
[29:34] has been read here this morning.
[29:37] Father, there's much on my heart to say
[29:40] this morning and more than can be said.
[29:42] And so I've tried very carefully to put
[29:47] together, Lord, what I believe we can
[29:49] effectively say today. And for the
[29:52] remainder, we will put it to a different
[29:55] installment. But Lord, that's always
[29:57] subject to change. Even Even live even
[29:59] live in the pull pit. I'm always ready
[30:02] to hear you, Lord, in a moment. Take me
[30:05] in any direction that you choose. I'm
[30:07] just your servant. I'm just your
[30:08] assistant. That's it. That's all I am.
[30:11] You're the preacher today, Lord. I They
[30:14] They sing. They invite a minister to
[30:16] come. All I've did is walk out here with
[30:18] you, Lord, just to stand here and assist
[30:21] you to feed your people. Now, pass me
[30:24] not, oh gentle Savior. While on others
[30:26] thou art calling, do not pass me by,
[30:28] Lord. So I pray today that you will help
[30:31] us be our helper, Lord. Start to finish.
[30:35] Commit my heart and mind to you now.
[30:37] Lord, in spite of all the enemy can try
[30:40] to do, the word is victorious. And I'm
[30:42] grateful for that today. Now we commit
[30:45] this audience, visible and invisible.
[30:48] And Lord, we have a number of prayer
[30:51] requests. You heard them read out the
[30:53] Lord for our sister Olivia there in
[30:55] school with a card needing this thing to
[30:57] happen, Lord. And we're we're taught to
[31:00] ask big things. So, we're just going to
[31:02] ask big. May it be so, Lord, that
[31:04] whoever will make that decision will be
[31:06] favorable toward our sister, Lord, and
[31:09] at no expense to her, may this be
[31:12] granted to her. Father, we pray for our
[31:15] sick and afflicted brother Caleb,
[31:17] brother Uriah, Sister Caitlyn, Sister
[31:19] Luna, Lord, Sister Pam Kronhite facing
[31:23] this uh procedure. Master, be merciful.
[31:26] I pray your great hand of mercy be upon
[31:29] them today. We're continuing to pray for
[31:32] others, Lord, with continuing the enemy
[31:34] continuing to battle. I think of Sister
[31:36] Deborah Lowry. Lord, the enemy just
[31:38] battling her so hard with her lower
[31:40] back. And I'm asking for your mercy
[31:42] today for our sister. Lord, be with your
[31:45] servant, Brother Brad, as he comes home.
[31:47] Come bring him back to us safely, Lord.
[31:50] Uh revive him and give him strength now,
[31:53] Lord. May for weeks and and days and
[31:56] weeks and months to come, may the word
[31:59] that went forth to those young people,
[32:01] Lord, may it just reverberate through
[32:03] the canyons of their soul, Lord. May it
[32:05] give them strength, oh God, to face the
[32:07] enemy in [clears throat] the place where
[32:09] you have placed them, Lord. May it be
[32:11] so. Now, help us today, Lord, as we
[32:14] fight the same battles. And we're asking
[32:16] for your help now. Instruct us in your
[32:19] word. We commit it to you in Jesus name.
[32:21] Amen. God bless you. You can be seated.
[32:39] Yes, sir. Okay. Sorry, I just now saw
[32:41] that. Um,
[32:44] yeah, I knew about Sister Meredith. I
[32:46] didn't know [clears throat] if she would
[32:47] make it today or not. Homesick, just
[32:50] that time of year. uh the enemy
[32:52] battling, but I was uh Sister Caitlyn
[32:55] sent me that request this morning and
[32:57] and [clears throat] you know, it's just
[32:58] that time of year. But any time of the
[33:01] year, the devil still ain't nobody.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Doesn't matter what time of the
[33:05] year it is, he he don't make decisions
[33:08] on uh about us. All decisions about my
[33:11] life are between me and my father. Amen.
[33:14] He will make those decisions for my
[33:16] life. Amen. brother um Travis, Sister
[33:18] Deb, Brother Donald, Sister Lane in
[33:20] route to Greenville for um a family
[33:23] member. There's a funeral there and
[33:25] they're asking for traveling mercies.
[33:27] May the Lord grant that to them today.
[33:29] Amen. Now, I want to continue reading uh
[33:33] if we'll come back to our scripture on
[33:35] the overhead. And if you have your
[33:37] Bibles, want to carry on reading from
[33:40] verse 31.
[33:42] And I will um just begin and I'll read
[33:45] verse 30 again, please, brother Mark.
[33:48] And thou shalt, because this is the
[33:49] first commandment. Thou shalt love the
[33:52] Lord thy God with all thy heart. I want
[33:56] you to know notice how explicit this is.
[33:59] This is separating into into important
[34:02] categories. It's not just go forth and
[34:05] love God. It's more specific than that.
[34:09] I I remember um recently I I almost
[34:13] started to hunt for it. I could have
[34:14] found it and or created my own even and
[34:17] put it up on the screen. Somebody did it
[34:18] using an LLM, I'm sure. And it it had
[34:23] two pathways. One was a lower. It was
[34:26] very broad. Speaking of the scripture,
[34:28] broad is the way uh that leadth to
[34:31] destruction. And there were millions of
[34:34] people walking in it. And they were
[34:36] walking under a banner. You're driving
[34:38] down an interstate. You'll run under a
[34:39] sign that says, you know, diversion or
[34:41] traffic ahead or whatever, slow down or
[34:43] whatever. And the sign flashing over
[34:46] this throng of people said, "We believe
[34:50] in God." And then there was a higher
[34:53] road that was narrow and there was only
[34:54] a few travelers and the banner said, "We
[34:57] obey God."
[34:59] &gt;&gt; And there's a big difference between
[35:00] believing in God and obeying God.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; So it's [clears throat] not just, you
[35:05] know, that you say, "I love God." People
[35:08] say, you know, I I love I I love Jesus.
[35:11] To which I'm always asking them to
[35:14] clarify that, you know, qualify what you
[35:16] just said. You love Jesus. Now, there's
[35:18] there's there's there there's many
[35:20] people in the world with the name Jesus.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; And it's pronounced differently in
[35:27] various languages. But, you know,
[35:29] Brother Brandham said there's only one
[35:30] Lord, Jesus Christ. So, is he your Lord?
[35:34] Because if he's your Lord, then he's
[35:35] Lord of everything. See, and so they
[35:38] say, "Well, I yes, I love the Lord Jesus
[35:40] Christ." You know, the one in the Bible,
[35:42] yes, the one in the Bible. Well, in the
[35:44] Bible, there was two two Jesuses. There
[35:47] was an original one, and there was
[35:49] another one that's man-made. Now, tell
[35:51] me which one you which one you really
[35:53] love. Well, how do I know the
[35:55] difference? Well, one is the same
[35:57] yesterday, today, and forever, and will
[35:58] never change his mind about his word.
[36:00] The other changes all kinds of things
[36:02] about his word and limits its faith in
[36:05] God. And that is a man-made a man-made
[36:08] system of organized religion. I I love
[36:12] the Jesus of this book.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; I I love his life. I love his holiness.
[36:19] I love his cleanness. I love his purity.
[36:23] I love everything about it. And I love
[36:25] it so much that it causes me to disdain
[36:30] the filth and muck and sin and mire of
[36:34] the world. I'm trying to rescue all the
[36:36] people I can out of it. But I have no
[36:40] love for this world. AND I'M GLAD I
[36:42] DON'T BECAUSE JESUS WARNED THAT IF YOU
[36:44] LOVE THIS world and the things of the
[36:46] world of the world, then it's an obvious
[36:48] sign the love of God, the new birth is
[36:51] not in you. WELL, HOW, BROTHER JASON,
[36:54] HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU have the Holy Ghost?
[36:56] Did you shake? Did you tremble? Did you
[36:58] run? Did you shout? Did you speak in
[37:00] tongues? Listen, BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS
[37:02] ABOUT uh Apollos and those that were
[37:05] following him. And brother and brother
[37:07] Brandham SAYS THEY WERE HAVING GREAT
[37:09] REVIVAL MEETINGS AND SHOUTING AND THEY
[37:11] WEREN'T EVEN BORN AGAIN. THEY DIDN'T
[37:13] EVEN HAVE THE HOLY GHOST AT THAT TIME.
[37:15] AND YET THEY'RE SHOUTING AND REJOICING
[37:17] AND PREACHING. SEE? And so AND SO WHEN
[37:20] PAUL SAID, "WELL, HAVE YOU RECEIVED THE
[37:22] Holy Ghost SINCE YOU BELIEVED?" WELL, I
[37:23] DIDN'T KNOW. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
[37:25] HOW WERE YOU BAPTIZED UNTO JOHN? WELL,
[37:27] OKAY, that explains it. You've got to
[37:29] move on. You've got to not just have a
[37:32] belief in him somewhere in the misty
[37:34] blue or historical way BACK YEARS AGO,
[37:37] BUT YOU NEED TO HAVE A FELLOWSHIP
[37:38] BECAUSE HE'S a mystery. And the Bible
[37:41] says that this mystery, IT'S NOT A
[37:43] DOCTRINE. THIS MYSTERY WANTS TO HAVE
[37:46] FELLOWSHIP with you.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; So, it's a person
[37:50] &gt;&gt; of the word. And so, WE SAY, "HOW DO YOU
[37:54] KNOW?" BECAUSE SAY, "DID YOU DO THIS?
[37:56] Did you do that? Did you have this sign?
[37:58] YOU OF THAT SIGN HERE. HERE'S WHAT I CAN
[38:00] SAY TO YOU FRIENDS. AT ANY TIME OVER THE
[38:03] MANY YEARS OF MY LIFE SERVING THE LORD,
[38:06] I'VE HAD ALL KINDS OF THOSE EXPERIENCES.
[38:08] BUT HERE'S HOW I KNOW THAT I HAVE PASSED
[38:11] FROM DEATH TO LIFE. I HAVE NO MORE LOVE
[38:14] for this world or the things of this
[38:17] world. I love him. I LOVE HOLINESS. I
[38:20] LOVE RIGHTEOUSNESS. I LOVE THE TRUTH,
[38:23] THE WHOLE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT THE
[38:27] TRUTH.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; No matter what it says to me,
[38:31] &gt;&gt; what it challenges me
[38:34] &gt;&gt; what it tells me to get rid of, lay
[38:36] aside. I just say, LORD, YOU SAY, "WELL,
[38:39] YEAH, I I I FEEL THAT WAY, BROTHER
[38:41] JASON, BUT SOMETIMES I STRUGGLE."
[38:43] SOMETIMES SO DO I. SO, I SAY, "LORD, I
[38:45] BELIEVE. HELP THOU MY UNBELIEF." HOW
[38:48] MANY WANT HIM TO HELP YOUR AREAS OF
[38:50] UNBELIEF TODAY? HE WILL. I'M HERE TO
[38:52] TELL YOU THAT'S WHAT PREACHING DOES. IT
[38:54] HELPS YOU. It strengthens you.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; SO HE COMES TO THIS FIRST COMMANDMENT.
[39:02] VERSE 30. THOU SHALT LOVE the Lord thy
[39:05] God with all thy heart and with all thy
[39:10] soul and with all thy mind.
[39:14] NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE'RE
[39:16] TALKING ABOUT THE GREATEST battle ever
[39:18] fought. This is demonology in the
[39:21] spiritual realm, in the realm of your
[39:24] spirit, where your mind is. And so, this
[39:27] is where the enemy, this is, remember
[39:30] that here, here's a good point. I'm
[39:32] getting ahead of myself in my notes, but
[39:34] I just feel led to say it now that when
[39:37] when the serpent BEING POSSESSED BY
[39:41] Satan came to Eve, he did not come,
[39:46] isn't it? This is important. HE DID NOT
[39:49] COME WITH VIOLENCE.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; He came with a question.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; See,
[39:58] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T HE DIDN'T ATTACK HER? HE
[40:00] DIDN'T THROW HER DOWN AND RAVISH HER. HE
[40:03] CAME WITH A question from the Bible.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Hath God said such and such and such and
[40:10] such? And Eve made her first mistake.
[40:12] She stopped to listen.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's our first mistake. You say,
[40:17] "Oh, I'm I'm going to I'm going to PROVE
[40:19] TO THE DEVIL." DON'T PROVE NOTHING TO
[40:20] HIM. YOU GOT NOTHING TO PROVE TO HIM. I
[40:23] I'm GOING TO JUST TELL HIM WHAT I DON'T
[40:25] TELL HIM ANYTHING. DON'T THINK ABOUT
[40:26] HIM. UH JUST CONFESS. SAY, "GREATER IS
[40:29] HE THAT IS IN ME THAN HE THAT IS IN THE
[40:30] WORLD." JESUS didn't argue WITH SATAN.
[40:35] JESUS DIDN'T PLAY THE MIND GAMES. SATAN
[40:38] TRIED, IF YOU NOTICE, SATAN TRIED TO
[40:41] COME TO JESUS in the wilderness IN THE
[40:43] SAME WAY HE came to Eve. If thou be the
[40:47] son of God,
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't argue with him. He didn't
[40:52] he didn't he didn't engage him. He just
[40:54] quoted him the word and moved on. And
[40:56] Satan came at him again. You know, the
[40:59] Bible says this, "Well, how about you do
[41:00] this?" Jesus didn't argue with him. He
[41:02] just simply quoted him the word and
[41:04] moved on. AND WHEN SATAN FINALLY COME
[41:07] ALL THIS WILL I GIVE YOU. Jesus doesn't
[41:09] argue. Brother Brandham SAID SATAN IT
[41:11] SATAN WAS HE HE CONTROLLED IT ALL. HE
[41:14] SAYS BUT JESUS STANDING there knew it.
[41:16] He saw all THE KINGDOMS.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; JESUS STANDING THERE SAW YOU AND I IN
[41:21] THE AGE THAT WE'RE LIVING IN. AND SATAN
[41:24] SAID, "I'LL GIVE IT ALL TO YOU IF YOU
[41:26] WORSHIP ME." BUT JESUS KNEW THAT HE
[41:28] WOULD ALREADY GET YOU BECAUSE YOU WOULD
[41:29] LOVE HIM AND YOU WOULD BELIEVE HIM NO
[41:31] MATTER WHAT THE AGE HAPPENED. NO MATTER
[41:32] HOW DARK IT GOT, THERE WOULD BE A PEOPLE
[41:34] WHO WOULD SAY, "I LOVE [screaming] THE
[41:36] LORD."
[41:38] &gt;&gt; GOD,
[41:38] &gt;&gt; AND I DO NOT LOVE THIS WORLD. AND I
[41:42] LOATHE ANY WEAKNESS OR FAILURE OR
[41:45] SLIPPAGE IN MY LIFE. I DON'T WAKE I WAKE
[41:47] UP EVERY MORNING DETERMINED TO GO TO BED
[41:50] THAT NIGHT WITH A CLEAN RECORD, WITH A
[41:52] PERFECT PERFECT WALK BEFORE THE LORD. DO
[41:55] YOU ALWAYS SUCCEED? I DO NOT. BUT I GO
[41:57] TO SLEEP EVERY NIGHT THANKING HIM FOR
[42:00] LIFE. I AND REPENTING AND WAKING UP
[42:02] THANKING HIM AND CLEANSING MY HEART AND
[42:05] SAYING, "LORD, NOW HOW CAN I SERVE YOU
[42:07] TODAY?"
[42:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; THOU SHALT LOVE THE LORD. I'M JUST
[42:15] HANGING ON THIS VERSE BECAUSE IT'S so
[42:17] important.
[42:18] [sighs]
[42:19] We're speaking about the battle of the
[42:21] mind. And I don't I don't understand the
[42:25] argument. I don't get the argument.
[42:27] IT'S REALLY NOT AN ARGUMENT.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; YEAH. I DON'T YOU KNOW THERE THERE SEEMS
[42:32] TO BE SOMEHOW
[42:35] IN SPITE OF ALL OF THE HUNDREDS AND
[42:37] HUNDREDS OF QUOTES FROM BROTHER BRANDHAM
[42:40] DEALING WITH THE BATTLES OF THE MIND
[42:42] &gt;&gt; THAT SOMEHOW WHEN A YOU START TO PREACH
[42:45] ALONG THOSE THINGS EVEN READING THE
[42:46] QUOTES YOU GET ACCUSED OF CHRISTIAN
[42:49] PSYCHOLOGY
[42:50] &gt;&gt; WAIT WHAT I'M JUST READING WHAT A
[42:53] PROPHET SAID I'M JUST READING BIBLE
[42:56] VERSES WHAT ABOUT WHAT PAUL SAID ABOUT
[42:58] HOW WE DAILY NUTS AND BOLTS HOW WE DAILY
[43:01] OVERCOME HIM.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, YOU JUST NEED TO BE BORN
[43:04] AGAIN OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD." NO KIDDING.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; YOU THINK,
[43:09] &gt;&gt; OF COURSE, THIS LISTEN, WE'RE IN THE
[43:12] FIFTH INSTALLMENT TODAY. BY THIS TIME,
[43:15] I'M WAY DOWNSTREAM ASSUMING THAT I'M
[43:17] TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE PASSED FROM
[43:19] DEATH TO LIFE
[43:20] &gt;&gt; BY THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. PAUL
[43:23] WAS WRITING AND SPEAKING TO PEOPLE BORN
[43:26] AGAIN OF THE SPIRIT SAYING, "STAND FIRM.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; PUT ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD. CAST DOWN
[43:32] VAIN IMAGINATIONS." WHY WOULD HE HAVE TO
[43:33] SAY THAT IF ALL IF ALL YOU HAD TO DO IS
[43:35] GET BORN AGAIN AND YOU DON'T NEED TO DO
[43:37] NOTHING ELSE? THAT'S NOT PRACTICAL
[43:40] CHRISTIANITY.
[43:42] BECAUSE THE DEVIL IS NOT GOING TO LEAVE
[43:43] YOU ALONE JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE BORN
[43:45] AGAIN. IN FACT, IS you become a target.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, I DON'T GET THAT THAT THAT
[43:51] WHOLE I DON'T EVEN GET IT. I don't even
[43:54] want to I didn't want to go down because
[43:56] it it it's maddening to me how that
[43:58] anybody could even let that be a
[43:59] discussion. So, I don't want to stand
[44:01] here and discuss it and defend ONE SIDE
[44:03] OR THE OTHER. I'M JUST GLAD THAT IT MY
[44:05] BIBLE IS FULL OF WAYS TO HELP ME be
[44:07] victorious.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; And and AND IT TELLS ME HOW TO GET BORN
[44:11] AGAIN. AND I DID AND IT WORKED AND I AM
[44:14] &gt;&gt; AND IT TELLS ME HOW TO DEFEAT HIM. AND I
[44:16] DO AND IT WORKS AND HERE I STAND. AMEN.
[44:19] SEE,
[44:19] &gt;&gt; so that's why I WAS SAYING TO YOU LAST
[44:21] TIME, WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT, THE NEW
[44:23] BIRTH OR PRACTICAL STEPS TO DAILY
[44:26] TRANSFORMATION AND STRENGTHENING in in
[44:28] IN THE FAITH? WELL, THEY'RE THEY'RE
[44:30] BOTH. AND I MEAN, WHICH ONE WOULD BE
[44:33] MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU? CHRIST PURCHASING
[44:35] WORK AT CALVARY OR HIS REDEEMING WORK UH
[44:38] OPENING THE SEVEN SEALS? HIS CLAIMING
[44:40] WORK OPENING THE SEVEN SEALS. IF IF THIS
[44:42] ONE HAPPENS AND THIS ONE DOESN'T, THIS
[44:44] ONE IS FOR NOT. IF THIS ONE DOESN'T
[44:47] HAPPEN, THIS ONE WILL NEVER HAPPEN. SO,
[44:49] YOU TELL ME WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT. YOU
[44:51] TELL ME WHICH IS WHY I I KNOW THAT I
[44:53] MUST PASS FROM DEATH TO LIFE. I KNOW
[44:55] THAT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S NOT
[44:58] YOU'RE BORN AGAIN NOW. GO DOWN ON THE
[45:00] DOCK AND WAIT ON THE OLD SHIP OF ZION
[45:02] AND SIT ON YOUR LUGGAGE. OR YOU'RE BORN
[45:04] AGAIN NOW. I'LL SEE YOU IN HEAVEN. I'M
[45:06] I'VE GOT TO FIGHT IF I MUST WIN. WE'RE
[45:09] AN ARMY. THIS IS WAR. AND I DON'T PLAN
[45:12] TO LOSE IT. AMEN.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; I don't want to see you lose.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; I don't want to see your children lose.
[45:17] I DON'T WANT TO SEE OUR TEENAGERS
[45:19] DRUGGED THROUGH THE drug through the
[45:21] muck and mire of the world TO GET
[45:23] WOUNDED, SCARRED, FILTH UP, AND THEN
[45:26] FINALLY THE LORD BRING THEM TO THEIR
[45:28] SENSES AND THEY COME BACK AND REPENT AND
[45:30] THEN THEY'RE FULL OF THE HOLY GHOST. I'D
[45:32] RATHER SEE THEM NOT HAVE TO GO DOWN THAT
[45:34] PATH.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; I'D RATHER SEE THEM FULL OF THE HOLY
[45:38] GHOST RIGHT NOW.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY PATH TO
[45:42] ETERNAL LIFE. THERE'S NO OTHER PATH.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Either you're born again OF THE SPIRIT
[45:46] OF GOD OR YOU'RE not only THOSE BORN
[45:49] ONLY BECAUSE ONLY THE PART OF YOU HAVE
[45:52] TO BE IN THE FIRST RESURRECTION AND THE
[45:53] ONLY WAY TO BE IN PART OF THE FIRST
[45:55] RESURRECTION IS TO BE BORN AGAIN of the
[45:56] spirit of God.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; See, because then it's not your life,
[45:58] it's Jesus life. Since he has already
[46:01] raised from the dead, then then that
[46:03] that SAME SPIRIT THAT QUICKENED HIS, IF
[46:06] IT DWELL IN YOU, WILL ALSO QUICKEN YOUR
[46:08] MORTAL body
[46:09] &gt;&gt; because you're PART OF THAT FIRST
[46:11] RESURRECTION. Does that make sense?
[46:13] &gt;&gt; I got to get off this verse.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; But I promised the Lord I would go as I
[46:18] feel led.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:21] So
[46:23] [snorts] thou shalt love the Lord thy
[46:24] God WITH ALL THY HEART, and with all thy
[46:27] soul, and with all thy mind, AND WITH
[46:30] ALL THY STRENGTH. THIS is the FIRST
[46:33] COMMANDMENT. VERSE 31. AND THE SECOND IS
[46:35] LIKE, NAMELY THIS, THOU SHALT LOVE THY
[46:37] NEIGHBOR AS THYSELF. There is none other
[46:39] comm none other commandment greater than
[46:42] these. AND THE SCRIBES SAID UNTO HIM,
[46:46] "WELL, MASTER, thou hast said the truth,
[46:50] for there is one God, and there is none
[46:53] other but he." And to love him with all
[46:56] the heart and with all the understanding
[47:00] and with all the soul and with all THE
[47:04] STRENGTH. SEE, SO you're So now he's
[47:06] replacing mind WITH UNDERSTANDING
[47:09] BECAUSE THEY'RE THE same thing. YOUR
[47:11] YOUR SPIRIT IS WHERE YOUR MEMORY,
[47:14] CONSCIENCE, REASON, AFFECTION, and
[47:15] imagination are.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; You understand? As a man thinkketh in
[47:19] his heart, so is he.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; So you you understand? So So it's your
[47:24] it's your UNDERSTANDING OF WHO HE IS,
[47:27] WHAT THIS IS, WHO YOU ARE, HOW YOU
[47:30] BECOME PART OF THIS.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; SEE, and and THEN WHEN THE WORD COMES
[47:34] INTO YOUR LIFE AND YOU YOU SAY, "WELL, I
[47:38] LOVE GOD." BUT DO YOU LOVE ALL OF THE
[47:40] UNDERSTANDING?
[47:41] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE UNDERSTANDING THE WORD, IT
[47:44] DOESN'T TAKE YOU VERY LONG TO FIGURE
[47:46] OUT. YOU CAN'T KEEP GOING ACTING LIKE
[47:49] THE WORLD CLAIMING TO BE A CHRISTIAN
[47:52] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU'RE DENYING THE
[47:54] UNDERSTANDING. YOU'RE LOVING A
[47:55] HISTORICAL FIGURE, BUT YOU'RE DENYING
[47:57] THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORD THAT WHEN
[48:00] YOU'VE PASSED FROM DEATH TO LIFE, YOU
[48:01] BECOME A NEW CREATION. AMEN.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; SO, YOU'RE NOT AGREEING WITH THE WORD
[48:07] EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE LOVING THE HISTORICAL
[48:09] FIGURE.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; SEE, does that make sense?
[48:13] [clears throat]
[48:15] VERSE 33. AND TO LOVE HIM WITH all the
[48:18] heart and with all the understanding and
[48:21] with all the soul and with all the
[48:24] strength. So with ALL THE STRENGTH IS
[48:26] ALL OF YOUR MOTIVES, YOUR OBJECTIVES,
[48:28] your goals, your plans, your dreams,
[48:30] everything that you are, everything you
[48:32] ever want to be, your life, your career,
[48:34] YOUR YOUR MARRIAGE, YOUR EDUCATION, YOUR
[48:37] BUSINESS, YOUR FORTUNE, WHATEVER IT IS,
[48:40] ALL OF YOUR STRENGTH IS COMMITTED TO
[48:42] SERVING GOD WITHIN THOSE THINGS BECAUSE
[48:45] YOU CAN CERTAINLY SERVE GOD AND BE A
[48:47] SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS PERSON.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SERVE GOD AND AND GO TO
[48:51] UNIVERSITY. YOU CAN AND YOU CAN REMAIN A
[48:53] CHRISTIAN. SEE, AND AND SO IT'S WITH
[48:56] WITH EVERYTHING WITH EVERYTHING THAT I'M
[48:58] DOING IN LIFE. I'm loving HIM WITH ALL
[49:01] MY HEART, WITH ALL MY MIND, my
[49:04] understanding, WITH ALL MY SOUL, AND
[49:07] WITH ALL MY STRENGTH, AND TO LOVE HIS
[49:09] NEIGHBOR AS HIMSELF IS MORE THAN LISTEN,
[49:12] THIS IS MORE THAN ALL WHOLE BURNT
[49:15] OFFERINGS AND SACRIFICES.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:20] God would rather you
[49:23] never participate IN HELPING BUILD A
[49:27] CHURCH, AN ORPHANAGE, or a hospital, but
[49:30] that you'll SERVE HIM HUMBLY ALL YOUR
[49:32] LIFE RATHER THAN HAVE YOU BUILD A
[49:34] HUNDRED CHURCHES, HOSPITALS, AND
[49:36] ORPHANAGES AND NEVER REALLY GIVE HIM
[49:38] YOUR whole heart. Amen.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Those commandments ARE MORE THAN
[49:43] ANYTHING YOU CAN EVER ACCUMULATE and
[49:45] say, "I'VE DONE FOR GOD THIS AND I'VE
[49:47] done for God that and I did this and I
[49:49] GAVE THIS." MORE THAN ALL OF THOSE
[49:51] SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS, HE WANTS YOUR
[49:53] WHOLE HEART, YOUR WHOLE SOUL, YOUR WHOLE
[49:55] MIND, YOUR WHOLE UNDERSTANDING, YOUR
[49:57] WHOLE STRENGTH. HE WANTS EVERYTHING
[49:59] UNDER HIS CONTROL.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; That's why he placed you here. And when
[50:02] Jesus verse 34 saw that he answered
[50:06] discreetly, he said unto him, "Thou art
[50:09] not far from the kingdom of God." And no
[50:11] man after that d ask him many questions.
[50:16] Now I want to look at Acts chapter 4
[50:18] [clears throat]
[50:21] verse 23-31.
[50:23] This is the disciples having been
[50:25] released from jail. They got arrested
[50:28] for preaching the gospel and they
[50:30] threatened them and and and harassed
[50:32] them and threw them in in jail and then
[50:34] they they let him go and uh they even uh
[50:38] I believe that this is a part where they
[50:40] actually received some wounds and he in
[50:43] verse 23 and being let go they went to
[50:46] their own company and reported all that
[50:48] the chief priest and elders had said
[50:50] unto them. So they didn't they didn't go
[50:53] home. They didn't go to the hospital.
[50:55] They went straight to church.
[50:58] And when they when they when they heard
[51:00] that, see, they lifted up their voices
[51:04] to God with one accord and said, Lord,
[51:08] thou art God, which hath made heaven and
[51:11] earth, and the sea, and all that in them
[51:15] is, who by the mouth of thy servant
[51:18] David has said. Now this is the second
[51:21] psalm
[51:23] &gt;&gt; and when you go read the second psalm it
[51:24] doesn't say who wrote it but the
[51:26] disciples say it was David.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; So David in writing the second psalm is
[51:31] who what it's referring to. Who by THE
[51:33] MOUTH OF THY SERVANT David has said why
[51:36] did the heathen rage and the people
[51:38] imagine vain things? The kings of the
[51:40] earth stood up and the rulers were
[51:42] gathered together against the Lord and
[51:44] against his Christ. that the Lord and
[51:46] his Christ is the Lord and his bride,
[51:48] the Lord and his family, the Lord and
[51:50] his people, the Lord and his kingdom.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; It's Jesus and his kingdom.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. The kingdoms of this world will
[51:57] become the kingdoms of our Lord and his
[52:00] family,
[52:01] &gt;&gt; his bride, HIS PEOPLE, HIS NATION, HIS
[52:03] KINGDOM.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [snorts]
[52:06] forever truth
[52:09] against thy holy child Jesus whom thou
[52:12] hast anointed both Herod and Pontius
[52:14] Pilate with the Gentiles and the people
[52:16] of Israel were gathered together for to
[52:19] do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel
[52:21] determined before to be done. That's
[52:24] important because in everything that
[52:26] happens, just remember this. Everything
[52:30] that happens, even Satan's attacks on
[52:33] you, is never outside of God's
[52:36] sovereignty.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; God is in control.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; You understand? And if you if the devil
[52:45] attacks you and you stumble and then you
[52:48] REPENT AND YOU GET BACK UP AND GO AGAIN,
[52:52] THAT WAS IN GOD'S SOVEREIGNTY.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; NOW, EXPLAIN IT DEEPER, BROTHER JASON.
[52:57] IT'S GOD'S SOVEREIGNTY. THERE'S NOTHING
[53:00] MORE I CAN SAY TO YOU. I JUST KNOW THIS.
[53:02] THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE OF THE SONS OF THE
[53:04] FOOTSTEPS OF THE RIGHTEOUS ARE LED BY
[53:06] THE SPIRIT OF GOD.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? SO THEY'RE ORDERED OF
[53:10] THE LORD. I MEAN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE
[53:12] RIGHTEOUS ARE ORDERED OF THE LORD.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; SONS ARE LED BY THE SPIRIT. THIS IS IT
[53:16] IS ON UPON THAT BASIS ALONE AND NO OTHER
[53:18] SCRIPTURE THAT I CAN EVER FIND WHERE
[53:19] BROTHER BRANDHAM qualifies
[53:22] that uh that that UH JONAH DID NOT THAT
[53:27] THAT JONAH NEVER DISOBEYED GOD.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; WOW.
[53:33] I was like okay [laughter]
[53:36] well okay why DO YOU THINK HE DISOBEYED
[53:39] GOD? WELL, I CAN READ GOD TOLD HIM TO GO
[53:40] THIS way and he went this way and THE
[53:44] LORD BUT HE BUT BUT BUT IT ALL WAS THE
[53:46] SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD CUZ THEN GOD WENT AND
[53:49] GOT HIM AND THEN HE CAUGHT A REVELATION
[53:51] AND HE PRAYED TOWARD THE TEMPLE AND I
[53:53] HAVE READ THAT MANY TIMES AND IT'S
[53:55] HELPED ME. SO DID GOD SET HIM UP TO HELP
[53:57] YOU AND ME? I DON'T KNOW. I JUST KNOW
[53:59] IT'S IN HIS SOVEREIGNTY.
[54:02] I JUST KNOW THAT NO MATTER WHAT
[54:03] HAPPENED, GOD, AS FAR AS GOD WAS
[54:06] CONCERNED, JONAH NEVER WAS OUTSIDE OF
[54:09] THE WILL OF GOD.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN. We'll understand it better by and
[54:17] by. [laughter]
[54:21] &gt;&gt; I have a feeling Jonah will have a lot
[54:22] to say about that on the other side.
[54:24] Brother Jonah, Brother Brandham said
[54:26] something about here. Can you EXPLAIN
[54:27] THAT TO ME? WELL, SIT DOWN. I'VE been
[54:30] waiting a long time to explain this one.
[54:36] Verse 28. For to do whatsoever thy hand
[54:40] and thy counsel determined before to be
[54:42] done. And now, Lord, behold their
[54:46] threatenings, and grant unto thy
[54:47] servants, that with all boldness they
[54:50] may speak thy word by stretching forth
[54:54] thine hand to heal, and that signs and
[54:56] wonders may be done by the name OF THY
[54:59] HOLY CHILD, JESUS. NOW, catch it. AND
[55:02] WHEN THEY HAD PRAYED, NOW I WATCH THIS.
[55:06] WHEN THEY HAD PRAYED, THE PLACE was
[55:08] shaken where they were assembled
[55:10] TOGETHER AND THEY WERE ALL FILLED WITH
[55:13] THE HOLY GHOST AND THEY SPAKE THE WORD
[55:15] OF GOD WITH BOLDNESS. THEY WEREN'T BEING
[55:18] BORN AGAIN AGAIN. [laughter]
[55:21] THEY WEREN'T BEING BORN AGAIN AGAIN.
[55:24] THEY WERE BORN AGAIN IN ACTS TWO,
[55:26] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN THEY COME BACK AFTER THE TRIALS
[55:29] OF LIFE, HOW MANY HAVE HAD A FEW TRIALS
[55:31] AFTER YOU MET THE LORD? AND WHEN THEY
[55:33] CAME BACK UH YOU KNOW DOWN IN THEIR
[55:35] SPIRIT AND THE DEVIL HAVING WOUNDED YOU
[55:37] KNOW THEIR MIND AND THE OPPRESSION YOU
[55:39] CAN IMAGINE YOU'RE PREACHING YOU'RE
[55:41] YOU'RE TRYING TO STAND FOR RIGHT YOU'RE
[55:43] BEING THROWN IN PRISON AND THREATENED BY
[55:44] THE GOVERNMENT AND LASHED AND WHIPPED
[55:46] AND YOU GET BACK I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
[55:48] WE'RE JUST HUMAN BEINGS YOU'RE GOING TO
[55:50] COME BACK IN FRAIL AND WEAK AND BECAUSE
[55:53] YOU WENT THROUGH SOMETHING I'M GLAD TO
[55:56] KNOW THAT GOD CAN COME AGAIN AND AGAIN
[55:58] AND AGAIN ONE FILLING MANY REFILLINGS
[56:01] AND DO YOU KNOW ALL IT TOOK IT TOOK 30
[56:04] SECONDS OF QUOTING THE WORD BACK TO GOD
[56:07] AND WITHIN 30 SECONDS THE HOLY GHOST
[56:10] FELL UPON HIM AGAIN. OH, WHAT COULD YOU
[56:12] DO TODAY? NO WONDER JESUS QUOTED THE
[56:15] WORD. WHEN YOU QUOTE THE WORD AND
[56:16] BROTHER BENHAM SAID, YOU PUT IT ON YOUR
[56:18] LIPS AND YOU'RE A SON OF GOD OR A
[56:20] DAUGHTER OF GOD. THAT'S THE SAME AS GOD
[56:22] SPEAKING. WHY DON'T YOU PUT THE WORD
[56:24] INTO [screaming] ACTION?
[56:27] &gt;&gt; IT ONLY TOOK 30 SECONDS.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; FOR THEM TO QUOTE GOD'S WORD BACK TO
[56:31] GOD. DAVID said and God CAME DOWN TO
[56:35] PROVE YOU'RE RIGHT. David said that now
[56:36] here's here's your reward for believing
[56:38] it
[56:40] &gt;&gt; and it cured them
[56:42] &gt;&gt; fixed them in a moment because they come
[56:45] back and he says and they spake the word
[56:47] of God with boldness. They were ready to
[56:49] go right back out again. I I like that.
[56:51] I like the fact that no matter what the
[56:53] devil can do to me, I can come into THE
[56:56] PRESENCE OF GOD, GET A REFILLING, and I
[56:58] can go right back to the battle.
[57:01] Amen.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:05] [clears throat]
[57:06] &gt;&gt; SO AS I SAID, YOU KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW,
[57:09] AS WE move deeper into this theme of the
[57:12] greatest battle ever fought,
[57:15] um, you know, THE THE MATERIAL EVEN THAT
[57:17] I'M giving assumes a born again
[57:19] experience by the indwelling OF THE HOLY
[57:22] GHOST. NOW, WITHOUT THAT, without that,
[57:25] LET ME JUST SAY BEFORE I JUST LEAP PAST
[57:27] THAT, let me say the obvious that
[57:30] without the new birth, ALTHOUGH ANY OF
[57:33] GOD'S word is health to all your flesh,
[57:36] that's the truth. That's never not true.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; The word of God is health to all, body,
[57:41] spirit, soul. The word of God is health
[57:44] to all your flesh. Um, but you you need
[57:48] to first win the battle of the soul
[57:51] BEFORE YOU EVER TRY MASTERING THE BATTLE
[57:54] of the mind.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; So, we're talking about the battle of
[57:58] the mind. But I want to say it again.
[58:01] You need to win the battle of the soul.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; You need to be You must be born again.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; You must surrender your life in a
[58:09] COMPLETE REPENTANCE. THE HOLY GHOST IS
[58:11] NOT HARD TO GET. AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO
[58:13] FAST AND WAIT ON IT. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
[58:15] IS HAVE A THOROUGH, COMPLETE,
[58:16] UNEQUIVOCAL, UNHESITATING, FULL
[58:19] DISCLOSED REPENTANCE. AND TO SAY, "LORD,
[58:22] I REPENT OF EVERYTHING I'VE EVER BEEN,
[58:24] EVERYTHING THAT I AM. I DON'T WANT TO BE
[58:26] ME ANYMORE. I WANT TO BE YOU. I'M
[58:28] INVITING YOU TO COME INSIDE OF ME. AND
[58:30] I'M HERE TO TELL YOU," BROTHER BRANDHAM
[58:31] SAID, AND THEN SAY, "YOU DON'T HAVE THE
[58:33] HOLY GHOST." YOU MAKE GOD A LIAR. FOR IF
[58:35] YOU REPENT, YOU SHALL RECEIVE THE
[58:37] BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. AMEN.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; And the people struggle AND TO TO TO
[58:42] REALLY HAVE THAT LIFE-CHANGING THING
[58:44] BECAUSE THEY THE REPENTANCE IS NOT
[58:46] COMPLETELY FULL.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; It's conditional. You still want a lot
[58:51] of your own way and you want to keep a
[58:54] lot of your own trends.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; You want to be a Christian. You want to
[58:57] be born again, but you don't want it at
[58:59] the cost of what the Lord might change
[59:01] and take from you. You have the things
[59:03] that you've worked hard on and you've
[59:05] invested and by golly, you want to keep
[59:07] going with it. Well, I'm here to tell
[59:09] you, you might wait 40 days or 400 days.
[59:11] I don't know. Uh you might fast until
[59:14] till you're so sick you can't stand up.
[59:16] But God will wait until that box car,
[59:19] Brother Bam said, until that box car is
[59:21] packed in there correctly. And that's
[59:23] the human heart. That's not a that's not
[59:25] you living, you know,
[59:28] a perfect sanctified life, never making
[59:31] a mistake. HOW LONG DO I GOT TO GO
[59:33] WITHOUT MAKING A SINGLE ERROR? WELL, you
[59:35] just made one saying that.
[59:39] See, cuz there's no none good, no not
[59:41] one.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; How long do I got to GO BEING PERFECT?
[59:44] YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE
[59:46] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE POINT. THE PART
[59:48] THE POINT IS THAT THE THE BOX CAR IS THE
[59:50] HUMAN HEART. AND GOD IS LOOKING IN THAT
[59:52] HEART. And as long as THAT REPENTANCE IS
[59:55] NOT THOROUGH, HE WILL NOT SEAL THE
[59:57] VESSEL.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; SO I WOULD JUST SAY TO YOU TODAY, JUST
[1:00:00] THROW IT ALL UP. THROW UP YOUR HANDS AND
[1:00:02] SAY, "LORD, I'M GOING TO TRUST YOU FOR
[1:00:05] MY LIFE, AND I'M GOING TO COMPLETELY
[1:00:08] ABSOR I'M GOING TO COMPLETELY REPENT AND
[1:00:10] TURN AWAY FROM ALL MY FORMER LIFE, AND I
[1:00:13] WILL ONLY GO FORWARD IN THE DIRECTION
[1:00:15] AND ATTACH MYSELF TO THE THINGS AND
[1:00:17] ACCOMPLISH THE TASK AND ACHIEVE THE
[1:00:19] THINGS THAT YOU WANT ME TO achieve and
[1:00:22] accomplish."
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; You'll be glad you did that on the other
[1:00:26] side.
[1:00:29] Go ahead and keep chasing the world.
[1:00:31] It's all going to ash and cinder.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Chase it. Invest your whole life. Sink
[1:00:37] everything you got into this world.
[1:00:40] Fortune and glory, education and career.
[1:00:43] Nothing wrong with it. But go after.
[1:00:45] Listen. Let me tell you something,
[1:00:46] friends. Just remember this. The the
[1:00:49] more that you eat from the tree of
[1:00:53] knowledge, the more death you take into
[1:00:55] yourself.
[1:00:57] Now we understand the balance of that.
[1:00:59] This is a product of the tree of
[1:01:00] knowledge.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; You understand the very fact that that
[1:01:03] this was finally put in type set and
[1:01:06] could be mass-produced so that all the
[1:01:08] people could have it. That's the tree of
[1:01:09] knowledge taught taught them how to do a
[1:01:11] a printing press.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; We're grateful for all that we you drove
[1:01:14] here in vehicles today. Not saying go
[1:01:16] back to horse and buggy. I'm simply
[1:01:18] saying that in all of it, you came from
[1:01:20] God. You're going back to God. And so
[1:01:23] WHY WOULD NOT YOUR WHOLE LIFE IN BETWEEN
[1:01:25] COMING AND GOING before God?
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; and so just remember that you need
[1:01:31] Christ needs to be first. He needs to be
[1:01:34] the center. Brother Brandham says don't
[1:01:36] make him second.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; He said he does not want to be second.
[1:01:41] He does not deserve to be second. He
[1:01:44] deserves to be first. See,
[1:01:48] SO YOU NEED [clears throat] TO WIN THAT
[1:01:50] BATTLE OF the soul before you ever try
[1:01:51] to win the battle of the mind. Because
[1:01:53] even if you join a commune and live in
[1:01:55] the wilderness and and uh you you know
[1:01:58] you you can become a Buddhist monk and
[1:02:00] and have mind control, that's still
[1:02:02] that's you're still going to perish with
[1:02:04] the Antichrist,
[1:02:06] you know, if you reject God's word and
[1:02:09] and and God shows himself even to the
[1:02:11] ancient people. Say, "What about people
[1:02:13] who never knew about Jesus?" The ancient
[1:02:15] people didn't know about Jesus.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; But yet Jesus preached to them in hell
[1:02:19] and their souls in prison.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Well, how could he how could he leave
[1:02:23] them in hell when THEY NEVER EVEN KNEW
[1:02:25] ABOUT HIM? BECAUSE PAUL SAID THEY KNEW
[1:02:27] IT BY NATURE. GOD REVEALED HIMSELF TO
[1:02:29] THEM IN NATURE and they knew they're not
[1:02:31] there. He said THEY'RE WITHOUT EXCUSE.
[1:02:33] SO, HOW ABOUT YOU NOT TRY TO FIGURE OUT
[1:02:35] WHAT IS SOVEREIGN AND JUST LET GOD
[1:02:37] FIGURE OUT WHAT'S SOVEREIGN.
[1:02:39] He's got a plan for heathens and nations
[1:02:41] who never knew him. Don't worry. God has
[1:02:43] a way. He he uh he doesn't need you or
[1:02:46] me to be the general manager of his
[1:02:47] universe.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; So just stop arguing with him. Stop,
[1:02:52] drop, and roll and just say, "Lord, I
[1:02:54] just need you."
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I It's like years ago, I heard a a
[1:03:01] story. It was supposedly a true story
[1:03:03] about two buddies who one was a doctor
[1:03:05] and one was a lawyer. And they fell into
[1:03:08] a old tent revival way back in the early
[1:03:11] days. I forget. It might have been
[1:03:12] Moody's revival. I don't remember who it
[1:03:14] was. And um might have been seemed like
[1:03:16] it might have been Billy Sunday in a
[1:03:18] revival. I don't remember. And uh man,
[1:03:20] when the altar call came, they both hit
[1:03:22] the old sawdust trail and fell down at
[1:03:24] the altar. And the doctor and lawyer
[1:03:26] side by side, boohoo and snotting and
[1:03:28] pleading and you know, calling on the
[1:03:30] name of the Lord. And in a few minutes,
[1:03:33] uh the uh the doctor stood up and just
[1:03:36] raised his hands. Glory, hallelujah, I'm
[1:03:38] free.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; And turned around, went back to his
[1:03:41] seat. That lawyer stayed there hours and
[1:03:43] hours and they beat him on the back and
[1:03:45] tried everything in the world and
[1:03:47] finally finally he broke through and he
[1:03:49] raised up and said, "I'm free."
[1:03:52] And they got going walking home and the
[1:03:55] uh he and the doc and the lawyer looks
[1:03:57] over at his buddy. He said, "Hey, doc,
[1:03:59] can I ask you a question?" He goes,
[1:04:00] "Yeah, sure. What's up?"
[1:04:02] And he says, "Uh, you know, I noticed
[1:04:04] that when you got down at the altar," he
[1:04:07] said, "when I got down right beside
[1:04:09] you," he said, "I had to roll around for
[1:04:11] hours to finally break through." He
[1:04:13] said, "You were down five minutes and
[1:04:15] got up and walked away free." He said,
[1:04:16] "I don't understand that." And he said,
[1:04:18] "Oh, that's easy to explain. That's just
[1:04:20] cuz I'm a doctor and you're a lawyer."
[1:04:23] And he said, "What in the world does
[1:04:25] that have to do with it?" He says,
[1:04:26] "Well," he said, "when I got down
[1:04:28] there," he said, "when you got down
[1:04:29] there, you started pleading your case.
[1:04:31] When I got down there, I just told him,
[1:04:32] "I'm guilty." [laughter]
[1:04:36] So, no need to try to plead your case.
[1:04:38] DON'T BE A LAWYER. Just be just say,
[1:04:40] "Lord, I'm guilty." Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:04:44] [snorts]
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in the message,
[1:04:48] "And thy seed shall possess the gate of
[1:04:50] his enemies." You good?
[1:04:56] He says, "We are now a wheat, a grain of
[1:04:59] wheat in God's garner." Talking about
[1:05:03] because we're born again.
[1:05:05] When we was a cuckle, see, this is
[1:05:08] before we were born again. When we was a
[1:05:11] cockleber and God changed us from a
[1:05:15] cuckle to a grain of wheat by the new
[1:05:18] birth. Amen. He he took the old fallen
[1:05:21] nature that you're born with the cucker
[1:05:24] and annihilated that and a gene of God
[1:05:26] Zoe life came forward and that's a wheat
[1:05:28] life. Amen.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; SO HE SAYS GOD CHANGED us from a cucker
[1:05:35] to a grain of wheat makes the fruits
[1:05:39] different. Changing your own mind, your
[1:05:42] own ideas. It's the greatest miracle
[1:05:46] that ever happened when a man or woman
[1:05:48] is born again of the spirit of God and
[1:05:51] becomes a new creation in Christ Jesus.
[1:05:54] SO THE NEW BIRTH CHANGES YOUR IDEAS. It
[1:05:57] changes the fruits in your life. YOU
[1:06:00] THINK DIFFERENT, THEREFORE YOU ACT
[1:06:01] DIFFERENT. I THINK THEREFORE I AM. SO
[1:06:03] YOU THINK DIFFERENT, YOU SPEAK
[1:06:05] DIFFERENT, YOU ACT DIFFERENT, YOU WALK
[1:06:06] DIFFERENT, YOU LIVE DIFFERENT.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; You're bearing different fruits. See,
[1:06:11] now he GOES ON IN THE POWER OF
[1:06:13] TRANSFORMATION 1965. If it's a genuine
[1:06:16] spirit anointing the genuine seed, it
[1:06:20] can't do nothing BUT BEAR A SON OR
[1:06:23] daughter of God.
[1:06:25] But the GENUINE SPIRIT CAN COME UPON A
[1:06:27] cockbar seed. The rain can fall upon a
[1:06:31] cocklear and it will MAKE IT LIVE JUST
[1:06:33] THE SAME AS IT FALLS UPON A WHEAT AND
[1:06:36] makes it live. But by their fruits you
[1:06:38] know them. See? So you've got a a field
[1:06:41] of wheat and a field of weeds,
[1:06:43] cockleberers. AND WHEN THE RAIN COMES,
[1:06:45] THEY BOTH GROW AND THEY BOTH REJOICE.
[1:06:48] You see, remember, and I and I don't
[1:06:50] want TO I DON'T I'M DEFINITELY NOT GOING
[1:06:52] TO GO THIS way today because it's it's I
[1:06:54] have it for the next installment, but
[1:06:57] one of the one of the um main
[1:07:03] weapons or draw of the Antichrist spirit
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; to lead so many
[1:07:10] billions
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; into destruction at Armageddon.
[1:07:15] THE THING THAT REMEMBER WHEN THAT
[1:07:16] HAPPENS THEY'VE KILLED TO THE LAST MAN
[1:07:18] THE LAST RIGHTEOUS PERSON.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; There's no more righteous people in the
[1:07:21] earth. They've killed all the foolish
[1:07:22] virgin. They've murdered all the
[1:07:24] 144,000. They put Moses and Elijah to
[1:07:26] death. They have killed to the last man,
[1:07:28] woman, boy, and girl, all the righteous
[1:07:31] seed. And there's no one left in the
[1:07:32] earth but unrighteous people.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; And therefore, Armageddon comes forward.
[1:07:35] Christ comes out in Revelation 19, the
[1:07:37] armies of heaven to participate. Moses
[1:07:39] and Elijah are resurrected. And that's a
[1:07:42] great sign. But you say what it how
[1:07:44] could this Antichrist spirit lead so
[1:07:47] many into deception and so few escape
[1:07:50] it? And that is because of lying
[1:07:54] wonders.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; They're wonders, but they're lying
[1:07:58] wonders. See, now I'm not going to go
[1:08:01] too deeply in it today, but let me just
[1:08:03] let me just give you this nugget and
[1:08:05] we're going to move on.
[1:08:06] you you can walk into uh I mean almost
[1:08:11] just take your pick. Just spin the wheel
[1:08:13] and take your pick. Anyone you pick is
[1:08:14] going to probably show it. Any
[1:08:16] charismatic meeting, any evangelical
[1:08:19] meeting, any Pentecostal meeting, you'll
[1:08:21] walk in there and you'll see people
[1:08:23] shouting AND REJOICING AND IT WON'T
[1:08:25] MATTER. WOMEN with bobbed hair painted
[1:08:28] look like Jezebel,
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; you know, and and and and even vulgar
[1:08:32] dressed and they'll be shouting and
[1:08:35] screaming and praising the Lord and be
[1:08:36] crying real tears.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; I don't mean crocodile tears. I mean
[1:08:40] they really feel it.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; You understand? That's a lying wonder.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE PEOPLE LOOK AT THAT AND GO,
[1:08:46] "THAT'S THE ANSWER. I THAT'S WHAT I
[1:08:48] WANT. ALL THEY WANT IS THAT IS THAT
[1:08:49] EXUBERANT FEELING. THAT'S LIKE A DRUG to
[1:08:52] them.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; They go RIGHT BACK. IF YOU GIVE THEM THE
[1:08:54] WORD OF GOD, THEY WON'T BELIEVE THAT
[1:08:56] MORE THAN ANYTHING. YOU TRY TO TELL THEM
[1:08:58] HOW A MAN SHOULD LIVE AND DRESS AND ACT
[1:08:59] AND A WOMAN SHOULD LIVE AND WHAT WE
[1:09:00] SHOULD DO AND HOW WE SHOULD SPEAK RIGHT
[1:09:02] AWAY YOU'RE A HERETIC AND THROW AND SHOW
[1:09:04] THEM THE DOOR.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; SO DON'T BE MISLED BY LYING WONDERS.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; I UNDERSTAND YOU CAN GO INTO THEIR
[1:09:10] CONCERTS AND EVERYTHING'S BLACKED OUT
[1:09:12] AND BLUE LIGHTS ARE ON THEM AND AND THE
[1:09:15] WHOLE VIBE IS A CONCERT. IT'S NOT THEY
[1:09:17] CALL IT A CHURCH SERVICE. IT'S NOT A A
[1:09:19] CHURCH SERVICE. THAT'S A THAT'S A VIBE.
[1:09:21] THAT'S A CONCERT. I'M NOT HERE TO HAVE A
[1:09:24] CONCERT VIBE. I WANT TO HAVE A CHURCH
[1:09:25] SERVICE.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; I I SAY, "MAN, TURN THE LIGHTS ON. LET'S
[1:09:28] RAISE UP OUR HANDS. LET'S REJOICE. LET'S
[1:09:30] SING."
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'M NOT HERE TO DANCE AND GROOVE.
[1:09:34] I WANT TO PRAISE THE LORD WITH ALL MY
[1:09:36] HEART AND ALL MY MIND, ALL MY
[1:09:38] UNDERSTANDING, ALL MY STRENGTH.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; SEE, AND SO THE WORLD IS FILLED WITH
[1:09:44] THOSE LYING WONDERS.
[1:09:47] PODCASTERS WITH MILLIONS AND MILLIONS
[1:09:50] CLAIMING TO BE CHRISTIANS, YOU KNOW,
[1:09:52] WITH PIERCINGS AND TATTOOS EVERYWHERE
[1:09:54] AND AND EVERY FOURTH WORD IS THE FBOMB
[1:09:56] AND EVERY SIXTH WORD IS IS THIS UH
[1:09:59] TERRIBLE THING. AND I DON'T EVEN WANT TO
[1:10:00] GO DOWN THAT WAY. THAT'S A LYING WONDER.
[1:10:02] THAT'S NOT A CHRISTIAN.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; SEE, that's a lying wonder in the whole
[1:10:08] world. I just say TO YOU TODAY, IF THAT
[1:10:11] if that KIND OF THING MESMERIZES YOU,
[1:10:13] DON'T FEEL BAD. IT MESMERIZED JOHN.
[1:10:16] AMEN.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; JOHN SAW THAT ANTICHRIST AND HE WAS SO
[1:10:20] STUNNED. Her beauty, her opulence, her
[1:10:23] grandeur, HER OH, IT WAS JUST JOHN SAID,
[1:10:26] "I MARVELED." AND IT LITERALLY TOOK THE
[1:10:29] ANGEL STANDING THERE HAD TO REBUKE HIM
[1:10:31] AND SAY, "DON'T MARVEL AT THAT. UNDER
[1:10:34] UNDER THOSE BEAUTIFUL SKIRTS IS THE
[1:10:35] BLOOD OF YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS."
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THIS HOLY. AND IT
[1:10:41] HAD JOHN HAD TO COME TO HIS SENSES. A
[1:10:43] LOT OF TIMES SOME OF US JUST HAVE TO
[1:10:45] COME TO OUR SENSES.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE CHASING AFTER THE WRONG THING.
[1:10:49] AND NO WONDER THE PREACHER WOULD GET UP
[1:10:50] HERE AND SAY, "COME TO YOUR SENSES,
[1:10:51] MAN."
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; What are you feeding on?
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; SO HE SAYS, "IF IT'S A GENUINE
[1:11:00] ANOINTING, the genuine seed, it can do
[1:11:02] nothing but bear a son or daughter of
[1:11:04] God. BUT THE GENUINE SPIRIT CAN COME
[1:11:06] UPON A COCKLE BARREL SEED. The rain can
[1:11:09] fall upon a cockar AND MAKE IT JUST THE
[1:11:11] SAME AS IT FALLS UPON A WHEAT PLANT.
[1:11:13] MAKES IT LIVE. BUT BY THEIR fruits you
[1:11:15] shall know them. See, watch. We're a
[1:11:18] fruit tree of God bearing his word.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; SEE, SO BECAUSE human beings, now that's
[1:11:25] that's scriptural. David called himself,
[1:11:28] I think, an an aloe tree, one place, a
[1:11:30] palm tree, another time, uh, in the
[1:11:33] Garden of Eden, he uses trees
[1:11:34] metaphorically, talking about the the
[1:11:36] the serpent, talking about Christ,
[1:11:38] talking about, you know, of this tree,
[1:11:39] you can of all the trees, but of this
[1:11:41] tree. So it's obviously a different tree
[1:11:43] because he just told him you can eat of
[1:11:44] all of them but you can't eat of this
[1:11:45] one. So it's got to be a different kind
[1:11:46] of a tree than this kind of a tree.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; You follow me?
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; SO SO WE REALIZE THAT BECAUSE THAT WE
[1:11:52] ARE fruitbearing trees then evil spirits
[1:11:57] target our minds to capture a believer's
[1:12:00] will
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; residing in your spirit. Your will
[1:12:04] resides in your spirit.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND BECAUSE THAT THE ENEMY KNOWS
[1:12:09] THAT YOU'RE A FRUITBEARING TREE. That's
[1:12:12] what humans are. You're a fruitbearing
[1:12:14] tree. Then he he he's constantly Satan's
[1:12:19] strategy IS TO CONSTANTLY TRIED TO
[1:12:23] INTRODUCE to you uh TEMPTING THOUGHTS.
[1:12:29] AND A CONSTANT A CONSTANT HOW YOU KNOW
[1:12:33] IT'S THE DEVIL IS THAT THEY WILL
[1:12:35] CONSTANTLY TRY TO DRAW YOU AWAY from
[1:12:39] God's word which is supposed to be your
[1:12:41] true guide for life. See, SO SATAN'S
[1:12:45] STRATEGY then in introducing these
[1:12:48] tempting thoughts UH BECAUSE IT IT
[1:12:51] SPEAKS OF YOU REMEMBER YOU REMEMBER LAST
[1:12:53] UH I think in the last installment I
[1:12:56] think the fourth installment might have
[1:12:57] been the second I think it was the last
[1:12:58] one where we we made WE SHOWED YOU HOW
[1:13:02] THAT BROTHER Brandham had devoted a
[1:13:04] really significant portion of his
[1:13:06] ministry teaching about the the battle
[1:13:09] of the mind of the human mind between
[1:13:12] divine
[1:13:13] and demonic influence.
[1:13:16] BECAUSE HERE'S WHY THAT'S THAT KIND OF
[1:13:18] PREACHING IS IMPORTANT. THE NEW BIRTH
[1:13:20] DOES NOT insulate you from that.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? YOU'VE GOT TO USE THE
[1:13:25] WORD TO PRESS ON TO VICTORY over that.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; THE NEW WHAT DOES THE NEW BIRTH DO FOR
[1:13:30] ME? IT GIVES YOU THE FIGHTING CHANCE.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT THE NEW BIRTH, YOU CAN'T EVEN
[1:13:35] AGREE WITH ALL OF GOD'S WORD. YOU HAVE
[1:13:37] TO BE BORN AGAIN SO THAT THEN YOU CAN
[1:13:39] HAVE THE WORD REVEALED TO YOU SO THAT
[1:13:40] THEN YOU CAN STAND ON IT. SO THEN YOU
[1:13:42] CAN WALK IN IT. SO SATAN CAN BE
[1:13:44] DEFEATED.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU ALWAYS WILL. JAMES
[1:13:48] SAID THERE'S NO TEMPTATION HAS TAKEN
[1:13:50] YOU, BUT SUCH AS IS COMMON TO MAN. SO
[1:13:53] SO, SO PLEASE STOP WHINING AND CRYING.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AMEN.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO TEMPTATION TAKING YOU BUT
[1:14:01] SUCH AS IS COMMON TO MAN. OH, WOWY WY
[1:14:04] WOLF. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?
[1:14:05] THERE AIN'T NOTHING HAPPENED TO YOU THAT
[1:14:07] AIN'T HAPPENED TIMES A MILLION IN YOUR
[1:14:09] BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN AGES PRIOR. AND
[1:14:11] YOU HAVEN'T SUFFERED UNDER BLOOD LIKE
[1:14:13] THEY DID. SO COME ON,
[1:14:16] LET'S BE MEN AND WOMEN. LET'S SAY, I'M
[1:14:18] HERE TO DO GOD'S WILL. I'M NOT HERE TO
[1:14:20] CRY ABOUT MY LIFE OR MY BIRTH OR MY
[1:14:23] FAMILY OR THIS HAPPENED TO ME OR THAT
[1:14:24] HAPPENED OR THIS PERSON DID THAT TO ME
[1:14:26] OR THIS PREACHER DID THAT TO ME. I'M
[1:14:28] HERE MARCHING TO ZION. [screaming] I'M
[1:14:29] NOT HERE TO BE DISTRACTED BY THE DEVIL.
[1:14:32] AMEN.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; I'M HERE TO SAY I CAN DO ALL THINGS
[1:14:34] THROUGH CHRIST WHO STRENGTHENS ME.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Not here TO HEAR A PITY PARTY. [snorts]
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT SAYING WE DON'T HAVE WOUNDS. WE
[1:14:46] DO. NOT SAYING. BUT THERE'S THERE'S
[1:14:48] VICTORY FOR YOU, FRIENDS. I PROMISE YOU
[1:14:51] TWO THINGS. IF YOU TAKE GOD'S WORD,
[1:14:53] YOU'LL HAVE VICTORY. IF YOU DON'T TAKE
[1:14:55] GOD'S WORD, YOU'LL SIT IN THAT HURT
[1:14:57] FOREVER.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; YOU'LL NEVER BREAK FREE OF IT. NO
[1:15:00] PSYCHIATRIST, NO DRUGS, NO NOTHING CAN
[1:15:03] GIVE IT TO YOU. NO CHRISTIAN PSYCHOLOGY.
[1:15:06] ONLY THE POWER OF THE RISEN CHRIST CAN
[1:15:09] SET YOU FREE AND SHATTER THAT COMPLEX
[1:15:11] UPON YOUR LIFE.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; I KNOW THAT BY EXPERIENCE.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; FIGHT IT ALL YOU WANT. YOU'LL NEVER
[1:15:17] DEFEAT IT.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; SEE, because the reason,
[1:15:23] you know, THE IT'S ALL ABOUT DIVINE AND
[1:15:25] DEMONIC INFLUENCE. AND THE REASON IS
[1:15:27] THAT IT TOUCHES ON THIS AS WE SAID I
[1:15:29] THINK IT WAS LAST TIME THIS FUNDAMENTAL
[1:15:32] human capacity called choice.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE IT'S A HUMAN CAPACITY AS WE
[1:15:39] SAID TO YOU LAST TIME THEN IT'S A HUMAN
[1:15:41] VULNERABILITY.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; So this is WHERE THIS IS WHERE SATAN
[1:15:45] COMES. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY TO YOU
[1:15:47] TODAY I'M NOT GOING BACK TO REPREACH
[1:15:48] THAT MATERIAL. GO BACK AND LISTEN TO
[1:15:49] PART FOUR AGAIN. I WANNA I WANT TO PUT
[1:15:52] SOME COURAGE IN YOUR HEART TODAY TO SAY
[1:15:55] THAT THAT VULNERABILITY THAT YOU HAVE IN
[1:15:57] YOUR FLESH BECAUSE IT'S NOT CONVERTED.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; YOUR SOUL IS CONVERTED.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; YOU BUT YOUR SPIRIT AND YOUR FLESH ARE
[1:16:05] NOT CONVERTED. YOUR MEMORY, REASON,
[1:16:07] CONSCIOUS EFFECTS AND IMAGINATIONS.
[1:16:08] THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SO MUCH PRACTICAL
[1:16:11] PREACHING FROM THE APOSTLES ON HOW TO
[1:16:13] STAND FIRM, HOW TO CAST DOWN VAIN
[1:16:15] IMAGINATIONS, HOW TO EQUIP YOURSELF WITH
[1:16:17] THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND I WANT TO SAY TO YOU TODAY
[1:16:21] THAT WHILE YOU WILL REMAIN VULNERABLE
[1:16:24] THAT THAT THE THE OUTCOME OF THAT IS NOT
[1:16:27] INEVITABLE. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO FAIL.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; I'M HERE TO TELL YOU YOU DO NOT HAVE TO.
[1:16:34] THAT ONCE YOU'RE BORN AGAIN, SATAN
[1:16:36] CANNOT FORCE YOU TO DO IT. BEFORE HE
[1:16:39] COULD, NOW HE CAN'T. YOU CAN WALK IN THE
[1:16:42] STATUTES OF THE [screaming] WORD OF GOD
[1:16:44] AND YOU CAN PRAY AND YOU CAN REPENT AND
[1:16:46] YOU CAN EAT ON FEED ON THE WORD OF GOD
[1:16:48] AND YOU CAN HAVE A VICTORIOUS LIFE. YOUR
[1:16:51] VULNERABILITY IS NOT AN INEVITABILITY TO
[1:16:54] FAIL.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE FIRST LIE YOU NEED TO DEBUNK
[1:16:59] IN YOUR MIND. SATAN CANNOT FORCE YOU.
[1:17:02] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS here in the token,
[1:17:08] [clears throat] I'm not going to get to
[1:17:09] everything I've got on my notes today,
[1:17:11] but you got another 10, 15 minutes.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:14] [clears throat]
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; WE ONLY NEED THE TOKEN WITH us to make
[1:17:20] that word live again.
[1:17:24] Not only
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; is that all we need, that's all that
[1:17:28] can. YEAH,
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO OTHER POWER THAT CAN MAKE THE
[1:17:31] WORD live
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; is the token. THAT'S THE LIFE OF CHRIST
[1:17:35] IN YOU. SEE, THAT'S WHAT HE SENT THE
[1:17:38] token for
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; IT. GIVE US THE STATEMENT. G GIVE US
[1:17:43] THAT STATEMENT AND WE KNOW IT'S THE
[1:17:46] TRUTH. The the NEW TOKEN, HE CALLS IT A
[1:17:49] NEW TOKEN, SHOWS JESUS HAS MET EVERY
[1:17:53] REQUIREMENT FOR us and he is here. The
[1:17:57] new token, THE TOKEN OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:18:01] shows that WE KNOW THAT JESUS DIED TO
[1:18:05] FREE US FROM ALL THE THINGS OF THE
[1:18:07] WORLD. THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE FROM THE
[1:18:09] WORLD KNOWING what he did. THEY KNOW
[1:18:12] WHAT HE DID AT CALVARY, BUT THEIR LIFE
[1:18:14] DEMONSTRATES THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A
[1:18:16] CONCEPT THAT IT CAME TO FREE THEM FROM
[1:18:19] SIN BECAUSE NOTHING CHANGES IN THEIR
[1:18:21] LIFE. AMEN.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; SEE, SO BROTHER BRANDHAM IS
[1:18:24] DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN WHAT THE WORLD
[1:18:26] MIGHT CALL THE NEW BIRTH AND WHAT IT
[1:18:28] ACTUALLY IS. The token of the Holy
[1:18:31] Spirit shows that we know that Jesus
[1:18:35] died to free us from all the things of
[1:18:37] the world. AND THE TOKEN THAT IS UPON US
[1:18:40] proves it by vindicating WHAT HE SAID.
[1:18:45] NOW, HOW CAN A man claim TO HOLD THAT
[1:18:49] TOKEN IN FRONT OF HIM AND DENY WHAT this
[1:18:52] word says? It isn't so. SEE, IT CAN'T BE
[1:18:56] SO. GOD CAN'T LIE about his own word.
[1:19:01] And because he is here, we have the
[1:19:04] right to all that he purchased for us.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; I hold these truths to be self-evident.
[1:19:15] I DECLARE independence from the tyranny
[1:19:19] of Lucifer AND I PLEDGE MY ALLEGIANCE TO
[1:19:22] a new king.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; ONE WHO CAN FREE me from sin.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; So when YOU ACTIVELY BRING YOUR thoughts
[1:19:32] actively you bring them
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; actively under THE AUTHORITY OF GOD'S
[1:19:39] WORD. FRIENDS, do you realize that you
[1:19:43] OPERATE THE HOLY GHOST POWER SENT TO
[1:19:47] MAKE THE WORD LIVE IN YOU? THE HOLY
[1:19:49] GHOST POWER IS SENT TO MAKE THE WORD
[1:19:52] live in you.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU ACQUIES, WHEN YOU AGREE,
[1:19:56] WHEN YOU ALIGN YOUR LIFE WITH THE TOKEN
[1:19:58] LIFE, THEN YOU ARE LITERALLY ACTIVATED.
[1:20:01] YOU YOU HAVE ACTIVATED GOD'S AUTHORITY,
[1:20:03] GOD'S POWER, AND THAT'S THE WHOLE PLAN
[1:20:06] THAT HE'S ALWAYS HAD IS TO BE LIVING AND
[1:20:08] PUTTING THE AUTHORITY IN HIS CHURCH. IF
[1:20:11] YOU SAY TO THIS,
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; see now, BROTHER BRANDHAM, HERE'S
[1:20:16] BROTHER BRANDHAM PROVING THAT FROM A
[1:20:18] PARADOX 1964. NOW, WHAT IS IT?
[1:20:21] CHRIST COMING TO HIS BODY. CHRIST IS THE
[1:20:24] WORD. WE ALL KNOW THE ANOINTING IS
[1:20:27] CHRIST THAT COMES ON THE WORD that makes
[1:20:29] the word live. Is that right?
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE ANOINTING. CHRIST IS THE
[1:20:35] ANOINTING. THE SPIRIT THAT COMES UPON
[1:20:39] THE WORD [clears throat] THAT QUICKENS
[1:20:41] the word to MAKE IT LIVE. NOW THE WORD
[1:20:45] IS IN YOUR HEART. DO YOU BELIEVE IN
[1:20:48] DIVINE HEALING?
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Whatever more.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; See, AND CHRIST THE ANOINTING COMING TO
[1:20:54] HIS BODY. SEE, THERE'S WHERE THE
[1:20:57] CONNECTION IS. IT'S CHRIST COMING TO
[1:21:00] OMNIPOTENCE MEET. HE HE BRINGS A GENE OF
[1:21:03] GOD TO LIFE. ANNIHILATES YOUR OLD
[1:21:05] NATURE. AND WHILE YOUR FLESH AND SPIRIT
[1:21:09] REMAIN UNCONVERTED, HE LIVES ON THE
[1:21:11] INSIDE. AND YOU BRING THIS BODY SUBJECT
[1:21:14] TO HIS WORD. YOU DO THAT.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; HE'S HERE TO ANOINT IT, BUT YOU HAVE TO
[1:21:19] LET THE MIND WHICH WAS IN CHRIST BE IN
[1:21:21] YOU.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[1:21:25] now that's THE WAY THE KINGDOM WORKS.
[1:21:27] AND CONVERSELY, SO NOW, SO CONVERSELY,
[1:21:30] YOU SAY, "WELL, I I I FIND SOMETIMES
[1:21:33] WHILE I BELIEVE THAT, BROTHER JASON,
[1:21:36] BOY, GETTING THAT INTO MY PRACTICAL
[1:21:38] DAILY LIFE, I I'D HATE FOR EVERYONE IN
[1:21:40] HERE TO KNOW how often I fail at that.
[1:21:41] I'd hate for you to know how often I
[1:21:43] fail at it."
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; So, let me just LET ME JUST TRY TO help
[1:21:46] you.
[1:21:48] The same way that his word, his token,
[1:21:51] his spirit comes to make the word live,
[1:21:54] it is those unguarded thoughts that
[1:21:57] although they did not necessarily
[1:21:59] originate from you, they will if left
[1:22:03] unchecked.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; They didn't come from you.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Something spoke it into your mind.
[1:22:09] THAT'S WHERE THE battleground is. See,
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU AND THAT'S WHY THE WORD TELLS
[1:22:14] US WE CAST DOWN OF VAIN IMAGINATION.
[1:22:16] WE'RE TO BRING EVERY THOUGHT, EVERY
[1:22:18] THOUGHT, every thought subject. WE'RE TO
[1:22:20] BRING IT TO THE HOLY SPIRIT. These are
[1:22:22] things that you do. YOU UNDERSTAND? AND
[1:22:24] SO WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE UNGUARDED
[1:22:26] THOUGHTS, WHEN YOU DON'T DO THAT, uh
[1:22:29] even THOUGH THEY DIDN'T ORIGINATE FROM
[1:22:30] YOU, THEY COME FROM THE DEVIL. And if
[1:22:32] you leave them unchecked, they will
[1:22:35] DOMINATE YOUR THINKING. AND IT MIGHT NOT
[1:22:38] START THAT WAY ON DAY ONE.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:42] BUT EVERY DAY YOU LEAVE THAT UNCHECKED.
[1:22:45] EVERY DAY THAT YOU DON'T CHECK THE DEVIL
[1:22:47] IN HIS MOVE. HOLD ON HERE, BOY. I DON'T
[1:22:48] THINK LIKE THAT.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; And and and AS FOR ME IN MY HOUSE, WE
[1:22:52] SHALL SERVE THE LORD.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE YOU'RE NOT WELCOME HERE.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT INTERESTED IN HAVING THAT IN MY
[1:22:57] LIFE. OH, SURE. IT COULD PUT MORE ZEROS
[1:22:59] IN MY BANK ACCOUNT, BUT IT'LL TAKE ME
[1:23:01] AWAY FROM THE WORD OF GOD. I'M CHECKING
[1:23:03] THAT THOUGHT RIGHT NOW. I WILL NOT HAVE
[1:23:04] THAT THOUGHT IN MY MIND.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; SEE, IF YOU DON'T DO THAT, YOU SAY, "OH,
[1:23:09] WELL, I'VE GOT THE HOLY GHOST. IT'LL DO
[1:23:11] IT FOR ME. IT'LL DO IT FOR YOU. It's the
[1:23:13] only one who can do IT FOR YOU. BUT
[1:23:14] YOU'VE GOT TO LET IT DO IT FOR YOU.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; SEE?
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; He's not GOING TO FORCE HIMSELF. IT WILL
[1:23:20] DOMINATE YOUR thinking until IT HAS YOU
[1:23:23] IN SUCH A GRIP that
[1:23:26] sometimes,
[1:23:28] let me LET ME JUST SAY THIS and I I'm
[1:23:29] going to come to a close. I want to make
[1:23:30] one more point, but before I do, I'm
[1:23:32] just going to go off my notes a little
[1:23:33] bit and make this point,
[1:23:36] BROTHER BRANDHAM. AND I didn't I I I've
[1:23:38] got the quote if somebody needs to read
[1:23:40] it uh from he preached human demonology
[1:23:42] four times and the fourth time he
[1:23:43] preached it he's talking about and I'm
[1:23:47] just going to paraphrase because I don't
[1:23:48] have it here but he's talking about
[1:23:51] divine healing in the flesh people with
[1:23:54] sickness and diseases
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; and HE'S GOING TO CORRELATE THEM VERY
[1:23:58] VERY CLEAR clearly and he's actually
[1:24:00] going to talk about both the flesh and
[1:24:02] the spirit and he's and the point THAT
[1:24:05] HE'S GOING TO MAKE IS IS THAT YOU CAN
[1:24:07] HAVE DEMON SPIRITS on a disease in your
[1:24:11] body. And he AND HE SAYS, "NOW PEOPLE
[1:24:14] WOULD SAY, "Brother Brandham, I'M NOT
[1:24:17] POSSESSED of a devil." And he would say,
[1:24:20] "Cuz see, they're thinking of Legion.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; You understand? They're thinking of
[1:24:23] Legion. I'm not possessed of a devil.
[1:24:25] I'm not a raving maniac living in the
[1:24:27] tombs breaking chains. I've just got a
[1:24:30] tumor. I don't I don't I'm not possessed
[1:24:32] of a devil." AND BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:24:33] ACTUALLY WILL SAY, OKAY, I'M NOT SAYING
[1:24:37] ALTOGETHER POSSESSED BECAUSE IT'S ALL
[1:24:38] it's all wording. You understand? He
[1:24:41] said, I LET'S JUST SAY THAT IT'S O
[1:24:43] OPPRESSED. MAYBE YOU'RE NOT POSSESSED
[1:24:45] LIKE LEGION, but remember that the Bible
[1:24:48] says a demon is a tormentor.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; That's what he does. See, he afflicts
[1:24:54] people. That's why the Bible says, "If
[1:24:56] any be afflicted, let them call for the
[1:24:59] elders of the church, the ministry of
[1:25:00] the church. the prayer of faith shall
[1:25:02] save them. See, so sometimes, AND THEN
[1:25:05] BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY, "SO WHEN IT'S
[1:25:07] OVER HERE IN THE FLESH, IT MIGHT BE SOME
[1:25:08] sickness or disease." He said, "When
[1:25:10] it's over here in your spirit, you're
[1:25:12] not possessed of a devil, but you're
[1:25:14] being oppressed by an EVIL SPIRIT." AND
[1:25:17] I DON'T KNOW, I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY HERE
[1:25:20] TODAY. I don't even THINK YOU COULD GIVE
[1:25:22] ME YOUR WHOLE LIFE STORY, AND I MIGHT
[1:25:23] COULDN'T TELL YOU. A PROPHET COULD
[1:25:24] PROBABLY TELL YOU. A PROPHET FIGURED OUT
[1:25:26] THAT A WOMAN HAD SUCH A SPIRIT OF FEAR
[1:25:28] BECAUSE AS A LITTLE GIRL WEARING A A A
[1:25:31] YELLOW JACKET, A DOG CHASED HER UP ON A
[1:25:33] PORCH when she was a child.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; So, I don't know. I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT.
[1:25:36] I'M NOT A PROPHET. I YOU CAN SAY, "WELL,
[1:25:38] THIS HAPPENED TO ME IN MY CHILDHOOD.
[1:25:40] THIS HAPPENED TO ME IN MY MARRIAGE. THIS
[1:25:41] HAPPENED TO ME IN THIS CHURCH. This
[1:25:43] happened to me. I don't you know, I
[1:25:45] DON'T KNOW, FRIENDS. ALL I CAN DO IS
[1:25:47] GIVE YOU THE FIX ALL."
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; AND I PROMISE YOU, IT'S A FIX ALL.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; IT'LL IT'LL FIX ANYTHING. IT HAS THE
[1:25:54] ANSWER FROM THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE. NO
[1:25:56] MATTER WHAT THE DEVIL CAN DO, IT CAN
[1:25:57] REPAIR.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT CAN MAKE YOU CLEAN. IT
[1:26:01] CAN TAKE THE VILE SINNER AND MAKE THEM
[1:26:02] CLEAN.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; IT CAN BREAK THE POWER OF THE ENEMY. AND
[1:26:06] BROTHER BRENNHAM SAYS SOMETIMES, YOU
[1:26:08] KNOW, YOU GET AN OPPRESSION ON YOUR
[1:26:09] SPIRIT. AND HE SAYS THAT MAKES YOU DO
[1:26:11] THINGS THAT AREN'T RIGHT. HE SAID,
[1:26:12] "WELL, IS HE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE THE
[1:26:14] NEW BIRTH OR AFTER THE NEW BIRTH?" I'm
[1:26:15] not TRYING TO BREAK THAT DOWN TO YOU
[1:26:17] TODAY. I'M JUST SIMPLY SHOWING YOU THAT
[1:26:19] IT'S AN OPPRESSIVE DEMON AND AND MAYBE
[1:26:21] SOMETHING GAVE YOU ACCESS. BROTHER
[1:26:23] BRANDHAM GOES INTO A LOT OF DETAILS.
[1:26:26] IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. I don't want to
[1:26:27] lose you. I WANT YOU TO STAY RIGHT WITH
[1:26:29] me and get ready to close.
[1:26:31] SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS ABOUT HOW
[1:26:34] THAT, you know, things can happen IN OUR
[1:26:37] LIVES. SOMETIMES THERE'S A NATURAL
[1:26:39] PROPENSITY. SOMETIMES THAT BROTHER
[1:26:40] BRANDHAM CALLED IT THE GRABAG OF LIFE.
[1:26:42] YOU JUST you inherited it. He talks
[1:26:44] about people who WHO HAVE A, YOU KNOW,
[1:26:47] he catches a man in the in the in the
[1:26:49] line. He says, "Now, sir," he says, "I
[1:26:50] see. Okay, I see what's up. You you
[1:26:53] you're you're you worry.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; You worry all the time." And he said,
[1:26:57] "Now, that's going to give you cancer,
[1:26:58] arthritis, and all kinds of things if
[1:27:00] you keep doing that."
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; See, he's trying to get the man to go
[1:27:03] against the way he was born.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; So, BROTHER BRANDON WOULDN'T REQUIRE
[1:27:06] THAT IF IT WASN'T POSSIBLE.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; You understand? He says, "Now,
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "NOW, YOU GOT THAT." HE SAID,
[1:27:12] "YOU got that?" I think it was from his
[1:27:14] mother or maybe a grandmother. I can't
[1:27:16] remember. I haven't read the quote in a
[1:27:17] long time. He says, "Or maybe it was A
[1:27:19] GRANDFATHER." HE SAID, "THAT CAME ON YOU
[1:27:20] AND IT JUMPED OVER AND LANDED on you."
[1:27:22] He said, "You're always crossing bridges
[1:27:24] before you get to them."
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; SEE, SO YOU GOT THIS MAN CROSSING
[1:27:29] BRIDGES. HE'S WORRYING. Here's a girl
[1:27:31] afraid and a dog chased her. And who,
[1:27:34] YOU KNOW, I'M SO BROTHER BRADAM SAID,
[1:27:36] YOU KNOW, WE'RE WE'RE BORN with
[1:27:37] weaknesses and somehow Satan can see
[1:27:40] what they are. He watches and studies us
[1:27:42] as children. HE CAN SPOT A MINISTRY OR
[1:27:44] GIFT. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID HE'LL TRY TO
[1:27:46] TAKE THAT CHILD OUT PREMATURELY AND KILL
[1:27:48] THEM BECAUSE he's a he can SEE A GIFT
[1:27:50] THERE AND HE'S AFRAID OF IT. WHAT IT
[1:27:51] MIGHT DO, HE'S NOT GOING to take a
[1:27:52] chance. And it has to be the Holy
[1:27:54] Spirit. I I probably should have been
[1:27:55] dead five or six times growing up as a
[1:27:57] child. It's very uh daring and
[1:28:00] adventuresome and I was always swimming
[1:28:02] out further THAN I COULD GET BACK AND I
[1:28:04] WAS ALWAYS BEING IN PLACE I SHOULDN'T
[1:28:05] HAVE BEEN AND I WAS ALWAYS DOING STUFF
[1:28:07] THAT IN THAT THAT RISKED MY LIFE. THAT'S
[1:28:09] JUST THAT'S HOW I WAS. AND I REALIZED
[1:28:11] FOUR OR FIVE TIMES, FOUR OR FIVE TIMES,
[1:28:14] [snorts]
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; I SHOULD have been dead,
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; BUT THE LORD KNEW I NEEDED to stand here
[1:28:18] today and preach to you.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; See, and it's Satan trying to kill me.
[1:28:22] And and and angels are moving. YOU DON'T
[1:28:24] REALIZE THERE'S A WHOLE ANOTHER REALM,
[1:28:26] FRIENDS. ANGELS ARE MOVING, INTERDICTING
[1:28:28] ON YOUR BEHALF.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; DON'T EVER FEEL ALONE. YOU'RE NEVER
[1:28:31] ALONE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; BE ENCOURAGED. THE LORD KNOWS ABOUT IT.
[1:28:36] THAT'S WHAT JEHOVAH GYRA MEANS. THE LORD
[1:28:38] SEES AND THE LORD WILL SEE TO IT.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; He's our provider. THAT'S EX THAT'S HOW
[1:28:43] HE DOES IT.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; HE'S YOUR PROVIDER CUZ HE SEES WHAT YOU
[1:28:46] NEED AND HE'LL SEE TO IT. ALL YOU HAVE
[1:28:47] TO DO IS TRUST HIM. ABRAHAM JUST TRUSTED
[1:28:50] HIM. HE JUST KEPT GOING FORWARD. SEE?
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; SO, SO, SO WE FIND THAT WHATEVER,
[1:28:57] HOWEVER THE DEVIL, YOU KNOW, HE HE
[1:28:59] BROTHER M SAID, YOU GOT TO KEEP YOUR
[1:29:01] GUARD UP OVER SOME OF THOSE AREAS.
[1:29:02] SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BOTHER YOU real
[1:29:04] easy wouldn't bother ME AT ALL. AND VICE
[1:29:06] VERSA. SOMETHING THAT THAT YOU WOULD
[1:29:08] HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH MIGHT MIGHT KNOCK
[1:29:10] ME OUT IF IF IF I GIVE IT ATTENTION. SO,
[1:29:12] WE DON'T KNOW. IT'S THE GRABAG OF LIFE.
[1:29:14] I I I DON'T KNOW. AND AND LOOK, BROTHER
[1:29:17] BRANDHAM KNOWING WHAT IT WAS DIDN'T FIX
[1:29:20] IT. SAY, "OH, IF I COULD JUST HAVE
[1:29:21] BROTHER BRANDOM, HE COULD TELL ME." THAT
[1:29:22] DOESN'T FIX IT. ONLY YOUR FAITH CAN FIX
[1:29:25] IT.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; SEE, and and I'm HERE TO TELL YOU
[1:29:27] SOMETHING, FRIENDS. I'VE HAD THINGS IN
[1:29:29] MY LIFE AND AND AND THAT HAUNTED ME.
[1:29:32] MAYBE THINGS OF CHILDHOOD, MAYBE A
[1:29:34] PROPENSITY. I DON'T KNOW WHO CAN SAY. IT
[1:29:36] DOESN'T MATTER. IT HAUNTED ME AND AND
[1:29:38] AND HAD SUCH A GRIP ON MY LIFE THAT I
[1:29:41] ACTUALLY HAD TO GO THROUGH A PRAYER LINE
[1:29:42] AND CALL FOR THE MINISTERS LAY THEIR
[1:29:44] HANDS ON ME AND AND DRIVE THAT THING
[1:29:46] AWAY FROM ME AND I CAME OUT OF THERE
[1:29:48] CLEAN. I'VE ALSO HAD TIMES WHERE THE
[1:29:50] DEVIL AFFLICTED MY MIND, AFFLICTED MY
[1:29:52] SPIRIT COMPLEX HERE IN A COMPLEX THERE
[1:29:54] AND NO AMOUNT OF PRAYER WOULD DO IT
[1:29:56] UNTIL I WAS SITTING IN A SERVICE AND I
[1:29:58] HEARD THE WORD AND WHILE THE MINISTER
[1:30:00] YET SPAKE THESE WORDS, A POWER CAME UPON
[1:30:03] ME AND BROKE THAT THING. AND I AND I'M
[1:30:06] HERE TO TELL YOU, I STAYED MORE FREE BY
[1:30:08] THE FREEDOM OF THE WORD THAN I EVER DID
[1:30:11] GETTING PRAYED FOR. AMEN.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT GOD HAS SUPPLIED YOU WITH
[1:30:18] TODAY, FRIENDS.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; JUST SPEAK THE WORD AND GO FORWARD.
[1:30:23] THAT'S WHY HE SAID TO MOSES, "WHY CRY
[1:30:25] UNTO ME? SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE that they
[1:30:27] go forward. I've already commissioned
[1:30:29] you."
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; See, SO
[1:30:34] SO YOU KNOW, I I WANT TO SAY THIS AND
[1:30:36] I'M GOING TO COME TO MY CLOSING POINT.
[1:30:41] God's economy. And this is this is
[1:30:43] important.
[1:30:46] And I've I'm I've thought a lot how to
[1:30:50] explain this because I want to be clear.
[1:30:54] I'M GOING TO START IT BY saying
[1:30:57] God's economy
[1:30:59] is not a onetoone.
[1:31:02] First of all,
[1:31:04] Jesus multiplies. Yeah.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; So if he couldn't, I've said this
[1:31:09] before, then if you spent 10 years in
[1:31:13] sin, he would need 10 years to get you
[1:31:16] out. If you had 10 years worth of filth,
[1:31:19] he would need 10 years to clean you up.
[1:31:21] But because Jesus multiplies, I've seen
[1:31:24] people with 20 years, 40 years, and
[1:31:27] Jesus convert them and and clean them up
[1:31:32] in three or four months. You can't even
[1:31:34] tell they're the same human
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; and they'll never look back AND NEVER GO
[1:31:38] BACK AND THEY ONLY GET STRONGER and
[1:31:40] stronger and stronger because his
[1:31:42] economy isn't one to one. He he doesn't
[1:31:44] do it that way. Listen, you know, I
[1:31:47] remember I I remember uh
[1:31:51] brother Matt and I and brother Dale
[1:31:52] Smith and and I had the crazy I don't
[1:31:54] know who in the world inflicted my mind
[1:31:56] was such a bad idea. We we we hired a u
[1:32:00] a trainer because we need all needed to
[1:32:02] get in shape. And so we we went for some
[1:32:05] private tutoring. I wasn't about to
[1:32:07] bring me and my ministry team into a
[1:32:08] co-ed class of men and women. And so I I
[1:32:11] hired a trainer and I said, "Don't
[1:32:13] worry, Brother Matt, Brother Dale. I'll
[1:32:14] pay for it. I'll pay for it all. I've
[1:32:16] got a Serbian trainer and his name
[1:32:18] [laughter] his name was Buoyen and you
[1:32:20] may have heard some of the story before
[1:32:22] and we called him Ivan the Terrible. He
[1:32:24] was Serbian and actually he was quite he
[1:32:26] was quite intelligent. He had actually
[1:32:28] been on the training squad uh part of
[1:32:30] the part of the physio training squad
[1:32:32] for um Novak Djokovic when he was a
[1:32:35] junior in junior leagues before he
[1:32:37] turned pro. And so in Serbia, back in
[1:32:39] Serbia, this is where Boyen was from.
[1:32:42] And man, he was rough. [laughter]
[1:32:43] We called him Ivan the terrible. And uh,
[1:32:46] Brother Dale, Brother Dale said one
[1:32:47] time, they said, "Well, how do you like
[1:32:48] your trainer?" He said, "I liked him
[1:32:50] pretty good till he tried to FOLD ME
[1:32:52] LIKE A TACO."
[1:32:55] I said, "Smith, you're one of a kind,
[1:32:58] bro." But but he he made this he made
[1:33:02] this statement
[1:33:04] THAT UH CUZ I HAD I'D MISSED SOME
[1:33:06] CLASSES. He and he he took me aside. He
[1:33:08] said, "Jason, I'm going to tell you." He
[1:33:10] said the way your body works, he said
[1:33:13] you can train ever so hard. He said,
[1:33:15] 'But if you go two weeks, just two weeks
[1:33:18] with no training, he said your body
[1:33:21] almost starts back at zero.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; And you just have to go back to the
[1:33:26] starting point and come out of the gates
[1:33:27] again and just recover all of that. Now,
[1:33:30] that's that's not a perfect statement,
[1:33:32] but that's that's a general guideline.
[1:33:34] You you it's it's all about discipline.
[1:33:36] It's not conquering the world. It's just
[1:33:38] a discipline of a healthier lifestyle.
[1:33:41] So, but but when we when we think of the
[1:33:44] economy of God, it doesn't work like
[1:33:47] that because Satan would like to get you
[1:33:50] to believe
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; that, oh, you you came to church, you
[1:33:55] heard a sermon, YOU WERE SO DELIVERED,
[1:33:58] YOU WERE SO CLEAN, YOU WERE WALKING ON
[1:34:00] CLOUDS, TWO OR THREE DAYS LATER, HE
[1:34:03] STUMBLED YOU AGAIN. OH, WELL, I GUESS
[1:34:05] YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO START BACK AT
[1:34:07] zero all over again. That's not true.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; I want to break that lie. That's not
[1:34:15] true.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Leviticus 26
[1:34:19] uh 7-9. You can catch up to me, brother
[1:34:22] Mark, if you want. And ye shall chase
[1:34:24] your enemies. Leviticus 26:7-9. Ye shall
[1:34:27] chase your enemies, and they SHALL FALL
[1:34:29] BEFORE YOU BY THE SWORD. AND FIVE of you
[1:34:33] shall chase a hundred and a hundred OF
[1:34:35] YOU SHALL PUT 10,000 TO flight and your
[1:34:39] enemies SHALL FALL BEFORE YOU BY THE
[1:34:41] sword for I will have respect unto you
[1:34:45] and make you fruitful and multiply you
[1:34:48] and establish my covenant with you. So,
[1:34:51] so actually that in the in the amplified
[1:34:53] that ninth VERSE SAYS, "I WILL BE
[1:34:55] leaning toward you with favor and regard
[1:34:58] for you, rendering you fruitful,
[1:35:01] MULTIPLYING YOU AND ESTABLISHING AND
[1:35:04] RATIFYING MY covenant with you."
[1:35:06] Deuteronomy 32:es
[1:35:09] 30 to 31. How should one chase a
[1:35:13] thousand
[1:35:15] and TWO PUT 10,000 TO FLIGHT except
[1:35:18] their rock had sold them? Their their
[1:35:21] false gods that they had trusted in.
[1:35:23] Their rock had sold them and the Lord
[1:35:26] had shut them up for their rock is not
[1:35:29] as our rock. Now, BOTH OF THESE PASSAGES
[1:35:34] ACTUALLY SHOW A A A 5X A 400%
[1:35:40] jump in effectiveness.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Per person.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; IT'S A 5X PER PERSON.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; You understand? When when the Lord IS
[1:35:51] WITH THEM. SO, WHAT WE FIND IS IS THAT
[1:35:54] WHEN YOU'RE ON the Lord's side, uh
[1:35:57] [screaming]
[1:35:58] the math changes. HALLELUJAH.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? WHEN YOU'RE ON THE
[1:36:02] LORD'S SIDE, THE MATH CHANGES. HIS
[1:36:05] KINGDOM IS NOT ONE TO ONE.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? NOW, BROTHER BRANDON
[1:36:08] PICKS THAT UP IN THE MESSAGE. WHY? 1961.
[1:36:12] What he could DO IF HE COULD EVER GET
[1:36:14] ONE PERSON IN HIS GRIP JUST SO HE CAN
[1:36:17] HOLD THAT ONE PERSON. HE CAN PUT 10,000
[1:36:20] TO FLIGHT WITH THAT ONE PERSON. NOW,
[1:36:23] BROTHER BRANDHAM HAS ACTUALLY EXED IT UP
[1:36:25] AGAIN. NOW, IT'S NOT TWO CHASING 10,000.
[1:36:27] IT'S ONE. SEE, WITH ONE PERSON IN
[1:36:30] GENUINE FAITH, HE CAN PUT 10,000 DEVILS
[1:36:34] RUNNING AS HARD AS THEY CAN GO. I'D LIKE
[1:36:37] TO BE THAT PERSON. OH, I'D [screaming]
[1:36:38] LIKE TO BE THAT PERSON. HAVE 10,000
[1:36:40] DEVILS RUNNING AWAY FROM ME AS HARD AS
[1:36:43] THEY CAN GO.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. OH MY. PRAYER
[1:36:48] FROM A SAINT WILL GO A MILLION TIMES
[1:36:51] HIGHER THAN AN ANGEL.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT THAT. THE PRAYER FROM ONE
[1:36:56] SAINT WILL GO A MILLION TIMES HIGHER
[1:37:01] THAN AN ANGEL BECAUSE HE'S A SON. YOUR
[1:37:05] SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD PREDESTINATED
[1:37:08] US. NOW WATCH UH JUST A MINUTE.
[1:37:11] ACCORDING HE'S GOING TO READ EPHESIANS.
[1:37:13] ACCORDING AS HE HATH CHOSEN US IN HIM. I
[1:37:16] love it. You ready? Now we didn't
[1:37:18] choose. See how could I choose him?
[1:37:24] Here we go.
[1:37:26] 400 BILLION MILLION BILLION TRILLION
[1:37:29] YEARS AGO.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; That's a lot. I like to see that zero is
[1:37:35] wrote out. 400 BILLION MILLION BILLION
[1:37:39] TRILLION YEARS AGO. How could I have
[1:37:42] chosen him? But he chose me.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; CHOSEN US IN HIM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION
[1:37:49] OF THE WORLD THAT WE should be holy.
[1:37:54] Now don't try to make yourself because
[1:37:58] you can't
[1:38:00] AND WITHOUT HIM WITHOUT BLAME BEFORE HIM
[1:38:04] IN LOVE. YOU CAN SEE WHY THE WORKS OF
[1:38:07] THE FLESH HAVE ALMOST NO VALUE OF YOU
[1:38:11] TRYING TO USE YOUR OWN HUMAN WILL
[1:38:12] through gritted teeth THROUGH CHRISTIAN
[1:38:14] PSYCHOLOGY THROUGH DISCIPLINE OR LIVING
[1:38:17] IN A MONASTERY OR MEMORIZING SCRIPTURE
[1:38:19] VERSES UH BECOME A WALKING QUOTE
[1:38:22] MACHINE. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU CAN'T
[1:38:24] MAKE YOURSELF PERFECT. HE HAS ALREADY
[1:38:26] JUDGED YOU PERFECT HAS ALREADY JOINED
[1:38:29] YOU TOGETHER TO HIM IN LOVE.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? SO WHEN IT COMES TO
[1:38:34] GOD'S FAMILY MEMBERS, THE FAMILY MEMBERS
[1:38:37] OF HIS KINGDOM, remember he REMEMBER HE
[1:38:39] CAN'T RESPECT PERSONS. HE'S NO RESPECTOR
[1:38:41] OF PERSONS.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; BUT YET WE JUST READ HE TOLD ISRAEL, I
[1:38:44] WILL RESPECT YOU AND SHOW YOU FAVOR.
[1:38:46] BECAUSE NO RESPECTOR OF PERSONS, IT
[1:38:48] MEANS THAT INSIDE THE FAMILY OF GOD, IF
[1:38:50] HE EVER HAD, IF MOSES EVER DID SOMETHING
[1:38:53] AND GOT GOD'S FAVOR AND I DID THE SAME
[1:38:55] THING, I'M IN THE FAMILY WITH MOSES. I
[1:38:57] CAN GET HIS FAVOR. BUT NEVER MAKE A
[1:38:59] MISTAKE OF BELIEVING THAT GOD DOESN'T
[1:39:01] FAVOR YOU, HIS ELECT, JEAN, HIS FAMILY,
[1:39:04] THE APPLE OF [screaming] HIS EYE. HE
[1:39:06] MOST CERTAINLY DOES FAVOR YOU. AND IT'S
[1:39:08] NOT UNFAIR TO THE WORLD. BUT YOU CAME
[1:39:11] FROM HIM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE
[1:39:13] WORLD. 400 BILLION MILLION BILLION
[1:39:15] TRILLION YEARS AGO. YOU WERE ALREADY IN
[1:39:18] HIM AND ALREADY PERFECT.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; SEE, SO THAT IT'S NOT ONE TO ONE. I'M
[1:39:24] LITERALLY LIVING IN A REALITY.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE CALL THIS THE RA THE THE THE
[1:39:29] THE THE THE RACE OF LIFE. YOU KNOW, PAUL
[1:39:33] TALKS ABOUT WE'RE IN A RACE AND MANY run
[1:39:36] but ONE WINS THE PRIZE. REMEMBER THAT.
[1:39:38] SO, SO NOW WHEN I REALIZE THAT I'M
[1:39:41] LIVING IN A in a reality OF 400 BILLION
[1:39:45] MILLION, BILLION TRILLION MILES AHEAD of
[1:39:48] the devil.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; And my life's journey.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; That's how far ahead of him
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; I am.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; What am I trying to say to you this
[1:39:58] morning? Make up your mind to serve God
[1:40:03] today. Amen.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; And once you give him control of all thy
[1:40:08] soul and with all thy mind and with all
[1:40:12] thy strength, you yet you stumble
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; out of THE GATE.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; TOMORROW,
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; TODAY YOU'RE GIVING HIM YOUR WHOLE MIND,
[1:40:22] YOUR WHOLE HEART, YOUR WHOLE
[1:40:24] UNDERSTANDING, YOUR WHOLE STRENGTH, YOUR
[1:40:25] WHOLE EVERYTHING. BUT IF TOMORROW YOU
[1:40:28] STUMBLE COMING OUT OF THE GATE, JUST
[1:40:30] REMEMBER YOU'RE STILL 400 BILLION
[1:40:34] MILLION BILLION TRILLION MILES AHEAD OF
[1:40:36] THE DEVIL. AND ALL I HAVE TO DO IS GET
[1:40:39] DOWN AND BOW MY HEAD AND BOW MY HEART
[1:40:42] AND BOW MY KNEE AND REPENT AND I STAND
[1:40:44] BACK UP. [screaming] I DON'T GO BACK TO
[1:40:46] ZERO. I'M STILL 400 BILLION MILLION
[1:40:50] BILLION TRILLION MILES [screaming]
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; AHEAD OF THE DEVIL. THE VICTORY YOU
[1:40:56] SECURE TODAY WILL BE YOUR VICTORY
[1:40:58] TOMORROW AND NEXT WEEK AND NEXT MONTH
[1:41:01] AND NEXT YEAR. HOW MANY PEOPLE WANT TO
[1:41:03] HAVE THAT KIND OF VICTORY?
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; STAND UP WITH ME.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; IF THAT'S A REAL DESIRE OF YOUR HEART TO
[1:41:11] HAVE THAT KIND OF VICTORY in your life,
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; then here's here's your remedy. See,
[1:41:19] here's your remedy
[1:41:22] right from our text.
[1:41:29] Thou shalt love the Lord God
[1:41:33] with all your heart.
[1:41:36] How many are willing?
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; All your soul,
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; all your mind,
[1:41:44] all your strength,
[1:41:46] all your understanding,
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; no matter what the word is challenging
[1:41:52] you to today. Let's bow our heads all
[1:41:53] over the building.
[1:41:58] I have not spent
[1:42:01] the last 80 minutes
[1:42:04] preaching to you out of a sorcery book.
[1:42:08] This isn't hocus pocus.
[1:42:11] This is a real power [music] that's real
[1:42:15] and effective.
[1:42:17] And if you are standing there today and
[1:42:20] you're willing to say, "Lord God, I give
[1:42:23] you all my heart. I give you all my
[1:42:26] soul. I give you all my mind. I give you
[1:42:29] all my strength." You might not be
[1:42:31] willing,
[1:42:33] but if you are, why don't you raise up
[1:42:35] those hands to God and say, "Lord, all
[1:42:38] of me. I'm raising up both of mine. I
[1:42:40] want a fresh surrender today. Lord, I'm
[1:42:43] glad, Father. I'm so glad. Boy, am I
[1:42:45] ever glad that your kingdom's [music]
[1:42:47] not one to one. And I'm sure glad you
[1:42:49] multiply.
[1:42:51] Oh God, if I think about the years that
[1:42:53] I spent, how many years it would have
[1:42:55] taken you to clean me up. Oh my
[1:42:57] goodness, [music] how much time would
[1:42:58] have been wasted. But you cleaned me in
[1:43:01] a moment. You filled me with your life.
[1:43:03] [music] You put me on the path. You put
[1:43:06] me into service even before I was even
[1:43:08] felt ready to be put into service
[1:43:10] because that's how you roll. You you
[1:43:12] take your servants, you put them on, you
[1:43:14] go ahead and stick them in service, and
[1:43:16] then you finish up their training on the
[1:43:18] job. I've been training for a long time,
[1:43:21] Lord. I still feel like a student,
[1:43:23] but I want to know you and your power
[1:43:25] and your resurrection. [music]
[1:43:27] I I trust that this word today goes out
[1:43:30] across this building and across the
[1:43:32] airwaves to hearts and minds of your
[1:43:34] people
[1:43:36] who will say, "Lord, I've got to win the
[1:43:38] battle of my soul.
[1:43:41] And then I want to win the battle of my
[1:43:43] mind.
[1:43:44] I want to give you [clears throat] my
[1:43:46] whole heart and all my strength [music]
[1:43:49] and all my objectives and all my
[1:43:52] determinations. I'm looking ahead down
[1:43:54] the path. I don't see how in the world
[1:43:55] I'll pull it off, but I'm offering
[1:43:57] [music] it to you now. And I'm asking
[1:43:59] you to make the effective changes in my
[1:44:01] life. Is that your desire today? You
[1:44:04] don't have to have all the answers,
[1:44:06] friends. You don't have to figure it all
[1:44:07] out. You just want to raise up a hand
[1:44:09] and say, "God, have mercy on me.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Look down in my life and figure it out
[1:44:12] for me, LORD. PUT ME ON your path. I
[1:44:16] can't fix what's behind me, BUT I CAN GO
[1:44:18] FORWARD in victory.
[1:44:20] I commit myself a new to you, master. I
[1:44:24] trust that this word has been a [music]
[1:44:25] benefit to your people. I've delivered
[1:44:27] it for sure. For sure
[1:44:32] according to the dictates of my heart,
[1:44:33] what I felt [music] honest and that's
[1:44:36] the truth. My faith is perfect in
[1:44:39] everything that was said today and I
[1:44:41] give it to you now to [music] the Holy
[1:44:43] Ghost in Jesus name. Amen. Let's sing
[1:44:47] before we go. Have a little worship.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; I surrender.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; The lighter my load,
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; the lighter
[1:44:59] [music] my Lord,
[1:45:03] the more that I release [music] my
[1:45:07] cares,
[1:45:08] the more he takes [singing]
[1:45:11] control.
[1:45:14] Oh, the more [music] that I can offer
[1:45:18] myself,
[1:45:20] the more [singing]
[1:45:22] he lifts [music] me up.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; So every day
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; and every day I live.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Every day, [music]
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, I love
[1:45:33] [singing]
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; more than I surrender. Come on, let's
[1:45:36] sing it.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; More than I surrender. [music]
[1:45:39] More [singing]
[1:45:39] than I surrender.
[1:45:43] singer
[1:45:46] [music]
[1:45:46] my Lord. The more the more the more
[1:45:50] [music] that I [singing] release my
[1:45:54] tears, the more [music] retain control.
[1:46:02] the [singing] more that I can
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; to every word humble to every word
[1:46:07] [music]
[1:46:09] lift me up
[1:46:12] and every [music and singing] day I live
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; I love
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; I want you to listen to [music] some of
[1:46:20] these verses now give us some verses
[1:46:21] brother Tom think about these anointed
[1:46:24] words
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; and it gets [music] easier
[1:46:27] to understand
[1:46:31] the road I'm [music] traveling down.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, Sister Brenda wrote those words.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; No more wondering.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; This is a veteran sister. [music]
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; She knew what it meant to fight for the
[1:46:43] Lord.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; Standing on.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; She knew what it meant to have victory.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Now I know
[1:46:51] to my [music] future home.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; The voice,
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; the voice I [singing] hear is yours.
[1:47:00] Every [music] day I live,
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; I Lord I love [music]
[1:47:06] more.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's give him a wave offering now.
[1:47:08] The more that I surrender, [music]
[1:47:11] the [singing] more that I surrender,
[1:47:17] the lighter [music]
[1:47:19] [singing]
[1:47:20] my Lord. Think about it. The more
[1:47:23] [music] that I [singing]
[1:47:26] release my hands, the more [music]
[1:47:30] retain [singing]
[1:47:31] control.
[1:47:34] The more that I can humble
[1:47:38] [music and singing] myself,
[1:47:40] the more he lifts me up.
[1:47:45] And every [music]
[1:47:46] day I [singing] live.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Lord, Lord, I love that verse. I love
[1:47:51] you more. Amen. [music]
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; I love these verses. They're so
[1:47:55] powerful.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; The problems I had on yesterday [music]
[1:48:02] are mere stepping stones. Can you
[1:48:05] believe that?
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; To a higher place.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Those [music] trials that seem so
[1:48:11] awesome to me are now [music]
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; are now my better
[1:48:18] standing. I know it's better. And I know
[1:48:20] I'm to [music] my
[1:48:24] home.
[1:48:25] Voice I hear is yours the Lord.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Every day.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Every [music] day I live.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Lord I love you more. [singing]
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; More than I surrender.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; More than I surrender. [music]
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; I surrender.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Lighter my Lord. [music]
[1:48:48] I
[1:48:50] [singing]
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; more that I release my care.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; More I [music and singing]
[1:48:55] release my
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, he takes control.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; He takes control.
