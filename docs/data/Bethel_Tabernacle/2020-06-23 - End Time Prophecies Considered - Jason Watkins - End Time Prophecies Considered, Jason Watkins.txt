========================================

[Music] for the JD is out of town and actually may end up being gone over the next several weekends so brother Matt and I are gonna tag-team a little bit and fill in for that I kind of have a two-fold purpose in my heart today not to just bring up a Sunday School lesson but also to kind of update the church on where we are on a number of issues some things I want to make some announcements on that'd be all right so let's let's um let's go to Matthew chapter 24 excuse me I'll get cleared up here in a minute and we'll start at verse 3 and as he sat upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you that's a good warning isn't it for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you be not troubled and that a beautiful promise see that ye be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation the king and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places all these are the beginning of Sorrows then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that endured to unto the end the same shall be saved and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come let's bow our heads we thank you most kindly Lord this morning our great friend and protector our great Savior and our healer our Redeemer the lifter up of my hands Lord I just thank you this morning and I just would like to say at the reading of this word Lord I'm so glad that you promised there'd be a solution to all the madness of the world you promised that you would never leave us nor forsake us it was such a promise Lord I will never leave you Lord what a promise that is so I'm asking today that you come and speak to us out of your word Lord we we love ministering the word it's it's my whole life I've dedicated my whole life to it Lord and so many times how faithful you are over the years always Lord you bring a fresh manna to the people I thank you for that we thank you for those gathered here today for those who aren't allowed to gather with us today who would no doubt be here then Lord we're praying now in these troubles some unsettling times that you give us peace that passes understanding that you that you Lord and just give us an increase of that we know it's a promise to us may just turn up the volume a little bit Lord I pray to settle our hearts and minds that we may only only look to your word and all your promises for they're all true all your word is true and all your ways are right we thank you now and ask that we be dedicated to you for service today in Jesus name Amen god bless friends you can be seated it's an amazing reading that we have taken here and you know the the to me when I began to read Matthew 24 with its ominous foreboding prophecies that are coming upon the world there are several things that have always historically stand out to me and I would say that today like no other day before they stand out even more so that one of the first observations that I make in this is that you know Jesus is warning against deception in fact when you read down through that where we read this morning you can see the spirit that would afflict the ages of the Gentile Church going forward because the very first horse rider is a white horse and we know that the that the fact that he took it as a white horse was God it's not that Satan is riding a white horse you understand God showed John a white horse as a symbology as a symbolism of the characteristics of the Antichrist spirit in that first age and because it was white it would tend to make you think purity holiness righteousness this must be Jesus Christ when in fact just the opposite was true so actually it became the the deception you couldn't get it's God saying you know I'm going to let me all through heaven and let me pick a symbol and I all through the book of Revelation when John writes it later you're going to see a lot of symbols so I I want to go through my book of symbols and I want to pick the the one that would describe deception the most that I couldn't possibly use a greater symbol now you would think he would have chose maybe a snake or rat or something like that something that would deceive something that's sneaky something that's destructive but if you'll recognize Jesus knowing that at the end of the Tribulation Period that the king of kings would ride out on a white horse and the armies of heaven the bride would literally follow with him now if he's going to use the Lord Jesus himself as king of kings and Lord of lords and all the bride the armies of heaven on white horses and that's going to represent that's the simple he chooses for the highest pinnacle of purity honesty holiness perfection then what better symbol could he choose if he wanted to to warn his church that equal to Christ in His righteousness the Antichrist will be in his deceiving so he literally picks a white horse which means it's a deceiver and Satan goes forth to deceive and Jesus is warning this is one of the right out of the box the disciples are asking him about the end of the world one of these things coming and all you've you've said a lot of bad things when is all this going to happen and he right out of the box he's going to say listen take heed don't take heed first about wars don't take heed about riots don't take don't worry so much about upheaval you're gonna always have that you're gonna see earthquakes you're gonna see nature convulsing you're gonna see signs in the heaven you're gonna see insanity in the world but here is the first thing I want to tell my church be careful because it'll be so easy to be deceived that not only will men go forth claiming to be me he was saying there will actually be a whole lot of them not only will there be a false prophet there's gonna be a lot of them and guess what as if I can't make it any worse here's making it worse they're gonna deceive many people you know what you talk about a prophet sometimes and people just from a position of ignorance and lack of teaching you know I don't say that disparaging that it's being a lack of teaching that day you begin to talk about a prophet and they say always and they're supposed to be a false prophet and I'm like no they're supposed to be a lot of them and guess what they're gonna deceive a whole lot of people in fact is there's gonna be so many they're gonna end up deceiving the majority of the world and then as if that's not bad enough then there's gonna be Wars there's gonna be rumors of wars there's gonna be pestilences there's gonna be diseases and plagues and earthquakes and signs in nature and the and the world is going to go through constant upheaval and trouble because my prophets words have gotten to come to pass man born of a woman is but a few days and full of trouble so it's it's it almost you know that's why sometimes when when Jesus sent them into the world and and you know everybody has this notion if we could just get the whole world to be Christians if we get this get this country you know to all be Christians and receive the God oh we could save it brother BAM said put a George Washington and an Abraham Lincoln in every single County you won't turn it around the gospel didn't come to save the world the gospel came to save man out of the world the world is going to be destroyed as we know it now the Earth's not going to be annihilated even times not going to end when the rapture comes even at the end of the tribulation and God just simply gonna pull his bride out of the world and let Satan have at it and that pale horse riders going to be all the deception of the white horse all of the murderous spirit of the red horse all of the dark ages of the black horse and and he's going to be all rolled up into one pale grizzly horse in it and that that pale grizzly colored horse means sickly the combination of all of these demon powers that have gotten to practice in two thousand years are going to bring their training book and all of their knowledge and come down head-and-shoulders to the world at the end time and it's going to be it's going to be such a combination of of religious and political and demon power that it's going to literally bring sickness upon the world not just physical diseases that they already have more than they have answers for and they've got ones coming that make the ones they have now seem like nothing not just physical sickness mental sickness spiritual sickness emotional sickness you know financial political every kind of that you're living in an age of sickness and the pale horse riders the world ought to be glad because as sick as everything is they haven't seen anything once the bride goes your presence is hindering his full authoritative ride he can't ride in his full string a profit come according to revelation unidentified him said his and the Bible calls him death and hell followed him and a prophet comes on the scene and identifies who that is to this age and and but that's that's as far as it got and identified his workings he certainly mounted but he cannot begin his full ride because he that letteth that's Christ will let until he in the bride misses Jesus be taken out of the way and then all of these all of these things that have been in a measure to the world that's why you see such an upheaval that's why you see such a heaping up you know Jesus talked about Paul talked about perilous times I've said this before Paul was an absent of perilous times when he said in the last days perilous times shall come he was an absent of perilous times at that time so then the only conclusion you can come to sensibly is that Paul was saying hey when it gets to the end right near the catching away you're talking about perilous what we have now is nothing compared to what hey you're there you're living in it you're living what Paul's day told would come here I'm gonna take something friends if there was ever a time to be close to God if there was ever a time to have your life filled under the full control of the Holy Ghost you can certainly be born again of the Spirit of God and not very spiritually healthy if you if the baptism of the Holy Ghost finished you as a product you would have already been raptured you wouldn't need to read your Bible and pray but you do and you're still here and you do need to read your Bible and pray you do need to attend church you do need the fellowship of the sinks you do need to hear the tapes you do need to to have faith amen because we are facing unprecedented time and with that unprecedented errors it has never before in the history of the Christian Church from the earliest days of the Upper Room through the ministry of st. Paul all the way out to John the last apostle to go home all through the ages and every star that came out of his right hand including the last one it has never been suggested to the true church that you should just stay at home and push play that is unprecedented in Christian history no prophet ever suggested such a thing Paul never suggested you did that the church stay at home and read his letters his advice was go and assemble that God has raised up apostles and prophets and pastors and teachers and evangelists and their function is for the perfecting and the edifying of the Saints and the church it has never been suggested nor was it suggested even remotely by the last day prophet not even a shadow not a third cousin removed twice never ever that is a false doctrine it is an anti word teaching the prophet of God of this day said if it's anti word its Antichrist I love brother branham's ability and we should mirror it to never brother Branham was talking said I'm not talking about the people I'm talking about the system I'm not up here today calling out people I'm calling out a teaching that's an error that's a Antichrist teaching and no doubt very good well minded well-intentioned people are propagating that but I'm here to tell you it's a lie it's a trick of the devil and it was never taught from Paul to William Branham ever in fact is the polar opposite which you can't get more opposite than polar opposite the polar opposite is true the complete inverse is true that brother Branham and Paul bookending the Church agents with prophets cried out to the people that you need a pastor you need a church you need fellowship you need to assemble you need to come together so I know today I'm preaching to the choir when I preach on this if I wasn't preaching to the choir you wouldn't be here I know I'm preaching to the choir but I also know that that is a burgeoning thought among people and my heart full of love loves them too much to leave them uninformed that that is a false teaching and the people who are teaching it need to repent of it we already have perilous times we already have everything that Jesus prophesied already multiplied the last thing we need is such a divisive error among the bride as that let me tell you something friends let me tell you something today I want to make this statement stick with tape teaching I almost say that again I should have had a hundred percent stay with tape teaching tape teaching tells you to assemble with a shepherd tape teaching upholds the entire fivefold ministry until Lord calls us home that is tape teaching please ignore me stay with tape teaching I'm so glad we have a perfect Bible I'm so glad we have 1200 tapes to make sure that we stay lined up because if we doesn't have they said oh we don't need those well if you didn't have those 1200 plus tapes you don't want you to have you'd have 2,000 years of theory on what these old ancient letters implied you'd have two thousand years of good men good men very fine men in errors even God's some of his church age messengers unfailing to understand things like the Godhead incorrect baptism even though the Bible says in the concerning the name of Jesus there's no other name given under heaven that you can even be saved by and yet God's very stars in his hand misunderstood and failed to catch that and preach the Trinitarian understanding God rich in mercy winked at their ignorance he had to he couldn't he couldn't show respect to persons he had winked at Israel's ignorance Paul said that hey acts 13 yeah you sixteen hundred years you had a system you abused it God winked at your ignorance but now Christ has come now the fullness is here now he requires all men to repent that's the same thing that's happened at this last day the seals have been open and now God says no more winking in ignorance I've sent you a message I've tied but I've made this become thus saith the Lord to you I've made it a living book I've made it a fresh kill there's no more excuse so if you didn't have 1200 tapes you'd be just as twisted off off down of trails as the rest of the denominational world I'm glad for 1200 tapes I'm glad that that you have a surety you can go to if I go into error I would advise you listen to them listen to that tape open your Bible read along the Prophet was a word prophet you'll learn so much about your Bible if you listen to the tapes it's amazing I mean believers never listen to tapes and I don't know which is worse never or only they both do destructive they both have destructive byproducts that they bring in a believers life because one is they're both they're both underpowered because if that's that's what if that's what if you didn't need tapes to listen to God wouldn't have gave them to you and if you only needed that then God wouldn't have ever raised up a fivefold ministry God's not doesn't do things redundantly or for no purpose so the whole thing is insensible you you you you can't even make the scripture and that's why brother Branham was so clear on this subject I'm gonna take some friends I love this that in the last verse we read and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world that's this gospel that's not you that the word the end of the world couldn't have come if the message hadn't come because this gospel he's referring to 2,000 years ago got lost and before the end of the world that gospel would have to come back and we have it thank God now this gospel is that gospel that this is this and we have it and it's going around the world blessed be the name of the Lord and now the end can come and I am so thrilled to be a part of that amen god bless you let's stand father we thank you for your word thank you for your kindness to come Lord with your anointing felt it Lord just as soon as I walked up felt your direction and leadership taking no thought of my own nothing that I said today from my very text to the last word of stand up none of it was planned not a single word of it so I thank you for that in Jesus name Amen god bless you friends we'll have a recess and we'll get started with the regular service god bless
