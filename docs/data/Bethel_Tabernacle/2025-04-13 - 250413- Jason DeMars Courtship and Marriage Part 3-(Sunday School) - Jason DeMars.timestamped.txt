[0:00] Amen.
[0:01] As message believers, we have certainly
[0:03] been impacted by these cultural
[0:05] developments.
[0:07] Um,
[0:09] it doesn't seem that we've necessarily
[0:11] followed exactly suit with how the world
[0:14] has done it, but there's been sort of
[0:16] like some,
[0:18] like I said last time, uh, right-wing
[0:23] people aren't setting their feet in
[0:25] stone and saying, "This is what I
[0:26] believe. This is where I stand." There's
[0:29] sort of like the left is going this way
[0:31] and the right is following
[0:33] that way. And I I think I would say as
[0:37] message believers instead of saying this
[0:39] is what the word of God says. I plant my
[0:41] feet here and this is where we go. We've
[0:44] said, "Oh, the world's doing it this
[0:46] way. Okay, they're going left. We'll go
[0:49] this way with them." And there's a
[0:51] there's a there's a great danger like
[0:54] that. I don't know. You you can do
[0:55] whatever you want to do in your own home
[0:57] and your own family, but I want to do my
[0:59] best to follow the word of God and to
[1:01] protect myself and save those save my
[1:04] children from the heartache and the pain
[1:07] that they would go go through should
[1:10] they do it the way the word world is
[1:12] doing it.
[1:17] Obviously, we don't necessarily see a
[1:19] widespread casual dating jumping from
[1:22] person to person. um around the message,
[1:25] but social media has definitely caused a
[1:28] great shift in how things are done. Um
[1:32] maybe not so much
[1:34] somewhat Facebook for some demographics,
[1:36] but most uh demographics, it's Instagram
[1:40] and Snapchat.
[1:42] And th the advent of those things has
[1:45] really brought forth a totally different
[1:48] system in many ways.
[1:57] There seems to be there seems to have
[2:00] been become sort of a phase where you
[2:03] take social media whatever form it is um
[2:07] me messaging how you know I I don't keep
[2:11] up too much with all this stuff but in
[2:14] other words kids are using their phone
[2:16] to get in touch with each other and find
[2:17] out whether they would be interested in
[2:19] each other instead of following doing
[2:22] the order that the word would say to do
[2:25] it. They're trying to bypass that in a
[2:28] private way. And there is emotional
[2:31] attachment taking place outside of the
[2:34] area of protection where God would place
[2:37] that.
[2:38] How would I ever know if I'm interested
[2:40] in them if I don't text them or talk to
[2:42] them on the phone?
[2:44] Logical.
[2:48] You saw them at the youth camp. You saw
[2:50] them at special meetings. You're
[2:51] interested now. Suddenly, they're
[2:53] popping up on your snap Snapchat. So,
[2:56] I'm going to start communicating with
[2:58] them.
[2:59] Okay.
[3:06] Plus, there's also this fear that people
[3:08] have is, well, if I make every boy talk
[3:11] to my dad before we start Snapchatting,
[3:13] it's going to be awkward and
[3:15] uncomfortable. It's supposed to be.
[3:22] It's absolutely 100% supposed to be
[3:24] because this is a absolutely reverent. I
[3:27] don't know about you, I treat my
[3:29] daughters
[3:31] with great reverence because I I want
[3:34] them to be delivered to the young man
[3:38] that God has ordained for them. Don't
[3:40] don't turn too red, girls. I'll just
[3:43] make it general. If if I was a father of
[3:46] girls, I would want to make sure, and
[3:48] I'm sure you would, too, that they were
[3:51] delivered in purity and in righteousness
[3:55] to a young man, having been protected
[3:58] and h having been honored by their
[3:59] father,
[4:01] knowing that this is what they'll demand
[4:02] from the person that they're going to
[4:04] spend their life with.
[4:06] Amen.
[4:07] And it's supposed to be awkward because
[4:09] young men are supposed to take be able
[4:10] to take the risks and do the difficult
[4:13] things and face the challenges. And if
[4:15] the young man is too much of a coward to
[4:18] face the father
[4:21] of a girl that he likes, maybe he's not
[4:23] the right one for you.
[4:28] God bless you. I hope you still love me.
[4:31] as brother Luther would say.
[4:37] And of course, there's this there's
[4:39] become this talking phase. There's a
[4:42] non-serious deciding if you want to take
[4:44] the next step of being in serious
[4:47] courtship.
[4:49] Now, I'll back up um blowing up my time
[4:52] just a little bit, but I'll back up and
[4:54] say, you know, it should be normal
[4:56] amongst youth group for for young people
[5:00] to be friends, boys and girls to be
[5:03] friends, to talk to each other. And a if
[5:05] if a boy and a girl are talking, I would
[5:08] say in a public thing amongst a youth
[5:11] group or a get together at the home,
[5:13] please parents and everybody around,
[5:15] don't be weird and say, "Oh, you're
[5:18] getting married.
[5:20] You looked at a boy and talked to him
[5:22] and now you're getting married. Let's
[5:23] let's stop being dumb." Because when we
[5:27] do that then it makes it then then we
[5:29] you know it's it is funny but at the
[5:31] same time it's serious because you
[5:33] create an an atmosphere where there is a
[5:36] fear to get to know each other in a
[5:38] public place and we have to do it
[5:39] private
[5:40] right
[5:41] why why that's wrong we want them to get
[5:45] to know each other in public in groups
[5:47] this is the proper way of doing it
[5:50] and we're good we should be good with
[5:52] that as parents
[5:53] we have to watch over it we have to use
[5:55] wisdom We have to be prayerful about it.
[5:57] We have to be a part of it.
[5:59] Very critical to be a part of it. And
[6:01] yet, this is the this is the area where
[6:04] in in healthy, positive, good
[6:06] relationships, kids can get to know, do
[6:09] we like each other?
[6:10] Right?
[6:10] And it it it doesn't need to be become
[6:13] this weird exclusive thing
[6:16] until God leads leads a young man down
[6:19] that road.
[6:34] um
[6:40] turning a corner a little bit, what
[6:43] what they're finding now is that
[6:46] basically the norm of meeting someone is
[6:49] not face to face in public. the norm of
[6:52] meeting someone is online,
[6:55] whether it's using dating apps or using
[6:58] social media. And so, it's somebody you
[7:00] might know uh from a public thing, and
[7:03] then you use the internet to make a
[7:06] connection that you're too scared to
[7:08] make face to face. Jenzie, please stop
[7:12] doing that.
[7:16] Stop being scared to talk to people face
[7:18] to face. and parents with Gen Z kids,
[7:22] please make them learn how to talk to
[7:25] people face to face, to adults, to look
[7:28] people in the eye, to be respectful.
[7:30] Force them to do it. If they don't want
[7:32] to put their phone, take their phone and
[7:34] put it in in the safe.
[7:37] Praise the Lord.
[7:41] So, there's a website called
[7:43] internetmatters.org. website founded in
[7:46] 2014 to stutter study internet usage by
[7:49] teens and to help parents increase
[7:51] safety for their children. Says
[7:53] according to teens the best and easiest
[7:54] way to meet and engage with love
[7:56] interest is through their social media
[7:57] accounts.
[7:59] And of course they're saying we're
[8:00] looking into the positive aspects of
[8:02] that. But th this is this is what the
[8:05] development has come to. Online
[8:08] relationships can remove barriers that
[8:11] children may have when meeting for the
[8:12] first time, and it allows those who are
[8:14] shy or socially anxious to develop their
[8:16] social skills in a space where they feel
[8:18] safe to do so. Although using so apps
[8:21] and online platforms can help children
[8:23] maintain relationships, concerns have
[8:26] been raised about teen safety when
[8:27] exploring romantic relationships
[8:30] online. What can seem be seen as
[8:33] harmless? A harmless chat can turn into
[8:36] something harmful. If a child is lacking
[8:38] in critical thinking or is considered
[8:40] vulnerable, it may be harder for them to
[8:42] spot. When a chat with a new friend can
[8:44] put them at risk of grooming or being
[8:47] lured into sending nudes, for example,
[8:50] this is this is a huge thing. We think
[8:53] of human trafficking and we think of it
[8:55] as well that only that only happens like
[8:58] at some gas station and some guy swoops
[9:00] up your kid. That's not what they do at
[9:02] all.
[9:03] And that's not how it works. It's almost
[9:05] always something that they're lured into
[9:08] online.
[9:11] They they they think they're talking to
[9:13] a teenage boy
[9:15] and he loves me. He's sent me this. He's
[9:18] done this for me. He's promised me all
[9:20] of these things. The heart is opened up.
[9:22] And they're like, "Come meet us over
[9:24] here
[9:26] and and we'll do something." Then they
[9:28] willingly go there and step by step
[9:32] they're lured into this lifestyle of
[9:36] prostitution.
[9:37] Think thinking at first that this is
[9:39] love. This is what love is.
[9:44] It's not smash and grab anymore. It is
[9:47] here. I'm giving you something that you
[9:49] really This is how the devil works. I'm
[9:51] giving you something that's really good
[9:52] that you'll really enjoy and really
[9:54] appreciate. Oh wow. This is wonderful.
[9:56] No one's ever talked to me like this. No
[9:58] one ever No one's ever seen me before. I
[10:01] really feel seen by this person that
[10:02] I've never seen before and never met and
[10:04] doesn't know me and is probably a dirty
[10:06] old man.
[10:12] One in five children are happy to have
[10:14] an online only romance. Onethird of 14
[10:18] to 17 year olds have sent uh sexual
[10:22] photos to someone they like. One-third
[10:24] of young people have started a
[10:26] relationship with someone they met
[10:27] online. Half of 14 to 17 year olds had
[10:30] at some point chatted online about the
[10:32] kinds of um various sexual things
[10:37] uh that they'd like to do with someone
[10:39] they're interested in. This opens young
[10:41] people up to blackmail, getting groomed,
[10:44] and being trafficked for the sex trade.
[10:47] Amen.
[10:51] According to Pew Research, most teens
[10:55] uh do not start the relationship online,
[10:57] but the social media is the main venue
[11:00] for getting it getting it moving. In
[11:02] other words, they might know him face to
[11:03] face, but they use social media because
[11:05] they're too scared to actually talk to
[11:06] him face to face.
[11:10] Let me skip forward a little bit.
[11:17] Even though you could say the majority
[11:18] of the time among young message
[11:20] believers, social media that social
[11:23] media aspect of communication is
[11:25] innocent, but it does add a layer of
[11:28] communication
[11:29] that can seem appropriate and start
[11:32] appropriate and move to a place that
[11:34] isn't appropriate. All right? Because
[11:37] it's done something done in secret.
[11:41] Jeremiah
[11:44] 17:9 says, "The heart is deceitful above
[11:46] all things and desperately wicked. Who
[11:48] can know it?" Yes, your sweet little
[11:51] kids. Their hearts are desperately
[11:53] wicked.
[11:55] And so are you.
[11:59] And the Bible says to abstain from all
[12:03] appearance of evil.
[12:08] Brother Brandham says, "Many times I go
[12:10] to houses and there are women standing
[12:12] out there and I go to the house, knock
[12:14] on the door, and a sister would come to
[12:15] the door. Come in, Brother Brandham. If
[12:17] her husband's not there, unless it's a
[12:19] case of sickness and somebody with me, I
[12:21] don't go."
[12:27] And then they call me to a hospital, to
[12:29] the room, say, "Brother Brandham, come
[12:30] over here. I'm sister so and so from so-
[12:32] and so. I'm here at the hotel. I brought
[12:34] my mother along. She's sick. I take my
[12:35] wife
[12:36] If I don't, I take some other brother.
[12:38] See, I don't I I don't think I think it
[12:41] would be all right for me to go in
[12:42] there. But what if somebody's seen me go
[12:44] in there? See, what if somebody seen me
[12:46] do it? That see then the first thing you
[12:48] know, they would say he went in there
[12:49] with that went in there where that woman
[12:52] was. He's chasing after women. That see
[12:54] that would be a thing I shouldn't do.
[12:56] See, should never do anything like that
[12:58] because he put a stumbling block in
[13:00] somebody else's way. See, I don't
[13:01] believe that I would do anything wrong
[13:03] in there. would I would and trust God to
[13:06] go in there no matter what the thing
[13:07] was. I would trust God. But yet, see, I
[13:10] love the Lord well enough till I
[13:11] wouldn't do it. It's a love. It's a love
[13:14] you have. You'll not do it because it's
[13:16] a duty to do it. You do it because you
[13:18] love the Lord. You don't have to do it,
[13:20] but you do it anyhow. We shouldn't put
[13:23] ourselves in a compromising position of
[13:27] being alone with a person of the
[13:29] opposite sex that you're not married to
[13:31] or related to. It leads to the
[13:33] appearance of evil and also can lead to
[13:36] many temptations.
[13:39] It can lead to a friendship that turns
[13:40] into an emotional attachment or even
[13:42] lead to sexual temptation.
[13:46] The standards that govern real life are
[13:51] the standards that govern govern virtual
[13:54] life. Right?
[13:58] How can how can we divide the two and
[14:00] say it's okay to do this this here, but
[14:02] it's not okay to do this here. Well, if
[14:05] that's the case, is it okay to look at
[14:07] pornography online? Then
[14:10] if it's not okay to do do that in real
[14:12] life and online, what about bypassing
[14:16] God's word online? Should we bypass it
[14:19] because we want to get to know somebody?
[14:23] You can do what you want with it,
[14:25] but
[14:27] Amen.
[14:28] I believe that the the the
[14:32] standards of the word of God that govern
[14:34] us in
[14:36] the real world
[14:38] will should govern us govern us in the
[14:41] virtual world. So whatever standards we
[14:44] have for relationships here face to
[14:47] face, same thing that we would do
[14:50] online.
[14:52] And whose job is it to oversee that if
[14:56] you're a young person
[14:58] govern if you've heard the truth,
[15:00] obey the truth. Live it. But parents,
[15:04] it's our duty and job to be the pastors
[15:07] of our children.
[15:08] Amen.
[15:10] We we're the ones that should know what
[15:12] they're doing online, what they're doing
[15:14] on their phone. We should set the
[15:16] standards of what social media is
[15:17] allowed or isn't allowed based on their
[15:20] ages. And we should be consistent about
[15:22] it and use wisdom and oversee
[15:25] everything. Just as you would oversee a
[15:27] relationship between a young man and a
[15:30] young lady,
[15:32] you uh in real life,
[15:35] you do the same thing in virtual life.
[15:38] Amen.
[15:40] this. I hope that makes sense.
[15:44] All right, we're going to close there.
[15:46] That's a That's a good spot to finish.
[15:49] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[15:50] word. We thank you for your light and
[15:53] your life. We pray that you'd quicken
[15:54] yourself to us. You be glorified among
[15:57] us. We commit ourselves to you. We ask
[15:58] it in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you.
