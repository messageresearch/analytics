[50:18] i'm we're we're continuing to work on
[50:21] you know what is the church of god
[50:24] and uh this would be i think part five
[50:27] um that i've ministered here we
[50:29] ministered a little bit of it
[50:31] in in phoenix last weekend
[50:34] the lord is just seeming to bless my
[50:36] heart and thank you for the tony uh
[50:37] continuing to bless my heart in it we've
[50:39] been on it since actually uh the latter
[50:42] part of last year we started on it
[50:44] before our watch nights are not our
[50:46] watch night but our communion and foot
[50:48] washing service on the last night and
[50:50] we've carried on into this new year and
[50:52] uh the lord has more to say um i thought
[50:55] i might finish it today i don't know i
[50:57] don't think i will we're not gonna try
[50:59] i'm just gonna go to an allotted time
[51:02] and then we'll pull the shoot and stand
[51:04] on the brakes and amen we don't well i
[51:06] never like to over tax your mind because
[51:09] then you forget things that you get over
[51:11] sponge and
[51:12] you you lose
[51:14] what the main thing i wanted you to
[51:15] remember and uh you know i remember
[51:17] years ago many years ago when i was just
[51:19] starting out uh brother biscuit giving
[51:21] me some advice as a young minister
[51:24] and he said you know he's always over
[51:25] the years he was always astonished to
[51:28] see such a lack of wisdom in some
[51:30] ministry
[51:31] that when it's obvious the people are
[51:34] done they're saturated they can't and
[51:35] they just keep going keep going keep
[51:37] going keep going and like brother dale
[51:39] says there's no death worse than being
[51:41] drugged to death
[51:43] amen so we don't want to drag you this
[51:45] morning but we do want to look into the
[51:47] word of god
[51:48] amen so i ended last time
[51:52] and i uh
[51:53] in part four
[51:55] by reminding you that you know we have
[51:58] choices to make
[52:00] um you know and god does things for us
[52:03] and he has intent for our life and god
[52:06] god intends good for his family do you
[52:08] believe that he doesn't intend evil god
[52:11] sometimes the world looks upon that so
[52:13] upside down god doesn't take pleasure in
[52:16] uh in corrective measures he does it out
[52:19] of love because he's trying to make you
[52:21] into a better uh version of himself
[52:25] all right and so you know i was i was
[52:28] testifying
[52:29] to the brothers uh in the in the men's
[52:32] breakfast yesterday
[52:34] are there somewhere i don't remember i
[52:36] ministered too often i never remember
[52:37] where i say things but
[52:40] how that you know i was thinking along
[52:42] the lines of this sermon and
[52:45] in my in my quest
[52:47] you know to be
[52:49] to be everything that god wants me to be
[52:52] and i i don't want to
[52:54] excuse me
[52:56] i don't want to find myself coming up
[52:58] short of everything god intends do you
[53:01] know you can do that see
[53:03] god can have a will for you but brother
[53:05] branham is very clear on that you can
[53:07] actually
[53:08] uh lose out and the bible calls it
[53:11] forsaking your own mercies and a lot of
[53:14] times god can have something for you you
[53:16] remember
[53:17] when the prophet in the old testament
[53:20] comes before the king i think it was
[53:22] elisha i believe
[53:24] and he he says to the king he says you
[53:26] know take your your bow and arrow and
[53:28] your quiver of arrows and strike it on
[53:31] the ground and he and the king just you
[53:34] know he's he's so lukewarm
[53:37] amen
[53:38] he's gonna obey the prophet okay he's a
[53:40] prophet i guess i better obey him but
[53:42] he's so lukewarm
[53:45] in his life
[53:46] that he just whacks the ground three
[53:48] times and stops and lays it down okay i
[53:50] obeyed you i obeyed the letter of what
[53:52] you said you said do it i did it now
[53:55] what and the prophet was angry
[53:58] and said oh you should have struck the
[54:00] ground five or six times
[54:03] because
[54:05] you were poised to completely eliminate
[54:07] the enemy and now all you're going to
[54:09] get is three victories you struck it
[54:12] three times you're gonna get three
[54:13] victories
[54:14] what the king couldn't realize is
[54:17] is that his actions were a message to
[54:19] god on what he thought about god's word
[54:23] how he respected god's prophet standing
[54:27] in front of him
[54:29] excuse me my
[54:32] medication chokes me up in the morning i
[54:34] apologize
[54:36] and so you know
[54:38] your zeal matters
[54:40] it's not just being pleasing to god it
[54:43] can help you
[54:44] see but when you live a lukewarm life
[54:47] that's that's not just unpleasing to god
[54:49] because first of all it's insulting to
[54:52] him after all he does for us
[54:54] see
[54:55] as as if you are able to sustain your
[54:57] life and bless yourself
[54:59] uh but god you owe god everything
[55:02] and that he has given you the greatest
[55:04] treasure the pearl of great price and
[55:07] has given you the word not only just a
[55:09] word but the word of the hour
[55:11] i'm going to tell you something friends
[55:12] our life should be a constant rejoicing
[55:15] to god
[55:17] should never take him for granted never
[55:20] be nonchalant when the word comes to
[55:23] speak to you
[55:24] don't don't undervalue what god is
[55:27] trying to do in your life
[55:30] we're speaking on kingdom principles
[55:33] today and i've said to you last time and
[55:36] times before
[55:38] that there should be kingdom principles
[55:40] to every facet of your life because i
[55:42] proved you and i don't i'm not going to
[55:44] do it again today i've proved it several
[55:46] times we are in a kingdom atmosphere
[55:49] that this that this seventh seal has
[55:51] opened has now begun the age of the
[55:54] kingdom
[55:55] and it is going to culminate with you
[55:58] being changed into bodies like the
[56:00] kingdom but right now our minds should
[56:04] already be thinking kingdom thoughts our
[56:06] our activities to god should already
[56:09] have kingdom obedience kingdom zeal
[56:12] because i'm here to tell you god has
[56:15] kingdom power available to you amen
[56:19] i'm preaching the most dangerous sermon
[56:22] satan ever didn't want you to hear
[56:25] i'm trying to get you to understand that
[56:27] you're in a kingdom now and that your
[56:30] kingdom children and and and satan wants
[56:34] to keep you
[56:35] uh unaware of that he wants to bog you
[56:38] down and fog up your mind so that you
[56:41] lose sight of that and you start living
[56:43] like an earthling
[56:45] you start living like a laodicean
[56:48] and that's not why you're here
[56:50] amen
[56:51] so so i i showed you how that
[56:55] calvary proved the lord's intent and
[56:59] desire for fallen man i don't think god
[57:01] needs to prove anything else once jesus
[57:05] because of that day on calvary god
[57:07] should have nothing to prove to you
[57:11] he shouldn't have to prove that he loves
[57:13] you amen
[57:15] amen
[57:16] he shouldn't have to prove that he hears
[57:18] your prayers
[57:19] he shouldn't have to prove and
[57:21] demonstrate and shake you and quiver you
[57:23] and show signs in the heaven and and in
[57:25] the earth and and make all kinds of
[57:27] things so you would so you go well i
[57:28] guess he really is thinking about me and
[57:30] really loves me
[57:31] calvary proved that completely
[57:34] [Applause]
[57:38] improved god's intent for your life
[57:41] it proved that his desire for you is to
[57:44] live in victory so i ended last time by
[57:46] telling you that the only choice to be
[57:48] made is yours because you already know
[57:52] his amen
[57:56] the world is designed by satan
[57:59] to take away from you
[58:02] all things given by god and intended for
[58:05] your good
[58:07] i want to make that statement again
[58:09] the world
[58:10] that that is designed by satan he's the
[58:14] god of this age
[58:18] that's unique
[58:19] he never was that
[58:21] it's this age paul made that clear
[58:23] brother branham when he preaches god of
[58:24] this evil age brother branham goes into
[58:26] paul's language and says paul here is
[58:28] showing you you have arrived uniquely
[58:32] the church has never faced this hour
[58:34] where satan is the god of the age
[58:38] see
[58:39] you are now living in satan's eden
[58:43] this is why god would need to bring
[58:45] kingdom authority to you and go ahead
[58:48] and start pulling you into kingdom power
[58:50] and kingdom thinking and kingdom kingdom
[58:53] zeal
[58:54] otherwise you won't survive satan's eden
[58:58] you might make it in heaven you might
[58:59] make it in a rapture but you'll trip and
[59:01] stumble over the line and barely
[59:04] you know
[59:05] you'll fall down on your face and just
[59:06] have to extend a hand over the goal line
[59:09] to get to get credit for it
[59:12] i don't want to do that
[59:14] i want to charge over the line
[59:16] i want to be running full steam
[59:18] hallelujah
[59:20] the world is designed by satan to take
[59:23] away the world order
[59:25] is designed i don't mean the earth i
[59:27] mean the cosmos the world order is
[59:29] designed by satan to take away from you
[59:32] all things that are given to you by god
[59:35] that are intended for your good the word
[59:38] is here
[59:40] as a countermeasure for you to live by
[59:44] see and
[59:46] and may i say
[59:48] not just live by but i want to introduce
[59:50] you i'm going to change one word and i'm
[59:52] going to introduce a whole new level to
[59:54] you by just changing one word i'm even
[59:56] going to shorten the word no i won't
[59:57] shorten it same same amount of letters
[59:59] it's not just for you to live by
[1:00:02] but live in
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:05] i'll explain that brother brown i'm
[1:00:06] going to use brother brethren to explain
[1:00:08] what i mean by that here in a minute
[1:00:11] understand this that satan has a
[1:00:13] playbook with your name on it
[1:00:17] i i said to the teenagers particularly
[1:00:20] but it really goes to everyone
[1:00:23] that when satan comes and brings a
[1:00:25] thought to your mind just understand
[1:00:28] there's a plan with that thought
[1:00:30] he doesn't he's not just you know just
[1:00:32] you know he's not it's not a fishing
[1:00:34] expedition just trying to give you a
[1:00:35] thought trying to give you a thought
[1:00:36] trying to give you thought he's got a
[1:00:37] plan if he can get when that thought
[1:00:39] comes if he can get you to take it
[1:00:41] already know he's got this big plan
[1:00:44] behind that
[1:00:46] see
[1:00:48] and so satan has a playbook with your
[1:00:51] name on it
[1:00:52] and it's a plan his playbook is a plan
[1:00:55] for how to take you out of the game
[1:00:58] now he doesn't have to kill you
[1:01:02] he can't kill you
[1:01:04] until god's done with you you're
[1:01:05] immortal
[1:01:06] amen
[1:01:09] but his plan is to take you out of the
[1:01:11] game it's he doesn't have to kill you
[1:01:13] all he's got to do is just eliminate you
[1:01:16] from operating any power of god against
[1:01:19] him amen
[1:01:21] and he's that's all he needs
[1:01:23] if he can just
[1:01:24] bring your life under under certain
[1:01:27] trials or certain anxieties or certain
[1:01:29] entertainments or certain pleasures or
[1:01:31] certain visions or certain goals or
[1:01:32] certain objectives certain motives
[1:01:35] even if the goals plans objectives
[1:01:37] aren't sinful in and of themselves if
[1:01:40] you you actually have the ability
[1:01:42] because you're made in the image of god
[1:01:43] you can take something that's not sinful
[1:01:45] and make it sinful
[1:01:47] because it's anything that that in the
[1:01:49] pursuit of you lose sight of your main
[1:01:52] reason for being here and having life to
[1:01:56] begin with
[1:01:57] amen
[1:01:59] please remember that
[1:02:01] young people remember that as you pursue
[1:02:02] careers in education and friends and
[1:02:04] family and marriage and everything all
[1:02:06] virtuous things no problem people think
[1:02:09] brother branham was against education
[1:02:10] that is not correct
[1:02:12] brother branham was against education
[1:02:14] becoming a detriment to your faith
[1:02:17] see
[1:02:18] said that you just understand that
[1:02:19] education civilization just so you get
[1:02:22] it just so you know it's all over the
[1:02:23] devil
[1:02:25] heaven will have civilization it'll have
[1:02:27] education brother brandon said it's an
[1:02:29] education so much higher a civilization
[1:02:31] so much beyond this one uh that it this
[1:02:34] won't even even be comparable now i hope
[1:02:36] i got everybody's attention please i've
[1:02:38] spent a lot of hours many many many
[1:02:40] hours please
[1:02:41] keep me give me your undivided attention
[1:02:44] i'm not a long preacher so you owe it to
[1:02:46] me all right
[1:02:51] so the word is here is a countermeasure
[1:02:54] he's trying to do anything he can to to
[1:02:56] eliminate you from operating the any
[1:02:59] power of god against him now i said to
[1:03:02] you that you don't his word is a
[1:03:03] counter-measure not just to live by but
[1:03:06] to live
[1:03:07] in i'm understanding gee that this that
[1:03:09] this is good
[1:03:11] i'm going to cycle it off and then cycle
[1:03:12] it back on you should work by the george
[1:03:15] all right so let's have my powerpoint
[1:03:18] uh up on the screen i'm trying to go
[1:03:20] very studiously and methodically today
[1:03:22] and trying to trying to keep the order
[1:03:24] of things
[1:03:25] all right so what is the church of god
[1:03:27] part five let's see if i can advance
[1:03:30] all right kingdom order in how many
[1:03:32] things
[1:03:35] marriage
[1:03:37] finances
[1:03:39] friendships
[1:03:40] education
[1:03:42] life
[1:03:43] [Music]
[1:03:45] there should be a kingdom order that you
[1:03:47] live in
[1:03:49] a kingdom order in every facet of your
[1:03:53] life
[1:03:54] remember the composer knows the end from
[1:03:57] the beginning that i love this sermon
[1:03:59] one of my favorite from shalom 1964.
[1:04:02] remember the composer knows the end from
[1:04:04] the beginning he knows all about it
[1:04:06] that's the reason he could write it
[1:04:07] there now i'm showing you how to not
[1:04:09] just live by not merely by but in all
[1:04:11] right
[1:04:13] he that's the reason he could write it
[1:04:15] here correctly
[1:04:17] now you must begin with him you must
[1:04:20] begin if if you want to hear a symphony
[1:04:22] you must begin with him like in the
[1:04:24] music at the symphony
[1:04:26] you you listen you know what it says
[1:04:29] it's it's going to be what the symphony
[1:04:33] is see
[1:04:34] and then you begin to listen at the
[1:04:36] music and you know what it is so you
[1:04:38] know just about here's where certain
[1:04:41] certain things take place now it's got
[1:04:44] to change all right now this is an
[1:04:46] important instruction
[1:04:48] because
[1:04:49] you're not there to just be entertained
[1:04:52] when you go and you hear a symphony or
[1:04:55] you know you go to an opera whatever
[1:04:57] it's very helpful if you know the story
[1:04:59] behind it and you know the changes in
[1:05:02] the music and you can actually sit there
[1:05:05] and anticipate a coming change
[1:05:08] and and and you know what you know what
[1:05:10] you're doing you've entered in
[1:05:13] you're not just a spectator you see
[1:05:16] you're not just hearing music you're
[1:05:18] actually now participating in it this is
[1:05:21] how your christianity is
[1:05:23] amen
[1:05:24] this is how your life in the holy ghost
[1:05:26] should operate see
[1:05:27] you know god you know the sheep music
[1:05:31] you've read it you know where the
[1:05:33] changes are coming when you come to
[1:05:35] church and you hear a certain angle you
[1:05:37] know where god's headed and you cannot
[1:05:39] even before the preacher can say it
[1:05:41] sometimes you're already rejoicing
[1:05:44] amen
[1:05:45] how many times i've seen people get
[1:05:46] ahead of the preacher because they know
[1:05:47] where this is going
[1:05:49] because they've studied it in contra
[1:05:51] distinction
[1:05:52] come on on this you can also go to
[1:05:54] church and hear the preachers start
[1:05:55] going down the line and you kind of go
[1:05:57] oh boy
[1:05:59] okay i know where this is going
[1:06:02] amen
[1:06:04] but even that's for your good
[1:06:06] see
[1:06:07] watch
[1:06:09] and you know what it is so you know just
[1:06:11] about here's where certain certain
[1:06:14] things take place
[1:06:16] now it's got to change so that's another
[1:06:18] advantage in the sheet music because
[1:06:21] brother brennan said we're not just
[1:06:22] building a wall we're building a
[1:06:24] building and sometimes there has to be a
[1:06:26] junction and a turn
[1:06:29] and if you miss that you'll just go on
[1:06:31] off building a wall that's what
[1:06:32] denominations have done
[1:06:35] that's what organized religion does it
[1:06:37] just keeps going this is what we believe
[1:06:39] we're set okay let's just start laying
[1:06:41] brick and then they get down to a
[1:06:43] prophecy and the prophecy says hang left
[1:06:46] and they just keep on going
[1:06:47] and some of them been building those
[1:06:49] walls for four five six seven eight
[1:06:50] hundred years
[1:06:52] and they never got any of the building
[1:06:53] built because they just built one wall
[1:06:55] and they never caught the next messenger
[1:06:57] said you should have turned back there
[1:07:00] see
[1:07:01] all right so you this is your life you
[1:07:04] can't just
[1:07:05] you're not just going through life going
[1:07:08] through it
[1:07:10] god has markers that he wants you to pay
[1:07:12] attention to and make changes
[1:07:15] remember therefore
[1:07:17] you're good
[1:07:19] people wonder why their life gets into
[1:07:22] chaos
[1:07:23] and they don't take the time to look at
[1:07:25] how far off of god's kingdom principles
[1:07:28] they're out in the field somewhere
[1:07:30] and they've lost their bearings they
[1:07:32] don't even have the north star guiding
[1:07:34] them anymore they're just going in
[1:07:35] circles what's wrong with my life what's
[1:07:37] happening in my children i don't
[1:07:38] understand my marriage i don't
[1:07:40] understand my finances i don't
[1:07:41] understand my church what's going on and
[1:07:43] all you're doing is going in a circle
[1:07:45] going a circle going in a circle
[1:07:47] you're unstable it's a sign of
[1:07:48] double-mindedness your faith has not
[1:07:50] become settled on the word that god puts
[1:07:53] you here for a purpose
[1:07:55] and he has a purposed plan for your life
[1:07:58] and the only way you'll know his success
[1:08:00] that he desires for you is to walk in
[1:08:02] that plan
[1:08:04] and that requires that you stay in
[1:08:05] constant contact you have to stay in
[1:08:07] prayer you have to stay in church you
[1:08:09] have to stay in your bible you have to
[1:08:10] stay in the tapes you have to hear you
[1:08:11] have to you have to fellowship with god
[1:08:14] prayer is not just
[1:08:15] prayer is not sitting on santa claus lap
[1:08:18] giving him your list prayer you go
[1:08:21] somewhere
[1:08:22] in prayer prayer
[1:08:24] you're somewhere else it takes you to
[1:08:26] another place where you have fellowship
[1:08:29] with almighty god
[1:08:31] see
[1:08:32] this is what brings control in your life
[1:08:34] this is what gives you power over your
[1:08:36] own spirit because your spirit's not con
[1:08:38] not converted
[1:08:39] your spirit is managed
[1:08:44] eventually it'll be changed you'll get a
[1:08:45] theophany
[1:08:47] but this spirit was not given to you by
[1:08:49] god it was only permitted by god because
[1:08:51] of the because of the principles of life
[1:08:54] see
[1:08:55] father met mother and child was produced
[1:08:58] that's nature
[1:09:00] all right so you're born in a fallen
[1:09:02] nature so this spirit that you have is
[1:09:05] not
[1:09:06] it it has to be brought subject to the
[1:09:09] word amen
[1:09:11] so this is why the bible says
[1:09:13] whatsoever things are pure
[1:09:16] think on these things whatsoever things
[1:09:18] are lovely whatsoever things are of a
[1:09:20] good report think on these things what
[1:09:22] do i do with vain imaginations cast them
[1:09:24] down
[1:09:25] don't entertain them
[1:09:27] get control of your
[1:09:29] solomon said that a man with no control
[1:09:31] over his spirit is like an unwalled city
[1:09:33] where the enemy can just come in and out
[1:09:36] and there's nothing to keep the enemy
[1:09:38] out he's walking in the middle of the
[1:09:39] night and wreck everything
[1:09:41] kill people in their sleep see
[1:09:44] and so
[1:09:45] you know when you
[1:09:47] we we a lot of times if we're not
[1:09:49] careful
[1:09:51] we just put things off too well you know
[1:09:55] like brother branham said you know i was
[1:09:57] i was i was irish on my dad's side and
[1:09:59] so he had a hot irish temper like sister
[1:10:02] dorothy
[1:10:05] i'm only saying what her grandson said
[1:10:07] okay
[1:10:08] i've got authority i'm only saying i'm
[1:10:11] only repeating don't shoot the messenger
[1:10:17] and so
[1:10:19] but and brother branham that that bent
[1:10:22] that bend in his in his strain
[1:10:25] caused him to have a hot temper he took
[1:10:27] a rifle and tried to kill boys with it
[1:10:29] tried to murder him
[1:10:30] and the mercy of god spared him 15
[1:10:32] bullets snapped and then as soon as the
[1:10:34] boys were out of danger all
[1:10:35] all shells fired
[1:10:37] wasn't remington's fault it was the holy
[1:10:39] spirit's fault
[1:10:41] see
[1:10:42] and so so we find brother matt was
[1:10:45] talking at the men's breakfast yesterday
[1:10:47] about you know the young man that had
[1:10:49] the his his mother on his mother's side
[1:10:52] his dad on his daddy's side he was irish
[1:10:53] because his brother branham's brother
[1:10:54] and this is his nephew
[1:10:56] and he had he he was arrogant he even
[1:10:59] when he was wrong the young man he
[1:11:00] wouldn't apologize for anything he hurt
[1:11:02] his fiancee's feelings and did something
[1:11:04] terrible and he wouldn't repent he was
[1:11:06] like you know stuck he's like i'm not
[1:11:08] apologizing to you you know he had some
[1:11:10] chauvinistic idea of mannett i don't
[1:11:12] know but brother branham talks about
[1:11:13] that was in the mother's side that
[1:11:15] german strain he said they just won't
[1:11:17] apologize they're not they won't be
[1:11:18] cordial they're not friendly they won't
[1:11:20] even respond you they're condescending
[1:11:22] not the germans as a people because you
[1:11:25] take people like brother gerd wrote a
[1:11:26] walden brother marcus becker who we know
[1:11:28] here was some of those wonderful people
[1:11:30] in the world but what makes them like
[1:11:31] that the holy ghost made them like that
[1:11:33] and so brother branham says now to the
[1:11:35] husband to the to the dad which is his
[1:11:37] brother says now look at your side look
[1:11:40] at your side of the family all of them
[1:11:42] killers
[1:11:43] drunks
[1:11:44] shoot shooting cutting
[1:11:46] fighting
[1:11:47] and he said but you're not like that he
[1:11:49] said why the holy spirit took that see
[1:11:52] and he said to the mother now your
[1:11:54] family is arrogant and uppity and they
[1:11:55] won't repent won't apologize but you're
[1:11:57] not like that what did that the holy
[1:11:59] spirit
[1:12:00] see that you you now have the holy
[1:12:02] spirit strain you're not living by your
[1:12:04] natural strain
[1:12:07] amen there's value in letting the holy
[1:12:09] ghost control your life
[1:12:12] and and and so that's why brother brown
[1:12:14] says we live after the life of our
[1:12:15] rebirth the land of our rebirth see i
[1:12:18] don't i don't live here the way i was
[1:12:19] born i've been changed amen
[1:12:22] we sing about it i've been changed i've
[1:12:24] been reborn now all my life has been
[1:12:26] rearranged what a difference it makes
[1:12:28] when the lord has his way
[1:12:31] amen
[1:12:32] and so
[1:12:33] you know we we we talk about strains and
[1:12:36] habits and well and then a lot of times
[1:12:38] people people can blame their habits on
[1:12:40] well this happened to me in my childhood
[1:12:42] uh this i'm only like this because what
[1:12:44] somebody did to me but just remember
[1:12:47] this friends that
[1:12:48] what whatever kind of spirit is is
[1:12:51] controlling you brother branham said
[1:12:55] habits
[1:12:56] are spirits
[1:12:59] say oh i can't you know um i have a
[1:13:02] habit of of lusting no you don't have a
[1:13:06] habit of lusting you have a spirit
[1:13:09] of lusting that's anointing you
[1:13:12] now maybe it got its inroad somewhere
[1:13:14] back in your life but god has sent a
[1:13:16] word for you to conquer that
[1:13:19] say oh you know i i got angry no
[1:13:23] you didn't get angry you fell victim to
[1:13:26] a spirit of anger
[1:13:29] oh i'm just depressed no you're under
[1:13:31] the anointing of a spirit of depression
[1:13:35] but whom the son makes free is free
[1:13:38] indeed
[1:13:40] you have
[1:13:41] you have the word to govern your kingdom
[1:13:44] life
[1:13:47] amen
[1:13:50] so brother branham goes on
[1:13:52] so glad for a prophet man i wouldn't
[1:13:55] know none of this stuff if it wasn't for
[1:13:56] william branham
[1:13:58] watch this
[1:13:59] now
[1:14:00] to anybody else that don't know nothing
[1:14:02] about what they just walked in and sat
[1:14:04] down it's just a bunch of nonsense
[1:14:06] rattling noise
[1:14:08] but the one who knows what it is see
[1:14:10] isn't amazing that this is to you is is
[1:14:13] poetry to another it's rattling noise to
[1:14:16] you this is a symphony one of the
[1:14:17] greatest pieces of work ever to others
[1:14:19] it's just a noise they can't make heads
[1:14:21] or tails of it
[1:14:23] they misinterpret the intention of the
[1:14:24] author and everything
[1:14:26] all right but to the but the one who
[1:14:29] knows what it is
[1:14:31] it's beat out with the music see
[1:14:35] that when brother branham saw those
[1:14:36] sainted bunch of little girls they were
[1:14:39] marching to a beat
[1:14:41] something like onward christian soldiers
[1:14:45] the false church was also marching to a
[1:14:48] beat of rock and roll
[1:14:50] because the the
[1:14:52] the trinity doctrine and rock and roll
[1:14:55] are the two things civil and
[1:14:56] ecclesiastic powers on this nation that
[1:14:59] will that that influences the world
[1:15:02] see so so the three unclean spirits like
[1:15:05] frogs in the book of revelation so that
[1:15:07] trinity doctrine is the religious angle
[1:15:10] that lead that connects people to rome
[1:15:12] which is connected to ancient babylon
[1:15:14] amen that's rudimentary
[1:15:16] but then rock and roll is the spirit
[1:15:19] that connects all of the all of the
[1:15:21] people socially and i can tell you as a
[1:15:24] world traveler american worldly music
[1:15:28] rock rap country whatever it is it it
[1:15:31] joins all nations
[1:15:34] and every culture i've ever been in ever
[1:15:36] ever have ever been i've been in all of
[1:15:38] them
[1:15:39] six of the seven continents and i'm here
[1:15:41] to tell you that that ungodly music
[1:15:44] rhythm and beat makes the whole world
[1:15:46] brothers and sisters
[1:15:49] see that's why we have to be careful in
[1:15:51] our worship service
[1:15:54] god christian lyrics does not a
[1:15:56] christian song make
[1:16:00] amen remember
[1:16:02] remember
[1:16:03] music and worship were not in
[1:16:07] creation
[1:16:08] they predate creation
[1:16:10] before god ever created the earth
[1:16:14] music and worship already existed in
[1:16:16] heaven
[1:16:18] it didn't get created in creation it was
[1:16:20] already there satan was the uh the the
[1:16:23] conductor of it lucifer was
[1:16:26] oh keep getting pulled off but it's
[1:16:28] important stuff
[1:16:30] so it's beat out with the music drummed
[1:16:33] out
[1:16:34] with the notes
[1:16:36] it's trumpeted with the trumpets
[1:16:39] it's strung on the harp it's played with
[1:16:42] the violin
[1:16:43] it's beat on the bass
[1:16:45] this is your
[1:16:46] life it's sounded by the trumpets it's
[1:16:50] beat on the drums onward christian
[1:16:53] soldiers marching as to war and one
[1:16:55] group went off the abyss and brother
[1:16:57] branham said the awfulest screams you
[1:16:58] ever heard but that other group instead
[1:17:00] of going down they started going up
[1:17:03] i'm here to tell you there's a kingdom
[1:17:04] rhythm
[1:17:06] there's a kingdom beat to the word it's
[1:17:08] got a kingdom people marching in the
[1:17:10] rhythm of the gospel and satan is
[1:17:12] already descending and you are already
[1:17:14] ascending
[1:17:16] see
[1:17:17] it's the order of things and so
[1:17:19] the whole thing together in rhythm now
[1:17:22] watch this
[1:17:23] and it makes the drama till you can
[1:17:26] close your eyes and live in it
[1:17:31] see
[1:17:33] so this kingdom word is not just to live
[1:17:36] by
[1:17:37] otherwise it's just a denominational
[1:17:39] list of do's and don'ts it's a box
[1:17:42] it's not just to live by
[1:17:44] it's to live in
[1:17:47] see this is why my angle of pastoring
[1:17:49] doesn't try to force you into a box of
[1:17:52] living by rules
[1:17:54] but i'm trying to get you to live in
[1:17:56] something i'm trying to get you to enter
[1:17:58] into a shekinah presence that's among us
[1:18:02] that's here to be a guide to your life
[1:18:06] man could close his mortal eyes to
[1:18:09] earthly sight and live in the presence
[1:18:11] of jesus christ now you're not going to
[1:18:13] live very effectively in the presence of
[1:18:15] jesus christ unless you close your eyes
[1:18:17] to earthly mortal sight
[1:18:19] it's like the bible says you know resist
[1:18:21] the devil and he'll flee from you
[1:18:23] amen great everybody loves that one but
[1:18:25] everybody forgets the first part of it
[1:18:27] submit yourselves unto god resist the
[1:18:30] devil and he'll flee from you no one has
[1:18:32] ever successfully resisted the devil
[1:18:34] until they first submitted themselves to
[1:18:35] god
[1:18:37] resist the devil is not not
[1:18:39] a a spell
[1:18:42] it's not an amulet you wear it's not a
[1:18:44] it's not a a charm
[1:18:47] it's a principle of god's word submit
[1:18:49] yourselves to god resist the devil and
[1:18:50] he will flee from you watch same
[1:18:52] principle man could close his mortal
[1:18:54] eyes to earthly sight
[1:18:57] and live in the presence of jesus christ
[1:18:59] when you see his word being beat out in
[1:19:02] the great symphony that we're living in
[1:19:05] now changing you must begin in the
[1:19:08] symphony the only thing you can do if
[1:19:10] you're in the symphony then you start
[1:19:12] you begin to get into the rhythm
[1:19:15] oh i i tell you as a as a pastor
[1:19:18] sometimes can i darken that as a pastor
[1:19:21] sometimes say what is what is what are
[1:19:24] you doing what's this sermon really
[1:19:27] about i'm trying to get you in a rhythm
[1:19:30] amen i'm trying to get your life to
[1:19:33] match the rhythm of this i'm trying to
[1:19:35] sink you
[1:19:37] synchronize
[1:19:39] you with this
[1:19:41] so that your life looks like this
[1:19:43] remember friends
[1:19:44] this
[1:19:45] the whole purpose of this is to not be
[1:19:48] needed amen when you're in a rapture and
[1:19:52] you're in glory you won't need this
[1:19:54] say my bible this is your third bible
[1:19:57] this is the third bible
[1:19:59] this is the third iteration the first
[1:20:01] one was in the stars the second one was
[1:20:03] in the pyramid this is the third one
[1:20:06] brother branham said when the books are
[1:20:07] closed for the last time the word will
[1:20:08] be flesh
[1:20:10] the whole purpose of this is to get
[1:20:11] behind your skin and live
[1:20:14] a lived life
[1:20:18] that's why jesus didn't carry a bible he
[1:20:20] was the word
[1:20:23] amen
[1:20:28] all right when you become part
[1:20:31] all right that's the way um yeah okay
[1:20:34] well right here
[1:20:35] that's the way
[1:20:37] you do
[1:20:38] you don't stand off and look at it
[1:20:41] you get into the rhythm of it
[1:20:44] how do you get in there you're born into
[1:20:47] it
[1:20:47] into the rhythm of the word when you
[1:20:50] become part of that word
[1:20:53] you have to become part of the word to
[1:20:56] know god's symphony
[1:20:58] see it's not learned intellectually all
[1:21:01] right
[1:21:03] his symphony is when it's playing oh i
[1:21:05] love that
[1:21:07] his symphony is when it's playing you
[1:21:09] understand
[1:21:10] you're marching with the beat of the
[1:21:12] time
[1:21:13] so his symphony god has a symphony
[1:21:16] operating
[1:21:18] not when you're just standing afar off
[1:21:20] you might even be believing it but
[1:21:21] you're just looking at it
[1:21:23] amen you might even believe god sent a
[1:21:25] prophet you might even believe
[1:21:26] everything i'm preaching but until you
[1:21:29] actually be willing to step forward and
[1:21:31] get into it
[1:21:32] then it's not a symphony yet not for you
[1:21:35] see
[1:21:38] that's
[1:21:39] he says
[1:21:41] you're marching with the beat of the
[1:21:43] time this is what the devil don't want
[1:21:45] you're watching for it the works that i
[1:21:48] do shall you also greater than this
[1:21:50] shall you do these last days oh my the
[1:21:54] great changing over the time we get into
[1:21:57] the beat beat of the word see
[1:21:59] find his purpose the hour that we're
[1:22:02] living
[1:22:03] get into the rhythm of it how he does it
[1:22:06] how he does it get into the rhythm of it
[1:22:09] how he does it i'm gonna i'm gonna give
[1:22:11] you a few examples i hope you got seat
[1:22:13] belts on today i'm gonna get this isn't
[1:22:15] ambiguous god has very clear examples
[1:22:18] we're about to look at some of them
[1:22:21] amen it's only gonna be for believers if
[1:22:23] you're not a believer feel free to check
[1:22:26] your email or think about a job tomorrow
[1:22:28] because i'm going to go into some things
[1:22:29] that are just for believers
[1:22:32] but they're very specific
[1:22:35] on what it means to get into the rhythm
[1:22:37] of it all right not just have a mental
[1:22:40] ascent and believe it saying amen means
[1:22:43] let it be in every facet of my life
[1:22:46] that's what saying amen means it's not
[1:22:48] just mental agreement
[1:22:50] so he says we get into the beat of the
[1:22:52] word for find his purpose the hour that
[1:22:55] we're living get into the rhythm of it
[1:22:57] how he does it if you get into the word
[1:23:00] you find out how he did it at the
[1:23:03] beginning we're gonna find out how he
[1:23:05] does it amen now you won't hold that
[1:23:07] against me will you
[1:23:09] i'm not telling you how i do it i don't
[1:23:10] know if yeah if i make you into me
[1:23:12] you're going to be a wreck
[1:23:13] i'm i'm going to show you how he does it
[1:23:16] how many believers will obey how he does
[1:23:18] it
[1:23:19] all right two-thirds of you thank you
[1:23:20] all right the rest of you you check your
[1:23:22] email or think about a job tomorrow
[1:23:24] all right if you get into the word you
[1:23:26] find out how he did it at the beginning
[1:23:30] then you know how he's doing it all the
[1:23:32] time
[1:23:33] wow
[1:23:35] that's so easy
[1:23:37] if you find out how he did at the
[1:23:38] beginning
[1:23:39] then you know how he's doing it all the
[1:23:40] time you know why because he doesn't
[1:23:42] change
[1:23:43] amen
[1:23:44] now take that down gee and get ready for
[1:23:46] some scriptures
[1:23:49] all right so
[1:23:50] let me make my adjustment here
[1:23:55] all right
[1:23:58] now you remember last time or time
[1:24:00] before i don't remember now and i told
[1:24:02] you we we comment about how people i get
[1:24:04] it i totally get it i'm the same way we
[1:24:05] love high octane preaching we love deep
[1:24:08] dark lofty
[1:24:09] mysteries and you know rocket fuel
[1:24:11] burning
[1:24:13] styles and
[1:24:14] but some you know space shuttle stuff
[1:24:17] uh you know uh spacex stuff
[1:24:20] you know but but when it comes back down
[1:24:22] to earth where i think i said you know
[1:24:24] where the rubber tires of the space
[1:24:26] shuttle meet the road of the runway
[1:24:29] see then then you know that that's a
[1:24:31] landing strip and here's where it can
[1:24:32] get a bit tough or as the book of
[1:24:34] revelation let me let me use let me use
[1:24:37] its description it gets a little bitter
[1:24:38] in our belly
[1:24:40] all right
[1:24:42] so as i said you're welcome to be
[1:24:44] excused if you're not a believer because
[1:24:46] this is only going to be for believers

[1:28:02] work of them that turn aside it shall

[1:28:09] our heart to say it will not cleave to
[1:28:11] me i'm not here to be part of the world
[1:28:14] i'm here to be different than the world
[1:28:16] i need my home to be different than the
[1:28:19] world we need our church to be different
[1:28:21] than just a standard christian so-called
[1:28:24] church we're here with the living
[1:28:26] presence of the living god among us
[1:28:31] see
[1:28:33] let's look at kingdom order
[1:28:36] walking the earth among our fellow man
[1:28:39] let's stay in that same psalm get him
[1:28:40] we're going to catch verses 4 4-7 i
[1:28:43] believe
[1:28:44] a froward heart shall depart from me
[1:28:48] i will not know a wicked person
[1:28:51] who so privately privately slandereth
[1:28:53] his neighbor him will i cut off him that
[1:28:56] hath a high look and a proud heart will
[1:28:58] i will not i suffer
[1:29:00] this is this now this is this is who the
[1:29:02] friend kind of friends you should have
[1:29:04] see
[1:29:05] mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of
[1:29:08] the land that they may dwell with me he
[1:29:11] that walketh in a perfect way he shall
[1:29:14] serve me he that this is god now
[1:29:17] speaking to the church you say i don't
[1:29:19] know if i want to be like that i'm
[1:29:20] reading you how god said he is
[1:29:23] so make your choice you don't want to be
[1:29:25] like him okay
[1:29:26] but if you want to be like him he says
[1:29:29] mine eyes shall be upon the faithful and
[1:29:32] they that they may dwell with me he that
[1:29:34] walketh in a perfect way he shall serve
[1:29:36] me he that worketh deceit shall not
[1:29:39] dwell within my house he that telleth
[1:29:41] lies shall not tarry in my sight amen
[1:29:46] amen
[1:29:47] you know
[1:29:49] so so what would the opinion of your
[1:29:51] neighbors be
[1:29:52] is that the kind of life you live what
[1:29:54] about your work associates what about
[1:29:56] your your school chums
[1:29:58] would that be the opinion they have of
[1:30:00] you
[1:30:00] when they say you're different do they
[1:30:02] mean you you girls just always wear
[1:30:04] dresses and you boys just don't do this
[1:30:06] and all that do they miss means some
[1:30:08] some set of rules or do they mean
[1:30:10] something more than that they'll say
[1:30:12] there's something about you that's
[1:30:13] different
[1:30:15] something that should be in you that
[1:30:16] creates a craving
[1:30:18] for them brother rome was giving his
[1:30:20] testimony here he is in a non-religious
[1:30:23] family
[1:30:24] no no inclination to any of that his
[1:30:26] whole life any and he meets a young
[1:30:29] sister from canada
[1:30:30] at a church in georgia
[1:30:32] mississippi and there's just something
[1:30:35] about her and he's like wow now they
[1:30:38] they never became romantic don't think
[1:30:39] that it just some they became friends
[1:30:42] and there was something in her life that
[1:30:45] said you know what it was a deep started
[1:30:46] calling to a deep
[1:30:48] he didn't even know he's the son of god
[1:30:50] there was a seed done in there and her
[1:30:52] life she had no clue she was living a
[1:30:55] christian life she and suddenly she's
[1:30:57] got he you know they talk on the phone
[1:30:59] and she's got brother brandon playing in
[1:31:00] the background
[1:31:02] i wish i wish
[1:31:04] more boys would call more girls with
[1:31:07] brother brandon playing in the
[1:31:08] background
[1:31:13] and you know where he started who's that
[1:31:15] she wasn't shy you know where it ended
[1:31:18] up hey turn that up
[1:31:20] they're talking hey turn it up
[1:31:22] how you been today yeah turn it up yeah
[1:31:24] turn it up yeah you've been good yeah
[1:31:25] i've been good i mean the whole and now
[1:31:28] then it goes that's a see
[1:31:30] she's seeding something in his heart and
[1:31:33] now he can't get to mississippi and so
[1:31:36] you know what he does in savannah his
[1:31:37] home he starts listening to tapes
[1:31:40] he doesn't even know oh anything about a
[1:31:42] message church he calls voice to god
[1:31:44] says i i we i need somebody that
[1:31:46] preaches according to william branham
[1:31:48] they said the closest church to you is
[1:31:49] in beaufort south carolina pastor jason
[1:31:51] watkins go there he shows up here he's
[1:31:53] ready to be baptized
[1:31:55] you know what did that prophet's voice
[1:31:58] it affected a young lady
[1:32:00] see and and and that's that's the best
[1:32:03] way if you want to affect your friends
[1:32:06] affect them by letting the word live
[1:32:08] through you
[1:32:10] see if you're let me say something to
[1:32:12] you if you're not doing that young
[1:32:14] person then you say oh i i care about
[1:32:17] this person i want to see if i can win
[1:32:18] them you're hindering them
[1:32:20] amen you're actually blocking you're
[1:32:22] effectively blocking god because god
[1:32:23] won't operate in triangles it's not you
[1:32:26] and her and him
[1:32:28] it's not sister it's not you and him and
[1:32:31] god
[1:32:31] god god would assembly turn away and
[1:32:33] walk away from that
[1:32:35] until you get yourself out of the way
[1:32:37] and let god speak to that person
[1:32:40] otherwise you're in the way hindering
[1:32:42] the situation amen
[1:32:44] amen
[1:32:47] so
[1:32:48] so we find then that
[1:32:50] that we let's go to colossians brother
[1:32:53] gideon uh colossians chapter four this
[1:32:56] is our text
[1:32:58] this is where we read our text am i good
[1:33:00] on time i'm not too good but i'm okay
[1:33:03] okay
[1:33:04] all right i'm only gonna go so far i
[1:33:06] won't i won't try to won't try to press
[1:33:08] it here's our text colossians 4 5.
[1:33:12] is this good kingdom principles
[1:33:14] kingdom life
[1:33:15] verse 5 colossians 4 5 walk in wisdom
[1:33:18] toward them that are without redeeming
[1:33:20] the time now
[1:33:22] this this this term
[1:33:24] redeeming the time is from a very
[1:33:26] specific greek word i'm not even going
[1:33:28] to attempt to pronounce it it's like 20
[1:33:30] letters long
[1:33:31] but it means
[1:33:33] buy up time
[1:33:35] it means make the most of time see
[1:33:38] so that's from bible knowledge
[1:33:40] commentary and and the ivp bible
[1:33:43] background commentary if you want the
[1:33:44] reference
[1:33:45] it means to buy up the time redeem the
[1:33:48] time buy it up make the in other words
[1:33:51] not that you can purchase more time but
[1:33:55] use your time wisely make the most of
[1:33:58] the time
[1:34:00] we've we preached you here some some
[1:34:02] weeks ago back last year
[1:34:04] that that time
[1:34:06] time is the most valuable thing in the
[1:34:08] world
[1:34:10] time is more valuable than money amen
[1:34:13] you can make more money but you can't
[1:34:15] make more
[1:34:16] time see
[1:34:19] and so too often we forget that this
[1:34:22] life is temporary and actually very
[1:34:25] brief
[1:34:26] amen amen
[1:34:28] we forget that too often and and and in
[1:34:30] doing so we fail to organize
[1:34:34] our limited supply of time
[1:34:37] effectively
[1:34:39] amen
[1:34:41] let's look at it again in ephesians five
[1:34:43] get in ephesians five and we'll catch
[1:34:46] verses 14 through 17.
[1:34:50] wherefore he saith
[1:34:52] awake thou that sleepest and arise from
[1:34:55] the dead
[1:34:56] and christ shall give the light
[1:34:59] see then that you walk circumspectly not
[1:35:01] as fools but as wise
[1:35:04] redeeming the time now you already know
[1:35:06] what that is redeeming the time because
[1:35:09] the days are evil
[1:35:11] wherefore be you not unwise but
[1:35:14] understand what the will of the lord is
[1:35:16] remember brother branham was showing us
[1:35:17] that in shalom you've got to know him to
[1:35:19] know his will you got to enter into the
[1:35:21] symphony
[1:35:22] see
[1:35:23] so now there's two distinct parts leave
[1:35:25] that up leave uh leave verse 16 up gee
[1:35:28] uh redeeming the time because the days
[1:35:30] are evil so there's two distinct parts
[1:35:32] to see here
[1:35:34] involving time i'm going to cover them
[1:35:36] easy all right
[1:35:37] firstly
[1:35:39] there is a command for redeeming of time
[1:35:43] amen
[1:35:44] it's not just a mere recommendation it's
[1:35:47] actually the second time paul uses it
[1:35:49] this is a kingdom principle
[1:35:52] for all of those in the kingdom you need
[1:35:55] to make sure
[1:35:56] that you're using your very brief and
[1:35:58] limited supply of time effectively how
[1:36:01] do i do that by letting god have control
[1:36:03] of it
[1:36:05] you shouldn't spend one word i remember
[1:36:07] years ago and it's not in my notes it
[1:36:08] comes to my mind must be the lord i
[1:36:10] remember years ago brother doris tidwell
[1:36:12] when he he's dead and gone now but when
[1:36:14] his wife died and he was still alive
[1:36:16] and brother doris came and preached a
[1:36:18] wonderful man brother terry tubal's dad
[1:36:20] but james did was dad michael tidwell
[1:36:22] some of you younger ones know michael
[1:36:24] but it was his grandfather and brother
[1:36:26] dars came
[1:36:27] and brother dars was just preaching and
[1:36:29] he started talking about regrets
[1:36:32] and his wife had just been gone maybe a
[1:36:33] few months and he just stopped and
[1:36:35] started to tear up and he said you young
[1:36:37] couples he's an old man now he said
[1:36:39] don't ever say a a hard word to that
[1:36:43] mate
[1:36:44] he said you can't believe the regret you
[1:36:46] have
[1:36:47] he said don't ever waste a moment don't
[1:36:49] ever fail to say i love you don't ever
[1:36:51] fail to show your affection he said
[1:36:55] life is so over so quickly and there's
[1:36:57] no way to go back and fix it
[1:37:00] amen
[1:37:02] so finally so firstly
[1:37:04] there is a command
[1:37:06] for redeeming the time
[1:37:09] now this usage of this word time
[1:37:13] is actually used in a way to to evoke
[1:37:17] a consideration of your priorities you
[1:37:20] still with me is this easy all right i'm
[1:37:22] not going too fast i hope
[1:37:24] so the the usage of this word time
[1:37:27] is to evoke a consideration
[1:37:31] in within you
[1:37:32] of your priorities all right
[1:37:35] secondly
[1:37:36] it is it is brought home
[1:37:40] by the following by usage of the
[1:37:43] following term
[1:37:44] because the days are
[1:37:46] evil
[1:37:48] amen
[1:37:50] so like daniel who when daniel looked
[1:37:53] around in his life and looked at the
[1:37:54] world and looked at egypt and i mean
[1:37:56] israel in captivity daniel said i
[1:37:59] started studying the books of prophecy
[1:38:02] i started reading back through and he
[1:38:04] said i learned by the study of books
[1:38:07] i learned by the prophecy of prophets
[1:38:10] that so that 70 years are determined
[1:38:13] and that that this captivity should be
[1:38:15] over in 70 years because daniel's not
[1:38:17] the one who gave the prophecies jeremiah
[1:38:18] said you'll be there 70 years and now
[1:38:20] they're daniel looked at that now you
[1:38:22] say well
[1:38:23] you know he was bored and had nothing to
[1:38:25] do no no
[1:38:26] daniel knew that the hour of their
[1:38:29] deliverance was getting close and he
[1:38:31] thought i need to go and see exactly how
[1:38:33] close we are and when he did he said
[1:38:35] we're only going to be here 70 years
[1:38:37] wow
[1:38:38] we're getting ready to go home
[1:38:41] and everybody else is like you're crazy
[1:38:43] we're prisoners here we'll never get out
[1:38:45] of here alive no no
[1:38:46] no i'm telling you we're getting ready
[1:38:48] to leave here
[1:38:49] i can look at modern events made clear
[1:38:52] by prophecy and i can tell you we're
[1:38:54] getting ready to leave here
[1:38:57] hallelujah
[1:39:00] amen like daniel we study prophecy and
[1:39:03] we understand that there is to be at the
[1:39:05] end time
[1:39:07] a raging conflict between good and evil
[1:39:10] and so the apostles thought then
[1:39:14] that we read here
[1:39:15] his thought is that
[1:39:17] we have a participating responsibility
[1:39:21] in this conflict
[1:39:24] redeem the time because the days are
[1:39:26] evil
[1:39:28] so we've been identified that we're near
[1:39:31] we're at that time we're in this kingdom
[1:39:33] time it's a it's a it's a global titanic
[1:39:37] spiritual warfare between good and evil
[1:39:41] and the the apostle paul is trying to
[1:39:43] get us to understand we're supposed to
[1:39:45] have a participating function
[1:39:48] we have a responsibility to be kingdom
[1:39:51] saints to operate kingdom power to have
[1:39:54] kingdom thinking
[1:39:57] not not thinking according to my strain
[1:40:00] in my family or my past life or what
[1:40:03] happened to me you know or what the
[1:40:05] devil and my fear and my anxiety
[1:40:07] nonsense friends we're kingdom people
[1:40:12] the devil has no power to hold you
[1:40:14] unless brother brethren says he has no
[1:40:17] power
[1:40:18] the jesus took every power from him and
[1:40:21] the only thing he's got left the only
[1:40:23] weapon he has left is if he can get you
[1:40:26] to doubt your weapon
[1:40:28] this is psychological warfare you need
[1:40:30] to win it
[1:40:35] see if you allow satan to get by with it
[1:40:38] friends i'm going to tell you something
[1:40:40] if you allow him to get by with it
[1:40:42] he'll fill up your life with any and all
[1:40:44] things to
[1:40:46] mute your awareness to blunt your
[1:40:49] awareness of this spiritual reminder
[1:40:51] that you are to redeem the time
[1:40:53] you're to buy it up you're to use it
[1:40:55] wisely because it's got a limited supply
[1:40:57] and we're almost home
[1:40:59] see we're we're warned
[1:41:02] to be alert to his lurking
[1:41:06] therefore
[1:41:10] it matters
[1:41:12] what we give our time to
[1:41:15] it matters
[1:41:17] as to the course and direction
[1:41:19] we set for our lives
[1:41:21] so the reference to time here is
[1:41:23] something then it's uh i think you'd all
[1:41:26] agree it's a bit more uh than just
[1:41:28] observing uh
[1:41:30] standard earth time that you measure on
[1:41:33] a calendar or a wrist watch you know
[1:41:36] since the days of the upper room
[1:41:39] in the book of acts
[1:41:41] the family of god measures where time is
[1:41:44] measured to god's family as kingdom time
[1:41:49] see
[1:41:50] prophetic time because after all i'm not
[1:41:54] i'm not an american i don't operate
[1:41:56] solely on eastern standard time i mean
[1:41:58] my whole life isn't isn't based on utc
[1:42:01] minus five
[1:42:03] you know i'd be
[1:42:04] whatever the coordinated universal time
[1:42:06] is for wherever you live i'm a child of
[1:42:08] the king i run on kingdom time
[1:42:11] see
[1:42:12] i operate my life on kingdom time i set
[1:42:16] my life's priorities according to
[1:42:18] kingdom time
[1:42:19] see and so and and david has taught us
[1:42:23] that the king's business requireth haste
[1:42:27] let me say to you today if there's some
[1:42:29] spirit got you bound you need to get
[1:42:31] free now
[1:42:33] you don't need to wait you need to get
[1:42:35] free now
[1:42:36] you need to hurry hurry and get on with
[1:42:38] god's kingdom plan
[1:42:40] and quit chasing your own dreams
[1:42:45] see
[1:42:47] oh can i have the 12 more minutes and
[1:42:49] i'll let you out at the top of the hour
[1:42:52] gideon let's go to
[1:42:54] proverbs 6 and we'll just catch a few
[1:42:57] verses here 9 through 11.
[1:43:00] how long proverbs
[1:43:02] did i say 6. proverbs chapter 6 verses 9
[1:43:05] 10 and 11 how long wilt thou sleep o
[1:43:09] sluggard
[1:43:10] when will thou arise out of thy sleep
[1:43:14] yet a little sleep a little slumber a
[1:43:16] little folding over the hands to sleep
[1:43:18] so shall thy poverty come as one that
[1:43:20] travaileth and thy one as an armed man
[1:43:24] i think that must have been brother
[1:43:25] eddie's favorite verse in the whole
[1:43:27] bible
[1:43:28] he used to say that to me and anybody
[1:43:30] will listen all the time you know i i i
[1:43:34] think and i think in plan in kingdom
[1:43:36] time
[1:43:38] that's how i operate
[1:43:40] i think about kingdom time you know
[1:43:42] that's how we should do it
[1:43:44] i can tell you that's god's intention
[1:43:47] that's his purpose for you to do it
[1:43:50] we hear so much
[1:43:53] and about brother branham would say and
[1:43:56] you've heard it i know you've heard it
[1:43:57] as many times as i have probably
[1:43:59] that that if the
[1:44:02] the the the the tree of life
[1:44:05] that started in the book of acts
[1:44:07] if it ever puts forth another branch
[1:44:09] they'll write another book of acts
[1:44:10] behind it amen
[1:44:12] amen
[1:44:14] that's what he said write another book
[1:44:15] of acts behind it see
[1:44:17] so the bride is to write another book of
[1:44:20] acts because we have the same
[1:44:24] kingdom message you have the same token
[1:44:26] that paul was preaching
[1:44:28] you've been restored to the same
[1:44:30] abstract deed
[1:44:31] that paul had you've got the same
[1:44:34] jubilee that they enjoyed in the upper
[1:44:36] room
[1:44:37] see
[1:44:38] but to remember this friends please
[1:44:41] remember what i'm about to tell you if
[1:44:43] you forget everything else i've said
[1:44:47] the book of acts that you read in your
[1:44:49] bible
[1:44:50] is a chronicle of accumulated
[1:44:53] accomplishments amen see
[1:44:56] the book of acts was written
[1:44:58] only because the apostles acted
[1:45:03] you get me
[1:45:05] kingdom accomplishments
[1:45:08] that began with the outpouring of the
[1:45:10] holy ghost in the upper room at
[1:45:12] jerusalem
[1:45:13] are now a continuation of god's kingdom
[1:45:16] on earth only now it's in the church
[1:45:18] amen it's in a pride it's in his body so
[1:45:22] writing a book of acts for the omega
[1:45:24] church
[1:45:26] writing a book of acts hear me
[1:45:28] when brother branham says the church
[1:45:30] will write a book of acts behind it
[1:45:31] writing a book of acts behind this omega
[1:45:34] church was never intended by brother
[1:45:37] branham to be an assignment
[1:45:40] it's a living
[1:45:42] testimony
[1:45:44] it's not just something you do it's what
[1:45:47] you are
[1:45:48] and that lives itself out and that's a
[1:45:51] book of acts
[1:45:53] see
[1:45:54] it's a it's a book lived uh it's it's
[1:45:57] it's the lived actions of the last day
[1:46:00] bride lived out in faith victories over
[1:46:03] the enemy how many want them it's
[1:46:06] victories over the enemy where we have
[1:46:08] allowed christ to accomplish his will in
[1:46:11] our everyday walking talking life i just
[1:46:14] say that's for me lord that's i'm right
[1:46:17] i'm not waiting to write a book of acts
[1:46:18] i'm already writing a book of acts
[1:46:20] see
[1:46:21] amen
[1:46:22] you're either writing a book of acts or
[1:46:24] you're writing a book of laodicea
[1:46:26] amen
[1:46:28] so when a prophet makes that statement
[1:46:30] about this bride writing another book of
[1:46:32] acts behind it it's not a bride
[1:46:36] waiting for something to fall out of the
[1:46:37] heavens
[1:46:39] it's not some new revival to break out
[1:46:42] your mission today
[1:46:44] should you choose to accept
[1:46:46] is to add to your chapters yes
[1:46:50] amen glory daily
[1:46:53] right now
[1:46:55] any time you say amen you're adding to
[1:46:57] your chapter
[1:46:59] any time you have a decision to make and
[1:47:01] here's a decision the enemy wants here's
[1:47:03] a decision your fallen spirit wants but
[1:47:05] here's what god wants and you say nope
[1:47:07] amen
[1:47:08] that's a book of acts
[1:47:10] when you say god hold on i you don't
[1:47:12] know what i've dealt with what i've been
[1:47:13] through i'm going to stay over here for
[1:47:14] a while that's the book of laodicea
[1:47:16] see that's a book of your fallen life
[1:47:19] and you're not to live by that you live
[1:47:20] the life of the land of your rebirth
[1:47:23] where jesus is the king
[1:47:26] see
[1:47:28] so not waiting seed not waiting for you
[1:47:30] to become a perfect christian don't wait
[1:47:32] on that not waiting for the stars to
[1:47:33] line up in your life not waiting for
[1:47:35] some extra blessing to come down
[1:47:38] on you from god amen
[1:47:41] amen
[1:47:44] i'm going to give you a clue i'm going
[1:47:45] to close with the testimony
[1:47:47] this and i'm just going to read it to
[1:47:48] you it's beautiful
[1:47:51] and i thought it would help you amen
[1:47:54] we
[1:47:56] we all know
[1:47:57] that paul talks about
[1:47:59] you know you're transformed into what
[1:48:01] you gaze at
[1:48:03] what you feed on you become
[1:48:06] what you gaze at you're transformed into
[1:48:07] that see
[1:48:10] so now where's your priorities
[1:48:13] how often do you
[1:48:15] turn on a tape in your vehicle or on the
[1:48:17] job or at night or in your home
[1:48:22] how often do you sit for hours and just
[1:48:25] let god speak to you
[1:48:27] how often do you spend time in prayer
[1:48:29] for a little while
[1:48:32] see
[1:48:35] so this is a mirror
[1:48:38] and paul said the problem is
[1:48:40] people
[1:48:41] come to church they
[1:48:43] they look in the mirror of god's word
[1:48:45] and god shows them really what they are
[1:48:48] wow i got a lot of work to do
[1:48:50] oh oh man i didn't know he knew that
[1:48:55] wow you mean i okay lord okay you help
[1:48:57] me jesus i'll do my best
[1:48:59] amen this is a mirror and paul said the
[1:49:01] problem is people leave the church
[1:49:03] you'll leave here today i promise you
[1:49:05] well you won't stay here all day
[1:49:07] people leave this building
[1:49:08] and completely forget the manner of
[1:49:11] person that showed them they were
[1:49:13] when they were in this anointing
[1:49:16] i see where i'm at i see where i need to
[1:49:18] be i see what it's going to take to get
[1:49:20] from here to there okay lord i'm in
[1:49:22] and then they leave now what was my
[1:49:24] laodicean plan what was i doing okay
[1:49:26] which where let me see okay
[1:49:28] and and they never think about god's
[1:49:30] plan again until next service if they
[1:49:31] happen to make it
[1:49:33] amen all right
[1:49:35] so here's the testimony of a man doing
[1:49:37] just that he's looking in the mirror
[1:49:42] and the man in the mirror said to him i
[1:49:43] love this man
[1:49:45] i love this

[1:49:58] mirror said

[1:50:02] right now

[1:50:06] said the man gazing back
[1:50:08] the chapters you've been writing in your
[1:50:10] book of acts since the day the lord
[1:50:11] entered your heart amen

[1:50:20] so pick up the pace

[1:54:22] in the chronicles of the kingdom
[1:54:24] i want my life to be that

[1:54:38] the blood erased all the bad stuff and
[1:54:40] i'm only going to get here the good
[1:54:41] stuff
[1:54:42] so i just raise up my hands and i say
[1:54:44] lord i don't worry about the content but
[1:54:47] i want it to be a big old book
[1:54:49] i wanted to be thick with
[1:54:51] accomplishments with victories that i
[1:54:54] allowed you to have
[1:54:55] through me
[1:54:58] i surrendered my mind
[1:55:01] i quit being me i started being you
[1:55:05] lord i
[1:55:07] as i as i was testifying to the brothers
[1:55:10] yesterday i that that moved me lord
[1:55:13] [Music]
[1:55:15] when i was studying and i was thinking
[1:55:16] about all that i wanted to do and become
[1:55:22] and i just said
[1:55:24] i just said lord
[1:55:26] if i could just
[1:55:28] if i could just every day
[1:55:30] think only your thoughts and if i could
[1:55:31] just
[1:55:32] every day
[1:55:34] be pleasing to the father if i could
[1:55:36] just every day
[1:55:37] let my whole life be according to the
[1:55:39] word if i could just if i could do all
[1:55:42] of that then i
[1:55:44] and lord something spoke out of me and
[1:55:46] said
[1:55:47] lord i'd be you
[1:55:50] i'd be you
[1:55:52] if i could be the if i could go every
[1:55:54] day and be pleasing to the father i'd be
[1:55:56] you
[1:55:58] and then i thought to myself why that's
[1:56:00] the very goal
[1:56:02] to be like him
[1:56:04] to come into his very image that's why
[1:56:06] you say your words why i'm here that's

[1:59:57] i mean he wrote the words
[1:59:59] that we enter into his gate with
[2:00:01] thanksgiving
[2:00:03] but he also knew lord he's a human man
[2:00:06] full of frailty and he said lord
[2:00:09] remember
[2:00:11] we are but dust
[2:00:13] i'm just dust
[2:00:15] have mercy on me oh god according to thy
