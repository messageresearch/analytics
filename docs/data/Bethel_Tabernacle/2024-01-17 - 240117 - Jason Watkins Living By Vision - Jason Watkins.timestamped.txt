[0:34] praise the Lord Proverbs chapter
[0:40] 29 I wasn't scheduled to preach tonight
[0:43] but I was happy when they said let us go
[0:45] to the house of the Lord amen and I um I
[0:49] was able to one of my the uh the morning
[0:54] Bible studies that I do and uh this was
[0:58] the first one I've done this year did
[0:59] did one last year the um the school up
[1:02] there Bao is that what it's called I
[1:05] think uh ra is that it's Bao up there in
[1:08] Washington state I mean in in Canada
[1:10] yeah and so
[1:13] uh they have different ministers come on
[1:15] and do morning devotion so the other
[1:17] morning Tuesday Morning in fact
[1:18] yesterday morning I actually took a
[1:21] version of this sermon tonight which
[1:23] wasn't a sermon it was just a little
[1:25] bible study 20 minutes long don't worry
[1:28] I'm going to preach longer than 20
[1:29] minutes
[1:30] [Laughter]
[1:32] and uh as I was signing off the air I
[1:34] thought to myself I said my goodness
[1:36] that would I would love to figure out a
[1:38] way to preach that as a whole sermon
[1:40] well the Lord just opened up the windows
[1:42] of Heaven that's what we're going to do
[1:44] praise the Lord Proverbs chapter
[1:48] 29 and we're just going to read one
[1:50] verse and the reason we're only going to
[1:52] take one verse is because we're going to
[1:54] read it from multiple translations but
[1:57] we'll read this one and we'll let you be
[2:00] seated Proverbs chap 29 I want to speak
[2:03] to you tonight on a title be thou my
[2:09] vision amen praise the
[2:12] Lord sister Deborah I thought you was
[2:14] starting up with that for a second when
[2:15] I heard that Celtic song that she was
[2:17] singing I started to walk out and go
[2:19] okay and as soon as you're done with
[2:20] that one start on this one be thou my
[2:22] vision it's a very popular song Amen a
[2:26] servant I'm sorry verse 18 proverb 29:
[2:32] 18 where there is no
[2:35] vision the people
[2:37] perish you don't want to perish do you
[2:41] where there is no vision the people
[2:43] perish but he that keepeth the law happy
[2:47] is he may the Lord bless the reading of
[2:50] his word you can be
[2:52] seated
[2:58] amen praise the Lord go Ahad and put my
[3:00] title slide up brother Gideon
[3:07] amen it's interesting the various
[3:11] meanings that this word Vision has in
[3:15] the Old
[3:16] Testament and one of the correlations
[3:19] that you're going to see is it's
[3:22] attached in the Hebrew to the word
[3:25] revelation I could in fact is one of the
[3:28] translations says it pretty much exactly
[3:30] like that that where there is no
[3:34] Revelation the people perish because it
[3:38] is
[3:39] revelation that gives us Vision now you
[3:42] see that you see that right there our
[3:44] forward Vision
[3:46] 2019 this is one of those little quirky
[3:48] things today I was telling sister Debbie
[3:50] about that normally I go to a kind of a
[3:54] a recent PowerPoints I'll have three or
[3:57] four different designs in there and I'll
[4:00] just pick
[4:01] one duplicate it open it and then change
[4:04] all the insides of it change all the
[4:07] data so today when I was studying I
[4:09] thought for some reason for some weird
[4:12] reason I thought you know I'm gonna just
[4:14] go all the way back I I haven't done
[4:15] this in years I'm going to go back to my
[4:18] my larger repository and just see what
[4:21] strikes me and when I open it of course
[4:24] it opens up you know and all kinds of
[4:26] thumbnails and I saw that thumbnail and
[4:29] I thought yeah I think that that kind of
[4:32] a a rustic way um you know we're we're
[4:35] going to talk a little bit about Celtic
[4:38] uh the Christian Movement there under St
[4:40] Patrick and that kind of looked a little
[4:42] rugged amen and I thought and when I
[4:45] opened it I saw those words our forward
[4:49] vision and I'm preaching tonight on be
[4:52] thou my our vision be thou my vision now
[4:56] you'll notice in 2019 so one of the
[4:58] first things
[5:00] that I had to do was update
[5:05] it amen so we're not using that title
[5:08] nor am I using those notes but I did
[5:10] pick these verses th this was the verse
[5:15] this was the very verse I wanted to use
[5:19] I mean my mind was just blown for a few
[5:22] minutes and I said Lord you're surely in
[5:26] this now I'm going to let you go with it
[5:29] go through it with
[5:31] me from the new king New King James
[5:35] Version the
[5:37] nkjv where there is no Revelation the
[5:42] people cast off
[5:45] restraint I'm gonna tell you something
[5:47] friends that that right there when I
[5:50] when I read that version of it you know
[5:52] where there's no vision the people
[5:54] perish what it's saying is that people
[5:57] without a without a headship in Christ
[6:00] people without a revealed word you're
[6:02] just going to go any way of the world
[6:04] and I don't want to go any way of the
[6:05] world and I don't you want you to and I
[6:08] don't want here's what we don't want to
[6:09] have to do we don't want to have to
[6:11] figure it
[6:13] out I want it to be revealed I don't
[6:17] want to have to react and spend my whole
[6:20] Christian Life reacting and going to the
[6:24] drawing board I'd just rather already
[6:26] know what's going to happen I'd already
[6:28] I already already would rather know the
[6:30] answer I already want to know the re the
[6:33] uh the result of it so that I am not
[6:37] operating in a reactive way I'm actually
[6:40] in God's word we're able to be proactive
[6:43] you can proactively be
[6:46] victorious you can be victorious in a
[6:50] trial tonight you won't face till
[6:53] tomorrow amen are we dealing talking
[6:57] about the Realms of Eternity we're not
[6:58] talking about time now we're going into
[7:00] God's realm and so in fact is when I
[7:02] when I thought about it I thought you
[7:04] know I might invert that and call it our
[7:06] vision forward but I actually on purpose
[7:10] thought no I'm going to leave it just
[7:12] like that because you're going to want
[7:14] to have a vision and if you're going to
[7:17] have a vision it it needs to be a
[7:19] forward Vision because I don't know
[7:21] about you but I'm going
[7:23] forward we're in the new year and I
[7:25] don't plan to stay around much longer I
[7:29] certainly don't want to languish in the
[7:31] past I want to go forward forward
[7:35] forward onward and
[7:38] upward amen so it is our forward Vision
[7:43] first of all you need a vision without
[7:44] it you
[7:46] perish but you need a vision that will
[7:49] help you go forward amen now if you're
[7:52] failing and stumbling you're not really
[7:54] going forward you are moving along as
[7:57] brother uh stepen cof preached you know
[8:00] whether you have your ups and downs
[8:02] you're still on a journey headed to a
[8:04] destination but okay great I'm happy for
[8:07] my destination but I'd like to count for
[8:11] something while I'm here I'd like to
[8:14] accomplish something I don't just want
[8:15] to stumble across the Finish Line I'd
[8:18] like to go across Finish Line
[8:22] running that's why I used to run track
[8:24] and field I crossed the Finish Line
[8:26] sprinting see our forward Vision where
[8:32] there is no
[8:34] Revelation the people cast off
[8:37] restraint so you know if if you're
[8:40] having a hard time with Sanctified
[8:43] lifestyle you might want to visit your
[8:46] prayer life you might want to think
[8:47] about your church schedule you might
[8:48] want to think about more fellowship with
[8:50] the right people you might want to
[8:53] deduct some things out of your life not
[8:56] just pack up but brother brandham said
[8:58] unpack back see so we we need to make
[9:03] sure that we're not casting off
[9:06] restraint amen when here it is from the
[9:09] New Living
[9:11] Translation when people do not accept
[9:14] Divine guidance they run
[9:17] wild and
[9:19] how oh my goodness could I spend the
[9:23] rest of the service tonight testifying
[9:24] to that reading it that way when people
[9:28] do not except Divine guidance they run
[9:31] wild and I'm not talking about my
[9:33] guidance I'm talking about Divine
[9:37] guidance I mean I my guidance could hit
[9:39] and miss but Divine guidance is always
[9:42] perfect now it might not not always seem
[9:45] like the way to you but trust me it's
[9:49] perfect here's another one from Eugene
[9:52] Peterson's message translation if people
[9:55] can't see what God is doing they stumble
[9:58] over all over themselves but when they
[10:01] attend to what he reveals they are Most
[10:04] Blessed now this is exactly why every
[10:08] time those first four seals open under a
[10:12] lion and an ox and a man and a flying
[10:15] eagle the spirit of the living creature
[10:18] says come and
[10:20] see come and observe come and take
[10:23] notice come and come and pay attention
[10:26] because something is happening that
[10:29] that's not just hyperbole it's not just
[10:32] a story it's not just a parable this is
[10:35] happening in real time there's an
[10:36] antichrist and there's a Christ amen and
[10:40] you're being led by one or the other and
[10:42] if you can't see what God is doing you
[10:45] know you you need to think about again
[10:48] you need to figure out what it is that's
[10:50] hindering your vision of God's presence
[10:55] in your life God's blessing in your life
[11:00] God's plan for your life going forward
[11:03] it's all about a vision it's all about
[11:08] Revelation here it is from the Amplified
[11:11] version where there is no vision
[11:16] no of God the people
[11:20] perish that is a an amazing
[11:25] statement you
[11:27] agree
[11:30] now let me me do one quick thing
[11:38] here ready
[11:45] okay all
[11:48] right so where there is no vision where
[11:52] there is no Redemptive revelation of God
[11:56] the people perish friends
[11:59] you know the devil is just
[12:02] nasty he's hateful he's
[12:06] mean he's a murderer he's a liar the
[12:11] last thing he wants you doing when you
[12:14] wake up in the morning is having a hope
[12:18] for the world to come or to have a hope
[12:21] that you are a son and daughter of God
[12:24] or to have a hope that that the token is
[12:27] over your home or to have a hope that
[12:28] angels are en encamped around you that's
[12:32] the last thing he wants but you can rest
[12:34] assure they are he is and you are going
[12:38] in a Rapture and and so so you you need
[12:42] to have this re Revelation that you are
[12:46] redeemed that you have passed from Death
[12:48] un life that you can never come into the
[12:51] Judgment you need to have a revelation
[12:53] that there is now right now therefore no
[12:56] condemnation even possible to them who
[12:59] are in Christ as I've said before you
[13:02] are
[13:04] unindictable you cannot be charged the
[13:07] Lord won't even hear the case that's
[13:09] right it that that that that judgment
[13:12] has already been passed and he will not
[13:14] even hear the charge against you because
[13:18] God is only looking from the Eternal
[13:20] perspective thank God I'm standing here
[13:24] tonight as a man who says thank God that
[13:27] that's true amen amen and so if I'm
[13:31] going to be successful if I'm not if I'm
[13:34] not going to just fall down in
[13:37] discouragement and despair then I'm
[13:39] going to need to have a Redemptive
[13:42] revelation of God that I know he is and
[13:47] that I know he keeps his word and that I
[13:49] know he loves me and that he knows who I
[13:53] am so I think that we could have
[13:56] established tonight and I think you
[13:57] would agree with me me that vision is
[14:00] the key Revelation is the key come and
[14:04] see come and see come and see it keeps
[14:08] saying that the living creature keeps
[14:10] saying that come and see every Age come
[14:13] and see here's a new anointing come and
[14:15] see there's an eagle anointing which
[14:17] means there's a pale horse rider come
[14:20] and see you need to see
[14:23] this you can't you can hardly know God
[14:26] if you can't see him and I want to tell
[14:29] you something friends this is the age
[14:30] where you need to be able to see him you
[14:33] need to be able to see his movements you
[14:36] need to be able to keep time with the
[14:38] rhythm of the Holy Ghost you need to be
[14:40] able to move when the Holy Spirit is
[14:42] moving
[14:44] amen so vision is the key so that if
[14:49] vision is the key then I don't think
[14:51] that there is really anything that we
[14:54] could desire more from God than to be
[14:58] able to say say be thou my vision I'm
[15:02] happy if he's your vision but I need him
[15:04] to be
[15:06] mine I'm glad he was brother brandom's
[15:09] I'm glad he was Paul's I'm glad he was
[15:11] Moses's Vision but I need him to be my
[15:17] vision I need him to be my
[15:27] vision we sing the song it's actually a
[15:30] a poem be thou my vision is actually you
[15:34] know it's a traditional Christian Hymn
[15:36] of of Irish
[15:38] origin and it's actually based on a
[15:41] Middle Ages Irish poem I don't know if
[15:43] you knew that but it's actually based on
[15:46] a Middle Ages Irish poem that has been
[15:50] attributed to to this man if right right
[15:54] here to this man right here now you
[15:57] can't hardly find a picture that's not
[15:59] all Catholic
[16:01] up it's been Catholic but St D of for
[16:06] haale I have no idea if he's a saint uh
[16:09] brother brandham said you have to be
[16:11] living to be a saint which is the
[16:13] opposite of Rome they say you have to be
[16:15] dead and brother Bram says well Saint
[16:18] means Sanctified one so how are you a
[16:21] saint if you're not alive living a
[16:23] Sanctified life hello
[16:26] Saints see I do know this he he wrote a
[16:30] a wonderful uh poem Dinan for forgal
[16:35] from the he was sixth Century Irish poet
[16:39] and
[16:40] scholar and so you know they there they
[16:44] a little bit history is a little bit
[16:46] iffy and I don't want to say that I know
[16:48] it particularly because even historians
[16:50] say somewhere between the 6th and the
[16:53] 14th
[16:55] century uh this this poem was discovered
[16:58] and they think it was written maybe in
[17:00] the sixth or maybe in the eth some
[17:02] Scholars say the eth most that I could
[17:04] find go take take it back to this uh man
[17:07] here in the 6th Century but in
[17:10] 1905 the poem was translated into
[17:13] English by Mary burn and then it was
[17:16] versified by elanar Hull later in
[17:20] 1912 and it became the song that we sing
[17:24] commonly today however when you hear the
[17:28] song song sung uh it's it's really you
[17:32] know once once it got turned into a song
[17:35] it it really departed in a number of
[17:38] ways from the original poem and in fact
[17:41] is the original poem is is is sung to
[17:45] the tune of an Irish folk Melody that
[17:49] was first published in 1909 remember
[17:52] before a song just a poem was wasn't a
[17:54] song at all but in
[17:56] 1909 uh it was put into a song and sung
[18:01] to the tune of an Irish folk Melody
[18:03] called slain now not slain SL a i n but
[18:07] s l n e and fact is the hill of slain is
[18:14] what it is famous for and the the hill
[18:18] of slain is actually a very important
[18:20] complex it has some prehistoric history
[18:22] some early um um what we would call the
[18:26] Christian era history it has met
[18:28] medieval monuments that are there it's
[18:30] located in Ireland it's actually
[18:32] situated a little Northwest of the
[18:36] village of slain from who it's named and
[18:38] the village R I think the hill Rises 158
[18:42] meters above sea level
[18:44] now the hill of slain is known the
[18:49] reason it's famous in Ireland is because
[18:52] of its association with St Patrick amen
[18:56] so we we find that St Patrick let me let
[18:59] me get my ducks in a row here
[19:07] okay
[19:09] you
[19:10] so it's Associated then with St Patrick
[19:15] H that's not not the one I want thank
[19:20] you all right and the reason that it is
[19:23] associated with St Patrick is because
[19:26] you remember that St Patrick was uh a
[19:30] young teenager about 16 most historians
[19:33] think he was around 16 he was a he was a
[19:36] child of of Roman parents who when Rome
[19:40] had had invaded the the British Isles
[19:43] and he was actually playing along the
[19:46] shore and Irish Raiders kidnapped him
[19:49] and a bunch of people they were slavers
[19:51] and he actually had Roman parents and he
[19:54] was hiding in the bushes but they
[19:56] discovered him and they took him captive
[19:58] and took him back to Ireland now
[20:01] actually in Patrick's Memoirs he
[20:04] actually held no um even at the time
[20:08] even even when he was taken captive and
[20:11] he he actually felt that it was
[20:14] justified by God to do it because he
[20:17] knew that he had been a sinful young man
[20:19] he knew that you know his his his his
[20:22] family and his nation and even the area
[20:25] where he lived that they had really not
[20:29] lived according to the laws of God and
[20:32] nature and so he actually felt like they
[20:34] deserved it he became a chrisan while he
[20:36] was in captivity in Ireland which was
[20:39] pretty amazing because it was filled
[20:41] with Druids and all kinds of mysticism
[20:44] and and uh devil worship and things like
[20:47] that but we find then that that while he
[20:51] was he was there he was working I think
[20:53] about seven years for uh like an
[20:57] indentured servant and and he actually
[21:01] as he became a Christian now he's just
[21:03] he's very young he gets captured at 16
[21:06] and he's there for about seven years so
[21:08] during those formative years of his teen
[21:11] teens and his early 20s he actually
[21:14] records in his own writings that so
[21:17] great was his love and his relationship
[21:20] to the Lord that he would often pray a
[21:23] hundred times a day amen while he was 10
[21:28] to the
[21:29] herds and then he would pray a hundred
[21:32] more times at night in fact as he he he
[21:36] records one time that he stayed on the
[21:38] mountain side in freezing weather with
[21:41] freezing rain and sleep uh so that just
[21:45] so that he could rise very early the
[21:48] next morning and be on the hill and so
[21:51] he could start praying immediately and
[21:53] he didn't have to Journey there and
[21:55] start praying he could just wake up and
[21:57] start praying amen this was the
[21:59] dedication of Patrick and actually he
[22:02] one night he had a dream that he he's
[22:05] he's somewhere in his early to mid 20s
[22:08] and he had a dream that he got on a ship
[22:12] out in the ocean and it took him home to
[22:15] Britain and sure enough the very next
[22:18] day guess what he was on a ship headed
[22:20] to Britain and he fled his captors and
[22:23] ran off and they they didn't manage to
[22:26] catch him until it was too late he was
[22:28] already on the boat and there was others
[22:29] with him who had made a big big dash for
[22:31] it and escaped on this ship and when
[22:34] they got back to to Britain it's like a
[22:36] three-day Voyage as best I could find
[22:39] but even when they got back to Britain
[22:42] they you know it wasn't the UK as we
[22:44] know it today but he had about a almost
[22:48] 25 to 30 days of walking through the
[22:53] Wilderness just trying to get back home
[22:55] he just they just made it to the island
[22:57] and and then he had you know 28 days I
[23:00] think is one number that I heard uh that
[23:02] he he finally got back to his family and
[23:05] and you know and they were starving and
[23:07] all the people who were with him started
[23:09] to taunt him and say Patrick we're going
[23:11] to die of starvation where's that God of
[23:14] yours and Patrick basically told them
[23:17] the same thing Joon of Arc told the
[23:19] French army God can't bless us if you're
[23:22] cussing and drinking and there's women
[23:25] following the camp you got to get rid of
[23:27] all these can't prostitutes you got to
[23:29] throw out all your alcohol you got to
[23:31] stop cursing and taking the lord's name
[23:33] in vain and the and the French army said
[23:35] okay uh Joan that's what we'll do and
[23:38] they did it and then she started winning
[23:41] battles Patrick told him the same thing
[23:43] I stand in this pull pit and tell you
[23:45] the same thing you want the power of God
[23:47] moving in your life you need to get rid
[23:48] of the world you need to push out
[23:50] brother Ram said push out the world and
[23:52] the Lord will come in and occupy that
[23:55] place is that what you want friends oh
[23:57] oh that's what I want so much I want to
[24:00] I want to I want to have a vision I want
[24:02] to have the power of the Risen
[24:08] Christ and so he began to tell them if
[24:11] you you're going to have to dedicate
[24:12] your heart you know I I I'm dedicated
[24:15] but you're going to need to be dedicated
[24:17] if you get dedicated God will preserve
[24:18] us and they did and he did and they came
[24:22] actually they they stumbled upon a herd
[24:25] of of abandoned swine that were
[24:29] themselves half starved so they were
[24:31] they were they really were too weak to
[24:32] even run away so the people were able to
[24:34] kill and eat and they were sustained and
[24:36] he got home to his parents and then and
[24:39] then he in but before actually I left
[24:42] this out before he got home to his
[24:45] parents the poor brother got captured
[24:49] again but the Lord came to him uh in the
[24:52] night and said Patrick told him in an
[24:54] audible voice said don't worry you'll
[24:56] only be captured for two two days and
[24:58] you'll be free and sure enough on the
[24:59] third day he managed to get his freedom
[25:02] and he made his way home and then he was
[25:04] there with his parents for a little
[25:05] season and then that voice of the Lord
[25:08] come back to him again and he started
[25:10] having dreams had like three or four
[25:11] dreams in a row three or four nights in
[25:13] a row and he kept seeing uh people from
[25:16] Ireland saying Patrick come back to us
[25:18] Patrick come back to us we need your
[25:20] help Patrick come back and over the
[25:23] cries of his parents I mean here's a
[25:25] young man that had just had just fled
[25:27] captivity for seven years and now he's
[25:30] going to go back but I'm going to tell
[25:31] you what he he he formed over 200
[25:35] churches he baptized personally baptized
[25:39] a 100,000
[25:43] people I mean this this man was serious
[25:47] about his relationship to
[25:50] God and on on on and so Christianity
[25:53] began to take over and you had this uh
[25:57] this this
[25:58] King uh it's it's pronounced almost like
[26:01] we would say the word Larry it's
[26:04] laori and and if you say it in Irish it
[26:07] sounds like they're saying I actually
[26:09] consulted a a a gallic or n or Celtic
[26:12] whatever that language that they speak
[26:14] in the old country and he said no it's
[26:16] it's pronounced Larry and I said well it
[26:19] sounds like Larry I have an Uncle Larry
[26:21] and and so so he he was the king of Tara
[26:25] and the reason that the the reason that
[26:28] the hill was
[26:31] so attached to St Patrick is because he
[26:34] got tired of of all these this Christian
[26:37] growth of Christianity now remember
[26:40] brother brandham said the Catholic
[26:42] Church claims St Patrick and brother
[26:45] Bram said he was no more Catholic than I
[26:47] am said he spoke in tongues and raised
[26:50] the dead and the power God moved in his
[26:52] life he was definitely not
[26:55] Catholic and so this kid King Larry the
[26:59] king of Tara he made a
[27:02] proclamation that no one on on the on
[27:07] Sunday this the coming Sunday could
[27:11] light a fire and so well he was talking
[27:16] to the wrong brother because when
[27:18] Patrick got a hold of that decree and
[27:22] the King had said whoever does it he was
[27:24] the king of Ireland said wasn't just
[27:25] teror he was actually the Ancient King
[27:27] of
[27:28] and he said whoever does it I'll put him
[27:29] to death Patrick went straight to that
[27:32] hill and he didn't just light a fire he
[27:35] built a
[27:37] bonfire and and you could see that fire
[27:40] look at look it into the into the
[27:42] distance you could see that fire for
[27:45] miles and miles away I'm going to tell
[27:49] you something friends this is a this
[27:51] this was a brother who you're kin
[27:54] to this man knew the Holy Ghost like you
[27:57] know the Holy Ghost this man will be in
[27:59] glory like you're in glory I can't wait
[28:01] to meet him I want to say Patrick oh
[28:04] tell me about the days when you defied
[28:07] the the king Lowry and you built your
[28:09] bonfire on the hill tell me about 200
[28:13] churches and a
[28:14] 100,000 baptisms my so so brother
[28:19] brandham says it like this now because
[28:22] I'll read you that one in a second let
[28:23] me let me catch this note
[28:26] first so
[28:28] so we when we think about this
[28:31] poem The the hymn are really the the the
[28:36] poem
[28:37] expresses the desire to have God as your
[28:43] vision that was what that Saint whatever
[28:46] his name was Dian or whatever his name
[28:48] was that's what he was writing about and
[28:50] his
[28:51] inspiration was off of St Patrick and
[28:55] his courageous Hilltop
[28:58] bonfire and so and so that's why they
[29:02] they actually they the it they actually
[29:05] called it originally the poem was uh
[29:08] using that title of slain S L A and E
[29:11] referring to that hill so it expresses
[29:15] the desire to have God as the vision to
[29:19] have God in your wisdom to have God as
[29:22] your
[29:23] Delight to have God as your shelter
[29:26] there's a big one
[29:28] to have God as your
[29:31] treasure you're going to have to decide
[29:33] do you want riches or
[29:36] Treasures that's a big decision here in
[29:39] leoa Friends make your choice tonight
[29:42] you want you want riches or you want
[29:44] Treasures I'll take
[29:46] Treasures Hallelujah if I'm going to get
[29:49] riches it's going to be gold tried in
[29:51] the
[29:52] fire the song expresses the desire to
[29:56] have God as the ruler of your life the
[30:00] text of the poem is actually a prayer
[30:04] that asks for the presence of God in
[30:08] every aspect of the speaker's life in
[30:11] other words if you're going to get on
[30:13] your knees and pray the prayer of slain
[30:16] then you're going to be asking God to be
[30:21] present in every aspect of your life it
[30:24] asks that God be your
[30:27] meditation be your speech be your
[30:31] understanding amen the prayer goes on to
[30:34] ask God uh God's protection in battle as
[30:39] well as to preserve your dignity and to
[30:42] just downright be your
[30:45] Delight he is he is my delight amen
[30:51] whoever is praying this prayer
[30:54] slain is is seeking Refuge in God and it
[30:59] and it and actually has the audacity to
[31:02] ask God that they someday be raised up
[31:07] to live with the
[31:09] angels the prayer ends with a plea for
[31:13] God's love to be in their heart and
[31:17] their soul and above all for them to be
[31:20] granted a place in the Kingdom of
[31:24] Heaven where do you want to retire
[31:26] friends
[31:29] for me the Kingdom of Heaven is all I
[31:32] long
[31:36] for brother brandham says it this way
[31:38] one of my favorite quotes I started to
[31:40] play in the soundtrack tonight but I
[31:43] didn't I just want you to be able to
[31:44] read
[31:46] it in his Hebrews series Hebrews chapter

[32:52] price that no one else was willing to
[32:55] pay on your behalf and you you couldn't
[32:57] pay it and and and if all the population
[33:00] of the Earth paid it it still wouldn't

[34:48] race Paul says there's no there's no um
[34:53] no military person allows himself to be
[34:57] encumbered with the things of the world
