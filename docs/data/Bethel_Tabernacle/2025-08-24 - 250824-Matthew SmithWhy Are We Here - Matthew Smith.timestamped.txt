[0:00] Real
[0:02] cheerful verse here
[0:06] says,
[0:10] "Man that is born of a woman is of a few
[0:14] days and full of trouble. He cometh
[0:16] forth like a flower and is cut down. He
[0:19] fleth also as a shadow and continuth
[0:23] not."
[0:25] Ask the Lord would put uh put a blessing
[0:27] on the reading of the words. you all be
[0:29] seated. Um I want to read
[0:33] uh I guess I'll I'll I'll start um just
[0:37] kind of I'll give you my title. Uh my
[0:39] title is just a question and it is why
[0:43] are we here, right? And I don't mean
[0:46] necessarily why are we in Bethl
[0:49] Tabernacle and this building on this day
[0:51] or why are we in Bufort or why are you
[0:53] know we in the place that we are in our
[0:55] life or anything like that. Although
[0:57] that is kind of partly tied into what
[0:59] I'm trying to get at here, but obviously
[1:01] there's like that deep question that
[1:03] people have been struggling with from
[1:04] the dawn of time, which is why is
[1:06] humanity here? What's our point? What's
[1:07] the purpose of all of this? Um,
[1:11] you know, to I took, you know, as the
[1:15] angsty youth that I was, you know, like
[1:18] the phrase life is pain and then you
[1:20] die, right? Life can be really miserable
[1:23] and it's suffer. There's a lot of
[1:24] suffering. It's pretty awful. You you're
[1:28] gonna you're going to suffer. You're
[1:29] going to you're going to be hurt. People
[1:30] are going to take advantage of you.
[1:32] You're going to be, you know, abused and
[1:34] abandoned or betrayed. You're going to
[1:37] fail yourself in a lot of ways. A lot of
[1:38] things that you thought you'd be better
[1:40] than and then it turns out you really
[1:41] were not better than, right? And a lot
[1:43] of times the people that hurt you the
[1:45] most is the guy in the mirror. And it's
[1:48] a lot of a lot of suffering and pain and
[1:50] people take advantage and and a lot of
[1:53] heartache that goes with life. And so
[1:55] the question is what's the point right
[1:58] why would we go through all this why
[2:00] would God who loves us put us in a
[2:02] situation in which we go through this
[2:05] you know go through all these difficult
[2:06] things right um James 4:13
[2:11] go to now ye that say today or tomorrow
[2:14] we will go into such a city and continue
[2:16] there a year and buy and sell and get
[2:19] gain whereas you know not what shall be
[2:22] on the tomorrow for what is your life.
[2:25] It is even a vapor that appearth for a
[2:27] little time, then vanishth away, right?
[2:31] I mean, you you it's it's it's short.
[2:34] Life is short and painful. And at the
[2:37] end of it, your reward is dying, right?
[2:41] And that's that's a pretty bleak outlook
[2:43] on life. And a lot of people are in that
[2:45] place in the in this day and age. A lot
[2:47] of people have that outlook on life.
[2:50] Um because if there's no hope, that's
[2:52] all you've got, right? If there is no if
[2:54] there's no hope of redemption as Paul
[2:56] said, then eat, drink, and be merry for
[2:57] tomorrow we die. Right? There's no hope
[3:00] for anything more, if there's no there's
[3:03] no reason for any of this, then then
[3:05] hedonism is your answer, right? Do all
[3:09] do all the drugs because that's all
[3:10] you've got, right? What I mean, if if
[3:14] there is no hope for tomorrow, if
[3:15] there's no brighter future that once
[3:17] they throw sod in your face, that's it,
[3:18] and it's over, then what's the argument,
[3:22] &gt;&gt; right? you've got one vapor to get all
[3:26] you can out of.
[3:28] And so, you know, and then even even
[3:31] then we say, well, our purpose is the is
[3:33] the is the Holy Ghost. And that's true.
[3:34] I'm not please don't take what I'm about
[3:36] to say as a dis discrediting of that.
[3:39] Um, but even then, you know, you get the
[3:42] Holy Ghost and and you got the the the
[3:43] Lord operating in your life and even
[3:45] then it doesn't fix everything, right?
[3:48] In Romans 7:18, for I know that in me,
[3:52] that is in my flesh, dwelleth no good
[3:54] thing. For for to will is present with
[3:57] me, but how to perform that which is
[3:59] good, I find not. For the good that I
[4:02] would do, I do not, but the evil which I
[4:05] would not, that I do. So, here's Paul as
[4:08] a Holy Ghostfilled believer is still
[4:11] battling his flesh. He's still in a
[4:13] fight. It's still a fight. Even as Paul
[4:18] um you know as you know he he suffered
[4:21] greatly for the gospel even once you
[4:22] become a Christian there's it's not like
[4:24] life just becomes easy right if anything
[4:27] life gets a whole lot harder because now
[4:29] you know you know all right so in the
[4:31] Bible when it says the guilty prosper
[4:32] you know the wicked you know I mean all
[4:35] throughout the Bible there's different
[4:35] different people who have struggled with
[4:37] this like Lord why is it that I see
[4:39] wicked people
[4:41] have abundance why do evil people seem
[4:44] to prosper well it's Because the God of
[4:47] this world, which is not Jehovah,
[4:50] is not constantly oppressing them. He
[4:52] has no reason to. He's they're his
[4:55] children, right? And God has no reason
[4:57] to chastise them. They're not his
[4:59] children either, right? He God's not
[5:02] going to Why would God, you know, oppose
[5:05] their success? They're not his children.
[5:07] He doesn't chastise not his own. And
[5:09] Satan's not going to not going to bother
[5:12] them. You know, they may have some
[5:13] consequences of their own actions, but
[5:14] that's their own actions, right? You may
[5:16] have somebody, you know, fall into
[5:18] addiction or what what have you, but
[5:20] again, that's the consequences of their
[5:21] own actions. You could have people lie,
[5:23] cheat, and steal, and as long as they
[5:24] play their cards right, they'll be a
[5:25] millionaire on on on,
[5:28] you know, deception and lies. So,
[5:32] you know,
[5:34] but but the reason they can do that is
[5:37] because unlike the God's children,
[5:41] you know, if you're a child of God, you
[5:43] have the God of this age, the of the God
[5:46] of the whole world is directly opposed
[5:47] to you, right? He's going to fight you.
[5:51] You're going to be in a fight. You
[5:52] wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
[5:54] against principalities and powers of the
[5:55] air. Amen.
[5:57] &gt;&gt; We are fighting against
[6:00] you know like the entire world has been
[6:02] constructed all the societies of the
[6:04] world all the the the um entertainment
[6:09] the the the culture the politics all of
[6:12] it every government there's a secret
[6:14] mastermind behind all of it and they're
[6:16] aiming everything that they have to shut
[6:18] you down to break you spiritually.
[6:20] That's what all of this is about.
[6:23] And so again, we got to wonder why are
[6:26] we doing this? Why would God do this?
[6:29] Why on earth would God, who loves us,
[6:33] put us in this sort of situation where
[6:35] it's a constant fight and it's a
[6:37] constant struggle.
[6:40] There was a um a um I heard this saying
[6:44] a long time ago. Um I've heard it a lot
[6:46] of different places, but it was kind of
[6:48] popularized by a guy by the name of
[6:49] Victor Frankle. Um he was a
[6:50] psychologist. He's also um survived the
[6:52] Holocaust. Um and he picked it up from
[6:57] um I believe the person who actually
[6:58] originally kind of coined this phrase
[6:59] was um Frederick Nichi. But the phrase
[7:02] is he who has a why to live,
[7:07] a why to live for can bear almost anyh
[7:09] how.
[7:11] Okay? If you have a why to live for, you
[7:14] can bear anyh how. Okay? In other words,
[7:19] if you've got a real reason to live, if
[7:21] there's something really driving you and
[7:22] motivating you to live, no matter what
[7:25] the circumstances of your life are, you
[7:27] will bear it. Okay? I heard a a story of
[7:30] a of a soldier. He was a um army ranger
[7:34] in um when they uh invaded um Iraq. And
[7:37] he talked a lot about how he got in a
[7:39] lot of situations where their first
[7:41] several months they were every single
[7:42] day for like 12 plus hours a day they're
[7:45] kicking in doors and getting in
[7:46] gunfights. We're talking multiple
[7:47] gunfights a day, right? For months on
[7:51] end. And he's like, "You cannot go
[7:53] through that when you get like there was
[7:55] a lot of people." And these are guys who
[7:56] went through Ranger the Ranger program,
[7:57] right? They're they're trained. A lot of
[7:58] them were were veterans of some regard.
[8:00] and they get in the middle of it and
[8:02] they and once things get really bad and
[8:04] you're in the middle of a city where
[8:05] everybody hates you and everyone's
[8:07] trying to kill you and every other day
[8:09] your convoy's getting hit by by IEDs and
[8:11] and ambushes,
[8:14] a lot of guys broke. They broke
[8:16] mentally. They couldn't do it anymore.
[8:17] They completely caved in. They lost the
[8:20] will to fight because they had no reason
[8:23] to fight. But this guy pushed through
[8:25] all of it. He said that and himself and
[8:27] himself and all the other guys who
[8:28] persevered and were able to push through
[8:30] and didn't end up with a lot of mental
[8:32] problems. It was because they had to get
[8:35] through every single day because he said
[8:37] of himself, I knew that back home there
[8:41] was a girl and a baby and if I didn't
[8:44] come home they were going to be without.
[8:47] He had a reason to fight. No matter how
[8:49] nasty things got and no matter how
[8:50] difficult and dangerous things were, he
[8:52] was able to face firefight after
[8:54] firefight without losing his mind
[8:56] because he had a wife and a baby to go
[8:58] home to at the end of all of it. There
[9:01] was somebody who was depending on him.
[9:02] He had something because the and he said
[9:05] what happens is when you're in a
[9:07] situation where life and death is on the
[9:08] line, when death becomes easier than
[9:11] life, you'll choose death.
[9:14] Right? When when it when the choice is
[9:16] offered to you, when death is easier
[9:18] than life, you'll choose death. And a
[9:21] lot of people just stop would in combat
[9:24] in warfare, a lot of people just stop
[9:26] fighting and they just give up and die
[9:29] because it's too hard. It's too much.
[9:32] Man wasn't built to survive that kind of
[9:34] environment. We weren't built for that.
[9:37] And so what happens
[9:40] the the the goal is to give people a
[9:43] why, right? If we're going to wrestle
[9:46] against the power principalities of the
[9:48] air, if we're going to fight the armies
[9:50] of of the enemy, if we're going to
[9:53] buckle down and truly be soldiers in the
[9:56] army of God, we have to have a why,
[9:59] right? You got to have a reason. It's
[10:02] it's it's more than just um
[10:06] you have to have a purpose. If you
[10:09] don't, you will cave, right? When when
[10:12] when if you do not have a reason to
[10:16] continue on, when you do not have a
[10:17] reason to bear your cross,
[10:22] then dropping the cross is always going
[10:23] to be easier, right? Dropping it and
[10:26] walking away is always going to be
[10:28] easier than taking up your cross.
[10:31] So
[10:34] we can see this in in Proverbs
[10:38] 29:18. Where there is no vision, the
[10:40] people perish. But he that keepeth the
[10:42] law happy is he.
[10:45] Without vision, right, that word vision
[10:47] specifically means uh is referenced to
[10:49] what we would think of as like a
[10:50] prophetic vision. It it it a synonym for
[10:54] that might be revelation like divine
[10:56] revelation or prophecy
[10:59] without having the word of God being
[11:02] revealed to us on a daily basis in our
[11:05] lives.
[11:07] Um
[11:09] we are going to perish. the word parish
[11:12] there, uh, if you kind of look into
[11:14] that, the the Hebrew root for that, a
[11:16] different way of translating that might
[11:18] not necessarily be parish, but more like
[11:20] um
[11:22] relaxing the standards,
[11:25] right? A way of a way of um reading this
[11:28] might be where there is no open
[11:30] revelation, the people just do whatever
[11:33] they want,
[11:35] right? People just just live any old
[11:38] kind of way.
[11:40] And and the reason for that is you
[11:43] constantly need the word of God. You
[11:45] constantly need revelation to constantly
[11:48] be driving you, constantly be
[11:50] encouraging you, constantly be be
[11:52] pushing you. Um because without that,
[11:55] you're just going to you're just going
[11:56] to you'll die. You won't have the
[11:58] strength to keep fighting.
[12:00] Now, I do want to I want to notice
[12:04] something.
[12:05] When we're looking for purpose, if we're
[12:08] we recognize that in this day and age,
[12:10] we have to have a true understanding of
[12:12] why it is that we're doing what we're
[12:14] doing, why we are fighting.
[12:18] Um what's the what's the end goal of all
[12:20] this? Why would God because it's not
[12:22] like God doesn't expect God will not
[12:24] expect his children to do something that
[12:25] he won't do himself, right? That's why
[12:27] he came to earth as a man and suffered
[12:29] and died as a man.
[12:31] God doesn't expect his children to
[12:32] suffer without being right there with
[12:34] you, right? There's a lot of tears that
[12:37] God has shed too, right?
[12:40] And why would God put himself through
[12:42] all of that if there's no reason? If
[12:44] it's all just meaningless. So God has a
[12:46] reason. God has a purpose. All of this
[12:48] had has a has a a purpose.
[12:52] And so if we look in the very beginning
[12:54] is God is Elohim, the self-existing one.
[12:58] God
[13:00] has no purpose. He's just existing. He's
[13:03] not doing anything, right? He's not even
[13:05] God technically because God is an object
[13:08] of worship and there's no one there to
[13:09] worship him. And so God first he makes
[13:12] the angels and and you know he gets
[13:14] worship but that wasn't satisfying. That
[13:17] didn't give him a purpose of being.
[13:21] So God made a family
[13:24] says this is from marriage and divorce.
[13:26] At the beginning, way back before there
[13:28] was a beginning, he wasn't even God. Did
[13:30] you know that God is an object of
[13:31] worship? And there wasn't nothing to
[13:33] worship him. He lived alone. And in him
[13:36] was attributes.
[13:38] Notice he was his attributes that was in
[13:42] him. Now it was in him to be a father.
[13:45] It was in him to be God. It was in him
[13:47] to be son. It was in in him to be
[13:49] savior. It was in him to be healer. And
[13:52] all these things here are just
[13:54] displaying his attributes. There's
[13:57] nothing out of order. You think God
[13:59] didn't see the end from the beginning?
[14:01] Certainly he did. There's nothing out of
[14:03] order. It's just displaying his
[14:05] attributes.
[14:07] Right? So we would think, oh, did God
[14:09] make a mistake by making a a a world in
[14:12] which his children might suffer or in
[14:13] which he might suffer? No. He knows the
[14:16] end from the beginning. But he has
[14:18] attributes inside of him that have to be
[14:20] expressed. Right? It's to fulfill
[14:23] himself
[14:25] to to find to to achieve the the
[14:28] fulfillment of who he is. There has to
[14:30] be an opportunity for those attributes
[14:32] to come out.
[14:34] Um man, time is I uh I I this thought
[14:38] that I'm working on it. It's a lot
[14:40] bigger than what I what I anticipated.
[14:42] And it was like um when I was putting a
[14:44] lot of my notes together this morning, I
[14:45] was like uh so like yesterday I had a
[14:48] cheeseburger and um I I grill I like
[14:51] eating burgers and I I am like I I want
[14:54] a big burger. So I have two patties and
[14:56] I have like all this the fixings and I
[14:58] put pimeino cheese on it. It's delicious
[15:00] but it's so big I can't get my my jaws
[15:02] around it. I can't get it between my
[15:03] teeth. So you kind of squish it and all
[15:05] the cheese flers out the side. Um and it
[15:06] makes a big mess. Um but it's delicious.
[15:09] It's a delicious mess. Anyways, that's
[15:10] kind of how I feel about this. I'm
[15:11] probably making a a mess, but look,
[15:14] there's a lot to it. All right, I'm
[15:16] trying to get my teeth around it.
[15:20] So, anyways, so God has a purpose,
[15:22] right? He has a purpose and and it the
[15:24] purpose is his family. What's going to
[15:26] bring fulfillment fulfillment to God?
[15:28] What's going to allow him to to achieve
[15:29] all of his attributes
[15:32] is all the suffering. It's all the it's
[15:34] all the difficulty that's going to come
[15:36] from this world because he can't be a
[15:38] savior unless there's someone to be
[15:39] saved. He can't be a father unless he
[15:41] has children. To be a father means to be
[15:44] a provider. You can't provide if you
[15:46] don't have if the if nobody has a need,
[15:49] right? He can't be a provider unless
[15:51] somebody has a need. He can't be a
[15:52] healer unless any nobody ever got sick.
[15:55] So,
[15:57] um this is so he he's he's creating a
[16:00] world in which he can he can take off a
[16:02] piece of himself and and put it into
[16:03] humanity.
[16:06] Um,
[16:08] and it this is from uh oneness, the
[16:10] sermon oneness in 1962. He says that's
[16:14] God's purpose.
[16:16] Straight up. That's God's purpose. And
[16:17] by the way, the the previous paragraph
[16:19] is him is brother Bram describing a
[16:21] family, right? He's describing a family
[16:23] in perfect order. And he says that's
[16:25] God's purpose. And his purpose as father
[16:27] supreme was to be one with his family,
[16:30] earthly family, Adam and Eve. And the
[16:33] only way that they could be one with the
[16:35] family or with God was because God's
[16:37] nature was in them. So that made them
[16:41] with God's nature in them. Then with
[16:43] each other and God, they became all one.
[16:47] Isn't that a beautiful picture? God in
[16:50] his family, father over all.
[16:55] So God in his desire to have reason and
[16:58] purpose of being made a family. Then in
[17:00] Genesis 1 uh verse 27, so God created
[17:03] man in his own image, and the image of
[17:05] God created he him, male and female
[17:07] created he them. And God blessed them,
[17:08] and God said unto them, "Be fruitful,
[17:10] and multiply, and replenish the earth,
[17:11] and subdue it, and have dominion over
[17:13] the fish of the sea, and foul of the
[17:14] air, and over every living thing that
[17:16] moveth on the earth." Then God saw that
[17:19] man was just like himself. This is just
[17:22] my my commentary. Then God saw or when
[17:25] God saw that uh man was just like
[17:27] himself and would also need a family to
[17:29] have reason for being.
[17:32] Okay. So
[17:36] God makes man. And then the in Genesis
[17:39] chapter 2 it says in the Lord God said
[17:42] it is not good that the man should be
[17:44] alone. I will make him a help meat for
[17:46] him. So God makes man in his image,
[17:51] right? God's alone. He needs a family.
[17:53] So he expresses that into man. Man's
[17:56] alone and he needs a family because why?
[17:58] He's just a reflection of God. It's the
[18:00] same thing just just replicating down.
[18:05] Um just uh help me for him. And out of
[18:07] the ground the Lord God formed every
[18:09] beast of the field and every fowl of the
[18:10] air and brought them unto Adam to see um
[18:13] what he would call them. And whatsoever
[18:15] Adam called every living creature that
[18:17] was the name thereof. And Adam gave
[18:19] names to all cattle and to the fowls of
[18:21] the air and to every beast of the field.
[18:23] But for Adam there was not found an help
[18:25] meat for him. So just like God made the
[18:28] angels, right? God needed some, you
[18:31] know, he was alone. So he made angels,
[18:33] but the angels didn't do it for him. The
[18:34] angels didn't satisfy the the need for
[18:38] companionship. It took a family to do
[18:40] that. Same thing with Adam. He has all
[18:43] companionship of all the beasts of the
[18:44] field. He has a dominion. He has a job
[18:48] to do. He has work, you know, and that's
[18:52] man, this is if I was a preacher, I
[18:55] might preach on that. Um, a lot of
[18:57] people, a lot of men when they're in in
[19:00] their family, they will go bury
[19:01] themselves in their job. They'll go bury
[19:03] themselves in a hobby. They'll go bury
[19:05] themselves in a lot of different things
[19:06] looking for purpose, right? And if they
[19:08] don't find it there, then they'll go
[19:09] find it in a bottle, right? Or or, you
[19:11] know, somewhere else. They'll go find
[19:13] people will look for something. And a
[19:16] lot of people
[19:18] look for something other everywhere
[19:19] other than what God intended you to have
[19:21] as your purpose for being, which is your
[19:24] family. God gave you a family, an actual
[19:29] flesh and blood family. That is your
[19:31] purpose in life. God didn't just tell
[19:33] people to be fruitful and multiply for
[19:35] no reason.
[19:37] It's not just
[19:40] empty words, right? There is there is a
[19:44] purpose hum the foundation for human
[19:47] purpose and and and desire to live. The
[19:50] reason you get up every day and and face
[19:53] the suffering of the world is because
[19:55] you have a family. You have a wife or a
[19:58] husband and children and that is what
[20:00] God gave you to to give you purpose in
[20:02] the in in this day. Right? So many
[20:04] people in this modern time, young people
[20:07] across the world and especially in
[20:09] America have a we're having mental
[20:12] health crisises. Um, suicide rates
[20:14] amongst young people is astronomically
[20:16] high. Nobody knows what what's going on.
[20:19] Well, maybe it's because for the last
[20:21] 60, 70 years, we've taken a wrecking
[20:23] ball to the concept of the family.
[20:26] Young men, if you feel purposeless in
[20:29] life, go get married and have a kid. You
[20:31] will have a reason to get out of bed
[20:32] every morning. I promise.
[20:35] Right, young women, get married, have a
[20:38] baby, right? All of your like doom
[20:41] scrolling goes out the window.
[20:44] The baby's crying,
[20:47] right? Your reason for being is is right
[20:50] there in the very beginning, right? God
[20:53] God made man to have a wife and he made
[20:56] the man and the wife together to be
[20:59] fruitful and multiply and have kids and
[21:00] to make a family. That's what they're
[21:03] we're here for. And we can get into
[21:05] this. I'm out of time. Like I said, it
[21:06] you know, all the my burger's falling
[21:09] apart here. Um we'll have to, you know,
[21:12] take it in in a second sitting some
[21:13] other time. Eat it with a fork. Um but
[21:16] look, the fact of the matter is there's
[21:18] not a coincidence. the fact that the
[21:20] family that the that the in the modern
[21:22] day that the the society that we live in
[21:24] the the Satan's Eden, the god of this
[21:26] evil age has taken a wrecking ball to
[21:29] the family and the structure of family
[21:31] that God laid out specifically. A lot of
[21:33] people want to have a family, but it's
[21:35] not according to God's word. And so
[21:37] God's the one who decides what a family
[21:39] is, right? Just because you think you
[21:42] have a family, if it's not according to
[21:43] God's word, no, you don't. It's you're
[21:45] going to end up with problems. It's
[21:47] gonna it's not if you're wondering why
[21:49] your family isn't fulfilling, have you
[21:51] wondered what if it's in accordance with
[21:53] God's word, right? If if if you feel
[21:57] alone in your marriage, are you sure
[21:59] it's according to God's word?
[22:02] You know, if parents feel, you know,
[22:04] like their children, there's a wedge
[22:06] between them and their and their
[22:07] children,
[22:09] do we wonder if that's maybe the
[22:10] family's not according to the word.
[22:12] Maybe that's what's going on, right?
[22:15] Um I I'll end with this I'll end with
[22:18] this uh just read this excerpt this
[22:21] quote and I'll and I'll quit. Um this is
[22:24] the paragraph that I said you know
[22:26] brother man was describing a family from
[22:28] oneness. Now the ma first man and first
[22:32] woman in the garden of Eden was in
[22:33] perfect harmony with God so much that
[22:36] God could come down at any time he
[22:38] desired and talk lip to ear with Adam
[22:40] and Eve. Now that is perfect oneness.
[22:43] God and his creation. God speaking lipto
[22:46] ear with Adam and Eve. And they were so
[22:48] perfect in harmony with God till they
[22:50] were one with God. God and his family
[22:54] was one. Any man and his family. A
[22:59] correct, good, noble, obedient family is
[23:03] one with another. Any family. And if
[23:08] there's something in the family that
[23:10] moves them apart, then it's not right.
[23:14] The family's broken somewhere. They
[23:16] should all be one. Father with mother,
[23:19] mother with father, children with
[23:21] parent, parent with children, all in
[23:23] agreement. And when you see that, you'll
[23:26] see one lovely picture. That's God's
[23:30] purpose. Okay, I'll I'll stop. God bless
[23:34] you guys.
