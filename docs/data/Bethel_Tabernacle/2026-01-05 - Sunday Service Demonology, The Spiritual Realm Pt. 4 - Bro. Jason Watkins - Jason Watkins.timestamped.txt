[34:28] 6. Happy to have you all in the house of
[34:30] God today on this chilly, rainy day.
[34:33] Amen. I think next week we're supposed
[34:34] to be back to 70, so go figure. Amen. I
[34:39] tell people all the time when they ask
[34:40] me, "Do y'all have any winter?" I say,
[34:42] "Well, we do, but it's usually gone by
[34:44] noon." So,
[34:48] but u maybe [clears throat] we we might
[34:50] get a little bit this year. I don't
[34:52] know. That doesn't seem so. Amen. God
[34:54] bless you. Amen. Sure enjoyed all the
[34:56] singing and wonderful uh ministering
[34:59] this morning in the Sunday school. I was
[35:01] uh never cease to be amazed how
[35:02] conducive it is to what I have on my
[35:04] heart as well. Just just shows the that
[35:07] it's all drawing from a single source.
[35:09] Amen. Praise the Lord. Um
[35:13] we want to look here at 1 Timothy
[35:16] chapter 6 and we're going to read verses
[35:18] 3 through 12. This will be my fourth
[35:21] installment
[35:23] um in my series on demonology, the
[35:25] spiritual realm. [cough]
[35:28] Amen. [clears throat]
[35:30] 1 Timothy chapter 6 verse three. You got
[35:33] it? Say amen.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; If any man teach otherwise, and consent
[35:39] not to wholesome words, even the words
[35:42] of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the
[35:44] doctrine which is according to
[35:46] godliness,
[35:47] he is proud, knowing nothing, but doing
[35:50] about questions and strives of words,
[35:53] whereof cometh envy, strife, railings,
[35:57] evil surmisings. So [clears throat] you
[35:59] can see that for you know for people to
[36:04] try to find an end around on the word of
[36:07] God is not a Leodysian problem. It's all
[36:10] the way back from the beginning. Uh the
[36:13] very earliest days in the church Paul
[36:15] was having to write and dis and talk
[36:18] about people who when it came to
[36:20] godliness were always trying to figure
[36:23] out a way around that. And Paul is just
[36:25] simply, you know, putting it on the
[36:27] brass tax as they say. Uh he's proud
[36:30] knowing nothing but doing about
[36:32] questions and strives of words. See,
[36:34] everybody's got an opinion, right?
[36:36] Whereof cometh envy, strife, railings,
[36:39] and evil surmising. So if you want to
[36:42] destroy the unity of any church, just
[36:46] let there beginning begin to be strife
[36:49] over godliness and the ministry trying
[36:52] to stand for it and the people trying to
[36:54] resist it and find ways around it and
[36:56] skirt the lines and walk near the edge
[36:59] and these kind. You say, "Well, okay, so
[37:01] we destroy a little bit of unity."
[37:02] That's the power.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; That's how the power works. You destroy
[37:06] the unity, you effectively are Satan's
[37:08] agent to hinder the power of God.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; See [clears throat]
[37:12] verse five. Perverse disputings of men
[37:15] of corrupt minds and destitute of the
[37:19] truth, supposing that gain is godliness,
[37:22] from such withdraw thyself.
[37:26] But godliness with contentment
[37:29] [clears throat] is great gain. For we
[37:31] wrought nothing into brought nothing
[37:33] into this world, and it is certain we
[37:36] can carry nothing out. And having food
[37:38] and raignment, let us there be therewith
[37:41] content. But they [clears throat] that
[37:44] will be rich fall into temp into
[37:47] temptation and a snare, and into many
[37:51] foolish and hurtful lust, which drown
[37:54] men in destruction and predition.
[37:57] [clears throat] Now, let me make it
[37:59] clear. Paul is not saying that a rich
[38:02] man is a sinner. He's not even He's not
[38:05] even really talking about possessing or
[38:07] not possessing great wealth. He's
[38:09] talking about the pursuit of it
[38:11] &gt;&gt; by the world's standards.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; You understand? So God blesses who he
[38:15] blesses. But however God blesses you, be
[38:17] there with content and don't chase it.
[38:20] Amen.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; See, because Paul is saying when when
[38:23] you do that, when you start chasing it
[38:25] for the sake of being rich, he goes in
[38:28] the next in the very next verse, uh, for
[38:31] for the love of money is the root of all
[38:33] evil, which while some coveted, they
[38:37] have aired from the faith and pierced
[38:40] themselves through with many sorrows. So
[38:43] this now [clears throat]
[38:45] this this goes across the pursuit of
[38:49] money, the pursuit of fame, any type of
[38:53] fortune and glory, any type of
[38:54] advantageous position that you want to
[38:57] try to achieve to in in the world using
[38:59] the world's ways to get there. Paul is
[39:02] simply talking about your desire.
[39:04] There's a problem in your desire. Not
[39:06] that whether you have more zeros in the
[39:09] bank than the next guy, but what is in
[39:12] your heart and what are you chasing and
[39:14] what are you doing to achieve it?
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is not a lessian problem.
[39:20] This is a Christianity problem that the
[39:22] apostles were dealing with back in the
[39:24] day. [clears throat] And he just simply
[39:26] says the people who do that, he didn't
[39:28] even say they're they're not, you know,
[39:30] they lose their salvation. He's just
[39:32] simply saying they pierce themselves
[39:33] through with many sorrows. See, and and
[39:37] there's [clears throat] no sorrow worse
[39:38] than seeing that kind of a habit fall
[39:41] into your children.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; After you've long fixed it and you're
[39:46] not like that anymore, then seeing your
[39:48] children struggle with that and you
[39:49] realize, h see, that's a that you're
[39:53] talking about a dagger to the heart. All
[39:55] right. [clears throat]
[39:57] But thou, oh man of God, flee these
[40:00] things. That's an active word. And
[40:03] follow after. Catch it now. Flee from
[40:05] one and follow after another. Flee these
[40:08] things and follow after righteousness,
[40:11] godliness, faith, love, patience,
[40:16] meekness,
[40:18] and fight the good fight of faith. Lay
[40:22] hold on eternal life, where to thou art
[40:26] also called, and hast professed a good
[40:30] profession before many witnesses. Let's
[40:34] pray.
[40:35] Father, we thank you for your word
[40:38] today. Thank you for this group of
[40:40] people gathered here. I ask now, Lord,
[40:42] that you give me the right mental frame
[40:45] of mind to to take this Lord in an
[40:48] expository way and uh that's uh that
[40:51] requires mental discipline. So, I'm
[40:53] asking for your mercy today as we try to
[40:56] bring Lord these truths that concerned
[41:00] the heart of your great apostle. And
[41:02] Lord, it wasn't just Paul. We're going
[41:04] to read the quotes and statements of
[41:06] others of thy great apostles and
[41:08] prophets and sages. So Lord, help us
[41:11] today. I pray in Jesus name. Amen. God
[41:14] bless you. You can be seated.
[41:17] So I don't know whether you know you
[41:20] expected a subject called demonology to
[41:24] deal with practical everyday living. Uh
[41:27] you know but um I'm not here to train
[41:30] you in the occult.
[41:32] That's not demonology. That's not the
[41:34] way Brother Brandham preached demonology
[41:36] and he used it just to expose the devil.
[41:39] But then he that became a platform for
[41:41] building up your awareness that the
[41:45] enemy is lurking at all times.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; He's always after you.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; He He desires 247 to destroy you.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; And so now we're we're supposed to know
[41:58] our enemy. So Brother Ram said, "Know
[42:00] him." See, so this is what we're doing
[42:02] today in this expository lesson. And in
[42:04] fact is in the better part of this
[42:06] series. We're showing you the practical
[42:09] steps. I don't want to put us into the
[42:11] aal. I want us to take the practical
[42:14] steps. How do I defeat Satan and stay
[42:18] victorious in my life as a Christian?
[42:22] &gt;&gt; That should be the number one goal.
[42:24] That's why, you know, I I probably
[42:26] shocked you a little bit on uh I didn't
[42:28] say it for shock value. Uh I said it
[42:31] because I felt inspired to ask it when I
[42:33] was studying and I think it was
[42:35] Wednesday night at the communion
[42:36] service. I said you need to decide and
[42:39] and I don't need you to wait raise your
[42:41] hand or you know or or you know get in a
[42:44] certain line or identify yourself. I
[42:46] just need you to answer it to yourself.
[42:48] Are you a real Christian or merely a
[42:50] message believer?
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:53] because those are not necessarily, you
[42:56] understand, they're they're not now
[42:59] they're they're they're not mutually
[43:01] exclusive. Both can be true at the same
[43:03] time. I am a message believer because
[43:06] I'm a real Christian.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; And the fact that I'm a real Christian
[43:10] causes me to believe the message. But
[43:12] there are there are many who sit in
[43:16] message churches, and I maybe shouldn't
[43:17] use the word many. Let me use a more
[43:19] faith than that. There are some and they
[43:22] know I'm sure at least I hope they know
[43:24] if you don't know who you are. Hopefully
[43:25] the word can identify you today to
[43:27] yourself to help you.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Not to insult you, but to help you. I
[43:32] need help.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Y'all need help.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; See, that's what the word is here for.
[43:36] We need help.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; And so I I want the word to show me that
[43:40] I'm that I'm NOT JUST I NOT JUST THAT I
[43:43] believe that God sent a prophet because
[43:45] the devil believes that. Not that I
[43:47] disbelieve in God because the devil
[43:49] believes that. Not that I just believe
[43:51] the doctrines because I can prove them
[43:53] in the Bible. But not merely because I
[43:55] can prove them in the BIBLE BUT BECAUSE
[43:58] THEY are a living element that lives
[44:00] inside me and walk THROUGH ME AND I KNOW
[44:03] WHOM I HAVE BELIEVED.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; I know BY EXPERIENCE. THIS IS WHAT JOHN
[44:08] SAID THAT you can know. YOU CAN ACTUALLY
[44:10] know that you can actually know not by
[44:13] mere persuasion. You can know by a
[44:17] living life experience that's a
[44:19] revelation of faith that it is the truth
[44:22] and that Christ is the power uh in the
[44:25] world. And so so this is what we're
[44:27] looking at uh when we look at this whole
[44:30] thing of practical lifestyles. Paul is
[44:34] saying to us, fight the good fight. SO
[44:38] ALL OF THESE ALL OF THESE ACTIVE WORDS,
[44:40] THEY'RE NOT PASSIVE. Flee these things.
[44:42] follow after righteousness, godliness,
[44:44] faith, love, patience, uh uh meekness.
[44:48] Well, Brother Jason, those are those are
[44:50] fine. You know, you know, maybe you feel
[44:53] like you want to just pat me on the head
[44:54] and say, "Those are mighty sweet,
[44:56] pastor, but that's not going to make me
[44:57] number one in the world." Well, they
[44:59] make you number one with God.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Well, that's not going to make me rich,
[45:02] but it'll give you heaven.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you choose. As Moses said,
[45:08] choose. Like Elijah said, if God be God,
[45:11] serve him. If Baal be God, SERVE HIM.
[45:13] WHY? BECAUSE THAT'S SENSIBLE. If Baal's
[45:15] Bale, we need to go serve him. See, I
[45:17] want to serve the one who's REAL AND IN
[45:19] POWER. I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE IT'S THE
[45:21] AUTHOR OF this book.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; So, for me, there's no um
[45:27] wishy-washiness in my mind. I'm I'm
[45:31] never I don't ever want to be found. AND
[45:33] AS SOON AS I CATCH myself trying to
[45:36] skirt around the edge of some principle
[45:38] in the word of God, I say, "Lord,
[45:40] forgive me. HELP ME TO HAVE THE mind
[45:43] which was in CHRIST JESUS WHO DID ALWAYS
[45:46] THAT which pleased the father."
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:51] [clears throat]
[45:51] &gt;&gt; You would think that being sons and
[45:53] daughters of God by a gene that that
[45:56] would come automatically. It does not.
[45:59] It did not come automatically in you.
[46:01] Though you were born with a gene of God,
[46:02] it did not come automatically in you
[46:04] until you were born again.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; And then even when you're born again by
[46:08] the Holy Ghost, hear me because this is
[46:09] a big point. This is a big point. This
[46:11] is important,
[46:12] you know, and I and I don't want to get
[46:14] ahead of myself in my notes, but but the
[46:17] the Holy Ghost baptism, the new birth, a
[46:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost in the new
[46:22] birth is the beginning of your service
[46:25] to God. It's not I mean IF IT WAS THE
[46:28] FINAL THING then you'd have already been
[46:30] taken in a rapture but we are we are
[46:34] daily shedding uh the world and putting
[46:37] on Christ. We daily we daily Paul is
[46:41] speaking to believers OH MAN OF GOD. WHY
[46:45] DOES HE HAVE TO SAY TO A MAN OF GOD FLEE
[46:48] YOUTHFUL flee these things? WHY WOULD HE
[46:51] HAVE TO SAY TO A MAN OF GOD [laughter]
[46:53] FOLLOW after righteousness?
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:57] Because we're humans
[46:59] &gt;&gt; and we live in unborn bodies.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; With unborn spirits.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; The new birth changes the nature of the
[47:08] inner man. The nature of the spirit,
[47:11] which is the soul. See, it's the nature
[47:13] of the spirit. All right. Now,
[47:16] [clears throat]
[47:18] let me back up and and and I'll say, as
[47:20] they say, I'll back up and go forward.
[47:24] What we have found today and the day and
[47:26] hour that we live in is that just as
[47:30] Jesus now just just pay close attention.
[47:32] I'm not going to go uh long today, but
[47:35] I'm going to be very concise. I'm this
[47:38] is expository preaching what I'm do.
[47:40] That's the style they call it. It's
[47:41] expository. All right. [clears throat]
[47:43] So as Jesus was the combination
[47:48] of all the Old Testament saints,
[47:51] &gt;&gt; all the Old Testament anointings,
[47:54] &gt;&gt; he housed all of that in his single
[47:57] self. You understand? All the prophets
[47:59] and the anointing that was upon them.
[48:02] All the prophets, the priests, all the
[48:04] anointing that was on them. All the
[48:06] kings and the anointing that was on
[48:08] them. uh he was the prophets, priests,
[48:11] kings, and all the anointing on all of
[48:14] those offices in one. He was the
[48:17] fullness of the Godhead bodily. But as
[48:21] I've said to you before, there was never
[48:24] an intention by God to stay bottled up
[48:27] in a single man walking the shores of
[48:30] Galilee. THAT'S NOT WHAT HE HAD IN MIND
[48:32] WHEN HE SAID, "LET US MAKE MAN." When he
[48:34] said, "Let us make man," he's
[48:35] envisioning a kingdom of saints. Amen.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; WHERE SOMEDAY THE KINGDOMS OF THIS WORLD
[48:41] WILL become the kingdoms of our LORD AND
[48:44] HIS CHRIST, HIS ANOINTED FAMILY.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; SEE, that's his that's that's the plan.
[48:50] So Jesus was simply a keystone between
[48:55] uh the Old Testament and the New
[48:56] Testament even with the work of Calvary.
[48:59] AND THIS TOOK A PROPHET TO uncover in
[49:01] the opening of the seals. And this is
[49:03] this will stand every CHRISTIAN
[49:05] APOLOGIST ON HIS EAR. uh it it required
[49:09] the opening OF THE SEVEN SEALED BOOK OR
[49:13] ULTIMATELY CALVARY WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR
[49:15] not
[49:16] &gt;&gt; right.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; UNDERSTAND? BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE STILL
[49:19] COLLAPSED. HE COULD HAVE NEVER
[49:21] ESTABLISHED THE KINGDOM BECAUSE CALVARY
[49:23] WAS HIS purchasing work equally to
[49:27] OPENING THE SEVEN SEALS WAS HIS WORK of
[49:30] redemption that he's claiming the names
[49:33] in the book. SO HE'S PAYING THE PURCHASE
[49:36] PRICE AT CALVARY, BUT WHEN HE STEPS
[49:38] FORWARD FROM THE ETERNITIES TO CLAIM THE
[49:40] BOOK AND LOOSE THE SEALS, THAT'S HIS
[49:43] CLAIMING WORK. HIS CLAIMING work is JUST
[49:45] AS IMPORTANT AS HIS purchasing work.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; THERE COULD BE NO CLAIM IF THERE HADN'T
[49:50] BEEN A PURCHASE. AND IF THERE WAS ONLY A
[49:51] PURCHASE AND NEVER A CLAIM, THEN IT'S
[49:53] ALL FOR NOT. AND THAT'S WHY JOHN WAS
[49:55] WEEPING.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. JOHN WHO HAD A FRONT ROW SEAT OF
[50:00] AT GOLTHA WAS SO CLOSE HAD A
[50:03] CONVERSATION WITH JESUS ON THE CROSS AND
[50:05] THAT MAN WHO SAW CALVARY BETTER THAN ANY
[50:08] OTHER person started crying when no one
[50:11] was worthy to open the book.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Does that inform your thinking? See? SO,
[50:19] [clears throat] SO JUST AS JESUS was the
[50:21] culmination of all the Old Testament and
[50:23] he was the keystone leading to the New
[50:25] Testament era, the bride of the last day
[50:29] is the culmination of all the powers of
[50:32] the living creatures. And that's an
[50:34] important POINT BECAUSE THEY HAD YOU say
[50:38] are there differences BETWEEN PAUL'S DAY
[50:40] AND OUR DAY? PROBABLY IN MY mind the
[50:44] chief difference is that they were under
[50:48] an anointing of the lion, not an eagle.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; They were under the anointing of the
[50:54] lion. You understand? And now under the
[50:57] anointing of the eagle, we have ALL FOUR
[51:00] ANOINTINGS OF THE MAN AND THE OF the e
[51:03] the lion, the ox and the man and the
[51:05] flying eagle. SO WE ARE THE CULMINATION.
[51:08] UH SO NOW NOW NOW WE CAN COME FULLY BACK
[51:12] TO WHAT JESUS WAS AS THE WORD MADE FLESH
[51:15] IN THE EARTH BECAUSE JESUS CARRIED THE
[51:18] CULMINATION OF ALL THE ANOINTINGS THOSE
[51:21] LIVING creatures proceeded from his
[51:24] throne.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; See
[51:28] [snorts]
[51:29] so all SO THEN ALL THE POWER OF THE
[51:33] living creatures is here today.
[51:36] This is why we have a restoration of
[51:39] truth about God
[51:42] &gt;&gt; and HIS WORD AND HIS FAMILY.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; UNDERSTAND? IT IS A FULLY RESTORED TRUTH
[51:51] TO US IN JUSTIFICATION.
[51:54] WE'LL SKIP TO THE RESTORATION OF THE
[51:56] BRIDE TREE. LUTHER HAD A REVELATION that
[51:59] that we build upon UNDER AN EAGLE
[52:00] ANOINTING. LUTHER'S REVELATION UNDER
[52:03] UNDER STRICTLY the man age under manage
[52:05] anointing WAS THAT THE JUST SHALL LIVE
[52:07] BY HIS FAITH
[52:09] LAUNCHING FROM AN OLD TESTAMENT
[52:12] TEACHING.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; LUTHER DIDN'T INVENT THAT. THAT WAS IN
[52:15] THE BIBLE. SO LUTHER BRINGS THAT
[52:18] FORWARD. PEOPLE WHO SAY, "OH, THE OLD
[52:20] TESTAMENT DOESN'T COUNT." YOUR VERY
[52:22] JUSTIFICATION IN CHRIST COMES OUT OF THE
[52:24] OLD TESTAMENT.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; WHERE DO YOU THINK LUTHER GOT IT? AND SO
[52:28] SO WE WE REALIZE THEN THAT IT'S JUST
[52:30] LIKE PAUL WOULD TAKE THINGS OUT OF THE
[52:32] OLD TESTAMENT AND BRING THEM INTO THE
[52:34] NEW TESTAMENT ERA. SEE, SO SOMETIMES
[52:36] PEOPLE JUST THERE YOU THEY THEY TRY TO
[52:38] WORK AN END AROUND people try like crazy
[52:42] to work an end around, you know, around
[52:44] the the full truth. People have sit in
[52:46] churches and left it finally because
[52:48] they couldn't figure out the end around.
[52:50] Nobody would let them get away with it
[52:51] and preachers kept telling them they
[52:52] were wrong. They finally abandoned it
[52:55] and and then they then they then they
[52:56] want TO BACK UP AND SAY, "WELL, YOU
[52:58] KNOW, MALACHI 4 WAS TO ISRAEL." NO
[53:01] KIDDING. IT CERTAINLY WASN'T TO THE
[53:03] EGYPTIANS or the Philistines.
[53:06] The whole ALL THE ENTIRE OLD TESTAMENT,
[53:08] BUT IT WAS TO ISRAEL. BUT DOES THAT MEAN
[53:10] I CANNOT GO BACK AND READ ISAIAH? BY HIS
[53:13] STRIPES, I'M HEALED.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; DOES THAT mean that HE WAS WOUNDED FOR
[53:17] MY TRANSGRESSION AND THE CHASTISEMENT OF
[53:19] MY PEACE WAS UPON HIM? I DON'T GET I
[53:21] CAN'T TAP INTO THAT CUZ THAT WAS TO
[53:23] ISRAEL. SEE, SO SO SOMETIMES PEOPLE THEY
[53:27] BLIND THEMSELVES and they become
[53:29] nonsensical when they when they and and
[53:31] it's what Paul said. They know nothing.
[53:34] It's what Paul said. We read it in our
[53:35] text. They know nothing.
[53:37] See, so when we come to the the
[53:42] restoration under the eagle age, then we
[53:45] have a FULLY RESTORED TRUTH, NOT
[53:48] Luther's limited version THAT I AM
[53:51] FORGIVEN OF MY SINS AND I have right
[53:54] standing in God. That's the revelation
[53:56] Luther had. I'm forgiven of my sins and
[53:59] I have right standing in the presence of
[54:01] God. BUT THE PER BUT THE FULLY RESTORED
[54:05] TRUTH BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL OF THE
[54:07] anointings and we have the opening of
[54:09] the book. THEN NOW WE HAVE A PERFECT
[54:12] FAITH TO HEAR RECOGNIZE AND ACT UPON ACT
[54:18] UPON THE REVELATION THAT THE JUST SHALL
[54:20] LIVE BY FAITH ACTING UPON THE FACT THAT
[54:24] WHEN I HAVE PASSED FROM DEATH TO LIFE
[54:27] IT'S AS THOUGH I NEVER SINNED IN THE
[54:29] FIRST PLACE. AMEN.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; SO THEREFORE, I CONDUCT MYSELF AS IF I
[54:34] NEVER SINNED IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO IT
[54:37] DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SATAN WANTS TO
[54:38] BATTLE MY MIND WITH. I CAN SIMPLY SAY TO
[54:41] HIM, "YEAH, BUT I NEVER DID THAT IN THE
[54:43] FIRST PLACE."
[54:44] &gt;&gt; SO HE CAN'T UPEND ME WITH DISCOURAGEMENT
[54:48] OVER MY PAST FAILURES. SEE, SO I'M I'M
[54:51] I'M ACTING upon that FACT BECAUSE THAT'S
[54:55] WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS. THE JUST SHALL LIVE
[54:58] BY.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU UNDERSTAND? THAT'S NOT A
[55:01] PRINCIPLE THAT WE MEMORIZE. THIS IS AN
[55:03] ACTION WORD APPLYING TO YOUR LIFE. LIVE
[55:06] YOUR LIFE. THE JUST SHALL LIVE. ARE YOU
[55:08] JUSTIFIED?
[55:10] &gt;&gt; THEN LIVE AS THOUGH IN THE FREEDOM THAT
[55:12] YOU NEVER FAILED GOD IN THE FIRST PLACE.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; SATAN CAN'T KNOCK ME OUT OF THE RACE
[55:18] BECAUSE I'VE GOT THE FACTS. IN THE FIRST
[55:20] PLACE, I WAS IN CHRIST. YES. AMEN.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE THAT'S TRUE, THEN I KNOW
[55:26] THAT'S HOW HE LOOKS AT ME NOW. GLORY BE
[55:30] TO GOD. THAT'S HOW HE LOOKS AT ME. NOW,
[55:33] THAT AIN'T ALWAYS HOW THE DEVIL LOOKS AT
[55:35] ME. IT AIN'T HOW YOU ALWAYS LOOK AT ME.
[55:36] IT AIN'T HOW I ALWAYS LOOK AT ME IN THE
[55:38] MIRROR, BUT IT'S HOW HE [screaming]
[55:39] LOOKS AT ME.
[55:50] I'M CARRYING A A HANDKERCHIEF IN MY OVER
[55:52] MY HEART THIS MORNING FOR SISTER KATHY
[55:54] WHO ASKED SPECIFICALLY HAVE BROTHER
[55:56] JASON PUT A HANDKERCHIEF IN AND PREACH
[55:57] AND I WANT THAT BROUGHT BACK TO ME AND
[55:59] WE'RE GOING TO BELIEVE THAT THE POWER OF
[56:01] FAITH WILL SAVE THE SICK. I SAID,
[56:03] "BROTHER JACK, JUST FOR HER HONORING THE
[56:05] MINISTRY, LET'S BELIEVE AND LET'S CLAIM
[56:07] IT THAT GOD IS GOING TO HEAL OUR SISTER.
[56:09] I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER SUFFER LIKE
[56:10] THAT."
[56:13] &gt;&gt; SEE, SO THERE'S POWER IN PRAYER. THERE'S
[56:15] POWER IN THE FAMILY OF GOD. IT'S NOT AN
[56:17] IMAGINED POWER.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; IT'S VERY REAL. SATAN IS JUST AFRAID
[56:23] YOU'LL BELIEVE IT.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; SEE, SO SO I'M I I you know, we we were
[56:30] WE WERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. UH WE KNOW
[56:33] THAT WE WERE IN THE MIND OF CHRIST. YOU
[56:35] SAY, and it's fair. YOU SAY, "BUT I WAS
[56:40] BORN IN SIN,
[56:42] &gt;&gt; not in the first place." Amen.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; YOU WERE NOT BORN IN SIN
[56:47] &gt;&gt; IN THE FIRST PLACE.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[56:50] &gt;&gt; SO WE HAVE A FULLY RESTORED TRUTH. WE'RE
[56:53] NOT LIMITED TO JOHN WESLEY'S
[56:56] UNDERSTANDING of sanctification,
[56:58] scripturally based, that without
[57:00] holiness, NO MAN SHALL SEE GOD. AND AND
[57:04] and and NOW NOW THINK WITH ME. OKAY,
[57:08] you're you're with me?
[57:09] &gt;&gt; All right, think with me. IF IF IF
[57:12] WITHOUT HOLINESS,
[57:14] no man CAN SEE GOD, IF THAT'S TRUE, THEN
[57:18] GOD CANNOT REQUIRE FROM YOUR LIFE
[57:22] SOMETHING THAT HE CANNOT AFFECT UPON
[57:24] YOUR LIFE AS YOU GIVE HIM AUTHORITY IN
[57:26] YOUR LIFE.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; That's a mouthful. I'm going to say it
[57:31] again.
[57:32] If if if IT'S TRUE THAT WITHOUT HOLINESS
[57:35] NO MAN CAN SEE GOD, THEN GOD CANNOT
[57:37] REQUIRE FROM YOUR LIFE SOMETHING THAT HE
[57:41] CAN'T AFFECT UPON YOUR LIFE IF AND AS
[57:44] YOU GIVE HIM AUTHORITY IN YOUR LIFE. I
[57:47] CANNOT BE HOLY ENOUGH FOR HIM, BUT I CAN
[57:50] RESPOND TO HIS WORD.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; I CAN HUMBLE MYSELF AND SAY, "LORD, I
[57:54] BELIEVE. HELP THOU MY UNBELIEF."
[57:57] AND I CAN STRIVE DAILY TO PUT ON THE
[58:00] WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; SO SANCTIFICATION WHERE YOU KNOW WHEN
[58:06] BROTHER BRANDHAM AMPLIFIED LUTHER HE
[58:08] AMPLIFIED WESLEY BECAUSE WESLEY THOUGHT
[58:10] THAT THAT SANCTIFICATION WAS THE FINAL
[58:12] VICTORY BUT ELIJAH WAS GIVEN TO
[58:14] UNDERSTAND THAT SANCTIFICATION WAS A
[58:17] FURTHER WORK OF THE HOLY GHOST IN THE
[58:20] NEW BIRTH AND PART OF HAVING THE TOKEN
[58:23] ON DISPLAY.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO IT IT IS SPIRIT BORN
[58:28] SANCTIFICATION THAT IT PROPERLY IS
[58:30] spirit born and IT IS OPERATED BY THE
[58:33] HOLY GHOST OR ELSE IT'S JUST WORKS THAT
[58:36] ANYONE LIVING IN A COMMUNE CAN FOLLOW.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:41] And that's no THAT I MEAN A BUDDHIST
[58:43] LIVING IN IN A TEMPLE CAN FOLLOW CAN CAN
[58:46] CAN FOLLOW A LIST OF OF OF HOLINESS
[58:49] THINGS AND STAY AWAY AND AND LIVE
[58:51] CELIBATE AND AND NOT PARTAKE OF ANY KIND
[58:53] OF HORRIBLE THING. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
[58:56] THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF
[58:58] SANCTIFICATION UH THAT THAT'LL GET YOU
[59:00] AND THAT'S THAT GIVES YOU ACCEPTANCE
[59:02] BEFORE GOD. IT'S A IT'S A IT'S ALLOWING
[59:05] THE HOLY GHOST TO COME INTO YOUR LIFE
[59:07] AND AND TAKE YOU FROM DEATH UNTO LIFE IN
[59:11] A BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST AND YOU ARE
[59:13] A NEW CREATION IN CHRIST JESUS AND DAILY
[59:16] SANCTIFICATION. SANCTIFICATION IS NOT
[59:18] THE ENDGAME. SANCTIFICATION IS A DAILY
[59:21] EXERCISE OF HAVING THE TOKEN ON DISPLAY
[59:27] &gt;&gt; IN YOUR LIFE. SEE, HE AMPLIFIED THE
[59:30] ISUZA FATHERS BECAUSE THEY TAPPED INTO A
[59:33] RESTORED POWER. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID IT
[59:34] WAS A A POWER THAT CHURCH HAD KIND OF
[59:37] BEEN LACKING AND IT RESTORED SOME POWER
[59:38] THAT THE CHURCH HAD BEEN MISSING. And it
[59:41] RAMPED UP IN A LARGE WAY THE OPERATION
[59:43] OF THE GIFTS OF THE SPIRIT UH THAT
[59:46] PENTECOSTAL FATHERS THOUGHT WAS THE
[59:48] TOTAL VICTORY.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Just like Luther thought justification
[59:51] WAS THE TOTAL VICTORY. WESLEY THOUGHT
[59:53] SANCTIFICATION WAS TOTAL VICTORY. It t
[59:55] IT TOOK A PROPHET TO COME AND GO, "NO,
[59:56] IT'S PART OF IT. NO, IT'S PART OF IT.
[59:58] NO, IT'S PART OF IT. THE GIFTS ARE PART
[1:00:00] OF IT. POWER IS PART OF IT. BUT THE
[1:00:01] DEVIL CAN IMPERSONATE THAT STUFF. SEE,
[1:00:04] SO SO A PROPHET KNEW THAT SATAN COULD
[1:00:06] IMPERSONATE IT. AND UNDER THE OPENING OF
[1:00:08] THE SEVEN SEALS, HE LAYS DOWN A PERFECT
[1:00:12] PATH IN THE WORD TO GO BEYOND THE GIFTS
[1:00:15] TO THE GIVER
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; of the gifts.
[1:00:22] So, IT'S AN EAGLE ANOINTING WITH A
[1:00:24] PERFECT WORD THAT IS RESTORED AND A
[1:00:28] PROPHECY OF VICTORY OVER THE BRIDE.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THAT PROPHECY
[1:00:35] UH OR THE PROPHECY IS A CONSEQUENCE OF
[1:00:38] OF THE MIND OF GOD AND GOD'S PLAN IN
[1:00:40] REDEMPTION. IT IS GOD'S PLAN OF
[1:00:44] redemption that THE BRIDE ULTIMATELY IS
[1:00:48] IMPERVIOUS TO DECEPTION.
[1:00:52] THAT GOD SET THAT UP.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; THAT DIDN'T BECOME TRUE BECAUSE WILLIAM
[1:00:55] BRANDHAM SAID IT.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; HE ONLY SAID WHAT WAS OBVIOUS in the
[1:00:58] word.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; UNDERSTAND THIS BRIDE HAS GOT TO PROVE
[1:01:02] THE SECOND EVE IS GOING TO PROVE SHE'S
[1:01:05] NOT LIKE THE FIRST EVE IN GENESIS. SHE'S
[1:01:08] NOT LIKE ISRAEL WANTING A KING. SHE'S
[1:01:10] NOT LIKE THE EARLY CHURCH THAT FELL AT
[1:01:12] NIKA. THIS BRIDE IS PREDESTINATED TO NOT
[1:01:16] [screaming] FALL. HALLELUJAH. SHE IS IN
[1:01:19] SHE CAN SHE CAN HAVE A MISUNDERSTANDING
[1:01:21] OF THE WORD. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE
[1:01:24] DEVIL CONVINCING HER TO NOT BELIEVE
[1:01:26] EVERY WORD OF GOD, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
[1:01:28] SHE'S IMPERVIOUS TO THAT. I CANNOT HELP
[1:01:30] BUT BE A BELIEVER. I CANNOT HELP BUT
[1:01:33] BELIEVE IT. I HEAR IT. I FEED UPON IT.
[1:01:35] AND THE MORE I GET, THE MORE I WANT.
[1:01:37] HALLELUJAH. THE MORE IT CAUSES ME TO
[1:01:39] BECOME, THE MORE I WANT TO BE.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; SATAN HAS NO CHANCE TO DECEIVE ME. THE
[1:01:46] BRIDE OF [screaming] THE LAST DAY WITH
[1:01:47] ALL FOUR ANOINTINGS HAS A FAITH THAT IS
[1:01:50] IMPENETRABLE. HER DETERMINATION IS
[1:01:53] UNSTOPPABLE. AND FOR SURE HER IDENTITY
[1:01:57] IS UNDENIABLE.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; She is already hear me.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; She is already the final voice
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; to the final age. Amen.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Last Sunday we played a video and I want
[1:02:12] to play it again today. And I just want
[1:02:14] to say to the listeners streaming, I had
[1:02:17] a couple of uh inquiries uh in North
[1:02:20] America and some overseas to say they
[1:02:22] couldn't see it when it was being
[1:02:24] played. Brothers, sisters, we're not
[1:02:26] sure why that happened on your end, but
[1:02:28] we had many other people saying they saw
[1:02:30] it just fine. It's on the archive. We're
[1:02:32] hoping it'll come through for you today.
[1:02:34] If it doesn't, you can go on YouTube and
[1:02:35] get the archive and I'm sure that it
[1:02:37] will show. Many people saying, "Hey, I
[1:02:39] couldn't see what was going on. I'd like
[1:02:40] to see that." So now, when we showed
[1:02:43] this thing uh about harmony that can be
[1:02:45] achieved in metronomes and we said to
[1:02:48] you this pure science because what and
[1:02:50] and I wanted to just show it again
[1:02:52] because I got one follower right on the
[1:02:53] heels of it. Now, what I'm demonstrating
[1:02:56] to you is the is the scripture and just
[1:02:59] while they get that ready, just listen
[1:03:02] to this reading. So [clears throat] he
[1:03:05] that descended is the same also. This is
[1:03:08] Ephesians 4. He that descended is the
[1:03:11] same also that ascended up far above all
[1:03:14] heavens that he might fill all things.
[1:03:17] And he gave some APOSTLES AND SOME
[1:03:19] PROPHETS and some evangelists and some
[1:03:21] pastors and some teachers for the
[1:03:23] perfecting of the saints for the work of
[1:03:26] the ministry for THE EDIFYING OF THE
[1:03:28] BODY of Christ. Those are all positive,
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; right? You see, he's building,
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Building is positive. He's going forward
[1:03:37] TILL UNTIL WE ALL ALL OF US come into
[1:03:40] the unity of the faith and of the
[1:03:43] knowledge of the son of God unto a
[1:03:46] perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:03:48] stature of the fullness of Christ.
[1:03:51] Here's why. THAT WE HENCEFORTH RIGHT
[1:03:53] NOW.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. RIGHT NOW IN OUR EVERYDAY WALKING
[1:03:57] TALKING LIFE THAT WE HENCEFORTH NO BE NO
[1:04:01] MORE CHILDREN TOSSED TO AND FRO AND
[1:04:04] CARRIED ABOUT WITH every wind of
[1:04:06] DOCTRINE BY THE SLIGHT of men. SEE, HE
[1:04:08] SENT YOU PREACHERS SO YOU CAN'T BE TAKEN
[1:04:11] AWAY BY THE SLIGHT OF CUNNING MEN. HE
[1:04:13] SENT YOU PASTORS, PRO A PRO PROPHETS,
[1:04:15] APOSTLES, PASTORS, TEACHERS,
[1:04:17] EVANGELISTS. THAT'S TO PROTECT YOU FROM
[1:04:19] BEING CARRIED AWAY BY CUNNING MEN. SEE,
[1:04:22] AND SO AND AND TOSSED TO AND FRO AND
[1:04:24] CARRIED CARRIED ABOUT WITH EVERY WIND OF
[1:04:26] DOCTRINE BY THE SLIGHT OF MEN AND
[1:04:27] CUNNING CRAFTINESS, WHEREBY they lie and
[1:04:30] wait to deceive, but speaking the truth
[1:04:33] IN LOVE MAY GROW UP INTO HIM IN ALL
[1:04:36] THINGS WHICH IS THE HEAD, EVEN CHRIST.
[1:04:38] SO, YOU'RE GROWING INTO SOMETHING. NOW,
[1:04:41] THIS 16TH VERSE IS REALLY WHAT THIS
[1:04:43] VIDEO IS ABOUT. FROM WHOM THE WHOLE BODY
[1:04:47] FITLY JOINED TOGETHER AND COMPACTED BY
[1:04:51] that which every joint SUPPLIETH
[1:04:54] ACCORDING TO THE effectual working in
[1:04:56] the measure of every part maketh
[1:04:59] increase of the body unto the edifying
[1:05:02] of itself in love. So, you remember when
[1:05:05] brother Brandham TOLD THE STORY, HE WAS
[1:05:06] ON HIS SADDLE horse and he rode way out
[1:05:08] in the wilderness and the Lord led him
[1:05:10] into a into an area where they had had a
[1:05:12] burnover and THERE WAS A WHOLE WHOLE
[1:05:16] PATCH OF forest that it WAS NOTHING BUT
[1:05:18] BLACK JUST STIFF OLD DEAD BURNT TREES.
[1:05:22] There was there WAS JUST NO LIFE THERE.
[1:05:24] HE SAID LIKE A A FOREST GRAVEYARD. And
[1:05:27] he went in THERE AND HE SAID IT WAS
[1:05:28] SPOOKY. AND HE SAID YOU COULD HEAR THAT
[1:05:31] WIND HOWLING THROUGH THERE. WOO.
[1:05:34] And brother BRANDHAM SAID, "SEE, IT'S
[1:05:36] LIKE A DENOMINATION. WOO! The days of
[1:05:38] miracles are passed." Woo! It don't
[1:05:41] matter how you live, you can still be a
[1:05:43] Christian. WOO! UH, FATHER, SON, AND
[1:05:46] HOLY GHOST IS THREE separate people.
[1:05:48] Woo! You know, there's no signs that
[1:05:51] follow the believers. Just go to church.
[1:05:54] And brother Brandham SAID, YOU KNOW, HE
[1:05:56] SAID IT WAS A ALL THOSE TREES were just
[1:05:58] stiff,
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; burnt,
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; dried. See, AND SO WE SHOWED YOU THAT.
[1:06:04] THAT'S WHY WHEN A CHURCH IS BUILT ON
[1:06:07] THAT KIND OF A RIGID foundation that has
[1:06:10] no living movement to it. Brother
[1:06:12] Brandham said if they'd have just ended
[1:06:14] their creed with a comma, it would have
[1:06:17] stayed open for movement. But they ended
[1:06:18] it with a period. We believe this and
[1:06:20] nothing more. Then they cut themselves
[1:06:22] OFF FROM FURTHER REVELATION DOWN THROUGH
[1:06:25] THE AGES AND GOD SIMPLY PUT THEM ON A
[1:06:27] SHELF AND MOVED ON TO THE NEXT AGE.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT WE FIND IS THAT WE'RE BASED ON
[1:06:33] THE FOUNDATION OF CHRIST AND CHRIST IS A
[1:06:35] LIVING WORD.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; AND SO WE SHOWED YOU WHAT CAN HAPPEN
[1:06:39] WHEN METRONOMES, THIS IS SCIENCE PART OF
[1:06:41] IT, WHEN METRONOMES ARE COMPLETELY OUT
[1:06:44] OF HARMONY, OUT OF SYNC, OUT OF RHYTHM,
[1:06:45] JUST LIKE A CHURCH CAN GET. IT'S LIKE A
[1:06:47] FAMILY, JUST LIKE A MARRIAGE. BUT
[1:06:49] BECAUSE THAT IT THE PLATFORM IS SOLID,
[1:06:52] BUT THE PLATFORM IS ON MOVING
[1:06:54] FOUNDATION. SO IT'S A LIVING PLATFORM. I
[1:06:56] I'M SHOWING IT AS A TYPE OF A LIVING
[1:06:58] FOUNDATION OF THE LIVING WORD. AND WHEN
[1:07:00] THAT HAPPENS, NOT ONLY DOES THE DOES THE
[1:07:03] MOVING PLATFORM TRANSMIT ENERGY BECAUSE
[1:07:07] BECAUSE NOAH EXPLAINED THIS TO ME IN
[1:07:08] PHYSICS THAT THAT EVERYTHING THAT THAT
[1:07:11] EVERYTHING WANTS TO COME INTO HARMONY.
[1:07:13] THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE LAW OF NATURE. IT
[1:07:15] WANTS TO IT'S TRYING TO GET IN HARMONY.
[1:07:17] AND THAT MOVEMENT IF IT'S IF IT'S STIFF
[1:07:20] THEN THEY JUST THEY TICK TOCK TICK TOCK
[1:07:21] AND EVERYBODY ARGUES AND EVERYBODY HATES
[1:07:23] ONE ANOTHER AND THERE'S NO POWER. YOU
[1:07:25] UNDERSTAND? BUT WHEN THAT PLATFORM CAN
[1:07:27] MOVE IT SENDS ENERGY. THOSE TICKING ARE
[1:07:30] CONNECTED AND THE ENERGY IS FLOWING BACK
[1:07:32] AND FORTH FROM THEM TO THE PLATFORM AND
[1:07:35] TO EACH OTHER
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; AND TO EACH OTHER AND EVERY JOINT
[1:07:39] SUPPLY.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? AND THEN THAT BRINGS
[1:07:42] EVERYTHING BACK INTO PERFECT PRECISION
[1:07:45] FOR THE EDIFYING OF THE CHURCH TILL WE
[1:07:47] ALL COME INTO THE UNITY OF THE FAITH.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; So does THAT MAKE SENSE?
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, LET'S VIEW IT AGAIN. BROTHER
[1:07:55] KEVIN,
[1:07:58] notice the cans under it. It allows it
[1:08:00] to move.
[1:08:04] Say, "Oh, that's close enough." No, it's
[1:08:05] not. Watch it. It keeps going.
[1:08:09] I don't want it I don't want the church
[1:08:11] to be almost perfect. I want it to be
[1:08:16] perfect. Watch this. Give me some more
[1:08:18] volume. C.
[1:08:27] NOW, let's make the church bigger.
[1:08:30] Now, we're going to get a mega church.
[1:08:33] It needs help.
[1:08:36] And there's some that are not going to
[1:08:37] cooperate. And he's going to have to go
[1:08:38] correct them, too. But look at what's
[1:08:40] happening. IT'S ALL OUT OF SYNC. There's
[1:08:42] no harmony. There's no power.
[1:08:46] Watch him. Yeah. Fix those couple in the
[1:08:48] back back there. I'm just kidding.
[1:08:51] Look at that.
[1:08:53] Click, click, click, click, click.
[1:08:56] Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Every joint
[1:09:01] supply. Thank you, brother Kevin. Now, I
[1:09:04] showed you that last Sunday. Now, I'm
[1:09:07] going to and and I've explained how the
[1:09:08] devil can get in there and break up that
[1:09:10] harmony. Now, I'm going to show you
[1:09:12] another science. And this woman is a
[1:09:14] scientist herself, and I did a little
[1:09:16] bit of a bio on her on her background.
[1:09:18] I'm not going to get into it today, but
[1:09:19] she is herself a scientist of the field
[1:09:21] she's discussing. She's taking up as a
[1:09:24] because as a sidebar, she she um she
[1:09:27] does music. Uh I'm not sure what she's
[1:09:30] involved with it, but she um things in
[1:09:32] music in the music world u fascinate
[1:09:34] her. And so she did a video as a
[1:09:36] scientist about the about the same thing
[1:09:40] you just saw about how these this energy
[1:09:43] moves that and you're going to see her
[1:09:45] HERE IN A MINUTE TALK about even even
[1:09:48] people listening to the same music
[1:09:50] together that they can they can
[1:09:52] absolutely be in disharmony BUT IF THEY
[1:09:54] HEAR THE RIGHT MUSIC they can come right
[1:09:56] into harmony and that one will affect
[1:09:58] the other.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; You understand? All right. NOW NOW WATCH
[1:10:02] WHAT HAPPENS. ALL RIGHT, LET'S PLAY THAT
[1:10:03] ONE, BROTHER KEVIN.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; And to have compassion for each other.
[1:10:08] And when you look at it from a
[1:10:09] neuroscience perspective, which I've
[1:10:11] looked through a lot of different
[1:10:13] neuroscience papers on music's effects
[1:10:16] on the brain and music's effects on
[1:10:19] people's psychology. There is actually
[1:10:21] evidence that backs up this idea that
[1:10:24] music can bring people together. When we
[1:10:27] listen to music, when we sing or dance
[1:10:29] to songs that really move us, our brains
[1:10:31] release a hormone called oxytocin. So,
[1:10:33] this is a hormone that's largely
[1:10:35] responsible for social bonding uh and
[1:10:38] social connection. So, the release of
[1:10:40] oxytocin when you listen to music can
[1:10:42] actually make you feel closer to other
[1:10:45] people. And then music also activates
[1:10:47] the pleasure and reward centers of our
[1:10:48] brain. Uh so specifically there's a
[1:10:51] region in the brain called the nucleus
[1:10:52] encumbent. So this combinational
[1:10:55] activation of the reward systems and the
[1:10:57] bonding regions of the brain help to
[1:10:59] promote pro-social uh bonding type
[1:11:02] behavior. Also when we listen to music
[1:11:06] with other people, our brains actually
[1:11:07] start to mirror the emotional states of
[1:11:10] the people that we're listening the mu
[1:11:12] to the music with. This is largely due
[1:11:14] to a type of neuron called the mirror
[1:11:16] neurons in our brains. And so this
[1:11:19] allows us to become in sync with the
[1:11:23] emotions of the people with whom we're
[1:11:26] lo listening to the music. So people's
[1:11:29] brains literally get on the same
[1:11:31] wavelength and sync up emotionally when
[1:11:33] they listen to music that really
[1:11:35] resonates with them. So really, if you
[1:11:37] if you look at that data, it really
[1:11:40] seems that music really is that
[1:11:42] universal language that tunes our brains
[1:11:45] to feel closer and more connected to one
[1:11:47] another. And I think that's so
[1:11:50] beautiful.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I'm sure, thank you,
[1:11:55] Kev. I'm sure that that we can all see
[1:12:00] the opportunity for the Holy Ghost to
[1:12:02] bind us together in love and harmony
[1:12:05] with the right kind of worship music.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Is that easy?
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; See, that's scientific evidence. Our our
[1:12:12] music matters.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; The things you listen to matter.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; You understand? And if we can have love
[1:12:19] and harmony together, you release the
[1:12:21] full power of God in our midst. Could
[1:12:24] there be anything of more value than
[1:12:26] releasing the full power of God in our
[1:12:29] midst?
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; See, but I'm also sure that we can that
[1:12:33] we can equally see the opportunity Satan
[1:12:36] has to do just the opposite if he can
[1:12:39] get in the middle of the program.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; See, WHEN THEY BUILT THE TOWER, YOU WE
[1:12:45] WE CAN GO AND we can look at at the
[1:12:47] upper room experience. They were all in
[1:12:48] one mind and one accord
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; and you see what happened. You've been
[1:12:52] reading that story since a child.
[1:12:54] [gasps]
[1:12:54] BUT BUT THAT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME THAT
[1:12:56] HAPPENED. THAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY BUILT
[1:12:57] THE TOWER OF BABEL. AND THE BIBLE SAYS
[1:13:00] THEY WERE OF one speech and one
[1:13:01] language. And that meant that they had
[1:13:03] the same dialect. AND IT MEANT it's a
[1:13:05] different Hebrew word. That meant they
[1:13:06] had the that they had the same motives
[1:13:09] and objectives. AND SO THEY WERE IN ONE
[1:13:11] MIND AND ONE ACCORD AT BABEL AND ONE
[1:13:13] MIND AND ONE ACCORD IN THE UPPER ROOM.
[1:13:16] AND GOD CAME DOWN AND LOOKED AT THAT
[1:13:18] HARMONY THEY HAD, WHICH WAS CONTRARY.
[1:13:21] THE THE PLAN AND THE MOTIVE THEY HAD WAS
[1:13:24] TO HAVE AN END AROUND AGAINST GOD. IF HE
[1:13:26] EVER FLOODED THE WORLD, WE COULD run up
[1:13:27] INTO OUR TOWER AND WE MIGHT JUST BUILD
[1:13:29] THIS THING BIG ENOUGH AND WE'LL BREAK
[1:13:31] BACK INTO HEAVEN. COME ON.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; HOW ART THOU FALLEN FROM HEAVEN, OH
[1:13:34] LUCIFER? HE'S GOT THE SAME PLAN. IT'S
[1:13:36] NOT NEW. YOU UNDERSTAND? AND GOD LOOKED
[1:13:39] AT THAT AND SAID, "NOW THIS THEY HAVE
[1:13:41] BEGUN TO DO, AND NOTHING CAN BE
[1:13:43] RESTRAINED, EVEN WHAT THEY CAN IMAGINE."
[1:13:45] AND SO GOD NOW USES THE ENEMY'S TACTIC
[1:13:48] AND BRINGS CONFUSION AND THAT BREAKS THE
[1:13:50] POWER IN THE BUILDING AND THE WHOLE
[1:13:51] THING COMES TO NOTHING. ON THE DAY OF
[1:13:53] PENTECOST, THEY WERE IN ONE MIND AND ONE
[1:13:55] ACCORD AND SUDDENLY THERE CAME A SOUND
[1:13:57] FROM HEAVEN THAT FILLED THE HOUSE WHERE
[1:13:59] THEY WERE SITTING AND THEY BECAME THE
[1:14:01] EXTENSION OF THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:14:04] THE SON OF MAN MINISTRY WAS NOW ALIVE
[1:14:06] AND WELL IN THE EARTH AGAIN.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Even though Christ had went to heaven.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, SO SO THESE THINGS THIS THIS
[1:14:15] SHOULD WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT. YOU KNOW
[1:14:18] THIS IS WHY WORSHIP IS so I mean EVEN
[1:14:22] ISRAEL WHEN THEY'D GO TO WAR THEY THEY
[1:14:24] LED WITH SINGERS AND WORSHIP. WORSHIP IS
[1:14:26] IMPORTANT. DON'T MISS OUT ON IT. IT'S
[1:14:29] IMPORTANT to you. It brings YOU IN
[1:14:30] HARMONY AND SYNC WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND
[1:14:33] SETS YOUR MIND IN A POSITION TO HEAR THE
[1:14:35] WORD OF GOD.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; SEE?
[1:14:38] [snorts]
[1:14:41] AMEN.
[1:14:45] Brother Brandham,
[1:14:47] now I want to
[1:14:49] I'm doing good. I want to turn turn a
[1:14:52] corner.
[1:14:53] You good?
[1:14:55] [snorts] Brother Brandham
[1:14:58] took a sizable amount of his ministry
[1:15:02] to teach on the battle of the human
[1:15:06] mind.
[1:15:07] Uh, brother Brandham talks calls it the
[1:15:10] greatest battle ever fought in one of
[1:15:12] the key sermons. But that's not the only
[1:15:14] time brother Brandham. Brother Brandham
[1:15:16] takes that theme throughout. It's
[1:15:18] pervasive throughout the message.
[1:15:19] Brother Brandham is all the time talking
[1:15:21] about he would even say things like the
[1:15:23] right mental attitude toward the promise
[1:15:25] of God can bring it to pass. See, so he
[1:15:28] so he talks about your faith and your
[1:15:30] confession. And these are all these are
[1:15:32] all characteristics that come out of the
[1:15:34] dynamo that is you. Brother Matt was
[1:15:36] speaking about the dynamo. You are a
[1:15:37] dynamo. You have a living spirit inside
[1:15:39] you. It causes your body to run at 98
[1:15:42] degrees. And if your spirit leaves it,
[1:15:44] your body will cool down.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; See? So you have a dynamo inside you.
[1:15:48] And so that's the real you. That's what
[1:15:50] animates the body. The body is just a
[1:15:52] temple the real you lives lives in. And
[1:15:54] that that's that REAL YOU HAS A NATURE.
[1:15:56] Either it's born again or it's not.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; It's not halfway or two threequarters of
[1:16:01] the way or kind of born again. It either
[1:16:03] is born again or it's not born again.
[1:16:05] That's right.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; SO, SO BROTHER BRANDHAM TAKES A LARGE
[1:16:08] part of his ministry to teach on the
[1:16:10] battle in the human mind between divine
[1:16:14] and demonic influence. So the reason
[1:16:17] being is that it touches a fundamental
[1:16:22] human capacity
[1:16:24] choice.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE CHOICE IS A HUMAN CAPACITY,
[1:16:31] it is also a human vulnerability.
[1:16:35] Christ lived, died, rose, ascended, sent
[1:16:40] back the Holy Ghost to remedy just this
[1:16:43] problem.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; The problem existed
[1:16:48] ALL THROUGH THE OLD TESTAMENT, even in
[1:16:51] his seed gene family.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; This is why David, a man after God's own
[1:16:57] heart, this is why David could do the
[1:16:59] things he did with Ba Sheba and even
[1:17:00] involving murder. This is this is the
[1:17:03] problem. This is why Abraham gets caught
[1:17:05] lying twice to save his hide. I mean th
[1:17:07] this is why Joseph DID I MEAN JACOB DID
[1:17:10] WHAT HE DID. I mean th THIS AND BROTHER
[1:17:12] RAM SAID YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO
[1:17:13] HAVE A LOT OF GRACE WHEN YOU come to
[1:17:15] come to Jacob because my goodness what a
[1:17:17] shyer and and just a REPEATED YOU KNOW
[1:17:19] CONSTANTLY REPEATING it until God
[1:17:21] changed him in a spiritual type changed
[1:17:24] his name to Israel meaning prince. AND
[1:17:26] THAT'S WHAT GOD did to you by the new
[1:17:28] birth. HE TOOK YOU FROM BEING JUST A
[1:17:30] LOST HUMAN TO A BORN AGAIN HUMAN.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; And so now he's able TO HAVE AN EFFECT
[1:17:36] UPON THIS UNIQUE HUMAN CAPACITY OF
[1:17:39] CHOICE.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; SO THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY Ghost now and
[1:17:46] I'm really really I've chosen my words
[1:17:48] so carefully.
[1:17:50] The baptism OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT came
[1:17:52] at the feast of Pentecost in Jerusalem
[1:17:56] 2,000 years ago changes the nature of
[1:18:01] the inner man by a supernatural power.
[1:18:04] It's not your flesh that gets born again
[1:18:07] or your spirit. It's your nature.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; And that is and that works because
[1:18:12] there's a gene of God inside that is
[1:18:15] dormant before you're born again. You're
[1:18:17] born with that gene of God. YOU GO ALL
[1:18:19] YOUR LIFE UNTIL GOD hawks you down and
[1:18:22] trips you, KNOCKS YOU DOWN, WHATEVER HE
[1:18:24] HAS TO DO. The Holy GHOST ALWAYS GETS
[1:18:26] HIS MAN OR HIS LADY. AND WE FIND OUT
[1:18:28] THAT HE WILL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF
[1:18:30] THE EARTH. AND WHEN THE HOLY GHOST IS
[1:18:32] CHASING YOU, YOU WILL NOT GET AWAY. I
[1:18:34] WOULD ADVISE YOU TO STOP, DROP, AND
[1:18:36] ROLL. THROW UP YOUR HANDS AND SAY, "I
[1:18:37] surrender all." BECAUSE HE HE WILL HE'LL
[1:18:40] SEND THE FISHERMAN, AND I'M A FISHERMAN
[1:18:42] TODAY. BUT IF THE FISHERMAN CAN'T CATCH
[1:18:44] YOU, HE'LL SEND A HUNTER. AND YOU DON'T
[1:18:45] WANT TO MESS WITH HIM BECAUSE HE'S A
[1:18:47] DEAD SHOT. YEAH.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; SO WE FIND THEN THAT THAT THAT I WANT TO
[1:18:52] SAY IT AGAIN THAT THIS POWER THAT CAME
[1:18:55] AT THE FEAST OF PENTECOST, IT CAME to
[1:18:58] change the nature of our inner man BY A
[1:19:02] SUPERNATURAL POWER. CHANGE THE NATURE of
[1:19:04] our spirit. So now THEN WITH CHRIST
[1:19:08] LIVING IN us and through us, THE KINGDOM
[1:19:11] CAN FINALLY START DOWN THE ROAD to the
[1:19:14] millennial reign. AND MOREOVER, AS I
[1:19:16] SAID EARLIER, UNTIL THE KINGDOMS OF THIS
[1:19:19] WORLD BECOME the kingdoms of our Lord
[1:19:21] and his bride.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? SO THAT THAT new nature
[1:19:26] opens up and it empowers your human
[1:19:30] capacity to believe all the word of God.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT THE SPIRIT DOING THAT FOR YOU,
[1:19:38] YOU CANNOT BELIEVE ALL the word of God.
[1:19:41] PAUL SAID, "YOUR FALLEN SPIRIT MIND IS
[1:19:45] ENMITY AGAINST GOD. IT CAN NEVER AGREE
[1:19:47] WITH GOD." HE SAID, "SOMETIMES THE HOLY
[1:19:49] SPIRIT HAS TO START DEALING WITH YOU
[1:19:51] JUST SO HE CAN GET YOU TO AGREE WITH
[1:19:53] HIM. AND IF HE CAN GET YOU TO AGREE WITH
[1:19:54] HIM, THEN THAT OLD NATURE DIES AND
[1:19:56] YOU'RE BORN AGAIN."
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; SEE, AND OUTSIDE OF THAT, YOU'LL RESIST,
[1:20:01] YOU'LL END AROUND, YOU'LL RE YOU'LL TRY
[1:20:04] TO GET OUT OF IT. YOU'LL YOU'LL BUCK
[1:20:05] AGAINST UH HOLINESS AND GODLINESS, AND
[1:20:08] YOU WON'T LIKE EVERYTHING THE PREACHER
[1:20:09] SAYS. I LISTEN FRIENDS, WE'RE ONLY HERE
[1:20:11] TO TRY TO SAVE YOUR LIFE. I'M SORRY I
[1:20:13] OFFEND YOU. I'M TRYING TO SAVE YOUR
[1:20:14] LIFE. I'M TRYING TO GET US ALL IN THE
[1:20:16] RAPTURE TOGETHER.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S ALL I AM. I'M JUST A
[1:20:21] SHEPHERD ON A HILLSIDE. THAT THE LORD
[1:20:23] SENT ME OUT WITH SOME SHEEP AND SAID,
[1:20:25] "TAKE THESE INTO THE WILDERNESS AND GROW
[1:20:26] THEM AND MATURE THEM AND BRING THEM BACK
[1:20:28] TO ME BEARING WOOL." THAT'S WHO I AM.
[1:20:30] THAT'S WHAT I DO. AND HERE WE GO.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY WANT TO GO BACK BEARING WOOL?
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SEE? SO, SO THIS NEW NATURE, IT
[1:20:40] OPENS UP AND IT EMPOWERS THAT HUMAN
[1:20:43] CAPACITY you have BECAUSE BEFORE THAT
[1:20:47] HUMAN CAPACITY COULD CHOOSE, it could
[1:20:50] CHOOSE GOOD AND EVIL TO A DEGREE, BUT IT
[1:20:52] COULD NEVER comprehend or fully choose
[1:20:55] from THE HEART ALL OF GOD'S WORD. IT
[1:20:57] COULD LIVE IN A COMMUNE.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; YEAH. [clears throat]
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; IT COULD LIVE AS A AS A BUDDHIST MONK.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; IT COULD LIVE AS A AS A AS A HOLY
[1:21:05] HOLINESS LEGALIST. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
[1:21:08] GOD WAS AFTER. THAT'S THAT HE WANTED TO
[1:21:10] GO BEYOND WESLEY'S UNDERSTANDING. HE
[1:21:12] WANTED TO CHANGE YOU FROM THE VERY
[1:21:15] INSIDE AND MAKE YOU A NEW CREATION IN
[1:21:17] CHRIST JESUS SO THAT YOU WOULD DAILY
[1:21:20] WANT TO PUT ON HOLINESS AND TAKE OFF THE
[1:21:22] WORLD. YOU WOULD DAILY WANT TO GET
[1:21:24] CLOSER TO GOD. YOU EVERY TIME THE CHURCH
[1:21:26] DOORS ARE OPEN, YOU'D WANT TO BE HERE IN
[1:21:28] THE PRESENCE OF GOD. AMEN.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; SEE, SO IT OPENS UP YOUR HUMAN CAPACITY
[1:21:35] TO BELIEVE ALL THE word of God. Jesus
[1:21:38] made that clear. There's no one CAN COME
[1:21:41] TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH HIM AND
[1:21:43] THAT YOU'RE EFFECTIVELY LOCKED OUT
[1:21:45] BECAUSE THE OTHER FLIP OF THE COIN IS NO
[1:21:47] ONE CAN COME TO CHRIST UNLESS THE HOLY
[1:21:49] SPIRIT DRAWS him and them to whom the
[1:21:51] Holy Spirit will reveal him. So Jesus
[1:21:54] isn't uh people say WELL THE YOU KNOW
[1:21:58] SALVATION IS FREE INDEED IT IS BUT YOU
[1:22:01] CAN'T STEAL IT.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; You can't buy it or STEAL IT. IT'S A
[1:22:06] GIFT GIVEN TO YOU BY GOD. BUT YOU CAN'T
[1:22:08] JUST WALK UP AND TAKE IT. IT'S GOT TO BE
[1:22:10] OFFERED TO YOU AND YOU'VE GOT TO COME
[1:22:12] WITH A CONTRITE HEART WHICH GOD LOVES.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; SEE, BROTHER RANDOM SAID YOU CAN'T
[1:22:17] REPENT JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO GO
[1:22:18] TO HELL. OF COURSE YOU DON'T WANT TO GO
[1:22:19] TO HELL.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; SEE, but it's MORE THAN THAT. THIS IS
[1:22:22] WHAT WE'RE TRYING. THIS IS WHAT THE
[1:22:23] APOSTLE TRYING TO GET YOU TO. SO, SO THE
[1:22:26] SO ONCE YOUR HUMAN CAPACITY HAS BEEN
[1:22:29] MOVED UPON, your human capacity TO
[1:22:32] CHOICE AND THAT HAS BEEN OPENED UP TO
[1:22:35] BELIEVE ALL THE WORD OF GOD, THEN AND
[1:22:37] ONLY THEN CAN THE APPLICATION OF THAT
[1:22:41] WORD AND ITS POWER BE BROUGHT FULLY TO
[1:22:44] BEAR IN OUR DAILY LIVES DAILY.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; OTHERWISE, you'll be on and off. Yeah,
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; you'll be in and out.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; You'll be up and down. I don't say you
[1:22:55] don't love God. I don't say you don't
[1:22:56] believe the word. I'm just simply saying
[1:22:58] you need to find Calvary. You need to
[1:23:00] have an experience where something gets
[1:23:02] a hold of that nature and changes it.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; It's a supernatural power. And then you
[1:23:06] won't you won't buck against God's word.
[1:23:09] You won't try to end around on holiness
[1:23:11] or godliness. YOU'LL WANT MORE OF IT.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; SEE?
[1:23:16] SO, SO, SO THAT IS TO SAY THAT WHEN THE
[1:23:19] WHEN THE TOKEN
[1:23:21] UH IS DAILY APPLIED, HEAR ME NOW, WHEN
[1:23:24] THE TOKEN IS DAILY APPLIED, it keeps you
[1:23:28] deeply hidden in Christ. AND SATAN'S
[1:23:33] GATEWAYS TO INFLUENCE YOU IS CLOSED off
[1:23:37] and he is effectively held at bay. Amen.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; This is nuts and bolts.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS NOT JUST ME
[1:23:48] SAYING JUST COME DOWN HERE AND LET ME
[1:23:50] LAY HANDS ON YOU. YOU NEED THE HOLY
[1:23:51] GHOST. THAT'S THE TRUTH. EVERYBODY NEEDS
[1:23:54] TO HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. BUT THE TOKEN
[1:23:56] HAS GOT TO BE PUT ON DISPLAY. AND WHEN
[1:23:59] YOU PUT THE TOKEN AND DAILY APPLY IT,
[1:24:01] I'M SAYING IT AGAIN. THAT IS WHAT KEEPS
[1:24:04] you deeply HIDDEN IN CHRIST. AND IF
[1:24:06] YOU'RE DEEPLY HIDDEN IN CHRIST, THEN THE
[1:24:08] UNCONVERTED FLESH AND SPIRIT, THOSE
[1:24:11] GATEWAYS FOR SATAN TO INFLUENCE YOU, HE
[1:24:14] IS CLOSED OFF BECAUSE YOU'RE SO FAR INTO
[1:24:16] CHRIST, SATAN CAN'T EVEN FIND YOU.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; LORD,
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; SO HE IS EFFECTIVELY HELD AT BAY. YOUR
[1:24:23] FLESH IS STILL NOT CONVERTED, BUT HE'S
[1:24:25] HELD AT BAY.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; YOUR SPIRIT IS STILL NOT CONVERTED, BUT
[1:24:28] YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE CASTING DOWN REASON
[1:24:31] AND VAIN IMAGINATIONS. THAT'S A NUT AND
[1:24:33] A BOLT. YOU'RE CASTING DOWN VAIN
[1:24:35] IMAGINATIONS. YOU'RE BRINGING EVERY
[1:24:38] THOUGHT CAPTIVE TO THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:24:40] BECAUSE IF I BRING A A WRONG THOUGHT TO
[1:24:43] THE HOLY SPIRIT, HE WILL DESTROY IT. BUT
[1:24:45] IF I ENTERTAIN IT AND LOOK AT IT AND
[1:24:47] ROLL IT AROUND, THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
[1:24:49] THAT THOUGHT WILL LEAD TO A WORD OR AN
[1:24:51] ACTION, AND YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF PILED
[1:24:53] UP IN A CORNER CRYING OUT TO GOD FOR
[1:24:55] REPENTANCE.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; I I'VE HAD MY SHARE OF THAT. AND I JUST
[1:24:59] WOULD LIKE TO SAY TODAY, LORD, I'D LIKE
[1:25:01] TO BEGIN TODAY, AND I'D LIKE TO WALK TO
[1:25:04] ZION. I'D LIKE TO MOVE UP HIGHER AND
[1:25:06] HIGHER AND HIGHER IN MY LIFE.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; I I AM BORN AGAIN BY THE SPIRIT OF THE
[1:25:12] HOLY GHOST, BUT I WANT TO APPLY
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; the word of God. Amen. [snorts]
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; THIS IS SEE WHEN WE SAY APPLYING THE
[1:25:23] TOKEN DAILY
[1:25:25] DEEPLY HIDES YOU IN CHRIST AND
[1:25:28] EFFECTIVELY KEEPS SATAN AT BAY BECAUSE
[1:25:31] HE CAN'T HE HIS GATEWAYS ARE CLOSED OFF
[1:25:33] BECAUSE THEY'RE UNDER SANCTIFICATION.
[1:25:36] Your eyes, your feet, where you go, what
[1:25:40] you do, what you listen to, what you
[1:25:41] partake of, what you're involved with.
[1:25:43] Amen.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Let me do like Fred Mullins.
[1:25:52] [laughter]
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; That is
[1:25:59] when you do that, that is by definition
[1:26:04] letting the mind which was in Christ be
[1:26:07] in you.
[1:26:09] WHEN YOU APPLY THE TOKEN DAILY AND CLOSE
[1:26:13] OFF THE GATES FOR SATAN TO REACH YOU
[1:26:15] BECAUSE you're deeply hidden, THAT IS BY
[1:26:18] DEFINITION LETTING THE word of God dwell
[1:26:21] in you richly.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Friends,
[1:26:28] think with me again. You ready?
[1:26:31] Paul would have no need
[1:26:34] to admonish the church with this truth
[1:26:37] in principle if the baptism of the new
[1:26:41] birth by the Holy Ghost alone were
[1:26:43] enough.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; If the baptism of the Holy Ghost, that
[1:26:48] initial moment when you're born again,
[1:26:50] and it is an it is an experience.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. When if that WAS ALL YOU NEEDED,
[1:26:55] PAUL WOULD NOT NEED TO SAY to the
[1:26:58] church, "Let the mind which was in
[1:27:00] Christ BE IN YOU." HE'S ALREADY TALKING
[1:27:01] TO BELIEVERS.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Let the word of God dwell IN YOU RICHLY.
[1:27:05] LET IT PERMIT IT. ALLOW IT. You You do
[1:27:08] that. See,
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; SO THIS IS WHY THIS IS WHY THE BIBLE
[1:27:13] TEACHES US THAT WE ARE IN OUR TEXT, WE
[1:27:15] READ IT, WE ARE TO FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT
[1:27:18] OF FAITH. WE are to, AS WE'VE BEEN
[1:27:21] STUDYING, PUT ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD.
[1:27:25] WE ARE, AS THE APOSTLE TEACHES US, A
[1:27:27] DIFFERENT ONE, GIRD UP THE LOINS OF YOUR
[1:27:29] MIND. WHY DOES HE GOT TO SAY THAT? WHY
[1:27:31] DOES PETER NEED TO SAY GIRD UP THE LOINS
[1:27:33] OF YOUR MIND?
[1:27:35] OH MY, KEVIN, LET'S LET'S HAVE SOME UH
[1:27:37] Bible verses.
[1:27:40] Sorry to jump you, bud. I just happen to
[1:27:42] think I want to put them up.
[1:27:44] We're going to go to 1 Timothy 6. This
[1:27:48] was this was our text, so should be able
[1:27:51] to get right to it.
[1:27:53] 1 Timothy 6:11
[1:27:56] and 12. But thou, oh man of God, born
[1:28:00] again, filled with the spirit, man of
[1:28:02] God, flee these things and follow after
[1:28:05] righteousness, man of God. Here's what
[1:28:08] you need to do. BUT I'M BORN AGAIN.
[1:28:09] RIGHT? AND THIS IS WHY YOU CAN BE
[1:28:11] SUCCESSFUL. OTHERWISE, YOU COULD HAVE
[1:28:13] NEVER DONE THIS. YOU COULD HAVE NEVER
[1:28:14] APPROACHED HIM. YOU COULD HAVE NEVER
[1:28:15] BELIEVED ALL EVERY WORD OF GOD BECAUSE
[1:28:17] OF THAT HUMAN VULNERABILITY OF CHOICE
[1:28:20] THAT HUMAN CAPACITY. BUT GOD HAS CAME
[1:28:22] DOWN AND CHANGED THE NATURE WHERE THE
[1:28:24] CHOICE IS MADE.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; UNDERSTAND? AS A MAN THINKKETH IN HIS
[1:28:28] HEART, SO IS HE. SEE,
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; SO FOLLOW AFTER RIGHTEOUSNESS,
[1:28:34] GODLINESS, FAITH, LOVE, PATIENCE,
[1:28:35] MEEKNESS. FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT OF FAITH.
[1:28:37] LAY HOLD ON ETERNAL LIFE WHERE UNTO THOU
[1:28:40] ART CALLED. YOU WERE CALLED TO PUT SATAN
[1:28:44] UNDER YOUR FEET. GET HIM OUT OF YOUR
[1:28:47] MIND AND PUT HIM UNDER YOUR FEET.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; HE WAS NOT. THERE WAS A BATTLE. BROTHER
[1:28:53] BRANDHAM SAID GOD AND SATAN AGREED THAT
[1:28:55] THE BATTLEGROUND WOULD BE THE MIND, THE
[1:28:57] MIND OF MAN. BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD
[1:29:00] SAY, BUT THE IDEA IS NOT TO KEEP
[1:29:02] DRAGGING IT OUT. THIS IS NOT A WAR OF
[1:29:04] ATTRITION. HE SAID, YOU WANT TO DEFEAT
[1:29:06] HIM RIGHT NOW. YOU WANT TO PUT HIM UNDER
[1:29:08] YOUR FEET. GET HIM OUT OF YOUR MIND. GET
[1:29:10] HIM OUT OF YOUR LIFE AND PUT HIM UNDER
[1:29:12] YOUR FEET.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; SEE, how do I do that, brother Jason?
[1:29:17] Here's a starting line for you.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; You ready for a nut and a bolt?
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Ready for SOME RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD?
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; HERE'S A STARTING LINE, BROTHER JASON.
[1:29:27] HOW DO I DO THAT? HOW DO I GET HIM OUT
[1:29:28] OF MY MIND AND UNDER MY FEET?
[1:29:30] PHILIPPIANS 4:8.
[1:29:33] WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE TRUE,
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE HONEST,
[1:29:37] PHILIPPIANS 4:8. WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE
[1:29:40] JUST, WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE PURE,
[1:29:43] WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE LOVELY, WHATSOEVER
[1:29:46] THINGS ARE OF A GOOD REPORT, IF THERE BE
[1:29:48] ANY VIRTUE and if any praise, think on
[1:29:52] these things.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; BORN AGAIN PEOPLE, THINK ON THESE
[1:29:57] THINGS. BELIEVERS, THINK ON THESE
[1:30:00] THINGS. YOU LOVE GOD, THINK ON THESE
[1:30:03] THINGS.
[1:30:05] SEE
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; FIRST PETER CHAPTER 1
[1:30:09] verses 13- 16. Wherefore
[1:30:13] believers, BORN AGAIN PEOPLE,
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; WHEREFORE GIRD UP THE LOINS OF YOUR
[1:30:19] MIND,
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; see they wore LOOSE GARMENTS AND WHEN
[1:30:23] THEY HAD TO WORK OR they had to run OR
[1:30:24] THEY HAD TO CLIMB, THEY THEY WE TODAY WE
[1:30:28] WOULD SAY CINCH UP YOUR BELT. THEY WOULD
[1:30:30] THEY WOULD GATHER EVERYTHING IN AND TIE
[1:30:31] IT TIGHT. JESUS DID THAT. THE DISCIPLES
[1:30:33] DID THAT. AND SO THAT THAT SO PETER IS
[1:30:36] USING THIS SAME METAPHOR TO SAY, "GUARD
[1:30:38] UP THE LOINS OF YOUR MIND BECAUSE YOU
[1:30:40] GOT TO FIGHT.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO BUILD. YOU GOT TO BE
[1:30:43] SOMETHING FOR GOD." SEE, GIRD UP THE
[1:30:46] LOINS OF YOUR MIND. BE SOBER AND HOPE TO
[1:30:49] THE END FOR THE GRACE THAT IS TO BE
[1:30:51] BROUGHT UNTO YOU AT THE REVELATION of
[1:30:53] Jesus Christ. Do you realize that a
[1:30:55] special grace was assigned for this end
[1:30:58] time day? Amen.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Because God knew it would be so dark and
[1:31:03] so impossible. He made a promise in his
[1:31:05] word. I remember many years ago as this
[1:31:07] a young preacher, Brother Donnie read
[1:31:08] that to me and showed me that in the
[1:31:09] scripture. I about had a a running fit.
[1:31:12] And he said, "Wherefore, g up the loins
[1:31:14] of your mind. Be sober. HOPE TO THE end
[1:31:16] for the grace that is to be brought unto
[1:31:19] you at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[1:31:22] These were believers who already had a
[1:31:23] revelation in the new birth. But I'm
[1:31:25] here to tell YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. WE
[1:31:27] ARE LIVING IN THE DAY OF THE FULL AND
[1:31:29] THE COMPLETE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:31:31] GOOD NEWS. THERE'S A GRACE FOR YOU TODAY
[1:31:33] AND A GRACE FOR YOU TOMORROW AND A GRACE
[1:31:35] FOR YOU NEXT WEEK. OH, [screaming]
[1:31:37] HALLELUJAH. LET US ASCEND TO THE
[1:31:39] KINGDOM. THERE'S POWER ON ON DISPLAY FOR
[1:31:43] US. THERE'S POWER AVAILABLE TO YOU.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE A A HUMAN CAPACITY OF CHOICE.
[1:31:49] THAT'S A HUMAN VULNERABILITY. PUT IT
[1:31:51] UNDER THE BLOOD. THINK [screaming] THINK
[1:31:53] WORD THOUGHTS. LIVE WORD LIFE. APPLY IT
[1:31:57] DAILY. PUT SATAN UNDER YOUR FEET. CAST
[1:31:59] DOWN VAIN IMAGINATIONS.
[1:32:01] GIRD UP THE LOINS OF YOUR MIND. BE SOBER
[1:32:04] AND HOPE TO THE END. VERSE 14. AS
[1:32:06] OBEDIENT CHILDREN, NOT FASHIONING
[1:32:09] YOURSELVES ACCORDING TO THE FORMER LUST
[1:32:12] IN YOUR IGNORANCE, but as he which hath
[1:32:15] called you as holy, SO BE YE HOLY IN ALL
[1:32:20] MANNER OF CONVERSATION. THAT'S A
[1:32:21] LIFESTYLE. BECAUSE IT IS WRITTEN, "Be ye
[1:32:25] holy, for I am holy."
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Friends, how many of OF GOD'S APOSTLES
[1:32:31] AND PROPHETS DO I have to read TO YOU
[1:32:34] TODAY TO GET YOU TO BELIEVE THIS IS THE
[1:32:37] PATHWAY TO VICTORY?
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY MORE QUOTES AND AND SCRIPTURES
[1:32:41] I COULD READ TODAY, BUT FOR THE SAKE OF
[1:32:43] TIME?
[1:32:45] THIS IS SURE AND STEADFAST. YES.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; SEE, YOU SAY, "BROTHER JASON, WHAT IS
[1:32:51] MORE IMPORTANT? THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
[1:32:54] GHOST OR PUTTING ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF
[1:32:57] GOD?" BOTH.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; OKAY, let me let me say it more clearly.
[1:33:03] WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT? BOTH.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; OKAY, LET ME REPHRASE. WHICH IS MORE
[1:33:09] IMPORTANT? BOTH.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; OKAY, LET ME BE MESSAGE POLITICALLY
[1:33:15] CORRECT. WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT? BOTH.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; BOTH.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; You're gonna have to have them both.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? I I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE
[1:33:26] PASSED FROM DEATH TO LIFE CAN NEVER COME
[1:33:27] INTO THE JUDGMENT. I GET THAT. BUT I
[1:33:29] DON'T WANT TO WALK AROUND A FAILURE. AND
[1:33:30] I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU WALK AROUND A
[1:33:31] FAILURE. I UNDERSTAND THAT ELECTION
[1:33:33] TRUMPS EVERYTHING. I UNDERSTAND THAT. I
[1:33:35] UNDERSTAND IF I WAS IN HIS MIND, I COULD
[1:33:37] NEVER BE LOST. I UNDERSTAND THAT THING.
[1:33:39] BUT I'VE STILL GOT APOSTLES TELLING ME,
[1:33:40] "GIRD UP THE LOINS OF YOUR MIND.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; BE SOBER MINDED. CAST DOWN VAIN
[1:33:45] IMAGINATIONS. PUT ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF
[1:33:47] GOD.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; FLEE LUST AND PURSUE RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[1:33:51] CHASE IT. GO AFTER IT. TRACK IT DOWN.
[1:33:56] [clears throat]
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM IN THE SEVENTH SEAL.
[1:33:58] I'M GOING TO CLOSE WITH THIS. Uh
[1:33:59] Anthony, bring your team and come on
[1:34:01] back if it's you or whoever you're
[1:34:03] assigning it to. [clears throat] Come
[1:34:04] on, musicians.
[1:34:06] Stand to your feet with me.
[1:34:13] You want to hear this from the seventh
[1:34:14] seal?
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Boy, that's a important sermon.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Seventh seal was probably perhaps the
[1:34:22] most important sermon in 2,000 years
[1:34:25] since Paul was preaching at Ephesus.
[1:34:30] Brother Brandham says, "I thank him,
[1:34:32] thanking God, of course,
[1:34:34] for Jesus Christ." Now, listen. Listen
[1:34:37] to these words. I was going to put it
[1:34:38] up, but I decided not to. Just want you
[1:34:39] to listen.
[1:34:43] I thank him for Jesus Christ.
[1:34:47] For without sending him for the
[1:34:50] propitiation of our sins,
[1:34:53] we'd all be in a big muck of sin with no
[1:34:58] hope.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; But by his grace, his blood cleanses all
[1:35:04] sin. Just like the DROP OF INK IN A
[1:35:08] BUCKET OF CLOROX, you'd never find the
[1:35:10] that ink again. When our sins are
[1:35:12] confessed, it's put in the blood of
[1:35:14] Jesus Christ. They'll never be known
[1:35:17] again.
[1:35:19] I just say, "Blessed be the name of the
[1:35:21] Lord." They'll never be known again.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; God I didn't even know this could happen
[1:35:28] till a prophet said it. God forgets
[1:35:30] them.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; They They never was even done.
[1:35:41] Look at your neighbor and say, "God
[1:35:42] forgot all my sins."
[1:35:44] You chickens, you bunch of cowards, look
[1:35:46] at your neighbor and say, "God forgot
[1:35:47] all my sins."
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Where's your confidence? God forgot all
[1:35:53] my sins.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; They never was even done. Turn around
[1:36:00] and shake hands and say, "They never was
[1:36:02] even done." Come on, Bethl. They never
[1:36:05] was even done.
[1:36:08] I want to see lips moving. They never
[1:36:10] was even done.
[1:36:15] Listen,
[1:36:17] you couldn't say this. If a prophet
[1:36:18] hadn't said it, you wouldn't have the
[1:36:20] authority. That's an that's an audacious
[1:36:22] statement.
[1:36:24] THE AUDACITY TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
[1:36:26] NOW, IT'S PERFECTLY IN LINE with Paul's
[1:36:28] teaching, but Paul never said it so so
[1:36:30] poignantly, so succinctly. It God
[1:36:34] forgets them. They never was even done.
[1:36:38] As long as that sacrifice is laying
[1:36:41] there in an atonement for us, then
[1:36:43] that's all. That's it. We're not sinners
[1:36:48] no more. Hallelujah. [laughter]
[1:36:51] We're Christians by the grace of God.
[1:36:55] Remember? Remember, in our OWN SELVES,
[1:36:58] WE'D PROBABLY be just as bad as we ever
[1:37:01] was. But see, the grace of God has
[1:37:05] appeared to us and that's what has made
[1:37:08] us [music] what we are today. Christian
[1:37:11] brothers and sisters, God bless you,
[1:37:14] Christian brothers and sisters. I HOPE
[1:37:16] YOU'VE GOT gained a little bit of
[1:37:18] insight today on this on this nuts and
[1:37:22] bolts [music] type of sermon. Listen
[1:37:23] friends, this is this is this will what
[1:37:26] give you it's what will give you victory
[1:37:28] [music] on a daily basis. I don't know
[1:37:30] about you, but I covet that. I want that
[1:37:33] more in my life. I don't care about
[1:37:34] riches and fortune and [music] glory. I
[1:37:36] want to be victorious in Christ. Amen.
[1:37:42] Great is the measure of [music] our
[1:37:45] father's love.
[1:37:48] Think about it now. Oh, think about his
[1:37:52] blood.
[1:37:54] [music]
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, think about his goodness.
[1:38:00] Think about his grace
[1:38:04] [music] that he's brought us through.
[1:38:10] For [music] as high as the heavens above
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; so much.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Great [music] is the measure [singing]
[1:38:18] of our father's love.
[1:38:24] Oh, [music] great. Great is the measure
[1:38:27] of our father's love.
[1:38:32] [music]
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Think about his [singing] love.
[1:38:37] Come on now. [music]
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Think about his goodness.
[1:38:43] Think about [singing] his grace
[1:38:47] that he's brought [music] us through.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Think about that.
[1:38:52] For as [music and singing]
[1:38:53] high as the heavens above,
[1:38:57] so great [music] is the measure of
[1:39:00] [singing]
[1:39:01] our father's love.
[1:39:04] [music]
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; So great, great is the measure [singing]
[1:39:09] of our [music] father's love.
[1:39:14] Oh, [singing] think about his love.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; I want to think about it today.
[1:39:20] Think [music] about his [singing]
[1:39:21] goodness.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Think about his grace
[1:39:28] that [music] he's brought us through.
[1:39:30] Let me have my ministry team. My
[1:39:32] ministry team for as high as the heavens
[1:39:37] above.
[1:39:39] So [music]
[1:39:40] great is [singing] the measure of our
[1:39:43] heart.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, great.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Great is the measure of
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Allah.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Jack, come on up here with us.
[1:39:58] We're going to pray over Brother Brad
[1:40:00] getting ready to head to Honduras.
[1:40:03] Probably in my mind when you're going to
[1:40:06] a youth camp, there is so much [music]
[1:40:09] value in that because you're shaping and
[1:40:12] winning the hearts and minds of young
[1:40:14] people who are the chief target of the
[1:40:16] enemy and you're winning the hearts and
[1:40:18] minds of young people for Christ. How
[1:40:20] many will join with us and pray for our
[1:40:22] brother [music] that the Lord will go
[1:40:23] before him, go before him, prepare the
[1:40:26] way, defeat every, let every enemy that
[1:40:28] sees him approaching howl and faint.
[1:40:30] Amen. Let's believe it that way. Brother
[1:40:34] Jack is here and uh I've I've held this
[1:40:36] over my heart the whole time [music]
[1:40:37] praying this for our sister Kathy. I've
[1:40:40] just been praying for her every day. And
[1:40:43] brother Jack and I were talking this
[1:40:44] morning. He told me [music] she wanted
[1:40:45] me to have this and preach with it. I
[1:40:47] said, "Brother Jack, let it be. Let it
[1:40:49] be that that the anointing of the Holy
[1:40:52] Spirit [music] will be upon it and that
[1:40:54] her faith and confidence in the
[1:40:56] ministry, God will honor that." Do you
[1:40:58] believe that? Brother Jack, put your
[1:41:00] hand right there. All all together here.
[1:41:03] Father, in the name of Jesus [music]
[1:41:05] Christ, we pray for our brother Brad as
[1:41:06] he goes forward. Lord, he's going into
[1:41:09] the missionary field, Lord. We commit
[1:41:10] him now into [music] your hands. We
[1:41:12] commit his family and his home in his
[1:41:14] absence. Lord, may those services be
[1:41:16] [music] dynamic and powerfilled. May the
[1:41:19] enemy be defeated, Lord. May the enemy
[1:41:21] be [music] completely obliterated from
[1:41:23] the hearts and minds of those young
[1:41:25] people, Lord. May there be great victory
[1:41:27] in the camp. May [music] there be
[1:41:28] perfect faith in the word that is
[1:41:30] delivered. May you anoint our brother to
[1:41:32] know the words that he must speak. May
[1:41:34] you grant it, Lord. We commit him into
[1:41:37] your hands. Master, [music] we're all
[1:41:38] with our hands upon this prayer cloth
[1:41:40] for our sister Kathy. In the name of the
[1:41:43] son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:41:45] [music] We send forth this prayer. We
[1:41:47] pray over this handkerchief. It was
[1:41:48] under over my heart the whole sermon
[1:41:50] under your anointing. Lord, let it be
[1:41:53] that when it lays upon her body, the
[1:41:55] enemy WILL GET SCARED AND RUN FOR THE
[1:41:57] HILLS, LORD. AND MAY OUR SISTER KNOW
[1:41:59] PERFECT FREEDOM THROUGHOUT HER BODY, may
[1:42:02] she I'm going to ask big. MAY SHE BE
