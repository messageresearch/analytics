our hearts can be open to hear the word Lord God just break the bread of life to us in Sunday school Lord in the service Lord through your presence father Lord just have many needs Lord we're thinking of our dear brother Joe father this morning Lord I pray that father you could just minister to his family Lord and allow your presence to just come and move in his life and in their lives Lord Jesus give them that peace Lord Lord the peace that Lord you promis would pass even our own understanding Lord we just commit this Sunday school into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ amen let's just uh we're going to open up the word this morning God bless you good to be in the house of the Lord here a little bit rainy but it's okay uh we're going to turn to the Book of John John the first chapter the gospel of John and we're going to read five verses my title for this morning is going to be There's Something About Life John 1 says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not God bless you as you take your seats this morning I'm going to start with a just uh a quote from a message the uncertain sound this morning it's what kind of sparked my heart for for the topic U brother Brandon begins uh talking about the little posum and I'm sure most of us are familiar with the story a little pum had been struck and was just in awful condition and the Lord had just dealt with the prophet's heart you know a little possum is laying at your doorstep and he's waiting it's waiting to be prayed for that little mother there and the prophet couldn't understand it at first you know all these hundreds of people waiting to be prayed for sick children and everything that he had on a list in his pocket um but yet he was speaking to him about this little possum you know but the God who created the possum was showing that he cares about the little things in life he cares about everything and uh even even what seems to be insignificant ific he cares about it and the Lord Jesus healed that little possum he says in the uncertain sound he says and he turned into the gate and I went out to meet the posum I took a rake I thought strange he may be blind but what makes him act and reeling like that I laid the rake over him and he turned and he looked at me and he growled and I thought there's something strange and I happened to look down in her pocket a possum is one thing besides the kangaroo there's only two that has a pocket that carry their young in and in the pocket of the possum she had eight or nine little babies in there and a dog had got a hold of her either a car broke her leg her shoulder brown green flies all over maggots in the ears and so forth and here she was hobbling up like that and she growled because she thought I was reaching for her little ones the little wa lady wouldn't wait she wouldn't even stop partly she went straight to my steps and exhausted laid there we tried to get her up she was gone she was still grunting suffering so tremendously then it says Mrs wood came up and Mr wood and them said brother brandom I believe the Humane thing to do would to be kill the only you could you do it someone else come in by and said brother brandom won't you kill that possum said kill her she's dying and she's laying there suffering take those little ones out kill them they'd be better off say they haven't got a soul it's just a dumb brute just an animal the poor little things will starve to death and the poor mother laying there with them little B babies nursing the milk from her and you know what condition she was in said they're going to die she said I'm you know I'm a he brother brandom says I'm a true Hunter but I'm not a killer said I love to hunt but I don't like to do the killing that's a killer that's right I don't I don't kill nothing that I can't eat or something I can't make use of I just I couldn't do it I just couldn't do it and I know sensibly in the mental Realms in the right way of thinking the Humane thing to do would to be kill that pum and the little ones the psum was dying and would never gain Consciousness again again and the little ones would starve to death that was the sensible thing but something down here wouldn't let me do it crowds began to come and and I had a call that went out and that night brother wood and I were walking out down the road and sister wood and my wife coming down from up toward Scottsburg where I was trying to get a little mental rest brother wood said you see that little puppy back there on the road said it's going to get run over so I Whirled my car around and I went back and we picked that poor little fellow up he was full of fleas and M and M should eat him up what would be the sensible thing to do would to be kill the dog but I couldn't do it I brought the little fell home got me some flea powder sprayed him got me some mange cure give him a good decent meal got him hit away trying to get the little fellow to get well he wants to live you know sometimes just to bring it bring it to us here this morning that's how it is with people they just want to live they they the case may look look hopeless and situations sometimes seem hopeless and it may seem like the only thing to do would be write the person off as unsavable because of the situation but watch what brother brandham says in this statement he says there's something about life that's real there's something about life that's real don't impersonate Christianity get life and live get life and live you don't have to battle yourself around and say well I'm a Christian I ought do this I ought and do that just live there's one who cares for you you know and you know being a Believer I think sometimes is misunderstood so many times from the world you know we we wear long dresses we we don't cut our hair we don't drink or we don't cuss you stay away from immoral things you don't lie you know little things bother you like telling small white lies but it's misunderstood by the world it's not a self-righteous act or a list of of rules of dos and don'ts it's life it's life life being lived through US amen and sometimes it can be impersonated like the prophet said but the fruits of that impersonation will eventually come out and it will make known the the the the fruits will be made known but when it's a real genuine life in Christ there's something special about it amen there's something it shines out a light that outshines the darkness and your life projects his life to the world it's the life of Jesus Christ being expressed through us he does those things through his family and you know there's just nothing like living for the Lord Jesus you know uh my my delight as Psalms would say my delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law do I meditate day and night we we don't we we do certain things or we don't do certain things because we love the Lord and doing that which pleases the father that's all that matters now in our life that that's that everything else has now taken second place and that's what matters the life amen knowing he cared so much for me that he saved me of my wretched condition cleaned me up and changed me out amen I think we all can have that kind of that that mentality you know the the life you live before Jesus you know people think that they're living before they have come into relationship with God they can have nice things you know they they live their best life but until they've tasted from the fountain that never runs dry the Water of Life God's word the void in their life can never be filled if you remember when brother brandom comes and tells the testimony he was between services and and he went over to this burger joint and he was just having a a a a meal and he goes in there it was just a a dirty place to be you know he starts describing it there's a jukebox in the corner playing some bad music and a policeman with the with his arm around some poorly dressed woman and playing slot machines which was illegal in the city at the time and an older lady you know that was kind of dressed wrong you know smoking cigarettes in the corner with some guys at the table and and in his heart he just started condemning the situation he started condemning what was going on he said oh my God how how can you stand it I said why don't you wipe it off the face of the Earth then I was sitting there thinking that and all of a sudden something struck me and the Lord said for me sit down and I went over there in the corner behind the door and I started praying I thought Lord it looks like you just simply tear the whole you know will my little Rebecca and Sarah have to my two little girls will they have to be raised up here in a world under such as that I thought how can you stand it Lord when it makes a sinner like like me shiver to think of such a thing you know but Jesus had a daughter over there in that corner amen he had a daughter waiting for for life to come in into that place she was there was something there was something in that place and brother Brandon was drawn to it but God had to correct him a little bit in that situation amen he began dealing with the prophet's heart you know they're living in sin But but so were you but it says that Waters of Separation 1955 says well I got back there and I saw a vision that changed my picture alt together I seen a world turning I noticed around it was a streak like red all around I know where we're probably all familiar but it's it's good to go through these things and I wondered what it was and as I drew close before I seen myself as a boy and when I would sin well I seen Jesus standing in front between me and God and his blood acted as a bumper every time I did something wrong it would hit him and he'd say father forgive me he he doesn't know what he's doing and and i' do something else and it was just like a bumper on a car to keep me God can't stand sin the day you sin you're gone that's all but the blood of Jesus was protecting me from the Wrath of the wrath of God for me and my sin would catch it and he say father forgive him he don't know what he's doing and I looked and I said Lord is my sins treating you like that and I seen on the book there I I crawled up a little closer R blood just running down his face and my name was at the top and all kinds of sins wrote on it said L will you forgive me he touched his side and wrote pardon there throw it on the back behind him in the sea of forgetfulness and I said oh how I appreciate you Lord he said now I was willing to forgive you of your sins and you're but you want to stand back here and condemn them for their sins my you know and he went over to that woman that day and I you know and she began to just he began to just describe what had happened you know out of an honest heart that's that's how somebody can know that that you're real and you're genuine and he just he just began to be honest with you know I was standing over there in the corner and I was condemning you in my heart but the Lord corrected me and as he began to witness her she began telling him of of her story you know she was once a Christian raised right in church but I got mixed up in the wrong kind of things and you know the devil just got me off my beaten path and I married a man and and he was a drunk and and and then she just lost her way and she told him that she thought she had sned away her day of Grace that she had done too many wrongs in her life that the Lord couldn't forgive her anymore but brother Brandon was able to discern that spirit and said he said do you still have respect for the Lord and she said yes sir I do and he said then he hasn't left you and he L her straight to the Lord Jesus Christ that day they kneeled right down there in that Tavern if you want to go read the story he tells it several times and amongst the darkness as we read in there and a light shined through that Darkness that's what it it's all about friends that is what life is all about leading people to that light she was like that posum or like that dog you know it looked like her life was too far gone to be helped but something deep down in her heart was crying out for something more than what she had a life that that just hadn't struck yet a light that that wasn't there yet but just enough light struck that seed and it brought it to life amen what an opportunity we have as Sons and Daughters of God to show that light to others when you know sometimes people are in such a dark place in their life where you know light hasn't shined in a long time but as soon as the light of the Lord can break through life can break through that Darkness I know we have many witnesses here this morning you know that we're living in dark lives but the Lord Jesus through through his light shined in their life and changed their life amen by the grace of God John 13 says by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one for another you know and expressing to that to someone can show them exactly what they didn't even know that they were looking for amen the truth is what sets people free and by expressing that life you know in in how the Lord lives it through us that's why it's that's why we do meditate on the law every day that's why we do the things we do because it's the life being expressed through us and that light being shined out to the world it's not a self-righteous thing it's not a we do it because we want to do it and we do it because it's God living through us doing it Amen brother Tim uh said something last weekend and and and it just kind of stuck with me um he said you know there is still a predestinated sea that the light of this gospel has to strike in order for us to go home amen and because the Lord Jesus is interested in that one seed we ought to be equally as interested and I just that just has struck me brother Ram says here in uh testimony this is just when he went to go talk to her just wanted to share this this is really neat it says and I told her what I had seen I stood here and condemned you and God ought to come in here and tear the place up with such as going on but I've changed my mind God forgave me and I want him to forgive you and right there at that seat I letter her to Jesus Christ amen see it's your listen to this it's your attitude towards things amen it's your attitude towards things don't condemn others if they do wrong be good to them anyhow just look over those things because God has had to look over a whole lot for you and I that's right right God help us to always have that attitude in our hearts you pray for me that I'll never look upon people like that no more no matter what they're doing that I'll always look up on them that they're creatures of God that God sent his son to take their place and me as a minister I'm grateful that he forgave me and I want him to forgive them also that's the way we should do it amen it's our attitude towards things the prophet says and we don't use that as an excuse to shun away from declaring the gospel Amen to declare that Sin is Sin to separate from unbelief but if we can have the right attitude in our hearts when we do that thing then I think that's where the person can see the life of Jesus Christ being expressed through US amen you know I think sometimes and I'll just I'm not saying any of you or just pointing them all back at me I think sometimes we we can get into a state where we look at a person maybe we can just cond condemn them like brother brandom did there if only they would do this or they would do that you know even the prophet was guilty we just put our two cents in and we say strike this place down like brother Brenham was saying it's too far deep in sin it's too far gone but then the Lord Jesus steps in and he reveals to you exactly what place you used to be in you know we look at that you know that was a long time ago right but God doesn't have a construct of time remember when brother Steven was here there's no construct of time for God so you were in that place once but that person there's a light in there amen and there's a life that God wants to show to them amen and then he adjusts our ad accordingly we can't ever disregard any case amen there's no helpless case that God can't change he's the infinite God we are to sigh and to cry for the Abominations in the city but from a place of humility a place that that cries for the light of Jesus to strike those Abominations and to change their hearts Jesus said in Matthew 11 take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and I am lowly in heart and then ye shall find rest un your souls there's something about when the Lord Jesus can teach you not through a teaching but through a life amen we're going to get into this in just a minute but you know I could preach a thousand sermons in my life but your life could affect more people than a thousand sermons could ever affect amen there is just something about life that's real Amen brother brandham says um in Christ is the mystery of God revealed the only way that you can actually be a Christian is for Christ to identify himself in you that's the only way for you to be a Christian and he says moving on in paragraph 448 he says now notice god making himself known now we're not supposed to make converts to Christianity by a government but by the Revelation the Christ in you as God was in Christ as God was in Christ and Christ in you when that God did in what God did in Christ Christ does in you what son signs did God in Christ Christ in you oh my isn't that beautiful says go further paragraph 463 says life like like taking life out of one tree and putting it into another take life out of a pear tree and put it into an apple tree it'll bear pears it's got to because the sap the life in it the germ is a pearry all right then listen to this then all of our actions should declare him we have his name is that right we should bear his name that what a statement if we just Ponder that for a moment all of our actions should declare him amen we have his name we say that we're Christians what is Christians it means to be like Christ then we ought to bear his name amen and when we take his life his life lives through us you know it's it's not uh it's it's the life of the Lord Jesus living in your soul living out and pouring out through your spirit and through your flesh Amen brother bom says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed it's not a group it's a personal Vindication of a pregnated child of God filled filled with the Holy Ghost so surrendered to God that he doesn't care about anything else and the Holy Spirit living its life pulsating through him showing the personal Vindication of the word itself now listen here he says expressing itself to the people and to the world when you're baptized Born Again of the spirit of God it's God expressing itself to the world and to the people amen and look at the importance of his life pulsating through you he he chose people he chose individuals as vessels to vindicate himself to the world Amen th those fruits of the spirit the attributes of Jesus just flow out of our life and you're literally written Epistles read of all men amen like Jesus walking around on on Earth just expressing himself to the world um you know that woman she had heard of brother brandham if you go listen to the testimony she had heard of brother brandham and she had heard of his ministry you know and God just cared so much about her that he sent him along could have went to any restaurant that day he could have went to any place he could have stopped there had a thought and walked out because many times we do that but God but God had someone there God God cared about that little woman and he changed his attitudes changes his attitude towards all of it just to ask ourselves a question this morning are all of our actions declaring him and is his life pulsating through us you know what's I just was checked in my heart what's our attitude towards things what's our attitudes towards people we can't ever lose sight of what is the most important thing and that's pointing others to that life and showing that Christ still can change a life amen I just pray that I you know I can have that attitude always in our hearts you know I pray that we can all have that kind of attitude just to reflect to reflect Jesus you know sometimes like I was saying earlier sometimes the situation looks helpless it seems the sensible thing to do would to be write me off you know I was once in a place where you look at me and you just write me off but God rich in Mercy came down and he and he just cleaned me up he cleaned my life out nothing I could have done I didn't change myself I couldn't change myself but God rich and mercy changed me amen and he does that still in life he's still in the saving business he's still in the healing business he still does those things amen you know sometimes it just all someone needs is is how brother Brenham had that attitude towards that little mangy dog you know I can't I just can't I can't write him off I can't shoot him down like that or or that dying possum just pray for him and see what the power of God's transformation can do in that person's life you know he saved you with that power he saved me you know death would have been a better option but his light changed me amen and I said this once I'll just just to say it again the sermon that you preach through your life is more important than anything you know it's it's how God expresses himself here today it could be someone's Lifeline amen and he just says to requote that quote he says you pray for me that I'll never look upon people like that no more no matter what they're doing that I'll always look upon them and that they're creatures of God that God sent his son to take their place you know and as me as a minister I'm grateful that he forgave me and I want them I want him to forgive them also and that's the way that we should do it and he had said brother brother Tim had said that you know we have that last Soul so let's let's let's organize our life to match up more with his word so that a light can shine in that last seed so we can go home because I'm ready to go home amen God bless you all Let's uh God bless you all we're going to just take a few minutes and the song leader will be out uh let's just bow our hearts Heavenly Father Lord God we just thank you for this morning we thank you for the word father we just pray that Lord Your Atmosphere could just come and move in the hearts of our lives today Lord we come this morning with a great expectation Lord God that Lord you the creator of all things Lord God would just descend down and walk among us today and just Minister unto our hearts I pray for Lord our our pastor today I pray that Lord you just anoint Him Father anoint our ears to hear father we love you now and we just submit our hearts to you now in the name of Jesus amen God bless you
