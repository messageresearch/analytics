word this morning that the book of joel amen the book of job chapter 1. [Music] just a prayer request that just came in says pray for brother ronald mccann he's been in the hospital since wednesday an infection of some sort and on oxygen he also has pulmonary fibrosis we want to remember amen brother ronald mccann i'm going to go to prayer here in just a minute we'll pray for that need i'm going to put this aside here amen joel chapter one i'd like to just continue on uh a series that i spoke on in two parts and we're just going to continue that in part three today and brother josh you have a powerpoint you can have that ready whenever you are i'd like to speak to you this morning on what the lord just began to weigh upon me and press down and that's just the way that i would explain it the lord just began to burden me with this and just begin to turn up things that he had stirred my heart up to previously and then begin to churn it again and so i believe the lord has something for us today you believe that raise your hand if you believe that say lord i believe you have something for me today amen let's just um let's just read here from joel chapter one and we'll just begin reading here at verse 2. i'm preaching on restoring years part 3 restoring years part 3. here you hear this you old men and give ear all you inhabitants of the land hath this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers tell your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation that which the palmer worm hath left hath the locust eaten and that which the locust hath left hath the kink or worm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten awake you drunkards and weep and howl all you drinkers of wine because of the new wine for it is cut off from your mouth for a nation has come up upon my land strong and without number whose teeth are the teeth of a lion and he hath the cheek teeth of a great line he hath laid my vine waist and barked my fig tree he hath made it clean bear and cast it away the branches thereof are made white lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth the meat offering in the drink offering is cut off from the house of the lord the priests the lord's ministers mourn the field is wasted the land mourneth for the corn is wasted the new wine is dried up the oil languisheth be you ashamed o you husbandmen how all you vine dressers for the wheat and for the barley because the harvest of the field is perished the vine is dried up and the fig tree languisheth the pomegranate tree the palm tree also and the apple tree even all the trees of the field are withered because joy is withered away from the sons of men gird yourselves and lament you priests how you ministers of the altar come lie all night and sackcloth you ministers of my god for the mead offering and the drink offering is withholded from the house of your god sanctify you a fast call a solemn assembly gather the elders of and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the lord your god and cry unto the lord alas for the day of the lord is at hand and as a destruction from the almighty shall it come is not the meat cut off before our eyes yea joy and gladness from the house of our god the seed is rotten under their clods the garners are laid desolate the barns are broken down for the corn is withered how do the beasts groan the herds of cattle are perplexed because they have no pasture yea the flocks of sheep are made desolate notice joel's then after his message and he gives the assessment the diagnosis of the condition of not just the people but all of the earth all of the land all of their possessions and then joel cries and he says o lord to thee will i cry for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field the beasts of the field cry also unto thee for the rivers of water are dried up and the fire hath devoured the pasture of the wilderness i want you to look at chapter two we're just gonna i know i've had you standing but here for a minute but let's just continue this in chapter two we're not going to read the whole chapter where chapter one was important let's read to chapter two and notice what he says here at verse 13. let me make sure that's where i want to be here yes verse 13. let's back up to verse 12. therefore also now saith the lord turn you even to me with all your heart and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning and arrange your heart and not your garment and turn into the lord your god for he is gracious and merciful are you glad for that slow to anger and of great kindness and repenteth him of evil i want you to look here at verse 21 fear not o land be glad and rejoice for the lord will do great things he says be not afraid you beast of the field for the pastors the wilderness through spring for the tree beareth or fruit the fig tree and the vine do yoder strength be glad you be glad then you children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he has given you the former reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of wheat and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil and i will restore to you the years that the locusts hath eaten the canker worm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm and my great army which i sin among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed lord jesus i just bow my head right now with everyone in this building lord those that are listening live online those that are here gathered here this morning father those traveling out and about pray for my family today lord in washington i pray that you would give them a great time a refreshing lord may you keep them in your care father i pray for us here lord the needs of the people that have came here lord needs that i'm sure i don't even know about lord many different lord all of us here today are standing lord in different various spots in our life i pray god that you would come and lord may you be the speaker may you be the hearer may you anoint your word father may it just find its proper resting place in the hearts of your people we ask it in jesus christ's name amen amen you can be seated thank you amen you can be seated this morning i'll take just a few minutes here and just recap i forgot to pray over this memo so i'll get this at the end that's yes that's my uncle ron yep so we'll pray for that at the end just don't let nobody don't let don't nobody let me forget that for the end i'll take some just a few moments here and a lot of this some of this will be a little bit of review but i believe it's important it's been just a few weeks since we spoke on this so we'll go over some of uh what we're reading about here in the book of job we took a lot of time to read all of chapter one and i believe it's going to be important for us to understand in the context of this promise that god gives and he gives a promise and he says for i will restore to you the years of the cankerworm the caterpillar the palmer worm and so to understand that promise or the significance of what god was promising you look at this time or the setting of joel and joel is going to speak to pre-exile before they're taken off into babylon he's going to speak in the time of uzziah that's when joel is going to be begin his or have his ministry and uzziah that was uh the golden years of israel it was a time of great increase when you think of uzziah you think of a time of great uh increase both in their economy in their military the administration that they were under it was a great time of success a great time of peace of prosperity of ease the bible would call it and you would read you'll read this in the bible and it calls it the years of fatness and it means the years when they're increased the years when there's plenty plenty enough to go around and there's not a lack for anything but it was a year of fatness and increase further than that it was a time of peace arrest where the land was resting the people were resting there was no war there was no famine it was a time for israel in this golden year golden years of uzziah for those 52 years it's a time of great plenty and great increase it speaks of uzi and said his his fame spread as far as the border of egypt because he became very powerful man who is the success of his kingdom is second only to solomon who we know solomon was the real golden year for god's family in that era it was a time of great prosperity but joe's prophecy comes of restoration and we read in chapter one it speaks of that that this great plague that god had brought upon the land because we understand that for years god had been sending them joe was on the uh uh just on the hills of obadiah and and on the heels of that was another prophet who would come with a message from the lord and he was trying to get them to turn from their sin because in all of that plenty and in all of that time of increase and all of that time of success they had drifted they had fallen they had forgotten the lord and so god sends them a plague and i want you to notice joe's prophecy of restoration he tells us in chapter one of their natural condition and in chapter one it's the it's a let's a contrast because prior to the plague that god sends their vats are overflowing the oils flowing like a red olive oils flowing like a river and the pomegranate trees and the the the apple trees are loaded down with fruit it's a great time a spiritual condition uh our natural condition of great plenty but god's ultimate message from joel and his ultimate burden isn't concerning their natural condition so much but it's actually their spiritual condition you see to god our spiritual condition or our spiritual health is really all that really matters to god you know brother matt our health matters sure it does our our that we live the bible says the promise that we that we prosper it'd be in health sure to a child of god god saved you and there's promises that we have and god's concerned about all of those things but when it really comes down to it when you really narrow it down the most important thing to god is your spiritual health i hear the words of brother branham say i would rather eat so he said i would rather drink soda or branch water and eat soda crackers and he said but know that my spiritual condition i was healthy i was where i needed to be with god than to have all the riches of the world but my soul lost somewhere in sin amen i say amen to that you see our physical life our emotional life is has a significance and important but ultimately it's our spiritual condition that god is the most concerned about and so much that if god has to uh and let me say this this way because it's in the context of job notice what he says when he promises he'll restore he says and i will restore unto you the years of the locust and the canker worm and the caterpillar and the pomegranate did you ever notice he says my great army that i sent to you so hold on the cankerworm and the pommel worm and the caterpillar god sends a plague of locusts and those locusts devoured everything in the land of israel they devoured if you watch them we played a video the last time of the locust that would go and even just recently there was a great plague of locusts and outbreak and that they hatch and when they hatch they travel for hundreds of miles a day and then as they eat they they become grasshoppers and then they fly and then they swarm and then they devour everything in its path and there's nothing left they eat it bare all the way to the root and god sends them this and so his their spiritual condition is the biggest concern to god in so much that if he has to break your physical condition to fix your spiritual condition [Music] if he has to break your bank if he has to break oh no brother matt don't go there if he has to break your family if he has to disrupt your business if he has to disrupt disrupt your marriage to in order to somehow shake you and awaken you to get to the so that the surgeon can get to the root of the problem in the heart then the bible says he's a kind heavenly father and as the prophet of god says no real mother or father likes to spank the child or discipline them but he said if you really love them even if it hurts your feelings you'll correct the error that you see you say why does a parent do that because their ultimate condition my chill my child's ultimate outcome not that i don't look at the here and now but where are they going to be ahead what are they going to turn out to be their ultimate condition their their their their their what they're going to be in life as a mother and as a father is more important to you it's more important to you what they are becoming than what they are right now are you with me here this morning let me say this god cares more about where he's bringing you to than what it looks like right now somebody can grab a hold of that by faith god cares more about where you're going to be than where you're at right now and you say lord i don't understand what's happening and things seem out of place and the puzzle's not fitting in it looks like everything's just disarrayed and i can't make sense of my present i can't make sense of what god's doing right now but often god uses what's happening right now the pressure and the stress and the trouble and the struggle he's using that as a tool to bring you to what he wants you to be i'm glad i have a heavenly father like that that doesn't get discouraged by my failures right now in fact he doesn't even look at him right now he doesn't even get discouraged or worried about what he's what they're looking like right now because he knows i've got a plan and i'm bringing them to something right now i'm not going to look at the here and now and what i don't see or what i do see oh brother i just say lord if you're not discouraged then don't let me be discouraged but let me lift my hands up and say lord it doesn't matter what it looks like right now i believe you've got a plan you've got a purpose and you're bringing me to something you've envisioned as joel mentions this he says their vine was flourishing and there was the contrast but prior to the plague the vines flourishing the fig trees pomegranates the apples fruit trees flowing like a river but notice what is what doesn't it's just so clear in the bible it's so clear in our life oftentimes what does material goodness bring and that could mean money that can mean health that could mean good times whatever we call that what is material goodness a lot of times if we for a moment just hang up our angel wings and take our halos off of our heads sit them down here for a moment take those unbuckle those wings and be honest one be honest really with ourselves that sometimes the best natural conditions the times of plenty and fatness all often times leads to great spiritual poverty and sadly for some it eventually leads to spiritual death moses had already warned them long a long time in deuteronomy 6. if you could display that brother josh that would be good we're just going to wait for you just for a moment to display deuteronomy 6. i want you to listen to this warning from moses and i'm just trying to be good about my time here as i got just a lot to get to deuteronomy's chapter 6 verse 10 notice this is what moses says here in deuteronomy 6 10 and it shall be when the lord thy god shall have brought thee into the land which he swore unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac to jacob to give the great and good cities notice the the the context here when he brings you over to give you good great and goodly cities which thou buildest not verse 11 and house is full of all good things what does that mean to a believer houses that are filled with good things you know as a christian your vessel your house is filled with good things amen you may not even realize some of those good things that god's placed in your house you say brother matt i just i look like a i i feel like i'm just a mess and i i just don't even i feel you know maybe no matter where you're spiritual you fall on the hot cold uh or i should say hot cold lukewarm spectrum wherever you feel like that today no matter where you fall in that as you come here to church on sunday morning let me just remind you that when god saved you and god cleaned you and god filled you no matter how distant you feel right now god has filled your house with good things your mind is filled with good things that you didn't put there your spirits filled with good things that you may not even know are there until the right circumstance and rights right uh variables line up and you get into a situation and then you react and you say i didn't even know that was i didn't i didn't know that was there but god's deposited something inside of you he's deposited good things he put joy sister chastity put joy in your heart and you didn't even you didn't buy it you didn't give your money you didn't you didn't earn it but god gave you a as the song says he put a heart he put a song in your heart that you didn't put there god put a joy in your heart that you you didn't buy you didn't purchase but god just gave it to you you may you may feel far away but you believe in god that's a good thing god put in your heart you may feel distant from god but you have a desire for the things of god that's a good thing he put in your house and he says he filled you with good things and well he says which thou notice this and house is full of good things which thou fillest not amen you didn't do it god did it amen and wells digged which thou digest not vineyards and olive trees which thou plant us not when thou shall have eaten and be full so when you've eaten when you've realized all of this when you've ate everything and you've just been eating on the good things of god and you didn't do anything for them you didn't ask for them and and you didn't earn them but god just gave them to you and you're eating and now you're full and then here comes the warning for moses verse 12 then then at that moment beware lest thou forget the lord which brought thee forth out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage when you come into the land of the holy ghost you're going to realize there's promises there's there's there's there's uh good things in your house there's food on your table spiritually there's a heart and a soul that wants to serve the lord when you get over there you're going to realize your house is filled with good things that you didn't feel you didn't do this god did it wells that you can draw from that you didn't dig someone else dug let me give you one of those wells i didn't know i i forgot my bible i guess in the back if i could have my bible i would say here's a well that you can draw from that you didn't dig give me a give me a a spoken word book give me give me give me a spoken word book i'd hold it up this morning and say here's a well that you didn't dig but you this morning can open it up and can draw from that well and you can pull out good things from god you're feeling dry you're feeling thirsty open up the word of god oh my brother and my sister let me just tell you i don't care how low you are how low you feel turn on a tape of god's prophet let that voice begin to ring into your ears and go down into your heart and what is it it's a well that you didn't dig but you can draw from it it can reverse a spiritual decay it can reverse spiritual lukewarmness it can reverse depression [Music] i'm a witness could take some of life's hardest times and hardest trials and most puzzling circumstances but let me turn on the tape of god's prophet and hear those words i was listening to it last night faith in action man my part began to get stirred i began to feel faith you know what it was doing it was it was like a battery getting plugged in into a charger felt like my battery was at red flashing five percent charge now plug in now that's all my battery usually is of my phone and it's charged charge now five percent four percent this laptop is gonna die you know what you do you reach over you find that charge and you plug in charging but everything works right you know what it did when you turn on a tape when you open the word of god you're taking your charge and you're plugging in and say lord charge me i feel weak i feel like my battery's draining but i want to charge i want to plug into the power of the holy spirit hallelujah amen he says well you dig not no no labor involved there's no sweat there's no stress there's no blisters there's no calluses when you'd work for something and you've did it with your hands and you've put your effort and you've put your labor and you've put your strength into it it becomes important to you it's valuable you protect it you lock it you put security cameras up you don't let nobody touch it because you've worked very hard for it but you see the holy ghost isn't that way it's a gift that god gives you those promises that god gives you you didn't work for them you didn't toy for them you didn't you didn't toil you didn't sweat there's no calluses god just freely you have received so freely give and god says because of that then beware lest you forget the lord he gives you good things oh let me move past this to just here for a moment we're just still in some review this is exactly what happens to israel in their greatest time of prosperity they forget the lord so what does god do he sends a plague is it to punish them is it to pick on them is it god who's angry and upset and go fine you won't serve me let me send some locusts your way and see what happens and god's up there you know some maniacal purpose listen friends how you view yeah what god is doing in your life how you view your trials is so important because if you view them as you've you've messed up and god's punishing you it will completely contort and distort your entire image and your perception of what god's doing and why he's doing it yes amen it's not to hurt you it's not listen everything god does is a good thing as brother john sings the song he's a good good father that means anything he brings in your life whether it causes pain or loss is a good thing why does he send it out of revenge not at all why does he send a plague of locusts is it because god's cruel no he does it because he's the surgeon trying to get to fix their spiritual condition because that's what's most important to him amen and let me say this here because i have it here on my notes and i feel inspired to say it no matter what god does in your life he had a reason and he had a good reason to do it amen amen you may not know why and you may not well what was the good reason i don't know i may not as job he didn't find out his entire life went to the grave not understanding until he seen his redeemer and then it all made sense you may not know the reason but he's got a good reason you say why brother matt how do you know that because he's a good good father amen that's what he is and whatever he does in your life he's a good father it's for my benefit notice what brother branham says here that you could put up the powerpoint there and the message leadership he says oh god i love this here let's notice brother branham's prayer here he says oh god let me go lord he says don't leave me behind you i just want to wait just for a moment there we go notice this prayer oh god let me go lord don't let don't leave me behind jesus let me go with you father i don't want to stay here on this earth to watch these tribulations coming on i don't want to stay here in this insanity i don't want to stand here when hideous sights the people losing their mind you'll have to advance it brother josh it's not there we go the people losing their mind we look at men trying to act like beasts and look like beasts and the women trying to look like animals with the paints on their face knowing that these things are predicted to happen that the thing will though going so insane till locusts will raise up with hair like women to haunt the women and teeth like lions and things like that you've said the mental condition of the people will be completely gone we see it in the making right now yes we do and he says restore to us the same mind the same mind of christ jesus our lord i want to give you a chance here just to raise your hand and grab a hold of that and say lord that's my prayer this morning don't leave me behind jesus take me with you and and while i'm here restore to me the same mind of christ jesus our lord you think covet was a plague you think cole colbert was just wrecked the entire world a little virus that has wrecked the whole world go read revelations 9. you'll find out what a plague is and you realize covet was just a little speck of dust the bible says that there's things coming upon the earth that men would literally have heart attacks at just the sight don't leave me here lord let me go with you father don't let me be here to experience why does god send those things to purge that's what it's for a purge it's it's to purge the world so what do i say lord i don't want to be part of that purge but in order to do that i've got to be part of this purge so lord let me be purged right now by the holy spirit purge me of anything that's not like you lord notice what he says here wake up in verse 5. you can just pause that here for a moment he says wake up uh he he wants what is he looking for look at joel chapter 2 quickly if you could brother josh sorry to keep you going back and forth joel chapter 2 verse 12 therefore also now saith the lord turn you even to me with all your heart with all your heart yes amen turn to me with oh lord have i done that come on have i turned to you with all my heart all that's within me and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning rind that means to tear and rend your heart not your garment that's what they would do a prophet would take burlap it was made of goat skin i believe if i'm correct it was made of goat's skin it was itchy they would take that burlap and they would wear it like a garment they would take their cloak and they would wear that burlap itchy garment for i forget how many days 11 days or something was many many days and they would then take ashes and they would they would take ashes and dump it all over the just in uncomfortable condition they'd walk through the city crying out to god what were they doing they were trying to make intercession they were interceding on behalf of the sins of the people they were saying god hold back your judgment forgive us lord of our evil forgive us that's why jesus says blessed is he who sighs and cries for the abominations done in his city he doesn't have a spirit of judgment of wipe them out god just tear the whole thing down annihilate them but he has a heart to say lord if there's even one save even one lord if there's even if there's ten abraham said well if there's five if there's one would you do it just for one god he says ridden's your heart and not your garment don't just come to me with your outward emotion and tears that's fine but make sure with those emotions and those tears that you cry is a heart that's rendered not your garment ring your heart what we need in this age is less conformity less external conformity and more internal transformation because we've had a lot of external conformity with no internal transformation amen he says rend your heart and turn unto the lord for he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repentethium of the evil who knoweth if he will return and repent notice this what's god trying to sow he's trying to sow his word into this condition of this evil heart he's trying he's he's pushing he's he has a desire he knows what's around the corner because his his burden his passion his desire is to restore the years he wants to restore the pomegranate tree the other the apple tree he wants to restore the wine and the oil hallelujah but he's first in order to bring a restoration god first must have a heart that rinse and he preaches this message and you know what the reaction you know what the reaction of israel is after all of you read all of chapter 2 and you could just feel the weight of everything joel says you know what sadly the reaction that the bible records for most of the people who heard joel's sermon most of them went out and got drunk i want that just to sink just for a moment most of them who heard the convicting preaching the heart of god most of them just grabbed another beer amen most of them just became more intoxicated you see people will always have two different reactions to coming disaster amen some will prepare and repent others just get drunk amen listen to what brother branham says here go back if you could brother josh and the sudden secret going away of the church brother adam's speaking here of the attack on pearl harbor and he says and on the night and on the night just before the great attack the next morning there was a great dance or a big party given in pearl harbor itself and no matter how much they tried to say that the japs were coming they still would not take warning let's just look on them next slide for a few moments there's a little radio bulletin goes out a little piece in the corner of the paper about like a healing campaign would be advertised just a small place that the japs were on their road in the waters of the sea a great fleet was headed that way nonsense says the others we don't believe in no such a stuff as that what are you trying to scare us about and then we find getting close to the night i can see at the home place instead of them preparing for to get out of the city why the young girls were all putting on their new frocks and so forth they were going down to this great big jubilee they were going to have and also the officers of the army were just busy riding little passes so that the soldiers could all attend this party big drunken party and the trunks were trucks were roaring and humming bringing in their best of beer and their wine and stuff for this party and all the time the japanese fleet on its road there and they fell to hear the warning and as the sun began to set they all gathered in this great tavern of a place maybe on the side somewhere the bartender polishing the bar or something said something like this say did you hear the rumor come on nah i don't believe i did said the man he spoke to oh yes they say something about a japanese fleet let me i just lost it here he says oh yes they say something about a japanese fleet be coming this way and then someone else drops in on the conversation a young silly girl bounces up there and sticks her foot up on the bar and said you gloomy headed warts don't you know that we're here for to have a good time and not talk about war if that isn't just about the way the world is saying today about the coming of the lord you old-fashioned fogey back numbers what makes you dress and act and do the way you do but we're looking for that secret setting appearing of the lord for there's something in the air a message of the holy spirit that tells us the coming is at hand why are you why why brother matt why why are we doing this listen what he says he says oh and he says oh you don't don't believe much of nonsense you're all worried we're your fog he preaching things like that brother man says they say why do you dress like that why do you why do you act like that why do you do is it because a preacher told me to no that's not why is it because you got some book or some code you're trying to line up to i don't know about you but that's not why i live the way that i live is it out of some kind of fear in some way you were raised nope ain't got nothing to do with it then why because there's something in the air there's a message of the holy spirit can you hear it i can hear it i can hear it whispering and echoing into my heart that there's a sudden secret catching away of the bride that's why i live the way that i live that's why i assemble myself at church that's why i say amen to the word of god that's why i wake up and pray that's why i read my bible that's why i hear the word of a vindicated prophet because there's something stirring in the air [Applause] he says then when the big shindig went on next quote oh it must have been a horrible thing that night first said that sometime during the night that took a young lady a beautiful built young girl stripped her clothes from her put on put her in a little wagon with just one underneath garmin i'll run her down the street and so forth just having a big time it's a real story brother madam's reading from just running around telling you having a big time and all the time all the time all during all of the party during all of the frolic during all of the show all the time the japanese was gaining ground coming right on and then the next morning when the men on the post of duty and the airplane signal watching and so forth had been out all night drunk and running around with these women and so forth was so drowsy and upset the next morning from the big party until they were caught asleep on the job and i'm afraid that it's going to be likewise at the coming of the lord the church is so took up and drunken with the wow i think i wrote that must have said sin i think it was supposed to say sins of the world did i write that wrong brothers no no that's what he said they're so drunk and they're so intoxicated they're so caught up not with sin oh i don't live a sinful life brother man i'm sanctified you know i kick the television out of my home i i try to apply the token of my house but let's be honest friends are we so drunken and intoxicated with the busyness of life amen to they're going to be asleep at the post of duty at the coming of the lord till they're going to be asleep at the post of duty at the coming of the lord this is exactly this is exactly what happens to israel most people just became more intoxicated and it's sad most people hearing the message of the hour has became rather than getting their hearts and preparing to become ready i hear the preaching of the word of god it comes in like an arrow straight like an arrow of deliverance straight to the heart and instead of preparing and repenting like we should be we just say give me another give me hand me another one come on give me another one let me drink myself further into my life let me drink myself further into my dreams and my ambitions and my hopes my businesses my plans my whatever it is let me just let me and let me intoxicate myself further i'll just take another trip i'll i'll get another high i'll i'll take another drug and go a little bit deeper and a little bit deeper friend don't you realize that's the trap of the enemy that's the trap of the devil the pied piper who's trying to get people just to fall into this stupor and in this sleepiness and in this laziness but god sent in a message today to say wake up church there's a sudden secret appearing of the lord and it's right upon us i just say lord don't let me be asleep at the post of duty don't let me be so drunk and in the cares of my own life let me be ready lord and do whatever you got to do cut away whatever you got to cut away cause whatever whatever you have to send in my life to make me ready i just want to be ready oh is that your heart's cry above all else more than anything else in life you could say lord i just want to be ready whatever you got to strip away whatever you got to do lord do it i'm ready here i am surrendered oh god i don't want to be caught off guard i i sleep at the post of duty so drunken with the cares of this life but i want to be on guard i want to be sober minded i want to be vigilant i want to be ready at the coming of the lord jesus so joel gives them this prophecy now notice this here brother brandon begins to tell this story and he begins to tell how he was walking he preached preaching on pomegranate locust cankerworm and caterpillar he says not long ago i was thinking i was way up in canada and i was riding one night i'd been way back about 40 50 miles thousand miles from a hard top road last fall was back there a hunting and when i was riding out through the moonlight i'd come to where there was a big old burn over you know what that is a like a controlled burn and he says that come where there was a big old burn over there was a great big bunch of great big tall stately pines and the moon was shining on them he was there at night time the moon was shining on them it looked like a graveyard a spooky looking place and he says and there came a wind coming down and the wind began to hit them and they'd go moo [Music] just a mournful sound i stood out looked at it a little bit and i thought of this scripture right here he's reading joel chapter 2. i thought of this scripture right here yes sir those trees put me in a mind of some of these great big fine spired churches standing up here just as dead as a door now wow he says i stood even dead as a doornail the next slide even the pommel worms ate all the bark off of them and everything else the the fiery trials has blazed all the spirit away from it and there's nothing left but a big stature just as dead as it can be keep going just as dead as can be and when the rushing mighty wind comes from heaven the only thing they can do is groan and carry on and say it ain't so that's right hardly knowing anything that's right and he says they say days of miracles has passed just every time god sends a revival and signs and wonders begin to come up and fall around the people and things like that they say all the days of miracles is past he says what the power worm left the caterpillar eaten what the methodist left the baptist eaten what the baptist left the presbyterian eaten what the presbyterian left the pentecostal eden until it's got to a place god why you just you he says you strip the tree of everything it's got all the power all the joy all the good things that god give to his church on the day of pentecost they've tore it out nothing left but a big church name huh ha hallelujah here brother branham do that like a spooky hallelujah brother says that's what i was reminded of this great big burn over this forces great big stately pines the outward shell of those pines of what used to be and when the rushing mighty wind of the holy spirit and god begins to move what's the matter watch the same thing you've took the route of the dead tree amen what the pomera worm left the caterpillar the baptist took the shouting away from the methodists one eats this and one eats that till they strip the church down until they got them setting just as dead as a doornail that's right no spirit no shouting no joy no peace no healing no nothing high he says how oh my what the methodist left the baptist eaten what the baptist left the caterpillar eaten or some other church and this one eat this and this took that away and this took that away you haven't got nothing but just a church creed and brother adam says you know that's the truth yes amen you know that's the truth that's the truth what one left the other eat until you ain't got nothing but a big dead tree and every time god sends a big rush of glory down just sit there and moan and say i don't believe it it's psychology it's this it's that it's this it's that we'll move dead from the roots twice dead plucked up by the roots it's a sad looking day amen it's a sad looking day when joel looked at that and saw that he said but god said i will restore saith the lord i can hear brother branham on that tape he says hallelujah if it wasn't in there i wouldn't know how to preach it in other words he's looking at the bible and he looks at the condition it looks at the church and he says what's it going to do i think they can't they they can't go in the rapture the way that they are they're in the condition that they are and they can't do nothing about it brother branham says but then i look down and it says but i will restore he says if it wasn't in there i wouldn't know how to preach it but i will restore saith the lord i will keep it there i will restore saith the lord so what is god promising here what's he promising here in a restoration what what does it mean to be restored brother matt what is what we just heard brother i'm talking about they took the pommel worm the caterpillar the locust they took the shouting away they took the joy away they took the signs away they took the wonders away brother madam says oh therefore there's something wrong in the church that i don't have this you can just mute that for a minute you could just mute that brother josh thank you notice what what brother what what what what what the prophet of god begins to preach locus palmworm caterpillar i will restore saith the lord all the years yes amen all the years of the of the the the this great army has eaten away and brother branham says what was it it was a promise to that bride tree i don't have this so just listen as close as you can i didn't have time to get it on the on the screen he says god said i will restore it he's going to restore this bride tree how by four he says four death messengers killed it then four life messengers will restore it what was the first martin luther justification what was the second john wesley sanctification what was the third pentecost with the restoration of gifts the holy ghost baptism of the holy ghost what was the fourth the word what the word oh how i wish i had time to go back into ezekiel and pull them dry bones and show you he said can these bones live he said prophesy how can prophecy come only through a prophet it's the word of the lord hear you dry bones the word of the lord and sinew skin came upon them they stood up a mighty army they begin to march towards zion and notice what brother adam says here he says but the life only come when the sinew skin was on them when the wind blowed upon them that's when come back that fourth message of life was brought back i will restore saith the lord hallelujah glory praise be to god the fourth light is to come that will bring forth the same signs watch justification brought back the pope sanctification brought back the bark doctrine of holiness what brought back the leaf pentecostals notice what brother is describing here and you have it in your in the the image when jesus says accord unless the quarter wheat goes into the ground and die it abideth alone and so brother branham says what was it that first church what was that first alpha church that book of acts church that's what we're to be restored back to it was a seed church it was the original church it was the beginning church i want to read you here just for a moment i want to read you something by a man named cushing biggs hassle lived back way back i think he died in 1928 and he has a book here you can get from me i can give it they have it online as a pdf i thought it was just so good i wish i could display it for you to read it just so you could follow along with me but i'm just going to read it you just listen this is the 12 marks of the apostolic church listen to what he says about this first church the church of the first century was a spiritual kingdom set up in the world by the son of god and fulfillment of the jewish economy and in opposition to all other religions of the earth and this militant kingdom of emmanuel notwithstanding the combined secular powers of the world progressed to such an extent that in about 70 years after the crucifixion of christ it pervaded portions of every province of the roman empire in it is an aggressive principle against sin though purely of love to mankind that will never cease its action until time shall be no more many errors had crept into the church from time to time in different parts of the world but that system of discipline which had been established by christ and his apostles had proved effectual in removing these errors in faith in practice the apostolic age is the fountainhead of the christian church as an organized society separate and distinct from the jewish synagogue it is preeminently the age of the holy spirit the age of inspiration and of legislation for all subsequent ages here springs i love how he writes that in its original freshness and purity the living water of the new creation christianity comes down from heaven as a supernatural fact yet long predicted and prepared for and adapted to the deepest wants of human nature signs and wonders are extraordinary demonstrations of the spirit for the conversion of the unbelieving jews and heathens attend its entrance into this world of sin it takes up its permanent abode with our fallen race to transform it gradually without war and bloodshed by a quiet leaven-like process into a kingdom of truth and righteousness in virtue of this listen in virtue of this original purity vigor and beauty and the permanent success of primitive christianity the very beginning i want you to contrast that to what the prophet of god says i want you to listen to this listen just listen to some of these quotes that i have here and he's brother and this is palmer worm locust cankerworm caterpillar now we know that we can only build a church first upon the material that god gave us to build it with can you say man to that that's all we have and i know this is strong that it's on tape hundreds of people around the world will hear it but before we can have a building of a church of god we will have to restore back all those things that these insects has eaten out of it we have to go back and find out what the insects ate we just heard about it and before this vine of the lord the grapevine he's the vine we're the branches before we can ever find out or the church can stand in its formal and original power we'll have to go back and find out what these insects ate and that church will have to be restored back to that or it will never stand in its power and glory of its first standing i want to be so clear on what we're teaching here today the true church is a continuation of this church say brother matt what did the message come to restore a message of restoration to go back to the first church i hope you catch the significance of that my brother my sister we've not been restored back to 1947 we've not been restored back to the thoughts of a kentucky hillbilly that's not what wasn't about stories and hunting stories and fishing stories we've been restored back to the original faith of the apostolic church amen and if we're not then we're not anything amen we're just the name of a stately pine that used to be amen if we're not restored back to that i hope you catch the significance of that today what was the message to do what was it to accomplish it was to turn the hearts of the children that's me that's you back to the faith or the experience or the preaching or the doctrine or the practice the practices that's what acts means it means the practices a message of restoration to restore us back to the apostolic message of the apostle paul amen this is the very reason brother branham could stand in the in the vision when he goes remember remember when he's standing there and he says well he says the judge is there will paul's group be accepted and he says yes he says well then praise god he says then that means we'll be accepted because i preached exactly what paul preached and he says in the voices of thousands of people echoed out we're resting on that that's our hope that's our rest that's our that's our that's our faith that we've been restored back to the original faith of the apostolic church so if we don't match if we don't match the pattern then do we throw out the pattern and say well we just need a new age gospel with we need we need a new way of looking at this we need to dumb it down as as our pastor's been preaching we need to dim the light come on you know just dim it down and and we need something else no no no if if we don't match the pattern we don't throw out the pattern we don't we don't cut a pattern bigger to fit us we say lord hold us down amen that's my desire that i fit the pattern that's what brother madam says he says and the church will have to be restored back to that or it'll never stand in its power and glory of its first standing it goes on and on and on now the first thing i don't i want to save time because i don't have these and it's ready but just listen the first thing the church was established on the day of pentecost peter peter preached the inauguration sermon service when the church was born the christian church was born on the day of pentecost amen and god is infinite infinite meaning he can't change his church must remain as it was at the beginning the church must remain the same as it was we found out that the foundation the foundation what we build our church upon listen our church here today bethel tabernacle is not built on the personality of jason watkins the church and he's listening i guarantee he's saying amen the church is not built on the personality of jason to mars or matt watkins or what whoever you want to name the song leaders the deacons the church isn't built on the ideas of a ministry team the foundation of the church is not even built on the doctrines or stories of the message of the hour but actually the church is built on the foundation of the pentecostal church the original apostolic church prophet of god didn't come to lay a new foundation but he came the message came to restore us back to the foundation already laid i know we took a different gear but this is just important this morning he says after we found out that the foundation must be original it must go back to the foundation it must go back to where it was the vine if something's wrong with it the vine's not operating let's go back and find out what's wrong friend you should do this in your own life if something's not operating don't blame the preacher don't blame the church don't blame the message go back and make sure you're built on the right foundation glory amen it must go back he says if it was divine something's wrong with it if the vine is not operating let's go back and find out what's wrong one of the first things i'd like to mention is something that's going away from the church one of the main things is faith the people don't have faith today like they had in that day some kind of a cankerworm or some sort got in and ate it off the lifeline ate off the lifeline of faith he says but i believe that there's a real genuine gift of the holy ghost and we earnestly contend for that we stand for it we believe it saints speak with tongues listen i don't they say i don't believe in divine healing i don't believe in a bunch of fanaticism but we do believe there is a god and he heals the sick and that he's the same yesterday today and forever amen if god brought forth his first branch out of that vine was a pentecostal branch with power with visions revelations healings sanctifications holy spirit the next branch will be the same thing amen will be the same thing are you here this morning brother and begin he goes over this i don't have all the time just to read these over and over and over again but but the point is it was a restoration back to the original faith the original church amen the third the church going back to this this uh article written year many years ago the church of the first century forms the standard and example for the church of all future ages listen how he says this should there now exist an on earth a body of professed christians who occupy the same ground in faith and practice as that of the church of the first century they are right and if any should be found occupying a different position then they are wrong the true church of christ and false or nominal churches are to be compared no matter what brother adam says it says you're you're to compare every church with this first pattern this first church in fact he goes further and says then the messenger to that age so that alpha age will typify or pattern himself after the apostle paul amen listen to this the 12 marks and we're not going to go through all of them the 12 marks of the apostolic church here's the first mark listen close the apostolic church consisted only of those persons the apostolic church consisted only of those persons who had been convicted of sin by the holy spirit amen and who had given signs of repentance towards god and faith in the lord jesus christ as the son of god their faith was the faith of god's elect a steadfast and earnest adherence to the doctrines of the apostles and prophets including the total depravity of the human race and consequence of the fall of our first parents the special eternal election of god's people to everlasting life just stay with me here the particular redemption purchased by the blood of christ for all of his people the effectual calling notice i'm just going to move through some of this quickly let me let me get to the part i would like to read uh he says here he says the jewish and heathen doctrine of salvation by human works they utterly refused while they heartily embraced as their hope the christian and bible doctrine of a free and full salvation by the sovereign grace of god in other words the first and chief mark of the apostolic church was a regenerated and converted church who had been born of the holy spirit who had a vital revealed experimental religion who were quickened circumcised in heart a new creation beloved of the lord children of god the saved added to the church of god the elected vessels of mercy who worshipped god in spirit and in truth living stones this is all the church consisted of living stones built upon a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices accepted to god by jesus christ a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that they should show forth the praises of him who had called them out of the darkness into his marvelous light amen the first mark of the first church consisted only of those who were born of the spirit of god amen only those who were regenerated by the baptism of the holy ghost amen amen the promise is to you and to your children and are them that are afar off as many as the lord our god shall call the promise is unto you amen say brother matt why why is that so important because it's the foundation of the church it's the beginning of the church i i'm just going to say this here today i'm going to i'm going to preach right through a spirit of resistance this morning that is the truth of the true apostolic church regardless of how the the world has watered it down the world has redefined it the world has re-explained it as putting your name on a book or just saying you believe or repeating a sinner's prayer or saying you have faith and mental knowledge of of jesus the first church mark characteristic was a church who was filled with the baptism of the holy spirit they were regenerated by an experience in the holy ghost by a new birth and my brother my sister i'll make it as clear as it needs to be if we have not came to that it doesn't matter what we call ourselves we're just that old stately pine amen and that's why when the wind of the holy ghost blows there's no reaction there's no moving of the spirit there's no joy there's no dancing there's no shouting we don't go back and blame the preacher we don't blame the message we don't blame how it was preached we blame our experience amen amen what was the mark of that first church they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ they were filled with the holy spirit they had signs and wonders miracles following their life that's what the bible says that's what that's what brother branham says he says they're not chasing they're not sign seekers we don't chase signs signs chase us that's the you say brother matt what is that that's the real true pentecostal church that's what we've been restored back to that's what the message came to turn your heart back too that's what it means when it says i will restore to you all the years of the locus and the caterpillar and the palmer worm all the great army all the things that they stripped away i will restore it back to you what's he going to give a true experience in the baptism of the holy ghost he's going to give a true experience that causes you to turn away from the things of sin to change your desires where you don't lust after the things of the world but you start longing for the things of god he sanctifies you and fills you with the spirit [Music] no one has to beg you to come to church no one has to beg you to live right to dress right to talk right no one has to beg you to do that it's an it's a fountain that's flowing from the inside when your foundation is right that's what it will produce that's what it will produce when your foundation is right listen to what brother adam says here put that powerpoint as we close where we've been late let's just close listen what brother branham says what joe looked at and saw that he said but god said i will restore saith the lord hallelujah if that wasn't in there i wouldn't know how to preach it but i will restore saith the lord i happen to look that night there when the wind was blowing i love this part he says i happen to look go go advanced brother josh advanced till you're with me keep going one more i happen to look that night there when the wind was blowing through how stiff and starchy and dead it was sitting there moaning and groaning didn't have no life to bend with it no bark on it to make it flexible yes amen you know what you got to be as a believer you got to be flexible you don't want your experience to grow starchy and cold and you can't move you just starchy and stiff nothing's gonna move me that's how those trees were he says didn't have no life to bid with no bark to make it flexible it was just there moaning and groaning on account of the wind oh my doctor so and so and so and so oh my come on but i happen to notice down underneath there was some undergrowth coming up some little bushes about like that they had life in them when the wind began to hit them they was just twisting and ringing and shouting go back they was just twisting and ringing and shouting and having a glorious time he says oh let me tell you brother god's going to raise up a generation of people out of this dead stuff that's going to restore saith the lord god's going to raise up a people who believes in signs and wonders going to raise up a people who's got joy unspeakable and full of glory when the rushing mighty wind comes in gives right into it and frolicks and dances and glorifies god i say lord i want to believe today we're a church of that undergrowth that when the wind of the holy spirit moves we're flexible and we move with the holy spirit i want to believe we're go we're that generation of people the brother of adam said god would raise up amen who believes the word of god stands for the word of god preaches the word of god and lives the word of god hallelujah he says green leaves are clapping their hands having a wonderful time what a frolic that little undergrowth was having oh but that big old tree standing there just moaning and groaning some wind look the same wind was making one moan and groan was given the other one big time i happen to think well what's this one doing every time that little tree would twist what would it do it would just pull the roots loosen up the ground so it could grow deeper and get a better hold oh i'm i'm praying today to say lord loosen up my ground oh church could you stand your feet and
