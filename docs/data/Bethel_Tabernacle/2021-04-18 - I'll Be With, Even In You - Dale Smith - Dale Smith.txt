just continue through the day lord with us and let every heart lord be blessed every need lord your presence will supply lord and is our needs are many lord but your bounty is great immeasurable lord and so we're just asking you now lord to draw from your inexhaustible resources today lord and meet every need lord according to thy riches in glory we pray in jesus name amen god bless you friends this morning if you have your bibles would like for you to go with me into saint john's gospel chapter 15 and we'll also uh cross over into chapter 17 as well just to make a couple of points before we go into our text i've had quite a bit of lengthy material and so i don't want to be lengthy but very studious with our time this morning in saint john chapter 15 and we want to read there verse 4. saint john 15 and verse 4 abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more than can ye except ye abide in me amen god bless the word this morning as you have your seats i'd like to look over also into 7 chapter 17 and there in verse 10 and jesus here in this is uh called the uh the the the intercessory prayer of the lord jesus he uh here is in this in the midst of this prayer one of our most cherished chapters of the bible because of the things that the lord references here do you believe that that the father heard the lord jesus's prayers do you believe that he answered those prayers well i have my bible says that he always amen hears him and so uh so we know that this prayer is god's own prayer for his church concerning the relationship between the son of god relationship as that he would have with his church and this was to sanctify all that would believe upon his name and that would hear the gospel of those that had preached it from the from the time of the disciples because he spoke he was praying there for the disciples and then he told them uh and so may this be the benefit of all the hearers of what these that i'm sanctified that when they go out and preach and when they preach the message to the people that they they also these hearers of the gospel that they also would be sanctified and so so these are scriptures that apply to you and i today in a very real way because we have believed the true report is that right in chapter 17 and verse 10 it says and all mine are thine and thine are mine and i am glorified when they come to church hello i'm glorified in them in them let's cross the page there in verse 20. it says neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one i want to title this this morning from a quote uh that is quoted many times by the prophet of god you won't find this in the king james bible but uh brother branham says i'll be with you even in you until the end of the world and so these are the scriptures that support that statement that brother branham makes even as paul made reference to melchizedek and different places in the bible concerning women's hair and things like this that these were not necessarily places you could go in the old testament to verify these things you just had to believe that god had sent a prophet in the form of paul and that what he said was of the lord and so peter then actually referred to the the teachings of paul as scripture and so we can also in this day refer to the thus saith the lord prophet of our day as not to add to the world but to amplify to to amplify the word of god that was already preached i want to uh start with a message in the token i thought that was striking that brother brad would say that it came up three times one to sing that song and it was the first quote that i had on my my uh my page so i think that's uh you know we just appreciate the lord leading us uh today now um first of all brother branham in throughout the message he begins to uh he takes this line of thought that says that that we cannot uh uh that we live by dead substance you remember the quote he said something uh has to die in order for you to live uh in a natural way something had to die whether it be uh you know the greens he said the greens had to die in order for you know if you eat the chicken the chicken had to die you eat the drink the milk the bacteria had to die something in order for you to live naturally something had to die naturally he said how much more is it that if something for us to live uh spiritually then there had to be something that would die for us spiritually not that jesus died in a spiritual sense but that when he died in a a as a human that his spirit was released and when that spirit was released when the blood cell broke brother brown said that when that blood cell broke when that spear pierced that original blood cell it released the power it released the power that contained christ into humanity and it released that power to come back upon the church on the day of pentecost and so brother branham from the message the token he makes this statement i thought this was just striking to me he said and if something has to die so you can live physically how much more is it something had to die so that we could live eternally and it's listen to this quote and it's by the substance of this death that i'm speaking on tonight that we are alive tonight he uses the phrase the substance of death and as for our subtitle this morning we'll speak on the substance of death and so if i were to have this morning a a corpse laying here in a coffin we've we've had a few here with us in the form of ashes or or in you know coffin form or whatever but we realize brother that says that that's not that person but that is just the body that they lived in and so i can i can i can assure you today that a a corpse is not the substance of death you see it is the it was the substance of a life but the substance that made that death alive was the spirit that was in that corpse and so when that spirit leaves that body it becomes a corpse but the substance of death what made that alive before was the spirit that was in it and so we realize that in the blood is what keeps your body alive but yet there's a spirit inside of that blood without that spirit you no longer exist and so we're looking at the substance of this death that i'm speaking on now uh brother brown tells us here he says now our sacrifice today not only an ordinary human being but it was god himself that was identified in flesh here upon the earth and when that blood cell broke not only did the soul of a man or a spirit of a man but god himself who was identified in that man returns back upon the believer in the baptism of the holy ghost or the holy spirit he says here that's the token that god requires today the token of today that we have today must be the holy spirit that's god's required token will prove it to you by the scriptures he goes on without the holy spirit you do you do not display the token that is the token shows that you have been identified yourself with the sacrifice and god has sent you back the token to show that you have been accepted until that is done no matter how good you are how much you know how a college professor a good person a preacher whatever it might be you are absolutely not recognized until you show that token amen and this token is what separated the children of god from the from the children of egypt this is what was the deciding factor it was it so drew a line of demarcation that that token had to be applied or they died like egypt died it didn't matter brother branham said if they could go in the back and prove that they were circumcised that they they could prove that they had the bitter herbs they could prove that they had the the lamb slain and it was roasted with fire they could cover all the bases all the way around they could have the blood in the bucket but if it was not on displayed they were not identified to the slaying angel that was coming through the land and they would have died like egypt died and may i say this morning amen that this morning if the blood is not on display in your life if the holy ghost is not amen emanating from you in every aspect of your life you'll die like atomic fodder in the united states when she's bombed you say oh brother dale you're trying to scare it no i'm trying to tell you the truth amen there's a token that is available today it was not available until the evening lights began to shine but those lights are shining here this morning and we can receive the baptism of the holy ghost which is the person of god himself coming down and dwelling in you and making you a new creature in christ jesus and if you're not new today then friend you'll perish with the world that's what the bible says amen well you help me i'll preach a little this morning by the way now uh he said this was going to separate and make a difference between those who were going out of egypt and those who were going to stay in egypt and perish with egypt it made the difference let me here to tell you this morning friends it's the holy ghost that makes the difference you say what makes you different today is it my religion it's the suit i wear you know is it the amount of money i have in my pocket so does that make the difference today is that is that what sets me apart the size of the square footage of my home the acreage of my property is that going to set me apart is that going to make me different it can't it can't i praise the new mexico just uh you know it's a little run down a little place anybody that's ever seen it knows it ain't nothing to you know he said well he's got land i got a junk pile you know it's just out there it's just somebody give it to me and i don't know what to do with it if anybody got little money wants to spend i'll make you a deal he can't refuse but but but from my back porch or from my side of my house there on the north side of my house i can look out on a clear day and i can see 18 miles i know that sounds like a long ways to y'all out here but out west we can see a ways that's why i like it out there but i can see 18 miles in one direction and on this top of the hill 18 miles away i can see the late jeffrey epstein's mansion now what makes a difference he's gone to his reward whatever that is i don't know he had more money he was a fortune 500 member i worked for him i knew him personally he had more money than you could shake a stick at two sticks he he could he could he had he had he had women he had homes in florida in the keys up in kentucky he had homes all over he had that great ranch out there in new mexico he had all that he had cars he had airplanes he had he had money that he didn't even know where it was and i had two nickels to rub together but let me tell you i would much rather have my two nickels amen than to be where he's at today what made the difference the token made the difference brother brand makes this statement he said did you ever stop to think this morning i put that in all caps this morning when you got up when you started your day tomorrow when you start your day yesterday when you started your day did you get up and stop to think what did you think about oh i gotta you know i gotta get i got 45 emails here i got to take care of i've got two or three texts i got to respond to oh my i got five missed calls i didn't get last night and i've got this and i've got that and i've got this and you stopped to think but what did you think about brother braham said did you ever stop to think this morning as far as returning that is it had to become visible he already he is already here with us now he someday now today just re imagine that his presence being here today did you ever stop to think that his presence is here that everything that you do in every aspect of your life that you are walking that you're believing that you're accepting the fact that you have to face his presence my bible says that every tongue shall confess and every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that jesus christ is lord that his presence is here among us and we'll confess it someday or we'll confess it today lord jesus is in another world or another dimension watch what he says right here today in form of spirit his spirit is blending with our spirit isn't that a comfort to you today isn't that a wonderful wonderful outstanding amen monumental thought today that if i stop and think this morning that that i'm just not here believing in a god that lives in an ethereal realm in another dimension but that that dimension is coming into this dimension and that his spirit is blending with my spirit brother donald to make me what i'm supposed to be because i can't be anything unless he makes me that because otherwise i just go by the way of my natural human nature animal it's been hybrid with with with the beast system all the way back in the garden of eden and so our our humanity has been polluted and so we'll go the way of the animal job said you'll die and you will be no different than a dog when he dies unless amen your spirit has blended with his spirit his spirit is blending in our spirit our eyes can't see him because they are physical yet unless there would something happen that we could see a vision but he is here just as visible just as real as he was the day that he spoke to mary at the grave mary mary mary magdalene or when he met cleopas on the road to emmaus his presence is here for you uh librarians and grammarly correct individuals this will be a little bit of a grind on you but it's from the the kentucky amplified bible brother brown says it can be filled with that amen have you ever feeled it i'd much rather have something i could field amen than some of this dry eyed starchy old dead religion i want something i can feel to brother aaron i i really do he said it can be filled with that felt with that inner charge brother jack if he got that inner charge this morning amen the inner charge that's on the inside of the human body called the new birth the soul has been magnetized into him and once in a while when you let your minds concentrate on him believing on him after a while something a real a reality that you can feel something sweep over your being that is the vindication of the resurrection amen i believe there's a lot of people walking dead people today they've never felt the vindication of a resurrection amen but i'm here to tell your friends they can throw my body in a hole in the ground and kick sod in my face and set a tombstone above it but that grave can't hold me why because i've been magnetized i've been supercharged i amen by the resurrection because i'm a super seed amen that's been here anointed amen by the super saiyan amen in this last days that's what i'm here to tell you this morning and i'm here to i'm here to announce to you today that that supercharge that magnetization amen that comes from the power of the token life upon your soul it'll change you it'll take away the desires it'll take away the fears amen it'll take away anything that upsets you amen it'll put your mind amen and focus to the things that are above and you'll cast aside the things of this world and the love of the world amen and you'll set your affections on things that are above hallelujah there is a requirement for identification we live in a day of identification you can't do anything you can't check your email you can't go to the bank you can't spend your plastic without some form of identification it has to verify that you are who you say that you are and why is that how can they just take my word for it well they could take my word for it i could handle my credit card or my visa debit i could say i want to withdraw you know you know some money out of this account well uh who are you well i'm my name's everett dale smith that's who's on the credit card well uh how do we know well because i said why would i lie to you i'm telling you the truth i am who i am just take a look at me and they say no no no no we've got to have something to certify something to verify that you are who you say you are and i ask you today are you a christian well absolutely well how do i know you've got to be certified you've got to be verified how are we going to do that well because i have the i took a lamb and i killed it and i put blood over the doorpost of my house that won't work for this day but there has to be a life on the inside of you and jesus said if the works that i do shall you do also why because he lives in there his spirit has blended with your spirit so now that when you've got a temper that wants to fight a buzzsaw when you can't do nothing but let your tongue flap on both ends and uh loose on both ends and flapping in the middle all the time and can't say nothing good about nobody well then i wonder you're going to need some more verification we're gonna need a birth certificate hello we're gonna we need to go back a little further than just your driver's license that can be forged you know we gotta we need to go back and we need to test your blood with your with your father to make sure that you're not some you know squatter that you're not just come in and and slipped in and have some form of of a fake identity maybe maybe this is some sort of a an identity uh forgery that we've got here are you a son amen of the father that you say that you are so there's a requirement for identification but the baby says that this blood being applied and identified worshiper identified him with the blood by applying it in his own house over the door where he could could not go out or come in without being recognized by the blood a very perfect type of today of the blood of jesus then the blood was the token of identification and christ is the token of identification to a believer today so we realize that christ now that is a misappropriated terminology it becomes just semantics to a lot of people oh that's christ and christ is you know jesus well let me who is jesus you see because jesus won't work for today the body of christ the body of the person of jesus christ because that body shed its blood the life went out of it the blood went back into the chemical elements of the earth but now there has to come that spirit that raised up christ from the dead if the biggest word in the bible it dwells in you then it now quickens you or gives life to or makes you identified with christ which the bible tells us that the the word was made flesh and dwelt among us so now we understand that christ is the revealed word of this day so if your life does not line up with the revealed word of this day a vindicated prophet that came in this day then you can you it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter what kind of documentation or church affiliation that you can produce you are lost friend you're you're you're you're you're deceived in your own uh your own imagination but when you can identify with the word that has been anointed and vindicated and backed up by thus saith the lord prophet in this last days oh then friends you can your life can stand there it doesn't matter what tides come against you what floods come against you amen what fire comes against you amen summed through the water amen amen summed through the floods some through the fire sun through great sorrow some through sickness death whatever it might be but all must come through the blood i want to quote from d.l moody this morning tremendous statement he says so moses finished the work we find in the scripture this bible says that after having done all to stand stand what does that say brother chris that says that when you've done everything that you can do to live for god then just stand and live for god you may stumble you may fail you may fail miserably but just build the temple do what you can do put your coat on tie your shoes huh come to church pay your tithes read the word that's something you can do that's all moses could do moses got a plan he stuck to the plan what's the plan this morning repent every one of you and be baptized every one of you in the name of the lord jesus christ you can do that and you shall be able to manufacture the holy ghost in your life and live for god from then on like brother brown said you might have got that from the old 80s farmer's almanac but you did not get that from the bible watch what moody says here he says so moses finished the work and then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the glory of the lord filled the tabernacle moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because the cloud abode thereon and the glory of the lord filled the tabernacle the moment that moses finished the work the moment that the tabernacle was ready the cloud came the shekinah glory came and filled it so that moses was not able to stand before the presence of the lord and i and i am echoing this morning the words of d.l moody he said i believe firmly that the moment that our hearts are emptied of pride and selfishness and ambition and self-seeking and everything that is contrary to god's law that the holy ghost will come and fill every corner of our hearts but if we are full of pride and conceit and ambition and self-seeking and pleasures of the world there is no room for the spirit of god and i believe many a man is praying to god to fill him when he is already filled with something else before we pray that god would fill us i believe we ought to pray that god would empty us out we find that the bible shows us that joshua the man tells us that he was a perfect type of the holy ghost and so here we have moses the revealed word of the day and as the reveal word of the day the bible says that moses was dead and that that commission then was handed over to joshua and so that joshua brother brahm tells us is a type of jesus which joshua means jehovah's savior and so does jesus mean jehovah's savior and joshua was true to the token sign that his messengers had preached under the first exodus as they come out and we're going into canaanland which is a type of the holy ghost it's not a type of heaven brother brown plainly tells us that canaan was not a type of heaven he said because there was killing and there was wars and so but it is a type of the holy ghost why because the holy ghost amen what happens when the holy ghost comes on is the killing amen and there's wars your wars don't even start until you get the holy ghost when the holy ghost comes then now then the devil it becomes your arch enemy and he wants to destroy anything and everything that you have anything to do with and so that becomes and then so then who is your number one enemy at that point is the carnal man and so now the carnal man becomes your greatest enemy and so that the holy ghost now the war is going on here in canaan land and so joshua is here to help us to come in and partake of the new corn of the land that's growing up in the new land there's the fresh messages that are coming forth and so that's what joshua is trying to get us to do to go on into the land to what to place us positionally within the land where that we are supposed to be now that was under the first exodus and brother brahm tells us that joshua was true to the token sign that his messengers had preached there's a lot a lot a lot of a lot of quotation of a place where brother ram said that those that those uh those uh messengers that joshua sent to jericho that there were a couple of tape boys well okay maybe there was but here brother evan said they was preachers so uh i'll go i'll i'll i could take it either way i play a tape or i can preach how do you want it but he said that he was true to the token sign that his messengers had preached in other words these two uh witnesses or these witnesses i don't know if it was two or more but whoever they were that they went into jericho to spy out the land they got there and nobody would hear what they had to say but this little harlot woman rahab and what did they do but they came preaching a true sign they came preaching a token message they began preaching that look we were brought out of egypt all of egypt died their firstborn was annihilated their armies died in the red sea and we're here to tell you this is what's going to happen to jericho here and not too many days and so you need to get ready and get the token applied to your life because destruction is coming run for your lives and so when when they preach this this one little harlot lady she she now embraces this teaching and so she goes give me a true token give me something that i can save my house with give me something that my old tired daddy can hold on to my my dear old decrepit mother that they can believe amen and be saved my children my grandchildren amen my sons and my daughters whoever it might be it was in my house there's got to be some way that we can apply a true token oh my think about it this morning friends amen and so the the the brother brown tells us he said but that that joshua was true to the token sign that these messengers had preached oh my think about it that the holy ghost of today will be true to the same gospel amen the token preachers are preaching this morning amen and so he said what is the token he said this cord that you're going to let us down with you just make sure this is hanging out the window you make sure this is on display because this is going to be your identification this is going to be your biometric signature hallelujah this is what is going to be amen that we're going to be we're going to identify this token with you and you are identified with us and so when this all takes place amen we're not going to know that this this is a a a direct uh uh identification this is your passport this is your passport to get a u.s passport the first thing you have to have i have a list of this i can put it up over there over the head but the first thing that you have to have is a a document let's see if i can do this without completely losing my notes this morning let's see yes requirements for a us passport first thing you have to have is a ds-11 application repent right yeah you have to have this and so this application is going to have your name your address your birth date your height weight you know the place you were born your mother her maiden name your father you're gonna have to have all this thing it has all this pertinent information that's about you the second thing that you have to have is that you have to have proof of your u.s citizenship such as a birth or naturalization certificate so you so so now then you've been given this by the us government whether it be at the hospital that you were born on or if you came through you know back in the day if you came through ellis island or whatever they would give you this naturalization documentation the next thing that you have to have is a government issued photo id such as driver's license or military id so now then now then it's going to come because they're going to tie all this pertinent information about you back to an image or a photograph that identifies you with this naturalization or this birth are you with me this morning are you at church or are you post office huh and then you have to have a color passport photo of a present tense image of yourself and so this is going to all this so that's your biometric signature that's your face it's biology all right this is your biology and it's going to match with this other pieces of document and then you're on your way to get a united states passport and you could go right down to washington d.c while go right in the u.s embassy you could go right up to the consulate of the united states of america and you could hand him this fully intact packet and he would look at you like a mule looking at a new gate and he'd say you're still missing something you say what i've got it all brother jack i've got it here it's there i got the photos i got the i got the documentation i've got the the ds-11 i've got i got everything there and i got every piece of it now come on give me my passport i'm going to get out of here i got to travel i'm going to leave in this world you said no you're missing something what 60 bucks there's got to be payment hallelujah you can have everything this morning but until there's payment there's proof that the price has been paid amen there's only one price that god will accept and that's the blood that is shed on calvary that's the purchase price that's a ransom for your soul the only way you're getting out of here amen is if somebody paid the price for you because you can't pay it yourself god don't accept your currency he only accepts a currency from heaven amen god he said i come from god and i go back to god under the second exodus this is my thought i just extrapolated this from the first quote that that that joshua was true to the token that the messengers had preached well then we have a second exodus so i injected this in the middle of the quote jesus preached a token message of i'll be with you even in you that was the token we read it there we could go on and read many other places about the comforter and i'll send the comforter in my name he'll lead god and reprove the world and he'll lead guide and direct you into all truth and bring into your remembrance of things that i have taught you this is what the holy ghost would do that he would identify himself with you and you with the father and you would be one in the word and so jesus preached the token message of i'll be with you even in you and he was true to the token message that his apostles preached on the day of pentecost from our text where he said there he says and neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word so jesus now had to be true to the token messengers or the token message that the apostles preached because he had already sanctified them and commissioned them to go into all the world and preach the gospel he had already sent them out to preach the word and to cast out devils and to lay hands on the sick he had already done these things and so jesus had to come back and back up or be true to the message that these messengers preached they went out and they went to the gate beautiful they said silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk now if he had not got up and walked then we would have a problem here because jesus said anything that you add are you with me this morning anything that you ask in my name i shall do it the father will back up whatever you say in my name they commanded the man to walk and he walked with peter laid hands on them and and and prayed for them and they received the holy ghost the the very works of christ were done in these disciples and so therefore jesus jehovah joshua of of of that second exodus that he stood behind the word that then men preached and brother madam goes on to say here in this this message so will jesus be true to the token sign that his messengers preached when he comes all under it was saved in egypt all under it was saved in jericho what about today so if i preach to you a true token today amen that if you repent and are baptized amen and receive that you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost that is a promise to you and to your children as many as as far off as our lord god shall ever call if i preach that to you and it happens and it has happened hallelujah when we when we can look around the world and see where god's gospel preachers have gone out and preached in the lands of far they've preached them here on the soil of north america we've gone into the south america we've been in the isles of the south pacific amen we've preached the same gospel and it's got the results amen the sick have been healed the lame have walked and the poor heard the gospel gladly amen what about today god will stand behind the truth now then if i came and preached to you that you could be baptized any old way we can sprinkle you if you didn't want to get cold you know we could you know we could splash a little water in your children's face and they wouldn't have to worry about the rest of their life and live like devils we could we could take you into a nice warm heated baptismal and get down there with you and baptize you in the father and the son and the holy ghost and we could go all these things and we could shake your hands up here at the altar and we could get you a book to sign well jesus don't stand behind that billy graham said i get i get uh confessions or uh commitments decisions or robert scott you know point of contact for thousands and thousands every time that he came into a city he said he'd come back the next year couldn't find thirty what was it brother the man said it's because they didn't take them on to the birth oh my from the easter seal brother says and it's so quick in their body till they couldn't even speak in an earthly language anymore it quickened their body to a heavenly language the place they're going to quickening power of god shook their mortals their mortal bodies so till their in entire mortal language was transfigured transformed into an immortal language what a quickening power something that belongs and so today many will hear me quote that quote and they will say well brother dale you're just trying to get us back to pentecostalism would to god that i could get some of you to live like old times is a street pentecostals because i've known a few and there's a there's a vast difference of what we see today and what was then i think god was more pleased with them but may i bring you to the 21st century could we come to 2021 what is today april 18. could we could we come to today because i can paint you a fire of a day gone by and well you just freeze to death it it won't do you a bit of good i can tell you about a heaven that's way in the future and you would die with hope but you would still die and probably go to hell so that's not going to help i got to tell you about today and so there's a quickening power and i'm not reading into this quote i'm not trying to make it say something that it's not because i believe that what brother brown was talking about was what happened on the day of pentecost that they came out of there where they were speaking every man in their own language and they heard them in their language from their nativity so they were all speaking galilean and they were hearing them in the grecian and the this and that and the other they heard them in the language from where they were from that was one form of this what brother brown was talking about here the quickening power paul later comes and says do we all speak in tongues well the answer was no we don't all but paul says but i do speak in tongues more than ye all so now then you said well brother dale you know tongues is such a controversial issue and that's why you're hearing me speak in tongues you need an interpreter when paul was with this he said but paul was a learned scholar we know in one point that he spoke to him in roman in another place he spoke to him in hebrew so we know for sure that he was actually bilingual and because he was traveled all through greece he probably spoke greek aramaic and maybe a couple others we don't know but he was a very learned scholar and there's no doubt that he could speak multiple language so he was by tri whatever lingual now but paul went on to say but there was tongues of men and tongues of angels and so according to the quote here brother braham says it quicken their language they're they say they're they're quick in their body to a heavenly language the place they're going to wow i thought my what what language was going to speak in heaven brother jason well i know the the brothers up in quebec they'll they'll argue with you right now it's french because the lord spoke to brother branham in french and interpreted it by two interpreters and that's they're they're done it's well it's a love language i'll go along with that you know french it is we we bonjour i'm trying to get there i'm trying to get there you know but he goes on to say here he says the place they're going to quickening power of god shook their mortal bodies till their entire mortal language was transfigured i just have to believe brother jason it means more than just pentecostal tongue talking i have to believe that it's it's a transfiguring of my entire mortal being well i know the language i used to speak and would none of you want to be around it but something happened when the quickening power came amen it began to wash my mouth it began to wash my mind it washed my heart amen things of the world they changed i started talking about thinking about amen looking forward to something of a world that i've never been to but sister deborah amen i'm home sick for a place where i've never been i want to go home i've got this desire ain't meant to be out of here and so i'm learning a language of the token i'm learning the language of melchizedek i'm learning the language amen of shalom i'm learning the language of the bride and the bridegroom hallelujah there's a language that you have with a man and his wife that can't be repeated in public hallelujah oh i call her things and i would not call her amen in public it would be a little bit embarrassing for a big former marine big tough you know redneck to you know to say some of the things that i say oh but she understands it and it moves her in imagine in her spirit oh and when i pray to my god and when he speaks his love language down into my soul amen it can't be repeated in this world it's going to take another one to translate it can you believe it this morning can you stand to your feet amen maybe god would speak to you this morning in that love language that says i love you with an everlasting love i love you in such a way that i want to draw you into my presence into the chamber amen where the sweet holy spirit can brood over your soul and change you amen and give you such a man a fantastic amen realization of his presence he said i'll be with you even in you can he speak to you this morning oh can he speak to your soul in such a way that will he change but really i'm a pretty good person you know i i do good i'm not talking about being a good person i'm talking about being jesus there's none good safe god i want you to just be good oh be good be as best as you can and stand and then let the cloud come that one that came amen that day and it filled oh after solomon had prayed he did all he could he built the timber the tamara it was a sight that was beyond our wildest imaginations he built it he overlaid it all with gold and jewels and and brass and oh it was just it was fantastic but it was just a monument and it was a testament to a rich man's desire but after he prayed and said if we'll just turn our hearts from our sins and look to god and pray the bible says that he'll hear from heaven don't you want him to hear from heaven today that if he could hear from heaven and send the cloud what if that that same cloud came down that came down when solomon prayed the bible says that the priests the priests could no longer minister the singers couldn't sing the trumpeters couldn't trump it amen they just had to say great is our god how great is how god oh sing with me how great [Music] is our god everybody now [Music] how great how great is our god sing it with me now oh how with your hands raised sing with me how great thou god and all will see how great in church sing it with all your hearts [Applause] for you you're worthy of all my praise my heart my heart will see how brave [Music] oh how great is [Music] [Music] let's lift it up he's the name above all [Music] names [Music] and my heart will sing hallelujah is he great today i think he's wonderful oh i think he's beyond great amen that that word almost pales in comparison to how amazing the lord is but jason i'm going to let you take sister bellow on around and brother matt by the jd are going to help get some things set up here y'all can be seated amen praise the lord we've got a baptism today and i just thought what a better witness uh to have what a better way to commemorate god dealing with someone for new birth than a sermon like we heard today wow my i i tell you that what is it how's it brother tim um burdette says that'll make a baptist shout amen praise the lord so we certainly enjoyed that today and every word you heard was true amen found it in god's word signed sealed and delivered by the holy spirit amen so we're going to be uh setting up here um just don't drop it on me there you go all right come around g there you go buddy yeah i'd have known they'd go for the biggest guy in the audience to get some help with amen praise the lord let me tell you a little bit of what's going on today give me just a moment brother andrew so i got a i got a text from brother jason here some time ago not too not too long ago maybe a few weeks ago and he just begins testifying to me about how that the lord had begun to inspire him to take some bible study lessons in his home uh with his family and you know and i don't i don't know what the schedule was and how how it went or how often it went or what the regularity or the schedule was in all of it but today you're going to witness the effect of a dad doing just that and that was it you know no angel showed up no thunder crack no lightning flashed this is just a dad saying i'm going to sit my kids down i'm going to tell them some stories out of the bible and just begin to witness to them from the scriptures and here is his family you know and they're listening and and god beginning to do wonderful things of restoration and healing and uh and so uh and i just i just want to say i don't i don't know i'm not here i'm not a doctor i'm not here to defy medical science but i don't know who told hannah she was dying i mean she looks like perfect health to me and i just said god's obviously doing something in this sister amen and and and just and i'm just believing that the word of god is healing to all her flesh is that what the bible says the word of god is health to all your flesh think about that there is did you know that the bible says there's a blessing just in reading it there's a blessing just hearing it read just hearing it read and so he he's just telling me all these testimonies and say wow that's awesome chase and then i i get a text you know some i don't know days or a week later and he says bella wants to be baptized i was like wait what what who what whoa timeout back up what are you saying yeah yeah he said i've been telling these bible studies in my home and said bella wants to be baptized and i said i almost have no words i mean to hear something like that if you were ever a pastor you'd realize that makes you want to blow through the roof and land out in the road so anytime you hear that regardless of of how it comes one soul is worth a thou ten thousand worlds and so so we we've been talking back and forth and you know she just wanted to continue to have her heart you know short up and and really determined in in in the progression of god dealing with her and we've been these number of weeks now and that one little thing would come up here there but i just believe god has things in perfect timing and so uh today is the day and i you know i wasn't i wasn't uh gonna be the minister and i thought and so i said hey you know so i'm not gonna be the minister but i'll do the baptism and oh it doesn't matter you know uh and so and i thought wow and then brother dale comes and preaches a sermon like that and i said i'm glad i wasn't the preacher i'm glad it was brother dale preaching today because i thought what a better way to make the word of god sure and true he didn't know what was going on until i told him right in the back right before he'd come out and so so i got a chance to uh talk to sister bella in the back and i said i haven't even hardly seen her here there at an event or whatever got to see a little bit yesterday at the wedding and uh so i wanted to talk to her and i sent him a text this morning i said now listen i want you to have her get up and read it's not long it's only four chapters and read the entire book of ruth he said okay i'll do it so she gets up and she comes to my back all this morning i said did you do your assigned reading yep and so said now let me tell you a story and we began reminiscing about uh i said you know bella it's interesting that you'd come uh to feel this way toward the lord because you in the in your own home you heard your dad telling you story and lessons and stories out of the bible i said i'm almost a carbon copy of that i said i grew up in my home and my mom was the bible storyteller and she was the bible teacher you know mothers are pastors and so and i said i mean i attended the branham tabernacle and we heard tapes all the time but you know as 9 10 11 12 year old kid a tape is is only going to have so much effect it has way more effect on me now but as a child the word and this message came alive by my mom telling me she'd tell he's amazing i'd be like that really happened and she's like yeah it's right in the bible right here it is and i i was blown away in my mind as a child and that's where i began to love the lord and desired to give away my life and take his life because that's really what the new birth is you know brother branham says he says you say well brother branham what is the new birth he said it is a revelation of jesus christ personally to you it's not about thunder and lightning and even speaking in tongues it's it's not about baptism it's about it's a revelation sovereignly given to you by a supernatural god and it's a revelation of himself in the which when you catch that revelation you look at yourself in the mirror of god's word and you decide very quickly and very easily now that i have a revelation of who he is i don't want to be me anymore i want to be him see that's what that is that's a new breath how new birth comes you get a revelation of him and you decide i like him better than me so i'm going to die and let him live see and so and but now can you imagine that the overwhelming majority of the of the world who get that revelation and god shows them for a moment who he really is and they look at christ and they go uh i'll pass i know i like my life i don't want to get i don't want it messed with and and and yet yet millions do that every day but then there's those times those as jesus said you know few there be that find it find that narrow way where they see a revelation and i was saying all this to the to the sister this morning everything i'm saying i was saying to her and you know what i could see it clicking i could see it was making sense to her i said bella that's what a new birth is i said it is a revelation and when you have seen christ in the word you don't want to be you and because that was her own testimony to me she said i don't want to be the person i've been i realize i'm not who i want to be and i realize i want to be like him not amazing and that is from a dad telling bible lessons in his home and and she says i don't want to be me anymore i said see bella that is a revelation of christ to you personally he's revealed who he is and you decide you want to be that more than you want to stay you you don't you're not one of those who loves the loves the pleasures of the world you're you're you're lovers of the world more than lovers of god see when god reveals himself but you love the world more you love yourself more you want to stay you you don't want to die and become him and i said see you're the exact opposite you've decided now that you've seen who he is you don't want to be you anymore she goes that's right and i said and i said now you read you read the book of ruth yep read it i said okay i said now here's the first thing you need to know bella you're ruth and i think she liked that that made her smile every time i'd say that she'd light up say you're ruth in the bible and she'd light up and smile and i said because i said ruth if you go back and you look and brother branham he pulled up old dr schofield out of his schofield bible brother brown pulled up dr schofield's four those four chapters and if you look in a school field bible if you've got one an old one at least under chapter one dr schofield calls that ruth deciding and then under chapter two it's it's got ruth serving and then under chapter three it's got ruth resting and under chapter four it's got ruth rewarded and so brother branham brings us out as a beautiful thought he says watch this now and he begins to say how that ruth you know she come the first thing she had to do was make a decision his brother dale was talking about today you know it's it's a sad reality that people only get half the picture they get a true picture but it's only half the story the the part they get that's real and necessary is that you have to decide and you have to say i believe jesus christ was the son of god who died for my sins and that's true you have to believe that and that should be your confession but that's not the whole story as brother branham brings out from dr schofield notice that what ruth when ruth decided i want that god to be my god but that meant that she had to turn away and say i no longer want and brother branham said she had to decide to abandon her old haunts abandon her old life abandon her old way see the the sad the sad truth that in modern 21st century christianity is all i need to do is make a mental decision about a historical occurrence and i believe he was the son of god and he was and i believe he died and he did and i believe he did it for me that's true but that's just a history lesson if you're not willing to decide to leave and so people don't don't have to change anything they can still keep their old haunts and old habits and old ways of life but i decided that he died for my sins and now i'm going to heaven and you're not no that's wrong that's not true that's not true you have to decide to leave the world behind like ruth did you have to leave your old be willing to leave your old life and i said then you see ruth what is she doing she's she begins serving she begins working in the field what is she doing she's proving her life worthy of the gospel and boaz because she's trying to attract boaz she needs marriage she can't save herself she can't redeem herself but she's got a kinsmen who can redeem her amen and that's what she's needing in life and bella's taking all this in and she's because she's just read it and she's seeing i said see bella that's where you are you're coming today to be baptized baptism's not going to save you the water doesn't do anything for you it's just a public testimony that you've made a decision that that jesus christ is for you and you're going to leave your old life behind and you're forsaking everything that was you and you want to become him she said that's correct that's exactly what she wants to do and i said now you can't change yourself but he can change you i said and then ruth had to go in and and and then she goes into the into the threshing floor in the middle of the night because you know to uncover his feet because that's a that's a an eastern way of of she's asking for marriage because she can't save herself but he can and so when he wakes up i mean that would normally be an alarming thing here in the middle of the night as a woman at my feet and but you'll notice what he said about her immediately he wasn't alarmed he said no no i know i know you're not that kind of a woman i know that everybody knows you're a virtuous woman you have proven that i've been watching you and he was and he was watching her and comes to the chief servant who's whose damsel is this this is the moabitess came back with naomi see just just like he needed a chief servant to identify ruth to the master in the days of in the days of uh of rebecca she comes off she says to eliezer who is this and he says oh that's my master. so god needed a chief servant to identify christ to the bride and the bride to christ and i said see she was a gentile bella that's you you're ruth and she smiled again and and i said now look what happened she goes back home and i said now what is she doing naomi says to her all right daughter you can rest i said see that's the holy ghost you're resting you've got the earnest he's already promised you i'm going to redeem you i'm going to go do it immediately and that's what he did on calvary he went according to his promise and redeemed us amen and so so i said so that is the rest bella of the holy ghost that you have you made a decision to leave the world behind you went to have him be your god you showed your life you showed your heart was sincere before god you you proved that you were ready to be a virtuous woman i said now with ruth this this took days and weeks and months and months all the way to harvest i said but but that's just the type you don't have to wait days and weeks and months i said bella for you all it is is your heart has made that decision and you can't change yourself but you're asking him to change you and you want to be changed and you want to be a new person i said now when he sees that in your heart don't worry you'll get the rest i said you have the holy spirit you need and it'll take over your life and today will be your baptism your very first act as a believer very first act of obedience that we are commanded to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost i said it's not hard to get bella the holy ghost is not hard to get the new birth is not hard to achieve they're one in the same thing i said all it takes is a completely honest sincere heart who holds nothing back and and wants none of herself and wants all of god and i said don't worry he'll come in and when he comes in he'll take care of all your life from that way from that day forward you won't have to struggle i said where people struggle for years sometimes is they come to an altar and repent but they don't give up everything they don't really repent of everything they like there's certain things in their life they want to hang on to and the lord simply won't seal that car there ain't no way he's not going to grant the holy ghost to that kind of a person and they're going to have to go months and sometimes years be put through the ringer until they're finally ready to fully surrender then god says all right now now we'll now we'll bring him to this position so i said then then bella look what happened then she got rewarded she got married she got redeemed she had a child and that child was obed who then had jesse who then had david who then 14 generations to jesus christ i said literally she had no inheritance she started with zero and gained everything see and i said i said now you remember the old the other guy who who boaz said now he's closer to me so i got to give him he's got first rider refusal she said yeah i remember that i said see that was the devil because he's closer because you were born in sin two-thirds of you is still still this body and this spirit are still unredeemed the new birth is only in my soul it's changed my nature and the resurrection will give me the new body that i need amen but my heart has forced this body to live according to god's standards because the soul will cannot be comfortable in the world anymore that's the new birth your heart has been changed and that begins to manifest in your body that's how you know you've passed from death unto life see and and so i and so i said you remember that guy and he first said excuse me he first said okay i'll i'll buy i'll redeem naomi and boy says okay well you need to know that if you redeem naomi because that's the old testament church you've also got to take the new testament and that's ruth and you've got to raise up children to her dead husband and he he said i can't do that because it'll mar my own inheritance which is a sensible thing to say if you've got limited resources but so so he didn't have the money because if he raised up children to her then now they're saturating his inheritance and then they're going to have children then they're going to have children and they're going to have children and by the time and he can't afford to pay for all that so a man with limited resources it's a sensible thing to say no i can't do it i can't afford it but but but boaz had money to burn boaz was filthy rich boaz could pay for naomi and ruth and the kids and the grandkids and the great grandkids and he he he would never he was the only one rich enough to afford a never-ending kingdom amen the only one who could who could say of the of the increase of this kingdom there shall be no end christ i said see that's christ christ is the only one i said the other the other guy what could he give you listen young people what can the other guy give you you know he can give you fortune and glory wealth and fame put you on a red carpet make you a youtube sensation but you know what happens he can't give you eternal life when you die that's all for naught it's all gone you got nothing see he can't give you eternal life he can't give you a body not made with hands eternal in the heavens he can't do that only boaz can do that see this guy doesn't have enough funds to do that and i said i said he i said you know so he so the best he can do is kind of give you a little bit of an insulated life with wealth and riches and kind of insulate but it's still going to be true that a man that's born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble so all he can do is give you a little bit of insulation and then you're still then what then what are you going to have what are you going to have see i said but christ can give you a body not made with hands eternal in the heavens give you eternal life eternal joy eternal happiness and all and all he says is serve me in this life and you'll inherit the one coming amen and i said and that's the decision that ruth made and i said bella and i told her for the third time i said your ruth when you go out here today and you sit in the church and hear brother dale preaching i said you disremember your ruth in the bible and uh that took a smile that we couldn't get to go away so amen i want you to pray for her as we baptize and we're going to believe that the lord is beginning in her from her sincere heart the lord is beginning a whole new life amen matt i don't i'm not wired up so i'm going to take this one and i promise not to drop it in the tank amen praise the lord this one's working so it's uh keep me right here also so it's a it's a great privilege to me um i've known bella since the day she was born amen and dedicated to the lord and so it's fitting to see god bring this full circle amen praise the lord you're going to help me come on man i just wanted to oh you want to say something well just a little clarification i wish that was the case uh that bella chose to get baptized because i was given bible studies but you were given bible studies no no no the reason why i started those bible studies is because bella came to me wanting to be baptized nothing like that about that big you know so that's why that started wow praise the lord amen amen here here here's what i know that was then this is now and here we are amen so amen oh i see i still don't have a handle here to save my life in case i fall amen all right fella you come stand right here honey and um it should be a little bit warm i think brother john's going to put a little warm water in it for you step downtown is it okay yeah oh you're good yeah now so go another step in and i asked her how old she was when she i said you're like what nine or ten she's not 14. i said my goodness how is this even possible and i just guess time is flying and uh we must be having fun right and so we're happy here today i see a whole tribe of her cousins back there who wanted to be here today for this happy occasion and uh come on man you're going to come down here and help me yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah this is going to be awesome and um and so bella what we're going to do is we know in the bible that when when those men on the day of pentecost they were concerned that they had because they had crucified the christ and that's pretty concerning and they really had no remedy for it because they couldn't bring him back out of the tomb what they didn't know he was already out of the tomb and peter told them he says now listen what you did yeah you really did it but you did it by determinant counsel in other words there was preachers you were under misinterpreted theology they told you to kill him and you did but don't worry because the grave couldn't hold him that god has raised him up and has made that same jesus who you crucified both lord and christ so it's okay he he's still willing to love you and save you and now you're going to make me cry and dad crying when i was all crying villa and so so so when they said well well what what can we do peter said here's all you need to do repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you will be filled with the holy ghost amen amen i better stop talking because we're all going to fall apart here so that's what we're here to do today bella we're going to put you this is just symbolism because remember jesus got buried and then he rose so we put you down we bring you straight out and we do it in his name because you know when a wife marries a husband she takes his name so you're becoming the bride of christ you're going to take the name of jesus in baptism you're identifying yourself with his death and burial and resurrection see amen so you'll come turn around and just sit down just sit down right there and you can just sit right down and all we're going to do is put you straight back and i'll take your head back here and dad can hold your arm you can put one hand over your nose if you want to uh so you'll be good and we'll put you all the way under and then we'll bring you all the way back up all right let's pray friends master this young lady weeping lord just hearing the story just hearing the story of the bible her heart breaking and sobbing and crying this is weeping her way to calvary lord take her young heart right now fill her with your life lord god these closing scenes of history the earth almost ready to pass away into a new world and she wants to be a part of that new world lord she doesn't want to be here with this world she doesn't want to identify with it anymore she wants a new life in christ granite lord come occupy her soul drive out all unbelief oh god may from this day in this hour may she begin to walk in the newness of life we commit it to you lord as we baptize her in your name in the name of jesus christ we pray amen sister bella with great pleasure your dad and i baptize you in the name of the lord amen amen hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord yeah yeah [Music] amen praise the lord sister hannah was adding a mom's part she said hey he talked about the bible all the time so amen so we get the balance of the story today amen but i'm going to tell you something friends there is nothing like turning the word of god loose in your home you turn the word of god loose in your home miracles start happening lives get changed people get healed the deading the dead and sin and trespasses are made alive in christ amen praise the lord sing a couple songs for us brother bradley and let's stand back to our feet rejoice a little bit for the great things god has done
