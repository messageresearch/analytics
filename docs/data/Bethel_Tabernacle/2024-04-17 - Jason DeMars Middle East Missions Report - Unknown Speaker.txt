will be faithful you are all your promises are yes anden all your [Music] promises amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen let's turn in the scripture uh right away to Isaiah chapter 19 and going to give a a missionary report this evening so we can all just relax and the the greatest danger that you'll face tonight is that the Lord will tell you to you to go on a missions trip so right sister Rachel amen so uh Isaiah 19 and verse 1 through3 and then we'll read a little bit more towards the end of the chapter the burden of Egypt behold the Lord rideth upon a swift cloud and shall come into Egypt and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence and the Heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it and I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians and they shall fight everyone against his brother and everyone against his neighbor City against City and Kingdom against Kingdom and the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof and I will destroy the council thereof and they shall seek to the idols and to the Charmers and to them that have familiar spirits and to the Wizards all right then skip forward I believe to yeah verse verse 19 uh in that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt and a pillar at the border thereof to the Lord and it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt for they shall cry unto the Lord because of the oppressors and he shall send them a savior and a great one and he shall deliver them and the Lord shall be known to Egypt and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day and shall do sacrifice and oblation yeay they shall vow a vow unto the Lord and perform it and the Lord shall Smite Egypt he shall Smite and heal it and they shall return even to the Lord and he shall be entreated of them and shall heal them let's pray Heavenly Father we come before you Lord and we ask for your just Holy Spirit to be Sovereign over each heart and each mind Lord that as we go through the reports and speak about what you have done Lord we ask that you would be glorified and magnified and lifted up father we commit ourselves and our time in the word and fellowship together tonight into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name amen brother Josh wake up amen so um as we get that up just a little explanation of that scripture um I'm not trying to say that my trip was that I'm trying to point out that God has a plan for Egypt for Egyptians and of course uh we know we we know many things about God's plan for Israel as well U there's also many things that we that are mysterious that are uh difficult to understand and we don't can't piece it together you know brother Branham makes it clear that the two witnesses are the ones that call the 144,000 but he also says in the church ages book just as the Jews brought the gospel to the Gentiles the Gentiles will bring the gospel back to the Jews again I I'm just here being obedient so I'm not trying to make something anything of myself um but I do believe that the Lord has a plan yes amen and he has a purpose and that he's moving uh for some purpose I think all we can say usually Brother Brad when we go and preach somewhere you know some someone else might look from the outside and say my that was wonderful we just say I I'm just here I'm just doing what the Lord asked me to do thank you um and uh trying trying my best to remain humble and usable um in his hands amen you know that's the that's the the worst thing that you can do is get proud and lifted up and try to elevate yourself to be something special um we're just Servants of the Lord and whatever we can do to serve him and serve his people we're ready to go to whatever land L that is that he calls us to do even even that's nothing even if that's stay home and serve your family we're ready to do that amen all right got on a plane from Atlanta went to Charles de gal had a lay over there and flew into Tel Aviv got in there um it was weird because the airport was very quiet of course we know why there's war going on in in Israel right now um so very quick quickly got through customs and everything and it was it was easy um um just got to remind myself not to do certain things if everybody remembers from last time but met the brother there in his hometown uh that's how I'm going to put that and uh got to fellowship with him we went out this is just my marker to remind me we went out for dinner and fellowship with him and I don't have his picture because he wants to remain as Anonymous as possible because in Israel they have their their herid um uh Orthodox Jews are extremely anti-missionary anti- um uh uh EV EV anti-christian let's just put it that way and they they they hate Christians they hate Jesus so and they're they're ready they're ready to expose every everyone a missionary that we that all of us know um was exposed by them and has had difficulty because because of that but make no mistake we're not there to try to call the 144,000 we're not there to do Mass evangelism we're there to be obedient to the Lord and serve God's people however that turns out um it's in his hands I believe God works sovereignly when I go I don't feel pressure to perform or be great or anything I'm just here Lord use me for your purpose accomplish what you want want to accomplish and um first so the first night we went out and had fellowship and discussed the trip and discussed their life since the the um the war started I was surprised in the area that he lives in is is a ways away from I mean it's funny aways away two and a half hours from the Gaza Strip but far enough to where I I other than the fact that there was no tourists I didn't see any sign of of War there in U in Israel um even even going into Galilee and going past some of the um uh Air Force bases I didn't I didn't even see a fighter jet I see more fighter jets here than I did did there which was surprising the the main thing I only saw was that blimp if you remember the big white blimp they had it was was way up in the air that they used that to triangulate things with the uh David sling and the Iron Dome in order to shoot anything down coming from the north and from from Lebanon and from Syria so the other thing that was interesting when I when I went to uh the the next morning we got up somewhat early and we went up to hia to try to get into see um Elijah's cave um it's it's like a monastery now of course like anything else it's becomes a Catholic church it's either a Jewish place which then they let you get in or it's a Catholic place and then it's it's hit or miss and today was the day that that I was there in hia it was uh the after Friday afternoon which means everything's starting to shut down for Shabbat and so we couldn't get in there but we had a a very uh long hike down to get to the place and then we had to hike back up after that after not seeing anything so but what was interesting was as soon as we got to hia it said I was in Beirut Lebanon at the airport and the reason for that is in Israel in the north and in the South they scramble the GPS so unless you're unless you you should start your your directions when you're on Wi-Fi otherwise you'll be all mixed up and even even sometimes it would it would bounce you to say you have to drive from Lebanon to wherever you are I'm like thank the Lord I'm not in Lebanon um and I I they started doing that even now in in even in central Israel in in Jerusalem Tel Aviv and so forth so um there's the skyline of hia um up above it and then in if you can see in the distance there's sort of like a hill mountain range in the far far distance right at the top of that Hill is the Lebanon border I would say it's about 30 miles from where I'm standing amen right there and we had a youth meeting I got myself a little bit out of order here that's all right this was our Sunday afternoon service brother Jason this is Brother Sergey he had a picture of himself with you and uh brother Eugene uh in Ukraine that's where he's originally from and has since moved to I think it's probably 10 years ago something like that or maybe even more yeah um and so he has a little Church of of Russians and Jews in his home and he asked me to minister the afternoon service on Shabbat and uh had fellowship with them and just a simple humble people it's it's uh Russians can be a little quiet to preach to sometimes but uh they led the word amen and they're they're they're they were really uh focused we had a youth meeting on the Friday night um of Shabbat and I ministered there on freedom and it was interesting because I I was all day I was struggling with my subject with them and I just I couldn't I couldn't get a hold of what I was supposed to speak to them about and I I get in get in we get into the their Church there and I pull up and I just I I had nothing and finally finally it just it as we were about to start pulled pulled it up and Minister on freedom I had a a sermon for youth on freedom and uh told me afterwards is it really it's a it's a message about you know Satan offers you freedom but what is freedom and you know what Satan offers is his lordship Christ offers his lordship which produces true freedom because you could live the way God has designed you to live versus Satan's lordship which is purports to be free but actually brings destruction pain sorrow suffering and so it's SP spent quite a bit of time on that and after the service he's like I don't even he's like I don't really know what to say other than the fact that you couldn't have if you would have known everything that was happening here you wouldn't have designed a a a sermon so perfect for what some of the young people are going going through here um then we answered a bunch of questions there and unfortunately you could tell that there was some that there was real unbelief going on in some of the question questions and I I found it interesting because from this meeting there was two young young people that were really struggling and they were feeding off each other and really you know hurting hurting one another yeah with with unbelief and very strange different questions that you would imagine ever getting but from a Jewish perspective they live in a herid community very radical Jewish group and some of the questions are like well what's the what's the what's the significance and the purpose of the New Testament and you go have you read the New Testament before it's it's not a question that you would ever get usually from our perspective you hear what's the validity of the Old Testament what's the point of that and so of course went through and answered as best I could and some questions about some past traumas that they had so I spoke some about the dangers of psychology and what it offers and and the you know the Bible shows us that there's deliverance and if we we obey God's word every everything that psychology offers is actually a counterfeit to God's word and every aspect of it you know you have a you have I won't get I won't go into it you can listen to my podcast coming out in a couple weeks that's going to go into details about it but into what just like again what he's like that girl asked me those questions last week and I I gave her some answers but you went you she didn't even tell you what was going on she just asked the question and you went directly to what she was dealing with and so between these two young people one person decided you know I'm just going to go to the world I'm done the other one came forward the next Sunday or the next uh Shabbat service and repented and asked to be prayed for to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost so I was so thankful to hear that another brother that I had I dealt with and and the brother over there had been dealing with uh came and said he felt the calling of the Lord to begin Ministry there and out and and Outreach there brother there so just very thankful for for how the Lord worked and the next day we were blessed to be able to go have a picnic and go fishing on the Sea of Galilee with the with some of the Believers there and that was wonderful it was very peaceful most of the time except for the part where an Arab guy had his um pop Arab music playing and then it was the most annoying thing I've ever heard in my entire life but other than that it was very peaceful we we asked him to turn it down and he would turn it down for 5 minutes and then Crank It Up And when I say loud I mean we were a long ways away and it was like I had airpods in um yeah the and the next day I felt to speak on overcoming depression I don't think I have any pictures from that service there but then and same thing quite a number of the Believers in the church came to their pastor and said you know know he was dealing with exactly what I was have been going through and and the struggles that I have there um it's a it's a multicultural Church there that um sister Deb brother Travis um my wife brother Matt sister Rachel know by being there that um there's there's Filipino and African and Jewish and Russian and Ukrainian and other other believers there this time there was a brother uh many of the Africans there that they they work in um and again I wish I had pictures of these brothers I didn't I didn't get any at the time but a number of them work in farmwork they're they got like a 5-year visa to come work on farmwork and they their family is there so there's people from Malawi zomia Kenya Ghana and so forth um there and just got a chance to meet one brother he he literally lives and works right on the edge of the Gaza Strip in fact right next to one of the towns that was attacked on October 7th he was there when it when it happened didn't didn't uh he didn't he didn't uh have any troubles when he was there but um he he works there in a plant every every day and some other believers work up in the north along all those towns have been evacuated but the Farms are there and so some of the Believers are working on those Farms next to the Lebanon border all right got got a little bit of History uh enrichment in we went to be Sheen and if anybody if anybody knows the significance of beit Sheen I will uh run a lap around the a church because you do never mind I'll do it afterwards Matt I don't want to interrupt the service what's the significance Saul Saul and Jonathan's bodies were hung on the wall at be Sheen and so we we got to go there and it's a incredibly well preserved um Roman and bizantine city um this is probably the best preserved Amphitheater in all of the Roman Empire that they have their I think I can't remember I think it's seed like 4,000 or something like that and it's like it's like uh the one in um uh cesaria By the Sea where you can go stand in the bottom and just speak quietly and you can hear anywhere up on the top the the Acoustics are just incredible that's that's from the big hill overlooking the city a little tough to see but uh um beautiful mosaics there that's a lion design then I got to go see the Gideon's cave where everyone where they separated the the the Army based on how they drank the water got to see that spring in the cave there so that was pretty cool and then I think the next next day um a lot of what I did on this uh the last part when I was in Israel was just spend time with the pastor and his family and and fellowship with them and talk with them that you know it's it's a lonely walk that they have that the Lord has led him to and so um just tried to encourage them over there and the brother and I went up to AKO and beautiful city it's the old uh uh City Paul Paul uh went out of there on his on his way to Rome and encouraged Believers that were living in this town it was called uh something else back then but um it also became a crusader City so I don't know if the video is going to play no it's not videos aren't working so this was like can you press play from your end not coming up no well you can go to my Instagram and watch the video there uh and then so the next day it's just crazy so look look how close Tel Aviv is to Cairo it's just barely off the screen there um Travis knows it's just like an hour flight between t Eve but because of the war a lot of the main uh Arab Nations have cancelled their normal uh flight between uh Tel Aviv and there so I had to take some a cheaper Airline all the way over to Dubai and then all the way back it was a 19 hour day to do that which normally would have taken about 3 hours so I was uh not fun I got to enjoy Dubai all by myself they had nice restaurants and a lot of really nice Filipino people working in them after getting into Egypt um spent a few days in Cairo had fellowship with brother megali he has started his new little church there in a new community and uh has a lot of uh poor people coming to the church now and he's he's working with them to help introduce them to the message he has a number of you see the uh African people there he's got a number of Sudanese people coming to the church that live in this uh poor Christian neighborhood if you're not familiar um all across Egypt there is a a pretty decent sized population of Christians that live there you know most people think of an Arab nation and um the Muslims have basically converted or killed all the Christians that's the case in most of them but in Egypt they had a a very large um contingent of Christians and it's disputed about what percentage it is because what percentage affects uh their numbers in Parliament and so they say they used to say like 5% of the country was um Coptic Christian which is it's very funny it's it's probably more like 30 to 40% but they suppress those numbers because they don't want to have 40% of their Parliament made up of Christians it would be a problem big problem for them so um this this neighborhood we went into and uh again just they're very simple poor humble people this is the church that brother megal got into so much trouble for if you remember um and what he's what he's facing now he was able to get after I left he was able to get a visa and he's in uh Germany now he's going to spend some time there and in Norway ministering and uh um out of the country for a few months so his lawyer can kind of take care of the uh jail time issue that he was going to have so I think that should be no issue and he should be able to be back in Egypt by the end of June usually brother megaly translates for me but if we have a conference or if he's able to brother George his son translates for me who has gone to an English speaking school since he's very young so he's he's extremely fluent and a very gifted translator pray for him that the Lord would just would really I would just say give him the baptism of the Holy Ghost because he's he's a really gifted person gifted personality and be very useful for the kingdom of God if he would surrender and uh some Believers there that brother megal is next to me and then brother Mina sorry uh Mina because in Egypt it's a boy's name it was funny I was uh just doing some introductions at the beginning of the service and talking about my family and I said I'm I said just so everyone knows here in the rest of the world Mina is a girl's name and so I told my daughter that Mina is a boy's name in Egypt she says I never dad I never want to go to Egypt and they got a kick out of that they were just as shocked as I was that Mina is a girl's name elsewhere and so this is Brother Mina and uh sincere brother loves the message and is learning learning it and growing in it brother megali and I outside of one of the churches there um I this is I had a little bit of experience with it but this is really my first experience with African roads and um it's interesting for sure I don't know why they even try to pave them because the paving makes it worse the road and then it just breaks up and so it's just it's a giant pothole it's not a pothole it's just a the whole Road as a pothole and by the time you're done you're not sure if some of your internal organs have detached or not so this is one of those little areas that we went into um this is like this is the this is the center area between two lanes of traffic traffic and and I I think sewage and water and that's where all the garbage goes so this is the pastor at the first uh church that I ministered at and uh this was like on the outsides of outskirts of Cairo and ministered on water baptism there just to give a little background to this group um brother megal has become friends with this Pentecostal denomination they've got an they've got the Assemblies of God there that's a whole other story but um this group this denomination broke off from the Assemblies of God because of tongues um they they didn't agree that tongues was the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost so they separated but they're Pentecostal and first place I ministered I felt on my heart to speak about water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and uh I could tell the pastor was a little bit shocked about it and after the service we prayed for some sick people and people that wanted children and and uh hit the road back to the hotel on the way I could tell brother megaly and this guy were uh in a disagreement over something and uh I asked brother megaly what's going on he said well first he said that uh water why is he preaching on baptism in the name of Jesus Christ I said oh uh was it unscriptural brother megal asked him was it unscriptural uh no everything that was was said was in the Bible he said hm okay so um which is right the Bible or the Pentecostal church and he the brother said the Bible's right a few days later down the road we got a call from the their Bishop who lives in Germany said this guy this guy called me and was complaining about what brother Jason was preaching on in the in the uh church and he's like oh yeah what' you tell him he said I asked him it was anything that he said outside of the Bible and the pastor told him no and the the bishop said then what's the problem so I was surprised by that this this brother in Germany I call call the Bishop they're just call him the manager of the denomination he's like the president of their board or whatever he he he know he lives near bebber and has a Pentecostal Church near bebber and he knows brother gird ravald very well brother gird has actually had him translate uh building stones into Arabic in the past and um so he's been introduced to the message and he's told Brother megali that's good for you it's not for me but I support you in it and I appreciate you I appreciate much of it I think maybe he's a little bit stuck I'm not sure we'll see what happens but after that of course this sends a stir amongst everybody about preaching on water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but um after that the next Services we had um we went down to the let's see there we go we went from Cairo down to the city of assut in what they call Upper Egypt I was very confused Upper Egypt why are we going south to go to Upper Egypt and um uh again there's a video unfortunately it's not going to play that's brother megaly saying we're going down to Upper Egypt and going to be visiting 10 churches so there you go Lower Egypt is the North Upper Egypt is the South and there's a very simple reason for that is the Nile comes from the south to the north so it's that's why it is called Upper Egypt and of course most of Upper Egypt is Desert most of Egypt is desert but right along the river it's very very fertile it's dusty it's dirty but it's very fertile ground and again I had a nice video that everybody could see the Sahara Desert go to my Instagram Channel and find it we we when we started we went first to uh the Lilian Trasher uh orphanage how many are familiar with lilan Trasher how many of you have Amazon how many of you are going to go on and Order her testimony tonight get her testimony she she uh those those um books Heroes of the faith for young for young children um she is one of the testimonies and it's it's tremendous how the Lord led her and dealt with her she was very significant in bringing uh the Assemblies of God Church she started out in Holiness movement when she moved there and when auza Street struck she she she accepted some missionaries that came from auza Street and helped with them bringing Pentecost to Egypt um we'll talk a little bit more about that but it's a wonderful testimony look look her up Lillian Trasher she's actually born in Jacksonville so this is common this was the outside this is someone's little farming Hut uh right next to the area we were dropped off for the first church that I preached at in Upper Egypt and uh it was a I was really shocked and surprised and blessed by the opportunity to go and see these churches there's 65 of these Pentecostal churches that have opened the door to myself and brother megal and I ministered at 10 of them and they were very very very happy to have us I felt every every time I had many messages prepared shorter ones to go with translators and of course you're dealing with people that are not used to an hourlong message for sure um so even more condensed but almost every single place that I went to I felt to preach on the the book of Acts the pattern and preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the supernatural power of God Miracles gifts healing and gave my testimony about being healed from Co and some other Supernatural testimonies from my life and uh within that gave a very basic introduction of brother Branham and him being a prophet and then after service we prayed for the sick and handed out books of brother brandham we brought several thousand books we left all left them all with people and you see there you start to see some of the the the the way that they dress there in Upper Egypt it's so strange to to see them uh but incredibly sincere hungry people um you know on on on the one hand you'll see them they they're dressed like it's 1820 then they whip out their big old self cell phone and they're talking on it taking pictures of you you're like this is what planet am I on here I thought I went back in time and now I'm right back in the 21st century the first night I uh that we had a prayer line and everyone came through I think the entire church went through for prayer everyone made their request known by the time it was done I said if I do this nine more times I will literally die there's got to I've got to there's something else because they're all hard workers these are farming people they they Farm they work on their equipment which is not much usually their equipment is a donkey and a cart and they work on their homes so they every every every man comes forward has a bad back has an injured leg has a bad hip uh needy people see this very common young people old people with the turban and the long uh uh tunic or I don't know what you call it at the end the the pastor asked all the children to come forward to be prayed for and uh he testified afterwards he's like when when you were praying for the children I felt the power of God come come down into the service just so strong he began to weep and we we always brought we always grabbed somebody from the church to get the books out of the back of the van bring them in and then they distributed them for us after the service usually while we prayed for the sick say Pastor Sammy there was so enthusiastic really appreciate him and uh again you're going to have to go to Instagram and see my bumpy Drive the brothers that have gone to Africa already know know about that I was hearing stories from Brother Matt that brother Jason could just sleep through all of it no problem and I was thinking there's no there's not even a 1% chance that I could fall asleep my whole body my head my brain is rattling around in my my head and it's like at your brace just like this the whole time and if you're not you're just going to like this so God bless you brother Jason I want some of that to rub off on me this was one of the churches there when we drove up you could see from a long ways away that they had a really high steeple and it blew me away because I know that these are the men here that built that church and put that steeple 150 ft in the air it's just like and I'm sure they didn't do it with a lift lift and I'm sure they didn't even do it with a very good ladder and I I don't I'm horrible at estimating amounts but brother megaly thought there was 400 people in the church their men and women and you could see I asked brother megaly I said why are the some of the women sisters dressed like americ Americans and why are some of them dressed traditionally and he said well the ones that have money try to dress like dress like handing out books for us at the end of service this so struck me this man got the book and started read reading the front cover it's the one with the cloud uh picture of the cloud on it and he actually took it and he kissed the book and was just staring staring at it like he was so excited Pastor there at that church that was the Sunday morning service was at the previous church and then the Sunday evening uh this was the uh Chapel at the um at the orphanage so these are the orphans there's probably like 200 220 230 orphans there and like 100 staff or so the the uh orphanage is supported by Assemblies of God around the world um brother the reason why the door was open to us is they usually don't if you're not you know showing your Assemblies of God Fellowship car you ain't going to be going in there and ministering to the people but brother megal grew up there when he was a little boy um his when he when he was born his mom passed away and his father didn't know what to do with him and so a relative came his father basically in in uh in Upper Egypt the way they cook a lot of times is they have what we would think of as like a pizza oven it's a it's a big oven like this made out of clay and they have an opening so it's quite open he just put it he wasn't cooking but he just put his son in the oven and just left him there brother the megal and so a relative came over heard heard him crying and said there's just a there's just an orphanage down the road I'll take him there he said fine so brought him brought him there and he was raised there and uh met his wife and and got married and he actually hasn't been back he's in his 50s he hasn't been back since he was 19 years old when he left the orphanage so I had mentioned to him is there any way we could visit that Lilian Trasher orphanage and he he he made some calls and they said yeah because you grew up here the door is open to you and to your friend and so we came and I ministered to the kids about um fighting against depression and I told my testimony about being healed from covid and uh spent time fellowshipping with the the the chap their chaplain or their P the pastor of the the orphanage and uh they after I spoke they brought me up and gave me some books about Lilian Trasher and some little presents there and a picture with a description of of her life and testimony and about the orphanage gave out some candy to the kids but the uh I think I have a picture of myself with the chaplain see him it's just wonderful to be able to do that and give candy to all the kids and of course the staff was eager to get some American candy 2 um I don't have a picture of him but at the at the orphanage on on the Monday morning we woke up and uh they wanted me to come and have breakfast with the staff as we're walking into the breakfast he's like we're just we're going to have some devotions will you take like a half an hour to have a devotion and I was like sure that was a little quick but fine we'll do it and uh then they gave us a tour of the of there and they've got like um from babies all the way up to even 20-year-old um kids that are they're still training them for uh work and so forth but then beyond that is there's a lot of um orphan women that decided they would give their lives to taking care of the orphans just the same way lilan Trasher did and so then then there's a group of very very elderly women that live there and have to be taken care of by the orphanage they they take care of widows and orphans but these women are they were orphans and they never got married so they're quite old so blind there was blind women and there was you know very sick women the pastor took me each one to offer a word of encouragement and and and pray for them and it's a great experience but the he said he the door was open to us anytime we wanted to come he would he would be glad to have me come and Minister uh anytime there so that was a that was a blessing to have that open door we handed out books of brother brandham to all the kids there and all the staff and to the the um their their chaplain as well so see how that goes I wish I could have gotten a better picture of this but just passing him in the car this is uh uh he's on a he's on a donkey he's on a cart with that there and the there's a donkey carrying it this was typical I think when I was there they were harvesting uh their Clover to feed their animals for the year that was everywhere this kind of thing a lot of times it was women on had it on their heads carrying carrying these big giant stacks back to their homes from their fields before service night with some of the ministers the brother that's um sitting on my one side is brother Prince and I'll talk to him talk about him a little bit more packed out church this church doesn't have a p their Pastor just recently passed away so the the um the denominational leaders are sort of sending ministers through there to to watch over them but totally packed I mean you we tried to get off the platform it was almost impossible to get out of the place and we drove up a couple hours to the north to a city called magaga stayed there this is uh brother Prince and his wife they took care of us she made all of our meals while we were there in magaga and um he is the Secretary of their denomination so we sat with him in his church the Lord led me to speak on Joel 2 about the restoration of the Bride tree and and about the dangers of having the leadership of man over having the leadership of the holy spirit in the church and uh gave some of my testimony prayed for people handed out books and uh uh spoke a little bit about um introducing brother Branham and you know the 193 three the angel of the Lord appearing and saying as John the Baptist was sent to four on the first coming of Christ Etc went through that with him which he was shocked by because I was in taking a nap while I was taking a nap brother megaly was describing that to him in in in the uh apartment we're staying in I didn't want to embarrass her by showing the picture in case somehow she came across it but every time she came to our place they live we were we were staying in the apartment above their Church very common is there is they buy a building have the church on the ground floor or the second floor and then they make apartments for visiting ministers or guests to be able to stay in so that's what we stayed in they lived a few blocks away every time she wanted to feed us she would come with a big huge uh uh carrier on her head walking up the stairs just like this no no hands hands on it nothing just up and down the stairs like she'd been doing it her whole life which she had this was looking out the window across there there's chickens and so forth in that spot thankfully they weren't alloud uh that was like right outside my window bedroom window so that was the grace of the Lord and one day you know when I was there part part I forgot to mention was once passed a certain point uh in Egypt that you can't go there without if you're a western or without police escort so before I went brother megaly had to get a copy of my passport and discuss it with the police so everywhere I went I had an escort of police usually they would go in some decrepit old police truck that looked like it probably wouldn't run very much longer and uh they had at least four or five guys they had some people from the local christian militia that would go with and then um just then several regular police officers so I mean I was in in a way I was like felt like I was sort of under house arrest because I couldn't leave or go anywhere without asking the police um if we could do it so it was a little weird that way um but this particular day brother uh brother Prince has grown up here it's what's crazy is all these people that live here now I asked them like have you just moved here did your family no he said as far as we know all our all our ancestors have lived right here in this city in this town and he said it's the same for everybody all these families know each other for generations and generations and generations CU I was asking is it safe to walk through this this city before we go out and he laughed and said I know every I know everybody we've known everybody for Generations yeah this area is safe I know where if you go beyond this you're in a Muslim neighborhood and you're going to have problems but this is a Christ CHR neighborhood um so when you walk down the road you're going to definitely see a donkey or 10 and you're going to see cows and you're going to see water buffalo um this is with brother Prince and we walk down there I don't know if you anybody has heard of this but there is a canal there called Joseph's canal and I researched it and as far as they can tell it goes back it's been called Joseph's Canal as far as they know as long as they remember so it's more than likely was a construction project by Joseph many many thousand years ago and it's a it's a it's quite a big Canal there there's lot everywhere there's a canal cuz that's how they water their fields but this is like one a huge feeder that feeds from the Nile into a lake North from there this guy said I had to pay him $5 to take that picture I didn't um little kid walked up and wanted a picture with me in the neighborhood as we were walking down the road it was it was so interesting an older um woman was an old grandma was sitting on their their front porch which there's not a porch it's just a brick but um she gets up and is like she's like pray for me so we just had a little prayer prayer meeting there in the in the street as we're walking down the road some water buffalo as you know everybody has a water buffalo if you don't get that then you never had kids Wheat they that's the main thing they grew was wheat in the fields it's the Nile I didn't make any denial jokes when I was there all right so this church we went to I was just amazed because on the bottom floor they're trying to get the church ready but um there that's a very poor group of people you can see on the floor it was covered in even on the second floor it's covered in dirt and even in the corners it was like there's like a dirt pile going up and um on the their their handrail going up the stairs and I'm I'm telling you they had very elderly people in this church the handrail was just rebar sticking out of the thing I thought this is this is a worst disaster I've ever seen but it's normal for them that's how they build they they start and if it's useful just use it this was for for me personally this was one of the most uh amazing trips mission trips I've ever done just to be there with these simple humble PE I mean look they got one light there that's their church one light above the preacher and when we got there it was dark and and we were like well I guess we're having Church in the dark I got it I got my I got my MacBook so that's all we're all good they'll see us lit up a little bit and um but then we prayed and the the the lights came on there in the area and just uh incredible I mean I think every everyone came for prayer after the service it's one of the ones I I just preached the gospel preached about the baptism of the Holy Ghost gave my testimony about being healed from Co everybody came for he for prayer for healing handed out like every other Church handed out books of brother brandham I think this is the church yeah this is Brother Prince's church so uh just few floors below where we were staying during the last half of the week there in Egypt and I had no idea but app ently this was Mother's Day so I'm like what in the world is it only women at church today why does this church have like three men and then I look out the Gated doors and I'm like why are all the men in the listening to me from the street and then like the next day brother megal was like yeah yesterday was Mother's Day I'm like what you didn't tell me I could encourage the ladies he's like well I just let you go on your normal talk all right this is the pastor of the church he wanted to take this picture of us in front of his new building he was hoping that I would bless them with some um something to build their building with same thing we at the end of this service I I had him stand up and I said how many are believers could lay hands on one another we did that and then as we're walking out we were detained and I pray I have I prayed for another hour for the people so amen that's fine the Lord knows selfies on the platform never experienced that before but it's something this was the last service we had there um in this area uh this was when the police truck finally did break down fortunately it was after service but um this one was neat because some of the guys from the Christian militia were there uh with their I I don't know if they came into church with their 22 rifles but they were standing in the back listening and uh one of them came and asked for came into the prayer line we prayed for and I asked about the women why they're dressing with those the head cover ings and everything and I was fascinated to realize is this is how Christians have dressed in Egypt for 1900 years since since the gospel went there this is how they've dressed and so that's the traditional um style and um they've just stayed with it most of these people were born Coptic uh Christians Coptic is is any familiar with Coptic that's another form of Catholic so when year you know back in at NAA uh they split up three uh four different Patriarchs of the church one was Rome the pope one was Alexandria Egypt one was uh let's see in Syria Antioch um and and there was another one which was escaping my mind at the moment but these four Patriarchs and one of them was in Egypt so as the churches separated especially if you saw the Eastern churches separate from the the RO the Roman Church this is one of the churches that was kind of original Catholic there they still have their patriarch but he's now in Cairo and so they're very very um Mary is very important and even some of the people that came to Services after you pray for them they do the sign of the cross or whatever and so I I talked with a number of the pastors and asked about that and they said we it takes time I said these people this is what their Generations have come up up up under and we're working with them the other thing that complicates it is that it's Egypt there's no such thing as fre of religion so if you come out and blast the pope of alexand of of Cairo you probably will never come back to Egypt because they control they have control with the Muslims over the Visa process and all that so if you're going to speak like that you speak directly to the ministers the Pastors in public you're going to have you're G to have Catholics listening to you right there who are Poli in the police who won't hesitate to arrest you so um wisdom is required of what you say and how you say it how you speak about denominations and you know um if if you if you have a feeling that you want to never go back to Egypt again let her let her go but if you have a feeling you want to reach the people then you speak privately to those who are more uh mature so amen men musicians would you come I think that's the end of them a few more so there's the there's the man that came with his 22 rifle uh to be prayed for didn't have Hearing in one of his ears and so this was he was he became my escort back to the vehicle so the the Lord has really opened a door a as we were one of the last days we were there brother Prince spoke with me and said we really appreciate your ministry coming here to minister to the people we believe you're a man of God um we we so appreciate what you're preaching and this was the statement that caught me off guard and was surprised about he said Do You Preach like the old time Pentecostal preachers about Miracles and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he said we don't hear that kind of preaching very often anymore and so uh we we discussed with him about the books that we had because we did have some left and he said oh no please leave them I'm going to go visit many other churches and and they'll want these books as well so I'll distribute them and I said well you know if you want more we can get you more he said please we want we want more of the sermons of brother brandom to be able to distribute so we're going to do that and we're we're we're working on a plan at some point to get back to hold a ministers conference there's 65 ministers there and I'm planting a seed with brother Jason just it's just a seed you know we'll see if it grows takes root to uh help out with a a ministers meeting amongst the the ministers there it's a it's a incredible opportunity I'm I'm still actually dumbfounded by it to be honest with you um that they were very aware of what the teaching is I mean I I handed to all their ministers um the the the new book that I did about uh introducing the message and talks about godhead serpent seed water baptism modesty and introducing the the message and the scriptures fulfilled through brother brandham and and they were very enthusiastic about all of it it's been translated into Arabic already so they're very they're very receptive desirous and at the end he said I I read these I read your books that you did that that have been translated into Arabic he's like they're really good I believe what you're talking about amen and uh so we'll see what happens committed into the Lord's hands you you water you you plant the seed and the Lord is the only one that can make it give it increase so amen let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you so much Lord for your goodness we so thank you so much for what you did for us on this trip Lord I I pray father for those
