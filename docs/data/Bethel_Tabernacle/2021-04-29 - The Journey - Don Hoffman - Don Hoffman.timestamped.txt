[25:37] little more tidbit
[25:40] of of his sermon so i'm really really
[25:43] looking forward to it i'll probably be

[25:46] but uh i want to just take in the word
[25:49] of god
[25:50] amen listen friends there's life in the
[25:52] word
[25:53] you remember the story time brother
[25:54] branham tells about he just took his
[25:57] bible
[25:58] and just laid it in a chair just set it
[26:00] in a chair and he just started walking
[26:02] around that chair praying
[26:03] and brother brown said every time i
[26:05] walked past that chair i said i'd point
[26:06] to that book and say oh
[26:08] there's life in that book
[26:11] wow there's life in there friends and
[26:14] how many need life i need more of it
[26:16] i need it and i need it more abundantly
[26:19] and that is
[26:20] what is the the lord's desire for you
[26:24] is that you live that you have life that
[26:27] you have
[26:27] everything associated not just air in
[26:29] your lungs
[26:31] when you talk about life it's about zoe
[26:33] life so

[26:37] represented in christ
[26:39] all the peace all the faith all the
[26:42] harmony
[26:43] amen all the all the power all the
[26:46] commitment
[26:47] everything that is in god is in that
[26:50] life
[26:50] that you're feeding on so don't under
[26:53] don't underestimate
[26:54] amen what god has done is doing
[26:58] and will do amen we're going to sing
[27:01] some more that sister dave i like
[27:02] clapping my hands hey man brother don
[27:04] we're going to invite you to come and
[27:06] take your complete liberty when we
[27:09] all will get to heaven

[27:32] [Music]
[27:33] [Applause]
[27:42] and disgrace
[27:50] [Music]
[27:52] he'll prepare for us a place
[28:02] [Music]
[28:18] [Music]
[28:27] god bless you all do you love him
[28:31] i hope you love him more tonight when
[28:33] you leave
[28:35] because we need to love him with all of
[28:38] our hearts brothers
[28:40] all of our soul all of our strengths
[28:43] and uh we're waiting for that capstone
[28:46] right
[28:48] remember what he says we got to fit with
[28:50] it
[28:52] it says when that joins together you
[28:54] won't be able to fit a razor blade in
[28:56] between there
[28:59] so what's he doing is he making me
[29:03] is he fitting me is he chipping away
[29:07] ah these are some of the things we'll be
[29:09] looking at tonight
[29:12] would you bow with me in prayer
[29:17] in the precious name of our lord jesus
[29:22] oh how we love you lord
[29:26] and how needy we are of you i just feel
[29:30] just waiting on you and father your
[29:32] spirit to take over right now
[29:36] take your place help me to get out of
[29:40] the way
[29:43] even father every human spirit take
[29:46] control
[29:48] that truly you might have the
[29:49] preeminence
[29:52] otherwise we meet in vain we meet in
[29:54] form we
[29:56] meet in ritual but not in spirit and
[29:59] truth
[29:59] and that's what we desperately need
[30:06] so the days of
[30:09] playing church are over but you're
[30:12] working in a bride mightily to fulfill
[30:16] your word in her
[30:19] now we submit ourselves to you father
[30:22] in the precious name of our lord jesus
[30:25] christ amen
[30:28] amen thank you maybe take your seats
[30:33] i know but you know what happened last
[30:36] time i
[30:37] was going for a half hour and they were
[30:39] looking when's he gonna
[30:42] go sit down you can sit down too
[30:48] yeah i'm an
[30:51] i'm an oddball
[30:55] born that way i think
[31:00] all right um
[31:04] i was looking into the scripture
[31:08] and doing praying and the lord led me to
[31:15] a message that has affected me
[31:19] actually several years ago but
[31:23] it made me face things i didn't want to
[31:25] face it had me look at things i didn't
[31:26] want to necessarily look and
[31:28] look at and
[31:33] it's from the message god's only
[31:34] provided a place of worship
[31:36] and brother branham somebody's trying to
[31:39] trick him on something
[31:41] he catches their thought
[31:44] and he says well
[31:48] he's he's talking about somebody makes a
[31:51] comment
[31:51] whosoever believes that jesus christ is
[31:53] the son of god will be saved
[31:56] and then he says it says that
[32:00] he says but remember it also
[32:03] is written it also is written
[32:09] you see so much of our christian lives
[32:15] even in the message people find
[32:18] quotes that are comfortable to them and
[32:20] then they camp on them
[32:24] and you'll never mature that way
[32:29] so the lord was dealing with me
[32:33] and he says time to grow up hoffman
[32:37] so this has sort of been guiding me for
[32:40] years
[32:41] is that it also says it also says and i
[32:45] have to take it also says
[32:48] in everything because brother branham
[32:50] says
[32:52] that if we have the holy spirit we'll
[32:53] say amen to every word of god
[32:56] so i can't be offended or
[33:00] things you know
[33:03] you look at the word of god okay and you
[33:06] look at where the holy spirit is taking
[33:08] us
[33:08] okay we got the doctrine down
[33:12] and we understand godhead we understand
[33:16] serpent seed we understand the man of
[33:18] iniquity
[33:21] um we understand these things
[33:25] but he says you're going to become the
[33:28] word
[33:30] okay well so if i'm
[33:34] becoming the word i can say amen to
[33:37] serpentine
[33:38] no big deal did it cost me anything did
[33:41] it hurt no
[33:43] well what about this word you shall love
[33:45] your enemies
[33:47] that one starts to hurt okay go through
[33:52] luke chapter six
[33:54] um give to those who ask
[34:00] brother jason i i was put to the test on
[34:03] that i'm going to tell you a little
[34:04] story i was
[34:06] getting ready for church
[34:10] and all we have just one tiny room that
[34:13] we rent
[34:15] and in the back is a little cubby hole
[34:17] and that's where i sit before service
[34:18] and pray
[34:20] and the lord led me to luke chapter six
[34:22] and i was sitting there
[34:24] meditating on it and says give to those
[34:27] that ask not if you count them worthy or
[34:33] you know it just says give
[34:36] so after church there was a manager in
[34:38] the building and came up to me i need
[34:40] some money
[34:42] i thought as soon as he said that the
[34:44] letter said here's your test
[34:48] yeah so i gave him
[34:52] so the next service i need some more
[34:55] okay lord and the next service i need
[34:58] some more
[35:03] do you like to be tested
[35:05] [Laughter]
[35:08] we're going to become the word how much
[35:10] of it do we want to become
[35:12] amen because he's very serious
[35:16] when he says i'm going to make you the
[35:17] word yes
[35:19] and we have to be serious along with him
[35:23] so with that we're going on a journey
[35:27] tonight and
[35:28] this whole subject is a journey this
[35:31] spiritual walk that we're on
[35:33] is not a level stopping point it's not
[35:39] oh i believe it i'm done
[35:43] the lord was going to say to every
[35:44] single one of you
[35:47] and he certainly does to me every day
[35:51] take my hand son we're going on a walk
[35:55] and if you follow him you won't be at
[35:57] the same place at night that you were
[35:59] when you started out that day
[36:02] it's a journey and i think the worst
[36:06] thing your worst enemy and my worst
[36:09] enemies
[36:09] and enemy as a believer is complacency
[36:16] and the worst death to a church is
[36:18] stagnation
[36:22] okay now i want you to think on that
[36:25] just for a second
[36:29] the seed of god is a hungry
[36:32] absorbent seed always hungry always
[36:35] thirsty
[36:36] right do you ever feel like you've had
[36:39] enough of the lord
[36:44] i want you to think when is the last
[36:48] time that you talked to
[36:50] joe blow on the street mr catholic and
[36:52] he says you witness to him he says well
[36:54] i'm just satisfied being a catholic
[37:01] watch that person they'll never know
[37:03] they'll never move
[37:05] another step in their life
[37:09] go to mr baptist i'm satisfied being a
[37:12] baptist
[37:14] and they'll stay baptist for generations
[37:18] go to pentecostal i'm satisfied with it
[37:22] i can speak in tongues i'm done so don't
[37:24] you ever say to god i'm satisfied
[37:28] ever that's death
[37:34] you always come hungry every day that
[37:37] you're here
[37:39] you are here for a reason
[37:43] every day that you are here he says take
[37:46] my hand we're going to take another step
[37:50] okay
[37:53] so we know
[37:57] in revelation okay
[38:02] 22 and the spirit and the bride say come
[38:05] and let him that heareth say come and
[38:07] let him that is a thirst come
[38:08] and whosoever will let him take of the
[38:10] water of life really every day
[38:13] every single day
[38:18] so we're on a journey
[38:21] with that let's go to genesis 28
[38:26] and i'll take my text would you stand
[38:29] with me please
[38:40] we're familiar with this story
[38:44] jacob and leaving home
[38:48] going out on his own
[38:53] and isaac has given him final
[39:00] yeah thank you
[39:03] just giving him his final instructions
[39:08] so he goes and he has his first night
[39:11] out alone and he's on this journey
[39:17] so let's read verse 12 to 15.
[39:21] and he dreamed and behold a ladder set
[39:23] up on the earth and the top of it
[39:24] reached to heaven and behold the angels
[39:26] of god ascending and descending
[39:28] on it and behold the lord stood above it
[39:31] and said i am the lord god almighty god
[39:33] of abraham thy father
[39:35] the god of isaac the land wherein thou
[39:38] liest to thee
[39:39] i will give it and to thy seed
[39:43] and that seed shall be as the dust of
[39:45] the earth and thou shalt spread abroad
[39:46] to the west and to the east and to the
[39:48] north and to the south and
[39:50] in thee and in thy seed shall all the
[39:54] families of the earth be blessed
[39:59] would you read verse 15 out loud with me
[40:02] and behold
[40:03] i am with thee and i will keep thee in
[40:06] all the places where thou goest
[40:08] and i will bring thee again to this land
[40:11] for i will not leave thee until i have
[40:14] done that which i have spoken unto thee
[40:16] of
[40:19] i will not leave you
[40:23] i will not leave you until i have done
[40:26] that which i have spoken of the of let's
[40:27] pray heavenly father
[40:33] i commit this time into your hands and
[40:36] myself into your hands we need you lord
[40:39] in this day in this hour in this time
[40:41] like we've never
[40:42] needed you before
[40:48] the days are evil but you are good
[40:52] it's so black out there and so dark out
[40:55] there and so many spirits out there but
[40:57] your spirit shines brighter
[40:59] but only in the souls of your children
[41:06] bring us home lord do what you have to
[41:09] do in us
[41:12] we stand before you yielded
[41:20] submitted crying out with all of our
[41:23] hearts
[41:24] have your way you do what you want to do
[41:30] granted lord we ask in jesus name
[41:33] amen thanks you may be seated
[41:47] and behold i am with thee and will keep
[41:49] thee in all the places that you go
[41:52] and will bring thee again to this land
[41:54] for i will not leave thee until i have
[41:56] done that which i have spoken
[41:58] to thee of
[42:02] my goodness
[42:06] we see jacob starting off his life's
[42:08] journey as a man of god
[42:10] and had everything he needed everything
[42:13] he needed for that journey
[42:16] the word of god to him and the presence
[42:18] of god to make sure it was fulfilled in
[42:21] him
[42:22] and that's exactly what you and i have
[42:25] today brothers and sisters
[42:28] ours is not literal
[42:32] but spiritual
[42:36] and uh
[42:39] we see the scripture fulfilled all
[42:43] around us and in us but that's the most
[42:45] important thing is it being fulfilled
[42:47] in me what's he doing here what's he
[42:50] doing in this skin
[42:54] so um
[42:59] i know hebrews 10
[43:03] verse 14. you go there with me quick
[43:17] jacob set out on a journey ours is
[43:19] spiritual we're familiar
[43:21] okay we got these things
[43:26] that god is working in us to bring us to
[43:29] a place that he wants but he's working
[43:31] every single day
[43:33] and every single day should find us in a
[43:35] different place than we were
[43:37] the day before and in this place
[43:43] that he's bringing us to this place that
[43:47] we have to be ripened he has to have
[43:49] this
[43:50] place in us where he's got to take us
[43:56] where the entire world can be fulfilled
[43:58] in us
[43:59] because that's what the bride's all
[44:01] about she is mrs word
[44:04] she is him she is the fulfilling of all
[44:08] the word of this day
[44:11] so here god takes those that are perfect
[44:15] under the blood of the lord and does
[44:17] something with them
[44:18] he does not do with anybody else
[44:22] he continuously sanctifies them amen
[44:26] continuously
[44:29] and that's exactly the way the prophet
[44:31] teaches us we must lay in the presence
[44:33] of the son
[44:36] to be ripened right
[44:41] but there's more i believe
[44:45] listen to this
[44:49] i believe the church is beginning to
[44:50] hear the message and beginning to
[44:53] understand but friends listen we've got
[44:54] to lay in the presence of the son we've
[44:56] got to be ripened
[44:59] our faith isn't ripe
[45:04] intellectually we're hearing the message
[45:06] god has given us and seeing the signs
[45:08] that he showed us and proven it by the
[45:09] bible
[45:10] it's there but how the church needs to
[45:12] lay in his presence
[45:14] until it tenders up
[45:20] get sweet in the spirit
[45:23] okay a little prickly sometimes aren't
[45:26] we
[45:28] so that it can bathe down so there's a
[45:31] cleansing process here
[45:34] he says sometimes in speaking the
[45:36] message you get harsh and have to break
[45:38] it
[45:38] in like that because you've got to
[45:40] clinch it like a nail to make it whole
[45:42] but once
[45:42] once the church gets at the elective
[45:44] that's called out and separated
[45:47] then in the presence of the son i know
[45:49] it'll be something like the people that
[45:50] was there
[45:52] there's a blending when it takes the
[45:55] rapture
[45:57] so i'm not going to go to the rapture
[45:59] and expect a change i'm going to have a
[46:01] change starting to affect me now
[46:03] to join with those people already there
[46:06] you hear me
[46:08] what's going on now in making you in
[46:10] that transformation
[46:14] so here
[46:17] there's a sanctifying sanctification
[46:20] process there's a process of the holy
[46:22] spirit there's god
[46:23] moving in the hearts of the people he
[46:25] says i have to take you from here to
[46:27] here
[46:28] i have to move you from this place to
[46:30] this place i have to
[46:31] work in your life and i have to work on
[46:33] your heart daily
[46:36] not just wednesdays and sundays where am
[46:39] i on monday morning where am i on
[46:41] tuesday evening
[46:44] where is the love what attracts you
[46:50] what draws you television
[46:56] sports where's god
[47:01] where's the reality of him fulfilling
[47:04] his word in your life and in your heart
[47:06] where's he taking you what kind of
[47:08] journey are you on
[47:12] because this is real this isn't church
[47:17] do you know what brother brad and i have
[47:19] this
[47:22] do you know what he calls church members
[47:25] stinking church members have you ever
[47:27] heard him say that
[47:29] i don't want to be a stinking church
[47:31] member
[47:36] what good is it going to do me if i go
[47:39] play the part and i come before
[47:42] everybody's eyes and i
[47:44] appear accepted
[47:47] but you see they don't know what's going
[47:49] on inside of me really
[47:51] in my secret life on the inside when i'm
[47:55] home
[47:57] and what i'm flipping on the tv and what
[47:59] books i'm picking up
[48:01] oh and they'll never see it well god
[48:04] does
[48:07] but see what good is it going to do you
[48:11] because the effect of the blood of jesus
[48:14] christ has to be working in me
[48:16] now every day
[48:20] that life has to be there
[48:23] so here
[48:27] he's telling us things
[48:31] though we are in a place
[48:35] in hebrews chapter 10 for one off by one
[48:38] offering we're perfected forever them
[48:40] that are sanctified
[48:42] now i know you've gone over this verse
[48:44] but it's a very important verse
[48:48] because you can't come into this message
[48:50] and say i'm done i believe the message
[48:54] okay are you perfect under the blood he
[48:57] said you were
[48:59] but he's not done working with you
[49:03] okay you're done but listen to me
[49:07] your maturity is another thing
[49:12] you're perfect as far as the sin
[49:14] question
[49:16] but i've got to take you to a place i've
[49:18] got to mature you yeah
[49:20] and how many places and how many times
[49:22] and how many things in different
[49:23] messages does he talk about this
[49:25] even in the message it is the rising sun
[49:27] he says you know don't say i've made it
[49:30] don't say can i make it say i've already
[49:31] made it in that same message he says
[49:34] you're growing into the
[49:35] fullness of the resurrection there's a
[49:37] growth there
[49:39] right so i can't take one without taking
[49:42] the other i have to take them both
[49:45] and i have to ask the question is that
[49:47] growth going on
[49:50] where's the holy spirit taking me where
[49:52] is it moving me
[49:54] how is it convicting me every day
[49:58] how is it ruling over my life how is it
[50:01] ruling over this noggin up here
[50:05] and where i allow it to go and what i
[50:08] allow it to see and what i allow it to
[50:10] hear
[50:11] all these things have to be working
[50:13] because he said it would
[50:15] other things he tells us he's we're
[50:18] growing into the fullness of the stature
[50:20] of the bride
[50:22] he tells us those things you're not
[50:25] there he says you're growing
[50:26] into that remember in the message
[50:29] perfect faith
[50:31] he says you must
[50:34] have this perfect faith that's holding
[50:36] up the rapture
[50:38] right and then at the end he says you
[50:40] know
[50:41] it means a lot of shaving down you know
[50:43] shaving
[50:44] not shaking shaving in other words
[50:46] something's got to be like a plane out
[50:48] here got to get rid of some stuff
[50:50] it means a lot of shaving down for me
[50:52] and it means a lot of shaving down for
[50:54] you
[50:55] but he says together we'll make it
[50:58] so the question is what's going on in
[51:00] our hearts in these days what is the
[51:02] holy spirit doing how is it affecting
[51:05] how is this cleansing process going on
[51:08] how is this
[51:08] bathing down going on that he talks
[51:10] about in that quote
[51:15] how is that getting sweet in the spirit
[51:17] how's my temper how's my
[51:18] reaction to things um
[51:23] you know we must have that we must have
[51:26] that perfect faith that's what he said
[51:30] so all these things in the last day
[51:34] he says these last days the true bride
[51:36] church christ seed will come to the
[51:38] headstone and she will be a super church
[51:42] excuse me is she
[51:46] she will be a super race
[51:51] how am i super do you feel super tonight
[51:56] do you feel anything but
[52:00] doesn't something in your heart god help
[52:02] me this is serious
[52:04] [Music]
[52:06] i need to stand before him and say here
[52:08] i am
[52:09] i'm naked before you
[52:13] you know you know what goes on in this
[52:15] old noggin up here
[52:18] you know where my eyes are attracted to
[52:20] you know my ears and you know what's
[52:22] going on in here what's my
[52:24] where's my life
[52:28] how much time did you spend in the word
[52:30] today
[52:32] when's the last time you spent a full
[52:34] hour on your knees in prayer
[52:38] sweet hour of prayer sweet hour prayer
[52:40] are you kidding me
[52:41] sweet minute of prayer
[52:45] no really somebody who used to sing that
[52:49] song and they wrote a sweet
[52:51] hour of prayer that calls me from a
[52:54] world of care
[52:57] power really
[53:01] what's satan doing to us and are we
[53:04] fighting him back with the word of the
[53:06] hour
[53:09] you know where he tells the the holy
[53:12] spirit tells them to pick up
[53:14] his pen and write he said she'll be
[53:16] she'll be that super church
[53:20] they will be they in the bride will be
[53:22] so much like him
[53:24] can you can you say oh that describes me
[53:30] lift your hand up if you can say that
[53:35] see do you know what we've done with
[53:36] these quotes oh that's a nice quote i've
[53:38] heard that
[53:40] but where is the impact of those words
[53:42] where is the
[53:43] power of the spirit behind those words
[53:46] that say
[53:47] hoffman you better get serious often you
[53:50] better get on your knees
[53:52] hoffman you better get before the lord
[53:54] and get serious on these things
[53:58] because he said they'll be so much like
[54:00] him
[54:01] so much they'll even be in this very
[54:03] image
[54:05] now then the next words are pretty scary
[54:10] because he says this is an order to be
[54:12] united with him
[54:13] really i have to be this this has to
[54:16] happen before that has to happen
[54:19] so i'm going to ask you a question
[54:23] what good does playing church do you
[54:30] what good does it do to put on a facade
[54:33] in front of people
[54:36] and i was saying is there should be a
[54:37] desperation in every single one of us
[54:39] where am i before you god
[54:41] where am i what do you need to do and
[54:45] here i am and i'm laying myself before
[54:47] you and i'm pleading with all my heart
[54:48] do it do it do what you have to do
[54:55] god help us in these things
[55:00] he says these this bride they will be
[55:02] the manifestation of the
[55:04] word of the living god amen they will be
[55:07] the manifestation of the word
[55:10] amazing so then he is you go to this
[55:13] progressive work
[55:15] the progressive things that he said
[55:17] would be in the bride
[55:19] lay in the presence of the sun till
[55:20] she's ripened okay
[55:22] what does that mean now next question is
[55:26] what does that mean lord to me
[55:30] do i feel the heat of the sun baking
[55:34] down on me baking the greenness out
[55:37] because if that's happening that means
[55:39] there's a conviction going
[55:40] on because conviction and baking go
[55:44] together don't they
[55:47] that means there's got to be a cleansing
[55:49] process and that's what he also said in
[55:50] that quote
[55:52] they got to bathe down something's got
[55:53] to clean us more
[55:56] and i think this is very very
[55:57] interesting you go back
[56:00] to the message
[56:04] future home and he keeps talking about a
[56:08] further cleansing process
[56:10] okay so when you come to the lord are
[56:12] you cleansed
[56:15] when you leave the world you come okay
[56:18] then are you when you're justified are
[56:20] you cleansed some more
[56:24] yeah then when you're sanctified are you
[56:27] cleansed some more
[56:30] cleaner cleaners clean this desk test
[56:33] then when the spirit of the lord comes
[56:35] in you are you more clean than
[56:36] are you does he still keep cleaning you
[56:40] so you ask the question when's enough
[56:42] enough
[56:45] and he will say when i see me
[56:50] when i see me now
[56:54] because i've been thinking about these
[56:55] things here's the message the token
[56:59] we all know it you can probably recite
[57:02] most of it by heart
[57:03] so if i quoted you anything out of the
[57:05] token you'd say yeah we know that
[57:08] but the token is himself the token in a
[57:11] cis spirit
[57:12] right it's him and he says
[57:16] that has to be over me i have to be
[57:18] under it
[57:20] so then when he says when i see the
[57:22] blood
[57:24] when i see the token i'll pass over you
[57:28] so do you know what he's telling you
[57:30] stop and think about this
[57:33] jason i'm passing over you and i don't
[57:34] want to see jason
[57:42] when i pass over you i don't want to see
[57:44] you i want to see me
[57:48] right how serious are we on these things
[57:53] what's god doing where's he taking us
[57:56] and the biggest question of all for
[57:58] every single one of us
[58:00] is is he doing this in me
[58:03] amen don't worry about the guy next to
[58:06] you
[58:08] don't say oh what about brother such and
[58:11] such so what about sisters
[58:12] forget that you go look in the mirror
[58:16] and you forget about everybody else and
[58:18] say what about this guy here
[58:21] what about me if i came tonight would i
[58:25] really feel
[58:26] confident that i'd be gone
[58:32] did he produce did he make a son in the
[58:34] image of his son
[58:36] am i an obedient son or am i just
[58:39] playing a game am i just say
[58:41] well you know
[58:44] i'm wearing dresses and i'm cutting my
[58:46] hair if you're a man and
[58:49] listen to me this message
[58:54] has as many fig leaves as were in the
[58:56] garden of eden
[59:00] and your hair and your dress can be
[59:02] nothing but a fig leaf
[59:04] to you
[59:07] and men with your haircuts
[59:11] fig leaves and you can be dead on a
[59:14] doorknob on the inside
[59:17] and get all kinds of smiles coming to
[59:19] church and yet you're crying lord i need
[59:22] your life
[59:23] desperately i need you
[59:29] but let me tell you he still hears a
[59:31] desperate
[59:32] cry he will hear
[59:35] your cry and he will come to you
[59:40] but it's one on one
[59:43] right brother it's one on one
[59:49] let's think where he's taking us
[59:53] so with my scripture again tonight
[59:57] as it was told jacob i will not leave
[1:00:00] you
[1:00:01] till i've performed every word in you
[1:00:04] unless you say i'm not interested
[1:00:08] unless you tell him go find somebody
[1:00:12] else
[1:00:14] unless you say to him i'm satisfied
[1:00:18] then you'll be like mr baptist mr
[1:00:20] catholic and mr pentecost
[1:00:24] the minute you turn him down but i'll
[1:00:26] tell you what that seed of god is an
[1:00:28] absorbent hungry seed
[1:00:32] always desiring more
[1:00:36] always hungry always thirsty
[1:00:41] i was saying lord where's your manna
[1:00:44] for me today because if i don't have it
[1:00:47] i'm gonna die
[1:00:54] so here are the things that we're
[1:00:55] looking at is that god
[1:00:57] is with us no matter what faces us
[1:01:00] if we have an honest heart before him
[1:01:03] he'll hear your cry
[1:01:08] so there's this progression and that's
[1:01:09] we're talking about this journey that
[1:01:11] we're on
[1:01:13] because even in one of his last messages
[1:01:16] power of transformation he says now that
[1:01:18] we have been saved as we have
[1:01:22] now that we have been filled with the
[1:01:23] holy spirit as we have now we want the
[1:01:25] mind of christ
[1:01:27] to be in us that we might be transformed
[1:01:30] here you go from the natural things of
[1:01:33] life and brought in to do the perfect
[1:01:35] will of god
[1:01:36] there's that obedient sonship
[1:01:40] by transformation now isn't that
[1:01:42] interesting now that i've been saved
[1:01:45] now that i've been sanctified now that
[1:01:47] i've been filled with the holy ghost now
[1:01:48] i
[1:01:49] want the mind of christ now this is what
[1:01:51] i'm going to spend some time on because
[1:01:53] i'm looking at the life of the prophet
[1:01:56] and how god dealt with him
[1:01:57] as an example to us because in the
[1:01:59] rising of the son when brother branham's
[1:02:01] talking about that man
[1:02:04] what god has done to him there was a
[1:02:07] wave sheep
[1:02:09] waved over the people the lord jesus
[1:02:11] there was another wave she
[1:02:13] waved over us in this day and it was the
[1:02:15] what
[1:02:16] what was it the first one come to
[1:02:20] that means there's more coming
[1:02:23] right isn't that where all of our hope
[1:02:25] is
[1:02:27] so in that first one coming to maturity
[1:02:30] in this age
[1:02:31] we have an example of how god dealt with
[1:02:33] him
[1:02:34] so i'm looking here
[1:02:38] and i'm saying i think us
[1:02:41] bringing us to his mind cleansing us out
[1:02:45] because i've spent a lot of time at home
[1:02:48] going over
[1:02:49] three messages
[1:02:52] um greatest battle ever fought
[1:02:56] thinking man's filter knoweth it not
[1:02:58] it's also
[1:02:59] in um
[1:03:02] god of this evil age and uh god's word
[1:03:07] in this what's that word god's
[1:03:11] huh
[1:03:14] yes that too he talks about the body and
[1:03:18] the
[1:03:18] soul and spirit so much you know that
[1:03:19] that's nothing new to us
[1:03:22] but in there he says there has to be a
[1:03:24] cleansing process
[1:03:26] okay in thinking excuse me
[1:03:30] greatest battle ever fought he says this
[1:03:31] is where the battle is he says you have
[1:03:33] a conscience you have an imagination
[1:03:35] you have a reasoning and they're all
[1:03:36] plugged up by the devil did you know
[1:03:38] that and he says they have to be cleaned
[1:03:40] out because they
[1:03:40] have to become channels of the holy
[1:03:42] spirit
[1:03:45] okay so we're going to go into this and
[1:03:48] i'm going into these things
[1:03:51] the final frontier i call it
[1:03:54] is having the mind of christ
[1:03:58] the last enemy to be brought under the
[1:04:00] feet of our lord jesus is our carnal
[1:04:02] mind
[1:04:04] remember that brother branham said who
[1:04:06] was who was his own worst enemy him
[1:04:09] why why is that now
[1:04:12] turn with me to hebrews chapter 9
[1:04:16] and you're going to see this very
[1:04:17] scriptural what what brother branham did
[1:04:21] hebrews 9 talks about the
[1:04:24] the old covenant
[1:04:29] hebrews 9 is talking about the temple
[1:04:32] the tabernacle
[1:04:34] and the parts of the tabernacle and
[1:04:37] we're going to start at verse 7 and the
[1:04:38] second which is the holy place
[1:04:41] went the high priest alone every once a
[1:04:43] year without not without blood that's in
[1:04:45] the most holy place okay
[1:04:48] which he offered for himself in the
[1:04:50] heirs of the people now look at verse
[1:04:51] eight
[1:04:52] the holy ghost thus signifying that the
[1:04:54] way unto the holiest of all was not made
[1:04:56] manifest well the first tabernacle was
[1:04:57] standing
[1:04:59] so only one could go in there
[1:05:02] only wonder what but brother branham
[1:05:04] preached a message unveiling of god and
[1:05:06] what did he say
[1:05:08] one time it was death to go in there he
[1:05:12] says now it's death to do what
[1:05:14] to stay out so i have to get there
[1:05:17] i have to get into that presence of god
[1:05:19] but look at what he says
[1:05:22] verse 9 which was a figure for the time
[1:05:26] then present in which
[1:05:28] were offered both gifts and sacrifices
[1:05:30] that could not make him that did the
[1:05:32] service perfect as pertaining to what
[1:05:36] now that's weird so what's he telling me
[1:05:39] he says
[1:05:40] you know you cannot go into the presence
[1:05:42] of god with your conscience the way it
[1:05:44] is
[1:05:45] huh really
[1:05:50] well tell me what's the state of your
[1:05:52] conscience today
[1:05:56] and what does that mean and what's going
[1:05:57] on because this is a pretty important
[1:06:00] significant verse if i can't go into him
[1:06:03] into the presence
[1:06:04] of god in my conscience the way it is
[1:06:06] something's got to happen well
[1:06:08] he tells you further down in that
[1:06:11] chapter
[1:06:12] verse 13 and 14 for if the blood of
[1:06:16] bulls and goats in the ashes of a heifer
[1:06:18] sprinkling the unclean sanctifies to the
[1:06:20] purifying of the flesh how much more
[1:06:21] shall the blood of christ
[1:06:23] who through the eternal spirit offered
[1:06:25] himself without spot to god do what
[1:06:29] so my conscience has to be purged
[1:06:33] so brother branham draws this out and he
[1:06:36] calls it
[1:06:36] in the message greatest battle he calls
[1:06:38] it your solar system
[1:06:40] so he must be a circle with little
[1:06:42] planets in here so if you draw an
[1:06:44] imaginary circle up here
[1:06:46] that's your human spirit and here's
[1:06:50] conscience affections imagination reason
[1:06:54] and memory
[1:06:56] he says now those are all plugged up by
[1:06:58] the devil
[1:07:00] but he says god has to scour every one
[1:07:02] of those out
[1:07:05] okay so i can't have my own reasoning
[1:07:09] come on brothers
[1:07:13] you feel like you got a little of your
[1:07:14] own reasoning in there
[1:07:18] how about your imagination how about
[1:07:20] your affections
[1:07:22] a bunch of reasoning
[1:07:27] that's a little frightening isn't it
[1:07:31] so i'm going to spend a little time into
[1:07:33] the message
[1:07:35] knoweth it not because this is where he
[1:07:39] goes into here and he says
[1:07:42] i'm gonna just take some
[1:07:49] some quotes from here just to set up
[1:07:50] this thing
[1:07:52] what was god doing this is the only
[1:07:55] message i know where he tells what god
[1:07:56] was doing when
[1:07:57] he tore his life apart
[1:08:01] it's amazing so he talks about
[1:08:05] body soul and spirit and he says now the
[1:08:08] outside man is the flesh
[1:08:11] and he says that's the evil one
[1:08:15] not much going for us there is their
[1:08:16] brothers and sisters huh
[1:08:18] so this is evil right
[1:08:22] this is the evil one he said inside as
[1:08:24] that is your
[1:08:26] human spirit and here's what he says
[1:08:28] about that he says that's your worldly
[1:08:30] nature
[1:08:31] and that was not given from god but
[1:08:34] permitted by him
[1:08:36] so you got a spirit there that was god's
[1:08:38] just permitted it but it's not from him
[1:08:42] but it has its purpose according to
[1:08:44] everything that he he does because he
[1:08:46] does everything perfect
[1:08:47] then he talks about the soul and he
[1:08:49] calls it sometimes he calls it the last
[1:08:51] man
[1:08:52] sometimes he calls it the first man
[1:08:54] sometimes he calls it the little inside
[1:08:56] man
[1:08:58] and he says now the last man is the soul
[1:09:01] and the only sense that can that has
[1:09:03] control is free will to choose or to
[1:09:05] reject
[1:09:07] now he says now
[1:09:11] here with your human spirit he says
[1:09:14] people can live in the spirit
[1:09:15] dance in the spirit every hour of their
[1:09:17] spirit they can go to church in the
[1:09:18] spirit
[1:09:19] they can be absolutely have the real
[1:09:21] spirit of god anointed in that spirit
[1:09:23] but still be lost and devil possessed
[1:09:26] with that spirit that little frightening
[1:09:32] so lord help me amen
[1:09:35] we've got to get honest before god get
[1:09:37] you know
[1:09:39] well it doesn't do any good for any of
[1:09:41] us to play church anymore brothers and
[1:09:42] sisters
[1:09:44] we each have a place where we stand
[1:09:46] before god
[1:09:48] and he's either going to do something in
[1:09:50] me and i'll go home or he's not going to
[1:09:52] do anything to me because i'm resistant
[1:09:54] and i'll stay
[1:09:58] do you know what he says
[1:10:01] he says the bride
[1:10:05] uh-huh she's cleansed she's sanctified
[1:10:08] by the blood of jesus christ
[1:10:11] there's a cleansing process up here in
[1:10:14] all of these things
[1:10:18] but what does it say about the foolish
[1:10:19] virgin she has to go through the
[1:10:21] tribulation for that
[1:10:23] so let me tell you something you know
[1:10:26] what this isn't a very nice thing but
[1:10:28] you're going to be cleansed one way or
[1:10:29] another you take your pick
[1:10:33] okay if you say i i'm not interested i
[1:10:37] you know i'm busy i got a life and
[1:10:40] you're so this is pretty secondary to me
[1:10:42] right now my spiritual walk he said
[1:10:43] that's
[1:10:44] fine i'm still going to deal with you
[1:10:47] you're going to be
[1:10:49] sanctified you're going to be cleansed
[1:10:50] but it's during the tribulation period
[1:10:52] you take your pick
[1:10:56] you want to do it now or later that's
[1:10:59] what he says
[1:11:03] so there's some something that has to
[1:11:06] happen something has to happen inside of
[1:11:08] me and i
[1:11:08] god i pray that it's happening now i
[1:11:10] don't want it to happen
[1:11:12] then
[1:11:15] so he's talking about this inside man
[1:11:18] and the outside man he's talking about
[1:11:20] these things going on in
[1:11:22] inside of us and they have to happen
[1:11:26] in page
[1:11:30] 17 knoweth it not he says
[1:11:36] the outside man is the flesh
[1:11:40] he says that's the evil one on the
[1:11:42] outside isn't that amazing the evil one
[1:11:44] goodness sakes that no
[1:11:48] he says the last man is the soul and the
[1:11:50] only sense that controls that
[1:11:52] is free is to choose or reject that's it
[1:11:56] you have nothing else to do then he goes
[1:11:58] on to say the only way up here in these
[1:12:00] spheres
[1:12:01] that you could ever enter in this little
[1:12:03] inside man
[1:12:04] you have to be ordained
[1:12:07] you have to be a part of god
[1:12:10] and i believe everyone's sitting here
[1:12:12] there's something in you calling
[1:12:14] you're not here playing games you're not
[1:12:17] here to be seen
[1:12:19] you got better things to do right
[1:12:22] so there's something in your heart
[1:12:24] pulling you towards him and there's
[1:12:26] something
[1:12:26] in your heart that has to work these
[1:12:29] things out
[1:12:30] to bring all of the word to pass but
[1:12:32] here
[1:12:34] in uh page
[1:12:38] 23.
[1:12:42] inside of that inside of the man is a
[1:12:45] little thai post
[1:12:47] there that that seed that was
[1:12:49] predestinated before the foundation
[1:12:51] of the world i don't care what takes
[1:12:53] place it'll hold him there
[1:12:56] just it'll hold him so then he goes on
[1:12:59] and he says something
[1:13:01] very very strange
[1:13:05] he's talking about what's happened to
[1:13:07] him
[1:13:09] and he's doing all of this teaching and
[1:13:11] then all of a sudden he just stops
[1:13:14] and the teaching stops and he and he
[1:13:18] starts his life story and i thought what
[1:13:21] oh why did he do that
[1:13:23] and he makes this most astounding
[1:13:25] statement he said what was going
[1:13:27] on what was happening in my life he says
[1:13:32] what did it do it was working from the
[1:13:35] outside to this first
[1:13:37] man think of that
[1:13:41] something had to happen in the prophet
[1:13:45] god had to deal with him and he dealt
[1:13:47] with him harshly
[1:13:50] listen to me if he dealt with me and you
[1:13:52] like he dealt with that prophet
[1:13:54] none of us would have families
[1:13:58] he was deadly serious about this
[1:14:03] it was working from the outside to the
[1:14:05] first man
[1:14:07] i was using my reason god says no more
[1:14:12] i was using my affections no more
[1:14:16] says you let me in there let me
[1:14:19] that i alone are your reasoning i alone
[1:14:22] are your conscience
[1:14:24] really yes or else it's death
[1:14:29] so he's taken the prophet to this place
[1:14:33] something from somewhere else said way
[1:14:36] down on the inside
[1:14:37] where were you to begin with the lord
[1:14:39] gave and the lord take away
[1:14:41] he says that that inside man doesn't
[1:14:44] reason at all
[1:14:46] no all reasoning is gone
[1:14:49] he says how did i get here on earth i
[1:14:51] come
[1:14:52] with a bun through a bunch of drunk
[1:14:54] drunkards how did i get there who gave
[1:14:56] me life
[1:14:57] who gave me a wife who gave me this baby
[1:14:59] where did my wife come from where did my
[1:15:01] life come from
[1:15:02] though he slayed me yet i'll trust him
[1:15:04] and he says there it is that
[1:15:06] something on the inside of the inside
[1:15:08] beyond all reasonings beyond all
[1:15:10] emotions
[1:15:11] beyond everything intellectual
[1:15:15] holds the inside man holds you
[1:15:20] so here in this thing he's telling you
[1:15:22] for the first time ever
[1:15:24] why god had to deal with him
[1:15:28] why god had to deal so harshly with him
[1:15:34] because he was using his own mind he was
[1:15:37] using his own thoughts he was using his
[1:15:39] own reasoning god says no you're not
[1:15:41] going to use those anymore you're going
[1:15:42] to use mine
[1:15:45] now do you want to see things god thing
[1:15:48] things god's way or yours
[1:15:51] do you want your own reasoning or do you
[1:15:53] want his because he'll deal very harshly
[1:15:55] with you
[1:15:58] till he gets you in a place where you're
[1:16:02] can be molded and shaped
[1:16:07] where his voice has its place in your
[1:16:10] life
[1:16:13] now
[1:16:17] he says what was he doing he was working
[1:16:19] from the outside
[1:16:21] to that first man isn't that an amazing
[1:16:24] statement
[1:16:26] he took away my wife you take away my
[1:16:28] baby and even in this message it talks
[1:16:30] about losing his father he had to lose
[1:16:32] it all
[1:16:33] before god could get his attention
[1:16:35] before god could say
[1:16:38] i need you i need this
[1:16:42] work done in you now
[1:16:47] i have two things here and their
[1:16:49] thoughts
[1:16:50] and i before i say them
[1:16:53] i'm not trying to promote anybody or
[1:16:55] anything but
[1:16:56] this is simply testimonies
[1:17:00] of what brother branham told brother
[1:17:03] vale personally
[1:17:04] okay 1963
[1:17:10] they were out in the rockies and the
[1:17:13] blizzard came right after that
[1:17:17] they were traveling together and they
[1:17:19] were in a hotel and brother vale
[1:17:21] stood outside of his room waiting for
[1:17:23] brother branham and he
[1:17:25] just waits because he never knocks on
[1:17:27] his door because he didn't want to
[1:17:28] disturb him he just stood there
[1:17:31] he waited for a wild time brother
[1:17:33] branham came out of his hotel room came
[1:17:35] up to him
[1:17:36] and brother vel knew that the angel of
[1:17:38] the lord had
[1:17:39] been there with him and
[1:17:44] he didn't say a word because he felt the
[1:17:46] spirit so strong and brother branham
[1:17:48] just looked at him and said
[1:17:50] brother vale i have no more conscience
[1:17:52] of sin
[1:17:54] think of that
[1:17:58] 1965 same condition
[1:18:02] same scenario they were together in a
[1:18:04] hotel
[1:18:07] brother vale is out standing outside of
[1:18:09] his door
[1:18:10] of his room and he's waiting for brother
[1:18:12] brian and brother brandon walks out of
[1:18:13] his room and he walks up to him and
[1:18:14] brother vale doesn't say where he just
[1:18:16] waits for him to speak
[1:18:19] and brother brandon makes this comedy
[1:18:20] comment
[1:18:23] he says brotherly all of my thoughts are
[1:18:25] of god
[1:18:26] can you imagine
[1:18:31] that's the work of the holy spirit
[1:18:35] that is the work can you imagine look at
[1:18:39] all of my thoughts are of god
[1:18:43] now where is he taking me and where does
[1:18:44] he want to take the bride of jesus
[1:18:46] christ and where does he want to take
[1:18:47] you
[1:18:48] how filled do you want to be with the
[1:18:49] holy spirit
[1:18:51] how much can you submit yourself because
[1:18:54] these are things that
[1:18:55] he has to do you can't do them
[1:18:58] you can try and try and all you will do
[1:19:00] is get frustrated with yourself
[1:19:02] and lose your faith but if you just lay
[1:19:06] in his presence and submit to him
[1:19:08] and allow him to do the work because
[1:19:10] this is what he wants to do
[1:19:12] amen he wants to take you places where
[1:19:15] you thought it was impossible for me to
[1:19:17] go
[1:19:17] there he wants to do things inside of
[1:19:20] you say it was impossible for me to do
[1:19:22] of course and you know what you said to
[1:19:26] the lord i can't do this
[1:19:28] and i can just feel the holy spirit
[1:19:30] saying i've been waiting for you to say
[1:19:31] that for a longest time
[1:19:33] finally you said it move over
[1:19:38] let me have my place
[1:19:43] let me in put me in the control room
[1:19:49] now give me your conscience
[1:19:52] give me your reasoning
[1:19:57] give me your affections give me your
[1:20:00] imaginations and he says
[1:20:02] all of every one of those will become
[1:20:04] channels of the holy ghost
[1:20:06] every single one of them and that's
[1:20:10] the real spiritual journey
[1:20:13] that's where your election will take you
[1:20:16] to the point where our condition and
[1:20:17] election meet
[1:20:20] to fulfill the word of god
[1:20:23] listen to me again the real spiritual
[1:20:26] journey
[1:20:27] is where your election and his
[1:20:31] conditioning his work in you takes you
[1:20:33] to a crossing point
[1:20:35] your election and your condition
[1:20:41] now
[1:20:45] brother branham says he had to take me
[1:20:47] there
[1:20:48] he had to get me to this place
[1:20:52] it was painful it took him losing his
[1:20:55] wife
[1:20:58] but he said he had me to move me to this
[1:21:00] inside man he had to move me to this
[1:21:03] place where his spirit was in absolute
[1:21:04] control
[1:21:07] because that inside man is the soul
[1:21:10] and it can only say yes or no to god
[1:21:12] right
[1:21:14] so you know you can't get there and say
[1:21:17] no to god all the time
[1:21:19] no i won't let you hear no i won't let
[1:21:20] you there oh well where are you
[1:21:22] why is my life such a mess well you've
[1:21:25] shut me out
[1:21:29] but there has to be this place in the
[1:21:32] bride of jesus christ while she finally
[1:21:34] gives up and she
[1:21:35] yields everything to her savior to her
[1:21:38] lord
[1:21:38] and says i give you everything of me
[1:21:42] i give you it all now he has to do his
[1:21:46] work
[1:21:49] go with me would you to to genesis
[1:21:52] chapter 22.
[1:21:55] now this is very odd
[1:21:59] but i love it because god works in odd
[1:22:02] ways
[1:22:05] and i'm very odd too so we meet
[1:22:10] genesis 22 abraham you're very familiar
[1:22:13] with the story
[1:22:19] in chapter 22 he's taken isaac up to the
[1:22:23] mountain
[1:22:24] in obedience to the lord and he's waited
[1:22:27] a long time for isaac
[1:22:29] so how long did he wait 25 years
[1:22:34] it's a long test how long have you been
[1:22:36] tested
[1:22:39] how many of you have been tested 25
[1:22:40] years
[1:22:42] over one test
[1:22:47] see god's not in a hurry
[1:22:50] but he knows what he's doing
[1:22:54] so how old was isaac after that 22 years
[1:22:57] and he was oh i've got the promised son
[1:22:59] oh he's here it's all over no it's not
[1:23:01] all over
[1:23:04] it wasn't all over at all so one day he
[1:23:07] hears a voice jason
[1:23:09] we've talked about this how old do you
[1:23:11] think isaac was
[1:23:12] some say he was 30 right that's a long
[1:23:18] time
[1:23:20] that's a long time so you've been
[1:23:23] enjoying your son and finally you have
[1:23:24] the promise of god and god says go take
[1:23:27] him up and sacrifice i mean what
[1:23:28] i haven't heard right that can't be
[1:23:33] now what kind of a covenant are we
[1:23:35] talking about with abraham
[1:23:37] grace covenant what did abraham have
[1:23:40] into it nothing
[1:23:42] so why did he put him through these
[1:23:44] things why did he have to
[1:23:46] come to these places why did he sell
[1:23:48] them after he had him and he was 30
[1:23:50] years old do you spend this time with
[1:23:51] him and they've grown this relationship
[1:23:53] father and son
[1:23:55] take him and sacrifice him you've got to
[1:23:57] be kidding me
[1:24:00] so
[1:24:04] you notice uh look at verse
[1:24:07] 2. and he said take now this and only
[1:24:09] son
[1:24:10] isaac whom they'll love us and get thee
[1:24:12] to the land of moriah and offer him
[1:24:15] there a burnt offering upon one of the
[1:24:17] mountains that i will tell you of and he
[1:24:18] rose up early in
[1:24:20] in the mornings and saddled his ass and
[1:24:22] took two of his young men with him and
[1:24:23] isaac and his son claimed the wood
[1:24:25] before the burnt offering and rose up
[1:24:27] and went to their place
[1:24:29] and then on the third day he lifted up
[1:24:31] his eyes and saw the place so far off
[1:24:33] now that's mean
[1:24:35] go sacrifice your son okay i'll go do it
[1:24:38] but i want it done today
[1:24:40] so they travel for three days and then
[1:24:41] they finally see it he gives them plenty
[1:24:43] of time to think
[1:24:44] about it i'm not going to make this easy
[1:24:47] on you
[1:24:49] you know what you're going to do you
[1:24:51] walk for three days and then you see it
[1:24:53] off in the distance
[1:24:54] okay so then you know the story
[1:24:58] my point is here do you have it
[1:25:03] do you have the kj are you on east sword
[1:25:06] no
[1:25:06] go to east sword i don't think oh
[1:25:09] that's too bad jason you got your
[1:25:11] e-sword i want you to go to verse
[1:25:15] get your kgv plus out there
[1:25:18] and i want you to go to verse
[1:25:28] 16 and i want you to look up the word
[1:25:32] because
[1:25:33] in ancient hebrew okay
[1:25:41] here's a man here's a man under a grace
[1:25:45] covenant here's a man with a covenant
[1:25:46] that says you have nothing into this
[1:25:51] nothing i've said it it's going to
[1:25:53] happen
[1:25:54] oh that's cool i like it
[1:25:59] so why does he put him through all this
[1:26:00] stuff
[1:26:02] he takes him he sees the place three
[1:26:05] days journey
[1:26:06] he sees it afar off gives him plenty of
[1:26:08] time to sweat
[1:26:11] to work out his faith to make sure his
[1:26:13] faith is in place to make sure that he's
[1:26:15] going to be obedient
[1:26:16] so go to chapter 22 verse 14
[1:26:21] and abraham called the name of the place
[1:26:23] jehovah jireh as i said in this day in
[1:26:25] the mount of the lord it shall be seen
[1:26:26] and the angel of the lord called to
[1:26:28] abraham out of heaven the second time
[1:26:31] and said by myself have i sworn set the
[1:26:34] lord for because thou has done this
[1:26:36] thing and has not withheld thy son thine
[1:26:38] only son
[1:26:40] because because why is that in there
[1:26:45] because you have done this
[1:26:48] because you haven't will tell i will
[1:26:51] bless you
[1:26:51] now wait a minute that shouldn't be in
[1:26:53] there
[1:26:56] what it should reas you know what i
[1:26:59] promised this so it's just going to
[1:27:00] happen
[1:27:02] i promise this is a grace covenant you
[1:27:04] have nothing into it
[1:27:05] so why is that there
[1:27:09] isn't that interesting so all of a
[1:27:11] sudden god comes on the scene he says
[1:27:13] because you have done this thing because
[1:27:15] you have brought your son
[1:27:17] because you have built an offer because
[1:27:18] you were willing to take that knife
[1:27:20] and cut him because you did that i will
[1:27:24] fulfill my promise that doesn't sound
[1:27:27] like a grace covenant to me does it to
[1:27:28] you
[1:27:31] what was god doing there he was under a
[1:27:33] grace covenant but under that grace
[1:27:35] covenant a condition still had to be met
[1:27:38] of a maturity
[1:27:39] that he had to come to and he says
[1:27:41] because you have done this
[1:27:43] i'm going to fulfill my word
[1:27:46] interesting isn't it jason read that
[1:27:48] word in the ancient hebrew because
[1:28:07] the nomadic agriculture is carefully
[1:28:09] watches over his livestock
[1:28:11] and props by keeping a close eye on them
[1:28:15] isn't that interesting god's watching
[1:28:18] over he says i'm going to watch
[1:28:20] to see that you become the mature son i
[1:28:22] want you to become
[1:28:23] yes i promised you but yes it's not
[1:28:25] going to happen until i see this in you
[1:28:29] isn't that interesting
[1:28:34] yes it's a grace covenant but yes i've
[1:28:36] got work to do
[1:28:39] yes you are perfect under the blood of
[1:28:41] jesus christ yes you are perfect there
[1:28:43] but he says that doesn't mean you're
[1:28:44] done
[1:28:47] yes you are perfect under the blood of
[1:28:49] jesus christ but i'm still going to
[1:28:50] mature you and it's going to hurt
[1:28:53] you're going to be tried
[1:28:58] because although i have perfected you
[1:29:00] under the blood of jesus christ i
[1:29:02] haven't
[1:29:02] matured you and i haven't given you that
[1:29:04] character because i can't because that's
[1:29:06] not a gift
[1:29:10] remember what he said character is not a
[1:29:11] gift
[1:29:13] and you have to go through this victory
[1:29:16] so here is
[1:29:17] abraham in the same scenario in the same
[1:29:19] place he's under a grace covenant
[1:29:22] not if you will i will but i have
[1:29:24] already done it
[1:29:25] and god has to still bring him to this
[1:29:27] place he says because
[1:29:29] i'm watching over you i'm watching over
[1:29:32] this seed
[1:29:35] i'm watching it to make sure it matures
[1:29:37] and when it's mature finally i'll
[1:29:39] fulfill my promise
[1:29:42] you see where you're at today do you see
[1:29:45] what the holy spirit's doing in us today
[1:29:47] these things are there and they're both
[1:29:49] perfectly fit together like this
[1:29:53] but it's time we see these things and
[1:29:55] mature into them
[1:29:56] they're both in a grace covenant
[1:30:00] but because you have come to this place
[1:30:02] where you have trusted me
[1:30:05] with that promised son
[1:30:09] and you have given him into my hands and
[1:30:11] given yourself into my hands in total
[1:30:13] abandon
[1:30:16] that in blessing i will bless you now
[1:30:20] otherwise that because shouldn't even be
[1:30:22] in there should it
[1:30:27] it's a strange word in a strange place
[1:30:31] but it's there
[1:30:35] and he put it there
[1:30:43] so brother branham had to come to this
[1:30:46] place
[1:30:48] in maturity he took away his wife
[1:30:52] he took away his daughter
[1:30:56] he's dealing with him he said i have to
[1:31:00] move you to this inside man where i have
[1:31:02] to move you to this place
[1:31:04] i have to move you into this place where
[1:31:06] all reasoning and all conscience and all
[1:31:08] your own thinking is dead
[1:31:12] and nothing is alive but the word of god
[1:31:14] listen to me brothers
[1:31:16] and sisters look into the bible
[1:31:20] look at every man and woman of god that
[1:31:22] god greatly used
[1:31:24] and he on purpose
[1:31:27] took them to a place where they had to
[1:31:30] deny
[1:31:31] every single thing that their eyes and
[1:31:33] their ears and their senses told them
[1:31:36] go through the scripture true or not
[1:31:39] true
[1:31:41] abraham here's a promise
[1:31:45] every day ah here's another ache here's
[1:31:48] another pain
[1:31:49] here's another wrinkle so what
[1:31:55] until finally he's what does romans say
[1:31:58] he was as good as dead
[1:32:01] and he staggered not at the promises of
[1:32:03] god
[1:32:06] look at jacob
[1:32:09] and esau what does what was esau's
[1:32:13] testimony i'm going to
[1:32:15] eat this messes pottage and die
[1:32:18] right why there was a famine in the land
[1:32:21] it says that in verse
[1:32:22] 20 chapter 26 verse 1.
[1:32:27] what were the conditions like pretty
[1:32:28] terrible
[1:32:31] what did jacob say sell me your
[1:32:34] birthright
[1:32:38] why
[1:32:40] i have the word and somehow
[1:32:43] with that word god's going to do
[1:32:45] something in this body of mine
[1:32:47] i don't care if it doesn't rain for a
[1:32:48] hundred years
[1:32:51] he'll do something in this body where i
[1:32:52] don't need food because i got a promise
[1:32:56] he put them in a place where they on
[1:32:58] purpose they had to deny
[1:33:00] every single thing to stand on the word
[1:33:03] of god
[1:33:03] every single thing that their senses
[1:33:05] told them
[1:33:09] i'm going to ask you a question where's
[1:33:10] god taking you
[1:33:13] and don't be surprised when the trials
[1:33:15] come
[1:33:16] where he's going to say all right we're
[1:33:18] going to see where your eyes are
[1:33:21] huh what if this whole economy crashes
[1:33:25] what if the whole system collapses where
[1:33:27] are you so what
[1:33:31] do you know this is a reality do you
[1:33:33] know that he did this with his men look
[1:33:35] at noah
[1:33:37] no hey it's going to rain it's never
[1:33:40] rained before
[1:33:42] you're foolish you're crazy god said so
[1:33:48] everything in this life speaks against
[1:33:51] the word of god
[1:33:52] but the soul hangs on to the word of god
[1:33:54] against everything
[1:33:55] that your eyes and your ears and your
[1:33:57] senses tell you
[1:34:00] and you have to stand there on the word
[1:34:02] of god and if he did it to all of those
[1:34:04] men won't he do it to us won't we be
[1:34:06] tested
[1:34:12] it has to happen
[1:34:16] what does the word of god mean to you
[1:34:19] i tell you what someday it's going to
[1:34:21] mean everything
[1:34:23] or you're going to die
[1:34:26] and it's going to be life or you will be
[1:34:28] dead
[1:34:31] and it isn't just a nice sunday school
[1:34:33] lesson and this message isn't just
[1:34:34] oh we wear skirts and we look nice and
[1:34:39] i say the right buzzwords and i can say
[1:34:42] all the messaging things
[1:34:45] no where is your life with god
[1:34:50] and what's he doing and what's becoming
[1:34:52] a reality to you
[1:34:55] you know and where is god because it's
[1:34:58] brothers and sisters it's going to look
[1:35:00] pretty bleak
[1:35:03] because when god spoke to jacob and says
[1:35:06] i'm not going to leave you
[1:35:08] until everything that i've spoken
[1:35:09] concerning you is going to come to pass
[1:35:11] that's exactly what he's saying to you
[1:35:13] and me today
[1:35:14] i'm here and i'm not going to leave you
[1:35:17] until i fulfilled every single word
[1:35:19] inside of you
[1:35:20] unless
[1:35:24] you tell me
[1:35:28] lord i've had enough lord just leave me
[1:35:31] alone i'm satisfied
[1:35:32] that's fine he'll leave you alone don't
[1:35:35] you ever say that to him
[1:35:39] because you tell him to leave you alone
[1:35:41] and you see what your life turns into
[1:35:45] god is a gentleman remember
[1:35:53] so exodus chapter
[1:35:56] three we know the story you don't even
[1:35:58] have to turn there
[1:35:59] same thing i've heard the cries of my
[1:36:03] people
[1:36:04] right i've seen the affliction
[1:36:08] why didn't he just say oh 400 years are
[1:36:12] up it's time to go
[1:36:15] because 400 years was up and it was time
[1:36:17] to go but he doesn't say 400 years are
[1:36:20] up it's time to go he says i've heard
[1:36:21] the cry
[1:36:22] there had to be a condition in the
[1:36:24] people there had to be a condition
[1:36:26] that meets the election there has to be
[1:36:29] a condition in the people that meets the
[1:36:31] word of god
[1:36:32] there had to be a condition in abraham
[1:36:35] okay even though he had a promise and
[1:36:38] that promise was
[1:36:39] unconditional god was still waiting
[1:36:45] what was that picture jason and i i'm
[1:36:48] watching
[1:36:49] i'm watching why because
[1:36:52] because why is that word because in
[1:36:55] there i don't want it to be in there
[1:36:58] it should just say i promised it and
[1:37:00] here it is
[1:37:02] no because
[1:37:05] you've done this you've not withheld
[1:37:07] your only son because you were obedient
[1:37:08] because you did this because you were in
[1:37:10] this place with me
[1:37:11] and trusted me with everything beyond
[1:37:13] all of your senses and it looked crazy
[1:37:15] and looked
[1:37:16] insane who would offer their own son
[1:37:18] it's even against everything in the laws
[1:37:20] of god
[1:37:22] but you obeyed my voice and you came to
[1:37:24] this place
[1:37:26] and because of this all the promises of
[1:37:29] abraham are now
[1:37:30] on you think of that brothers look at
[1:37:32] your life
[1:37:34] look at where you are look what god is
[1:37:35] doing with you and you wonder why
[1:37:37] ah what a mighty god
[1:37:42] you see he's brooding over you he's
[1:37:44] brooding over each one of you
[1:37:46] each one of your life each one of you is
[1:37:48] precious to him
[1:37:50] each one of you has your own story
[1:37:53] each one of you he's working differently
[1:37:55] in
[1:37:56] he's not a cookie cutter each one of us
[1:38:00] you're unique and he's not going to work
[1:38:02] in any two of you the same way
[1:38:04] but he's going to do a work
[1:38:08] and he has
[1:38:11] he's very serious about what he's doing
[1:38:15] and that's bringing you to maturity
[1:38:18] so and again exodus three
[1:38:22] he didn't say it's 400 years time i'll
[1:38:24] go down he says no i've heard the cry
[1:38:26] i've seen the reflection what about me
[1:38:30] and you
[1:38:30] what's he waiting on you the time is up
[1:38:34] but there has to be a condition
[1:38:37] remember what he said how many of these
[1:38:39] things he said
[1:38:41] you know we're growing into the fullness
[1:38:44] of the erection we're growing into the
[1:38:45] fullness of the stature of jesus christ
[1:38:47] we have to be so much like him all of
[1:38:49] these things have to be in place
[1:38:51] are they what's working in your life are
[1:38:54] those things taking place
[1:38:55] is he molding you is this shaping you
[1:38:57] are you dying to the things of the world
[1:38:58] how about your conscience
[1:39:00] oh it's very alive and well what about
[1:39:02] your imagination no i don't even want to
[1:39:04] go there
[1:39:05] what about your affections
[1:39:08] leave me alone
[1:39:13] and you expect to get out of here
[1:39:17] listen if he had to deal with the
[1:39:19] prophet that way if he had to say
[1:39:21] i had what was he doing he was taking me
[1:39:25] moving me so that i wouldn't be affected
[1:39:28] by this
[1:39:29] outside man i wouldn't be affected by my
[1:39:31] reason i wouldn't be affected by my
[1:39:33] imagination
[1:39:34] i wouldn't be affected by he says
[1:39:36] because this inside man
[1:39:38] that he had to get me to doesn't reason
[1:39:40] at all it doesn't go by sight
[1:39:43] it doesn't go by analysis it doesn't go
[1:39:46] by mental
[1:39:48] it goes only by the word of god
[1:39:52] and that's where he has to get us to if
[1:39:54] he did that
[1:39:56] to the first one coming to maturity i'm
[1:39:58] going to ask you a question
[1:39:59] wasn't he the first one in the bright
[1:40:02] age waved over the people this life look
[1:40:04] at this life look at how mature it was
[1:40:06] look at the son of god
[1:40:08] isn't what did brother brown say there's
[1:40:09] more common
[1:40:12] what about me and you isn't he going to
[1:40:14] do the same thing to me and you
[1:40:16] we have to mature
[1:40:20] we have to we have to grow and listen
[1:40:23] i'm going to say something
[1:40:25] oh i hope you don't you might hate me
[1:40:27] after this
[1:40:29] listen i don't care what your church or
[1:40:31] what your pastor it's you
[1:40:32] and god and you can't use jason as an
[1:40:35] excuse
[1:40:37] and my people can't use me excuse
[1:40:38] hoffman
[1:40:40] you're a miserable failure i know i'm a
[1:40:42] miserable failure
[1:40:48] but i'm going to do everything i can to
[1:40:50] point you to jesus christ
[1:40:53] because he's the only hope you got
[1:40:56] and he's the only hope i got and he's
[1:40:59] going to do the work
[1:41:01] because he said he would and he said
[1:41:03] he's with me and he said he would stay
[1:41:05] with me and tell every word of god
[1:41:06] considering
[1:41:08] concerning me is fulfilled right
[1:41:13] i won't leave you until every word i've
[1:41:16] spoken to you is done
[1:41:18] and that's what he's saying to you and i
[1:41:19] today
[1:41:21] he's with you to do it
[1:41:25] so these things look impossible how can
[1:41:26] he do this how can he take me to this
[1:41:28] place
[1:41:30] if you loved him that's how if you
[1:41:33] surrender
[1:41:34] that's how if you resist it won't happen
[1:41:39] if you tell him you don't want to go
[1:41:40] there he's a gentleman
[1:41:42] he won't take you there if you tell him
[1:41:46] you're satisfied he'll leave you alone
[1:41:49] if you tell him you're not interested in
[1:41:51] growing don't worry about it
[1:41:54] you can stay as a dead as a doorknob
[1:41:57] and he'll leave you alone but the seed
[1:42:01] of god is hungry
[1:42:03] the seed of god is thirsty and the seed
[1:42:06] of god is very absorbent
[1:42:08] and the seed of god cries out i want all
[1:42:11] that you can give me

[1:42:18] single day i want more today than i had
[1:42:20] yesterday i want more tomorrow than i
[1:42:21] had today
[1:42:23] listen okay am i too late what time is
[1:42:26] it is it late
[1:42:28] i don't even okay
[1:42:31] how can this happen go with me to exodus
[1:42:38] we had in genesis
[1:42:44] our text today that told us how it's
[1:42:46] going to happen but here it is
[1:42:49] also
[1:42:52] exodus chapter 3.
[1:42:56] moses is before the burning bush
[1:42:59] okay
[1:43:06] god is with you my friend each one of
[1:43:09] you
[1:43:11] listen he has called you
[1:43:15] to walk with him and don't you dare
[1:43:18] mistake
[1:43:22] a walk with the church
[1:43:27] from a walk with him
[1:43:30] isn't it brother and how much
[1:43:33] churchianity there is in this message
[1:43:37] i'm okay because i go to such and such a
[1:43:39] place i've heard those words
[1:43:42] i go to such and such a place i said
[1:43:44] under such and such a pastor
[1:43:46] i'm okay you're not okay you're deceived
[1:43:50] you're delirious
[1:43:53] listen do you remember
[1:43:57] the message perfect faith and i don't
[1:43:59] even know because this has been on my
[1:44:01] heart
[1:44:02] so much do you know what he says about
[1:44:06] bride condition
[1:44:07] rapturing condition huh
[1:44:17] so when a man lives by faith and walks
[1:44:19] by faith i mean substance faith he's
[1:44:21] isolated from the entire world
[1:44:25] and becomes a new creature in christ now
[1:44:28] you're getting into bride material
[1:44:31] listen to me now you're getting into
[1:44:33] rapturing condition
[1:44:35] okay that means for each one of us not
[1:44:39] just the pastor
[1:44:42] not just the deacons not just the
[1:44:45] trustees
[1:44:47] that means every one of you amen that
[1:44:50] means the laity every single person
[1:44:52] listen to what he says every individual
[1:44:58] walks in a world with god
[1:45:01] alone
[1:45:04] nobody's in there but you and him this
[1:45:07] is his words not mine
[1:45:10] he gives the orders you pack them out
[1:45:14] whatever he says there's not a shadow of
[1:45:16] a doubt anywhere you walk right in
[1:45:18] if the lord says this there's nobody in
[1:45:20] the world can talk you out of it
[1:45:22] just the same that's perfect faith
[1:45:27] now i don't know of any other place
[1:45:28] where he's described
[1:45:30] rapturing condition and bride material
[1:45:32] so clearly but i'm going to ask you a
[1:45:34] question are you there
[1:45:38] i know of so many people that have a
[1:45:41] wonderful relationship with the church
[1:45:45] but have no relationship whatsoever of
[1:45:47] god
[1:45:50] where's your relationship well i sing in
[1:45:54] the choir i play the piano i do this no
[1:45:56] i'm not asking you that i'm saying
[1:45:58] where's your walk with god because he
[1:46:00] says you
[1:46:00] walk in a world with god alone nobody's
[1:46:03] in there but you
[1:46:04] and him he packs he gives you the orders
[1:46:07] and you pack them out you're that
[1:46:08] obedient
[1:46:09] son and i've said ever since i read this
[1:46:12] years ago i said
[1:46:14] brother jason i said i got to get the
[1:46:15] people to that place
[1:46:18] we have to do everything we have to get
[1:46:20] all of you to this place where you're
[1:46:22] walking with god
[1:46:25] alone you hear his voice
[1:46:28] you hear his orders to you you're
[1:46:30] obedient
[1:46:33] and there's that beautiful obedient
[1:46:34] sonship again
[1:46:40] don't replace it with churchianity
[1:46:44] oh i go to church oh i'll go to
[1:46:47] wednesday nights mostly i'm pretty good
[1:46:49] oh i did my duty let's get on with life

[1:47:17] effect
[1:47:20] will you become a prisoner to jesus
[1:47:23] christ you you and him
[1:47:27] because that's the only thing that
[1:47:28] matters numbers don't matter
[1:47:32] buildings don't matter because you're
[1:47:34] the church not this building

[1:48:10] knees on

[1:49:46] i don't want to share you with devils
[1:49:47] out there
[1:49:48] i want you
[1:49:51] i am love so here is moses
[1:49:59] and he's been down in egypt then he's
[1:50:01] been on the backside of the desert now
[1:50:03] he's at the burning bush
[1:50:05] you know the story
[1:50:08] but here's a god that comes to him and
[1:50:11] in verse 12 he has the most beautiful
[1:50:13] thing
[1:50:16] let's go to 11 moses said to god who am
[1:50:18] i that i should go to pharaoh and that
[1:50:20] is
[1:50:21] that i should bring the children forth
[1:50:23] who am i well why do you want to ask the
[1:50:25] same question to god who am i
[1:50:27] who am i i'm just joe blow i'm just
[1:50:30] trying to work myself way through this
[1:50:31] life
[1:50:32] huh who are you you're his bride
[1:50:38] verse 12 he says certainly i will be
[1:50:40] with you
[1:50:41] and this shall be a token unto you now i
[1:50:44] have to read this to you because it's
[1:50:46] the
[1:50:47] out of the tanakh version it's a hebrew
[1:50:49] version of the old testament
[1:50:51] and it's so rich
[1:50:55] would you read it
[1:50:59] would you read 312 12.
[1:51:03] okay which word
[1:51:06] oh just read that verse and he said
[1:51:08] certainly
[1:51:09] come up here brother so they can hear i
[1:51:12] wanted the people
[1:51:14] exodus 3 12 and he said certainly i will
[1:51:16] be with thee
[1:51:18] and this shall be oh wow i love this
[1:51:20] yeah
[1:51:21] yes yes and this shall be a token
[1:51:25] unto thee that i have sent thee when
[1:51:28] thou has brought forth the people
[1:51:30] out of egypt okay now i want you to read
[1:51:33] the tanakh version
[1:51:35] this no it's this
[1:51:38] um i have it here bro
[1:51:43] that's another translation yeah it's
[1:51:45] called the tanakh okay
[1:51:47] but moses said unto god who am i that i
[1:51:50] should go to pharaoh and free the
[1:51:51] israelites and he said i will be with
[1:51:53] you
[1:51:55] that's a sign that it's me
[1:51:59] the very name of god
[1:52:02] in his name is his presence
[1:52:07] and he says to you this is how you know
[1:52:10] it's me
[1:52:11] i'm there i'm with you
[1:52:14] and i'm going to fulfill this word
[1:52:17] you can't do it and i know you can't
[1:52:22] but you know what i can because i'm god
[1:52:25] and you know what you can't be god but
[1:52:27] i'm very good at being god
[1:52:33] just let me be but isn't that the most
[1:52:37] thing he says certainly i will my be
[1:52:40] with you
[1:52:40] this is how you know it's me that's
[1:52:44] talking
[1:52:45] it's my presence is with you and
[1:52:48] brothers and sisters that goes down
[1:52:49] through the whole scripture that's how i
[1:52:51] know this
[1:52:52] is so perfect there
[1:52:56] but then jason
[1:53:00] type on the word token this shall be a
[1:53:02] token unto you
[1:53:03] in that same verse and read the word
[1:53:07] token to them
[1:53:09] in the ancient hebrew that's the whole
[1:53:11] sermon
[1:53:26] that's what i was asked to do okay so
[1:53:28] the word token
[1:53:31] verse 12 this shall be a token this
[1:53:34] shall be a sign
[1:53:35] and in fact is it's everywhere that he
[1:53:36] uses the term token
[1:53:38] yeah and so he says so the ancient
[1:53:41] hebrew is a pictograph
[1:53:43] of an ox um it's a picture of an ox
[1:53:47] and then a cross which is a picture of
[1:53:51] two cross sticks
[1:53:53] used to make a sign or mark
[1:53:56] combine these two pictures represent an
[1:53:59] ox moving toward
[1:54:00] a mark this is ancient hebrew
[1:54:03] okay when plowing a field with oxygen
[1:54:06] the plowman drives the auction toward
[1:54:08] a distant mark in order to keep the
[1:54:11] furrows straight
[1:54:13] if i may you remember brother brown i'm
[1:54:15] talking about elisha the thing that
[1:54:17] attracted god's attention
[1:54:19] is elisha kept his rose just straight
[1:54:22] and god knew if he cared that much about
[1:54:24] the furrows of his
[1:54:26] of his garden or his his crop he would
[1:54:28] care that much about his word
[1:54:30] all right so it's about getting your
[1:54:32] rose straight
[1:54:34] so he says um the the plowman drives the
[1:54:37] auction towards a distant mark
[1:54:39] in order to keep the furrows straight a
[1:54:41] traveler
[1:54:42] arrives at his destination by following
[1:54:44] a mark
[1:54:45] the traveling toward a mark destination
[1:54:48] or person this is token this is the word
[1:54:51] this is all in the word token
[1:54:53] this is a this is the same word in
[1:54:55] exodus
[1:54:56] everywhere 12. yeah this is genesis 6
[1:54:58] yeah the covenant in the
[1:55:00] in the cloud the rainbow it's all do you
[1:55:01] know what it means listen brothers
[1:55:03] excuse me yeah keep going but i just
[1:55:05] want to say this you're on a journey
[1:55:08] you're traveling the world
[1:55:11] walk of god is a journey you have to
[1:55:14] keep moving
[1:55:16] moving is life stationary is death what
[1:55:19] happens when you get old
[1:55:21] and you get ready to die you quit moving
[1:55:24] yeah
[1:55:24] look at a little baby squirming all over
[1:55:27] look at the young people they love
[1:55:31] what do you call those places amusement
[1:55:32] parks why let's move
[1:55:34] let's move in every way we can possibly
[1:55:36] move right
[1:55:37] we get our age we're slowing down
[1:55:41] okay the arrival of one to a mark
[1:55:45] so that's a token the arrival of one to
[1:55:48] a mark
[1:55:49] a you is an individual who has arrived
[1:55:52] to
[1:55:53] me the coming toward a mark
[1:55:56] and then it goes into a standard flag
[1:55:58] with the family mark hangs as a sign
[1:56:00] an agreement or covenant by two where a
[1:56:03] sign or mark of the agreement is made as
[1:56:05] a reminder to both parties
[1:56:08] moving at something i'm moving at
[1:56:10] something
[1:56:11] there you go we're moving yeah yeah they
[1:56:14] have a destination we don't no
[1:56:15] stagnation is allowed around here
[1:56:18] no stationary you got to keep moving
[1:56:21] every day is different than the day
[1:56:22] before we're in a new place with god
[1:56:24] every single day
[1:56:25] right okay what was it
[1:56:28] you might be under a con unconditional
[1:56:32] covenant but you're still moving
[1:56:34] yeah you might be under an unconditional
[1:56:36] covenant of grace but god still had to
[1:56:39] see the maturity
[1:56:40] in his son abraham are you with me
[1:56:43] there's still something that he's doing
[1:56:46] even in an unconditional
[1:56:47] because you have done this thing
[1:56:50] because you've been obedient because
[1:56:52] you've come to this place where
[1:56:54] you denied all your own thinking all
[1:56:56] your own reasoning all your thing and
[1:56:58] lifted up a
[1:56:59] a knife to slay your own son what who
[1:57:02] would do something like that
[1:57:04] nobody accepts somebody
[1:57:08] that's fully trusting their god
[1:57:11] and totally denied every single sense
[1:57:13] that they had
[1:57:15] listen i told you god brings every
[1:57:17] single person
[1:57:18] to a place where that he's that they had
[1:57:22] to deny
[1:57:23] every single thing this life told them
[1:57:26] now i'm going to let's go to kedish
[1:57:29] okay what did their eyes tell them
[1:57:32] there's big people there
[1:57:34] what did their reasoning say they're
[1:57:35] stronger than me
[1:57:37] what did their affection say oh man
[1:57:39] those leeks and garlics were pretty good
[1:57:41] every one of their senses spoke against
[1:57:44] them
[1:57:45] and nobody could go against their senses
[1:57:48] except two men
[1:57:50] who says i'll stand alone on the word of
[1:57:53] god
[1:57:54] and deny every single thing that
[1:57:56] everyone's single sense of mind
[1:57:58] tells me and i'll go over and only two
[1:58:02] could do it think of that
[1:58:09] but if you're willing
[1:58:12] he'll take you by the hand and be with
[1:58:15] you
[1:58:17] and it's a journey the very word token
[1:58:20] is journey
[1:58:21] we're on a journey we're moving we're
[1:58:23] moving every day we're moving farther
[1:58:26] farther away from the world and closer
[1:58:28] into god and closer into the mind of god
[1:58:30] and closer into having the mind of god
[1:58:32] because we have to have his mind
[1:58:35] brother branham he had to move him to
[1:58:37] that inside man
[1:58:39] he had to he says i have to get you
[1:58:41] there if i'm going to do anything with
[1:58:43] you and look what he got out of that man
[1:58:46] huh listen that was the most astounding
[1:58:50] statement i've ever read because it's
[1:58:52] the only place i know
[1:58:56] well there's another place i found out
[1:58:57] let me read it
[1:59:00] see if i can find this
[1:59:05] here's another one
[1:59:09] why he explained the flood
[1:59:14] and losing his wife and losing his dad
[1:59:16] and losing this baby
[1:59:19] okay he was moving me to that inside
[1:59:23] person i couldn't
[1:59:24] he couldn't use me well as long as i
[1:59:26] still had my own reasoning
[1:59:28] think about that jason that's scary
[1:59:34] he can't use you as long as you're using
[1:59:36] your own brain up there
[1:59:38] submit to his
[1:59:42] your own conscience your own reasoning
[1:59:44] your own imagination your own affections
[1:59:46] nope
[1:59:47] they're plugged by the devil you got to
[1:59:49] get rid of them
[1:59:51] here's another quote when i lost my baby
[1:59:53] my little sharon
[1:59:55] that was the one thing that stumbled me
[1:59:57] i said how can that be for good
[1:59:59] how can it be for the good and months
[2:00:01] later when i seen her standing there and
[2:00:03] all the beauty of a young girl speaking
[2:00:04] to me standing by the side of that old
[2:00:06] wagon broken down
[2:00:08] i knowed here's what he said if she
[2:00:11] would have lived
[2:00:12] she might have turned out wrong
[2:00:15] god had to take her when she was tender
[2:00:17] and sweet
[2:00:20] think of that i'll see her again
[2:00:23] i know i'll see her i know beyond a
[2:00:25] shadow of a doubt i think of my wife
[2:00:27] 22 years old taken just a mere girl like
[2:00:30] a
[2:00:31] mother here with the papers of the
[2:00:33] headline a young mother just dies oh my
[2:00:36] how my heart bled i didn't know what to
[2:00:38] do but today i know it was all working
[2:00:40] for my good
[2:00:43] i know the life had to be ground and
[2:00:45] twisted and squeezed
[2:00:47] to get what was in it out listen to what
[2:00:50] he says
[2:00:51] there was too much branham
[2:00:54] does that scare you a little bit
[2:00:58] there was too much branham in there had
[2:01:00] to be squeezed out before god could make
[2:01:02] himself known
[2:01:04] listen to this there's too much you
[2:01:08] in you that's his words not mine i'm
[2:01:11] reading
[2:01:14] there's too much you and you till god
[2:01:16] had to squeeze it out
[2:01:17] through trials and while that squeezing
[2:01:20] was coming on it's hard
[2:01:22] but after a while the skies clear back
[2:01:24] and you can see the purpose of god then
[2:01:25] you cry
[2:01:26] i know my redeemer lives
[2:01:31] and at that last day he'll stand on the
[2:01:32] earth
[2:01:35] that's pretty amazing huh it's too much
[2:01:38] me and me i guarantee you
[2:01:41] there's too much you and you i know it
[2:01:43] it's too much us in us

[2:02:26] i'll be with you you can't do it but i
[2:02:28] can
[2:02:30] i'll be with you that's how you know
[2:02:33] it's me
[2:02:34] it's my presence with you exodus 6
[2:02:37] real quick then we'll quit
[2:02:45] god's rehearsal of what he's going to do
[2:02:48] notice what he says
[2:02:50] let's go to verse 2 and god spake unto
[2:02:52] moses and said unto him i am the lord
[2:02:54] j h w h capital l o r d that's the name
[2:02:57] of god
[2:03:00] over and over look at verse 3
[2:03:03] as i appeared unto abraham and isaac and
[2:03:05] to jacob by the name of almighty god
[2:03:08] that's el shaddai but by my name jehovah
[2:03:11] i wasn't made known why
[2:03:14] he didn't appear to abraham in
[2:03:16] redemption brother branham talks about
[2:03:18] this
[2:03:20] very much he loved to preach out of the
[2:03:22] book of exodus
[2:03:24] exodus is the book of redemption he says
[2:03:26] everything he's doing and exodus is
[2:03:28] doing now
[2:03:29] today it's perfect time okay
[2:03:32] so by the name of jehovah
[2:03:37] okay j h w h
[2:03:41] that's the holy name of god so holy that
[2:03:43] the jews to this day cannot even utter
[2:03:45] that
[2:03:45] name because they know if they utter the
[2:03:48] name it brings his presence down and
[2:03:50] they would die
[2:03:52] but we are under the blood this is
[2:03:55] holiness
[2:03:57] but what did he say in chapter 3
[2:04:01] this is my name and my name means i'm
[2:04:03] going to be with you
[2:04:05] think when you're baptized in the
[2:04:07] precious name of the lord jesus
[2:04:09] we know so little of the blessings that
[2:04:11] are there for us brothers and sisters
[2:04:15] when you're baptized in that precious
[2:04:18] name
[2:04:19] of the lord jesus you have you're
[2:04:22] surrounded you're immersed in his
[2:04:24] nature and because everything is in that
[2:04:28] name
[2:04:28] his nature is in his name
[2:04:31] his word is in his name his presence is
[2:04:34] in that name
[2:04:35] i'm with you this is how you know it's
[2:04:37] me
[2:04:38] what do you say to joshua i'll be with
[2:04:41] you
[2:04:42] huh what do you say what did jesus say
[2:04:44] i'll be with you
[2:04:46] how long till the end of the earth right
[2:04:49] i'm gonna be with you i'm gonna say i'm
[2:04:50] not gonna leave you i won't forsake you
[2:04:52] i'm here
[2:04:53] i'm with you to do what like you said
[2:04:55] you know what i'm here to do
[2:04:57] i want to fulfill my word in you i'm
[2:05:00] here for that
[2:05:00] i'm here for you will you believe me for
[2:05:02] that so here we are
[2:05:05] exodus i wasn't known to
[2:05:08] abraham by that name jhwh because
[2:05:12] that wasn't redeeming that was the seed
[2:05:14] establishment
[2:05:17] in redemption he makes his name dome
[2:05:20] in redemption it's jhwh
[2:05:24] the lord jesus christ jesus
[2:05:28] in redemption the name of god look at
[2:05:31] verse 4 i've established my covenant
[2:05:33] with them to give them the land of
[2:05:35] canaan
[2:05:35] in the land of their pilgrim i'm taking
[2:05:37] you we're going on a journey
[2:05:41] i'm taking you to the new jerusalem
[2:05:44] yep you're going to be there with me
[2:05:48] we got quite a journey to go through and
[2:05:50] it's through a lot of deserts and a lot
[2:05:51] of terrible things
[2:05:53] but you know what i'm gonna be there
[2:05:54] with you every step of the way
[2:05:58] i'm there i'm gonna pull you through
[2:06:02] because you are my covenant child and i
[2:06:05] will not leave you
[2:06:06] until every word that i've spoken
[2:06:08] concerning you is fulfilled
[2:06:11] that's your god so there he tells them
[2:06:15] look at verse 5. i have heard the
[2:06:17] groanings of the children of israel whom
[2:06:19] the egyptians kept keeping bondage and i
[2:06:21] have remembered my covenant
[2:06:23] wherefore say unto the children watch i
[2:06:26] am
[2:06:27] the lord capital lordy there's his name
[2:06:31] look at i will bring you i will bring
[2:06:34] you
[2:06:34] who's doing it you him i will bring you
[2:06:38] from the burdens of the egyptian what's
[2:06:40] the next one i
[2:06:41] will read you out of their bondage
[2:06:43] what's the next one i will redeem you
[2:06:46] with a stressed out arm verse 7 here's
[2:06:48] another i
[2:06:49] will take you to me for people next one
[2:06:52] i will beat you to a god
[2:06:54] and you will know that i am the lord
[2:06:55] your god that brings you out from the
[2:06:57] burdens of the egyptians
[2:06:59] and i will bring you to the land he
[2:07:01] tells you before they start i'm going to
[2:07:03] tell you then you're going to be there
[2:07:06] now listen as soon as he goes
[2:07:12] and tells them these things he takes
[2:07:14] them out for testing
[2:07:17] you know he takes them out and there's
[2:07:18] no water and they say you brought us out
[2:07:21] here to die
[2:07:22] they didn't hear a word he said
[2:07:25] because look at verse 9 read it out loud
[2:07:28] with me would you
[2:07:30] and moses spake unto the children of
[2:07:32] israel but they hearken not unto moses
[2:07:34] for what
[2:07:35] anger and for what
[2:07:38] they couldn't hear a word he said those
[2:07:41] words meant nothing to him so then when
[2:07:42] they went out
[2:07:43] into the testing they didn't have those
[2:07:45] words to gird them up
[2:07:48] they couldn't hear the words because of
[2:07:50] this
[2:07:52] they couldn't hear the words because of
[2:07:54] this
[2:07:56] they couldn't hear the words because of
[2:07:58] this their all of their senses told them
[2:08:02] they couldn't hear it if they would have
[2:08:03] heard only two men heard do you know
[2:08:05] that
[2:08:07] two two out of two million heard the
[2:08:10] words of god
[2:08:14] question when they were out there in the
[2:08:17] wilderness and they were all complaining
[2:08:19] okay what'd they say it's hot
[2:08:23] was it hot yep it's dry
[2:08:26] was it dry yeah they were hungry yup
[2:08:30] they were thirsty yup why didn't moses
[2:08:33] say that
[2:08:36] why didn't joshua say that
[2:08:40] because they had the word of god in them
[2:08:41] that said you know what
[2:08:44] i don't care if it doesn't rain today or
[2:08:46] tomorrow
[2:08:47] or next year if i have to go a year
[2:08:49] without water he's going to do something
[2:08:51] on my body because i got the word of god
[2:08:54] that is more powerful
[2:08:55] than any drought or anything else
[2:08:58] and that's where he has to take these
[2:09:00] people to a place where they deny
[2:09:02] every physical thing to stand alone on
[2:09:04] the word of god and that's all they got
[2:09:09] and are you willing to go there
[2:09:12] because he might take us there you might
[2:09:15] be tried
[2:09:16] like you've never been tried before
[2:09:17] listen i know the bride doesn't have to
[2:09:19] go through persecution but don't tell me
[2:09:20] you're not going to be tried
[2:09:25] trying is the greatest thing you can do
[2:09:28] so brother branham tells us but all of
[2:09:32] the types here
[2:09:33] everything is then he puts man in a
[2:09:36] position on purpose
[2:09:38] where they have to deny every single
[2:09:40] thing their senses tell them to stand
[2:09:41] alone on the word of god
[2:09:44] think of that
[2:09:49] and this journey is a journey and
[2:09:52] everything in the journey is going to
[2:09:53] say you know what
[2:09:54] he's not here
[2:09:58] that was her testimony he's not here you
[2:10:00] brought us here to die
[2:10:03] listen i want you to remember these
[2:10:06] words
[2:10:10] okay silence
[2:10:14] god gets very quiet
[2:10:17] you're in a time of testing
[2:10:21] silence never means absence
[2:10:24] you remember that silence
[2:10:28] never means absence
[2:10:33] he was there watching over every step
[2:10:39] and the ones that had the faith to
[2:10:40] believe that i'm going to stand alone on
[2:10:42] the word of god i don't care
[2:10:44] how hot i am i don't care how
[2:10:47] empty my belly gets
[2:10:50] i don't care how big those giants are
[2:10:54] because when he said take the land do
[2:10:56] you know what
[2:10:58] when he said go take the land
[2:11:02] they couldn't because of this and
[2:11:05] because of this
[2:11:06] and because of this right
[2:11:11] i'm going to ask you how much does this
[2:11:15] and this and this play in your life
[2:11:18] right now
[2:11:21] tell me tell me you can deny it look at
[2:11:25] you
[2:11:25] look at me
[2:11:29] we're very much in the flesh aren't we
[2:11:38] that he's with you to do in you and for
[2:11:41] you
[2:11:43] and through you what you could never do
[2:11:46] yourself
[2:11:47] all you have to say is here i am father
[2:11:50] i believe every word
[2:11:51] i don't know how it's going to happen
[2:11:52] but it's going to happen
[2:11:55] okay it's going to
[2:11:58] i will not leave you until i have
[2:12:02] fulfilled every word of god
[2:12:04] in you those words
[2:12:07] stand for the bride of jesus christ
[2:12:11] for every one of you every one of you
[2:12:13] wherever you are in life
[2:12:15] you follow him you follow him
[2:12:20] god bless you all
[2:12:34] wow i've never been given an opportunity
[2:12:37] to come up and
[2:12:38] help the preacher preaching it's like a
[2:12:39] dream come true
[2:12:41] my amen
[2:12:44] wow that was quite remarkable
[2:12:48] amen we're going to go to prayer
[2:12:51] and um got a couple of requests that
[2:12:54] came in and if anyone
[2:12:55] listening has any that they forgot to
[2:12:57] get in if you get them to me quickly
[2:12:59] directly try to get them on
[2:13:02] and if i can get them right away
[2:13:06] we're not going to delay i know it's uh
[2:13:09] children got to get up for school and
[2:13:11] adults up for work so we're going to let
[2:13:13] you go shortly but wasn't the word rich
[2:13:16] tonight my i so so
[2:13:19] enjoyed that i knew that i would i had
[2:13:22] talked to brother don
[2:13:24] we had breakfast he and i and brother jd
[2:13:26] and
[2:13:27] he cracked a little bit of that open and
[2:13:28] man i've been feasting on it all week
[2:13:30] long i've been
[2:13:31] i got on my bible study and started
[2:13:33] preaching some of that stuff about the
[2:13:35] token man it was tremendous
[2:13:37] friends that you know when you when you
[2:13:39] think about
[2:13:41] every time in the bible that god is
[2:13:44] going to bring somebody
[2:13:48] to a position of greatness like he did
[2:13:51] to abraham like he did to jacob like he
[2:13:53] did
[2:13:53] whoever it was or all the way to our day
[2:13:56] brother branham
[2:13:57] or to you and i and he's taking us to
[2:14:00] the highest echelon that's ever
[2:14:02] been achieved a global rapture of his
[2:14:05] bride
[2:14:06] so whenever he's going to do something
[2:14:08] like that he always if you look in the
[2:14:10] scripture he
[2:14:11] always starts him on a journey
[2:14:16] you know he comes to i thought that was
[2:14:19] so remarkable that abraham already had
[2:14:20] abraham had already invested 25 years in
[2:14:23] believing
[2:14:24] that he would be the father of many
[2:14:26] nations and now
[2:14:28] the one element he's got one element
[2:14:30] after 25 years to make that happen he's
[2:14:32] got a child
[2:14:33] and now the single element that took 25
[2:14:36] years to even arrive and now
[2:14:37] years of life and now that's about to be
[2:14:40] lost
[2:14:41] but you know abraham believed god
[2:14:44] and his faith didn't waver even when he
[2:14:47] says
[2:14:48] the lad and i will go and the lad and i
[2:14:50] will return
[2:14:51] and what a faith that he knew
[2:14:54] that even if he slew him god would have
[2:14:56] to raise him up because he was operating
[2:14:57] on a promise
[2:14:58] and after 25 years he still wasn't
[2:15:02] done with his journey was he jacob comes
[2:15:05] after a lot of life already and dealing
[2:15:09] with esau and dealing with the
[2:15:10] the porridge and you know the having to
[2:15:14] run from esau and
[2:15:15] in the middle of the night it comes to
[2:15:18] bethel
[2:15:19] house it's going to be it's going to be
[2:15:20] the house of god
[2:15:22] and god says now i'm sending you on a
[2:15:25] journey and this here's the part that's
[2:15:27] going to be true every time
[2:15:29] i'm sending you on a journey and when
[2:15:32] you get back
[2:15:33] to this to this place you're gonna know
[2:15:36] you've been on a journey
[2:15:37] but here's what i want you to know jacob
[2:15:39] i will be with you
[2:15:41] every step of the way and i will
[2:15:45] never leave you i will not forsake you
[2:15:48] that's what that word leave means i
[2:15:50] won't fail
[2:15:52] i won't forsake i won't abandon you
[2:15:55] you know and you know i thought about
[2:15:58] the message coming in this hour and the
[2:16:01] mighty angel descending
[2:16:02] once he came to do what to take a bride
[2:16:07] to her perfection you know what his
[2:16:08] message is
[2:16:09] now you're going on a journey bride and
[2:16:11] we've been on a journey
[2:16:13] for these last 50 plus 60 years since
[2:16:15] the opening of the seals
[2:16:17] but you know what he says now that i'm
[2:16:19] here i won't leave you until we're done
[2:16:23] and we're all it gives me new meaning
[2:16:26] you know how many times we've said we're
[2:16:27] all in this thing together well i hope
[2:16:30] you realize
