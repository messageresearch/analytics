already got it up here amen well I tell you what the devil has sure fought and um we're going to go to prayer for some prayer requests that came in tonight and uh it's not our Wednesday night prayer meeting per se however it's our midweek and so I've had a couple of requests come in and we sure have a lot of people to pray for probably about a third of the assembly amen has just uh contracted that uh bug going around and some of you in here have had it and you've recovered from it and some are in the throws of it and um sister sweetheart I left her under covers running a fever so amen just want to be praying for her am man I miss her not being here tonight and um many others I I probably got more than half a dozen uh notes today asking for prayer so they wouldn't be able to make it uh sick amen been sick for a number of days and uh still going on so amen but I'm glad we made it tonight amen I'm glad you're here it's a very special service amen the last night of this year wow hard to believe isn't it amen praise the Lord we're not going to uh delay we want to move right along and I want to invite you to Second Peter chapter 3 amen second Peter chapter 3 I'm going to read a familiar um some familiar verses to us that I thought was appropriate how the Lord has moved on my heart I was talking to Brother Bruce Paris and sister Linda on the way to church and and uh he was happy to hear I said you know I was going to just kind of I had a real FastTrack plan Amen to go through the service tonight and uh I said but the Lord kind of put his hand on me Dan and said hold on a second who you work for you or me I said okay sir I work for you said well I got some things I'd like to say so get a pencil and paper I thought well you mean like a pencil and paper but actually it was in my mind the Lord uh you ever had you ever heard those the people who write songs and say this song the whole song came to me and just like fell out of the heavens and I wrote the whole thing down in 10 minutes and I've done that I've had I've had the whole concept of sermons drop out of the heavens on me like that and in 10 minutes get a 10p part series amen and it it sometimes it'll come like that you just never know but uh I'm not going to preach a regular sermon tonight now I've have proved that I can do that on Christmas weekend Sunday G man 28 minutes 28 minutes amen praise the Lord I'm brother Jason I'm not brother Matt I actually can do that amen praise the Lord since he's not here we talk about him amen he's uh preaching I think the winter youth retreat up in Tennessee so but I'm going to I want to I want to give you what's on my heart tonight will that be all right and uh we'll uh probably 15 or 20 minutes we'll pull the shoot and stand on the breaks and uh we'll go on with our communion and foot Washing Service happy to have some friends here with us tonight God bless you brother happy to have you seem like you're familiar seem like I already to know you somehow okay I know I know your whole family amen happy to have brother mcfaden here today um amen so been knowing that family for quite a while amen second Peter chap 3 verse 9 the Lord is not slack concerning his promise aren't you glad as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to usw not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up it's pretty graphic seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness I think that is one of the most relevant questions he could ask having just said that everything's going to just look like it's going to be completely annihilated now we know brother brandham uh taught taught us in in the future home it's not Annihilation but but it looks like it'll be annihilated but the Earth is an eternal attribute of God and it can never be annihilated and so it's going to be renovated but but the the language here a fervent Heat and the works are burned up and the elements melt my goodness so so he says all of these things are going to be dissolved what manner of persons that being said that being true how ought we to be living see looking looking for here here he is going to have give you half your answer looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness I think Peter has certainly assumed that we're not going to be part of the fervent heat dissolving elements passing away that when all of that happens somebody's still going to be alive amen wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless my that's a tall order let's pray father we thank you for your word thank you for the message that's upon my heart thank you for the Gathering of the people here tonight Lord and we're coming to you with a special prayer requests Lord we have special requests that have come in from sister Melissa Lord concerning the safe return of of of Jessica Lord coming back in from South America she has also a prayer for a second grade student unexpectedly lost a mother uh extremely close and um and so there's a lot of broken heart hearts there Lord we're asking for your mercy father in that case Lord there were other requests that came in and you know all about them and master we have a number of people in the assembly that are sick Lord and we're asking for your divine mercy upon their lives now help them Father to be recovered quickly we pray you bless us now tonight in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated tonight is a special service because it is the uh we it's the night that we choose uh to take and and recognition of the Lord's Passover you know Jesus told his disciples when he came to that to that third Passover there in his ministry and he said I have desired to have this Passover with you he had already had in his ministry he had Passover his whole life uh but after he began his ministry he only had a an Earthly Ministry of three and a half years under a Roman Calendar three years under a Jewish calendar uh and so he had three Passover times with his disciples in his ministry and when he came to the last when he said I have desired with a great desire to have this Passover to come to the table and and you know the disciples you know they were given instructions go here and and ask and inquire where where will the Lord have his supper and they'll take you and they'll show you a room and you'll make ready uh for our supper and so you know this is exactly why that we don't we don't take it in the daytime because it wasn't the Lord's morning meal wasn't a Noonday meal it wasn't an afternoon meal it was an evening uh it was an evening time supper and so we realize that uh the Passover there came uh from the Old Testament when the death angel passed through and God delivered Israel out of Egypt and so that was a very special time for them and the Lord's Passover was very special we are coming tonight to the Lord's table you say well it's just a table you probably bought it at a super store and and but but you know we're going to consecrate this table we're going to dedicate this and we're going to consecrate the elements of the Lord's Supper the bread and the wine and it was it was carefully thought through how to bring these elements together and we don't just throw them away that you're not allowed to do that even if there's bread left over it has to actually be burned before the next morning light or it has to be consumed or it has to be buried and so so so you realize that we we're we don't go as the as the Roman system that says it's the actual body of the Lord which if they would just think that through they would realize that's not true because you're the body of the Lord I'm the body of the Lord and so we realize that we're not going to reduce God down uh you know they they reduce him down to a wafer and people realize they they think they eat that wafer and they take in Christ into themselves I'm so glad that it's more Supernatural than that and because if it was just a wafer then it's you know while that's in my body whatever nutrients I could get out of it I could get out of it but I want something that feeds me every day I want something that surges through me and gives me life in it and so I you know we were having that discussion there uh Brother Bruce and sister Linda and I about the whole reason of fermented uh wine why don't why don't we use just the unfermented grape juice because you don't you don't put you can put grape Ju s old bottles all day long it doesn't have any life in it there's no fermentation going on but when something is fermented has life and it it's going to burst forward and so so we we wouldn't want to we wouldn't want to partake of something that would represent dead denominationalism I want to represent something that has life in it so we're going to come to his table here shortly in a few minutes and you know I I I have it on my heart to ask you tonight as the Lord be began to speak to me today you know what are the reflections of our mind and where is your heart tonight and where will it be when you approach the Lord's table what will be the thoughts of your heart and how how do you see it how do you view it you know if you if you if you just have um so Gideon you don't have it it's it's on YouTube I see okay well we'll just forgo it then no worries when you when you approach the table of the Lord I think that it behooves us to consider you know what does it mean to me what and every person individually should ask themselves a question question tonight what does it mean to me tonight on this special night in this special service with this special activity I want to suggest to you today that you're not only at a special service not only do we have a special activity but I want to ask you you know uh what do you think about the end of this very special year was out for a walk today and I I felt the Lord speaking to my heart and through the morning I'd been pondering some different things and studying and and I I left the house it was a beautiful day and I wanted to take a walk and I kind of felt like I just want to be out under the under God's heaven and talk to him from my heart and and and and this is kind of where this whole burden That Came Upon me and I and I thought about it as a special year now you might say and you might fairly ask the question what is so special about this year perhaps it didn't maybe it doesn't feel all that special to you I don't know what any of us might could stand up in here tonight and say special nothing this year you know I had a I had this disappointment and I had that disappointment I I failed to realize this expectation and I I had this tragedy or I had this this problem and and you know I don't know that that what there would be to say about this year that would make it so special well could could I just tell you and and that's a fair question but you know I thought to myself when the Lord began to say you know what's going to be on your heart when you come to my table at this special time and and and I and I say to you tonight this was indeed a special year you say brother Jason what's so special about it well if for no other reason uh it's special special in that it's a year that had never existed until it dawned and all the history of humankind it had never existed this year had never been in the earth in all the time and and and not only that but a year that in passing will never be repeated again ever to infinity and beyond [Laughter] it'll never be repeated it's never existed it'll never be repeated I I'm GNA tell you something friends as I begin to ponder that I thought lord it's maybe it's a little more special than I gave it credit for and when I thought about that then I I took some time to think about how did I use the time of my special year how did I use it and how did I more more perfectly how did I utilize the time that God gave me cuz he didn't have to I lived the entire year and here it is the last night of the year and I'm still alive and you're still alive and we're still in it you don't know if you'll be in the next year you might not be there's many of people who will not see the morning's light and I trust that we all will and I trust that this coming weekend we'll all see all your lovely faces again but but that that's not my point my point is we are at the last hours of a very special year and we need to ask ourselves how did I use my time in this very special year that's passing and I have to say that when I pondered that I perhaps like you no doubt I had many mixed emotions as as as probably we all would perhaps but you know there because there's there's always um I suppose a great deal of uncertainty as to as to if nothing else as to what everything meant there are things that that you could list today I could have every one of us stand up and say go down a list and tell me the Milestones that happened to you in a year and only tell me the ones that you understand what was happening and why it happened I promise you wouldn't tell me all your happenings because we come to the end of a whole year and there are things that we even to this moment I'm getting ready to end this year and there are things in it I don't know why it happened perhaps I'll understand it better by and by perhaps the Lord will reveal it you know brother brandham said it like this he said God doesn't even tell His prophets everything right and it prophets don't tell the people everything you don't know the deep thoughts and ponderings of my heart I don't know yours God knows them I'm glad God knows them I'm glad I have a person I can just be completely honest with and I thought to myself Lord in the midst of all the times of uncertainty and all the things that I could point to that I'm very uncertain about and I don't know why this happened and I don't know why that happened but I said but Lord tonight when I come to your table here's something I'm very certain about at the end of this year I am still a Christian and I am still in love with you and still a believer of the word that you gave us in this hour and I said Lord I want to come to your table clean I want to have a clean mind and a clean heart and clean motives and clean objectives and I want to have clean gratitude to say whatever happened and whatever even I don't understand why it happened and maybe it wasn't always good but I know he loves me and I know he cares about me Hallelujah that's what I thought on this last special day of this very special Year good deal good deal G all right we'll use it I'll let you know you know we can we can look around in the world that we live in the world and its condition and can I just be real transparent parent tonight is that okay if I just be real honest I'm going to I'm going to help you be honest I'm going to say some things that you might not want to say out loud and I'm going to say it out loud for you okay we look around on the world and its condition and uh and sometimes wonder if the Lord has maybe left us here too long the world is becoming increasingly hopeless with each New Year and very often times we if we be honest we wonder how is it even continuing yes amen the madness is is is everywhere and you just think it can't go on much longer but I remember thinking that 5 10 years ago also and here we are approaching 2025 there's I promise you there's no one in the message that thought we would be at 2025 I can promise you none of those early uh you know my my parents and and and and the ones of that age group never in a million years but yet here we are and the world has not gotten better it hasn't even leveled off it's getting worse and worse and worse and you say Lord what in the world are you waiting for how how is this world even continuing to exist and how is it that you've still left us here but I want to say to you tonight the Lord is not slack concerning his promisen he's only patient waiting what is he waiting for he's he's waiting for that last name he's going to fill that role I'm here to tell you he's going to fill that role and and I I'm so glad for that tonight because I've got faith that I know some people who aren't on who aren't ready yet but they're going to be ready and if the Lord had a came at another year they would had a chance I'm glad tonight they still have a chance he must fill the role he's going to fill the role you know I thought it was rather amusing I amused myself thinking about it I thought you know yeah the Lord is patient he he doesn't wish anyone to be lost and he's he don't count him as slack he's not slack like the world counts slackness he's patient he's waiting for that last one to come in you know what if you were that last person you know I think Peter knew it'd be a problem with us I don't think we should feel bad to feel that way like Lord can we just be done can we just get on with it Heaven is such a beautiful place and we got so many loved ones over there but I got loved ones here that I want to be I want them to be over there oh and I just thought you know what if I was that very last person you know if I was that last person and I was still outside the fold I wouldn't want you to be in too big a hurry you know I I if I was the last person and you know when when morning Stars sang together and and sons of God shouted for joy and you know and we know and we we've taught on it before and it's somewhat ambiguous we don't have all the answers to it we don't know we we know that in the thoughts of God you existed we also know his thoughts are real we also know that there were morning stars that sang together and sons of God shouted for joy we know that the prophet talked about how you know you you were you existed before there was Stardust you existed and he started he makes various statements and parts of other statements and you kind of put them all together to get a narrative and he talks about you don't remember it now there I think in one place I read he said like a veil over your memory someday that Veil will be taken away so I don't know friends but but here but let me let me just let me just suppose for just a moment give me a little of license here that if there was a time when when we all were there and we were all morning stars and we were Suns and daughters and we were shouting for joy and brother brandham says the reason you were shouting is because you were you saw the Plan of Redemption and you realize what we're going to go to the Earth he's going to go we're going to go there's going to be this whole Redemption thing and then we're all going to come back here I'm here to tell you if I'd have been in that group and you and with you and then and then we' have went around around and it would have come back around to me and said guess what uh what you're you're going to be the last one okay well how's that going to work don't worry you won't get left but but there's going to be a veil over our memory we won't know that that's true but God's got it all in control don't worry but I'm here to tell you something friends and that may sound kooky to you but let me just play it out because this is the way it went into my mind today I thought if if I was that person and there's a veil over my over my memory and I'm the last one to go into the book I want to say to you all hey slow down don't you leave here without me oh I want to be in that number I want to be part of that redeemed family of God Amen when all y'all stars were singing and shouting I'd be the person I'd be the one going from person to person saying hey don't you try to leave without me yeah we're gonna have a veil we won't remember none of this but I'm telling you now we get back here and the veil is lifted you're going to remember I said to you don't you leave without me don't you even try amen you know Jesus standing at the temple there in Jerusalem that Herod built and he looked up looked upon it and said to the people and astonishing statement he said tear this Temple down and in 3 days I'll build it back that seemed insane and those people said all the you know I forget how many decades we were in building this and you by yourself it took thousands of people decades and you by yourself you're going to build it in three days now you know no wonder we said you've got a devil you're crazy but the Bible says what they didn't realize is is that he wasn't talking about that Temple cuz that Temple didn't matter the only Temple that mattered was the one he was standing in and it was going to be given on behalf of his family as a sacrifice so when when you think that through very deeply you realize that Jesus was going to allow his Temple to be torn down tear this tear this Temple down he was literally going to allow himself to be torn down to so that he could rebuild it for Resurrection amen amen that's what he was saying and they said you you're you're you we'll never let anyone hurt you and he said except a corn of wheat die it abideth alone and then he said I go away oh no what don't leave where you're going no no no it's better for you that I go because if I don't go he won't come see who you he huh who won't come I won't come I thought you're going yes but I will come to you I will live inside you so so I am this Temple is going to be torn down and and and and I'm tearing it down so that I can build it back for Resurrection because I don't want to be in heaven by myself I want a kingdom I want a family amen sometimes the Lord has to tear down things in our lives sometimes it's not just things in our lives sometimes it's our whole life yes amen sometimes we get so entrenched in our own in our own way and going our own Direction and we're we're nowhere near where God desires us to be and so a lot of times he has to start tearing things down amen might tear you know could be very heartbreaking stuff and and and and and and what to me what always is the saddest part when I see see the Lord having to use a a a supreme love a corrective love it's not judgment it's corrective love and when you see God have to do it that way to me always the saddest notion in my mind is that it need not have been and you suffered and it need not have been you you did it needlessly he was always going to win he was always going to get you and and and why did you why did you make yourself go the harder way and come the hard way I don't know friends we're just we're just broken humans it's all I can say but I'm glad somebody knows how to rebuild me if he has to tear me down and he's had to tear me down many of times he's had to tear down things in my life he's had to tear down things in your life sometimes he's had there's people who could testify and say my life was so in the left and right field I was so far off the straight and narrow he didn't have to just tear down parts of my life he had to tear my entire life to the ground yes amen amen so he could completely rebuild it he does it so that he can build things back he does it just like himself to build our life back for the resurrection amen these are the things get in have it let's go with it these are the things put it up and I'll tell you when to when to start these are the things that were on my mind today when I thought about coming to his table I want you to think about these things tonight friends I want it that when you come to his table tonight you'll realize that it's a it's maybe more special than you planned for it to be in your mind I want you to have a greater reality a greater sense of awareness that you're ending a year and and we're we're going to see this year pass away and we're going to see another year come in and you know if I have things that are passing with this passing year then there's a couple of things that I want I want to let it pass with the year I want to commit it to God ask him to forgive me ask him to help me and say Lord let it pass from me and let it pass with the passing year and in the New Year I'm coming to your table tonight I'm going to make a dedication I'm going to make a fresh start I'm just hours in the tail end of this last special year and I want to make the special year of next year that has a year that's never been yeah amen and every day in it will never be again you say Lord help me to appreciate your word your life your love when I come to your table tonight let me come clean let me come pure of mind pure of heart pure of purpose let my let my desires be your desires is that can you do that tonight friends amen I love this song this young man I think it's a and his sister I believe they sang this song and um it's very very good the young man can hardly get through it he's so broken with the emotion of it but I want you just to listen to the words it's very beautiful they did it very beautiful was at our camp I don't remember which year I think year before last maybe and uh best I can remember but it's it's talking about he carried me to to his table let's let's have it Gideon [Music] wounded and forsaken I was shattered by the Fall broken and forgotten feeling lost and Al alone summoned by the king to the Master's courts lifted by the s crad in his arm I was carried to the table seated where I don't [Music] belong car to the [Music] table Away by [Music] and I don't see my Brokenness anymore when I'm see table of the Lord I was car to the table the table Lord fting thoughts of fear wondering why he called my name am I good enough to share this cup this world has L me Weaver in my weakness the Savior called my name and it is presence I'm healing on sh as I'm car to the table oh seated where I don't belong car to the table Swept Away PR by his love and I don't see my Brokenness anymore when I'm SE at the table of the Lord I was carried to the [Music] table the table of the Lord car to the [Music] table SE where I don't belong Carri to the table Swept Away by is love and I don't see my Brokenness anymore when I'm SE at the table of the Lord car to the [Music] table the table of the [Music] Lord and carry to the [Music] table the table of the [Music] [Applause] Lord praise the Lord Lord that wonderful amen amen I want to um have you stand with me and turn to First Corinthians 11 Gideon will go to the Y quote next Paul's speaking in 1 Corinthians 11: 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sued saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as of as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup one moment Luther and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily we're going to wait just a second wherefore whoo ever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup I I over the years when I read that passage I never read it and Come Away with a sense of for boing that you really shouldn't come up here what you should do is go before the Lord and let the lord judge your heart repent of anything wrong clear clear it with God clear your heart if anything but between you

into the heart of Judas scariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he riseth from supper laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord does thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus saith to him he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every Whip and you're clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you
