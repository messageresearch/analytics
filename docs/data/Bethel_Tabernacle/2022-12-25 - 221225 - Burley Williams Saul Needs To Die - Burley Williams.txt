to visit all of us who are here and we have here's an example of it today we have visitors and for that reason I very intentionally always make sure I'm speaking and I never give up I've never given up my Sunday Christmas service ever uh and that's and that's on purpose and but we have a very unusual one today because the Lord prompted me strongly to ask our dear friend and family member brother Burley to speak for us today so I am looking forward eagerly to the content of what will come across this desk today I want you to open your hearts and Minds because I didn't expect to do it I had a sermon I lined up wanted to preach it bad and uh amen we've got visitors here today so I know it's probably a shock to our visitors that I'm not going to be speaking but neither is brother Burley the Lord is going to be speaking amen so you just take it from me if you have confidence in brother Jason I felt directly directly very unusually so directly prompted to have brother Burley he tried to get out of it and he tried every way to get out of it but I said brother Burley it's it's the will of the Lord I know it as good as anything happy to have Niecy here in the family amen God bless you

you this morning oh God we didn't come to hear from a man but Lord we all privileged people to be able to assemble here this morning around the words of life around the revealed word of the hour oh God that have you have sunk to us so that everything could be made clear we don't have to wonder we don't have to stumble but Lord we can see plainly because the evening light has come so father we just now just commit everything into our hands so father we give you the glory in the name of Jesus Christ praise the Lord God bless you this evening hey man we was like let's just uh go ahead and get into the word uh I appreciate brother Jason and he's telling the truth I really tried to get out of it still heals still care all you have to do say the word brother Burley let me just go ahead I I don't have a preacher's Edge I don't I really just came to get away with my family and uh but by God's grace but we're we're here amen so uh we uh would like to turn into our Bibles to uh First Corinthians 15. and uh appreciate the musicians and uh First Corinthians chapter 15. I I've been studying something in the last three days oh unusual a little strange but couldn't seem to get away from it but we'll just see what the Lord will do First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 31 he said I protest by rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our lord I Die daily amen you may be seated and also like to turn to First Samuel chapter 8. once again appreciate brother Jason for having us and uh pray that the Lord will bless you in this word this morning First Corinthians chapter I mean first Samuel chapter eight I would like to say um as we go into the scripture just the last few months of many things done took place I don't see in God do some wonderful things in my life we've been through a lot of uh trials and hard trials but you know one thing about trials if you deal with it correctly they only strengthen you they don't break you they only strengthen you so we thank God for that and I would just give a I'm just going to give a little just a little quick testimony try to blend it in with my service here amen uh August 3rd I had a accident pretty bad accident happened to my eye and uh and and and who was on the job working anybody here in construction you know sometimes you can get into a hurry sometimes and don't put your safety glasses on and just think that you're a Superman or something and just go but you know it was an unusual day I actually had a sermon it was a Wednesday I had a sermon on my heart and I was going to preach on eyes and it was just burning me up and I wanted to preach on my eyes I actually had started preaching in that on the weekend at Mike Wall's church but when I got that home that Wednesday I just wanted to preach on eyes and then I was the granite guys was coming I had to shoot some quarter around down but this particular quarter round was Walnut so it's hard and uh when I shot I shot the gun a couple times Nails kind of flew I just keep going God was giving me my warning then I believe but I just kept going but then all of a sudden I shot and Bam hit me right in the eye it literally felt like somebody drew their hand back far as they can get it and just punched me and so I failed when I was already down and uh so the guy that was working with me he said you're all right I said I think so until I got up when I got up and when I opened my eye the nail was still in there and I told him I said man I said I think he's still in there I said can you pull it out for me and he came up to me he said let me see it and I showed it to him he said nah I don't think I'm gonna pull that out I said wow I said so what I did I took a selfie because I actually wanted to see where the nail was I was gonna pull it out myself so when I took a selfie and I looked at the picture and I seen the nail I said no I'm not gonna pull that out so that's when I called 9-1-1 and uh when the paramedics come and get me uh they looked at it and they said you're a pretty tough fella because I wasn't panicking screaming or nothing I said well yeah I said well okay when they carried me to the doctor when I got into it the paramedics got me there uh you know I knew I knew it was a reason for everything but when I was in there the doctor came down and people would cut the paramedic they put I could put a cup over my eye and taped it up so that I couldn't hit it so the doctor come in there and said let me take this off and he took it off and he looked in there and he said oh you know when people start going oh oh my God if you ain't careful you listen to that it just pulls you down so uh and then out of all the things the doctor can say he said yo I look bad he said I just removed the man uh he's I just come from removing a man's eye and I'm like really really you're gonna say something like that but anyway I just stayed there and then because on the way to the hospital I was actually talking to the paramedics about I was going to preach on eyes so evidently they told the doctor so when they told the doctor he said I don't understand you're a preacher no no let me back back so I asked the doctor I said what I said can we get this over with I said how long this is going to take he said well you got somewhere to go I said actually I do got somewhere to go I said I want to preach tonight he said well I don't I don't think you're going to be able to do that he said I understood you was talking about eyes I said yeah yeah I was going to preach on my eyes tonight I said that's what I was going to preach on and he said well you can preach to me he probably shouldn't have said that because this is what I want to say God speaks to you in different things in your life something that you can relate to he used your surround he used surroundings things you familiar with he used those things to get your attention so this is how this message came up with eyes so I began to talk to the doctor I said I'm telling him what I'm telling you I said God speaks I said sir he speaks to you you're a doctor I said God could use medical terms to catch your attention he said true true I said he used carpentry terms he can speak to me do carpentry terms he said okay I said well let me give you an example how God works if you know Peter in the Bible was an expert fisherman and I said then one night they toilet all night they didn't catch nothing and I said Jesus told them to cast their net to the right I said now Jesus was doing something to catch Peter's attention I said now Peter could have said who does this man think he is I'm an expert fisherman he's not a fisherman and he gonna tell me to cast The Net to the right which I know ain't nothing there but that ain't what Jesus was doing he was using that because he wanted to catch Peter's attention and then Peter said nevertheless at Thy word and when you wrote a story and Peter did it and they come out with abundance of fish I said so Jesus used that sir to catch Peter's attention I said the same thing with Jonah the people in that time they worship a fish God I said so God used prepared a special fish to let Jonah I said what more would make the people more eager to listen see in their so-called God spit a man out and they're going to say wow this have to be of God our God sinning is a man I said no the real God was sending them a man but he used something they could relate to and the doctor said that is that's that's good that's good I said so God speaks to us through terminology so we can understand him and then he said and I said now sir I said but what I was going to preach on is Revelation chapter 3. I said dealing with the Revel uh the layout of the sea in church age he said well we're actually studying that now amongst the doctors I said okay I said well I said do you understand that we're in an age are called laodicea he said okay I said we're in this age it's allowed to see an age I said but if you listen to the scriptures what God was saying he's talking about delay of the sins and so forth that he wanted to anoint their eyes with Isaiah he said right now that's what I was going to preach on I sound what sparked my attention in the church aid book brother Branham talked about laodicea how advanced they were in medical and he said the great medical institutions and so forth so that would sparked me to go study it I went and looked up the history of laodicea and can and then I come to find out one medical thing that they advanced in it was ourselves and people would travel they say in history people would come from all sorts of parts of the world they said it was like Miracles how they would do things miraculously when people would come there they would use this Asaf and they were opening people's eyes and people could see I said so sir God told them I want to know your eye what I said I said so God used something in that age they was familiar with I said but he was letting them know you can open the eyes on people in medical terms but you know what your situation is you need some eye sound from me to open your spiritual eyes wow and I said so doctor so I said the age that we're living in there's no science there's no medicine there's nothing can open your spiritual eyes like the word of God and I said not even the things that you can do you adopted I said still spiritually you can help me physically but you cannot do what our Lord can do what he's offering to this age I said he has given us a word in this age so our eyes could be open so that we can see him and I said sir and I believe with all of my heart right now God allowed this to happen to me just to preach to you goodness and he said you are he said I think you are right so I sat down on a recovery I mean operating get ready to send me into the operating room preaching the gospel so that gave me peace yeah that this is for a purpose this is for a reason amen and then I remember the prophet I was listening to him this morning brother by him said that's one thing the devil I want to do he want to put out your right eye he said because that's your spiritual eye but he hit me in my left eye so I still had my right eye all right so the devil lost all right I won he lost so the devil actually tried to because uh I went completely blind uh the next day I could not see I was just completely blind some from just a month ago I wasn't able to see out of my left eye at all until I had surgery because a cataract had grown over and I read everything the prophet said about cataracts he said it comes from a bruise I said yeah I got a bruise and a cataract grew over it and then the devil tried to get me to accept he said well at least you can see with one eye once you be happy with that I said Satan that's a lie I'm gonna get both of them back all right that's it because they belong to me so and all of those things what happened to me it actually brought me closer to the Lord Jesus Christ I'm so thankful I I uh uh the calls that I got the messages that I got I didn't realize a lot of people know me I really didn't and I just thought my phone going crazy and it humbled me like it really humbled me people say we're praying for you praying for you and and I really appreciate that and you know we had surgery I guess it was a month ago and when I come out of the surgery that even the eye doctor told me he said I was expecting the worst for you he said but God hand is upon you but I do know it was nothing but the prayer of the saints that allowed me to be able to go through what I went through and then on the top of all of that I had surgery in my mouth two weeks after the eye surgery I got eight implants put in my mouth and it was just been a dramatic situation but I've been drawn closer to God in all of it because you know even it was rough I taught my own church and you know sometimes uh people can talk to you and and don't help you it was right in the church don't help you when you're going through something somebody go that don't help that don't help I told my church don't don't be old poor poor brother birdless don't do me like that I don't like doing that I see it's the same thing dealing with a child if you get another child if that child was to fall if you wasn't to go oh oh no they're gonna stop pause look at you then they'll cry you helped him cry yeah but if that child was to fall you could get up champ you talk he'll just brush it off yeah you know yeah yeah they're brushing off so it's the same thing when it comes to a Christian Life sometimes we feel so sorry for one another till we weaken one another fate we must encourage one another not weaken one another encourage one another say brother I'm praying for you not only I'm praying for you I'm praying with you amen that's strengthening one another can we say praise the Lord so in all of these things uh I begin to learn to Die daily and God has really blessed me and he has really helped me but I want to just preach something and I'll try not to go along and and it's a it's a it's a little strange subject but you have to really listen to the whole thing to the end then you'll see what God has put upon my heart I want to take a subject and I want to title it Saul which we're going to read here in first time you ate Saul had to die Saul had to die but I want you to follow why he had to die because we're going to find out Saul even though he was a hindrance to himself he also was a hindrance to the gods Warriors that he had ordained to be Warriors so I want to show you this if you go with me in first Samuel chapter eight I'll try to go fast as I can I I can't really go too hard because I got a lot of pressure still upon my eye and I asked the doctor a couple weeks ago I said can I preach he said yeah you go ahead and preach I said well I ain't kind of like maybe you think he said oh you you really get it yeah let me get it he said well you maybe not want to do that just for a week or so like that but uh so I I'm just gonna kind of hold back a little bit but just I hope the holy spirit will keep your attention not me keeping your attention but I'm not used to going too slow I'm just not used to it but I'm gonna try now we want to talk about Saul but as we talk about Saul you remember in the prophet said scriptures have compound meanings so it depends on what subject you take but I want to take Saul's life as an influence to believers because that's exactly what he was but the good thing about the story of Saul we know even though he got an evil spirit on him he still went to heaven because some people say he went to heaven I said well he had to because Samuel told Saul by this time tomorrow you and your sons going to be where I'm at and we know Samuel went to heaven right so so but but I like that God put it that way because it still can show you can be a born-again believer but you can still get an evil spirit on you some of us don't want to admit things like that but yes you can get spirits on you but the thing of it is when you know when you were born again when the spirit get on you you're going to be convicted God is going to deal with you and you know it's wrong and you're going to get it off of you amen but I want to show you now I'm taking some thoughts even from the message reject the king but I want to build up Saul's life show you how he became the man that he is because Saul the spirit that was on Saul even before the evil spirit come upon him it was a spirit that I'm the big guy I am the man and I'm going to have my way and I'm gonna do what I want to do that Spirit was already on Saul before the evil spirit come on him so I want you to know this in the scripture let's go to verse 7 first Samuel chapter 8 verse one it said and it came to pass when Samuel was old that he made his sons judges over Israel amen now Samuel is a prophet notice he said he made his son judges over Israel God didn't Sam you did so he even showed that a prophet could make a wrong judgment can we say praise the Lord praise the Lord because now we can go a long way in that one but we ain't gonna go there he said now the name of the firstborn was Joel the name of the second avian they were judges in Beersheba and his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside after Luca and took brides and perverted judgments so that goes to show you even because he's a prophet that don't mean his son was going to go his way verse 5 and then it said I'm sorry verse 4 then all the Elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel and to Rhema and said unto him behold they are old thy Sons walk not in thy ways nor make now make us a king to judge us like all the nations one thing we have to understand about the scripture God did not get offended but the children of Israel when they did not want to follow Samuel's son that's what not that didn't offend God what hurt God was that they wanted a king amen but the thing displeased Samuel when Samuel said when they said give us a king to judge us and Samuel prayed unto the Lord and the Lord said it to Sam you're hearkening to the voice of the people and all that they saying today for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that I should not ring over them amen now let's go and uh for example I want to go down I want to go to verse 11. now verse 11 I I put me a little heading to remember my thought uh versus starting at verse 11. Samuel is going to start telling them the type of person that they're going to get before it even happened he already gonna tell them everything that this guy's gonna do but here's what I want you to catch a lot of times when you have a desire for something that desire can actually be your trap God has given them their desire they wanted a king God was already their King but now he's going to give them their desire and Samuel's going to tell them exactly what your desire is going to do to you let's listen to it verse 11. he said this would be the man of King that shall ring over you he will take your sons and appoint them for himself for his chariots to be his Horseman and some shall run before his chariots verse 12 he would appoint unto him captains of a thousands Captain's over 50s and he will set them to ear his ground and to reap his Harvest and to make his instruments of war in his instruments of his chariots for the sake of time and I'm not going to read all of this if you read from verse 12 all the way on down to verse 17 there's a the main word you need to catch in this is h-i-s his it's listed through the whole thing so we're gonna see what the desire of the king that they're getting he ain't it's nothing he wants to do for them everything is listed where he want them to do for him his chariots his armor his his Horseman hit everything take your daughter everything is for his pleasure that's the whole thing with Saul life but you know that comes from somewhere now let's just follow along with me I want to show you where that comes from even in Saul's life go to First Samuel chapter nine verse 1. now there was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish the son of able the son of zero and the son of bachelorette the son of Athea and a benjamite a mighty man of power now this is Saul's daddy a mighty man of power so himself come from a family that got power now watch this right here it's so now let's go to verse two and he had a son whose name was Saul a choice young man a goodly and there was not among the children of Israel a good leader person than he from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people so Saul influence actually comes from his family by being in his family with power now he already a good looking fellow head and shoulders Above the Rest so he already got a spirit of Pride on it that ain't nobody going to tell me nothing I'm gonna do what I want to do but this is what the people chose this is what they wanted and God gave it to them amen so his influence comes from his father no I promise you Saul walked around do y'all know who my dad is my daddy is a man of power so you don't you don't want to mess with me hello this is kind of influence this man already had upon him so it was hidden down in him but eventually it begins to come out that's why he was able to disrespect the word of God what Samuel was telling him because he already got it in him but he just took a time for it to come out but this is what the people wanted can you follow me praise the Lord now if you will I want to turn to First Chronicles chapter 10. I want to tell you Saul had to die but my subtitle my saw had to die let me slow down a little bit remember Saul was over God's Army we can call him the commander-in-chief however you want to put it he was the king these were men Warriors you were finding Chronicles it would list different Warriors in their tribes the gifts that they had each one of them had a different gift each one of them had a battle tactic each one of them specialized in something and Saul was over those gifts now as we go down I want you to stay with my thought I like how God did it he knew they chose the wrong man God knew David was the man but what God had to do first a lot of times when we read about uh uh uh David and Goliath all of that is for a reason remember Saul they had a few victories before they got up to Goliath so the people no doubt watching Saul say oh we got a good King remember what was the purpose for this King to be like the other nations to fight our battle and to judge us that's what the purpose right you remember the prophecy in the message reject the king he said the Holy Spirit God want the Holy Spirit to be your king he wanted the Holy Spirit to be your judge but they wanted Saul but what God had to do to let them see uh at first like they was having victories but God had to get it to a place to let them see what you have chosen it's going to fail you all right so that's why we see when Goliath come up at that time and you see the children of Israel afraid even Saul was afraid himself that was for a purpose that I call that God set them up so he can let the people know this man that you chose is gonna fail you but I'm gonna show you the one that I chose for you so that's why sometimes and things in life when we get so attached to it God have to let it fall because it can be a wrong influence to you he has to let it fall can we say praise the Lord so then we see Saul the king himself afraid the man afraid because they lead it with friends but God had a perfect scenery because God want to bring David on the scene to let them know what I choose for you won't fail you so now let me let the other man fall and that's exactly what happened even though they misunderstood what David was doing because what David was trying to do is unveil God to them unveil Christ to them they missed it because they started lifting up David not God Saul killed this thousand David kills his tens of thousands no David wanted them to see that there is a true Living God in Israel and it's not by my might not my power God done this that's what David was trying to reveal to them and they missed the whole thing amen praise the Lord but as The Story Goes the very men the Warriors of God which is they had different gifts hey I ever thought about it these men was hunting David which saw but they didn't know why they was under an influence so much they didn't realize they're trying to kill David and as long as Saul was alive they couldn't see it but Saul had to die so they could actually see are you with me now let's go to First Chronicles chapter 10. so you got to understand by the spirit of Saul a spirit of Saul will not seek counsel from God it'll seek counsel from all other kind of different areas but it won't seek counsel from God that's a spirit of Saul we'll see that in the scriptures here now verse 10 I mean first Chronicles 10 11. it said when all jebished LED heard all that the Philistine had done to Saul this is where Helen died Bell Rose all the valid man took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his son brought them to jabish and buried their bones under the Oak and jabish fasted seven days Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the Lord even against the word of the Lord which he kept not and also for Action counsel a one that had a familiar Spirit to inquire of it so there's a certain reason God had to wipe him out and not inquired of the Lord that's why I said the spirit of Saul won't seek counsel from the word it won't seek counsel from God but it'll seek counsel from all other places that's a spirit of Saul amen and be quiet inquired not of the Lord therefore he slew him and turned the kingdom into David the son of Jesse now let's go to First Chronicles chapter 11. and let's go to verse one listening all Israel gathered himself to David into Hebrew and saying behold where are thy bones and thy flesh now I want you to watch verse two now what you got to get because I'm trying to not get into all of it the scriptures because it takes too long but I need you to keep this thought these men just talking to David right now all the same men that was hunting David uh chasing him down but now they come to David because Saul is dead by Soul dying extra spiritual Amnesia wow off of them watch what they say verse two they talking to David moreover in time past even when Saul was King thou was he that led us out and brought us in Israel as the Lord thy God said it to thee Thou shalt Feed My People Israel and thou shall be ruler Over My People Israel but when they was hunting David trying to kill David they was not thinking about this but now because their influence had died now they can see what the true perfect will of God is see a song spirit gives you Amnesia a song spirit makes you selfish a song Spirit make you only one what your desires are what feels right to you yeah amen verse three therefore all the Elders of Israel came to Hebrew David made a covenant with them in heaven before the Lord and they anointed David King over Israel according to the word by Samuel now let's go down to verse 23. I think I'm in First Chronicles 12 verse 23. yeah I'll give you the wrong scripture First Chronicles 11 verse 1. that's what I read okay now I want to go to First Chronicles 12 verse 23. they said these are the numbers of the Bands that were ready on to war came to David to Hebrew to turn the kingdom of Saul to him according to the word of the Lord so all of them Warriors when they come to David it was one purpose is to turn the kingdom of Saul over to David according to the word of Lord other words to put everything in this right place these was gifted men God predestinated gifts but under Saul the gifts was used to kill David that's why God sent a message go ahead and send a prophet all right yeah amen the Pentecostals the restoration of the gift true gifts of God but they got to a place they put the gifts over the word it began to hurt the kingdom of God not to help the kingdom of God so God had to give the prophets and the prophets in this day to put the gifts under the right administration of the message of the hour to break the amnesia it's the same parallel actually what I'm reading to you first Chronicles 12 is First Corinthians 12 in the New Testament amen because it deals with gifts just watch just watch first let's go to verse 38. all these Men of War that could keep rain came with a perfect heart to Hebron to make David King over all Israel and all the rest of us of Israel were a one heart to make David King I just really loved that now since Saul had died this influence is gone they're all under David now come together to do what make David King that's why every gift in the body of Christ when it's in the right perspective where it's supposed to be it's going to make Jesus king [Applause] I love it ah I guess I got a good little personal I'm sorry you're at home my song Gotta Die that's all Gotta Die you said what in the world are you talking about oh you got them oh yeah you got them you got to understand what the song is remember his his his oh for himself look what don't happen in ministries every ministering gift is ordained of God to make Jesus king when a minister remember even in the scripture Saul when they told them he Saul had a buddy Club the scripture tells us for his chariots for his Warriors he want everything for them so everything so everything that was in Saul's Circle he wanted to make sure they was taken care of see that's a spirit don't got into the ministry if you're not in my circle you're not in my Soul Caliber you don't care you don't matter see we managed to get to that place their fall got to die and realize every ordained Ministry that is called of God is me for for the body of Christ and not just no one and two or three no we're all supposed to work together by the spirit of God when you see this Minister fight with that one that's what they did what they do it's a Saul Spirit on God in the midst of it and it's on them and they need to let it die amen Hallelujah praise the Lord amen can we keep going yeah just a few more minutes I love it now when you read first Chronicles 12. you're going to read so many different qualifications expertise there are lists with each tribe Warriors had some could throw bows some could throw rocks with different hands and Spears swords it's just naming what each one of them can do but when they was on the song they were trying to kill David but when they come up on the Davis Administration they fought the right Wars so it's the same thing like I would have said earlier that's why this message had to come plenty of gift was out there in Pentecost so brother Brandon faced that challenge coming to those Pentecostals they could it could not deny what happened on the Zuzu Street hell brother Brown the pillar fire came down all of these things happened then he would have to come and tell them but it's more than that so that was a big challenge for him and they looking at him what you mean that's more than that he said it's the word why do you think he began to teach debate on tongues and things like that what was he doing taking it from a denominational Administration bringing it to the right Administration the word the gift supposed to be placed that was a challenge you and I we are thankful we don't have to worry about those things trying to put something in the right place because God knows some of the prophets to do those things we just keep following it because I believe this there are gifted people in every Church you got gifts in your lives but until we humble ourselves let the soul die in our lives let God put us in the right place that we're supposed to be it'll be more effective the way he wanted to be done yes but when you say me my gift my way my desire what I want to do God cannot use you to the potential that he wants to amen that's why we have to look into our own life and find my soul to Saul you gotta go buddy it could be Saul Pride Soul self because that's what that Spirit actually is but what was so interesting to me in first Chronicles 12. when it started listening all of the great things that each Warrior could do that's exciting it's exciting but then as you go down go to verse 39 and they that were with David three days eating and drinking for their Brethren had prepared for them moreover they that would not them even into issachar Zeppelin Natalie brought bread and Ashes on camels and Mews and on oxen and meat milk cake spit Bunches of raisins and wine oil and oxen sheep abundant for there was joy in Israel notice it talking about Nestle and issachar even though they had some uh battle skills but it's talking about other things that they brought bread raisins and cakes see they're going to show everybody's not a fighter everybody's not a dangerous go out and just fight but these when they brought those raisins they brought the bread that was just as much important can we say man so sometimes you can feel it sit in church I ain't doing nothing ain't worth nothing what am I doing I ain't singing I ain't playing the instrument I ain't got no office that ain't got nothing to do with it friends you can bring a cake you can do something so simple and it'll benefit the body of Christ so that's why I wanted to point that out people want to do the great things but what about the small things wow bread cakes of figs Bunches of raisins and there's no less worry praise the Lord because there's a time to eat remember they had to be there the Warriors couldn't fight if they starve him they won't have no energy so you got to have something to feed feed the Warriors so they can fight so every one of us has a part in the body of Jesus Christ amen but you gotta let your soul die your own family you gotta let your soul die in your marriage here's my my huh you gotta let it die it's not what I want to benefit myself what can I do to benefit my wife what can I do to benefit my children what can I do to benefit the church what can I do not all about me Saul has such a selfish Spirit on him you remember when uh they wouldn't tell the uh when uh I'm sorry when one I can't remember the guy's name I think I know do egg but it was another guy Jason you probably can find that scripture for me right quick what part what Saul said it's right there in the scripture with do egg and Paul Saul told them nobody felt sorry for me to tell me that the son of David have come here nobody felt sorry for me when Saul said that look how selfish that man is he was telling the Warriors none of you feel sorry for me did not put some Spirit on there we were sorry we're sorry that's selfish when you get a person always want to act like they are the victim [Applause] every time you hear him talk they are the victim you don't know what people say about me you don't know what I'm going through you just don't understand talking like the victim and a lot of time you find they are the one that is the victimizers are we all right brother we're good yeah I'm just telling you songs and your life got to die if you want God to use all of the potentials that he put in your life correctly them songs they got to die [Music] oh there we go first Samuel 2 20 28 22 and eight he said that all you have conspired against me there's none shows me that my son had made a lead with the son of Jesse there's none of you that is sorry for me a show unto me that my son has stared up my servant against me to lie and wait as this day by them being on the song spirit all those years he was able to influence them to make them fall under his desires his wants so God said those are my gifts those are my Warriors they don't cross Cannon I don't gave them their place of Duty I don't gave them the plot of land those are my words under the wrong influence I gotta get this from up under that I gotta get them under David where they need to be so I can use those gifts the way I want them it's all you got to die [Music] hello what about a preacher I'm only gonna I don't want to go preach for that brother I don't want to go preach there I don't want to preach there but I preached there I preach there that's a song Spirit on you come on you don't made your ministry your personal Ministry and not realize God is the one give it to you and whatever he not you to go he wants you to go you go I'm almost done but my purpose is each one of us can look down in our lives see where's my song the very thing you desire want so bad it could become your influence and that is what hindering your life all along turn me to First Corinthians 12 please you just don't know how bad I want to preach when I had surgery in my mouth and I got excited uh a brother was preaching for me kicked me I think it was brother Jewel preach for me and uh I got up behind him I got so excited next day it's pretty rough if my mouth Satan say uh-huh and I look at you now I said it's okay I'll be back you get your turn right now but I'm gonna be right back I'll come back at you again that's just the way it has to be friends we don't retreat we don't surrender we keep pressing on but we got to Die daily but the prophet said if Paul could say I Die daily he said what about you and me I have to Die daily in the daily the daily diet turns into weeks the weeks turns into months and the months turn into years so clearly continue to keep dying until you just completely die and like the prophet said stay dead amen praise the Lord I'll read the scripture and I'm going to quit God bless you First Corinthians chapter 12. he said now there are diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit if you read first Chronicles 12. it is talk about diversities of warriors but Same Spirit same as a diversity gifts in the body but for them to operate correctly got to fall up under the Same Spirit are you with me and there are different administrations but the same Lord song had a bowl song had a spirit song could make them weapons some couldn't make weapons some know how to use and I'm so thankful they said some of them was expert in all of them but to be under the Same Spirit it would be able to make David King but in our place it'll be able to make Jesus king that's the way it's supposed to be so to me it doesn't matter to me what somebody what how how good they preach which I'll enjoy I always listen where are they trying to take the people right closer to Jesus Christ are closer to themselves that's what I listen for because everything is supposed to be pointed to him people can say whatever they want to say about brother brown but you can't find me one's quote you can't show me one quote where he led us to himself it was always to Jesus Christ always and that's what should be the desire of every Pastor every minister they want to see people get closer to Jesus Christ we're on different levels in churches so I Don't Preach like everybody's on the same level I just preach because wherever you at the holy spirit will meet you there and bring you where you need to be that's God's business to do that it's not my business praise the lord I can't be like well let me just make sure I make it so simple you know what I heard a statement and it to me you got to be careful they asking questions now about the youth what could be done and the concerns of the youth today I can solve that for you if you ain't careful you're gonna start making programs for used then you're gonna get yourself in trouble I used to be a youth I used to be young it was no program for me but one when I come in the message that's come to this altar get the Holy Ghost be born again and grow so you want to make all these programs and forget the main thing get them down to God get them down to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost then most of your worries is gone because they'll grow but if you're going to create a certain thing duh friend that's just jumping over to a song denomination of spirit yeah before you know it a lot of young people what are we going to do preach to him live a life before her tell them about Jesus Christ tell them to study this message tell them to keep believing it you remember the prophet said what the devil want to do with this young generation and get them to lose confidence in the word because if you can get her to lose confidence in the word he got some that's why I tell them study pray what are you doing don't understand it that ain't my issue it ain't the issue do you believe it just believe hurry to today as a minister I read a lot of things I don't understand nothing I'm reading but you know what I don't get discouraged because I know it's the word of God I just believe it and somewhere down the road could be 10 years later somebody could say one thing that I've been pondering for 10 years and all of a sudden the light just turns on and let me tell you something when that light turns on ain't no devil Out of Hell gonna turn it off because now you see it's having confidence and faith in God that he is doing the work in my life I'll just keep pressing on amen praise the Lord I'm gonna quit God bless you I'll look for my jacket but Jason I ain't gonna go more longer bro I got a whole lot more but come on God bless you [Applause] hey man I was sitting behind him going careful careful oh my well you know I told sister Debbie at home this morning I said you know this this service is so unusual to me there was only really a handful of people here who knew brother Burley was going to be ministering today I kind of kept it close to the vest as they say but I told my wife I said you know I I hardly know what to make of it I felt so directly led to the Lord I said but I here's my expectation here's what I'm believing I said when I hear the sermon it'll make sense and I heard it today uh oh my my eyes have seen in my ears I've heard and I understand the mind of the Lord today I tell you what I I so appreciate a sermon like that I don't appreciate you outing me like that to my old church but amen my soul's got to die your Soul's got to die how about how about do we have a mass death of Saul to say oh my you know Saul he was uh he was the son of God but he had all these issues and I tell you if we're gonna I love the I'd never caught that parallel between first Chronicles 12 and First Corinthians 12. that was beautiful that was straight beautiful and um one is to make David King and it had a diversity of gifts A diversity of people and not all of them were Mighty Warriors of battle some of them were just good pastry chefs but everybody had a gift and everybody had a part once Saul got out of the way in the Amnesia evaporated they had one unified thing and that was to make David King when you get into the New Testament Church we all have many diverse gifts but it's all one spirit and that's to make Christ King how many feel unified today to say I want to make the Lord Jesus king over all of our Lives praise the Lord I enjoyed that today brother Burley wasn't it good to be in the house of God tomorrow's good to see come in amen different Brothers coming in God bless you it's been so wonderful to be here today and I guess as far as I know unless I'm mistaken I think Christmas Sundays come around every seventh year I'm guessing but I hope we never have another one I'd like to you know the the the the the Jews when they were dispersed throughout the world before they became a nation and brought back under their own flag uh in 1948 they used to always have a saying every year when when they would come down to their to their feast and they would say next year Jerusalem and they said that for hundreds of years hundreds of years since the dispersion under Rome when they got scattered around the world they always had a testimony and that'd be one of the last things they would say is next year Jerusalem and I didn't say old friends my goodness next year Jerusalem above wouldn't that be wonderful wouldn't it be grand oh my goodness praise the Lord let's sing a few songs come on and join in foreign I'm so happy oh let's sing it before we go now have you accepted the world the revealed word [Music] spoken have you heard that voice oh my did me so much good to hear that voice sing
