a nice time up in North Carolina got a chance to visit sister Debbie's family and some additional time to spend around my father-in-law who I love so much and um have gained so much from his friendship over the years and so trusting the lord to bless him with strength and health amen amen and um we managed to uh Minister was supposed to minister Saturday night and Sunday morning for Brother Scott Smith we got through Saturday night and U when I first got there I did something wrong you know I'm just had it's one of had one of those Revelations I'm not 18 anymore and uh I pulled something in the middle of my back pretty severely and uh but the Lord helped me we had a really nice service Saturday night I had to stand him up Sunday morning amen and he um the devil was attacking in every way possible I would could stand here for a little while and tell you about the whole week um starting on Monday and all week it just uh the devil constantly up to no good trying to prevent it even after I couldn't preach on the Sunday morning brother Scott stood in to his own pull pit and got halfway through his sermon and nearly had a collapse and had to stop himself so just the devil but I told Brother Scott my favorite thing we say it he ain't nobody devil ain't nobody amen amen he don't run nothing but his mouth amen so we we don't we don't sweat him he don't make no decisions about my life and I tell him that all the time I love telling him you don't make no decisions for my life my life and my times are in the hands of my father period in the story that's it case Clos we're done amen and so U he he can he can uh you know jump up and down and uh like my old my my old Uncle used to say get on the roof and do the Hanky Panky for all I care he said he said he don't matter to me amen praise the Lord I have no idea what that is but apparently it's a back in the old day amen somebody older than me would need to know what that is amen praise the Lord God bless you we're going to look right in Genesis 7 I'm going to preach a sermon tonight um titled that which I know I'm going to preach that which I know but I'm going to title it that which I know amen you love him Genesis 7 chap uh chapter 7 verse 1 a little bit lengthy so we'll read through it quickly we're going to catch these first 20 verses we'll let you be seated and the Lord said unto Noah Come Thou and all thy house into the ark for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation of every clean Beast Thou shalt take to thee by sevens the male and his female and of beasts that are not clean by to the male and his female of fouls also of the air by sevens the male and the female to keep seed alive upon the face of all the Earth for yet seven days and I will cause it to rain upon the Earth 40 days and 40 nights and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the Earth and Noah did according to unto all that the Lord commanded him and Noah was 600 years old when the the flood of waters was upon the Earth and Noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him into the ark because of the Waters of the flood of clean beasts and of beasts that are not clean and of fowls and of everything that creepeth upon the earth almost sounds like we're reading the uh the genealogies see uh and there went in verse n there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark male and the female as God had commanded Noah and it came to pass after seven days that the Waters of the flood were upon the Earth in the 600th year of Noah's life in the second month the 17th day of the month the same day were all The Fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of Heaven were open and there's more and the rain was upon the Earth 40 days and 40 nights wait there's more in the selfsame day Noah entered and Sham and ham and japheth the sons of Noah and Noah's wives and the three wives of his sons with them into the ark just making sure you're not missing the details right they and every Beast of after his kind and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth after his kind and every foul of the air uh after his kind and every bird of every sort and they went in unto Noah into the ark two and two of all the flesh wherein is the breath of life and they went in went in male and female and All Flesh as God had commanded him and the Lord shut him in but wait there's more and the flood was 40 days upon the earth and the waters increased and bore up uh the ark and it was lifted up above the earth and the Waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth and the Ark went upon the face of the waters and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the Earth and all the hills that were under the whole Heaven were covered 15 22 feet above the highest mountain peak see 15 cubits upward did the waters Prevail and the mountains were covered that's a lot let's pray father we thank you for your word thank you for this time to be gathered together we ask for your very coveted anointing Lord to be upon it be upon speaker and hearer commit ourselves into your hands in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated you say that's quite a bit of detail there are few places in the Bible that take such pains to give such detail about everything almost to the point of redundancy to where it's just repeating it over and over and every time it repeats it it hangs on to all the details you know it's not just the male and the female and then later and all those animals got on no it's stops again to say no it was the female the male the female it was every creeping thing and it was all the fowls and it was this and then the water and then it rained and then it Rose well then it rained harder and it Rose more and then it rained harder and it Rose more and it Rose and Rose and Rose and Rose till it covered everything even the highest tippy top Mountain amen and everything perished that God had created on the face of the Earth there are a few doctrines it is said in Scripture um few doctrines in scripture are as clearly taught as the global nature of the great flood of Noah's day I'll say that again I thought it was a profound statement few doctrines in scripture are as clearly taught as the global nature of the great flood in Noah's day the precise measurement I I was thinking about this and I just started jotting things down the precise measurements the the details concerning the plan the purpose the cargo the purpose in building it the per why they needed it who authorized it who the builders were how long it took every detail laid out the clarity from God to Moses in recording the events of This Global flood of Noah's day I would say is one of the most detailed set of plans and specs I have personally ever witnessed and I've seen a lot of plans and specs uh in my day I mean think about this Ken Ham built a scaled replica to scale 500 almost 600 and however many feet long and 50 and high and however wide I forget the exact dimensions it's one of it literally he built it up in Kentucky and he the whole thing is built off of 4,000 year old text in the Bible brother brandham comes into 1959 and he comes to a message message that he preaches three times I believe all in 1959 at various places he preaches it the very first time in Jeffersonville be certain of God now I'm preaching tonight on that which I know and I'm and and and this is the real burden of my heart because before I start on this quote let me just say this H having said everything I just said about the ark and the flood and all the plans and all the details and there's hardly anything any story anywhere in the Bible I mean you you'd have to go into Ezekiel describing the temple maybe that would maybe run at a close second maybe John describing the new city and some different things that he saw but but but yet here it is one of the most detailed intricate take your time Moses and write it out in clear terms and just keep writing and I want it thoroughly covered and so much so that there are few doctrines so covered and yet that is one of the most debated doubted teachings in the Bible it's one of the first things that Scholars attack and in fact is it when you know during the the days of exploration of the of the British Empire you know when they came across the Himalayan Mountains it caused such controversy among the theologians of England that they actually begin to say you know Noah's the tale of Noah's Ark cannot be true maybe there was a flood and maybe there was an ark but Global Extinction covering the Himalayas uh-uh didn't happen and I mean that that is to the extent and then they had to then some of the real fire Brands you know came on the scene and said well you know maybe maybe the flood made the Himalayas did you ever think of that and and there's a big debate over it and they even you know the archaeologists or Christian archaeologists think they can prove that by evidence I don't care I I just know what happened there's no doubt in my mind I mean I know that God got tired of the sin and he recycled that's what I know I don't know if the himalayans were C here's what I know there was a Noah and there was a flood and God was done and he wiped everything out that's what I know I know eight Souls got on I know eight Souls got off I know that he was a prophet of God I know he had three sons and I know their names that's what I know it's important to know things especially about God one of the most devastating things that you can do to yourself in self harm is to doubt one word of God's Bible you will do more self harm to yourself in that way and have no one to blame but yourself by doubting one iota of this book Amen brother brandham says and be certain of God now I I want you to catch something here and I'm just going to go ahead and and and and give it to you so you'll catch it right from the beginning you won't wait for the punchline of course we know that the days of Noah are one of the prophetic signs that we are to look for to indicate that the end is near we had the days of Noah and the days of lot and no age had to take them both on except this age and so so so so now when we think about how that this is one of the parallel for us personally then you should be able to go back into the story and find parallels you know that that look like today and you can and you do you find where brother brandham you know comes up how that you know he he in this message he took a text about when Elijah went to the Widow of zarap and how that you know he had resisted Jezebel and and you get Ahab on the throne and you get Jezebel and brother Brenham just starts correlating those with the modern day and says we had a a modern Ahab in the White House and a jezebel system that was behind it right so he he I didn't take that text that he chose here because I I I I had to choose one of the two and I wanted to start with Noah because I'm coming winding uh going to circle back around to it but brother brandham says here for we do not come to the house of the Lord to be seen he's in a prayer now this is important he says we do not come to the house of the Lord to be seen or to see I didn't come to see you you didn't come to see me he says we came to learn he's talking to God in a prayer Lord we came to learn Of Thee I didn't come to see these people they didn't come to see me Lord I came here tonight to learn of thee and to and not just that that's a pretty broad statement but he's going to break it down to learn of thee and to Know Thy nature thy way and thy causes that we might be able Oh you mean there's a there's a purpose behind all yes there's a purpose for you to know his nature there's a purpose for you to know his ways there's a purpose in you knowing his causes there's a purpose for you to learn from him that we might be able to face the problems of Life how many want that with a real Assurance being certain of God and and this is so such a statement that he doesn't even suggest that you have to understand everything about your life or that you have to be certain about everything that you face all you need to do is be certain of God understand his nature learn his ways come here to learn from him and then whatever you face you can be certain because you're certain of God with real Assurance the difference in assurance and real Assurance Assurance is sometimes people tries to boost you up you know and uh it's all kinds of psychological tricks that people can use to try to encourage somebody I'm not speaking good or bad about it it's always good to try to encourage somebody but we're going Beyond just human encouragement I'm talking about do you have Supernatural Faith do you have Supernatural certainty that no matter what you're facing right now or tomorrow you can say whatever it is I don't know but I I'll know God a little more having been in this service tonight brother brandham goes into real life I love how he dramatizes here comes Elijah it must have been a dreadful morning now don't forget because we're correlating to our day brother brandham uses Elijah here also not just Noah not just lot but Elijah dealing with an Ahab and a jezebel and a widow of zerath and the situation on the ground at Ground Zero see it must have been a dreadful morning he's on his way now it was so hot and Dusty and people was in the street starving and the Earth was so hot it was ready to burn I just thought to myself goodness gracious is he talking about some Modern Cosmopolitan City or is he talking about back in the Bible because this sounds to me like you've got an earth that's just so hot and so dry and people in the streets starving and it just looks like the whole world's about to burn down you see Ahab was reigning in Israel at that time and over Israel and he was the wickedest of all the kings of Israel there had never been no King as wicked as Ahab see for for he being taught and know better that's what made it so bad because this is the age of extreme hypocrisy this is the age of blind hypocrisy where people are such Hypocrites they forget they are and go to claim God make a claim on God hey we deserve eternal life can you imagine being so hypocritical that you forget you're a hypocrite and stand in the face of God and say you need to give me eternal life I mean you talk I mean somebody about to have a sunstroke I mean I can't believe that people can get to that and it's not a person here in there it's Global the the book of the The Book of Revelation says the sea gave up its dead and the dead both small and great stood before him on the throne the heavens peeled back and the books are open and another book is open and here comes all of these billions and billions of people and they're they're astonished that they don't get to go to heaven amen that's The Madness of the last day I heard a a Christian guy trying to witness to a very ill-famed young woman who had who had given her body over to terrible things that she was admitting to he's trying to witness to her and she's at admitting you know to things that she does on the internet and and he's asking her you know do you not think about someday if you have children and if they see some of that stuff and and she says I'll have you know I'm a Christian just as much as you are and I have accepted Jesus Christ for my sins just like you and this young woman being nothing more than just than just a a was 110% right in the camera 100 and looked that young man right in the face and said I'll be in heaven for sure this is how insane hypocrisy has become what's caused it Ahab we've got the worst evil in our leadership not just in this country in the world everything you're dealing with is the worst everything you're dealing with is as bad as it's ever been been and as bad as it'll ever be and it's not going to get better or turn around it's only getting worse until say how bad will it get until it moves out into complete self Annihilation God is not going to destroy the world or the people he's going to take the bride home and allow the people to destroy themselves nobody on the day of judgment is going to impune god with Injustice or unfairness amen what was the problem Ahab was on the throne the worst most evil king of all God and every he he continued to disle God he knew better he's the ultimate Authority hypocrite he knew better he failed uh not to he didn't continue to you know he he continued to displease God and everything did although he had a great military system now are we here in America we got a great military system and the people has become very prosperous under his Reign but you cannot displease God and expect to get by very long and then in his wedding instead of marrying among his own people he went over and married a sinner an idolator a worship of Idols he married Jezebel and she was not a Believer and and you you realize that Ahab was in the lineage of Abraham so he's supposed to be a a leader like David he's supposed to represent the word of God he's supposed to represent the law of Moses but you see this is what this is what's happening in the very day and hour that we live in you have a church marrying with the world and still claiming they're the church and brother Brandon just just said this is insanity and the more he proved it in the Bible and the more God demonstrated it in the Supernatural the more they closed the doors on him amen amen tell me that's same thinking no believer should ever marry an unbeliever under no circumstances should always marry Believers see Ahab done this evil thing so so I want to really just just before I jump off of this quote I really want you to understand Ahab done this evil thing so it is it is a it is a dreadful well now we're with the we're at Ahab we're at Jezebel we're at Elijah we're at the zerath Widow so we're at the end time events end time sequence of events amen that's a parallel to where we're at so in the parallel of where we're at one of the worst evils things that can happen is for somebody to claim to be a believer right amen but intermingled with the world making the claim that they're a believer Amen to to call yourself a Christian but to be mingled with the world makes your claim blasphemy it can't get worse you see why we say that we're not of that we don't want to be a part of that we are a separate called out very distinctly different people we have different standards and very proud to have them we don't not oldfashioned there's no old word we're original Hallelujah he marries Jezebel that's that's so many people make the same mistake today Jezebel was a beautiful woman and he fell for what she looked like instead of what she was well that's a tragedy imagine that you married someone for what they look like instead of what they were and you found out that what they were after you married him amen the devil does that teenagers he does that he'll attract you with worldly pleasures and Beauty but he doesn't show you what he really is he's an evil Wicked underhanded stinking liar bent on your destruction don't fall for it she had brought idolatry into the nation has that has it happened friends among the people and the people listen to this the people the priest their ministers all of them they had fell victim oh my they had fell victim to this great popular demand and brother Brandon now if you if you think I'm I'm using you know no no authority to correlate that to this day here's brother brandham and it's the very picture of our country today amen we have fallen under the popular demand friends I I am so averse to the popular demand of this world I am so averse that we would have any semblance any resemblance any notion any Shadow I don't want us to look anything like them I don't want us to act anything like them I don't want you to believe like them I don't want you to think like them I don't want you to react like them we are believers we are sons of the king and we are a chosen generation no doubt that the priest thought it would be all right as long as their government okay it wow we see that happening in churches today I guess it's okay the government said and the Supreme Court said and the president said so I guess we're going to going to have to say too so now here in this correlation story that correlates to our day we have the church and the state perfectly in harmony to do what now we're back in Israel all right you've got the church he said you know the ministers the priest the people everything is going along with the government are all are all holding hands so here we have the church and the State perfectly in harmony to do what to meet the sinful demands of the people amen I mean I mean after all you know it's it's government of the people it's for the people it's by the people and you know I mean although that governing a nation you know as a constitutional republic was not completely novel in 1777 actually Aristotle writes about it in his work on politics but but for the American colonies and our founding fathers what made it unique was what made it an experiment was that it was being envisioned on a much larger scale than had ever thought anyone ever thought could be the irony is that this experimental government of the people was both the greatest strength of the people and simultaneously their greatest vulnerability amen see and Satan knew it and Satan knew it Americans would live under God's unique blessing I mean it's the only way you can account for it if you go back and study the history why should we have suddenly just leaped ahead of the whole world we barely survived a revolution and then we almost then we had to fight him again and then we had a civil war that should have took us to to powder and and and and then we took some land and bought some made a few deals and grew a Navy that and an army and then the next thing you know we're called into World War I and then suddenly this little fledgling country's a superpower and then we're starting to move and Shake in the world and we've got you know we've got battleships we're building and the next thing you know the whole world is looking to us to rescue them in World War II and then we come from there and now we're the the glor super strength and the the financial part of it and technology and Industry and and then this is what Yamamoto knew he said you know I can hold them off they're a sleeping giant I I went to school there I I think he went to Yale and and he said I I know the American people said you you better wipe them out quick you better get them while they're asleep because if you let them wake up that' be it and that's what happened at Pearl Harbor they didn't finish the job and we retooled and we rebuilt and then we became a behemoth and and there was no way that we could build ships faster than they could sink them and so so we we find that that America would live under God's very unique blessing for about 180 years all the way from 1777 all the way up to 1957 when brother brandham said now the nation has turned God down for the last time yeah and from here she'll go worse and worse into judgment and she had but for 180 years she enjoys his unique blessing you have multiple purposes one it would be the purpose of having a land to the furtherest extreme west of the Western Hemisphere itself just so that prophecy could be fulfilled concerning the age as the lightning shineth from the East even unto the West so shall it be at the coming of the son of man you had uh you had to have a nation where the message of the hour you had to have a nation that had position and wealth and influence because this is going to have to be not just a restoration of the entire original message but now it's not just going to be you know and Paul's travels up through turkey and you know Thomas over in India a little bit here and you've got other ones down here and going there but this thing's going to have to go Global it it's going to H we're we're in an age now where you got world wars it's not just Nation Rise Against Nation It's All Nations Against All Nations and now the gospel is going to have to go Global it's going to have to be on the farthest Western Hemisphere nothing is an accident so the message of the hours got to be sent around the world effectively the nation I mean if you just go look at the nation spoken of in Revelation 13 as you can see that it's America and you can see that it's going to be the world's greatest power both financially scientifically militarily I mean it's it it's it's that nation of Revelation 13 that has the financial and Military and technological ability to force the whole world to worship the Beast amen amen go read Revelation 13 this it's this nation in cahoots with with with the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil In Cahoots with the beast in cahoots with the Antichrist that calls fire down from heaven we're not talking the future we're talking what happened over over hirosima and Nagasaki that that was nuclear bombs those were that that was Genesis Power released that was creative power but man don't have to control it and it destroyed but but brother Brenham ties hirosima and Nagasaki right into Revelation 13 that they have power to call fire down out of heaven so that the whole world goes oh we better listen to them see you think this is an accident none of it's an accident amen it's all running at the pace of Prophecy see and and and because of all of that because of the financial strength the scientific technological strength the military strength the industrial might because of all of that then we have the super political power to force the world I mean don't forget that that that the Antichrist system brings the world to heal not because of nukes but because of dollars and gold you understand the wealth of the world they'll they'll take over by Craft they will they will exercise Authority because of the finances this is all prophecy we're not making this up this is prophecy none of this is accidental see so you you know you can you can go all you can you could stay up here till the cows come home and talk about all the all the the conspiracies of the Roth's Childs and this group and the Illuminati and all of that you say Do you believe in any of that stuff I believe in all them Devils oh yeah I also believe that they're all being controlled by prophecy I don't care who met what wear in Hilton Head or Martha's Vineyard I couldn't care less I know who I met Hallelujah I know who's in control I don't worry about a secret room or a secret handshake or closed doors it doesn't matter they don't matter only this matters that's what I know I don't know if all these conspiracies are true but here's what I know amen see it literally this nation was prophesied to be rich and increased with Goods not just this nation but the church not just this church but the spirit on the age would be that we are increased with Goods that was a Telltale sign a nation that was increased with Goods who didn't really deserve to be a nation who who has some of the darkest stains upon its history and nobody wants to talk about it say oh yeah I mean if you talk one thing then the left is mad if you go to this side and then the right is mad and I'm just telling the truth amen so I mean you definitely there's no there's nothing about this nation today that it should be you know it should be allowed to be the Great great world power it is because God has allowed it because Satan has made it that according to this Satan has made it that way and this nation has went along with it well there's some people here who don't go along with it I know I can't change it and I'm not worried about changing it I'm worried about leaving itlu she was prophesy decid to be rich and increased with Goods however another Telltale sign is that she would be woy woefully terribly horribly irreparably backslidden that's prophecy I don't care what the nation thinks of themselves if they say man we are a superpower then that tells me you're backsliding we got all the finances all the military yeah this goes with this if you've got this then you've got this see so you're you're you're and it's not just woefully backslid and you finally according to the prophecy go beyond redemption or you can't even be saved or it won't even matter what you do right see all satan had to do once he got a government of the people for the people of the PE by the people of the people and for the people then all he had to do was gradually over time pervert the hearts of the people with excess sin because it's a government of the people so all he's got to do is pervert the people over time how does he do that he breaks the backbone destroys motherhood brings World War I and women go into the workforce and then then the whole thing is no way to get the genie back in the bottle see he goes into the pull pits and perverts all the pull pits yeah and then he and then then there then the politics didn't stand a chance they never they were e they were corrupt already even in when Godly men were in there you still had politics and it's Evil By Nature because it's men you know ruling over men and so so you've got Fallen men with Fallen hearts and perverted Notions and so so so the sin would eventually in fact his Satan was so successful at ping this off we didn't get here by accident that he would eventually eclip eclipse the sin of all the other much older Nations much older Europe is much older Asia's even much older the the Middle East much older you know but but when you come here to the Western Hemisphere and you've got a relatively young fledgling Nation what are we 250 whatever year I haven't did the math in a while and counted it up but but I mean you know 1776 to now we're just a baby and we're already the most evil oh yeah already the most sinful most powerful richest military of science technology yeah sinful on your way to Hell getting ready to be destroyed you're you're literally becoming the the the right hand of the Beast system by Design don't believe it but it's design yes amen see they don't believe the ark though it's so clear they don't believe what happened in Noah's day but it's so detailed you think Moses made all that up you think John just just like like that man who talked to brother brandom said John must have ate a hot pepper that night and brother R said aren't you ashamed of yourself to think such a thing first of all this was our brother in Christ who suffered you don't make light of it this was sincere he wrot he only wrote what he saw and what he heard see he paid such a high price to do it you're going to doubt it and Scorn at it so the sin would eventually Eclipse all other even much older Nations and brother bramman fact is would comment how that the world and this is historically accurate how that the world formerly had always needed to go to the old European cities we we used he say we used to have to go to Paris right and import our filth we had to go to these Fallen ancient cities because we didn't have that it wasn't in our wasn't in our nucleus it wasn't in our structure it wasn't in our society but we wanted it we wanted it so we went there and imported it into this country and brother bradam picks it up now and he says now he says you know how that that that with Satan gradually over time he's perverting the heart of the people whereas we forly would have to go to Paris to get its filth but once Hollywood became the established Center of entertainment for the world that is a historical happening that you can track in history there was a time when it wasn't and then a time when it is and then a time when it's go it's Global dominance and now it's it's everything and they've got all kinds of other ones and I'm not not here to say you know you got Bollywood and you got all these other different now you got all kinds of different Productions but I'm just saying Hollywood in general brother brandham then would begin to say how that while there had been a time where we would have to go to Paris to get their filth and bring it back here but now that we have Hollywood Paris and all the world with them come here to get it see so a America uh you know more specifically the Greater Los Angeles area and Hollywood you know I I I I'm building some stuff for Sunday but I I'll probably say this again I'll show you a graph on the screen but let me just tip you off right now no I'm not I'm Gonna Save it I didn't do that on purpose but make sure you come back to church Sunday the Greater Los Angeles and Hollywood area would literally become an exporter of sin not an importer now an exporter at unprecedented historic levels all over the world the the most unparalleled levels in history you see I mean if you think about it God never anointed Elijah to say that God thus sayith the Lord God will sink Paris Beneath the Sea he didn't say that he didn't say he will sink London Beneath the Sea what he said was God will sink Hollywood beneath the ocean he'll sink her see and and and instead you know he's going to not sink Paris he's going to sink Hollywood and then from there a fifth 1500 mile long by 350 mile wide chunk of the US West Coast will slide beneath the waves a mile deep amen Journey with me back to 1965 brother brandham just before he goes home in the choosing of a bride [Music] to this day and Sodom gomorah lays in the bottom of the Dead Sea and capernium is in the bottom of the sea thou City who claims to be the city of the Angels who's exalted yourself into heaven and sent all the dirty filthy things of Fashions and things to even the foreign countries here to pick up our filth and send it away your fine churches and Steeples and so forth the way you do remember one day you will be laying in the bottom of the sea your great honey core under you right now the wrath of God is belching right beneath you how much longer you'll hold this Sandbar hanging over that on that ocean out under a mile deep will slide in there pump back to the salt and sea it'll be worse than the last day of Pompei repent Los Angeles repent the rest of you and turn to God the hour of his wrath is upon the Earth flee while there's time to flee and come into Christ very true words just as much in effect today closer to coming to pass than when he said them and he he's literally talking about all the people all their Church Steeples all their everything I mean I forget how many I think I heard a quote a number some years ago um maybe maybe 15 or so years ago so it might be significantly more than this now you say what might be a possible death toll well just there are 20 a as a 15 or so years ago there was 20 million people in the San Fernando Valley alone 20 million and this thing is500 miles long 350 miles wide going a mile down the tidal waves and the and the islands and the tsunamis my goodness friends we're not talking catastrophic we're talking cataclysmic we're talking about the Western Seaboard of the greatest nation going a mile down into the ocean hide me in the Rock oh Jesus hide me Lord fill me full of the Holy Ghost if you don't have it tonight say Lord fill me full of the Holy Ghost the problem is that people are under the headship from the God of this evil age which is none other than Lucifer you don't want to lose sight of this fact friends that an influence of EMA of evil there's a tremendous influence of evil that permeates the world here at the end time just as the scripture foretold that it would I'm not going to read all of these passages tonight we may look at them more thoroughly on Sunday but Daniel is told in the 12th chapter to shut up the words and seal the book because many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased we're reminded where Paul tells Timothy that we've read it before poor in the last in the last days perilous times would come and we go down the list lovers of pleasure and Covetous and boasters and blasphemers and disobedient to parents and unthankful and Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good that's about as Twisted as you can get where you actually are really bad but you hate the people who are good I mean that's just a sickness and it's and it's it's not it's not a an airborne disease it's the devil it's the God of this evil age Jesus tells about how that the the days would have to be short unless there wouldn't even be any flesh saved he tells in Matthew 24 how that there would arise false christs and false prophets and show Great Signs to the degree that they could deceive the elected if that were possible thank God it's not we've already commented on the effects of re ation 13 not going to take the time to read it tonight the evil that permeates the world I'm here to tell you the evil at this end time is a very ancient evil amen amen I want you to get your mind around that it's a very ancient evil it's been here a very long time and fact is it predates the arrival of mankind in the Garden of Eden it was here waiting waiting on Adam when he came on the scene in a human body built out of the Dust of the Earth this tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was a person whom the prophet Ezekiel seen in a vision and spoke of him as a man and in that he came and and likened him to a a king thou Hast been in Eden the Garden of God every precious stone was like covering the Sardis topaz and Diamond the barrel the Onyx The Jasper the sapphire the emerald the carbuncle the gold these are precious gems the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes were prepared was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created so so this man the Bible says that that when they walk Satan out at the Judgment bar that the world shall the Bible says they shall narrowly look on him him it's almost derision it's it's it is derision it's it's unbelief it's astonishment it's stupic and they're going to say is this the man that deceived Nations you mean we're all going to the lake of fire because of this one man we had all the preachers but one man doomed us we had all the Nations and all the governments and all the armies and all the gold and all the money and one man that we followed is our undoing am so this man wasn't born like a man would be because he had been created by God Before Time as an archangel very powerful very beautiful a very charismatic preacher of preachers he was the leader of worship in in Heaven until sin was discovered in him and from there he was cast out of Heaven down to the Earth Paradise was lost forever to him Bound in Everlasting chains of Darkness he languished for some indeterminate unknown amount of time we don't really know how long he walked upon the volcanics he and and and and brother Brandon talks about it in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth period doesn't tell how long we only know we start counting uh in cycles of days which represent a representative of years uh once God starts developing it into and starts bringing life and starts bringing order but we know that he walked to and fro and as far as his movements through the Earth having no one or nothing that he could work through he was nearly powerless brother brandham said a demon's just nearly powerless unless he has someone to work through once God began his Divine evolution of life on Earth Lucifer watched from the sidelines once God's once God's version of Natural Evolution built up the animal built from mineral you know uh and built up to botney and then built up to animal and then built all the way up into the image of man and along the way he builds a serpent and then thereafter in short AR he places his own family in flesh with Eve as a vulnerable byproduct and right then Satan saw his chance Adam and his bride is this okay Adam and his bride were warned of God about their proximity to him Satan had in fact set up shop right in the midst of the garden right next to the tree of life because that's what the devil always does he likes to try to fake it that he's the real thing he builds himself very close the false church is a church that uses the same Bible and sings the same songs and calls on the same God and uses the name j s u s and because the rain falls on the UN the just and the unjust and because in anybody can learn how to operate faith brother brandom said I've seen prostitutes come through the line and get their healing and the saint of God miss it because it's faith and they've learned how to operate it and it it doesn't last they asked brother brandom do you have to be a Christian to be healed he said no you don't have to be a Christian to be healed but you're going to want to be a Christian if you want to stay healed yeah because a lot of times under under that anointing it quick in people's faith and brother Brandon would even say sir you didn't know you had that kind of Faith did you so faith is a sub subance but it's it's not something in your conscience mind it's in the subconscious it's a sixth sense say what can I do to access it start confessing this you don't try to uh uh hijack the the six sense use the ones you've God and just start saying what God Said in his word and start living your life by this don't you worry God will operate the faith you don't have to make it work you try to make it work that's why you can't make it work it's not your job it's Supernatural it's a revelation just start by saying Amen to the word you have using the senses you have is that easy see so we find that he had literally set up his false church right beside the tree of life and the we see the false church has done the same thing ever since Adam and his bride were strictly cautioned not to have anything to do with this evil presence amen don't eat from it don't talk to it don't have nothing to do with him Amen in fact as Eve would later inform Us in the scripture corresponding in my mind personally anyway to to the correlating to shunning why we should shun the very appearance of evil because she actually adds in a denim we're not we're not we're not to even touch it amen amen see so brother brandom goes on and be certain of God we may not think that we are Idol worshippers but we are and the government endorses it people today are Idol worshippers because they worship idols some of them worship movie stars for Idols some worship money for Idols some worship television stars for as Idols you say well what give me the definition all that you put before God is an idol whatever it is it it of itself may not be evil but if you put it before God then you are prostituting your time that you owe to God and you're giving something else a position in your life that it didn't die for you and it don't have the right you shouldn't give it that kind of homage you owe your life to Christ amen amen and he's to be first he's to be the center brother brandom said don't make him second he he don't want to be second and he don't deserve to be second am some worship television stars movies money whatever you put before God as an idol let it be whatever it may be so here we can see government does endorse religion actually as long as it's Satan's see they're worshiping idols yeah and so the government is backing religion don't say you know they say oh separation of church and state that's only if it's God but when it comes to the God of this evil age they're all in religion they love that religion they love the worship of Idols see see so you know but but let it speak about the unadulterated truth of God's word and then they don't want nothing to do with them they want to shut you down but he says we've got to the place to think that because we're resting upon what our forefathers did or Upon Our great founders of our church what their great sacrifice was to God which is all right and so much appreciated listen now but we cannot draw salvation from what they did salvation is an individual Affair between every person and God amen amen it's not with your nation it's not with your church but with ourselves before God we answer this nation won't be my final Arbiter he will you won't be he will I I owe my life to him who has given me everything Hallelujah would you really friends come on think about it would you really take something as an idol and put it ahead of your allegiance to God and put it in the place that Jesus Paid such a high price to occupy and you would deny him would you deny him the love and compassion to your fellow man that he paid such a high price to be able to have and send it through you but we have carnality in our lives we hold anger and bitterness and unforgiveness we hold sin and carnality and edginess you know all of these things and all you do is stop up all the channels and the Holy Spirit can't flow through us not here to correct the United States tonight they don't want to hear it I assume you want to hear it that's why you're here there is so much uncertainty everywhere I just I just it seemed like when I started studying this every time I would look at a headline every time I'd walk past something and there'd be it it just seemed like every everywhere I looked it was all uncertainty there's uncertainty in the mortgage markets and uncertainty in the interest rates and there's uncertainty and housing and there's there's uncertainty over coid 19 and there's uncertainty over vaccines and then boosters and now more boosters and you know you got some doctors saying it's a it's a risk re reward decision you got to weigh all the factors and kind of pick the lesser of the two evils oh my goodness I'm glad I don't have to do that with this I'm glad that I can just believe every word and I don't need the CDC to tell me it's okay or it's safe or it's effective I can just go right through here and believe it and claim it and it'll actually operate in my life I mean you know and then you've got other doctors very high ranking doctors even all the way up to um um the surgeon generals of certain States saying that they would never recommend a human being taking this new booster that's being pushed by the CDC and you don't know because politics has ruined the science and and the legitimate medical field so badly that you don't know anymore you don't know who to trust and when Co hit I stood here and I said listen friends we're not going to live in fear because I'm here to tell you there'll be five behind this one and 10 behind that one and 20 behind that one it ain't getting better it's getting getting worse and you better have your trust in the word of God know the the CDC do we trust them the World Health Organization do we trust them I don't know are they sold out it looks like it maybe I don't know possibly I don't know could it be I mean th this is what the world has to Grapple with they will have to Grapple with that tomorrow I'm preaching to you tonight so you don't have to you don't have to be uncertain you can be certain of God we used to be able to trust in the public education of our children you don't even know what they're teaching them these days only it ain't good the perverted agenda of our propaganda institutions that they call institutions of Higher Learning Satan I mean Satan Satan has so broken down society and divided society and polarized Society to where you know we we we used to have each other's back and I mean you could count on your good conservative neighbor and now you don't even know anymore that that fine conservative neighbor might suddenly go woke and double cross you you you you don't know what buildings to go and what words to say not to say and if I say the wrong thing and this is incorrect that's incorrect somebody's going to get mad everybody gets mad over something I mean friends the world has gone insane there's only one way out and that's up and there's only one mind I'm interested in having forsake the world forsake it they're crazy here's the only mind worth having you're daring to say the wrong thing in the wrong place to the wrong people I mean they're even starting to get legal ramifications people are being arrested and put in jail in some countries thank God I haven't seen it here yet my and and and and and we know we know by prophecy there's going to be a global takeover of the Antichrist that's not in question we there's uncertainty about what it's going to look like and how it's all goingon to how it's all going to wind out and you know it looks like it you know that it it may be uh in fact is sometimes I wonder if the thing that might bring the boycott and put the conservative Church into the Hip Pocket of the Vatican is a consolidation to stop the left woke ideology to say finally enough's enough see I mean I'm not here to I'm not here to preach politics and I'm not here to I'm not in here for the gospel preacher I don't know nothing about it but you but but I do know this that that we don't know exactly how it's all going to come out I do know that when you can't buy or sell except you have that Mark I know the bride doesn't see that I know by prophecy she's already gone but what I don't know is how close we might get to that I'm here to tell you you're going to need this you're going to need this you can't depend on any other source see we know certain elements that that that we won't see but we don't know exactly how close we're going to get to some of these things before we leave here our Pro listen our prophetic model one of our prophetic models is the is the story of Noah who brother brandham said contrary to almost all of the theologians they think that Noah the day he entered the Ark it started raining because of the way Genesis has it listed and it's somewhat ambiguous and you can almost read it in both ways I'm so glad I got a prophet who could just say Noah went in the ark and God closed the door and nothing happened for seven days and he brother brandham called that the third pool of his ministry it was preaching to souls in in prison who were already sealed their fate on the outside and they were doomed and that went for seven days before the rains came so how does that how brother Jason how does that apply into our lives we'll see we'll see I just know I want to make sure I'm in the ark Hallelujah there is an ark there is a safety there is a design plan God has every detail about your life how you can get in and you don't have to worry I'm here to tell you something friends don't live in uncertainty be certain of God you have the privilege tonight to be certain of God and they went and they went in went in male and female of All Flesh and as God commanded him and the Lord shut him in I seen an article some Pastor recently I remember who it was now posted it where they you know they they've they've they've got div Division I don't know how big it is I don't even know how how relevant it is it's it's nothing to me because I know they're just stupid anyway and he says he said they they think that these UFOs some of some of the Pentagon top Pentagon people are whispering in in in in closed sessions saying you think these things might be demons and they're they're losing sleep at night CU they're worried because they they definitely know that these Radars are picking up something they definitely know their cameras are seeing something they definitely know it's some kind of craft they definitely know we can't track it catch it reproduce it can't do anything and and do you do you and and we know that you know they think we have bodies we know we don't maybe this is demons if I had to go to sleep every night and worry that UFOs were deep demons friends I'm so glad for a prophet said just investigating Angels they're just investigating angels He said another place one of these days those lights you see said they're going to one of them's going to come down and pick you up I say bring it bring it Hallelujah I'm so ready to go I'm so done I I I long for the Millennium oh for the Millennium Hallelujah the hold you the world is nature is groaning for it I'm groaning you're groaning I I I I I walk through town and I hear some ungodly filth and or see some ungodly sight and and I hear myself going oh oh and I start thinking about heaven oh please come on with it Lord what are you waiting on yes there's so much uncertainty in the world world there's so many things that that that not only is it uncertain but there's there's no path to certainty you can't even find a path to make it certain it's so completely uncertain but but you know something I do have a promise that's what I do have right Revelation 3:10 reading from the New Living Translation because you have obeyed my command to preserve I will protect you from the great time of testing that will come upon the whole world to test those who belong to this world i' never been so glad to not belong to this world I'm so glad to belong to Jesus I'm so say what do you know I know my redeemer liveth what do you know I know in the last day I'll see him Hallelujah I know him I know him in the power of his resurrection I know him in his power and his resurrection Paul said that I could Paul said that I should and I have have you have you do you know him in the power of his resurrection I get into situations I I get into impossible situations I don't know I don't always know the how or the what and often I don't even know the why but I know the who I know who's in control I don't know why I don't know how I don't know what will happen but I know who's got me Hallelujah do you know who's got you oh I know that he is I know I know this that he is a rewarder of them who will diligently seek him say why are you at church tonight cuz I'm diligently seeking I'm pressing every day I go every day open my bible go to my knees oh God help me Lord Lord Draw Me Closer draw me nearer draw me nearer to thy precious bleeding side stand with me tonight friends that's what we know that's the assurance that we have I know that he is I know that he is what will he do I don't know but I know that he is I know he'll keep his word I know that all things work together for the good of them that love him I know he knew me before there was Stardust I know when he was on the cross I was on his mind I know that amen hallelujah without faith Paul would say in Hebrews 11 without faith so if you're living in fear and you're putting up with uncertainty without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him that's what I know say brother Jason what do you know I've told you told you what I know I know he is I know he cares I know he called me I know he saved me I know because I know what I used to be and I ain't that no more and I know that for years trying to not be what I used to be I couldn't not be until he made me not be Hallelujah and I know him not only I know him but I know him and the power of his resurrection and my whole desire is to have a life made conformable to his is that your desire amen gather around while brother Anthony leads us in the song Here gather gather around the front bring any prayer requests that you have I don't have any that that I saw I'll take one more look I know my [Applause] [Music] redeem oh I know I know my redeemer let all creation testify this life within me cry I know

unspoken request for my mother that's the only one that I seem to have which is a good thing amen don't have any other no prayer request amen praise the Lord bow your heads with me Lord God we thank you for this word tonight I thank you Lord for for the thrill of being a Believer I thank you Lord there's more there's so much Victory to be had and so much uncertainty to be avoided there's so much to know of you you're so open and so willing you unsealed the book you broke the seal the prophet said you you broke them off of yourself one place he said you broke them from within yourself you have completely exposed yourself oh God in your entire word your whole character your whole quality your ways your nature your word nothing you've held back nothing from us you've given us every Assurance you've proven your word Time and Time and Time Again surely we wouldn't doubt you Lord surely we could never mistake your intentions for us you've so proven them to us I pray tonight that this sermon

thank you for your love Lord I Thank You for Your Grace we're we're we're so undeserving at times of it Lord and yet you just it on anyway we love you for that Jesus we love you we thank you I pray for this unspoken request for sister Ruth turning in for her mom Lord I I think of my own mom I pray for her Lord and her Elder years that you'd strengthen her meet this need of sister Ruth's mother Lord and all the needs father that the word uncovered tonight there are no doubt needs in the lives of everybody here Lord and and your word has uncovered that I I ask master that you become just all the more real to us all the more special all the more personal may it be so God may as these closing scenes of Earth's history for we know that we are the generation upon whom the ends of the world have come we know that's true there are no more ages you have already de employed the last star that was in your right hand there are no more there it's a it's a a wrapping up time a mopping up time a consummation of all the ages everything coming to its full fruition the Insanity The Madness of the world coming to its full fruition Lord we pray constantly among the brothers and among the whole church for what a prophet said that the that the Dynamics of this church would be a refilling of the Holy Ghost that we've worked in a small way but he also drops down one paragraph later and says there's also a dynamic on the on the on the Antichrist and the Dynamics of the Antichrist will also be a power that will drive them together in a confederation so as we see that happening Lord I pray and I say past me not old gent savior oh Lord God move Upon Our Lives and in our homes Lord Jesus stir us at the deepest level that we might find our way to be closer to you we're going to need it Lord we're moving into unsettled times unparalleled times unprecedented times we're like Israel going through a Wilderness and you told them stay close stay close to the ark you haven't been this way before stay close stay very close make sure you're within airshot when the trumpet sounds we move you can't be wandering off somewhere way over in the desert you might not hear the trumpet when it blows come back and we're already gone don't let it be Lord I pray that this word will have its great effect that you intend tonight in Jesus lovely name that name above all other names and the whole

cumulative update and in order to do that I had to install a piece of software to make sure that it was up and ready well I installed this software which didn't install correctly which resulted in um my server completely crashing that brought down the security for systems around the world I worked all day long yesterday trying to do disaster restores and everything to try to get it up and running and get it working working with other government officials and everything to try to get it working and it just would not come up so um I went to the restroom and on my way back from the restroom I was

morning I was going to have to get up at 5:00 this morning to go in and fix it well I went to bed last night and while I was sleeping the Lord showed me in the dream that I was going to go in and I was going to go to this machine and I was going to take and do this one thing which was going to enable this option and bring everything back up so I got up this morning at 5:00 got up went straight into the office walked into my office sat down at my desk and before I even contacted my bosses and everything I went to look at this certain thing like it showed me in the dream and there it was so I restored it to where it was restarted the services everything came up everything was working Hallelujah so I sent out messages to let everybody know hey we're up we're working the original problem with that software install wasn't quite right so we got on the horn with uh um the security provider who told us oh yeah that's because it didn't install a single file so we duplicated a file renamed it made a few changes put it in place and boom everything was back up and running by nine o'clock this morning and all because I asked the Lord for help and he showed me in a dream what to do to fix it Hallelujah wow so one file wasn't in place and God knew where that one file W amen you got a mic yeah go go no it is test test hello yeah oh you can hear me I can't hear myself oh here that's all
