TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] well i've seen god's people pray by a hospital bed and i've seen them struggle for their daily bread seen him standing at a grave of one who left us so young and i've heard them crying out for their wayward son but i've never no never seen the righteous forsaken i've seen them with tears in their eyes seen them with their hearts breaking i've seen them tested and tried i've seen them with their face shaken but i've never never seen the watches forsaken i seen it when it seemed like there was no help in sight i've seen it when it seemed like life was nothing but night but in the eyes of heaven something else was going on they may have been all by themselves but they were never alone i've never no never seen the righteous forsaken i've seen her with tears in their eyes seen it with their face shaken i've seen them tested and tried seen them with their face shaken but i've never no never seen the watches forsaken i seen it when it seemed like there was no help in sight i've seen it when it seemed like life was nothing but night but in the eyes of heaven something else wasn't going on they may have been all by themselves but they were never alone i've never no never seen the righteous forsaken i've seen them with tears in their eyes seen them with their face shaken i've seen them tested and tried seen them with their hearts breaking but i've never no never i've never no never no i've never no never seen the righteous forsaken [Music] never [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
