[1:58] for
[2:58] e
[4:58] e
[5:28] all
[5:58] most
[6:27] heart morning
[6:33] uh just pray this can Inspire our hearts
[6:35] to go and study it for ourselves um but
[6:40] it's just kind of how the Lord was
[6:41] impressing on my heart so if we turn to
[6:44] the Book of Matthew the 16th chapter
[6:47] we're going to read a few verses there
[6:48] and then turn over in the Book of
[6:50] Revelations so Matthew 16 and we'll
[6:53] start at verse
[6:58] 13 and and it says when Jesus came into
[7:01] the coast of cesaria Philippi he asked
[7:04] his disciples saying whom do men say
[7:06] that I the son of men am and they said
[7:09] some say that thou art John the Baptist
[7:12] some say Elias others jeremias or one of
[7:15] the prophets he saith unto them but who
[7:18] say ye that I am and Simon Peter
[7:21] answered and said Thou Art the Christ
[7:23] the son of the Living God and Jesus
[7:26] answered and said unto him blessed art
[7:28] thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood
[7:31] hath not revealed it unto thee but my
[7:34] Father which is in heaven and I say unto
[7:37] thee that thou art Peter and Upon This
[7:41] Rock I will build my church and the
[7:43] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[7:46] it amen and let's turn over in the Book
[7:48] of Revelation just the first chapter
[7:50] there Revelation chapter 1 we're just
[7:52] going to read three
[7:56] verses Revelation 1 and 1 says the
[7:59] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[8:01] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[8:04] things which must shortly come to pass
[8:07] and he sent and signified it by his
[8:09] Angel unto his servant John who bear
[8:12] record of the word of God and of the
[8:14] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[8:16] things that he saw blessed is he that
[8:19] readeth and they that hear the words of
[8:22] this prophecy and keep those things
[8:24] which are written therein for the time
[8:27] is at hand God bless you this morning as
[8:29] you take your
[8:30] seats
[8:32] um brother renom says in the church age
[8:35] book I'll be quoting some some quotes
[8:38] from that book this morning the
[8:39] importance of Revelation by the spirit
[8:42] to a True Believer can never be
[8:45] overemphasized Revelation means more to
[8:48] you than perhaps you realize and now I'm
[8:51] not talking about the Book of
[8:53] Revelations and you I am talking about
[8:55] all Revelation it is tremendously
[8:58] important to the church Church brother
[9:00] random breaks that scripture down in
[9:01] Matthew 16 you know Jesus told Simon
[9:04] Peter I say unto thee Thou Art Peter and
[9:07] Upon This Rock I'm going to build my
[9:09] church you know the Rock brother Brandon
[9:11] breaks down it wasn't Peter and it
[9:13] wasn't just a natural rock it was upon
[9:15] the Revelation that God gave to Peter
[9:18] that Jesus was the Christ he says now
[9:21] you might take what the pastor says or
[9:24] what the Seminary said
[9:26] teaches and though it might be taught to
[9:28] you with eloquence until God reveals to
[9:32] you that Jesus is the Christ and that it
[9:35] is the blood that cleanses you and that
[9:37] God is your savior you will never have
[9:40] eternal life it is the spiritual
[9:43] Revelation that does it and so until God
[9:46] reveals something to you as an
[9:47] individual personally that Jesus is the
[9:50] Christ and he is your savior and his
[9:52] blood cleanses and washes away your sins
[9:54] you can't ever have eternal life he says
[9:56] and he goes on to say in this Revelation
[9:58] he tells us what the end of the devil is
[10:01] he tells us how he's going to deal with
[10:02] the devil and cast him into the Lake of
[10:04] Fire he reveals the end of the wicked
[10:06] ones who follow Satan and Satan hates
[10:09] that and that is why he attacks them
[10:12] speaking of the books of Genesis and the
[10:14] Book of Revelation he hates to be
[10:17] exposed and in those books he is exposed
[10:20] for exactly what he is Jesus said that
[10:22] about Satan he has no part in him and I
[10:25] have he has no part in me and I have no
[10:27] part in him the Bible says the devil
[10:29] would like to prove that different but
[10:31] he cannot so he does all he can to
[10:34] destroy confidence in the word so he
[10:37] does everything he can to destroy
[10:39] confidence and we're going to dive into
[10:40] that in just a few minutes but he uses
[10:42] specific Pathways to destroy that
[10:47] confidence but then he goes on to say
[10:50] but when the church disbelieves Satan
[10:52] and believes the spiritual revelation of
[10:54] the word the Gates of Hell cannot
[10:57] Prevail against her
[11:00] now remember this he says I know there's
[11:03] a couple quotes but just to set a
[11:05] foundation this morning Christ is the
[11:08] true church in the true church is a
[11:11] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[11:15] Book of Revelation shows how that the
[11:18] Antichrist would come into the church
[11:21] and defile it making it lukewarm formal
[11:25] and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing
[11:27] his works the attempt and destruction of
[11:30] God's people and the discrediting of
[11:32] God's word right down to the time he's
[11:34] cast into the Lake of Fire he fights
[11:36] that and he can't stand it that passage
[11:38] in the church age book is so important
[11:41] you know we can often look at that first
[11:42] sentence where brother brandom says
[11:44] Christ is a continuation of the book of
[11:46] Acts and that you know that makes us so
[11:49] happy and we are a continuation of that
[11:50] book but then we have to realize that
[11:53] the Antichrist Spirit fights us so hard
[11:57] to come to that revelation of who we are
[12:01] and the the title that I I was going to
[12:04] take today a church age study but it's
[12:07] battling the spirit of indifference and
[12:11] um there's something that you know
[12:14] something that we have to fight
[12:15] constantly in our lives and that's the
[12:17] spirit of lukewarmness you know the
[12:18] Bible says that it makes the church
[12:20] formal and Powerless second Timothy 3
[12:23] says it like this 31 says know this that
[12:27] in the last days per time shall come for
[12:31] men shall be lovers of their own self
[12:33] Covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[12:35] disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy
[12:38] without natural affection truce breaker
[12:41] truce Breakers false accusers
[12:43] incontinent Fierce despisers of those
[12:45] that are good traitors heady high-minded
[12:49] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[12:50] God and having a form of godliness but
[12:54] denying the power thereof from such turn
[12:58] away so there's a form of godliness
[13:01] there that the Bible talks about going
[13:03] to church and and living a life but it
[13:05] denies that the power of God Revelation
[13:08] three says and unto the Church of the
[13:10] lead Deans write these things saith the
[13:12] amen the faithful and true witness the
[13:15] beginning of the creation of God I Know
[13:17] Thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[13:20] hot and I would thatou were cold or hot
[13:22] so then because Thou Art lukewarm and
[13:25] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[13:28] out of my mouth
[13:29] because thou sayest I am rich increased
[13:31] with goods and have need of nothing and
[13:33] knowest not that thou art wretched
[13:35] miserable poor blind and naked so if
[13:37] we're not careful we can fall into that
[13:41] Spirit of deception even Believers you
[13:43] can live you know we can live in a
[13:45] halfin half out life you know maybe
[13:47] maybe we go to church maybe we read our
[13:49] Bible maybe we listen to a tape once a
[13:51] week but then it can become more of a
[13:53] ritual than an actual experience in your
[13:57] life you know there's no fire in it
[13:58] brother Jason's been preaching about the
[14:00] fire in our lives there's no expression
[14:01] of God's life in it and he says in verse
[14:05] 18 of that same chapter I counsel thee
[14:07] to buy of me gold tried in the fire that
[14:09] thou mayest be rich in white rnment that
[14:12] thou mayest be clothed and that the
[14:14] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[14:16] anoint thine eyes with isab that thou
[14:18] mayest see and in verse 19 I wanted to
[14:21] pick this up in Revelation 3:19 he says
[14:24] as many as I love I rebuke and I chasen
[14:28] be jealous therefore and repent now I
[14:30] wanted to stop on this verse for just a
[14:32] minute and dive into to a power there's
[14:35] a power in confession the Lord knows
[14:38] that the spirit of lukewarmness was
[14:40] going to be so strong in the last day so
[14:43] he knew that that was going to he gave
[14:45] us the word he he he says he he's the
[14:47] god of everything so he knew that was
[14:48] going to happen so what did he do he
[14:50] provided us with the ultimate remedy to
[14:53] combat the devil in his tactics amen and
[14:56] that was to give us the anointed word
[14:58] word for our hour amen through
[15:00] Revelation and just to break that down
[15:02] more simply I'm just a you know simple
[15:04] guy that's what a lot of the the
[15:07] particular message of the church age
[15:08] book does and deals with some things
[15:11] that over the course of history that had
[15:13] gotten confused like how people were
[15:15] supposed to be baptized and how the Lord
[15:17] Jesus Christ was God and human flesh and
[15:20] how on the day of Pentecost he had
[15:22] divided himself into the church but he
[15:23] was all still in the same he was all
[15:26] still one one
[15:29] portion he was still one all being the
[15:31] same God just three offices or three
[15:33] manifestations brother Brandon breaks
[15:35] that down simply as we move into this
[15:37] but he says be zealous therefore and
[15:40] repent so the life of a True Believer
[15:43] isn't just one experience of repentance
[15:46] and filling of the Holy Ghost it's a
[15:48] continual Fountain of repenting and and
[15:51] being refilled amen we have a a born
[15:53] again experience of God but then there's
[15:55] a continual fountain that God wants to
[15:58] give you more maturity in your walk with
[16:01] Christ amen there's a solid experience
[16:03] there's a time in your life where you
[16:04] can look back on and say from this time
[16:07] you know I I I serve the Lord God called
[16:10] me and he brought me out of where I was
[16:11] living at but then each each portion in
[16:15] your life you know each time that God
[16:16] gives you another step that you go
[16:19] through you come to deeper revelations
[16:21] in your life which which that shows you
[16:24] that you know God is always giving you
[16:26] something to repent of and a lot of it's
[16:28] not it's not a lot of sometimes it's not
[16:31] a lot of outward things it's it's some
[16:33] things that in our mind that we just
[16:34] have to repent Lord I need to take that
[16:36] thought captive I need to I need to
[16:37] humble myself more in this area because
[16:40] God is showing us who we are because a
[16:43] couple verses later we show that God
[16:45] wants us to sit on his throne with him
[16:47] but there takes a character development
[16:49] to do that
[16:50] amen and whom the Lord loves he rebukes
[16:53] and he
[16:54] chastens um you know when he puts that
[16:57] that new nature in you and and you
[17:00] repent of your sins and you're filled
[17:01] with the go Holy Ghost your desires
[17:04] change but as you mature and you grow
[17:07] and you walk closer with him you know
[17:09] there's things in our life that we
[17:10] stumble at we all have weaknesses we all
[17:13] have things that we that we stumble at
[17:15] we you know we could go down a long list
[17:16] I'm not going to go down a long list of
[17:19] you know this morning but each of us
[17:20] stumble with certain things and that's
[17:22] because there's an old nature that we're
[17:25] fighting against and that's that Fallen
[17:27] condition that you left behind you know
[17:29] when you started walking with God it's
[17:30] always trying to fight its way back into
[17:32] your nature it's a sticky nature and you
[17:35] know brother Brenham gives that
[17:36] illustration of the Indian chief talking
[17:38] about the two dogs fighting within you
[17:41] know the black and the white and someone
[17:42] asked him you know which one is the
[17:44] strongest in your life and the chief
[17:45] just said simply it's whichever one you
[17:47] feed the most and something like that
[17:50] that's just so simple but it's just
[17:52] exactly the truth whatever you feed the
[17:54] most in your life that is what's going
[17:55] to have the strongest influence the
[17:58] where you go what you do what you listen
[18:00] to if you're constantly feeding on the
[18:02] wrong thing or feeding on entertainment
[18:04] or feeding on social media or feeding on
[18:06] you know shows or movies what do you
[18:09] think is going to have Supremacy in your
[18:11] life the things that you're feeding
[18:13] on Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15:31 I
[18:17] Die daily you know and that dying out
[18:21] daily applies to every facet of our of
[18:25] our walk with the Lord you know the
[18:26] devil isn't stupid he knows that he
[18:28] isn't going to get you to go down the
[18:30] stre street and and get drunk or or live
[18:32] a filthy life so he has to be more
[18:35] cunning in his tactics so he places
[18:37] certain distractions in your life you
[18:39] know he gives us a phone and he gives us
[18:41] different 300 things to do on that phone
[18:43] and he sneaks into your thought life and
[18:45] maybe he'll slip something in there
[18:47] something that edges on compromise but
[18:49] then if you don't take that thought
[18:52] captive if you don't cast down that
[18:54] imagination then it begins to grow and
[18:56] grow and grow that's why why living the
[18:59] Christian Life that's why it's a dying
[19:01] out daily and it's a dying out not daily
[19:04] anymore it's a dying out hourly it's a
[19:06] dying out every minute um we're going to
[19:08] get to this in just a minute but you
[19:10] know the average person the average
[19:11] human being has 50 to 70,000 thoughts
[19:16] every single day and so imagine if you
[19:19] have 50 to 70 thoughts every single day
[19:22] how many of those thoughts are are are
[19:24] are about the word how many of those
[19:26] thoughts are about the message and how
[19:28] many thoughts are about carnal things
[19:30] that aren't going to grow you in your
[19:32] spiritual walk that's why it takes a
[19:35] continual dying out a repentant heart
[19:37] you know God doesn't want to just have a
[19:39] bunch of robots doing the same thing
[19:41] saying the right thing you know looking
[19:43] the right way dress in the right way you
[19:46] know because that's what we're supposed
[19:47] to do he's trying to mold our character
[19:51] and I love Pastor sermon uh from
[19:53] Wednesday night you know Judas didn't
[19:56] just make one great great choice in his
[19:59] life to betray Jesus it must have been a
[20:02] series of choices a series of thoughts
[20:06] that the devil would flood into his mind
[20:08] thoughts that he didn't take captive and
[20:10] and cast down right the eventual you
[20:13] know eventually that overtook him and it
[20:15] led him to make a final choice to betray
[20:17] Jesus and you know in our life are we're
[20:21] constantly being bombarded with thoughts
[20:23] from the enemy you know we know that the
[20:26] Battleground in The Believer is in the
[20:27] mind and the that's the greatest battle
[20:30] ever fought so in studying the tactics
[20:32] of War you know that you have to study
[20:35] how your enemy attacks so that when it
[20:37] does come time for him to attack that
[20:40] you're prepared to not only to defend
[20:44] his T attacks but prepare to defeat him
[20:47] when he's on your ground because nobody
[20:49] no no no Army wants to just be a
[20:52] continual uh continually in defense you
[20:55] know we want to we want to offend we
[20:57] want to I want to take what the ground I
[20:59] want to I want to fight the enemy I want
[21:01] to get on his ter I want to fight on my
[21:03] territory that God has given me I want
[21:05] to win back what he's tried to take from
[21:07] me I want to be an overcomer the Bible
[21:10] says to him that overcometh will sit on
[21:12] that throne with him I don't want to
[21:13] just be in a constant state of Defense
[21:16] always having to take this thought and
[21:17] take that you know we're having to do
[21:19] that defense is always at the you know
[21:21] at the back of our heads but we have to
[21:24] always remember that God gave us
[21:27] everything we need to overcome in this
[21:31] age in order to to win that battle we
[21:34] have to search out the scriptures so we
[21:37] study the message we constantly look for
[21:39] things in our life that we need to
[21:41] repent of that that's why the Bible says
[21:43] be zealous therefore and repent you know
[21:47] and constantly looking at things in your
[21:49] life to repent of in the life of a
[21:52] Believer you should we should wake up in
[21:54] the morning and you should think of that
[21:56] scripture I want to be jealous I want to
[21:58] I want to be anxious I want to be I want
[22:00] to strive Lord God to to further my walk
[22:04] with you today so if there's something
[22:06] that isn't right in my life then I want
[22:08] to make it right amen I want to I want
[22:10] to cast down those imaginations I you
[22:12] know there's many things in my life that
[22:15] and I'm going to get to this in just a
[22:16] second but trials and things that you go
[22:20] through testings how many times in our
[22:23] life do you go through something in your
[22:26] mind that people around you never even
[22:29] know you go through because it's a
[22:31] battle that's taking place in your mind
[22:33] you have 50 you know I probably on the
[22:36] smaller end of that so maybe I have
[22:37] 40,000 thoughts every day but you have
[22:39] 40 to 50,000 thoughts every day how many
[22:42] of those thoughts are the enemy trying
[22:44] to come in and trying to play something
[22:47] in your life that's going to hinder you
[22:49] that's going to cause you to stumble so
[22:51] the life of a Victorious believer is
[22:54] constantly being fought in our life
[22:55] every day you're constantly having to
[22:58] cast down an imagination you realize
[22:59] that that thought isn't my thought you
[23:01] know and I'll just give everybody in
[23:03] here give a little bit of a of a tactic
[23:06] if the thought that you're having
[23:08] doesn't align up with this then it's not
[23:11] your thought so you cast down that
[23:13] thought and then you have a victory so a
[23:15] victory in your life doesn't have to
[23:17] just be you know I went through this
[23:18] great trial I went to this great
[23:19] circumstance you fight trials in your
[23:21] life every single day and many times the
[23:24] trial you fight in your life I'll never
[23:26] know about it maybe maybe even your
[23:28] husband your wife will never know about
[23:30] it your brother your sister may never
[23:31] know about it because you fought it in
[23:33] your mind you fought it in your spirit
[23:36] and you cast down that thing and then
[23:38] you became an overcomer because you were
[23:40] obedient to God's word when you said be
[23:43] zealous therefore and repent because you
[23:45] were zealous about it and you you you
[23:47] were active in that process amen you
[23:49] were you you know you were you were
[23:51] fighting you weren't just defending you
[23:54] know I want to take out you have a
[23:55] shield in your hand but then you've got
[23:56] a weapon you've got a SW sword of the
[23:58] spirit so you wield that sword and you
[24:01] wield that that Shield of Faith but you
[24:03] always move forward you don't let the
[24:05] enemy you know draw you back amen
[24:08] especially when it comes to something
[24:10] like lukewarm living you know that is
[24:12] something that can happen so quickly in
[24:16] your life especially in the society that
[24:18] we live in we live in a fast-paced
[24:20] society you know we have the everything
[24:23] that you need of at the touch of your of
[24:25] a finger you know it's it's sometimes
[24:27] it's just getting back to the basics
[24:29] where's your prayer life at what you
[24:30] know do you spend longer than 7 minutes
[24:32] a day praying maybe 3 minutes of that
[24:35] praying for your food and I'm I'm just
[24:36] being honest because i' I've had those
[24:38] times in my life where you know you get
[24:40] you get so moving so quickly and then
[24:43] you you've gone all day and you haven't
[24:45] communed with your father you haven't
[24:47] communed with the one who's going to
[24:49] give you overcoming power so the getting
[24:52] back to the basics in your life you know
[24:54] and I I don't want that to sound
[24:56] condemning I'm just just just as
[24:58] guilty the entire day can just get away

[25:10] for us to to be zealous about you know
[25:13] recognize that that's something in my
[25:15] life that I struggle with and cast it
[25:17] down and then move forward don't let the
[25:19] enemy one of the tactics of the enemy in
[25:21] our mind is is he he gets you so
[25:24] distraught about about Casual Living and
[25:27] then you start to feel bad about
[25:29] yourself you start to feel bad I'm not a
[25:31] Victorious believer I'm not I'm not
[25:33] living in the victory that I supposed to
[25:34] be living in you just cast that thing
[25:36] down and you move forward you you you go
[25:38] forward from the point that you're at
[25:40] now and you remember that everything
[25:42] else is in the past and I'm moving
[25:44] forward I live in a future I live in a
[25:47] future life right now you know God sees
[25:49] me in the future there's to there's an
[25:51] end to the devil and there's an end to
[25:53] his tactics but there's no end to you
[25:55] because you are in Christ amen
[26:01] so we are to be enthusiastic in our
[26:03] pursuit to repent and and you know it
[26:06] shows that the lord loves you because
[26:10] he's trying to call you up higher than
[26:14] where you are now you know if you if
[26:16] you're rebuked or if you're chastened
[26:18] you know that's actually an expression
[26:20] of God's love to you because he wants to
[26:23] get you more mature he wants to bring
[26:26] you into a further an of of of him in
[26:29] your
[26:30] life amen and
[26:36] um the next verse says behold verse 20 I
[26:41] stand at the door and knock If any man
[26:44] hear my voice and open the door I will
[26:46] come into him and will Su with him and
[26:48] he with me to him that overcometh I
[26:52] grant to sit with me in my throne even
[26:55] as I also overcame and am sat down with
[26:58] my father in his throne he that hath an
[27:01] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[27:03] unto the churches you know and just to
[27:07] break this down a little bit more simply
[27:09] you know the Revelation the Revelation
[27:11] that God gives you in your life it's an
[27:13] unveiling it's it's a it's a it's an
[27:16] understanding that God wants you to have
[27:18] you know it's it's simply it's a simple
[27:21] thing God wants to reveal himself in
[27:24] Simplicity to each one of you there
[27:27] isn't there isn't a you can you can make
[27:30] things complicated but it's as simple as
[27:33] laying out before God and asking him to
[27:36] come into your heart and to show him
[27:38] show show you who you are show you where
[27:42] you need to be show you that you're an
[27:44] overcomer and God is going to give you
[27:46] that Revelation and he is going to take
[27:49] you to where you need to be Amen brother
[27:52] Venom says it like this he knows that if
[27:53] people get the true revelation of the
[27:56] true church and what she is what she
[27:58] stands for that she can do the Greater
[28:00] Works and she will be an invincible Army
[28:03] if they can get a true revelation of the
[28:05] two Spirits within the framework of the
[28:07] Christian church and by God's spirit
[28:12] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[28:15] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[28:18] her he will be definitely thed today as
[28:20] when Christ withstood his every effort
[28:23] to gain power over him in the desert yes
[28:26] Satan hates Revelation but we love it
[28:29] and with true Revelation in our lives
[28:30] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[28:32] it against us but we will prevail over
[28:35] them you know looking at that by God's
[28:37] spirit Discerning and not only
[28:40] Discerning but withstanding the
[28:43] Antichrist spirit that tries to creep
[28:45] into our lives you know and every time
[28:47] that the devil you know in that
[28:50] experience in the desert with Jesus
[28:51] every time that the devil came to him
[28:53] all Jesus said was it is written it is
[28:55] written in my word and so when the the
[28:57] Devil comes in your mind and he tries to
[28:59] throw a reasoning down he tries to say
[29:02] you're you're nothing he tries to do
[29:04] those things you just say it's written
[29:06] in the word that I'm I'm an overcomer
[29:08] because he wants me to sit on his throne
[29:11] with him I I'm an overcomer I have to
[29:13] cast down that reasoning I have to cast
[29:15] down that imagination I have to take
[29:17] that thought captive and the the the
[29:20] small victories that you have in your
[29:21] mind taking a thought captive those
[29:24] things com Compound on each other it's a
[29:27] comp pounding Victory so that when a
[29:29] trial does come and it may be an outward
[29:31] trial or it may be an outward testing
[29:34] you have you have overcome so many times
[29:36] in the territory in your mind that when
[29:38] it comes to a territory that's on his
[29:41] Battleground now you're ready to fight
[29:43] because you've won it here so once
[29:44] you've won it here you'll be able to W
[29:46] it there
[29:47] amen every time that the devil came and
[29:50] tried to tempt him Jesus would just
[29:52] quote his word it is written Thou shalt
[29:54] not tempt the Lord your God and so when
[29:56] something happens in our our our life
[29:59] just remember the weapon that you have
[30:00] is the word and it's as simple as
[30:03] looking at the word it's as simple as
[30:05] laying out yourself to to to read the
[30:08] message to understand it to to study it
[30:11] to live it to breathe it
[30:16] amen getting back to some of the
[30:18] distraction just a few more minutes here
[30:20] getting back to some of those
[30:21] distractions that you know that we have
[30:25] um the thoughts
[30:27] some how many thoughts in your mind of
[30:31] those 50 to 70,000 how many thoughts in
[30:35] your mind on a daily basis are you
[30:38] giving to allow greater Revelation in
[30:41] the word now just think about that how
[30:44] many thoughts are you allowing in your
[30:48] mind to allow maturing and growth to
[30:52] manifest in your life getting back to
[30:54] that black dog versus the white dog what
[30:56] are are you feeding the most I know I
[31:00] keep going back to the simple things but
[31:02] that's that's what the church age book
[31:03] is about it's about the simple
[31:05] revelation of who Jesus is to you and
[31:07] once you realize who you are and who
[31:10] Jesus is to you the Gates of Hell cannot
[31:13] Prevail against it amen so whatever
[31:16] you're feeding Faith cometh by hearing
[31:18] and hearing of the word of God you know
[31:20] and if you're not aligning the majority
[31:24] of those thoughts of of the 60 let's
[31:27] just say 60,000 Thoughts with the word
[31:29] of God a process actually begins to take
[31:32] place and your walk with the Lord starts
[31:35] to deteriorate and what happens is an
[31:38] indifference starts to settle in and
[31:40] that lukewarmness starts to starts to
[31:44] major in your life before you can even
[31:46] realize it you know and I mean it when I
[31:50] say that the devil is deceptive and he
[31:53] hates us he hates the word and he going
[31:56] to he's going to do everything he can to
[31:58] keep you away from a fiery experience in
[32:04] with the Lord Jesus brother renom says
[32:07] you will recall that I mentioned at the
[32:08] beginning of this message uh uh that we
[32:10] are studying it's the actual revelation
[32:12] of Jesus himself in the church and his
[32:14] work in the future ages then I mention
[32:17] that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[32:18] Revelation or we will fail to get it
[32:21] bringing these two thoughts together you
[32:22] will see that it won't just take
[32:24] ordinary study and thinking to make this
[32:27] book real it is going to take the
[32:29] operation of the Holy Ghost that means
[32:31] this book can't be revealed to anyone
[32:35] but a special class of people it will
[32:37] take one with prophetic Insight we have
[32:39] prophetic Insight amen we've got
[32:41] prophetic Insight it will require the
[32:44] ability to hear from God it will require
[32:47] Supernatural instruction not just a
[32:49] student comparing verse with verse
[32:51] though that is good but a mystery
[32:55] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[32:57] it never becomes clear and look at the
[33:00] simple instructions from the prophet how
[33:02] we need to hear from God and lay
[33:04] ourselves open and become yielded to the
[33:07] spirit to hear and to know so just
[33:10] studying the book won't be enough but it
[33:13] does start with that the Mysteries that
[33:15] lay within it require an inspiration
[33:18] from the spirit of the Lord and there's
[33:20] such an importance in hearing the word
[33:22] there's such an importance of reading
[33:24] the word and studying the message Things
[33:26] Are opened up to us in many different
[33:28] ways and they're revealed when you come
[33:30] to church and you know when you're in
[33:31] prayer and you know but it says when you
[33:34] lay yourself open and yield yourself to
[33:38] God and allow yielding that word
[33:41] yielding speaks of meekness it speaks of
[33:43] being submissive to his Spirit to come
[33:46] in and allow things now sometimes it
[33:48] takes a lot of humility to come and
[33:50] allow something to come in your life and
[33:52] in your mind and say I was wrong in that
[33:55] way but Lord I Want to Be Right amen it
[33:57] takes humility to say that but one of
[33:59] the things that every one of us battle
[34:01] is that pride in our minds to say well
[34:03] that's all right no everything that is
[34:05] not in alignment with God is not all
[34:07] right so we need to get it back into
[34:09] alignment with God
[34:14] Amen
[34:18] um just a minute here uh as I've already
[34:21] said this book is the consummation of
[34:23] the Scriptures it is even placed exactly
[34:25] right in the Canon of scriptures now you
[34:27] know why it says that Anyone who reads
[34:29] or hears it is even hears it is blessed
[34:32] it is a revelation that God gives you
[34:34] authority over the devil and you can see
[34:36] why they who would add or take from it
[34:39] would be cursed it would have to be so
[34:41] for who can add or take away from the
[34:43] perfect revelation of God and overcome
[34:45] the enemy it is that simple the prophet
[34:48] says there is nothing of such prevailing
[34:50] power as the revelation of the word and
[34:53] just some closing thoughts there's so
[34:54] much Simplicity to the book and the
[34:56] prophet says that several times if you
[34:58] go read the read and study the church
[35:00] age book how how simple don't get
[35:02] tripped up with language maybe that you
[35:03] don't understand or terminology just lay
[35:05] yourself open and allow God to come into
[35:07] your heart and to reveal things to you
[35:09] because that's exactly what he's looking
[35:11] for just simply lay yourself open and
[35:13] pray about those things that are not
[35:15] plain and God can open it up to you he
[35:18] hides those things from the wise and
[35:19] prent prudent and reveals them to babes
[35:22] such as we learn amen I'm so thankful
[35:24] for that aren't we now there's just
[35:27] I I'm I should be done but I have this
[35:29] one more thought five minutes I think
[35:31] it'll be okay brother bam says let me
[35:34] just put in a word here from my own
[35:35] Ministry if you don't mind you all know
[35:37] that the gift in my life is Supernatural
[35:39] it is a gift by where the holy spirit is
[35:41] able to discern diseases and the
[35:43] thoughts of men heart and other hidden
[35:45] things that only God would know and then
[35:46] reveal to me I wish you could stand here
[35:48] with me and see the faces of people when
[35:50] Satan knows he's going to be exposed now
[35:52] it isn't the people that I'm talking
[35:54] about it is Satan that has got a hold of
[35:56] their life lives through three things
[35:58] and I want
