[3:43] Hallelujah have a little
[3:47] testimony most of you know that my son
[3:50] has been um in rehab since April and
[3:54] he's been doing very well with that he
[3:56] actually got a job to uh in Dickinson
[4:00] North Dakota working with a petroleum
[4:02] company up there and I believe he left
[4:05] LA on
[4:07] Friday I talked to him just as he got
[4:10] out of Las
[4:12] Vegas about 2 and a half hours from
[4:14] there he started getting
[4:16] sick and um I think he actually spent
[4:19] two days in a hotel room throwing up
[4:23] every hour and uh he's had very minor
[4:26] issues with
[4:28] diabetes um
[4:30] but the devil turned it up a little bit
[4:33] he ended up getting um diabetic ketosis
[4:38] acidosis they took him to Cedar City
[4:41] hospital he was in he's been in the ICU
[4:44] since yesterday morning I
[4:47] believe uh I've talked to him a couple
[4:50] times he yesterday he wasn't able to
[4:52] talk pretty much at all his his body has
[4:55] got so much acid in his blood and
[4:58] they're working to get that
[5:00] corrected but um so we just I I've asked
[5:04] a few of you to just pray for him we'll
[5:06] pray for him now um he's been in contact
[5:09] with those people that uh hired him in
[5:11] Dickinson and they're they're they just
[5:14] told him when he can get there get there
[5:17] the hospital the nurses think he'll
[5:19] probably be out by Friday and Stephen
[5:22] was I asked him that he said next Friday
[5:25] and I said I think it was this Friday
[5:27] but we want to remember him in prayer
[5:30] he's been through a lot

[25:53] Lord father we just look to you yes amen
[25:57] know you're the same yesterday today and
[26:01] forever the same God that was there in
[26:06] the form of Jesus Christ same God that
[26:09] was manifested in the life of brother
[26:12] brandham is the same God that's here in
[26:14] our midst Lord to meet every need that
[26:17] we have all we have to do is believe
[26:20] your promise receive your promise just
[26:23] accept that it's it's not only true but
[26:26] it's for me
[26:28] right in my
[26:30] situation so we Look to You Lord we ask
[26:32] that your Holy Spirit would come take
[26:34] your word Lord and write it upon our
[26:36] hearts that's all our desire is Lord
[26:38] which you promised that you would do
[26:40] that Lord if wherever two or three were
[26:43] gathered together you'd come your
[26:46] presence would be here Lord and your
[26:48] purpose Lord is to write your word in
[26:50] our hearts Lord that we be would be CH
[26:52] changed and transformed to be a
[26:55] reflection of Jesus Christ in this hour
[26:58] so we commit this time unto that even
[27:01] now Lord For Your Glory we ask in jesus'
[27:03] name amen God bless you Saints if you
[27:05] want to bring up
[27:07] the PowerPoint back there for me I'm
[27:10] going to speak on the subject of the
[27:12] battle begins I was thinking upon my
[27:16] life as a young convert receiving the
[27:19] Holy Ghost and uh when I received the
[27:23] Holy Ghost that's when the battle a
[27:25] whole new war that I knew nothing about
[27:28] amen started in my life
[27:31] and that's where that's where it begins
[27:33] when you get the Holy Ghost a battle's
[27:36] coming a fight's coming but you have the
[27:39] tools to be Victorious now amen before
[27:43] that you didn't once you get the Holy
[27:46] Ghost now you're subject
[27:48] to winning the war
[27:52] amen all right so let's turn in the
[27:54] scriptures uh Romans chapter 7
[27:58] 7 we'll just
[28:01] read here and let you have your
[28:04] seat but I see another law in my members
[28:07] Waring against the law of my mind and
[28:09] bringing me into captivity into the law
[28:11] of sin which is in my
[28:16] members oh Wretched Man that I am who
[28:19] shall deliver me from the body of this
[28:22] death I thank God through Jesus Christ
[28:25] Our Lord so then with the mind I myself
[28:28] serve the law of God but but with the
[28:30] flesh the law of sin may the Lord add
[28:33] the blessing to the reading of his word
[28:35] you can be
[28:36] seated so the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[28:39] upon your soul is a personal experience
[28:42] that each of us must have yes amen it
[28:45] makes us a new creature in Christ a new
[28:48] creation in Christ it puts us into the
[28:50] body of
[28:52] Christ and it's identified by Leading us
[28:55] into all truth brother bham taught us
[28:57] that that he said it's not speaking in
[28:59] tongues and it's not love but it's being
[29:02] led into all truth amen and so as a
[29:08] result along with that the the fruit of
[29:11] the spirit begin to be increasingly
[29:14] produced and formed in your life and
[29:17] you're also because you're a body part
[29:19] of the body of Christ you're subject to
[29:21] the gifts of the Spirit amen when you
[29:24] receive that baptism of the Holy Ghost
[29:26] upon your
[29:28] Soul uh now you're a newborn babe in
[29:31] Christ you feed on milk right when
[29:35] you're a newborn babe but you need to
[29:37] grow increasingly so that you can come
[29:40] to the place where you're feeding on
[29:43] strong meat amen right that's God's goal
[29:46] is to increase us those who are of full
[29:49] age eat strong meat yeah so that's the
[29:54] age that we're living in he's growing us
[29:56] into that place of perfection or
[29:59] completion or
[30:01] maturity now I I was I was studying this
[30:04] and I was praying this morning and uh
[30:08] this this picture began to form in my
[30:11] mind and I begin to think of of the type
[30:13] that the Holy
[30:15] Ghost is a type of not heaven or the
[30:20] promised land is not a type of heaven
[30:22] but the promised land is a type of the
[30:24] Holy Ghost so I began to study this and
[30:27] think about this and so I want to just
[30:29] first
[30:31] establish what kind of battle is taking
[30:33] place when you have received the Holy
[30:36] Ghost so let's look at some quotes
[30:39] brother brandham in questions and
[30:40] answers says and as long as you're in
[30:43] this life you're going to be sticky and
[30:44] have a carnal nature that's going to
[30:46] bother you as long as you live amen but
[30:48] the inside of you you're born again and
[30:51] when you're raised up you're in the
[30:53] likeness of Christ and all the sin is
[30:55] gone from you see that's the thing so
[30:57] you have two of those things going on at
[30:59] the same time once you're born again you
[31:02] are forgiven but not only forgiven
[31:04] you're Justified your sins are cast into
[31:07] the sea of forgetfulness never to be
[31:09] remembered no more and at the very same
[31:12] time you still
[31:14] have a sinful nature in your flesh am
[31:18] that's battling against the holy ghost
[31:21] in your life and there is a process of
[31:24] this battle and V and victory that needs
[31:26] to
[31:27] happen within us
[31:32] amen he says but on in questions and
[31:34] answers number one 1954 but I'm
[31:37] backsliding remember you backslide every
[31:40] day yeah no way at all for you to keep
[31:42] out of it all right but you backslide to
[31:45] the people but not before God see you
[31:47] backslide on Christ but you don't on God
[31:48] because if you would when you sin you're
[31:50] gone but you're constantly falling Paul
[31:53] had to die every day is that right he
[31:55] had to die every day repent every day
[31:58] and just constantly repenting all the
[32:00] time see if Paul had to do that then I'm
[32:03] going to have to too aren't you yes
[32:06] that's right amen see that's a brother
[32:09] brandom there speaking of himself I
[32:12] backslide every day
[32:15] constantly all right so are we supposed
[32:17] to just stay in that condition are we
[32:20] supposed to just be content with
[32:22] backsliding every day well brother Bram
[32:25] said I backslide every day so just fine
[32:27] I'm going to keep on doing no that's not
[32:29] the attitude of a Christian right after
[32:32] that he says he had to die every day
[32:34] repent every day so the backsliding is
[32:37] not a condition that we want to
[32:39] surrender ourselves to we want to
[32:41] surrender ourselves to the power of God
[32:44] moving in our lives to convict us and to
[32:47] draw us closer to Christ so that we
[32:48] would be a reflection of him not a
[32:50] reflection of continuous
[32:53] backsliding am
[32:56] nevertheless understand you're not
[32:59] perfect in the sense of flawless sinful
[33:03] sinlessness you're still going to have
[33:05] that and that will always be there
[33:06] that's right that's why the Bible says
[33:09] draw near to God he'll draw near to you
[33:12] James 4:8 says that cleanse your hands
[33:14] you Sinners purify your hearts yeah you
[33:17] double-minded so those are the things
[33:19] that we as Believers need to do we have
[33:22] a problem sometimes we get double-minded
[33:25] that's what backsliding is it's becoming
[33:27] double-minded you have two things that
[33:29] are going on one one law in is working
[33:32] in you that you want to do what's
[33:35] pleasing to the Lord another law is
[33:36] working in you to battle against that
[33:38] law to prevent you from doing that so
[33:41] purify your your hearts cleanse
[33:45] yourselves draw near to God and he'll
[33:48] draw near to you I want to talk about
[33:50] that for just one moment what does that
[33:52] mean draw near to God he'll draw near to
[33:54] you it's not as though it's like like
[33:57] well the Holy Spirit we we sin and the
[33:59] Holy Spirit leaves us no you're sealed
[34:02] until the day of your Redemption but
[34:04] what really is it is the influence of
[34:06] the Holy Spirit as we backslide if we
[34:09] don't if we cut off that process of
[34:11] repenting we just backslide backslide
[34:13] backslide with no repentance that's when
[34:16] we push the influence of the Holy Spirit
[34:18] brother Bram says the dove leaves and
[34:20] goes and sits on the tree up up there
[34:22] waiting for you to repent now the Holy
[34:25] Ghost don't doesn't leave you
[34:27] you're sealed until the day of
[34:28] redemption but the influence of the Holy
[34:31] Ghost has been cut off from you because
[34:34] of this unrepented of sin in your life
[34:39] and so that's where we're
[34:42] double-minded that's why we need to be
[34:44] cleansed that's why we need to purify
[34:45] our hearts and especially in that first
[34:48] we have to draw near to God because in
[34:51] drawing near to God then his presence
[34:54] his influence is there in your life you
[34:57] know when you spend more time in prayer
[34:59] when you spend more time reading the
[35:01] Bible feeding on the word that is where
[35:05] the influence of the holy spirit is most
[35:06] strong but when you stop doing that I'm
[35:08] busy I got everything going on that's
[35:10] when the influence of the Holy Spirit
[35:12] gets lower and lower and you walk in
[35:14] unrepented of sin
[35:17] amen two Natures fighting inside of you
[35:22] amen all right the Bible says now this
[35:26] is a question questions a question from
[35:28] uh uh questions and answers in
[35:32] 1961 the Bible says that everything
[35:35] works for the good to them that love the
[35:37] Lord then if you love God and turn back
[35:39] to the world would God let you die in
[35:41] sin or would he let you be reconciled
[35:44] back to him before he takes you away the
[35:48] lady signed her name to it so I'd say it
[35:50] was a lady see cuz she signed her name
[35:53] yes sister if let me get this see
[35:55] temporarily minor every one of us back
[35:56] slide many times a day we know that
[35:58] we're all guilty every one of us there's
[36:00] none of us perfect perfected and as long
[36:03] as we're in this body no matter how much
[36:05] the people try to tell I got Sanctified
[36:07] I can kiss this woman or do that he's
[36:09] lying he cannot now that's all amen I
[36:13] don't I try don't try to say Lord let me
[36:16] see how close I can go it's Lord keep me
[36:19] as far away as I can get see just as far
[36:21] away as remember you're still human
[36:23] being
[36:24] see and now but now if you make a
[36:27] mistake and do something wrong you don't
[36:29] willfully uh if you're if you're a born
[36:32] again Christian you don't mean to do
[36:34] wrong your intentions and everything is
[36:37] right but if you do as she said here
[36:39] make a mistake and do something wrong
[36:40] will God let you just go on and go on
[36:43] and die like that and be lost or will he
[36:45] bring you back to
[36:47] reconciliation Hallelujah he will bring
[36:50] you back that's right he will bring you
[36:52] back and if uh then if you do anything
[36:55] wrong it don't condemn you you and you
[36:57] go on like that on out remember you
[36:59] wasn't saved at the beginning wow that's
[37:02] good that's right you you wasn't saved
[37:04] you just had a make belief you wasn't
[37:06] saved but when you're saved you have a
[37:08] different Spirit you have a different
[37:09] nature you're a new creature in Christ
[37:11] and the old things has passed away and
[37:13] they are dead and buried in the sea of
[37:15] forgetfulness GL you
[37:17] see all right amen where am I at up
[37:23] there thank you uh and but being you're
[37:27] living here in this world there's traps
[37:29] set for you everywhere and you're
[37:31] walking with your eyes on Christ and
[37:32] remember that when you make a mistake a
[37:34] real Christian will always come back
[37:36] quickly for reconciliation amen all
[37:46] right there we go look in the ark God
[37:49] turned the old crow out or Noah turned
[37:51] the crow out now what was he he was a
[37:53] crow oh yes he sat on the same Roose
[37:55] there with the dove they both sat in the
[37:57] same Roose but when he turned the old
[37:59] crow up well imagine all the water was
[38:02] stinking with millions of people's
[38:03] swelled bodies rottening up upon the top
[38:06] top the water and horses and animals all
[38:08] dead my what a picture the whole world
[38:11] was destroyed and there was this old
[38:12] dead carcasses floating on top of the
[38:14] water and things like that and Noah
[38:16] turned the dove out cu he guessed he saw
[38:17] some sunshine and he wanted to know
[38:19] whether the water water had receded or
[38:21] not so he turned the crow out and the
[38:25] old crow flew down on on an old dead
[38:28] body my just fine that's good so see
[38:30] eating a dead body why that was his
[38:32] nature he was a crow no matter how much
[38:34] he'd set with the dove how much he'd
[38:35] heard Noah preach how much he'd set with
[38:37] this clean bird he was a crow to begin
[38:40] with and as soon as he got the
[38:41] opportunity to show his colors he showed
[38:44] it now but when he turned the dove out
[38:47] when she started outo she couldn't stand
[38:49] that nowhere she could go she couldn't
[38:51] find no rest for the souls of her feet
[38:53] so she' come back to the ark that's the
[38:55] way it is sometimes he might be turned
[38:57] loose for a little while to see what you
[38:59] do but you'll always if you got the
[39:01] nature of a dove you cannot eat crows
[39:04] food that's all it just won't digest
[39:08] that's all amen what a beautiful thing
[39:11] that brother brandham speaks there is
[39:13] will the Lord will if if I'm in a
[39:16] condition where I backslide and I fall
[39:19] and I and I and I go away uh will will I
[39:23] just be left in that condition and
[39:25] brother B you're not going to leave you
[39:27] he's going to go after you and he's
[39:29] going to bring you back but H what's the
[39:32] then he goes on to explain how that
[39:34] works how will he bring you back this is
[39:37] how he brings you back you have your
[39:39] desire that is in you that you can't
[39:42] keep feeding on that garbage out there
[39:45] you got to come to a place where you're
[39:48] going to start feeding back on the word
[39:51] again because that's the nature inside
[39:53] of you that other nature is there and
[39:56] sometimes we feed it too much that's
[39:59] where we go the wrong way but if you're
[40:01] a Son of God God is going to convict you
[40:04] and you're going to go through the
[40:05] process you're going to say I backslid
[40:07] you're going to get on your knees before
[40:08] God and you're going to repent but it's
[40:11] that nature it's that desire that's
[40:13] inside of you that God has put there
[40:15] when you're young in the faith that
[40:17] desire is not super strong it's strong
[40:22] it's it can be very strong but yet
[40:24] there's this place where also the desire
[40:26] of the flesh is strong the nature of the
[40:29] flesh is strong so these two things are
[40:31] Waring against each other and you fall
[40:33] and you get up and you keep going and
[40:34] you fall and you keep up get up and you
[40:36] keep going that's the process that's
[40:38] normal you're a newborn babe does a
[40:41] toddler run and jump and do the triple
[40:44] jump and play uh in the NFL
[40:48] no no they first have to learn how to do
[40:52] all that they'll fall they'll stumble
[40:55] they'll struggle struggle it'll be
[40:57] difficult but they'll just keep getting
[41:00] up and doing it until they're able to
[41:02] shoot a
[41:07] basketball see so that's that's what we
[41:10] do as Christians keep going keep going
[41:14] get up keep going what of course you
[41:16] failed what are you talking about you
[41:18] have another nature inside of you that's
[41:20] at war against that brother brandom says
[41:23] you'll backslide every day so then you
[41:25] need to repent every day set that in
[41:27] your mind as a Christian every single
[41:30] day don't be so proud of yourself I
[41:32] don't need to repent I'm a Christian I
[41:35] doubt your experience in the first place
[41:37] if that's your
[41:38] attitude the place right here if you
[41:40] have that attitude is right at the altar
[41:42] to get your heart right with the Lord
[41:44] because that's right a real Christian
[41:46] recognizes his own weakness and is
[41:49] broken yeah over his own weakness
[41:54] amen and thirst 1965 brother Bram says
[41:59] for instance the flesh thirst to satisfy
[42:02] the desires that's in the body and the
[42:04] spirit desires for the things that's in
[42:06] the soul desires many times these War
[42:09] one against another we find there what's
[42:12] a great trouble today that too many
[42:13] people try to live between these two
[42:16] desires for one of them desires the
[42:18] things of the Earth the other desires
[42:21] the things of Heaven like Paul said
[42:24] describes in Romans 7:21 when I would do
[42:26] good the evil then evil is die when you
[42:29] try did you ever have that in experience
[42:32] Christians that when you're trying to do
[42:35] something that's worthwhile go to make
[42:37] an effort to do something that's good
[42:39] then you find out that there is the
[42:41] devil on every hand just to upset you
[42:45] everything that You' and and that's one
[42:47] good thing I'd like to say this that the
[42:49] Christian might know then when you are
[42:52] when you are starting to do something
[42:54] then there is something always trying to
[42:55] upset you you in doing it to do it
[42:59] anyhow amen that's the devil there
[43:02] trying to keep you from doing what's
[43:05] right amen isn't that beautiful
[43:10] amen now I want to bring two things and
[43:12] then we're going to go into our
[43:15] typology Hebrews
[43:17] 10:14 I want to keep the keep these
[43:19] things in order for by one offering he's
[43:22] perfected
[43:23] forever them that are Sanctified amen so
[43:27] let's let's bring this together this
[43:30] word is
[43:31] Sanctified uh is not a finished tense
[43:34] this tense is an ongoing tense in other
[43:38] words for them that are being Sanctified
[43:42] is how you would understand this this
[43:45] word so it you are perfected
[43:50] forever if you're being Sanctified think
[43:53] about that so this one is in experience
[43:56] and one is God's declaration God has
[43:59] declared over you you are perfected
[44:03] forever amen it's our conscience right
[44:07] he's perfected our conscience he's
[44:08] changed our nature he's changed our
[44:10] desires he's taken our sins he's cast
[44:13] them in the sea of forgetfulness
[44:15] remember there's there's two parts to
[44:18] the New Covenant you think about that
[44:21] there's two parts of the New Covenant
[44:22] and we can you can read that in Hebrews
[44:24] chapter 10 you can read that in Jeremiah
[44:26] uh chapter 31 I believe it is I get
[44:29] those mixed up 31 or 34 either one just
[44:31] read them both it'll be good for
[44:33] you
[44:36] um but what what is it he says I will
[44:40] write my law in your heart and in your
[44:44] mind and he says I'll remember your sins
[44:48] and iniquities no more right here is
[44:51] showing both of those
[44:53] things being Sanctified is God God
[44:56] writing his word in our hearts and in
[44:59] our minds okay perfected forever is
[45:03] remembering our sins and iniquities no
[45:05] more both of them come by the blood of
[45:08] Jesus
[45:09] Christ but one of them is an ongoing
[45:12] work as long as you're here in this body
[45:15] as long as you're as up up until the
[45:18] Rapture amen you're going to be going
[45:20] through this process of God writing his
[45:22] word on your heart yeah all right
[45:26] thank you however he you'll already have
[45:30] every one of your sins cast into the sea
[45:32] of forgetfulness and he remembers them
[45:34] no more so that's a that's a finished
[45:37] work thank you so the identification of
[45:40] you having the finished work in your
[45:42] life is that the ongoing work is going
[45:45] on in your life God is leading you into
[45:49] all truth in other words he's writing
[45:50] the word in your heart so if God is
[45:53] writing the word in your heart and
[45:56] changing you conforming you to the
[45:57] nature of Christ that means your sins
[46:00] are already in the sea of forgetfulness
[46:03] I no notice there I never said you are a
[46:06] finished product you never make mistakes
[46:09] you never mess up no what it is is he is
[46:13] changing me he is working in my life
[46:17] he's taking the message of the hour and
[46:18] he's wri it in my hearted in my mind and
[46:21] I'm growing into Christ
[46:24] amen Philippians
[46:26] 212 wherefore my beloved as you have
[46:30] always obeyed this is one of my favorite
[46:32] scriptures I me I mention it all the
[46:34] time uh it's just to me these two
[46:37] scriptures together so encapsulate the
[46:41] sovereignty of God and our surrender to
[46:43] his
[46:44] will wherefore my beloved as you've
[46:46] always obeyed not as in my presence only
[46:48] but now much more in my absence work out
[46:51] your own salvation with fear and
[46:54] trembling amen amen all right so work
[46:57] out your own salvation with fear and
[46:59] trembling we look at this and we think
[47:01] my goodness how could I ever work out my
[47:03] own salvation but remember salvation is
[47:07] never something that you achieve
[47:10] salvation is a gift by grace are you
[47:12] saved through faith that not of
[47:14] yourselves the gift of God not of Works
[47:15] lest any man should boast has nothing to
[47:17] do with you
[47:18] working salvation is given to you as a
[47:22] gift however you're told to work out
[47:25] what you've already received all right
[47:28] but when we're talking about working out
[47:30] what you've already received with fear
[47:33] and trembling it's not like you are it's
[47:37] you doing it alog together God has
[47:40] supplied the
[47:41] materials so think about it this way
[47:43] work out you could you could say when
[47:46] you have an equation in math you work
[47:49] out the answer 2 + x =
[47:53] 4 so how do you how how do you figure
[47:56] out that well 2 + 2 equal 4 now I have
[47:59] worked out salvation so now you're
[48:03] taking the elements that God has
[48:05] provided and supplied for you and you're
[48:08] letting them accomplish what he desires
[48:11] in your life amen see and this goes
[48:15] perfectly along with what is happening
[48:17] next because he says for or
[48:22] because it is God which worketh in you
[48:26] both to Will and to do of his good
[48:29] pleasure goes perfectly along with the
[48:32] New Covenant goes perfectly along with
[48:34] the verse that we just read in
[48:37] Hebrews how how are we working this out
[48:40] working out our salvation with fear and
[48:42] trembling it's God working in us to Will
[48:45] and to do of his good pleasure he is
[48:48] doing a work in us we surrender right to
[48:52] that work that he is doing and and just
[48:55] the fact we have to it's an ongoing
[48:58] process when you look at this he is
[49:00] working to Will and to do of his good
[49:03] pleasure this isn't a one-time thing
[49:04] it's not a one-time event it's not when
[49:06] you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[49:08] that just starts the process that begins
[49:10] the process then this is what happens
[49:14] see this happening is evidence that that
[49:16] has happened see you have an experience
[49:19] with God experience of God produces
[49:21] something in your life it produces
[49:24] transformation it produces the life of
[49:27] Jesus Christ amen all right so now I
[49:31] want to get into looking at typing out
[49:35] our walk in the Holy Ghost with the
[49:38] promised land I began to look at this
[49:41] brother bham says as I was with Moses so
[49:43] I will be with thee 1960 it's it's uh he
[49:48] says oh I got to stop here on something
[49:49] just a moment won't take me but a minute
[49:52] many people refer to the promised land
[49:54] to the m Millenium if you study this and
[49:57] look at this in your in the table you'll
[49:59] see many people includes brother Bram up
[50:01] to this
[50:03] point all right and I think there's a
[50:05] reason for that and we'll study this but
[50:08] he says many uh refers to that to the
[50:11] pro Promised Land of the Millennium it
[50:12] is not the promised land had Wars and
[50:15] killings the Millennium won't have any
[50:17] wars or killings it referred to the Holy
[50:21] Spirit the Battlegrounds amen amen so as
[50:25] I began to think about this and study
[50:27] this I realized okay if that if the
[50:30] promised
[50:31] land is a type of the Holy Spirit the
[50:34] Battleground then we can go go and begin
[50:37] to look at Joshua and judges and Samuel
[50:42] and type it out and see how this goes
[50:45] forward all right so we're going to do
[50:48] that we're going to spend the rest of
[50:50] our most of the rest of our time looking
[50:52] at
[50:53] this so Joshua 1 2 Moses my servant is
[50:57] dead now therefore arise go over this
[51:00] Jordan so that's passing over into the
[51:03] promised land amen thou and all this
[51:06] people unto the land which I do give to
[51:08] them even to the children of Israel
[51:11] every place that the soul of your foot
[51:13] shall tread upon that have I given unto
[51:15] you as I said unto Moses amen from the
[51:19] Wilderness in this Lebanon even under
[51:20] the Great River the river
[51:22] Euphrates now they've never ever
[51:26] had this much
[51:27] land they they've not the Great River
[51:30] the the small River to all the way to
[51:32] the Sea yes they've had that but even
[51:35] that it's been a small time that they've
[51:37] had it yeah from the Wilderness in
[51:40] Lebanon into the Great River the river
[51:41] Euphrates all the land of the Hittites
[51:44] and unto the great sea toward the going
[51:46] down of the sun shall be your Coast
[51:48] there shall not any man be able to stand
[51:50] before thee all the days of thy life as
[51:53] I was with Moses so I will be with thee
[51:55] I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be
[51:58] strong and of a good courage For unto
[52:00] this people shalt thou divide for an
[52:02] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[52:04] their fathers to give them only be thou
[52:07] strong and very courageous that thou
[52:09] mayest observe to do according to all
[52:12] the law which Moses my servant commanded
[52:14] thee turn not from it to the right hand

[52:51] victuals for within three days you shall
[52:53] pass over this Jordan to go into to
[52:56] possess the land which the Lord your God
[52:58] giveth you to possess so as we study and
[53:02] look at this they're just about to go
[53:04] into the promised land they're on the
[53:05] other side of the Jordan and they're
[53:08] told be prepared for war and battle it's
[53:11] going to be a war it's going to be
[53:13] challenges to your faith there's going
[53:15] to be difficulties and trials you don't
[53:17] say be strong and courageous if it's
[53:19] just going to be simple and easy amen
[53:22] amen you you're you say be strong and
[53:24] courageous because it's going to be
[53:26] difficult it's going to be many
[53:27] hardships many trials so this is the
[53:30] preparation that's given to them be
[53:32] strong and courageous do not
[53:34] fear the promise God is with you
[53:37] wherever you
[53:38] go remember the word that's been given
[53:41] to you meditate on the word that was
[53:44] delivered to you obey that same word
[53:48] which has been given to you again the
[53:51] promised land a type of the Holy Ghost
[53:53] these are the instructions they're going
[53:55] in to receive the Holy
[53:58] Ghost
[54:00] so these are the things when you enter
[54:04] don't forget we need the word we need
[54:08] strength we need courage because it's a
[54:10] battle it's a war we need to remain
[54:13] strong you won't take the land you won't
[54:16] have Victory if you stay timid if you
[54:18] stay weak you have to take the word and
[54:21] you have to feed on it
[54:22] continually if you don't meditate on it
[54:25] day and night you will never have
[54:27] victory in the land that's true
[54:33] wow it's a real Battleground we got to
[54:36] take the word and we got to feed on it
[54:39] we got to be courageous and we got to
[54:41] obey the word because that actually
[54:43] right there is where the victory is if
[54:46] you walk in obedience to the word God
[54:50] will be with you and he will achieve the
[54:52] victory through you amen won't achieve
[54:55] the victory for you but he will achieve
[54:58] the victory through you now the promised
[55:02] La Land battle begins but it was a
[55:04] battle that was to lead them to rest I
[55:08] want you to notice I believe brother
[55:11] brandom speaks about the promised land
[55:12] is a journey to the Millennium yeah I
[55:15] was looking at that it's a journey to
[55:17] the Millennium so if if it's a the
[55:20] promised land is a type of the Holy
[55:22] Ghost us receiving the Holy Ghost is
[55:24] then our journey to the Millennium amen
[55:29] and as I was looking at this I began to
[55:31] see brother brandham says this in 1957
[55:35] God manifesting his gifts now Solomon's
[55:37] age that he was referring to was the
[55:39] Millennium for the Jews it was the
[55:41] golden age as historians know for the
[55:42] Jewish people Solomon was a four type of
[55:45] Christ in that he built the temple and
[55:49] so
[55:52] so the the Holy Ghost
[55:55] is where we receive it when we go into
[55:57] the land amen right we go into battle we
[56:00] fight to take the land and the ultimate
[56:04] that that the ultimate that we're going
[56:06] to achieve in our fighting is entering
[56:09] into rest amen
[56:13] amen and so Solomon being that type you
[56:16] go through the history of Israel the
[56:19] time of Conquest the time of Judges the
[56:22] time of the first kings that came and up
[56:24] to
[56:25] Solomon and the rest that the people had
[56:29] for a short period of time thank God we
[56:31] won't have a rest for a short period of
[56:33] time
[56:34] Hallelujah so they crossed into the land
[56:37] under Joshua in the
[56:38] springtime the river parted for them to
[56:41] get into the land great Supernatural
[56:43] experience crossing the river into the
[56:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost first thing
[56:48] that happens once they get into the
[56:51] land into the promised land is the new
[56:53] generation is immediately
[56:55] circumcised as they enter the land being
[56:58] a type of even there of receiving the
[57:01] Holy Ghost the new generation must be
[57:04] circumcised the new generation must
[57:06] receive the Holy Ghost they can't go in
[57:08] on their parents' experience they have
[57:10] to go in on their own experience am next
[57:13] thing that you see is they meet
[57:16] Jericho uh they come under the the
[57:18] leadership of the angel of Jehovah's
[57:21] armies and Jericho they listen to The
[57:24] Voice voice of God through the angel of
[57:27] Jehovah and they destroy Jericho and the
[57:31] and the the land is under great
[57:33] fear because they're walking in steps
[57:37] remember steps means possession so
[57:40] they're taking possession of their
[57:42] promise they're walking through the land
[57:45] taking possession of their promise but
[57:46] as they're taking possession of their
[57:48] promise uh-oh they take possession of
[57:51] too
[57:52] much amen now we have a and he grabs the
[57:56] detestable thing the
[57:59] Abomination an idol of
[58:02] gold it's a cursed thing they go to
[58:06] battle my think about this they were so
[58:09] zealous they went to battle if they
[58:11] would have done it correctly they would
[58:14] have went to God and God would have said
[58:17] you have sin in the camp you can't win
[58:20] the victory get rid of the sin instead
[58:23] they March forward without in immaturity
[58:27] in babyhood they March forward and
[58:30] they're defeated oh mercy type remember
[58:33] this is a type of the Holy Ghost
[58:36] yeah you say my goodness you're you're
[58:39] saying there's defeat you can be
[58:41] defeated when you have the Holy Ghost
[58:43] yeah sir but notice the Hol God doesn't
[58:47] abandon them because they're his
[58:48] predestinated seed and he says they they
[58:51] turn to him and say God what what
[58:54] happened well why didn't you do that
[58:55] before you did that before the problem
[58:58] be solved you did it afterwards you got
[59:00] people killed because of this you made a
[59:02] mistake yeah you sinned now they've got
[59:05] to repent now they've got to make it
[59:08] right before God and kill that sin in
[59:14] the camp and everything associated with
[59:15] that sin just burn it with
[59:18] fire now they can go forward into battle
[59:22] and now they'll have victory over the
[59:26] enemy amen praise the Lord they didn't
[59:28] give up they dealt with the sin yeah
[59:31] they repented they attacked again and
[59:34] they
[59:35] won next they run into some people
[59:38] depending pretending to be from on a
[59:40] long journey long distance and say oh uh
[59:44] we want to make peace with you we heard
[59:45] what God has done with you and we're
[59:47] from a long ways away be at peace with
[59:49] us oh they say oh man that's awesome God
[59:52] is really blessing us here uh sure we'll
[59:55] make peace with you guys what did they
[59:57] forget to do you have the Holy Ghost you
[1:00:00] still can't just run forward like you
[1:00:02] know everything like you got it all
[1:00:04] figured out ask God what to do on every
[1:00:08] step if you have the real Holy Ghost
[1:00:11] God's going to direct you back even if
[1:00:13] you don't do it the first time he's
[1:00:15] going to create the circumstances and
[1:00:17] the situation where you go okay I humbl
[1:00:20] myself Lord I I I made a mistake I've
[1:00:23] done something stupid help me notice God
[1:00:26] doesn't abandon them through this they
[1:00:28] made a they made a terrible mistake they
[1:00:30] never should have done that they're
[1:00:31] supposed to destroy the
[1:00:32] gibit and it became a thorn in their
[1:00:35] flesh from that now as we go forward the
[1:00:38] sun stands
[1:00:39] still the five kings are killed much
[1:00:42] land is conquered Joshua gets old even
[1:00:46] when he's still old it says there's
[1:00:47] still much land to possess but they
[1:00:50] begin to settle down and smaller scale
[1:00:53] conquests continue continue Caleb takes
[1:00:55] his
[1:00:56] land the tribes get their land allotted
[1:00:59] Cities of Refuge are selected pasture
[1:01:01] lands and cities are given to the
[1:01:03] Levites through the tribal
[1:01:06] areas at the end of Joshua Joshua's life
[1:01:09] he renews he reminds them of the
[1:01:11] Covenant he reminds them of what they're
[1:01:13] supposed to be doing yeah and he reminds
[1:01:16] them of the command that God gave him at
[1:01:18] the beginning obey the law of Moses o uh
[1:01:21] follow the word meditate on it day and
[1:01:23] night be strong and rageous take the
[1:01:25] land Drive the people out of the land
[1:01:28] stay with the word that the prophet
[1:01:30] brought you obey the word completely
[1:01:33] amen if you don't drive the Nations out
[1:01:35] if you don't drive the sin out of out of
[1:01:37] your life it's going to be a snare to
[1:01:39] you and a thorn in your flesh as long as
[1:01:44] you live amen and it'll be a trap sir
[1:01:47] for you to take your heart away from God
[1:01:51] that's
[1:01:52] right then we go through the judg Judes
[1:01:55] my goodness here's the summary of the
[1:02:03] judges nevertheless the Lord raised up
[1:02:06] judges which delivered them out of the
[1:02:08] hand of those that spoiled them and yet
[1:02:11] they would not hearken unto their judges
[1:02:13] but they went a whoring after other gods
[1:02:16] and bowed themselves unto them they
[1:02:17] turned quickly out of the way which
[1:02:19] their fathers walked in obeying the
[1:02:20] Commandments of the Lord but they did
[1:02:23] but they did not so
[1:02:25] and when the Lord raised them up judges
[1:02:27] then the Lord was with the judge and
[1:02:29] delivered them out of the hand of their
[1:02:30] enemies all the days of the judge for it
[1:02:32] repented the Lord because of their
[1:02:33] groanings by reason of them that
[1:02:35] oppressed them and vexed them and it
[1:02:37] came to pass when the judge was dead
[1:02:40] that they returned and corrupted
[1:02:41] themselves more than their fathers and
[1:02:43] following other gods to serve them and
[1:02:45] to bow down unto them they ceased not
[1:02:47] from their own doings nor from their
[1:02:48] stubborn way and the anger of the Lord
[1:02:51] was hot against Israel and he said
[1:02:52] because that this people has
[1:02:54] transgressed my Covenant which I
[1:02:56] commanded their fathers have not
[1:02:57] hearkened unto my
[1:02:59] voice I will I also will not henceforth
[1:03:02] drive out any from before them of the
[1:03:05] Nations which Joshua left when he
[1:03:09] died that through them I may prove
[1:03:12] Israel whether they will keep the way of
[1:03:14] the Lord to walk therein as their
[1:03:16] fathers did Keep It or Not therefore the
[1:03:19] Lord left those Nations without driving
[1:03:21] them out hastily neither deliver
[1:03:23] delivered he them into the hand of
[1:03:27] Joshua my goodness so we look and we see
[1:03:31] through all of this ups and downs
[1:03:35] struggles and trials Hearts waxing cold
[1:03:39] heart hearts getting on fire again up
[1:03:43] and down backslide the backsliding of
[1:03:46] Israel continual backsliding
[1:03:50] amen and we can all come into that
[1:03:53] condition this this is the promised land
[1:03:55] even in the Holy Ghost we all come into
[1:03:57] that place of ups and downs and our
[1:03:59] hearts gets cold and turns away from God
[1:04:02] and then God sends a Deliverance to us
[1:04:05] amen sends a message to us and changes
[1:04:08] and touches our heart and transforms us
[1:04:10] even further and and again and refills
[1:04:13] us that's why we need refilling of the
[1:04:16] Holy Ghost you see God sends a new judge
[1:04:19] it's like a refilling of the Holy
[1:04:21] Ghost and it renews them and they keep
[1:04:23] going going for forward and all of a
[1:04:24] sudden they start getting cold and their
[1:04:26] faith gets weak and God refills them
[1:04:28] again amen than you
[1:04:36] Lord questions and answers brother
[1:04:39] Brandon is asked is it possible for a
[1:04:41] holy ghost filled person to be driven by
[1:04:43] driven by to do minor things influenced

[1:06:08] Ghost Satan's got every gun right on you
[1:06:11] shooting you then you got the whole
[1:06:13] armor then take the shield of Faith the
[1:06:15] sword of the spirit or the word take the
[1:06:17] Buckle shot yourself with the gospel and
[1:06:19] take the old middle piece here the
[1:06:21] breastplate and pull up the Cinch on it
[1:06:23] tighten yourself up a little bit and get
[1:06:24] ready for it cuz it's coming don't you
[1:06:27] worry yes sir you're going to have
[1:06:28] plenty of trouble don't you worry you're
[1:06:32] going to have plenty of
[1:06:33] trouble but remember greater is he
[1:06:36] that's in you than he that's in the
[1:06:40] world amen
[1:06:42] amen so then we come to the time of
[1:06:48] Samuel and the people wanted a man to
[1:06:50] lead them instead and they chose out a
[1:06:52] king but then God chose a king a man
[1:06:55] after his own heart David still being a
[1:06:58] type under the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:01] they're still Conquering the promised
[1:07:03] land he would not he could not build the
[1:07:06] millennial Temple right and I understand
[1:07:10] many types and there's different
[1:07:11] directions you can go with the temple
[1:07:12] we're a type of the temple our body is a
[1:07:15] temple of the Holy Ghost but looking at
[1:07:16] it in that sense just in this sense he
[1:07:20] couldn't build the temple why because he
[1:07:22] was a man of blood and War but David
[1:07:26] finally subdued the land 2 Samuel 8
[1:07:28] shows us David had a great campaign
[1:07:32] aggressive campaign of War to take full
[1:07:34] control finally David said this is it
[1:07:37] I'm done with all these little
[1:07:38] skirmishes and these fights we are going
[1:07:41] to go to war and we are going to sub
[1:07:44] subdue this enemy and we're not going to
[1:07:47] deal with this nonsense anymore so he
[1:07:50] subdues the Philistines Moab zoba the
[1:07:52] syrians Ammon amalec Edom they all pay
[1:07:56] tribute to David finally they have rest
[1:08:00] now David says we have rest I'm going to
[1:08:02] build a temple God says you're not going
[1:08:05] to do
[1:08:05] that then he called for Solomon his son
[1:08:08] and charged him to build a house for the
[1:08:11] Lord God of Israel and David said to
[1:08:13] Solomon my son as for me it was in my
[1:08:15] mind to build a house under the name of
[1:08:18] the Lord my God see they finally got to
[1:08:20] the place where they had peace now
[1:08:22] they're fixing to enter into rest enter
[1:08:26] into Millennium but they couldn't do it
[1:08:30] under David a man of war and blood it
[1:08:33] had to be the change of dispensation to
[1:08:37] Solomon it was in my mind to build a
[1:08:40] house under the name of the Lord my God
[1:08:42] but the word of the Lord came to me
[1:08:43] saying thou H has shed blood abundantly
[1:08:46] and has made great Wars Thou shalt not
[1:08:48] build a house under my name because thou
[1:08:50] has shed much blood upon the Earth in my
[1:08:53] sight Behold a son shall be born to thee
[1:08:55] who shall be a man of rest and I will
[1:08:57] give him rest from all his enemies
[1:08:59] roundabout for his name shall be Solomon
[1:09:02] and I will give peace and quietness unto
[1:09:05] Israel uh in his days he shall build a
[1:09:08] house for my name and he shall be my son
[1:09:11] and I will be his father and I will
[1:09:12] establish the Throne of his kingdom over
[1:09:15] Israel
[1:09:17] forever Solomon is just a type of Christ
[1:09:20] This Promise that's spoken is spoken to
[1:09:23] Solomon
[1:09:24] in type of the ultimate fulfillment of
[1:09:27] this is the Lord Jesus Christ who will
[1:09:31] have a kingdom in Israel in the
[1:09:34] Millennium it will be forever and he'll
[1:09:37] be he'll anoint the the the millennial
[1:09:41] Temple amen and he he will rule over
[1:09:45] that and that will be the time of rest
[1:09:48] that is the re that is part of our
[1:09:51] reward for being in the battles in
[1:09:54] taking the promised land yes
[1:10:01] amen Philippians 1:6 now we think about
[1:10:06] this all the ups and downs that Israel
[1:10:09] went through all the mistakes that they
[1:10:11] made all the failures that they went
[1:10:15] through I can go back and look at my own
[1:10:18] life oh yeah I was going to say you can
[1:10:19] go back but I'm just going to talk about
[1:10:22] myself
[1:10:25] I can go back and look at all the
[1:10:27] mistakes that I made all the failures I
[1:10:30] made all the times my heart got cold all
[1:10:33] the times I got backslid amen wasn't
[1:10:36] feeding on the word and I can say God
[1:10:40] never left me in that
[1:10:44] condition he did something in me that
[1:10:47] caused me to repent and turn and go in
[1:10:50] the right direction why because he gave
[1:10:52] me the Holy Ghost yeah why did he give
[1:10:55] me the Holy Ghost because I was in his
[1:10:56] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:10:59] so I had the Holy Ghost he's never going
[1:11:01] to let me go even though it seems like
[1:11:04] I'm letting go too much oh yeah too
[1:11:06] often and we get to that place and we F
[1:11:10] we think uh how how can I it possibly be
[1:11:14] that I could make it how could it
[1:11:16] possibly be that I could go in the
[1:11:19] Rapture that I could be saved well the
[1:11:23] reality is you
[1:11:25] can't and why why we ever get to our
[1:11:27] minds that the devil speaks to us this
[1:11:30] way and it it's at some point in our
[1:11:32] life when the devil starts speaking it
[1:11:34] this way you're going to laugh the Lord
[1:11:37] has helped me to reach that place and I
[1:11:39] don't know I don't know how it happened
[1:11:41] but it came to that place the devil
[1:11:43] shows me you're not worthy you you've
[1:11:46] done this you've done
[1:11:49] this thanks for the reminder
[1:11:52] Hallelujah not
[1:11:54] worthy I never could be worthy I never
[1:11:57] could work my way into it it's only by
[1:11:59] the blood of Jesus Christ that I can
[1:12:01] appear before the presence of God and
[1:12:03] it's only by the faith that God has
[1:12:05] given me it's not even my own faith it's
[1:12:08] the faith of the Son of God who loved me
[1:12:11] and gave himself for me so we can be
[1:12:14] confident of this very thing that he
[1:12:17] which beg a good work in you will
[1:12:19] perform it until the day of Jesus Christ
[1:12:24] praise God
[1:12:26] see this is what God was doing God was
[1:12:30] showing in
[1:12:31] Israel you amen God never he never left
[1:12:36] them and never abandoned them even
[1:12:38] though they abandoned him over and over
[1:12:40] again he never abandoned him abandoned
[1:12:42] them he still hasn't even though it
[1:12:45] might look like it to the world God has
[1:12:48] never he's he's written them on the palm
[1:12:52] of his hand amen it's engraven with an
[1:12:55] iron tool and it can't be
[1:12:57] removed no matter what and so you that's
[1:13:00] your name there it's not just Israel's
[1:13:03] name it's your name that's written there
[1:13:06] and so he is going to finish the work
[1:13:10] but he wants to do
[1:13:11] it through you not just merely for you
[1:13:15] see wow he wants to move in your life in
[1:13:20] a way so that you have over come you
[1:13:24] have taken the the what he has supplied
[1:13:28] to you and you've surrendered to his
[1:13:31] purpose of his spirit and his word and
[1:13:34] you're walking in both of those things
[1:13:36] you need both of those things to go
[1:13:38] forward if you don't have both of those
[1:13:40] things you're missing something with
[1:13:42] both of those things there's Victory
[1:13:46] amen
[1:13:49] amen Romans
[1:13:51] 8:17 and 18
[1:13:54] and if children then heirs HS of God and
[1:13:58] Joint HS with Christ if so be that we
[1:14:02] suffer with him that we we may be also
[1:14:06] glorified together so there is a part of
[1:14:10] our walk with we have to suffer with him
[1:14:14] we have to go through trials
[1:14:16] difficulties
[1:14:18] tribulations that is the place that
[1:14:20] we're Overcomers yes that's right we
[1:14:22] can't be glorified together with Christ
[1:14:24] unless we suffer with him unless the
[1:14:27] guns of the enemy are trained on you
[1:14:31] yes you'll never be glorified with him
[1:14:35] that is a part an important part of our
[1:14:38] experience that's where the Holy Ghost
[1:14:40] in us and the word that we're feeding on
[1:14:44] is tried and tested so that we can show
[1:14:47] the power that that word has in
[1:14:49] overcoming
[1:14:50] amen for I reckon that the suffering of
[1:14:53] this present time the sufferings of the
[1:14:55] Conquering of the present the the
[1:14:57] promised land are not worthy to be
[1:15:00] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:15:03] revealed in US amen the same God that
[1:15:07] led the children of Israel into the
[1:15:09] promised land of the Holy Ghost where
[1:15:10] Wars failures victories great
[1:15:13] Supernatural experiences Deliverance
[1:15:15] took place will also lead us to that
[1:15:20] Millennium under the ultimate son of
[1:15:22] David
[1:15:27] Hallelujah let's look let's look again
[1:15:30] um I'm just about to close I guess
[1:15:32] brother Tim borrowed the time from me
[1:15:36] so we'll uh we'll just shave off a
[1:15:39] little bit here for him on
[1:15:44] Sunday so if we look at this the Holy
[1:15:47] Ghost Promised Land Battle it shows
[1:15:51] you'll face deception
[1:15:55] you might fall but you won't fall
[1:15:56] permanently right amen God will take
[1:15:59] care of that he'll correct you and set
[1:16:02] you up on your
[1:16:04] feet now you say the elect cannot be
[1:16:06] deceived Jason dears how can you say
[1:16:08] that the elect cannot be deceived okay
[1:16:11] so you the minute you were born again
[1:16:12] you had every Doctrine perfectly right
[1:16:15] you understood all everything from start
[1:16:18] to finish you never made a mistake in
[1:16:21] how you understood everything that
[1:16:22] brother br
[1:16:24] said you're laughing why are you
[1:16:27] laughing isn't that
[1:16:31] true it's not true you can you can in
[1:16:34] your walk but
[1:16:36] ultimately God will see to it that his
[1:16:38] people are not deceived amen that's
[1:16:42] right God take God will take care of
[1:16:44] that he'll correct you it just depends
[1:16:46] on how painful it wants you want it to
[1:16:49] be and he'll set you up on your feet
[1:16:52] amen and he'll help you continue walking
[1:16:55] you'll
[1:16:56] face battles that are lost because of
[1:16:59] sin but God will take care of that too
[1:17:03] and he'll correct you and he'll set you
[1:17:05] on your
[1:17:06] feet you'll face ups and downs and
[1:17:09] backsliding against
[1:17:10] God you'll face failures and defeats
[1:17:13] you'll have great victories you'll see
[1:17:15] the supernatural power go of God at work
[1:17:19] in your life yeah you'll be ultimately
[1:17:22] you're going to be victorious you'll be
[1:17:24] an overcomer because that's the
[1:17:25] direction that God is leading his people
[1:17:29] and you're one of them amen he's leading
[1:17:32] you into the millennial rest amen that's
[1:17:35] what he gave you the holy ghost in the
[1:17:37] first place for right each age a part of
[1:17:40] the word is allotted to that age what
[1:17:44] does that mean it means that there's a
[1:17:46] people on the Earth that are receiving
[1:17:48] that word and that it's not just the
[1:17:50] word is preached in that age well well
[1:17:53] that's nice but for what purpose there's
[1:17:55] got to be a purpose that the word is
[1:17:57] sent for and the word is to go from the
[1:17:59] the mouth of the preacher into the
[1:18:01] hearts of the people so that something
[1:18:02] is accomplished in their life in that
[1:18:04] particular age so the word is sent in
[1:18:08] our age and is allotted to this age the
[1:18:11] fullness of the word so the fullness of
[1:18:13] the word is to achieve what the measure
[1:18:16] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[1:18:18] in you so if that's what God has
[1:18:21] allotted to this age then buckle up
[1:18:25] that's what he's going to do in
[1:18:27] you that's what he's going to accomplish
[1:18:29] in you musicians if you'd
[1:18:35] come 1 Peter 4:12 says beloved think it
[1:18:38] not strange concerning the fiery trial
[1:18:41] which is to try you as though some
[1:18:42] strange
[1:18:44] thing has happened unto you it wasn't
[1:18:47] strange that the children of Israel went
[1:18:50] into the promised land and met enemies
[1:18:54] right wasn't that to be expected yes sir
[1:18:58] isn't that what you're prepared to do
[1:19:01] when you get the Holy
[1:19:02] Ghost don't be surprised that you're
[1:19:06] going to face enemies amen that's right
[1:19:09] because that's the whole point is you're
[1:19:11] to conquer those enemies so that you can
[1:19:14] become a reflection of Jesus
[1:19:16] Christ brother bamman God of this evil
[1:19:19] age says we find now this evil age is to
[1:19:21] prove to Satan she the bride is not like
[1:19:24] Eve that she is not that type of a woman
[1:19:28] and she'll be Tried by his word the
[1:19:30] Bride As Adam's bride was Tried by the
[1:19:33] word so we'll be Tried by the word but
[1:19:34] we're going to prove that we're not
[1:19:36] going to fall like Eve did like the
[1:19:39] other Church ages did but that will stay
[1:19:42] true to the fullness of the word and
[1:19:45] that will actually be a manifestation of
[1:19:47] the fullness of that that word amen
[1:19:51] let's bow our head let's stand and bow
[1:19:52] our heads

[1:29:51] message message for many years but cute
[1:29:54] little testimony his son Anthony brought
[1:29:58] a prayer cloth to the hospital and his

[1:30:07] happened to hand him the prayer cloth
[1:30:10] and um she looked and she was
[1:30:13] inquisitive and she asked what is that
[1:30:17] and it was so neat because here's this
[1:30:19] brother that was practically in a coma
[1:30:21] few days before that little gift of
[1:30:24] light just started and he smiled and he

[1:31:09] really fights you on things and uh
[1:31:12] several days before the uh meetings I
[1:31:15] had woken up in the middle of the night
[1:31:17] and I just had really some terrible
[1:31:20] stomach pain as you all know the Lord
[1:31:22] healed me of stomach condition uh
[1:31:25] several years ago now and uh but I had
[1:31:28] woken up and it was felt like it was I
[1:31:31] mean I hadn't felt like that in years it
[1:31:32] was horrible
[1:31:34] and debil debilitating for the next
