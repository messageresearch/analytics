[0:00] this house Stanford word of Prayer
[0:06] Heavenly Father Lord we just
[0:08] want to thank you for this opportunity
[0:10] to be gathered together in your house
[0:12] again Lord
[0:14] father we're just need you to come upon
[0:16] the scene Lord you see this little
[0:17] thought I have father I just pray God
[0:18] may you come and anoint it may you
[0:20] anoint their ears May something be said
[0:22] to be a blessing
[0:23] father we just place this service in
[0:25] your hands in Jesus name amen
[0:28] in Philippians 2 5 you don't have to
[0:30] turn they should have it on the screen
[0:33] let this mind be in you
[0:35] which was also in Christ Jesus
[0:38] may God add a blessings you can have
[0:40] your seats
[0:41] now I had something totally different I
[0:43] was going to do
[0:45] JD had asked me a couple weeks ago so
[0:48] I'll say I'm good I've got I've got this
[0:51] one covered
[0:52] didn't have to do much I had something
[0:54] prepared and ready to go so whenever I
[0:56] got to ask
[0:57] within Friday night of course you know
[0:59] how that goes
[1:00] my mind got changed
[1:02] as I sit and going over this scripture
[1:04] here
[1:05] I just
[1:06] couldn't get away from it and
[1:09] come to find out that the one I was
[1:11] going to do was going to be about
[1:13] being an overcomer
[1:15] but then the more I got into this and
[1:18] yesterday
[1:19] I found a quote that actually you know
[1:21] what I should do this one first and then
[1:23] I have another one in two or three weeks
[1:25] do the overcomer
[1:27] so the title is having the mind of
[1:30] Christ
[1:32] up in Philippians chapter 2 verse one
[1:34] let's read that real quick
[1:37] and Paul was just saying if thou be
[1:40] therefore any consolation in Christ
[1:43] if anybody's got any comfort of love
[1:46] if anybody has fellowship with a spirit
[1:48] if anybody has battles of Mercy fulfill
[1:52] ye my joy that ye be like-minded having
[1:55] the same love being of one Accord
[1:59] and of one mind
[2:01] it's Paul who who's Paul talking about
[2:03] here
[2:04] is Paul talking about himself
[2:07] do you want to have my mind
[2:09] do you need my mind
[2:12] or your pastor's mind
[2:14] or your wife's mind or your brother or
[2:16] sister's mind it's he's not speaking of
[2:18] that because he brings back down in
[2:20] verse five let this mind be in you which
[2:23] also was in Christ Jesus
[2:26] so what mind is that
[2:28] what mind was in Jesus it was the mind
[2:31] of God
[2:33] it was the word
[2:35] I got thinking about this scripture
[2:38] and I got thinking about you know if I'm
[2:39] wrong y'all forgive me if I'm wrong I'll
[2:41] be corrected not and I want to be
[2:44] but why did Paul use the name this way
[2:47] Christ Jesus
[2:49] why did he say Jesus
[2:52] let this mind that was in Jesus be in
[2:54] you
[2:55] why do you say let this man that was in
[2:57] Christ Jesus be in you
[3:00] of course we all know we're taught that
[3:01] Jesus was a human being
[3:03] Jesus had thoughts human thoughts Jesus
[3:07] was depressed
[3:09] you know people makes fun of you you get
[3:11] depressed
[3:12] people's fun of you get your feelings
[3:14] hurt
[3:15] all these all these human thoughts that
[3:17] Jesus Jesus had Jesus would heal Christ
[3:20] through Jesus would heal the sick then
[3:23] Jesus would silver only on a rock
[3:25] groaning with the headache
[3:28] so Jesus so if we had the mind of Jesus
[3:30] what would we be doing
[3:33] just bear with me you know Jesus cried
[3:37] you know when Jesus walked up to the
[3:39] tomb of Lazarus Mary and Martha was
[3:41] sitting there and they're just they're
[3:42] just all sad their brother died
[3:45] Lazarus was one of Jesus's best friends
[3:47] Jesus cried that's what the Bible said
[3:49] Jesus wept but what happened when Jesus
[3:52] stepped up to the
[3:53] to The Rock
[3:55] turn roll the stone away
[3:58] that's when Christ took over when Jesus
[4:00] was asleep in the boat
[4:02] he was tired Jesus was just sleeping he
[4:06] was wore out from preaching
[4:08] the storm didn't even wake him up but
[4:10] what happened
[4:11] when Jesus stepped up on there Christ
[4:14] could do what no human could do
[4:18] Jesus was only Jesus until he was 30
[4:20] years old
[4:21] because we know when Jesus went down and
[4:23] got baptized and brought back up the
[4:25] spirit of the Holy Ghost fell upon him
[4:26] that's when he becomes Jesus Christ
[4:29] that's when he becomes Jesus Christ so
[4:32] his let this mind that was in Christ
[4:34] Jesus be in you
[4:36] so what can we do could we go create a
[4:39] world
[4:42] Hallelujah but let this mind of Christ
[4:46] Jesus be in you
[4:48] let this mind of the Son of God be in
[4:52] you
[4:54] so if we have his mind we are his word
[4:59] you know it's like my brother Branham
[5:00] was out in the woods and
[5:04] God spoke says what are you hunting for
[5:08] Brothers says I'm hunting for squirrel
[5:10] what you speak it
[5:12] so he has him as a man could not speak a
[5:15] squirrel into existence
[5:17] right so we have which one of us could
[5:19] go speak our world into existence
[5:22] which one of us could heal our own self
[5:25] we can't with our own thinking we have
[5:27] to have a mind change
[5:30] yo like I said a minute ago if we have
[5:32] his word if we have his mind we are his
[5:35] word and we will do what his word says
[5:37] so when his word says
[5:39] wives submit yourselves to your husbands
[5:42] husbands submit yourselves to God
[5:45] we just do it
[5:47] if we have the mind of Christ it becomes
[5:49] automatic
[5:51] Hallelujah we don't have to think about
[5:53] it because we don't have our own mind we
[5:57] just we have his mind so we don't have
[5:59] to think we don't have to worry about it
[6:01] it's no longer how we think things
[6:03] should be we don't even have a thought
[6:05] coming
[6:07] according and with this mind of Christ
[6:10] Jesus we obey every word
[6:15] we just don't obey parts that we like
[6:18] that's easy to do
[6:20] it's a parts that hurts us it's the
[6:22] parts we don't like now we've been
[6:24] hearing some tough preaching last couple
[6:26] of weeks
[6:28] with some of squirming our seats and
[6:31] biting her fingernails and say oh Lord
[6:33] how much longer they got up here to
[6:34] preach because they're really getting on
[6:35] us it's some stuff that really hurts us
[6:37] but we say Amen to every word with the
[6:40] mind of Christ we'll say Amen to every
[6:43] word
[6:44] you know bro Jaden brother Jason been
[6:46] letting it out here
[6:48] you know that on feminism and all kinds
[6:51] there is too much of that there's
[6:52] there's also too much male chauvinism
[6:55] I'm just gonna go ahead and put my two
[6:56] cents in it since I'm here
[6:59] the women act the way they do because
[7:01] the men act the way we do
[7:04] you guys see these girls in these
[7:06] messages growing up they're wanting to
[7:08] to be their own person they're wanting
[7:11] to go to school get an education get a
[7:13] career and be their own person because
[7:15] they see the way their dads acted
[7:18] I grew up in this message I've seen the
[7:19] way the men I treated the women the
[7:21] women like a bunch of doormats
[7:24] they that's not the mind of Christ if
[7:26] Christ don't treat us that way does he
[7:29] come in these men come in and says give
[7:32] me a glass of water give me this all
[7:34] bossing around
[7:37] that's not the head of a household is it
[7:39] that's not the mind of Christ no wonder
[7:42] the girls are being the way they are
[7:43] because the men are the way they see
[7:45] their fathers but if the fathers would
[7:48] get in our place I'm putting myself and
[7:50] the wives will get in their place the
[7:52] kids will get theirs but it's all out a
[7:54] cater we need to change our thinking we
[7:57] need to get this mind of Christ
[8:01] Hallelujah y'all go for quiet
[8:05] so if a man would get his position the
[8:06] woman would get in theirs
[8:09] it will put us all back the way we were
[8:11] supposed to be it'll put our homes back
[8:13] in order that way God's
[8:17] it was God's way for us to be
[8:21] Hallelujah with his mind we will
[8:23] recognize the word to be the truth
[8:27] and it lives right through us and you
[8:29] can't help it
[8:31] you can't help living this way when the
[8:34] mind of Christ is in you with this mind
[8:36] of Christ we seek what he thinks we act
[8:40] the way he would act if we have the mind
[8:43] of Christ then you can say what you will
[8:48] and it'll come to pass
[8:50] Hallelujah
[8:53] we can't do that with our own mind
[8:57] right like I said you can't go
[8:59] speak a world to existence
[9:03] that's why we need the mind of Christ
[9:05] because our thinking gets us in trouble
[9:07] well I thought well I thought
[9:10] I did a lot of thinking thought got me
[9:13] in trouble
[9:14] Christ Jesus let this mind that was in
[9:17] Christ Jesus be in you
[9:21] what were your thoughts just today
[9:23] already
[9:26] oh I better get up and go to church
[9:29] if I don't the Pastoral the deacons will
[9:32] be calling me where you been why were
[9:34] you in church today
[9:36] my thought was I can't wait to get here
[9:38] I can't wait till church to start well
[9:41] after my part's over with
[9:43] huh
[9:44] the mind of Christ should be operating
[9:47] Among Us
[9:49] but in order for that to happen we need
[9:52] to lose our own mind
[9:54] says what we need today is a good
[9:59] old-fashioned Backwoods sky blue sin
[10:03] killing religion and the baptism of the
[10:05] Holy Ghost back in the church again a
[10:07] cleaning out Gun Barrel straight sky
[10:10] blue religion we need a cleaning out
[10:12] that's Starting Over Again
[10:15] that's the truth I'm not beside myself
[10:18] he says I may be mad but as I said last
[10:22] night I may feel I but I feel good this
[10:25] way I never did feel this way the other
[10:28] way
[10:29] so I just like to stay this way I did
[10:32] lose my mind I had to to find the mind
[10:36] of Christ
[10:38] every other believer has to that's right
[10:42] he says has to find the mind of Christ
[10:45] by losing our own mind
[10:49] but as long as we got our mind we can't
[10:51] find his again he says if you have the
[10:54] mind of Christ Christ will Express
[10:56] himself through you
[11:00] shows that
[11:02] shows that it's him not you
[11:05] you'll say he says some people are under
[11:07] illusions of things they go out become
[11:09] insane
[11:11] we know that's wrong that's the devil
[11:13] trying to impersonate the real thing
[11:16] before it gets here
[11:18] there's always a bogus he says you know
[11:21] we always go and say that man has lost
[11:22] his mind you see him do that he has lost
[11:24] his mind
[11:26] well he's under the control of the devil
[11:28] I like for some people look at us say
[11:30] they've lost their mind
[11:32] those people are crazy yes we are
[11:34] because we have the mind of Christ
[11:38] I mean he's lost her mind
[11:40] a real man is to lose his own thoughts
[11:45] his own thinking
[11:47] not come up blindly like that you come
[11:50] up with your right senses Christ takes
[11:53] you over and expresses himself
[11:55] and now through the world you're an
[11:57] insane person now if you're saying
[11:59] you're actually insane
[12:00] then there's nothing the devil can devil
[12:03] can't take you in complete control
[12:05] Hallelujah if you're insane with God the
[12:08] devil can't even take you in his control
[12:10] he'll make you do everything contrary
[12:13] if he has a control of you but when
[12:16] Christ takes you over he'll Express that
[12:19] word right through you
[12:22] because it's him because he is the word
[12:26] we cannot alter God's word
[12:30] we can't make the word say what we want
[12:32] it to say
[12:33] how many how many of us like to
[12:36] human being
[12:38] some of us likes to alter the word but
[12:39] we can't
[12:41] we cannot alter God's word we have to
[12:44] alter our thinking to his thinking so
[12:47] let the mind of Christ be in you and
[12:51] then you'll think what he thinks
[12:53] well when we lose our thinking what's
[12:55] happening in Romans chapter 12 verse 2
[13:01] he says be not conformed to this world
[13:07] but be ye transformed
[13:10] this work transformed means to metaphors
[13:13] I hope I said that right metamorphosis
[13:16] change into a different physical form
[13:19] especially by Supernatural means to
[13:22] change the appearance or character
[13:25] of he was like a butterfly
[13:28] and when he starts it's a worm
[13:30] crawled on the ground
[13:32] eating what he eats
[13:35] and then it comes a certain time of life
[13:37] it grows a a cocoon around itself
[13:40] and a little while later out comes this
[13:42] butterfly
[13:43] is transformed
[13:46] to change into another form to
[13:49] transfigure
[13:50] you know Christ's appearance was changed
[13:52] mural Mount Transfiguration
[13:54] brother Brown says to be transformed is
[13:57] to be changed and made something
[13:58] different
[13:59] it's like a tadpole
[14:02] it's transformed from a tadpole to a
[14:04] frog once it would look like a little
[14:06] fish swimming he swims around he's got a
[14:08] head to tail everything looks just like
[14:10] a fish and then after a while it begins
[14:12] to lose its tail it'll transform from
[14:15] one species to another
[14:17] so instead of swimming it's hopping
[14:20] it got transformed
[14:26] you know what conformed is
[14:28] be not conformed to this world but be ye
[14:31] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[14:34] renewing of your mind the things that
[14:36] you once thought upon to be precious lay
[14:39] that aside
[14:40] but be transformed to something else
[14:43] what you were one time to what you are
[14:46] now see
[14:48] by the renewing of your mind
[14:51] be not conformed to this world but be ye
[14:54] transformed by the renewing
[14:57] I love this definition of renewing
[15:00] renovation
[15:02] that's my job
[15:05] that's what I do for a living I renovate
[15:08] I build
[15:10] we got a woman that that she buys these
[15:12] old houses and you she'll say come on
[15:15] look at this house what can we do this
[15:16] place and you look at it you're like
[15:18] burn it
[15:20] tear it down build a new one on top of
[15:22] it
[15:23] but when you go in
[15:25] you start demolishing everything
[15:27] you'll go in here rip out the kitchen
[15:29] you'll rip out the bathrooms you'll rip
[15:31] up the floor you'll take out walls put
[15:32] in beams and you'll put in a new kitchen
[15:34] new bathrooms new floors new sheetrock
[15:37] new paint is totally different
[15:39] you've actually renewed this house
[15:42] it was a complete renovation
[15:46] this house has been changed for the
[15:48] better it no longer looks the way it did
[15:52] before
[15:53] the house is no longer acting like it
[15:55] did before
[15:56] it was it's been transformed so this
[15:58] house was transformed by the renewing
[16:04] be not conform to this world but be
[16:06] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[16:08] we have to have our minds renewed to
[16:12] change the way we were thinking
[16:14] we were conformed at one time to this
[16:16] world we did whatever the world wants to
[16:19] do
[16:20] right we were thinking one way because
[16:22] we didn't have the right mind we had our
[16:25] own mind but we needed a renewal
[16:29] we need a renovation
[16:31] one day we were thinking our own
[16:33] thoughts doing our own things we were
[16:35] conformed to this world we were like a
[16:37] bunch of robots
[16:39] controlled by something
[16:42] pick up this drink pick up this
[16:44] cigarette
[16:45] shoot up this drug we were doing what we
[16:48] were told to do we were robots we were
[16:50] conformed to this world
[16:52] we had our own mind
[16:56] go this bar listen to this song we were
[16:59] doing what we were told we're just like
[17:00] robots automatic automatic doing what
[17:03] the devil in your mind told you to do
[17:05] but with
[17:06] that's when our mind was controlled by
[17:08] the devil you see when God has played
[17:10] but a God had placed the seed down on
[17:12] the inside of us
[17:14] before the foundation of the world
[17:19] that seed laid there inside you dormant
[17:23] no life there but all of a sudden one
[17:26] day light life struck that seed
[17:29] then we had a renewing
[17:33] we had a renewing
[17:35] then we saw our lives being transformed
[17:39] or once we were doing things out here
[17:42] that was wrong we now find ourselves oh
[17:44] we can't do that no more
[17:46] we have to dress right we have to act
[17:49] right we can no longer drink that
[17:51] we can no longer eat that
[17:54] eat the things in the world we changed
[17:56] our what we've eaten we changed our way
[17:58] of thinking
[18:00] Hallelujah we took on the mind of Christ
[18:03] then we started being transformed into
[18:06] something
[18:09] totally different
[18:12] it was the old there was an old brother
[18:15] George it's no longer there no more
[18:18] you know you go you meet your friends
[18:20] that you had out in the world
[18:22] where you been brother Luther
[18:25] why ain't you been to our parties why
[18:28] ain't you done this with us we used to
[18:30] have some good times
[18:33] so oh that old man's dead
[18:35] I've had a renewing I don't do those
[18:37] things no more I changed what I'm
[18:40] thinking my got the mind of Christ
[18:42] they've changed exactly or what I'm not
[18:45] who I used to be I am totally different
[18:48] hahaha
[18:50] Hallelujah
[18:54] were our thoughts were always negative
[18:58] right
[18:59] sometimes our thoughts still are
[19:01] negative
[19:03] I've been prayed for this thing over and
[19:05] over
[19:06] and I can't get healed
[19:07] I've prayed that I've had people pray
[19:09] for me over this beseting sin and I
[19:11] can't get rid of it
[19:14] Hallelujah
[19:16] we always thought the worst in every
[19:18] situation
[19:21] but now with the mind of Christ Our
[19:23] thinking should be changed
[19:25] we should be thinking different thoughts
[19:27] with the mind of Christ Paul and a
[19:29] couple of couple chapters later in
[19:31] Philippians 4 8 says finally brethren
[19:34] whatsoever things are true
[19:36] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[19:40] things are just whatsoever things are
[19:43] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[19:46] whatsoever things are of a good report
[19:49] if there be any virtue
[19:52] think
[19:54] on these things
[19:58] he tells exactly what to think
[20:00] lose our mind
[20:03] you say you've lost your mind
[20:06] his spirit is here
[20:08] if we can just let our mind
[20:12] drift into his
[20:15] let this mind
[20:18] that was in Christ be in you
[20:24] I want to read the part of this prayer
[20:26] we're in leadership it's right before we
[20:28] went off the scene
[20:29] he says oh God
[20:31] let me go Lord
[20:34] don't leave me behind Jesus let me go
[20:38] with you father I don't want to stay
[20:40] here on this Earth to watch these
[20:42] tribulations coming on I don't want to
[20:45] stay here in this Insanity I don't want
[20:48] to stand here when the Hideous sights
[20:50] but people losing their mind we look at
[20:53] men trying to act like beasts we
[20:56] wow we're here look like beasts the
[20:59] women trying to look like animals
[21:01] with the paint on their faces and
[21:04] knowing that these things are predicted
[21:05] to happen
[21:07] they go they'll go insane until the
[21:09] locusts will rise up with hair like
[21:12] women
[21:13] to Halt the women teeth like lions and
[21:16] things that you said
[21:18] the mental condition of the people will
[21:21] be completely gone
[21:24] we see it in the making now
[21:27] Lord
[21:28] help us
[21:29] restore us to the same mind of Christ
[21:33] Jesus our lord
[21:37] hallelujah what a time that's going to
[21:39] be
[21:41] we don't want to be here
[21:43] when these things take place we know
[21:44] what all this is all about
[21:46] when this all happens we're gonna be
[21:48] here
[21:50] gotta change your mind our mind starts
[21:52] thinking rapture
[21:54] we start thinking Rapture is going to
[21:56] take place one day
[21:57] have the mind of Christ have the mind of
[22:00] Christ in you
[22:02] because we have the mind of Christ
[22:05] and this leads up and I'm gonna quit
[22:07] early because I don't want to go further
[22:09] this leads up into the next one because
[22:11] we have the mind of Christ
[22:13] blessed are your eyes
[22:15] for they see and your ears
[22:18] because they hear
[22:20] and this quote right here it's a little
[22:22] empty but I want to read this
[22:24] to get us ready for next time
[22:26] the holy spirit in every age
[22:29] he that hath and ear let him hear what
[22:32] the spirit said to the churches
[22:36] there is not one Church age where this
[22:39] verse is not mentioned every single age
[22:42] has the same admonition to the people of
[22:44] every age he that hath an ear let him
[22:47] hear
[22:49] hmm let him hear what the spirit saith
[22:53] but it's absolutely impossible for all
[22:55] men to hear what the spirit says
[22:58] to the different ages in First
[22:59] Corinthians it says how be it we speak
[23:01] wisdom among them that are perfect ye
[23:03] not wisdom of this world nor the
[23:05] princess of this world they come to not
[23:09] but we speak the wisdom of God in
[23:12] mystery
[23:14] even the hidden wisdom which God
[23:16] ordained before the world unto our Glory
[23:19] which none of the princes of this world
[23:22] do for they had known it they would not
[23:24] have crucified the Lord of Glory
[23:27] but as it is written I have not seen ear
[23:31] hath
[23:32] ear hath not heard neither have entered
[23:34] into the heart of man the things which
[23:37] God hath prepared for him that love him
[23:41] but God we hath revealed them unto us by
[23:46] his spirit for the spirit
[23:48] searches all things
[23:50] the Deep things of God for what man
[23:53] knoweth the things of man saved the
[23:55] spirit of man which is in him
[23:58] even so the things of God knoweth no man
[24:01] but the spirit of God now we have
[24:04] received not the spirit of the world but
[24:07] the spirit which is of god that we might
[24:10] know the things of God
[24:12] which were freely given to us by God
[24:15] which things also we speak
[24:20] of God for their foolishness unto them
[24:24] unto him neither can he know them
[24:26] because they are spiritually discerned
[24:29] you but he that is spiritual spiritual
[24:32] judges all things yet he himself is
[24:36] judged of no man
[24:39] for He Who hath known the mind of the
[24:41] Lord
[24:43] that he may instruct him but we have the
[24:48] mind of Christ
[24:51] that's why Jesus says therefore I speak
[24:53] to them in Parables because they sin see
[24:56] not
[24:59] and herein they hear not neither do they
[25:02] understand for this people's heart is
[25:05] wax gross and their ears are dull of
[25:07] hearing and their eyes have been closed
[25:11] lest at any time they shall see with
[25:13] their eyes and hear with their ears and
[25:15] should understand with their heart that
[25:18] they should be converted and I should
[25:20] heal them
[25:22] the last statement but blessed are your
[25:25] eyes
[25:26] for they see and your ears for they hear
[25:30] Hallelujah
[25:32] Hallelujah
[25:34] that's just a preview of the next time
[25:37] let this mind that was in Christ Jesus
[25:40] be
[25:42] in you
[25:45] we're not going to go nowhere without it
[25:48] we're just gonna be sitting on the pew
[25:51] service after service with our own
[25:53] thinking change our way of thinking
