in Jesus name amen if you could take a little bit of the high out of this that'd be great if you have your Bibles young people we're going to look here in Acts 12 tonight look here in Acts 12 we bring greetings from our pastor brother Tim puit in the church there at evening light the saints of God we uh we certainly love your pastor he's a dear friend and been a great friend through the years and enjoyed his ministry along with brother Matt and the other ministers here you know it's nice to have a foundation you can just kind of when you're out surfing and you can find different ministers that are in line with this message and preaching the truth and it's just so wonderful thing happy to have my wife here with me you know as our kids grew up brother Jason she's able to travel with me a lot more more so we're definitely glad for that and then but my kids are traveled out all right I'm done I'm don't sing are y'all GNA stay up here the whole time y'all gonna give me preacher cords and all that good stuff it's like man I'm telling you what all right I'm expecting something out of you brother Tony hey man I know where you come from you bring that up from Florida so we're going to look here tonight and I want to take a simple thought uh I'm going a seven timer for one hour I don't know if that's too long or too short I I go to church where the pastor preaches two two and a half hours for a youth meeting no I'm just kidding but he does preach a long time he so uh I'm gonna try to be very uh constrained just to one hour tonight but I'll let you know when I set my clock I had said it yet we're going to look here acts 12 and verse1 it says now about the time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to Vex certain of the church and he killed James the brother of John with a sword and because he saw that it pleased the Jews he proceeded further to take Peter also then were the days of un leaven bread and when he had apprehended him he put him in prison and delivered him to the for uh qurans of soldiers to keep him after Easter to bring him forth to the people Peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him and when Herod would have brought him forth the same night Peter was sleeping between Two Soldiers bound with two chains and the keepers before the door kept to prison and behold the angel of the Lord came upon him and a light shined in the prison and he smoked Peter on the side and raised him up saying arise up quickly and his chains fell off of him off of his hands and the angel said unto him G thyself and B on so he did and he said unto him cast thy G about thee and follow me and he went out and he followed him not that it was true which was done that he saw a vision and when they were past the first and second ward they came unto the Iron Gate that leadth into the city which opened to them of its own accord and they went out and they passed on through the street for for withth the angel departed from him and Peter was come to himself he said now I know of assy that the Lord has sent his Angel and has delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from from all the expectation of the people of the Jews you can have your seats tonight this thing keeps cutting out is that is that just me use use that Brad's going to switch to that I'm G to switch to this no we're gnaas is for clothing and was clad with Zeal as a cloak verse 19 so they that fear the name of the Lord a awesome those that fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him so many of us at some point in our lives whether you're a young person here on the front rows tonight or whether you're an older person sitting back in the back at some point of your Christian Journey you have faced an onslaught of the enemy all you going to have to work with me tonight I'm a preacher so we we find that Satan has come and he's attacked and you have faced his attack you've encountered his accus ations you've endured his sicknesses you've come against his schemes you you you you know you faced these things and some of us even the great of us we have we have fall victim to his lies yes yes even the great of us even the great preachers that we hold in such a high level they have even Fallen victim to Satan's Onslaught but I want you to know that's how the enemy does in a great battle plan if the enemy can surround you on all sides he knows that the victory is is about to happen and that's exactly what the enemy tries to do he tries to attack you on all sides he attacks your body he attacks your mind he'll attack your family he'll attack your relationships he'll attack your ministry he'll attack your church he'll come in and tell you things are false when in fact they are true he'll tell you you don't have the Holy Ghost when in fact your life lines up with it he does all these things to come against you to destroy your walk right now we find out that the enemy comes in like a flood and we understand the Bible tells us and I believe the writers put the comma in the wrong spot cuz it says when the enemy comes in like a flood we think the enemy is the flood but really in fact the Bible should read like this when the enemy comes in come like a flood the power of God come on somebody like a flood the spirit of the Lord will raise up a standard against it come on there's not one of us here tonight that hadn't faced the own s of the enemy but you're here tonight you're still standing tonight why because the spirit of God have lifted up a standard for you do you believe that tonight and I love what he says in verse 17 here it says he put on righteousness as a breastplate and a Helen of Salvation was upon his head and he put on the garments of Vengeance your God means business come on this ain't some panty waste pushover God he puts on the breastplate of righteousness he puts on garments of Vengeance and he's come to this service tonight to fight your battle all right oh Hallelujah notice according to their deeds accordingly he will repay oh I love that come on devil attack tonight cuz I got a greater God come on with it come on with your own s cuz there's going to be a a standard living lifted tonight yes and I just love how this says they they say that this phrase here it reminds them of a great impetuous stream or Force because water has an ability to not only wash out it only has ability to only to wipe out but it also brother Jason has the ability to cut deep cords and deep deep Canyons in in as we see out there in Arizona uh the Grand Canyon there was made by water and I want you to know that the Holy Ghost can come into this service tonight though you just came from a great camp meeting and yet you may have left there with something suppressed something pushed back but I want you to know that the spirit of the Lord can come in tonight and wash things out of your life WIP things out of your home it can come in those things that you have suppressed it can cut deep inside and rip those things outen things that happened to you maybe when you was a child things that happened to you that you didn't think anything about but it's hindering you from walking with the Lord he hindering you from giving your all come on young people get with it tonight the power of the word of God is a surgeon's hand and it can cut in and cut out I remember just about five years ago my son and I went to make a Facebook uh uh Marketplace buy all right cuz I did a lot of buying and selling back in the day and I I'm thinking I'm going to get my daughter this was Lauren was probably 13 maybe it's been a lot longer than that anyway I was going to get her a new the iPhone x this is a long time ago right iPhone x and the guy had it and he had a good price on it 200 bucks man I ain't passing that up it was so great that I got out of the deer stand early and I went me and my son he was probably what was Joseph 14 13 14 years old when we get there and I wait in this parking lot it was sketchy yeah hey there an iPhone 10 was worth it a sketchy part of town but this guy finally came and I drove a Mercedes at the time and uh I pulled up and somehow my do is unlocked wow and so I meet this guy he had a hoodie on pulled over his head he gets in my back seat and brother Jason he pulls out a knife this long and he holds it up to my throat give me all your money and I started fighting with them put is I could have took the little fella I mean hey I was like hold on dog you in the wrong car not today but I was pushing his hand away as I pushed his hand away the knife got closer to my son and I realized he said I'll stab you I'll kill you right here give me all your money I'm like 250 bucks $200 ain't worth it so I reached in my console and gave him the money and he got out but I want you to know that has traumatized my son today he still don't like he doesn't like being in big crowds he still don't like being in certain areas of neighborhoods it traumatized him but what am I telling you that the Holy Spirit can come even tonight something that maybe you didn't allow you didn't want to happen but it happened when you was a child and it happened and it tormented you and it destroyed you and it's keeping you from giving your off the Holy Ghost tonight has the opportunity and the power to cut those things out of your life that's true the word of God is powerful it's quick it's sharper than a two-edged sword and we have a promise in the word that God will raise a standard on our behalf yes that's not up for debate on he will raise the standard whether you're young whether you're old whether you're blind whether you're whether you're crazy if you are a Believer if you are a son of God and a daughter of God tonight he will raise your standard for you he will not allow the enemy to come against his little bride he will fight for you let me tell you there's not a man of God here tonight a husband that won't stand for their wife won't stand for their children and you think God ain't going to stand for it Hallelujah that's true we find here that the children of Israel when they left Egypt I got to kind of pace myself when they left Egypt man they thought it was great this is great we moving but sometimes you move in the wrong places sometimes where God leads you you think man this is what serving the Lord's about look at me I'm in a trap so here they're leaving and now they at a place brother Jason they got mountains on this side they got mountains on that side they got a great big vast River in front of them or a sea in front of them and then they got an angry Pharaoh an angry Pharaoh now he's repenting that he let them go and we find here that God LED them down to that area yeah God is the one that ordained he had a blueprint already printed out and said Moses I know you don't know where you're going but I'm leading you right here this is where I'm bringing you to because God was about to display his power God was about to display the standard being lifted and when pharaoh and his army was coming what did God do God spoke to Moses he said come on Moses quit crying to me about this situation quit talking to me about it I've given you the word I put thus sayith the Lord in your mouth you are my voice you are my mouthpiece now speak to the children of Israel that they'll go forward in Victory and what did he do he spoke to the Red Sea and their sea split open and they walked through on dry ground all right yeah come on I'm talking to other believers this morning mayy you got a situation you don't know how you're going to get through all you see is a trouble on this side all you see is the mountains on that side all you hear is a threat to the enemy from behind you but I want you to know God has promised I'll raise a standard I'll bring you through I'll see you through your red trial I'll see you through to Victory I'll bring you to the other side true brother I like how brother B will say when all hell has turned loose on you all of Heaven has turned loose also when all hell has turned loose all of Heaven think about all of Heaven for just a minute every Prophet that's already on the other side think about every believer already made it on the other side think about your Samson your jeffa these great these great judges Through the Bible think about some of the great women the the ray and these different ones they're already on the other side they made it why can't you they trusted why can't we that's good so we find all of Heaven they're there cheering you on whether you hear it or not Satan may think he's got the upper hand and make you think he's got you right where he wants you but God had a setup set this scene up just like he's setting this one up in leod DEA he knows exactly what he's doing and when all hell's turn loose on You Hell may be against you hell may be around you he may be trying to draw you in and take you out but I want you to know tonight all of Heaven is for you all of Heaven is behind you this ministry and this ministry team here at Beth Tabernacle is for you this morning or this evening this church is for you the message is for you the Holy Ghost is for you moms and dads are for you we're for you tonight when Heaven is here tell you all the shackles of hell can break away tonight and he's here tonight he's here to bring you into a greater atmosphere a greater relationship he's here to take you out of that prison that you've been in that prison of unbelief and walk you out to Freedom all right Amen brother now we understand that the greatest battle ever placed or ever fought was in the human mind and we find there that Satan is trying to test the power and the strength against you know his strength and his power over God's strength and God's power and he comes and he brings a tax on you to see if you really believe what you say claim that you believe do you really believe he's a Healer do you really believe he's a deliverer do you really believe he can give the Holy Ghost to young people in this day and age yes sir when so many have walked away so many have forgot about this message they turned their back against this message do you really believe that it really is the voice of God for this last day and so Satan will put you under attack he'll put you under his microscope he He he'll aim every gun in Hell on you but what am I telling you tonight let me tell you he can't have enough to stop what God's already deposited on the inside of a Son of God tonight God put a seed on the inside and no matter what that seed has to go through no matter what attack it has to face God is determined to see that seed to Victory and I believe I'm talking to seeds tonight young people older people that are going to make the victory there are going to be the Victorious ones so Satan will come and he'll attack you with reasoning and doubts and try to get you to whether you truly believe the word or not he test you to see if you believe what you claim to believe we find brother B would tell us in the greatest battle ever fought when this great battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin for the battle to rage and that Battleground be in the human mind yes now how many of you young people ever had a mind battle the rest of y'all not here tonight we've all all right now let's young people turn around look at these older people in the back I know they old they look decrepit but that's okay how many you've ever had a battle mine battle old people oh my it was a lot more old hands go up see that's something that we all must face why the mind you ever wondered about that that little gray matter you know if you could peel your now we ain't going to go there I just think that little gray matter matters so much that Satan chose the mind but thankfully God chose your heart yes but see he chose the mind because he knows that's where the place where decisions are made and so what does Satan try to do Satan tries to influence your decisions Satan will get you on every social media platform oh you thinking man they gonna like this click click and you got no likes oh now you done had a bad day now you're in now you're in depression because nobody liked you like you thought this was a cool pick look at me haha click click click and ain't nobody liking your click and now you all down in the dumps now you all depressed now you all weary what am I telling you but because that's the place where decisions are made because Satan knows if he can get you to to to doubt the word of God and D doubt your position as a Son of God then you'll lose the power you'll lose the victory gory amen true come on young people get with it tonight come on notice decisions are made that we realize whether you're younger old we all have faced a battle some of you face depression some of us we Face anxiety nervousness I me you can't hardly do anything without just being so nervous and introverted and you just don't want to be around people some of you it's fear find more and more today brother Jason this lust and pornography and passions not just for the men but also for the girls we find that the battle some of us faces unbelief and reasoning and doubts and of that nature or maybe some of your battle is you know you're a cynical person or you're you know always a Critic nothing worse than a Critic right when you try to have a good service AG look at the them young people just jumping and hollering and hooping and everything you know what they ain't got nothing we didn't do that my day well your day was dead it's a different day come on there's a different day come on quit going back to your day and let them have their day the prophet of God said every generation shall have their opportunity at the word of God and that's why you had a camp meeting last week or week before last is so that this generation can have a move of the Holy Spirit they can have their chance at a Revival they can have their chance at the word of God they can walk out of their prison sales and live a life of Victory I say give them an opportunity give them a chance to walk out give them a chance to be free Satan's doing everything he can can to bind them and to keep them and to hold them why can't we give them an opportunity to be free tonight why can't we give them an opportunity to have the the victory in their lives in this hour but no we done got so starchy so formal so powerless well we don't want the word to do what the word says it'll do let me tell you the word may not work in your church but it works in my church it works in this church it'll heal the sick it'll save the Lost it'll grab a young person it'll snatch him from the fire the word still works so give our young people an opportunity for it all right think about some of us we battle some of us we battle suicide let's just be real tonight brother Dennis about five years ago I was we were having our special meetings and I was working at the time and man I was just in that place I'm being a little bit transparent if I'm too much well you just have to forgive me but I I was just in a state of depression and you know and it Satan get you on all kind of things life was good it wasn't bad but you know he just get you in that low Point you're all alone and you're working so much and all this kind of stuff but I drove out of that meeting brother Ron Spencer preached that night he preached on jealousy at the altar I got in my car brother Jason and I pulled out into the main Highway and there was an 18-wheeler coming and a voice said pull right right in front of it see how the enemy loves to work you young people think well that's just me nobody understands me yeah we do we may be old and have no hair but we understand because we may not face your battle but we have our own battle and Satan's trying to destroy us just like he's trying to destroy you that voice said pull out in front of that 18 Willer you will not even be missed and can I tell you for a split second brother Dennis I thought about it then I thought about my wife my children my church those that'll be missed see Satan loves to put that on a Believer cuz we face all of us Face mind battles cuz that's the place where decisions are made but says the mind accepts the life which is in the word of God and there brings that life so your mind now not just the matter of it but not but the mind just hears the word and receives the word like he was telling me reasons and said that's logical and says yes that's true and so your mind accepts it and your mind's controlled by your spirit and he says see just your thoughts don't do that but the word of God brought in the channel of your thought it's not the thought as Christian Science make it out to be mind matter no he said that isn't it but your mind accepts and grasp it what is your mind controlled by your spirit and your spirit catches the word of God and that's the thing that's got life in it and it brings life into you so that's why we preach Faith that's why we preach Faith because Faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of God so faith has to be preached and and brother M will say this he goes it must it must be accepted in the mind then it's believed in the heart then the word of God becomes a reality then every sense of the soul and body is just scoured out with the Holy Ghost then your senses of God your conscience of God everything that's Godly flows through you there's no doubt anywhere there's nothing can rise up and can I tell you he's still the dissolver of doubts he is today as much God as he was yesterday he is still the dissolver of doubts but brother B would tell us now under the United under the the one head he says now if if he can get you to stop just for a minute see Satan wants you to stop remember the story of the girl who stopped just for a minute listening to the music oh he done delivered her brother Dennis from that lifestyle dancing up there and she stopped just for a minute yeah yes because you see there was something inside of her that never got P purely cleaned out she comes so far but not far enough and that's why it's important to not only come so far but to go all the way all the way you know we're not just going and we're going to you know we're leaving Egypt but we're going to leave some of our children behind no we're not leaving a hoof behind let me tell you and when we take a Rapture as a body we're not leaving one of y'all behind we believe it for every last one of us that you're going to be filled with the Holy Ghost that the token life is going to come down and it's going to baptize you with the power and when that time comes for these bodies to be changed oh Hallelujah ain't enough devils in hell can keep these bodies from transforming we will take a step into another dimension we don't believe in a soar religion we're going all the way or we ain't going at all and I'm that kind of guy look I'm all in or I ain't in at all come on brother yeah I'm all look you look if some of y'all brother Dennis you known me for a long time you know how I've been all these years I ain't changed yet come on look when I used to go to the bar now this is this well just give me a few minutes oh let me tell you when I used to go to the bar you know what I did I paid a cover charge y'all don't know what that is you don't need to know what that is I paid to get in okay you got in free tonight but I'd pay you think they gave me free liquor nuh uhuh I PID to get in and I pay to go to the bar for brother get in when I got in there and I started drinking woo man some things begin to loosen up a little bit you know how it you don't know how it is you better not know how it is but I believe we can know how it is in the spiritual realm but I went there and you know let first I sit down in the seat not watch everybody you know just kind of gauging the flow see what everybody's doing you know sipping that yeah you know how it is and all of a sudden man things the Little Foot get tapping oh yeah and that song starts hitting come on y'all had that song ever hit hit uh then I'm all on the Dance Floor cutting a jig doing all kind of crazy stuff they couldn't hold brother Joe back whoop whoop whoop Bam Bam and you telling me I did that out in the world for the devil and I get saved I get filled with the Holy Ghost I come into the presence of a living God and you owe me to sit down you don't want me to shout you don't want me to preach you don't want me to dance you don't want me to rejoice in my God let me tell if I did that for the devil what can I do Under the real anointing under a real spirit of God under a real atmosphere oh Hallelujah tonight it's worth worshiping he's worth rejoicing over he's worth praise it over look I got all in then and I'm all in now sir you didn't know what you was getting did you brother Jason told a little story this morning I'm going to repeat it a little story about the guy you know found a snake at it outside it was frozen so he takes it inside puts it by the fire yeah that snake come alive and bit him he said well I saved you you were frozen he said you knew what you got when you brought me in can I tell you young people the greatest message the greatest decision you'll ever make is to serve the Lord the greatest decision you'll ever make is to make him King of Kings and the Lord of lords I'm not saying your battle's not real but I'm telling you your God is too I didn't come up in a Christian home I didn't come up in a message home I was telling the brothers this morning when when I was a young person when I was a kid my family we come from a split home my parents were divorced 20-some years my brother and sister and I we were put in this with Mom for a little while Dad for a little while when I was about five my dad stole us from my mother me and my brother three months brother Jason for ever got to see my mom again and that was through probate court I watched him do drugs I watched him do alcohol I watched them party I seen people come in and out of the house that's what was normal in my house house sister David when God got a hold of my heart I was 22 years old at the prime of my life I didn't have a dad over there telling me to go give my heart to God I didn't have a mom telling me you need to give your heart to God I didn't have a pastor bringing having a youth service saying come on into the to the youth service no but let me tell you what I did do I began to pray and and I was telling brother Jason in the back something moved on me ever since I was a little boy I don't want to be like this I don't want to live like this what was I I was in a prison that my parents made I was in a prison of doubt I was in a prison of unbelief but I want you to know one time in the presence of a living God a voice came in my car and said turn your car around oh Hallelujah let me tell you I turned around brother and sister and I ain't never been different I ain't never been the same why God got a hold of me and One Moment In His presence he can get a hold of you tonight he can change the of course you're going downall and he can walk you out of that prison he can walk you out of that you may feel well know everybody's watching me look you going to be a fool for somebody be a fool for Christ be a fool for him but see Satan is attack your mind cuz he wants to imprison you with lies he wants to hold you in bondage as a slave come on to keep you bound keep you out of that field working and hoing in the hot sun day after day hour after hour telling you when you can lay down telling you when you can get up telling you when you can eat telling you when you can go to the bathroom telling you when you can do this and do that and do the other but I want you to know you were born free come on I said you were born free it's the enemy that's made you a slave but you don't have to remain a slave Church you don't have to live Bound by the lies of the enemy see he wants to imprison you with doubts and unbelief he wants to make you think you're lost because you make a mistake he wants you to think well there's no hope because you done something you shouldn't you looked at something you shouldn't you said something you shouldn't makes you feel like the Holy Ghost isn't for you come on somebody preach with me now telling you the Holy Ghost ain't for you telling you the message is not for you brother telling you that nobody want you around I know ain't none of y'all ever heard that one now nobody wants you around see that's that's the scheme of the devil oh yes makes you feel like you're not accepted in any group you're not even accepted in your own youth group not accept it in your own family that's Satan see Satan's attack is is what brother B said it's disbelief see God's word disbelief God's word and there's only two forces Satan and God and he said what is Satan's weapon against you is to try to get you to disbelieve your weapon God has given you a weapon it's prayer and prayer is operated by fa faith and faith in the word of God so you can operate prayer in the word of God by faith tonight what am I telling you I'm telling you you don't have to remain where you are you have a choice that you can make tonight as a son and daughter of God as a young person that's hearing the word being preached see the battle grounds your mind and Satan knows that if he can get you to disbelieve the word then what you're going to do is you'll essentially lay your weapon down come on brother you'll lay it down say well maybe that's not for me and then you're two days without reading your Bible you're three days without reading your Bible you're a week without reading your Bible you're a month without reading your Bible oh and then you're six months and every day you go without reading and praying the weaker you get and you lay it down on the prophet of God says never Lay Your Weapon down hold it in your hand day and night not right and day keep that word before you keep his Commandments before you get into the presence of God that's the only way you're going to escape [Applause] leoda amen amen so we find the attack is in the mind this little gray matter that we call the brain and sometimes we want to say that's our minds you know with the Mind man is created Great Inventions Automobiles and airplanes with the Mind man is landed on the moon and Achieve great great things brilliant things by proper use of the mind but just think for a minute if you was just dwelling on bad things evil things dirty things the things that come through your mind that you dwell on and you dwell on well I'm not good enough look at me I'm fat I know you girls y' I mean my goodness look at me how does this make me look don't ever answer that question Gideon say honey yeah don't answer 22 years right here buddy I'm like honey you look good cross your fingers Lord please forgive me for lying no she does look good look I married the best looking one out there guys y'all just take second rate but we get concerned concerned about oh look at me you know when I was a young boy believe it or not I was this size in sixth grade when I get I thought I was going to be the stuff I maxed out now I'm maxed out in height at six in sixth grade but I was 220 PBS at 5' 5 and a half when I was a senior that's what I said my I got picked on for being little roly poly I got called the little Michelin man I got called the little dough boy all those little jokes and what does it do it begins to set a complex in your mind look at me I can't be like them statues over in Paris with the six-pack I mean I'd be happy with one pack but we fine we let things maybe how we look how we look Define who we are spiritually I told the brothers this morning not everybody can be Andrew Glover tall dark and handsome some of us got to be short dumpy and cute so hey now I welcome it I don't mind at all I'm married 22 years four kids I ain't looking for nobody else it don't matter brother Jason we have arrived the days are looking is over wo but I ain't going to let myself go I go to the gym every day I try to run try to eat right try to do the right things because see it ain't so much for my wife it's for me but Satan will use your physicality how you're shaped how you're made maybe your personality maybe some of you a little bit rough around the edges don't nobody raise your hand right now that's not the time to do it Brad we think well why did God make me this way I don't want to be like this God made you that way for a purpose so that you could fulfill his purpose you think I want to preach like this all the time we had a bible study this morning I preach just like this brother J said that was a bible study on steroids cuz it ain't in me sometimes I want to be able to preach like brother Jason Watkins brother Tim puit brother Donnie Reagan all elegant and I mean just so resourceful with all the knowledge I mean man I got to take pictures of all these quotes and put them in my head to have a photographic memory they got it but we find we let little things eat away at us and Satan uses that to imprison you with what we call a complex you're not good enough well who said so you're never going to make it who's got the final say and we let these little things eat away at us and you get and you form a little complex do you know that even brother Bram had a complex brother Bram himself had a complex he lost the feeling for the people and he said do me a favor when you pray pray that God will give me the feeling back for the people that I lost in that complex but see cuz a complex is real it's real but it's not real it's a false reality of a s allow the devil to ENT trap you and imprison you telling you that you're something when that's not what you are or telling you that you're not this and in fact that is what you are so we all have faced complexes and the lies of the enemy and the things that try to come and bombard our minds and I'm going to go just a little bit further and Satan I tell you you know what you're not going to make the Rapture I told my church last week or this past week I said you know when I was a kid I did not like to hear the word rapture it scared me to death but I didn't sit in a church like you sit in I didn't know the realities and the reward that the Rapture is to me the Rapture was Armageddon it was like a big big war and they going to cut your head off because you got to accept the name of Christ and if you don't then they gonna cut your head off and I mean I had it all messed up Baptist Church don't teach you very good let me just put it out there but we find now Satan would tell you that you you can't receive the Holy Ghost cuz if you would you would have just got it in the camp you just come out of look at you you came back the same way you went same desire same nature same attitude same Rebellion Mom and Daddy asked you to do something your body didn't know you can do all them gations did it you just get asked a question all I ask you to do was going make your bed you about made your grave with all that twisting and jumping and everything you just did and you think that's cute huh it's not cute because Rebellion is as a sin of Witchcraft Rebellion is not cool I don't care what age you are whether you're a grownup or not well we find Satan will use these things and he use these things against you cuz he knows how you're natured brother Dennis he knows that you're very Meek very quiet but I seen brother Dennis we was preaching together at a meeting there in Ohio one time out in a in a park and I preach like I'm preaching right now Dennis you know he just come he's all dignified got to get it all right y'all know I don't know if you ever heard Dennis preach he's can we turn to the scriptures bam and that joker just unloads a whole another man I'm like who died and took him over I'm like I didn't know that man could preach like that like a power house but you look at him think man no and sometimes that's how we look at each other they look at your outward appearance you know what you ain't so pretty I ain't going to like you cuz you ugly that's kind of how we are AR we come on you know how it is in grade school you poor you stay with the poor folks if you was rich you had rich friends if you was middle class you had middle class friends if you were poor you had grimy friends and sometimes that's how we treat each other in church we're Sons and Daughters of God and Satan will get into that because how somebody's natured I understand you're not gonna be buddies with everybody in your church but you can at least be friendly you can at least say Hey brother sister how you doing but Satan will form that little complex and you you ignore that sister long enough then here's a little complex sets down on her I guess I'm ugly I guess I'm not good enough and then Satan slams the door of that prison and now depression sets in and now the thoughts of suicide begin to dwell in her mind all because of maybe she's not fitting in or he's not fitting into the crowd because well we're short or we got a deformity or we're just not pretty or we're tall or fat whatever you want to put it there or maybe you're so natured that way see Satan uses these little things to imprison you in a Cell of his own making can I go just a little bit further and we find that we have this constant bombardment how many Of You' have been bombarded today all right some of you older people you young people I don't know where in the world y'all playing at but us older folks we on the battlefield for my Lord woo get on the battlefield Young Folks Mercy but he comes and he bombards your mind and you walk around with no joy you mean to tell me we got the greatest message that ever hit the face of the Earth but yet Satan knows if I can get them under bondage if I can bombard their mind over and over and get them to reason and get them to doubt and get them to unbelief and get them to look at physical situations get them to look at Natural Things versus the word of God then he'll keep you bound and you'll have no joy no peace your faith begins to Wain and you become a prisoner that's Frederick Douglas many of you may know Frederick Douglas if if you hav't you need to go look at your American history book but frr Douglas was a abolitionist and he made a comment he said if you want to make a slave a contented slave then you let him know there's nothing wrong with slavery let him know there's nothing wrong don't let him know there's anything else but slavery Harriet Tubman y'all familiar with Harriet Tubman here in South Carolina give you a history lesson if you don't Harriet Tubman she she had that the uh Underground Railroad right she was funling slaves out out out and she made a comment brother Andrew she said I would have I would have freed she because I freed a lot of slaves and I would have freed a lot more if they would have only knew they were slaves if they would have only knew that they were slaves because only then do you realize you need to be set free that's good brother and young person what am I telling you tonight is you're in a prison some of you are in a prison of depression some of you are in a prison of anxiety and nervousness and and introvert and or maybe extrovert whatever it may be you're in a complex you're in a prison of your own making fear and and worry and guilt and a shame and lust and passion and everything but I can tell you tonight you can be free if you realize that you're a slave tonight cuz God has no intentions of leaving you the way he found you God has no intentions of you walking out of this service the same way you walked in maybe you're here tonight and you are in prison and you are battling an issue and it may not look it may not be drugs and alcohol and and pornography and and things of that nature but maybe it's just little things that you're harboring to yourself nobody knows cuz you kept it but the holy spirit is here I can tell you CU this message has gone different ways completely different than I expected it to go because I can see him starting to just move and starting to search and starting to pick starting to cut dealing with depression there's never been another age to face depression like the age in which we're living in millions and millions and millions of people brother Dennis are anti-depressants but tonight you have the greatest anti-depressant there ever was it's the Holy Ghost it's the gospel it can do more for you than any shrink any psychiatrist any peill that you'll ever take in your life you don't have to keep revisiting the doctor when you come to drct Jesus he'll cut that thing right out of your life and set you free that's the truth we find some of us we have no motivation to keep pressing in the battle then eventually you just give in you cave how many you had friends sitting right here amongst you cave and now they're no longer sitting in the house of God maybe got their hair growed out and you know got three or four girlfriends or boyfriends or you know they got uh knocked up excuse the language a excuse me but they got pregnated by some other boy and this that and other before they got married and all that all that has happened because people got weary and well doing so let me just go just further and we we're going to start bringing this down here I want to start turning a corner see Satan will press into your minds with a purpose to destroy you yes sir he will press you he will attack you with the purpose to destroy you and the Bible says in John 10:10 the thief cometh not but for the steal to kill and destroy but I come that you might have life and that you might have life more abundantly so Satan wants to destroy your fellowship with Believers he wants to destroy your self-esteem he wants to destroy your relationship with God your relationship with your friends your relationship with your family he wants to divide the siblings he wants to destroy your faith in God's word he wants to destroy the faith and confidence that you have in a Ministry and brother Brown would tell us he says you don't have to stick a life in a man's back to break his character to kill him you go talking about his characters and some of us we've seen it over the dinner table you hear the stories and you wonder you know Mom and Dad saying these things and then you can't help their kids I can't help their kids no preacher can help their kids and then you find their kids drifting and they become a prisoner to the world but we all have faced that and seen those things and those battles and those complexes every one of us get some Psalms 139 vers 14 says I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made when I found that scripture that little 5 foot five and a half 220 PB fat kid called roly poly little Pillsbury Doughboy I don't worry about my weight today look when I lost my hair brother Dennis I look good I'm thinking man I should have done this a long time ago how many of y'all know Jason STM shame on y'all I was in a I was in a a tire shop in Tucson Arizona last year these couple walked he's like are you I'm like no wish I was man you look just like him last year we were going somewhere and I was walking out of a Walmart and this this this color fella was pushing a bug he's like ho are you I'm like no no no no I'm like man I wish I was but he's about 6 foot2 I'm about 5 foot5 I mean there's a big discrepancy but what I'm saying is because I Found a Love from God that I don't worry about how I am yeah I don't care about what size I am whether I'm tall whether I'm short look you start appreciating your shortness when you get on a plane amen yeah buddy you appreciate your smallness when you get on a plane sitting next to a big guy on a plane hey tubby give me my armrest back I'll tell y'all some stories later about that maybe tomorrow when we're done preaching I was on a plane I'm going to tell you now I got to tell you I was on a plane and we were going to macius me and my wife and one of my daughters brother Jason oh my goodness they had four they got the middle row it's big plain middle row I let the girls have it I'm like okay if it's a man then I'll sit by the man if it's a woman you get to sit by the woman I always like to sit on the ow well I didn't get that lucky the man was on the AIS and he was kind of an Indian fella big fella that dude hugged that armrest for eight hours I mean he was clamped down on it I'm like man would he just move his arm over well about eight hours into a 12 hour flight he finally got up to go to the bathroom let me tell you I command deared that hor armrest he come back I'm like I ain't moving an inch I have sat here for 7 hours in torment I wanted that armrest you didn't give it to me I stay like that for seven hours and no buddy these next four are mine and that's what we got to be with the Enemy he's kept it from you from so long he's trying to keep you suppressed for so long he's trying to keep you beat down for so long but if he gives up one inch you take possession of what belongs to you tonight hey this is mine I'm coming into the devil's house and I'm taking everything back that he stole from me you can't have my joy you can't have my peace you can't have my mind you can't have my spirit you can't have nothing I belong to God and I'm taking it back tonight I'm taking back everything that the devil stole from me I'm taking it back tonight I refused to walk out of here the same now let's bring this down musicians won't you to make your way back if you would let me share what brother Bram says here in God's provided way he said it doesn't make a difference what your past has been some of you have been so tormented by your past and your mistakes your failures failed to attempts I tried I've been to the altar seems like I keep coming back to the altar keep coming something is pulling you to that altar keep coming because one day it's going to stick he said it doesn't matter listen he says it don't make a difference what your past life has been when you got an invitation to come you're ready to come if you've been bad if you've been a street walker if you've been a gambler if you've been a drunkard if you if you've been a murderer no matter what you've been if God gives you an invitation knocking at your heart he will take care of the rest yes sir now I'm speaking to you on walk out and we go back to Peter here see the king he apprehended Peter because he saw the joy in the people's eyes when he killed James so he said I'm going to kill another one and maybe that's what he's done he maybe he's killed some of of your friends spiritually and they're not walking with the Lord anymore and he's determined to take you and to throw you into a prison a prison now back in that day was was designed to psych psychologically and physically torture The Prisoner prisons was also designed to strip the prisoner of every ounce of dignity to humiliate you to embarrass you and the Bible says in Acts 12 and verse 10 and when Herod would have brought him forth the same night Peter was sleeping Between Two Soldiers there was 16 men that was commissioned to watch over him and make sure he didn't Escape so he sleeping this man had so much peace with God brother Jason that knowing that tomorrow he's going to give his life if it's required that he just fell asleep I want to be a Peter so I don't worry about what tomorrow holds I got peace in my God and he fell asleep chained to two prisoners prison guard excuse me and we find here says Peter was sleeping Between Two Soldiers bound with chains and the keepers before the door kept a prison and behold the the angel of the Lord came upon him and a light shined into the prison and he smoked Peter on the side and he raised him up saying arise up quickly and his chains fell off of his hands and the angel said unto him guard thyself and bind on thy sandals otherwise say it's time to walk you can't stay here you can't stay here a light an Ang Angel of the Lord came into his prison cell historians that say that Peter's left arm was chained to the right arm of a guard and his right arm was chained to the left arm of another guard but when the angel of the Lord comes in your room can I tell you a young person when the angel of the Lord comes by your way I don't care what you've been chained to what kind of drug you've been chained to what kind of pornography you been chained to what kind of past life you've been chained to it doesn't matter to God cuz when he sends the angel of the lord your way chains begin to fall off those chains that held you you wonder will I ever escape will I ever be free as a young man brother Dennis for 20-some years all I wanted to do was serve God I didn't know how to do it I didn't know how to serve God I didn't know how to find God I didn't really know how to pray to God but something B on my heart day after day after day and go to the bar and I'd go to a party and I'd do this and I do that but something in my heart longed to serve God but one night one night that same angel I believe that visited Peter visited me in my car and the change brother Jason of my life chains of of of pornography and chains of of alcohol and and chains of our ungodly Life Begin to Fall Off and I went home and I knelt beside my bed and I walked out I walked out I said God if you don't do something tonight if you don't change me tonight I don't know how to pray I don't even know how to talk to you but I know one thing if you don't change me tonight I'll be a dead man by a week cuz I tried to commit suicide that night an angel came to bethl Tabernacle tonight an angel may be in a funny form may be a way that you didn't expect but an angel a messenger not from Louisiana but from Heaven say you can walk out some of you bow your heads if you would maybe you're here tonight and you've been B battling and battling and wonder will I ever get free or I ever make it will I always have to live like this can
