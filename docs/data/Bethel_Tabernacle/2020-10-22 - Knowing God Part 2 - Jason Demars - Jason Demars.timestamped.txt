[34:48] [Music]
[34:50] lord we pray that it would just
[34:53] even now just soak into our hearts
[34:58] there is no one that loves
[35:00] us like you do our human love goes up
[35:03] goes down
[35:04] gets weaker it gets stronger we go
[35:07] through
[35:08] hills and
[35:09] valleys and emotions and
[35:12] we fail lord but your love never fails
[35:16] your love
[35:18] lord is

[35:23] your love is what can
[35:26] grow us
[35:27] [Music]
[35:29] your love is what keeps us lord
[35:32] we just want to commit ourselves commit
[35:34] this time to your lord we ask that your
[35:35] holy spirit would
[35:37] just take control
[35:40] just wanted to give you all
[35:42] and as i'm giving this announcement if
[35:44] musicians want to just sneak out now to
[35:46] your spot we'll get to the scriptures
[35:48] just in a few minutes
[35:50] um
[35:52] i was planning on going on a missions
[35:54] trip moving forward by faith i i had
[35:57] booked my ticket for november 2nd and
[36:00] things on the other end in turkey
[36:03] we just kept getting blocked
[36:07] from from the ministers not being able
[36:10] to
[36:11] get any kind of travel permission inside
[36:14] of the country
[36:16] and translator not being able to go
[36:19] get a travel permission to go even
[36:21] outside of the city i shouldn't say the
[36:22] country they can't even leave their city
[36:25] there
[36:26] and go from city to city so
[36:28] as that as it became apparent that
[36:32] we weren't going to be able to have a
[36:34] translator or have the people come to
[36:36] meet us at a central place
[36:38] just felt like well the lord's in
[36:40] control
[36:41] he knows what he's doing
[36:43] and we're not going to run through a
[36:45] closed door
[36:46] that's painful
[36:48] well i made that statement to my family
[36:50] and my daughter avery said that sounds
[36:53] kind of painful and you're you're right
[36:55] avery in a lot of different ways it's
[36:56] painful
[36:58] spiritually speaking it can be very
[36:59] painful and and when the lord closes the
[37:02] door he has a lot of things in mind
[37:04] the situation in turkey is changing
[37:07] persecution is rising there's a turkish
[37:09] pastor in the city that we're visiting
[37:11] that's in prison
[37:13] multiple minister iranian ministers have
[37:15] been deported back to iran so
[37:19] i i don't know the lord's in control and
[37:21] i'm not afraid
[37:22] i just want to be
[37:24] where he wants me to be
[37:26] and so we'll see what happens over the
[37:28] next few months just keep those
[37:29] believers
[37:30] in prayer
[37:32] in particular brother shaheen and
[37:34] brother omed as they're doing their best
[37:36] to minister to the flock over there
[37:39] also just wanted i already announced to
[37:41] the families but in case anybody's
[37:44] listening online or just didn't didn't
[37:46] get the update this friday uh evening at
[37:49] my house we'll have the junior youth
[37:51] bible study that will start at 6 30
[37:56] pm and go until 9
[37:59] and
[38:00] the ages are 8 to 12.
[38:03] so everyone's welcome
[38:05] to to come in that ain't raid age range
[38:07] and parents are welcome to drop their
[38:10] drop the young ends off or
[38:12] uh you can stay as well if you want to
[38:15] all right with that said let's go to the
[38:18] scriptures let's stand up and read
[38:20] jeremiah
[38:22] chapter 9
[38:23] and we're going to read verse 23 and 24.
[38:31] thus saith the lord
[38:33] let not the wise man glory in his wisdom
[38:37] neither let the mighty man
[38:39] glory
[38:40] in his might
[38:42] let not the rich man glory in his riches
[38:46] verse 24 but let him that glorious glory
[38:50] in this
[38:51] that he understandeth and knoweth me
[38:54] that i am the lord which exercised
[38:56] lovingkindness judgment and
[38:58] righteousness in the earth for in these
[39:00] things
[39:01] i delight
[39:03] saith the lord
[39:05] amen may the lord add the blessing to
[39:07] the reading of his word he can be seated
[39:14] so we're continuing our subject knowing
[39:16] god this is part two
[39:18] and i'm going to
[39:20] be going into
[39:22] uh the attributes of god as i spoke
[39:24] about previously
[39:27] and there's
[39:29] there's a long
[39:31] long list
[39:32] and the list that i have is just a
[39:33] starting list really of the attributes
[39:36] of god
[39:37] and you know it isn't it isn't
[39:39] necessarily about
[39:40] knowing memorizing a list it isn't about
[39:44] we talked about last time knowing facts
[39:47] about god
[39:49] uh it's about knowing god
[39:51] there's a great difference it isn't you
[39:53] know brother branham
[39:54] made this comment multiple times that
[39:57] it wasn't
[39:58] people would say well you just don't
[39:59] know your bible
[40:01] and he would respond
[40:04] well i may not know my bible well but
[40:07] i know the author real well
[40:09] and of course he's not encouraging
[40:11] uh biblical illiteracy and he wasn't
[40:14] himself
[40:15] biblically illiterate he was
[40:18] extremely
[40:19] well versed in the bible and he studied
[40:22] it and studied history and and he
[40:24] studied theology on his own and
[40:27] you know he went through many many many
[40:29] different books and he knew it very well
[40:32] but the point is well taken in that
[40:36] it's not about knowing facts about the
[40:37] bible
[40:39] it's about knowing the author
[40:42] knowing him personally knowing him by
[40:44] experience knowing him by
[40:47] spiritual revelation
[40:50] you know the natural man receives not
[40:52] the things of the spirit of god for
[40:54] their spiritually
[40:56] discerned
[40:57] and it's only as god reveals it to you
[41:01] will you know something that's any
[41:03] that's worth
[41:04] knowing we talked about that before you
[41:07] can know so many facts
[41:09] even the bible says you can know all
[41:11] mysteries
[41:13] and still not be in the place god wants
[41:15] you to be
[41:16] you know without love you're nothing
[41:18] know all mysteries without love you're
[41:19] nothing
[41:21] and
[41:22] that's important as we study
[41:25] the word of god we have to start from
[41:27] that place
[41:29] also what is your motive
[41:32] what is your motive for studying
[41:35] is it to
[41:36] have a lot of knowledge and be able to
[41:38] answer a lot of questions
[41:40] is it to be able to be uh give an answer
[41:43] to every person that comes to you and
[41:45] and be able to well scripture says we
[41:47] should have an answer for the hope that
[41:49] lies within us
[41:51] but that shouldn't be our only purpose
[41:55] to be able to win an argument
[41:57] no
[41:59] our motive and our heart should be
[42:01] knowing him when we open this book
[42:04] our purpose should be
[42:06] not knowing about him knowing him thank
[42:08] you brother
[42:10] our purpose when we pray
[42:13] shouldn't be to get things it's to be to
[42:15] realize the presence of god
[42:19] we have to be seeking him
[42:22] in his word for the right reasons if we
[42:25] don't do it for the right reasons if we
[42:26] do it for the wrong motive
[42:29] in our heart
[42:30] what is it what did we talk about you
[42:32] become hard
[42:33] you become hardened you become proud
[42:36] and you look down
[42:38] on other people
[42:40] because why aren't they seeking
[42:41] knowledge the way i am
[42:43] why don't they why aren't they studying
[42:45] the way i study why aren't they doing
[42:47] see the motives wrong
[42:49] the objective is wrong and it when the
[42:52] motive is wrong it results it results in
[42:55] the wrong
[42:56] fruit
[42:58] i mean we can go down through history
[43:01] of
[43:02] the message
[43:03] movement and we can talk about people
[43:06] that preach thousands of sermons over a
[43:08] long many many years of time
[43:11] and you could go down and say man
[43:13] what a wonderful preacher and realize
[43:16] they walked away from
[43:18] everything
[43:19] and they're turning around and spitting
[43:21] on it
[43:22] so what is is it about knowledge
[43:25] is about knowing about the message facts
[43:28] about the mysteries and we can go on
[43:30] down the line and bring everything in
[43:31] perfect balance
[43:34] no
[43:34] it's not that's not what it's about
[43:38] it's not about knowing facts
[43:40] that that you know the bible says the
[43:42] letter
[43:43] killeth but the spirit
[43:45] giveth
[43:47] life
[43:48] doesn't mean we throw the letter away it
[43:50] means that the spirit comes into us
[43:53] and lets us know about this letter
[43:56] but without that spirit and studying the
[43:58] letter it kills
[44:00] so first it takes the spirit the right
[44:02] motive the right heart as we approach
[44:05] knowing
[44:06] the lord not about knowing about facts
[44:09] about it's knowing
[44:11] him
[44:12] personally
[44:16] all right
[44:18] isaiah chapter 6
[44:20] and i just wanna
[44:23] as i was studying this and putting down
[44:25] the notes for the
[44:27] for the first time
[44:29] several months ago
[44:32] and i was approaching to preach it for
[44:35] the first time i
[44:37] i woke up so early in the morning on a
[44:39] sunday morning and i just had this
[44:43] this
[44:44] this
[44:45] powerful
[44:47] sense of awe that came over me
[44:49] and the the sense that
[44:52] who am i
[44:53] yeah to stand up
[44:55] and speak about this subject i can't i
[44:58] can't even open my mouth
[45:00] to speak
[45:02] about god the greatness
[45:05] his glory
[45:07] his majesty
[45:09] how can i stand up and
[45:11] try to say something coherent
[45:16] about him amen and it was just this
[45:21] i entered into the spirit that
[45:23] isaiah entered into
[45:25] and what if what what a sense of
[45:29] awesome dread
[45:31] that i felt
[45:32] and
[45:33] as i approached that subject and and i
[45:36] feel it again as i approach the
[45:37] scripture
[45:39] in the year that king uzziah died
[45:42] i saw also the lord sitting upon a
[45:45] throne this is significant
[45:47] king uzziah
[45:48] started out as a tremendous king
[45:53] and he was hailed and lauded as a great
[45:55] hero
[45:56] of judah amen and in jerusalem
[45:59] and
[46:00] king uzziah failed miserably because of
[46:03] pride right
[46:05] and he died
[46:06] and his
[46:08] his work
[46:10] what he did ended
[46:12] there so it's significant
[46:16] it's not for for no reason that it's
[46:18] spoken in the year king uzziah died
[46:21] i saw also the lord sitting upon the
[46:24] throne
[46:25] the human ruler dies and goes and lays
[46:29] and rots
[46:31] in the tomb but there's one who's
[46:33] sitting on the throne he's supreme it
[46:35] does this isn't jehovah sitting upon the
[46:37] throne this is the word for the supreme
[46:40] ruler
[46:42] the he's he's the true
[46:45] supreme king
[46:47] of judah
[46:49] and of all the earth
[46:50] he is still sitting upon the throne
[46:52] uzziah's dying in a tomb
[46:55] the year that a king dies is a year of
[46:57] mourning as i understand it they don't
[46:59] even hold the coronation for the next
[47:01] king and the celebration until that year
[47:03] of mourning
[47:05] is completed
[47:06] so here we have this year of mourning
[47:09] isaiah isaiah was a relative of the
[47:11] royal family if you're not aware of that
[47:13] he was a connected person he was part of
[47:16] the aristocracy so to speak
[47:19] it didn't get him that far because he
[47:21] was sawed in half
[47:24] but he still was a connected person
[47:26] so that he could walk into the palace
[47:29] amen
[47:31] he was not prevented or hindered at all
[47:33] because he was a part of that family the
[47:35] royal family
[47:37] and so
[47:39] isaiah
[47:40] saw the lord sitting upon the throne the
[47:42] one that doesn't change the one that
[47:44] doesn't alter
[47:45] and that throne was high and lifted up
[47:48] and the train of his garment just the
[47:50] train of his garment filled the temple
[47:53] let alone his very being
[47:55] just the train of his garment filled up
[47:56] the temple next verse
[47:59] above it stood the seraphims
[48:02] each one had six wings
[48:04] with two he covered his face and with
[48:06] two he covered his feet
[48:08] and with two he did fly these two
[48:11] these seraphim
[48:15] never sinned
[48:17] even once
[48:19] they were
[48:21] perfectly sinless
[48:24] and yet in the presence of
[48:27] this great
[48:28] king
[48:30] they had to cover their feet
[48:34] and they had to cover their face
[48:36] think about that for a second sinless
[48:38] creatures
[48:40] made
[48:41] to be in the presence of god
[48:44] because of
[48:45] the holiness of god they had to cover
[48:47] themselves
[48:49] so even perfect sinlessness
[48:52] is nothing
[48:53] nothing in comparison
[48:56] with the almighty amen next verse
[48:59] and one cried to another and said
[49:01] holy holy holy is the lord of hosts
[49:05] the whole earth is full of his glory
[49:08] let's go back to that scripture
[49:12] holy holy holy why does he say it three
[49:15] times
[49:17] if you're familiar remember jesus would
[49:20] say verily verily or in aramaic he would
[49:23] have been saying
[49:24] amen amen
[49:26] what is he saying he's putting an
[49:29] emphasis upon this
[49:31] it's a hebrew way of speaking
[49:34] it's like an exclamation point verbally
[49:36] giving an explanation point
[49:38] amen amen i say unto you
[49:41] here they only they don't do it two
[49:43] times
[49:45] they add a third time
[49:47] and no it's not for the trinity
[49:51] holy holy holy what is it saying
[49:55] this
[49:56] god
[49:57] is different
[49:58] than you
[50:00] he's different than you he's different
[50:02] than you
[50:04] what does that mean it's speaking of
[50:06] infinite
[50:07] infinite holiness
[50:10] amen is the lord of hosts
[50:14] the whole earth is full of his glory so
[50:15] his train fills the temple
[50:18] and his glory fills the whole earth
[50:21] next verse
[50:23] and the post of the doors moved at the
[50:25] voice of him that cried and the house
[50:28] was filled with smoke
[50:31] so just the cherubim spoke
[50:34] and the posts and the place shook like
[50:36] there was an earthquake
[50:38] incredible
[50:39] and yet they're nothing in comparison
[50:41] with the one who sits on the throne
[50:44] the next verse
[50:48] this is
[50:49] such a startling thing that isaiah says
[50:52] here then said i woe is me for i am
[50:55] undone
[50:58] that word woe is a is
[51:01] it's literally in the hebrew oy
[51:04] if you know in the yiddish language they
[51:06] say oy vey what is he saying it's a
[51:09] passionate cry of despair amen
[51:14] he is literally
[51:15] screaming out in despair whoa is me
[51:18] this isn't just close me
[51:21] he's crying out
[51:23] in this the presence of this vision
[51:26] i'm i'm
[51:27] i'm in i'm in despair
[51:31] for i am undone
[51:33] the word undone is speaking of destroy
[51:37] to be destroyed
[51:38] to perish
[51:40] to cause to cease
[51:42] another way of saying is to
[51:44] everything has crumbled to pieces
[51:48] you hear the statement that a person
[51:51] they've they've got it all together
[51:53] right
[51:54] here in isaiah in as he sees this vision
[51:57] he says
[51:58] i don't have it all together
[52:01] i am i've seen
[52:03] the lord of hosts and i am i am
[52:05] disintegrated
[52:08] the word means just to come to cease to
[52:10] perish i've literally disintegrated
[52:14] i'm destroyed
[52:16] i'm in despair just coming into the
[52:19] presence
[52:20] of almighty god
[52:23] have we met this god have you met this
[52:25] god
[52:28] have you come
[52:29] come to know him
[52:32] this is not a pentecostal baby
[52:36] doctrine
[52:37] this is not a pentecostal baby
[52:40] verse this is a reality that brother
[52:42] branham
[52:44] experienced he said i when the angel of
[52:46] the lord would come to me
[52:48] i felt like a hunted animal
[52:52] talk about being undone talk about being
[52:56] in a place where you feel
[52:58] only despair
[53:01] what does a haunted animal feel like
[53:04] despair
[53:09] what is it
[53:10] for us
[53:14] as godly as we might be to come in the
[53:16] presence of god
[53:18] we should experience that
[53:20] aw and reverence of him
[53:23] it's not just something yes his presence
[53:26] makes us happy and shout but sometimes
[53:29] his make us his presence makes us
[53:31] fearful
[53:33] in awe
[53:35] wanting to just say
[53:37] i'm in despair
[53:40] and then notice what he says next this
[53:42] is the prophet of god
[53:45] this is the holiest man in all of israel
[53:49] this is god's mouthpiece this is the man
[53:52] that god has veiled
[53:54] behind
[53:56] and this is what he said i am a man
[53:59] of unclean lips
[54:01] this is three things that he goes into
[54:06] i'm in despair
[54:08] my existence is literally crumbled to
[54:11] pieces
[54:12] and my lips are not clean
[54:15] my mouth
[54:17] is dirty
[54:19] what i speak what i say in comparison to
[54:21] the presence of this august being oh yes
[54:25] is filth
[54:28] recognize
[54:30] recognize
[54:32] what your problem is
[54:34] what our problems are
[54:36] too many times
[54:38] in american christianity and in many of
[54:40] our
[54:41] worship songs
[54:43] the real problem that people has it have
[54:45] are
[54:46] they feel bad
[54:48] they're a little sad
[54:49] they have a couple life problems
[54:53] and god can solve them for him
[54:56] that's fantastic but that has nothing to
[54:58] do with salvation
[55:00] you are a lost and dead
[55:03] sinner you're dead in your sins
[55:06] there's nothing you can do to please god
[55:09] and you're standing here like god owes
[55:11] you something
[55:12] god does not
[55:14] owe you
[55:15] anything
[55:19] and you cannot give god anything that he
[55:22] wants
[55:23] see the position you're in
[55:25] you're dead and you're without
[55:28] hope according to scripture
[55:31] but god who is rich in mercy provided a
[55:34] sacrifice
[55:36] to stand in your place
[55:38] he did it
[55:39] and he calls you
[55:41] and he his kindness leads you to
[55:43] repentance
[55:47] god is not here
[55:49] to make your life easy
[55:52] god is here to save your soul
[55:56] and change your life
[55:58] to fill you with his spirit to transform
[56:00] you but i i would say that most
[56:03] christians have not had this experience
[56:06] where they've come to the place where
[56:07] said woe is me for i am undone
[56:10] i have unclean lips and i'm amongst the
[56:12] people of unclean lips no they just want
[56:15] to feel good about themselves they're
[56:17] dead
[56:18] and you're dead
[56:20] unless you have experienced this
[56:22] i'm a sinner
[56:24] and i'm i have nothing i can offer god
[56:28] only only by his grace
[56:31] only by the blood of christ
[56:33] only by the transforming power
[56:36] of the baptism of the holy ghost can i
[56:39] experience salvation
[56:42] and we'll experience troubles and god
[56:44] will help us and god will deliver us
[56:46] and god will do many things for us but
[56:48] god is more
[56:50] interested
[56:52] in the problem of sin
[56:54] than he is in the problem of your
[56:56] discomfort
[56:59] god will give
[57:01] discomfort to his children
[57:04] to his seed in order to produce
[57:07] godliness
[57:09] in order to produce a reflection of
[57:11] himself
[57:12] brother branham his first experience of
[57:15] god scared him
[57:20] here
[57:21] isaiah experienced god i would say
[57:25] very frightened
[57:27] he's extremely scared
[57:30] and god didn't say oh here honey
[57:32] it's okay no he said okay you recognize
[57:35] the reality
[57:38] you are undone you do have unclean lips
[57:41] and you're around the people
[57:43] that have unclean lips
[57:45] and you should respond this way when you
[57:47] come into the presence of the king
[57:49] the lord of hosts next
[57:52] verse but that wasn't the end of the
[57:55] story god's grace
[57:57] comes forth
[58:00] now notice isaiah didn't even ask
[58:03] this was just sovereign grace of god
[58:06] then flew one of the seraphims unde unto
[58:09] me having a live coal in his hand which
[58:11] he had taken with the tongs off the
[58:13] altar isaiah just recognized the reality
[58:16] and he spoke the reality
[58:18] of what he was experiencing right there
[58:20] and god said
[58:22] you're right and here's a solution
[58:25] he took the tongue from the altar put it
[58:26] upon his lips
[58:28] painful
[58:30] very painful
[58:31] your iniquity is taken away and your sin
[58:35] is
[58:36] purged next verse
[58:38] amen
[58:40] verse 8
[58:43] also i heard the voice of the lord
[58:45] saying whom shall i send and who will go
[58:47] for us
[58:48] then said i here am i
[58:51] send me
[58:55] he recognized
[58:56] his problem
[58:58] god brought a solution
[59:00] and god said
[59:01] who will go for us
[59:03] and it didn't it didn't hinder him
[59:06] knowing
[59:08] himself knowing
[59:10] where he came from
[59:11] knowing what he was it didn't hinder
[59:14] isaiah saying here i am send me because
[59:17] why he realized the one who was sending
[59:20] would be
[59:21] with him
[59:22] would be in him and would speak through
[59:25] him
[59:25] would empower him to do it isaiah knew
[59:28] that
[59:29] and what a glorious thing you know god
[59:32] isn't here to make us wallow
[59:36] in our problems
[59:37] our sins
[59:38] our mistakes he offers a solution
[59:42] we receive it by faith and then we can
[59:45] walk forward
[59:46] with confidence
[59:49] we don't have to say oh
[59:51] i can't i can't do it well
[59:54] didn't moses say that to the lord
[59:56] and the lord was what
[1:00:00] he was angry
[1:00:02] with moses for saying i i i'm not good
[1:00:04] at speaking
[1:00:05] moses misunderstood
[1:00:08] it's not you doing the work moses
[1:00:12] god was doing the work god was doing the
[1:00:14] speaking god was veiled
[1:00:16] is veiled behind his prophets amen
[1:00:20] and he's not ashamed to veil himself
[1:00:21] behind his prophets even knowing their
[1:00:24] condition
[1:00:28] so
[1:00:30] as we look
[1:00:32] at who this great and holy god i think
[1:00:36] i think it's just good for all of us
[1:00:38] not just
[1:00:40] through hearing preaching but
[1:00:42] uh
[1:00:43] very frequently to think
[1:00:45] and meditate
[1:00:47] on
[1:00:48] the majestic glory and the awesome
[1:00:51] grandeur
[1:00:52] of
[1:00:54] the god that we
[1:00:55] serve
[1:00:58] you know his
[1:01:01] his splendor his greatness should
[1:01:03] provoke us to worship
[1:01:07] and and
[1:01:08] too often we think about ourselves and
[1:01:10] our own needs
[1:01:12] when we pray
[1:01:13] i think let's let's
[1:01:15] flip that around a little bit and let's
[1:01:17] think about how
[1:01:19] great how amazing
[1:01:21] how powerful how glorious god is and
[1:01:24] don't just think about it and make it up
[1:01:25] from your own mind
[1:01:27] i mean there's literally hundreds of
[1:01:28] scriptures
[1:01:30] you can go through to feed your soul
[1:01:33] on the greatness
[1:01:35] of god
[1:01:37] and i want to start going through
[1:01:39] uh i have about 16 different
[1:01:42] attributes of god it'll take me um
[1:01:46] multiple sermons to go through
[1:01:48] that but we'll just get started
[1:01:50] and get as far as we can
[1:01:53] the first
[1:01:54] attribute of god i want to look at is
[1:01:56] the
[1:01:57] aloneness or the uniqueness
[1:02:00] of god
[1:02:03] genesis 1
[1:02:05] 1 starts and says
[1:02:08] in the beginning
[1:02:09] god
[1:02:11] in the beginning god
[1:02:13] so any turn
[1:02:14] before the beginning
[1:02:16] was obviously eternity
[1:02:19] in eternity god dwelt alone
[1:02:22] in fact that's just the word that we use
[1:02:24] today to describe
[1:02:26] him he wasn't even god yet because in
[1:02:28] english the word god means a
[1:02:31] an object of worship there was nowhere
[1:02:34] no one yet there
[1:02:36] to worship him he was just the eternal
[1:02:37] one
[1:02:39] this word here is in the beginning
[1:02:42] elohim
[1:02:44] it's an interesting word because if you
[1:02:46] if you break that word down el
[1:02:48] means strong one
[1:02:51] and ohim in hebrew means to swear
[1:02:55] or bind
[1:02:56] by an oath
[1:03:00] so in the beginning elohim
[1:03:03] he was already
[1:03:05] the strong one bound by an oath
[1:03:09] he's the first one to appear in the
[1:03:10] bible
[1:03:14] the fact is
[1:03:15] he was he was already there
[1:03:18] with the god of
[1:03:20] his promises the god of his
[1:03:22] grace the god of his mercy all the plan
[1:03:26] had already been set forth
[1:03:28] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[1:03:30] of the world your name was written on
[1:03:31] the book
[1:03:33] before the foundation of the world
[1:03:39] exodus 15
[1:03:41] verse
[1:03:42] 11.
[1:03:47] who is like unto thee o lord among the
[1:03:49] gods
[1:03:50] who is like the glorious in holiness
[1:03:53] fearful in praises
[1:03:56] doing wonders
[1:04:00] those are
[1:04:01] those are some incredible words that are
[1:04:02] put together glorious
[1:04:05] in holiness fearful
[1:04:07] in praises
[1:04:11] ah provoking praises
[1:04:15] we should have that in our life we
[1:04:17] should experience that in our lives
[1:04:19] shouldn't be just singing a worship song
[1:04:21] and i feel good
[1:04:22] there should be some sense of ah that
[1:04:26] you have
[1:04:27] about the greatness of god amen
[1:04:32] sometimes and unfortunately
[1:04:34] it's our
[1:04:35] it's our nature
[1:04:38] is that we begin to think about god and
[1:04:40] we attribute to god
[1:04:43] attributes that are after our own
[1:04:46] human
[1:04:47] way of thinking
[1:04:49] and that's why we need scripture
[1:04:53] scripture corrects us this message
[1:04:55] corrects us
[1:04:57] to not
[1:04:58] not turn god into an idol
[1:05:01] that's after our own way
[1:05:03] of looking
[1:05:04] our own
[1:05:05] way of thinking
[1:05:07] there's no one like god
[1:05:09] who is like unto thee o lord among the
[1:05:11] gods no one
[1:05:13] absolutely no one romans 11 34 through
[1:05:16] 36
[1:05:18] for who hath known the mind of the lord
[1:05:20] or who hath been his counselor
[1:05:22] or who hath first given
[1:05:25] to him and it shall be recompensed unto
[1:05:27] him again
[1:05:28] for of him and through him and to him
[1:05:30] are all things to whom be glory
[1:05:33] forever
[1:05:34] amen god is not in need of anything
[1:05:39] we can give
[1:05:40] amen
[1:05:42] amen
[1:05:45] who who
[1:05:47] who has first given
[1:05:48] to him and it shall be recompensed unto
[1:05:51] him in other words you're going to give
[1:05:52] to god and he's got to pay it back
[1:05:56] no it's not
[1:06:00] he doesn't need anything from you
[1:06:04] he is complete
[1:06:07] in himself
[1:06:09] he's absolutely complete in himself now
[1:06:13] you might scratch your head and say well
[1:06:14] why did he create why is there this
[1:06:17] you have to stop there if god is not
[1:06:20] completing himself
[1:06:22] we have a problem
[1:06:24] because we now we have a being that
[1:06:26] needs something from us
[1:06:28] god does not need anything from us
[1:06:30] in god are attributes
[1:06:33] those attributes
[1:06:35] need to be expressed
[1:06:36] need to be manifested
[1:06:38] one of god's
[1:06:40] attributes
[1:06:41] is light
[1:06:43] god is light
[1:06:45] god is love
[1:06:46] these things require
[1:06:49] manifestation whatsoever doth make
[1:06:51] manifest is light the apostle paul said
[1:06:55] so light is manifested so in god it's to
[1:06:59] manifest himself
[1:07:01] well if there's no one else there who's
[1:07:03] going to see it
[1:07:05] so
[1:07:06] god is completely satisfied
[1:07:09] in himself and therefore we can be
[1:07:12] completely satisfied in him
[1:07:15] you know if if we're coming to a being
[1:07:17] that's not satisfied in himself
[1:07:20] how then can we
[1:07:22] possibly be completely satisfied in him
[1:07:26] he is
[1:07:28] god is love
[1:07:29] god is the ultimate perfection amen
[1:07:33] he needs i repeat it the third time he
[1:07:37] needs nothing from
[1:07:39] you
[1:07:41] god is
[1:07:42] happy
[1:07:44] god is joyful
[1:07:46] with or without you
[1:07:49] with or without you
[1:07:51] he doesn't somehow
[1:07:52] get complete when you lift your hands to
[1:07:55] worship him
[1:07:56] he doesn't get bigger when you praise
[1:07:59] him or testify about him
[1:08:02] he is who he is
[1:08:04] he never changes
[1:08:06] he can't be added to he cannot be taken
[1:08:08] away
[1:08:09] and again i say
[1:08:10] there are attributes that he must
[1:08:12] express
[1:08:14] that's clear
[1:08:17] and he wants to be
[1:08:18] worshipped
[1:08:20] but again he has to be all satisfying
[1:08:23] within himself
[1:08:26] for of him and through him and to him
[1:08:29] are
[1:08:30] all things except for he needs to be
[1:08:33] worshipped
[1:08:34] he needs to be
[1:08:36] added to by your faith no
[1:08:39] not true at all
[1:08:42] for of him and through him and to him
[1:08:44] are all things to whom be glory forever
[1:08:48] amen
[1:08:49] everything belongs to god in the first
[1:08:51] place
[1:08:52] there's nothing we can add or take away
[1:08:54] from him god is self-sufficient
[1:08:58] he's not
[1:09:00] sufficient
[1:09:01] because of you through you or something
[1:09:04] that you had he's self-sufficient
[1:09:10] we derive our life
[1:09:12] and everything from
[1:09:14] him amen
[1:09:17] and the fact is if you really look at
[1:09:19] the the big picture here
[1:09:21] his family is him
[1:09:25] you know when we look at first
[1:09:26] corinthians 15 it says
[1:09:28] that
[1:09:29] god
[1:09:31] will be all in all
[1:09:33] so when when the the kingdom is finished
[1:09:36] the son
[1:09:37] son
[1:09:39] becomes subject to the father says that
[1:09:42] god might be
[1:09:44] all
[1:09:45] and in all
[1:09:48] so it's god and his family god and his
[1:09:51] attributes what is that all
[1:09:54] it's god
[1:09:55] it's god fully manifested on display and
[1:09:59] yet
[1:10:00] you know this isn't pantheism
[1:10:03] where everything is god your god and
[1:10:05] your god and your god that's not that's
[1:10:07] not what we're talking about
[1:10:09] it's god's life it's god's expression
[1:10:11] it's god's manifestation god in himself
[1:10:15] is a spirit we talked about that
[1:10:17] god
[1:10:19] covers all space and time the prophet
[1:10:21] said
[1:10:22] god is distinct and different and
[1:10:25] separate from
[1:10:27] you
[1:10:28] and yet you know when he
[1:10:31] let's put it this way
[1:10:33] when god gives birth
[1:10:35] to you
[1:10:36] is god less of a god
[1:10:39] no
[1:10:40] god remains the one who covers all space
[1:10:43] and time
[1:10:45] he doesn't lose part of himself when you
[1:10:48] come out from him
[1:10:49] when the logos comes out from him
[1:10:52] doesn't mean god somebody somehow
[1:10:53] becomes lesser
[1:10:55] god is now putting himself on display
[1:11:02] there's no word of blasphemy
[1:11:04] that could take away from who god is
[1:11:08] in his character and a central being
[1:11:11] and there's no amount of faith that we
[1:11:13] could put in him that would add to his
[1:11:15] essential being
[1:11:16] being
[1:11:17] and character he's the sum
[1:11:20] of all perfection amen
[1:11:23] yes god is glorified or dishonored
[1:11:26] by us but that takes nothing or away
[1:11:29] from him it doesn't add anything to him
[1:11:33] he is who he is i am that i am
[1:11:37] he doesn't change
[1:11:38] and nothing you do or don't do changes
[1:11:44] to glorify him is actually just
[1:11:46] recognizing a reality that exists
[1:11:50] to blaspheme him is to fall on a
[1:11:53] impenetrable rock
[1:11:56] it can only crush you you cannot crush
[1:11:58] it
[1:12:00] all the blasphemies and the nonsense
[1:12:02] that goes forth and
[1:12:04] on the internet and and on the radio
[1:12:06] waves and and the disgusting filth that
[1:12:10] is put forth
[1:12:12] through this whole earth and it's then
[1:12:13] the media that goes forward
[1:12:16] doesn't take anything away from god
[1:12:19] it doesn't change a thing
[1:12:21] in god
[1:12:27] it only
[1:12:29] brings forth
[1:12:31] judgment
[1:12:32] and wrath
[1:12:34] that is being stored up amen
[1:12:37] isaiah 40 verse 21 and 20 through 23
[1:12:43] have you not known
[1:12:45] have you not heard
[1:12:47] hath it not been told you from the
[1:12:48] beginning
[1:12:50] have you not understood from the
[1:12:52] foundations of the earth
[1:12:55] it is he that sitteth upon the circle of
[1:12:57] the earth
[1:12:58] and the inhabitants thereof are as
[1:13:00] grasshoppers that stretcheth out the
[1:13:02] heavens as a curtain and spreads them
[1:13:04] out as a tent
[1:13:06] to dwell in
[1:13:07] that bringeth the princes to nothing he
[1:13:10] makes the judges of the earth as
[1:13:13] vanity god is so far
[1:13:16] above us
[1:13:18] in his eyes
[1:13:19] your grasshoppers
[1:13:21] think about that from just a little bug
[1:13:25] that's what we are in comparison to
[1:13:28] the greatness of god and even that is a
[1:13:31] human way of explaining it it's bigger
[1:13:33] than that
[1:13:35] he's infinitely greater than you
[1:13:38] this is just a a
[1:13:40] anthropomorphism as what they call it a
[1:13:42] human way of speaking that we would
[1:13:44] understand god is saying i'm way above
[1:13:47] you i'm way higher than you
[1:13:50] you shouldn't think of me the way you
[1:13:52] you're thinking about me as an idol or
[1:13:54] as some kind of thing like that
[1:13:56] i'm i
[1:13:58] i sit on the earth
[1:14:00] i'm so big that the earth is just a
[1:14:02] chair for me
[1:14:04] amen
[1:14:05] and another place that says heaven is my
[1:14:07] throne and the earth is just a footstool
[1:14:10] it's just a little ottoman that i stick
[1:14:11] my feet on
[1:14:12] relax a little bit
[1:14:16] it's quite a statement
[1:14:19] the inhabitants of the earth are
[1:14:22] like
[1:14:23] bugs
[1:14:25] little tiny bugs insignificant
[1:14:28] little things
[1:14:30] and yet
[1:14:31] in god's eyes it's all significant
[1:14:35] it's just that you're
[1:14:37] you are small we are little
[1:14:40] we should feel that we shouldn't say oh
[1:14:43] ouch he's calling us a bunch of bugs
[1:14:46] no he's not calling us a bunch of bugs
[1:14:48] he's saying this is how great the god
[1:14:52] that you serve is the god that's chosen
[1:14:54] you the god that loves you the god
[1:14:56] that's called you this is how big he is
[1:14:59] in comparison to you
[1:15:01] why are you worried why are you afraid
[1:15:05] preaching to myself here
[1:15:07] amen
[1:15:09] stretches out the heavens like a curtain
[1:15:11] he's just the
[1:15:12] the heaven is just like
[1:15:15] that's how big it is god can take it
[1:15:16] like a curtain to cover a window
[1:15:21] and spreads them out like a tent
[1:15:23] a place to dwell in
[1:15:25] and he brings
[1:15:26] presidents
[1:15:28] senators
[1:15:30] congressmen to nothing
[1:15:33] and he makes
[1:15:35] the supreme court justices
[1:15:37] as vanity
[1:15:40] let's put it in our own
[1:15:42] terminology
[1:15:44] god puts into office who he wants to put
[1:15:46] into office he takes them out
[1:15:49] he hinders them where he wants to hinder
[1:15:51] them he blocks them where he wants to
[1:15:52] block them
[1:15:54] he allows the media to go crazy against
[1:15:57] some he
[1:15:58] allows another group of media to go
[1:16:00] crazy against others
[1:16:02] and what it what is it it's god
[1:16:05] outworking his
[1:16:06] will to accomplish his purpose on the
[1:16:09] earth
[1:16:10] it's not something that's out of god's
[1:16:12] control
[1:16:13] there are grasshoppers you don't think
[1:16:15] god can control a grasshopper
[1:16:18] you can control a grasshopper god can
[1:16:21] control
[1:16:22] presidents and judges and people in
[1:16:24] authority
[1:16:28] exodus 8 verse 10
[1:16:32] and he said tomorrow and he said be it
[1:16:35] according to thy word
[1:16:36] that thou mayest know that there is none
[1:16:39] like unto the lord
[1:16:41] our god
[1:16:43] there's none like him
[1:16:45] you can't compare god to anyone or
[1:16:47] anything
[1:16:49] second samuel 7 22
[1:17:00] wherefore thou art
[1:17:02] great o lord god for there is none like
[1:17:05] thee
[1:17:05] neither is there any god beside thee
[1:17:08] according to all that we have heard
[1:17:10] with
[1:17:11] our ears
[1:17:13] none before him not like him none beside
[1:17:16] him
[1:17:18] he is
[1:17:19] the only
[1:17:20] living true sovereign supreme god
[1:17:24] first timothy 6 16
[1:17:28] who only hath immortality
[1:17:31] dwelling in the light which no man can
[1:17:34] approach unto
[1:17:35] whom no man has seen nor can see
[1:17:38] to whom be honor and power everlasting
[1:17:42] amen
[1:17:44] god is the only one who's immortal
[1:17:47] anyone else that
[1:17:48] is
[1:17:49] becomes immortal does it as a result to
[1:17:52] their connection
[1:17:54] to him
[1:17:56] and
[1:17:57] we cannot
[1:17:59] even approach unto this light
[1:18:01] you know if this was said in the old
[1:18:03] testament i could might understand it
[1:18:05] even better
[1:18:06] but this is said in the new testament
[1:18:08] when we're covered by the blood clothed
[1:18:10] with the righteousness of jesus christ
[1:18:12] and yet still we have god telling us
[1:18:16] that i dwell in light which no man
[1:18:19] can approach unto
[1:18:21] it doesn't qualify that which no sinner
[1:18:23] can approach unto
[1:18:26] no one
[1:18:27] can approach unto him
[1:18:29] unbidden
[1:18:30] amen
[1:18:32] but thank the lord he bids us
[1:18:35] to come before
[1:18:36] the throne of grace and that it is a
[1:18:38] throne of grace
[1:18:40] it's not a throne of judgment
[1:18:44] but yet he has to make the invitation he
[1:18:46] has to call us
[1:18:48] he has to bring us near and into his
[1:18:51] presence
[1:18:53] who no man
[1:18:55] has seen nor can
[1:18:58] see that's an amazing statement when you
[1:18:59] think of all the places in the bible
[1:19:01] where they they saw the god of israel
[1:19:04] you know it talks about that in the old
[1:19:05] testament
[1:19:07] and yet that was merely seeing a what we
[1:19:10] call a theophany
[1:19:12] you know the logos an appearance
[1:19:14] of almighty god you god in himself is
[1:19:17] invisible
[1:19:18] the bible says no man has seen god john
[1:19:21] 1 18
[1:19:22] no man has seen god at any time
[1:19:25] you can't see him
[1:19:26] because he's invisible but yet you can
[1:19:28] see his manifestation
[1:19:31] first corinthians 2 verse 10
[1:19:35] but god hath revealed it them unto his
[1:19:37] spirit unto us by his spirit for the
[1:19:40] spirit searches all things yea
[1:19:42] the deep things of god it's only by
[1:19:46] revelation from god himself to the
[1:19:49] individual
[1:19:50] believer
[1:19:52] that we can understand and know him and
[1:19:54] approach unto him
[1:19:56] at all
[1:19:58] you know
[1:19:58] what did
[1:20:00] what did jesus ask the disciples he said
[1:20:03] whom do man say i the son of mannam they
[1:20:06] went through jeremiah this prophet that
[1:20:08] prophet john the baptist raised from the
[1:20:11] dead but who do you say that i am
[1:20:14] peter said you're the christ the son of
[1:20:15] the living god
[1:20:17] he said flesh and blood is not revealed
[1:20:19] it unto you jesus standing there in
[1:20:21] front of him flesh and blood he says it
[1:20:23] wasn't me that revealed it unto you but
[1:20:25] my father
[1:20:27] which is in heaven the spirit of god
[1:20:31] revealed that to
[1:20:33] peter so he would know the reality of
[1:20:36] who jesus christ was and it has to come
[1:20:38] the same way
[1:20:39] for you and me
[1:20:41] amen
[1:20:43] let's
[1:20:44] let's look we spoke about it a bit but
[1:20:47] let's look at the holiness of god
[1:20:50] you can skip a little bit but
[1:20:54] the word holy speaks of being
[1:20:57] consecrated or
[1:20:58] set apart
[1:21:01] in our case it speaks of
[1:21:03] sanctification
[1:21:04] the word sanctified
[1:21:06] is the action of being made holy in our
[1:21:09] case of course it includes cleansing
[1:21:12] but in god's case there's no cleansing
[1:21:14] necessary
[1:21:15] he is holy god is absolute
[1:21:19] and infinite
[1:21:20] purity
[1:21:22] god is infinite
[1:21:24] in holiness
[1:21:25] set apart in other words he's infinite
[1:21:29] in being different than all of us who is
[1:21:31] like unto the lord we went through those
[1:21:33] scriptures no there's no one
[1:21:35] like him he's utterly completely
[1:21:38] different from you
[1:21:40] and from me
[1:21:42] revelation
[1:21:44] 15 verse 4
[1:21:47] who shall not fear thee o lord and
[1:21:49] glorify thy name for thou only
[1:21:53] art holy amen
[1:21:56] only god is holy
[1:21:58] you and i are not holy
[1:22:00] yet
[1:22:02] he makes us holy brother branham tells
[1:22:04] us you're not we're none of us are holy
[1:22:06] but it's a holy spirit
[1:22:08] dwelling within us
[1:22:10] that's what sets us apart
[1:22:12] unto god
[1:22:14] exodus 15 11
[1:22:17] who is like unto thee oh lord among the
[1:22:18] gods who is like the glorious in
[1:22:20] holiness we read that earlier fearful
[1:22:22] and praises doing
[1:22:25] wonders habakkuk 1 13
[1:22:29] thou art of purer eyes than to behold
[1:22:32] evil and can't not
[1:22:34] look on
[1:22:36] iniquity
[1:22:38] it's incredible
[1:22:46] god
[1:22:48] sees us
[1:22:50] through the through through the blood of
[1:22:52] jesus christ
[1:22:54] and we're so thankful for that
[1:22:56] because us on our own we are so
[1:22:59] filthy in his sight all of our
[1:23:02] righteousness
[1:23:03] are as filthy rags
[1:23:06] all the good things that we can do
[1:23:08] even those things are corrupted
[1:23:11] in the eyes of god
[1:23:12] and yet it is through that blood of
[1:23:15] jesus christ that sets us apart
[1:23:17] and through that only nothing that we
[1:23:19] can do
[1:23:21] but it's god's work in us
[1:23:24] uh the next
[1:23:25] attribute of god is the the councils of
[1:23:28] god
[1:23:29] and when i look at
[1:23:31] acts 15 verse 18.
[1:23:34] the the council or the decrees of god
[1:23:37] speaks of god's plan or purpose
[1:23:40] that he's ordained to accomplish
[1:23:44] acts 15 verse
[1:23:46] 18.
[1:23:47] known unto god
[1:23:49] are all his works
[1:23:51] from the beginning of the world
[1:23:56] so god's decrees
[1:23:59] are known
[1:24:00] are planned
[1:24:02] from the very beginning of the world
[1:24:05] god isn't coming up with new plans new
[1:24:07] ideas new thoughts
[1:24:09] ephesians 3 11
[1:24:12] according to the eternal purpose which
[1:24:14] he purposed in christ jesus
[1:24:17] our lord
[1:24:19] so
[1:24:20] his purpose is what it's eternal
[1:24:22] it never had a beginning
[1:24:24] never has an end
[1:24:26] so
[1:24:28] god's thoughts are eternal we'll read
[1:24:29] that quote in a moment you're familiar
[1:24:31] with i'm sure
[1:24:33] acts 2 23
[1:24:36] him being delivered by the determinate
[1:24:39] counsel and foreknowledge of god you
[1:24:41] have taken
[1:24:42] and by wicked hands have crucified
[1:24:45] and slain so it was god's
[1:24:47] determinate
[1:24:49] counsel he predetermined
[1:24:52] what would happen
[1:24:54] not just in that specific instance he
[1:24:56] predetermines everything
[1:25:00] that has happened is happening and will
[1:25:03] happen
[1:25:04] ephesians 1 11
[1:25:07] in whom
[1:25:08] also we have obtained an inheritance
[1:25:10] being predestinated according to the
[1:25:12] purpose of him
[1:25:14] who worketh all things after the council
[1:25:16] of his own will god
[1:25:18] works he he cut to accomplish
[1:25:22] his own will
[1:25:24] he doesn't just set it as a clockmaker
[1:25:26] and and let it happen but he's actively
[1:25:28] working amongst his people amongst his
[1:25:31] creation to make his will come to pass
[1:25:37] ephesians 1 verse
[1:25:38] 9. having made known unto us the mystery
[1:25:42] of his will
[1:25:44] according to his good pleasure
[1:25:46] which he hath purposed in
[1:25:49] him
[1:25:50] self so
[1:25:51] his good pleasure that he's doing that
[1:25:54] he's doing his his purpose that he's
[1:25:55] accomplishing
[1:25:57] is in himself
[1:25:59] so before the foundation of the world in
[1:26:01] his thoughts in his mind
[1:26:03] he
[1:26:04] made his plan and his purpose and set it
[1:26:07] forward to accomplish it
[1:26:10] god's purpose is eternal
[1:26:12] that change is not god's decree or
[1:26:15] counsel
[1:26:16] is actually predetermined
[1:26:19] what he is going to do his plan
[1:26:22] he's determined before the world was
[1:26:24] ever created
[1:26:26] what he will do
[1:26:27] and god works everything according to
[1:26:29] the council of his own will
[1:26:31] he purposed it all in himself what would
[1:26:33] please him
[1:26:34] that's what he does and that's what he
[1:26:36] work works out
[1:26:37] god's will is free and his purposes
[1:26:40] can't be thwarted
[1:26:42] or changed isaiah 40
[1:26:45] 13 and 14
[1:26:47] who hath directed
[1:26:49] the spirit of the lord
[1:26:51] or being his counselor hath taught him
[1:26:54] with whom took he counsel and who
[1:26:56] instructed him
[1:26:57] and taught him in the path of judgment
[1:26:59] and taught him knowledge and showed him
[1:27:01] the way of understanding no one has
[1:27:05] no one has this is from
[1:27:07] the smyrnian church age in the church
[1:27:08] ages book
[1:27:10] says the eternal thoughts of god let me
[1:27:13] ask you are the thoughts of god eternal
[1:27:16] if you can see this you'll see many
[1:27:18] things
[1:27:19] this is such a foundational quote
[1:27:23] i think we should all memorize it it's
[1:27:25] so incredible it would help us
[1:27:28] every single day of our life if we would
[1:27:29] get this grasp this quote god is
[1:27:32] unchangeable in both essence
[1:27:34] and
[1:27:36] behavior
[1:27:37] we have studied that and proven that
[1:27:39] already god is infinite in his abilities
[1:27:42] so therefore he as god must be
[1:27:44] omniscient
[1:27:45] if he is omniscient then he is not now
[1:27:48] learning
[1:27:50] nor is he taking counsel even with
[1:27:51] himself nor is he at any time adding to
[1:27:54] his knowledge
[1:27:55] if he can add to his knowledge then he's
[1:27:57] not
[1:27:58] omniscient the best we could say is that
[1:28:01] sometime he will be but that's not
[1:28:03] scriptural he is omniscient
[1:28:05] he has nev listened to this
[1:28:07] he has never
[1:28:09] had a new thought
[1:28:12] you know we cannot understand
[1:28:14] such a thing we're having new thoughts
[1:28:16] all the time
[1:28:17] we're battling not to have new thoughts
[1:28:19] and just let's stay the line and be
[1:28:21] consistent no i'm going to do this no
[1:28:23] let's go here let's do
[1:28:25] slow down
[1:28:27] but god doesn't he doesn't operate that
[1:28:29] way
[1:28:31] his mind doesn't think that that that
[1:28:33] way
[1:28:34] he has never had a new thought about
[1:28:35] anything because all his thoughts he has
[1:28:38] always had and always will have
[1:28:40] and knows the end from the beginning
[1:28:42] because he is god
[1:28:44] thus the thoughts of god are eternal
[1:28:48] they are real
[1:28:49] they are not simply like a man with the
[1:28:51] blue print he has drawn up and which one
[1:28:53] day will be translated into substance
[1:28:55] and form
[1:28:56] but they're already real
[1:28:58] and eternal and listen to this
[1:29:01] and a part of
[1:29:04] god
[1:29:06] this
[1:29:07] statement this paragraph is astounding
[1:29:10] look it up
[1:29:12] read it again and then again and again
[1:29:14] and again and again
[1:29:18] i do i mean it's it just
[1:29:20] it's something that
[1:29:22] it gives you the reality and awesomeness
[1:29:25] of god
[1:29:27] god's counsels are absolute
[1:29:31] and they're unconditional
[1:29:34] it's not as though god says if you do
[1:29:36] this then this will happen now we're
[1:29:38] talking about god and himself you're
[1:29:40] probably going to scripture and thinking
[1:29:41] about about that what about this what
[1:29:43] about that
[1:29:44] we're talking about god in himself
[1:29:49] god never has a new thought he never
[1:29:52] changes his mind
[1:29:54] his decrees are absolute
[1:29:59] and god's purpose is
[1:30:01] immutable
[1:30:03] and it is also
[1:30:05] invincible
[1:30:07] immutable means it's incapable of change
[1:30:10] invincible means that they cannot be
[1:30:12] conquered or
[1:30:14] overcome
[1:30:16] too often in our talk in our in our
[1:30:18] speech and in our fellowship and talking
[1:30:21] with people we talk as though god
[1:30:24] changes his mind changes away changes
[1:30:26] the road
[1:30:28] we change
[1:30:30] we get confused i get it we do i do
[1:30:34] half the time i feel confused
[1:30:38] you know
[1:30:39] what is the lord doing
[1:30:41] what's the next step
[1:30:43] i'm completely relying on him
[1:30:45] we have to completely rely on him god's
[1:30:47] not confused
[1:30:49] god but he doesn't owe us
[1:30:51] an explanation
[1:30:53] that's the thing that we think is we get
[1:30:55] so frustrated and i get frustrated you
[1:30:58] start to get angry what is going on here
[1:31:02] what's happening
[1:31:04] sometimes we just have to stop
[1:31:06] and slow down and say you know lord you
[1:31:09] don't owe me an explanation
[1:31:12] i surrender myself to you
[1:31:15] help me just to be content
[1:31:18] with where i'm at with what's happening
[1:31:20] around me
[1:31:22] help
[1:31:22] if it's not right what's happening
[1:31:24] around me help me to pray
[1:31:26] and have the right attitude
[1:31:28] but understand that god has decreed that
[1:31:31] what is happening around you would
[1:31:33] happen
[1:31:34] and god is doing
[1:31:36] uh
[1:31:37] this uh
[1:31:39] pastor john piper that um he was my
[1:31:42] pastor actually in
[1:31:43] before i came to the message
[1:31:45] and uh
[1:31:46] was a
[1:31:47] wonderful
[1:31:49] wonderful pastor and i can't say any
[1:31:52] anything bad against him i really
[1:31:53] appreciated his
[1:31:55] his counsel his counsel led me to
[1:31:58] receive the message to
[1:32:00] just to be straightforward he's a
[1:32:01] baptist
[1:32:03] preacher but he was
[1:32:05] he is a wise man and i appreciate him
[1:32:07] but he said god is
[1:32:09] always doing
[1:32:11] ten thousand things in your life that
[1:32:13] you have no idea that he's doing
[1:32:18] and that's true
[1:32:20] that's true
[1:32:22] and it's probably more than that
[1:32:25] that's maybe an understate statement
[1:32:27] god is working and god is accomplishing
[1:32:30] something and i think if we can
[1:32:32] if we can
[1:32:33] catch
[1:32:34] the vision of who god is
[1:32:38] then that can help us in our interaction
[1:32:41] with each other
[1:32:43] to be able to
[1:32:44] with confidence
[1:32:47] follow the scriptural way
[1:32:49] and not follow the human way
[1:32:52] in other words
[1:32:55] have you ever had anyone in this church
[1:32:57] frustrate you
[1:32:59] the whole church raises their hand yes
[1:33:02] don't point at anybody so
[1:33:05] that
[1:33:06] is the reality brother luther is
[1:33:08] pointing at himself for everybody else
[1:33:14] the po that's not the point of pointing
[1:33:16] fingers the point
[1:33:18] is
[1:33:19] that that's the reality
[1:33:21] is that
[1:33:23] god sends us
[1:33:24] trials
[1:33:26] god sends us
[1:33:28] frustrating people why because he wants
[1:33:30] us to have
[1:33:32] perfect love
[1:33:34] if everything is just nice and sweet
[1:33:37] and everything is perfect around us we
[1:33:40] don't grow
[1:33:41] we get weaker and so if we can
[1:33:45] take the i really mean that find that
[1:33:48] quote if you can't find it just text me
[1:33:50] find that quote and read it and start
[1:33:53] applying it to your
[1:33:55] way of thinking
[1:33:56] it will change you it will change
[1:33:59] how how you feel about things
[1:34:02] it will change your emotions it will
[1:34:04] change your attitude
[1:34:06] if you really recognize what it's saying
[1:34:11] you're not going to conquer
[1:34:13] god
[1:34:14] you're not going to conquer
[1:34:15] his
[1:34:16] purpose we have choices to make it's
[1:34:20] obvio that's obvious i'm that's on our
[1:34:22] side
[1:34:23] we have choices about our attitude we
[1:34:25] have choices about uh
[1:34:27] uh where we're gonna go where we're
[1:34:29] gonna live what car we're gonna drive
[1:34:30] what
[1:34:31] what
[1:34:32] a job we're gonna work at what we're
[1:34:34] gonna eat for breakfast we have lots
[1:34:37] and lots and lots of choices to make
[1:34:40] and i pray we all make the right
[1:34:42] choices that's on our that's on our end
[1:34:46] that's on our perspective but god isn't
[1:34:48] looking at
[1:34:50] things that way
[1:34:51] now don't go and say it was
[1:34:53] predetermined that i was going to have
[1:34:55] orange juice uh this morning or that
[1:34:58] light was going to be i mean it was
[1:35:01] it was
[1:35:02] but don't get weird like that
[1:35:05] be balanced
[1:35:07] um
[1:35:08] you know i was
[1:35:10] teasing brother
[1:35:11] ken because every time i go into urban
[1:35:13] brew
[1:35:14] they're night i love nitro cold brew but
[1:35:16] their nitro cold brew
[1:35:19] machine is not working or it's run out
[1:35:21] or something's happened every single
[1:35:23] time when i go there i just told him
[1:35:24] his predestined whenever i come next he
[1:35:27] says come in uh come stop by sometime
[1:35:30] and i said whenever your nitro cold brew
[1:35:32] machine is not working i'll be there
[1:35:35] by this time it's predetermined
[1:35:41] you know you know
[1:35:43] you know how
[1:35:44] people can get so fanatical in their way
[1:35:46] of thinking about about stuff but
[1:35:50] the reality is that god is in control
[1:35:53] absolutely everything he's orchestrating
[1:35:55] the situation in your life and he's
[1:35:57] watching and waiting
[1:35:59] to see how you will respond of course he
[1:36:01] knows how you're going to respond
[1:36:04] but the fact is
[1:36:07] it's it's how we respond that matters
[1:36:10] it's how we respond that we're going to
[1:36:12] be judged because we are making choices
[1:36:15] us making choices is not in
[1:36:17] contradiction to the
[1:36:19] god predetermining what is going to
[1:36:21] happen
[1:36:22] it's not in contradiction
[1:36:24] in the human mind it's a contradiction
[1:36:27] in the divine
[1:36:28] word
[1:36:29] and and the divine mind it's not a
[1:36:32] contradiction
[1:36:34] that's
[1:36:35] something that you'd you
[1:36:39] we there's all kinds of explanations
[1:36:41] that we can
[1:36:42] bring regarding that
[1:36:44] um but the fact is
[1:36:47] the reality is there isn't an
[1:36:49] explanation for it
[1:36:51] we accept it by faith we have a choice
[1:36:54] and god determines everything that
[1:36:56] happens
[1:36:57] and so
[1:36:59] that's what scripture says
[1:37:02] that's what the message says
[1:37:04] and a real true genuine explanation is
[1:37:07] not there it's there's things that we
[1:37:09] have to
[1:37:10] accept by faith without understanding
[1:37:14] the actual answer
[1:37:16] philosophers for 2000 years of
[1:37:18] christianity and theologians have been
[1:37:21] trying to solve that problem no one's
[1:37:23] ever solved it the only solution is it's
[1:37:26] in the word i believe it
[1:37:30] and that's not a bad thing there's a lot
[1:37:32] of things that we don't
[1:37:34] fully and completely understand
[1:37:38] we walk we walk by faith
[1:37:41] and not by sight
[1:37:45] amen musicians if you'd come
[1:37:53] i really want i really want you to i'm
[1:37:55] going to remind you for the 15th time
[1:37:57] really want you
[1:37:59] to find that quote
[1:38:02] and i want you to feed on it make it
[1:38:04] your devotions for a few days
[1:38:07] you got it
[1:38:09] i'll read it again
[1:38:11] the
[1:38:12] eternal thoughts of god
[1:38:15] let me ask you are the thoughts of god
[1:38:16] eternal
[1:38:18] if you can see this
[1:38:20] you will see many things
[1:38:25] god is unchangeable in both essence and
[1:38:27] behavior
[1:38:29] i'm gonna skip down god is infinite in
[1:38:31] his abilities there so therefore he as
[1:38:34] god must be omniscient
[1:38:37] if he's omniscient then he's not now
[1:38:38] learning nor is he taking counsel even
[1:38:40] with himself
[1:38:42] nor is he at any time adding to his
[1:38:44] knowledge
[1:38:46] if he can add to his knowledge then he
[1:38:48] is not omniscient the best we could say
[1:38:50] is that sometime he will be but that is
[1:38:52] not scriptural he is is omniscient
[1:38:55] he never had a new thought about
[1:38:56] anything because all his thoughts
[1:38:59] he's always had and always will have
[1:39:02] and knows the end from the beginning
[1:39:04] because
[1:39:05] he is god thus the thoughts of god are
[1:39:08] eternal
[1:39:09] they are real they're not simply like a
[1:39:11] man with a blueprint he has drawn up and
[1:39:14] which one day
[1:39:15] will be translated into substance and
[1:39:17] form but they are already
[1:39:19] real eternal
[1:39:22] and part of god
[1:39:24] a beautiful and i was going to ask you
[1:39:27] to sing that song
[1:39:29] after service and i didn't and god just
[1:39:31] asked you
[1:39:32] on my behalf so we just have a
[1:39:34] demonstration of the sovereignty of god
[1:39:39] his decrees and councils are perfect
[1:39:41] let's pray stand
[1:39:46] heavenly father we're so thankful
[1:39:51] we want to we want to know you
[1:39:55] in all that you are lord
[1:39:57] [Music]
[1:39:59] we want to know you
[1:40:01] more and more lord not
[1:40:03] by knowledge
[1:40:05] mere knowledge
[1:40:06] by human understanding lord but by
[1:40:09] a personal revelation to us
[1:40:13] one that would be renewing us
[1:40:17] from glory to glory changing us
[1:40:21] we want to behold you lord we want to
[1:40:23] stand
[1:40:25] in your awesome presence
[1:40:29] and just experience
[1:40:32] your great glory lord
[1:40:35] we thank you father
[1:40:37] and we give you praise in jesus name
[1:40:40] amen
[1:40:42] amen let's worship the lord you are god
[1:40:45] alone
[1:40:45] [Music]
[1:40:46] from before time began
[1:40:51] you are on your throne
[1:40:54] you are god alone
[1:40:59] and right now
