[Music] [Music] [Music] everyone God bless you we're going to continue on the topic the gene of God part five and normally I'd have you stand but we're going to do it a little differently we'll uh we'll pray you can keep at your seats and we'll start going through a few different things here so Heavenly Father we come before you Lord and we ask that your Holy Spirit would come and take your word and make it alive in our hearts Lord thank you so much for supplying us Lord with such a rich and beautiful revelation of yourself in this day Lord through that prophet Lord who just got himself out of the way Lord May uh May each of us do the same get ourselves out of the way that your Revelation could flow through US Lord that we would be a light to this fallen and evil World father go before us Lord we just bind every Spirit of the enemy in the name of Jesus Christ and we ask that healing and and strengthening and understanding would flow to your people we ask in Jesus name amen so the gene of God we're talking about you know the the background of this word the word Genesis is the Greek translation for the word beginning in the beginning then we fast forward to the Greek New Testament and we have this word only begotten son so that word only begotten is manojanao uniquely begotten our term Gene so you see that word there in general Gene obviously so our term Gene has that same origin as the term only begotten Gene by definition is a unit of heredity which is transferred from a parent to offspring and is held to to determine some characteristic of The Offspring so Gene speaks of origin in connection with his characteristics same idea behind the word attribute that you hear Brother Branham used so frequently the word characteristic our nature and characteristics come from our origin and a point that I want to make is science looks at this as flesh only this is all that they look at it you're you're functioning of your brain the functioning of our bodies but there's a lot of there's a lot that they miss because of that because we're we're a tripartite being we're made we're made of a spiritual aspect we're made up of a fleshly aspect and then behind on the inside of the inside of that there is a soul and so I think it's clear as we'll study this is that all three of those are impacted by genetics let me just let me just take a minute and talk about that before we prove our point we'll just talk about it for a second you see the the the the thought behind it so our spirit right that's our that's our that's where our mind resides right you have a brain that connects this body this is like a computer that connects this body to the thing that actually runs it which is the spiritual aspect behind it when that spiritual aspect is severed from this body the body as a computer as as a machine and credible machine that God made Beyond any computer that's ever designed it it's done it's finished We Lay It We Lay it in the ground right and God will pick it up again in the resurrection but if we if if we separate that we don't cease to have our memories you know we can go through scripture on this but it's very clear that all all the people in that are in heaven have the memories of what they were on Earth we've we read it before about that um Lazarus and the rich man the rich man knew his family had feelings for his family um on Earth desired they're even in Hell desired their salvation that they wouldn't come to that place and you know in a way they were praying they were they were making a prayer please send them you know making it through Abraham but please send them back if you send them back they'll believe so they're and then in Revelation chapter five uh no chapter six but the fifth seal the souls under the altar how long Lord till you avenge our blood and he says a little while a little while until your brethren are killed like you so they they know their connection they know their connection to other people so when our my when our spirit separates from our body we don't cease to think we don't cease to operate the brain is a connection between that spirit and your body to control the body memory conscience reason affection and I always miss one of them um and I'm so what's that imagination thank you you know each of those continue to exist after the spirit leaves this body that's a spirit then the Soul that's the nature of the spirit and in Us in everybody there's a hybrid nature all of this all three of these things we can find and we the characteristics of those of who you are is connected to your parentage all of that comes from back back back you're the sum total of the genetics of your mother's side and father's side and all their ancestors all the way back to the very beginning and so that that isn't it isn't as though God makes your body and then your spirit and soul come into it and it's something totally separate and different you can always find that those those spiritual you can trace it back to characteristics even Paul says you you know you receive this from your grandmother Lois well you say it was just she just read the Bible to him no he he's saying there's a genetic thing that's passed on and we all can find that within our if we search back and look back you can see how there's a stream of spiritual people following the word for your age somewhere in your family even if and even if not it still can pop out of nowhere two total unbelieving Heathen parents can produce a son or daughter of God say how is it possible well let's keep studying First John 3 8-10 we read it I think four times through the last um uh sermon and and Sunday school that showed us that there are those born of God who have the seed of God in them the Sheep they're a children of God by election they have a place in their hearts for the word and then there are those who are the children of the devil they're not sheep and we found out that the word has no place in them they're both born in the same condition dead in sin walking after the prince of the power of the air but some have a place for the word to receive the word and some have no place for that word First John 3 10 says they're manifest by whether they do righteousness and love their brother the seed of God hear the voice of the shepherd and their life begins to manifest the life of their parent God the children of the devil they hate his voice they want to silence it and they work against it though they be ever so religious they're religious because they have that inside of them from from Eve the genetics from Eve the seed of God can receive the true baptism of the Holy Ghost every seed can receive an anointing every seed can receive an anointing it doesn't matter if you're the seed of God or the seed of the serpent you can receive an anointing but the true seed of God is the one that can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and their souls galatian calls it adoption or other words the placing of sons because you are Sons he sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart whereby you cry father father Abba Father you can do that because you are Sons not because you became Sons but because you are Sons by predestination in the sermon communion let's look at a few places that brother Branham clearly shows that this Gene seed of God is there you're born with it from your mother it's not something that enters into you later on but it's inside of you by by election I was taking I was saying this taking for myself like he was going to say William Branham well 40 years ago with the William Branham it isn't the same one tonight if somebody back there would say William Branham he was a ranked Rascal see because I was born of Charles and ellebranum in their nature I was a sinner I came to the world a liar in all the habits of the world laid right in me but down in there too was another nature present C predestinated was in there by God in this same body see two Natures in there see he was it was in there it was inside of him even though he was born of Charles and Ella Branham somehow through Charles and ellebranum he received this Gene that was inside of him that was a different nature that was crying out for something different he says well I catered to one as I growed I grew it as a baby Dada first thing you know I become a liar become everything else that's a sinner because I raised up that way but down in there was a little speck of Life all the time what was it there was another William Branham see a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God the word of God that was placed in there each one of you can think of similar things see it was working there's a place in the predestinated seeds heart to receive the word what is it it's the genes of God inside you in the sermon Paradox now the genes I want to expand this a little bit as we were talking before now the genes in the father and the mother of this boy no matter how much they are converted Still Remains the flesh that's been interbred out of this boy therefore the boy has got a complex in him just like from his mother's family and they're not forgiving they'll not apologize that's where that voice stands so you see this is this is a a state of mind it's not merely an attribute of Flesh his his uh hair is red his his skin is uh really light or his skin is middle or skin is dark that comes from it's not a merely fleshly genetics that's been talking about there there is an attribute and a nature a characteristic from the parents that comes down and you see I'll visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children it's very plain and simple that it's passed on period you you have that in you now it could be excessive or it could could be or could be dominant or it could be recessive you never know but it's in there it might miss you and go to the Next Generation you see but it's there it's there and it keeps going on and it will keep going on and brother Branham says in this no matter uh no matter how much they're converted see parents converted their lives changed but yet there was something in their genetics that caused them to be unforgiving when the boy was born he wasn't born born again he was born with those same nature and attributes that his parents have and he needs to be born again to overcome that otherwise he'll continue in the same nature that his parents were born with that clear That's genetics that's that's how it works that's biblically scientific if we put it that way Hebrews 7 scripture Bears this out as well we'll read verse 5 and then we'll read nine and ten and verily they that are of the sons of Levi who receive the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their Brethren though they come out of the loins of Abraham and as I may say so say Levi also who receive tithes paid tithes in Abraham for he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him so you see you're in the genes the genetics of your father your past down you you go forward and even the positive side of this was Abraham paid ties the Melchizedek God allotted it to Levi praise the Lord if if the Lord tarries and we have grandchildren um hopefully you're going to have grandchildren soon um as she's walking in back there um you the good the good things that you've done God can allot them then to your grandchildren and they could be blessed amen isn't that wonderful so Kane derived genetics from so let's go back to the beginning let's look at this process that happened in the Garden of Eden let's let's see how this follows Cain derived his genetics from The Serpent and Eve right so he had there's a little bit of his father The Serpent and a little bit of his mother Eve produced Cain Eve could be deceived because she was a byproduct of Adam right brother Branham we just read this the jeans and the father and the mother of this boy Remains the flesh that's been been innerbred out to this boy so genes of the father and the mother go into the child it's not just the genes of the father both father and mother so then we have Abel and Seth who are they they have the genes of Adam and Eve so if Eve could be deceived then so could Seth right because she's passing on that genetics to him he can be deceived and brother Branham says this that the sons of God were deceived Genesis 6 2 that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were Fair and they took them wives of all which they chose now this is a huge uh point that people try to make that they say that the Elohim and and the daughters of men got together so they they think the Angels came down and produced children but we we see Jesus himself directly contradicting this scene that's not possible saying in the resurrection will be like the angels of heaven and we won't have children okay so how is this how does that become possible we we can't bring it that way we see that God is making a distinction between two seedlines which he did from the very beginning right there in Genesis chapter four and five he he spoke of the two different seed lines then we go to Genesis 6 and now we're talking about angels coming down and let's go a little bit further you have trouble with serpent seed that the devil came and incarnated a beast of the field that looked like man reason like man taught like man you have trouble with that idea but then you go to Genesis 6 and say Angels came down and had sex with with women and produce the Nephilim so you got it all flipped around you you if you see that in the beginning you'd have it right where the serpent got together with Eve and produced Cain here we see two seed lines the whole this whole thing is talking to us about seed lines if you read Genesis Genesis 4 and Genesis 5 you have Genesis 4 showing us what Keynes line worldly evil angry polygamous Etc then you have Genesis 5 they began to call in the name of the Lord they were humble simple one of them gets raptured up because he's walking so close with God God takes him and so you see that seed line now you're going to Genesis 6 and we're talking about angels come on it's not difficult to understand Adam was a son of God what were his children then sons of God so the sons of God that's uh that's uh Seth's line comes together with Cain's line and they took wives and they produced a hybrid brother Branham says in the God of this evil age notice the sons of God saw the daughters of men not Daughters of God the daughters of men that they were beautiful and it caused the sons of God to fall into this delusion so they were deluded they were deceived because they had the attributes of their mother she could be deceived pass it on to the children we can all be deceived right any of you here that can't be deceived somehow well the elect won't be deceived amen but you got to have a you gotta add something foreign to us something outside of us a different life the baptism of the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Soul then we have the ingredients to never be deceived doesn't mean we don't make mistakes don't doesn't mean we don't go into error But ultimately when the word the true word is manifested we say Amen to it because there's something in our hearts that that can receive it spoken word is the Original Seed then except a man be born again why must he be born again he's dead with the flesh he's in he's a hybrid he's got to be born again why he was born in Sin from Eve's sin shaped an iniquity come to the world speaking lies so we see that we're all hybrid where were we hybrid at we were hybrid in Genesis chapter 6. the whole human race and we see that this just by the nature of the sons of Noah you see that it is a fact we're all hybrid they had some sons that were Godly some sons that were ungodly but what did they produce what did their entire what did they produce they and their wives a world of evil they went straight to Babel and only a few stood and resisted against that evil so we're all in this condition of hybrid and as I said before that is not merely talking about your flesh it's your it's your body it's your spirit it's your soul all three parts come genetically from your parents and so this hybridization that we can get in our soul spiritual aspect of us that's passing down from our parents so it's a mixed race a hybrid race I want to skip over that last part that I have in there but this whole this whole serpent seed nature is there in you and me that's where that evil nature comes from that's where that Fallen nature comes from if the serpent seed would have been slid to the side and there would never have been any hybridization that took place within the human race we would all be born subject to be deceived subject to sin right but yet we would have all had that nature to recognize when the word of God was manifested all of us because that that that breeding would have went to the side but it didn't it was all mixed and hybrid and that's what we have today is a mixed hybrid human race and we see right there in John 8 37. I know that you are Abraham's Sperma seed but you seek to kill me because my word has no place in you Jesus acknowledges physically speaking you come from Abraham physically spiritually speaking both of them you come from Abraham because my word has but you seek to kill me because my word has no place in you they answered and said unto him Abraham is our father Jesus saith unto him if you're Abraham's children now he uses a different word if you were Abraham's tecton sons a relationship with a bond in other words if you had Abraham's nature in you you would do the works of Abraham but you're of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there's no truth in him when he speaks a lie he speaks of his own for he is a liar and the father of it so in the midst of Israel you have Abraham's seed who are of the devil and then you have Abraham's seed who are also his sons his technon and they have a place in them for the word right there right there we understand it's a hybrid race it's a genetically mixed race by the way there's only one race if you didn't know that already it's the human race calling all kinds of this race and this color race and this call that's human invention that has nothing to do with the word of God look it up what brother Madam says there's one race so let's let's look at this I'm really short on time but I feel like it I would have to re-preach everything I just said in order to get to this point so from genome.gov you can look at dominant and recessive genes so dominant refers the to the relationship between two versions of a gene individuals receive two versions of each gene known as I don't know how to say this and I don't know the details alleles from each parent if the alleles of a gene are different one allele will be expressed it's the dominant gene the effect of the other allele called recessive is Mast so I think if you are spiritual and you're reading this you could see what I was just saying right in the same family from the same mom and dad you have Esau and Jacob right one has a dominant gene of the genes of God one has a recessive gene there then you go on go on go on and guess what there's predestinated seed from Esau's line that recognize and receive the word of God today so how is that possible because it's past it continues to be passed on in a it's either dominant or it's recessive foreign says in the literal discharge of the male there's somewhat a million germs come forth from the male at each time and from a million eggs comes from the female at the same time but did you know in all of them little germs moving around a million of them there's only one of them ordained to life and there's only one egg fertile and that little germ will crawl right up through every one of them other little germs right over the top of every little germ looking just like him and come over the top of that and come over here and find that fertile egg and crawl into it and then all of the rest of them die why talk about a virgin birth oh it's not half as mysterious as a physical birth how it's foreordained predestinated by God it's it's incredible what brother Branham said he's saying that a child being born the very sperm that's supposed to fertilize the egg is predestinated by God so you see the depths of that because all the genes genetics is affected by that process now in the beginning way back way years ago before there was a time began you if you're a born-again Christian tonight you were in God then your father that's why when you come into this life here and profess Christianity well everything going wrong you've wondered why this is and all this it you you wondered at it but one day something struck you what was it the life that was down in there from the beginning like my little story about the eagle finding it everyone's very familiar with this but I it's important to understand in the context it's mother finding the eagle you've heard me preach on that how that little Eagle was hatched under a hen but she her habits of trying to feed them them chickens the little Eagle couldn't stomach it because he wasn't a chicken to begin with yet he was in the pen with the chickens and followed the chicken but she would scratch in the barnyard and things and the little Eagle couldn't stand it but every time she would cluck in everything all the little chickens go so he would go too but one day his mother knew that she had laid two eggs not one there had to be another one somewhere she went to hunt it flying around circling finally she come over the Barnyard and she found her baby and she screamed to him it was a voice that he realized that that's the thing that fit that was what he's looking for see he he realized then that he wasn't a chicken he was an eagle and that that eagle can be born under any and let's expand it what we're talking about an eagle can be born in any family anywhere any place on this earth right now any color skin any religion any place and it's our duty to go find it how can that be brother Jason you just we just explained that sometimes it's dominant sometimes it's recessive it can be recessive for Generations upon Generations upon Generations all of a sudden it's active why do you think that all of a sudden all these Gentiles are being saved and they weren't saved before where did that how did that come from did they somehow just get Jewish blood in them it has nothing to do with it it's there it's there from the very from the very from the flood going on I'm gonna skip this one and uh just got a few more minutes I'm going to take every ounce of my allotted time from the spoken word is the original season now notice now in this God foresaw and predestinated a world of sons and daughters he predestinated them to be there and because of high breeding disbelieving God's word caused the high breeding God has put it right back again that you don't have to be hybrid anymore you can come right back to the original word and be a Son of God just like you were supposed to be at the beginning Christ couldn't help being what he was he was the son of God that's it see what I mean now see if you were intended you see the word of God you believe it because why there's something new see why have you ever heard of a strain in a family one a son will kind of impersonate his father or the mother or the grandfather grandmother that strain in the family you've heard of it haven't you well that's the same thing from predestination see what brother branham's trying to say there's a strain in the family there's something being passed down in the genetics of the human race and all of a sudden it comes and you're you you can recognize the word well I'll let him finish well that's the same thing from predestination you were supposed to be here in the right way at the beginning so what does that mean he's referring back to if there had never been a fall you to come forth by the spoken word through Adam and Eve and and you would have you would that the whole family of God would have been here but instead it was hybrid and we have a huge population and in there one here and one there is predestinated by God to come forth but you were supposed to come forth in the beginning predestinated you hear the word it brings you right back to where you were predestinated amen never saw that before it brings you right what makes you believe the word of God and turn down these other things it's because you were there something in you way back Yonder What You're Made to live here forever amen all right so in closing down to the very sperm and egg level your genetics are predetermined so DNA is the sum total of the DNA of all of your mothers and fathers and sisters then this is passed from the Garden of Eden all the way to us today but due to the mixing of the two lines all are born in a hybrid condition some are born with the genetics of God dominant and within their spiritual DNA and some are born with it in a res in as recessive but the new birth is what quickens that spear
