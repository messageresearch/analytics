[28:33] offering and the prayer requests brother
[28:35] Branham said that
[28:37] amen no service is complete without an
[28:40] offering so we're gonna take it up I got
[28:43] to thinking about that it was at first
[28:45] last service I did it it was just out of
[28:48] kind of what I was like normal and then
[28:52] I thought about what brother branham did
[28:54] say no service is complete without it so
[28:57] we want to do that amen
[29:00] got a couple prayer requests here and
[29:03] you can play some softly sister Deborah
[29:06] the next song that was on that list
[29:09] a man a couple prayer requests yesterday
[29:15] I neither was on Facebook chatting of
[29:19] our four old friends and it finds out we
[29:23] found out that a friend of ours from
[29:25] brother vales church brother Li vales
[29:27] Church when we were attending services

[29:37] she's on life support and she's fighting
[29:40] this kovat 19 she's fighting for her
[29:43] life amen
[29:45] so it just goes to show my brother Matt
[29:49] has said I know he said it in the past
[29:52] on it just because we have the Holy
[29:56] Ghost it doesn't make us exempt from
[29:58] attacks from the devil so we would like
[30:01] you to pray for this sister her name's
[30:03] Angela white even after today if you
[30:06] want to just write it down amen and
[30:09] remember her in your prayers or the week

[41:27] the sister Deb we're happy to have you
[41:29] all here again amen helping us make the
[41:33] service possible across the stream amen
[41:37] it wouldn't be possible without the help
[41:40] of all of these various teams and so we
[41:43] sure are grateful for them all praise
[41:47] the Lord we're going to turn to Isaiah
[41:49] 53 this morning amen and what I'm going
[41:54] to do brother George you got the the
[41:56] third video I'm going to show again
[41:57] right so I'm going to probably show that
[41:59] right after we read the text will it the
[42:03] pray and be seated then we'll start it
[42:05] right then because I want to from where
[42:08] I left off Wednesday and so I want to go
[42:12] to that last video that we showed
[42:14] Wednesday because it's going to be
[42:16] significant
[42:19] paramount even for carrying on in this
[42:23] thought today I want to speak to you on
[42:25] the arm of the Lord the arm of the Lord
[42:30] Isaiah chapter 53 and a single verse
[42:34] verse 1 Isaiah speaking here concerning
[42:37] Christ who hath believed our report and
[42:42] to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed
[42:47] one more time who hath believed our
[42:50] report and to whom is the arm of the
[42:55] Lord revealed now it's both a question
[43:00] and but it's a little bit rhetorical
[43:04] because it implies that that somebody
[43:07] believed it and the arm of the Lord was
[43:10] revealed so amen let's let's pray father
[43:17] we thank you this morning
[43:19] for your word which is open before me
[43:22] and Lord Jesus anyone as brother Brandon
[43:26] would so often say anyone with human
[43:29] ability can open the pages of this book
[43:32] anyone Lord with a Grammar School
[43:34] education can read the words of this
[43:38] book Lord you don't even need to have
[43:40] eyesight they for blind people they have
[43:43] a language and Bibles written in Braille
[43:45] that you can read from there's so many
[43:48] ways you can hear it read for you you
[43:51] don't even have to read it you can push
[43:54] a button on a device and an artificial
[43:56] voice will read it for you Lord there's
[43:59] many ways that we can read and hear
[44:03] these words but as brother Branham
[44:05] always pointed humanity to this fact
[44:09] that it takes God to open our
[44:12] understanding so Lord this morning we
[44:16] are helpless without you this morning
[44:18] though we can open the book though we
[44:20] can read its words we can't know its
[44:23] depth of meaning unless you reveal it we
[44:27] learned Lord in last service that that
[44:30] you are you reveal your word to people
[44:33] and that Lord in and that that there's
[44:37] no way that anyone can see it unless you
[44:41] reveal it so master this morning we look
[44:44] to you as children unable Lord to feed
[44:48] ourselves we look to you to do it master
[44:51] help us father all across the airwaves
[44:54] now and in this sanctuary and Lord
[44:57] chiefly with me who stands here now Lord
[45:00] at the post of duty Lord I would be all
[45:03] together undone if it weren't for you so
[45:06] I'm surrendering myself to you we're all
[45:09] surrendering our hearts we're humbling
[45:11] ourselves and we humble ourselves again
[45:14] in your presence now make it known Lord
[45:17] it's important these are serious times
[45:19] and we need to see Lord clearly your
[45:23] movements in the world we need to know
[45:26] what is your perfect will for us in this
[45:28] hour I pray that you give everyone Lord
[45:31] here
[45:32] in the building today attentive hearts
[45:34] and ready minds give everyone sitting in
[45:37] their homes for them it'll be especially
[45:38] needful because the home environment
[45:41] produces a relaxing atmosphere and lord
[45:45] I pray that you will quicken everyone
[45:47] sitting now Lord listening and standing
[45:50] or and will be sitting to hear the Word
[45:53] of God I pray you granite now give us
[45:56] hearing hearts today above all things
[45:58] give us a will to do thy word granite
[46:01] master we confess our selves now
[46:05] dependent on you completely in Jesus
[46:08] name Amen god bless you as you're seated
[46:12] amen we have read this verse who hath
[46:16] believed our report and to whom is the
[46:19] arm of the Lord revealed now I want to
[46:22] show again that that last third video
[46:26] concerning how they build vaccines amen
[46:38] if we don't get it it's when I did my
[46:41] graduates No if we don't get it it's not
[46:44] critical because we've saw it already
[46:45] and I can refer to it and I'm sure
[46:48] everyone will remember so we'll give you
[46:50] just a minute here by the Georges human
[46:52] viruses are highly adapted to growing in
[46:54] human cells these viruses reproduce
[46:58] thousands of times in human cells
[47:00] gaining access using specific receptors
[47:04] that match molecules on cell surface
[47:06] receptors that match molecules on cell
[47:08] surfaces like athletes they get stronger
[47:11] and stronger by collectively training
[47:14] under the same conditions by continually
[47:16] training under the same and yet it's
[47:18] this very strength that makes it
[47:20] possible to weaken it's this very
[47:22] strength that makes it process leading
[47:24] is the key to making live acces vaccines
[47:27] how do scientists make this kind of
[47:30] axiom to scientists by forcing the virus
[47:32] to grow and regenerate lines of cells
[47:35] kinds of cells in the lab in these chick
[47:39] embryo cells most of the virus particles
[47:41] that were so good at the rare
[47:43] occurrences that exists the chickens
[47:45] can't access the chick cell with sheer
[47:48] numbers on their side but with virus
[47:51] particles are able to unlock the chair
[47:53] articles are able to unlock the chick
[47:55] cell and begin adapt into this new
[47:56] environment begin adapting to this new
[47:58] environment the virus adapts by
[48:01] modifying its Jesus but there's a price
[48:04] to pay as the virus gets better and
[48:07] better at growing in the chick cells it
[48:10] gets worse and worse at growing in our
[48:12] cells
[48:14] now when reintroduced to the human body
[48:17] as a vaccine these modified or weakened
[48:21] viruses have a hard time infecting human
[48:23] cells the virus multiplies less
[48:27] efficiently giving the immune system the
[48:30] time it needs to gather information
[48:31] about the virus and mount an antibody
[48:34] response the vaccine provides immunity
[48:38] to natural infection without making us
[48:41] pay the price of natural infection to
[48:51] relish its lessons and you know I I want
[48:57] to bring it in to the context of where
[49:00] we are today
[49:02] now we certainly it is not lost on us
[49:07] any here today in the building or over
[49:12] the airwaves that we are in a national
[49:15] crisis in fact is a pandemic represents
[49:18] a global crisis and I'm not here really
[49:22] to to you know just preach on you know
[49:26] the fears and and everything and there's
[49:29] all kinds of science and statistics we
[49:31] could give you today that would be
[49:34] perfectly fine it's just not my intent
[49:36] here today we I what I want to focus on
[49:42] is what does it mean to us in the word
[49:47] what because we know that brother
[49:51] branham has showed us time after time in
[49:54] numerous places that when when something
[49:58] climactic are serious is happening in
[50:03] the earth that it's a sign that
[50:06] something is happening in heaven now
[50:09] that's an important point just know this
[50:12] friends as we've said before you know I
[50:14] I don't know even what will be reported
[50:18] in the news tomorrow whatever this
[50:21] becomes in the next coming weeks they're
[50:24] showing certain things in China now
[50:26] where they're starting to get back to
[50:29] business as usual but then some people
[50:31] are saying there's going to be a second
[50:33] wave you know there are so many people
[50:35] saying so many things I just I just want
[50:38] to say that I'm just gonna worry about
[50:40] what he has to say that I'm safe in the
[50:43] CLEF of the rod now whatever happens to
[50:47] my body that's it's really not important
[50:50] jesus said that we're not even to fear
[50:52] that which destroys the body
[50:54] whatever happens in our body be it today
[50:57] tomorrow next week or next month we have
[51:00] access to Jehovah Rapha
[51:02] and that really ought to assuage all of
[51:06] our fears friends it really ought to put
[51:08] us at rest to say come what may these
[51:12] things if you want to call them
[51:13] pre-tribulation whatever you want to
[51:15] call them if you want to call if you
[51:16] want to use the word plague fine use the
[51:18] word plague all I know is that I'm I'm
[51:22] covered in feathers today hallelujah I'm
[51:25] under the wings of the great Jehovah
[51:27] eagle and so we realize friends listen
[51:31] when God promised Israel to when brought
[51:35] when God promised that Jerusalem would
[51:38] be restored and you can find this in
[51:41] prophecies through Ezekiel different
[51:44] places where he talks about the
[51:46] rebuilding the city and he actually is
[51:50] very specific on markers and it's going
[51:52] to go from this ancient marker which the
[51:54] Jews would understand and it's going to
[51:57] go after this because it had been Zack
[51:59] so many times
[52:00] it had been sacked by the babylonians it
[52:02] had been it had been sacked by the
[52:04] Romans in it you know uh
[52:06] all of these things that we find but you
[52:09] know Jesus I mean the Bible promising
[52:12] Israel that someday I'm going to rebuild
[52:15] it and it'll last forever and it'll
[52:17] never be raised again it'll never be
[52:20] sacked again it'll never be invaded by
[52:23] sin again in him it'll never be invaded
[52:26] by sin again and when and he one of the
[52:29] things that he promised them is that one
[52:32] of the corners would go over I forget
[52:34] the name of the Hebrew Valley but it was
[52:36] literally where they you know oftentimes
[52:40] the the dead were there the the the the
[52:44] waste of the land was there it was a it
[52:47] was a junkyard of of dead human remains
[52:50] and human waste and and every kind of
[52:54] debauchery and and he was saying to them
[52:56] one of the corners is going to go right
[52:59] over that Valley it doesn't matter what
[53:02] has happened in our lives
[53:03] whatever kind of death our defilement
[53:06] we've ever had I'm here to tell you God
[53:08] is erecting a new City over all my life
[53:12] hallelujah and I'm promised that I'm
[53:14] going to be lifted up into that city so
[53:19] it is a wonderful promise today I choose
[53:24] to think in those terms because first of
[53:27] all Paul says that to the Thessalonians
[53:30] in his letters to them how that he's
[53:32] reminding them they're not of the
[53:34] darkness there over the daytime they're
[53:36] not children of the night who are drunk
[53:38] in the night there are children over the
[53:40] day and so he says let us be sober in
[53:43] the day and he comes down and and every
[53:46] time or many times when Paul begins this
[53:49] this segregation between God's family
[53:53] and everybody else he where the weather
[53:57] he's talking about predestination
[53:59] positioning of the believers election
[54:01] God's position of the bride its position
[54:05] in Christ he often reminds us to
[54:08] encourage one another in these things so
[54:11] let me tell you today
[54:13] I'm not here to make you feel sad and
[54:15] say oh there's a global pandemic hey
[54:17] there is but guess what you're caught of
[54:20] God your chosen you're elected you're a
[54:22] peculiar people so we can lift up our
[54:26] head and rejoice today we find that
[54:31] whatever we see happening and I I made
[54:34] this statement before that it's it's at
[54:36] the very least a harbinger of transition
[54:38] because it's either it's either in
[54:41] coming weeks and months it's going to
[54:44] continue to get worse and worse and
[54:46] worse until I don't know maybe it'll
[54:48] spiral so bad that God will have to
[54:50] sweep in and rescue us in a rapture
[54:52] wouldn't that be amazing friends oh you
[54:56] can have this world I'll take the next
[54:59] one you can have this whole world just
[55:01] give me Jesus that's all I care about
[55:03] and I tell you God has a way to get us
[55:06] to only care about that and I just say
[55:09] Lord whatever it takes to get me to care
[55:11] about the word then whatever it takes
[55:13] because that's what i want to singularly
[55:16] focus on today because everything else
[55:19] will become ash and cinder i'm here to
[55:21] taste something friends this world that
[55:23] you pursue I don't care how lively and
[55:26] actively you pursue it I don't care what
[55:27] you accomplish everything you achieve in
[55:30] this world is going to ash and cinder
[55:33] and the only thing that will last is
[55:35] those things that are eternal which
[55:37] cannot pass away they were here before
[55:40] the tribulation and they'll be here
[55:43] after the tribulation so whether or not
[55:47] it spirals on down and this is the this
[55:51] is the beginning of the end of of our
[55:54] 2000 year journey of the Gentile church
[55:57] would to God it were so but even if it's
[56:00] not and if in weeks and months things
[56:02] seem to get back to somewhat normalcy
[56:05] I'm here to tell you something friends
[56:06] that's the psychology the subconscious
[56:10] of the world has been shocked and I
[56:13] don't think from this point on even if
[56:15] things go back to kind of normal I don't
[56:17] think that's ever going to be undone I
[56:19] think that mankind now
[56:21] has turned the corner I think that he's
[56:24] he's on just like us he's on his final
[56:26] stretch to his in and we're on our final
[56:29] stretch to her beginning hallelujah
[56:33] oh my can't come soon enough and and I
[56:37] know that even if things were to
[56:39] normalize to a degree they'll never go
[56:41] back I'm here to tell you the life
[56:43] though of the world that we had before
[56:45] this global scare and pandemic you'll
[56:48] never go back to that again because the
[56:51] world can't get better it must get worse
[56:53] and worse and worse Oh hallelujah so
[56:57] regardless of what it if it seems to
[57:00] improve I know this that this would only
[57:03] be the beginning of more coming and as I
[57:06] said get past this one and break the
[57:08] government and give away trillions of
[57:10] dollars fine I'm happy glad that
[57:12] everybody's gonna get some help but what
[57:14] are you going to do with the next five
[57:16] that come and the next ten after that
[57:18] I'm here to tell you there's not enough
[57:20] gold in all the world to hold mankind on
[57:23] his feet oh there's only one way that
[57:27] man can be saved and that's in the arms
[57:30] of Jehovah God hallelujah we know that
[57:35] what's happening listen friends I had a
[57:38] a very good friend of mine a minister
[57:40] pastor who we all know well you know he
[57:42] just sent me a message yesterday and
[57:44] just a single short question could this
[57:47] be the third pool very stewed brother
[57:51] one of my mentors and I and I and I
[57:55] wrote back to this is say some of the
[57:57] things I've said to you here I said you
[57:59] know it I can say this you know that
[58:03] that there has never been such an all
[58:07] collective I there's been times there's
[58:10] been national listen there's been wars
[58:11] and rumors of wars since the early days
[58:14] of the church we understand that there's
[58:16] been perilous times but we also know
[58:19] that the Bible talks about a
[58:22] multiplication of that that it's uh that
[58:25] it's an increase that it can't hardly
[58:28] even be kept abreast of that that once
[58:31] the world's knowledge increases and it
[58:34] keeps heating off of that tree rapidly
[58:36] his heart starts failing for fear
[58:38] mission starts rising its nation and now
[58:40] now you're starting to see everything
[58:43] that has ever been times a thousand and
[58:45] so we realized that it and I said look
[58:48] here's what we know this thing can't
[58:51] just keep going on and on and on and on
[58:54] there were only seven ages and there
[58:57] aren't anymore ages God only had seven
[59:00] stars in his right hand and they've all
[59:02] been spent hallelujah
[59:06] what do you think it's just gonna keep
[59:08] going and keep going and keep going it's
[59:11] impossible to just keep going and I said
[59:16] you know it seems that that I have never
[59:18] seen such out cumulative collection of
[59:22] events and transitions in the world like
[59:24] we are seeing today brother Branham when
[59:29] he's making reference in what thinking
[59:32] of Christ to when when threat strikes
[59:37] his children because remember friends
[59:39] and this is very clear in the scripture
[59:41] our squeeze is not a tribulation time
[59:46] squeeze
[59:47] that's not our squeeze our squeeze is an
[59:51] ecumenical squeeze and we don't even
[59:54] know you know you know there's a lot of
[59:56] things in play I mean I don't think that
[1:00:00] you can at least take a partial
[1:00:03] connection to brother branham standing
[1:00:05] in pulpits and saying listen friends you
[1:00:09] won't always be able to meet like this I
[1:00:11] won't always be your pastor won't always
[1:00:14] there's gonna come a time where we're
[1:00:16] gonna long for these days that we can
[1:00:18] gather together now listen friends we
[1:00:22] might end up gathering back together I
[1:00:23] don't know you don't know we might not I
[1:00:26] know we're not now we're under a mandate
[1:00:29] and even actually where we're violating
[1:00:31] the the requests of the governors to not
[1:00:35] be more than two people I'm glad he left
[1:00:38] it at least two because we're even two
[1:00:40] or three
[1:00:40] gathered crisis in the myths but here we
[1:00:43] are 10 today which is several times over
[1:00:46] what they're asking us to do and we're
[1:00:48] trying to follow all of the protocols a
[1:00:50] very weird time and I'm not here to be
[1:00:55] an alarmist but I am here to remind you
[1:00:57] that G the Prophet said these things
[1:01:00] would come and I don't know it I'm not
[1:01:02] trying to say I know what tomorrow holds
[1:01:05] or what next week or a few months holds
[1:01:07] but I'm here to take something friends
[1:01:09] I'm lifting up my head because I see
[1:01:11] these things as something that is
[1:01:13] actively moving towards that day that I
[1:01:17] have waited for all my life since I was
[1:01:20] a little boy and I said it my mother's
[1:01:23] knee and heard the stories of Jesus and
[1:01:25] heard about heaven and heard about that
[1:01:28] land and I've looked to the eastern
[1:01:30] skies all my life is this the hour what
[1:01:36] might be ahead of us just shortly and as
[1:01:39] I said even if we transition back to
[1:01:42] somewhat
[1:01:43] some semblance of normalcy what are you
[1:01:46] gonna do when playing upon plague it's
[1:01:49] like that brother
[1:01:50] I read his quote from Africa said
[1:01:52] welcome to a dress rehearsal not here to
[1:01:57] be afraid of that I am not the least bit
[1:01:59] afraid of it I said to the Lord last
[1:02:02] night I said Lord if I don't even
[1:02:05] doesn't even matter if the if the
[1:02:07] economy would collapse and we would all
[1:02:09] get down to just how come it may be
[1:02:13] communism as in the book of Acts not the
[1:02:16] man-made devil kind but in the bulk of
[1:02:19] book of Acts when they had all things in
[1:02:20] common I don't know will we return to
[1:02:23] that I don't know but I know this it
[1:02:26] won't matter I gotta tell your friends
[1:02:29] if we all end up in a tent city out in
[1:02:31] the woods we're still gonna be believing
[1:02:33] God oh I don't know I'm not trying to be
[1:02:36] an alarmist today that's the furthest
[1:02:39] thing from my mind
[1:02:41] but I want us at the same time to be
[1:02:44] aware as we said with to be on set of
[1:02:49] this and I said to you as a church take
[1:02:52] this time
[1:02:53] take this time when you can't a symbol
[1:02:56] take this time to gather with your
[1:02:58] families take this time to draw closer
[1:03:01] take this time to read more pray more
[1:03:04] study more talk to God more adjust
[1:03:07] things in your life
[1:03:09] don't don't don't let this time where
[1:03:11] God is obviously doing something in
[1:03:14] heaven and you miss out on all the
[1:03:19] benefits that you could have from it I
[1:03:22] know this I want I I said to the brother
[1:03:27] I said I know this friend I said to me I
[1:03:34] see a paradox and it's paradoxical to me
[1:03:38] because it is in such contra distinction
[1:03:42] as to be paradoxical I'm not talking
[1:03:45] about mere contrast I mean absolute
[1:03:47] contra distinction polar opposites at
[1:03:51] the very least where I have never in all
[1:03:56] my days seen such a conglomeration
[1:04:02] accumulative organised or highly
[1:04:06] organised forces of spiritual darkness
[1:04:11] coming against God's family trying to
[1:04:15] wreck homes and wreck children and wreck
[1:04:18] marriages and tear down the spirituality
[1:04:20] of God's people while at the exact same
[1:04:24] time I seek God's people with a greater
[1:04:27] thirst and a hunger and a zeal and a
[1:04:30] sincerity for spiritual righteousness
[1:04:34] and overcoming power I'm here to tell
[1:04:37] you those are so opposite and when the
[1:04:39] devil has reached his zenith and he's
[1:04:41] got all 16 cylinders running and this
[1:04:44] he's got pedal to the metal and yet a
[1:04:46] bride seems to be immune from it and she
[1:04:49] keeps rising higher and the harder he
[1:04:52] pushes the higher we go explain that you
[1:04:59] can't
[1:05:00] it's super natural it's not natural
[1:05:05] natural would be see the devil expects a
[1:05:10] natural response because we're natural
[1:05:12] people but his in his equation he
[1:05:15] doesn't count for the supernatural
[1:05:18] element so we real our the supernatural
[1:05:21] element so we realized that you know the
[1:05:25] question always comes does the enemy
[1:05:26] really think he's going to win the devil
[1:05:31] keeps pressing even though God has
[1:05:33] prophesied his destruction God has never
[1:05:36] been wrong Lucifer knows he's never been
[1:05:40] wrong God has already told Lucifer his
[1:05:43] in that's why he hates the book of
[1:05:44] Revelation hates Genesis because it
[1:05:47] exposes his deceptive start
[1:05:49] he hates revelation because it speaks
[1:05:52] definitively and I'm here to tell you
[1:05:54] the book of Revelation does not mince
[1:05:58] words it doesn't care anything about
[1:06:01] political correctness it literally tells
[1:06:04] everybody that are sinners you are going
[1:06:07] to burn in a lake of fire and that is
[1:06:10] unquenchable it tells about people who
[1:06:12] are going to be judged people who think
[1:06:14] God won't judge them you better read the
[1:06:17] book of Revelation it doesn't snot Gates
[1:06:20] doesn't care about political correctness
[1:06:21] it doesn't care about you know you know
[1:06:24] positive reinforcement it gives you a
[1:06:26] clear choice like God did to Israel when
[1:06:29] he had part of the priesthood stand
[1:06:32] stand on evil and part of them stand on
[1:06:34] ger ISM and the people had to walk in
[1:06:36] the valley between the two mountain
[1:06:38] peaks and these priests would shout down
[1:06:41] blessings purveying the Word of God and
[1:06:43] these priests would shout down cursings
[1:06:46] for disobeying and the people had to
[1:06:47] walk and listen to both sides of that
[1:06:49] and make up their mind I'm here to tell
[1:06:51] you that's returned and you need to make
[1:06:53] up your mind because the word isn't
[1:06:56] joking the world is coming to a complete
[1:06:59] end and God is going to wipe it clean of
[1:07:05] all evil and he's going to reestablish
[1:07:07] his kingdom right back here on earth God
[1:07:11] doesn't need to build a new plan
[1:07:13] he's taking back the one he built
[1:07:17] hallelujah it's full of trespassers and
[1:07:21] squatters and he's taking it back and
[1:07:25] he's going to put every person back in
[1:07:27] their brightly position so when we see
[1:07:32] things happening in the earth that are
[1:07:35] climactic - God's family brother branham
[1:07:38] comes to the to the three Hebrew
[1:07:41] children and he says what thinking of
[1:07:45] Christ and and he talks about now here
[1:07:48] when he got right up to the edge where
[1:07:51] they was - where they was to jump off
[1:07:54] into the fiery furnace and there it was
[1:07:59] about the darkest hour they had ever
[1:08:02] seen
[1:08:04] he didn't you can call it the darkest it
[1:08:07] was about the darkest they'd ever seen
[1:08:09] I'm here to tell you something friends I
[1:08:11] don't know if you're seeing the darkest
[1:08:12] hour but it's sure the darkest we've
[1:08:13] ever seen that is anybody in common
[1:08:18] sense would have to say that it's
[1:08:19] certainly the darkest hour we've ever
[1:08:21] seen and he says coming up to this fiery
[1:08:27] furnace furnace and just about the time
[1:08:32] they got ready to step in notice notice
[1:08:36] these loose words not not when they
[1:08:40] stepped on the buzzer it was as he says
[1:08:43] just about the time he didn't have to be
[1:08:47] stepping on the buzzer just about the
[1:08:50] time they got ready just about the time
[1:08:55] they got ready I'm here to tell you I
[1:08:58] think we're in just about the time and
[1:09:00] we're getting ready just about the time
[1:09:05] they got ready to step in brother
[1:09:08] Branham says let's turn our cameras I'm
[1:09:10] so thankful to brother Dale called me
[1:09:12] yesterday reminded me of this quote
[1:09:14] about shouted he says let's turn our
[1:09:17] cameras this morning and look up yonder
[1:09:20] in heaven break out of this dimension
[1:09:24] and look up yonder when things look so
[1:09:27] dreary here
[1:09:29] there's always something pointing on in
[1:09:32] another world I'm here to tell you
[1:09:36] something friends we're we're there we
[1:09:39] have arrived at the darkest hour we've
[1:09:41] ever seen we're just about ready to step
[1:09:44] into something we're getting just about
[1:09:47] ready to step in so let me say to you
[1:09:50] today
[1:09:50] don't worry about what's happening out
[1:09:52] here turn your cameras turn your cameras
[1:09:55] if this is happening here wow there must
[1:09:58] be something happening up there I'm here
[1:10:01] to tell you you can rest on that today I
[1:10:04] don't know what's happening all here but
[1:10:07] I know it's something's happening up
[1:10:09] there God is getting ready there's too
[1:10:12] many prophecies prophet left us with too
[1:10:15] many things that we know are coming and
[1:10:17] to be fulfilled in this brain and I just
[1:10:20] say Lord bring it upon my life now I so
[1:10:25] desire it whatever I got a surrender
[1:10:27] this ought to be an hour of surrender
[1:10:30] let me say it again this ought to be an
[1:10:32] hour of surrender not getting more stuff
[1:10:35] it's time to unpack well you you can't
[1:10:38] go up because you got too much weight as
[1:10:40] Paul said throw aside the weights and
[1:10:43] sins that beset us if that was ever true
[1:10:47] it's now that's the hour we've come to
[1:10:53] now as a number of things that would
[1:10:55] naturally come to our mind our
[1:10:59] worthiness it's not the least that
[1:11:04] should be on our mind our because it's
[1:11:08] going to take faith and you know it's
[1:11:12] just like when you are trying to believe
[1:11:17] for divine healing what does the devil
[1:11:22] attack your faith with symptoms and the
[1:11:26] real they're not figments of your
[1:11:29] imagination they're not metaphors
[1:11:31] they're not lost stories Satan comes at
[1:11:35] you with physical
[1:11:36] palpably real symptoms pain nausea fever
[1:11:43] weakness and and then you know and then
[1:11:46] these things then then he uses he goes
[1:11:49] through those physical realms to
[1:11:51] suddenly start afflicting your mind and
[1:11:53] then suddenly your imagination starts
[1:11:56] getting involved and then suddenly you
[1:11:58] know you're because you're got a
[1:11:59] conscience and then you got a memory and
[1:12:01] he reaches over here and plugs it into a
[1:12:03] memory and way you know how somebody
[1:12:05] then your family and then he lights up
[1:12:07] imagination hey that could be you too
[1:12:09] you know he's all working on your body
[1:12:12] that's not redeemed yet he has he has
[1:12:17] all of these powers to to afflict that
[1:12:21] soul quite naturally then he just runs
[1:12:24] the same playbook on a different in a
[1:12:26] different way that when we when we began
[1:12:29] to say you know because what is he
[1:12:31] trying to get you to deny in healing
[1:12:34] that by his stripes I'm healed he's
[1:12:37] trying to get something in the word to
[1:12:39] be doubted by you and and I can tell you
[1:12:43] a much greater word then by his stripes
[1:12:45] are healed because that's just for your
[1:12:47] physical body of course divine healing
[1:12:50] in the soul is a much much greater thing
[1:12:52] and what does he do when a man comes
[1:12:54] with a soul that's blackened by the smut
[1:12:57] of sin he tells that man you can never
[1:12:59] get free you can never find your way out
[1:13:01] you're a hopeless case what is he doing
[1:13:04] bombing the mind and the man is aware
[1:13:06] and the woman is aware that they really
[1:13:09] are they in that condition but if God
[1:13:11] can just get his word down inside there
[1:13:14] until that man or that woman can look up
[1:13:16] and say but yet God lives and I'm going
[1:13:19] to believe his word and it can literally
[1:13:21] transform that soul it's this exact same
[1:13:27] thing we talk about the third pole and
[1:13:28] we talk about the operation of the word
[1:13:30] and speaking the word we don't know I
[1:13:33] don't know will I be called to the
[1:13:38] hospital and one of our dear family
[1:13:41] members here at Bethel Tabernacle laying
[1:13:44] in a realm of unconsciousness can't even
[1:13:47] believe for themselves
[1:13:48] will I be called upon to lay a hand and
[1:13:52] speak a word like a prophets when God
[1:13:55] said when his wife had the tumor and and
[1:13:57] and he prayed and prayed and prayed and
[1:13:59] finally the Lord said now say what it'll
[1:14:02] be and he said I say that before the
[1:14:05] doctors hand can touch her God's hand
[1:14:09] will dissolve it Merritt a something
[1:14:14] friends there's something to be said
[1:14:16] about the hand of Almighty God I'm
[1:14:20] preaching to you today on the arm of the
[1:14:22] Lord what is an arm it extends a hand
[1:14:28] amen
[1:14:30] now let's move on so we read now we see
[1:14:41] how that who has believed our report and
[1:14:48] a whom is the arm of the Lord revealed
[1:14:50] watching my time closely expositors have
[1:14:57] called this chapter in Isaiah literally
[1:15:02] they call it the Holy of Holies of
[1:15:05] Isaiah it is also the middle chapter in
[1:15:09] part 2 of the book now these things
[1:15:13] aren't accidents God builds his word
[1:15:15] with meticulous care most of the
[1:15:19] approximately and there's a roughly
[1:15:21] about 80 or so references as I can
[1:15:26] uncover there's roughly 80 references to
[1:15:31] Isaiah in the New Testament all right
[1:15:36] and-and-and-and and most of those come
[1:15:41] from this chapter Isaiah 53 we could
[1:15:48] have kept reading who hath believed our
[1:15:50] report in to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:15:52] revealed for he shall grow up before him
[1:15:53] as a tender plant as a root out of dry
[1:15:55] ground he hath no form or comeliness and
[1:15:57] when we shall see him there is no beauty
[1:15:59] that we should
[1:16:00] areum he's despised and rejected of men
[1:16:02] a man of sorrows and acquainted with
[1:16:04] grief and we hid as it were our faces
[1:16:06] from him he was despised and we esteemed
[1:16:08] him not
[1:16:09] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[1:16:11] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[1:16:13] him stricken smitten of God and
[1:16:16] afflicted I love this next one but he
[1:16:19] was wounded for our transgressions he
[1:16:21] was bruised for our iniquities the
[1:16:24] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:16:27] and with His stripes we are healed all
[1:16:30] we all we should be able to all say amen
[1:16:33] to this all we like sheep have gone
[1:16:36] astray we have turned every one to his
[1:16:38] own way and the LORD hath laid on him
[1:16:41] the iniquity of us all you see when the
[1:16:45] devil comes to battle your mind that
[1:16:48] this third Pole might be here but you're
[1:16:51] not living up to the standard to operate
[1:16:53] it I'm here to tell you you might have
[1:16:55] iniquity but the Lord has laid on him
[1:16:58] the iniquity of us all when God is
[1:17:03] determined to do something you or I
[1:17:05] aren't gonna stop him all I can do is
[1:17:08] just get with the program and start
[1:17:10] walking in the vision and say whatever
[1:17:13] happened in failures that was then this
[1:17:15] is now and I'm going forward hallelujah
[1:17:19] because God chose me for this our God is
[1:17:24] the one bringing it to pass this chapter
[1:17:29] of 53 of Isaiah's in fact the most
[1:17:32] quoted or if it's not quoted it's at
[1:17:35] least alluded to throughout the entire
[1:17:39] New Testament by far Isaiah 53 various
[1:17:43] parts of it rally says that beyond
[1:17:47] question this chapter is the heart of
[1:17:50] the Hebrew prophetic writings now it's
[1:17:55] interesting because when we read who
[1:17:58] hath believed our report in to whom is
[1:18:00] the arm of the Lord revealed you know
[1:18:02] Isaiah when you begin to to read the
[1:18:06] whole context prior and after you find
[1:18:08] that Isaiah marveled at the message of
[1:18:12] the Lord
[1:18:13] it was astonishing to Isaiah what God
[1:18:17] was revealing to him ah that and and and
[1:18:22] it was basically it was basically this
[1:18:25] that that God was going to to use Israel
[1:18:30] to declare to the whole world that they
[1:18:34] were going to be a declaration they were
[1:18:37] going to be as lights to the nation this
[1:18:40] is what God total and that you you see
[1:18:44] very various times where God meant not
[1:18:48] just in Isaiah 53 various times where
[1:18:52] where he he makes that where he makes
[1:18:54] that assertion let me see if I can find
[1:18:56] a couple of references that I thought I
[1:18:58] had yeah I do right here all right just
[1:19:04] let me get right to it one second right
[1:19:07] here so he's had said and Isaiah 46 6 i
[1:19:13] the lord have called the in
[1:19:16] righteousness and will hold thine hand
[1:19:20] and keep thee and give thee for a
[1:19:24] covenant of the people for a light of
[1:19:27] the gentiles so now say well he's
[1:19:31] referring to Christ of course that God
[1:19:34] was going to give Christ as a covenant
[1:19:38] of the people for a light of the
[1:19:40] Gentiles that the people were going to
[1:19:43] be light bearers you see that you see
[1:19:46] the pattern that it's going to be God
[1:19:49] condescending or distilling into Christ
[1:19:52] the logos and then Christ promising that
[1:19:56] someday he would live inside of his
[1:19:59] family in a way that they would be
[1:20:01] lights to the whole world now you
[1:20:03] wouldn't see it in perfect fulfillment
[1:20:05] until the era of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:20:08] New Testament but yet at the same time
[1:20:10] even Israel with the law of Moses they
[1:20:13] were to live it and their lives were a
[1:20:17] lived light of the law in other words
[1:20:22] God took Israel and put them right down
[1:20:26] in the
[1:20:26] minced he brushed aside all of the
[1:20:28] inhabitants moved him away and dropped
[1:20:31] Israel and all around Israel was nothing
[1:20:34] but heathen nations who hated him
[1:20:36] and God said I'm gonna I'm gonna take
[1:20:39] you as a light and plant you right there
[1:20:42] now I want to click you on click now
[1:20:45] start emanating light to the world start
[1:20:47] showing the world I'm not going to go
[1:20:49] over here and reveal myself to these
[1:20:50] people I'm gonna reveal myself to them
[1:20:53] through you and I'm going to come down
[1:20:57] and go out of you and you are going to
[1:20:59] scatter light to the world
[1:21:01] you follow that here's another place
[1:21:06] isaiah 43:10 ye are my witnesses saith
[1:21:11] the lord and my servant whom i have
[1:21:13] chosen that you may know and believe me
[1:21:16] and understand that I am he before me
[1:21:18] there was no God form neither shall
[1:21:20] there be after me I even I am the lord
[1:21:24] and beside me there is no Savior so God
[1:21:29] is calling Isaiah you're gonna be my
[1:21:32] witness Isaiah when you go down you're
[1:21:35] going to give this word to my nation and
[1:21:38] then they're gonna be witnesses so I
[1:21:40] what I want you to see is this
[1:21:43] connectivity between here then here then
[1:21:47] here then here you can see God moving
[1:21:51] sequentially alright don't want to spend
[1:21:54] a whole lot of time on that but but but
[1:21:56] but - Isaiah this was almost
[1:22:00] unbelievable because Isaiah being a
[1:22:04] prophet knew the hearts of the people in
[1:22:09] astonishing to him first of all that
[1:22:11] even if they were perfect people that
[1:22:13] the great being who all of heaven is his
[1:22:17] throne in this earth is his footstool
[1:22:19] that David looked at and beheld the
[1:22:22] stars and said you know what is man
[1:22:24] you're even mindful of him if it blew
[1:22:28] David's mind it big blue Isaiah's mine
[1:22:30] you mean this great God has chosen
[1:22:33] little old us to be his single voice
[1:22:39] to the whole world that sounds
[1:22:45] astonishing today when we declare that
[1:22:49] the bride of Jesus Christ was sent a
[1:22:51] message to accomplish that exact same
[1:22:54] thing the world says you're a cult it's
[1:22:59] natural that then they would say that
[1:23:03] don't feel bad at them if you were
[1:23:05] outside looking in you'd have the same
[1:23:08] conclusion listen friends the only
[1:23:11] reason you see it is God rich in mercy
[1:23:14] it doesn't make sense that he would do
[1:23:17] it this way to the modern thinking but
[1:23:19] that's exactly how he did it in the Old
[1:23:21] Testament he's doing that again at the
[1:23:24] end time and you have he chosen and I
[1:23:28] say anew they had problems and and a
[1:23:31] prophet knew we had problems how Allah
[1:23:34] you think God doesn't know you got
[1:23:35] issues you think God doesn't know you
[1:23:37] got problems and weaknesses and failures
[1:23:39] you think but he did it anyway he's
[1:23:42] still declared in his word I'm gonna do
[1:23:44] this and nobody's gonna stop me it's
[1:23:50] almost unbelievable who hath believed
[1:23:53] our report and to whom now see watch
[1:23:57] it's a connection and whom is the arm of
[1:24:01] the Lord revealed so believing the
[1:24:03] report then connects you gives you
[1:24:06] access puts you up with the arm of the
[1:24:12] Lord see so the ones who believe the
[1:24:17] report so he's saying I'm giving you you
[1:24:20] know a part of the report God doesn't
[1:24:25] give everybody the whole shebang all at
[1:24:27] once
[1:24:27] you know he's its pearls to him it's
[1:24:31] here not you're not even supposed to do
[1:24:33] that
[1:24:34] you're supposed to be selectively
[1:24:36] prayerfully careful who you reveal the
[1:24:39] mysteries of the kingdom to
[1:24:41] but you got to be led by God it's it's
[1:24:44] not yet we I might go preach on the
[1:24:45] street corner and I'm the shotgunning
[1:24:47] I'm just blowing I'm just casting see
[1:24:49] God will find his angels are gather his
[1:24:51] children if there's any out there but
[1:24:53] I'm talking about when you're one-on-one
[1:24:55] you ought to always be in prayer and
[1:24:57] sometimes you might fish a little bit
[1:24:59] you might put a little plug out there
[1:25:00] and just see if you get a nibble if you
[1:25:02] get a nibble work it a little bit and
[1:25:04] see if you get a bite get it get a
[1:25:05] strike or two you know you might have a
[1:25:07] hot fishing hole there hey man I'm here
[1:25:09] brother Bradley saying amen brother
[1:25:11] Jason amen
[1:25:15] so so we find in that you know if you
[1:25:19] cast that lure in there you don't get
[1:25:21] nothing in Cassidy don't get nothing
[1:25:23] move on don't force nothing you're
[1:25:26] commanded to not do that because you you
[1:25:30] throw down pearls and to swine and all
[1:25:32] they do is trample the precious pearl of
[1:25:35] God so we have to use wisdom in this
[1:25:39] hour we're supposed to be led of the
[1:25:41] Spirit see all right now so you know
[1:25:48] he's saying I'm gonna give you this part
[1:25:50] that's all he was giving to Israel that
[1:25:52] a Messiah's coming
[1:25:53] they didn't exactly know what it was
[1:25:55] going to look like say well you know
[1:25:57] that's a pretty presumptuous statement
[1:26:00] well when he came to kill him so I think
[1:26:04] I'm on pretty good ground to not tub to
[1:26:07] believe that they certainly
[1:26:08] misunderstood what he's going to be in
[1:26:09] brother Branham alludes to that says you
[1:26:11] know they thought it was going to be
[1:26:12] some great general coming in to free him
[1:26:14] from Rome they thought brother branham
[1:26:17] uses you know language descriptive and
[1:26:19] he's such a storyteller it's beautiful
[1:26:21] how brother branham can draw you into
[1:26:23] the story make you feel like you're
[1:26:24] standing right there and I love looking
[1:26:26] at the scripture through a prophets eyes
[1:26:27] and any he says you know Caiaphas
[1:26:30] thought you know there's gonna be this
[1:26:31] this great big conveyor come down to the
[1:26:35] earth and and you know here comes the
[1:26:37] Messiah and he's gonna cry town and he's
[1:26:39] gonna walk straight to the temple and
[1:26:41] he's gonna walk straight up to the high
[1:26:43] priest and go I'm the Messiah I'm here
[1:26:44] and he's gonna be glowing and
[1:26:45] effervescent and and they're gonna and
[1:26:48] we're all gonna we're gonna set up the
[1:26:50] kingdom and kick the Romans out and
[1:26:51] Jerusalem is gonna be reestablished in
[1:26:53] Israel
[1:26:54] rule the worldé that's what they thought
[1:26:56] and and to a certain extent a lot of
[1:26:59] that was true he was gonna come down and
[1:27:01] he did but it but instead of coming as a
[1:27:04] general he came as a baby and instead of
[1:27:07] coming to the denomination's of the day
[1:27:09] he came to simple people who would
[1:27:11] believe him like babies he did the same
[1:27:15] thing in the upper room he came down to
[1:27:17] people who were ignorant and unlearned
[1:27:19] but they observed that they had been
[1:27:21] with Jesus I don't need this world's
[1:27:23] intelligence I just want the world to
[1:27:24] know who I talked to on a daily basis
[1:27:27] hallelujah and he moved out across the
[1:27:30] world he's done the same thing in this
[1:27:32] hour again so he says you know to Israel
[1:27:36] at this time I'm just going to give you
[1:27:38] a part of the report and if you can
[1:27:40] catch it then the arm of the Lord is
[1:27:43] being revealed to you that's important
[1:27:48] that's the connection of that first
[1:27:50] verse in Isaiah 53 I'm going to start
[1:27:53] giving you some revelation and the
[1:27:56] revelation is not to increase your
[1:27:58] theological intelligence the revelation
[1:28:02] I'm giving you this an important point
[1:28:04] we'll say it again the revelation is not
[1:28:08] to be stored as data in your theology
[1:28:12] hard drive the the revelation was coming
[1:28:17] so that you and catching it could become
[1:28:20] an extension of an arm which would be a
[1:28:24] hand you follow me
[1:28:28] understand God wants you in on this he
[1:28:34] could eat he could easily he could have
[1:28:36] easily chose the trees but he chose you
[1:28:38] he could have chose the wind brother Ram
[1:28:40] said in fact if he had weeded them been
[1:28:41] finished long time ago because the wind
[1:28:43] will just abate him the wind don't care
[1:28:45] about political correctness the wind
[1:28:48] will come in and blow whole cities down
[1:28:49] and not apologize for it trees don't
[1:28:54] apologize to anybody they grow wherever
[1:28:55] they're planted they'll grow right up in
[1:28:58] the middle of a metropolitan city they
[1:28:59] don't care they're commanded by God from
[1:29:02] a seed grow and bring forth and unless
[1:29:05] man comes as an amateur guarding
[1:29:07] cut some down that trail does keep right
[1:29:09] on growing to the end of its lifecycle
[1:29:11] and so we find that that he's extending
[1:29:16] his revelation so then what is an arm an
[1:29:19] arm is what extends a hand and then what
[1:29:22] is a hand alright so a hand is help from
[1:29:29] God
[1:29:30] so therefore the arm of the Lord is the
[1:29:33] extension of God reaching down to do
[1:29:36] something in through and for Humanity
[1:29:43] so who have believed our report well a
[1:29:47] very few ok who ever believed it
[1:29:51] they are the arm of the Lord is revealed
[1:29:55] say to them but not just to them through
[1:29:58] them amen you're getting it I can see
[1:30:02] your following right along watch now
[1:30:04] so the arm of the Lord which is the hand
[1:30:07] of the Lord extended so when it's the
[1:30:12] hand then it's the arm extended into
[1:30:16] human instruments and now you can see
[1:30:20] this pattern in Isaiah because we know
[1:30:26] and it talking and I don't have time to
[1:30:29] get tracked off into the Godhead brother
[1:30:30] Jason's been doing an awesome job
[1:30:32] teaching it to us uh revisiting that
[1:30:35] fantastic subject what do you chase five
[1:30:37] supports deep at this point and so and I
[1:30:43] would imagine you got a bunch more to go
[1:30:44] amen it's a vet I used I remember the
[1:30:47] days when I thought the Godhead was a
[1:30:48] simple thing like God's not threes one
[1:30:50] and it's just one of the most basic
[1:30:51] simple died and then brother Branham
[1:30:54] comes along and preaches Christ as the
[1:30:55] mystery of God revealed and blows
[1:30:57] everybody's minds and you realize wow
[1:30:59] the Godhead ain't just a simple little
[1:31:00] doctrine when you when you listen to God
[1:31:04] when when you listen to Christ is the
[1:31:07] mystery of God revealed then then
[1:31:09] because that's that's Christ as the
[1:31:12] mystery of God revealed is the is
[1:31:15] brother Branham answering the what's
[1:31:18] happened in the opening of the seven
[1:31:19] seals
[1:31:20] that that's what it was all about that
[1:31:22] what was happening and those seals being
[1:31:24] unfolded was God revealing himself in
[1:31:26] Christ and then Christ revealing himself
[1:31:28] in a church that's why I would come and
[1:31:30] then preach the masterpiece
[1:31:31] what's the masterpiece a piece off the
[1:31:34] master oh my and brother Brandon would
[1:31:39] say to me the flaw critics said on the
[1:31:42] floor ruined and brother Brent said no
[1:31:43] the flaw to me to a prophet see not to
[1:31:45] an art critic but to a prophet the flaws
[1:31:48] what made it a masterpiece because if it
[1:31:50] had a flaw if a piece full off if
[1:31:52] there's a piece over here laying and you
[1:31:54] pick it up you can you can be sure that
[1:31:56] there's a master piece somewhere to this
[1:31:59] piece and so we find out that when you
[1:32:03] come it fits perfectly
[1:32:05] and I'm here to tell you God knocked off
[1:32:07] and and Here I am today I'm a piece of
[1:32:10] the masterpiece and I'm trying to get my
[1:32:13] life to fit then the image of where it
[1:32:16] came from you came from God you're going
[1:32:18] back to God hallelujah
[1:32:20] this is the great mystery of the Godhead
[1:32:24] and and so you find that that there's
[1:32:27] such a confusion about how that the
[1:32:29] logos which came out from God and then
[1:32:33] you know human reasoning says well it's
[1:32:36] got to be then a separate person because
[1:32:38] in the beginning was the word and it was
[1:32:41] with God so it looks like a different
[1:32:43] person until it turns around and says
[1:32:45] but it was God you say oh well then it
[1:32:48] was the eternal son of God in brother
[1:32:50] Branham said how's the son eternal I
[1:32:52] have an eternal son that's stupid a son
[1:32:56] means something born something that
[1:32:57] started there's no way it can be eternal
[1:32:59] you can't have a son that never had a
[1:33:01] beginning that's the very fact that he's
[1:33:03] the son means he started oh I'm not here
[1:33:07] to preach on the Godhead but I love that
[1:33:08] subject but I'm making this point that
[1:33:12] that it was in that it was not God in
[1:33:15] his spirit in visible form that no man
[1:33:20] have seen at any time that created the
[1:33:22] world it was that being but he didn't do
[1:33:25] it in that form
[1:33:26] he he he condescended into a form of the
[1:33:30] logos and in that form he
[1:33:32] the word or the Sun he took a
[1:33:35] designation of Sun because he came out
[1:33:37] from something God
[1:33:40] condescending into that and in that form
[1:33:43] he made all things so when you see that
[1:33:46] God didn't start producing things until
[1:33:50] he entered into that sonship then you
[1:33:52] can see why God needs you in sonship as
[1:33:56] sons of the Living God to continue the
[1:33:59] plan this is it's not when we talk about
[1:34:03] that in the world says all you're a
[1:34:05] bunch of elitist I'm not an elitist I'm
[1:34:07] just looking at the pattern and I see
[1:34:10] that God doesn't change he's the same
[1:34:12] yesterday there forever and how he
[1:34:14] started as I worked in the middle and I
[1:34:16] worked in Christ and I worked in the
[1:34:18] church and how he's working in me and in
[1:34:23] fact is that that that you can see the
[1:34:26] arm of the Lord and in the scripture of
[1:34:29] text in the context of it the arm is is
[1:34:33] set aside as something different than
[1:34:38] God but yet that's again human reasoning
[1:34:42] would look like that when you read it
[1:34:44] that way just like just like you can
[1:34:46] read things like that in the New
[1:34:47] Testament and Trinitarians jump right on
[1:34:49] it you know Jesus in the water and a
[1:34:51] voice is speaking and they look at stuff
[1:34:52] like that and they deduce they make
[1:34:53] deductions that are incorrect and when
[1:34:57] you read isaiah 53 it looks like that
[1:35:00] this arm oh that's got to be Christ I
[1:35:02] see he is different but no unarmed I
[1:35:05] thought my arm isn't different from me
[1:35:07] my arm is an extension of me and my hand
[1:35:11] is just an extension of that but in
[1:35:14] order to in order to move something my
[1:35:16] hand has to pick it up this is how God
[1:35:21] anatomically made a man in the image of
[1:35:25] God see so then so then his hand is
[1:35:35] extended and and you can see how that
[1:35:40] that you see it when Jesus comes and you
[1:35:44] look at
[1:35:46] people who hear the report he's risen to
[1:35:53] the degree now here comes Mary and some
[1:35:56] women they see the sloan rolled away
[1:35:58] they see an angel sitting on the stone
[1:36:01] and and why you seek the living among
[1:36:04] the dead he's risen go tell his
[1:36:06] disciples you know and and and here
[1:36:11] married they all go running and here
[1:36:12] Mary lingering and she comes upon who
[1:36:15] she thinks to be the gardener it turns
[1:36:16] out to be Jesus himself and so they go
[1:36:21] running back with this report and that
[1:36:24] the disciples you know don't really
[1:36:26] believe it you can tell they don't
[1:36:29] really believe it because they're coming
[1:36:31] to investigate it when you don't believe
[1:36:35] something you just go investigate it I
[1:36:37] don't need to investigate what I heard
[1:36:40] surrounding that the stories of this
[1:36:42] message because I know that when I hear
[1:36:45] this message it changes my life and
[1:36:46] that's all the evidence I need and they
[1:36:50] go running to investigate you can see
[1:36:52] they're doubting and then it's further
[1:36:55] shown that they're doubting because
[1:36:57] Cleopas and a bunch of his mates yeah in
[1:37:00] his head day his head for home yeah we
[1:37:02] ran and found an empty tomb and Peter
[1:37:04] was you know so big and you know and and
[1:37:07] and John Rena
[1:37:08] ran ahead of him outran because young
[1:37:10] kid and John got to the door he's a
[1:37:12] little afraid to go in Peter has busted
[1:37:14] right in walked right down inside looked
[1:37:16] in it was all gone he was empty he was
[1:37:17] gone
[1:37:18] they knew they didn't take him you take
[1:37:20] him nine and take me buddy take him no
[1:37:21] we don't know who took him well those
[1:37:23] those those crazy women said an angel
[1:37:25] said he's risen oh you know what Peter's
[1:37:28] response was to that I'm going fishing
[1:37:31] I'm going to I'm going back to work I
[1:37:33] don't know I'm so confused we had
[1:37:37] thought it would be he that would be
[1:37:39] Messiah I followed him for three years
[1:37:41] and now he's gone and now he's risen and
[1:37:44] we don't know and we didn't get him we
[1:37:45] haven't seen him and and this is so
[1:37:48] confusing we're just gonna go back to
[1:37:50] what we know didn't do him any good they
[1:37:53] couldn't catch a thing
[1:37:56] the road to emmaus they're walking
[1:37:59] around sad until Jesus rebukes them you
[1:38:03] notice who the ones who were in action
[1:38:04] the women you know why they believed it
[1:38:08] and the news they hadn't seen him that
[1:38:12] Mary stayed back those other women took
[1:38:14] off running when they got there they
[1:38:16] hadn't seen him but they believed the
[1:38:18] report and they were now the arm of the
[1:38:20] Lord to the disciples he's risen you
[1:38:23] understand they've literally become the
[1:38:25] hand to the arm you get me but because
[1:38:30] that the disciples didn't believe it
[1:38:32] they're not running around telling the
[1:38:34] world they're not a hand of God they're
[1:38:37] not the hand of God they're not an
[1:38:38] extension of the arm of the Lord because
[1:38:40] they didn't believe the report all they
[1:38:44] can do is go live there are simple
[1:38:45] ridiculous human lives while the
[1:38:48] greatest event to ever strike the earth
[1:38:50] is happening an unfolding over a period
[1:38:53] of 30 to 40 days things are going to
[1:38:55] unfold the world had never seen the
[1:38:57] lights out see Jesus when he raises up
[1:39:04] out of the tomb I mean if you if you
[1:39:07] track that back into the Old Testament
[1:39:09] and you see that when the high priest
[1:39:10] went in the high priest spent a lot of
[1:39:13] time getting himself ready he had to
[1:39:15] wash himself he had to have his garments
[1:39:16] perfect he had to have everything
[1:39:18] exactly he had to rehearse he had to
[1:39:21] practice he couldn't miss step anything
[1:39:23] could mean his life and in fact is it
[1:39:26] was so serious they put bells and
[1:39:28] pomegranates on the bottom of his skirt
[1:39:30] so that when he walked he jingled so
[1:39:32] they could hear him moving but just as a
[1:39:34] fail-safe they tied a rope to his foot
[1:39:37] head in a case he went in there and
[1:39:39] dropped over they didn't hear the
[1:39:40] jingling anymore they dragged him out oh
[1:39:41] well we got a new high priest so when
[1:39:44] the high priest finally spent all that
[1:39:46] time getting himself ready and all
[1:39:48] dressed then he went in now he wasn't
[1:39:51] first he wasn't going in for the sins of
[1:39:55] the people it Abel's no he wasn't going
[1:39:58] in for them at all he's going in first
[1:39:59] for himself first he's got to be
[1:40:02] accepted and then when he goes in and
[1:40:06] makes the offering then he comes back
[1:40:07] out and presents himself and the
[1:40:09] people start rejoicing hallelujah we got
[1:40:12] a high priest that's been accepted now
[1:40:15] he can go offer for our sins so you see
[1:40:18] people say people misunderstand Calvary
[1:40:21] they see Jesus coming out and they say
[1:40:23] oh when he when he rose out of the tomb
[1:40:25] then that was salvation for the whole
[1:40:27] world know it wasn't that's not true
[1:40:30] Jesus only proved that he was accepted
[1:40:33] by God brother Branham shows us that and
[1:40:36] in the Rising Sun he says you know what
[1:40:38] a resurrection that was what a
[1:40:40] resurrection this is said he rose from
[1:40:41] the tomb many men had died no one had
[1:40:44] ever able to bring himself back and
[1:40:45] brother him said it's a glorious
[1:40:46] resurrection but he says what good does
[1:40:48] that do me brother Graham said it great
[1:40:52] for him he rose but how do I become a
[1:40:55] beneficiary and in Jesus even says now
[1:40:59] don't touch me I've got to a sinned I've
[1:41:01] got to go back into the presence of God
[1:41:03] I've got to offer my blood and when I
[1:41:06] when that's mad I'll lay the body on the
[1:41:09] altar I'll take the life in the blood
[1:41:11] and bring it back down into the church
[1:41:12] and on the day of Pentecost one of em
[1:41:15] says what is the baptism of the Holy
[1:41:16] Ghost you believe God and you repent of
[1:41:19] your sins and then he says he gives you
[1:41:22] on the Holy Ghost as a seal proving that
[1:41:25] he has accepted your faith and he comes
[1:41:29] down and falls on 120 and now
[1:41:31] redemptions claims have been met and God
[1:41:35] has a body in the earth and now misses
[1:41:37] Jesus Christ in a multiplied form is
[1:41:39] beginning to move around that's what
[1:41:41] we've returned to today that's what the
[1:41:43] seals were open for was to stand a bride
[1:41:46] back on the earth again with the full
[1:41:48] abstract title that God intended for his
[1:41:51] church to be the hand of the arm of God
[1:41:56] by believing the report brother Branham
[1:42:07] says it like this so he's talking about
[1:42:15] in serpent seed
[1:42:17] says now when Jesus I'll get a hurry
[1:42:20] when Jesus rose on the third day he did
[1:42:25] not have the keys to the kingdom of
[1:42:30] heaven did you know that he says he says
[1:42:36] I got the keys to death in hell but not
[1:42:40] to the kingdom because they had been
[1:42:43] given to Peter and now Peter whatsoever
[1:42:47] you loose on earth I'll loose it in
[1:42:50] heaven what you bind on earth I'll bind
[1:42:53] it in heaven so God in Christ as we've
[1:42:57] said his brother branham taught us God
[1:43:00] and Christ did not create the earth for
[1:43:03] himself to rule God created the earth
[1:43:07] God rules the universe he created the
[1:43:10] earth as a headquarters for his family
[1:43:12] to rule and and and that you can see why
[1:43:16] in time past in ancient time where the
[1:43:22] sons of God morning stars sang together
[1:43:24] and sons of God shouted for joy seeing
[1:43:27] the whole plan of redemption seeing how
[1:43:30] it was going to be accomplished by the
[1:43:32] Lamb of God that's why the book of
[1:43:34] Revelation says he was the Lamb of God
[1:43:36] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:43:40] when is the foundation of the world when
[1:43:43] morning stars sang together sons of God
[1:43:45] shouted for joy because friends it
[1:43:47] wouldn't just be that they were seeing
[1:43:49] the Lambs portion they were seeing their
[1:43:51] portion they were seeing an age when
[1:43:54] they would go down and they would be an
[1:43:55] extension they would be the hand to the
[1:43:59] arm to the being hallelujah that listen
[1:44:03] God watch what God says that in Psalms
[1:44:07] he says he created the world and the
[1:44:10] stars in the heavens with his fingers
[1:44:12] but you'll notice that in Exodus I think
[1:44:15] Exodus stuff 15 God shows that he
[1:44:19] reminds the children of Israel I thought
[1:44:22] I had a note for that somewhere in case
[1:44:23] I missed quoting that ah but I'm pretty
[1:44:26] sure it said Exodus 15 where we find
[1:44:28] that he's
[1:44:29] say it I'm sorry Exodus 13 there it is
[1:44:32] thirteen three he reminds the children
[1:44:34] of Israel now how were the children of
[1:44:36] Israel delivered by Moses God said
[1:44:40] brother branham picks this up in the
[1:44:42] fourth seal in various places and he
[1:44:44] says God says I have come down I have
[1:44:47] heard the cries of my people I have come
[1:44:51] down I have remembered my promise
[1:44:54] he promised Abraham he made that promise
[1:44:57] to Abraham your children will sojourn in
[1:44:59] a land for four hundred years and I will
[1:45:01] bring them out by a mighty hand don't
[1:45:03] worry Abraham go to sleep go sleep with
[1:45:06] your fathers don't worry about your
[1:45:08] family your there gonna be more than the
[1:45:11] stars of the heaven
[1:45:12] don't worry Abraham doesn't matter I've
[1:45:15] got this Abraham and Abraham could rest
[1:45:18] in that and then sure enough four
[1:45:20] hundred years they sojourn in a strange
[1:45:22] land they were oppressed and God comes
[1:45:24] down to Moses and says now I remember
[1:45:26] the promise I made and now the time is
[1:45:28] up it's been 400 years it's time for me
[1:45:31] to do it though Paul shows us it
[1:45:33] actually hit 430 years so you see
[1:45:35] there's something to be said like in
[1:45:37] brother branham's quote when they were
[1:45:39] about ready when they were getting ready
[1:45:41] so you know what we've been doing here
[1:45:44] all these decades since the Prophet went
[1:45:46] home been getting ready you've been
[1:45:49] getting ready I'm here to tell you say
[1:45:51] brother Jason what's coming tomorrow I
[1:45:53] don't know but you've been prepared for
[1:45:55] it
[1:45:55] I'm here to tell you something friends
[1:45:57] you've been trained for this hour you've
[1:46:00] received the word and I don't know how
[1:46:02] it's going to be used but I know it's
[1:46:03] being used and it's going to be further
[1:46:06] used that's why I said to you that we
[1:46:10] don't know we don't even know what we
[1:46:12] don't know so let me know him who knows
[1:46:14] everything because this is God's water
[1:46:17] and God says and brother Brent picks up
[1:46:20] the fourth seal says now I remember the
[1:46:22] promise I've heard the cry I've come
[1:46:24] down but I'm sending you Moses and God
[1:46:26] says to them in Exodus 13 you were
[1:46:30] delivered and he didn't call it Moses he
[1:46:33] didn't even call it a man he didn't call
[1:46:35] it a prophet he said you've been
[1:46:36] delivered by the hand of God
[1:46:40] and the hand of God was a prophet named
[1:46:43] Moses he was the human extension he was
[1:46:47] the revealed reality of the arm of the
[1:46:50] Lord and that's why when Moses said they
[1:46:53] won't believe me he gave him signs so
[1:46:55] they would have to believe because God
[1:46:57] wasn't intending just to have Moses as a
[1:47:00] servant he wanted all of Israel to be
[1:47:03] his extension to the world this is the
[1:47:07] hour that we have arrived at I here I
[1:47:10] would say here today who has believed
[1:47:13] her report who among you brother have
[1:47:15] believed the report that God has sent
[1:47:18] forth a message in this hour why did he
[1:47:21] do it to fill up your theology data no
[1:47:24] sir to make you a hand that extends an
[1:47:27] arm that comes from God and ronon what's
[1:47:31] down in humanity see so he says his
[1:47:39] family so so he says he didn't have the
[1:47:42] keys because he he put the keys in his
[1:47:46] church so his family think of the plan
[1:47:50] now that his God's plan is to have his
[1:47:54] family descend into a fallen earth you
[1:47:59] think about that you believe you come
[1:48:01] from God see question has never been
[1:48:05] where am I going questions always been
[1:48:06] where I come from so I'm going is
[1:48:08] retroactive it's automatic I will return
[1:48:11] back to where I came from
[1:48:12] so coming from God when morning stars
[1:48:15] sang together and sons of God shouted
[1:48:17] for joy whatever reality I'm not here to
[1:48:20] preach on whatever reality that was I
[1:48:22] know that we we brother Branham said
[1:48:24] before there was start us you existed in
[1:48:26] the mind of God so well I was just a
[1:48:29] figment of his thought no you were way
[1:48:30] more than a thought you were a gene you
[1:48:33] were an attribute you were literally a
[1:48:36] DNA extension of Almighty God and that's
[1:48:41] why you respond to the word because you
[1:48:44] are always intended to be the hand of
[1:48:46] the arm
[1:48:48] hallelujah why do I respond because I'm
[1:48:50] a hand to the arm hallelujah I can
[1:48:53] promise you if this
[1:48:54] Rainn says pick that up the arms gonna
[1:48:55] reach in the hands gonna grab and that's
[1:48:58] that's the that's the synchronous way
[1:49:01] that God is trying to operate through
[1:49:03] his church here he was going to send you
[1:49:06] knowing what he was doing he was going
[1:49:09] to send you into a fallen world and in
[1:49:12] the era of the Holy Ghost when he
[1:49:15] fulfilled his promise to not just be
[1:49:17] above not just be with but to be in and
[1:49:20] live through and multiply through the
[1:49:24] body what is the body of believers
[1:49:27] the vehicle to multiply God's family you
[1:49:32] take this word to somebody you bring
[1:49:34] them to life
[1:49:35] listen you realize you have their power
[1:49:36] to raise the dead what good would it do
[1:49:40] you to go to the graveyard and raise the
[1:49:42] dead they'd die again but if you can
[1:49:45] raise their dead soul to life if God can
[1:49:48] use you and you can raise the soul to
[1:49:50] life that life will never perish
[1:49:54] it can never die and you become an
[1:49:56] extension of Almighty God because you
[1:49:59] believe the report God kept left the
[1:50:03] keys it stands to reason to me God knew
[1:50:06] that he would be dropping you and me
[1:50:08] down in the worst age of all ages the
[1:50:12] complete conglomeration of all the the
[1:50:14] white horse all of his deception all of
[1:50:17] the violence of the read all of the
[1:50:19] darkness and suppression and oppression
[1:50:21] of the black and bring it to a pale but
[1:50:23] he would accumulate the lion and the ox
[1:50:26] and the man and a flying eagle and he'd
[1:50:29] give you the keys because if you're
[1:50:31] gonna operate if you come from heaven
[1:50:33] and you're gonna operate in a fallen
[1:50:35] world you're gonna need the keys to the
[1:50:37] heavenly power you're gonna need keys to
[1:50:41] operate the kingdom in a dark world well
[1:50:45] that's not going to believe you and if
[1:50:47] they don't believe you they're lost and
[1:50:49] so to get them to believe you as they
[1:50:51] were as they needed to believe Moses he
[1:50:54] has given you power and he says I've
[1:50:56] given you power
[1:50:57] all the power of the devil oh we ought
[1:51:02] to rejoice today friends because we have
[1:51:04] become the extension of the word in this
[1:51:07] hour I'm so glad I know you said I don't
[1:51:10] feel worthy I don't feel worthy none of
[1:51:13] us have ever felt worthy this is not you
[1:51:15] doing it this is God doing it he gets
[1:51:18] the glory to God we live let us say Lord
[1:51:23] whatever you can do with this rusty old
[1:51:25] life whatever you can do get whatever
[1:51:27] usage I'm willing to dedicate myself I'm
[1:51:30] willing if I fall I'll repent if I need
[1:51:32] to pray I'll pray I'll read my Bible
[1:51:34] I'll fellowship I'll come to church I'll
[1:51:36] hear the tape I'll do whatever so that I
[1:51:39] can be usable so that I can be ready
[1:51:43] because I'm not here to accumulate a
[1:51:47] wealth of data the data secured
[1:51:52] unchallengeable I've been preaching it
[1:51:55] too long I didn't been to too many
[1:51:57] continents preaching it I'm here to tell
[1:51:59] you the data in this message is
[1:52:02] unassailable in the Bible but it's not
[1:52:06] about the data there's lots of the data
[1:52:08] I don't understand but I know who is the
[1:52:12] one I know that's who my life is plugged
[1:52:15] into and maybe just maybe there's data
[1:52:19] in this Bible that's never going to be
[1:52:21] understood theologically maybe it can
[1:52:23] only be understood physically maybe when
[1:52:28] people who can't understand the written
[1:52:30] word see it in you they go oh say that's
[1:52:35] pretty far-fetched
[1:52:36] that's how God's going to judge them God
[1:52:40] is going to righteously justifiably
[1:52:45] condemn the world many of which most of
[1:52:50] which probably never read this book so
[1:52:56] God put this book in human skin and now
[1:53:01] this book walks around in flesh
[1:53:05] to whom who has believed our report and
[1:53:11] to whom is the arm of the Lord extended
[1:53:17] you want to extend it to your families
[1:53:19] what extended to the community you want
[1:53:22] to extend it you want to be the hand of
[1:53:24] God
[1:53:25] oh let's stand to our feet friends I
[1:53:27] dare not go any further I'd need much
[1:53:29] more time and we're out
[1:53:30] oh that's what I want to be brother can
[1:53:34] come and let's sing a song or two come
[1:53:38] sister dad brother Chris are you playing
[1:53:43] yet Josh are you still okay you're still
[1:53:45] in practice mode okay great
[1:53:47] but josh is joining the team of the
[1:53:48] musicians and so we're gonna have some
[1:53:52] wind instruments here some reed
[1:53:54] instrument working up here a man we need
[1:53:57] to get sister Julia back get our flute

[1:54:04] day the sister charity say hey we need a
[1:54:06] violin going so well I play a violin on
[1:54:09] a violin watch same thing same thing
[1:54:12] just a fancier word and a little
[1:54:14] different sound but Amen I I want to see
[1:54:16] people a man using what God you owe it
[1:54:20] to God if he's gave you that talent and
[1:54:22] and you owe it to give it to the Lord
[1:54:25] amen you know brother Kenny had these
[1:54:28] requests I think he read them all often
[1:54:29] your brother Ken and we just want to
[1:54:31] pray again earnestly for them there's
[1:54:33] other needs that have come in various
[1:54:36] people that have been struck down by
[1:54:39] this affliction and we're praying for
[1:54:41] them you know even the ones that I'm
[1:54:45] aware of seem to be all on here no I
[1:54:47] think I did see one other that might not
[1:54:49] be here
[1:54:49] I'd have to hunt it but anyway that's
[1:54:52] not so important but I want to be an
[1:54:56] extension I want to be used of God
[1:55:00] friends that's to me
[1:55:04] that's the advantage that I want to take
[1:55:07] of this time that we have
[1:55:10] we're not assembling that's that is so
[1:55:13] vital Paul was so specific in the 10th
[1:55:16] chapter of Hebrews there is such a
[1:55:18] necessary element in fellowship and and
[1:55:21] you know depending on how this goes long
[1:55:23] term we we may have to evolve the way
[1:55:26] we're doing things but we're gonna keep
[1:55:28] going on the short term here as I said
[1:55:30] through the first four weeks so we're
[1:55:32] approaching the middle of that by next
[1:55:34] Wednesday I think we'll be at the past
[1:55:37] the middle and headed into the second
[1:55:38] half of it our four week time period for
[1:55:42] a short term plan then we'll move to a
[1:55:43] longer term plan if necessary but my I
[1:55:46] was looking at a picture the other day
[1:55:48] and I don't know I guess somebody shot
[1:55:52] from our Facebook stream
[1:55:54] I think Moe might have taken it and
[1:55:55] posted it somewhere I think I don't know
[1:55:57] where I found it but I was standing in a
[1:55:59] pulpit preaching and and this place was
[1:56:02] full and people had their hands up and
[1:56:04] my heart is 100 oh I didn't know you
[1:56:09] don't know what you got till you don't
[1:56:10] caught it friends how about we just pray
[1:56:13] for these needs and say Lord even so
[1:56:16] come quickly Lord Jesus and if we've got
[1:56:19] to be here some more time lord give us a
[1:56:22] way to get back to come back together
[1:56:24] I believe that it's going to be a
[1:56:26] wonderful thing people are going to be
[1:56:29] eager to get back in church I bet we
[1:56:32] won't have one empty empty seat amen I
[1:56:34] bet even people who rarely come will
[1:56:35] come when we finally get to come back
[1:56:37] amen
[1:56:38] before we pray let's sing brother Kenny
[1:56:43] oh yes for my transgression oh my he was
[1:56:53] bruised
[1:56:55] [Music]
[1:56:58] Burtie surely surely he bore our sorrows
[1:57:12] oh yes
[1:57:14] and by his stripes we are he he was
[1:57:24] wounded sing it oh he was wounded for my
[1:57:32] transgression Oh hallelujah he was
[1:57:37] bruised for my knee
[1:57:41] [Applause]
[1:57:45] surely surely well surely he bore our
[1:57:53] sorrow and by His stripes we are healed
[1:58:04] let's raise our hands and sing it now
[1:58:06] all over those in your homes now raise
[1:58:09] up your hands for my transgression oh he
[1:58:20] was bruised for my
[1:58:24] what thank you Lord thank you Jesus Oh
[1:58:30] surely he bore our sorrows Oh and by His
[1:58:43] stripes we as they play that for me
[1:58:49] softly let's pray father we thank you
[1:58:52] for that day on Calvary he was wounded
[1:58:55] for my transgressions bruised for my
[1:59:00] iniquities surely he bore my sorrows and
[1:59:05] by His stripes we are healed Lord you
[1:59:09] having done all of that would we not
[1:59:13] avail ourselves of every of every
[1:59:16] blessing that it brings would we allow
[1:59:20] our lives to come short of realizing
[1:59:24] every benefit when you were wounded for
[1:59:27] our transgressions when you were bruised
[1:59:29] for my iniquities would I let anything
[1:59:32] hold me back from fully maximizing as a
[1:59:35] beneficiary of that day on Calvary he
[1:59:39] was wounded for my transgressions he was
[1:59:42] bruised for my iniquities surely he's
[1:59:46] born all my sorrows why would I bear him
[1:59:49] if he's already born by His stripes
[1:59:53] I'm already healed lord help us today to
[1:59:59] have a real living faith we have
[2:00:03] believed the report we are now we have
[2:00:06] we have we have received the arm of the
[2:00:10] Lord and we found out to our to our
[2:00:13] amazement that you always were intending
[2:00:17] it to be connecting to a hand and when
[2:00:21] it was the hand
[2:00:22] it was immortal Moses was a mortal man
[2:00:26] with all kinds of ups and downs and
[2:00:30] iniquitous things in his life but yet
[2:00:32] you were going to use him you had four
[2:00:35] ordained it before the foundation of the
[2:00:37] world even botched it he even first
[2:00:40] tried to go forward in his own strength
[2:00:42] ruin the whole thing but when you took
[2:00:47] control of it Lord Father I remember
[2:00:50] when Moses felt so overwhelmed he was
[2:00:55] dr. Moses brother branham said all the
[2:00:57] cases come to him all the troubles come
[2:00:59] to him all the sickness he had a
[2:01:01] doctor's bag and He healed the people
[2:01:04] and counseled the people and decided
[2:01:06] court cases and it just broke him down
[2:01:09] and wearied him and his father-in-law
[2:01:11] takes him aside said now son-in-law
[2:01:12] listen listen to your father-in-law here
[2:01:15] I got a lot of years of wisdom what
[2:01:17] should i do Jethro all right here's what
[2:01:19] you do you get yourself seventy princes
[2:01:21] you set them out over people you segment
[2:01:23] at all you group it all together and and
[2:01:26] you you you you distribute your
[2:01:28] authority and delegate it to these men
[2:01:30] and let them take this load off you Lord
[2:01:33] Moses goes forward and the whole thing
[2:01:34] falls flat Kukui just nothing but a
[2:01:38] bunch of nonsense and chaos and Moses
[2:01:41] comes crying to you Lord what must I do
[2:01:43] and the Lord says the right Moses here's
[2:01:45] what you do
[2:01:46] get yourself seventy princes delegate
[2:01:48] your authority and set him over these
[2:01:50] matters and when you said it and he did
[2:01:53] it it worked perfect we're not here Lord
[2:01:56] for the wisdom of man I'm not here to
[2:01:58] figure out the calamities of the world I
[2:02:00] don't need to know all I need to know is
[2:02:03] to be led by eternal life
[2:02:05] I want to believe the report I want to
[2:02:07] look upon we don't know what it's what
[2:02:09] it all entails we don't know father
[2:02:11] but we know you and that's all I need to
[2:02:15] know I want to know him who knows
[2:02:18] everything and I want to know him in the
[2:02:20] Fellowship of his suffering I want to be
[2:02:22] made conformable unto his death Lord
[2:02:24] that I might live and reign with him
[2:02:26] grant it to us in this time Lord that we
[2:02:29] will we will avail ourselves of
[2:02:33] everything
[2:02:34] that day on Calvary provided everything
[2:02:36] that when you poured out your spirit
[2:02:38] into the upper room Lord you didn't you
[2:02:42] didn't even have a church until the Holy
[2:02:44] Ghost it was the Holy Ghost that birthed
[2:02:46] the church so Master there there's not a
[2:02:52] man that's alive outside of the Holy
[2:02:54] Ghost he's just walking around in an
[2:02:56] imagery of life but he's actually dead
[2:02:58] in sin dead in trespasses and sin dead
[2:03:01] while he lives
[2:03:02] you don't even start really living til
[2:03:04] the inner man has been brought to life
[2:03:06] so help us Lord to be an extension of
[2:03:08] the arm
[2:03:09] help us Lord God to realize what our
[2:03:12] mission is here in the world I want to
[2:03:14] be effective at it Jesus whether it's
[2:03:16] healing the sick raising the dead
[2:03:18] converting the lost calling for the Holy
[2:03:21] Ghost Lord whether it's it's scriptural
[2:03:24] understanding whether it's healing of
[2:03:26] homes marriages young people whatever it
[2:03:28] is if it's going into the hospital
[2:03:29] laying hands on the sick to recover
[2:03:31] whatever it is if it's the spoken word
[2:03:36] and we find a need for it and you anoint
[2:03:38] it and we must speak creative power so
[2:03:40] be it Lord we want to be ready I want to
[2:03:45] be ready for that Lord I want to have my
[2:03:48] life ready for that moment may you grant
[2:03:52] it father we commit ourselves in this
