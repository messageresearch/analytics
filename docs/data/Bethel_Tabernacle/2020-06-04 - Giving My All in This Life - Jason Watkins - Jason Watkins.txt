we're gonna invite you right into the scripture to Luke chapter 18 greet you in the name of Lord happy to have you out on a Wednesday night amen praise the Lord want to look this evening at a title that I've just kind of struggled with a little bit but I finally sent a title back to the booth for this evening giving my all in this life how many want to give your all in this life I taste something friends they're the promise of the Lord is so overwhelming to those who are willing to give their all no matter how hard the job is here as I'm so fond of saying the retirement is out of this world a man praise the Lord god bless you let's read from Luke chapter 18 and we'll read verses 18 through 30 and a certain ruler asked him saying good master what shall I do to inherit eternal life jesus said unto him why call us thou me good nun is good save one that is God thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and he said all these have I kept from my youth up now when Jesus heard these things he said unto Him yet lack of sow one thing sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me and when he heard this known to catch it when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was very rich and when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he said how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God for it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God and they that heard it said who then can be saved and he said the things which are impossible with men are possible with God a man to them then Peter said lo we have left all and followed thee and he said unto Him verily I say unto you there is no man that hath left house parents brethren wife or children for the kingdom of God's sake who shall not receive a manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life everlasting water promise amen let's pray master we thank you for your word tonight and I pray now Lord as I just surrender myself Lord into your care I have outlines and notes before me and I've just seemingly Lord just went over them and over them and moving things and changing things and it just seems like that I'm just gonna have to stand here and just let you decide what all you want to preach so father I'm just humbling myself now before you I've did my own lord humbling before I came out and and I want to stand here as a clean vessel I want to speak to people who desire also as do I to have clean hearts clean hands clean minds granite Lord we want to be pleasing to you in this life you gave us this life it is you that owns it you have given us eternal life Lord we gladly surrender this little short temporal vapor trail into your care now I completely give it to you the audience here present the audience listening across the airwaves we commit it to you in Jesus name Amen god bless you as you're seated we have a number of requests that I will get to here shortly and I'll just watch to see if any more come in before we go to prayer and we'll catch those as well amen an interesting story the rich young ruler as we would refer to him very often times gee brother branham spoke about him quite a bit and in fact is you know the very last text sermon that brother Branham ever took was leadership in Covina California now he preached a communion and foot washing service back in Tucson but I'm talking about as as as a full text sermon he just passed a few comments and they went right into the communion some of the most wonderful comments we have in the message amen where he said I found out I there was a there was another William Branham down inside who wasn't the son of Charles and Ella Branham Wow what a what a what a parting shot that he gave to the bride knowing she would have to face the devil and go on without him but in his last sermon in Covina and he takes leadership and you know he he contrasts multiple figures in the scripture and you know he talks about Moses and he talks about this rich young ruler and what a contrast between those two rich young ruler Moses was a rich young ruler what a different choice Moses made and we want to talk tonight minister from my heart quite a bit on choice and the choices that we make it's sad that this young man made the choice that he did it actually was sad for Jesus interestingly Jesus loved him as him as a human being and you know God God loves sinners Jesus was a friend to sinners he tried his best to win every sinner he ever came in contact with and I think that it is it should be an abject lesson to us you know our attitude toward the unbelieving world brother Branham talked about you know even the man who's a drunkard or you know his alcohol or his cigarettes or things like that and I don't have the quote in front of me so I'm not quoting it verbatim but brother Branham teaches us from there to to the effect that you know don't tom don't don't don't take that from him that's the only the only happiness he has even though it's a false Mirage of happiness it's the only you know he said rather than you know try to do it that way why don't you show him something better I you know I always used to observe in in observing you know and raising small children and you know I learned I learned pretty quick that if you want to take you know one of moms pretties away from a little little one and a half-year-old you you go get a toy and you go thank you here because if you just take it from him he's not gonna understand and he's gonna scream you can't explain it so what you do is just giving something he would rather have amen and you know I I think that Jesus you know used a lot of wisdom in the way that he handled the sinner and you know he used a lot of wisdom in the way he handled obstinate people Zacchaeus was very obstinate and Jesus just handled him perfectly and you know the way that he sat among publicans and won many of them and you know he won a lot more people to Jehovah than the Pharisees did and and so you know there's there's something to be said about our approach and you know Jesus him seems to employ here all the tools that were given to him he was kind he answered his question he took him to the word he loved him he tried to help him he Jesus could see that he had a very deep-rooted problem thank you sir he had a very deep-rooted problem of selfishness and he was quite self-centered and that was really his issue I have noted numerous times brother Jack in the scripture that when Zacchaeus come down and he had he was kind of like Matthew he worked for the government he was doing some tax tax collecting things and he was cheating cheating his hebrew brethren and you know he wasn't being honest and and so when he comes down out of the training he's ready to become a believer and he he stands up and makes a proclamation to the people whomever I have wronged and he went back to the law of Moses I will refund you four times what I took and you know what Jesus said that's enough that's good that's all you need let's go going to your house for supper yeah and and and that's all Jesus required Jesus knew that's really all it would take but when he comes to this rich young ruler you know Jesus understands your heart Wow do you need to really get a hold of that tonight now that's that's good and good and while it's good and good her it's it's good because that when you fail him he knows your heart that you really didn't want to fail him he knows your heart that you really do love for the word even if you stumble you can say to him Lord you know in my heart I love you and the good news is he does and the good news is is that when you're a child of God you can't hide from him and he won't let you hide from him he will come after you and after you you have to understand that you're here against a backdrop of election and he can't lose you and so he you're a twin he's on your case I remember you know I've said this before quoting um sadder than that and says Louis just writes him back and says my friend says the Holy Ghost is chasing you and I do not think you'll get away I'm glad I didn't get away I'm glad he chased me down and knocked me down and held me down until I said Amen oh my Amen my mama you know my mind my brother I haven't I don't know where this came from when he was a little kid he come up with the word cat fro I don't know what it means to this day is it is an archaic word uh I study language but whenever you'd get him on the ground and having pin he would say CAF row and that was my signal to let go he had surrendered and I am so big and then worked with my dad when my dad would have him down tickling him he he would he would scream calf row and my dad would just keep right on going and he would he would send a bugle call you know for me like like the cavalry to come and I wasn't about to go in there I'm like oh no oh my the memories that come up at the oddest times but you know I'm glad that I surrendered to the Lord and you know it's sad this is that story that we read in Luke 18 because this young man didn't and you know Jesus knew in his heart that he had a much more gripping problem than Zacchaeus had he knew that this man had a problem of self-centeredness that was so strong that it was such a spirit of selfishness that he wanted his cake and eat it too he wanted what he wanted and he just wanted it and even though Jesus loved even gave him the words of life and gave him an opportunity the Bible goes on to tell at some time later in hell he lifted up his eyes to me the saddest stories are the ones that end tragic that need not have been I would listen life's already full of enough tragedy you're not going to avoid you can't because you're gonna need to struggle sometimes but when it's needless tragedy when it's needless struggle my and III certainly have to say a man with all of you tonight I have I have struggled needlessly before rather than just doing it God's Way so we learn thank God we learn as children and and so you know he he made that fateful decision to to maintain his own way and to maintain what it was he wanted to have and to hold in life and he today he's living with that decision now I know you're reading a story that's 2,000 years old I'm here to tell you that man still alive and he still got just as much or more regret today as he did when he first lifted up his eyes in hell you know when you think about life you know what does life present to a man I was born in the world people commonly call it a journey of life I've spoke on that you know took a whole series on it recently about a journey and but you know it's commonly called the journey of life and you know as a as a minister and particularly as a pastor paying appointed of the Lord to be a guide you know to my fellow man and I would have never done it had he not called me to it but often in my observations of people I come away wondering if a sense of journey really stands out to them that they really get it that they're on a journey that life's not just happening it's not it's not purposeless and casual that's what the devil would like you to believe but it's anything but you know and I I as I said i i i i recently ministered on it on on it in a lengthy series on our journey and i I must say that I continue to feel an urgency in my heart to cry out a warning still even after taking it as a series and I I've been this sermon that I'm preaching tonight as I said I've struggled with the title I was gonna call it being human I was gonna call it this great struggle I was gonna call I didn't know what to call it but but but but I you know perhaps that that there's this urgency in my heart and we see the things that are happening in the world today and you know perhaps it's because that journeying Humanity is nearing the final end of all journeys of all journeys think of it friends all journeys are coming to an end of all the journeys that have ever been in the earth above a man or a woman who lived how what number would you put on it I wouldn't even know where to start how many zeros you'd have to put on how many human experiences as a journey men and women boys and girls have went and some were shortened some were lengthy and some are good some are bad some are happy some were sad I mean you know of every kind but to think that here we are at a time when all journeys of all humanity are coming to their end and soon I believe it is soon the final stop as it were on this long road back to redemption a 6,000 year pilgrimage of humanity 6,000 years he's been on a pilgrimage and finally as a specie the end is in sight and full redemption of God's plan that he's been working on for six millennia that's a long time it's coming to a climax not when you expect it not when you want it but you know when it's going to happen when it's time when it's when it's time is up you say brother Jason how can you know when that time is what you really can't you really can't know when that time is but you can prepare because you know it's coming I mean whether or not say well I don't know when the window the the I don't know when they're catching away the body changed the rapture the church I don't know when that's gonna happen who said you're gonna make it that long well said well I'm I'm young you might not make it home tonight brother branham centers Ben Ben Ben Ben many a 16 year old you know who never made it you know and and so never never made it back home and and and we can prepare because we do know it's coming there are certain signs now we can do that there are certain signs that we've looked for and we've looked for you know for what we think really is a long time it's really not been a long time but but but it has been sufficiently long that the Bible prophesied the Spirit of Christ upon Simon Peter prophesied expressly that in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust would come him among the world they would start to move throughout the world and say where is the promise of his coming for since the father's fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation but one thing is very different and the signs that we're seeing today one thing is very different indeed in that this is the first time where all of the in time signs in the Bible are all happening at once all of them they're all happening at once Jesus you know piecemeal almost it'll be wars and rumors of wars and there'll be earthquakes in diverse places and we've had all of these things and you know but but now you see all of the signs of the scripture and that makes it a unique our friends you know let us let us not be you know the these signs that we see are are unfolding all together and and and if at the very least they're they're a harbinger that are telling you know that I'm telling you they're urging you to prepare get ready because something's happening the world right now and everybody all from the from the top of the political chain all the way down social media news media everybody constantly dropping the word unparalleled unprecedented unprecedented unparalleled never before in history you cannot look out on the world right now I remember when covin nineteen began nearly what eight ten weeks ago and I I stood right here in this pulpit and I said look it doesn't even matter you know because and that one brother wrote that wonderful piece about wave after wave watch this is just a dress rehearsal what are they gonna do when wave after wave is coming and I said listen understand this here you got a comb and you got a nice a global pandemic I understand behind this when there's five coming behind those five there's five more and now here we are we can't even get out of a global pandemic and our nation nation is in such turmoil and there is no way to fix it because you're dealing with unregenerate men who won't take what a brilliant master builder Christ must be think about the the level of the mind that it would take to create a millennial world with a government and set in walls and regulations for functioning that literally completely treat everybody with equality and justice for all and completely eliminates conflict completely runs perfectly in harmony and the world will be filled during the Millennium with untold numbers of people that besides the bride there be heathens down through ages raised up to hear the gospel please we don't know what it's all gonna be there brother branham only gives us little tidbits it's a honeymoon you're not supposed to know all the secrets but but think of the of the level of mind you would have to have think of how brilliant Jesus must be and then we struggle to let him make our decisions we struggle to let him tell us what to do a mine so brilliant he's going to pull off something that mankind in 6,000 years with every kind of government imaginable has tried and failed they are urging you these signs that are all happening together are urging you to prepare for a change because you are indeed very much on a pilgrimage much like much like Christian in the pilgrims progress same as him you you you stand at the at the trailhead that leads to celestial City and very much like Christian you you look down the trail and you you see many pathways and you must choose the right one you're not left you know to your own wits thankfully your sir applied with detailed instruction and much encouragement from evangelist evangelist I love evangelists in those stories with my favorite characters cuz he just comes out of nowhere with the answer and here they are in an impossible situation let me take some friends I love that God has evangelist in his fivefold ministry who can come in and where we got up situation and sometimes even as a pastor I can know something's wrong I can't I can't sniff that out I need I need a bloodhound I need evangelist to come in and I'll sit back and watch and you might not even know it and he might not even know it I'm sitting back taking notes waiting to figure out where supports the problem and that evangelist will go right to it and I'll go hmm okay got it you know it's it's amazing to me that God gives you know Christians in our pilgrimage with all of these choices and all of these wrong paths and only one right path and then God supplies you with ministry and pastors and prophets and apostles and evangelists and teachers and so often times we don't even avail ourselves of them we come to church when it's convenient when it works out good and I think I can get there we we we pull our preachers for their opinion so we can think about it and you know and and right you can give it right out of the Word of God and that sometimes I can give something so direct out of the Word of God and I can see the person trying to decide Wow and I use it only saying another thing I've learned over 25 years doesn't do me any good I can I can lead a horse to water I can do that but I cannot make a horse drink it drink it or he won't you won't make him which path will you take you warned in plain language the consequences of going off the correct path so which path we take which path will you decide you're on a pilgrimage you're on a trail that heads to celestial City which path you're gonna take you've been given the word on which path but which one are you gonna choose just cause the word says it'll mean you're gonna do it what will you decide or you know as as men mankind always seems to want to know what are the stakes well what were the stakes for Christian and pilgrims progress only his life no big deal only his life that was the stakes wrong decisions could could make his journey a very short one ending in tragedy and you know I would say to you all you're on this path were on this pathway now and even if and I've seen people do this and but I've also seen it come to its to its end like Solomon said it would and even if you're any ball to skirt the edge and cheat death and cheat calamity your whole life you know at best it'll be a life with ups and downs and you'll be dogged by uncertainty you'll always be crashing and trying to pick yourself up friends Oh God has given us a way a path an understanding of what these signs mean of what the time of the hour is and we ought to be preparing ourselves I feel an urgency to say we're not quite prepared as we think we are and we need to be prepared more I feel it I feel it for me I feel it for you you can either think I'm right or wrong on that but I'm positive I'm right what are the odds preacher what are the stakes what are the odds mankind always an odds maker always weighing chance against skill either folding or doubling down on his stubbornness on his decisions always figuring always calculating always scheming to beat the odds surprisingly surprisingly enough men come to the end and and and they discover that the odds were always a hundred percent and life wasn't a game like satan had him thinking it was choose the path that God freely offers to show you you gain eternal life choose the contrasting path you miss the grandest payoff imaginable all with absolute certainty 100% you're born with a fallen mind that's what the Bible teaches us you're not even qualified that's why Jeremiah would say it is not in a man to discover his own way he's got to have a guide because you're born with a fallen mind and you're completely unqualified to find your way home your mind is enmity against God it can never the Bible teaches that it can never agree with God's Word you're not going to outsmart him you'll have to surrender to his lordship over your life you know people when we talk about people who believe a lie and are damned by it that's a prophecy of the end time people that's a prophecy of the overwhelming majority of humanity at the end time that they will believe a lie and be damned by it so I mean it's going to take almost everybody it would even take it's so strong it would even take the elective if that were possible that's how strong it is only election keeps it from from taking you see but we find that that it's it's not people you know people don't just let me make this real clear people don't just believe false things and are damned by that that that's not the kind of God we serve in Jesus you know Jesus wasn't even like that when he was here it wasn't you you can't disbelieve what you don't know and since sin is unbelief you understand then then then it's not it's not believing false things that that are the damnation of people but when you read the life story and the teachings of Jesus you find that the lie that damns souls is that they make a willful choice to believe false things about the truth that God reveals his truth unmistakeably and he has and people make a choice to reject that they cannot deny its validity not in the Bible anyway and you know they they they they you know they they pass on and propagate distortions of falsehood about the truth they're like they're like experts of the law in the Old Testament though the King James Bible called them lawyers because they were experts in the law there were scholars theologians of the law and Jesus said woe unto you because you stand at the door of knowledge you yourself won't go in and you hinder those who would go in and we find that they pass in this age they they pass on and they propagate distortions and falsehood and you know and and and and oh my you should see them when they when they get among their base and they you know they they it works great at their pep rallies those things they call church services not church services they're just pep rallies a pet we've got a pep rally going with their base and and and and and and it rallies them oh my they they they get on there and they they freely you know say intentional I just heard a preacher recently who was a former wonderful minister in this message and now is on the internet did you know talking about this is false and that's what I'm saying my goodness you actually no way in Brenham didn't teach that you actually know that that makes you the worst kind of a hypocrite you're a snake you're not you're not worthy of living because you're you're saying that to an unknowing world who don't know what he taught and you know he didn't teach that but you're propagating that he did and you're saying oh we gotta be against it now and you're you're you're not against what he actually taught you you you can't disprove what he taught not buy your Bible oh my rallying sure rallying yes rallying sure reality no no claim they they've been around the world all it does is rally a false faith friends you know you can work up a human faith in an emotion and think it's true and be completely deceived by it and claim they've been around the world and you know and they they saw problems in the message in this country and in this country and in this country and the problems here and problem there and differences here and difference there an argue here and argue I'm going hold on excuse me excuse me I've been around the world - where were you going you weren't going to the churches I was going to I've been on their own six continents preaching this message for almost thirty years you weren't going to the churches I was going to cuz the churches I was at in Germany and in Africa and Asia and in the islands and all over the all over the world throughout Europe I'm gonna tell you I found people who were had the power God who had holiness in their lives who had the Holy Ghost and fire burning who all were unified agreement of amen to every word of God it's all it's all an intentional misrepresentation I don't even I don't even recognize the message they describe so vulgar ly to an unknowing world the ministry brothers you know the ministry brothers working here with me brother Matt and brother Jason that that's one of the reasons we're we're exploding on the on the scene with our podcasts we've been purchasing equipment and getting trying to get a studio built we're trying to get out there and set the record straight set the record straight I'm tired of the misrepresentation I have no argument with them I'm commanded in the Bible not argue with them at all that's not how you handle gainsayers you know how the book you know how Paul told Titus to handle gainsayers preach the word just preach the word and that'll silence the game-saver hallelujah oh my they know they read the same Bibles that I do they show themselves to be complete hypocrites they know the teachings and doctrines of this message are squarely on the scripture they know you can't disprove even a single one William Branham already vetted that he stood there with 300 ministers who tried to trap him and brother Brandon gets up and says now I heard every one of you get up and say doctor this and DD and PhD and lld and all these things he said I haven't even got a seventh grade education but I challenge any of you to bring your Bible and come stand by my side and disprove any one of the doctrines that I teach bunch of quiet and quiet as mice not just scared mice brother Branham says what are you afraid of he said you're not afraid of me said but you're afraid of that light I'm gonna tell you something they were very very careful in the presence of that light oh I don't want to get off on that I'm it's it's it's they they know that the message is squarely on the scriptures what it does is it steps squarely on their toes because they can't have the life they want and get it to go through the scriptural filter you know Jacob gained a keen sense that he was on a journey why don't you turn with me to Genesis chapter 28 give me that on the board get Gideon Genesis 28 and let's start at at verse 10 I got a little bit of time left so I got about 17 18 minutes so let's get this Genesis 28 my what uh what an amazing and Jacob you know he's gonna be realizing a lot of these things even when he's still a shyster has it even become to his conversion yet he's going to go on a long journey but watch what's what happens to him and Jacob went out from Bayer Sheba and went toward Haran and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the Sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it and behold the Lord God behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the god of Isaac the land whereon thou liest to thee will I give it and to thy seed and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed and behold I am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest and we'll bring the again into this land and I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to the of and Jacob awakened out of his sleep and said surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not and he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of God and this is the gate of heaven and Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillow set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it and he called the name of that place Bethel but the name of that city was called Luz at the first and Jacob vowed a vow saying if God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go I will and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on so that I come again to my father's house in peace then shall the Lord be my god and this stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God's house and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give thee the tenth unto thee this is two hundred and seventy years before the law of Moses and Jacob is aware that he's he's on a journey and God comes down to commune with him and he wakes up and he he has a fear of God and that's a good thing to have is a fear of God you know - it'll it'll say I don't want to be afraid of anything it's not brother I'm said not a fear that he'll hurt you it's a it's an it's an awesome admiration and a fear that he's so powerful you want him as a comrade you want him as your Lord you want him as a friend you're you're destined to do anything that will displease him and Jacob is going on a journey and look Jacob is saying Amen - everywhere the Lord said I'll go with you and I'll stay with you and I'll prosper you and I'll even bring you back here which meant now he can't even die because the Lord's already said you'll go and I'll be I'll never leave and I'll bring you back here so no matter what it's gonna happen over here he's got a purpose he's got a journey and God already sees the end of it and Jacob is already saying Amen I'm gonna say a man to every word and he's made me this promise and he's made me that promise and if he keeps all of that then he's gonna be my lord he's gonna be my god there's going to be a church I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna everything that I look at is gonna have a holy observation about it he's gonna give God a tenth of all that God gives him back now you notice something here's an interesting thing that Jacob learned on his journey it's funny that every man that ever comes into contact with God like Abraham or Jacob for whoever it is they're always giving him a tenth of everything they have it's like the thing to do when you get near God and and butBut don't don't don't think of it as some regulation cuz you're missing the beauty this is part of Jacob's worship Jake look at what he's doing he erect a stone and pours oil he's in the church service he's worshiping God and he's giving God his vows he's making he's pledging his heart and and he's saying here's one of my pledges that of everything you ever give me I will give you back the tenth do you know why people don't give God back the temp so often when they don't is because they worship other things they worship other things when Jacob gave the tenth to what he worshiped amen he's on a journey he realizes God has got control of his life and he wants it that way and then he the Bible says in 29 verse 1 then Jacob went on his journey and came into the land of the people of the east so Jacob arrives at Laban 's house and-and-and-and in an integral part an integral part of the journey that God has planned for Jacob here it is going to be the struggle that's of the plan that God is going to use that that's an integral part of the journey the struggle you know it's it's incredible that people you know sometimes you know you people who don't gather who don't even go to church at all or very rarely or you know as as we've been hearing preachers saying I've heard brother dig Satan heard brother Donnie saying I probably said it you know this pandemic is probably going to take people who will never come back to church never will made a decision that they're better off not coming and and lose sight but oh well you know to come to that church right there's a struggle and their struggle I'm like yeah you think that's by design you know you you you you know people who don't gather together for the benefit of having to be a part of a group and go through the struggles there's there's people you're gonna be in church near who are gonna really cost you a struggle you're gonna really struggle being around some people you know what it's good for you this say lord thank you for your servant who causes me to struggle you know but I mean if you spend your whole life and there's no running I'm talking about a journey now tonight you still with me come on I still got a few minutes you know no no running into negative experiences with other people and having to rise above it see having to learn the lessons no learning no learning to love and to forgive and to move forward together we're moving forward together we learn to love one another we learn we we live we love we forgive we fool forward hallelujah I'm glad it's that way I feel sorry for people who won't go that way because they they don't want the struggle it's a sad part of my struggle as I said as I opened up being a chosen of God to be a leader of men not something I would have never chose for myself but it's a sad part and my struggle to have to watch watching people who are under my care people who who won't commit to a few hours a week for the sake of their most valuable investment their soul and the souls of their loved ones and won't commit a few hours a week for the most valuable treasure they have when you're called of God to be a guide to other people over the years you see the product of decisions that are made by those under your care now on one side on one side seeing those who start out young making Word decisions in their lives and and and and and word decisions for their growing families and oh my it gives you such a sense of fulfillment such a sense of euphoria such a sense of accomplishment it it makes your spirit soar because you get to see the crop come up and flourish and then the beauty of that is I've been doing it long enough now that I've got to see many of them start now young and they mate word decisions and they started a family and they had a family with word decisions and now that families rose up and making work decisions and the cycle goes on and on that's the most wonderful fulfillment as a pastor I could ever have to see the product of the decisions coming out in God's favor the joy is almost indescribable but then on the other side you see decisions that are taken against the Word of God you you want them so desperately to soar like Eagles you want them to soar like Eagles and yet you have to stand to the side and watch helplessly as lives spin out of control and crash into the valley floor below it can be a sense of loss so deep you you never get over it really you see them in public and it all comes back I'm glad tonight that you know you might not understand that it's it's hard for me to express that brother branham and birth pains he says sometimes I I criticized the condition that we've gotten into he said that doesn't mean to any certain individual it's just the message I wish that it wasn't mine to give it tears me to pieces see because you you you see people they get too high-minded above the word and being spiritual minded in choosing the word you know choosing the the path of the word is so often abandoned there the Bible says that there is a way proverbs 14 you don't have to turn to it proverbs 14:12 there is a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death and you know a lot of times friends what you what you think is a better path you know is wow how do i how do I say this a lot of times it's the devil playing you off of your inner secret desires and your desires of self-will and the selfishness of wanting your own way you know brother Branham talks about his nephew that should have never got married I've met men like that so they never got married I said oh never because you get married you're gonna have children and and you weren't you should have never you don't treat the wife right you're never going to treat the children right now I've met men that were so self-centered they should have never gotten married and you know it's a wonderful thing when God finally gets ahold of their lives but sometimes they can go a very very long time like this rich young ruler and and just constantly choose what they want so bad you know young people you understand the devil will play you he knows those inner weaknesses that you have he knows you're born with a mind contrary to God and he'll play you don't get played by the devil he's a master at it he's a master at it take your own a journey you're on a path you're trying to get home the celestial City choose God's Word choose God's Word every time you always come out right I mean I mean look all we can do all we can do let's just be honest about it all we can do is all we can do all you can do is just be humble and try your best and God's gonna have to save you God's gonna have to get us home I can't get me home you can't get you home he's gonna have to get us there all I can do is do my best but mine let me have them sealed to do my best and do all I can do because I've even seen God listen friends if you choose his word you're in such a wonderful place God is so loving and so kind I've seen God take those people that I was worth - a minute ago who made lifetimes of wrong decisions and your heart is aching and your heart is breaking and you see them do it and you see them the byproduct of and you see the product of the decisions and you weep as a shepherd but I've seen God come back when I thought there was no chance Oh God rich in mercy and reach a hand way further than I ever thought his hand could reach and grab ahold of and pull him back and go in and bring their children back and restore their home all we serve a wonderful powerful God who would not want to put your whole life into his hands tonight he has the best intentions for you he only wants you to live forever in a perfect world and give you everything and make you like unto him what an opportunity don't pass it let us not fail to prepare ourselves get serious every biblical sign of that is a harbinger of the end time is all happening at the same time start start making God's Word your priority make this number one and make it so high above number two it's not comparable start worshipping God in all your life what brother Brandon talks about you know you can adulterate ah prostitute God's prostitute your time so there's more than just physical sexual adultery he said you can prostitute your time that you owe to God and you prostitute and give it to every other kind of thing that all it does is poison your mind and make things hard on you I'll choose life friends choose life friends choose life choose life we serve a powerful God a loving God a God of power III I've stood here tonight I've I feel like I've almost preached my ownself under conviction I say Lord let me have a fresh start tonight how many want a fresh start tonight why don't you stand up all over the building and say oh brother Jason I wasn't expected on a Wednesday night well here we are anyway it's a Wednesday night and God's got your number how many wanted us raise up hands and say Lord God of heaven the Lord God of heaven put me on the right path show me the Lord the way forward give me the courage and the strength to walk in your ways to abandon once and for all Lord hear me to abandon me every man and woman boy and girl have the wherewithal to say tonight I choose the path of the word and I let go and turn loose let let sin drift away from you turn it loose let it go turn to Jesus open up your heart and mind to him say master come in and be the Lord of all my life of all my life let me have my musicians and why don't you go ahead it's already 8:30 and start gathering try your best to gather distanced with some
