[25:22] that smile off his face but I doubt
[25:25] it amen praise God we're going to
[25:28] invites you right to Genesis CH 12 this
[25:31] evening greet in the name of the Lord
[25:33] and we're looking forward to what God
[25:35] has here for us I want to just while
[25:37] you're
[25:38] turning um just kind of comment um just
[25:42] kind of uh just to kind of give you a
[25:44] little bit of an inside inside
[25:47] information you know on the decision we
[25:50] had to make Sunday to cancel the service
[25:53] and you know I we have to do that from
[25:56] time to time you live along the ocean
[25:57] storm can come in from any direction you
[26:01] know they can come in off the ocean they
[26:02] can come up out of the Gulf of Mexico
[26:04] this one happened to come from west to
[26:06] east amen so thanks a lot California or
[26:09] wherever it came from but uh you know
[26:13] those decisions are just never easy
[26:15] because we like being at church I like
[26:18] coming to church I don't like not coming
[26:20] to church amen and so um but you know um
[26:25] I would just say you know that just
[26:28] appreciate the the anguish that the that
[26:31] the team of officers that I always
[26:34] confer with to make a decision like that
[26:36] I never make that decision arbitrarily
[26:38] it's ultimately my responsibility to
[26:40] make the call but I but I always involve
[26:43] the team of officers um and we
[26:46] deliberate we'll go back and forth and
[26:48] sometimes we'll spend all day talking
[26:49] about it watching the patterns and uh
[26:52] sometimes we go I think we'll be fine
[26:54] and um but you know when you're under a
[26:57] direct
[26:59] uh
[27:00] warning from the authorities and um I
[27:03] mean there's there's really no decision
[27:05] to make that you can't I would never
[27:08] gather people under a direct warning of
[27:11] imminent danger in nature nature can can
[27:14] turn very violent very quickly Amen
[27:17] brother Bram talked about that you know
[27:19] the oncoming storm and how that that one
[27:21] man with his family responsible for his
[27:24] family did not take uh precautions and
[27:27] and and live up to the responsibility
[27:30] that he should have and of course the
[27:32] sermon was about way more than that
[27:34] because then brother brandham turned the
[27:35] tables everybody agreed with that they
[27:37] go yeah that's what everybody should do
[27:38] and he said okay well you've got a a
[27:42] responsibility there's an oncoming storm
[27:44] what are you doing about it to prepare
[27:47] and so um so that was a a nice segue
[27:50] that the prophet used there pretty
[27:52] crafty and uh preachers are impressed
[27:54] with stuff like that amen so I just
[27:57] wanted to make that kind of comment to
[27:59] you uh Sunday and and you say well but
[28:02] nothing happened praise the
[28:04] Lord don't ever look at that like wow we
[28:07] could have came to church well I'm not a
[28:09] prophet the Lord didn't come to me and
[28:10] go listen if you ask me to turn this
[28:12] storm away I will I mean I believe he
[28:15] will but nobody Gabel didn't come to me
[28:18] you know Sunday morning I would have
[28:20] loved that I could have I could have
[28:21] said hey everybody don't worry I had a
[28:23] visitation this morning we're going to
[28:24] be just fine I'm not a neither a prophet
[28:27] nor the son of a prophet prophet and so
[28:29] Angels don't tend to tell me things like
[28:31] that and so uh we just have to go with
[28:34] the best available information that we
[28:36] have and uh sometimes you know I'm it's
[28:39] not only the officers but we have
[28:40] members of law enforcement brother Kevin
[28:42] has always been over the years very
[28:44] fateful to give us the latest cutting uh
[28:47] Edge technology that the county is
[28:49] receiving from the state and from the
[28:50] feds and so those kind of things but hey
[28:53] like I say so for those of people who
[28:55] might have been streaming looking for us
[28:58] this is a coastal city amen we love our
[29:00] little Seaside town but sometimes uh the
[29:03] weather can turn on us and we just can't
[29:05] take a chance the Lord has always
[29:06] protected us 30 years running since I've
[29:09] been here and even our testimonies even
[29:11] before that um brother Charles that's
[29:14] right brother Charles remembers when
[29:15] Hurricane David come through here I
[29:17] think it was in the 77 or 78 someone run
[29:20] in there brother Charles if I'm not
[29:22] mistaken and uh the brother John Keith
[29:25] told me one time he said that uh they
[29:27] were pray in because it the storm was
[29:30] named David they were praying for the
[29:32] sure mercies of David and and so that
[29:36] storm which was going to Bullseye Buford
[29:39] right as it came right as it came it
[29:42] inexplicably lifted High into the
[29:45] atmosphere went over the city came down
[29:47] in behind it and carried on and the
[29:49] newspaper the next morning in Buford was
[29:51] missing hurricane so you know we've had
[29:54] stuff like that happen before where
[29:57] where you know the Lord has protected
[29:59] our houses and we've had neighbors get
[30:01] flooded and our houses be high and dry
[30:03] we've had houses Torn to Pieces all
[30:05] around us and Believers homes we we set
[30:08] some pictures of it one time when a
[30:09] hurricane came through and trees knocked
[30:11] down and the city flooded and all the
[30:13] Believers have always been okay amen I
[30:16] think the worst we've ever had was uh
[30:19] brother George and sister Andrew when
[30:21] they first moved here they were renting
[30:23] a house over in Hilton Head and a limb
[30:25] broke and went and punched a hole
[30:27] through their garage now he say oh that
[30:30] wasn't nothing well brother Josh was
[30:32] laying right under it so we're happy
[30:34] that he didn't get harpooned by that
[30:36] limb but uh you know what so the the the
[30:40] brothers went and and we grabbed some
[30:43] chainsaws and ladders and tarps and and
[30:46] I think I was probably crazy enough to
[30:47] lead the charge and I went up the ladder
[30:49] and somebody took a picture we got got
[30:51] him with a chainsaw in my hand I don't
[30:53] do that for a living so and we were
[30:55] cutting that away and we tarped it all
[30:57] up into you know that the homeowner she
[31:00] gave us a missionary offering for fixing
[31:02] that roof until the roofers could get
[31:04] there I think we got like a $1,200
[31:05] missionary offering so to God be all the
[31:08] glory amen we just love him for it he's
[31:11] always kept us safe and protected us
[31:14] amen praise God Genesis chapter 12 I
[31:18] just wanted to kind of say that and um
[31:20] let you know what's always behind that
[31:23] we thank the Lord that he spared us
[31:24] again and uh but there were I believe
[31:27] the last report I heard there was 56
[31:30] deaths from no was
[31:33] 56 uh track tracked tornadoes that CA as
[31:38] that storm was coming across 56 verified
[31:42] tornadoes some of them I think one hit
[31:44] Arkansas was an uh an EF5 is that what
[31:46] they call that and um and so there there
[31:50] were there were uh probably multiple
[31:53] dozens of people that lost their lives
[31:55] and so we thank the Lord for his Mercy
[31:58] for us and sometimes we just have to we
[32:02] just just always know we don't we try to
[32:04] not cancel but we have to be prudent I I
[32:08] would never be able to live with myself
[32:10] if I you know acted in bravado instead
[32:13] of wisdom oh we'll be fine and then
[32:15] something terrible happen we're supposed
[32:17] God gives us wisdom to use amen so
[32:22] praise the Lord but we all stayed
[32:24] Christians we all stayed Believers I'm
[32:27] still a believer amen turn around and
[32:30] look and say I'm still a Believer yeah
[32:32] amen okay well the devil lost then
[32:34] completely so na na na na na all
[32:40] right Genesis chapter 12 I want to
[32:43] continue um and I'm not going to try to
[32:45] preach a Sunday sermon on a Wednesday so
[32:48] don't worry but I I want to take a a
[32:51] fold of what I was going to bring last
[32:53] Sunday and then the Lord willing we'll
[32:55] carry on with it uh in service is to
[32:58] come the Lord willing Genesis 12 so this
[33:01] is our part in The Inheritance part two
[33:05] Genesis 12 and we're going to catch the
[33:07] first three
[33:08] verses now the Lord had said unto Abram
[33:13] get thee out of thy country and from thy
[33:16] Kindred and from thy Father's House unto
[33:19] a land that I will show thee and I will
[33:23] make of thee a great nation and I will
[33:25] bless thee and make thy name name great
[33:28] and thou shalt be a blessing and I will
[33:31] bless them that bless thee and curse him
[33:34] that curseth thee and in thee shall all
[33:37] families of the earth be blessed let's
[33:42] pray father we thank you for your
[33:45] written word now Lord tonight we ask
[33:48] that the Holy Spirit Come and Let it
[33:50] become a Living Word to us give us
[33:52] hearing hearts Lord give us
[33:54] understanding of of everything that you
[33:57] want us to know this evening we commit
[33:59] ourselves into your hands Lord I um have
[34:03] enjoyed Lord studying this thought and
[34:05] been looking at it since early early
[34:07] early before daylight and it just seemed
[34:10] that you focused my attention on a
[34:13] specific um area Lord so I feel very
[34:17] very task specifically driven tonight so
[34:20] I want to get to it and father and then
[34:22] we will we'll take up prayer request and
[34:25] appeal to you for our needs now we
[34:27] commit it to you in Jesus name amen God
[34:31] bless you friends you can be
[34:34] seated want to be praying for some
[34:37] families out of town tonight and um
[34:43] um trusting that the Lord
[34:46] will keep all things under his perfect
[34:48] care we know that he will because that's
[34:51] that's what he does amen amen
[34:59] um one of the things if I don't forget
[35:02] it I really want to uh not forget it but
[35:05] I I just now REM I remembered so I'm
[35:08] going to remember not to forget I
[35:09] remember that I didn't add it to my
[35:11] prayer list and so uh again anybody that
[35:15] has prayer requests make sure you get
[35:16] them to me directly and via VIA message
[35:20] or or or Whatsapp whatever and um and
[35:24] we'll get that but I I wanted to have a
[35:26] prayer request because there's a
[35:28] preliminary chance and it's not it's not
[35:31] etched in stone yet but there's a very
[35:34] probable chance that we'll be able to
[35:36] get brother Abraham here with us this
[35:38] year and so I was sure love that we
[35:41] haven't got to see brother Abraham in a
[35:42] while and uh he is a friend
[35:45] extraordinaire and what a wonderful
[35:47] brother and we've grown to love him here
[35:50] uh at bethl Tabernacle amen praise the
[35:53] Lord and uh he brother brother Abraham
[35:55] and I we always
[35:58] debate and argue over who gets the
[36:00] greatest blessing him I get it when he
[36:03] comes here or he gets it when I go there
[36:04] and I I say well brother Abraham it's
[36:06] going to be the one thing doctrinally
[36:07] we're going to disagree on forever and
[36:10] uh we'll just we'll just have to agree
[36:12] to disagree amen but like brother Harold
[36:15] Becket says we're we're U we're brothers
[36:18] of a different mother but we have the
[36:20] same father amen praise the Lord Genesis
[36:24] chap 12 that we read and um we know that
[36:30] in the scripture and I just want to make
[36:31] this statement as I as I wait in because
[36:33] I I kind of want to set your mind for
[36:35] this in case you're wondering why I keep
[36:37] I don't want to Waffle back and forth in
[36:40] in Genesis 12 you find him being called
[36:44] Abram and then you're going to continue
[36:45] to read that for a while until he gets a
[36:49] name change and the name is changed to
[36:52] Abraham and so we were showing you last
[36:55] time that God adds an H which and H in
[36:58] the Hebrew stands for deity now he not
[37:01] only added it to Abram and it became
[37:03] Abraham but he also added an H to his
[37:06] wife which was Sarai and then it becomes
[37:09] Sarah and so we we realize then that
[37:12] that that that's how God does it because
[37:16] U name changes in the Bible uh represent
[37:20] a an advancement to the next stage of
[37:23] some development of God's word the next
[37:25] stage of character the next level of
[37:27] something God is doing God himself
[37:30] operates that way that's why we've said
[37:32] to you before and the Bible tells us
[37:34] that he he values his word above his
[37:37] name and that seems in in Congress
[37:40] almost like how what does that even mean
[37:42] and uh but you realize that God's name
[37:46] has has changed not that he ever stopped
[37:49] being what he had been but as he evolves
[37:52] in his under in in the understanding in
[37:55] his unfolding then we know that when he
[37:58] uh was that all great self-existing
[38:00] spirit as Elohim uh we know that that
[38:03] was a name we would refer to him as as
[38:06] the self-existing one before there were
[38:08] even angels to worship him before
[38:10] anything even worshiped him before he
[38:12] would qualify for the English term God
[38:15] which is object of worship he was that
[38:18] great Fountain of Divine Life and so now
[38:21] he wasn't the wind he he was a he was a
[38:23] being and so uh we we realized that that
[38:27] we we love to keep all of that straight
[38:29] so that we don't get thinking in into
[38:31] esoteric philosophy and things like that
[38:33] of what God is oh he's just some Essence
[38:35] he's not just an Essence he's a real
[38:37] person and the devil's a real person and
[38:40] if the Tree of Life In the Garden of
[38:42] Eden was Christ well then the tree of
[38:44] knowledge of Good and Evil is certainly
[38:46] symbolic of Satan and so of course we
[38:49] can easily see that the tree of n the
[38:51] tree of life was symbolic of Jesus
[38:54] Christ uh it's the it's the the symbol
[38:57] Moses used to refer to Christ and so I
[39:01] don't want to get too much into the into
[39:03] the trenches of that tonight but I I'm
[39:05] trying to let you know I'm going to go
[39:07] forward just saying Abraham unless I
[39:10] slip and use Abram but I'm going to just
[39:13] refer to Abraham and I'm not getting my
[39:16] timeline out of sequence I'm I really
[39:19] what I'm doing is that um you know
[39:22] because that it's going to reflect can I
[39:25] say it like this Abraham
[39:28] was going to reflect the truer identity
[39:33] of Abram amen that had been in God's
[39:36] mind since before time you understand so
[39:40] so God saw this man before he was ever a
[39:45] man on the earth and so what when God
[39:49] changed it to Abraham and adding deity
[39:52] to his name uh because that that because
[39:55] it's going to bring forth a Christ line
[39:57] a Christ seed and again that's for the
[39:59] weekend I'm not going to go much down
[40:01] that trail at all tonight or else I
[40:03] would we'd be here a while but but we
[40:06] find that that it it was an identity
[40:08] Abraham was an identity advancement just
[40:11] like God went from Elohim and then he he
[40:14] later becomes uh Jehovah and and and and
[40:18] he even says to Moses and he looks back
[40:21] and he says now Moses back in Abraham's
[40:24] day I wasn't known as Jehovah right but
[40:27] then you realize that Abraham you know
[40:30] called the place Jehovah Gyra and and
[40:33] there's Jehovah Shalom and there's
[40:36] Jehovah sit Cano and there's Jehovah sha
[40:39] and so so we see all of these
[40:41] identifications but you realize that
[40:44] that when when the name Jehovah one of
[40:47] its meanings is God dwelling with his
[40:50] family so was he Jehovah when he met
[40:53] Abraham of course he was he was also
[40:56] Elohim but that wasn't really the name
[40:59] he was really known by because all he's
[41:01] got is Abraham one man and out of him
[41:03] he's going to be bring a seedline of
[41:06] Christ and by the time he gets to Egypt
[41:09] and Moses he's got two and a half
[41:10] million members in his family amen so
[41:14] you know and then and then we find that
[41:17] he would take various other names we
[41:18] would know him as mezc and then you
[41:20] don't hear any more of mezc because he
[41:23] becomes Jesus Christ and so so you know
[41:26] and then and we find that the the the
[41:29] one great truth that got locked away in
[41:33] the ages under the ceiling of the Seven
[41:36] Seals was a mystery that Paul taught us
[41:39] that was revealed to us at the end time
[41:42] that there's also a my Jesus Christ
[41:45] there's a Mr Jesus and there's his
[41:47] church there's his body there's his
[41:49] bride and so God unveils himself you
[41:53] know by measure and and as he goes
[41:56] forward here's here's the the real
[41:57] takeaway that I need you to absorb
[42:00] tonight that he always is going forward
[42:04] yes you understand God doesn't stop back
[42:09] up and retool replan refigure
[42:12] recalculate and try it again he doesn't
[42:15] have to try try again his ways are
[42:18] perfect and so he goes forward and he
[42:22] unfolds now the reason that's important
[42:26] so important tonight is because if you
[42:29] agree that that's true then I'm going to
[42:32] say to you that it's true of you
[42:35] also you are to go forward you are to
[42:39] evolve you are to unfold you are to
[42:43] become amen so I just want that Concept
[42:47] in your mind so we know he eventually
[42:50] became Abraham and and we know that the
[42:53] name Abraham would then reflect his
[42:55] truer identity that was in God's mind
[42:59] and you know I mean I
[43:01] didn't you and I I didn't go get a name
[43:06] change when I came to faith in Christ
[43:10] you know when I I didn't get a a a
[43:13] change of my human name to reflect my
[43:16] new character but I was referred to
[43:18] differently before I was called a
[43:23] unbeliever now I'm a
[43:25] Believer before I was a sinner now I'm a
[43:28] saint before I had no righteousness now
[43:30] I do before I was called unconverted now
[43:34] I'm C converted amen see so you know
[43:40] someday um oh my someday friends we're
[43:43] going to get to sit down in heaven and
[43:45] tell our story oh man how we overcome my
[43:50] sometimes brother Kevin I thought to
[43:52] myself sometimes I think I'm going to be
[43:53] in heaven and I'm going to sit down to
[43:55] tell some people my story and I'm it's
[43:57] going to start like this a long time ago
[44:00] in a galaxy far far
[44:07] away and that's G to be
[44:10] true oh my goodness amen let me not be
[44:14] silly tonight but man some things you
[44:16] can't
[44:19] resist last time we read you some
[44:22] excerpts from Brother bram's excellent
[44:24] message titled Shalom and we found found
[44:27] out that uh there is to be excuse me let
[44:31] me make one quick
[44:33] change we found out that that there
[44:37] um is the need when we read those
[44:40] statements from Shalom and I'm not going
[44:41] to read them again tonight we may uh go
[44:45] back over them just a little bit uh on
[44:47] Sunday but one of the things that we
[44:50] found out was that there is the need and
[44:55] the desire of God for you that you
[44:58] become the expression of his word just
[45:00] like Jesus was a further continuation
[45:03] Here I Go Again a further expression of
[45:05] his word he desires that for you and I
[45:07] he didn't he never intended so we came
[45:11] from God we have a representation of God
[45:14] living inside us but God doesn't intend
[45:16] to populate heaven with Fallen Sons and
[45:19] Daughters amen he intends for us to get
[45:22] beyond that and he's even got a body an
[45:24] idea of a new body that I'll have that I
[45:28] won't ever have to come back here and
[45:30] live like this again thanks be to
[45:35] God so we we found out in our in the
[45:38] Shalom message that that there is a need
[45:41] to become part of God's word by
[45:46] believing it and surrendering to its
[45:50] guidance and its direction for our lives
[45:55] and you know if God used continuing
[45:59] expression of his words in the Bible in
[46:04] in his word in the Bible to I to
[46:06] identify himself then then I I I come
[46:11] back to it again because it's such an
[46:12] important Point how how would we imagine
[46:17] that it would be different for his
[46:19] kingdom of saints amen so if he has done
[46:23] that and he has went forward in the the
[46:27] expression of himself and every next
[46:29] advancement was better and higher and
[46:31] more amen he's never gotten less and
[46:34] lower and you understand so even even
[46:38] when he came as a human being that the
[46:41] Bible warns us not to despise the day of
[46:44] small things see because you know every
[46:47] time that that they build a a tabernacle
[46:51] a temple after Solomon's got wrecked the
[46:53] one from the Tabernacle in Wilderness to
[46:56] Solomon's Temple was a massive upgrade
[46:58] but after that one got tore down every
[47:01] successive one was lesser smaller and no
[47:04] Beauty in it till till you finally get
[47:06] to a lowly Nazarene in whom there was no
[47:08] Beauty at all but that was the greatest
[47:10] Temple that had ever been
[47:12] built
[47:15] amen so so again I make the point that
[47:19] if God used continuing expression or a
[47:23] continual unfolding of himself
[47:27] and in and in every continual unfolding
[47:30] of his personage of his personage it
[47:33] always matched his written word all
[47:37] right you agree well then how's it going
[47:40] how would it be different why would
[47:42] people think that Christianity would be
[47:44] less than that why would they think that
[47:47] that that we no longer that we can re be
[47:51] we can live as Christians completely
[47:54] regressed from the way the early
[47:56] Christian Church Church lived that that
[47:58] doesn't even make sense with the pattern
[48:00] of how God does it God is always adding
[48:03] more and more and it's becoming more and
[48:05] more and more and he gets greater and
[48:07] greater and greater and so we're
[48:09] promised here at the end time that he
[48:11] will get so great and that he he will
[48:14] Union himself with a body of Believers
[48:18] and that they will become into such
[48:20] Union in such Harmony The Headstone
[48:23] coming down upon the body that the dead
[48:25] for hundred hundreds of years will come
[48:29] from the grave amen that's not a small
[48:35] thing so the Christian faith then is is
[48:39] far more than form it's far more than
[48:43] habit even good habits it's far more
[48:46] than good church habits it's far more
[48:48] than a better way of conduct it's it's
[48:51] more than pump and Circumstance it's
[48:53] more than form and fashion it's more
[48:55] than weddings and funerals and baby
[48:57] dedications it's more than just you know
[49:00] uh you know uh uh stumping for this
[49:03] political ideology are coming over here
[49:05] for this social issue and deciding where
[49:08] we draw our lines the the the God is not
[49:12] even involved in stuff like that I'm
[49:14] here to tell you every bit of that pump
[49:16] and Circumstance and politics on all
[49:18] side is going to Ash and Cinder and
[49:21] there's going to be a new world here
[49:23] under a new monarch Hallelujah and
[49:26] you're you're you're being actively
[49:28] evolved to be part of
[49:32] that if you're
[49:36] willing there'll be nobody in his royal
[49:39] family forced to be there
[49:41] amen so the Holy Ghost is actually
[49:46] here uh to do
[49:49] more than be a life
[49:52] coach or a an advisor
[49:57] becoming part of God's
[50:00] word by believing it and surrendering to
[50:03] his guidance because that's how you do
[50:05] it because think about what what that
[50:08] means you're allowing the word to direct
[50:10] your speech your thoughts your activity
[50:13] your whole thing that makes up you am
[50:16] you're you're you're surrendering your
[50:19] way
[50:20] forward can I say it like
[50:23] that so becoming a part of God's word
[50:27] involves believing it it involves
[50:30] surrendering to his guidance and to his
[50:34] direction as you are being actively and
[50:37] progressively trained to rule you're
[50:40] here tonight being trained to rule and
[50:43] reign with him amen uh from his throne
[50:47] in glory and this is truly why the Holy
[50:51] Ghost was given to the church to
[50:53] accomplish just this very thing amen
[50:56] it's interesting that people don't want
[50:59] that that level of of um relationship
[51:03] with Christ and and the Bible speaks of
[51:06] people who would who would come as far
[51:08] as a form of godliness but they would
[51:10] deny the real power of the word to
[51:12] effect effectual change in their lives
[51:16] to where you don't just leave as you've
[51:17] heard me say many times you don't just
[51:20] leave a church service affected that's
[51:23] that can that can happen my goodness
[51:26] sometimes s the worship service we're so
[51:29] affected with an a we're so affected by
[51:32] that you saying my goodness I the word
[51:34] is the preaching will be anticlimactic
[51:36] this is so over the top and then
[51:39] sometimes the preaching will come in
[51:41] such a way and you'll get so affected
[51:43] and you'll oh my it'll it'll rise up
[51:45] determination and and by Godly I'm going
[51:47] to do it this time I'm really Lord I'm
[51:49] mean it this time for real I'm tired of
[51:50] the world and all this and you get right
[51:52] out that door yeah amen the the effect
[51:55] is gone yeah and you realize there was
[51:58] no
[52:00] effect you had an effect but there's no
[52:04] effective change to effect something
[52:07] means to effect a change I don't just
[52:10] want to be affected I I want to be
[52:11] changed yes amen
[52:15] amen as you've heard me say once I met
[52:18] Jesus I didn't want to be me anymore I
[52:20] wanted to be him I wanted to be just
[52:22] like
[52:23] him and so as I say this is this really
[52:28] is the the the heart of the matter of
[52:31] what the Holy Ghost has given to the
[52:33] church for and it's to accomplish a
[52:35] kingdom of saints who who own that who
[52:39] absorb it who assimilate it who take it
[52:42] into their bosom and say there's nothing
[52:45] in my arms I bring simply to thy cross I
[52:48] cling Lord take my houses my lands
[52:51] change my dreams and my plans I'm
[52:53] placing my whole life
[52:57] in your
[52:59] hands in doing so when you when you come
[53:03] to it that way you literally open up uh
[53:07] to see and understand God's purpose for
[53:11] us in the Rhythm of Life that is your
[53:15] life
[53:16] amen and so did did you know did you
[53:19] know there's a rhythm that God intends
[53:22] for you to live
[53:23] in did you know that there's a Rhythm
[53:27] that God intends for your life and that
[53:31] that that's what brother Brandon was
[53:33] referring to in the Shalom message and
[53:38] he was talking about you know the great
[53:39] composer and compos this this beautiful
[53:42] piece of music this masterful piece and
[53:46] you've got conductors and You've Got

[54:09] years being crafted and cultivated
[54:12] you've got to learn you've got to learn
[54:14] to be able to read the sheet
[54:17] music and and it and we're not talking
[54:20] about theological degrees we're talking
[54:22] about learning to let this be the guide
[54:25] of your life let this and it's not that
[54:28] I'm just getting good advice oh this is
[54:30] a good advice I should follow this it's
[54:32] more than that then this is just a
[54:35] person in written form but that person
[54:38] wants to be part of you wants to live in
[54:40] you wants to live through you so that so
[54:42] that this comes from Ink on paper and
[54:45] lives behind skin when this is closed
[54:48] for the last time the word will be
[54:50] flesh
[54:53] see so so when we look at like that when
[54:57] you're when you're willing to believe
[55:00] God's word when you're willing to
[55:01] surrender to his guidance and to his
[55:03] Direction and you're willing uh to to go
[55:06] through the training and sometimes it's
[55:08] in church and sometimes it's in life
[55:10] away from church and you're still being
[55:12] trained
[55:13] amen when you're willing to uh to do
[55:16] that you you open yourself up then to
[55:20] understand his
[55:22] purpose to understand
[55:27] the Rhythm he wants you and the beat he
[55:31] wants you to step in amen
[55:34] see there there's a certain part of his
[55:38] great Symphony that he desires to hear
[55:43] you play back to
[55:45] him brother brandham talked about how
[55:48] that the Bell maker you know back in the
[55:51] in the time when you know everything's
[55:53] electronic now but you know but they
[55:56] still have real artisians and Craftsmen
[55:59] and and you know when when they've got a
[56:01] certain Bell that they want it to have a
[56:03] certain Ting they've got to add there's
[56:06] a formula there's a recipe that he has
[56:08] to follow he can't just melt down a
[56:10] bunch of metal Hammer into a bell and
[56:11] it'll sound like that what he wants it
[56:13] to sound it's got to be built perfectly
[56:16] there'll be so much of this metal alloy
[56:18] and so much of that not too much because
[56:20] that'll flatten it out and then over
[56:21] here it'll have a real nice crisp you
[56:24] know and and then and then it gets
[56:25] shaped and gets molded and that way when
[56:28] he hits it it just has that certain
[56:31] Ting perfect it'll set that one there
[56:34] and start building another
[56:36] one and so God orders our lives and
[56:40] orders our footsteps that's why the
[56:42] Bible says that the the footsteps of the
[56:44] righteous are ordered of the Lord please
[56:47] don't don't limit that to just saying
[56:50] well the footsteps of the righteous
[56:52] order of the Lord he's just directing my
[56:54] life he's not just directing your life
[56:57] like like a traffic light God is
[57:00] literally you know that the Bible says
[57:03] Jesus was led of the spirit Into the
[57:06] Wilderness he didn't go there that was
[57:08] 40 days of suffering and trial and
[57:12] tribulation and there's not one of us
[57:15] who would volunteer yeah I'll take that
[57:17] one uh sign me up I'll go 40 days
[57:19] without eating and I'll and I'll face
[57:21] the enemy with his three great
[57:23] Temptations and and I'll you know and
[57:25] I'll and and I'll live among and and I
[57:27] think it's markk says you know Mark
[57:29] didn't record his Temptations like like
[57:31] the Matthew and I think Luke does but
[57:33] Mark says he lived among the wild
[57:35] beasts in the wilderness amen and the
[57:40] Bible you know if you I was just looking
[57:42] at it today or maybe yesterday I don't
[57:43] remember but I was looking at the Greek
[57:46] breakdown of the of the word there the
[57:48] spirit led him into the Wilderness and
[57:50] it and it's a and it's a word that that
[57:52] means literally that Jesus was really
[57:56] forced into it I'm not saying he
[57:59] resisted don't get me wrong he said I
[58:01] I've come to do thy will oh Lord I'm
[58:04] just simply saying that you know even
[58:07] his his Human Side said you know all the
[58:11] suffering that I'm going to go through a
[58:12] Calvary father if it's possible let this
[58:15] cup pass for me
[58:16] nevertheless not my will so he had a
[58:19] human will see and so so so yeah exactly
[58:23] so so so we find out then that that he's
[58:26] LED Into the Wilderness and this is how
[58:28] God molds our lives and shapes us and
[58:32] trains us for the world coming it's not
[58:35] just the footsteps of the righteous are
[58:37] ordered I got a nice buddy he's like a
[58:38] GPS and he keeps me on the straight and
[58:40] narrow it's so much more than that he
[58:43] might he might brother BR said he might
[58:45] commit you to suffering you know like he
[58:47] did job he might commit you to death
[58:49] like he did Paul he may commit you to
[58:51] this that or the other but his love is
[58:53] proven to us an election that he elected
[58:56] me before the foundation of the world
[59:00] and I don't know what all I'll do and be
[59:02] on the other side but he knows but
[59:03] here's what I do know I'm being trained
[59:06] for it yeah amen that's why my battles
[59:09] might be different from yours and yours
[59:11] might be different from the person
[59:12] beside you you say well why did I why
[59:15] did I have to do this and brother so and
[59:16] so didn't have to go through that sister
[59:18] so and so seems to be so blessed what
[59:20] happened to me God must like them more
[59:22] than he does me has nothing to do with
[59:23] that he doesn't show favoritism among
[59:26] people you know the bottom line comes
[59:28] down to it friends that that when you're
[59:31] and only and and that's a point I want
[59:33] to make only when you're it's only in
[59:36] your willingness to follow his word and
[59:41] humanly willing to allow him to guide
[59:45] that's when your your Clarity of purpose
[59:49] will come into you you'll you'll you'll
[59:52] be stronger than you think you can be
[59:55] and it won't be necessary for you to
[59:57] understand the trial you'll do it
[1:00:00] anyway and even if everything turns out
[1:00:03] what looks like it's bad and the whole
[1:00:04] world's falling down around you you'll
[1:00:06] still just when you finally get to the
[1:00:08] end of it if you've got nothing left to
[1:00:10] say but I know my redeemer liveth and at
[1:00:14] the last day I'll see him and that's all
[1:00:16] you can say about it and go to go to
[1:00:18] your destruction or whatever then then
[1:00:20] I'll go there with courage because I
[1:00:22] know he lives and I know the footsteps
[1:00:25] of the right
[1:00:27] are ordered of the Lord and I know that
[1:00:29] I have
[1:00:30] volunteered to be commandeered by the
[1:00:33] Holy
[1:00:39] Spirit God's family are not pushed
[1:00:42] through a pipe or poured into a mold to
[1:00:45] be autoshaped or pressed into some kind
[1:00:48] of an overcomer we overcome by the blood
[1:00:51] of the Lamb the word of Our Testimony
[1:00:53] amen we we we overcame
[1:00:56] they they stood there on that day and
[1:00:58] the Bible says they overcame because
[1:01:00] they love not their lives to
[1:01:03] death I'm here to tell you something
[1:01:05] friends there's nothing in this world or
[1:01:07] this life I would trade for the next one
[1:01:09] coming you can have this whole world
[1:01:12] Just Give Me Jesus you can have this one
[1:01:15] I'll take the next one oh Hallelujah I'm
[1:01:17] so glad to know there is a next
[1:01:20] one this one's so
[1:01:23] broken amen we're doing all we can not
[1:01:26] to save the world you can't save it it's
[1:01:29] Jesus already knew that he tells about
[1:01:31] that he he sent them out two by two he
[1:01:34] it's the same Jesus who told him in
[1:01:36] Matthew 24 that about the destruction of
[1:01:38] the world how it's going to end the
[1:01:40] gospel is not here to save the world
[1:01:41] it's here to save God's family in each
[1:01:44] age out of the world Amen because it
[1:01:46] doesn't matter what happens to the world
[1:01:48] he's coming back to rebuild it
[1:01:53] anyway amen so
[1:01:56] we have faith in
[1:01:58] Christ and the word of this
[1:02:01] hour but I I I need to say to you
[1:02:04] tonight that there is to be
[1:02:07] activity in our faith there is uh there
[1:02:11] is a life according to God's word to be
[1:02:15] lived out by his family in each age
[1:02:19] we're taught that in the word of God
[1:02:22] there's a portion of the word that's
[1:02:24] been laid out these 2,000 years of
[1:02:27] church history have not been an accident
[1:02:31] these 2,000 years of church history is
[1:02:35] not because God couldn't get a church
[1:02:37] perfected he had one perfected and could
[1:02:40] have took them in the Rapture in those
[1:02:41] first that first 20 years Church they
[1:02:43] were they they were perfect they had the
[1:02:45] token they had the abstract title they
[1:02:48] had the the the unveiled word they had
[1:02:50] the mystery of iniquity they had the
[1:02:52] mystery of MDC the understanding of the
[1:02:55] original sin the the godhead baptism
[1:02:57] what the Holy Ghost really is they were
[1:02:59] they were headed but because that Jesus
[1:03:02] had said that accept the seed go into
[1:03:05] the ground and die to biteth alone God
[1:03:07] was never intending to fill heaven with
[1:03:09] just that first church a he wanted the
[1:03:12] second one and the third one and the
[1:03:13] fourth one and the fifth one and the
[1:03:14] sixth one and he wants this one and he
[1:03:16] wants you hallelujah
[1:03:20] amen and so there is a portion of the
[1:03:23] word to be lived out by his family
[1:03:26] there's a there's a there's a piece of
[1:03:28] the Sheep music to be played back to
[1:03:32] him see he loved David for this
[1:03:36] reason and it's in every age and you
[1:03:38] don't have to be gifted you see you
[1:03:41] don't even have to be talented you say
[1:03:44] I'm not very gifted I'm very gifted
[1:03:46] musician I'm not a very gifted Christian
[1:03:48] I'm not a very gifted preacher I'm not
[1:03:50] very talented at hardly anything you
[1:03:52] don't have to be gifted or even talented
[1:03:56] uh because that with the word for each
[1:03:59] age an anointing comes down from the
[1:04:01] Throne of God upon the word and goes
[1:04:05] into your heart and causes it to live
[1:04:08] you don't have to be wildly gifted or
[1:04:10] talented you just have to believe you
[1:04:12] have to be willing to say Lord take my
[1:04:15] whole
[1:04:19] life there's an anointing for each age
[1:04:22] that comes down the prophet taught us
[1:04:24] that comes down on his word for that age
[1:04:26] and it causes it to live in its family
[1:04:28] it causes it to live the word for an age
[1:04:33] is Anointed in that age for his family
[1:04:36] of that age to live the part of the
[1:04:39] Sheep music that is for their
[1:04:42] age our age is unique in that we are the
[1:04:47] oneoff age that will that there will be
[1:04:51] many of us around the world who are
[1:04:54] still alive and remain at the coming of
[1:04:58] the Lord I plan to be alive and remain
[1:05:02] oh I'm here to tell you what are you
[1:05:03] doing tonight I'm remaining I'm a
[1:05:06] Believer and I'll be a believer when you
[1:05:08] see me tomorrow I'll be a
[1:05:11] believer it's not up and down for me see
[1:05:15] so he's got an anointing for each age
[1:05:18] and you know it's it's a sad reality
[1:05:21] that that ministers
[1:05:24] sometimes you know have to face the
[1:05:26] truth and we we pour our hearts out to
[1:05:29] people parents pour their hearts out to
[1:05:31] Children pre pastors pour their heart
[1:05:33] out and and and maybe you know I I stand
[1:05:37] here tonight and I and I say God wants
[1:05:40] to play his Sheep music through you he
[1:05:42] needs you to believe his word but he
[1:05:43] also needs you to be willing to live it
[1:05:46] he because faith is
[1:05:48] active it it moves it does something
[1:05:51] it's not passive faith I don't just
[1:05:53] stand back and go yeah I believe it's
[1:05:55] it's true the devil believes that the
[1:05:59] devil believes there is a God and fears
[1:06:01] and trembles you understand and so he so
[1:06:05] the prophet said it like this he said
[1:06:07] Satan knows what what the will of God is
[1:06:10] he just refuses to do it I'm glad I'm
[1:06:13] not that I'm glad there's no refusal
[1:06:17] from the moment I heard that eagle
[1:06:19] scream there's no refusal in me I might
[1:06:23] not have understood it all but something
[1:06:24] kept taking me forward I got to have a
[1:06:27] little more what are you listening I'm
[1:06:28] not sure but I I never heard anything
[1:06:30] like it and it draws you and it draws
[1:06:33] you and it draws you and you find
[1:06:34] yourself soaring Like an Eagle should be
[1:06:38] soaring you find out how Lord how to get
[1:06:41] up here in this altitude you were built
[1:06:42] for it that's
[1:06:47] right but in some
[1:06:49] people you know that sometimes preachers
[1:06:53] have to sadly look out over an a audence
[1:06:55] I would like to very much like to not
[1:06:57] believe I'm looking at anyone tonight
[1:06:59] but sometimes I've I've had to look out
[1:07:03] at audience and say look maybe you don't
[1:07:05] want that to be true upon you maybe you
[1:07:08] don't want to be you don't want God to
[1:07:12] direct your life you have you have other
[1:07:15] big plans for your life and no parent or
[1:07:18] Pastor is is going to dissuade you from
[1:07:21] your
[1:07:23] goal goals are
[1:07:26] essential there's no problem having a
[1:07:29] goal there's nothing wrong with with big
[1:07:32] dreams dream
[1:07:34] big Prophet said ask big things of God
[1:07:38] see but but but I want just want to say
[1:07:42] that I promise you you will never have
[1:07:46] as big of a plan and as good of a plan
[1:07:50] for you as God has for you you might
[1:07:53] have all kinds of plans but I'm here to
[1:07:55] tell you he's got a much grander plan
[1:07:57] for you and he knows this that he he
[1:08:01] knows he you know and and I and I would
[1:08:04] I I God knoweth him that are his I'm
[1:08:06] glad the word has that seal upon it but
[1:08:09] I just would say this for you tonight
[1:08:11] that everyone hearing my voice would
[1:08:13] know that it is those people at the end
[1:08:18] time who know their God who will do
[1:08:20] great exploits amen amen so you may have
[1:08:25] big plans you may have big dreams and
[1:08:27] you're not about to let the gospel
[1:08:29] Sidetrack any of that I just want you to
[1:08:33] understand that's your choice but just
[1:08:36] know that you're passing on something
[1:08:39] Beyond
[1:08:41] description because this the Bible says
[1:08:44] if you believe the Bible if the Bible is
[1:08:46] to be believed it is the people at the
[1:08:49] end time who know their God who do all
[1:08:52] the great
[1:08:53] exploits say wow this Blue Chip company
[1:08:56] did that this great man did that this
[1:08:59] amount of wealth this politician that
[1:09:01] you know what that means to God not that
[1:09:04] it doesn't even mean that to
[1:09:08] God see so it it is those
[1:09:13] people it is those people and I I like
[1:09:16] to believe I am and I like to believe
[1:09:19] that all of you are who are willing to
[1:09:23] place their short Vapor of a life oh my
[1:09:27] into the hands of one who can turn that
[1:09:29] life into eternal life how about that
[1:09:31] for a deal you come here with just a
[1:09:34] short Vapor you appear for a little
[1:09:36] while you vanish away and and brother B
[1:09:38] said if you if you think you're a big
[1:09:40] somebody he said get you a bucket of
[1:09:42] water here's a great test to blow up
[1:09:44] your pride it's a nuclear bomb to your
[1:09:46] pride get a bucket of water stick your
[1:09:49] finger in it pull it out and see if you
[1:09:50] can find the hole Yeah stick your whole
[1:09:53] stick your whole foot down in it pull it
[1:09:56] out the hole won't still be there I'm
[1:09:58] here to tell you friends there's nothing
[1:10:00] in this world worth losing my eternal
[1:10:03] life over I got a guide that I want to
[1:10:06] be in control I want him in control of
[1:10:08] every aspect of my life I am one of
[1:10:11] those who have decided that on my little
[1:10:13] short Vapor of a life that's here today
[1:10:15] and gone tomorrow I don't I don't like
[1:10:18] that life is that short I'd like to live
[1:10:20] forever and I'd like to live in a
[1:10:22] perfect world and I'd like to have a
[1:10:24] perfect body and there all kinds of
[1:10:26] things I got a long list and I already
[1:10:29] know it came out of this
[1:10:33] book it's those people you may not be
[1:10:35] one of them friends who are willing to
[1:10:37] let God control your life like that but
[1:10:40] it is those people who have lived in the
[1:10:43] rhythm of the word that appear on Mount
[1:10:46] Zion with the king oh my a number that
[1:10:50] no man could number of his Saints down
[1:10:54] all down through the es who love not
[1:10:56] their lives unto death that's your
[1:10:58] family that's my family and I'm proud of
[1:11:00] that
[1:11:04] family this is the place that Paul came
[1:11:07] back from and said the eye hath not
[1:11:11] seen neither hath the ear
[1:11:14] heard the things that God
[1:11:17] has in store for
[1:11:19] them it's never even entered into the
[1:11:22] heart of a man which takes in your imag
[1:11:26] ination it's never even entered into the
[1:11:28] heart of a
[1:11:29] man what God has in
[1:11:32] store for those that love him Paul came
[1:11:35] back from there said I heard things that
[1:11:38] couldn't even they're not even lawful to
[1:11:43] say I've always looked at that and I
[1:11:46] thought you know this is just brother
[1:11:49] Jason when I look in when I when I when
[1:11:53] I consider that Paul would say
[1:11:56] make that
[1:11:57] statement I heard things that aren't
[1:12:00] lawful to say and I thought okay this
[1:12:03] this is a Jew he was a Pharisee of the
[1:12:05] Pharisee a doctor of the
[1:12:07] law he would know what you're not
[1:12:10] allowed to do and say in the Old
[1:12:13] Testament
[1:12:14] Bible and I thought isn't it funny he
[1:12:17] didn't say that I I saw things that
[1:12:22] aren't lawful to be done because the
[1:12:24] Bible is filled with unlawful things
[1:12:27] that aren't to be
[1:12:29] done but in all the things that aren't
[1:12:31] lawful to say the list is very small see
[1:12:35] you're you you you never to take the
[1:12:38] name of the Lord in vain see people say
[1:12:41] oh I'd never use that kind of a curse
[1:12:42] word well excuse me but born again
[1:12:45] believer is not a curse word but if you
[1:12:48] take the name of Christian and you're
[1:12:50] really not a Christian
[1:12:53] right see I'm not saying you're cursing
[1:12:56] God I'm not saying you're use using
[1:12:58] profanity I'm saying you're taking a
[1:13:00] name in vain because you're really not
[1:13:03] that see and you've taken that name and
[1:13:07] that's why a Propet would say if you're
[1:13:09] not going to be a Christian stop calling
[1:13:11] yourself one because you only bring a
[1:13:13] disgrace and besides God would respect
[1:13:16] you more if you just be
[1:13:17] honest God respect you more and and you
[1:13:21] know and and it blows my mind uh when
[1:13:23] when when brother BR talks about how
[1:13:25] that we we bring them into the church
[1:13:27] and we just give them a membership and
[1:13:29] there's no repentance required no life
[1:13:31] change required and they can just
[1:13:33] continue to be as long as they'll you
[1:13:35] know join the church sign the book shake
[1:13:38] the preacher's hand pay tithes and
[1:13:39] offerings uh they it doesn't even matter
[1:13:42] you know and I had I had a young I had a
[1:13:44] young woman you know in her early 20s
[1:13:47] who her boyfriend brought her here to
[1:13:49] this church cuz he liked the preaching
[1:13:50] but she went to the big Golden Cathedral
[1:13:53] over here and she wanted to go back
[1:13:54] there and I said why don't you like us
[1:13:56] she said oh yeah you're are fine people
[1:13:58] she said but over there we can just do
[1:14:01] whatever we
[1:14:02] want that was her words to me she we can
[1:14:05] just do whatever we want I oh my
[1:14:08] goodness poor girl and I I tried
[1:14:11] desperately to try to show her why
[1:14:13] that's not a good thing she was looking
[1:14:14] at it as a positive I said that's not a
[1:14:16] positive that's a negative right see did
[1:14:19] did Jesus do what he wanted he said I
[1:14:22] came to do thy will oh God did he ever
[1:14:25] do what he wanted he he wanted a cup to
[1:14:28] pass from him but he went to Calvary
[1:14:30] anyway see so so so we so we realize he
[1:14:34] did always that which pleased the father
[1:14:38] and so I thought to myself there's only
[1:14:41] very few things that I can think of that
[1:14:42] are unlawful to say but one of the main
[1:14:45] things that is unlawful to say as a
[1:14:48] mortal is to make yourself God and
[1:14:52] that's why they took up stones to Stone
[1:14:54] Jesus Jesus and they said you being a
[1:14:57] man are claiming to be God and he had to
[1:15:00] defend himself you know with a quick
[1:15:01] step in the scripture and say well you
[1:15:03] called the prophets gods and if the word
[1:15:05] of the Lord come to them you called them
[1:15:06] Gods how do you condemn me because I say
[1:15:08] I'm the Son of God and all this and and
[1:15:10] you know and and they they they had no
[1:15:12] evidence at his trial and and you know
[1:15:14] they're they have to be careful because
[1:15:16] the Sanhedrin can't be public it's a
[1:15:18] public trial everybody's listening and
[1:15:21] so they they they know they don't have
[1:15:22] enough evidence to get a conviction it
[1:15:25] never hold up everybody will know it was
[1:15:26] a lie and so they they realize they get
[1:15:29] desperate and and the high priest steps
[1:15:31] forward and says okay are you the Son of
[1:15:32] God yes or no are you
[1:15:34] Messiah and you'd think Jesus would have
[1:15:37] had the human sense to go what are you
[1:15:40] talking about and live to fight another
[1:15:43] day and when Peter suggested that kind
[1:15:46] of a strategy Jesus
[1:15:48] said shall I shall the cup that my
[1:15:52] father has given me to drink shall shall
[1:15:55] I not drink it is Peter is that what
[1:15:58] you're I shouldn't drink the cup my
[1:16:00] father has given
[1:16:01] [Music]
[1:16:03] me you know so so so we realize that
[1:16:07] that the the thing that that Paul is
[1:16:10] hearing is he's hearing beings you can
[1:16:13] see them in Zechariah Zechariah 3 he
[1:16:16] Zachariah was Joshua the high priest in
[1:16:19] representation of the church was told
[1:16:21] I'll give you place among these you see
[1:16:22] standing by John saw them saw sea of
[1:16:25] glass saw the elders saw the Angels saw
[1:16:27] it all saw Mighty Angel strong Angel and
[1:16:30] one seated on the throne that's real
[1:16:33] that's not imagination that's not a
[1:16:34] fairy that's not Disney that's for real
[1:16:38] and he rules from his throne and he's
[1:16:40] really there and he's a real God and the
[1:16:42] Holy Ghost is real in your lives amen
[1:16:46] and he he said I heard I heard things
[1:16:50] said by people that are not lawful to
[1:16:52] say I want to tell you something friends
[1:16:54] I'm not going to dare say Paul didn't
[1:16:56] because there's things prophets know
[1:16:58] they don't tell the people everything
[1:17:00] but but brother Jason when I hear
[1:17:02] something like that I go no wonder
[1:17:04] because if they took up stones and
[1:17:06] brother brandham showed us how when they
[1:17:08] if they took up stones to Stone him when
[1:17:10] he said I and my father are one they'll
[1:17:12] say the same when you say the same thing
[1:17:14] they'll take up stones to Stone you I'm
[1:17:16] here to tell you it might be unlawful by
[1:17:19] the law but under the blood of the Lamb
[1:17:20] of God we are testifying of our identity
[1:17:25] I got a name change I had deity added to
[1:17:28] my
[1:17:29] life that's why we have authority in the
[1:17:32] name of
[1:17:34] Jesus and Paul's Paul comes back and he
[1:17:37] says it's never entered the heart of man
[1:17:40] the eyes never seen it the ears never
[1:17:41] heard it it's never Ed into the heart of
[1:17:43] man the things that God has in store for
[1:17:46] them that love him brother Brandman
[1:17:48] rejected King tells about his trip and
[1:17:50] coming back and seeing that land and I'm
[1:17:53] just going to read this right here
[1:17:54] brother Kenny get ready to come on
[1:17:57] back he says oh my precious friends so I
[1:18:01] gave you what the first church age
[1:18:03] messenger said let me give you what the
[1:18:05] seventh one said oh my friends my
[1:18:09] beloved my darlings of the
[1:18:12] Gospel my begotten children unto God

[1:18:22] explain it to you there's no words I
[1:18:25] couldn't find it it's not found anywhere
[1:18:28] but just beyond this last breath is the
[1:18:32] most glorious thing that you ever and he
[1:18:37] Trails off there is no way to explain it
[1:18:41] there's no way I can't do it he's GNA
[1:18:45] give it the old Notre Dame try I'm here
[1:18:47] to tell you just beyond this last breath
[1:18:50] they're there just beyond this last
[1:18:53] breath is the most glor glorious thing
[1:18:55] that you ever I I can't even I can't
[1:18:58] describe it I I don't have the words I
[1:19:00] don't have the words he said yeah he
[1:19:02] said there there's no way I just can't
[1:19:05] do it but whatever you do friend lay
[1:19:08] aside everything else I'm here to tell
[1:19:11] you something friends that's my part in
[1:19:13] The Inheritance that's your part in The
[1:19:16] Inheritance I'm reading about my
[1:19:18] inheritance and there's no way to
[1:19:20] explain it but I know that just beyond
[1:19:22] this last breath is a world waiting and
[1:19:24] oh my I want to renew my allegiance to
[1:19:28] the Holy Ghost tonight and say Lord God
[1:19:30] take my whole life take everything about
[1:19:32] me lead me and guide me I'm here to do
[1:19:35] thy will oh god let's stand God bless
[1:19:40] you friends brother Ken bring your team
[1:19:42] I'm here to
[1:19:44] do thy will oh
[1:19:48] Lord that is such a profound statement
[1:19:53] because you know I I've looked
[1:19:57] at at the Life of Christ and I remember
[1:20:02] one time years
[1:20:03] ago and I preached a sermon years ago
[1:20:06] this was a young
[1:20:08] man and I thought about Jesus we think
[1:20:13] about him as the Nazarene the 30s
[1:20:15] something year old walking the shores of
[1:20:16] Galilee going about doing
[1:20:19] good but he wasn't always that 30-some
[1:20:22] year old he was 18
[1:20:26] he was
[1:20:28] 17 he's
[1:20:30] 15 he was
[1:20:32] 12 we know he was 12 we found him
[1:20:35] debating with doctors of divinity at the
[1:20:39] temple 12 years
[1:20:41] old and by the time he's 12 years
[1:20:45] old he already seems to have a complete
[1:20:48] Mastery of the word of God so much so
[1:20:52] that the doctors are amazed
[1:20:55] at what he
[1:20:56] knows about the
[1:21:00] word and I got
[1:21:04] thinking when was I know he went
[1:21:08] into the
[1:21:10] synagogue and the Word was handed for
[1:21:13] him to read and he turned to the place
[1:21:17] the spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[1:21:19] for Heath anointed me to preach the
[1:21:21] gospel preach Good Tidings and he goes
[1:21:23] on and on and on and on
[1:21:25] you could tell that he was quite
[1:21:28] comfortable handling this he's quite
[1:21:32] Adept at knowing what it said he doesn't
[1:21:35] even carry it around yet he can quote it
[1:21:37] at
[1:21:38] will see he never had to carry a Bible
[1:21:41] because he was the word made flesh but I
[1:21:45] wonder how old was
[1:21:47] he when he first
[1:21:50] turns to the book of Isaiah and he
[1:21:53] starts reading or he turns to the Book
[1:21:55] of Psalms and he starts reading or he
[1:21:57] turns to the other prophets and he
[1:21:59] starts reading things like all my bones
[1:22:02] they stare at me they wag their head at
[1:22:06] me he reads he was wounded for our
[1:22:10] transgression amen amen and and the the
[1:22:15] wounds for my healing were placed upon
[1:22:20] him he was afflicted he was deserted he
[1:22:23] he was buried among thieves and he's
[1:22:25] reading all of these things I wonder how
[1:22:28] old he was the first time he read
[1:22:32] that I promise you it wasn't in the
[1:22:35] Cradle but how old was he the first time
[1:22:38] he opened up the word and went
[1:22:40] wow that's
[1:22:44] me I don't know was he seven was he
[1:22:49] 10 is that why he was 12 years old in
[1:22:52] the temple cuz he at some point he
[1:22:53] already knew who was he says to Mary I
[1:22:56] must be about my father's business I'll
[1:22:58] promise you he already knew what the
[1:22:59] father's business was at
[1:23:01] 12 do you think it stopped him it didn't
[1:23:05] even slow him down by the time he was
[1:23:08] ready for his ministry he had known for
[1:23:10] decades what awaited him and I'm here to
[1:23:13] tell you something friends that's the
[1:23:14] kind of Courage I want to I want to say
[1:23:16] Lord God I don't know what this crazy
[1:23:19] world is becoming I just know I want my
[1:23:21] place in the word I want to be in that
[1:23:23] great number
[1:23:25] I want to be in that line I want to be
[1:23:27] in that possession that starts going
[1:23:28] upward and brother brandham said that
[1:23:30] dead in Christ will rise and and we
[1:23:32] which your life will be changed and and
[1:23:34] then he said well here'll Come Those Old
[1:23:36] Testament Saints marching marching up
[1:23:38] and he said and we'll fall right in line
[1:23:40] behind them marching oh Hallelujah I'm
[1:23:43] looking forward to that hour friends
[1:23:45] your future is bright no wonder I say
[1:23:48] that to you all the time your future is
[1:23:49] bright that's certain that's going to
[1:23:52] happen in my life in your and my
[1:23:58] lifetime oh I love him don't

[1:26:22] my mind seemed like I could find the
[1:26:24] parameters of it and I just kept writing
[1:26:26] note after note after note Lord It's

[1:28:07] this is the time of the Bride the
[1:28:09] bride's time the bride's age the time
[1:28:12] when the bride is called out of the
[1:28:15] church a bride called out of a church
[1:28:19] that's the time of the Bride this is her
[1:28:22] Time Lord and I pray pray that Lord we
[1:28:25] will live it to the fullest in these
[1:28:27] closing scenes we know not how much
[1:28:29] longer but we know we're
[1:28:32] close we know that you will not wait
[1:28:34] much longer to reveal yourself to
[1:28:37] Benjamin you long to do that Lord you're
[1:28:40] finding that last seed oh help us Lord
[1:28:42] to be diligent to find it to preach the
[1:28:45] gospel with all of our heart and for
[1:28:46] every one of us to be preachers of the
[1:28:48] Gospel through our lived lives the voice
[1:28:53] of our lived lives
[1:28:54] lives it took a while for the bride to
[1:28:57] to catch that
[1:28:59] Lord we we knew there was a shout in a
[1:29:02] voice in a trumpet and we knew that the
[1:29:04] shout was the message it took a while to
[1:29:07] realize Lord As We Grew From an infancy
[1:29:10] and we began to grow and mature we began
[1:29:12] to realize our position and our place in
[1:29:16] Christ that there's a voice that's
[1:29:18] that's in the bride the voice of God is
[1:29:21] in her she has thus saith the Lord or
[1:29:24] she keeps still so that means Lord that
[1:29:26] the voice is a lived life she lives The
[1:29:30] Life of Christ or she doesn't do
[1:29:31] anything she just keeps still in other
[1:29:34] words everything she does is an
[1:29:36] expression of the lived life of the word
[1:29:38] of
[1:29:39] God it's a mystery the world is missing
[1:29:42] they they look for you to come on a on a
[1:29:44] conveyor on a on a big escalator drop
[1:29:47] down you'll come down take everybody
[1:29:48] home oh what a rude
[1:29:50] awakening that they'll find on that day
[1:29:53] when the bride is gone and and a secret
[1:29:54] catching
[1:29:56] away I pray for every heart Lord tonight
[1:29:59] young and old don't let them miss it
[1:30:02] Lord just beyond this last breath is a
[1:30:06] world that's beyond anything the I have
[1:30:09] ever seen the ear hath ever heard or has
[1:30:13] ever even entered into the heart of a
[1:30:16] man there's no words of prophet said I
[1:30:18] don't have words and Paul didn't even
[1:30:20] try to come up with any himself and he

[1:31:41] today amen anybody got a testimony
[1:31:44] praise the Lord before we
[1:31:45] go I'm going to need that mic Kenny some
[1:31:48] fiend has stolen my mic so we're going
[1:31:51] to need this one all right Chris behind
[1:31:55] you yeah so uh last year my company
[1:32:00] contracted a uh job for a a base Air
[1:32:03] Base the air station and it was a big
[1:32:05] School uh commercial project and so we
[1:32:08] had to order some very large very
[1:32:11] specialized equipment um this equipment
[1:32:14] was special order it took about six
[1:32:15] months to arrive and once it got on site
[1:32:18] we realized it was going to be
[1:32:19] incompatible and the problem was my
[1:32:21] distributor had informed me when I
[1:32:23] ordered it was non-refundable so I was
[1:32:26] stuck with a $330,000 unit that I
[1:32:28] couldn't use so I'd been trying to do
[1:32:31] everything I could to find a buyer for
[1:32:33] that unit but because of its specific
[1:32:35] setup and um you know design it was just
[1:32:39] very difficult so the last few months
[1:32:41] I've been faced with this bill to buy
[1:32:43] this unit and uh so we prayed prayed and
[1:32:46] I just said God you know you'll either
[1:32:48] find a job for me to you know use it on
[1:32:50] or you'll buy find a buyer and so two
[1:32:51] days ago I got a call that a company out
