[14:27] much practice time, but these words are
[14:29] really special. So just uh try to enter
[14:32] in.
[14:34] [Music]
[14:43] I traveled down a lonely road
[14:48] and no one seemed to care.
[14:52] The burden on my weary back had bowed me
[14:57] to despair. there.
[15:00] I oft complained to Jesus
[15:05] how folks were treating me.
[15:09] And then I heard him say so tenderly.
[15:14] [Music]
[15:17] My feet were all so weary
[15:22] upon the Calary road.
[15:26] The cross became so heavy.
[15:31] I fell beneath the load.
[15:35] Be faithful, weery pilgrim.
[15:39] The morning I can see,
[15:44] just lift your cross and follow close to
[15:48] me.
[15:52] I work so hard for Jesus.
[15:56] I sometimes boast and say
[16:01] I sacrifice
[16:03] a lot of things to walk this narrow way.
[16:09] I gave up fame and fortune.
[16:13] I'm worth a lot today.
[16:17] [Music]
[16:18] Then I hear him gently say to me,
[16:23] [Music]
[16:26] I left the throne of glory
[16:30] and counted it with loss.
[16:35] My hands were nailed in anger
[16:39] upon a cruel cross.
[16:43] But now we'll make this journey
[16:47] with your hand safe in mine.
[16:52] So lift your cross and close to me.
[17:00] Oh Jesus, if I die upon
[17:05] a foreign field someday,
[17:09] could be no more than love demands, no
[17:13] less could I repay.
[17:17] No greater love has mortal men than for
[17:22] a friend to die.
[17:26] These are the words he gently spoke to
[17:30] me.
[17:34] If just a cup of water
[17:38] I place within your hand,
[17:42] then just a cup of water
[17:46] is all that I demand.
[17:51] But if by death to living
[17:55] they can thy glory see.
[17:59] I'll take my cross and follow close to
[18:04] me.
[18:05] [Music]
[18:08] I travel down a lonely road and no one
[18:13] seemed to care.
[18:16] The burden on my weary back had allowed
[18:21] me to despair.
[18:24] I often
[18:26] to Jesus
[18:28] how folks were treating me.
[18:33] Then I heard him say so tenderly,
[18:37] [Music]
[18:41] my feet were all so weary
[18:45] upon the Calary road.
[18:49] The cross became so heavy.
[18:53] I need the Lord.
[18:58] Be faithful, weary pilgrim,
[19:02] the morning I can see.
[19:06] Just lift your cross and follow close to
[19:11] me. Oh, just lift your cross and follow
[19:16] close to me.
[19:21] Amen.
[19:22] [Applause]

[19:58] [Music]
[20:07] In vain man tried
[20:11] to enter heaven
[20:14] for a door could not be found.
[20:21] Heaven's walls
[20:24] were great and high.
[20:28] All inside were safe and sound.
[20:34] God
[20:36] who so loved mankind,
[20:40] who we made and give
[20:43] bread,
[20:47] knew that to redeem them
[20:53] the price to pay
[20:56] was dead.
[20:58] [Music]
[21:03] No search was made
[21:06] to find someone
[21:10] who would take this dreadful
[21:13] chore.
[21:17] Cuz only one,
[21:20] God's only son,
[21:24] could be heaven's only door.
[21:31] The angels knew once he was gone,
[21:36] a song would not be so.
[21:43] Cuz a door to heaven
[21:46] is of no use
[21:49] unless on earth it's hung.
[21:54] The door was hung at Calary.
[22:01] It's standing open wide.
[22:08] Eternal life is waiting
[22:14] for all who step inside.
[22:22] And what has become
[22:25] earth's greatest game
[22:29] was heaven's greatest
[22:32] loss.
[22:35] Heaven's door was hung
[22:38] at Calary
[22:41] and it hinges
[22:44] on the cross.
[22:47] [Music]
[22:52] He entered this world
[22:54] through a virgin's womb
[22:58] and he felt our pain and strife
[23:04] through the door of death.
[23:07] He soon would go.
[23:12] Our great ransom paid for life.
[23:19] Once inside,
[23:21] the door was sealed.
[23:24] Satan thought he'd won the war.
[23:31] But it's no secret how death was
[23:35] conquered.
[23:37] The king was in the door
[23:42] and the door was hung at Calary.
[23:47] [Music]
[23:49] It's standing open wide.
[23:55] Eternal life is waiting
[24:02] for all who step inside.
[24:09] And what has become
[24:13] earth's greatest game
[24:16] was heaven's greatest
[24:20] loss.
[24:21] [Music]
[24:22] Heaven's door was hung
[24:26] at Calary
[24:29] and it hinges
[24:32] on the cross.
[24:36] Heaven's door was hung
[24:39] at Calary
[24:43] and it hinges
[24:45] on the cross.
[24:49] [Music]
[24:57] Come on, sister Kayine. Man, come on.
[24:59] Let's give her a hand, man.
[25:02] [Applause]

[28:36] away
[28:50] the throne.
[28:53] We crown you down with many ground
[29:00] you
[29:15] Jesus

[29:34] [Applause]
[29:38] Worthy is the lamb.
[29:45] Worthy is the lamb.
[29:50] [Music]
[29:51] [Applause]
[29:53] [Music]
[29:53] [Applause]
[29:54] [Music]
[30:08] Let's take the offering.
[30:11] [Music]
[30:20] Let's just stand.
[30:23] [Music]
[30:25] Come on, brother Luther. Let's take the
[30:26] offering. This just bless the offering
[30:29] off. God bless you.
[30:32] Amen.
[30:34] You know, it's uh Sunday school was
[30:36] talking about faith and your own
[30:39] feelings. And I can remember I was
[30:42] working with a county and I was just
[30:43] kind of in my mind I was kind of down on
[30:46] myself like I hadn't seen what I wanted
[30:48] to see. I didn't think I was living the
[30:51] way that I should.
[30:53] You know when God speaks to you I mean
[30:55] it doesn't matter. You may not remember
[30:57] the date and the time but you know that
[30:58] voice spoke to you.
[31:01] You know when he says that's not what I
[31:03] think of you this morning. That's not
[31:06] what he thinks of you. He thinks his
[31:09] word. You know, there's one thing
[31:11] brother Brandham talked about
[31:14] forgiven your sins, past, future,
[31:18] and present.
[31:20] And um for the human mind, that's like
[31:24] kind of
[31:25] pretty difficult to comprehend,
[31:28] but it's the truth just the same. Amen.
[31:31] And I I appreciate the Lord for that.
[31:35] Let's pray. Father, we love you this
[31:38] morning, Lord. How we appreciate worship
[31:40] and song and just setting aside the
[31:43] things of this world, Lord, looking to
[31:45] you, Father, the author and finisher of
[31:48] our faith this morning. I pray, Lord, as
[31:52] we all desire a closer walk with you,
[31:54] that you would just speak to us today,
[31:57] Lord, one of those voices, that little
[32:00] small voice that, Father, we can get
[32:02] away from. And we thank you for that. As
[32:06] we collect the tithes and offerings, we
[32:07] pray that you would bless the cheerful
[32:09] giver, Father. And Lord, in the further
[32:12] of the service, Father, may we continue
[32:14] to surrender our hearts to you. Speak to
[32:16] us. Draw us closer to you, Lord. We love
[32:20] and worship you, Father. I would like to
[32:22] remember Sister Deborah Lowley this
[32:25] morning. Father, I pray for courage and
[32:28] strength for our sister. Dear God, the
[32:31] enemy comes against us all, Father, in
[32:33] the ways that, Father, he knows us best.
[32:36] But Lord, you went to Calvary for the
[32:38] victory for all of us, Father. And I
[32:40] pray for her. Raise her up before you,
[32:42] Father, claiming in the name of Jesus
[32:44] Christ.
[32:46] Encourage her today, Father. Touch her
[32:48] body, dear God. We love and worship you,
[32:51] dear God, in Jesus' name. Amen.
[32:56] [Music]
[32:58] Amen. Let's put our head hands together
[33:00] just before the word. Amen.
[33:04] Every praise is to our God.
[33:08] Every word of worship one accord.
[33:13] Every praise.
[33:15] Every praise is to our God. Every
[33:20] praise.
[33:23] Every praise to our God.
[33:27] Every word of worship.
[33:31] Every praise.
[33:34] Every praise
[33:36] to our God.
[33:38] Sing hallelujah.
[33:41] Sing hallelujah
[33:43] to our God. Glory. Hallelujah
[33:47] to our God.
[33:50] Every praise.

[36:17] Heat.
[36:26] Heat.
[36:41] [Applause]
[36:50] Who else would we give our praise to?
[36:53] Amen. He's the only one worthy of it.
[36:55] And he's worthy of every bit of it and
[36:57] then some. Amen. And the Bible tells us
[37:00] that we should we should pay him the
[37:03] praises that his name is due. Imagine
[37:06] that you're so amazing that just your
[37:08] name is praiseworthy.
[37:11] Amen. We love the Lord for his greatness
[37:13] today. Amen. God bless. You can be

[38:01] Becky was renowned for her wonderful
[38:04] cooking. Amen. The time we had them
[38:06] here. Amen. I remember one time I was
[38:09] out here on the sidewalk and um it was a
[38:11] Wednesday night and Sister Becky was
[38:13] known for going in to the fellowship
[38:15] hall sometimes on a Wednesday and they'd
[38:16] stay in there and eat and fellowship
[38:18] after church. And I walked down the
[38:20] sidewalk or no, I went into the
[38:22] fellowship hall and sure enough,
[38:27] Sister Beggy was wide open in there
[38:29] cooking
[38:31] and I just I just happened to come out.
[38:32] I was on my way to before going back and
[38:36] and Brother Aaron was our own brother
[38:38] and he was standing there on the
[38:39] sidewalk. I think he's talking to
[38:41] brother Charles. They were in a in a
[38:42] conversation and I just walked by and I
[38:44] just said, "Sister Becky's in there
[38:46] cooking." Brother Aaron didn't even say
[38:49] another word. He just like took off.
[38:52] Just left Brother Charles standing there
[38:54] like, "Wait, what just happened?" And he
[38:56] like immediately just turned around and
[38:58] immediately so I said, "Wow, this
[38:59] sister's reputation precedes her." Amen.
[39:03] Praise the Lord. But we're happy to be
[39:05] having that. And we're going to have um
[39:07] a Saturday night singing and fellowship.

[39:49] was still in quite a bit of discomfort.
[39:51] So, the enemy's fighting, but he can't
[39:53] win anyway. He can't win cuz he ain't
[39:56] nobody. He's already a loser, man.

[41:28] Christina Rose. Wow.
[41:31] Praise the Lord. What a precious jewel.
[41:34] Let's pray.
[41:36] Master, what a privilege it is to hold
[41:39] our little sister Christina Rose.
[41:42] Lord, it just brings back so many
[41:45] memories of the little darlings that
[41:47] I've held up to you over the years. I
[41:50] remember Lord that my mother told me
[41:54] when she was just a young woman and
[41:57] stuck with me and never left me and she
[41:59] said she would hold up her little babies
[42:01] to you and just hold them and lift them
[42:03] up in the air and say, "Lord, I'm not
[42:05] able. I don't know how if if this is
[42:08] going to be successful, you're going to
[42:10] have to come and do it." And Lord, we
[42:13] present her to you today, Lord, as we
[42:16] always do.
[42:18] May you come and raise her, Lord.
[42:20] Father, may you grow her in the beauty
[42:23] and admonition of your perfect will and
[42:26] plan for her. Guide brother Micah and
[42:29] Sister Esther,
[42:31] Lord, in the decisions they will make
[42:33] and the steps they will take going
[42:35] forward. Bless her, Lord. Keep her in
[42:38] health and safety. Father, if there's uh
[42:42] years to come yet, we don't know. But in
[42:44] whatever way, Lord, we look to the time
[42:46] when we'll all gather around the
[42:49] Father's throne all together. And Lord,
[42:52] until then, we will continue, Lord, to
[42:55] bring children to you as they brought
[42:57] them to you in your earthly pilgrimage.
[43:00] We commit her now in dedication to you,
[43:03] giving her back to the one who gave her
[43:06] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Praise the
[43:10] Lord. Amen. What's up,
[43:14] I'm coming up there with you.
[43:19] Okay, that's enough.
[43:21] Amen. God bless you.
[43:27] [Music]
[43:29] Praise the Lord. Let's stand back to our
[43:31] feet.
[43:41] So, um, we're going to, um, continue in
[43:45] our fifth installment of our series.
[43:47] Brother Bob, you popped in right in the
[43:49] middle of a series we've been working on
[43:51] on, uh, we're titling it, uh, modern
[43:53] events again, made clear in prophecy.
[43:58] And I just think that as I've said
[44:00] before, it's a a subject, not
[44:04] necessarily a title, but a subject that
[44:08] has to be, you know, constantly updated
[44:11] because we're not here just to talk
[44:13] about 1960s events. We've got modern
[44:16] events today in a day that we didn't
[44:18] expect to still be here and yet we're
[44:19] still here. So, I think we have to
[44:22] constantly
[44:23] interpret the things that we see by
[44:27] prophecy. Now today
[44:30] I hope to um look into some ancient
[44:34] prophecy and ancient history. And I
[44:36] wanted to say that the reason I'm doing
[44:38] it, I almost decided to break into
[44:40] Revelation 12. And last week I touched
[44:44] on Revelation 18, those first eight
[44:47] verses. Uh, but it just seemed like that
[44:50] I I I kind of had it in my heart to drop
[44:53] back and I've actually made a mention of
[44:55] it several times and I keep promising
[44:56] you that we're going to take a look at
[44:59] the 32nd chapter of Ezekiel which we'll
[45:01] turn to now. Ezekiel uh chapter 32 if
[45:05] you will uh find your place there uh in
[45:09] the Old Testament. And I think I wanted
[45:11] to start uh in Ezekiel. I believe I did.
[45:13] I did indeed. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Ezekiel
[45:16] 32.
[45:18] and we will uh we're going to look uh
[45:21] and we're going to zero in. It seemed
[45:22] like I also maybe thought about um No, I
[45:26] won't. I'll just stick stick with this
[45:28] for today. We might venture into one
[45:31] other passage, but we'll just we'll wait
[45:32] and see. So the reason that I wanted to
[45:37] uh look at this is because
[45:40] uh and this will be important for you to
[45:42] remember
[45:43] is that I want to demonstrate to you
[45:47] that
[45:48] everything is controlled by prophecy.
[45:50] Everything always has been controlled by
[45:54] prophecy. And it doesn't really um I'm
[45:58] not saying that the things that
[46:00] civilizations do and accomplish are not
[46:03] relevant and they're not beneficial or
[46:06] um tyrannical or you know they we're
[46:09] going to read about some nations that
[46:10] were found themselves in the in down in
[46:13] the pit in shol in hell uh because they
[46:18] terrorized the land of the living and
[46:20] they were they were great um they were
[46:24] great uh nations uh in their day and um
[46:32] okay sure will um want to pray a special
[46:35] unspoken prayer request for Sister
[46:37] Rachel's mom Debbie. Amen. We'll get to
[46:39] that momentarily.
[46:41] And so um they they they you know they
[46:44] had contributions to the world. We're
[46:46] going to look at some of those. But
[46:47] ultimately ultimately it's all still
[46:50] going to come down to the choices that
[46:52] they made and that God is paying them
[46:56] the reward they have richly deserved.
[46:59] Right? So, you know, um
[47:02] probably getting ahead of myself a
[47:04] little bit, but I remember a quote that
[47:06] I've got here um from Billy Graham where
[47:10] he talks about uh that God God indeed
[47:14] does pay in wages. And this thing is not
[47:19] cooperating with me. Uh excuse me one
[47:22] second.
[47:26] And sometimes it's not wages that people
[47:29] particularly want to collect.
[47:32] Amen. Um because Billy Graham talks
[47:35] about that God pays but often times that
[47:38] the payment is remorse and sorrow and
[47:43] tragedy and that's the payment that
[47:46] people signed up for and they invested
[47:48] in.
[47:49] See and so we we want to look at that
[47:52] today by the help of the Lord. And so,
[47:54] let me uh switch out here. I'm going to
[47:56] switch to a different uh app app here
[47:59] and see if I can get it to work better.
[48:03] Amen. Aha. Praise the Lord.
[48:10] All right. Ezekiel 32. And we're going
[48:13] to just read um sure we'll we'll include
[48:16] that, Sister Emily. Uh we're going to in
[48:19] we're going to take verses uh two and
[48:22] three is where we're going to start. And
[48:23] then I'm going to just skip along
[48:25] various because it's a lengthy reading.
[48:26] We'll probably read these couple and
[48:28] then we will uh pray and let you be
[48:30] seated. Let's catch Ezekiel 32
[48:33] and verses 2 and three.
[48:37] Son of man, take up a lamentation for
[48:40] Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and say unto
[48:43] him, Thou art like a young lion of the
[48:47] nations,
[48:48] and thou art as a whale in the seas, and
[48:52] thou camest forth with thy rivers, and
[48:56] troublest the waters with thy feet, and
[49:00] foulest the rivers. Verse three, thus
[49:03] saith the Lord God, I will therefore
[49:06] spread out my net over thee. Now, I want
[49:09] you to catch some language there because
[49:13] this is going to be the first of several
[49:14] times you're going to see this the just
[49:17] the God saying, I I will I'm going to I
[49:22] have I did. All right. Thus saeth the
[49:26] Lord God, I will therefore spread out my
[49:30] net over thee with a great company of
[49:33] many people, and they catch it. Catch
[49:36] the catch how definite. They shall bring
[49:40] thee up in my net.
[49:43] There's no ambiguity there. There's no
[49:46] maybe hope. We're going to try see if we
[49:48] can pull this off. You know, there
[49:50] there's there's none of the uh the the
[49:52] Donald Trump we'll see. We won't see.
[49:55] We're we're it's going to be exactly
[49:56] what he said. There's going to be no
[49:58] deviation.
[49:59] All right.
[50:01] Verse uh let's catch 11 and 12 while we
[50:03] have you standing.
[50:05] For thus saith the Lord God, the sword
[50:08] of the king of Babylon shall come upon
[50:11] thee. By the swords of the mighty, watch
[50:14] this. Here it is. Will I cause thy
[50:17] multitude to fall. I will cause this.
[50:21] The terrible of the nations. All of
[50:24] them. All of them. All of them. And they
[50:28] shall spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all
[50:31] the multitude thereof shall be
[50:36] destroyed.
[50:38] Let's pray. Master, we thank you for
[50:42] your word now, Lord. And I'm just trying
[50:45] to settle my mind, Lord. and and and
[50:49] sometimes I I think this morning I feel
[50:51] like much study hath made thee mad. But
[50:54] Lord, I it's it's just it takes it it
[50:57] I've got to have these this history
[51:00] correct. We can't look at it
[51:01] half-hazardly. Everything has to be
[51:03] checked, doublech checked and verified,
[51:05] Lord, because we're correlating it to
[51:07] prophecy. So it it's very important that
[51:10] it be accurate, Father. So we've spent
[51:13] the many man hours to do just that. And
[51:15] so I pray your blessing and be upon it
[51:17] today now, Lord. But of course, we're
[51:20] not here, Lord, to just have a history
[51:21] lesson. We're here to learn of thee.
[51:25] Now, master, we have unspoken prayer
[51:28] request for Sister Debbie, Sister
[51:30] Rachel's mother, and Lord, I don't know
[51:32] what it is. It's unspoken, but we sure
[51:34] do love our sister Debbie, and we're
[51:36] praying for her right now that you would
[51:38] be her helper in whatever the need is.
[51:41] Lord, uh, Sister Emily asked prayer. uh
[51:44] her for her mother who asked if we'll
[51:47] we'll pray. My mom asked if we'll pray
[51:50] for her mother, my grandmother. She's
[51:52] aging and things are hard for her. She's
[51:54] 98 and her name is Annabelle. Master,
[51:57] may we put that petition before thee
[51:59] also this morning that you'd be mindful
[52:02] of these needs now and help us one and
[52:05] all. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. God
[52:07] bless you friends. You can be seated.
[52:24] So I want to catch if you will verses 11
[52:27] and 12 again brother Mark Ezekiel 32 11
[52:31] and 12. For thus saith the Lord God the
[52:34] sword of the king of Babylon. Now you
[52:36] remember that this is what he had
[52:38] threatened. He had threatened Egypt that
[52:41] that I'm going to bring my servant down
[52:43] upon you. We read that as it began to
[52:45] open up. I will therefore spread out my
[52:48] net over thee with a company of many
[52:50] people. And so now he's going to come
[52:52] down and and refine the vision a little
[52:55] bit. And he's actually going to name the
[52:58] nation that's going to do it and it's
[53:00] going to be Babylon. And so we're going
[53:02] to look at that here in just a moment.
[53:04] And uh boy, I I I've had such a
[53:07] fascinating time looking at the history.
[53:10] And and I I want to just give you a a
[53:13] few things as I start weighing in. One
[53:15] of the things that's been notable to me
[53:17] after the first point that I made of how
[53:20] many times God would say, "I'm doing it.
[53:22] I did it. I will do it. This is what
[53:25] shall happen because I've said so." And
[53:28] now he's literally and and you're going
[53:31] to find that that that in these kings
[53:34] and in these nations, we're going to
[53:37] read a list of the Egyptians and the
[53:40] Assyrians and the Elummites. And we're
[53:42] going to read um um s about a list of
[53:46] six all the way through to the uh to the
[53:50] Sidonians and the Phoenetians. And and
[53:53] some of them have are actually events
[53:55] that have already passed. And Ezekiel is
[53:57] identifying the past with a prophecy.
[54:01] Some of them are happening in the
[54:03] future. And he's identifying by
[54:05] prophecy, this is what's going to
[54:07] happen. And he's literally saying, um,
[54:11] I'm going to have a king who's not here
[54:15] yet and maybe doesn't even have any
[54:18] plans to do it, but I'm going to cause
[54:20] him to come down here and sack you. Now,
[54:22] it was amazing because the Lord never
[54:26] sent emissaries from heaven to the court
[54:29] of Nebuchadnezzar to say, "Listen, I'd
[54:31] like you to do this for me. Are you in?"
[54:34] He He's simply saying before before
[54:37] anything has even moved in that
[54:39] direction, this is what I'm going to do
[54:40] to you, Egypt, and this is who I'm going
[54:42] to use. And it's not going to be
[54:44] another. It's going to be exactly who I
[54:46] say. And they're going to do exactly
[54:47] what I say.
[54:48] Yes. Some of them are in the past. Some
[54:52] of them are into the future. Some of
[54:54] them will be, you know, many, many
[54:57] years. Some of them are imminent.
[55:00] They're imminent, ready to happen right
[55:01] at that point. And and and as I made
[55:03] that point to you, that that's what
[55:05] prophets do. They they they certify that
[55:09] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and
[55:11] today and forever. And so that's what
[55:14] that angel, the signifying angel in the
[55:17] book of Revelation, that was his job. It
[55:19] was, you know, you might call him John's
[55:21] tour guide through the book of
[55:23] Revelation. John tried to worship him
[55:24] several times, but he was sent to
[55:27] certify uh the word of God. He was sent
[55:30] to signify and to certify. And so, we
[55:33] realize that this is what prophets do.
[55:36] They they certify the will of God to the
[55:39] people. They signal certain events and
[55:42] they they they look at certain events
[55:44] and a lot of times it's not as
[55:47] straightforward as we would like it as
[55:49] we would like to think that it would be.
[55:52] This is another thing that I have
[55:54] observed in weeks and weeks of studying
[55:56] for this series
[55:58] is that you know we we we look at uh and
[56:03] I'm going to come back to Ezekiel in a
[56:04] moment. We look at at the prophecy. I
[56:08] have a a a slide that I that I want to
[56:11] show and I I probably uh should actually
[56:14] show you that now. Uh let's uh let's
[56:17] bring up my my PowerPoint, Brother Mark.
[56:20] Amen. And then we will and then I'll
[56:22] turn it on here. All right. Modern
[56:25] events again made clear of prophecy part
[56:27] five. So we know that we can go to
[56:29] Daniel 7 and we can read about these
[56:32] four gentile kingdoms. And now here it's
[56:36] a lion and it's a bear and it's a
[56:38] leopard and then it's a a creature. You
[56:41] know, it kind of looks a little bit like
[56:42] a dragon. That's AI's rendering. But it
[56:45] it doesn't say it was a dragon. It just
[56:47] says it was a terrible creature with
[56:48] iron teeth. It he really couldn't
[56:50] correlate. Daniel couldn't correlate it
[56:53] to any known animal. It was no problem.
[56:55] Oh yeah, that's a lion. I know that that
[56:56] that's a leopard. That's a bear. But
[56:58] this other one, Daniel just said, he was
[57:00] just terrible and he was just fierce and
[57:03] he had iron teeth and nothing and he
[57:04] just destroyed everything and he was
[57:06] like he was like walking destruction.
[57:09] And then in in other places, uh, Daniel
[57:11] would go and and they have different
[57:12] renderings. And instead of bear, you
[57:15] might or a lion, you might get an eagle.
[57:17] Instead of a bear, instead of a leopard,
[57:18] you'd get a notable goat with a with a
[57:21] horn. Instead of a a bear, you'd have a
[57:23] ram. And so, but but either way, these
[57:26] gentile kingdoms are what God was using
[57:30] as his measuring line points along
[57:33] history by which he would arrange all
[57:36] the history around it according to
[57:37] prophecy. Now, here's something that
[57:40] that that I that I came to understand
[57:44] more clearly. You say, "Oh, well, yeah,
[57:48] that's right. So I can go from Babylon
[57:50] and then I can go to the Meo Persians
[57:52] and then I can go with Alexander and
[57:54] then I can go to the Roman Empire and
[57:56] it's all nice and neat and tucked in and
[57:59] all is cooperating. But it's not
[58:01] actually when you play out the history.
[58:04] I mean Babylon came from Nimrod when
[58:07] they left the Tower of Babel and those
[58:09] first several kings are listed in
[58:12] history and in the Bible how that that
[58:14] Babylon became a great city state. But
[58:18] then you actually find out that later on
[58:21] after I think their third or fourth king
[58:23] that might take stand correction I have
[58:26] his name actually here but after that
[58:28] third or fourth king then Babylon itself
[58:31] begins to decline
[58:33] and it almost looks like wow I thought
[58:36] that was going to be like one of the
[58:37] world powers that would go all the way
[58:39] and then it would hand off to the Meo
[58:40] Persians but it's not that clean. They
[58:43] actually got got almost usurped by the
[58:47] Assyrians
[58:48] who rose up and live and and and the
[58:51] Assyrians then with Nineveh as their
[58:53] capital actually um became the the the
[58:58] controllers and they it wasn't just
[59:01] influence. They actually kind of came in
[59:03] and threw their weight around and and
[59:05] Babylon basically became almost like a,
[59:08] you know, a sub subjugated country, a
[59:11] subjugated people to the Assyrians. And
[59:14] that went on for hundreds of years.
[59:16] And you would almost think, well,
[59:18] prophecy fell. Well, little did did the
[59:21] Babylonians or the Assyrians or anyone
[59:23] know that after a couple hundred years
[59:26] the Assyrians would then decline and
[59:30] then Babylon would come in and they'
[59:32] reassert themselves and and
[59:34] Nebuchadnezzar's father was a general
[59:37] who took back over and then under
[59:39] Nebuchadnezzar, he was actually
[59:40] Nebuchadnezzar II cuz there was a first
[59:42] one way back hundreds of years prior.
[59:45] And so it's not that his dad's name was
[59:46] Nebuchadnezzar, but a former king had
[59:48] been that name. And so now
[59:50] Nebuchadnezzar, the second one, the one
[59:52] you read about, the one Daniel told him,
[59:54] told him his dreams.
[59:56] Now, now it's a great nation again.
[59:59] And now Assyria collapses
[1:00:03] and ends up in hell
[1:00:05] as a nation. We're going to read it here
[1:00:07] in a second.
[1:00:08] And Assyria
[1:00:11] is not even not even represented
[1:00:15] It's not even represented. And yet it
[1:00:18] was a great nation that that that put
[1:00:20] their foot on Babylon. Who is
[1:00:22] represented?
[1:00:23] Yeah. Amen.
[1:00:24] Say, "Okay, what what does that mean for
[1:00:28] me today?" All right. Okay. I'm glad you
[1:00:30] asked cuz I asked. So listen, friends,
[1:00:34] you know, I mean, they thought when the
[1:00:37] Isuza revival struck,
[1:00:39] Yeah.
[1:00:40] that this is the long awaited
[1:00:42] restoration. Well, it wasn't.
[1:00:44] They denominated and proved it wasn't.
[1:00:47] And then a prophet comes on the scene
[1:00:48] and now he's operating according to
[1:00:50] Revelation 3. He's a messenger to the
[1:00:52] last church age. And he's he's one born
[1:00:54] out of season. And it looks like, you
[1:00:57] know, the rapture is going to come. The
[1:00:58] messenger of the seventh angel is on the
[1:01:00] scene. And later on, we're going to find
[1:01:02] out that that whole movement would boot
[1:01:05] him out, boot the message out. The word
[1:01:08] would open up. The Bible would become a
[1:01:09] brand new book. The seals would be open.
[1:01:12] Amen. Right.
[1:01:13] And then he enters into a Malachi 4
[1:01:15] ministry of Elijah,
[1:01:18] right?
[1:01:19] And so I mean when you when you start
[1:01:21] looking at how these things come to be,
[1:01:25] you go, "Wow, it wasn't just so
[1:01:27] straightforward
[1:01:29] and it had a lot of nuance and it had I
[1:01:31] mean listen, you know, come on. Who
[1:01:35] would have thought
[1:01:37] during the time of the Civil War when
[1:01:40] our whole nation was literally literally
[1:01:43] divided
[1:01:45] and to the to the to the point where you
[1:01:47] have a secession of states that form a
[1:01:49] confederate states and now you've got a
[1:01:51] United States and and California and
[1:01:53] Isuza Street is still owned by Mexico.
[1:01:59] You're going, "Wait, how? Huh?"
[1:02:02] But you see, God's not in a hurry.
[1:02:05] Amen.
[1:02:05] He just going right along. Didn't matter
[1:02:08] that Babylon re, you know, receded and
[1:02:10] then brought back. And Assyria triumphed
[1:02:12] and then they went away. And then Egypt
[1:02:14] is on the scene who also aren't
[1:02:16] represented.
[1:02:17] Yeah.
[1:02:18] Amen.
[1:02:18] Because God just used them.
[1:02:21] And all the while he's he's tracking the
[1:02:24] the lineage of Abraham, moving it
[1:02:27] through. And before that, before the
[1:02:29] flood, he tracked the lineage all the
[1:02:30] way up to uh to Noah. And and and Enoch
[1:02:34] goes in a rapture. Noah goes in an arc.
[1:02:36] You you understand, friends? And and
[1:02:38] then so then so then we come to the
[1:02:40] opening of the seals and all right,
[1:02:42] we're ready to go home. Well, here we
[1:02:44] are almost seven decades later. But yet
[1:02:47] now we can look back and go, "Wait a
[1:02:48] minute. It does kind of make a little
[1:02:50] sense because he was never coming to
[1:02:52] marry a little girl.
[1:02:54] He was coming to marry a mature bride."
[1:02:56] You see? And so, oh, we thought it was
[1:02:58] 1977. And 77 is relevant. It's certainly
[1:03:01] relevant. I'm not here preaching on that
[1:03:03] today, but it's absolutely relevant. And
[1:03:06] and and in in ways that of its
[1:03:08] fulfillment. And and then and then, you
[1:03:11] know, everybody was like, "Oh, well, we
[1:03:13] can't go into the 21st century. It's a
[1:03:15] 20th century message, and it can't cross
[1:03:18] over, and it'll be the the next thousand
[1:03:20] years, and then we got to be in the
[1:03:21] millennium." We didn't. We weren't.
[1:03:23] We're still here.
[1:03:25] Amen. Amen. But I'm still a believer.
[1:03:29] I still get the same results out of the
[1:03:30] book of Acts.
[1:03:32] So I know I'm on the right track.
[1:03:34] There's no question that I'm on the
[1:03:36] right track because I get the same
[1:03:37] results they got in the book of Acts.
[1:03:40] See,
[1:03:41] so you know it uh the the point I want
[1:03:44] to make you in prophecy, I mean it can
[1:03:46] you say, "Oh, well, if this president,
[1:03:47] well, we just lost a pope. Is the next
[1:03:49] one going to be the American pope?"
[1:03:50] Well, I don't personally I don't expect
[1:03:52] that. I do expect that, but not till in
[1:03:54] the tribulation. When I look at the
[1:03:56] quote, Brother Brandham says people
[1:03:57] refer to it looks like that that'll come
[1:03:59] when the bride is gone. I could be
[1:04:01] mistaken. I don't know. We might find
[1:04:03] out next week it's an American. It's an
[1:04:04] American controlling it right now
[1:04:07] in the inter room. He's like the interim
[1:04:08] pope. They don't call him that. Uh so
[1:04:11] I'm not here to get all down into the
[1:04:13] into the grinders of that today. I'm
[1:04:16] trying to give you an overview of
[1:04:17] prophecy that I don't it doesn't matter
[1:04:19] what president or what pope or they're
[1:04:21] going to sw I mean they could swap
[1:04:23] offices for all I know. Uh but so what
[1:04:27] prophecy is still walking.
[1:04:30] It's still walking through the pages of
[1:04:32] the Bible and you're you're moving along
[1:04:34] with it. Say how do you know that? cuz
[1:04:36] God's people always were moving along
[1:04:39] with it.
[1:04:41] And it didn't always come and it wasn't
[1:04:43] always neat and packaged like we like it
[1:04:45] to be.
[1:04:45] Right. Amen.
[1:04:48] You know, but don't I mean, don't don't
[1:04:52] make God put you in a re unreasonable s
[1:04:54] trial to get you to stop reasoning.
[1:04:57] Remember what he did to Abraham? Put him
[1:04:59] in an unreasonable trial just to get him
[1:05:01] to stop reasoning. Gave him an
[1:05:03] impossible question. See? So, all right.
[1:05:07] Now, let me let me if we can go back to
[1:05:11] Ezekiel 32.
[1:05:14] So, we read in verse 12, "By the swords
[1:05:17] of the mighty will I cause thy multitude
[1:05:20] to fall,
[1:05:22] the terrible of the nations, all of
[1:05:24] them, and they shall spoil the pomp of
[1:05:27] Egypt."
[1:05:29] How do you know this? Because he's God.
[1:05:32] Amen.
[1:05:32] Well, what if it doesn't work out that
[1:05:34] way? He will cause it.
[1:05:36] He's saying, "I will do it. I'm going to
[1:05:38] cause it."
[1:05:40] See, and all the multitudes thereof
[1:05:43] shall be destroyed. It doesn't matter
[1:05:45] how mighty your military is, Egypt. I'm
[1:05:48] going to wipe you out.
[1:05:50] That's right. Amen.
[1:05:51] And here's that quote from Dr. Graham,
[1:05:54] Billy Graham. Sin pays, but it pays in
[1:05:58] remorse, regret,
[1:06:00] and failure.
[1:06:01] Amen.
[1:06:02] That's not a payment system. I want to
[1:06:04] be on.
[1:06:06] I'm not looking to collect those
[1:06:08] dividends, friends. I don't I'm done. I
[1:06:10] I'm tired of remorse. I'm tired of
[1:06:12] regret. I'm tired of failures. I want to
[1:06:15] move on to perfection. I want to move on
[1:06:18] to a body change. I want to have the
[1:06:20] capstone come down and and the and the
[1:06:22] full power of the Holy Ghost for that
[1:06:24] the dead for hundreds of years will rise
[1:06:26] out of the grave.
[1:06:29] Amen.
[1:06:29] I'm not looking for a revival. Brother
[1:06:31] Brandham said, "I'm not looking for a
[1:06:32] revival. I'm looking for the coming of
[1:06:34] the Lord.
[1:06:35] Amen.
[1:06:36] Meaning another age or another
[1:06:38] messenger. We certainly love revival.
[1:06:40] That's that's a different thing.
[1:06:43] All right. Verse 18. Son of man, wail
[1:06:45] for the multitude of Egypt and cast them
[1:06:48] down, even her and the daughters of the
[1:06:50] famous nations unto the nether parts of
[1:06:52] the earth. This is this is hell.
[1:06:56] And them that go down into the pit.
[1:06:59] Whom dust thou pass in beauty? Go down
[1:07:03] and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.
[1:07:06] They shall fall in the midst of them.
[1:07:08] They are slain by the sword. She is
[1:07:10] delivered to the sword. Draw her and all
[1:07:12] her multitudes. Verse 21. The strong
[1:07:15] among the mighty shall speak to him out
[1:07:17] of the midst of hell with them that help
[1:07:20] him. They are gone down. They lie
[1:07:22] uncircumcised, slain by the sword. See,
[1:07:25] they're uncircumcised is God's way of
[1:07:29] just saying they're not Jews, right?
[1:07:32] The whole world are not Jews. They're
[1:07:34] uncircumcised. The Jews, the Abraham's
[1:07:37] family, his circumcised family was a
[1:07:40] particular treasure to the Lord, chosen
[1:07:42] out by God.
[1:07:43] It's why the world hates them. That's
[1:07:45] why they can't stand the bride. She's a
[1:07:47] chosen vessel.
[1:07:48] See, that's right.
[1:07:50] And so verse 23 or verse 22, Asher, of
[1:07:54] course, this is Assyria in the Hebrew.
[1:07:56] It's not Asher, the tribe of of Israel.
[1:07:59] It's not a a a s h e r, it's a as s h r.
[1:08:04] It's ashure. It's a it's a Hebrew
[1:08:06] derivative of Assyria. Um Assyria is
[1:08:09] there and all her company. See, they're
[1:08:13] already there
[1:08:15] because this isn't the Babylon that
[1:08:17] started out under Nimrod. That one rose
[1:08:20] up, then declined, then Assyria took
[1:08:21] over, lasted for hundreds of years. Now
[1:08:23] Assyria's destroyed. Babylon's back and
[1:08:25] Assyria's in hell.
[1:08:28] See how that's happening?
[1:08:31] Whose graves are set in the verse 23.
[1:08:33] Whose graves are set in the sides of the
[1:08:36] pit. And her company is round about her
[1:08:39] grave. All of them slain, fallen by the
[1:08:42] sword, which caused terror in the land
[1:08:46] of the living. There is Elum and all her
[1:08:50] multitude round about her grave. All of
[1:08:52] them slain, fallen by the sword, which
[1:08:55] are gone down uncircumcised into the
[1:08:57] nether parts of the earth, which caused
[1:08:59] their terror in the land of the living.
[1:09:01] Boy, did they. Yet have they borne their
[1:09:04] shame with them that go down to the pit.
[1:09:06] They all are going to bear this shame
[1:09:08] together.
[1:09:10] I'm going to tell you something. They
[1:09:11] can say, you know, they can say like we
[1:09:13] say, they can say, "Boys, we're all in
[1:09:15] this thing together." And actually,
[1:09:17] you're going to read that they're
[1:09:18] actually a little bit comforted. Even
[1:09:20] Pharaoh's a little bit comforted. Like,
[1:09:22] I'm I'm not the only one who went to
[1:09:23] hell.
[1:09:25] It's not a lot of comfort.
[1:09:28] I'll pass.
[1:09:30] I'd rather say we're all in this
[1:09:32] together.
[1:09:34] Amen.
[1:09:35] And I don't plan to go down. I plan to
[1:09:36] go up.
[1:09:39] Elim is there. Verse 24. and all her
[1:09:41] multitude round about a grave, all of
[1:09:42] them slain, fallen by the sword, which
[1:09:44] are gone down uncircumcised into the
[1:09:46] nether parts of the earth, which caused
[1:09:48] their terror in the land of the living.
[1:09:49] Yet have they borne their shame with
[1:09:51] them that go down to the pit. They have
[1:09:54] set her a bed in the midst of the slain
[1:09:56] with all her multitudes. They're
[1:09:57] welcoming Pharaoh. They're welcoming
[1:09:58] Egypt. See, they're they're already
[1:10:01] there. Her graves are But Pharaoh never
[1:10:03] thought he would go. See, he thought he
[1:10:05] was a god. Her graves are round about
[1:10:08] him. All of them uncircumcised, slain by
[1:10:10] the sword, through their terror uh was
[1:10:13] caused in the land of uh though their
[1:10:15] terror was caused in the land of the
[1:10:17] living, yet have they borne their shame
[1:10:20] with them that go down to the pit, he
[1:10:22] has put in the midst of them that be
[1:10:23] slain. I said this to you a couple
[1:10:26] services ago. I've I've stood in some of
[1:10:28] the uh ruins of palaces of some of these
[1:10:32] great monarchs who just thought they had
[1:10:34] the power of life and death in their
[1:10:36] tongue. And remember, brother Brandham
[1:10:38] said, "Some of them you have to dig down
[1:10:39] into the earth to find where they
[1:10:40] ruled." They thought they were somebody
[1:10:43] and they were just a pawn, a player in
[1:10:46] prophecy.
[1:10:47] Sometimes in one or two verses and
[1:10:49] that's it.
[1:10:50] See,
[1:10:53] now
[1:10:55] I hope you're catching it the way I
[1:10:57] catch it. Because if this is whole
[1:10:59] nations and whole civilizations that
[1:11:02] flourished for hundreds of years and yet
[1:11:04] God used them and dispensed with them,
[1:11:07] gave them their choice. He knew what
[1:11:08] they would do. They did it. It served
[1:11:10] his greater purpose. Then they're in
[1:11:12] hell. You can see that election has no
[1:11:16] nothing can stop it. To which then I say
[1:11:19] that I am chosen in Christ before the
[1:11:21] foundation of the world. Do you think
[1:11:23] that anything you could do up or down,
[1:11:25] in or out or sideways could throw that
[1:11:27] off? I I was in Christ before the
[1:11:30] foundation of the world.
[1:11:32] This gives me a a sensibility of how God
[1:11:35] chose me. This is this this this this
[1:11:37] informs my thinking when I sit at a
[1:11:39] stoplight and I look at the guy next to
[1:11:41] me and here's a woman coming out of a
[1:11:43] store and here's some traffic across and
[1:11:44] there's people behind me and I'm not
[1:11:46] judging but I but if I played the odds I
[1:11:49] know I'm likely the only elected seed
[1:11:51] gene of God.
[1:11:53] I wish they all are. I'll try to talk to
[1:11:55] them if they want to open a door. That's
[1:11:57] not the point. The point is what who who
[1:12:00] is man that thou art mindful of him?
[1:12:03] Oh, John says, "What what kind of love
[1:12:06] is this that we should be called
[1:12:08] the sons of the living God?"
[1:12:10] Amen.
[1:12:11] What love is this, friends, that rescued
[1:12:13] you and and rescued you out of a family
[1:12:16] and left a family? Rescued you out of a
[1:12:18] church and left a church. Rescued you
[1:12:20] out of a bar and left the whole bar.
[1:12:22] Rescued you out of a university and left
[1:12:24] the whole university.
[1:12:26] What grace is this?
[1:12:28] Hallelujah.
[1:12:30] Amen.
[1:12:33] Oh my, it's been so exciting as I my
[1:12:36] mind has just been in a whirl thinking
[1:12:38] about all this.
[1:12:41] So yet have the last part of 24. Yet
[1:12:44] have they borne their shame with them
[1:12:46] that go down to the pit. 25. They have
[1:12:48] set her bed. I think we read this um
[1:12:51] verse. Okay, now we're coming. Verse 26.
[1:12:53] There is Mach and Tubal and all her
[1:12:56] multitude.
[1:12:57] This is a family reunion in hell.
[1:12:59] Yeah. Amen.
[1:13:02] Who are they? What family? They're not
[1:13:04] circumcised.
[1:13:05] They're not. Now, you could you could
[1:13:07] enter into that. You're You remember
[1:13:09] Uriah found his way in. Ruth found her
[1:13:12] way in.
[1:13:13] Yeah.
[1:13:14] Right. So, it wasn't impossible. It
[1:13:16] wasn't a boy club that, you know,
[1:13:19] members only. God made a provision that
[1:13:21] anybody who wanted to come in and serve
[1:13:23] Jehovah could could. He he had a way for
[1:13:26] that to happen.
[1:13:29] So verse 26, there is Mach Tubal and all
[1:13:32] her multitude. Her graves are round
[1:13:34] about him, all of them uncircumcised,
[1:13:35] slain by the sword,
[1:13:38] though they have caused terror in the
[1:13:40] land of the living. And they shall not
[1:13:43] lie with the mighty that are fallen of
[1:13:45] the uncircumcised. See, there was mighty
[1:13:46] down there, which are gone down to hell
[1:13:49] with their weapons of war. Doesn't
[1:13:51] matter what a mighty nation, mighty
[1:13:53] army, mighty weapons, they all end up in
[1:13:55] the same place.
[1:13:56] Yes. Amen. See?
[1:13:59] So, so he says here, "And they have laid
[1:14:04] their swords under their heads, but
[1:14:07] their iniquities shall be upon their
[1:14:10] bones."
[1:14:12] I thought about what a difference in the
[1:14:15] millennium when we lay our swords down.
[1:14:18] Oh, hallelujah. I won't study war no
[1:14:21] more.
[1:14:22] What a difference. They say, "Oh, bury
[1:14:24] him with his sword." What good's it
[1:14:26] going to do him? His bones are full of
[1:14:27] iniquity. He's going to hell.
[1:14:30] Amen.
[1:14:30] Oh, he accomplished this in the world.
[1:14:32] He accomplished that in the world. But
[1:14:33] did he terrorize the word of God?
[1:14:35] Come on. Amen.
[1:14:37] There's lots of inventions by men who
[1:14:40] didn't even believe in God. And we the
[1:14:43] world is a better place for their
[1:14:45] inventions, but they're still reaping
[1:14:47] their reward.
[1:14:48] Amen.
[1:14:49] See?
[1:14:50] Amen.
[1:14:52] They shall verse 27
[1:14:55] uh verse 28. Yay
[1:14:58] thou shalt be broken in the midst of the
[1:15:00] uncircumcised and shalt lie with them
[1:15:03] that are slain with the sword. There is
[1:15:05] Edom a very mighty nation in in its day.
[1:15:08] There is Edom her kings and her princes
[1:15:12] with their mighter laid by them that
[1:15:14] were slain by the sword. They shall lie
[1:15:16] with the uncircumcised and with them
[1:15:18] that go down to the pit. There be the
[1:15:20] princes of the north, all of them,
[1:15:24] and all the Zidonians, which are gone
[1:15:26] down with the slain, with their terror.
[1:15:28] They are ashamed of their might, and
[1:15:30] they lie uncircumcised with them that be
[1:15:32] slain by the sword, and bear their shame
[1:15:35] with them that go down to the pit.
[1:15:37] Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be
[1:15:39] comforted over all his multitude.
[1:15:42] Even Pharaoh and all his army slain.
[1:15:44] Pharaoh and all his army slain by the
[1:15:47] sword, saith the Lord God. Verse 32. For
[1:15:52] I have caused
[1:15:55] I have caused my terror in the land of
[1:15:59] the living, and he shall be laid in the
[1:16:01] midst of the uncircumcised with them
[1:16:03] that are slain with the sword, even
[1:16:04] Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the
[1:16:08] Lord God.
[1:16:09] Amen.
[1:16:12] You know, there's a brother Brandham
[1:16:14] took a in leadership,
[1:16:17] and we're not going to look at all of
[1:16:18] the ones, but two that he took
[1:16:20] particularly was Moses and Pharaoh.
[1:16:23] And we find out that Moses chose wisely.
[1:16:26] The book of Hebrews 11, sorry to jump
[1:16:28] you, brother Mark, if you can give me
[1:16:30] Hebrews 11:25 and 26. Uh Paul in his
[1:16:34] faith chapter here says concerning Moses
[1:16:37] choosing rather to suffer affliction
[1:16:40] with the people of God. Hebrews 11:25
[1:16:43] choosing rather to suffer affliction
[1:16:45] with the people of God than to enjoy the
[1:16:48] pleasures of sin for a season. Esteeming
[1:16:51] the reproach of Christ greater riches
[1:16:54] than the treasures in Egypt. For he had
[1:16:56] respect unto the recompense of the
[1:16:58] reward. Amen.
[1:17:01] I just think that you need a healthy
[1:17:02] recompense, a healthy respect to the
[1:17:06] recompense of the reward,
[1:17:08] good or bad,
[1:17:09] blessing or cursing.
[1:17:11] See, uh, life or death,
[1:17:14] I I think too often times we run
[1:17:16] recklessly through life and we don't
[1:17:18] think about I'm investing
[1:17:20] and there's going to be dividends paid
[1:17:22] out.
[1:17:23] See,
[1:17:25] so Moses chose the harder way. He chose
[1:17:28] uh as the NLT of verse 25 and 26 in the
[1:17:31] NLT, he chose to share. Catch these
[1:17:35] words. He chose to share the oppression
[1:17:37] of God's people instead of enjoying the
[1:17:41] fleeting pleasures of sin.
[1:17:44] He chose to share the oppression of
[1:17:48] God's people instead of enjoying the
[1:17:50] fleeting pleasures of sin. He thought,
[1:17:54] here's what Moses thought. He thought it
[1:17:56] was better to suffer for the sake of
[1:17:58] Christ than to own the treasures of
[1:18:01] Egypt, for he was looking ahead to his
[1:18:04] great reward.
[1:18:07] So Moses isn't even uh there's no record
[1:18:11] that Moses
[1:18:13] has had Ezekiel's vision.
[1:18:16] See, Moses knows that judgment is coming
[1:18:19] and God's going to judge Pharaoh. He's
[1:18:20] going to judge Egypt and he's going to
[1:18:22] spoil them. But after the after Israel
[1:18:24] left Egypt, Egypt didn't meet their fate
[1:18:26] yet. They lived on.
[1:18:28] They were invaded and counterinvaded and
[1:18:30] be and actually later on many hundreds
[1:18:32] of years, Israel made a mistake of
[1:18:34] trusting in their military to defend
[1:18:36] them against the Assyrians which didn't
[1:18:38] end well. See,
[1:18:41] so we find that Pharaoh is the one who
[1:18:44] chose poorly. Moses chose wisely.
[1:18:47] Pharaoh chose poorly. So, Ezekiel 32
[1:18:52] contains this whole series of
[1:18:54] lamentations and prophecies concerning
[1:18:56] the downfall of Egypt and its Pharaoh uh
[1:18:59] along with all these other nations that
[1:19:02] we read about that were destined for
[1:19:03] destruction. And and for each one of
[1:19:06] them, doom is prophesied. And and and so
[1:19:09] I want to I want to look now at first at
[1:19:12] Egypt and Pharaoh.
[1:19:14] Let's see. Do I still got Am I still uh
[1:19:18] Let's have my PowerPoint back. All
[1:19:20] right. See if I got control.
[1:19:23] So, Egypt and Pharaoh, we find and let
[1:19:26] me just give you the history as we look
[1:19:28] at it a little bit. And and and this was
[1:19:30] where a lot of the work was because you
[1:19:32] you you've got to source it all and
[1:19:34] you've got to track it back and make
[1:19:35] sure it's all correct. So, Pharaoh, if
[1:19:38] you'll notice when we read in the Bible,
[1:19:40] he's likened to a sea monster. A lot of
[1:19:42] lot of it says it says a whale. Yeah.
[1:19:44] But it's a whale that it was like a
[1:19:45] whale, but it walked on its feet.
[1:19:48] Did you catch that? So, it was like a
[1:19:50] sea monster that was literally taken out
[1:19:53] of the water. You ever take like a fish,
[1:19:55] he's a he's a mighty swimmer in the
[1:19:57] water, pits him on the land, and just
[1:19:58] flops around. He's helpless. Anything
[1:20:00] can destroy him. Any predator walk up
[1:20:02] and kill him. And the water, he's got a
[1:20:04] chance to get away, but not on land.
[1:20:06] See? And so we find that he's he's like
[1:20:09] a sea monster that's caught and drugged
[1:20:11] to the land and slain and left for the
[1:20:13] scavengers. And the land of Egypt uh is
[1:20:17] for is foretold that they're going to
[1:20:19] experience a terrible desolation and the
[1:20:22] waters are going to be darkened and its
[1:20:24] populace is going to be scattered. And
[1:20:26] that if you and I'm not taking the time
[1:20:28] today to track the Hebrew words, but but
[1:20:30] the fact that the sky was darkened and
[1:20:32] things like that indicate a political
[1:20:34] disturbance. So, so it's this I I I say
[1:20:38] that to to to to get you to understand
[1:20:40] this was real life just like you have.
[1:20:42] And they lived in a nation and they had
[1:20:44] politics
[1:20:46] and they had science and they had
[1:20:48] religion and they had people who worked
[1:20:51] jobs and had families and took vacations
[1:20:53] just like you and me.
[1:20:55] See, so the Bible is careful so that you
[1:20:58] don't just go, "Oh, this was in a a long
[1:21:01] time ago in a galaxy far far away." No,
[1:21:03] this was right here on earth just
[1:21:04] separated by some years
[1:21:06] and you're you could just as easily be
[1:21:08] them then and they could be you now.
[1:21:11] See,
[1:21:13] so his historical records indicate that
[1:21:17] Egypt actually faced significant
[1:21:20] invasions and defeats according to the
[1:21:22] prophecy. Uh notably we find that
[1:21:25] Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon uh nearly
[1:21:29] destroyed them. All right, you say,
[1:21:31] "Yep, there goes Egypt." Not so fast.
[1:21:33] Hold on. And they survived.
[1:21:36] It's not all neat and clean.
[1:21:38] Nebuchadnezzar walked in and destroyed
[1:21:40] them, put them to tribute, but they
[1:21:42] finally managed to get a little bit of
[1:21:44] autonomy and slowly over politics and
[1:21:46] their emissaries and treaties and deals
[1:21:48] and political pressure and financial
[1:21:50] incentives. They ma they managed to
[1:21:52] finally just like today nations, you
[1:21:54] know, it's all it's all about let's make
[1:21:56] a trade deal. Let's have all this going.
[1:21:58] Do you understand? This was life and
[1:22:00] this is life and it's the same life.
[1:22:02] Amen.
[1:22:03] It's the same events. This is prophecy.
[1:22:05] This is prophecy.
[1:22:07] And so, so we find then that that that
[1:22:10] they actually were were able when when
[1:22:13] Babylon came in around uh 568, 567, they
[1:22:17] went into a substantial decline. But it
[1:22:19] would it would take it would take about
[1:22:22] another um another probably uh probably
[1:22:25] at least another 50 years if I'm doing
[1:22:28] the math quickly in my head. It would
[1:22:30] take roughly oh actually more than that.
[1:22:33] It would yeah about I would say about 40
[1:22:36] to 50 more years and just when they
[1:22:38] think okay
[1:22:40] we survived it and then here comes uh
[1:22:43] CBC I of Persia
[1:22:46] and after that mm- no they're done
[1:22:49] they're done they never recover from
[1:22:51] that.
[1:22:53] the Assyrians.
[1:22:56] Uh let me turn off and turn back on.
[1:23:01] So we read about the Assyrians. Remember
[1:23:03] they were Asher but in but in but in the
[1:23:04] Assyrians we the Assyrians we find out
[1:23:08] that they were they in our prophecy they
[1:23:10] were depicted as having already fallen.
[1:23:13] remember they were already down there
[1:23:14] and I told you how they had rose up and
[1:23:16] even put Babylon under their feet only
[1:23:19] to decline and then Babylon resurfaces
[1:23:21] and and they actually already fallen
[1:23:23] with its warriors lying in the depths of
[1:23:25] the pit as the Bible says slain with the
[1:23:27] sword and so the Assyrian Empire
[1:23:30] actually fell in 612 BC with the sack of
[1:23:33] Nineveh Nineveh by a coalition of
[1:23:36] Babylonians Mes and others that
[1:23:38] effectively ended its dominance. So why
[1:23:42] why was it in hell? Because it it it
[1:23:46] reaped the the pay the reward, the
[1:23:49] dividends of terrorizing the earth.
[1:23:53] They didn't just terrorize Babylon, they
[1:23:54] terrorized Israel.
[1:23:56] They terrorized God's people. They were
[1:23:58] very, you remember Jonah was sent to
[1:24:00] them
[1:24:01] and and Jonah preached and their king
[1:24:03] repented. But do you know later they
[1:24:05] backslid backslid and God's prophecy
[1:24:08] still came to pass. It only got delayed.
[1:24:10] Amen.
[1:24:11] See, so it doesn't matter. I mean I mean
[1:24:14] you you can see how that was it um uh
[1:24:18] Jeconiah the young I don't think that's
[1:24:20] who it was. I think that's the one who
[1:24:21] went into captivity. But it was the
[1:24:22] young king who who got with the priest
[1:24:26] and and and began to try to do some
[1:24:28] restoration work in Israel and he tore
[1:24:31] down all the altars. And God had already
[1:24:32] prophesied to Israel, you're going into
[1:24:34] captivity. That's it. I'm done with you
[1:24:35] guys.
[1:24:36] And because of the ze the zeal of this
[1:24:39] king, God came down and said, "Okay, I
[1:24:41] tell you what. I won't do it in your
[1:24:42] lifetime.
[1:24:44] Amen.
[1:24:45] It's still going to happen because I've
[1:24:46] already said it, but I won't do it in
[1:24:48] your lifetime." And he died and it never
[1:24:50] happened in his lifetime, but it
[1:24:51] happened later. And so, so we find then
[1:24:54] that that this effectively ended the
[1:24:57] Assyrian uh dominance. And so then you
[1:25:00] move to Elum. And Elum's multitude uh
[1:25:04] are described there as slain, having
[1:25:07] descended uncircumcised into the lower
[1:25:09] parts of the earth, bearing their shame.
[1:25:11] Remember that? And and of course, Elum
[1:25:14] was located then in we realize located
[1:25:16] in what is present day uh southwestern
[1:25:19] Iran. And they were now here here's a
[1:25:23] plot twist. They were conquered by the
[1:25:26] Assyrians
[1:25:28] who later got destroyed. And then
[1:25:31] they're all there together. It's all one
[1:25:33] big party of destroyed and destroyed
[1:25:35] nations.
[1:25:35] Amen.
[1:25:36] See, and so they were conquered and
[1:25:39] later absorbed into the Persian Empire
[1:25:41] under Cyrus the Great in the sixth
[1:25:42] century. Meek and Tubal,
[1:25:46] we find now uh or no, this one is
[1:25:48] correct. Uh Meek and Tubal, just to give
[1:25:51] you a little bit of history, these
[1:25:53] nations are portrayed again as
[1:25:54] uncircumcised, slain by the sword,
[1:25:56] having caused terror in the land of the
[1:25:58] living. They are believed to correspond
[1:26:01] to regions in modern-day Turkey, today,
[1:26:03] what we would call modern day Turkey.
[1:26:05] And they were eventually, even though
[1:26:08] they were autonomous and independent and
[1:26:10] had families and had government and
[1:26:12] worked jobs and made money and took
[1:26:14] vacations, they were eventually
[1:26:16] completely absorbed um by successive
[1:26:20] empires that included the Persians and
[1:26:21] later the Romans.
[1:26:23] Amen.
[1:26:24] So it it's almost like the only thing
[1:26:28] that is certain is if you remain
[1:26:33] in a category before God of
[1:26:36] uncircumcised, which just means you're
[1:26:37] outside the covenant. If you choose, it
[1:26:40] doesn't matter what kind of nation you
[1:26:42] are or what you accomplish or how many
[1:26:44] centuries you survive, you will
[1:26:47] ultimately pay the price. So no wonder
[1:26:50] that this nation is doomed. No wonder
[1:26:52] all the nations are doomed. No wonder
[1:26:54] the third woe is going to sweep it. No
[1:26:56] wonder it'll be an extinction event. God
[1:26:58] is done. He's ready for a new
[1:27:00] millennium.
[1:27:02] Amen.
[1:27:04] And people say, "Oh, it's not going to
[1:27:05] happen." Oh, did it? Oh, it didn't
[1:27:07] happen. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I didn't
[1:27:10] realize that it that it actually didn't
[1:27:11] happen. None of this happened.
[1:27:14] Every bit of it happened.
[1:27:16] That's happened in real time. And a
[1:27:19] prophet called it out past, imminent,
[1:27:22] and future.
[1:27:23] Amen.
[1:27:24] And so, so we go on. Let me let me let
[1:27:26] me come to another one. So, we had
[1:27:31] Whoa. You're not I don't care
[1:27:33] technology. I'll preach without you.
[1:27:38] So then, so then we go on to to
[1:27:42] Edom. And Edom's kings and their princes
[1:27:44] are said to lie with the slain despite
[1:27:48] their former might. And they had a
[1:27:49] glorious Edom had a glorious might. And
[1:27:52] and and but now they're sharing in the
[1:27:55] fate of the uncircumcised. And and it
[1:27:57] was situated south of Judah. It faced
[1:27:59] numerous conflicts with neighboring
[1:28:01] states. But by the time of the 6th
[1:28:03] century BC, working our way down toward
[1:28:05] Christ, uh it had been significantly
[1:28:08] weakened and was eventually absorbed
[1:28:11] into uh the Nabotene kingdom. So, uh see
[1:28:15] you guys see it wouldn't want to be you.
[1:28:18] Seemen,
[1:28:21] and then finally, you get the princes of
[1:28:23] the north, the Sidonians. Now, I've got
[1:28:25] an error here I want to correct before
[1:28:27] it goes out over the internet. I've got
[1:28:28] the Persians and Alexander was actually
[1:28:31] uh the Assyrians. There are those
[1:28:32] Assyrians again, man. They're You can
[1:28:34] see why they're terrorizing the whole
[1:28:36] world. You can see why the scene opens
[1:28:37] up and they're already in hell.
[1:28:39] See, and so it they're depicted as
[1:28:43] having gone down with the slain. And
[1:28:44] again, there it is bearing their shame.
[1:28:47] They're for causing terror through their
[1:28:49] might. And uh history shows that it it
[1:28:52] these princes of the north it's a little
[1:28:54] bit the scholars are a little bit in um
[1:28:57] not perfectly aligned but the general
[1:28:59] consensus is that they were mainly um
[1:29:03] leaders of northern citystates or
[1:29:05] regions possibly including and I from
[1:29:08] what my research it looks almost
[1:29:10] certainly areas like Phoenicia and Sidon
[1:29:13] a prominent Phoenician city probably the
[1:29:15] most prominent Phoenician city where you
[1:29:17] get phonics. Yeah.
[1:29:19] Okay. So, I mean the these people have
[1:29:21] contributed to the world and so we we
[1:29:24] find out that that that Assyria sacked
[1:29:26] them and then later Alexander the Great
[1:29:29] 3 in 332 uh BC uh sacked them. All
[1:29:33] right. Now,
[1:29:36] all right.
[1:29:38] Now, let me do some summing up for you
[1:29:41] and give you some of my reflections on
[1:29:42] all of this.
[1:29:44] So we've got these combined nations and
[1:29:50] you've got Egypt, you've got Assyria,
[1:29:52] you've got Elilum, you've got Mach and
[1:29:53] Tubal, you've got Edom, you've got the
[1:29:55] Sidonians, the Phoenicia, those princes
[1:29:58] of the north. And let me give you some
[1:30:00] numbers. the estimated combined
[1:30:04] population of all six of those kingdoms.
[1:30:06] And it's it's not exactly uh it's a it's
[1:30:09] a wide range, but scholars say somewhere
[1:30:13] between five and a half to 10 million
[1:30:16] souls
[1:30:18] uh in in those six in those six nations.
[1:30:23] And so, you know, th this this is uh it
[1:30:26] reflects their approximate populations
[1:30:28] at uh when they were at their peak.
[1:30:31] That's not even to say all the all the
[1:30:33] souls they ever had. That's just at
[1:30:34] their peak. That was their population
[1:30:37] uh level near the time of their decline.
[1:30:39] All right. Egypt was estimated to have 3
[1:30:43] to 5 million. Assyria 1 to2 million.
[1:30:45] Elum half a million to 1 million. Meek
[1:30:47] and Tubal.3 to points a little over half
[1:30:50] a million. Edom uh quarter to almost a
[1:30:53] half a million. The Sidonians a half a
[1:30:55] million to 1 million. So the total
[1:30:57] estimate is somewhere around 5 12 to 10
[1:30:59] million. Uh and they're and they're a
[1:31:01] little bit rough estimates from ancient
[1:31:03] ancient records. So what I what stood
[1:31:06] out to me is that these populations
[1:31:10] didn't just fluctuate due to war. They
[1:31:12] also fluctuated due to famine. They
[1:31:15] fluctuated due to disease. They
[1:31:17] fluctuated due to force migrations. So,
[1:31:20] it was war, it was famines, it was
[1:31:22] disease, it was migrations, and and I
[1:31:25] just say, my goodness, it it's basically
[1:31:28] every factor that makes up human life in
[1:31:31] existence since the Garden of Eden.
[1:31:33] Amen.
[1:31:34] And so, I guess the takeaway is,
[1:31:36] friends, there's there's no there's
[1:31:38] there's no certainty. The world has only
[1:31:41] an uncertain sound. There's only one
[1:31:43] certain sound. There's only one record
[1:31:46] that you can reliably depend on. 100% of
[1:31:50] the time.
[1:31:51] Amen.
[1:31:54] Ezekiel where he writes this is just
[1:31:57] after shortly after the u Babylonian
[1:31:59] exile around 585 BC. Uh and so so the
[1:32:03] the these declining nations they
[1:32:05] happened over a period of time as I've
[1:32:08] stated before both before and after
[1:32:10] Ezekiel's civilization. I don't want to
[1:32:13] bore you with all of the years and dates
[1:32:15] exactly. I just wanted to make sure I
[1:32:16] had them correct. But let me let me give
[1:32:18] you uh some sum some some summations. So
[1:32:21] you've got you've basically got about 5
[1:32:24] 12 to 10 million people. And everything
[1:32:28] that we read and we showed on the screen
[1:32:31] was events that were modern in their
[1:32:34] day, past events, modern events and
[1:32:36] modern events that were coming. Just
[1:32:38] like when brother Brandon preached
[1:32:39] modern events, 70 more years of events
[1:32:42] were coming.
[1:32:43] See? And so you're you're covering 5 to
[1:32:46] 10 million people and you're covering
[1:32:48] approximately three centuries.
[1:32:52] All right? So you've got about 5 to 10
[1:32:55] million people.
[1:32:57] You've got
[1:32:59] 300 years of unfolding history.
[1:33:03] And you've and during this three
[1:33:04] centuries, you've got cascading declines
[1:33:07] and and conquest and desolations. And
[1:33:10] one would rise up, then decline, then
[1:33:12] another would come in, then another
[1:33:13] would rise back up, crush him, and then
[1:33:15] he would look like he's gone, and then
[1:33:16] come back around, and then at the end of
[1:33:18] the day, they all ended up in hell.
[1:33:20] Yeah. Amen.
[1:33:22] Amen.
[1:33:22] All of this history. Now, I want you to
[1:33:24] This This was like a This might be
[1:33:27] antilimactic to you, but it was like a a
[1:33:31] a moment. I had a moment in my mind when
[1:33:33] I thought about this
[1:33:36] that all of this history,
[1:33:40] all of this science, today the world is
[1:33:43] so proud of history and science.
[1:33:45] All of this education,
[1:33:47] all of this political might, military
[1:33:50] might, military superpowers.
[1:33:53] Yeah. Amen.
[1:33:54] Political superpowers.
[1:33:57] 5 to 10 million souls over 300 years of
[1:34:02] history
[1:34:04] reduced to 32 verses in one chapter of
[1:34:08] one book of the entire Bible.
[1:34:10] My goodness.
[1:34:15] Is that an aha moment for you too?
[1:34:17] Yes.
[1:34:18] I was staggered by that. I thought 5 to
[1:34:20] 10 million people 300 years of politics
[1:34:23] and military and social and education
[1:34:25] and all this and it all comes down to 32
[1:34:27] verses in a single chapter of the single
[1:34:29] book in the entire Bible.
[1:34:31] Amen. Amen.
[1:34:32] And then they want to mock God and say
[1:34:34] he's not in control. And God just
[1:34:36] reduces six six empires and 300 years
[1:34:41] and all of that and he puts it in 32
[1:34:43] verses
[1:34:45] of a single chapter of a single book in
[1:34:48] the entire Bible.
[1:34:55] when I I went back and I did a little
[1:34:58] bit of research
[1:35:00] and I just I kind of added to my
[1:35:02] workload because again, you have to be
[1:35:04] certain.
[1:35:06] But let me just come and I I'm going to
[1:35:08] I'm going to wind down with this right
[1:35:09] here today because when you're doing
[1:35:10] stuff like this, you get sponged really
[1:35:12] fast and I don't want that to happen to
[1:35:13] you. You're going to appreciate this
[1:35:17] ancient history correlating it when we
[1:35:20] get into the deep book of Revelation and
[1:35:21] Daniel start correlating things that
[1:35:23] happened in the days of your fathers and
[1:35:25] things that are happening in your day.
[1:35:27] Amen.
[1:35:28] You're going to see do whatever you do
[1:35:30] when we get there, you remember how
[1:35:33] certain you feel right now because
[1:35:35] you're seeing all of this. See
[1:35:38] in Ezekiel 32 we find that
[1:35:44] um
[1:35:46] here was the contributions of Egypt. Now
[1:35:50] catch it because all of this is one
[1:35:52] chapter in one book in the entire Bible.
[1:35:57] One chapter in a single book.
[1:36:01] Egypt in their science. They were known
[1:36:04] for advanced mathematics including
[1:36:07] geometry
[1:36:08] uh astronomy, medicine, sophisticated
[1:36:12] irrigation systems. They had in
[1:36:15] literature they had religious texts.
[1:36:17] They had wisdom literature. They had
[1:36:19] poetry. They had autobiographal
[1:36:21] autobiographical narratives. They had in
[1:36:24] the arts they had monumental
[1:36:26] architecture, sophisticated sculpture,
[1:36:29] uh, hieroglyphic writing, vibrant
[1:36:32] painting traditions and decorative arts.
[1:36:35] Assyria was famous for their
[1:36:37] astronomical observations and records,
[1:36:40] early medical tests with diagnosis and
[1:36:42] treatments.
[1:36:43] Amen.
[1:36:44] They in literature they preserved
[1:36:45] extensive libraries. Uh there was one in
[1:36:48] Nineveh with over 30,000 clay tablets
[1:36:51] just in Nineveh alone, including the
[1:36:53] Epic of Gilgamesh.
[1:36:56] These people were no joke. They were
[1:36:59] major movers and shakers of the ancient
[1:37:02] world.
[1:37:02] Wow.
[1:37:04] They they had massive relief sculptures
[1:37:06] depicting military campaigns, palace
[1:37:09] architecture, intricate ivory carvings
[1:37:11] and metal works. Elim was known for
[1:37:13] early writing systems, metallurgy, and
[1:37:15] urban planning. They in literature they
[1:37:18] had administrative text and early legal
[1:37:20] codes. In arts they had distinctive
[1:37:22] poetry, sophisticated metal works,
[1:37:24] architecture, innovations and the and
[1:37:26] the protouniform uh writing system. My
[1:37:29] goodness, these people didn't rest.
[1:37:31] Amen.
[1:37:34] In in Mach and Tubal, they were advanced
[1:37:37] in metallurgy, particularly iron
[1:37:39] working. I kept thinking about the Bible
[1:37:42] says that Cain, you know, married and
[1:37:44] went and he built a great city and his
[1:37:47] offspring were met metal workers and
[1:37:50] artificers and scientist. And brother
[1:37:52] Brandham tracks uh Seth's lineage. They
[1:37:55] were simple people who just love the
[1:37:57] Lord. See,
[1:38:01] and so so we find that they had
[1:38:03] distinctive metal work, jewelry, and
[1:38:05] weapon craftsmanship. The uh Mach and
[1:38:08] Tubal were noted for their weapon
[1:38:10] craftsmanship. Ma they were major
[1:38:13] suppliers of metals and slaves to the
[1:38:15] ancient near east. Edom was famous in
[1:38:18] science for their copper minting techn
[1:38:20] copper mining technology metallurgical
[1:38:23] innovations. They architecture they had
[1:38:25] carved rocks structures and
[1:38:27] fortifications. Their arts were
[1:38:28] distinctive for poetry and crafts. The
[1:38:31] Sidonian Phoenicians they had marit they
[1:38:34] their science was maritime navigation
[1:38:37] astronomy for seafaring purple dye
[1:38:40] production and literature they developed
[1:38:42] the phonetic alphabet that influenced
[1:38:44] most of western writing systems today in
[1:38:47] arts they had glass blowing techniques
[1:38:49] intricate ivory carvings metal work and
[1:38:51] textile production
[1:38:55] all of that
[1:38:57] is in 32 verses
[1:38:59] in one chapter and one book of the
[1:39:02] entire Bible.
[1:39:06] History has volumes and volumes. They
[1:39:08] write about it.
[1:39:09] History, the way mankind thinks, the
[1:39:13] there there are whole sections of the
[1:39:15] Library of Congress. There are whole
[1:39:16] sections of any library you go into that
[1:39:19] you can find books and books and books
[1:39:20] and books and PDFs and PDFs and PDFs and
[1:39:23] essays and essays and essays about the
[1:39:25] history that God stuck in a single
[1:39:28] chapter in 32 verses in one book of the
[1:39:31] entire Bible.
[1:39:32] Amen.
[1:39:33] All that culture, all that science, all
[1:39:36] that history, all that art, all of that
[1:39:39] literature, and God just shows it was
[1:39:43] all in my plan. I allowed this to to do
[1:39:45] this, then did that, then I stopped
[1:39:46] that, then this was done. So, I pulled
[1:39:48] it down, put this back up, and I walked
[1:39:49] it all down through history. I'm here to
[1:39:51] tell you something, friends. That's
[1:39:52] where we are today. How did we get here?
[1:39:55] One step at a time. One prophecy at a
[1:39:57] time. One act of God at a time. Could I
[1:40:01] say to you today, you can trust the
[1:40:03] Lord. He's got you. He's got this. He's
[1:40:06] got the whole world in his hands. I
[1:40:09] think of ever a song or we are to have
[1:40:11] the children sing. He's got the whole
[1:40:13] world. I remember my boys used to sing
[1:40:14] that when they were little. One of the
[1:40:16] first songs they learned. He's got the
[1:40:17] whole world in his hands. And I'm glad.
[1:40:22] Yes, sir.
[1:40:22] I'm glad that God is in perfect control
[1:40:26] of it.
[1:40:28] You know something, friends,
[1:40:31] and I I told the Lord I would I would
[1:40:33] say this. I didn't I had no clue it was
[1:40:35] going to be for today.
[1:40:38] But I said, 'Well, if you want it, you
[1:40:39] just bring it back to my memory at the
[1:40:41] moment, and if I feel led, I'll take it.
[1:40:44] You know, there is um
[1:40:48] there's a sense of
[1:40:52] of a human being. We're in this world
[1:40:54] and time is moving and we we wonder
[1:40:58] about prophecy. We wonder why is this,
[1:41:00] why is that? And I I if one thing that
[1:41:03] this study has done is fill me with
[1:41:06] confidence that nothing is out of cater,
[1:41:10] nothing is out of time, nothing is off
[1:41:12] base, I'm not off base, you're not off
[1:41:14] base, we're not out of time. I know we
[1:41:16] have problems. I know we we have our ups
[1:41:19] and downs. It that never stopped God.
[1:41:21] God's people have always had their ups
[1:41:23] and downs.
[1:41:24] Amen. And and we live in an age, you
[1:41:26] know, this age is so vile and so filthy.
[1:41:30] And you know what? Let's be honest. Just
[1:41:33] walking around in it, we get stained. We
[1:41:36] get a scent of the world. You can't even
[1:41:37] avoid it. In Walmart, in McDonald's,
[1:41:39] wherever you go, you're going to you're
[1:41:41] going to you're going to pick up that
[1:41:43] that kind of a a feeling of the world.
[1:41:45] And the whole world is worried about
[1:41:47] this and worried about that and the
[1:41:49] economy this and the stock market that
[1:41:51] and Russia this and and Trump this and
[1:41:53] all these kinds of things and a judge
[1:41:55] here and what's ever happening to the
[1:41:56] pope and what's going to happen next. I
[1:41:58] know what's going to happen in the next
[1:42:00] event in God's calendar. A bride's going
[1:42:02] to leave the earth.
[1:42:04] A bride's going to leave the earth. And
[1:42:06] and there is a there is a power I want
[1:42:08] to say to you today. There is a power in
[1:42:11] the washing of God's word that can wash
[1:42:13] your mind clean of fear, wash your heart
[1:42:16] clean of anxiety, wash you clean of
[1:42:18] guilt and shame. You don't have to go
[1:42:20] down to hell and lay there in your
[1:42:23] shame. You can be cleaned and delivered
[1:42:26] today.
[1:42:27] Do you believe that?
[1:42:31] I learned a lesson today in cleaning
[1:42:33] that I didn't expect to learn. And I I'm
[1:42:36] not going to look at her. She might get
[1:42:37] on to me. But Sister Debbie had a had a
[1:42:40] fiasco this morning. So I got to play
[1:42:42] Sir Galahad and come to the rescue of
[1:42:44] the fair maiden, which I do and uh I I
[1:42:47] like doing it. So So
[1:42:50] she had uh she had a where she had
[1:42:54] shaved around her ankle and had a little
[1:42:56] nick and didn't realize it had gotten
[1:42:58] blood on her skirt. Fortunately, thank
[1:43:01] God, my wife wears skirts long like a
[1:43:03] lady should and uh and it got down there
[1:43:06] and got blood on it and it was it was
[1:43:07] all over the rim. I mean, it was just
[1:43:09] like, "Wow, did you get butchered? What
[1:43:10] happened to you
[1:43:12] and we're ready to come to church and
[1:43:14] we're trying to get here to be on time
[1:43:16] for Sunday school."
[1:43:18] And so I can see she's just, "Oh my
[1:43:20] goodness, what am I going to do? I have
[1:43:21] to change. I'm" And I'm worried about
[1:43:23] her dress. I know she likes it and
[1:43:25] everything. So So here I am.
[1:43:27] Fortunately, I had all my stuff ready
[1:43:29] and so I so, "Hey, give me the dress. Go
[1:43:31] change. Get on a different one." She
[1:43:33] gives me that dress and here I am
[1:43:34] standing on a Sunday morning and I've
[1:43:36] got a woman's skirt, a dress upside down
[1:43:39] with this part in the big sink and I'm
[1:43:41] scrubbing away with water and and soap,
[1:43:46] which is not uncommon. I She knows I
[1:43:48] always rescue her and all of her spills
[1:43:50] and drops and crashes. whenever I
[1:43:52] whenever I hear a crash, I just set my
[1:43:54] stuff aside and get up, you know, and go
[1:43:56] in there, get back, I'll get it, carry
[1:43:57] on, you know. So, so I love it. I I love
[1:44:01] doing it for her. And so, but I'd never
[1:44:02] rescued her, you know, on a on a Sunday
[1:44:05] morning um trying to get blood out of
[1:44:07] her, out of her dress. And uh so I I
[1:44:11] took it in there and I'm standing there
[1:44:12] in the sink and I'm looking at the time
[1:44:13] and and I'm just washing away and I'm
[1:44:16] you know trying to actuate and I looked
[1:44:17] on chat to see what's the best way use
[1:44:19] cold water and detergent and then don't
[1:44:21] use warm water whatever you do and blah
[1:44:22] blah blah. And so when I put it under
[1:44:25] the cold water it didn't do nothing. It
[1:44:28] didn't do no I mean like it was just dry
[1:44:31] blood wet blood. It was not doing
[1:44:33] anything. So I thought well okay let's
[1:44:35] go to step two and get some soap. And I
[1:44:36] just started dipping it out the hand
[1:44:38] soap on the pump. And I just started
[1:44:40] taking each drop and just doing that all
[1:44:42] the way down. And then when I got all
[1:44:44] the way around and I came back to start
[1:44:46] again, I noticed something strange that
[1:44:48] I didn't expect. Science was happening.
[1:44:52] Science was happening. The chemicals in
[1:44:55] the soap are designed to break down the
[1:44:57] proteins in the blood, loosen them, and
[1:44:59] then if you just stay with it and just
[1:45:02] keep at it. And I started over and I got
[1:45:03] a little more. And I kept doing that.
[1:45:05] and it was a little more faded and I
[1:45:06] went all the way down and then I started
[1:45:08] back again and every time I I went all
[1:45:11] the way and there was probably 40 or 50
[1:45:13] blood splatters and the dress was for
[1:45:16] every practical reason ruined. Do you
[1:45:19] know I'm quite proud of myself. I got
[1:45:21] every last one of them out. Every last
[1:45:24] one of them. There was not even a
[1:45:26] residue. Sister Debbiey's a witness. Can
[1:45:28] I look at ain't that right, babe?
[1:45:31] And and and I was so proud. And she's
[1:45:33] saying, "Thank you, Su. I'm so thank you
[1:45:35] for doing that. I said, "Wow, I've never
[1:45:36] had to rescue you from I rescued all
[1:45:38] your spills and breaks and drops, but
[1:45:40] I'd never have had to take your dress to
[1:45:43] the sink and try to get blood out of
[1:45:44] it." But it worked. And I thought to
[1:45:46] myself, I thought, you know, that we
[1:45:48] have a washing of the water of the word.
[1:45:51] And a lot of times you get caught up in
[1:45:53] stuff and you go, "But I read I read my
[1:45:55] Bible and I've been praying and I came
[1:45:57] to church, but I'm still got this
[1:45:58] problem." Just keep reading. Just keep
[1:46:01] praying. Just keep coming. It'll keep
[1:46:03] it'll start working. It's it's science.
[1:46:06] It's God's heavenly science. It knows
[1:46:09] how to clean your life. Oh, I'm here to
[1:46:11] tell you friends, there's no washing of
[1:46:13] your mind and your heart and your soul
[1:46:15] like the washing of the water of the
[1:46:17] word of God.
[1:46:19] And the Bible says we're washed clean.
[1:46:22] Not I I don't even have to have a stain.
[1:46:24] I don't have to have a residue. I can
[1:46:26] take every past failure and where I
[1:46:29] would have ended up like all the rest of
[1:46:31] the history and and I would have been
[1:46:32] famous in hell. But God rich in mercy
[1:46:36] came down and washed up my life and he's
[1:46:38] still washing it.
[1:46:40] Amen.
[1:46:42] And every day I feel a little stronger
[1:46:44] and a little stronger. Oh friends, are
[1:46:46] you looking for that hour when we'll
[1:46:48] step across into a whole another world
[1:46:50] and then all the history and all the
[1:46:52] culture and all the arts and all the
[1:46:53] science and all the literature and
[1:46:55] everything will will go bye-bye.
[1:46:58] Brother Brandham says he said on that
[1:47:00] day he said it he raised up and he waved
[1:47:03] goodbye and one of these days I'm going
[1:47:05] to wave goodbye to this sorry world. Oh
[1:47:09] my I'm looking forward to that hour
[1:47:11] friend. Stand to your feet with me. God
[1:47:13] bless you. We can't keep going on. We're
[1:47:15] getting late. Uh but but but have you
[1:47:18] enjoyed looking at history like that? We
[1:47:20] correlate it to modern day events.
[1:47:22] You're really going to be astonished at
[1:47:24] how much of your modern day has been
[1:47:27] controlled by things that you read in
[1:47:30] the book of Revelation. And
[1:47:33] the the students who all they can do is
[1:47:35] compare verse with verse miss it a
[1:47:37] million miles. Even though they hit
[1:47:39] miss, they miss the intrinsic depth.
[1:47:42] They miss the real kernel of the meaning
[1:47:45] of the word of God.
[1:47:47] Amen.
[1:47:48] Oh my goodness. They they can still
[1:47:50] read, brother Bob. It astonishes me.
[1:47:51] They can read the first eight verses of
[1:47:55] Revelation 1. We were dealing with this.
[1:47:57] And it comes down to the eighth verse,
[1:47:58] the eth verse, and it's Jesus. And he
[1:48:01] says, "I'm the beginning and the end and
[1:48:04] the first and the last. I'm the
[1:48:06] Almighty." Who are you? The Almighty.
[1:48:09] Yeah. But who is that? The Almighty.
[1:48:11] Yeah.
[1:48:12] And they can still go away from that and
[1:48:13] think somehow he's a junior second
[1:48:15] person and a trifecta godhead. What
[1:48:18] nonsense, friends. I'm so glad that we
[1:48:20] understand who he is.
[1:48:23] And then as if that isn't enough, then
[1:48:25] we understand that we have a part in his
[1:48:27] identity. Oh, happy day. Happy day. When
[1:48:31] he washed all my sins away. Praise the
[1:48:33] Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother
[1:48:35] Tony, what you going to sing, buddy? You
[1:48:37] don't know that old happy day, do you?
[1:48:39] [Laughter]
[1:48:43] Amen. Well, you're going to have to
[1:48:44] learn it cuz I might want to sing it
[1:48:45] when we come back come back to it again.
