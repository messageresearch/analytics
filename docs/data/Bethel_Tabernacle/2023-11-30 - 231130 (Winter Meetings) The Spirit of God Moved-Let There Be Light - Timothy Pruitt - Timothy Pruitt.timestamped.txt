[28:31] for the unbeliever he said but it's a
[28:33] glorious time for the believer and I I'm
[28:36] glad to be a believer amen amen Genesis
[28:39] chapter 1 and verse one amen as we would
[28:42] start these meetings out you always want
[28:44] to start out on the right foot and so we
[28:47] just been asking the Lord to direct us
[28:49] today and just couldn't get away from
[28:52] this thought so Genesis 1 and verse one
[28:55] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[28:57] and the Earth Earth and the Earth was
[28:59] without form and void and darkness was
[29:01] upon the face of the deep and the spirit
[29:04] of God moved upon the face of the waters
[29:07] and God said let there be light and
[29:09] there was light and God saw the light
[29:12] that it was good and God divided the
[29:14] light from the darkness and God called
[29:17] the light day and the Darkness he called
[29:19] night and the evening and the morning
[29:22] were the first day amen we let you be
[29:25] seated
[29:26] today
[29:28] uh just like
[29:29] to uh speak to you this evening on the
[29:32] spirit of God moved let there be light
[29:36] amen we we
[29:38] um very firmly believe that this world
[29:42] that we're living in wasn't caused by
[29:44] just uh two little particles coming
[29:47] together somehow and meeting together in
[29:49] the space of nothingness and meeting
[29:52] together and it became a a big boom as
[29:54] we know the uh big boom Theory or
[29:56] whatever they have Big Bang Theory but I
[29:59] believe it was a bang I believe it was
[30:00] the word of God that said let there be
[30:03] light and light was formed but as we
[30:06] look reading our scripture there was
[30:07] something that began to take place
[30:10] before all of this took place and that
[30:12] was uh is there just yeah let me give it
[30:16] to you there was a there was a something
[30:20] that be to take place before the spirit
[30:22] before God spoke and that was the spirit
[30:23] of God moved and you know in this world
[30:26] that live in today is a beautiful place
[30:29] we been enjoying some of the beauty here
[30:31] in South Carolina and the beautiful
[30:33] sunsets and things we witnessed but
[30:36] there was a time that it was a formless
[30:38] uh world it was a place of confusion it
[30:41] was a a nothingness an empty space it
[30:45] was Unreal the Wasteland and the
[30:47] Wilderness it was a place of chaos it
[30:49] was it was to be vo it was a void in
[30:52] Wasteland void means to be emptied
[30:55] unfulfilled or desolate or are bearen
[30:57] and this is the world that we're living
[30:59] in and this and there was a time when
[31:01] this world was laying in complete
[31:03] darkness and it was without form and was
[31:05] void and it was all covered with water
[31:08] and laying there in that dark dim dismal
[31:11] gloomy atmosphere but laying in this
[31:14] condition the Bible says the spirit of
[31:16] God be to move and when the spirit of
[31:19] God be to move the word was spoke and
[31:21] the Dynamics was there to bring it to
[31:24] pass the spirit of God proved in that
[31:26] moment that it was greater than the
[31:28] darkness that covered the Earth it was
[31:30] greater than the Gloom it was greater
[31:32] than the coldness it was it was greater
[31:34] than the nothingness was there the light
[31:37] be to Dawn upon the Earth and no doubt
[31:40] you know the Gloom and the coldness and
[31:42] the Darkness and and it all tried to
[31:44] hold its position it tried to keep its
[31:46] place but it could not because the
[31:48] spirit of God was greater than the Gloom
[31:51] it was greater than the darkness amen
[31:54] you know this morning when you got up
[31:55] and you looked and the sun begin to rise
[31:57] or maybe was already up it was the
[31:59] spoken word of God and it's still
[32:02] hanging there today not one of us got up
[32:05] this morning and worried about whether
[32:06] it was going to come up or whether it
[32:08] was going to be there you felt this warm
[32:10] raise you felt it bathe over you you
[32:13] know as you went through this little
[32:14] cold snap it felt good right and and it
[32:16] stands but it's standing there is a sign
[32:19] every morning it rises it defies
[32:21] darkness and it pushes it back to where
[32:23] it belongs and light comes forth proven
[32:26] again every day that light is greater
[32:29] than Darkness amen the sun is a sign
[32:32] that the spirit of God is still greater
[32:35] than any darkness that tries to hold a
[32:37] child of God it's greater than any
[32:39] coldness it's greater than any
[32:41] lukewarmness it's greater than any Gloom
[32:43] any emptiness the is greater than any
[32:46] Spirit of the enemy amen if you can let
[32:48] the spirit of God begin to move the
[32:50] light of God will shine amen there will
[32:53] be births take place there will be
[32:55] changes of Hearts there will be lives
[32:57] that are turned around when the spirit
[32:59] of God moves amen you know it's not you
[33:02] know I I know we we want the word and

[39:10] was about the funniest thing I ever seen
[39:12] he said that wasn't no little trickle
[39:14] that fed that watered two million people
[39:16] and all their animals no it was a
[39:18] gusher neither is this Holy Ghost a
[39:21] little trickle but it's a fountain an
[39:23] inexhaustible Fountain of Life amen it's
[39:26] free whosoever will let him come and
[39:31] drink the spirit of God moved upon the
[39:33] waters and the word spoken let there be

[39:42] that for down beneath that water there
[39:45] were seeds he had there amen he had to
[39:48] have the sunlight to make it live
[39:50] Colossians 1:12 says giving thanks unto
[39:53] the Father which has made us to be
[39:55] partakers of the inheritance of the
[39:57] Saints and light who has delivered us
[39:59] from the power of darkness and has
[40:01] translated Us in the Kingdom of his dear
[40:03] son and whom we have Redemption through
[40:05] his blood even the forgiveness of sin so
[40:09] down beyond all that darkness and all
[40:11] that Gloom and all that un all that
[40:13] nothingness laid seeds down there laid
[40:16] life that he was or something that was
[40:18] ordained to life and so there had to be
[40:21] something that could pull upon it and
[40:23] bring it
[40:25] out Hallelujah so he said the spirit of
[40:28] God begin to go over the face of the
[40:30] waters and begin to woo and begin to
[40:32] call and begin to move and a word spoke
[40:35] and said let there be life cuz down
[40:37] there was a seed down there was a life
[40:40] that was ordained Amen to come to
[40:42] fruition and I I remember the time when
[40:45] I was also down in sin and also also
[40:48] Darkness was all around me but the
[40:50] spirit of God begin to woo and it begin
[40:52] to pull up and it begin to move let me
[40:55] tell you when there spirit of God begins
[40:57] to move there ain't enough sin there
[40:59] ain't enough doubt there ain't enough
[41:00] unbelief there ain't enough darkness
[41:02] that can cover a seed of God and keep it
[41:05] from coming
[41:06] [Applause]
[41:08] up
[41:10] Hallelujah the first light that was ever
[41:12] given in the Earth was God's spoken word
[41:16] the first light that ever struck the
[41:18] Earth was God's spoken word he said let
[41:20] there be light and there was light that
[41:23] turned Darkness into light in order to
[41:25] bring forth a creation of joy and life
[41:28] upon the Earth then the spirit of God as
[41:31] it moved with love and compassion at
[41:33] that great day the first day of the dawn
[41:35] of creation upon the Earth the Sun Rose
[41:38] and it swept across his ways and it
[41:40] dried up the waters from the earth and
[41:42] made an atmosphere above and for the
[41:44] first time it was to bring joy and life
[41:48] to the Earth by
[41:50] seed that was a great hour that word was
[41:53] with the world was without form it was
[41:55] void dark dark Ness was on the earth
[41:57] nothing but complete chaos and when the
[42:00] world was in that condition the spirit
[42:02] of God moved upon the face of the world
[42:04] it changed the whole picture of the
[42:06] world it went from Total Chaos to a
[42:09] Garden of Eden it was the word that
[42:11] brought a transforming power of God and
[42:14] the spirit was there to bring it to pass
[42:16] it takes the moving of the spirit to
[42:19] bring seeds to
[42:21] life amen that's why we can't stand for
[42:24] some cold formal dead religion
[42:26] amen or some doctr that's cut off the
[42:29] spirit of God we must have the moving of
[42:32] the spirit in our
[42:34] church amen we must because it's a
[42:37] spirit that quickens the word it's a
[42:39] spirit that quickens the
[42:42] seed amen or otherwise it just sits
[42:45] there in dead formal conditions but if
[42:48] you'll let the spirit begin to move and
[42:50] begin to woo over it and begin to call
[42:52] it it'll call it out of that dead
[42:54] formalism it'll call it out of that sin
[42:56] I've seen it as it begin to move in the
[42:58] service and there begin to woo on the
[43:00] heart and it begin to pull them out of
[43:03] their sin out of their doubts out of
[43:05] their
[43:06] [Applause]
[43:09] fear he's that kind of
[43:12] God he knows how to

[45:17] on her contamination wow he was willing
[45:19] to take her sins and take her
[45:22] unworthiness and make her clean yeah and
[45:26] I'm preaching that and I didn't know out

[55:16] gospel is the word of God he said not
[55:19] all together brother the Bible said the
[55:22] gospel came to us not in word only but
[55:25] also but through Power and demonstration
[55:27] of the Holy Ghost to preach the word the
[55:30] letter kth but the spirit giveth life
[55:33] Jesus said go into all the world and
[55:35] preach the gospel then interpret to
[55:37] Every Creature then interpret it in the
[55:39] Bible forms means to go into all the
[55:40] world and demonstrate the power of the
[55:44] word by the Holy
[55:46] Ghost demonstrate the power of the word
[55:49] by the Holy Ghost and these signs shall
[55:51] follow them that believe which signs
[55:54] what signs we go to church we pay our
[55:56] dues we treat our neighbor right that's
[55:58] wonderful but that ain't what Jesus said
[56:00] these signs shall follow them that
[56:02] believe these signs in my name they
[56:05] shall cast out
[56:06] Devils come on now amen speak with new

[56:30] Spirit he's the one that quickens the
[56:34] promise how you going past that how you
[56:37] going to get past that the Holy Spirit
[56:39] should know for he's the life that's in
[56:41] the word he's the one that quickens the
[56:43] word just like your spirit quickens your
[56:46] body without the spirit in this body
[56:48] this body's dead the body is quickened
[56:51] by the spirit without the spirit the
[56:53] body is no effect the body is dead the
[56:56] word is dead without the spirit it takes
[57:00] Spirit to bring forth the word to make
[57:01] it live and he is the quickener of the
[57:05] word now you can't have all spirit and
[57:08] no word
[57:09] either amen so when brother Brandon was
[57:12] talking about some of those that are
[57:13] jumping and shouting and carrying on and
[57:15] going after a gift he was talking to
[57:17] word
[57:19] rejectors I'm not a word
[57:22] rejector amen it's the word that I see
[57:25] that get that causes a reaction on the
[57:27] inside of me when I see his word being
[57:31] fulfilled I seen he sent Malachi 4 I
[57:34] seen he sent Revelations 10:7 I see it
[57:36] all being fulfilled and it causes
[57:39] something on the inside of
[57:41] me Hallelujah I've also saw that my
[57:45] name's been written on the
[57:47] book and when John saw it he said all of
[57:50] Heaven all of all all the Earth all
[57:52] below the Earth heard I John Shout
[57:55] in why because it was something on the
[57:58] inside of it he saw it wasn't just dead
[58:00] letter no more but he was there he was
[58:03] in the book he was in there and I have
[58:05] also saw that I am in the
[58:08] book it isn't just about Ruth and
[58:11] Rebecca and Abraham and Sarah and a
[58:13] bunch of stories and fairy tales no it's
[58:15] telling about me it's telling about you
[58:18] it's telling about all of us in the day
[58:20] that we live
[58:22] in and it caus us to rejoice
[58:26] God so pardon me that's
[58:29] right
[58:31] amen you know brother brand talked about
[58:33] this and I also been in this same place
[58:36] but thankfully I was in the daylight and
[58:37] it was still a spooky Place brother
[58:39] Brandon finds himself out in the whole
[58:40] burnover one day or one night on the
[58:42] moon lit
[58:44] night he said he' been you know what he
[58:47] said this man was little
[58:49] different he said he was wanting to get
[58:51] a closer look at a Grizzly that ain't me
[58:54] no no no no that ain't me but he finds
[58:58] himself trying to find this grizzly and
[58:59] gets out kind of turned around and finds
[59:01] himself in this place after dark and
[59:03] he's he finds himself there and he's and
[59:06] the wind begins to hit him and and he
[59:08] begins to look at this old burnover and
[59:10] these old Pines that once stood there so
[59:12] beautifully but now they grave look like
[59:14] a graveyard a spooky looking place and
[59:17] here come a wind coming down wind began
[59:19] to hit him and go moo that's time I
[59:22] heard that brother Doug Baker took me up
[59:24] on Mount Lemon it just had experienced
[59:26] of fire was sitting on the side of that
[59:28] mountain wind got to blowing up through
[59:30] there and may heard that noise it make
[59:32] the hair stand up on I couldn't imagine
[59:33] what it' be like on a moonlit
[59:36] night but anyway he he said see what had
[59:39] happened he said I stood there I thought
[59:41] what is what is the Lord trying to show
[59:42] me here and these trees but he said I'm
[59:44] begin to realize these trees put me in
[59:46] the mind of some of these great F
[59:47] inspired churches just as dead as a
[59:50] doornail even the Palmer worms eat all
[59:52] the bark off of them and everything the
[59:54] fiery trials has blazed all the spirit
[59:56] away and there's nothing left but a
[59:58] great big stature just as dead as it can
[1:00:00] be and he said when the rushing Mighty
[1:00:02] Wind comes from Heaven the only thing
[1:00:04] they can do is grown and carry on and
[1:00:06] say it ain't so knowing know not hardly
[1:00:08] knowing anything and they say days of
[1:00:11] Miracles are
[1:00:12] passed listen that's not just
[1:00:14] denominational systems anymore that's
[1:00:16] message there's message preachers saying
[1:00:18] we're not in the days of Miracles no
[1:00:22] more why because these these fires have
[1:00:25] burn off the bark burn off the life and
[1:00:28] the spirit of God can't resonate in
[1:00:30] their life no
[1:00:32] more and just about it just every time
[1:00:34] God sends a Revival and signs of Wonders
[1:00:36] begin to come follow among the people
[1:00:38] they say all the days of Miracles are
[1:00:40] pass he said I sat there and that was
[1:00:42] scripture come to mind it was over in
[1:00:43] Joy what the palor worm left the caterer
[1:00:46] eaten what the caterpillars left the loc
[1:00:48] is eaten on down different insects have
[1:00:51] eaten out of the life of the tree if you
[1:00:52] notice that's the same insect all all
[1:00:54] the way down it's just different
[1:00:56] manifestations of it he said here I
[1:00:58] stand in them trees once they were great
[1:01:00] trees once they had a great kingly
[1:01:02] position and they moved kingly as the
[1:01:04] wind blew them but now what's the
[1:01:06] difference something happened the sapl
[1:01:08] line the lifeline of that tree has been
[1:01:11] taken away wow I thought what does this
[1:01:14] mean I began to think of the places
[1:01:16] where I've been people I'd heard iosing
[1:01:19] I heard opposing saying the days of
[1:01:21] Miracles are passed I thought that's
[1:01:22] right that's just like some of those
[1:01:24] great big high aspired churches that
[1:01:26] stand with great big names behind them
[1:01:28] historical names that once we were so
[1:01:31] and so once we were so and so but the
[1:01:33] lifeline has been
[1:01:38] cut you know we was at we had our family
[1:01:41] Camp there in Texas it was at a Nazarene
[1:01:45] Campground first year we was there there
[1:01:47] was some helpers some volunteers had
[1:01:50] come to help them work on that thing and
[1:01:52] so they would come to some of the
[1:01:53] services one of the older men sat in the
[1:01:56] back and he just he would just ball
[1:01:58] wouldn't he just ball cry his eyes out
[1:02:01] and and we we get through the service
[1:02:03] and he walked out and told Brother Daryl
[1:02:04] backer one of our deacons he says he
[1:02:06] said I sit here in amazement he said
[1:02:08] because I'm a Nazarene he said we used
[1:02:11] to have services like
[1:02:14] that I'm thinking used to you can still
[1:02:17] have
[1:02:17] them amen not maybe where you're at move
[1:02:21] there you go move with the spirit of God
[1:02:23] it left a long time ago move with it
[1:02:26] amen listen this is where we are facing
[1:02:29] as a message Community if I can say it
[1:02:30] that way amen the bark is being stripped
[1:02:33] off they're calling it fanaticism
[1:02:35] they're calling it a bunch of emotional
[1:02:37] workup they're calling it all kind of
[1:02:39] ugly names and it's the spirit of God
[1:02:41] that's wanting to move among the people
[1:02:43] to set them free yeah
[1:02:49] amen listen I I don't care if a man's a
[1:02:53] teacher a preacher evangelist
[1:02:54] if he's preaching things of a gone day
[1:02:56] gone by he's preaching something that
[1:02:59] ain't
[1:03:00] true amen he said listen he says it
[1:03:02] right here he said a denomination from
[1:03:05] time of the early reformation and their
[1:03:07] Founders he said what happened he said a
[1:03:09] new set of teachers got in and cut all
[1:03:11] the real life of the Holy Spirit out
[1:03:13] they were made to a away they made they
[1:03:15] were made to sway in the rushing Mighty
[1:03:18] Wind like came on the day of Pentecost
[1:03:20] but now when God continually sends us
[1:03:22] wind they lay down only thing they can
[1:03:24] do is moan they moan the days of
[1:03:26] Miracles are passed there's no such a
[1:03:28] thing as the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:03:30] all these things are passed away what a
[1:03:32] spooky place to be oh wow what a spooky
[1:03:36] place to be I thought oh no no doubt
[1:03:39] they were trees they had history behind
[1:03:41] them trees but the life was gone and he
[1:03:43] said that's what's the matter with a
[1:03:44] Pentecostal Presbyterian Methodist
[1:03:46] Baptist Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness and
[1:03:48] the denominational bugs has eat the life
[1:03:51] out of it and it just become an old dead
[1:03:53] spire and we need what we need is a
[1:03:56] coming of the rushing Mighty Wind and a
[1:03:58] new Lifeline to receive it and a new
[1:04:01] Lifeline to receive it he said oh don't
[1:04:03] misunderstand me I'm not condemning the
[1:04:06] church or the organization I'm
[1:04:07] condemning the lack of Christ in those
[1:04:09] places the only thing that makes them
[1:04:12] grown and moan when God sends the Holy
[1:04:14] Ghost Revival to the world is because of
[1:04:17] the lack of flexible life in them to
[1:04:19] receive it the Holy Ghost fell on the
[1:04:21] day of Pentecost for whosoever will
[1:04:23] believe it shall receive it Peter said
[1:04:25] it in Acts 2:38 repent every one of you
[1:04:28] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:04:30] Christ for the remission of your sin and
[1:04:32] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:04:34] Ghost for the promise is unto you and
[1:04:37] your children and to them that are far
[1:04:39] off even as many as the Lord Our God
[1:04:41] will call if God is still calling the
[1:04:44] holy spirit is still
[1:04:47] falling I didn't make that up that's a
[1:04:50] direct quote if the God is still calling
[1:04:53] the Holy Ghost is still
[1:04:56] falling it's got to
[1:05:01] be but we find
[1:05:04] them we find them where they've lost all
[1:05:07] the power they lost the
[1:05:10] ability they don't even believe in
[1:05:12] praying for the sick no
[1:05:14] more they don't believe in prayer lines
[1:05:16] and altar calls and all that's
[1:05:18] out and I'm not even talking about
[1:05:20] denominational I'm talking about us it's
[1:05:23] all put there somewhere else listen if
[1:05:26] the spirit if God is still calling the
[1:05:29] spirit's still falling yes sir God is

[1:25:04] me I know what I was and I know what I
[1:25:08] am I know what I used to be but I know
[1:25:11] who God has called me to
[1:25:14] be pardon the noise
[1:25:17] amen God maybe you come here like that
[1:25:20] Prophet all stewed up tonight Satan
[1:25:22] tends to do that on a meeting night you
[1:25:24] know meetings are not easy
[1:25:28] to oh yeah I know I'm on the right track
[1:25:32] now meetings ain't easy all kind of
[1:25:34] things can happen stuff get tore up this
[1:25:37] that and the other and people get stewed
[1:25:38] up and stirred up and temper that's what
[1:25:40] happened to this prophet he he got him
[1:25:42] they had a meeting and he seen somebody
[1:25:44] out there he didn't really like and he
[1:25:47] got all stirred up why did he come in
[1:25:50] here why is he here what is wrong he
[1:25:54] said the spirit of God couldn't come on
[1:25:56] that stewed up prophet he said but he
[1:25:58] had to get him a minstral and begin to
[1:26:00] play an oldfashioned Holy Ghost Song
[1:26:03] Glory and the spirit of God came down on
[1:26:05] the pro that's why our music is
[1:26:07] important that's why our song leading is
[1:26:10] important it ain't just getting up
[1:26:11] singing a pretty tune no it's leading in
[1:26:13] worship it's creating an
[1:26:17] atmosphere so that atmospheres can be
[1:26:19] settled and Demon Spirits can be driven
[1:26:21] out listen God knew what he was doing
[1:26:23] when he sent the worshippers before the
[1:26:25] Warriors he did it Time After Time After
[1:26:28] Time he would actually sometimes and
[1:26:30] they would go and sing and before they
[1:26:31] could ever pull a sword God had already
[1:26:33] defeated their enemy wow wow because of
[1:26:36] what they done in worshiping him
[1:26:39] amen it
[1:26:43] happens I wish I knew the key though
[1:26:45] there sometimes you can come to a
[1:26:47] service and from the word go
[1:26:50] it's like a torch
[1:26:53] settling torch is blowing you know and
[1:26:55] blowing out cutting out metal and all
[1:26:56] kinds of it's incredible then sometimes
[1:26:58] you come and you're just pushing and
[1:27:00] pushing and pushing don't seem like you
[1:27:01] ever get I wish I knew what the key
[1:27:05] was I I believe it's an
[1:27:08] [Applause]
[1:27:10] expectation I believe it's expecting God
[1:27:12] to move and God to change lives and God
[1:27:15] to heal and God to do what he said he
[1:27:17] would do amen and this is what happened
[1:27:20] his the man the prophet expectations got
[1:27:23] changed he said see he said the spirit
[1:27:25] of God come down on the prophet that's
[1:27:27] right God doesn't change God Like Music
[1:27:29] in that day God likes music today he
[1:27:32] began to sing an old song I don't know
[1:27:33] what they played in them day but I
[1:27:35] imagine a good old song like there is
[1:27:36] going to be a meeting in the air in the
[1:27:39] sweet sweet well I like the slow song by
[1:27:42] and by on God's on song will be the
[1:27:46] leading one something like that some of
[1:27:48] them good oldfashioned Holy Ghost songs
[1:27:51] and the spirit of God came on the
[1:27:53] prophet he said I tell you brother when
[1:27:55] you get all the formal shackles shook
[1:27:57] off and the spirit of God and the songs
[1:28:00] again and get back to an old place where
[1:28:02] we can have the spirit of God moving
[1:28:04] again then the prophet can see a vision
[1:28:07] then the powers of God can come into the
[1:28:09] church then we will see Divine
[1:28:11] Healing then we'll see the resurrection
[1:28:14] of Christ then we'll see the same
[1:28:16] yesterday today and forever you say well
[1:28:18] brother brandom I'm not a prophet well
[1:28:20] if you ain't a prophet you can can be
[1:28:22] one of the instruments
[1:28:23] anyhow wow that's right you ain't got no
[1:28:26] more than them 10 strings give bit to
[1:28:29] them as hard as you
[1:28:31] can amen if you can't be a prophet be
[1:28:34] one of the minstrels do something to
[1:28:37] bring the spirit of the Lord down yeah
[1:28:41] amen it ain't all behind the desk it's
[1:28:43] right there do something to bring the
[1:28:46] Holy Ghost down it might be a cry that
[1:28:49] says God come by my way and all of a
[1:28:52] sudden the spirit of God comes and
[1:28:54] answers that
[1:28:58] prayer it can happen
[1:29:01] Hallelujah do something to bring the
[1:29:03] spirit of God
[1:29:07] down just tell you you probably heard
[1:29:09] the story but it's again my mom had her
[1:29:13] first brain bleed and she's back home
[1:29:15] and and she's sitting on the side of her
[1:29:18] bed
[1:29:20] distraught wondering how things are
[1:29:21] going going to be wonder how her life's
[1:29:23] going to be kind of the dump so to speak
[1:29:27] actually brother Mike and sister
[1:29:29] Bethany we living with them at the time
[1:29:31] where they were building their house
[1:29:33] living in the upstairs and she brought
[1:29:35] little Drew set him in the middle of the
[1:29:37] floor oh Drew special little child he's
[1:29:41] 18 months old never walked or crawled
[1:29:44] but he had been seen in a vision walking
[1:29:47] just a few months prior to that in a
[1:29:48] prayer line why I still believe in
[1:29:51] prayer lines amen cuz I know they still
[1:29:54] work amen and so here they are here they
[1:29:59] are she's she's in this
[1:30:01] situation uh Bethany comes in begins to
[1:30:04] talk to her and it goes like this she
[1:30:06] just begin to turn from her thoughts of
[1:30:09] the moment to her thoughts of God and
[1:30:12] how good he'd been to her and she just
[1:30:15] begin to raise her hands there in her
[1:30:16] bedroom and she began to worship God
[1:30:20] right there in the bedroom and that you
[1:30:21] know what that did that was a Minstrel
[1:30:23] to bring the spirit of God down and the
[1:30:25] spirit of God fell in that room and in
[1:30:27] that moment my mom was giving her
[1:30:29] eyesight back you couldn't see on the
[1:30:31] peripheral vision from that brain bleed
[1:30:33] and it was restored and as it went
[1:30:35] across to her it moved across to her and
[1:30:37] across little Drew sitting over there in
[1:30:39] the middle of the floor a little 18-y
[1:30:41] old boy that never walked or crawled
[1:30:43] underdeveloped in one of his hips or
[1:30:45] something was wrong with him the doctor
[1:30:46] said going to need all kinds of things
[1:30:48] but anyway the spirit of God moves and
[1:30:50] out of the floor this little little boy
[1:30:52] stands up wow and it begins to run all
[1:30:55] over the
[1:30:56] house ran all over the house I remember
[1:31:00] that day getting a video little Drew
[1:31:02] running all over his house and M his mom
[1:31:04] running behind him with a camera look at
[1:31:06] him run look at him run look what was it
[1:31:09] it was because somebody became a
[1:31:11] Minstrel they got their thoughts off of
[1:31:13] what their condition and their thoughts
[1:31:16] over their present time and what was
[1:31:18] going on and what was happening and what
[1:31:20] was wrong and what future was and got
[1:31:23] their thoughts on their
[1:31:25] God come on somebody somebody do that
[1:31:28] tonight get it off your thoughts get it
[1:31:31] off your problems get it off your
[1:31:33] pressures and get it on your
[1:31:35] God and if you'll get it on your God he
[1:31:38] is still on the throne he is still in
[1:31:41] control the devil does not have control
[1:31:44] over your life over your life over
[1:31:46] anybody's life God is on the throne and
[1:31:50] he's still in control over you
[1:31:52] [Applause]
[1:31:53] we just need a minstral need somebody
[1:31:56] that'll move into the realm of the Holy
[1:31:58] Ghost and begin to cry out and say God I
[1:32:01] need you don't pass me by this weekend
[1:32:05] don't pass me by In This Moment I need a
[1:32:07] touch and I'm not going on without you I
[1:32:10] need more than I had
[1:32:14] yesterday spirit of God
[1:32:20] move
[1:32:22] yeah that's how I say it here when the
[1:32:25] Holy Spirit begins to move and give
[1:32:27] discernment and that is to bring the
[1:32:29] presence of God Among the people notice
[1:32:32] what he says discernment God the spirit
[1:32:35] begins to move and brings discernment
[1:32:37] that's to bring the spirit of God Among
[1:32:39] the people just
[1:32:41] like just like singing a
[1:32:44] hym shouting a message given in unknown
[1:32:48] tongues or something it brings the
[1:32:50] spirit of God Among the people yeah you
[1:32:52] heard your pastor preach it many times
[1:32:54] on the word under the spirit gets the
[1:32:56] moveing into the people and they just
[1:32:57] scream out they can't hold their peace
[1:32:59] no more because the spirit of God begins
[1:33:01] to move he said the spirit of God takes
[1:33:04] the word to the congregation and feeds
[1:33:07] them and they grow spiritually on that
[1:33:10] word why because of the spirit of God
[1:33:12] bringing it to them Hallelujah if it
[1:33:15] isn't the spirit of God it's man's
[1:33:17] intellectual
[1:33:19] abilities now we don't want that as what
[1:33:21] Paul said in 1 Corinthians 2 he said and
[1:33:24] my speech and my preaching was not with
[1:33:26] enticing words of man's Wisdom but in
[1:33:29] demonstration of the spirit and power so
[1:33:31] that your faith would not stand in the
[1:33:33] wisdom of men but in the power of
[1:33:36] God today with great intellectual
[1:33:38] messages they can explain it to you see
[1:33:40] the picture it's a direct quote that
[1:33:43] isn't this a surge we would see Jesus he
[1:33:46] said that isn't what we're looking for
[1:33:48] tonight we're not looking for the
[1:33:50] mechanics we're looking looking for the
[1:33:52] Dynamics we got the mechanics of the
[1:33:55] religions of the Bible so
[1:33:57] bized it looks like a great big 16 or 35
[1:34:00] coach trained sitting out there on the
[1:34:02] track but they ain't got enough steam in
[1:34:04] it to move it down it takes the Dynamics
[1:34:06] to perform the mechanics that's what we
[1:34:09] need now is to see that that's what
[1:34:11] we've been taught all these years is the
[1:34:12] truth or is it not it's been explained
[1:34:14] over and over and over through different
[1:34:16] Seminary churches so forth until we're
[1:34:18] looking to see who this person is you
[1:34:19] say well brother brandham how would you
[1:34:21] do it well did you notice they came to
[1:34:23] the servant of Christ who had been
[1:34:24] trained to how to what to do not just to
[1:34:27] say sit down stay waake you sit right
[1:34:29] here I explain it no he brought them
[1:34:31] straight to
[1:34:33] him he brought them straight to him
[1:34:35] because that's what they wanted to see
[1:34:37] they said we would see Jesus not would
[1:34:40] you explain it to us and tell us all
[1:34:42] about it that wasn't the question they
[1:34:44] wanted to see
[1:34:46] Jesus they wanted to see Jesus he said
[1:34:50] we find we couldn't find him and find
[1:34:51] lectures and we cuz people find find
[1:34:54] people who can stand up and explain the
[1:34:55] word in such a way it's just
[1:34:56] breathtaking but what we find is just a
[1:34:59] lecture it's just mechanics we find an
[1:35:01] Entertainer and go through all the
[1:35:02] action and so forth that still isn't it
[1:35:04] what we're looking for we're finding the
[1:35:06] religious type with the ropes on and so
[1:35:08] forth we're not not what we're looking
[1:35:09] for no we're looking for the person
[1:35:12] Jesus Christ Jesus Christ manifested the
[1:35:15] same yesterday today and
[1:35:18] forever so we're out in the middle again
[1:35:20] because there is everything this is
[1:35:22] church says we got it that church says
[1:35:23] we got it this church says we got it and
[1:35:25] so forth if you got it you would show it
[1:35:29] if you got it you would show it the
[1:35:31] person Christ
[1:35:34] Jesus God is here Jesus Christ the same
[1:35:37] yesterday today and forever his power is
[1:35:39] just the same today as it was he does
[1:35:41] not fail he will not fail he is God he
[1:35:44] has to remain God right sir we would see
[1:35:47] Jesus not hear the mechanics but see the
[1:35:50] dynamic of him all
[1:35:53] right
[1:35:57] amen Jesus said go into all the world
[1:35:59] and
[1:36:02] preach preach the gospel he didn't say
[1:36:05] this is a direct quote teach this or
[1:36:08] teach that go and preach the preach is
[1:36:10] to demonstrate the power of the Holy
[1:36:13] Spirit now that's not against godall
[1:36:16] teachers a godall teacher will still
[1:36:19] demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:22] amen these signs shall follow them if it
[1:36:25] don't come by lecture that's right they
[1:36:27] that believe it doesn't come by lecture
[1:36:28] it comes by the presence of the Living
[1:36:31] God moving Among Us in human flesh
[1:36:33] proving himself he's the same yesterday
[1:36:35] today and forever he never fails to be
[1:36:38] the same it comes so simple that the
[1:36:40] Simplicity of it is what drives the
[1:36:41] intellectual mind away from it we said
[1:36:44] last night we have so much of the
[1:36:45] mechanics amen this is a different quote
[1:36:47] we got so much of the mechanics and not
[1:36:49] the Dynamics my body is the mean
[1:36:51] mechanics but my body will not operate
[1:36:53] without the Dynamics the spirit the
[1:36:55] spirit operates my body and brings it
[1:36:58] into control another place in Fall world
[1:37:01] falling apart he said we study the
[1:37:02] mechanics until it's all
[1:37:05] mechanical but we want the
[1:37:09] Dynamics we we can study the mechanics
[1:37:12] of how you wire a building how you put
[1:37:15] all white wires is this and neutral and
[1:37:17] the black wires is the power and the bar
[1:37:19] wires the ground and and you got these
[1:37:21] plugs and you put these here and you do
[1:37:23] this all here and there's got to be
[1:37:24] certain codes but if it ain't got no
[1:37:26] power to it what good is all
[1:37:28] that won't light nothing it wouldn't
[1:37:30] light a a smallest of a light bulb it
[1:37:32] wouldn't do nothing but if you put the
[1:37:34] power to it it'll cause things to react
[1:37:37] it'll cause things to move it'll cause
[1:37:39] things to operate it'll cause all the
[1:37:42] things that's in the word if you'll put
[1:37:43] the power to it all these are all this
[1:37:46] mechanic is all wonderful and we need
[1:37:48] every bit of it but we also need the P
[1:37:50] power of the mechanics amen the spirit
[1:37:53] that could come behind the word and
[1:37:55] begin to make it live in our lives amen
[1:37:57] that is not a bunch of head knowledge we
[1:37:59] got a bunch of people that's got doctor
[1:38:01] degrees in the message but they can't
[1:38:03] live a life worthy of the Gospel but I'm
[1:38:05] here to tell you there is a power that
[1:38:07] can come into a life that can change
[1:38:09] them from glory to glory and they never
[1:38:12] be the same
[1:38:13] [Applause]
[1:38:15] again Lord we have taught it so much in
[1:38:17] in the message ranks that people have
[1:38:19] taught the moving of the spirit all the
[1:38:21] way out that we don't even need the
[1:38:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost no more that
[1:38:24] ain't nothing but a false worm that's
[1:38:26] got in this message it's time to cut it
[1:38:28] out we need the power of God we need the
[1:38:32] Dynamics of the Holy Ghost we need the
[1:38:34] one who's the resurrection and the life
[1:38:36] the one that Rose him from the dead and
[1:38:38] is still here moving in his
[1:38:42] children we don't need just a bunch of
[1:38:44] dead
[1:38:45] theology the Sun is
[1:38:48] up therefore if the Sun is up we can
[1:38:51] have both Dynamics and
[1:38:53] mechanics the spirit of God and the word
[1:38:56] of God we need both of them that's what
[1:38:59] makes the engine go down the road let's
[1:39:02] bow our
[1:39:13] heads Mercy this ain't some mythical
[1:39:17] story but it's a
[1:39:20] reality
[1:39:21] ain't some yesterday's knowledge it's a
[1:39:25] it's a it's a power of word for
[1:39:33] today he here to make it
[1:39:38] live here to
[1:39:40] operate change
[1:39:42] lives change you from Glory unto
[1:39:46] Glory made one step why not make another
[1:39:50] step a continuation it ain't get the
[1:39:53] Holy Ghost and put a period to it or get
[1:39:56] justification and that's all
[1:39:58] sanctification no keep
[1:40:00] moving keep
[1:40:02] moving allowing him to come and move
[1:40:06] through your life
[1:40:08] and move out the worldly influences and
[1:40:12] worldly thoughts
[1:40:19] and we want him to be God and we worship
[1:40:22] him as God but many times we don't want
[1:40:24] him to be
[1:40:26] Lord that's to have rulership or
[1:40:29] ownership over our
[1:40:36] lives through this weekend would say
[1:40:38] Lord let me be a minstral yes let me be
[1:40:42] a minstral if the Holy Ghost can move
[1:40:44] down
[1:40:46] through yes
[1:40:47] Lord let me be one Lord
[1:40:52] let me know you in the fullness of the
[1:40:54] power of the resurrected Jesus

[1:41:00] of a time of refilling for some some of
[1:41:03] you that's been in the way a long time

[1:50:39] to me
[1:50:45] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[1:50:49] you know I was thinking thinking as
[1:50:50] brother Timothy was speaking right out
[1:50:52] of the gate all that chaos and darkness
[1:50:55] and Gloom yeah but you know God had seed
[1:50:58] down in
[1:50:59] there and it occurred to me that God
[1:51:03] doesn't do something for nothing if he
[1:51:06] put the seed down in there he was always
[1:51:08] going to bring it
[1:51:10] out the only thing brother Bram said
[1:51:12] that darkness that Gloom that chaos oh
[1:51:14] it was just in the way so the voice of
[1:51:16] God spoke and said Let There Be Love
[1:51:20] he wasn't talking to the sun it was
[1:51:22] already there he wasn't talking to the
[1:51:24] seed it was already there amen yeah the
[1:51:28] seed is already in you God would not
[1:51:30] have put that seed in you if he didn't
[1:51:33] intend for it to come out oh friends why
[1:51:36] don't you cast aside your fear and open
[1:51:40] up your heart and say Lord bring
[1:51:43] everything out of this seed of gene of
[1:51:45] God that you have ordained before the
[1:51:48] foundation of the world amen amen I
[1:51:51] found out something tonight I finally
[1:51:54] got an answer to the
[1:51:56] mystery why I cannot keep my foot off
[1:52:00] the throttle when I'm
[1:52:02] preaching I found out that it's because
[1:52:05] there's an unseen force of the holy
[1:52:08] ghost moving us and it excites that Born
[1:52:11] Again
[1:52:14] Spirit Hallelujah finally have an
[1:52:17] answer amen I thought I was just weird
[1:52:20] but I am not weird neither are you but
[1:52:23] that Holy Spirit excites my Born Again
[1:52:28] Spirit oh blessed be the name of the
[1:52:31] Lord you know I'm tell you something
[1:52:34] seriously friends I thought about
[1:52:39] David you know do you ever realize and
[1:52:43] if you say no I never realized it then
[1:52:45] you were standing with me I never
[1:52:46] thought about it till tonight brother
[1:52:48] Timothy was bringing that out
[1:52:50] David
[1:52:51] didn't David didn't get an Angelic
[1:52:55] visit there there was nothing David
[1:52:57] didn't have a
[1:53:00] vision I mean you know brother bradam
[1:53:02] talked about the strength he said oh if
[1:53:03] I could just see a vision he said then
[1:53:05] it wouldn't matter you know you don't
[1:53:06] know what that does David didn't see a
[1:53:08] vision no a no angel visited David and
[1:53:11] said you're going to go and this what's
[1:53:13] going to happen do you know the only
[1:53:14] thing that happened to David is David
[1:53:17] remembered that God had already
[1:53:19] delivered him from a lion and a bear in
[1:53:23] the line of duty now I don't know if
[1:53:26] you've ever met anyone but a highly
[1:53:27] doubt you've ever met a human that runs
[1:53:29] toward a
[1:53:31] lion or runs toward a bear everybody
[1:53:35] runs away from them David ran towards
[1:53:39] them in the line of duty and slew them
[1:53:43] with a slingshot in his bare hands what
[1:53:46] farmer have you ever seen a Rancher run
[1:53:48] toward an animal with his bare hands to
[1:53:50] save one of his livestock a bear or a
[1:53:52] lion maybe if he's got a rifle David
[1:53:54] didn't have a rifle David had to run
[1:53:57] towards him with no Angelic visit and no
[1:54:01] vision and brother brandham said it like
[1:54:03] this David just when he saw that lion
[1:54:05] grabb that sheep he knew he had a duty
[1:54:08] to protect his father's sheep he saw
[1:54:10] when he saw that bear and he said David
[1:54:12] said now Lord I'm I'm here that's my
[1:54:15] responsibility now you be with me and he
[1:54:17] took off you say you know but the but
[1:54:20] the Goliath was impossible the bear was
[1:54:24] impossible the lion was impossible David
[1:54:27] didn't need a vision David just knew
[1:54:29] that God had already done the impossible
[1:54:32] and all he done was remember that
[1:54:35] friends how how many times have we have
[1:54:38] to say I'm ashamed to say that how many
[1:54:41] times I have forgotten all the
[1:54:44] impossible things the Lord has already
[1:54:46] done for me and I come up on Impossible
[1:54:48] thing and I say oh it's impossible
[1:54:50] oh my why don't you remember how many
[1:54:52] God impossible things that you can
[1:54:54] testify tonight and say I know God did
[1:54:57] this and it was
[1:54:59] impossible oh throw down your fear throw
[1:55:02] down your Gloom cast aside that chaos
[1:55:06] and allow the word of God to bring forth
[1:55:10] that seed Lord oh my goodness my
[1:55:14] goodness I'm sure you can tell the Holy
[1:55:17] Spirit excites my born again
[1:55:21] Spirit you love the Lord do you enjoy
[1:55:24] the word of God tonight you want to go
[1:55:26] out of here and do it that way now be
[1:55:28] like David say I'm going to just
[1:55:30] remember what God has already done for
[1:55:33] me and when he heard that uncircumcised
[1:55:36] Philistine he said here's another
[1:55:38] impossible situation the same God that
[1:55:41] delivered the me from The Lion that's
[1:55:43] what he said it's what he told the king
[1:55:45] king said you can't fight him he's a
[1:55:47] warrior you're just a youth he said but
[1:55:49] but I but the Lord already the same God
[1:55:52] that delivered me from The Lion and
[1:55:54] delivered me from the bear will deliver
[1:55:55] me from this sun to David it was a
[1:55:59] no-brainer oh I want to have that kind
[1:56:01] of Faith friends don't live in chaos
