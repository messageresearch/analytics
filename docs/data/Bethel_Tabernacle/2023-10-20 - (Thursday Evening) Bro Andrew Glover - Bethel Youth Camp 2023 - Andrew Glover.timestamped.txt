[37:38] straight to the word here in the Book of
[37:40] Proverbs the fourth
[37:42] chapter in the 23rd verse uh the Bible
[37:46] here speaks to us very direct it says
[37:49] keep thy heart with all diligence for
[37:53] out of it are the issues of life and man
[37:56] I I believe that's more than a
[37:57] suggestion I believe that's a
[37:59] commandment keep thy heart with all
[38:01] diligence for out of it are the issues
[38:04] of Life put away from thee a forward
[38:07] mouth and perverse lips put far from
[38:11] thee in the book of St John the 7th
[38:13] chapter in the book of St John the 7th
[38:16] chapter I want to read one verse there
[38:19] in St John chapter
[38:22] 7 verse
[38:24] 38 Jesus here is speaking in St John 7
[38:30] and verse 38 and he says these words he
[38:32] says he that believeth on me how many
[38:35] believes on him he that believeth on me
[38:39] as the scripture has said out of his
[38:42] belly shall flow somebody say flow shall
[38:46] flow rivers of Living Water notice it
[38:50] didn't say out of my belly but out of
[38:52] his belly the one that believes on him
[38:55] shall flow rivers of Living Water amen
[38:58] we ask the Lord this evening to add the
[39:00] blessing to the reading of his word as
[39:01] you can have your seats here this
[39:03] afternoon I want to by the help of the
[39:05] Lord for just a few moments tonight in
[39:07] The Opening Service here I want to speak
[39:09] to you on a thought if the Lord would
[39:11] help us and I want to title this tonight
[39:13] unclogging the channels of our heart
[39:17] unclogging the channels of our heart you
[39:19] know I know we're all very well aware
[39:21] tonight that this is the opening night
[39:23] of the meeting and I think it's a good
[39:25] night to open up all the channels amen
[39:28] of our heart that the Lord could come
[39:29] into there and do something special for
[39:32] us brother BR said in the message
[39:33] getting in the spirit he said we got the
[39:35] people he said now just clean out the
[39:37] channel see the people's all right he
[39:39] said but get the channels cleaned out so
[39:41] that the Holy Spirit can come in he said
[39:44] all your fanaticisms and isms and
[39:46] everything else that's in the church
[39:48] amen we just need to clean the thing out
[39:50] how many how many believes we got the
[39:51] people here tonight we just need the
[39:53] spirit of God Amen to clean out the
[39:55] channels of our our heart in the message
[39:57] the lamb and the dove another place you
[39:59] said every person is a spirit every one
[40:01] of you has got a soul and when you go to
[40:03] believe and it's in that channel of
[40:05] Faith do you believe that certainly and
[40:07] if you can get with one Accord he said
[40:09] then that's when the Holy Spirit will
[40:11] just move in amen if you can just get in
[40:14] one Accord then that is when the Holy
[40:16] Spirit will just move in now another
[40:18] place just laying a foundation he said I
[40:20] seen not long ago where they went into
[40:22] the Garners of Egypt and got some wheat
[40:24] that was put in there about 2500 years
[40:26] ago ago yes more than that about 3,000
[40:28] years ago but in there by Joseph it was
[40:30] put in there by Joseph and some of the
[40:32] weed had been laying there for all those
[40:34] years and planted in the ground and it
[40:35] produced again now no matter how long
[40:38] this gospel lays here 2,000 years we've
[40:41] had mockers and scoffers saying the days
[40:43] of Miracles is passed amen put that word
[40:46] in the right kind of a heart and it'll
[40:48] produce again exactly what it did in the
[40:51] first time because it's the word of God
[40:53] see it's got to come into a Channel of
[40:56] faith and as long as it laid in the
[40:57] Garner then it didn't need nothing it
[41:00] just stayed there as a memorial so how
[41:02] many amen can agree with me tonight that
[41:04] the word amen is not good enough just to
[41:07] lay in the Bible it's not good enough
[41:08] just to lay in the tapes or to lay in
[41:10] the books amen amen but God has ordained
[41:13] this word to come off of the pages of
[41:15] the Bible to come out of the tapes and
[41:17] come off of the pages of the book amen
[41:19] and to fall into your heart because the
[41:21] prophet said amen every seed will
[41:23] produce of its own kind amen and if it
[41:26] falls in the right kind of ground amen
[41:28] it will produce the right kind of
[41:30] harvest I believe tonight that there's
[41:31] seeds amen that's laying in the word of
[41:34] God for healing here this weekend I
[41:36] believe there's seeds in the word of God
[41:38] for deliverance and miracles and signs
[41:40] and wonders amen but we've got to clean
[41:42] out our heart Amen in order to make room
[41:44] for the word to come in there now you
[41:47] all know that there's there's four
[41:48] seasons to a year there's a spring
[41:50] there's a summer there's a fall and
[41:52] there's a winter we're actually just now
[41:54] amen beginning the first stages or the
[41:56] first days amen of what we call fall and
[41:59] when we think of spring amen we think of
[42:01] a spring cleaning so amen maybe I could
[42:03] say it like this tonight we're going to
[42:05] have a spring cleaning on the first day
[42:06] of fall we're going to have a spring
[42:08] cleaning Amen in this meeting tonight
[42:11] when you when you have a spring cleaning
[42:12] what you begin to do is you begin to
[42:14] clean out the closet you begin to clean
[42:16] out the garage you you begin to go
[42:18] through the house and look for things
[42:19] that's laying there that's taking up
[42:21] space or amen you're looking to remove
[42:23] something to put something else there
[42:25] amen will be more beneficial to you than
[42:28] what is there and you know I believe
[42:29] amen that there's a lot of things amen
[42:31] that the devil can put in our heart I
[42:33] believe he can put complexes I believe
[42:35] he can put fears and doubts and
[42:37] confusions amen and questions but I
[42:39] believe that God is sent a message in
[42:41] this generation amen and it's a message
[42:43] of dynamic power it's a message of holy
[42:46] ghost power amen and I think it's time
[42:48] to remove the complexes and make room
[42:51] for the power of the Holy Ghost I think
[42:52] it's time Amen to remove the doubts and
[42:55] the Superstition
[42:56] and the skepticisms and the unbelief
[42:59] amen and let the power of the Holy Ghost
[43:01] come in our heart amen I love what David
[43:03] said he said who can understand his HS
[43:06] he said cleanse thou me from Secret
[43:08] faults Amen in Psalm 51:2 he said Wash
[43:11] Me thoroughly from my iniquity amen and
[43:14] clean me from my sin in verse five he
[43:16] said behold I was shapen in iniquity and
[43:19] in sin did my mother conceive me amen
[43:21] but in verse seven he said Purge me with
[43:23] hisp and I shall be clean amen wash me
[43:26] and I shall be whiter than snow amen
[43:29] David goes in Psalm 79:9 and says help
[43:32] us oh god of our Salvation amen for the
[43:35] glory of thy name and Deliver Us amen
[43:38] and Purge away our sins for thy name's
[43:40] sake amen David was praying that God
[43:43] Amen would send the hsip amen to purge
[43:46] away his sins amen for his name's sake
[43:49] how many would agree that we all need a
[43:51] purge and amen I don't know if you how
[43:53] long you've been serving God maybe 5
[43:54] years or 20 years or or 10 years but
[43:57] every single one of us tonight amen need
[44:00] a purging of the Holy Ghost Amen to wash
[44:03] our mind to wash our spirits and the
[44:05] prophet of God said I do believe in a
[44:07] Purgatory he said but I believe it's
[44:09] right now he said you purge your own
[44:11] soul what does purgatory mean it means
[44:14] to purge when you see you've done
[44:16] something wrong amen then get out there
[44:18] and clean it out of You by confession
[44:20] and crying and fasting and praying
[44:22] someone even laughed at me when the Lord
[44:24] came here not long ago and give me
[44:26] Vision always wanted to see about
[44:28] binding that serpent always wondered how
[44:30] to he said I should step out like that
[44:32] when that's what I've wanted all my life
[44:34] then I be to fast and pray and said what
[44:36] must you do for that and I said in there
[44:38] he said I was not sincere enough after
[44:41] he come then I wanted to purge myself
[44:45] amen there's a lot of devils that need
[44:46] to be bound this weekend there's a lot
[44:48] of spirits that need to be bound there's
[44:50] a lot of demons that need to be sent
[44:52] back to the hell that they come out of
[44:54] Amen but I tell you what's not going to
[44:55] do do it is her feelings is not going to
[44:57] do it and emotions is not going to do it
[45:00] and Sensations is not going to do it
[45:02] amen but the word coming in power amen
[45:05] will put a faith in your heart Amen to
[45:07] bind that devil and put him in his place
[45:09] as a son and daughter of God listen I
[45:12] don't believe you got to leave here with
[45:13] the demons you came with I don't believe
[45:15] you got to go back with that Old Demon
[45:17] of fear that Old Demon of doubt and turn
[45:20] torment amen I believe there's a God in
[45:22] the building tonight amen that can take
[45:24] the thing that's binding you and canine
[45:27] that devil and put that devil in his
[45:28] place and release you from the
[45:30] condemnation release you from the guilt
[45:33] amen a prophet had to become more
[45:35] sincere to bind the devil then you best
[45:37] believe we have to become more sincere
[45:39] he said after he come he said then I
[45:41] wanted to purge myself amen not wait
[45:44] till you die and let some priest try to
[45:45] purge you he said Purge your souls amen
[45:48] but see they took it out of the
[45:50] authoritative word and they put it over
[45:52] in the hands of some man-made Dogma he
[45:54] said to bring money into the church
[45:56] because they look at worldly things
[45:57] worldly Church Great powers in the world
[45:59] political Powers amen but God looks to
[46:02] his word and any word that's contrary to
[46:05] God's word is wrong amen as far as I'm
[46:07] concerned amen it's the word or nothing
[46:11] amen can we start this meeting off on
[46:13] that declaration amen as far as I'm
[46:15] concerned it's the word or it's nothing
[46:18] it's not the way I feel it's not the way
[46:20] I think it's not the way things have
[46:22] been amen it's the word or it's nothing
[46:25] amen and I believe that the word of God
[46:27] will defeat the Devil anywhere any time
[46:29] any place under any condition amen and
[46:32] that word is here tonight to defeat the
[46:34] Devil amen that's trying to defeat the
[46:36] church amen I believe as the prophet
[46:38] preached several times he preached a
[46:40] message on doors amen he would call it
[46:42] doors and doors and what he would say is
[46:45] there are many doors in the heart of the
[46:47] human being amen now you know why
[46:49] someone knocks on a door amen is because
[46:51] they're trying Amen to gain access to
[46:54] what's behind that door brother BR said
[46:56] there's the door of Pride he said
[46:58] there's the door of the private life he
[47:00] said there's the Door of Faith amen see
[47:03] there's all kinds of doors Amen in the
[47:06] door of the heart amen so there's one
[47:08] door to the heart but then there's doors
[47:12] indoors right amen there's one door to
[47:14] the heart but then there's doors and
[47:16] doors now you know what in proverbs 4
[47:18] that that Solomon instructs us amen I I
[47:21] lost it in my ear if you could give it
[47:22] back to me I'd appreciate it amen
[47:24] Solomon instructs us Amen to keep my
[47:26] heart with all diligence brother said
[47:28] listen my Christian friend if there's an
[47:30] ALT in your heart against anyone you go
[47:33] to them now and be reconciled and forget
[47:36] all the past he said if you've been
[47:38] having an up and down life remember
[47:40] something amen has come into that heart
[47:42] something is moved into those thoughts
[47:44] no matter who your enemy is love him
[47:46] amen no matter what's happened let it go
[47:49] after all amen you're in a field with
[47:51] weeds and we realize amen that we must
[47:53] both grow together we've got to come up
[47:55] up together amen but a good whale cannot
[47:58] put forth amen evil Waters and neither
[48:01] can an evil whale amen put forth good
[48:03] Waters amen and a tree cannot bring
[48:05] forth corrupt fruit amen and a good
[48:08] fruit cannot come from a corrupt tree he
[48:10] said so let's either make the whole well
[48:12] clean or let's make the whole well dirty
[48:15] amen one or the other for it's dirty to
[48:17] begin with amen so let's clean out for
[48:20] whales this morning and say Lord pour
[48:22] your spirit in me amen and Lead Me and
[48:25] guide me amen is there a David among us
[48:27] tonight that says Lord pour your spirit
[48:30] out amen wash the whales of my heart
[48:32] wash the whes of my spirit amen pour
[48:35] your spirit out Lord amen if it's
[48:37] correction I'll take it amen if it's
[48:39] rejoicing I'll take it amen but as long
[48:41] as it's coming from the word I will
[48:44] receive what the spirit is s in this age
[48:47] Amen to correct my heart so that I can
[48:49] be a tree that'll bring forth good fruit
[48:52] as the father has commanded me to do
[48:54] amen I don't know about you I don't want
[48:56] to be a Halfway Christian amen I don't
[48:58] want to drink from a hybrid whale you
[49:00] say brother Andrew what is a hybrid
[49:02] whale well a hybrid whale amen is
[49:04] something amen thank you brother it's
[49:06] something that is mixed amen with clean
[49:09] and dirty water do you realize that we
[49:11] are not drinking from a hybrid whale
[49:13] amen we are drinking from an artisian
[49:16] whale we are drinking from a whale amen
[49:19] that's not mixed with man's ideas it's
[49:21] not mixed with denomination it's not
[49:23] mixed with psychology it's not mixed
[49:25] with education amen but the whale that
[49:27] we are drinking of Amen it's got the
[49:30] power of the Holy Ghost in it it's got
[49:32] the power to open the blind eyes it's
[49:34] got the power to raise the dead it's got
[49:37] the power to bind the devil amen that's
[49:39] why we can have a confidence tonight
[49:41] that we can leave here clean because the
[49:44] whale we're drawing from is a clean wh
[49:47] in the Book of James the Bible said amen
[49:49] out of the same mouth proceedeth
[49:50] blessing and cursing he said my brethren
[49:53] these things amen ought not to be so
[49:55] amen do a fountain send forth at the
[49:58] same place Sweet Water and bitter amen
[50:00] can the Fig Tree my brethren bear Olive
[50:02] berries either a Vine or fig amen so can
[50:05] no Fountain amen both yield salt water
[50:08] and fresh amen I don't know about you
[50:10] but I don't want to serve God Amen with
[50:12] a perverse lip amen I don't want to
[50:15] serve God on my good days I speak good
[50:17] things and on my bad days I speak bad
[50:20] things and when I'm on the mountain I
[50:21] confess the word and when I'm in the
[50:23] valley I question the word am but I
[50:25] believe God has sent us a message Amen
[50:28] to bring us to a place of stability
[50:30] where we can walk every day of our life
[50:32] with an absolute assurance that when I'm
[50:34] on the mountain I'm a Son of God when
[50:37] I'm in the Valley I'm a Son of God on my
[50:39] good days I'm a Son of God on my bad
[50:41] days I'm a Son of God when things are
[50:43] going good I'm a Son of God when things
[50:46] are falling apart I'm a Son of God
[50:48] listen the temporary conditions amen
[50:50] does not change your Eternal position
[50:53] that God gave you from before the found
[50:55] foundation of the world if you ever was
[50:57] a Son of God you always was a Son of God

[51:02] Book of Life you always had a name on
[51:05] the Lamb's Book of Life and the reason
[51:07] why God would send a message in this
[51:09] generation is to purge your conscience
[51:12] is to purge your hearts Amen to believe
[51:14] that if God saved me he didn't save me
[51:16] temporarily he saved me for Time and
[51:19] Eternity if God give me the Holy Ghost
[51:22] he didn't give me the Holy Ghost to lose
[51:23] me he give me the holy goes to keep me

[52:24] result amen of a life that serves God

[52:29] something in you that'll move you from
[52:31] that halfway desire into a full
[52:33] surrender to God I can prove that to you
[52:36] by Jehoshaphat the Bible said that
[52:38] Jehoshaphat witnessed amen the results
[52:41] of a life amen that served God and a
[52:44] life that did not serve God and you know
[52:46] who that life was that was jehoshaphat's
[52:48] father the prophet said but Jehoshaphat
[52:51] amen had purposed in his heart Amen to
[52:54] serve the Lord and to cling to the
[52:56] things that his father David did at the
[52:58] beginning brother says I like that at
[53:00] the beginning the Bible said in other
[53:02] words he went back to the old land mark
[53:04] and they can clean out the rose he said
[53:06] it would be good for Pentecost to go
[53:08] back to the old land mark it would be
[53:10] good for all of us to go back to the old
[53:12] landmark and clean out the rose I'm
[53:14] talking to you he said mostly
[53:16] Pentecostal people what would happen if
[53:18] the church actually went back to the old
[53:20] Landmark he said you talk about it
[53:22] cleaning up there'd really be one around
[53:24] the p Pentecostal Church how many knows
[53:26] that's the truth amen oh how people
[53:28] would be acting different they would be
[53:30] dressing different they would be talking
[53:32] different it just all together be a
[53:35] different church if we went back to the
[53:37] old Landmark amen where we started from
[53:40] and don't get mad at me but I'm going to
[53:41] preach to you what I believe amen the
[53:43] landmark of this church is the message
[53:45] of the hour it's the message or it's
[53:48] nothing it's what a prophet t or it's
[53:50] nothing amen if you're trying to line
[53:52] your life up amen by some layout of sin
[53:55] influence amen you're lining your life
[53:57] up with a wrong influence but if you'll
[53:59] come back to the old landmark and line
[54:02] your life up with the message of the
[54:03] hour it will Quicken something in you
[54:06] amen that you'll change the way you talk
[54:08] you'll change the way you dress you'll
[54:10] change come on now y'all know I'm
[54:12] preaching to you amen it used to be
[54:14] wrong to wear certain things amen but
[54:16] now we're wearing them it used
[54:19] to it used to be wrong to go certain
[54:21] places amen but now we're going there it
[54:24] used to be wrong to listen L to certain
[54:25] things amen but now we're listening to
[54:27] him you know why because some devil has
[54:30] invaded the heart of somebody to believe
[54:33] amen that Holiness don't matter no more
[54:35] and clean living don't matter no more
[54:37] amen but that is a devil that is crawled
[54:39] up out of the pits of hell and I think
[54:41] somebody ought to put their foot on that
[54:43] devil and remember that we have been
[54:45] called to be Sanctified set aside clean
[54:49] living people that it canw from the wh
[54:52] of water in the age we're living in
[54:55] come on church I tell you what happened
[54:58] well I might as well preach I'm here
[55:00] amen we used to could shout amen but now
[55:02] we got to check our clothes before we do
[55:04] cuz things have creeped in we should
[55:05] have never been
[55:07] wearing come on church amen but I
[55:10] believe the first night's a good night
[55:11] to clean out the closet it's a good
[55:13] night to clean out the come on church
[55:16] it's a good night to clean out the music
[55:18] it's a good night to clean out the
[55:19] videos it's a good night
[55:22] to I'm not going to back up on that
[55:24] devil we didn't come here for a halfway
[55:27] youth camp we didn't come here just to
[55:29] sit around and see who could out sing
[55:31] who and who could out preach who we came
[55:34] here that the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost
[55:37] would fall in this building and would
[55:39] change our hearts and the only way it's
[55:41] going to happen is if we go back to the
[55:43] old
[55:45] Landmark I know it's not popular but
[55:48] it's still the message it's still the
[55:50] message this message will change the way
[55:52] you dress it'll change the way you act
[55:56] it'll change the way you conduct
[55:58] yourself it'll change the way you
[56:00] worship it'll change the way you treat
[56:02] one another it'll change the way you
[56:04] look at your church it'll change the way
[56:06] you look at your pastor it'll change the
[56:08] way you read the message if you'll just
[56:10] go back to the old landmark and believe
[56:12] that there's a dynamic power that can
[56:14] cleanse you from the Devils that have
[56:16] crept into our lives there is a
[56:18] possibility Samson for a
[56:21] Revival it'll make you act different
[56:24] it'll make you dress different it'll
[56:26] make you talk different it'll all
[56:28] together be a different church if we
[56:30] went back to the old Landmark where we
[56:32] started from if we went back to where we
[56:34] didn't care to say what a prophet said
[56:37] if we went back to where we didn't care
[56:39] Amen to believe what a prophet T I would
[56:42] to God we'd get a generation that would
[56:44] lose all fear of believing what a
[56:46] prophet told if a prophet said it it
[56:48] don't matter what devil tries to prove
[56:50] it wrong a prophet said it and there's a
[56:53] faith in my heart to believe what he
[56:55] said and there's a strength in my body
[56:57] to say what he said because I know this
[57:00] message will whip the devil anywhere
[57:03] anytime listen I just feel like
[57:04] preaching I've seen this message with
[57:06] the devil in India I've seen this
[57:08] message with the devil in Africa I've
[57:10] seen this message with the devil in
[57:11] Europe and Canada and all across the
[57:14] United States and I believe the same
[57:16] message is going to whip the devil right
[57:18] here in South Carolina this weekend and
[57:21] lives are going to be washed and hearts
[57:23] are going to be cleaned
[57:28] I tell you why the devil don't want you
[57:30] to get a washing is he wants you to
[57:31] believe you're just an insignificant
[57:33] young person and you're the Church of
[57:35] tomorrow but I come to put that devil in
[57:37] his place you're not the Church of
[57:39] tomorrow you're the Church of right now
[57:41] because we might not
[57:43] have we might not have a tomorrow but we
[57:46] got a right now and you're a part of
[57:49] this church you're a part of this
[57:51] message now when you start thinking
[57:52] about the channels you know there's
[57:54] there are many channels Amen in the body
[57:56] of Christ and the prophet of God said
[57:58] that God wants to flow through I looked
[58:00] up the definition brother joshu of a
[58:02] channel a channel is a prepared route
[58:06] amen for something to pass through into
[58:09] something else so when a channel it's a
[58:11] prepared route in other words you didn't
[58:14] come here and get prepared but you came
[58:16] to this age as pre-prepared ground so
[58:19] you came in this age by a seed in your
[58:22] heart prepared to re receive the
[58:25] outpouring of the Holy Ghost in the age
[58:27] who was living but if you're a channel
[58:30] brother Jesse you were not just prepared
[58:32] for something to be poured into you but
[58:35] whatever was poured into you amen would
[58:37] be poured into somebody else through
[58:39] that channel amen because God works
[58:42] through channels so if God can stop your
[58:44] channel he can stop somebody else's
[58:46] Channel you want me prove it to you the
[58:48] prophet of God said amen that a woman
[58:50] come in the prayer line one time amen
[58:52] and brought her baby there and said you
[58:54] been waiting for your baby to be healed
[58:56] and your baby's been healed the whole
[58:58] time you was waiting she said really he
[59:00] said yeah when the woman up there that
[59:02] mother prayed for your baby God Amen
[59:05] healed your baby now what if that
[59:07] woman's heart would have been full of a
[59:09] bunch of fear and skepticism and doubt
[59:12] and God wanted to pour a healing through
[59:14] her channel into that baby there would
[59:16] have been a kink in the host but because
[59:19] her channels of her heart had been
[59:21] unclogged she could receive the
[59:23] outpouring of the power of healing and
[59:25] could lay her hands on that baby and the
[59:28] baby could be healed listen young people
[59:30] amen there's more to this Camp than a
[59:32] bunch of preachers and singers there's a
[59:34] more to this camp and a bunch of
[59:35] counselors amen you got a part in this
[59:38] Camp God wants to use your hands he
[59:40] wants to use your eyes he wants to use
[59:42] your feet he wants to use your mouth he
[59:45] wants to use your body Amen to confess
[59:48] the word of God I say oh God open up the
[59:50] windows of heaven and pour out the fire
[59:53] of the Holy Ghost I don't want to waste
[59:55] one second of this Camp I want to be
[59:57] used for your honor and Glory I want to
[1:00:00] be a channel in the bethl camp that God
[1:00:03] can move through into somebody else amen
[1:00:06] I tell you what God does amen God
[1:00:08] prepares the channel and the devil does
[1:00:10] everything he can Amen to clog that
[1:00:12] channel you know what channels become
[1:00:14] clogged up it means it becomes blocked
[1:00:17] so that little or nothing can pass
[1:00:19] through you know what you got to do to
[1:00:21] unclog something you got to remove the
[1:00:23] accumulated matter from
[1:00:25] it if you're going to unog it you got to
[1:00:29] remove the accumulated matter from it
[1:00:32] listen I I don't mean to get too far out
[1:00:34] here but God don't do bypasses amen God
[1:00:37] does not leave the matter in the heart
[1:00:39] and do a bypass amen but God is a
[1:00:42] Creator and God goes right to the
[1:00:44] original artery and God clears out that
[1:00:46] artery and God makes a way amen for the
[1:00:49] blood to flow through that artery again
[1:00:51] I believe another word for unclogging is
[1:00:53] Revival and you know what the prophet
[1:00:55] said the Revival was he said is to wash
[1:00:57] out all the trash and unbelief amen and
[1:01:01] let the people come out and see that God
[1:01:04] is still God how many says I want to see
[1:01:06] him tonight I want to see him in the
[1:01:08] morning I want to see him tomorrow night
[1:01:11] I want to see every second of this Camp
[1:01:13] I want to see that God is still God and
[1:01:16] His word is still true amen I believe
[1:01:18] the Bible says I am the Lord and I
[1:01:21] change not then if he does not change
[1:01:23] that means if will clean out the
[1:01:25] channels of our hearts we can see him
[1:01:28] now can I just say this to you amen if
[1:01:30] you're waiting on the channel of God to
[1:01:31] get open it's already
[1:01:34] open well brother Andrew I'm praying and
[1:01:36] waiting for God's Channel listen God's
[1:01:38] channel is not
[1:01:39] clogged come on God's channel is not
[1:01:42] clogged the prophet said I believe amen
[1:01:45] that the right mental attitude towards
[1:01:46] any Divine promise of God will bring it
[1:01:48] to pass if you can look at it in the
[1:01:51] right way he said remember here's my
[1:01:53] standard in life the first first thing I
[1:01:54] want to find out whether it's the will
[1:01:56] of God or not then I know it's God's
[1:01:58] will the next thing is my objective and
[1:02:00] my motive in doing it then it's the will
[1:02:02] of God my objective is right my motive
[1:02:04] is right then I can have the faith it'll
[1:02:06] be done because first it's the will of
[1:02:08] God and my objective is to glorify him
[1:02:11] and my motive is to give him all the
[1:02:13] glory so there's no selfish motives
[1:02:15] about it if you have a selfish motive it
[1:02:18] will not work but if your objective is
[1:02:20] to he says to make money for yourself or
[1:02:22] something you'll never succeed he said
[1:02:25] anything outside the will of the Lord it
[1:02:26] will not work so there is a genuine
[1:02:29] Faith amen but you must come into the
[1:02:31] channel of God to have the genuine Faith
[1:02:34] he said there's human faith and there's
[1:02:36] the faith of God and you must have a
[1:02:38] Godly Faith to believe now to have a
[1:02:40] Godly Faith you must have the mind of
[1:02:42] Christ in you then that's how God
[1:02:44] projects to you Visions Revelations and
[1:02:47] all these things amen they come by the
[1:02:49] mind of Christ amen being in you amen
[1:02:52] are you hearing me then the Bible said
[1:02:54] let this mind that was in Christ Jesus
[1:02:58] be also in you do you know we will never
[1:03:01] find the channel of God without the mind
[1:03:03] of God but Paul said these beautiful
[1:03:05] words he said we have the mind of Christ
[1:03:09] Church we're not looking for it we're
[1:03:11] not waiting for it we're not praying for
[1:03:13] it we have the mind of Christ here is
[1:03:16] the secret the word is in the bride as
[1:03:19] it was in Mary and the bride has the
[1:03:22] mind of Christ for she knows what he
[1:03:24] want done with his word amen and she
[1:03:26] performs amen the command of the word of
[1:03:28] the Lord in Genesis chapter 4 we can
[1:03:31] find a man named Cain and a man named
[1:03:34] Abel trying to find the channel of God
[1:03:37] brother said by faith Abel offered unto
[1:03:39] God a more excellent sacrifice in Cain
[1:03:41] he said now watch Cain was just as
[1:03:44] religious as Abel was he said they both
[1:03:46] build altars they both love God they
[1:03:49] both made sacrifices they both paid
[1:03:51] their tithe they both worshiped they
[1:03:53] both done everything like amen but Able
[1:03:55] by faith which is the Revelation the
[1:03:58] word of God revealed made plain showed
[1:04:00] out and Vindicated wo that's a mouthful
[1:04:03] the word of God made plain revealed
[1:04:05] showed out and Vindicated he said and
[1:04:07] the true Channel amen now watch God
[1:04:10] interprets his own word by its terms he
[1:04:12] spoke it in now watch Cain said I'm
[1:04:14] religious I'm a lover of the maker I
[1:04:16] love this fine altar I love the
[1:04:18] sacrifice Lord I just love you and Abel
[1:04:21] said the same thing amen but now it's
[1:04:23] the one that's vend ated and the one
[1:04:25] that's proven now watch this and God
[1:04:27] come down and received Abel's sacrifice
[1:04:31] because by Revelation he had struck the
[1:04:34] true channel of God Amen that was
[1:04:36] accepted so Cain was trying to work his
[1:04:39] way in that channel amen but Abel by
[1:04:41] Faith by Revelation by the word made
[1:04:44] plain Vindicated he accepted the
[1:04:46] Revelation that had been sent to him and
[1:04:49] by accepting the Revelation he unlocked
[1:04:52] the channel of Praise or unlocked the T
[1:04:54] of forgiveness amen and it was not
[1:04:56] through the melons and the pumpkins and
[1:04:58] the apples or whatever was there amen it
[1:05:00] was through the blood now come on church
[1:05:02] amen do you realize there's 900
[1:05:04] denominations and they're working
[1:05:06] themselves to death amen trying to
[1:05:08] unlock the power to forgive sin trying
[1:05:10] to unlock the power to keep a Revival in
[1:05:12] the church trying to unlock the power to
[1:05:15] get young people to show up more than
[1:05:17] just at a special event amen but here
[1:05:19] you sit tonight and we're not trying to
[1:05:21] work it up we're not trying to buy it up
[1:05:24] amen but God is in a message in this
[1:05:26] hour and I'll say this with everything
[1:05:28] within Me by the message of the hour
[1:05:30] amen we have reopened the channel of
[1:05:33] Revelation to the church that had been
[1:05:35] clogged up by Theology and man-made
[1:05:37] theories that channel has been open
[1:05:40] brother Larry there's a revelation and
[1:05:42] it's flowing in the house of God and if
[1:05:45] Revelation ever drops in the channel of
[1:05:47] the heart of the believer the devil is
[1:05:49] finished the day of sin is over oh God
[1:05:53] hallelujah I'm I know it's a first night
[1:05:54] but it ain't the first meeting we've
[1:05:56] ever been in amen the channel is open
[1:05:58] tonight the Revelation is Flowing you
[1:06:00] ain't got to wait till Saturday night
[1:06:02] you ain't got to wait till Sunday
[1:06:03] morning you ain't got to wait till
[1:06:05] tomorrow night amen but right here right
[1:06:07] now this message has unlocked a flow of
[1:06:10] Revelation in this meeting and if you
[1:06:13] can let that Revelation drop into your
[1:06:17] heart it's over it's over the devil is
[1:06:21] defeated sin is finished
[1:06:24] is that sister Ella God bless you Sister
[1:06:26] Ella it's good to see you amen God
[1:06:28] opened the channel amen of the prophetic
[1:06:30] gift in this generation amen by the
[1:06:33] Fulfillment and the interpretation of
[1:06:35] his word when he placed me in this
[1:06:37] channel of this prophetic gift amen
[1:06:39] whatever it might be I do not know but
[1:06:42] the Bible is open here before me I do
[1:06:44] not know just what to call it he said
[1:06:46] but it's a prophetic gift and when he
[1:06:48] places it upon me I try to glorify our
[1:06:51] heavenly father he said now watch
[1:06:53] whatever I can to help his people that's
[1:06:56] what I do then do you realize a prophet
[1:06:58] was standing with a prophetic gift to
[1:07:01] the bride of Christ who I believe you're
[1:07:03] a part of that had a pro is a prophetic
[1:07:06] class of people who has a prophetic womb
[1:07:09] to bring forth prophetic promises but if
[1:07:11] the channel of prophetic has been shut
[1:07:14] off then that Revelation cannot flow but
[1:07:17] if that channel is open and that
[1:07:19] Revelation begins to flow it can flow
[1:07:21] right into this building tonight and you
[1:07:23] can realize I'm not just a citizen I'm
[1:07:25] not just a young girl I'm not just a
[1:07:27] young boy I am a part of the Eternal
[1:07:30] purpose of almighty God and my name is
[1:07:33] in the Lamb's Book of Life listen devil
[1:07:36] if you was going to get me you should
[1:07:37] have got me when you
[1:07:39] could if the devil was going to get you
[1:07:41] he should have got you when he could
[1:07:43] Elijah if the devil was going to get you
[1:07:45] he should have got you when he could
[1:07:46] amen but the Devil Couldn't get you amen
[1:07:49] because there's a force over your life
[1:07:51] and the force that's over your life is
[1:07:53] the force of a prophecy and my Bible
[1:07:55] says that heavens and earth will pass
[1:07:57] away but the prophecy of the word amen

[1:08:51] Revival is a word Revival that's why why
[1:08:54] that the Revival Burns no matter where
[1:08:56] it's at because it's not built on a man
[1:08:59] it's not built on a church it's not
[1:09:01] built on a man's gift it's not built on
[1:09:03] a man's personality this revival has
[1:09:06] been built on thus sayith the Lord and
[1:09:08] you are a prophetic class of people who
[1:09:10] under their Messenger will be the final
[1:09:13] voice to the final Age come on Church
[1:09:16] Paul's not coming back brother brandom's
[1:09:18] not coming back but you're here and you
[1:09:21] got a voice and you got a heart and
[1:09:24] there's an anointing upon
[1:09:26] [Music]
[1:09:27] you well I might as well just say what
[1:09:30] Paul said he said we have obtained a
[1:09:32] more excellent Ministry by how much also
[1:09:35] he is the mediator of a better Covenant
[1:09:37] which was established upon on better
[1:09:40] promises he is the mediator of a better
[1:09:43] Covenant which Brother David is
[1:09:45] established upon better promises you
[1:09:47] know what the prophet said he said now
[1:09:49] Miriam and them looking back they saw
[1:09:51] that separation they saw their their
[1:09:54] enemies annihilated forever how long was
[1:09:56] they going to be safe from them these
[1:09:58] Egyptians that you see today you will
[1:10:01] see no more forever he said amen put
[1:10:03] them in the sea of forgetfulness and
[1:10:05] remember them no more that's the kind of
[1:10:08] God we have he does not go and dig it up
[1:10:10] again and hold it against you oh I'm in
[1:10:13] a Channel right now it's a Channel of
[1:10:16] condemnation amen some of you all right
[1:10:18] now your channel of faith is clogged
[1:10:20] with condemnation it's clogged with I've
[1:10:22] been I've done I've seen I've said amen
[1:10:25] but how many can believe that this is
[1:10:27] more than a sermon this is more than
[1:10:29] just a message amen but this is a
[1:10:31] prophetic word it's a part of a better
[1:10:34] Covenant that is established upon better
[1:10:36] promises and the prophet said then if
[1:10:38] you can believe that God does not hold
[1:10:40] it against you here's what God says I
[1:10:42] forgot about it some of y'all right now
[1:10:44] are reminding God of things he forgot
[1:10:47] about and while you're trying to remind
[1:10:49] God I feel like preaching right now
[1:10:51] while you're trying to remind God of
[1:10:53] what you done what you said what you
[1:10:55] thought what you looked at places you
[1:10:57] went God is looking at you and saying
[1:10:59] you could be saying amen you could be
[1:11:02] receiving Revelation you could be
[1:11:03] enjoying the anointing amen I don't know
[1:11:05] what you're talking about well come on
[1:11:08] Church brother Jesse if God forgot it
[1:11:10] then I think it's time we forget it if
[1:11:12] God put it in the sea of forgetfulness I
[1:11:15] think it's time we say God I Repent of
[1:11:17] the thing it's in the sea of
[1:11:19] forgetfulness Brother Joseph it's
[1:11:21] forgotten it's not against you it's not
[1:11:24] remembered but I'll tell you what my
[1:11:26] Bible says if God be for
[1:11:29] you if God be for you then who can be
[1:11:33] against you what sin can be against you
[1:11:36] what negative thing can be against you
[1:11:38] what Li from the pits of hell can be
[1:11:41] against you if God is for you then what
[1:11:45] devil can be against you he's in the sea
[1:11:47] of
[1:11:50] forgetfulness I just got to say what the
[1:11:52] prophet said he said said no wonder
[1:11:54] Mariam had a hot spell woo brother no
[1:11:57] wonder Mariam had a hot spell and she
[1:12:00] picked up a tambourine and began to
[1:12:01] dance and jump up down on the bank you
[1:12:03] know the Holy Spirit just look like it
[1:12:05] just catches from one to another like
[1:12:07] Adams in a relay it begin to jump from
[1:12:10] one to another they all got tambourines
[1:12:12] and just had a real Jubilee and old
[1:12:14] brother Moses got so happy that he held
[1:12:16] up his hands and he's sing in the spirit
[1:12:18] if that ain't a Holy Roller meetting I
[1:12:20] never seen
[1:12:22] one if that ain't a Holy Roller meat and
[1:12:24] I never seen one he said that's
[1:12:26] something new no it's nothing new it's
[1:12:29] just a new tapped with the old it's just
[1:12:32] a new that is tapped in to the old he
[1:12:35] said there they was singing in the
[1:12:36] spirit amen dancing in the spirit
[1:12:38] beating all the music clapping their
[1:12:40] hands what a time they was having now
[1:12:42] listen to The Prophet why they was
[1:12:44] annihilated from their enemy but listen
[1:12:47] he still does the same thing well Glory
[1:12:51] what he did for Miriam he still does
[1:12:53] today under a better Covenant way better
[1:12:56] than the old Covenant brother Thomas if
[1:12:59] David rather Moses and Miriam could
[1:13:02] dance at the fact they're devils and
[1:13:04] their enemies were dead come on church
[1:13:06] amen I tell you what I believe they were
[1:13:08] dancing for I don't believe they was
[1:13:09] dancing because the tambourine I don't
[1:13:11] believe they were dancing amen because
[1:13:13] of the music I believe they were dancing
[1:13:15] because they was a part of a prophetic
[1:13:17] class of people and they received the
[1:13:19] Revelation in their hearts that that
[1:13:22] Taskmaster you see you'll see no more
[1:13:25] that devil that's taught you will fight
[1:13:26] you no more listen church that was under
[1:13:29] the bud of bulls and goats but you're
[1:13:31] not under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:13:34] where your sin is just covered you're
[1:13:36] under the blood of Jesus Christ where
[1:13:38] your sin is divorc it's in the sea of
[1:13:41] forgetfulness if anybody got a righteous
[1:13:43] shout the Bride of Jesus Christ has got
[1:13:45] to right if anybody got a right to
[1:13:48] Rejoice that our sins are over our
[1:13:50] iniquities he will remember no more and
[1:13:53] they are under the blood oh I just got
[1:13:56] to say what he said he forgiveth all
[1:13:58] thine iniquities and health all thy
[1:14:02] diseases you know what he said in the
[1:14:04] Old Testament they had one prescription
[1:14:06] under the old Covenant I am the Lord
[1:14:08] that Health all by diseases he said but
[1:14:10] we have six have some 600 or more better
[1:14:15] promises on Divine
[1:14:18] Healing brother Matt they got happy on
[1:14:21] one and we got
[1:14:23] 600 or more better

[1:14:40] wouldn't have none at all listen friends

[1:14:48] enjoying the word of God I think we
[1:14:50] ought to get back to a place where we
[1:14:51] don't let quotes become C we don't let
[1:14:54] things just become another service or
[1:14:56] another Camp I think we ought to get
[1:14:58] back to a place we realize who we are in
[1:15:00] the word of God and we're not here under
[1:15:02] the old Covenant we're here under the
[1:15:04] new brother said if they did that under
[1:15:06] that Covenant how much greater is the
[1:15:09] Covenant today he said you know what I
[1:15:10] begin to Believe Christian friend that
[1:15:12] we're just living in the beginning of

[1:16:55] said I just believe all the lines are
[1:16:56] getting unclogged you know they've been
[1:16:58] clogged up with all kinds of doctrines
[1:17:00] and theologies and all kinds of stuff
[1:17:02] and unbelief now now if I can have some
[1:17:04] Liberty here I'm going to labor for a
[1:17:06] second he said that's been handed down
[1:17:09] from generation to
[1:17:11] generation so actually you have got
[1:17:14] clogged up clogged up channels that
[1:17:17] actually was clogged up because
[1:17:20] something was passed down to you was
[1:17:23] passed down to you from another
[1:17:26] generation so from one generation it
[1:17:29] come into another generation and because
[1:17:31] that generation didn't deal with it it
[1:17:33] come over in the next generation and
[1:17:35] because come on church and because that
[1:17:37] generation are you hearing me amen
[1:17:40] things have been piled up now I just
[1:17:42] might as well preach since I'm here amen
[1:17:44] I tell you what happens amen things
[1:17:46] don't get buried and they get passed
[1:17:49] they don't get buried and they get
[1:17:50] passed like one time I I probably
[1:17:53] probably told this before but I'm going
[1:17:54] to say it again I was at a church one
[1:17:55] time two young men standing there
[1:17:57] talking to me brother Jason they were
[1:17:59] telling me about a fight in the church
[1:18:01] that happened I well they told me about
[1:18:02] it like they was a part of it and when
[1:18:04] they got done I said when did that
[1:18:06] happen brother looked at me brother
[1:18:08] looked at me he said oh I think that was
[1:18:09] about 25 years ago when that happened to
[1:18:11] my
[1:18:14] grandfather well I'm here I might as
[1:18:16] well plow through it I said 25 years ago
[1:18:20] something happened and 25 years later
[1:18:23] ler that thing is still living in the
[1:18:25] Next Generation when it should have
[1:18:27] never left that generation somebody
[1:18:29] should have found an altar somewhere and
[1:18:31] confessed that thing and killed
[1:18:34] it come on church I think it's time to
[1:18:37] put some devils in the grave I think
[1:18:39] it's time to bury some ill feelings I
[1:18:42] think it's time to put some devils in
[1:18:43] their place you are not the recipient of
[1:18:46] complexes and church problems and so and
[1:18:49] so Bel so and so and this happened amen
[1:18:52] come on church it's a new generation I
[1:18:54] think we ought to bury the hatchet I
[1:18:56] think we ought to bury the axe I think
[1:18:58] we ought to grow up and be young men and
[1:19:00] women and say that was a generation ago
[1:19:02] I will not be a carrier for what
[1:19:05] happened 20 years ago I tell you what we
[1:19:07] ought to be carrying we ought to be
[1:19:08] carrying testimonies we ought to be
[1:19:10] carrying victories we ought to let the
[1:19:13] past be the
[1:19:15] past now you all know I'm preaching let
[1:19:18] the past be the past and then you know
[1:19:20] what happens Amen brother Jordan
[1:19:22] something will happen 20 years ago and
[1:19:24] that'll come down and then that person
[1:19:26] who was not a part of it will begin to
[1:19:28] treat somebody wrong because they think
[1:19:31] they well I don't know I'm here are you
[1:19:34] hearing me and it just keeps passing
[1:19:36] down and passing down and passing down

[1:19:46] and so and so don't believe that and

[1:19:56] not in it we got a future and fear is
[1:19:59] not in it we got a future and division
[1:20:02] is not in it we got a future amen and
[1:20:04] complexes is not in it but I'll tell you

[1:20:09] the body Chang is in it and healing is
[1:20:11] in it and miracles is in it and victory
[1:20:14] is in it and power is in it and
[1:20:16] anointing is in it and holy ghost power

[1:20:55] marriage and make church more
[1:20:57] unimportant so instead of him not going

[1:22:14] nervous he said let one person get
[1:22:16] anxiety and the whole house gets it he

[1:24:33] Andrew you're getting out there am I
[1:24:35] really am I really the devil loves to
[1:24:37] clog up these channels he loves to clog
[1:24:40] now right now what he's trying to do is
[1:24:42] he's trying to clog up the channel of
[1:24:45] inspiration because inspiration is where
[1:24:48] things begin to
[1:24:50] change under inspiration is where things
[1:24:53] begin to change under the inspiration is
[1:24:56] where lies begin to be changed listen
[1:24:58] what the Bible said the Bible said there
[1:24:59] is a spirit in man and it's the
[1:25:01] inspiration of the almighty that giveth
[1:25:04] him the understanding do you see what's
[1:25:05] happening in your services is your
[1:25:07] pastors are not hooked up to your phones
[1:25:10] they're not tapped into your bedrooms
[1:25:11] they're not tapped into your schools
[1:25:13] amen they're working for the spirit of
[1:25:15] inspiration and there's a spirit trying
[1:25:17] to destroy you and so that man of God
[1:25:20] gets along somewhere with God and finds
[1:25:22] the mind of God and comes into the pull
[1:25:25] pit and then that Spirit begins to cry
[1:25:27] out I need help I need help they're
[1:25:29] getting ready to get free they're
[1:25:31] getting ready to get delivered you know
[1:25:32] what it is it's a devil trying to get
[1:25:34] reinforcement Amen to stop what God is
[1:25:37] pouring in the church but the prophet
[1:25:39] said this he said listen he said when
[1:25:41] you know you've done exactly what God
[1:25:43] told you to do see then wait for that
[1:25:45] channel of inspiration to open up to you
[1:25:48] and then you'll say now I'm Healed when
[1:25:50] it drops in there then it's all over he
[1:25:53] said now watch you don't need no prayer
[1:25:54] lines nothing else it's over see it's
[1:25:56] been revealed to you now watch this now
[1:25:58] when it's revealed to you that you
[1:26:00] yourself has received oh
[1:26:02] God has received God's promise the
[1:26:06] inspiration you being Christians it
[1:26:08] struck you he said you don't even need a
[1:26:10] prayer line now we all believe in prayer
[1:26:11] lines right but we believe in them but
[1:26:13] the prop said the only thing you need is
[1:26:15] an open heart when all the mechanics are
[1:26:18] ready then let the inspiration drop in
[1:26:21] then nothing can change your mind you've
[1:26:23] got it outside of that it would do no
[1:26:26] good when a man is INSP are you hearing
[1:26:28] me when the mechanics are in line and
[1:26:31] the inspiration begins to pour upon the
[1:26:33] mechanics which is the Dynamics begins
[1:26:35] to pour upon the mechanics there's
[1:26:37] nothing that devil can do to change your
[1:26:40] mind see that's why it's got to move
[1:26:42] Beyond flesh it's got to move Beyond
[1:26:44] spirit it's got to move Beyond when I
[1:26:46] went to camp and I got in the atmosphere
[1:26:48] and I really felt like I got a freedom
[1:26:50] amen listen that that freedom Freedom
[1:26:52] has got to go from your feet it's got to
[1:26:54] go from your hands it's got to go into
[1:26:56] your soul and when that Revelation drops
[1:27:00] oh my church when that Revelation drops
[1:27:02] in your soul there's nothing the devil
[1:27:05] can do to change your mind oh I'm
[1:27:08] preaching to you when the Revelation
[1:27:10] gets in your soul the devil can do
[1:27:13] nothing to change your mind y'all know
[1:27:15] I'm preaching to you cuz we've all been
[1:27:17] there we went to camp we got delivered
[1:27:19] we felt good we went home and the devil
[1:27:21] said you didn't get nothing the devil
[1:27:23] said you didn't feel nothing you went
[1:27:25] and saw your old friends and found
[1:27:26] yourself back in that shape do you know
[1:27:28] why that is is because the prophet said
[1:27:31] amen it just got on the outside it
[1:27:33] didn't get on the inside but if it gets
[1:27:36] on the inside come on if it gets on the
[1:27:38] inside then you can go back to all your
[1:27:40] old friends and they don't have enough
[1:27:42] mental power Amen to put you under a
[1:27:45] pressure Amen to go back to the things
[1:27:47] that you've been delivered
[1:27:50] from are you hearing me when it I think
[1:27:53] brother Paul of fontain wrote a song
[1:27:55] when it drops from your head into your
[1:27:56] heart when it drops from your head into
[1:27:59] your heart and becomes a
[1:28:02] revelation are you hearing me when it
[1:28:04] becomes a revelation then it's not an
[1:28:06] emotion I'm free it's not a feeling I'm
[1:28:09] free it's a revelation I'm free then you
[1:28:12] know what'll happen the emotion as much
[1:28:14] as we love it will leave you but the
[1:28:16] Revelation never will The Sensation will
[1:28:19] leave you Amen brother amen but the but
[1:28:21] the revelation will be there when you
[1:28:24] feel like everything's against
[1:28:26] you now I'll just say to you like this
[1:28:28] cuz I'm hurrying along here the probably
[1:28:30] God said in the Old Testament I I pray
[1:28:31] this okay he said in the Old Testament
[1:28:34] he said what happened was he said the
[1:28:35] war he said in war they had tactics he
[1:28:38] said what those tactics was was the
[1:28:40] enemy would come in and would stomp up
[1:28:42] the water channels now watch if the
[1:28:44] enemy could just cut off the water
[1:28:46] supply then the people would die in
[1:28:49] Genesis 26:17 the Bible says Isaac
[1:28:51] departed then and pitched his tent in
[1:28:53] the valley of gerer and dwelt there now
[1:28:55] watch this and Isaac digged again the
[1:28:57] wells of water somebody say
[1:28:59] water which they had digged in the days
[1:29:02] of Abraham his father so Isaac was not
[1:29:04] digging New
[1:29:07] Wales come on brother Jason Isaac was
[1:29:10] not digging new whales the whales were
[1:29:13] already dug but they had gotten clogged
[1:29:15] up somewhere but okay from one
[1:29:18] generation to the next somewhere from
[1:29:20] Abraham to Isaac the whales had gotten
[1:29:23] clogged up and they had to be redu and
[1:29:26] the Bible says the Philistines had
[1:29:28] stopped them amen after the death of
[1:29:30] Abraham and he called their names after
[1:29:32] by which their father had called them
[1:29:34] now watch Isaac's servants digged in the
[1:29:36] valley and found there a whale of
[1:29:38] springing water did you all catch that
[1:29:41] they found a whale of springing water
[1:29:43] and the Hersman of gerer did strive with
[1:29:45] Isaac's hergan saying the water is ours
[1:29:48] and he called the name of the Welly SEC
[1:29:50] with both they strove with him and they
[1:29:52] digged another well and strove for that
[1:29:54] also and he called the name of it sitna
[1:29:56] and he removed from fence and digged
[1:29:58] another wh and for that they strove not
[1:30:01] and he called the name of it reoboth and
[1:30:04] he said for now the Lord hath made room
[1:30:07] for us all and we shall be fruitful in
[1:30:10] the land brother said now I'm the public
[1:30:12] utility he said if you don't pay the
[1:30:14] bill they'll cut off the water you'll
[1:30:16] dry up around the house he said and
[1:30:17] that's what's the matter with God's
[1:30:19] people tonight they just didn't pay the
[1:30:21] price God cut their water off see go to
[1:30:24] any Desert you want to that's the reason
[1:30:26] some of you Full Gospel Church members
[1:30:28] and so forth amen don't believe in
[1:30:29] Divine Healing is because your water has
[1:30:32] been cut off that's right and when
[1:30:34] there's no water it gets stickers where
[1:30:36] there's water watch this where there's
[1:30:38] water that same plant will soften up
[1:30:42] amen and make Leaves amen that same
[1:30:45] plant will soften up and make leaves so
[1:30:47] they found out they was without water
[1:30:49] and when you're without water amen
[1:30:51] you're without life when you're without
[1:30:53] water you're without life are you
[1:30:55] hearing me when you're without water
[1:30:57] amen you're without life amen the prod
[1:30:59] God said here amen amen hurrying here he
[1:31:02] said now here many people say well if I
[1:31:04] only had faith and what you're saying is
[1:31:06] if I only had Faith to open up the
[1:31:07] channels he said but Faith does not mean
[1:31:10] long drawn out prayer
[1:31:12] meetings it doesn't mean long fast faith
[1:31:15] is unconscious you're real Faith you're
[1:31:17] unconscious of it you don't know you've
[1:31:19] got the faith yeah
[1:31:23] it's an unconscious matter within you he
[1:31:26] said could you imagine Jesus questioning
[1:31:28] whether he had Faith or not to stop the
[1:31:30] winds or steal the waves or have faith
[1:31:32] enough to raise Lazarus he never
[1:31:34] question his faith now listen we must
[1:31:36] allow the holy spirit amen to unclog the
[1:31:40] channel of Faith amen I'm just going to
[1:31:41] share this to you I was driving down the
[1:31:43] road early this morning just praying and
[1:31:45] the Lord just spoke these words to my
[1:31:47] heart and I'm just going to say it this
[1:31:49] this is just prayer the spirit of the
[1:31:50] Lord said we got to unclog the channel
[1:31:52] of faith and clog the channel of
[1:31:56] doubt we got to unclog the channel of
[1:31:59] faith and clog the channel of Doubt do
[1:32:02] you realize the matter that has
[1:32:04] accumulated in your channel of faith is
[1:32:07] what you need to accumulate in your
[1:32:09] channel of
[1:32:11] Doubt are you hearing me the questions
[1:32:13] about the message that have accumulated
[1:32:16] in your channel of Faith needs to be
[1:32:18] unclogged and accumulated in the channel
[1:32:21] of doubt I tell you why Satan loves to
[1:32:23] clog the channel amen he he loves to
[1:32:25] clog the channel of our purpose amen
[1:32:27] with our failures but according to
[1:32:29] Ephesians 311 the purpose of God is an
[1:32:31] eternal purpose and I say this the
[1:32:34] purpose of God is irresistible it is
[1:32:36] sure of fulfillment it is seen in his
[1:32:39] choice of instruments it is revealed in
[1:32:41] the gospel it is eternal in Christ and
[1:32:44] it involves the overthrow of
[1:32:46] Satan oh God Church Living God Amen the
[1:32:50] devil right here right now is trying to
[1:32:53] clog your channel of purpose well
[1:32:55] brother Andrew said to get rid of the
[1:32:56] generation and brother Andrew preached
[1:32:58] this but listen it's not for you because
[1:33:01] you don't have a purpose well you just
[1:33:02] sit there and watch me I'm going to go
[1:33:04] after that devil for a second every
[1:33:05] single one of you all have got a purpose
[1:33:08] come on church quit letting the devil
[1:33:10] tell you you're an accident you're a
[1:33:12] mistake you shouldn't be here you
[1:33:14] shouldn't be in this Camp amen why don't
[1:33:16] you goad and put that devil under your
[1:33:18] foot right now and say God has a purpose
[1:33:21] for my life he has a purpose for me
[1:33:24] being here he has a purpose come on he
[1:33:26] has a purpose in these meetings he has a
[1:33:28] purpose in this ministry he has a
[1:33:30] purpose in this Camp amen and the
[1:33:32] Eternal purpose of God will not be
[1:33:35] defeated but we will defeat the Devil
[1:33:38] who's trying to defeat the purpose of
[1:33:40] God we were created for the purpose to
[1:33:43] control and to rule and to praise God
[1:33:46] and to live for god listen church when
[1:33:48] God made you he made you with an eternal
[1:33:51] purpose brother said it like this he
[1:33:52] refers to Genesis 1 and he said man was
[1:33:55] made Superior to everything on the earth
[1:33:58] amen man was made a secondary amen God
[1:34:02] on the earth that was Adam now listen
[1:34:04] what a prophet said he said now what's
[1:34:05] in man he's yet a Son of God no matter
[1:34:08] oh my can I labor here for a second he's
[1:34:10] a Son of God no matter what state he's
[1:34:13] in no matter how sinful he is how far
[1:34:16] away he is he's a fallen son but yet
[1:34:18] he's a son and God is his creation t god
[1:34:22] is his maker God has bought him with a
[1:34:25] prize he may never reconcile himself to
[1:34:27] that he may never accept it it may never
[1:34:29] do him any good but yet he and she is a
[1:34:32] daughter of God he said then what did
[1:34:34] God put man here for I'm closing on
[1:34:36] these points what did God put man here
[1:34:39] for he said when God made man in the
[1:34:41] beginning he made him Superior to
[1:34:44] anything on the earth he gave him
[1:34:46] jurisdiction over everything on Earth to
[1:34:48] control everything he controlled the
[1:34:50] animal life life he controlled the foul
[1:34:52] life he controlled the fishes of the sea
[1:34:55] he controlled the winds the plant life
[1:34:57] he controlled everything he said but the
[1:34:59] free moral agency amen was the power by
[1:35:02] which man failed listen Church man was
[1:35:05] made as a secondary God on Earth he was
[1:35:08] given the power Amen to control all
[1:35:11] things all elements of the earth that
[1:35:13] was Adam and Adam was given these great
[1:35:15] Powers but then the power that he was
[1:35:17] given to make himself is where he failed
[1:35:19] can I say it to you like this I'm going
[1:35:21] to B something from brother Donnie
[1:35:22] Reagan he says our free moral agency has
[1:35:25] caused us more trouble than we ever
[1:35:28] realize Adam could speak to the winds
[1:35:31] and stop them he could speak to the
[1:35:33] trees and they would obey he could speak
[1:35:35] to Wildlife it would obey he could speak
[1:35:37] to the waters everything he said now are
[1:35:39] you ready for this
[1:35:41] church he said through the fall he lost
[1:35:44] that power then he become unconscious of
[1:35:47] the fact after losing his relationship
[1:35:50] and friend ship and fellowship with the
[1:35:52] father he lost that and all of his great
[1:35:55] channels become cogged up and he
[1:35:57] couldn't get through he said now what
[1:36:00] Adam was in God Christ has redeemed us
[1:36:03] back to that now a redeemer is to redeem
[1:36:06] anything is to bring it back to its
[1:36:09] origin again come on church it's time on
[1:36:11] a Thursday night to go back to the
[1:36:14] beginning it's time to go back to the
[1:36:16] old Landmark it's time to go back to
[1:36:18] Genesis 1 where you were not inferior
[1:36:21] and the devil was superior but it's time
[1:36:23] to go back to where you was Superior and
[1:36:25] every devil was
[1:36:28] inferior listen Church Satan knows
[1:36:31] tonight he knows that he will never
[1:36:33] defeat God somebody say Satan knows
[1:36:36] Satan knows he will never defeat God so
[1:36:40] he's oh god brother Matt he knows he
[1:36:43] will never defeat God so he's always
[1:36:45] attacking the closest thing to God he
[1:36:49] knows he'll never defeat God he knows
[1:36:51] he'll never defeat the bridegroom
[1:36:53] brother Barry so what does he do he
[1:36:55] constantly attacks the closest thing to
[1:36:58] God and the closest thing to God Is His
[1:37:02] Bride come on church so because the
[1:37:05] devil knows he'll never defeat God he's
[1:37:07] trying to defeat you but I just want to
[1:37:09] put hell on notice tonight he will never
[1:37:11] defeat the bridegroom and he will never
[1:37:14] defeat the
[1:37:15] bride he can shoot he can throw he can
[1:37:19] kick he can holler but there is an
[1:37:22] anointing that has been released in this
[1:37:24] generation in other
[1:37:26] words in other words in the closest
[1:37:29] thing to God he says all of the plumbing
[1:37:32] as it was in our brain and the outlets
[1:37:35] the faith has been clogged up with
[1:37:37] business affair with home life with
[1:37:40] domestic things it's become so clogged
[1:37:43] up until God cannot operate through
[1:37:46] those channels that he made a man
[1:37:49] for if God designed man's body he
[1:37:52] certainly designed the body of his son
[1:37:55] the church and he's designed us to come
[1:37:58] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:38:01] Jesus and have the supernatural workings
[1:38:04] of God Outlets through gifts of the
[1:38:07] Spirit such as prophecy wisdom knowledge
[1:38:09] gifts healing and not as an individual
[1:38:11] so much but us as a unit we're all
[1:38:14] together one great body of people the
[1:38:18] Bible said we have spooled the
[1:38:19] principalities and Powers brother B said
[1:38:21] watch you know what that word spool the
[1:38:23] word spool means disarmed brother said
[1:38:25] this is the confidence we have in God
[1:38:27] that we got what we asked for for he's
[1:38:28] God and he cannot take back his word
[1:38:31] he's got to stay with that word we was
[1:38:33] made for that
[1:38:34] purpose and the only thing that hindered
[1:38:37] the human race today from being Superior
[1:38:39] controlling like they did in the
[1:38:41] beginning is because the power lines of
[1:38:44] the lines of the outlet of God made in
[1:38:46] the human being has been clogged up now
[1:38:49] I just got to say what the prophet said
[1:38:50] he said the Oles cloged those lines up
[1:38:53] he said how much more then could the
[1:38:55] power of God the Holy Ghost once passing
[1:38:58] through the human heart by faith what
[1:39:00] would what could it do he said look what
[1:39:02] the Holy Spirit has promised to
[1:39:04] Believers today he said now if God could
[1:39:06] ever just clear that little Channel out
[1:39:08] I'm I'm I'm closing on this point if God
[1:39:11] could ever just clear that little
[1:39:12] Channel out and run energy out to that
[1:39:15] place then something's going to
[1:39:19] happen listen I've been in youth camps
[1:39:21] before as a
[1:39:23] camper I've seen the Holy Ghost move in
[1:39:25] a meeting change a life bring that
[1:39:27] change life back to a dorm and change
[1:39:30] another
[1:39:32] life I've literally seen
[1:39:36] that you know why oh my I'm out of time
[1:39:40] you know why because the five-fold
[1:39:42] ministry can I say it this way is
[1:39:46] electricians they're wiring the
[1:39:48] spiritual building of the body and the
[1:39:50] prophet of God said if properly taught
[1:39:51] in every fiber of our body being Lost In
[1:39:53] Christ to his word he said if you got
[1:39:55] all the theology got some Doctrine got
[1:39:57] some Superstition got some unbelief got
[1:39:59] something that stops up somewhere then
[1:40:00] the energy can ever pull through you but
[1:40:02] when you get to a place where you're
[1:40:04] perfectly
[1:40:05] wired and the master electrician has
[1:40:07] okay it by sealing it with the Holy
[1:40:09] Spirit the only thing is just turn on
[1:40:11] the switch then there'll be a light show
[1:40:14] that's
[1:40:16] right somebody say these words with me
[1:40:19] make this Valley
[1:40:21] full of
[1:40:23] ditches listen Church the water is
[1:40:27] here as our musicians are coming the
[1:40:31] water is here in the book of Kings the
[1:40:33] Bible says he saw he saw a vision y'all
[1:40:36] y'all familiar with it he said bring a
[1:40:38] Minstrel and he came and and when a
[1:40:40] Minstrel played the hand of the Lord
[1:40:41] came upon him and he said thus saith the
[1:40:43] Lord make this Valley full of ditches
[1:40:46] now watch this for thus saith the Lord
[1:40:49] ye shall not see wind neither shall you
[1:40:52] see rain yet the valley shall be filled
[1:40:54] with water that ye may drink both ye
[1:40:57] your cattle and your beast and this is
[1:40:59] but a light thing in the sight of the
[1:41:01] Lord but he will deliver the moabites
[1:41:04] also into your hand and you shall Smite
[1:41:07] every fence City every choice City and
[1:41:10] shall fail every good tree and stop all
[1:41:13] Wells of water and Mar every good piece

[1:44:45] by
[1:44:47] faith won you stand to your feet with us
[1:44:49] tonight
[1:44:54] that's what we got to do
[1:44:55] tonight can I say what a prophet said he
[1:44:59] said the smitten Rock tonight is
[1:45:04] here brother Paul the same rock that
[1:45:08] Moses spoke to years ago and water come
[1:45:11] out of

[1:45:28] devil's put a bad name on digging but I
[1:45:29] believe in
[1:45:31] digging I believe in digging things
[1:45:36] out I believe when you come up against a
[1:45:39] wall and you realize there ain't no
[1:45:40] water
[1:45:41] falling there ain't no
[1:45:43] anointing there ain't no Spirit there
[1:45:45] ain't no joy church is just a ritual
[1:45:49] fear has become your guide
[1:45:53] what people say about you is become your
[1:45:56] limitations what somebody thinks about
[1:45:58] you is become the way you live I'm
[1:46:00] preaching to you right
[1:46:02] now tell you what I believe I believe
[1:46:04] when that happens it's time to get to
[1:46:07] digging don't get mad at me please
[1:46:13] don't but I'm afraid some of us have got
[1:46:15] to shout more than we got to
[1:46:19] digging don't get mad at me cuz you know
[1:46:22] I love shouting and dancing as much as
[1:46:23] anybody in the world but the prophet of
[1:46:25] God said you ain't going to stomp this
[1:46:27] devil out he said you got to dig this
[1:46:30] devil out he said the way you dig is you
[1:46:33] repent what has happened to the ability
[1:46:35] to say I'm
[1:46:40] wrong we live in a generation where
[1:46:43] nobody's wrong everybody's right so that
[1:46:45] spirit is coming right in the
[1:46:48] message and nobody's wrong everybody's
[1:46:50] right it's his fault his fault his fault
[1:46:52] somebody else's fault it's not mine if
[1:46:56] [Music]
[1:46:58] some and you know what you're doing
[1:47:00] you're sitting there spiritually
[1:47:02] dying blaming this person and blaming
[1:47:04] that
[1:47:06] person but I'm just going to tell you
[1:47:08] what the prophet said he said the deeper
[1:47:10] you dig the more water you get no matter
[1:47:13] how much preaching there is how many
[1:47:14] Visions there are the subject was then
[1:47:16] and the main principle was make ready
[1:47:17] for the water get the ditches dug he
[1:47:20] said that's the way you got to do
[1:47:21] tonight is make way for the Holy Ghost
[1:47:23] to pour down make it in your house make

[1:52:18] Trees of the Earth he forgot those
[1:52:20] things Lord and father what caused that
[1:52:23] was some channels in his in his brain
[1:52:26] got clogged Lord is I was just talking
[1:52:28] to a brother the other day and he was
[1:52:30] sharing with me how that all of a sudden

[1:53:03] I begin to remember how to do things
[1:53:04] around my house I remember how to get
[1:53:06] places Lord I couldn't help but think of
[1:53:08] your prophet in the message spiritual
[1:53:10] Amnesia Lord father when that Soldier
[1:53:12] was coming home and Lord he had forgot
[1:53:14] about how to get home he forgot who he
