[4:12] jumped in here in the in the middle of
[4:13] things. I want to make a quick
[4:14] announcement before brother Luther uh
[4:16] takes that prayer request. Sorry,
[4:18] brother Tony, I didn't warn you. But um
[4:20] I wanted to ask prayer um for Sister
[4:23] Jean today. And uh she is just really
[4:27] suffering. The devil is attacked her.
[4:29] And uh with that flu bug going around,
[4:31] we don't know if it's the COVID flu, the
[4:34] non-COVID flu. Anyway, she's pretty sick
[4:36] and um and so she was asking to please
[4:40] ask you for extra prayer today. She's
[4:42] been several days and we've been taking
[4:44] her stuff and trying to care for and
[4:46] pray for her, but she's uh in need of
[4:49] prayer today. So, Sister Evelyn, that's
[4:50] where your buddy is today. Amen. And I'm
[4:53] also uh like to ask extended prayer for
[4:56] me. Amen. Uh for those of you who
[4:59] weren't able to be here, I took the
[5:00] Sunday school class today. Uh, brother
[5:02] Matthew is taking the Sunday regular
[5:05] service. I've got to um try to keep
[5:09] myself uh unexerted because these uh
[5:12] this shingles has now moved through its
[5:14] fourth week and it's still um bothering
[5:17] me to some degree. In fact, is it seems
[5:20] to be migrating now to the other side of
[5:22] my head. I don't know. I don't want to
[5:24] think about it. But um four weeks of
[5:27] medication have have have also kind of
[5:30] destroyed my system as it were and um
[5:34] suffering a lot and I've not got a lot
[5:36] of sleep over the last four weeks. Last
[5:38] night was a pretty bad night uh for
[5:41] sleep and um a lot of discomfort today.
[5:44] So your pastor needs your prayer. Amen.
[5:47] And I just want to make an announcement
[5:48] so you know why brother Matt and I uh
[5:51] switched out today. Amen. And God bless
[5:53] you, brother.
[5:55] Amen.
[5:58] Praise the Lord. Um, Sister Melissa's
[6:01] not feeling well today either. And um, I
[6:05] need prayers whether you believe it or
[6:07] not.
[6:09] I have aches and pains from
[6:12] getting a little older than some of you.
[6:15] Anyway,
[6:17] but God has been very good to me. I I
[6:19] have to admit I am very very thankful
[6:21] for the health that I have today.
[6:23] Amen. So let's pray.
[6:27] Oh father, Lord, I love you this

[6:50] and [music] you would do it. Lord, I'm

[7:17] the great things [music] that you are
[7:19] for us is our healer.
[7:21] We claim that healing, Father, in the
[7:23] name of [music] Jesus Christ. As we

[28:48] my typical time to send my PowerPoint is
[28:51] right before I walk out.
[28:54] So, Brother Mark says, "Not that one.
[28:55] Not that one. That's the wrong
[28:57] preacher."
[28:59] Ephesians chapter 3. While he's finding
[29:01] that, I sent that, I think, to the uh
[29:03] He's got it. Okay. Ephesians chapter 3.
[29:06] I want to preach to you this morning,
[29:07] and I'm got a very simple title. There's
[29:10] always more.
[29:12] That's my title.
[29:15] Let's just begin reading here at verse
[29:17] 7. This is Ephesians 3:7.
[29:21] Whereof I was made a minister according
[29:23] to the gift of the grace of God given
[29:25] unto me by the effectual working of
[29:29] whose power?
[29:31] His power. By the effectual working of
[29:35] his power
[29:37] unto me who am less than who am less
[29:41] than the least of all saints. How many
[29:44] feel that way? Amen.
[29:46] Is this grace given that I should preach
[29:49] among the Gentiles the unsearchable
[29:52] riches of Christ, and to make all men
[29:56] see what is the fellowship of the
[29:58] mystery which from the beginning of the
[30:00] world hath been hidden God who created
[30:03] all things by Jesus Christ. To the
[30:07] intent, let's look at verse 10. to the
[30:09] intent that now unto the principalities
[30:13] and powers and heavenly places might be
[30:15] known by the church, the manifold wisdom
[30:19] of God according to the eternal purpose
[30:22] which he purposed in Christ Jesus our
[30:25] Lord. Now remember in Christ Jesus was
[30:28] not just all of God. We know that
[30:30] brother Brandham said that Jesus wasn't
[30:33] in the Godhead but the Godhead was in
[30:35] Jesus. That's a very big distinction. He
[30:38] wasn't part of a three-fold godhead,
[30:40] right? But he was the Godhead himself,
[30:43] all of the fullness of God. So he says
[30:45] according to the eternal purpose which
[30:48] he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[30:50] But we know that not just was it wasn't
[30:53] just God in flesh. It wasn't just deity,
[30:56] but you were in Christ. I was in Christ.
[30:59] So that means that the eternal purpose
[31:01] that God had didn't just have Christ in
[31:03] mind, but it also had you in mind
[31:06] because there's a people who are
[31:07] literally Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[31:10] So the conquering that God would do
[31:11] through Christ, he would ultimately do
[31:14] through his body, his wife, the the
[31:17] lamb's wife. We know that that's who
[31:19] overcomes the wicked one in this
[31:21] generation is Christ through the lamb's
[31:24] wife, the bride.
[31:26] Not notice here again verse 11.
[31:29] according to the eternal purpose which
[31:31] he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord in
[31:34] whom we have boldness and I'm so
[31:37] grateful for this access
[31:39] with confidence that means we don't need
[31:41] to be sheepish about it we don't need to
[31:43] be shy or timid about it but you have
[31:46] access and you can be bold about that
[31:48] access not because of anything you did
[31:50] but the lion of the tribe of Judah has
[31:53] prevailed and given you boldness to
[31:56] enter in notice he says for this in whom
[31:58] We have boldness and access and with
[32:00] confidence by faith of him. Wherefore I
[32:03] desire that you faint not at my
[32:05] tribulations for you which is your
[32:07] glory. For this cause I bow my knees
[32:10] unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[32:12] of whom the whole family in heaven and
[32:15] earth is named that he would grant you
[32:19] according to the riches of his glory to
[32:22] be strengthened with might
[32:24] by his spirit in the inner man. Lord,
[32:27] we're so grateful for the reading of
[32:29] your word. Knowing, Lord Jesus, that
[32:32] today, Father, as we stand here, Lord,
[32:34] and that I'm here, Father, just right in
[32:37] the midst of all of those that are under
[32:39] the sound of my voice, Lord, I'm just
[32:42] right here. We're all, Father, as it
[32:44] were at your table, Lord. And your
[32:46] prophet said that even before the world
[32:49] began, before the earth began, that our
[32:52] bodies were laying there already in the
[32:55] earth. the material was already there,
[32:58] Lord. And your prophet said before you
[32:59] ever started spinning the first star,
[33:02] creating the first tree, causing the
[33:04] grass or the the Lord, the the flowers
[33:07] to bloom, that you already had our
[33:10] purpose and a vision for our life laying
[33:13] in the seed. Lord, we're so grateful for
[33:16] that. knowing, Lord, that you've brought
[33:18] us here for a specific time, Lord, to
[33:20] serve you in this generation, a wicked
[33:23] generation, a world that's dark, Lord.
[33:26] But in that darkness, there's a light in
[33:28] the evening time, Lord. And we have that
[33:30] light inside of our hearts. That's why
[33:32] we're here. We ask now, Lord, for you to
[33:34] come and take your word, Lord. How we
[33:37] need you this morning, to come and take
[33:39] your word, Father, and break it to our
[33:41] hearts. We're standing in great need,
[33:43] Lord, of you. In the allsufficient name
[33:46] of Jesus Christ, we ask these things.
[33:49] Amen. Amen. You can be seated this
[33:52] morning. I'm preaching to you today on a
[33:54] title.
[33:56] There's always more. I've could have
[33:59] named it there's more. Just this was the
[34:02] title the Lord gave me. But very quite
[34:04] simply, very simple title with a very
[34:07] simple message. There's always more.
[34:11] Brother Brandham says in a hidden life
[34:13] and I just want to use this as a keynote
[34:16] quote. Uh I listened to this message
[34:18] just two nights ago and and just feasted
[34:21] feasted on it. If you want a real good
[34:22] one, 1955, this message here, a hidden
[34:25] life, Brother Brandham says here, and I
[34:27] thought that
[34:29] when Martin Luther reached justification
[34:32] by faith, he thought that settled it.
[34:35] That was the light for his day. and he
[34:39] preached it and believed it and held on
[34:41] to it and it was the light of that day.
[34:44] Then he entered another veil, a man John
[34:48] Wesley when Calvinism began to sweep the
[34:51] nation and they settled down to saying,
[34:53] "What's God going to do? He will do and
[34:55] does us no good to have a revival."
[34:58] God raised up John Wesley and he
[35:01] certainly smashed Calvinism to the
[35:03] ground to the place where it ought to
[35:05] have its right balance under the works
[35:08] of sanctification, the second work of
[35:10] grace. In other words, the prophet is
[35:12] saying it was good that Martin Luther
[35:15] believed in the just shall live by
[35:16] faith. What Calvin believed and what God
[35:19] originally revealed was there was
[35:21] nothing wrong with that, but there was
[35:22] more coming. And so God said, 'I don't
[35:25] want you to settle down on just what
[35:27] Calvin, just what Luther brought of the
[35:28] just shall live by faith, but John
[35:30] Wesley raised up. And he says, and the
[35:33] Nazarines carried it on, and along come
[35:35] the Pentecostals, the next the baptism
[35:38] of the Holy Spirit, moving on up into
[35:41] higher heights. Remember, God's always
[35:45] going up. He's never staying here, and
[35:48] he's never going down. He's always
[35:51] moving up. The way God has is forward.
[35:53] He doesn't have a gear of neutral and he
[35:56] doesn't have a gear of reverse. I know
[35:58] we love we hate change. All of us here
[36:00] today, there would be almost no person
[36:02] you'd talk to who would say, "I like
[36:04] change." Because that's not part of
[36:05] human nature. Human nature loves things
[36:09] to stay the same. Now, of course, if
[36:10] your world is falling apart and your
[36:12] house is on fire, of course, you won't
[36:14] change. But when the when the going's
[36:17] good and and you you like people, what
[36:19] do we do? As creatures of of humanity,
[36:21] we we like to, you know, get all things
[36:23] in order, get our life in order, and we
[36:26] accomplish our dreams and our visions of
[36:28] what we planned. And then once we get
[36:30] somewhere just closely akin to what we
[36:33] called perfect,
[36:35] we like it to stay that way. We don't
[36:37] like change. None of us here like
[36:39] change. I don't like seeing people, my
[36:41] children grow up. I can't even look at
[36:43] the pictures of my children when they
[36:45] were small. I'm sure I'm not the only
[36:47] one who would relate and feel that way.
[36:48] Do you feel that way? You hate change.
[36:50] You want things to always stay just like
[36:53] they are. If they could just be just
[36:55] like this. But we've got to realize
[36:57] we're creatures that are moving. We're
[36:59] on the move. And there's always change.
[37:02] There's always God always has a gear and
[37:05] he's trying to move you forward.
[37:09] No, we don't like to hear that. I want
[37:10] the church the way that the church
[37:12] always was. If we could only go back to
[37:14] how it was yesterday. Listen friends,
[37:16] you can keep wishing for how it was
[37:18] yesterday and you'll miss what God is
[37:20] doing right now. That what God does in
[37:23] progression is always greater than
[37:25] anything he's done in the past because
[37:27] it's a further progression. So God says,
[37:29] notice Wesley comes along and it was a
[37:32] second work of grace. He's always moving
[37:34] up. He's moving up into higher heights.
[37:37] And he says, "And now when the brethren
[37:39] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[37:41] they said, "This is the summit."
[37:46] This is all of it.
[37:48] Now, this is brother Brandon referring
[37:50] to though when the baptism of the Holy
[37:52] Ghost was poured out on Pentecost. This
[37:54] was the restoration. It was another work
[37:56] of grace. And brother Brandham says
[37:58] Martin or Luther thought when
[38:00] justification came, this is it. This is
[38:02] all there is to it. This is all God
[38:04] wants to reveal. So what did he do? He
[38:06] preached it. He lived it. An entire
[38:08] generation of people gathered under that
[38:10] revelation of the just shall live by
[38:13] faith. They've made churches out of it.
[38:15] They made a doctrine out of it. They
[38:17] made an entire denomination around it.
[38:19] Notice what man always does is he likes
[38:22] to get some of God, settle with what God
[38:24] sends, create a denomination, and say,
[38:26] "We're the only ones who have it. This
[38:28] is it. If you want it, you got to get it
[38:30] here." And they put a period on God and
[38:32] [snorts] restrict the Holy Spirit from
[38:35] moving and bringing more. But you see,
[38:37] God always has more. He always has more.
[38:41] See, brother M, we received the message
[38:43] over the hour. Let me just tell you what
[38:45] we read in Ephesians 3. There's the
[38:47] uncarchable riches of God.
[38:49] Let me just say there's always more of
[38:52] God unfolding himself.
[38:56] Got a very simple just just right here,
[38:59] right now. Well, I just want to tell you
[39:00] I've got a very simple message today.
[39:02] So, don't wait for some big bang at the
[39:04] end. This is it. There's always more.
[39:08] God always has more for you. If you
[39:10] thought you were done growing, you're
[39:12] not. If you thought you were done
[39:13] receiving, you're not. If you thought
[39:15] that God was done developing, he's not.
[39:18] And until this body changes, there's an
[39:21] always an ever growing and ever
[39:23] increasing and everchanging. There's
[39:25] always a dying out and emptying out and
[39:27] a refilling. Brother Brandham says even
[39:29] when they received the Holy Ghost, they
[39:31] said, "This is the summit. This is all
[39:34] of it." As God opens the gate and swings
[39:38] out the welcome mat, Brother Brandham
[39:40] says here, I must have missed a a
[39:42] portion. Let me just read it from from
[39:44] uh from the table here because I I
[39:45] missed it. I want to make sure I get it.
[39:47] Brother Brandham says, "And now when the
[39:48] brethren receive the baptism of the Holy
[39:50] Ghost," did I not get that? Uh moving
[39:52] on. Ah, my goodness, I didn't. I don't
[39:55] think I pasted it in. Let me try it
[39:56] again.
[39:59] Okay, let me go back. If not, you're
[40:01] just going to have to listen close. This
[40:04] is the summit of it. Yes, I've missed
[40:05] it. That's all right. He says, "This is
[40:07] the summit of it. This is all of it." I
[40:10] promise I wasn't trying to hide
[40:11] anything.
[40:14] He says, "But brethren, that's wrong."
[40:18] See, there's no summit to God's power.
[40:24] Amen.
[40:25] Amen.
[40:25] I want that just to stick here for a
[40:27] moment.
[40:28] There's no summit to God's power.
[40:33] No summit. In other words, you don't
[40:35] reach the height. One day we're
[40:37] traveling and then we reach it and then
[40:39] that's it. Then we settle down. He says
[40:41] there's no summit to God's power. We
[40:44] move on and on and on. It's the
[40:48] unlimited resources of God that has
[40:52] never been tapped yet. Blessings and
[40:55] powers that we know nothing about. It's
[40:57] never been even revealed to archangels.
[41:01] Is laying just ahead for his church that
[41:04] will believe.
[41:06] Amen. For eye hath not seen, ear hath
[41:09] not heard, neither has it entered the
[41:12] hearts of man what God has for them in
[41:15] store that love him. I just want to
[41:17] preach to you today. There is no summit
[41:20] to the power of God.
[41:22] If you want more, there's more for you
[41:25] to receive. If there's a desire for more
[41:28] of God, then that means there must be
[41:30] more of God for you to have. If there's
[41:32] more, if there's a desire for more
[41:34] revelation than God has himself, he
[41:36] wants to reveal to you. There's no
[41:39] summit of it. There's power, untapped
[41:41] resources, blessings, and powers. It's
[41:44] never even been revealed. So, let's move
[41:46] on up. Brother says, "So, let's move on
[41:49] up and claim our rights as God opens the
[41:53] gate and swings out the welcome map.
[41:56] Let's move on up into deeper depths."
[41:59] and never notice here I've got it right
[42:01] here on the screen. Let's move into
[42:03] deeper depths and never colonize
[42:06] ourselves
[42:08] to organize ourselves and to get into a
[42:11] place where well we believe this and
[42:14] that's all. Let's believe this PLUS HOW
[42:18] MUCH MORE we can hear from God.
[42:20] I think that ought to be the motive of
[42:23] every man and woman that loves the Lord
[42:25] Jesus. And I say, "God, that's my motive
[42:28] of my heart to say, Lord, I'm never
[42:30] going to get to a place to where I
[42:31] colonize and camp down, but I'm going to
[42:34] say, if you've got more, Lord, then
[42:36] here's my cup.
[42:37] Fill it up."
[42:39] And he says, "Every man, TO RECEIVE ALL
[42:42] THAT YOU can from the hand of his
[42:45] bountiful mercies." That's my heart.
[42:48] That's my heart, too, brother Brandham.
[42:50] TO RECEIVE ALL OF HIS bountiful mercies.
[42:55] Notice, brother Madam says, "But
[42:56] brethren, that's wrong there. I have it.
[42:58] I knew that I had it and it was just out
[42:59] of order." That's okay. Brother says
[43:02] this, "And you must be born again."
[43:03] Notice because notice the prophet of God
[43:05] even types this in the in the countdown.
[43:08] And forgive me and bear with me just for
[43:10] a moment as I just take just a minute to
[43:12] maybe teach and lay a foundation here.
[43:14] Brother Manam even uses the countdown
[43:16] and he preaches that message multiple
[43:18] times. And he begins to talk about how
[43:21] that every time man made an achievement
[43:24] that it was it was something that man
[43:27] did in the natural that only signified
[43:30] something that God was doing in the
[43:31] spiritual. Is that right?
[43:33] And so brother man says uses the create
[43:35] the the the horse and buggy and he says
[43:38] when man uh you know discovered the
[43:40] horse and buggy it was a further power
[43:42] to do what to move to go forward to for
[43:46] transportation. And it was always God
[43:48] moving forward. And he said when when
[43:50] God when they discovered the horse and
[43:52] buggy, it was only representative of
[43:55] something God was doing in the
[43:56] supernatural. He uses the same thing to
[43:59] talk about the automobile. And he says
[44:01] when Henry Ford discovered the model T4
[44:04] discovered the automobile and he says it
[44:06] was only representative that man was
[44:08] discovering something, God was allowing
[44:11] him to tap into an intellect or a
[44:13] knowledge. And that knowledge was only
[44:16] representative of God about to release a
[44:20] revelation. Remember, God doesn't work
[44:22] by information. God doesn't work by
[44:24] knowledge. That's what the devil works
[44:26] by. Hello, somebody. Are you here this
[44:27] morning? So God So the So God doesn't
[44:30] work by information. He works by
[44:32] revelation. There's a very very big
[44:34] difference between information and
[44:36] revelation. You can understand all the
[44:38] mysteries. You can understand all of the
[44:41] doctrines of the message and miss the
[44:43] person and then what good does it do
[44:45] you? Let me just ask you, what good
[44:47] would it do for me to understand all the
[44:50] mysteries from the beginning of the
[44:51] Bible? This Bible can become a brand new
[44:54] book intellectually and understand all
[44:56] of the mysteries of who the serpent seed
[44:58] was and what the Godhead was and what
[45:00] predestination was and what that there
[45:03] was no eternal hell and all of these
[45:05] wonderful truths. But friends, if at the
[45:07] end of all of that, it doesn't tell me
[45:09] who I am, then what good does it do? So
[45:12] when God reveals the word, IT'S TO
[45:15] REVEAL SOMETHING ABOUT YOU.
[45:18] THAT YOU'RE connected to the mystery,
[45:20] that you're connected to the knowledge,
[45:22] that you're connected to the revelation.
[45:24] And so God wanted to reveal more. So
[45:27] what did he brother Brandon says? He
[45:28] would discover the automobile. AND HE
[45:30] SAID, "WHAT WAS THAT?" That was only a
[45:33] representation that God was unveiling
[45:36] himself or releasing a part of himself
[45:38] back to the body. And so John Wesley
[45:41] comes with sanctification. Brother
[45:43] Brandon moves beyond that and says then
[45:45] they discover the jet aircraft and they
[45:47] took off. He said about the time the
[45:49] Wright brothers there in North Carolina
[45:51] were discovering flight. And he says
[45:54] about the time they were coming off of
[45:56] the ground, there was a little group in
[45:58] in Isuza Street in California that were
[46:01] coming off of the ground spiritually.
[46:03] Hallelujah. And he says about the time
[46:05] go man's always achieved something,
[46:07] God's always typed it because he was
[46:10] ready to unleash or release something
[46:15] about himself to his church.
[46:18] You say, "Did Wesley have it all?" He
[46:19] certainly didn't. Did Luther have it
[46:21] all? He certainly didn't. DID PENTECOST
[46:23] HAVE IT ALL? THEY CERTAINLY DID. DIDN'T.
[46:26] I'M THANKFUL FOR WHAT THEY HAD. WE DON'T
[46:28] DO AWAY WITH what they have. Brother
[46:30] Adam says, "Notice, one always added to
[46:33] the next one.
[46:35] IT NEVER TOOK AWAY."
[46:38] RIGHT?
[46:38] THAT'S WHAT THE PROPHET OF GOD SAYS. I
[46:40] didn't have time to put to read. I don't
[46:41] want to take the time. And he says,
[46:42] "Anytime God never takes away, he always
[46:47] adds to."
[46:49] I love that Jesus always multiplied. He
[46:52] never subtracted. He never took many and
[46:55] then He never took a lot and then made a
[46:57] few. He took just a couple and made
[46:59] many. He's always adding. He's always
[47:02] giving. He's always revealing. So,
[47:04] Brother Brandham says, "Notice." But
[47:06] notice each time that man discovered
[47:09] something, the material was always
[47:13] there.
[47:15] Hello.
[47:17] The material WHEN WHEN THEY DISCOVERED
[47:19] FLIGHT, GUESS WHAT? IN THE STONE AGES,
[47:22] FLIGHT WAS POSSIBLE.
[47:25] Brother Bham says even in the very
[47:27] beginning of creation, astronaut power
[47:29] was already available. Rocket power.
[47:32] Listen, they didn't come and create
[47:33] something. They took what was already
[47:35] there and mixed those together and then
[47:39] there was AN INVENTION. AND BROTHER BAM
[47:41] SAYS, WHAT DID Wesley do when he
[47:43] discovered sanctification? He didn't
[47:45] come up with some kind of new doctrine.
[47:47] He took the material that was already in
[47:49] the word, mixed the chemicals together,
[47:53] and he got SOMETHING FROM GOD. BROTHER
[47:55] BRANDHAM SAYS, "What did they do at
[47:56] Isuza Street?" They didn't come up with
[47:58] something new. THE POWER WAS ALWAYS
[48:00] THERE.
[48:02] AMEN.
[48:03] Imagine that the material was already in
[48:07] the earth.
[48:10] Amen.
[48:11] Brother says this, listen in our quote
[48:13] here and and you must be born again. Do
[48:15] you ever know the body that you're
[48:17] living in this morning was here 10,000
[48:21] years BEFORE ONE SPECK of life
[48:25] ever laid on the earth?
[48:28] The body you're IN NOW, SOMEBODY RAISE
[48:32] THEIR HAND.
[48:33] Look at your hand.
[48:36] The body that you live in
[48:39] was here thousands of years ago.
[48:43] Amen. Now I'm just reading what a
[48:45] prophet said so you can you can choke if
[48:47] you want but I'll just I'll say I I
[48:48] believe it Lord
[48:50] when notice what he says here is when
[48:52] God had this old missile hanging out
[48:53] yonder turning AROUND THE SUN AND
[48:55] REVOLVING AROUND IT THIS WAY AND WAS
[48:57] CREATED IN THERE CALCIUM pod ash and
[48:59] petroleums and so forth he laid in his
[49:02] notice he says and so forth he had in
[49:05] his great mind then that you'd set at
[49:08] this table this morning
[49:11] when he was creating pod ash and
[49:12] petroleum and calcium and all these
[49:14] things so forth and he was revolving it
[49:16] rolling together. He had in his great
[49:19] mind
[49:21] you sitting at this table this morning.
[49:25] When a carpenter goes to build I love
[49:27] this right here. When a carpenter goes
[49:30] to build a house, how does he do? He lay
[49:33] out he lays out all of his lumber first.
[49:36] He's got in his mind just what he's
[49:40] going to build. Amen.
[49:43] God had before the world was ever had a
[49:46] speck of life in it. He had your body
[49:50] laying right there. Don't ever let the
[49:53] devil tell you that your body is his
[49:55] body. Your body belongs to the Lord.
[49:59] The Bible even says, "Don't you know,
[50:01] KNOW YOU NOT, YOUR BODY, your body is a
[50:04] temple, is the temple of the Holy
[50:05] Ghost." So, you know what you TELL THE
[50:07] DEVIL? YOU DON'T belong in the temple of
[50:10] God. This isn't your body. This isn't
[50:12] your mind. This isn't your mouth. I'm
[50:14] not going to lend my mouth to your
[50:16] spirit. This body belongs to the HOLY
[50:19] GHOST.
[50:21] YOU OUGHT to tell the devil when he
[50:22] comes knocking at your door with doubt
[50:24] in YOUR MIND AND SAY, "DOUBT doesn't
[50:26] belong here. Jesus lives here." And in
[50:29] Jesus, there's no doubt. There's only
[50:30] faith.
[50:31] When dark thoughts start to creep in
[50:33] your mind, you ought to say, "Satan, you
[50:35] don't belong here. This is a temple of
[50:38] the Holy Ghost purchased by the blood of
[50:40] God.
[50:42] And he said he had your body laying. If
[50:44] he didn't, where did it come from?
[50:45] That's the reason he's twisting and
[50:47] rolling and turning. He would have to
[50:48] have the sun this way and it make pot
[50:51] ash. You turn it back this way and it
[50:53] make calcium. He turn it back this way,
[50:55] it would make petroleum. And after the
[50:58] earth had been shaped and all of it
[51:00] laying there, just a bleached desert,
[51:04] never had life on it. Notice he does all
[51:07] of this work creating all of the
[51:09] spinning all of the we don't know we can
[51:11] only imagine in our mind we could
[51:13] dramatize it you can watch uh you know
[51:15] maybe the story of creation and and
[51:18] artists have tried to to put maybe some
[51:20] kind of imagination of what it was like
[51:23] when the volcanoes were erupting.
[51:25] Brother Brandham does a wonderful job uh
[51:27] at dramatizing that. But but here God
[51:30] makes all of creation and everything
[51:33] he's making. And notice he's not I hope
[51:36] you catch this here. HE'S MAKING ALL OF
[51:39] the creation with all of the materials.
[51:41] But notice he's making the pot ash for
[51:44] something. HE'S NOT making it for
[51:46] itself. HE'S MAKING THE CALCIUM FOR
[51:49] SOMEBODY, NOT FOR THE CALCIUM ITSELF.
[51:51] He's provisioning something for
[51:55] somebody.
[51:57] AND SO ANYTIME GOD IS WORKING, I hope
[52:00] you catch it here. The events and
[52:02] circumstances around you are not are not
[52:05] being controlled by the let me say this
[52:07] here today. The things that are
[52:08] happening in your life, God is using
[52:11] those things for you.
[52:15] And brother Brandham says he's making
[52:17] all of this. He's twist spinning and
[52:18] twisting it. AND NOTICE ALL OF THE all
[52:22] after he gets it ALL DONE AND ALL
[52:24] COMPLETED. It was a bleached desert.
[52:26] Never had life on it. Never was nothing
[52:29] called life. But all the material was
[52:33] laying there to make our bodies.
[52:36] Amen.
[52:37] It was all ready there.
[52:42] I that that stood out to me so much
[52:45] hearing brother Caleb on Wednesday
[52:46] night. I came in the back office and
[52:47] told him, "Lord just started pondering,
[52:50] putting this thought I'm preaching today
[52:51] on my heart." Brother Adam says, "All of
[52:54] the material to discover the automobile
[52:58] was already in the earth. It just took
[53:02] somebody with enough faith to not trust
[53:05] what he understands or sees." Because if
[53:08] he stayed there with what he had, he'd
[53:11] say, "This is all of it. I guess there's
[53:13] nothing more. I GUESS WE'LL WALK TO GET
[53:15] AROUND the earth. Oh, we'll ride donkeys
[53:17] or ride camels.
[53:19] Brother Bam says, "BUT IT TOOK SOMEBODY
[53:21] TO BREAK OUT of that thinking. IT TOOK
[53:24] SOMEBODY TO BREAK THOSE CHAINS AND SAY,
[53:26] "NO, this isn't ALL OF IT. THERE'S GOT
[53:28] TO BE SOMETHING GREATER. IT WASN'T IN
[53:30] HIS MIND YET. He hadn't discovered it
[53:32] yet. But the material was already
[53:35] [screaming]
[53:36] laying there. I'm just going to skip
[53:38] ahead and tell you today, the material
[53:40] for your body to change is already here.
[53:43] It's not something that's coming. IT'S
[53:45] ALREADY IN THE seed laying down inside
[53:47] of you.
[53:49] But it takes somebody to believe and
[53:51] have rapturing faith
[53:53] to say that this isn't all of it.
[53:57] There's got to be more.
[53:59] Brother says, "All the material was
[54:02] laying there to make our bodies." I can
[54:04] hear him say to the great Holy Spirit,
[54:05] "Go now. Go forth now and brood over the
[54:09] earth. Now we know the word brood is the
[54:12] mother like the like like h like like
[54:14] the hen her brood or to coup like a dove
[54:19] calling to its mate go brood over the
[54:22] earth. Wow.
[54:23] Then this great Holy Spirit went forth
[54:26] and spread forth his wings over the
[54:28] earth and began to brood for a purpose.
[54:32] And that was to bring forth something to
[54:35] project what God was. As I said the
[54:39] other night, which was first, a sinner
[54:42] or A SAVIOR? WHAT ABOUT ALL THIS ANYHOW?
[54:45] WHICH WAS FIRST, a healer or sickness?
[54:51] You get what BROTHER MAN I'M SAYING? THE
[54:53] HEALER WAS FIRST.
[54:55] THE SAVIOR WAS FIRST.
[54:57] SO IN ORDER FOR GOD TO BE A HEALER, he
[55:00] had to allow you to get sick.
[55:02] But remember the sickness that he gave
[55:04] you was only to manifest who he was.
[55:08] And he says now we know that he says he
[55:10] says a sinner or a savior. What about it
[55:12] anyhow? And he says HE SAYS WHAT ABOUT
[55:15] IT ANYHOW? I'm reading the head of you.
[55:16] I'm sorry. Didn't didn't skip ahead. I
[55:18] thought that I did. Which was first, a
[55:20] healer or sickness? So notice what
[55:24] brother Brandham says. This is what came
[55:26] first. Remember God always creates the
[55:29] atmosphere or the habitat or the
[55:33] ecosystem before he ever puts creation
[55:35] in the earth. Before he ever made the
[55:38] first star, he makes the firmament.
[55:40] Before he ever plants the first FLOWER
[55:43] OR PUTS THE FIRST BEAUTIFUL, you want to
[55:45] enjoy it. But God said before I can put
[55:47] that flower on the earth, I first have
[55:50] to create the conditions or the home or
[55:54] the dwelling place or the atmosphere for
[55:58] it to live in or else it can never live.
[56:01] SO WHAT WAS GOD'S PURPOSE? THE SOIL OR
[56:04] THE FLOWER?
[56:06] AMEN.
[56:08] I'LL ASK IT MORE SIMPLY. Was the flower
[56:10] created for the earth or was the earth
[56:13] created for the flower?
[56:14] Amen. You ask for the same question for
[56:16] the fish. God had in his mind the
[56:19] creation of a fish. But before he could
[56:22] ever create the fish, he first had to
[56:25] create the condition or the water or the
[56:29] atmosphere or the habitat.
[56:32] SO GOD BEFORE HE EVER BEFORE THE PROBLEM
[56:36] ever came, he already had the solution.
[56:40] Before the fish ever needed water, water
[56:42] was already here. BEFORE THE FLOWER EVER
[56:45] came to be, the earth and the soil with
[56:48] all the nutrients, God already had it in
[56:52] the earth.
[56:54] Notice it's the same exact thing with
[56:56] the with with all of creation that God
[56:58] made before he made the creation. He
[57:01] first created the atmosphere.
[57:04] And as long as the creation dwells in
[57:08] the material that God created for him,
[57:11] that was already here, that was already
[57:13] provisioned, then it'll blossom and
[57:16] it'll bloom. What do you do when you
[57:17] plant a flower in the ground? And that
[57:19] seed starts to take take life. You don't
[57:22] see anything at first,
[57:24] but after a while, that soil that was
[57:26] there begins to break up and you have
[57:28] just a little bit of what is it? It's
[57:29] life coming forth. But before the seed
[57:33] was the soil and if you don't have the
[57:36] soil, you don't have the seed coming to
[57:39] life.
[57:41] It remains a seed.
[57:44] So you say, "Brother Matt, what are you
[57:45] saying?" I'm saying exactly what a
[57:47] prophet said.
[57:48] It takes the atmosphere to do anything.
[57:52] Brother says, "If you want to have a
[57:54] healing service, you've got to get in
[57:56] the spirit of a healing service."
[57:58] Did you know he said that? If you want
[58:01] to have a revival, you've got to get in
[58:03] the spirit of a revival.
[58:07] Hello.
[58:08] If you want to have a healing service,
[58:10] you got to get in the spirit of it.
[58:12] Brother takes that further and he says,
[58:15] "In order for there to be a last days,
[58:18] the people have to first get in the
[58:21] spirit of the last days."
[58:24] Amen.
[58:25] So, you say, "Well, we know this is a
[58:26] certainty. There's going to be a last
[58:28] days.
[58:30] That's for ordained for for for that was
[58:33] predestinated in the back part of God's
[58:35] mind. There's going to be a last days.
[58:38] And so if there's going to be a last
[58:39] days, there's going to be a last day
[58:41] people. You say, why does God allow all
[58:44] the conditions of the world to take
[58:46] place? Man, if God is a loving God and
[58:49] God loves everybody, why wouldn't he uh,
[58:51] you know, just do WHY WOULDN'T HE STOP
[58:53] IT? WHY WOULDN'T HE STOP SOME of the
[58:55] hatred that we see? WHY WHY WOULD HE
[58:57] STOP SOME OF THE SOME of the problems we
[58:59] see in the world? You have to understand
[59:01] there has to be. Brother Adam says, in
[59:03] order for there to be a last day,
[59:05] there's got to be a last people fall in
[59:07] the spirit of the last days.
[59:11] You say, "Brother Matt, what are you
[59:12] saying?" I'm saying that in order for
[59:14] the insanity to come upon the world,
[59:16] people's got to go insane.
[59:18] That's why the that's why the the world
[59:20] is in the condition that it is. Because
[59:23] brother random said in order for there
[59:24] to be a last day, the people had to get
[59:26] into the last day spirit. In order for
[59:29] there TO BE A REVIVAL, the people have
[59:31] to get in THE SPIRIT OF REVIVAL. YOU
[59:33] SAY, "BROTHER MATT, WHAT ARE YOU
[59:34] SAYING?" In order for a word to come,
[59:36] there's got to be a PEOPLE TO RECEIVE
[59:39] THAT WORD.
[59:40] IN ORDER [screaming] FOR GOD TO UNVEIL
[59:42] HIMSELF, THERE'S GOT TO BE A PEOPLE WHO
[59:43] SAY, "UNVEIL YOURSELF TO ME, LORD." A
[59:46] HEART THAT'S OPEN.
[59:49] AMEN. And so, brother says, notice
[59:51] before there before there could ever be
[59:53] life that takes an atmosphere.
[59:58] Amen.
[59:58] What is in that atmosphere? Light.
[1:00:01] Takes light.
[1:00:03] Water takes water.
[1:00:05] It takes sunlight for that seed to come
[1:00:08] forth. You've got to get it in the right
[1:00:12] atmosphere. You can wish it. You can beg
[1:00:15] it. Put it in a closet. Put it in a dark
[1:00:17] room. Beg it. Wish it. plead over it,
[1:00:20] even pray over it, but until you get it
[1:00:24] in the right material that God
[1:00:26] provisioned for it, it will never come
[1:00:29] to life.
[1:00:30] Amen.
[1:00:32] Oh, I hope you're catching me here
[1:00:34] today. You can beg somebody to be a
[1:00:36] Christian. You could beg your children
[1:00:38] to serve the Lord. You could pressure
[1:00:39] them. You could prod them. You could
[1:00:41] push them. And I believe you should do
[1:00:43] everything you can to get them in the
[1:00:44] house of God. try to make um you know uh
[1:00:47] give them standards, hold rules, hold
[1:00:49] boundaries. But until the light in that
[1:00:52] atmosphere strikes that seed, IT'LL
[1:00:55] NEVER COME TO LIFE. YOU SAY, "THEN WHAT
[1:00:57] DO YOU NEED, BROTHER MATT?" YOU DON'T
[1:00:58] NEED PRESSURE. YOU DON'T NEED CRITICISM.
[1:01:00] YOU DON'T NEED TO TRY TO FORCE THEM.
[1:01:02] JUST GET THEM IN THE LIGHT.
[1:01:05] And if there's A SEED, THE LIGHT WILL
[1:01:07] COME FORTH.
[1:01:09] SO WHAT DO WE PRAY FOR? THE LIGHT OF THE
[1:01:11] REVELATION of God's word, the presence
[1:01:14] and the atmosphere of Jesus Christ. I
[1:01:16] SAID, "WHAT DO WE PRAY FOR? WHAT DO WE
[1:01:18] PREACH in our churches? WHAT DO WE WANT
[1:01:20] TO HAVE IN OUR ASSEMBLY? The presence of
[1:01:22] the sen to shine down on the seed that's
[1:01:26] in the earth."
[1:01:27] Amen.
[1:01:28] So God before he ever created that
[1:01:30] flower, he first creates the soil.
[1:01:34] And before he ever created the fish, he
[1:01:37] creates the water. And as long as the
[1:01:40] fish stays in the water, he breathes.
[1:01:46] But when you remove him from the from
[1:01:48] the material or the atmosphere or the
[1:01:51] condition in which God made him, he
[1:01:54] might breathe for a little while, but
[1:01:56] eventually those little gills
[1:02:00] will stop.
[1:02:02] You take that flower and you uproot it
[1:02:04] from the soil. You know, you put it in a
[1:02:07] pretty vase, put it in a glass, put it
[1:02:08] in the kitchen, RIGHT IN THE WINDOW
[1:02:10] SEAL, HAS WATER, brother Matt, it has
[1:02:12] the HAS THE WATER, IT HAS THE LIGHT. But
[1:02:15] let ME ASK YOU, SISTER, does those roses
[1:02:17] that that brother that your husband gets
[1:02:19] you on every every year for your
[1:02:21] anniversary, if you keep it in a pot and
[1:02:23] you keep it there, will it live forever?
[1:02:25] It won't live forever. Why? It wasn't
[1:02:27] made [screaming] to be in that
[1:02:29] atmosphere. AND IN THAT ATMOSPHERE, your
[1:02:32] atmosphere, and that atmosphere, it'll
[1:02:34] die. It'll wither. Amen.
[1:02:36] The blossoms, the petals will begin to
[1:02:38] fall. The leaves will begin to wither.
[1:02:41] Why? It wasn't created for that
[1:02:44] atmosphere.
[1:02:46] It was created for the soil that God
[1:02:49] made it for.
[1:02:52] You take the star out of the firmament
[1:02:55] and what do you have? A falling star.
[1:02:58] And you sit there at night and you watch
[1:02:59] it
[1:03:02] and it burns. You know, it wasn't
[1:03:05] created to do that. It was created to
[1:03:08] stay in the firmament, in its position,
[1:03:10] in its place, in its atmosphere. Listen
[1:03:13] to me, friends. He created the water for
[1:03:15] the fish. He created the soil for the
[1:03:18] flower. He creates the firmament for the
[1:03:20] stars. And what did he give for man? He
[1:03:24] gave him the material that he needed to
[1:03:26] live.
[1:03:27] Amen.
[1:03:28] The presence of Jesus, the presence of
[1:03:30] God.
[1:03:31] And as long as that seed gets in that
[1:03:34] atmosphere, he'll blossom. He'll bloom.
[1:03:37] He'll be what God created him to be. But
[1:03:39] when you remove man from that Eden, from
[1:03:42] that atmosphere, from that condition,
[1:03:44] from the material God made him for, then
[1:03:47] he becomes something God never intended
[1:03:49] for him to become.
[1:03:50] Amen.
[1:03:55] There's always there's I I love how
[1:03:57] brother Adam says this. Which was first,
[1:03:59] the healer or the sickness? The healer
[1:04:02] was which was first, the the the sinner
[1:04:06] or the savior? AND SO GOD ALREADY PUT
[1:04:09] THE MATERIAL THERE. The material was
[1:04:11] already laying there. Listen to what the
[1:04:14] prophet of God says in the message
[1:04:15] countdown. And I'm just going to read
[1:04:17] it. I don't have it here for you to
[1:04:18] read, but that's okay. I'm just going to
[1:04:20] read a couple just a couple quotes from
[1:04:22] it. If Wesley hadn't stepped out on the
[1:04:24] word and got a bad name behind him, was
[1:04:27] called a crazy man and everything else,
[1:04:29] he would have never been able to
[1:04:31] achieve.
[1:04:33] Amen.
[1:04:33] You say, "What did what did it take for
[1:04:35] Wesley?" It took Wesley to step out of
[1:04:37] what was norm. It took Wesley to make
[1:04:40] himself a spectacle. It took for Wesley
[1:04:43] to be called a crazy man. If he would
[1:04:46] have just stayed where he was, he would
[1:04:49] have never been able to achieve
[1:04:51] spiritual science. [snorts]
[1:04:54] Amen.
[1:04:55] That's what brother Brandham called it,
[1:04:56] spiritual scientist.
[1:04:58] He would have never been able to
[1:05:00] understand the mystery that God was
[1:05:02] wanting to reveal. But Wesley was one of
[1:05:05] God's great scientist.
[1:05:08] Luther was one of God's greatest
[1:05:11] scientists.
[1:05:12] Amen.
[1:05:13] They didn't care. WHY WERE they one of
[1:05:15] the greatest? BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T CARE
[1:05:17] WHAT ANYBODY ELSE SAID. They didn't care
[1:05:20] what anybody else thought. They didn't
[1:05:22] care what the rest of the church
[1:05:24] thought. Listen, until you stop caring
[1:05:26] about what everybody else thought,
[1:05:28] everything will just stay the same as it
[1:05:30] always was. It takes somebody to say, "I
[1:05:33] don't care what the rest of the world
[1:05:35] thinks. I DON'T CARE WHAT THE rest of
[1:05:37] the church thinks." Then God can do
[1:05:39] something for you.
[1:05:41] I don't care about my reputation. I
[1:05:43] don't care if people like me or dislike
[1:05:45] me.
[1:05:46] That's weird. You're right. You're
[1:05:48] weird.
[1:05:52] And anytime you're not, you're not what
[1:05:54] you're supposed to be.
[1:05:56] Hello.
[1:05:58] They didn't care what the church said.
[1:06:00] They didn't care. Listen, all those
[1:06:01] Roman Catholics, the Catholic Church, he
[1:06:04] didn't care. HE BELIEVED THE JUST SHALL
[1:06:07] LIVE BY FAITH.
[1:06:09] HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:10] HALLELUJAH. HE TOOK GOD'S CHEMICALS OF
[1:06:12] THE word and put it together and the
[1:06:15] church moved by faith. Wesley, come
[1:06:18] along. What did he do? He put it
[1:06:20] together by the blood and proved it by
[1:06:22] the blood. And you know what happened?
[1:06:25] The church got sanctified.
[1:06:27] Amen.
[1:06:28] The Pentecostals believe that the
[1:06:30] promise, notice, believe that the
[1:06:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost that the
[1:06:34] promise is to you and your children and
[1:06:37] them that's far off. And they put the
[1:06:39] chemicals together out of the word.
[1:06:44] So they didn't create something new.
[1:06:48] They didn't come up with something new.
[1:06:50] Man's always looking for his solution
[1:06:54] elsewhere. He never believes it's right
[1:06:56] in front of him.
[1:06:58] That's how we are. We always look for
[1:07:00] our answers somewhere else.
[1:07:03] I'm going to keep preaching and you guys
[1:07:05] can just be as quiet as you want. That's
[1:07:06] just fine. I'm just going to keep
[1:07:08] preaching.
[1:07:08] MAN ALWAYS LOOKS for his answers
[1:07:11] elsewhere.
[1:07:12] He misses the answer is right in front
[1:07:15] of him.
[1:07:17] The question that you're asking, it's
[1:07:19] already given.
[1:07:22] The problem, the thing that you think
[1:07:23] that YOU NEED THAT'S SOMEWHERE down the
[1:07:25] street, it's right here.
[1:07:28] And he says, WESLEY PUT IT TOGETHER AND
[1:07:30] HE SAYS he took the CHEMICALS OUT OF THE
[1:07:32] word and they moved up into the air.
[1:07:35] Hallelujah.
[1:07:36] They moved out because they were able to
[1:07:38] accomplish. Did you notice something?
[1:07:42] Every one of those achievements
[1:07:44] accompanied the other one, complimented
[1:07:47] the other one. It was only a higher
[1:07:50] form.
[1:07:52] So everything God wanted to give was
[1:07:56] right here
[1:07:58] waiting to be tapped into. Hallelujah.
[1:08:02] Not something coming, something already
[1:08:07] here.
[1:08:08] Praise God.
[1:08:09] You notice even when God pours out his
[1:08:11] spirit in the first early church, and
[1:08:13] I'm just going to take just a moment to
[1:08:15] to to to spend just some time here. So,
[1:08:18] just bear with me. If we pull that
[1:08:19] PowerPoint back up, I'm going to skip
[1:08:21] some of these uh down. We'll we'll get
[1:08:23] back to these. But listen to what
[1:08:24] Brother Brandham says here.
[1:08:27] Uh I have it. Yeah. Here. No, let me let
[1:08:30] me find it here. I've got it uh on my
[1:08:32] screen. It is here. Yes.
[1:08:36] And he says, "This is the identified
[1:08:38] Christ of all ages."
[1:08:40] So many people have different opinions
[1:08:42] of Christ. As I travel in different
[1:08:44] parts of the country and around the
[1:08:45] world, I find that so many people have
[1:08:48] their different opinions. You'd be
[1:08:50] surprised to know what some of their
[1:08:52] opinions are. I'm sure we would. Some of
[1:08:54] them thinks that he's just a wonderful
[1:08:56] teacher. Well, he was that.
[1:09:01] That's just exactly. Many of them thinks
[1:09:04] he was a great philosopher, which he was
[1:09:07] that. He certainly he was. Some of them
[1:09:11] think he was a good man. He was that.
[1:09:15] But see, he was more than that.
[1:09:18] HE WAS ALL OF THAT
[1:09:21] PLUS.
[1:09:23] Now notice, to miss any of him was to
[1:09:28] miss all of him.
[1:09:34] To miss any of him was to miss all of
[1:09:37] him.
[1:09:39] You could reach him and believe him as a
[1:09:41] GOOD TEACHER.
[1:09:42] BUT HE WAS A GOOD TEACHER. But if you
[1:09:45] only received HIM AS A GOOD TEACHER, YOU
[1:09:48] didn't receive any of him.
[1:09:50] You could believe he was a good man and
[1:09:51] he was a good man. But if you didn't
[1:09:54] believe all of him, you didn't receive
[1:09:57] any of him.
[1:09:58] Say the message of the hour is the power
[1:10:00] of God. It sure is. The message of the
[1:10:03] hour came to a came to a prophet. Uh I
[1:10:06] believe that with all of my heart. I
[1:10:08] believe he was Malachi 4. Listen
[1:10:10] friends, TO BELIEVE JUST PART of it, you
[1:10:13] miss all of it.
[1:10:15] Amen.
[1:10:17] Just to accept one part
[1:10:20] is to miss all of it. Notice brother Ram
[1:10:22] says he was all of that. He was a
[1:10:24] prophet. He was more than a prophet. He
[1:10:26] was the prophet. He was he was what the
[1:10:29] prophets was. Plus, how would we know
[1:10:32] now if he was teaching of his teachings?
[1:10:34] He was a teacher and he was a great
[1:10:36] philosopher.
[1:10:38] But the only way that we'll ever know
[1:10:41] today, if we wanted to identify him
[1:10:44] today, and I believe that he's raised
[1:10:46] from the dead, I believe that with all
[1:10:48] of my heart. I believe that he's
[1:10:51] promised here. He's the same yesterday,
[1:10:53] today, and forever. I am with thee
[1:10:56] always, and I'll never leave thee nor
[1:11:00] forsake thee. Now those words, they're
[1:11:03] either true or they're not true.
[1:11:09] So in other words, brother Brandham is
[1:11:10] saying either you believe that not only
[1:11:13] that he was, but also that he is.
[1:11:19] That's either true or that's not true.
[1:11:22] And if they're not true, then what are
[1:11:25] we doing here tonight?
[1:11:28] Right?
[1:11:29] We're wretched people. We're people
[1:11:31] that's well we're deceived. The whole
[1:11:32] Christian world is deceived. If he isn't
[1:11:35] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:11:39] If he isn't alive tonight. I love this.
[1:11:42] And with us as he promised. Lo, I am
[1:11:44] with you always. Even at the
[1:11:45] consummation or the end of the world,
[1:11:47] I'm with you always. Now, if that isn't
[1:11:50] the truth, then there's something wrong.
[1:11:52] And we are found false witnesses.
[1:11:55] Not only are we making ourselves
[1:11:57] miserable under a false pretense, but we
[1:11:59] are deceiving others. We are found
[1:12:02] deceivers of something we're talking
[1:12:05] about.
[1:12:07] Oh my, this just hit home SO MUCH.
[1:12:10] EITHER [screaming] WE BELIEVE ALL OF IT
[1:12:13] or we believe none of it.
[1:12:17] EITHER WE ACCEPT ALL OF IT or we believe
[1:12:20] none of it. Brother Vam says, "If not,
[1:12:22] we're just false witnesses." And he
[1:12:24] says, "Under false pretense, we're found
[1:12:26] deceivers of something we're talking
[1:12:28] about, which isn't if he's just a myth.
[1:12:32] If he's just a myth, or he's just a
[1:12:36] historical,
[1:12:39] what good is a historical Christ if he
[1:12:41] isn't the same today?" I say, "AMEN."
[1:12:44] BROTHER BRANDON,
[1:12:45] WHAT GOOD IS THE GOD of Moses if he
[1:12:47] isn't the same God today? I say amen.
[1:12:50] What good does it do to take your canary
[1:12:52] bird and feed him vitamins to make him
[1:12:54] have PRETTY FEATHERS AND GOOD strong
[1:12:56] wings
[1:12:57] and then keep him in a cage?
[1:13:00] See, it doesn't do him any good. And we
[1:13:04] talk about how great God was and then
[1:13:07] don't say he's the same today. Then
[1:13:10] there's something wrong.
[1:13:13] We're caged up somewhere. And that's a
[1:13:16] false conception of what God is.
[1:13:20] Amen.
[1:13:22] We preached on it here just a little
[1:13:23] while ago. Man always never has trouble.
[1:13:27] There's no intellectual dilemma. There's
[1:13:29] no pride problems which always get in
[1:13:31] the way. There's no intellectual
[1:13:33] problems that get in the way when we put
[1:13:36] Christ yesterday in history. They never
[1:13:39] have an issue with that. Man never has a
[1:13:42] problem looking at a historical Jesus
[1:13:45] and saying, "I believe him with all of
[1:13:47] my heart as long as you seal him up,
[1:13:49] contain him up to my denomination and my
[1:13:51] church and MY PASTOR AND ALL OF
[1:13:54] RECEIVED." LISTEN, this is what they
[1:13:55] believe. Everything God wanted to say,
[1:13:57] he already said it in Christ. Everything
[1:13:59] he wanted to reveal, he revealed in his
[1:14:01] word. I believe every bit of that. But
[1:14:03] if if the Wright brothers had that same
[1:14:06] attitude, WE WOULDN'T HAVE airplanes
[1:14:07] today. The material was already there.
[1:14:12] But it took the stimulation of faith by
[1:14:14] revelation to make it live.
[1:14:18] They never have trouble accepting Jesus
[1:14:21] yesterday.
[1:14:24] Hello.
[1:14:25] They never have trouble accepting Jesus
[1:14:28] yesterday. But when you make him or
[1:14:30] tomorrow, Brother Brandon would go on to
[1:14:32] say that they never have trouble if YOU
[1:14:34] PUT THE PROMISE OFF TO SOME OTHER DAY.
[1:14:38] AMEN.
[1:14:41] But make him the God of today, the Jesus
[1:14:45] of today.
[1:14:48] And then I don't know about that.
[1:14:51] That's getting a That's getting a little
[1:14:53] bit weird.
[1:14:56] That's getting a little bit strange. I
[1:14:58] don't know about that. You people put so
[1:14:59] much on that prophet and you quote
[1:15:01] brother Brandham so much. You just quote
[1:15:02] quote and quote unquote. You put so much
[1:15:04] on that. I mean, I can accept the you
[1:15:06] long as you're Isn't it amazing? People
[1:15:08] have no the the the the critical spirit
[1:15:10] that wants to come into the message
[1:15:11] ranks has no problem as long as I'm
[1:15:13] quoting Jesus from yesterday.
[1:15:16] But when I quote Jesus from today and
[1:15:18] what Jesus said today, suddenly, oh,
[1:15:21] y'all are just saying that y'all are
[1:15:22] quoting that prophet way too much.
[1:15:25] All right, somebody.
[1:15:27] I ain't afraid of that spirit. I'll keep
[1:15:28] preaching.
[1:15:30] THEY'RE TOTALLY FINE WITH SAYING HE WAS
[1:15:32] GOD OF YESTERDAY. But you put him today
[1:15:35] AND THEN SUDDENLY SUDDENLY WE DON'T WANT
[1:15:38] NO MORE. WE DON'T WANT NO. WE DON'T WANT
[1:15:40] THAT. DON'T PROGRESS ANYMORE. BUT LET ME
[1:15:42] JUST PREACH. THERE'S ALWAYS MORE. GOD
[1:15:45] ALWAYS WANTS TO GIVE MORE. HE WASN'T
[1:15:46] WANTING TO STAY IN CHRIST IN A MA A BABY
[1:15:49] IN a manger. So what DID HE DO? HE CAME
[1:15:51] AND PUT PUT HIMSELF IN A MAN. HE DIDN'T
[1:15:53] WANT TO STAY ON A CROSS.
[1:15:55] He wanted to come into a body of a
[1:15:57] person and speak through their lips.
[1:16:00] He wanted to live through a living
[1:16:02] church and a living bride.
[1:16:05] Anytime you put that God of today, then
[1:16:09] no, no, no. You know what? Just stop
[1:16:11] right there. We can't I don't don't
[1:16:12] don't want to go any further. Why can't
[1:16:15] we just accept what God did yesterday?
[1:16:17] You see what people want to do? They
[1:16:19] want to put Jesus as a Sunday school
[1:16:21] coloring book. And that's totally fine
[1:16:24] because you're coloring what he did
[1:16:25] yesterday. And I'm thankful for what he
[1:16:27] did yesterday. Amen.
[1:16:29] Amen.
[1:16:30] But you got to understand, church,
[1:16:31] there's more.
[1:16:34] THERE'S MORE. THERE'S MORE THAT GOD
[1:16:36] WANTS to reveal.
[1:16:38] AND I SAY, GOD, IF YOU WANT TO GIVE ME
[1:16:39] MORE, THEN I JUST WANT to never stop. I
[1:16:41] never want to put a period.
[1:16:43] I never want to clog up the channels. I
[1:16:45] want to open them to say, "Give me more,
[1:16:47] Lord.
[1:16:48] Give me more. Jesus,
[1:16:50] I believe you came." Listen to me,
[1:16:52] FRIENDS. HE WAS, WHAT WAS HE? AND IN in
[1:16:54] the book of Revelations, he was THE
[1:16:56] MIGHTY ANGEL. THE SAME ONE THAT APPEARED
[1:16:58] to Abraham
[1:17:00] and Sarah.
[1:17:02] Do you realize that's the pre-incarnate
[1:17:04] Christ? That was the same one. Melzdc
[1:17:07] was this was was Christ in a prefigure.
[1:17:10] Amen.
[1:17:10] This this who who was this king of
[1:17:12] Salem? It was Christ.
[1:17:16] Amen.
[1:17:16] But you couldn't stop there.
[1:17:19] Amen.
[1:17:19] You couldn't stop there. Are you with me
[1:17:21] here this morning?
[1:17:22] He was going to give more. He was going
[1:17:24] to open himself more. He was He was
[1:17:27] going to reveal himself more. IN
[1:17:30] REVELATIONS 5, LISTEN TO WHAT IT SAYS
[1:17:32] HERE. AND I SAW IT IN the right hand.
[1:17:34] Revelations 5. If you have your Bible,
[1:17:36] turn there with me. We'll keep the
[1:17:37] PowerPoint up so we don't have to go
[1:17:38] back and forth. Notice what he says
[1:17:40] here. And I saw in the right hand of him
[1:17:43] that sat on the throne a book written
[1:17:46] and within and on the back side. This is
[1:17:48] Revelations 5:1. I'm still hearing pages
[1:17:50] turned, so I'll just wait just a moment.
[1:17:52] Some of these young guys on the front.
[1:17:53] That's that's perfect. I want you to
[1:17:55] read it. So notice here.
[1:18:00] And I saw in the right hand him that sat
[1:18:02] on the throne a book written within AND
[1:18:05] ON THE BACKSIDE sealed with seven seals.
[1:18:08] And I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:18:10] with A LOUD VOICE. WHO IS worthy to open
[1:18:14] the book and to loose the seals thereof?
[1:18:18] And no man in heaven, nor in earth,
[1:18:21] neither under the earth, was able to
[1:18:23] open the book, neither to look thereon.
[1:18:27] So I want you TO NOTICE SOMETHING.
[1:18:28] REVELATIONS 5, THE BOOKS CLOSED. But
[1:18:31] what happens in Revelations 10 VERSE
[1:18:33] ONE? I SAW ANOTHER MIGHTY ANGEL COME
[1:18:36] down from heaven clothed with a cloud,
[1:18:38] rainbow upon his head, and his face was
[1:18:39] as it were the sun, his feet as pillars
[1:18:41] of fire, and he had in his hand a little
[1:18:45] book
[1:18:47] open.
[1:18:49] So what's happened? Progression.
[1:18:52] There was more.
[1:18:55] Are you following me this morning?
[1:18:57] THERE WAS MORE. GOD WASN'T GOING TO STAY
[1:18:59] WITH A SEALED BOOK. He was going to open
[1:19:01] that book and in his hand a book, a
[1:19:05] little book opened and he set his right
[1:19:08] foot upon the sea and his left foot upon
[1:19:11] the earth. And he says here, notice this
[1:19:14] here. What does he what does he tell
[1:19:16] John?
[1:19:18] Is it going to stay there? Did it stay
[1:19:20] sealed? No. Did it stay in the in his
[1:19:22] hand? No. It was going to have to
[1:19:25] progress. Yeah,
[1:19:26] that book was going to go have to go
[1:19:28] from being closed to not just being open
[1:19:30] and going, "Thank God we got the open
[1:19:32] book."
[1:19:33] But now God, the angel says, "Now John,
[1:19:35] take the book." John says, "Give me the
[1:19:38] angel says take it
[1:19:40] and eat it.
[1:19:42] Consume it.
[1:19:43] FOR YOU MUST PROPHESY AGAIN." WHAT WAS
[1:19:46] IT? IT WAS SOMETHING FURTHER. IT WAS GOD
[1:19:49] UM FURTHER UNVEILING HIMSELF, FURTHER
[1:19:51] RELEASING HIMSELF, FURTHER UNVEILING
[1:19:53] HIMSELF TO HIS FAMILY. HE WASN'T DONE AT
[1:19:56] CALVARY. He wasn't done in a manger. He
[1:19:58] wasn't done when HE WAS CRUCIFIED. I'LL
[1:20:00] GO FURTHER AND SAY he wasn't done when
[1:20:02] he sent his spirit on the day of
[1:20:03] Pentecost in AD.33. THERE WAS MORE GOD
[1:20:07] wanted to do.
[1:20:11] And it and it required someone to step
[1:20:14] out and say, "I'm not going to settle
[1:20:17] with what I've received, but I want
[1:20:19] more.
[1:20:21] I want more." You say, "Brother Matt, is
[1:20:24] there more of God?" There certainly is.
[1:20:27] Amen.
[1:20:27] I want you to notice this here. We took
[1:20:29] this into Sunday school. I'm just going
[1:20:30] to It's 12:30 now. Can I have 10 12 more
[1:20:34] minutes? I'll make it 12.
[1:20:38] And then I'll ask for 12 more. No, I'm
[1:20:40] just kidding.
[1:20:41] No, I actually might, but we'll see.
[1:20:44] I want you to notice this here. We took
[1:20:45] this into Sunday school. This was after
[1:20:48] the spirit of God is poured out on the
[1:20:50] day of Pentecost. after they've received
[1:20:52] the the the gift of the Holy Ghost,
[1:20:54] after they're endued with power. WHAT DO
[1:20:56] YOU HAVE AFTER the Holy Ghost comes? You
[1:20:59] don't just have a people that's gathered
[1:21:00] up in buildings and synagogues opening
[1:21:02] the scroll and just studying the word
[1:21:04] and then the next they just study the
[1:21:05] word and then they study the word and
[1:21:06] then they read. Listen, study is good of
[1:21:08] the word, but there's got to be a
[1:21:10] manifestation of what you're studying.
[1:21:12] So, what do you have in the book of Acts
[1:21:14] church? You have a PEOPLE THAT WAS
[1:21:16] MOVING ON, THAT WAS PROGRESSING, THAT
[1:21:19] WAS OPEN TO MORE OF GOD. SO WHAT DID GOD
[1:21:21] DO? He sent power. He sent
[1:21:23] demonstration. He sent miracles. He
[1:21:25] spent He sent signs. He sent wonders TO
[1:21:28] A BODY. NOT JUST A WORD, not just an
[1:21:32] intellect, not just something you study.
[1:21:34] He sent himself back to the church.
[1:21:38] Amen.
[1:21:39] And when he unveiled himself, he was
[1:21:41] giving everything that he was.
[1:21:44] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:21:46] Well, then surely, you know, brother
[1:21:47] Matt, after after the, you know, the
[1:21:49] death of the last apostle and, you know,
[1:21:51] at some point there's got to be an
[1:21:53] ending to this. At some point, it's got
[1:21:55] to be a completion to all of this. At
[1:21:56] some point, surely God had, you know,
[1:21:59] everything he accomplished, he he was
[1:22:00] certainly done. When Paul died, you
[1:22:03] know, when the last last apostle died,
[1:22:05] when John died, surely God was done. And
[1:22:09] then what they were to do, what the
[1:22:11] disciples, what all of the early church
[1:22:12] was to do was just to go backwards and
[1:22:15] go refer to everything Jesus said, refer
[1:22:17] to everything the that the apostles
[1:22:19] said, refer to everything that they have
[1:22:21] and and and just seal it up, close it
[1:22:23] up, stop it up, and say, "We've received
[1:22:26] it all. Now we just wait."
[1:22:29] Well, let's read if that's what they
[1:22:31] that's what they did. This is this is
[1:22:34] this is after the death of the last
[1:22:36] apostle. This is between AD55
[1:22:40] and AD 160. This is Justin Martyr. This
[1:22:43] is right out of history. You don't have
[1:22:45] to you I didn't you you can go and
[1:22:46] Google this up for yourself if you want.
[1:22:48] Don't do it while you're in church, but
[1:22:49] you can do it after church.
[1:22:52] Justin Martyr AD 5155.
[1:22:55] FOR THE PROPHETICAL GIFTS remain with us
[1:23:00] even to the present time.
[1:23:02] Amen.
[1:23:05] Wait a minute. You mean the prophetical
[1:23:06] gifts didn't stop with John?
[1:23:09] You mean the You mean God wasn't done
[1:23:11] prophesying, speaking,
[1:23:13] moving, acting, revealing, unveiling?
[1:23:18] AMEN.
[1:23:19] HERE'S JUSTIN MARTYR 8155. THE prophetic
[1:23:22] grips are still in operation. Here's
[1:23:24] Irenus 8180. I want to just read this
[1:23:27] and it's small, but you read it with me.
[1:23:29] Those who are in his truth, his
[1:23:31] disciples receiving grace from him do in
[1:23:34] his name, read this with me, perform
[1:23:38] miracles.
[1:23:39] Amen.
[1:23:41] We read that wrong. Surely Ireneius said
[1:23:44] those who were in the B, those uh the
[1:23:46] last apostles and Paul, they performed
[1:23:48] miracles. No, no. Those disciples
[1:23:50] receiving grace from him doing in his
[1:23:51] name perform miracles
[1:23:53] so as to promote the welfare of other
[1:23:56] men according to the gift which each one
[1:23:58] has received from him. For some do
[1:24:01] certainly and TRULY DRIVE OUT DEVILS.
[1:24:06] AMEN.
[1:24:07] YOU MEAN ALL THE DEVIL DRIVING OUT
[1:24:08] DIDN'T STOP with the apostles?
[1:24:12] No, it didn't stop. We still need devils
[1:24:14] driven out today.
[1:24:17] Amen.
[1:24:18] Hello Yes.
[1:24:20] So that those who have been thus
[1:24:21] cleansed from evil spirits frequently
[1:24:23] both believe in Christ and join
[1:24:26] themselves to the church. Others have
[1:24:28] fornowledge of things to come.
[1:24:30] Amen.
[1:24:31] WHO'S HE TESTIFYING ABOUT?
[1:24:34] HIS CHURCH.
[1:24:35] AMEN.
[1:24:36] These are believers.
[1:24:39] OTHERS HAVE [screaming] FORNOWLEDGE.
[1:24:40] NOTICE THIS. OF THINGS TO COME. THEY see
[1:24:44] visions.
[1:24:45] Amen. Brother Matt, you still believe we
[1:24:48] can see visions? Well, if you believe
[1:24:50] the Bible, you believe there's still
[1:24:51] visions.
[1:24:52] In fact, the prophecy of Joel was that
[1:24:54] your young men, your old men will young
[1:24:57] men will see visions and your old men
[1:24:58] will dream dreams.
[1:25:01] Is that the word?
[1:25:03] Notice here, see visions AND UTTER
[1:25:05] PROPHETIC EXPRESSIONS. OTHERS STILL,
[1:25:09] you would think that Irene was writing
[1:25:11] this because he knew there'd be gains
[1:25:13] coming down the road. And so he wrote it
[1:25:15] just to make sure you understood. If you
[1:25:17] can get a picture, if you could go back
[1:25:19] in a time machine and you were to go
[1:25:20] back to that f first early church and
[1:25:22] say, "What do they look like? What did
[1:25:23] they believe? What what what did they
[1:25:25] practice? What did church look like for
[1:25:27] them? What did the church look like for
[1:25:28] Ireneius?" Well, we're reading about it
[1:25:30] here. There were people WITH VISIONS,
[1:25:32] MIRACLES, DRIVING OUT DEVILS, PROPHETIC
[1:25:34] EXPRESSIONS. Others still heal the sick
[1:25:38] by laying their hands upon them, and
[1:25:40] they are made whole.
[1:25:43] Amen.
[1:25:44] Yay. Moreover, as I have said, the dead
[1:25:47] even have been raised up and remained
[1:25:51] among us for many
[1:25:54] years.
[1:25:58] And shall I more say? Yes, please do,
[1:26:00] brother. Is it not possible? It is not
[1:26:03] possible to name the number of gifts
[1:26:06] which the church scattered through the
[1:26:09] whole world has received from God in the
[1:26:11] name of Jesus Christ who was crucified
[1:26:13] under Pontis Pilate and which she exerts
[1:26:17] day by day for the benefit of the
[1:26:19] Gentiles. Neither practicing deception
[1:26:21] upon any nor taking any reward from them
[1:26:24] on account of such miraculous
[1:26:26] interpositions. For as she has received
[1:26:29] freely from God, freely also does she
[1:26:33] minister to others.
[1:26:35] Amen.
[1:26:35] For this reason does the apostle
[1:26:37] declare, "We speak wisdom among them
[1:26:40] that are perfect." Preach, brother
[1:26:42] Irene.
[1:26:43] NOW HE'S QUOTING PAUL. THIS IS THE
[1:26:45] REASON
[1:26:46] THAT PAUL SAID, "WE speak wisdom among
[1:26:48] them that ARE PERFECT." TERMING THOSE
[1:26:50] PERSONS PERFECT who have received THE
[1:26:52] SPIRIT OF GOD AND WHO THROUGH THE SPIRIT
[1:26:54] OF GOD DO speak in all languages as he
[1:26:58] used himself also to speak and like
[1:27:01] manner we do also hear many brethren in
[1:27:04] the church who possess prophetic gifts
[1:27:07] and who through the spirit speak all
[1:27:09] kinds of languages and bring to light
[1:27:12] for the gen general benefit of the
[1:27:14] hidden things of men and declare the
[1:27:15] mysteries of God whom also the apostles
[1:27:17] term spiritual they being spiritual
[1:27:19] because they partake of the spirit.
[1:27:24] Amen.
[1:27:25] They don't just partake of the written
[1:27:28] word.
[1:27:30] They partake of the spirit.
[1:27:32] I know some of you are asleep. Pinch
[1:27:34] yourself here just for a moment.
[1:27:37] THEY DON'T JUST READ. THEY DON'T JUST
[1:27:40] HEAR.
[1:27:41] They do.
[1:27:43] Oh, I just say, GOD, DON'T JUST LET ME
[1:27:45] BE A HEARER. Let me be a doer of the
[1:27:48] word.
[1:27:49] I want to partake.
[1:27:54] I want to partake. I don't just want to
[1:27:57] stop and hear and listen. It's
[1:27:58] wonderful. But I want to partake of that
[1:28:01] living, breathing spirit
[1:28:03] that wants to move worse than I want him
[1:28:06] to move.
[1:28:07] That wants to speak more than I want him
[1:28:09] to use my vessel to speak.
[1:28:13] Notice this is tiring.
[1:28:16] I got got a few of these. Just read
[1:28:18] along with me. Let Marcy on exhibit this
[1:28:20] is 8208. What are we doing? We're moving
[1:28:22] just a little bit further.
[1:28:24] Surely after I brother Matt had to stop
[1:28:26] then. Well, let's keep going. Let Marcy
[1:28:28] and exhibit gifts as as gifts of his
[1:28:30] God. Some prophets, some as such have
[1:28:33] not spoken by human sense, but with the
[1:28:36] spirit of God, such as hath both
[1:28:39] predicted things to come, and have made
[1:28:42] manifest the secrets of the heart. Let
[1:28:45] him produce a psalm, a vision, a prayer.
[1:28:48] Do you know what Turion's doing? He's
[1:28:51] mocking Marcion, who was declaring that
[1:28:56] Jesus, EVERYTHING JESUS WANTED TO SAY,
[1:28:58] he said. Everything he wanted to do, he
[1:29:00] did. There's no more gifts. There's no
[1:29:02] more signs. There's no more wonders.
[1:29:05] There's nothing ELSE MORE TO GIVE. AND
[1:29:07] AND WE are the true church. You know
[1:29:08] what? You know what uh Tertian does? He
[1:29:10] says, "Okay, if you're the true church,
[1:29:12] if you're the true church like you say
[1:29:14] you are, then produce a vision.
[1:29:16] Produce a prophecy. GO AHEAD. LET HIM
[1:29:19] produce a psalm. Only let it be by the
[1:29:21] spirit and an ecstasy that is in rapture
[1:29:23] whenever an interpretations
[1:29:25] interpretation of tongues has occurred
[1:29:27] to him. Let him show to me also that any
[1:29:29] woman of boastful tongue in his
[1:29:31] community has ever prophesied from among
[1:29:33] those specially holy sisters of his."
[1:29:35] He's being VERY SARCASTIC HERE. NOW ALL
[1:29:38] THESE THINGS OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS, ALL OF
[1:29:41] THESE THINGS THAT I'M ASKING YOU TO
[1:29:43] produce are forthcoming from my side
[1:29:47] without any difficulty. [laughter]
[1:29:50] Right?
[1:29:51] Would you have the boldness to say that?
[1:29:53] Wow.
[1:29:54] And they agree too with the rules and
[1:29:57] the dispensations and the instructions
[1:29:59] of the creator. Therefore, without
[1:30:00] doubt, the Christ and the spirit and the
[1:30:03] apostle belong severally to my God.
[1:30:06] Here's origin of Alex Alexandria. We
[1:30:08] have to say this is AD 248. Let's go a
[1:30:11] little bit further away from the Bible
[1:30:13] times. Let's go A LITTLE BIT DOWN THE
[1:30:15] ROAD. We have more. We have to say
[1:30:18] moreover that the gospel has
[1:30:20] demonstration of its own. I believe that
[1:30:22] you don't need to fabricate it. You
[1:30:24] don't need to manufacture it. The gospel
[1:30:26] HAS DEMONSTRATION OF ITS OWN. All you
[1:30:28] got to do is believe it, preach it, live
[1:30:30] it. God will manifest himself.
[1:30:33] It has a demonstration of its own more
[1:30:36] divine than any est than than any
[1:30:38] established by Grecian dialects. And
[1:30:40] this diver method is called by the
[1:30:42] apostle the manifestation of the spirit
[1:30:45] and of power of the spirit on account of
[1:30:48] the prophecies which are sufficient to
[1:30:50] produce faith. and anyone who reads
[1:30:52] them, especially in those things which
[1:30:54] relate to Christ AND OF POWER, BECAUSE
[1:30:56] of the signs and wonders which we must
[1:30:58] believe to have been performed both on
[1:31:01] many other grounds and on this that
[1:31:04] traces of them are still preserved among
[1:31:08] those who regulate their lives by the
[1:31:11] precepts of precepts of the gospel.
[1:31:15] They are still preserved among those who
[1:31:18] regulate their lives by the precepts of
[1:31:21] the gospel. And there are still
[1:31:24] preserved among Christians traces of
[1:31:27] that holy spirit dove. They expel evil
[1:31:30] spirits and perform many cures and
[1:31:33] foresee certain events according to the
[1:31:36] will of the logos.
[1:31:38] Amen.
[1:31:39] And in the name of Jesus, they didn't
[1:31:42] change that name. Hallelujah.
[1:31:45] Didn't come as some other man, some
[1:31:47] other messenger, some other person, but
[1:31:48] in the name of Jesus.
[1:31:51] You see, as long as you got the name of
[1:31:52] Jesus, you still got the same Holy
[1:31:54] Ghost.
[1:31:55] If you got the same Holy Ghost, you got
[1:31:57] the same power. Brother Brandham said,
[1:31:59] "If God ever did anything in the word
[1:32:01] and you find it written in the word and
[1:32:03] you meet him on the same basis of faith,
[1:32:05] he'll have to do the same thing he did
[1:32:07] for them." He's no respector of persons.
[1:32:10] IF YOU NEED HEALING, YOU MEET GOD ON THE
[1:32:12] SAME BASIS OF FAITH. And God's required
[1:32:15] to do it for you, too.
[1:32:17] And he says THEY EXPEL DEMONS, TAKE AWAY
[1:32:20] DISEASES, produce marvelous meekness of
[1:32:23] spirit.
[1:32:27] WHAT?
[1:32:28] WHERE DID THAT come from? That was a
[1:32:30] curveball out of left field. We're
[1:32:32] talking about casting out demons and
[1:32:33] healing PEOPLE AND HAVING PROPHECIES AND
[1:32:35] VISIONS and meekness of spirit.
[1:32:39] Amen. Amen.
[1:32:43] And complete I love that complete change
[1:32:46] of character.
[1:32:48] Amen.
[1:32:49] And a humanity and goodness and
[1:32:52] gentleness. And those individuals who do
[1:32:54] fain themselves to be Christian. And
[1:32:57] some evid some give evidence of their
[1:33:00] having received through this faith a
[1:33:02] marvelous power by the cures which they
[1:33:04] performed revoking no other name over
[1:33:07] those who need their help than that of
[1:33:08] the God of all things and of Jesus along
[1:33:11] with the mention of his history. For by
[1:33:14] these means we too have seen many
[1:33:16] persons freed from grievous calamities
[1:33:19] and from distractions. Did Jesus stop
[1:33:22] setting people free at the death of the
[1:33:25] last apostle? I SAY, "NO, THERE'S STILL
[1:33:28] FREEDOM IN CHRIST JESUS. THERE'S STILL
[1:33:30] FREEDOM FROM DEPRESSION." I SAID,
[1:33:32] "THERE'S STILL FREEDOM FROM ADDICTIONS.
[1:33:35] THERE'S STILL FREEDOM IN JESUS."
[1:33:38] You don't have to be bound. There's
[1:33:40] freedom.
[1:33:42] Freed from grievous calamities and from
[1:33:44] distractions of mind. There's a lot of
[1:33:46] distractions. Boy, we got them. We got
[1:33:48] We got distractions everywhere.
[1:33:50] Distractions and notifications and push
[1:33:52] notifications. See, people can't even
[1:33:54] sit in church anymore without being on
[1:33:55] their phone. I watch people almost all
[1:33:57] service just texting away, try typing
[1:33:59] away. Don't you realize that's a spirit
[1:34:02] of the devil trying to keep you, NOT
[1:34:04] FROM BROTHER MATT. HE'S TRYING TO keep
[1:34:06] you from the Holy Spirit to give you the
[1:34:08] answer you need.
[1:34:10] OH FRIENDS, WE OUGHT TO SHAKE OURSEL
[1:34:12] TODAY AND SAY, "GOD, I WANT MORE. I
[1:34:14] DON'T WANT TO STOP. I DON'T WANT TO BE
[1:34:16] DISTRACTED. I DON'T WANT TO BE UH
[1:34:18] CONFUSED. I want to be clear of mine. I
[1:34:21] want to be available and ready when you
[1:34:23] go to speak to me, Lord.
[1:34:26] So the same God who delivered from
[1:34:27] distractions in that day, we believe in
[1:34:30] the same God today.
[1:34:32] Hallelujah.
[1:34:34] AMEN.
[1:34:35] DISTRACTIONS OF MIND and madness. Boy,
[1:34:38] they had it then. Boy, do we have it
[1:34:40] now.
[1:34:41] And countless other ills which could be
[1:34:45] cured neither by men nor devils.
[1:34:49] God desired to commend. I love this. God
[1:34:52] desired to commend the doctrine of Jesus
[1:34:55] as a doctrine which was to save mankind.
[1:34:59] And let me say when Jesus saves from
[1:35:02] one, he saves from all.
[1:35:05] You need saved today not just of your
[1:35:07] soul, you need saved of yourself, your
[1:35:09] mind, your evil, your your corruption.
[1:35:11] And when Jesus saves, he saves all.
[1:35:14] Amen.
[1:35:15] As a doctrine which was to save mankind,
[1:35:17] which was based indeed upon the apostles
[1:35:19] as foundations of the rising edifice of
[1:35:22] Christianity, but which increased in
[1:35:25] magnitude also in the succeeding ages.
[1:35:30] My brothers and sisters, if a man in 248
[1:35:34] a believed that God was going to
[1:35:37] increase in magnitude, then we ought we
[1:35:41] surely OUGHT NOT TO STOP HIM NOW. WE
[1:35:43] OUGHT TO SAY, "GOD, INCREASE IN
[1:35:45] MAGNITUDE, increase in power, increase
[1:35:48] in love, increase in hope, increase in
[1:35:51] meekness, INCREASE IN GIFTS, INCREASE IN
[1:35:54] SIGNS." LORD,
[1:35:58] the increase in magnitude also in the
[1:36:00] succeeding ages in which not a few cures
[1:36:03] are wrought in the name of Jesus and
[1:36:05] certain other manifestations of no small
[1:36:07] moment have taken place. I got a few
[1:36:11] more. Martin. I you realize I'm reading
[1:36:13] you not just not just these men of
[1:36:15] history. These are church age
[1:36:16] messengers.
[1:36:18] He read Ireneius. Here's Martin of Tors.
[1:36:21] Notice this here. Three times the dead
[1:36:24] were raised in Martin's ministry.
[1:36:26] Wow.
[1:36:28] Three times.
[1:36:29] Amen.
[1:36:29] You mean Jesus didn't wasn't the only
[1:36:32] one who raised the dead? No.
[1:36:34] Paul raised the dead. His disciples the
[1:36:36] apostles raised the dead. and his church
[1:36:39] after him still had the power to raise
[1:36:41] the dead.
[1:36:43] Amen.
[1:36:45] Surely that had to stop. Well, we read
[1:36:46] about it here. It didn't stop.
[1:36:49] THREE TIMES WHILE ST. MARTIN WAS
[1:36:51] TRAVELING AWAY TRAVELING for three days.
[1:36:55] THE UNBAPTIZED CATECHUMAN CAME DOWN with
[1:36:58] a high fever and died. His body lay
[1:37:01] lifeless in one of the cells awaiting
[1:37:04] burial. Martin stretched himself at full
[1:37:07] length on the dead limbs of his departed
[1:37:10] brother. After he had stayed lying there
[1:37:13] sometime in prayer, he and had become
[1:37:16] aware through the spirit that the power
[1:37:18] of God was present, he rose up for a
[1:37:21] short time and fixing his gaze on the
[1:37:24] dead man's face. He waited with
[1:37:25] confidence for the result of his prayer
[1:37:28] and the mercy of the Lord. And after
[1:37:30] scarcely two hours had passed, he saw
[1:37:34] the dead man begin to move, all his
[1:37:36] limbs little by little, and his eyes
[1:37:38] trembling and blinking as he recovered
[1:37:41] sight.
[1:37:42] GALLELUJAH.
[1:37:45] YOU SAY, "WHAT KIND OF GOD IS THAT?"
[1:37:47] THAT'S THE GOD YOU'VE GOT ACCESS TO
[1:37:49] TODAY. THAT'S THE GOD THAT'S BEEN
[1:37:51] RESTORED TO THIS PEOPLE THAT'S IN THIS
[1:37:53] CHURCH RIGHT NOW.
[1:37:54] OH, FRIENDS, do you believe IT THIS
[1:37:56] MORNING? THIS IS THE KIND OF GOD WE
[1:37:58] SERVE. AMEN.
[1:38:00] There's more. There's always more.
[1:38:03] Amen.
[1:38:03] St. Columba. Okay, let's go to another
[1:38:05] messenger. Columba is remembered as a
[1:38:08] missionary and a miracle worker. Below
[1:38:11] is just an excerpt of miracles in his
[1:38:14] life. Brother Matt, where are you
[1:38:15] getting these things? The BBC.
[1:38:21] There there's my citation for my source.
[1:38:23] Oh, you must have found this somewhere.
[1:38:25] You know, some old crazy quack wrote
[1:38:26] this. No, this is the BBC.
[1:38:29] This is history.
[1:38:31] Wherever Columba went, he shared his
[1:38:33] mystical insights and spiritual visions,
[1:38:36] introduced the good news of the gospel
[1:38:38] to pagans and offered pastoral
[1:38:39] counseling. According to Adaman, he
[1:38:42] performed miracles too, healing the
[1:38:45] sick, killing a boar of amazing size
[1:38:49] merely com by COMMANDING IT TO DIE WHERE
[1:38:52] YOU ARE. [laughter]
[1:38:57] You imagine this is right out of the
[1:38:58] BBC.
[1:39:00] COLUMBA TELLS A BOORE DIE WHERE YOU ARE.
[1:39:06] You see it doesn't take any magical
[1:39:07] hocus pocus phrase and they got to come
[1:39:09] up with this special prayer. Man, he was
[1:39:11] just as plain and straight just as he
[1:39:13] could be. As simple as HE CAN BE. DIE
[1:39:16] WHERE YOU ARE DRAWING WATER FROM a
[1:39:20] stone.
[1:39:22] This is Cola.
[1:39:23] Amen.
[1:39:24] DID COLUMBA BELIEVE IN MIRACLES?
[1:39:27] DRAWING WATER FROM A STONE, TUSTLING
[1:39:29] successfully with pagan wizards. ONCE
[1:39:32] THE SAINT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A BRIGHT
[1:39:35] column of fiery light,
[1:39:39] like the pillar of fire.
[1:39:42] Hold on a minute. You mean another
[1:39:44] church age messenger had a column of
[1:39:48] light like the pillar of fire
[1:39:50] appear over his ministry?
[1:39:52] Wow.
[1:39:53] You know what that was doing when that
[1:39:55] pillar of fire appeared over the
[1:39:56] prophet's head? It was signifying this
[1:39:58] ain't his message. This is my message.
[1:40:02] These are not his words. These are my
[1:40:04] words.
[1:40:05] Amen.
[1:40:06] YOU SAY, "WHAT DID THAT PILLAR OF FIRE
[1:40:07] DO?" IT VINDICATED AND BACKED UP WHAT HE
[1:40:10] HAD TO SAY.
[1:40:12] ACCOMPANIED BY A BRIGHT COLUMN OF FIERY
[1:40:15] LIGHT LIKE THE PILLAR OF FIRE that
[1:40:16] preceded the Israelites in the book of
[1:40:18] Exodus. And if that wasn't protection
[1:40:20] enough, he could call upon the support
[1:40:22] of holy angels.
[1:40:25] Go a little bit further. Cyro of
[1:40:26] Jerusalem. We just read AD. This is that
[1:40:28] was AD 606. Let's go a little bit
[1:40:30] closer. AD350. Notice this here. AND
[1:40:32] THOUGH HE'S ONE IN NATURE, yet many are
[1:40:34] the virtues by which the will of God in
[1:40:36] the name of Christ. I had this out of
[1:40:38] order, but that's all right. For he
[1:40:39] employs the tongue of one man for
[1:40:41] wisdom, the soul of another he
[1:40:43] enlightens by prophecy. To another he
[1:40:44] gives power to drive away devils. to
[1:40:47] another he gives to interpret THE DIVINE
[1:40:49] SCRIPTURES. HERE'S Austinine of Hippo.
[1:40:53] In his book, CITY OF GOD, AUGUSTINE
[1:40:55] dedicates an entire chapter to the
[1:40:57] continuation
[1:40:59] of miracles. indignant at the suggestion
[1:41:02] that they ceased with the apostles. He
[1:41:05] claimed to have witnessed a number
[1:41:06] himself and list an extraordinary range
[1:41:09] of healings from blindness, rectal
[1:41:11] vestula, breast cancer, gout, paralysis,
[1:41:14] hernia, demonization, and even death.
[1:41:17] Amen.
[1:41:19] Say, brother Matt, what does that mean?
[1:41:21] It means God wanted to give more
[1:41:25] and more and more.
[1:41:28] Brother Brandon would say it this way.
[1:41:29] baptism after baptism after baptism
[1:41:32] after baptism. Pouring out after pouring
[1:41:36] out after pouring out, refilling after
[1:41:38] refilling after refilling.
[1:41:43] You say, "Brother Matt, what does that
[1:41:44] mean?" That means we have the witness.
[1:41:47] We have the witness of Justin, Ireanius,
[1:41:51] Tertion, Origin. I didn't even read some
[1:41:53] of these. Espicius. This is men that I
[1:41:55] didn't even I didn't even put what what
[1:41:56] I didn't have time. Basil, Syral of
[1:41:59] Augustine. We have a massive spread
[1:42:02] chronologically from the mid 2nd century
[1:42:04] to the early fifth century that shows a
[1:42:07] charismatic church of visions, tongues,
[1:42:11] interpretation of tongues, healings,
[1:42:14] miracles, and geographically all the way
[1:42:17] from the far east to the far west of the
[1:42:20] empire and north and south of the
[1:42:22] Mediterranean.
[1:42:24] Brother Random says in the Sardisian
[1:42:26] church age now Paul had baptized in
[1:42:28] Jesus' name and rebaptized where people
[1:42:31] had not been so immersed. He set the
[1:42:33] church in order and taught the proper
[1:42:35] use of the gifts of the spirit and
[1:42:37] confirmed that they were to remain in
[1:42:40] the church till Jesus came.
[1:42:43] How many accept the words of God's
[1:42:45] vindicated prophet?
[1:42:46] Now this is your messenger speaking
[1:42:49] that they were to remain in the church
[1:42:51] until Jesus came. Thus the next
[1:42:54] messengers, all the remaining six would
[1:42:57] be by the would by the same Holy Ghost
[1:43:00] burn with the same fire and give the
[1:43:02] same light of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:43:05] and the signs would follow them.
[1:43:10] Amen.
[1:43:11] Amen.
[1:43:13] Did I Did Irenas qualify?
[1:43:16] Yes. Did Martin? Yes. Say it with him.
[1:43:21] Did Columba Amen.
[1:43:23] DID WESLEY?
[1:43:24] Oh yes.
[1:43:25] He had a great ministry. Even prayed for
[1:43:27] his horse to get well. And it did. There
[1:43:29] you are. Seven church ages and seven
[1:43:33] messengers who were alike. And Paul
[1:43:36] pronounced a curse on anyone who said he
[1:43:38] was a messenger but had a different
[1:43:40] gospel and lived in a different light.
[1:43:46] God was not done.
[1:43:49] Amen. When he sent Jesus,
[1:43:53] God was not done when he sent the Holy
[1:43:56] Ghost. Let me propose to you, God was
[1:43:58] not done when he sent brother Brandham
[1:44:00] in a message.
[1:44:02] He's still working.
[1:44:04] He's still moving.
[1:44:06] He still wants to speak. And I just want
[1:44:07] to raise my hands. How many could stand
[1:44:09] to their feet, raise their hand, and
[1:44:11] say, "Lord, if there's more, I want to
[1:44:14] raise a hand today and say, I want
[1:44:18] more."
[1:44:20] Lord, you see the hands that are up all
[1:44:21] over this building. I raise both of mine
[1:44:24] up right now. Lord Jesus, we read about
[1:44:26] it. Father, a church moving, a church
[1:44:30] operating, a church acting. Lord, they
[1:44:32] weren't just stagnant and stale, but it
[1:44:36] was a dynamic church.
[1:44:38] Lord, the witness that we have is from
[1:44:40] every age, every man, Lord, that would
[1:44:43] believe and preach the same gospel. Your
[1:44:45] prophet said, would get the same result.
[1:44:48] So today Lord, we stand upon the same
[1:44:51] faith. We stand upon the same promise
[1:44:54] and we say, "Lord, whatsoever we raise
[1:44:56] hands now. We represent our needs that
[1:44:58] we have. Maybe the needs of somebody
[1:45:00] else in this body, in this church, maybe
[1:45:02] somewhere in another state. I represent
[1:45:04] those needs by an uplifted hand. And I
[1:45:06] say, "Oh God, you're the same miracle
[1:45:09] worker today. You're a light in the
[1:45:11] darkness. You heal the sick. You even
[1:45:13] raise the dead, oh God. And if my loved
[1:45:15] ones are dead in sins and trespasses, I
[1:45:18] believe in a God who raises the dead.
[1:45:20] They might be at home, not even here in
[1:45:22] this church today, but don't you ever
[1:45:24] let the devil get tell you that God is
[1:45:26] done moving. I want to preach to you
[1:45:28] today, and I want to tell you and
[1:45:30] encourage you, God's not done. He'll
[1:45:32] never stop. He'll never be done. He'll
[1:45:34] continue to move so long as you give him
[1:45:37] a a freeway for him to walk down.
[1:45:40] Hallelujah. I want to say, Lord, I lift
[1:45:42] my hands up and I say, God, I give you
[1:45:44] access. I give you passage. I give you
[1:45:47] the right of way, Holy Spirit.
[1:45:50] There's more.
[1:45:52] Amen.
[1:45:53] And I want more.
[1:45:55] There's more of God.
[1:45:58] Oh, and I want more of God. I know it's
[1:46:03] a simple sermon, every head bowed, every
[1:46:06] eye closed. Wonder if there'd be a hand
[1:46:08] that would just go up and simple faith
[1:46:10] would just say that
[1:46:12] I want more of God.
[1:46:18] I want more.
[1:46:23] I believe that if I want more,
[1:46:26] there is more.
[1:46:35] I want more, [music] Lord.
[1:46:39] Yes, Jesus.
[1:46:46] Yes, Lord.
[1:46:53] I love how Brother Brandham says this.
[1:46:54] Every head doubt ever I close. I'm just
[1:46:56] going to read you something. Felt led.
[1:46:58] The Lord has put it upon my heart.
[1:47:00] Brother Brandham's speaking about this
[1:47:02] even when he's talking about the gift of
[1:47:04] tongues. And he says, "Now, let me just
[1:47:06] not get away from that now because I
[1:47:08] don't want to dishonor a great gift that
[1:47:10] God has given. I believe that a
[1:47:11] spiritfilled man or woman or a child
[1:47:13] that lives under the altar of God won't
[1:47:15] live there long until they'll be
[1:47:17] speaking with tongues. I believe he'll
[1:47:18] do it." Now, you can receive the Holy
[1:47:20] Ghost and maybe you didn't speak with
[1:47:22] tongues when you get it. But if you
[1:47:24] constantly lay before God all the time
[1:47:26] with baptism after baptism. Oh, I just
[1:47:30] want to stop right there and raise my
[1:47:31] hand and say, "Lord, give me baptism
[1:47:34] after baptism. I might have had it
[1:47:36] yesterday, but I need it again today."
[1:47:38] Lord, my family might have had a real
[1:47:40] revival breakout, but oh, we need it
[1:47:42] once more. Lord Jesus, I'm not going to
[1:47:44] settle for what you did yesterday. I
[1:47:46] could stand here all afternoon and
[1:47:48] testify about God who moved yesterday.
[1:47:50] But I want to say, God, I want a baptism
[1:47:53] of after baptism striking my heart. And
[1:47:57] he says, if you get baptism after
[1:47:59] baptism striking you, something's going
[1:48:00] to take place. You'll get so full
[1:48:03] someday till you can't talk nothing
[1:48:04] else. You try to say something, you
[1:48:06] can't say it no more, and you just can't
[1:48:08] say. Many times if people realized that
[1:48:10] there was the Holy Spirit, they'd go
[1:48:11] ahead and just open their heart up and
[1:48:13] let God speak to them.
[1:48:17] I want to ask you, brethren, have you
[1:48:19] ever felt the Holy Ghost shake you so
[1:48:21] bad till you just couldn't hardly say
[1:48:23] nothing? Would just sit quiet sometimes,
[1:48:25] just sit there and cry? Have you did
[1:48:28] that? Well, that's the Holy Ghost. The
[1:48:30] reason people don't speak with tongues
[1:48:32] many times, they don't know how to yield
[1:48:33] themselves to the spirit. They're
[1:48:35] looking for something way off when it's
[1:48:36] right on them. That's the reason they
[1:48:38] don't. Then sometimes people just gets
[1:48:40] theirel worked up in emotion and say a
[1:48:42] bunch of words has no meaning to it.
[1:48:43] Still ain't got the Holy Ghost to try to
[1:48:45] say that because they try to say that
[1:48:47] they have because they spoke in tongues.
[1:48:48] But by Jesus said by their fruits they
[1:48:51] shall know them. I just want to raise a
[1:48:53] hand and say Lord let me learn to yield
[1:48:56] myself to you. If it's to yield myself
[1:48:59] in love. If it's to yield myself in
[1:49:01] humility then let it be Lord. If it's to
[1:49:04] yield myself to speak in tongues, then
[1:49:06] let me yield myself, Lord. If it's to
[1:49:08] yield myself for a vision, Lord, for you
[1:49:11] to speak to me by a dream. I DON'T WANT
[1:49:13] TO CLOSE MYSELF OFF UP, JESUS. I want to
[1:49:16] open myself right now. If I've left you
[1:49:20] up in the past, God, I want to bring you
[1:49:21] out of the past. I want to bring you to
[1:49:23] present day right now. You're still
[1:49:25] Jehovah Gyra. You're still the need
[1:49:27] meter. We're still believers. We believe
[1:49:30] in your word, Lord. We accept your word
[1:49:32] that was spoken by a vindicated [music]
[1:49:34] prophet. We don't question it. We don't
[1:49:36] just accept some of it or else we'll
[1:49:38] lose all of it. We accept it all with
[1:49:41] open heart, with open minds. Lord, we
[1:49:44] accept it. Jesus,
[1:49:46] your spirit, Lord, I feel it even here
[1:49:48] this morning so badly wanting to press.
[1:49:51] Let us not restrict you, Lord. Let us
[1:49:54] not hinder you. Let us have a spirit
[1:49:56] that says have freedom. Oh, could this
[1:49:59] church just pray that and raise a hand
[1:50:01] and say, "Lord, I wanna I want to go
[1:50:03] ahead and show whose side I own, whose
[1:50:05] side I'm on." I want to raise a hand and
[1:50:07] say, "Let the Holy Spirit have freedom.
[1:50:10] Let it have freedom in this assembly.
[1:50:12] LET IT HAVE IT. FREEDOM IN MY HOME. I
[1:50:14] want to give you freedom in my mind,
[1:50:16] freedom in my body. I don't want to
[1:50:18] restrict you, Lord. Don't let any idea
[1:50:21] tradition of man get in the way and
[1:50:23] restrict your spirit from moving. We
[1:50:25] want to be open to the Holy Ghost. He's
[1:50:28] the Joshua. He's the leader of the
[1:50:31] church.
[1:50:33] And we yield oursel to him right now,
[1:50:35] Lord Jesus. We yield oursel to him.
[1:50:39] This is my
[1:50:41] desire
[1:50:45] to honor
[1:50:49] you.
[1:50:52] Lord, with all my heart [singing]
[1:50:57] I worship you.
[1:51:03] All I have [music] and all I have within
[1:51:09] me.

[1:53:55] praise.

[1:54:18] I live for you alone. [music] Every

[1:56:14] Lord, I [music] give you my heart self
[1:56:17] away.
[1:56:21] Self away.
[1:56:25] Oh God, [music and singing]
[1:56:28] I give myself away
[1:56:31] so you
[1:56:33] can use me. [music] I give myself
[1:56:36] [singing]
[1:56:37] away.
[1:56:43] [music and singing]
[1:56:46] So you can sing a [music] verse now.
[1:56:49] Take my life. Take my life.
[1:56:54] Take [music] my life
[1:56:58] as a living [music]
[1:57:01] [singing] sacrifice. Yes Lord. All my
[1:57:04] dreams. All my dreams.
[1:57:08] Oh my [singing and music]
[1:57:12] Lord, are I placed [music and singing]
[1:57:16] in your hand?
[1:57:19] I give [music] myself away.
[1:57:26] I give [music] myself away
[1:57:30] so you can use [music]
[1:57:33] me. I give us all I am.

[1:57:41] Lord, my life is in your
[1:57:46] [music and singing] hand.
[1:57:46] Can you say this?
[1:57:48] Lord, I'm longing.
[1:57:51] [music]
[1:57:53] Yes, Jesus. Your desires,
[1:57:55] your desires [singing]
[1:57:58] reveal [music]
[1:57:59] in me. I give I give myself away.
[1:58:03] [music]

[1:58:41] [music]
[1:58:42] my life. Oh my life is on my own.

[1:58:48] To you I belong. [music]
[1:58:51] I give myself I give myself to you.
[1:59:00] [music]
[1:59:02] I give myself away [music]
[1:59:06] so you can [singing] use me. I give
[1:59:10] myself [music] away.
[1:59:16] I give myself away [music] so you can
[1:59:21] use me. Here I am.
[1:59:26] Here I stand, [music]
[1:59:29] Lord. My life is in your hands,
[1:59:36] Lord. [music]
[1:59:37] I'm longing
[1:59:40] to see
[1:59:42] your [music] desires
[1:59:45] revealed in me. I give myself [music]
[1:59:50] away.
[1:59:54] I give myself [music] away so you can

[2:00:20] belong.
[2:00:22] I give myself I give myself to [music]
[2:00:25] you.
