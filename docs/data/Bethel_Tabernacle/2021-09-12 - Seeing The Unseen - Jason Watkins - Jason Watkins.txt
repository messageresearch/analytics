house of the lord today and we're going to look right to saint john chapter 3. we've got a number of prayer requests that i'm going to go to that's probably a little too much monitor for me brother matt um i'm going to take a number of prayer requests this morning and things that came in right as i was in the back and on the way just want to have some special prayer for them let's let's read our our scripture let me let me say before we read it because once i read it then i don't want to back out um as you can see we're underway with the painting and so i sent out a message today to please make sure you keep kids and anyone i actually i don't even want adults back there because if adults go back there teens will follow you and if teens go back there kids will follow them so there's there's debris nails screws things like that there's paint and i've had too many accidents on painting jobs where five gallons of paint gets turned over on concrete and it's a nightmare so just please avoid the back of the property you don't need to go back there and fact is we're not going to be able to open the fellowship hall this afternoon there's some there's some painting crew that i'm working with that i uh hired to come out and help me uh and jonathan on the painting they're working on the fellowship hall exclusively they may come here in the early afternoon so i told them i would keep it closed and the ground should probably be cleared somewhere around two o'clock depending on how long the preacher goes but so just make sure that you you don't go back there and please bear with us we're still working um this is still a work in progress um there's a one wall here painted you can't even look at this and tell it's what it's going to look like when it's finished so i know everybody in here is going to have an opinion because you're human beings please let me get it finished and i have a vision in my mind how it's going to look i know exactly what how i want it to look and i'm taking counsel from um from my wife my daughter-in-law and other different ones who are helping me to make some of these decisions but i have an exact vision how i want it to look and i'll get there amen hopefully by the will of the lord i'll be able to come this week and finish up this side the front and the back and so uh just uh be patient until we can get it all done and then when i have it finally finished then you can give me your opinion if it's a good one amen amen so uh we want to just um i just wanted to make those comments and uh oh i'm red i'm dead so get me some fresh batteries up here please and so um let's read from saint john chapter three i also want to give you a quick announcement we are a go for cherokee um as far as i can tell it's gonna unless we get a call saying they've revoked our reservation on that park pavilion then it's a go i'm just not gonna let the enemy i'm not uh you know to try to keep us to say well what if they start closing things down they they already are but i noticed when i was there there's a lot of good bit of fear up in that area and so uh we don't want to give way to them we're going to go i appreciate the number of clothing and articles that have come in from different ones of you and we'll be taking all of that up there with us as we've shown you before it's just going to be a nice time if you want to come along bring children along there's rivers to play it on both sides there's fishing you can fish them both we're going to have a nice time of fellowship and music and thanks sir and we will have whatever it's like books and things like that whatever the lord will open up to us anything uh we're just going to go and let the lord lead us in this all right that should be far and hold there all right so that that is that is the goal and we're we're gonna go forward with that and if they pull the plug on us at the last minute there's nothing i can do about that i'll try to let everybody know as quickly as i receive it st john chapter 3 i want to catch these first 21 verses so i'm just going to read a few and then we'll let you be seated and we'll continue with the we have that on the overhead please saint john 3 chap verses 1 through 21. there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews that came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest accept god be with him now i want to take up these prayer requests you just hold your place in your bible we'll finish reading after we pray and let you be seated sister paula taylor writes in the husband and the family i live with she's a nanny there has a final interview in chicago tomorrow that will determine for certain whether we can move back to the south we have been putting legs to our prayers and have already met with listing agents for the house please agree and pray with us that the house sells quickly at or above the asking price and that the lord will allow the right house to come on the market on the other end of georgia when we get there amen thank you so much he works remotely so they have an opportunity to live in georgia and that might afford our sister the opportunity to be here for some live services amen she's been streaming for a number of years now brother bruce paris has been running a fever over the last couple days and started praying for him uh and uh it came it was at 101 and came down to 99 but he's still very weak and the enemy just battling our brother amen brother bruce ain't 25 anymore i think he's above 80 and so we just want to be praying for him brother rodney has also been very sick for a week sister lois wrote to me last night to say he has his son contracted covet and now brother rodney has every symptom every classic coveted symptom he's had a terrible fever been sick for weeks she's going to take him to the hospital if he doesn't have a turnaround or if he gets worse so let's be praying for our dear brother uh sister brenda's dad um had an episode where his oxygen got down to like 78 i mean that's like really really low and they took him into the hospital they've got him on 15 liters of oxygen it is keeping his oxygen where it needed to be they gave him steroids last night i'm still waiting to hear from the doctors this morning regarding all the tests and blood work from last night sister abby smith is not feeling well today sister amber smith dropped a board on her foot oh my and uh and and i'm thinking to myself i want to say sister amber don't do that amen so she dropped a board on her foot poor sister and now she can't really walk around on it so brother anthony's there with his girls today brother micah brought the other two and so we're happy to have them here today um just keep them in prayer my niece and i hope is coming up for delivery soon we want her i'm just want to put her on the prayer request list for a normal delivery you know it should be a joyous time but the devil's always busy and he's uh he's been trying to scare her with some lying symptoms and i'd like to see him put in his place amen so if you'll join me in prayer for all of these things let's let's go to the lord father we're praying the for these requests this morning they were sent to me personally and lord updates all this morning

confess it with us brother bruce will be doing the exact same thing lord when we put it in the past tense father that by his stripes were already healed that's when god can respond lord for sister brenda's dad we're calling jesus on the scene for this man lord help from on high as you have lord our sister is worried about her dad and we're worried with her so we pray master for this man that you will bring him full of strength and energy lord he's a good man i've heard him sister brenda and i have talked about him at length at times and i pray for him lord that that as a believer lord his faith would just reach out to the promise and take a hold of it right now father for sister abby for sister amber lord we're asking your mercy today i pray that you'll recover them very quickly lord

completely with the normal healthy delivery father with no complications and may all all pretense of the enemy and all lies be put down by the saints of god we commit it to you in jesus name amen amen all right you can be seated friends we're going to continue reading verse 4. nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit marvel not that i said unto you you must be born again the wind bloweth whether where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but thou canst not tell whence it cometh and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be jesus answered and said unto him art thou a master in israel a teacher and know us not these things verily verily or truly truly i say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and ye receive not our witness if i have told you earthly things and you believe not how shall ye believe if i tell you of heavenly things and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven that's a mind-bender yeah amen that that blew all their minds all right this gets reported there there these kinds of stories get told and repeated publicly and this along with when you're going to hear brother branham deal with it in a minute where they heard him say things like this they heard that he had said this they heard him say except you eat my flesh and drink my blood and all of these things you know he didn't he didn't fully explain everything all the time all right and so people had uh had to overcome a lot of these five senses to believe by the sixth sense and i'm here today friends you're in a challenging hour where you're going to have to you're going to have to unsee to see some things all right so you're going to have to ignore a lot of times what these eyes see in these ears here and these senses feel you know or or or what your mind or your emotions tell you and you're going to have to look beyond it to something more real and that's a promise of god a promise of god is more tangible than what you see a promise of god is more tangible than the earth you stand on because the earth you stand on is just a shadow it's just a negative image of a more positive now that's hard for us to get around because we we walk around on the terra firma you know i this is real man i can feel this is solid this is a shadow amen see what's in that realm is more more real you say well how can that be because it was before this realm it was original it was first you understand and so even god's thoughts thank you for the bread even god's thoughts are more real his thoughts are more real than your existence amen all right so now so now when we when we look at these things we're we're seeing how that he says here verse 15. all right let's go back to i'm sorry uh verse verse 13 again and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven that's a head scratcher because how's he in heaven but he's standing in front of me all right and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life it doesn't mean that everybody's going to not perish and have everlasting life it means that whosoever believeth in him and it doesn't mean this this verse isn't telling you that anyone will it's not telling you who will or even that anyone will it's just saying whosoever will whoever does believe will be have everlasting life you say well then the next obvious question is who's going to believe well the bible answers that in acts 13 them that were ordained believed all right so you're not going to get around the sovereignty of god no matter what you do you're not going to come up with your human inferior will and think that's going to trump his will you think he doesn't have a will people say oh i got my free will what do you think so that means god don't have one and who do you who you think is going to win yours or his so so we find that he says here verse 17 for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god all right and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and here it is men loved darkness rather than light doesn't say god forced them to do that or god tricked them into that or god entrapped them to do that they made a choice they loved it they had an opportunity as every man must get and they chose to stay with what they had which was a fallen condition and they enjoyed the pleasures of sin for a season and forsook the joys of the lord in eternity right now watch so verse 19 and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved that's how i know i'm of god because i make mistakes and i regret them and i come to god to have them removed amen that's how i know my heart is turned see that's how i know i don't love the things of this world if i did why would i repent of them see my flesh gets weak my flesh stumbles but that takes me to my knees see i can't live there because i pass from death unto life and my nature has changed all right so and he but he verse 21 but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god all right now we'll go to my to my powerpoint please brothers and we'll put that up and i i'm going to just give you a bible lesson today that's been on my heart for more than a week actually and uh started piecing some of this together some weeks ago and i don't know if i've made some of these points i i i preach so often i'm on bible study every morning and i'm here twice a week and i never know what i said where so if i repeat something you just hear it again the lord knew you need to hear it again so i love i'm titling this sermon today seeing the unseen are you going to am i going to run it from here i guess so this is good all right so seeing the unseen and i want to take for subtitle unseeing to see all right unseeing to see that's a very important almost my subtitle if you don't get that you're not going to really benefit from the title all right but i'm going to present to you today a very strange thought that many times you're first going to have to unsee to see when people are formally indoctrinated the first thing you got to get them to do is unsee all of that see that's paul had to unsee everything he ever thought was right paul said i i forgot i unseen all that i knew to know christ i had to unsee i had to unhear i had to unlearn that because it was all erroneous and wrong and i i had you know if i wanted to see god for real just like when the when the greeks who love knowledge love it those guys love knowledge and they came to see jesus and they come to philip and sir we would see jesus and philip telleth andrew and andrew takes them to jesus lord these men want to see you and you would think that common courtesy jesus would have got up and stepped across and shook their hand hello i'm jesus of nazareth good to meet you how can i help you what are you what are you here for but it's almost like jesus immediately was just like in another realm and he starts with this weird parable about except a corner of wheat die to bite us alone lord these men want to see you oh they do except the corn of wheat diet bideth alone okay did you get that yeah i think i got it what does he mean i have no idea [Laughter] and so you know there's no business cards exchanged there there's no they're they're not ex they're not doing linkedin so so you find that jesus goes into this parable to begin to explain what nicodemus also struggled with that listen i know you think you see me and your eyes do see me photons are striking your pupils and the brain is turning that into image but but unless you join me in death burial and resurrection you will never see me you can't really see me you can see me but you can't really see me you get it and so so it's it's it's interesting that uh so i'm saying all this to get your mind focused on this thought today so first i want to look at this scripture in revelation 6. now this is the the scripture concerning the seals and i i don't want to get sidetracked in that or boy i'll really burn up all my time going down a rabbit trail with that i just want to focus on one particular line here that and i saw when the lamb had opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying so now catch it the the four the when one of the four beasts spoke it sounded like thunder you get me so he he hears the noise uh of a thunder and it's actually one of the four living creatures saying come and see so and then then it's gonna say that same thing in the second seal the same thing in the third seal and the same thing i jumped to the fourth just to cut to the chase and when he had opened the fourth seal now that's our age we're living in the fourth seal under the mysteries opened under the seventh seal remember the the don't think of the seventh seal as some object the it's a seal that that had a mystery locked inside it and that mystery was the was the mighty god understand and the world had lost the understanding of who the mighty god was fully in the ages brother branham said irenaeus was the last one to have a full understanding of the mystery of the godhead that's why right after that in the fourth age at the end of the age which is when the messenger comes going into the fourth ages says you've not denied my name because and that's the last time you're going to hear the name mentioned until hundreds and hundreds of years later in the philadelphian age when he comes and and he's going to now restore the name because an open door is set at the end of the age which would be the beginnings of the restoration of understanding that jesus and god are the same person he's not a third person now that was only the beginning and that set there after wesley was gone because wesley died a trinitarian this was the beginning of the jesus name jesus only movement amen it even actually proceeded just a little bit before the azusa revival and went into the azusa revival and that's why brother branham would say laodicea properly as an age is really almost an extension of philadelphia because it's in philadelphia where he began to restore the mystery of who god is now all they saw was jesus only and because the seventh seal had not been broken that that unveiled all of the mystery that had been hidden amen they had it in the early age but that age backslid amen and so instead of jesus being able to come for his bride he must sit back down now seal the mystery under seven seals intercede for the ignorance of the churches through seven ages amanda's elementary if you're a believer but at the end time it shall be light in the evening time when he would send forth a messenger who would ironically be the same seventh angel to laodicea who had all the understanding of laodicea that's why he could preach the church ages even before the seals under inspiration but when the seals come that messenger can't open them only the lamb can open them but he's got that messenger in the earth so that when the lamb opens it he brings it to the messenger and the messenger gives it to you and you see yourself in the book because that's the mighty god unveiled see so the trinitarians in their formula they've got him in three persons the oneness in their formula doesn't include his body the seventh seal revealed that christ was the mystery of god revealed and now the bride his body is the mystery of christ revealed it's just a continual a continual unfolding that's why you're the final voice of the final age that's why you have to eat the book because you must prophesy not you don't got to get up in a pulpit like me or be a prophet like brother branham but your life has to be a living testimony to the world that's why you're here without that you have little purpose amen say that's a pretty bold statement you're saying people that are not born again have almost no purpose that's right did you know they're not even living yet brother brown said until you're born again you're not even living only when you're born again you finally are living when you're before you're born again you're only dying you're born and you're aging out and you're burning your candle and you're going to die but once you're born again jesus said you will never die see so so we find that when god unlocked the mystery of the of the seals he was unveiling himself amen to the bride so that so that as jesus was the walking living breathing manifestation of god amen now your job is to be the walking breathing living manifestation of christ amen because we're headed to a day when the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdoms of our lord and his christ that's not to lord's doctrine that's jesus and his bride christ and his bride all right so so we find then that when he says come and see remember friends these are the same cherubs these four living creatures are the same cherubs remember when they fell in the garden of eden and god put angels with flaming swords to drive them away from the tree of life and drove them out of the garden of eden this is those same living creatures these are the same living creatures that guarded the way you see it in matthew mark luke and john they're guarding the gospels are guarding the mystery of god and and that's why that's why it's got to be every word line upon line line upon line see and then the apostles and prophets are to continue on but they've got to preach according to what jesus taught and then you become obligated to receive the words of christ and the words of the apostles and prophets because it's god working in harmony you understand and so so we we're finding then that that these are the same exact living creatures who were come and see at one time it was stay back i'll cut you amen i got a flaming sword i will wipe you out if you try to approach but now brother branham said these same angels are now trying to drive you back to the tree of life come and see is the angels driving you back to the to the tree of life [Applause] i'm going to tell you something friends that is that is a jubilee that is so glorious and god has allowed you to be a part of it to be to understand these deep things of god that the bible says great sages and men of old and even angels desired to look into these things and couldn't see it god having something better for you and i at the last day see so here we are we've been given a commission come and see and i'm going to tell you if you're going to see christ properly you're going to have to do some unseeing first yes you're going to have to now i don't just mean and that's an important point i don't just mean unsee like lose your former doctrine because some of you been raised in in this some of you been under my ministry for decades i'm not here to tell you you got to unsee all that now i'm not talking about doctrine that's one element of it but now here's something you're going to have to unsee you're going to have to unsee the the collapsing of the world if you're going to have faith if you can't unsee it you're going to live in fear amen amen when you see what all is going on in politics when you see what i was going on in religion and you see what i was going on in demon powers because that's a trifecta a trinity of political religious and demon powers say do you all this this this this pandemic this was just a plan gimmick it's a pandemonic i don't i don't care who planned what when how or where it's all listen don't lose sight of this god's in control god is in control and if you run in fear from this if you can't handle the footman how are you going to run with the horseman i'm here to tell you something friends don't be fearing these footmen but it's going to get worse the horsemen are coming and i'm here to tell you it's time now that we cast down fear and imagination and stand on the word of god you say but people are dying only because god allows it but even god's family are passing away only because their time was up the devil can't kill god's family he can't do anything to god's family except by permission these things are in the hand of almighty god i might die from i might die from a pandemic tomorrow i might get hit by a bus tomorrow you understand but at my as david said my times are in his hands so you know what we do we operate with prudence because we're commanded to read the song of solomon read the book of proverbs don't tell me prudence isn't a major factor in our lives but we don't operate in fear see we will be prudent we have been we will continue to be we will do what's prudent but we're not going to run in fear because it's not going to get better amen so come and see you're going to have to see past sometimes if you're sick today you need to unsee symptoms if you got a dilemma in your life if if you've got wayward teenagers you're gonna have to unsee that you're gonna have to believe a promise of god if you got something you need in your life or your home or your family or your marriage stop looking at the circumstance look to the promise see so so then he goes on here i keep up with myself or i'll get sidetracked and this is this is a really organized sermon more more so than normal so i'm trying to be studious second corinthians 3 18 here's another one but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord let me read that i'm breaking it up let's read it more with more flow but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord so what we're finding is that is that what you're transformed into what you gaze at that's why if you gaze on the wrong thing if you're if you're gazing at too much hollywood you're going to start looking like that if if if your mindset is the is the career path and success at any cost when god never called one of us to be successful he called us to be faithful amen and people have traded being faithful for success and that never ends well for a child of god you go ahead and do it but you're going to take a beating for it because god loves you too much to let you get by with that trust me and so so we find that that that that we're looking and becoming yeah now that's a critical juncture i can't even move on in my notes until i know you've got that looking is becoming what you gaze at you're transformed into so now come back to what i said you need to unsee some stuff let me say it this way you need to ungaze you need to turn your eyes upon jesus look full in his wonderful face and the things of this world that ran you around and merry-go-round and never give you peace and rest will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace see so if you think about these these examples in the scripture we can i want to think of a few uh i love how brother branham this is william branham stop preaching right here because brother branham would make his points and then he'd go back and show you bible examples and i'm just going to give you four five that you're very familiar with we go back to elijah and and elisha following elijah and it's a it's a type of christ in the bride it's a there there's a type there of our elijah and us continuing his ministry onto the coming of the lord brother branham said i wanna i wanna see these young men here take the message and carry it on to the coming of the lord i just say i'll i'll do that i volunteer amen i hear both my hands lord amen amen so so that that that's why brother jd is is overseas right now that's why brother matt and i brother jd brother caleb that's why we that's why we're preaching because we're carrying on to the coming of the lord and we want you to go with us so don't get mad at us if we have to say things that hurt your feelings because we want you to come with us amen so so we find that elijah says you know what is it that you want from me and elisha reveals his whole heart he wants to have that same thing that's on elijah upon him i want to carry on after you're gone i want this same ministry i want it doubled to me all right and so so i so now elijah says two things and i think i mentioned this here last time but one of the things that elijah says to him is you've asked a hard thing but now it's not like you've asked a hard thing like it's going to be hard you're going to lift a rock that weighs 400 pounds is going to be hard it's not that kind of a hard thing it's that it's a harder way you've asked for a harder life you've asked for the narrow way you've had the narrow way in the greek means the grinding way so elijah elisha understand elisha don't put your hand to this plow now i know you had your hand on a plow and i came and put my cloak on you and said follow me and you did but now someday the messiah's gonna stand on the earth and he's gonna say this plow whoever puts his hand to this plow and takes it off that's a really bad position to be in so think elisha i want you to think about this what you're asking is a harder way you're not going to be popular you're going to struggle harder than everybody else has to because satan hates your guts he's the god of economics he's never going to let it work for you smoothly he's always going to be jabbing at your finances he's always going to be trying to make you sick he's always going to be trying to eliminate you he's always going to be trying to discourage you and depress you i'm going to tell you something friends you know between i i'm here to to battle the devil i i see myself as a warrior against him and i don't want to see both of us can't be happy i don't ever that's it's i mean let me tell you something friends it's mutually exclusive we can't both be happy at the same time one of us is going to be unhappy i'd rather it be him one of us is going to be depressed i don't want it to be me one of us is going to have anxiety one of us is going to have stress i'd rather it be him not me amen if somebody's going to be stressed out let it be me making him stressed out if somebody's going to be afraid let it be me making him afraid if somebody's going to be depressed or unhappy let it be the enemy not me amen not here to sign a treaty with him or not looking for you know the you know it's not that both can't be true at the same time either you're depressed or he is either you're stressed out or he is either you're afraid or he is either you're happy unhappy or he if you're unhappy he's happy you're not both happy at the same time amen if you if you're both happy at the same time it's because he's got you tricked and fooled into thinking you're okay when he actually knows you're not amen amen see so so he says to elisha listen this is not going to make you popular do you understand the queen hates me he's trying to kill me you understand that elisha you understand that ministerial school over there that school of prophets they don't like me you understand elijah i want you to get it you're not going to be socially attractive if you're a believer you're not going to have smooth sailing the the powers that be in the world are never going to let you be on the end if you're following me so think it through elisha think it through strong because once you put your hand to this plow son don't take it off that's a really bad thing if you do that see and the and of course the other thing is if you see me when i go in other words if you haven't defected if you're still with me to the end you'll carry this gospel on if you haven't if you haven't ran back across jordan and joined up with the school of the prophets and forsook the message then then you will you will have this anointing on you and you'll carry on to the coming of the lord amen but the but the point was that he had to keep his eyes that if you see me if your focus is on me if your focus is on the school of the prophets you're going to lose track of me i move quick elisha and and there was even times where elijah would say to him listen i'm going to go over here to dothan i've got to go over here to a place you don't need to go it's kind of hard i don't even want to put you through it elisha said as the lord god liveth i will not leave you i am determined i'm here to tell you something friend i'm determined to see this thing through i'm determined i'm never quitting god may toss me aside for my failures but i'm never going to quit i'm in this thing for keeps i'm in this thing for all the way amen and so that's i'm constantly praying david's prayer lord goodness don't judge me by my works i'm finished if you do judge me by my heart that loves you lord how many want to pray that prayer today you know i remember years ago brother eugene teaching a a lesson about how that you know david was controlling the kingdom of israel long before he was ever seated on the throne saul was actually the king saul had the crown and all the authority and the army and everything but david was controlling israel you know why because saul was always worried where's david what's david doing what's up with david anybody ever got a report on david and and and through that because saul had his eyes off the target saul was all saul was looking at the wrong thing where's david what's david what's going on about david conspiracy this conspiracy that you know and and jonathan tries to tell him david loves you you know and but but it didn't matter because listen friends if you keep going down that path eventually truth stops speaking to you it's still speaking but you've stopped listening you've stopped hearing and the truth can absolutely be be be right right in your ear and god absolutely uh trying to get you to understand his word and you you literally become you know uh deaf to it you can you no longer can hear because you you resisted so long and so uh i i remember um i remember let me see if i can find it here quickly this was a wonderful statement from spurgeon he says thy grace must give us even to know our need of grace that beautiful thy grace must give us even to know our need of grace we are not willing to confess our own sinfulness until thou dost show it to us though it stares us in the face our pride denies it and our own inability is un and our own inability is unperceived by us we we steal thy power and call it our own till thou dost compel us to say that we have no strength in ourselves and so often times you'll find people making that dreadful mistake i'm glad i've i've often uh thought that you know the wisdom of god to only put a window in the top of the ark so noah couldn't look around god wanted him look in one direction see he even had to use birds of the air to figure out if the flood waters were deceived he couldn't even get him to look around see he could only look at the heavens and god did it that way he had a side door but god closed it he couldn't open it remember they wanted him to open it they're beating on the side of the door no no help noah we went to high school together [Music] no our family's picnic together noah open noah said i didn't close it i can't open it you were warned for 120 years you were warned and now god has closed it i can't open it but one thing he could look up was a window looking to the sky and so so we find that god would not even allow noah the ability to look around at at the at the terrible plight of the earth and and i'm going to tell you something friends god wants your focus in one direction jesus said that jesus gave a whole bullet list of terrible things that are unfolding at the end time and he said when you see these things look around and get involved he didn't say that he said look up your redemption draweth nigh see so so we find brother branham told the story you remember the story about the boy on the bicycle you know to get that new schwinn bike i remember as a kid man oh man if i could get a swim bike i i was gonna be it'd be like a porsche and uh i finally did get one i forget how we got one but somehow my mom got me a swing and we at least throw that thing to we broke it in half and uh but brother branham talks about that little boy that nobody thought he could ride the plank all the way they had this narrow little plank and it's ups above the ground and you got to write it it's one thing to write a line on the ground but get up in the air and write it right the same line on a plank somehow it messes with your mind and and all those boys would go a little ways and they'd go off and this little guy jumped on there and pedaled all the way to the end crossed finish line and won then won the schwinn bite and when they asked him how in the world you do that we thought you were the last one that could have done it he said i'm gonna tell you where your problem was boys he said i noticed as every one of y'all was writing it you got to looking at the ground and looking around and he said me he said i put my eyes on the end and i just never took my eyes off and i just rode straight to it he said i knew the board went there so i just looked to there and i just rode amen i'm gonna tell you something friends get your eyes off of your surroundings unsee fear unseed stress unsee anxiety unsee the problems in the government unsee the problems in the nation unsee the problems and see the promise see you know the their brother ram tells the story about the musician you know how he he didn't care what the audience was you know clapping thunder salvations said he wasn't even looking at him so he's looking up in the balcony he was waiting before he would even take a bow he waited for the master to stand and applaud and then he knew see so so we find in the scripture that you remember here's another example for you you remember simon peter now you talk about an important man he's going to be the spokesman for the church and here he gets sidetracked thinking about what's up with john and he comes to jesus and it's it's peter's just like so many of us wow at least we're in good company you know you ought to be thankful that you're even still alive you denied the lord you straight denied him peter you sold him out and he forgave you and you were like one of the worst sinners among us but he forgave you and now you're high and mighty and holier than thou and now you're worried about everybody else's life and judging everybody else really peter and so many times i see people do that you know forgiven for so many horrible things and then get so judgmental about everybody else and you're lucky to even be alive see and so he says to jesus what about him and jesus immediately turned and said what's that to you follow me get your eyes off him put your eyes on me peter see it was going to be too vital god couldn't let that pass because peter was going to be the one with the keys to the kingdom he was going to be the first one to put the key in the door and turn the lock jesus didn't have the keys to his kingdom he gave them to the church and peter's going to be the very first one to use them on the day of pentecost and tied joel's prophecy to a modern event made clear in prophecy that's what was happening it was a modern event made clear by joel's prophecy because they were unclear they thought they were drunk and peter said no that i'm going to identify this modern event to you by prophecy this is what joel prophesied about and he and okay then and he convinced him then they said oh what must we do implying what must we do to be saved and he he brother bram said now here he goes he's going to put the key in the door for the first time and turn the lock and open the kingdom of heaven to people and he said you've got to repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost amen amen and that never changes nobody nobody else could ever close that door when simon opened it and so his job was too important god could not jesus immediately corrected that because he he said i'm sending you as sheep among wolves it's going to get worse he tells them in matthew 24 they're going to hate you for my name they're going to persecute you they're going to kill you they're going to try everything and it's too dangerous it's too it's too wicked it's too risky the stakes are too high for you to have your eyes on the wrong thing you hear me bride i'm here to tell you you've arrived at the worst of all days and the stakes are too high for you to have your eyes on the government or the pandemic or other brothers and sisters in christ or what's happening in religion and what's happening you know about a career in wealth and all the social prestige get your eyes back on jesus unsee all of that amen see this is where we must be on our guard you see because you're not you're not you can be fooled i i understand the brightest predestinated not to be deceived that just means that she's never going to take the mark of the beast she sees it and exposes it and she's never going to that which would be so close that it would deceive the very elected if if possible the bride is predestinated not to fall for that now it doesn't mean she might wiggle around in a little bit until she gets her bearing straight and god might have to lead her out of some out of sight and god let us all out of one thing this that or the other at some point in our lives but he was obligated to because we were predestinated not to be taken out by that amen amen and so but you can be the devil can trick you and he does he does it on on a big scale you remember joshua who had the commission to cross the jordan and he did and take jericho and he did remember and now he's taking the promised land and he was and here comes the gibeonites and they're saying wow these people have literally wiped out everybody including egypt so let's let the bible said so they disguise themselves violently you know like wiley coyote you know they it's subterfuge they put on old shoes and old clothes and they got stale bread and they put dust all over their animals and over their self and they they were only three days ride away and they showed up and they said we be from a far away country now they had to say that because they were god had already told joshua displace everybody don't leave anybody in the land don't leave any trace that they were ever even here destroy even every trace of them and and take down all of their images take down everything don't have any trace of them because it'll infect your homes see and so they come in in a sneak and said we we're no no no we're not from around here you have to kill us we're from a long ways away look at our bread we we packed we baked this on the day we left look how old and moldy it is look at my shoes good grief and and oh why are you here because we heard what you did and we want a treaty with you we want to we want to have friendship we don't want you to ever come and think you're going to destroy us so our elders said go and make a covenant with them and you know just kind of stroke joshua's ego a little bit you know you guys are the are the latest thing and we're afraid of you and and you know what you know and joshua fell for it do you know why joshua fell for that because he failed to keep short books with the lord i want to tell you something friends you better keep short books that means you check yourself daily you die daily you constantly go to the lord lord should i do this lord should i not do this lord don't don't think that three days ago's permission to go forward is today's permission to go forward you need to keep short books and joshua should have gotten the priest and went to the lord and consulted to see if these men were lying or not but you know he uh these guys seem like pretty good guys and uh they are obviously from a long ways and he got fooled he got tricked i'm here to tell you you can get tricked laodicea is tricky higher education more money more career social prestige come on don't go quiet you lay the sins you live here with me come on i'm here to tell you this thing is wicked and tricky and it'll trick young people it it'll trick old people it'll trick me it'll trick women it'll it'll get you so wrapped up in the laodicea the very thing you're supposed to destroy will end up becoming a part of your life and the best joshua could do after that was put on the tribute and said well you're going to carry water and wood for the temple services from here on and they did but they couldn't kill them see they couldn't get rid of them because they had they had not kept short books and they had allowed the enemy to trick them and you're never been you've never seen an age more cunning more wildly than today see all right let's let's move on i'm going to have to keep moving on brother branham says now watch this here he is in modern events are made clear by prophecy for you're a gene of your father isn't that a wonderful statement see you're a gene of your father and you were in your father yet your father had no fellowship with you because he you was in there but you knew it not and he knew it not but you was manifested that you might that he might fellowship with you and you being born again you're born again of eternal life and that's the only one form of eternal life and that's god's life zoe the greek word is z-o-e only one form of eternal life then if you are a son of god or a daughter of god you were in god all the time but he knew what bed and time like a garden where you're gonna which bed you're gonna put the seed in which bed you're gonna put this seed in you got me but he knew what bed and time that you'd be planted in all right so now you're made a creature a son of god manifested son of god or daughter of god to do what to meet the challenge of this hour that's what that's where joshua was failing when he got tricked he couldn't meet the challenge of the hour fully and here you are friends you're here to to meet the challenge of the hour what is the challenge brother jason what is the challenge of the hour to vindicate the true and living god of this hour the message that's coming forth in this time that is my life that is my purpose my everything is to vindicate how do i vindicate by manifesting it by living it it doesn't do you any good to believe it or tell it or speak it or quote it if you're not living it if you're not living it you're not accomplishing the purpose why god put breath in your lungs to begin with if all you're interested in is making friends with the world and living in that quasi-no man's land where the world kind of lets you get by and you're not really on fire for god i'm a friend you are a sad broken person i'm here to tell you you need to say lord give me the zeal give me back the joy give me back some fervency that's nowhere for an eagle to live an eagle's never going to be happy all you'll do is be miserable and the devil will put you on a merry-go-round today and you'll never get off he'll just speed it up speed it up speed it up i just say to you like i said here a servicer go jump off of it just jump off of it now jesus will catch you and let him purpose your life see so this is what you're here for see that's right he says you were done there before the foundation of the world if it wasn't he wasn't chosen that way no matter how much you try to impersonate it you'll never make it how can you get blood from a turnip when there's no blood in there so now don't lose sight of the fact that we're not talking about there there's you know brother branham would say he said now being a former baptist i know they don't like the word predestination because he knew he had been a baptist himself they don't like predestination he says but now all we're saying is is god simply foreknew who would and who wouldn't he's going to give them all an equal chance he's going to have to do that he's going to he he he you know he as it rel you know for all of humanity the bible says jesus died for the sins plural of the whole world so so we must preach to all see we're not selective on who we preach to we preach to everybody to give everybody to give a chance to all though god already knows the choice they'll make but it must here it it must be a lived out manifestation to be evidence at their trial god even for the heathen who never heard it they're going to be raised up in the millennium to hear it you understand god can't condemn people without evidence and therefore we preach the gospel to them and they make the choice and it's a legitimate choice sure god knows what it's going to be and therefore he can predetermine what's going to happen to them but he doesn't trap them or force them to do it right you understand he just simply already knows that a choice they're going to make so he can set his books you and i don't know so we preach to everybody amen but that is a completely dif that's just to the world but that that's not the same garden bed as his elected genes for his elected genes they're they they're that's not even you choosing him that's him choosing you because that kind of election is pure origin i come from god so i go back to god and that's why i see the message of the hour i won't be the only one in heaven there will be many the foolish virgin you understand you understand the foolish virgin will be there because they were righteous people they were not they were not get this out of your head forever they were not these fake christians who have a form of godliness but deny the power those people are going to hell amen 100 there's no chance for a person who looks at god and has the word revealed to them and will not follow it they doom themselves now say so you get to be the arbiter of who that is thank god no thank god no i'm not the arbiter of who that is i'm only speaking generically of a principle of god's word that when i read matthew 25 i see that people are being destroyed and some people are given eternal life and the ones that are granted eternal life are the righteous the sanctified ones not these who those who had a form of godliness who were fake christians and 99 of christians are that according to the bible according to the bible broad is the way that leadeth to destruction many shall go therein but narrow is the way that lead to life and few there be that find it in the days of noah it was only eight in the days of enoch it was only one amen so if you if you disagree with it i've got more evidence than you i've got scriptural precedent to read i can see what happens to people who just make who do who just make christianity a religiosity and they're no more born again than that chair is born again they're not going in a rapture they're not going to heaven they don't have eternal life they're going to be destroyed unless they're born again jesus said to nicodemus a righteous holy man you must be born again if you're not born again you're you're just going to live out your death sentence that you were born by because you chose not to take god at his word and believe on his son and people have a mental idea of that but it doesn't change their life that's just a social gospel those are the ones who try to get in by building by doing works and jesus says no you can't you those were iniquity they he doesn't deny their works he says they were iniquitous because you actually knew you knew that you were just trying to force my hand but you knew you were evil in your heart and you tried to earn it by works guess what you're not going to get in and they head straight to the lake of fire i didn't write that he did and i'm not going to sit back and let people under my care think that that's not true if if you disagree with that you need another pastor because i'm going to preach to you god's word i want to get it down into your heart now because your job is to manifest the word of this day you're the only chance they have the only chance they have is if you put on the whole armor of god and be a vindication and be a a living reality that's the best chance they have if you live a wishy-washy carnal life that's unspiritual how are you ever going to get anyone convinced of the word it's impossible and i can't be silent to that i'm a watchman on the wall and i cannot be silent to that and the more wicked the world becomes and the more i see my sheep headed in that direction the harder i will preach it from this death i love you too much amen and i fear god too much to let that go i'm i'm i'm going to teach it to these young people i'm going to raise a generation up under this ministry that doesn't believe that bunch of nonsense we're not here to be a half christian there's no such thing you're either full of the spirit of god or you don't have any of the spirit of god either you're completely converted or you're not i get in maturity i get you got to grow i get that of course yeah duh no kidding of course we've got to grow of course we've got to put on of course we've got to add to and add to an add to but that's that has nothing to do with them with a new birth if i'm born again i don't need to add two to cast out devils i have the authority of heaven the day i'm born again to cast out devils to preach the gospel hallelujah to see the enemy bound and his lies exposed amen amen amen so so i i'm obligated to tell you the truth amen it must be a lived out manifestation our life must be a lived out manifestation brother branham says here in the seed is not heir with the shock now notice but at the opening of the seven seals revelation 10 the full word is to be born into manifestation again and vindicated by the spirit of god in the full strength as it was when it was here on earth manifested in the same way doing the same things that it did when it was here on earth amen hebrews 13 8 said jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever saint luke 10 17 30. jesus said in the last days as it was in the days of sodom when the son of man will be revealing himself again it'll be the exact same thing in that glorious the world in a sodom condition and the church has went into sodom with it like lot and his wife now john 3 13. no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven well i'm almost out of time even the son of man which is in heaven now this is an interesting because i want you to i want you to think about this for a minute and brother branham is going to take this and he's going to mash it up with except you eat the flesh of the son of man drink his blood you have no life in you so he's going to mash them up together and uh and and and give the principal so we find that that it's come to a sodom condition and the church has went with it like lot and his wife and so while we say that there is an elected church somewhere in the world you know that's that's that's literally being pulled out and set aside and and literally is setting aside the world and unseeing the world and pressing on because the manifestation of god what what did that to your life because the manifestation of god has attracted your attention i mean why else would you be here with having somebody tell you that except you're born again you're going to hell except you're born again you'll in no wise see the kingdom of heaven amen and so so so we realize that even even coming to the millennia even coming to the millennium the foolish virgin are not there amen why for the 144 000 are yeah and it's almost like wow it's kind of weird revelation 15 has them both they both came up out of great tribulation and one of them had the song of moses and one of them had the song of the lamb the ones who had the song of moses 144 000 get to be in the millennium and the ones who have the song and lamb don't get to what gives they're even in the same verse because the 144 000 received this message of the seventh seal under moses and elijah when the bride leaves here this same eagle anointing lifts up and flies east and picks up moses and elijah and takes this message of the seventh seal to the jews under the seventh trumpet and they actually receive the holy ghost and they're actually born again believing this same message the fullest virgin who have come up out of great tribulation did not believe it they actually rejected it and had to go through the tribulation and suffer for it and they're not going to be in the millennium they'll be somewhere with life they're not going to be in hell but they're not going to be in the millennium and then at the end of the millennium a thousand years later they're brought up and judged with the rest of the world and then they're given eternal life at that time amen that's plain scripture and so so we find then that that when he comes here to no man has to send it up to heaven but he that hath came down from heaven all right so brother branham says so he turned around he had 70 with him he said to that 70 will you what will you say when you see the son of man ascending up into heaven from whence he came now he never explained it they looked at one another and said well the son of man ascending up from where he come from well now watch look at what they're seeing we know his mother we we know his brothers and his sisters we seen the manger he was laid in when he was born we seen the cradle he was rocked in why he's come from nazareth coming up from there this is a hard saying and they didn't walk with him no more now all the time these disciples stood right there they didn't know it either but they believed it they couldn't explain it they he never explained it see but they were ordained to life they couldn't explain it but they sat there so he turned and said i've chose 12 of you one is a devil he said do you want to go also and they said uh uh or let me and and you know the answer lord to whom would we go thou has the words of eternal life so we find that that here's here's people hearing jesus say you know except you eat my flesh and drink my blood except you'll be born again you can never in the spirit and never enter the kingdom of god how would you think if you saw the son of man which is standing right in front of you but yet he's in heaven and yet you see him here and you know what they couldn't get past they couldn't unsee they couldn't we know his brothers i knew his sisters i i saw the manger he was born and i saw the cradle i know his family isn't he from nazareth is carpenter's son this is a strange saying you know why because they couldn't unsee that i'm here to tell you something friends there's there's things that he didn't explain and even the disciples didn't understand it and he didn't explain it to them it would take the holy ghost just know this friends god's not here today let me say this god's not here to explain everything to you i may have even muddied the water more for you by some of the things i said it's not about understanding it's it's are you a believer do you believe that this message is the message of this hour sent to rapture bride and if you don't believe that then i will just ask you then what message would you point to if it's not this one there's none other out there even remotely close to it and i say to you this is a message to rapture a bride and there's no other message out there it's the message that will make real christians go in a real rapture [Applause] and there is no other message that will accomplish that and he said what about somebody on a deserted island then god will send them up uh somebody will drop a book out of 33 000 feet and it'll land on their head and they'll read and believe it i don't know i don't know it's not up to me to know but i know this message is sent to gather a bride from around the world amen amen see but it's the sodom condition and this is what they needed so desperately to look past see so he says but you'll now watch this you'll stick anything down that soul just anything any kind of a creed and never look brother branham brother brown talks about let me go back so you don't read ahead of me brother ram talks about you sit in a restaurant and they bring you soup and it's got a bug in it and he said you won't eat it some spider some roach some fly whatever you won't eat it you'll actually complain make them take it back and then you probably won't know i don't even want any more i don't want where that came from but brother branham says but you'll stick anything down in that soul just anything any kind of creed never look into it to see whether it's the right thing or not there's a way that seems right to a man search the scriptures and that is that soul is eternal you know so don't just watch what you put in there see these creeds and all these things we just got it like a lodge join a lodge and that settles it and that's the way people think today that's the reason [Music] they have no time to be studying meditating searching things and trying to figure out whether they're right or not because they're filling their soul with so much stuff so much nonsense of the world and their their spirituality's gone out the window and they they they've lost the ability to stop and go wait a minute is what i'm believing the truth i mean you you you should you shouldn't just swallow anything even this message of the hour you need to ask god reveal it to me make it real to me because no man can come except the father draws him and nobody can approach the father except by the son and whom the son will reveal him to that that scriptural principle is why we don't hold billy graham type crusades because i'm not trying to gain numbers i'm not trying to we're after a where i only need a few good men and women god has an elected few now i want to preach to the whole world i'm going to cherokee to do just that because i don't know who all's a seed and who's not so we're casting it everywhere it's why i've been around the world so many times preaching the gospel because i'm trying to find the last seed but i'm not naive i'm not naive to think that everybody who says lord lord is going to enter in see so so we find that he says whether whether they're right or not all right what is the evidence of a believer that will believe the identified word of the hour it's always been that way the people get it scrupled up in all kinds of traditions and religions and denominations and elections education and so forth but god comes along with his word and confirms it for the hour that's the evidence you believe the confirmed word and brother branham says it's always been that way and i have said that as a student of this book since a boy it's always been that way there's no instance in here where anybody ever found acceptance in god's presence except by believing the message of their hour whatever hour they were in see that's not a new thing all right so he says here in dedication now we find out i'm out of time but i'm at the bottom of my notes so just stay with me i just want to read you these quotes been working on this for more than a week so just give me a few times a little bit of time now we find out that there is a great spiritual application here that i would like to mainly refer to now if you read the first kings you'll find in this solomon being as a young man to build this temple that his father had been promised though god through god that he would build you see he stays in line with the scripture he stays in line with the scripture all right let me get to catch catch up to myself all right he stays in line with the with with the um that's not right do we find out and then oh yeah i'm sorry all right now that's what we must always do to be successful is to stay in line with god's promises i could not give you better advice than that if you gave me a million dollars today i could not give you better advice than that stay in line with god's promises and in order to do that you're going to have to ignore some lies of the age and the lies of the enemy and you're going to have to unsee some things see stay with in line with god's promises now no matter how it seems best to go this way or that way stay lined with the scripture young people follow that if you do you'll be successful if you go off of that if that's not your life's motto then you're in trouble see you're going to roll around and burn a lot and you waste a lot of time see so no matter how it seems best to go this way or that way stay lined with the scripture solomon know that god had promised his father david that he would build the temple and then now now brother branham i'm going chronologically since 1962 and he's saying stay in line with god's word stay in line you get me now he's going to come to masterpiece in 64. he's talking about those girls that he saw remember remember he saw he saw the early church and she was holy and decent and then he saw that the church is out of the church ages and until it got down to the last one of america and he said she's the worst of all of them remember how depressed and embarrassed he was and then the voice said the bride must come into preview again because there had to be an omega to an alpha and man you had the first bride she has to come into preview again that's you and me and brother branham said now then as they started leaving two or three of them this is that sainted bunch of little girls smooth clean marching to the step of the gospel left right left right left marching in harmony to the gospel and he says i see two or three of them in the back kind of get out of step those are the ones at the very tail end those last members just before the rapture right they and i was going to holler at them and they was trying to get back in step again and i seen them just the vision just fade out and change from me he comes to 1965 in the rapture i noticed one of them trying two or three of them trying to get getting out of line i screamed stay in line and the vision left me and i was standing in the room screaming stay in line now i don't i didn't put the next quote up we'll stop right there but brother branham tells in another place the thing that made them lose step was they were watching that other group they were watching that church that fallen church of america go off the edge and the screams and the howls and they were like oh my gosh what's going on and it caused them to you know from from left left left and they kind of left right left left and brother brandon says stay in line and i and i and i love how brother stacy goodbread told me because he i think he was in the air force and he said you know brother jason if if you get out of line and he said it's left left left right left he said if you get out of line you're only half a step to get back in don't ever think the devil's got you so far you can't recover he said all it takes is is left right and he said then you just just make a little half step and you're back on track again don't let the devil pull you out and say oh it's too far i i i can't get back yes you can all you got to do is get back in step with the word of god all you got to do is line your life back up with the word of god you don't have to you know the bible says there's coming an age in the holy ghost where no one's going to need to cross the ocean and say hey can you go get the lord and bring him to us nobody's going to have to say can somebody fly up to heaven and bring him back down he said because in the holy ghost he'll be in you the word of god is nighty it's even in thy mouth call on the name of the lord today allow him to bring your life back into step unsee but say that to you today as we close unsee the circumstances that are hindering you turn your eyes upon jesus turn your eyes away from these things unhear unthink un uninvolved disconnect yourself from the things of the world that are pulling you inextricably i mean you're you're you're never going to be able to resist the the gravitational pull of sin except god do it for you and so my advice to you today is is reach up and say lord help me today i've been i've i need to unsee some things i need to unthink some things i need to unlearn some things i need to come back and shake myself and get back to where i know when the power of god was moving in my life and i want to see that in this last hour right here i want to be a manifestation of the word of god amen as i said to you before friends any positive feeling you have is mutually exclusive between you and satan it's at no time can you both be happy it's not that's not the way it's designed don't ever if somebody's going to be unhappy let it be him if somebody's going to be stressed out let won't you let it be him if somebody's going to be afraid somebody's going to be fearful why don't you let him be fearful make him afraid of you say he'll be afraid of me brother branham said when this any any born-again child of god comes down the street and demons see him coming brother ram said they howl and faint oh my people say wow what was that oh demon running he saw me coming amen let's stand to our feet friends god bless you for your patience amen praise the name of the lord come brother bradley bring your team back amen hallelujah i i i want to sing that song again sister deb that y'all were singing i think third song before i came out brad quiet me let peaceful waters flow i just want to end today give you a few moments to meditate on the things you've heard i want you to consider it friends i want you to think long and hard about some of the things i taught you out of god's word these things sometimes can be sharp but these things are necessary all i'm like listen i i can't make you into a believer it's not even my job it's not even my job all i can do is identify to you the enemy i can i'm a watchman and i can identify to you the enemy this is what he looks like this is where he's at this is what he's trying to do to you now you gotta just like just like you gotta you enemy sin is crouching at the door he said that to cain trying to give cain even gain a chance said sin is crouching at the door but listen son you must conquer him you must conquer him amen let's pray father we thank you for your word today and i am grateful for your grace in my life [Music] lord as i stand here and come and try to identify the age and try to make try to clear away all the debris so that people can make an informed decision i can't make it for them all i can do is encourage them to follow it and try to live it in front of that's that's the limit that's all you've asked me to do was stand in your presence and i have and you said that if i'd stand in your presence i'd called your people to hear your word and i know this he's promised it that if your people hear your word they'll go free from their sin so that's my job lord that's my commission you gave me 26 years ago stand in my presence stand in my counsel cause my people to hear my word and if my people hear my word they'll go free so lord i stand here today as best i know i've delivered lord the inspiration that you gave me having studied this thought for more than a week now lord it's been rolling around in my heart and mind i think about this question deeply lord i'm all the time making sure i'm to find the balance on it lord and it's been a week of great study it's been a i've appreciated your presence near me as i've worked on it lord i pray now i hope you'll help the people to unsee so that they may see granted lord let the days coming the day's coming not just today but the days coming they'll ponder some of these things and maybe not everything was palatable perfectly to them today but let the holy spirit blow his breezes upon them granted lord i committed to you i commit these people those on the internet you can't you can't draw such lines in the sand and not expect lord to cross somebody else's lines so that's just a given but father i'm committing it to you now today and i'm believing that you will do all lord according to your riches in glory in jesus name let's sing it friends [Music] let peaceful waters flow learn to be [Music] let me hear my jesus [Music] let's raise up our hands just before we go sing it now [Music] learn my soul [Music] yes [Music] saying it again now [Music] my soul let me [Music] now let me just have the piano softly dab display that for me all your heads bowed again please lord we love you today we love your word i pray father that i'm thinking about of course these people and i've spent more than an hour now thinking about them but lord now the bible says let a man examine himself i want to be standing and think about me for a moment lord is all my life according to your word may every individual here right now don't think about the person next to them stop thinking about me or what you heard think about yourself for a moment examine yourself just quietly here in the presence of the lord is your life friend really think hard now be honest i'm not going to call anybody out i'm not going to ask for a show of hands this is between you and god why don't you just take a moment and slow down before i release you back to this maddening laodicea while you're here in a moment with soft music and the preaching of the gospel that drove back unbelief just ask yourself lord lord is my life in line with your word are my purposes lined up with your word am i marching to the step of the gospel help me lord if i look at every area of my life sure i can see plenty of areas where i feel like i am excelling but then there are other areas if i'm honest or i say lord i might be a half step out right there help me to get back in harmony with your word you want to pray that today friends you wanted to say lord right now look down into the deep recesses of my heart father show me father the truth about me show me what's needed lord i i don't even know what what all you might have for me today i i want i would like to think that i could pray this kind of prayer and to zoom i'd be hitting him hitting perfectly on all areas but i know you don't often work like that lord you don't even grow a blade of grass overnight you take time you're slow you're not in a hurry you woo you speak softly and tenderly father i pray that you will help hearts today help teenagers help children help parents this a wicked world it's a terrible terrible terrible age wickedness and in high places lord and the whole earth gone into darkness and and a gross darkness a complete blindness on the people so how do we how do we get the light to them lord there's where balance will
