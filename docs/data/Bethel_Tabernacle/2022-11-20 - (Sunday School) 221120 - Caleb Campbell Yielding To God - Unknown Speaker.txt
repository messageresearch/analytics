TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Mr Amy sorry I'm actually supposed to be up there right now so if we could just all Stand Together just open up our Bibles into we're going to do two portions of reading this morning it is uh John chapter 15 we'll start with John chapter 15 and verses five amen John chapter 15 and verse 5. just turn in our Bibles there amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen says I am the vine and ye are the branches and he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing amen if we'd like to also turn in our Bibles to Ruth the first chapter Ruth chapter one we're going to read a few scriptures over there a few verses of scripture amen root chapter 1 and verse we'll start at verse 13. and she uh we'll actually start at verse let's start at verse 10 and they said unto her surely we will return unto thee thy people and Naomi said turn again my daughters why will ye go with me are there yet any more sons in thy womb that they may be your husbands turn again my daughters go your way for I am too old to have a husband if I should say I have hope if I should have a husband also tonight and also and should also bear Sons would you tarry for them till they were grown would you stay for them from having husbands name my daughters for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the Lord has gone out against me and this is the portion of scripture I just kind of want to focus on this morning and they lifted up their voice and wept again and orfa kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth claved unto her and she said behold thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people and under her Gods return Thou after thy sister-in-law and Ruth said and treat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whether thou goest I will go and where thou largest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God my God where thou Diest will I die and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee in me and when she saw this that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her amen by the help of the Lord I'd just like to take a topic of yielding if we just want to go before the Lord in prayer this morning Heavenly Father Lord we just Lord approach your throne this morning Father we're so thankful for just another opportunity to gather together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ father God we pray over the reading of your word Lord we pray that Lord it can just come into our hearts this morning Father we pray that we can just be changed and Lord molded and grafted Lord God just a little bit further into your image this morning Lord God and I pray over the service Lord I pray over the Lord the musicians I pray over the song leader Lord I pray over the Lord the minister father God I just pray over the saints of God lord I pray that the anointing of the spirit of the Lord Jesus would be here this morning Father God and we can just enter into that anointing Lord we just leave our cares Lord we leave our burdens we leave it all now outside of these doors Lord Jesus and we just come before you now father Lord just with an Open Heart Lord God as I'm just taking this Lord as you laid it upon my heart to just Minister on yielding Lord God take a little Sunday School portion on yielding help us yield this morning Father God for further and further into your word and Lord just let it be in Into the Depths of our hearts we pray and ask these things now in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen as you take your seats this morning brother Branham speaks in 1963 and the message how can I overcome he says just like putting a little baby's arm in a sleeve hole you see he's just up down over and everything else see he can't do it put on your coat honey he can't do it little arm is down around it just takes your Steady Hand oh glad how glad I am I can just yield my hand to my father and say Lord Jesus I can't get in there you help me put on the coat for me I quit trying and I just let him do it see if the little baby keeps trying oh I can do it I can do it he's just everywhere he can't do it and neither can you neither can I but if we just hold still and let him do it and just yield to him here Lord here am I just let me be nothing amen you put my hand in the right place and that's the victory that's overcoming yielding is overcoming amen the thing that you have to overcome still in this quote is is yourself your idea your thing and surrender yourself to him he overcame for you he knows the way we don't and Noah's time there was eight Overcomers and they went in they were caught inside now look friends I believe that they're taping this if it's on the television or pardon me a tape whatever you do who's listening now who listen here after the hour is late and you do have good intentions but be caught inside amen don't don't struggle not him that willeth or him that runeth but God just let God just yield yourself to him and walk on with a perfect steadfast Faith what God promised he is able to perform amen so a person has the ability to has the ability to overcome if we uh if we practice true biblical humility and just say that Lord I I know that I can't overcome without your hand in my life amen we can't we can't do anything of ourselves we have to surrender to the hand of God to allow him to be the one who is able to to to to uh overcome for us amen he doesn't need our own abilities Moses tried doing that but it was never what God had intended you know the only thing that that he needs from us is is a complete and total surrender and as I was reading that quote last night I was just thinking how can I how can I Surrender totally you know we hear that ministered a lot we hear that on tapes a lot you know to surrender our whole hearts and to totally surrender but how can I possibly get to that point of of full maturity in Christ Jesus and I just want to take us take it back to just it's all done in Simplicity it's simply trusting in his word in every aspect of your lives amen what is what does that look like you say maybe brother Caleb you say just just keep it simple Saints it's just it just invite him in you know uh you know I'm new to to Ministry I'm new to to being a dad I'm new to there's a lot of things that I'm new to in my life and the moment that I think that I've got it all figured out is the moment that God can't use me and the same goes for our us and our lives the moment that we think that we've got it all figured out is the moment God can't use us because he's wanting us to surrender every aspect of Our Lives to him amen and I find myself as often as I possibly can you know just praying that prayer Lord just teach me teach me to yield further and so many times it can be a um it can be a bumpy road because you know we have to go through trials and we have to go through these things and it's our growth and sometimes we don't completely understand the way that you know that we're that we're supposed to go but the lord always has a plan in mind he always has a a road that we must travel scripture says you know he doesn't want your strength it's because it's in my weaknesses that he has made strong and if if we really want to grow we have to really start asking ourselves the tough questions and you know as as I'm speaking on this I I'm just pointing to myself and I don't have anybody in mind except for myself you know Lord expose the flaws in my life there's so many things there's so many hindrances that we have and you know the big things the devil can't get us on the big things if we're True Believers and if we're born of the spirit of God but he gets us in those small hindrances in our lives and we have those complexes and we have those flaws and we have those habits and we have those you know maybe those vices in our lives that are that are that are the small things you know and so many times it's the Lord just needs that that full surrender of your heart the whole heart he doesn't want just you know 90 or 95 percent he wants to bring all of those things to light how do we how do we let ourselves um be such a hindrance in our own walk with Christ many times you know I hate even giving the devil all the credit in things when it comes to our trials and a lot of times it's just ourselves we just get in the way of ourselves we have those flaws we have those things the complexes that come we have the the uh the hindrances the habits whatever it is those small things and we just put them in the corner and say that those things are going to be okay you know it's just it's just I'm a human but the Lord wants to bring us into a state of full maturity amen and that's the place that I want to be this morning I want to be in a place of full maturity in the word of God sometimes we can just be so afraid to bring those things to light though because it's a difficult thing to bring to bring those small things to the Lord because it's it's a difficult thing to face Amen to that song just the more that I Surrender the lighter my load you know the the more that I release my cares the more he takes control and the more that I humble myself the more that he lifts me up amen and a true humility true biblical humility teaches us that you know there those small things in our life he wants all of it so that he can get rid of that and bring us to where we need to be God provided a perfect sacrifice to perfect the imperfectible amen we don't we don't we need to have the the attitude of of Mary you know where she said to be it unto me according to Thy word you know if you look at the the scripture there in in the Book of Luke you had an angel that visited two individuals you had an angel that visited Zechariah which was a priest at the time and told her to told him hey you know you your prayer has been answered and and you've been praying this prayer for a long time and your wife is gonna she's gonna be uh she's gonna have a baby and that baby is going to be the one that foreruns the Savior and he couldn't completely wrap his mind around it even though he had been praying that prayer most of his life because his wife was Barren he had been praying that prayer he was a priest of God he knew the scriptures he knew he had read about Abraham and how he did it with Sarah but yet he didn't have that within him to say to be it unto me he was trying to figure it out himself amen a lot of times we're like that we try to figure out things ourselves when when the Lord just needs us to say hey look you're gonna I'm gonna figure it out for you so to contrast you know Mary when that angel came to Mary and said these things which was a similar it was a similar thing you know but this was even a greater you know the the Lord is going to come through you and how she didn't ask how she just said be it unto me according to Thy word that's what that's how just simply taking him it has word you know we don't understand how that we're going to move forward through this thing or why we're going through this trial or why this circumstance is facing us but when we can just be like Mary and not like Zechariah to say Lord be it unto me whatever you have in store and just lay those things down amen in the message uh how can I overcome in 1963 brother Brown says now don't struggle not him that willeth or him that runeth but God just let God just yield yourselves to him and walk on with a perfect satisfied faith that what God has promised he is able to perform amen not joining one denomination or another denomination and running this or that or the other just trying this just yield yourself to God and walk with him peaceful quiet not interrupted just keep on walking with him that's right I took some notes on a service um that I went I was able to go to a Minister's or a men's meeting I'm sorry a men's meeting back and the minister was talking on Second Corinthians 2 11 speaking of excuse me not being ignorant of Satan's devices you know we realize you know as Believers as I was saying that the devil uses different devices with us than he would use with the world Amen he works in the things in our life that we don't think are big things he works on the small things in our life speaking on yielding this morning keep that in your mind James 5 16 States confess confess your faults one to another and pray for one another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much yielding to God means taking every word a sincere confession amen an honest confession one to another and it can be if it can be very difficult to confess confess a mistake to someone but when you start to shutting those things out Pride can actually set in and it can cause us to get into a worse day and get farther away from God so that small thing has now turned into a great hindrance and now the enemy because that pride is set in the enemy has an inlet and that's how the enemy Works to get into the life of a believer you know the only like I said The only person I have in mind on teaching this is me I just the Lord was dealing with me on this and he wants us to yield all everything even the Small Things our vices our habits this commentary that I was reading on that scripture despise not the day of small things it says many of God's choice workers he uses a powerful season of small things these days are not a mistake nor are they punishment they are days of Priceless shaping and preparation they are not days to despise when Satan tempts us to despise the day of small things he shines as an outstanding liar because Satan does not despise the day of small things Satan fears the day of small things in our life because he sees what great things God does in them and through them and brings out of them Hallelujah and on the other side of that some of the big biggest hindrances in our daily walk with the Lord is that we let those small things you know creep into our hearts and then we become almost ignorant as what the scripture says ignorant of Satan's devices because we allow he we allow just a small portion of ourselves to the enemy amen we're reading back into Ruth I opened up with Ruth and it's a familiar reading but I just want to cover this you know it's a Sunday school topic amen I want to open up and um in verse 1 of chapter one of Ruth it says now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was a lemon lack in the name of his wife Naomi and the name of his two sons melon and Chilean ephriites of Bethlehem Judah and they came into the country of mohab and continued there and a limit like Naomi's husband died and she was left in her two sons and they took them wives of the woman of Moab and the name of the one was orfa and the name of the other was Ruth Ruth and they dwelled there about 10 years and melon and Chilean died also both of them and the woman was left of her two sons and her two husbands we read of a time now where it says that the judges were ruling Israel and this was a this was a time a period characterized by the phase uh the phrase that everyone did what was right in their own sight right so it doesn't it doesn't tell us much about Naomi's husband or her two sons other than that they left the land of promise and that they died you know and like I said it's a it's a familiar story but I really want to focus in on Ruth's willingness to yield in Ruth 1 verses 6 through 9 and she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of mohab for she had heard in the country of Moab how the Lord had visited his people and giving them bread and she went forth out of the place where she was her two daughters-in-law and they went on the way to return to Judah and Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law go return to each of her mother's house the Lord deal kindly with you as ye have dealt with the dead and with me the Lord grant you that you may find rest each of you in the house of her husband and they lifted up their voice and wept and they said unto her surely we will return unto thee and Naomi said turn again my daughters why will you go with me are there any yet more sons in my womb we read this earlier and as they in verse 14 as they lifted up their voice they wept again and orfa kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth claved unto her notice that all of all of them were dealing with grief and tragedy of of a circumstance at this time all of them lost their husbands Naomi lost their husband and then you know ten years later she lost her two sons and felt as if the land the the hand of the Lord had actually gone gone out against her it says but the Lord has a way of using our circumstances to bring us back to him right I was reading another commentary Naomi wasn't bitter against God she was returning back to her land of promise sometimes when we seek the leadership of the Lord he will take things from us so that we can get back to the land of promise right there are a few different directions I can go here but I want to focus here on verses 14 through 18. where where there was Ruth Ruth and orpha and there was these two and they had their mother-in-law and they both had a desire in their hearts to stay with their mother-in-law looking at the the spiritual standpoint here right they both had that desire sometimes we have the Christian feeling in our hearts right we have a genuine love for the Lord we have a genuine love for his word but the Lord is looking at what you're going to do with those desires right he's looking at a true willingness to yield yourself to the Lord Jesus a true willingness to yield your God will be my God is what she said obviously Ruth had seen that Naomi had lived her life to God and decided to forsake her God she forsook her lands and yielded to the true God the com the commentator makes a statement here that I love not to glorify ourselves but sometimes your trust in God and turning towards him in tough times yielding to him no matter your situation will often be the thing that draws others to the Lord wow let that be our lives this morning amen I'm just running out of time so let me just um you know uh shows that even that no Naomi had the the had been a Believer the entirety of her time in Moab 10 plus years but Ruth in that time had never made any kind of allegiance to her God the god of Israel but yet as soon as Naomi stood and said I'm going back to the god of Israel I'll put my fate in his hands finally she came to a place of total yielding right and Spurgeon picks this up and says if you think that you'll persuade your friends maybe this is for the young people maybe it's for the old people and maybe it's for all of us but maybe if you think that you'll persuade your friends or relatives to Jesus by your compromise you were mistaken perhaps you are sincere but you are still mistaken only a bold stand for Jesus will really do it Hallelujah you will never win any soul to the right by compromise with the wrong it is a decision for Christ and his truth that has the greatest power in the family and the greatest power in the world Amen I just want this this simple study to just pull on our heartstrings this morning and I want to be able to to look at the circumstances in our lives and be able to look at what Ruth had and what her sister-in-law had they both had a desire in their hearts to be with the Mother-in-law they both had a desire in their hearts to let's just look at a spiritual we both have a desire in our hearts to serve the Lord we have these things in our hearts that we have desires we come to church we try to do the right things but the Lord is looking for us to yield completely in all those situations he's looking for a total surrender so that he can lead every aspect of Our Lives he doesn't want just a Christian feeling in our lives he doesn't want just a just a confession he wants a confession and a move forward amen he wants us to to to master the small things in our life through yielding to him I pray that we can just seek be quick to seek forgiveness and always make it right to be accountable for what we do and to deal with and this is a tough thing but to deal with the uncomfortable things in our life the small things that hinder our walk with the Lord brother Branham speaks on uh you know hearing recognizing and acting upon the word you hear the word amen we sit in church and we hear the word as we grow up and and we recognize that this is the truth that we recognize that this is this is the hour that we're living in but now it's our duty to act upon it Hallelujah if we leave today I just want us to all just be able to start praying that prayer Lord help me to yield and it's got to go further than just a desire in your hearts it takes acting upon the word who who's which of the daughter-in-laws will you choose to be this morning will you choose to be Ruth who who the one on who the Redeemer chooses or will you choose to be the one who stays in Moab Amen brother Benham says you know God create and this is recognizing your day in its message God create within me a Revival let me be the Revival Let each one of us be the Revival make me Lord to hunger make me to thirst create in me Lord what is needed in me wow let me from this hour on be thine more consecrated a better servant more blessed of you more able more humble more kind more willing to work more looking to the things that are positive and forgetting the things that are in the past the negatives let me press toward the mark of the High Calling of Jesus Christ created me says created me Lord what is needed in me what a statement I pray that prayer this morning as we just can stand to our feet stand to our feet this morning create Within Me Lord what is needed in me a willingness to yield and more looking on the things that are are positive and and allowing the small things to come to the surface and being able to to recognize and act upon the word of God Amen let's just bow our hearts this morning Heavenly Father Lord God we just so are so grateful and thankful for the word Lord Jesus we thank you for Lord just how you work in our lives and father we just dedicate now this word unto you father we pray that you would go into the Lord the Nook and crannies of our heart father God and

act upon the desire and to move forward in it Lord Jesus we pray father we thank you we dedicate Lord the people unto you we pray over the the service Lord Jesus and we pray that your anointing would
