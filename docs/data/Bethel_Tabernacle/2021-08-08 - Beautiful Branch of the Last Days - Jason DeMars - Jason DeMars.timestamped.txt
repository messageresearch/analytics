[26:27] [Music]
[26:36] you may you may ask me
[26:41] why i serve the lord
[26:47] is it just for heaven's gate
[26:55] or to walk those mighty streets
[27:03] and to hear the angels
[27:06] see
[27:11] is it to drink from the fountain
[27:19] that never shall run dry
[27:23] [Music]
[27:26] or just to live forever
[27:30] never and ever
[27:36] [Music]
[27:40] heaven was never
[27:44] promised to me
[27:48] neither god's promise to live
[27:52] eternally it's been worth
[27:56] just having the lord
[27:59] in my life
[28:09] if there were never any
[28:13] streets of gold
[28:17] [Music]
[28:22] it's been worth just having the lord
[28:27] in my life living
[28:30] in a world of darkness you came along
[28:33] and brought
[28:34] me the light
[28:37] you've been my closest friend
[28:40] down through the years
[28:44] and every time i cried dried all my
[28:48] tears and it's been worth
[28:52] just having the lord
[28:55] in my life living in a world of darkness
[29:00] came along and brought me the light
[29:04] i was living in a world of darkness
[29:07] came along and brought me the light
[29:20] hey man won't you stand with me i'm
[29:22] gonna sing a little bit of there's none
[29:24] like
[29:27] [Music]
[29:31] there is
[29:35] [Music]
[29:39] no one else can touch my heart like
[29:43] you do
[29:44] [Music]
[29:47] i could search for all eternity long
[29:53] and fine there is none
[29:57] like
[30:03] there is none like you
[30:11] [Music]
[30:18] i could search for all
[30:21] [Music]
[30:28] [Music]
[30:35] and a lot of sweat a lot of busted
[30:38] knuckles
[30:39] and um a lot of hard work so
[30:42] i would like to say firstly to bear with
[30:44] us
[30:45] we'd like to say that bear with us as
[30:47] the church
[30:48] while the church is under construction
[30:51] we've taken a lot of steps
[30:53] the end of this week to make sure that
[30:55] we can have service
[30:56] today we're going to try to maintain
[30:59] that
[31:01] throughout there's some more
[31:02] construction that we're going to need to
[31:03] do
[31:04] i just like to ask we'd like to ask that
[31:06] you keep your children
[31:08] away from there's some maybe some
[31:10] material that has to be left out
[31:12] different tools and things just whatever
[31:15] they may find just try to be mindful
[31:17] of them so that they wouldn't get hurt
[31:19] you can just hold the music just for one
[31:21] moment
[31:22] just be mindful of them because there
[31:24] are there are nails possibly
[31:26] uh you know that we didn't get to pick
[31:28] up so we'd hate to see
[31:29] something like that or an injury occur
[31:32] so just try to be mindful of that not
[31:35] just today
[31:36] but wednesday when you come to service
[31:38] next weekend we'll do our best to do a
[31:40] clean up
[31:41] and make sure that everything's put away
[31:43] but there are some things
[31:44] you'll notice the church is under
[31:46] construction
[31:47] so some things are not like they were
[31:51] and so just bear with us maybe even not
[31:54] as clean
[31:55] in certain areas as what you would
[31:56] expect we've done cleanup we had carpet
[31:58] cleaners in here
[31:59] there's quite a bit of construction that
[32:01] went on and we did
[32:03] our best that we could to cover you've
[32:05] seen on the church chat the pictures
[32:07] we've done our best to keep things
[32:08] covered up and cleaned up as best we
[32:11] could but you may notice some things
[32:13] here outside in the fellowship hall and
[32:15] you wonder if it's out why it's out of
[32:17] place well
[32:18] because we're under construction we have
[32:19] new windows we've completed a lot
[32:21] but there's a lot more to do and a lot
[32:24] more that we have planned
[32:25] this is phase one of multi-phase
[32:29] uh church renovations and improvements
[32:32] that we've been wanting to do
[32:33] and this phase one includes the windows
[32:36] that you that you see excuse me
[32:40] i'm probably clogged up from cutting all
[32:42] that concrete and the dust from that saw
[32:45] um but this is you'll see the new
[32:47] windows
[32:48] um we're gonna you'll see the windows
[32:50] are have a have a gap there they've been
[32:52] furred out because
[32:54] we're gonna come starting monday and
[32:56] start installing the hardy plank
[32:57] sighting
[32:58] around the entire church and also the
[33:02] landscaping
[33:03] has been completely removed but don't
[33:06] worry it'll go back we'll get new
[33:08] landscaping
[33:09] right now it's going to look sort of
[33:11] barren we have new doors and windows let
[33:13] me just read
[33:13] from some of these notes that i wrote
[33:16] they're going to help significantly
[33:18] these windows will help significantly
[33:19] with
[33:20] the power bill you'll notice the
[33:22] building was even today a lot
[33:24] cooler because the windows help with
[33:26] that the windows we had previous had no
[33:28] r value at all
[33:29] they were literally just plexi class
[33:31] someone had uh
[33:32] went and cut but we're thankful
[33:36] amen for that today i'd like to say
[33:38] thank you to all the brothers we had
[33:40] quite a crew
[33:42] brothers come here and help and if i
[33:44] miss anybody i apologize
[33:46] some helped in in small ways
[33:49] which we needed some helped in very
[33:52] large
[33:53] ways we had brother caleb buckman
[33:57] come out here for a day and my son ethan
[33:59] throughout the project
[34:00] brother mark carter came and helped with
[34:02] some of the finishings
[34:04] around the trim they're not finished i
[34:06] know he's probably dying for me to say
[34:08] this that's just i asked him to do
[34:09] something temporary you know what the
[34:11] mark said
[34:11] that's not that's not a sign of my
[34:14] craftsmanship i promise
[34:15] um i told him we just wanted to do
[34:18] something temporary so it's very
[34:20] temporary it's cut up and you'll see
[34:22] there's it didn't even cover in some
[34:23] places that wasn't our intention to
[34:25] finish it
[34:25] because of the interior renovations it
[34:27] would would not have made sense to spend
[34:29] money on that
[34:30] so it's very temporary just so that we
[34:33] didn't before that was there was raw
[34:34] wood and it just wouldn't have looked
[34:36] right
[34:36] to have service brother john
[34:39] lennochek came and repaired a water line
[34:43] that we hit while we were removing some
[34:44] of the landscaping
[34:46] and he was real crucial there that we
[34:47] had a crew of sisters
[34:49] come here a bunch of them uh come here
[34:52] and help to clean up
[34:53] get this church ready so that you can
[34:55] enjoy it today i just want to say thank
[34:57] you
[34:57] amen to all those who sisters who came
[34:59] sister rosalina
[35:01] who came and cleaned the fellowship paul
[35:04] so that you could enjoy it today
[35:06] and we had just ones we had others who
[35:08] helped in really significant amounts
[35:11] our brother brad yance who's here today
[35:12] who headed up the whole project i want
[35:15] to give him a hand clap
[35:16] a made of appreciation
[35:20] amen the brains uh behind the whole
[35:22] project
[35:23] and so um we might have been the bronze
[35:25] but he was definitely the brains
[35:27] behind it all and gave gave of himself
[35:30] and so the windows and the doors we've
[35:33] also replaced the doors
[35:35] you'll see new doors exterior in the
[35:37] fellowship hall
[35:38] and uh that entry door is getting
[35:41] replaced we just had we ordered it it's
[35:43] a special order
[35:43] item a brand new entry door with
[35:45] transoms above it like it has now
[35:48] the the windows here have been changed
[35:51] you'll notice also
[35:53] the office windows have been changed
[35:55] also the fellowship hall windows
[35:57] have been changed and so all the windows
[35:59] and all the doors
[36:01] were changed out we had a good solid
[36:04] core crew here
[36:05] myself brother jd who's preaching today
[36:09] brother charles brother aaron simmons
[36:12] um and and bella luther jordan came up
[36:15] brother luther also
[36:17] uh came and that that was the team who
[36:19] did most of all the window work
[36:21] and i tell you what it was a lot of work
[36:24] uh
[36:24] cutting that concrete just um you know
[36:27] to get the longer windows and the length
[36:30] to get light in here like we wanted was
[36:33] a lot of work it was a labor
[36:35] quite a labor we're thankful we got it
[36:37] completed
[36:38] um brother aaron drove hours to come
[36:42] multiple days
[36:43] to give of himself and to help out he
[36:45] was a he was a tremendous
[36:48] tremendous help use all that strength
[36:50] amen we put it to good work
[36:52] um and so uh also
[36:56] brother travis who came helped get some
[36:58] of the material you see out here and
[36:59] help with some of the install
[37:01] of the window my wife rachel was worked
[37:03] tirelessly the entire time with clean up
[37:06] carrying out cinder blocks and just
[37:08] anything
[37:09] with cleanup around the grounds to keep
[37:11] things under control
[37:14] also brother caleb campbell and brother
[37:16] don gurgle did a fantastic job
[37:19] with the landscaping not the landscaping
[37:22] but with the grading
[37:23] this was a uh looked like a a war had
[37:26] taken place after we got done removing
[37:28] all the
[37:29] limbs all the bushes and they worked uh
[37:32] man brother don does uh
[37:34] i don't know if he's here there he is
[37:36] did a fine job he should open a
[37:37] landscaping business
[37:39] um they did really i mean that it was it
[37:41] was surprising to all of us brothers who
[37:44] watched
[37:44] uh how meticulous and how good he did
[37:47] him and caleb just grated it looks good
[37:49] believe me what you see now is a massive
[37:52] difference to what it was
[37:54] and they worked really hard to do that
[37:56] so we're grateful for them
[37:59] if i missed any names there i apologize
[38:02] i think there was maybe a few others who
[38:03] came
[38:04] so we'd just like to say thank you i
[38:06] know that you did it out of the goodness
[38:08] of your heart
[38:08] to do something for the lord and i
[38:11] believe that we
[38:12] are blessed because of it can we give a
[38:14] handclap to all those who helped
[38:17] amen
[38:18] [Applause]
[38:25] and also the trim you'll notice here i
[38:27] already mentioned this the trim around
[38:29] the windows
[38:29] is temporary you'll notice some
[38:31] temporary things because we have some
[38:32] more ideas
[38:34] uh later you'll notice there's no dead
[38:36] bolts in these door handles
[38:38] someone asks they will there will be
[38:40] dead bolts we just have to drill those
[38:42] um the two doors we got here didn't have
[38:44] them so there's some things we still
[38:46] need to do you'll notice some trim
[38:48] in the fellowship pawn in the back has
[38:50] not been completed
[38:51] we will get that completed also
[38:55] you'll obviously as we said you'll
[38:57] notice the landscaping has been removed
[39:00] what would because we're adding new
[39:02] hardy plank siding
[39:03] to the entire building and fellowship
[39:06] hall
[39:06] we we're leaving the landscaping as it
[39:09] is obviously it wouldn't make sense to
[39:10] do that now
[39:11] so we're going to do the hardy plank
[39:13] that will start monday
[39:15] morning we'll start shooting the
[39:19] 2x4 treated lumber to the outside of the
[39:21] building
[39:22] you have to have something to nail to to
[39:24] nail the hardy board too
[39:25] so brother brad will be starting that
[39:27] project with a team whoever is available
[39:29] i know it's a work week and i know let
[39:31] me just say i know many more desired to
[39:33] help
[39:34] and be here and it wouldn't be for a
[39:36] lack of desire but because we know this
[39:38] is during the week and people are busy
[39:40] and have businesses and jobs so we
[39:42] understand completely
[39:44] if anyone gets any free time we're
[39:46] working usually
[39:48] a lot of evenings we'll post it we'll
[39:50] work till seven or eight o'clock
[39:51] so if you have time and you want to come
[39:53] over and give a hand
[39:56] uh also if i didn't mention brother
[39:57] charles i thought that i did someone
[39:59] texted me if i didn't mention brother
[40:01] charles brother charles thank you so
[40:03] much
[40:03] uh he was here the entire entire time
[40:07] and passed after we left every single
[40:09] night
[40:10] and uh my goodness i've never brother
[40:12] charles um when i get
[40:14] your age and you're not old but when i
[40:16] get your age i want to be able to work
[40:17] like you work
[40:18] um he just gave of himself and worked
[40:21] really hard he was a key
[40:23] a real key component to what we what we
[40:25] did here
[40:26] uh we're doing hardy plank as i said if
[40:28] i miss anything
[40:30] i'm trying to eliminate some questions
[40:32] and i know i want to eliminate them all
[40:33] the front doors getting replaced as part
[40:36] of this phase
[40:38] there will be new landscaping there will
[40:39] be new hardy siding that will be painted
[40:42] um i believe that's
[40:45] all of phase one fellowship poll
[40:48] uh also gets hardy all the way around
[40:51] for the new windows
[40:53] we have some some desires and
[40:57] some plans for the interior
[41:00] of the church and the fellowship paul
[41:02] but first the church
[41:04] a lot of really um i think plans that
[41:07] would be a great blessing and good
[41:09] improvement the churches
[41:11] um probably could you know some of the
[41:14] uh
[41:14] you know different wood trim and
[41:16] different things we've been appreciative
[41:17] of
[41:18] but we want to uh you know as maybe some
[41:21] of the things some people would think is
[41:23] a little dated
[41:24] so we want to update uh some things i
[41:26] believe update our pastor preached last
[41:28] sunday i think it was on change
[41:29] and how things got to progress and go
[41:31] forward so we want to remove the
[41:33] paneling i'll give you some of these
[41:35] things here
[41:36] we want to remove the paneling that's on
[41:38] the side and drywall as you see in the
[41:40] back
[41:40] and nursery and also back behind me we
[41:43] want to dry
[41:44] all of that this above you above this
[41:48] ceiling is some really serious lumber
[41:51] and that's what i've been told by
[41:53] carpenters who've got in the attic
[41:55] they they did not go cheap when they put
[41:58] the
[41:59] ceiling joists in place and they're
[42:01] about every six or eight feet
[42:03] uh it's real nice big timber bolted
[42:07] together
[42:08] really really nice timber we're wanting
[42:10] to remove this entire
[42:12] ceiling that you see and expose those
[42:15] trusses
[42:16] and make a more vaulted look to the
[42:18] ceiling
[42:19] to take the ceiling fans the lighting
[42:21] that right now obstruct
[42:22] camera views that we're wanting to
[42:24] change with the church camera
[42:26] setup so we're wanting to remove all of
[42:28] that take that up
[42:30] above remove what you see here and
[42:32] expose those trusses
[42:33] we're wanting to install a new heated
[42:35] and cooling system that would cool this
[42:37] place a lot better
[42:39] to we're wanting to spray foam the the
[42:42] attic
[42:42] area the ceiling to also add insulation
[42:46] to help this building
[42:48] run more efficient we're going to be
[42:51] replacing the carpet with new commercial
[42:53] more industrial carpet
[42:54] something that would hold up a little
[42:55] better both on the stage and here
[42:58] those are the majors i could say some of
[43:01] the majors that we're wanting to do
[43:04] to change some things that we think
[43:06] would be a great improvement
[43:08] all of those things that i just
[43:11] mentioned here this morning
[43:13] the church has done the church out of
[43:15] the general fund has paid for and
[43:17] financed
[43:18] all of everything you see and everything
[43:19] you're gonna see on phase one
[43:21] we won't do that with phase two or phase
[43:24] three which would be fellowship hall
[43:25] additions and remove and um
[43:27] renovations so we're wanting to and i
[43:30] got the pastoral authority to announce
[43:32] this here today
[43:33] um or else i wouldn't be doing it but we
[43:34] wanted to announce uh obviously my mom
[43:36] and dad are away in
[43:37] louisiana their brother tim pruitt's
[43:41] with the memorial service there for
[43:42] sister karen today but we wanted to go
[43:45] ahead and announce
[43:46] we're going to have a building fund that
[43:48] you can give towards because
[43:50] all of the improvements that we're
[43:52] wanting to do on the church is going to
[43:53] be
[43:54] several thousand i can tell you we're
[43:55] over 20 000
[43:57] just on the outside phase it's probably
[43:59] going to be that or more with the
[44:01] interior
[44:02] so we need to start a building fund and
[44:04] allow you to give
[44:05] and to fund that with your donations and
[44:08] so that'll that'll be effective today
[44:11] if you want to give towards that you
[44:12] could earmark any offering or anything
[44:14] you want to give towards the building
[44:16] fund
[44:16] and when we reach our budget amount
[44:19] which more details to come on that
[44:21] then we'll commence we'll start the work
[44:23] so we won't start
[44:25] phase two interior until that building
[44:28] fund
[44:28] budget is funded by the church
[44:32] and so we ask you to give we wanted to
[44:34] do some of these renovations on the
[44:36] outside
[44:37] to show you what's possible that we
[44:39] could make the building
[44:40] and the premises really nice but we're
[44:43] going to need it takes money to do that
[44:45] we're going to need that
[44:46] so we're going to have more just a lot
[44:48] more to say on that i just wanted to
[44:50] preliminarily say
[44:52] there is a building fund you could
[44:53] earmark funds today
[44:55] and going forward for the building fund
[44:56] that will go directly into a fund
[44:59] that will uh go to fund the budget and
[45:01] like i said when we reach that amount
[45:04] we'll start some of the interior
[45:07] and we're going to give more details on

[53:55] and grace we ask in jesus precious name
[53:58] amen well i have you standing we're
[54:01] going to
[54:02] go right to the scripture there it is
[54:04] and
[54:05] isaiah chapter 4
[54:08] verse one and two beautiful branch
[54:12] of the last days is my topic
[54:16] and we're pulling that up right now
[54:19] brother matt
[54:28] amen and in that day seven women shall
[54:30] take hold
[54:31] of one man saying we will eat our own
[54:34] bread and wear our own apparel
[54:36] only let us be called by thy name to
[54:38] take away
[54:39] our reproach in that day shall the
[54:42] branch of the lord be beautiful and
[54:44] glorious
[54:45] and the fruit of the earth shall be
[54:47] excellent
[54:48] and comely for them that are escaped of
[54:51] israel may the lord add the blessing to
[54:53] the reading of his word he can be seated
[54:55] just want to welcome some of our
[54:58] visitors
[54:59] i see a few faces that i don't recognize
[55:02] i know brother tony mentioned to me that
[55:05] they had a guest sister dana and
[55:08] her children welcome appreciate having
[55:10] you
[55:11] and i know there's a few others brother
[55:13] brad sorry you're not a guest anymore
[55:18] you're one of us amen so i'm going to
[55:21] continue
[55:21] on this topic that i spoke about last
[55:25] week
[55:26] the beautiful branch of the lord
[55:30] so we see in verse 1 there in isaiah
[55:34] it says in that day seven women will
[55:37] take hold of one man saying
[55:39] we'll eat our own bread we'll wear our
[55:41] own apparel
[55:43] only give us your name to take away our
[55:46] reproach and and if you remember i
[55:49] spoke um on that wednesday night
[55:53] and i for some reason began to
[55:56] hit against feminism and the spirit of
[55:59] feminism that's on the world
[56:03] today right and so you see this
[56:06] these women they just want to be called
[56:08] by the man's name but they want to do
[56:09] their own
[56:10] thing they want to provide their own
[56:12] means they want to wear
[56:14] whatever they want to wear without
[56:16] consideration of
[56:18] god's program god's purpose for
[56:21] women god has
[56:26] a purpose for women god has a purpose
[56:30] for man he has a pro he has a program
[56:33] there's something called biblical
[56:34] manhood
[56:35] and biblical womanhood and guess what
[56:39] it's different
[56:42] guess what men and women
[56:45] are different i know it's blowing your
[56:49] mind
[56:51] men are not the same as women women are
[56:54] not the same
[56:55] as men
[56:58] now there was some questions nothing
[57:00] negative but just
[57:02] some clarifications on as i was talking
[57:05] about
[57:06] feminism last week and maybe some of the
[57:08] younger people what in the world is
[57:10] feminism what's that all about
[57:12] i want to talk about that a little bit i
[57:14] want to clarify that i also want to
[57:16] clarify
[57:17] when i'm saying i'm attacking feminism
[57:20] immediately you know what if a worldly
[57:22] person is listening in
[57:24] here or on the internet you can
[57:27] understand
[57:28] a little bit about what i'm saying and
[57:30] what i'm not saying
[57:33] so my attack against feminism
[57:36] is attacking the idea that we're
[57:39] blurring the lines
[57:41] between the roles of men and women
[57:46] my attack is against the belief that
[57:49] the husband is not the head of the wife
[57:52] my attack is against the belief that
[57:55] women are exactly the same
[57:57] as men in every way if they are i will
[58:00] just wonder why
[58:02] uh lebron james doesn't have a woman on
[58:05] his team
[58:08] their bodies are different our bodies
[58:10] are different our strength is different
[58:13] lots of things a man thinks differently
[58:15] than a woman
[58:17] all of these god made us different
[58:20] getting ahead of myself a little bit but
[58:22] he made us to complement
[58:24] one another we are when god made man
[58:27] in his image and likeness he made
[58:31] them male and female together
[58:34] male and female complete the image
[58:38] of god there's two aspects
[58:42] to that different roles made differently
[58:45] for different purposes and god sets
[58:48] forth in his word what that will be
[58:50] you and i don't have to have a right to
[58:53] redefine it
[58:55] we ha what we do is we try to live our
[58:58] lives not we try to we do
[59:01] there's no not trying we live our lives
[59:04] in submission to the word of god in the
[59:07] hour
[59:08] that we live in also my attack
[59:11] against feminism is because of the
[59:14] sexualization of women
[59:17] and the sexual revolution
[59:20] i'm against it i'm attacking it now
[59:24] what i'm not doing i'm not advocating
[59:27] sexual harassment i'm not advocating
[59:31] treating a woman like an object
[59:34] i'm so a thousand percent against that
[59:37] i'm not advocating blaming rape or
[59:41] sexual assault on women that's not right
[59:45] oh she dressed in such in such a way yes
[59:48] she has a responsibility
[59:49] but the man has done it and he's guilty
[59:53] and he needs to be treated he needs to
[59:54] be put to death
[1:00:04] i'm not i'm not playing this blame game
[1:00:08] on the woman i'm also not advocating a
[1:00:11] view that says women
[1:00:13] are not equal to men women are
[1:00:16] equal to men i'm also not
[1:00:19] advocating a view that says women are
[1:00:21] not as
[1:00:22] valuable as men i don't i don't believe
[1:00:26] that
[1:00:26] i don't agree with that the scripture
[1:00:28] doesn't teach that
[1:00:30] it teaches that men and women are equal
[1:00:32] and that they have different
[1:00:34] roles and they have different
[1:00:37] purposes in expressing the image and
[1:00:40] likeness
[1:00:41] of god and when
[1:00:45] a woman finds her role role and place
[1:00:48] and is fulfilling it according to the
[1:00:50] word of god
[1:00:51] it is a beautiful thing
[1:00:54] and when a man finds his position and
[1:00:58] place
[1:00:58] in the word of god and is living it it's
[1:01:01] a beautiful thing
[1:01:02] both you can find scripture that's
[1:01:05] saying
[1:01:05] putting the blame on women and that's
[1:01:08] true
[1:01:09] why because eve was the first one that
[1:01:11] sinned that's a fact
[1:01:14] you can't change that it's a fact
[1:01:17] but adam has the responsibility in it
[1:01:21] too
[1:01:21] why it doesn't it says when adam sinned
[1:01:24] we all sinned
[1:01:26] right it doesn't say when you've sinned
[1:01:28] we all sinned
[1:01:29] it says when adam sinned we all
[1:01:33] sinned he had the responsibility to lead
[1:01:36] his home and to take care of his home
[1:01:40] and the fact is the reality is he did
[1:01:42] not do that
[1:01:44] his wife was deceived and stepped out it
[1:01:46] was his duty to protect
[1:01:48] because god made him first
[1:01:52] amen alright so
[1:02:00] brother branham in recognizing your day
[1:02:04] and its message says you know the bible
[1:02:05] said that those who escape
[1:02:07] out of this great great damnation will
[1:02:10] be a beautiful branch before the lord
[1:02:13] someday i'll get to it lord willing
[1:02:17] for it for you women let you see what
[1:02:20] god thinks of the woman
[1:02:22] that really escapes this damnation of
[1:02:24] this day
[1:02:25] said she would be beautiful
[1:02:28] amen amen and you know the natural
[1:02:31] always types of spiritual the condition
[1:02:33] of the woman
[1:02:35] in the world reveals the condition
[1:02:39] of the church world the condition of
[1:02:42] a woman the women in a local church
[1:02:45] reveal the spiritual condition of
[1:02:49] the church right it
[1:02:52] because what does it do it's revealing
[1:02:54] the leadership
[1:02:56] it's revealing the leadership of the
[1:02:58] local church it's really revealing the
[1:03:00] leadership
[1:03:01] of the men or lack thereof
[1:03:04] in the local church and so
[1:03:08] the all these things that we're talking
[1:03:09] about here
[1:03:11] um there's a there's a reflection
[1:03:13] there's a there's a there's
[1:03:14] back and forth a woman is is going to
[1:03:17] reflect
[1:03:19] her on her husband husband's character
[1:03:21] is going to reflect
[1:03:22] on his wife the leadership is back and
[1:03:24] forth if a man leads correctly
[1:03:28] his his wife will enjoy the leadership
[1:03:32] that he provides
[1:03:34] she'll appreciate it because it'll make
[1:03:36] her feel
[1:03:37] safe and fulfilled but if he leads
[1:03:40] incorrectly
[1:03:41] she'll want to rebel against it and say
[1:03:43] i don't like this
[1:03:45] i don't like the whole concept of man
[1:03:48] leading
[1:03:49] no you just don't like what your husband
[1:03:51] is doing
[1:03:52] you don't like how your husband's
[1:03:53] behaving and probably you're right
[1:04:01] so what what am i talking about there is
[1:04:03] a beautiful branch
[1:04:04] of the lord in the last day
[1:04:07] and there's sisters that are an
[1:04:10] expression of that
[1:04:11] sisters in part that are a part of that
[1:04:13] there's a body it's made up of
[1:04:16] men and women there's gifts in that body
[1:04:19] because every person that's in that body
[1:04:21] is filled with the holy ghost
[1:04:22] right and so men and women
[1:04:26] are equal co-heirs of the grace of life
[1:04:30] they're
[1:04:30] they're they're both heirs a woman is
[1:04:33] not a heir through the man
[1:04:35] she's directly an heir of
[1:04:38] god just like the man is all right
[1:04:41] she has the holy ghost she can have
[1:04:44] gifts of the spirit as well in her life
[1:04:47] just as
[1:04:48] he can a she's not scripturally
[1:04:52] there's no such thing as a deaconess
[1:04:55] or a bishop s or a pastor s
[1:05:01] there's not a position of leadership
[1:05:04] in the local church for a woman that's
[1:05:06] just scripture i suffer not
[1:05:08] a woman to teach or use usurp
[1:05:11] authority over a man over a man
[1:05:14] she's not in that position and when you
[1:05:16] look at the leadership position
[1:05:17] that paul is saying ordained deacons
[1:05:20] ordained elders
[1:05:22] it's always a man that's ordained to do
[1:05:25] that
[1:05:26] right it's not it's never spoken of as a
[1:05:28] woman she's not ordained to be in a
[1:05:30] leadership
[1:05:31] position in the local church neither is
[1:05:34] she
[1:05:35] ordained to be the leader of a home
[1:05:38] of a family she's a leader of the family
[1:05:41] she's a manager of the home but she's
[1:05:44] not the leader
[1:05:46] the head of the woman is the man
[1:05:50] again who is the head of the church
[1:05:56] christ is the head of the church he is a
[1:05:58] what
[1:05:59] a man he's a male
[1:06:02] the the bride is not the head of herself
[1:06:06] the pastor is not the head of the church
[1:06:08] now you have a woman
[1:06:10] in charge of the women that's not how it
[1:06:12] works
[1:06:14] christ is the head of the church
[1:06:17] his word is what flows down
[1:06:20] to us through the ministry but yet that
[1:06:23] ministry is what
[1:06:26] the bride the bride it's it's female
[1:06:30] and so in this day we have what
[1:06:33] a bride the bride is supposed to come
[1:06:36] into
[1:06:36] what maturity she's supposed to grow
[1:06:40] she's supposed to have come to a place
[1:06:42] where she is without
[1:06:44] spot or wrinkle
[1:06:48] all right ephesians 4 11 through 14
[1:06:52] and he gave some apostles and some
[1:06:53] prophets and some evangelists some
[1:06:55] pastors and teachers
[1:06:57] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[1:06:58] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:07:00] the body of christ
[1:07:02] till we all come in the unity of the
[1:07:04] faith
[1:07:05] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[1:07:07] okay so this is god's
[1:07:09] purpose in the in the last days he said
[1:07:13] he would have a beautiful
[1:07:14] branch he would have a beautiful branch
[1:07:16] in the last days he would have
[1:07:18] a woman a bride for christ
[1:07:21] that would come to this place unto a
[1:07:24] perfect
[1:07:25] man and to the measure of the stature of
[1:07:27] the fullness of christ that we
[1:07:28] henceforth be no more
[1:07:30] children tossed to and fro and carried
[1:07:32] about with every wind of doctrine by the
[1:07:33] slight of men
[1:07:35] and cunning craftiness whereby they lie
[1:07:37] in wait to deceive
[1:07:38] but speaking the truth and love may grow
[1:07:40] up into him in all things which is the
[1:07:42] head
[1:07:43] even christ from whom the whole body
[1:07:45] fitly joined together and compacted by
[1:07:47] that which every joint supplyeth
[1:07:49] according to the effectual working in
[1:07:51] the measure of every part
[1:07:53] make it makes increase of the body unto
[1:07:55] the edifying of
[1:07:57] itself in love so you see
[1:08:00] that he he restored the word of god
[1:08:04] to us in this day the truth of the
[1:08:06] gospel in this day
[1:08:08] to do what to bring us to a place of
[1:08:12] maturity to bring us to the place where
[1:08:15] we have the measure of the stature of
[1:08:17] the fullness
[1:08:18] of christ that's existing in that
[1:08:20] beautiful
[1:08:22] branch amen ephesians 5
[1:08:25] 25-27 husbands love your wives even as
[1:08:28] christ also loved the church
[1:08:30] and gave himself for it that he might
[1:08:32] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[1:08:34] of water
[1:08:35] by the word that he might present it to
[1:08:37] himself a glorious church
[1:08:39] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:08:42] thing but that it should be holy
[1:08:44] and without blemish so again on one side
[1:08:48] you have
[1:08:48] seven women taking hold of one man say
[1:08:51] give us your name
[1:08:53] so we don't have a reproach upon us but
[1:08:56] let us eat our own food and wear
[1:08:58] wear our own clothes what is it there's
[1:09:01] a spirit of feminism
[1:09:03] on the land but there's also a spirit
[1:09:08] of christ in a bride and she's without
[1:09:12] spot
[1:09:12] or wrinkle she's clean holy
[1:09:15] virtuous she's set apart
[1:09:18] she's a ver she's the very expression
[1:09:22] of christ to this world she's not tossed
[1:09:25] about
[1:09:26] she's not going from one place to
[1:09:28] another place she knows
[1:09:30] who her husband is and she's faithful
[1:09:34] to him she's chased she's totally
[1:09:37] dedicated
[1:09:39] to him she doesn't need to dress sexy to
[1:09:42] attract
[1:09:44] fools and she's drunk with the blood of
[1:09:47] the martyrs
[1:09:48] and she's committed fornication with the
[1:09:50] kings of the earth the other one she's
[1:09:52] totally
[1:09:53] separated to her husband she's wearing
[1:09:57] white she's wearing linen clean
[1:10:01] and white a humble garment
[1:10:04] but a garment that's expressing what's
[1:10:06] on the inside
[1:10:08] amen a purity and same thing for
[1:10:11] sisters you're to express what you wear
[1:10:14] on the outside
[1:10:16] should express the purity that you have
[1:10:19] on the inside amen
[1:10:24] first peter 3 7.
[1:10:28] likewise your husbands
[1:10:32] dwell with them according to knowledge
[1:10:36] so what knowledge am i supposed to dwell
[1:10:39] with them
[1:10:40] with you see that dwell with them
[1:10:43] according
[1:10:44] to knowledge what knowledge giving honor
[1:10:47] to the wife
[1:10:48] okay so we're to give honor to our wives
[1:10:52] why as unto the weaker vessel
[1:10:56] uh oh it's not politically correct
[1:11:02] youtube and facebook are shutting us
[1:11:03] down
[1:11:05] the weaker of the woman is the weaker
[1:11:08] vessel
[1:11:10] what does that mean she's dumber than
[1:11:12] men
[1:11:15] she has less artistic ability than men
[1:11:21] well it used to be a viewpoint it used
[1:11:23] to be thing that people thought
[1:11:25] it's not it's not true in fact uh
[1:11:29] the younger girls are smarter than the
[1:11:32] boys that their age
[1:11:34] everybody everybody's aware of that but
[1:11:36] let's put it this way
[1:11:38] there's an intruder that comes in the
[1:11:39] house
[1:11:41] in the middle of the night who's the one
[1:11:43] that should get up
[1:11:44] honey you're better with a pistol than
[1:11:46] me why don't you
[1:11:48] why don't you guys why don't you go
[1:11:49] ahead and see what's going on there
[1:11:51] i'm going to hide out in in this closet
[1:11:54] over here
[1:11:54] you big
[1:11:58] god designed you man to be a protector
[1:12:02] of a woman not a defeater
[1:12:06] and a destroyer of women he gave you
[1:12:09] strength to protect
[1:12:11] to guard for safe keeping
[1:12:15] it made the woman the weaker vessel
[1:12:18] because she's a type
[1:12:19] of the bride and christ are we stronger
[1:12:23] than christ
[1:12:24] not one of us not one of us is so he
[1:12:28] made
[1:12:28] the man to be stronger to
[1:12:31] as a protection of the woman so so peter
[1:12:35] is saying dwell with your wives
[1:12:38] according to knowledge
[1:12:40] what knowledge she's a weaker vessel
[1:12:43] one she's a weaker vessel this should
[1:12:45] cause
[1:12:46] holy ghost men to wake up and say
[1:12:50] oh she's weaker than me
[1:12:53] i'm i'm i'm here to protect and care
[1:12:57] and nurture and cherish this woman who
[1:13:00] is weaker than me
[1:13:02] okay so that's number one that's the no
[1:13:04] first p piece of knowledge that we have
[1:13:06] to
[1:13:07] no have second piece is
[1:13:11] okay now don't get so big-headed
[1:13:14] guy that you're the stronger vessel
[1:13:17] next thing he says you are heirs
[1:13:20] together that means
[1:13:21] joint heirs of the grace
[1:13:25] of life this is
[1:13:28] a startling revelation in that
[1:13:32] hour why because women were always
[1:13:35] considered in the spiritual aspect of
[1:13:38] things to be
[1:13:40] through their husband everything was
[1:13:43] through their husband
[1:13:44] even a lot of times in in jewish faith
[1:13:47] basic knowledge was confined there was
[1:13:50] knowledge that was only for women
[1:13:52] and outside of that they didn't need to
[1:13:54] know anything right
[1:13:57] peter is setting dynamite
[1:14:00] to that idea idea you are joint
[1:14:03] heirs of the grace of life
[1:14:06] her connection in christ there's neither
[1:14:09] male nor female
[1:14:10] now he's not saying that's galatians 3
[1:14:13] 28.
[1:14:14] there's neither male nor female bond or
[1:14:16] free
[1:14:18] jew or gentile the fact is the person is
[1:14:21] a jew
[1:14:22] the fact is the person's a gentile the
[1:14:24] fact is the person's a male
[1:14:25] the fact is the person's a female the
[1:14:27] fact is the person's a slave
[1:14:29] the fact is the person is an owner
[1:14:32] that's a fact
[1:14:33] but he's what is he saying in christ
[1:14:35] there's not
[1:14:36] accep there's not different layers of
[1:14:38] access to
[1:14:39] to the gospel to salvation
[1:14:42] it's free to men directly to men
[1:14:46] directly to women and it even says
[1:14:50] in peter says you can
[1:14:53] without the word by
[1:14:56] your behavior win your unbelieving
[1:14:59] husband
[1:15:00] to salvation all right
[1:15:04] so we're joint heirs together
[1:15:08] so he's saying this glory of god that
[1:15:10] you have
[1:15:11] in this vessel you man being the
[1:15:14] stronger
[1:15:15] her being the weaker yet inside that
[1:15:18] vessel
[1:15:19] is a glory
[1:15:23] is the holy ghost you equally
[1:15:26] possess this holy ghost
[1:15:30] and so have this knowledge when you live
[1:15:33] with your wife
[1:15:34] have this knowledge when how you treat
[1:15:36] her how you act towards her
[1:15:38] understand you're a protector
[1:15:42] you're a nurturer you're a cherisher
[1:15:44] this is what that's scripture
[1:15:48] it says no man hated his own body but
[1:15:51] nourishes and cherishes as does
[1:15:54] christ the church so as husbands we do
[1:15:58] the same
[1:15:59] we're to nourish and cherish our
[1:16:02] wives and we're to be the protector of
[1:16:05] them
[1:16:05] understanding that they're equal to us
[1:16:09] in christ let that sink in message
[1:16:12] brothers
[1:16:13] she's not a doormat she's not less than
[1:16:17] you
[1:16:18] she's not less valuable than you
[1:16:21] you're not a you're not above her in
[1:16:23] god's program
[1:16:25] god's pro what did jesus do when he was
[1:16:28] raised from the dead
[1:16:30] he didn't have peter james and john his
[1:16:32] inner
[1:16:33] his inner inner circle meet him did he
[1:16:37] he had a woman what was he trying to say
[1:16:40] he says to me a woman's testimony is
[1:16:43] just as valuable as a man's testimony
[1:16:46] in the middle east today today
[1:16:49] a woman's testimony is worth either a
[1:16:52] half or a fourth
[1:16:54] of what a man's testimony is you have to
[1:16:56] get four women to witness
[1:16:58] a crime in order for that person to be
[1:17:03] convicted but one man could witness it
[1:17:06] no problem
[1:17:13] all right
[1:17:20] proverbs 31 10 through
[1:17:24] 15.
[1:17:27] who can find a virtuous woman for her
[1:17:29] price
[1:17:30] is far above rubies
[1:17:34] the heart of her husband does safely
[1:17:36] trust in her
[1:17:38] so that he shall have no need of spoil
[1:17:41] she will do him good and not evil all
[1:17:43] the days of her life
[1:17:45] she seeks wool the picture that i'm
[1:17:48] getting here of this woman
[1:17:50] is a picture of the person that's
[1:17:52] entrusted
[1:17:54] with 10 10 talents remember the parable
[1:17:57] he's given ten talents instead of the
[1:17:59] person with one just buries the talent
[1:18:01] comes back with one this woman is given
[1:18:04] ten talents and she multiplies them
[1:18:07] that's the picture that i'm seeing she
[1:18:08] will do him good and not evil all the
[1:18:10] days of her life
[1:18:11] she seeks wool and flax and works
[1:18:14] willingly
[1:18:15] with her hands she is like the merchant
[1:18:18] ships she brings her
[1:18:19] food from afar okay what does that mean
[1:18:23] she seeks wool flax works willingly with
[1:18:26] her hands
[1:18:28] she she she imports she
[1:18:32] she imports but she also exports that's
[1:18:34] what it's saying
[1:18:36] whenever she wants to import something
[1:18:38] she has something of equal value that
[1:18:40] she's exporting
[1:18:42] in other words she's a person of wisdom
[1:18:45] when her family has a need
[1:18:46] she sees those needs are there and she's
[1:18:49] already
[1:18:51] done something to provide for and take
[1:18:54] care of that
[1:18:55] need now understand
[1:18:59] proverbs 31 what are we looking at
[1:19:02] you know how how do we how do we relate
[1:19:06] this to our society today
[1:19:10] right i think a few screens ahead i'm
[1:19:13] going to skip
[1:19:15] yeah just to give a picture
[1:19:18] cultures change right but the word of
[1:19:22] god
[1:19:23] never changes and so god doesn't say
[1:19:26] well
[1:19:27] back in the bible times women had this
[1:19:29] role but now the time has changed so
[1:19:31] forget that nonsense no it doesn't say
[1:19:34] that
[1:19:35] we as believers by the holy ghost
[1:19:38] in our current culture that we have
[1:19:40] today
[1:19:42] have to walk in obedience to the
[1:19:44] principles
[1:19:45] that god sets forward and be sure that
[1:19:47] we're not
[1:19:48] under the influence of
[1:19:52] worldly demonic spirits the things i'm
[1:19:54] going to talk about today i have no
[1:19:57] person in this room in mind what i have
[1:20:00] in mind
[1:20:01] is the spirit of this age the spirit of
[1:20:04] feminism
[1:20:05] in this age that is so corrupting the
[1:20:08] minds it's everywhere
[1:20:10] if anything i have in mind is over the
[1:20:12] last 10 years
[1:20:14] seeing facebook posts where message
[1:20:16] believers are have been heavily
[1:20:18] under the influence of modern day
[1:20:21] feminist thought if that's anything that
[1:20:24] i have in mind
[1:20:25] that's what i have in mind nobody's life
[1:20:27] here i'm not thinking about
[1:20:29] your life what you're doing this is a
[1:20:31] principle
[1:20:32] in god's word and i want to encourage
[1:20:34] all of us to not be under the influence
[1:20:37] of the evil spirits in this age but to
[1:20:40] under
[1:20:40] under the influence and leadership of
[1:20:42] the holy ghost by the word of god
[1:20:45] so all of human history up until like
[1:20:49] the seven
[1:20:49] mid 1700s it was agrarian societies that
[1:20:53] means they were farming societies
[1:20:55] divided into basically landowners and
[1:20:58] lower classes it's more complicated than
[1:21:00] that but just
[1:21:01] for simplification purposes that's what
[1:21:04] the world was like
[1:21:05] people had land they had servants
[1:21:08] they had people that helped them and
[1:21:11] assisted them
[1:21:12] with that land so when we're looking at
[1:21:14] proverbs 31
[1:21:16] what are we talking about we're talking
[1:21:18] about
[1:21:20] someone who owns land and property
[1:21:23] has servants etc there is a there is a
[1:21:27] picture that's being placed there
[1:21:28] so we have to understand the picture and
[1:21:31] see it in our
[1:21:32] day and age and we can't dislocate it
[1:21:36] from
[1:21:36] the rest of scripture either
[1:21:39] all right so then the industrial
[1:21:41] revolution come
[1:21:42] during that time the agrarian society
[1:21:44] husband and wife's roles are
[1:21:46] clear obvious and basically
[1:21:50] undisputed everyone understood the man
[1:21:53] was stronger so he should go work in the
[1:21:55] field
[1:21:55] the woman should stay home and prepare
[1:21:58] the
[1:21:59] the meals take care of the children and
[1:22:02] work on other things that have been
[1:22:05] taken out of the field
[1:22:07] to prepare them so that they can sell
[1:22:09] them right
[1:22:11] and so that was the whole whether you
[1:22:12] were rich or poor
[1:22:14] you were somewhere along these lines
[1:22:18] doing it you could have been so rich
[1:22:19] that you were just commanding people to
[1:22:21] do all this
[1:22:22] all these things but there's all there's
[1:22:24] just different layers and different
[1:22:26] levels understand it that way
[1:22:27] so then the industrial revolution comes
[1:22:29] in the mid 1700s
[1:22:32] through the mid-1800s that's the birth
[1:22:34] of industry in the middle class
[1:22:37] rolls are still mostly clear but
[1:22:41] are starting to get a little bit muddier
[1:22:46] all right so that that's in the time
[1:22:49] from
[1:22:51] mid 1700s through early 1900s
[1:22:54] um then we come into like the 1940s we
[1:22:59] have the age of mass production and so
[1:23:02] this
[1:23:02] flowers blurs the lines
[1:23:06] of the roles of men and women even
[1:23:08] further and then we get the
[1:23:10] digital revolution and it's like what
[1:23:13] lines and what
[1:23:15] we are today we don't even know if
[1:23:16] you're man or woman or
[1:23:19] one day you might be a woman another day
[1:23:21] next day you might be a man you might
[1:23:24] might be homosexual one day next day you
[1:23:27] might be
[1:23:28] trans sexual i don't even know what you
[1:23:30] can't keep track with it
[1:23:31] track of it is so nonsense but that
[1:23:34] that's the blurring
[1:23:35] that's the blurring of the lines that
[1:23:38] this great
[1:23:39] development called the industrial
[1:23:41] revolution
[1:23:42] brought forward to us today
[1:23:47] at the same time the industrial
[1:23:48] revolution happens
[1:23:50] not i shouldn't say the same time but
[1:23:52] 100 years late after the
[1:23:54] beginning of the industrial revolution
[1:23:56] you see
[1:23:57] the rise of feminism and we'll get into
[1:24:00] that
[1:24:01] a little bit more but i'm going to go
[1:24:02] back to
[1:24:04] the proverbs 31 ladies say can you
[1:24:07] please stop i'm just trying to do
[1:24:08] homeschool
[1:24:10] and keep the house from being a disaster
[1:24:12] why are you talking about the proverbs
[1:24:14] 31
[1:24:16] if i can just get the kids to finish
[1:24:17] homeschool i think it's a today
[1:24:19] it's a victory
[1:24:24] all right that's that's that's true and
[1:24:26] yeah and yet i think
[1:24:28] let's all all of us men and women let's
[1:24:32] aspire
[1:24:33] let's aspire to be following the
[1:24:35] principles of the word
[1:24:37] amen
[1:24:40] where where did i leave she seeks wool
[1:24:42] and flax and works willingly
[1:24:44] with her hands she's like the merchant
[1:24:46] ships
[1:24:47] she brings her food from afar she rises
[1:24:49] also while it is yet night
[1:24:51] and gives meat to her household in a
[1:24:53] portion to her maidens
[1:24:56] she considers she so she gets up early
[1:24:58] in the morning my goodness
[1:25:02] she considers a field and buys it with
[1:25:03] the fruit of her hands she plants a
[1:25:05] vineyard
[1:25:06] she girds her loins with strength and
[1:25:08] strengthens her arms
[1:25:10] she perceives that her merchandise is
[1:25:12] good her candles goes
[1:25:14] not out by night she lays her hands to
[1:25:17] the spindle and her
[1:25:18] hands hold the distaff she stretches out
[1:25:20] her hand
[1:25:22] to the poor yay she reaches forth her
[1:25:24] hands
[1:25:25] to the needy she's not afraid of the
[1:25:27] snow for her household
[1:25:29] for all her household are clothed with
[1:25:31] scarlet she makes herself coverings of
[1:25:33] tapestry
[1:25:34] her clothing is silk and purple her
[1:25:36] husband is known
[1:25:37] in the gates when he sits among the
[1:25:39] elders of the field hey that's not fair
[1:25:40] he's just sitting around and she's
[1:25:42] doing all the work that's not what it's
[1:25:45] saying
[1:25:45] when he's sitting in the gates it means
[1:25:47] he's a he's a judge
[1:25:49] so he was a judge judging cases so you
[1:25:52] know
[1:25:52] that that was his responsibility that's
[1:25:55] how he was meeting the needs of his
[1:25:56] family
[1:25:57] she was working and involved in the
[1:25:59] process
[1:26:00] of running the household that's what's
[1:26:03] being said here
[1:26:04] that's this isn't saying she did it all
[1:26:06] by herself
[1:26:08] no one to help she was
[1:26:11] i mean this woman is beyond amazing no
[1:26:14] it's saying she managed
[1:26:16] she managed her home she had maidens
[1:26:19] that means she had maid servants
[1:26:22] to help and do these processes
[1:26:26] that it's talking about but she was
[1:26:28] looking to
[1:26:29] the needs of her home she was looking to
[1:26:32] the future
[1:26:33] right to provide for the needs she's
[1:26:35] saying i'm not afraid for this
[1:26:36] i know snow is coming so let's prepare
[1:26:39] clothing
[1:26:40] again in the home all right don't
[1:26:42] crucify me
[1:26:45] it puts the woman solidly in the home
[1:26:48] overseeing her children her family
[1:26:51] and the needs that they have
[1:26:55] she's not out running all over the place
[1:26:59] all over the world and neglecting her
[1:27:02] home and family
[1:27:04] she is taking care of her home and
[1:27:06] family
[1:27:07] the husband is out of the house
[1:27:09] providing for the needs of the family
[1:27:12] better stop
[1:27:16] she looks well to the ways of her
[1:27:17] household and eats not the bread of
[1:27:19] idleness
[1:27:20] her children arise up and call her
[1:27:22] blessed her husband also and he praises
[1:27:24] her
[1:27:25] many daughters have done virtuously but
[1:27:28] thou
[1:27:28] excellest them all favor or charm
[1:27:32] is deceitful listen to this listen to
[1:27:36] this this is god's viewpoint
[1:27:38] charm is deceitful
[1:27:42] and beauty is vain vain means it's
[1:27:46] it's purposeless it's it's pointless
[1:27:49] but a woman that fears the lord
[1:27:53] she shall be praised there's gonna be a
[1:27:54] beautiful branch
[1:27:56] of the lord in the last days this is
[1:27:59] that woman
[1:28:00] the woman that fears the lord she shall
[1:28:03] be praised give her
[1:28:04] listen to this give her of the fruit of
[1:28:06] her hands
[1:28:08] and let her own works praise her in
[1:28:11] the gates again
[1:28:14] it doesn't say let her works praise her
[1:28:16] husband in the gates
[1:28:19] it might do that but the reality is the
[1:28:21] the bible is saying let
[1:28:23] let her get credit for the work that
[1:28:26] she's done in
[1:28:28] to provide and meet the needs of the
[1:28:30] home
[1:28:32] and and say and lift this up and say
[1:28:34] this is
[1:28:35] the example of a godly woman
[1:28:39] this is what god wants to see a manager
[1:28:43] of a household taking care of their
[1:28:45] family
[1:28:46] taking care of different needs looking
[1:28:48] to the future not fearing
[1:28:51] the future but preparing for the future
[1:28:55] i think there's there's one of the i
[1:28:56] can't remember which
[1:28:59] portion there in another translation
[1:29:03] it says that she laughs
[1:29:08] at the time to come she's she has faith
[1:29:11] she's not afraid of it she laughs at the
[1:29:13] times to come she's prepared
[1:29:15] because the word of god says to prepare
[1:29:17] but also she's not
[1:29:19] in fear because she knows that god
[1:29:22] is her provider
[1:29:27] all right
[1:29:33] so again you say well i'm not
[1:29:36] i'm not a homesteader so how does this
[1:29:40] exactly
[1:29:41] work together to help meet the needs
[1:29:45] of the household if
[1:29:49] if i need help with something and she
[1:29:52] can
[1:29:52] your wife can help then fine
[1:29:56] work together if she needs help on
[1:29:59] something
[1:30:00] you help your wife dish whether it be
[1:30:04] washing dishes or making a meal
[1:30:07] or whatever it might be you you
[1:30:10] you come you're a team you work together
[1:30:14] i'm not trying to blur or blend the
[1:30:16] roles when it comes to that
[1:30:18] i think the scripture is clear
[1:30:21] absolutely clear and yet
[1:30:23] at the same time at the same time it it
[1:30:25] gives us that picture
[1:30:27] that we're one right there's a oneness
[1:30:31] between husband and wife
[1:30:32] we help each other we complete
[1:30:36] each other men stop elbowing each other
[1:30:39] back there
[1:30:46] this isn't meant for elbowing
[1:30:50] love you guys
[1:30:53] so my goodness where are we at
[1:30:57] so in in
[1:31:00] we were talking about clarifying
[1:31:02] feminism i'm kind of just getting there
[1:31:04] now
[1:31:05] so the there's they talk about there's
[1:31:09] three different waves of feminism that
[1:31:11] happened
[1:31:12] back in like the 1850s um
[1:31:16] there was a rise of resistance
[1:31:20] against some things regarding property
[1:31:22] rights
[1:31:24] and opposition to so in
[1:31:28] in most of the world christian world
[1:31:31] marriage was
[1:31:32] um it was a covenant and so
[1:31:35] like in england a woman that was single
[1:31:38] she had the right to own property
[1:31:40] and to conduct business in her own name
[1:31:43] but as soon as she was married
[1:31:45] the law said you're you're now one
[1:31:49] husband and wife are one so whatever
[1:31:52] is done needs to be done in the name
[1:31:56] of the husband so now she she couldn't
[1:31:59] whatever property she had before that
[1:32:01] became
[1:32:02] supposed to become their property of
[1:32:04] course
[1:32:06] in a society that's full of people that
[1:32:08] are not born again
[1:32:10] it basically whatever was her property
[1:32:12] became his property
[1:32:14] in a christian home that
[1:32:17] that's true that's true whatever is our
[1:32:20] property
[1:32:22] whatever is his property becomes their
[1:32:24] property whatever is her property
[1:32:26] becomes their property right when we're
[1:32:29] in
[1:32:30] a covenant of oneness man shall leave
[1:32:33] his father and mother and cleave to his
[1:32:35] wife the two will be one flesh
[1:32:37] whatever i have belongs to my wife
[1:32:39] whatever
[1:32:40] she has belongs to me we're
[1:32:44] in this thing together we're we're one
[1:32:48] well the abuse of that
[1:32:51] in the 18th and 19th centuries
[1:32:54] raised up this spirit of feminism
[1:32:58] in order to erase that idea
[1:33:01] that was the start of it it was that and
[1:33:04] the vote i'm just going to state facts
[1:33:06] i'm not going to put
[1:33:07] judgments on anything i'm just going to
[1:33:09] state what happened
[1:33:10] we'll go to the word and let the word
[1:33:12] speak for itself
[1:33:13] but it was focused on
[1:33:18] women gaining the vote and it was
[1:33:20] focused on getting
[1:33:22] rid of this idea that women
[1:33:26] cannot own their own property
[1:33:29] all right that was the basically the
[1:33:30] first wave of that
[1:33:33] and within that they had this they
[1:33:35] started
[1:33:36] planting this idea that the that
[1:33:39] the biblical understanding that the
[1:33:41] husband is the head of the wife
[1:33:43] that needs to get thrown out
[1:33:47] so then the second wave of feminism was
[1:33:49] like the 1960s women's liberation
[1:33:52] challenging all the cultural and uh
[1:33:55] norms and the validity of what
[1:33:58] they call quote unquote the patriarchy
[1:34:01] you hear that
[1:34:02] spoken about basically the social and
[1:34:06] sexual hierarchies that they feel were
[1:34:09] used to control
[1:34:10] and limit the legal and physical
[1:34:13] independence of women
[1:34:15] in society again this is the world
[1:34:20] this is the world this is the spirit of
[1:34:23] dev
[1:34:24] of the devil what is the what is the
[1:34:25] word what is the how does the devil work
[1:34:28] by the tree of the knowledge of good and
[1:34:30] evil
[1:34:31] there's some good things there's some
[1:34:32] bad things i'm not here to pass judgment
[1:34:35] on every single aspect
[1:34:37] of feminism i i told you at the
[1:34:40] beginning
[1:34:40] what i was condemning and what i was not
[1:34:43] condemning all right
[1:34:45] there's a lot of abuses and mistreatment
[1:34:48] of women
[1:34:49] that was used and still is used in
[1:34:52] society
[1:34:52] has nothing to do with scripture but
[1:34:55] people will take
[1:34:56] take that feminists will take that and
[1:35:00] say
[1:35:00] see the bible is wrong has nothing to do
[1:35:04] sexual harassment has nothing to do with
[1:35:06] the bible
[1:35:08] it absolutely condemns a man for such
[1:35:11] behavior
[1:35:12] but they take that they take that and
[1:35:14] they put that over the whole
[1:35:17] thing and that's not right that's the
[1:35:19] devil
[1:35:21] that's how the devil works he works in
[1:35:23] these little increments
[1:35:25] as we talked about blurring the lines
[1:35:27] blurring the lines blurring the lines
[1:35:29] until at the end what do we have in
[1:35:31] america nobody knows even what they are
[1:35:34] nobody knows who they are what they are
[1:35:35] why they are
[1:35:37] they don't know they don't know anything
[1:35:39] about themselves
[1:35:40] isn't it funny that they don't know
[1:35:42] anything about themselves
[1:35:44] when the very thing that god is doing in
[1:35:47] the world
[1:35:48] is revealing to his people this is
[1:35:50] exactly who you are
[1:35:53] this is who i made you to be isn't it
[1:35:55] strange that god would send the spirit
[1:35:57] of elijah
[1:35:58] in the middle of the 20th century right
[1:36:02] before he came
[1:36:03] what happened in the 1920s oh
[1:36:07] women women can wear pants
[1:36:10] women can cut their hair they can wear
[1:36:12] makeup they can wear earrings
[1:36:14] all of that stuff never existed before
[1:36:16] the 1920s
[1:36:19] now all of a sudden there's this
[1:36:20] development to this place
[1:36:22] where women are throwing off everything
[1:36:26] they're throwing off everything and
[1:36:27] saying i don't need to obey the word
[1:36:30] i don't need to follow scripture i don't
[1:36:32] need to have a husband
[1:36:33] as the head i can do everything a man
[1:36:36] can do you might be able to
[1:36:39] that doesn't mean we're supposed to
[1:36:40] there's a lot of things i could do
[1:36:43] doesn't mean i'm supposed to do that it
[1:36:45] doesn't mean god designed me to do that
[1:36:47] but that's what the world is feeding
[1:36:50] children
[1:36:53] young people don't feed on the world
[1:36:57] it's literally put in front of you
[1:37:00] 24 7. every cartoon
[1:37:03] every advertisement every magazine every
[1:37:07] worldly book
[1:37:08] every cart every pbs cartoon
[1:37:11] is trying to indoctrinate children
[1:37:16] you say well they don't think they're
[1:37:17] just trying to produce entertainment
[1:37:19] there's a demon behind it
[1:37:22] there's demons behind it and what is it
[1:37:24] doing it's trying to show
[1:37:26] the children do not follow the word of
[1:37:29] god
[1:37:30] i have liberation for you i have freedom
[1:37:34] for you it's bondage to hell
[1:37:37] that's what it is there's only one kind
[1:37:40] of freedom
[1:37:41] and then that that's when god sets you
[1:37:43] free
[1:37:44] to live the kind of life that god
[1:37:46] originally created
[1:37:48] man and woman to live
[1:37:54] so now we have the third wave of
[1:37:57] feminism
[1:37:59] which is express yourself you can
[1:38:03] express your body in any way that you
[1:38:06] want to
[1:38:08] of course that's coming also at the same
[1:38:10] time expose yourself to the world
[1:38:14] but sexual harassment is bad
[1:38:18] we we don't like sexual harassment we
[1:38:20] don't find like any kind of expression
[1:38:22] of
[1:38:23] um what are you doing
[1:38:28] you're literally insane you're exposing
[1:38:30] your entire body to the world
[1:38:32] and then someone makes a comment some
[1:38:34] unregenerate sinner
[1:38:37] man makes a comment to you and you're
[1:38:39] you're saying
[1:38:40] oh i'm just i'm triggered i just can't
[1:38:43] even
[1:38:44] handle what are you're insane
[1:38:48] the world is absolutely insane but i
[1:38:51] have a right to express
[1:38:53] my body the way i want and i don't need
[1:38:56] someone else's eyes to violate
[1:38:58] me
[1:39:01] okay whatever you're insane
[1:39:05] you're insane that's not how the
[1:39:08] the the mind of man works that's not how
[1:39:12] the mind
[1:39:14] it's literally all of it is designed
[1:39:17] to deceive you look at even makeup you
[1:39:19] say oh it's not a big deal
[1:39:22] i was listening to i'm not always a fan
[1:39:24] of what he says but jordan peterson
[1:39:26] and they're talking about why do we have
[1:39:28] makeup in the workplace
[1:39:32] and everyone was laughing at him and
[1:39:33] making fun of him what in the world are
[1:39:35] you talking about
[1:39:36] of course they could have makeup in the
[1:39:37] work place but he said do you know why
[1:39:41] makeup is done the way it is you put
[1:39:42] makeup on your cheek it's red
[1:39:44] what why why do they do that because
[1:39:47] when
[1:39:48] sorry kids when you're when when
[1:39:51] a man and a woman are coming together
[1:39:54] what happens is
[1:39:55] the cheeks turn red the cheeks flush
[1:39:58] the whole the whole thing is an
[1:39:59] expression of
[1:40:01] sexuality wearing makeup the
[1:40:04] the lips turn red when that when that
[1:40:07] happens
[1:40:08] between a man and a woman the purpose is
[1:40:11] not
[1:40:12] just to be presentable it's you know you
[1:40:15] hear i got to put on my
[1:40:16] war paint yeah it's the war pain of the
[1:40:19] satanic war that's happening between the
[1:40:22] angels of god
[1:40:24] and the demons are coming together
[1:40:26] that's why you
[1:40:27] call it warp i gotta put on my warping i
[1:40:29] gotta i gotta put my face on
[1:40:31] you know what that means you're a fake
[1:40:39] you don't understand what you're doing
[1:40:42] and why you're doing it i'm not against
[1:40:47] the women that do that they're just
[1:40:48] ignorant you don't have to be ignorant
[1:40:51] you don't have to just sort of
[1:40:52] well i'm just going to dance a little
[1:40:53] bit with the devil just a minute
[1:40:56] no we don't need to dance with the devil
[1:40:58] at all
[1:41:01] the purpose of wearing makeup is to a
[1:41:04] sexualize a woman
[1:41:06] why do you want to be sexualized
[1:41:10] because there's a spirit behind you
[1:41:12] trying to use you
[1:41:13] and misuse you and abuse you to take
[1:41:17] another person to hell with you
[1:41:24] i'm speaking harsh because i love you
[1:41:27] because i don't want to see any of our
[1:41:28] girls destroyed
[1:41:30] by the spirit of this world
[1:41:34] everything is blurred everything is
[1:41:36] fuzzy the world makes it that way
[1:41:39] because you're looking at things in the
[1:41:41] world
[1:41:42] but the spirit of god brings the truth
[1:41:45] and it's clear
[1:41:46] and it's simple and it's easy to
[1:41:48] understand
[1:41:49] why why does god say a woman should
[1:41:53] dress modestly
[1:41:56] because god wants to repress the women
[1:42:02] i'm laughing because why because i i
[1:42:05] know what god wants what does he want
[1:42:07] just what he made the man to be the head
[1:42:09] for to protect you
[1:42:12] why well you say that's the man's fault
[1:42:14] if he looks
[1:42:15] it is the man's fault if he looks it's
[1:42:18] also your fault for presenting yourself
[1:42:20] if you go into a room filled with
[1:42:22] dynamite
[1:42:25] with a torch first of all you're stupid
[1:42:29] second of all you're asking for an
[1:42:31] explosion
[1:42:33] so what do you think you're doing you're
[1:42:34] going around amongst unregenerate
[1:42:36] men dressing sexy exposing
[1:42:40] your body wearing makeup what in the
[1:42:43] world
[1:42:44] do you think is going to happen yes they
[1:42:47] are to blame
[1:42:49] the blame is not only on you if you did
[1:42:52] that amongst born again men they would
[1:42:54] just go
[1:42:55] okay uh gotta look the other way
[1:43:00] but you're not doing it amongst born
[1:43:01] again man you're doing it amongst
[1:43:03] slaves to sin
[1:43:07] god puts these limitations on us
[1:43:11] to protect us in a fallen world
[1:43:15] god set biblical manhood
[1:43:18] and biblical womanhood in order to
[1:43:21] protect us
[1:43:22] in a fallen world and to express himself
[1:43:26] through the family a family
[1:43:30] following the word of god is a beautiful
[1:43:33] reflection of him
[1:43:36] why am i talking about this beautiful
[1:43:38] branch of the lord because
[1:43:40] without that beautiful branch of the
[1:43:42] lord the woman
[1:43:44] who's living in surrender to god we have
[1:43:47] we don't have
[1:43:48] an expression of who the bride of christ
[1:43:52] truly is we don't have that
[1:43:55] and we don't have a part of god's
[1:43:58] very expression sisters you're living
[1:44:01] modestly you're following the order of
[1:44:04] the bible
[1:44:05] you're expressing the invisible god
[1:44:08] you're making god visible in front of
[1:44:12] the people
[1:44:14] what would you rather do in life
[1:44:17] than that really when it comes down to
[1:44:21] it when it comes down to the very
[1:44:23] end of life what would you rather spend
[1:44:26] your life doing
[1:44:28] fulfilling your flesh through the
[1:44:31] world's version
[1:44:32] of liberation or do you want to
[1:44:37] be an expression of god so that when you
[1:44:40] get there in that day
[1:44:42] your whole faith your whole trust was in
[1:44:44] the lord you say i trust
[1:44:45] you command these things in your word
[1:44:47] lord i love you and i want to walk in
[1:44:49] them i want to live in them
[1:44:51] i want to be an expression of them when
[1:44:53] you get to that
[1:44:54] day if the lord tarries and you're
[1:44:57] laying on your deathbed
[1:44:59] it's a day of rejoicing
[1:45:03] it's not a day to be sorry other people
[1:45:05] will be so sorrowful because
[1:45:07] you are such an expression of him and
[1:45:10] they love him
[1:45:11] so they love you but for you it's not a
[1:45:14] day of sorrow it's not a day of worry
[1:45:16] it's not a day of fear
[1:45:18] it's your birthday
[1:45:22] amen musicians if you'd come
[1:45:28] brother branham talks about the vision
