[1:25] turn to the Book of John John the first
[1:28] chapter the gospel of John and we're
[1:31] going to read five verses my title for
[1:34] this morning is going to be There's
[1:37] Something About
[1:39] Life John 1 says in the beginning was
[1:42] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:44] the Word was God the same was in the
[1:47] beginning with God all things were made
[1:50] by him and without him was not anything
[1:53] made that was made in him was life and
[1:57] the life was the light of men and the
[2:00] light shineth in darkness and the
[2:03] Darkness comprehended it not God bless
[2:06] you as you take your seats this
[2:09] morning I'm going to start with a just
[2:12] uh a quote from a message the uncertain
[2:15] sound this morning it's what kind of
[2:17] sparked my heart for for the topic U
[2:20] brother Brandon begins uh talking about
[2:22] the little posum and I'm sure most of us
[2:24] are familiar with the story a little pum
[2:27] had been struck and was just in awful
[2:29] condition and the Lord had just dealt
[2:31] with the prophet's heart you know a
[2:32] little possum is laying at your doorstep
[2:34] and he's waiting it's waiting to be
[2:35] prayed for that little mother there and
[2:38] the prophet couldn't understand it at
[2:39] first you know all these hundreds of
[2:40] people waiting to be prayed for sick
[2:42] children and everything that he had on a
[2:44] list in his
[2:45] pocket um but yet he was speaking to him
[2:48] about this little possum you know but
[2:50] the God who created the possum was
[2:52] showing that he cares about the little
[2:54] things in life he cares about everything
[2:57] and uh even even what seems to be
[2:59] insignificant ific he cares about it and
[3:01] the Lord Jesus healed that little possum
[3:03] he says in the uncertain sound he says
[3:05] and he turned into the gate and I went
[3:07] out to meet the posum I took a rake I
[3:09] thought strange he may be blind but what
[3:12] makes him act and reeling like that I
[3:14] laid the rake over him and he turned and
[3:16] he looked at me and he growled and I
[3:17] thought there's something strange and I
[3:19] happened to look down in her pocket a
[3:21] possum is one thing besides the kangaroo
[3:24] there's only two that has a pocket that
[3:25] carry their young in and in the pocket
[3:27] of the possum she had eight or nine
[3:30] little babies in there and a dog had got
[3:33] a hold of her either a car broke her leg
[3:36] her shoulder brown green flies all over
[3:38] maggots in the ears and so forth and
[3:40] here she was hobbling up like that and
[3:42] she growled because she thought I was
[3:44] reaching for her little ones the little
[3:46] wa lady wouldn't wait she wouldn't even
[3:48] stop partly she went straight to my
[3:50] steps and exhausted laid there we tried
[3:53] to get her up she was gone she was still
[3:55] grunting suffering so tremendously then
[3:59] it says Mrs wood came up and Mr wood and
[4:01] them said brother brandom I believe the
[4:03] Humane thing to do would to be
[4:08] kill the only you could you do it
[4:11] someone else come in by and said brother
[4:13] brandom won't you kill that possum said
[4:14] kill her she's dying and she's laying
[4:16] there suffering take those little ones
[4:18] out kill them they'd be better off say
[4:19] they haven't got a soul it's just a dumb
[4:21] brute just an animal the poor little
[4:23] things will starve to death and the poor
[4:26] mother laying there with them little B
[4:28] babies nursing the milk from her and you
[4:29] know what condition she was in said
[4:31] they're going to die she said I'm you
[4:34] know I'm a he brother brandom says I'm a
[4:36] true Hunter but I'm not a killer said I
[4:38] love to hunt but I don't like to do the
[4:40] killing that's a killer that's right I
[4:42] don't I don't kill nothing that I can't
[4:43] eat or something I can't make use of I
[4:45] just I couldn't do it I just couldn't do
[4:47] it and I know sensibly in the mental
[4:50] Realms in the right way of thinking the
[4:53] Humane thing to do would to be kill that
[4:55] pum and the little ones the psum was
[4:57] dying and would never gain Consciousness
[4:59] again again and the little ones would
[5:01] starve to death that was the sensible
[5:03] thing but something down here wouldn't
[5:06] let me do it crowds began to come and
[5:08] and I had a call that went out and that
[5:10] night brother wood and I were walking
[5:12] out down the road and sister wood and my
[5:14] wife coming down from up toward
[5:16] Scottsburg where I was trying to get a
[5:17] little mental rest brother wood said you
[5:20] see that little puppy back there on the
[5:21] road said it's going to get run over so
[5:24] I Whirled my car around and I went back
[5:27] and we picked that poor little fellow up
[5:29] he was full of fleas and M and M should
[5:32] eat him up what would be the sensible
[5:34] thing to do would to be kill the dog but
[5:37] I couldn't do it I brought the little
[5:39] fell home got me some flea powder
[5:41] sprayed him got me some mange cure give
[5:43] him a good decent meal got him hit away
[5:45] trying to get the little fellow to get
[5:47] well he wants to live you know sometimes
[5:51] just to bring it bring it to us here
[5:53] this morning that's how it is with
[5:55] people they just want to live they they
[5:58] the case may look look hopeless and
[6:00] situations sometimes seem hopeless and
[6:03] it may seem like the only thing to do
[6:05] would be write the person off as
[6:06] unsavable because of the situation but
[6:09] watch what brother brandham says in this
[6:11] statement he says there's something
[6:13] about life that's real there's something
[6:17] about life that's real don't impersonate
[6:19] Christianity get life and
[6:23] live get life and live you don't have to
[6:26] battle yourself around and say well I'm
[6:28] a Christian I ought do this I ought and
[6:30] do that just live there's one who cares
[6:33] for you you know and you know being a
[6:35] Believer I think sometimes is
[6:36] misunderstood so many times from the
[6:38] world you know we we wear long dresses
[6:41] we we don't cut our hair we don't drink
[6:43] or we don't cuss you stay away from
[6:44] immoral things you don't lie you know
[6:47] little things bother you like telling
[6:48] small white lies but it's misunderstood
[6:50] by the world it's not a self-righteous
[6:52] act or a list of of rules of dos and
[6:56] don'ts it's life it's life life being
[7:00] lived through US amen and sometimes it
[7:03] can be impersonated like the prophet
[7:05] said but the fruits of that
[7:07] impersonation will eventually come out
[7:09] and it will make known the the the the
[7:12] fruits will be made known but when it's
[7:14] a real genuine life in Christ there's
[7:17] something special about it amen there's
[7:20] something it shines out a light that
[7:22] outshines the
[7:23] darkness and your life projects his life
[7:28] to the world it's the life of Jesus
[7:30] Christ being expressed through us he
[7:32] does those things through his family and
[7:35] you know there's just nothing like
[7:36] living for the Lord Jesus you know uh my
[7:39] my delight as Psalms would say my
[7:41] delight is in the law of the Lord and in
[7:43] his law do I meditate day and night we
[7:46] we don't we we do certain things or we
[7:48] don't do certain things because we love
[7:50] the Lord and doing that which pleases
[7:53] the father that's all that matters now
[7:55] in our life that that's that everything
[7:57] else has now taken second place and
[7:59] that's what matters the life amen
[8:02] knowing he cared so much for me that he
[8:05] saved me of my wretched condition
[8:07] cleaned me up and changed me out amen I
[8:11] think we all can have that kind of that
[8:13] that mentality you know the the life you
[8:15] live before Jesus you know people think
[8:19] that they're living before they have
[8:21] come into relationship with God they can
[8:23] have nice things you know they they live
[8:25] their best life but until they've tasted
[8:28] from the fountain that never runs dry
[8:31] the Water of Life God's word the void in
[8:33] their life can never be
[8:36] filled if you remember when brother
[8:38] brandom comes and tells the testimony he
[8:41] was between services and and he went
[8:44] over to this burger joint and he was
[8:46] just having a a a a meal and he goes in
[8:50] there it was just a a dirty place to be
[8:53] you know he starts describing it there's
[8:54] a jukebox in the corner playing some bad
[8:57] music and a policeman with the with his
[8:58] arm around some poorly dressed woman and
[9:01] playing slot machines which was illegal
[9:03] in the city at the time and an older
[9:05] lady you know that was kind of dressed
[9:06] wrong you know smoking cigarettes in the
[9:08] corner with some guys at the table and
[9:11] and in his heart he just started
[9:12] condemning the situation he started
[9:14] condemning what was going on he said oh
[9:16] my God how how can you stand it I said
[9:19] why don't you wipe it off the face of
[9:21] the Earth then I was sitting there
[9:23] thinking that and all of a sudden
[9:25] something struck me and the Lord said
[9:27] for me sit down and I went over there in
[9:30] the corner behind the door and I started
[9:32] praying I thought Lord it looks like you
[9:34] just simply tear the whole you know will
[9:36] my little Rebecca and Sarah have to my
[9:39] two little girls will they have to be
[9:40] raised up here in a world under such as
[9:42] that I thought how can you stand it Lord
[9:46] when it makes a sinner like like me
[9:48] shiver to think of such a thing you know
[9:51] but Jesus had a daughter over there in
[9:53] that corner amen he had a daughter
[9:57] waiting for for life to come in into
[10:00] that place she was there was something
[10:03] there was something in that place and
[10:05] brother Brandon was drawn to it but God
[10:08] had to correct him a little bit in that
[10:09] situation amen he began dealing with the
[10:12] prophet's heart you know they're living
[10:14] in sin But but so were
[10:16] you but it says that Waters of
[10:18] Separation 1955 says well I got back
[10:21] there and I saw a vision that changed my
[10:23] picture alt together I seen a world
[10:25] turning I noticed around it was a streak
[10:27] like red all around I know where we're
[10:29] probably all familiar but it's it's good
[10:30] to go through these things and I
[10:31] wondered what it was and as I drew close
[10:34] before I seen myself as a boy and when I
[10:36] would sin well I seen Jesus standing in
[10:39] front between me and God and his blood
[10:42] acted as a bumper every time I did
[10:44] something wrong it would hit him and
[10:46] he'd say father forgive me he he doesn't
[10:48] know what he's doing and and i' do
[10:50] something else and it was just like a
[10:51] bumper on a car to keep me God can't
[10:54] stand sin the day you sin you're gone
[10:56] that's all but the blood of Jesus was
[10:59] protecting me from the Wrath of the
[11:01] wrath of God for me and my sin would
[11:03] catch it and he say father forgive him
[11:05] he don't know what he's doing and I
[11:06] looked and I said Lord is my sins
[11:08] treating you like that and I seen on the
[11:11] book there I I crawled up a little
[11:13] closer R blood just running down his
[11:17] face and my name was at the top and all
[11:20] kinds of sins wrote on it said L will
[11:22] you forgive me he touched his side and
[11:25] wrote pardon there throw it on the back
[11:27] behind him in the sea of forgetfulness
[11:29] and I said oh how I appreciate you Lord
[11:32] he said now I was willing to forgive you
[11:35] of your
[11:36] sins and you're but you want to stand
[11:38] back here and condemn them for their
[11:41] sins my you know and he went over to
[11:44] that woman that day and I you know and
[11:46] she began to just he began to just
[11:49] describe what had happened you know out
[11:51] of an honest heart that's that's how
[11:53] somebody can know that that you're real
[11:55] and you're genuine and he just he just
[11:57] began to be honest with you know I was
[11:59] standing over there in the corner and I
[12:01] was condemning you in my heart but the
[12:02] Lord corrected me and as he began to
[12:05] witness her she began telling him of of
[12:07] her story you know she was once a
[12:09] Christian raised right in church but I
[12:12] got mixed up in the wrong kind of things
[12:14] and you know the devil just got me off
[12:16] my beaten path and I married a man and
[12:18] and he was a drunk and and and then she
[12:20] just lost her way and she told him that
[12:23] she thought she had sned away her day of
[12:26] Grace that she had done too many wrongs
[12:29] in her life that the Lord couldn't
[12:32] forgive her anymore but brother Brandon
[12:34] was able to discern that spirit and said
[12:37] he said do you still have respect for
[12:39] the Lord and she said yes sir I do and
[12:42] he said then he hasn't left you and he L
[12:44] her straight to the Lord Jesus Christ
[12:46] that day they kneeled right down there
[12:48] in that Tavern if you want to go read
[12:49] the story he tells it several times and
[12:51] amongst the darkness as we read in there
[12:54] and a light shined through that
[12:57] Darkness that's what it it's all about
[12:59] friends that is what life is all about
[13:01] leading people to that light she was
[13:04] like that posum or like that dog you
[13:06] know it looked like her life was too far
[13:09] gone to be helped but something deep
[13:10] down in her heart was crying out for
[13:14] something more than what she had a life
[13:16] that that just hadn't struck yet a light
[13:20] that that wasn't there yet but just
[13:22] enough light struck that seed and it
[13:24] brought it to life
[13:27] amen what an opportunity we have as Sons
[13:31] and Daughters of God to show that light
[13:34] to others when you know sometimes people
[13:37] are in such a dark place in their life
[13:39] where you know light hasn't shined in a
[13:41] long time but as soon as the light of
[13:44] the Lord can break through life can
[13:47] break through that Darkness I know we
[13:48] have many witnesses here this morning
[13:50] you know that we're living in dark lives
[13:53] but the Lord Jesus through through his
[13:55] light shined in their life and changed
[13:58] their life
[13:59] amen by the grace of God John 13 says by
[14:04] this shall all men know that you are my
[14:06] disciples if you have love one for
[14:08] another you know and expressing to that
[14:10] to someone can show them exactly what
[14:13] they didn't even know that they were
[14:16] looking for amen the truth is what sets
[14:19] people free and by expressing that life
[14:22] you know in in how the Lord lives it
[14:24] through us that's why it's that's why we
[14:27] do meditate on the law every day that's
[14:29] why we do the things we do because it's
[14:32] the life being expressed through us and
[14:34] that light being shined out to the world
[14:37] it's not a self-righteous thing it's not
[14:39] a we do it because we want to do it and
[14:41] we do it because it's God living through
[14:43] us doing it Amen brother Tim uh said
[14:47] something last weekend and and and it
[14:50] just kind of stuck with me um he said
[14:53] you know there is still a predestinated
[14:55] sea that the light of this gospel has to
[14:58] strike in order for us to go home amen
[15:01] and because the Lord Jesus is interested
[15:04] in that one seed we ought to be equally
[15:07] as interested and I just that just has
[15:10] struck me brother Ram says here in uh
[15:14] testimony this is just when he went to
[15:16] go talk to her just wanted to share this
[15:19] this is really neat it says and I told
[15:20] her what I had seen I stood here and
[15:23] condemned you and God ought to come in
[15:26] here and tear the place up with such as
[15:28] going on but I've changed my mind God
[15:31] forgave me and I want him to forgive you
[15:35] and right there at that seat I letter
[15:37] her to Jesus Christ amen see it's your
[15:40] listen to this it's your attitude
[15:42] towards things amen it's your attitude
[15:45] towards things don't condemn others if
[15:48] they do wrong be good to them anyhow
[15:51] just look over those things because God
[15:54] has had to look over a whole lot for you
[15:56] and I that's right right God help us to
[16:00] always have that attitude in our hearts
[16:02] you pray for me that I'll never look
[16:05] upon people like that no more no matter
[16:08] what they're doing that I'll always look
[16:10] up on them that they're creatures of God
[16:14] that God sent his son to take their
[16:16] place and me as a minister I'm grateful
[16:18] that he forgave me and I want him to
[16:21] forgive them also that's the way we
[16:24] should do it amen it's our attitude
[16:27] towards things the prophet says
[16:29] and we don't use that as an excuse to
[16:31] shun away from declaring the gospel Amen
[16:34] to declare that Sin is Sin to separate
[16:38] from unbelief but if we can have the
[16:40] right attitude in our hearts when we do
[16:43] that thing then I think that's where the
[16:46] person can see the life of Jesus Christ
[16:48] being expressed through US
[16:51] amen you know I think sometimes and I'll
[16:54] just I'm not saying any of you or just
[16:56] pointing them all back at me I think
[16:57] sometimes we we can get into a state
[16:59] where we look at a person maybe we can
[17:01] just cond condemn them like brother
[17:02] brandom did there if only they would do
[17:06] this or they would do that you know even
[17:07] the prophet was guilty we just put our
[17:10] two cents in and we say strike this
[17:13] place down like brother Brenham was
[17:14] saying it's too far deep in sin it's too
[17:16] far gone but then the Lord Jesus steps
[17:19] in and he reveals to you exactly what
[17:22] place you used to be in you know we look
[17:25] at that you know that was a long time
[17:27] ago right but God doesn't have a
[17:29] construct of time remember when brother
[17:31] Steven was here there's no construct of
[17:33] time for God so you were in that place
[17:35] once but that person there's a light in
[17:38] there amen and there's a life that God
[17:40] wants to show to them amen and then he
[17:43] adjusts our ad accordingly we can't ever
[17:46] disregard any case
[17:49] amen there's no helpless case that God
[17:52] can't change he's the infinite God we
[17:55] are to sigh and to cry for the
[17:57] Abominations in the city but from a
[17:58] place of humility a place that that
[18:01] cries for the light of Jesus to strike
[18:04] those Abominations and to change their
[18:06] hearts Jesus said in Matthew 11 take my
[18:09] yoke upon you and learn of me for I am
[18:13] meek and I am lowly in heart and then ye
[18:16] shall find rest un your souls there's
[18:19] something about when the Lord Jesus can
[18:21] teach you not through a teaching but
[18:23] through a life amen we're going to get
[18:25] into this in just a minute but you know
[18:27] I could preach a thousand sermons in my
[18:29] life but your life could affect more
[18:31] people than a thousand sermons could
[18:33] ever affect amen there is just something
[18:36] about life that's
[18:42] real Amen brother brandham says um in
[18:46] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[18:48] the only way that you can actually be a
[18:50] Christian is for Christ to identify
[18:54] himself in you that's the only way for
[18:56] you to be a Christian
[18:58] and he says moving on in paragraph 448
[19:01] he says now notice god making himself
[19:03] known now we're not supposed to make
[19:06] converts to Christianity by a government
[19:08] but by the Revelation the Christ in you
[19:12] as God was in Christ as God was in

[21:41] could have went to any restaurant that
[21:42] day he could have went to any place he

[22:14] can't ever lose sight of what is the
[22:17] most important thing and that's pointing
[22:19] others to that life and showing that
[22:22] Christ still can change a life
[22:25] amen I just pray that I you know I can
[22:28] have that attitude always in our hearts

[22:35] reflect Jesus you know sometimes like I
[22:37] was saying earlier sometimes the
[22:38] situation looks helpless it seems the
[22:40] sensible thing to do would to be write
[22:42] me off you know I was once in a place
[22:44] where you look at me and you just write
[22:46] me off but God rich in Mercy came down
[22:50] and he and he just cleaned me up he
[22:52] cleaned my life out nothing I could have
[22:54] done I didn't change myself I couldn't
[22:55] change myself but God rich and mercy
[22:58] changed me amen and he does that still
[23:01] in life he's still in the saving
[23:04] business he's still in the healing
[23:06] business he still does those things amen

[23:36] would have been a better option but his
[23:38] light changed me

[23:43] to say it again the sermon that you
[23:44] preach through your life is more
[23:47] important than anything you know it's
[23:50] it's how God expresses himself here
[23:53] today it could be someone's Lifeline
[23:56] amen
[23:58] and he just
[23:59] says to requote that quote he says you
[24:03] pray for me that I'll never look upon
