[13:15] first step

[13:30] bring me closer to you then I will go
[13:35] through the fire
[13:38] if you want me to
[13:43] you may not be the way I would have
[13:47] chosen
[13:50] when you lead me through a world that's
[13:55] not my home

[14:31] so when the whole world turns against me
[14:34] and I'm all by myself
[14:38] and I can't hear you answer
[14:43] my Christ for help I'll remember the
[14:50] suffering Your Love put you through and
[14:55] I will go through the valley

[19:50] praise the Lord and all the family and
[19:53] Grandma I kept thinking who is Tony
[19:55] talking about Grandma I remember him
[19:58] calling such a gene man I thought who
[20:00] would that be and then I heard sister
[20:02] Dorothy start up
[20:03] I was immediately in the right place at
[20:06] the right time amen God bless you we
[20:09] want to turn to Hebrews chapter 11 this
[20:11] evening we want to just move quickly
[20:14] along I don't I don't want to use the
[20:15] word quickly but let me just move
[20:18] studiously along because we kind of made
[20:21] an announcement today that we're
[20:22] abbreviating every little bit here and
[20:24] we've cut back a little bit on the cut
[20:26] into brother Anthony's time going to cut
[20:28] into my own time a little bit we're
[20:29] gonna I'm Gonna Give You Anthony's
[20:31] leftover time and my leftover time I'm
[20:33] gonna give it to you amen and we're
[20:35] going to come up around like in the old
[20:36] days and pre-pandemic pre-pandemonic and
[20:40] uh and pray Urbana around the altar so
[20:43] cap Sarah you picked a good weekend amen
[20:46] praise the Lord so then we're going to
[20:48] have some testimonies I'm sure that
[20:50] you've got got some I've already heard a
[20:52] number of good ones on so we're going to
[20:54] have some of those repeated tonight just
[20:56] take a little time for that amen it's
[20:58] wonderful and I love love doing it last
[21:01] week we did it on Wednesday and brought
[21:03] you up nobody had a testimony and I said
[21:05] my goodness everybody's in vapor lock
[21:07] and I I got home I said well you know
[21:09] they hadn't done it in so long probably
[21:11] called everybody off guard so tonight
[21:13] I'm sure that almost ever we'll probably
[21:15] have to shut y'all down on testimonies
[21:18] tonight praise the Lord Hebrews chapter
[21:20] 11 I want by the grace of God to pick up
[21:23] the continuation of a thought that I've
[21:26] preached on in December
[21:28] and in December we took a title called a
[21:31] sure foundation and I want to take part
[21:35] two of that tonight I believe if memory
[21:37] serves you'll find that and maybe in the
[21:39] first or second week of December if
[21:41] you're going to look for that on the
[21:43] archive if you haven't heard part one
[21:44] but tonight want to catch part two we're
[21:46] going to actually take our same opening
[21:48] text I believe is what we used last time
[21:50] Hebrews 11 beginning at verse 32.
[21:55] and what shall I more say
[21:58] for time would fail me to tell of Gideon
[22:02] and of Barrack and of Samson and
[22:04] jephthah and David also and Samuel and
[22:06] of the prophets
[22:08] who through faith subdued kingdoms
[22:10] wrought righteousness obtained promises
[22:13] stopped the mouths of lions quenched the
[22:16] violence of fire escape the edge of the
[22:19] sword out of weakness were made strong
[22:22] waxed Valiant in fight turned to flight
[22:25] the armies of the aliens women received
[22:29] their dead raised to life now if you
[22:32] just stop right there you'd say my
[22:35] goodness what a successful military
[22:37] campaign
[22:38] this Army whoever they were were
[22:41] Unstoppable undefeatable all right now
[22:45] now we're going to flip but I want you
[22:47] to remember what you're about to read
[22:50] did not diminish the Victorious position
[22:53] of the same Army all right they were
[22:57] still just as Victorious and others were
[22:59] tortured not accepting Deliverance that
[23:03] they might obtain a better resurrection
[23:06] and others had trial of cruel mockings
[23:09] and scourging yay moreover of bonds and
[23:13] imprisonment they were stoned they were
[23:16] sauna Sunder we're tempted we're slain
[23:18] with the sword
[23:20] where they wondered about in sheepskins
[23:22] and goat skins being destitute Afflicted
[23:25] tormented can we think of any other
[23:27] horrible descriptive terms here
[23:31] Now Catch Paul's summation
[23:34] whether they were successful what it
[23:36] looks like successful or what looks like
[23:39] unsuccessful of whom both sides the
[23:43] world was not worthy
[23:46] they wandered in deserts and in
[23:48] mountains and in dens and in caves of
[23:50] the Earth all and these all having
[23:53] obtained a good report through faith
[23:56] received not the promise God having
[24:00] provided some better thing for us that
[24:03] they without us should not be made
[24:06] perfect
[24:08] let's pray father we thank you for your
[24:11] word tonight Lord and I just stand here
[24:13] Lord and surrender myself fresh father
[24:17] my whole heart and mind just into your
[24:19] care
[24:20] take the word Lord as you have brought
[24:23] it to me throughout the number of days
[24:25] Lord been looking at these notes and
[24:27] adding a little here and a little there
[24:29] as you inspired me and Lord it just
[24:31] seemed today the windows of Heaven open
[24:33] I could hardly contain it and yet we
[24:36] have an abbreviated service tonight and
[24:38] so I'm just asking you now Lord to be
[24:40] the preacher you'll get it all said and
[24:42] it'll be said perfectly Lord I commit
[24:45] myself into your hands in Jesus name
[24:47] amen God bless you friends you can be
[24:49] seated
[25:04] and um
[25:06] excuse me one minute I
[25:09] realized that I missed one of my prayer
[25:11] requests I've had a number of prayer
[25:12] requests come in
[25:14] and I got one from
[25:17] my sister earlier today and I meant to
[25:20] read it and meant to
[25:22] post it here in my notes but I failed to
[25:24] do that so let me just catch that or
[25:26] I'll forget it sure is anything
[25:28] it's not brother Lisa that would be
[25:30] Sister Lisa
[25:33] amen
[25:35] praise the Lord have a number of prayer
[25:37] requests we'll get to them just at the
[25:39] end praise God now
[25:42] it's amazing
[25:44] um the scripture that we read and how
[25:47] that God really
[25:50] is not um how would I say this he's not
[25:54] you know mincing words and he's not
[25:56] trying to you know sometimes if you come
[25:58] in a situation and you ever hear the old
[26:01] term the elephant in the room and it's
[26:02] the thing nobody wants to talk about and
[26:04] everybody just kind of avoids it in this
[26:06] the air is awkward because everybody
[26:07] knows what needs to be said but nobody
[26:09] wants to say it and God just walks down
[26:12] into our building tonight and just says
[26:14] hey I'm going to talk about the elephant
[26:16] in the room whether it looks successful
[26:18] or whether it looks like a failure
[26:19] you're still Victorious
[26:21] and and whatever you do don't don't be
[26:25] afraid to say hey I'm in the middle of a
[26:27] trial and I need prayer because that's
[26:29] part of the program
[26:31] that we in fact is that we find out that
[26:33] you know we we none of us like this idea
[26:37] and even brother Brandon would talk
[26:39] about you know it's too bad it has to be
[26:40] this way but sometimes situations uh
[26:44] occur in our lives Trials Come
[26:46] afflictions come and it's all for our
[26:48] gain it's all for our advancement it's
[26:51] all to build character because there's
[26:53] just no way to build human character
[26:55] apart from suffering
[26:58] you you literally have to have the
[27:01] contrast you it's impossible for you to
[27:04] appreciate a sunny day without a rainy
[27:08] day now you might say oh no I'd like
[27:10] every if every day was sunny I promise
[27:12] you after a while you'd be glad to have
[27:15] a rainy day you can't appreciate real
[27:18] happiness without a contrast of some
[27:20] sadness you can't appreciate gain
[27:22] without loss what I'm really glad is
[27:25] that when we cross into a new heavens
[27:28] and a new Earth and I made some comments
[27:30] about this on Sunday uh at the memorial
[27:33] service for sister Jan there that when
[27:35] we have that body and in that new
[27:37] heavens and in that new world and in
[27:39] that new everything where everything is
[27:42] God and God is everything in expression
[27:44] and there's not any iota of anything
[27:47] else that's not him an expression
[27:50] think of it friends there in that
[27:53] condition you won't need contrast
[27:58] you'll never have to come in the Aeons
[28:00] of time back to a hardship and a trial
[28:03] and a suffering and a loss or separation
[28:06] all is peace forever more on that happy
[28:09] Golden Shore
[28:11] and you know you know if we be honest we
[28:14] we long for that none of us you know I I
[28:16] I feel this way a lot that Lord I I
[28:21] wouldn't that you hasten your coming but
[28:24] yet I don't want a shortcut
[28:26] you know I I do want to be there but I
[28:29] don't want to be there till it's over
[28:30] and I I don't want to go ahead I want us
[28:33] all to go together amen and I and I I
[28:36] feel that way very genuinely and very
[28:39] sincerely and I I say Lord give me give
[28:43] me strength to I want to be like poets
[28:45] nothing wrong with wanting to go Paul
[28:47] wanted to go
[28:49] Paul said I'm in a great Strait
[28:51] see because I'd like to I'd like to be
[28:54] on the other side having seen it I'd
[28:56] like to go back but for your sakes it's
[28:59] better if I stay and so humanly speaking
[29:01] I'm in this I'm in this quandary in my
[29:04] spirit and and so but you have to
[29:07] understand that Paul reached a place
[29:09] where he could actually say I have I
[29:11] have ran my race I have finished my
[29:13] course and I ran it well
[29:17] and I finished my course and you know I
[29:19] I I I feel like with this world is is
[29:23] every day less and less my home but
[29:26] really friends if you just uh bear in
[29:29] mind that it's only the world order
[29:31] that's so uh abrasive to you it's only
[29:35] the world order this world was built for
[29:38] you and there's great Heavenly Joys and
[29:41] realities that lay just ahead for every
[29:43] last one of us
[29:45] and I just I just every day I wake up
[29:47] and I thank God for life and I thank him
[29:49] for Liberty and I thank him for Faith
[29:51] and I'm thinking for a determination to
[29:53] keep pressing
[29:58] especially as I began to
[30:01] see the security of the believer the
[30:04] more more and more in the word every day
[30:08] we see it we I I I believe that we're
[30:12] coming to it and I think it's happening
[30:14] to us all I know that we struggle with
[30:16] insecurities I get that we're human
[30:18] beings sadly
[30:19] but the but the bottom line is the
[30:21] prophet said you know when the bride
[30:23] recognizes who she is then that that's
[30:26] really the that's really the Catalyst
[30:29] that's that's going to give you the kind
[30:32] of Faith you need say well I how what
[30:35] kind of Faith do I need how do I get it
[30:36] I will say to you tonight don't worry
[30:38] because he who's made the plan has got
[30:41] the remedy he's got the solution you
[30:44] understand that when he came to Abraham
[30:46] we made this comment in part one when he
[30:49] came to Abraham God not only gave him
[30:51] the promise but he gave him the
[30:54] requirement and he gave him the goods
[30:57] he gave him a promise and said now
[30:59] here's the requirement but I'm going to
[31:00] go ahead and give it to you and the
[31:02] whole thing came in one ball of Wax
[31:04] and Abraham believed God and from that
[31:07] moment nothing no failure of Abraham no
[31:11] backsliding no nothing uh nor that
[31:14] promise it couldn't have known it
[31:15] because it was a unconditional Covenant
[31:20] and the bride is realizing today that
[31:23] God is the one who called us God is the
[31:26] one who issued the requirement and God
[31:28] has provided the solution to his own
[31:31] demand
[31:32] and the more I absorb that the more I
[31:35] see that the more that becomes a reality
[31:38] to me and I say it almost every day
[31:40] because I see my weaknesses every day I
[31:43] see my stumblings every day and so I I
[31:46] just want to say to the devil take that
[31:48] devil because you tricked me but that
[31:51] made my faith stronger and now I love
[31:54] God even more and I hate you even more
[31:56] and I want Heaven even more and I want
[31:59] even more separation
[32:03] the devil can't win for losing
[32:06] he could actually win if he wasn't
[32:08] always losing
[32:12] Adam's part as we
[32:15] we made this I've got several lines that
[32:17] just to just to connect back to part one
[32:20] because it was more than a month ago
[32:23] but Adam's part I'm sorry Abraham's part
[32:26] was to hear
[32:28] and to recognize or to believe hearing
[32:31] recognizing or hearing receiving or
[32:33] hearing believing and acting
[32:36] so receiving believing recognizing
[32:39] brother Branham would use those terms
[32:41] all to mean the same thing it's the
[32:42] middle category his part was to hear it
[32:45] his part was to recognize it to receive
[32:49] it to believe it and then once he had
[32:52] accomplished that second part he was to
[32:55] act upon it
[32:57] in real time
[32:59] thank you brother
[33:01] and so we can see in the Bible
[33:05] and and this this is such a beautiful
[33:07] thing if you would just absorb this for
[33:09] your own life tonight listen the Bible
[33:12] says that Abraham staggered not at the
[33:15] promise he didn't say Abraham staggered
[33:17] not
[33:21] we all fall short
[33:23] all of us do there's none good only
[33:25] Jesus was the perfect one
[33:27] it didn't say Abraham didn't stumble it
[33:29] is said he didn't stagger at the promise
[33:31] he did he had all brother we can read in
[33:34] the Bible and that hey harry fled the
[33:37] promised land to Egypt and a prophet in
[33:38] this day said as soon as a Jew leads the
[33:40] promised land he's backslid so I can say
[33:42] on the authority of scripture
[33:43] interpreted by a prophet Abraham
[33:45] backslid that don't don't faint
[33:48] don't throw something at me Abraham
[33:50] backslid how do you not read it
[33:53] he got down there lying trying to save
[33:56] his own skin and that was God's
[33:58] predestinated elected and charge free
[34:00] prophet
[34:02] the unindictable prophet of God was down
[34:06] there conniving and sneaking and lying
[34:08] and did God let him get away with it no
[34:10] did God let the rest of Egypt get away
[34:12] with it sure but not Abraham God let the
[34:15] world go right on but he won't let you
[34:17] go right on because you're his child
[34:21] and he'll bring the rod of Correction or
[34:23] this a direct tape teaching brother
[34:25] Branham says you'll do wrong direct
[34:27] quote you'll willfully do wrong it
[34:29] doesn't mean you're not a son it just
[34:31] means the rod of Correction is on the
[34:34] way
[34:36] he stumbled in weakness yet
[34:39] but in his faith he never staggered at
[34:41] the promise
[34:42] he kept going say how do you know he
[34:44] never staggered because he kept going
[34:47] how do you know he didn't stagger the
[34:48] promise because when he stumbled in his
[34:50] flesh he kept going
[34:51] and he repented and he and he turned his
[34:54] feet and went back to the promised land
[34:57] Hallelujah
[34:59] we find him coming up again lying
[35:02] Abraham had had these ticking time bombs
[35:05] I preached on that some years ago at the
[35:06] men's meeting
[35:07] he just had these ticking time bombs and
[35:09] all it took was the right circumstance
[35:11] we've got those
[35:13] we can be ever so spit feel ever so
[35:16] spiritual in church and we do but you
[35:19] know as well as I know and I know that
[35:21] you know and you know that I know we all
[35:23] know that we know that sometimes if
[35:25] we're not careful and our prayer life
[35:27] gets waning our church attendance wanes
[35:30] and our fellowship Wings all Satan has
[35:32] to do is get you in the right
[35:33] circumstance at the right place at the
[35:36] right time and the right thing happened
[35:37] and you've got a problem
[35:40] oh but I'm here to tell you once Abraham
[35:43] had that promised son once the office of
[35:46] son was on the scene Abraham never fell
[35:49] again he never staggered again and what
[35:51] do we have today but the ministry of the
[35:54] son of man it's back among us and this
[35:56] bride is recognizing who she is
[36:05] when we read that 40th verse and here's
[36:07] the last point that I wanted to make
[36:09] from part one
[36:11] and I'm saying other things that wasn't
[36:12] there but I wanted to for sure
[36:14] get these two or three here and here's
[36:16] the last one
[36:17] that 40th verse when we read that 40th
[36:20] verse and Paul saying to the to the to
[36:23] the New Testament era Church
[36:26] and at first 39 40 and these all
[36:29] in the Old Testament having obtained a
[36:32] good report through faith and they had
[36:34] even been resurrected and went with
[36:36] Christ
[36:37] on Resurrection morning
[36:40] amen
[36:42] and we we were talking about it with
[36:44] some Brothers Here recently
[36:45] because if you look at the qualification
[36:48] brother Branham said not every the Bible
[36:51] says that many of the Saints which slept
[36:55] arose
[36:57] see remember that
[37:00] that you've had a Remnant in every age
[37:02] and I don't want to get too deep
[37:04] teaching on this tonight I just want to
[37:05] make a quick mention of it but just
[37:07] remember that many of the graves many of
[37:10] the bodies of the Saints would slap Rose
[37:11] don't forget that the remnant the
[37:13] foolish virgin are called Saints they
[37:16] are called righteous they are called
[37:17] Sanctified ones so you understand but
[37:20] but they're not in the in the Millennium
[37:22] they don't go in the Rapture only only
[37:25] the redeemed go in the Rapture and you
[37:27] see that type not all of the bodies of
[37:30] the Saints which slept the rose but many
[37:32] of them did but brother Branham said not
[37:34] all of them did just because they were a
[37:36] Jew
[37:37] because not all Israel's Israel
[37:40] and so we find that brother Branham said
[37:42] not all of them Rose but who Rose it was
[37:45] those who with sincerity
[37:48] that they maintained in their lifetime a
[37:52] deep sincerity before God because they
[37:54] couldn't even be born again to the level
[37:56] in the soul that you can be by the Holy
[37:59] Ghost baptism it wasn't given yet you
[38:01] understand but yet without that that
[38:03] those gragged men and women of faith and
[38:06] young people of faith
[38:08] it didn't matter that that Joseph was
[38:11] young he he refused he refused to offend
[38:14] God it didn't matter that however young
[38:17] they were it didn't matter how young
[38:19] Samuel was and he was from a young boy
[38:22] ready to serve God
[38:24] and those men in Daniel with no church
[38:27] to go to for 60 years
[38:30] didn't even couldn't go to a church
[38:32] service like you and I go didn't have
[38:34] any Fellowship of anybody he had
[38:36] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego but they
[38:38] had actually been appointed Governors
[38:39] and rulers and Scattered across the
[38:41] kingdom he rarely saw them
[38:44] he literally sustained himself without
[38:47] the Holy Ghost experience like you have
[38:50] now he had plenty of experiences with
[38:52] the Holy Ghost but not bringing a a new
[38:55] birth like you have the right where it
[38:58] destroys the old nature this is what
[39:00] weary David brother Branham said because
[39:02] David knew the word should somehow live
[39:05] stronger he just knew it
[39:06] it should live stronger he said I I
[39:09] don't understand him brother Brown said
[39:10] it wearing him because he said you know
[39:12] I I tied it to my bed post I've put it
[39:15] between my eyes I meditate upon it day
[39:18] and night but brother Branham said it
[39:19] wearing him because he couldn't make it
[39:21] live out like he somehow knew it ought
[39:24] to
[39:25] and I say
[39:27] blessed be the name of the Lord you
[39:29] don't have to suffer David's weary
[39:32] you can pass from Death unto life and
[39:34] get a new nature
[39:36] and you're going to need it because the
[39:38] world is many many hundreds of times
[39:40] more evil than in the days of David
[39:43] but I'm here to tell you God has given
[39:45] us the requirement and has given us the
[39:47] solution and he's provided the sacrifice
[39:52] and this is all part of a bride
[39:54] understanding who she is and that's
[39:55] where her strength comes from
[39:58] because they
[39:59] those graves are the ones which arose
[40:02] they obviously they couldn't rise
[40:04] because they were lineage to Abraham
[40:07] because Jesus talked to people who were
[40:09] the lineage of Abraham and they were the
[40:11] children of the devil
[40:14] they said we have Abraham to Our Father
[40:15] and Jesus didn't argue that wouldn't
[40:17] have done him any good because they had
[40:19] family records they could prove it
[40:21] but they were of their father the devil
[40:23] because they're the spirit of the devil
[40:25] and it didn't matter that they could or
[40:28] couldn't keep the law it had nothing to
[40:30] do coming out of the Grave wasn't that
[40:32] they kept the law because frankly if you
[40:34] offended in the least you're guilty of
[40:36] the whole the problem with keeping the
[40:38] law is nobody could
[40:41] if anyone could Jesus wouldn't have had
[40:43] to
[40:44] the fact that he had to prove that's why
[40:46] he gave him the law to prove to him they
[40:47] couldn't keep it
[40:49] oh God gave him an unconditional
[40:51] Covenant gave him a prophet gave him a
[40:53] pillar of fire and they did and they
[40:55] wanted something to do in their own I'm
[40:57] here to tell you tonight I don't want
[40:59] none of my own my own's no good my own
[41:02] frustrates me I want his and his alone
[41:06] Hallelujah
[41:13] so we realize that this is the this is
[41:16] the strength what brought them out of
[41:18] the grave
[41:19] what's that they had brother and said it
[41:21] was those that had that sincere
[41:25] that's a powerful word that's sincere
[41:29] Faith like Abraham had that constant
[41:32] Never Say Die never say quit never say
[41:36] Retreat that constant sincerity it
[41:39] didn't matter come what may they were
[41:41] going to serve Jehovah they had their
[41:43] ups and downs they were men and women of
[41:45] like passions brother said it meant they
[41:48] had their ups and downs but yet they
[41:50] kept pressing they kept pressing and
[41:52] that's the day and I'll an hour that I
[41:54] live in say how do you know you're going
[41:55] to Rapture because I know I got that
[41:56] same sincerity so how do you know you
[41:59] got that because I know it in my life
[42:00] you say do you make mistakes I do but
[42:03] that but that tells them a Believer
[42:05] because I repent and I press on and I
[42:08] press on and I press on and I'm pressing
[42:10] tonight and I'll be pressing tomorrow
[42:14] and there's no possibility I've already
[42:17] passed the point of no return there is
[42:19] no possibility for them the devil to
[42:21] turn me around
[42:24] short of a new birth you can be turned
[42:26] around trust me
[42:28] if you can be persuaded and you can be
[42:30] dissuaded out brother Burley says
[42:33] brother Jason I learned a long time ago
[42:36] if somebody can get you in with a hot
[42:37] dog somebody gets you out with a
[42:39] hamburger
[42:43] I said barley you're the only one who
[42:44] would ever come up with that
[42:46] and I that is so true
[42:50] but this verse 40 Paul is telling them
[42:53] with everything you had without us you
[42:56] could never be made perfect
[42:58] and that and he was talking to the
[43:00] church that thought the Rapture was
[43:02] imminent unaware it would it would take
[43:04] seven Church ages
[43:06] and two 20 centuries
[43:08] and we're still here and now we look
[43:11] back and go oh you think so Paul guess
[43:14] what without us you can't be made
[43:16] perfect
[43:18] what it what that 39th and 40th verse
[43:21] means is that there was still more to do
[43:24] I know we're tired I know we're weary I
[43:27] know the world is evil but there's still
[43:28] more to do
[43:30] we gotta press harder because if we were
[43:32] done we'd be gone
[43:38] we have a sure Foundation tonight
[43:42] so
[43:44] we find then that
[43:46] this ability to hear and to recognize
[43:49] and act on the revealed word
[43:53] that's that's that's literally how it's
[43:55] got to come these Cycles I don't want to
[43:57] get too too bogged down tonight
[44:00] in teaching because I may carry this
[44:02] over into Sunday I don't know yet I
[44:04] don't have my marching orders yet I've
[44:06] got a lot of material don't know exactly
[44:08] how it'll go this here's a month coming
[44:10] after part one so that just gives you
[44:11] some idea of how it can go I don't get
[44:14] to choose it
[44:17] but but we find then that
[44:19] you know you you can you can see all of
[44:23] these these types if you go back
[44:25] and you you look at Adam
[44:28] and I'm just I'm just going to drop this
[44:30] pert Venture the Lord will let me pick
[44:32] it back up this weekend if he won't I'll
[44:34] remind you of it again
[44:36] amen
[44:38] so when you go back and you look at Adam
[44:40] free fall
[44:41] you're really seeing a really awesome
[44:45] parallel
[44:46] to the believer today Born Again of the
[44:50] spirit of God
[44:51] because he he talked with God he had
[44:53] fellowship with God and that's what the
[44:56] Holy Ghost restored it restored that
[44:58] lost Fellowship from Eden
[45:01] see and so we have that that that was a
[45:05] perfect type of a holy ghost that's why
[45:07] brother Branham said the third part of
[45:10] the Restoration in the back part of his
[45:12] mind was to restore the kingdom that's
[45:14] us to our rightly I love that word that
[45:17] means it's your rights
[45:19] you have a right to go back to that kind
[45:22] of a life that Adam enjoyed you have a
[45:24] right and I'm here to tell you some
[45:25] friends we are on our road there and
[45:27] you're already part of the way because
[45:29] your your soul is already crossed the
[45:32] across the chasm of sin and it's back in
[45:35] the presence of God brother Branham said
[45:36] it's already back on the other side
[45:38] sitting in the presence of God in
[45:40] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[45:44] don't think linearly because you'll get
[45:46] messed up quantum mechanics is proving
[45:48] that quantum theory is proving that
[45:49] today like never before I just was
[45:51] reading a statement from one of the
[45:54] leading professors and experts and he
[45:57] was quoting the pioneer of quantum
[46:00] theory and quantum mechanics and Quantum
[46:02] uh physics
[46:04] and he said and he made he made this
[46:06] statement I don't have it in front of me
[46:07] so it's not an exact quote but he he
[46:09] basically said that
[46:11] what they discovered in the quantum
[46:14] world
[46:15] that everything in this world
[46:18] that we consider real
[46:22] is made up of things
[46:24] that actually can't be real
[46:30] it's a whole they're they're they're
[46:32] they're beginning to get a whole
[46:34] paradigm shift I'm here to tell you
[46:35] they're starting to get a little bit of
[46:37] a a little bit of a crack into
[46:40] understanding that this great Creator
[46:42] and and I I had a quote today from
[46:44] Brother Eugene concerning Albert
[46:46] Einstein and he was just he was just
[46:48] trying to implore right before he's he's
[46:50] passing away that he said all my years
[46:53] and all my years of pondering and musing
[46:55] on this he said I have I am no closer
[46:57] today than fine in one question he said
[46:59] I'm no closer today to finding the
[47:01] answer to this impenetrable question and
[47:03] he's really looking for what's how did
[47:06] life start and what life is and I'm here
[47:09] to tell you something friends without
[47:10] going any further into it tonight I'll
[47:12] go to it deeper in the future but but
[47:14] don't don't get so wrapped up in what
[47:18] you see around you and let me say don't
[47:21] get so twisted and bent and discouraged
[47:23] by it don't don't go lusting after it
[47:26] because it ain't what you think it is
[47:28] and don't get discouraged by it because
[47:30] it ain't what the devil's telling you it
[47:32] is
[47:33] I'm here to tell you we've got something
[47:35] ahead of us where he and that word are
[47:38] going to become what you never dreamed
[47:40] possible
[47:46] say well but Adam
[47:48] Free Fall he had a perfect body he did
[47:52] but in understanding you outstrip him
[47:54] because he he understood nothing of
[47:56] redemption
[47:57] he didn't understand a A Healer a
[48:00] provider a savior a captain he don't
[48:04] understand any of those things
[48:05] and and so now we come today I'm here to
[48:08] take something friends being born in sin
[48:11] and and let me just say this to you I
[48:14] don't care where the devil took you to
[48:16] in sin once you have passed from Death
[48:19] to life you become more valuable to God
[48:22] having made all of those mistakes you
[48:24] become more valuable to God after being
[48:28] born in sin and come into the world
[48:30] speaking lies and I get that it can scar
[48:32] up our life and I get that it can put
[48:34] baggage on our life but I'm here to tell
[48:35] you if you can overcome all of that and
[48:38] stand Victorious you are a greater
[48:40] testimony we got a testimony service
[48:42] tonight you become a testimony
[48:45] you become Hebrews chapter 11. they're
[48:49] still writing verses about you and me
[48:54] oh
[49:00] brother Branham comes to
[49:06] proving his word and
[49:09] it's amazing because
[49:12] I've been
[49:13] wanting to
[49:15] hear this for a while and
[49:17] and a brother on our call-in
[49:21] brother Jack quoted from it
[49:24] and uh and so I thought and I actually
[49:26] copied and pasted the quote
[49:29] into notes that I'll either get to
[49:31] tonight but maybe not tonight but maybe
[49:32] Sunday
[49:34] and and so while I'm sitting there
[49:36] working and in the afternoon
[49:38] Mr Debbie nice our as our custom and
[49:40] we've got a tape playing so I just went
[49:42] for her just pick pick one and I just
[49:44] picked this one I said well let me just
[49:45] hear the whole thing
[49:47] and it opens up one that's brother
[49:49] Andrew said twice this one is from
[49:51] August the 16th 1964 preached it again
[49:54] in 65.
[49:55] but here's where he begins to tell and
[49:58] he told it a number of places this was a
[50:00] lot of detail here about the Caribou
[50:03] with 42 inch horns and the Silver Tip
[50:06] grizzly bear that he got both and
[50:07] prophesied and told him months in
[50:09] advance about how it would happen and
[50:11] gave detail all kinds of detail and and
[50:15] I and I thought tonight that that I
[50:17] might just take a look at this and and
[50:19] bring us bring let me try to bring to
[50:21] you
[50:22] my heart if I can is that okay I'm going
[50:26] to do it in a way I've never done it but
[50:28] it's how I feel it
[50:30] and so
[50:32] brother Branham picks up here and he
[50:34] says
[50:35] now he's going to give this testimony
[50:37] before he actually preaches a sermon and
[50:39] I'm just going to read through the
[50:40] testimony and comment to you as the Lord
[50:42] laid it on the heart and then we're
[50:44] going to wrap up and take up prayer
[50:47] request and give you an opportunity
[50:48] because listen uh
[50:51] testimonies are popping everywhere
[50:53] I'm constantly getting texts and phone
[50:55] calls God got several just in the last
[50:58] 48 hours got three I hadn't even heard
[51:00] it all and more and more things are
[51:03] happening I'm here to tell you something
[51:04] God God's busy
[51:07] and I don't know if you've noticed it or
[51:09] not but the world's getting really bad
[51:11] and I believe we're getting really close
[51:14] oh my I believe we're getting so close
[51:17] to the whole world I I was looking at a
[51:21] at a headline which was rather
[51:23] nauseating but but I it caught my
[51:25] attention because I remembered that
[51:29] back in 2019 there was a headliner right
[51:33] before the pandemic there was a headline
[51:35] about a state championship some young
[51:38] woman who had won you know I think she
[51:41] was maybe Miss Texas I don't remember if
[51:43] that might stand correction but I
[51:44] believe it was Texas
[51:45] and uh and that and of course that
[51:48] wouldn't be the to attract me but what
[51:51] attracted me was
[51:53] she was he was the first in history
[51:57] to win a Miss beauty contest
[52:00] because he was a trans man
[52:02] and I know politically they want me to
[52:05] say a trans woman hear me political
[52:07] world I ain't saying it
[52:10] I ain't saying it
[52:13] it's a dude
[52:16] dress up like a girl
[52:18] and some some some repulsive
[52:23] non-called non-genuine doctor
[52:26] tampered with what God did
[52:28] and got paid for it
[52:30] and you think this world isn't corrupt
[52:34] and he won Miss Texas or missed whatever
[52:36] state it was and then last year he made
[52:40] headlines again because he actually won
[52:43] he won the Miss USA pageant
[52:46] and he's a fellow filipino-american man
[52:50] so Filipino men are slight and small and
[52:53] so he's he's got features that he was
[52:55] you know with enough surgery and enough
[52:57] hormones he was able to make himself an
[52:59] enough Max Factor
[53:00] it's still still pretty ugly I don't see
[53:03] how he won
[53:05] but he did but it's political it's
[53:07] probably why he won in fact is that was
[53:09] the argument they're saying it's all
[53:11] rigged because they wanted him to win it
[53:13] because everybody was so proud that he's
[53:15] a trans man
[53:17] made to look like a woman I'm not here
[53:20] for political stump tonight I just want
[53:21] to throw this in
[53:23] and so
[53:25] today
[53:26] I catch the headline and it's this guy
[53:29] again
[53:30] and now he's not only went to the state
[53:32] level he won the nation
[53:35] he won the Miss USA
[53:37] in in a in a in a hole I forget how many
[53:41] you know probably 50 I guess I don't
[53:43] know I don't watch it thank God I guess
[53:45] 50 contestants would be in a Miss USA
[53:47] and here are women who have spent their
[53:51] whole life beautifying themselves rather
[53:53] in an ungodly fashion no doubt and
[53:55] here's some man born a man gets a
[53:58] surgery and puts on Max Factor and
[54:00] there's enough political pressure to
[54:01] give him the crown
[54:03] and set and set 49 ladies aside 49 women
[54:08] I won't call them ladies
[54:10] well guess what's the headline today he
[54:12] went on to the Miss Universe Pageant 28
[54:15] Nations represented guess who you want
[54:18] to guess who won
[54:20] and there's they're calling it
[54:21] conspiracy because because you know he's
[54:24] he's definitely I mean and I saw a
[54:27] picture and I started I could have put
[54:28] it up tonight it was perfectly decent
[54:30] he's standing there with his crown and
[54:32] his flowers and there's I forget what do
[54:33] they call that Boca where the women
[54:35] behind him are in blur uh so you
[54:37] couldn't even see it too good I could
[54:38] have actually put it up but I could tell
[54:41] that by worldly standards by worldly
[54:43] standards the women standing behind him
[54:46] had had spent years and and were by the
[54:49] world standards beautiful now brother
[54:50] Benham said a real Son of God don't call
[54:52] that beautiful
[54:54] because it's fake anyway
[54:58] but here he is I could just as a human I
[55:01] could make the observation that he's
[55:03] less attractive
[55:05] but yet he wins the Miss Universe and I
[55:08] said to my wife I showed it to my wife I
[55:09] said this is the seal
[55:11] this goes to show you that the
[55:13] homosexual perverted agenda is now the
[55:17] king of the world
[55:18] that spirit is now global and the whole
[55:22] Global Community they know it was
[55:23] political all the lady contestants are
[55:26] up in Arrow ripsing it was all political
[55:28] of course it was political but that goes
[55:31] to show you the day and hour the day of
[55:33] Sodom the day of lot and the day of Noah
[55:36] we are right in the middle of it
[55:38] [Applause]
[55:41] Hallelujah
[55:43] I'm here to tell you something friend
[55:44] you I'm not here to to to to get on a
[55:48] stop and say oh it's hell it's horrible
[55:49] oh it's horrible I'm I'm here to get In
[55:51] a Pulpit and say we're almost home we're
[55:53] almost home we're almost home
[55:55] Hallelujah
[56:02] brother Branham says
[56:06] he's telling he went off with bud
[56:08] southwickened I don't know if you've
[56:10] ever heard Bud's testimony it's quite
[56:11] amazing
[56:14] he's went on to Glory now but they
[56:15] recorded his testimony years ago sitting
[56:17] by a campfire and he
[56:19] he corroborates everything brother
[56:20] Brandon is saying and even when brother
[56:22] Brandon was telling the story brother
[56:24] biscal is in the congregation and he was
[56:26] on this hunt he's the little guy in a
[56:29] green checkered shirt didn't think he
[56:30] had one
[56:31] forgot he didn't even know it was in his
[56:33] bag in fact is when he when he got it
[56:36] out he said I was actually a little
[56:38] upset at my wife because it had gotten
[56:41] torn and it was worn out and I had told
[56:43] my wife throw this thing in the trash
[56:46] sister Ruth being The Frugal housewife
[56:48] she mended it and stuck it in his
[56:50] hunting bag said well you can wear it
[56:51] hunting
[56:53] men don't like it when they get
[56:54] overruled by their wives in secret
[56:57] there's nothing he'd do about it when he
[56:59] got in the wilderness there was his
[57:00] shirt
[57:02] but but God knew before the foundation
[57:04] of the world
[57:06] God had already took a prophet forward
[57:09] in time and I don't want to even use the
[57:12] word I use the word for because we think
[57:13] of time as linear but time's not linear
[57:16] time is eternal time and we're talking
[57:18] about he took him not into time but he
[57:19] took him into eternity
[57:21] where brother Branham said where I can
[57:24] stand here and look back there and he
[57:26] said and I know I'm standing in this
[57:29] building and hoping people can still
[57:31] hear me but I'm somewhere else and I'm
[57:32] looking back in someone's past
[57:34] and then I can see him standing right in
[57:36] front of me and I can see him in the
[57:37] past
[57:39] and when he comes out he's not even sure
[57:41] what he even said I'm here to tell you
[57:42] something friends there's Realms and
[57:43] worlds of Realms we know nothing about
[57:48] but he'd already seen him standing there
[57:49] in that green checkered shirt brother
[57:52] Brandon picks up the story I gotta hurry
[57:55] he says when I got over
[57:57] got the character he talks about blood
[57:58] he says Bud told he said brother Branham
[58:00] and they talked about this this this
[58:02] great animal with 42 inch horns didn't
[58:05] make sense to Bud
[58:06] he said you know where we're going to
[58:08] there's there isn't that kind of an
[58:09] animal brother Brandon he said there
[58:10] maybe it'll be a different hunting trip
[58:12] brother I said no it's this one
[58:14] he said well brother Brown and I've
[58:15] hunted these Hills for all my life he
[58:18] said I'm telling you we're going into
[58:19] sheep country
[58:20] the animal you're talking about doesn't
[58:22] exist up there they don't live up there
[58:24] at all they're nowhere around us we'd
[58:26] have to go a long ways to get to them
[58:28] and so he says well we'll go and so the
[58:31] next day you know they're sitting by the
[58:34] campfire and they're getting ready to
[58:35] start out and Bud says well brother
[58:36] Branham says look
[58:38] said brother says you know we couldn't
[58:40] find them they weren't didn't seem to be
[58:41] anywhere and Bud said well look if you
[58:43] don't mind A Long Walk he said me and
[58:45] you can walk he said we go over this
[58:46] mountain range he said no that's a long
[58:48] walk brother Branham but if you don't
[58:49] mind brother Adam said well I like
[58:51] walking and uh and he he did he loved
[58:54] walking and brother brother Perry green
[58:56] tells how that brother Brandon when he
[58:58] was remember when he was shot at 14 and
[59:00] it tore all the muscle out of the back
[59:02] of his of his thighs
[59:04] and so if it is so the back of his legs
[59:07] on his thighs were just gone where the
[59:09] shotgun blew through him and so brother
[59:12] Branham actually developed a little
[59:14] tricky way to walk where he and I don't
[59:17] understand how it worked but he walked
[59:19] somehow from his knees down and he he it
[59:22] wasn't all about swinging his hips or
[59:23] moving moving the upper part of his legs
[59:26] and he could walk for 10 20 30 miles
[59:28] over mountainous ranges like that
[59:31] so he said but I like to walk and so
[59:32] away they went and just as sure as
[59:35] anything just exactly what a prophet
[59:36] said They Came Upon that caribou and
[59:39] brother Branham took him with a shot and
[59:41] Bud was astounded and they they dressed
[59:43] him and now they're trying to pack him
[59:45] back and brother M talks about you know
[59:47] we're carrying that big rack in that
[59:48] cape and man it's hot and we had to get
[59:51] down near Glacier you hear you're here
[59:52] until it he says he says now when I got
[59:55] over and got the caribou and Bud said to
[59:58] me now brother Branham you say these
[1:00:02] horns are 42 inches I said that's what
[1:00:05] they'll be he said looks to me like 92.
[1:00:10] and I said no they're 42 inches
[1:00:14] and he said now and he he was using that
[1:00:17] as a Segway see
[1:00:19] he's going to compliment brother Brandon
[1:00:21] before he insults him
[1:00:24] and he said now according to what you
[1:00:26] told me before we get back down to that
[1:00:30] boy down there with the checkered shirt
[1:00:32] on which no one knew there was a boy
[1:00:34] with a checkered shirt because brother
[1:00:36] Branham had already asked everybody in
[1:00:38] the camp you had a trick or church no
[1:00:39] ask brother Eddie you got to check her
[1:00:40] shirt no
[1:00:42] he didn't know it was in the bag he
[1:00:44] didn't know that God had predestinated
[1:00:45] before the foundation of the world and
[1:00:47] nothing could keep it out of that bag
[1:00:49] that bag could have caught on fire that
[1:00:50] shirt would have survived
[1:00:54] that bag could have got trapped under a
[1:00:56] nice Glacier the shirt would have
[1:00:57] floated to the top I don't know a bird
[1:00:59] would have carried it I don't know
[1:01:01] but he would have had that shirt on
[1:01:04] and so he says
[1:01:06] we're going before we get back down
[1:01:08] there to that boy with a checkered shirt
[1:01:10] on Eddie
[1:01:11] where they was going to meet us down
[1:01:13] below the mountain couple miles said
[1:01:14] you're going to kill a grizzly bear
[1:01:18] I said it's thus saith the Lord
[1:01:21] I just thought about that confidence
[1:01:24] that there he's standing with a guide
[1:01:26] who has hunted those areas he's a
[1:01:27] brother Brenham I've never seen one up
[1:01:29] here not a silver tip no way he said
[1:01:31] I've sent a sense a boy he said I've
[1:01:34] been all over these mountains brother
[1:01:36] Branham there are no silver tips they're
[1:01:38] much further away from here
[1:01:40] and he said well but he didn't believe
[1:01:41] the Caribou he didn't I mean he he said
[1:01:44] that animal is not around and the bear
[1:01:46] the Bear's not around and this must be
[1:01:48] the wrong hunting trip but it wasn't
[1:01:51] and he said now according to what you
[1:01:53] told me before we get back down there
[1:01:55] you're going to kill a grizzly bear I
[1:01:56] said it's thus saith the Lord he said
[1:01:58] brother Branham
[1:01:59] where is he coming from
[1:02:01] I can see from 50 miles around brother
[1:02:03] Branham says this now was way up above
[1:02:05] the Timberline up where sheep lived
[1:02:07] there's no no trees you're on the top of
[1:02:10] a high mountain any of you who have been
[1:02:12] in in western states and you know Big
[1:02:15] Sky country and I mean you can see like
[1:02:18] that they take powerful glass for uh
[1:02:21] scoping and things like that and when
[1:02:23] you get on top of those you know there's
[1:02:25] no trees there's no nothing and you can
[1:02:26] just see for as far like a pilot and you
[1:02:29] got visibility all around you and he
[1:02:32] says brother Branham I can see from 50
[1:02:34] miles around us
[1:02:36] where there's where's he even gonna be
[1:02:38] hiding there's no even nowhere to hide
[1:02:40] him
[1:02:42] he says brother Brandon where is he
[1:02:44] going to come from I can see for 50
[1:02:46] miles around
[1:02:48] and I said
[1:02:49] he's still Jehovah Jireh
[1:02:53] Abraham was on a Mountaintop
[1:02:55] where no Ram would have survived a day
[1:02:59] wouldn't have survived a day with the
[1:03:01] Predators and Abraham is standing right
[1:03:03] there and there's no Ram anywhere until
[1:03:05] he needs it and Jehovah Jireh provided
[1:03:08] him on the spot
[1:03:13] you know why you know why Jehovah did
[1:03:15] that brother Brahm said because his word
[1:03:16] had already declared it
[1:03:19] he says I said he's still Jehovah Jireh
[1:03:23] the Lord can provide for himself see he
[1:03:26] can make squirrels coming to existence
[1:03:27] if he can make a ram come into existence
[1:03:30] if he has spoken about a bear a bear can
[1:03:34] come into existence
[1:03:39] you know I
[1:03:40] I look around
[1:03:43] my life
[1:03:45] in the world
[1:03:46] and I feel like
[1:03:48] I got a good visibility I can see for 50
[1:03:50] miles around my life
[1:03:53] I can see
[1:03:55] you know I can see all the way back to
[1:03:56] where
[1:03:57] I began this journey I have memories
[1:03:59] that go back to Childhood I remember
[1:04:02] the family that lived at 309 Hawthorne
[1:04:05] Drive
[1:04:06] and there was five of us strong and one
[1:04:08] was not because he was taken as an
[1:04:10] infant
[1:04:11] and now out of that family that sat
[1:04:14] around that table
[1:04:15] and drove to church in a car the remains
[1:04:18] myself my sister and my mother
[1:04:22] and I remember it like it was yesterday
[1:04:24] I remember standing in I remember one
[1:04:26] time standing in the bathroom and I got
[1:04:28] up on stood up on the toilet and looked
[1:04:31] in the mirror because I was nine and I
[1:04:33] wanted to see how I looked When I Was
[1:04:34] This Tall
[1:04:43] that's the truth I remember walking out
[1:04:45] on my porch and thinking I wonder how
[1:04:47] old I'll be how old would I be in the
[1:04:49] year 2000 it seemed like no that's
[1:04:51] ridiculous we'll never see the year 2000
[1:04:54] yeah
[1:04:55] and this was you know just a boy we
[1:04:58] moved there in the early 1970s
[1:05:00] and
[1:05:01] and I I can see all the way back to
[1:05:04] where I began this journey
[1:05:06] and I'm I I'm close enough now to the
[1:05:09] promised years that I can I can
[1:05:11] look forward and see the end coming
[1:05:13] and I know I'm well over halfway there
[1:05:15] well over
[1:05:17] fact is I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm soon to you
[1:05:20] know I'm actually already in moving into
[1:05:23] uh I'm already in the third quarter
[1:05:26] and you know we're we're talking about
[1:05:29] promised years of 70 and then 80 maybe
[1:05:32] you make it to 80 and I'm already uh
[1:05:34] soon to be 60 and and I can see from
[1:05:37] where I start I can see my whole life
[1:05:39] brother Branham
[1:05:41] where's this Rapture going to come from
[1:05:44] I can see all the way back to my
[1:05:46] childhood and I've waited for that day
[1:05:48] since I was a boy and I'm looking toward
[1:05:51] the end time and I I can see but but I
[1:05:54] but but but but yet at the same time
[1:05:57] but at the same time I believe that I am
[1:06:00] the generation that will see the coming
[1:06:03] of the Lord
[1:06:06] and I can see where I started I can see
[1:06:08] that my end is coming close but I still
[1:06:10] believe that the Rapture is coming in my
[1:06:14] lifetime
[1:06:17] I see how improbable
[1:06:20] it is for me
[1:06:24] and I think that if we would be honest
[1:06:26] tonight
[1:06:28] it's not just about staying alive long
[1:06:30] enough
[1:06:32] there are going to be people who stay
[1:06:33] alive long enough who miss it
[1:06:37] by the billions
[1:06:39] who will be alive and remain and they'll
[1:06:42] remain
[1:06:45] but there will be a people alive and
[1:06:46] remain who will be gone
[1:06:48] because why like Enoch the Lord took
[1:06:50] them
[1:06:54] so it's not about living long enough to
[1:06:56] see it but really it's about being the
[1:06:59] kind of Overcomer being the right kind
[1:07:01] of hearer being the right kind of
[1:07:03] receiver being the right kind of acting
[1:07:06] I want to hear and I want to believe and
[1:07:08] I have heard and I do believe and now
[1:07:10] I'm acting on the word of God but is it
[1:07:12] enough am I going to make it I believe I
[1:07:15] will but at the same time that man in
[1:07:17] the mirror gives me gives me pause to
[1:07:20] say are you sure are you sincere enough
[1:07:22] are you righteous enough are you praying
[1:07:24] enough are you holy enough are you
[1:07:27] enough for God
[1:07:29] I can't be the only one who the devil
[1:07:31] tries to bother our minds with yes I
[1:07:34] know I've passed from Death of Life yes
[1:07:36] I know there's an amen or down inside of
[1:07:38] me
[1:07:39] but I'm also still a human
[1:07:41] who when I was reading I was hearing
[1:07:43] brother Branham say this and he said
[1:07:44] brother Branham that bear is going to be
[1:07:46] there but I can see everywhere It seems
[1:07:48] impossible
[1:07:49] and I just thought Lord how many times
[1:07:51] I've said on my knees repenting thinking
[1:07:53] it's impossible
[1:07:55] I can I can see my whole life I can see
[1:07:57] all my errors I can see all my mistakes
[1:07:59] I can see my weaknesses going forward
[1:08:01] I've still got these these inhibitions
[1:08:03] I'm still trying to overcome this I'm
[1:08:04] still trying to overcome that
[1:08:06] amen
[1:08:10] sometimes it can look very improbable
[1:08:13] if I had brother Branham here
[1:08:16] you know
[1:08:19] and I'd say
[1:08:20] between six and nine
[1:08:22] oh if I had Paul here
[1:08:24] if I had Paul here Paul in a moment yes
[1:08:30] in a twinkling of an eye yep
[1:08:33] really yep
[1:08:34] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:08:38] but I I can see 50 miles by the bread
[1:08:41] and I can see all around me where's it
[1:08:43] going to come from I see all my
[1:08:45] weaknesses I I see all my failures and
[1:08:47] you're telling me that somewhere between
[1:08:49] now and a wedding supper that my loved
[1:08:53] ones are gonna appear in my living room
[1:08:55] and I'm gonna be changed in a moment
[1:09:01] how's it going to happen brother Branham
[1:09:03] how's it going to be hell it's
[1:09:04] impossible Paul and brother Brandon
[1:09:07] would say he's still Jehovah-jireh the
[1:09:10] Lord can provide himself I'm here to
[1:09:12] tell you he's more than able oh
[1:09:15] Hallelujah
[1:09:19] if he has spoken about a resurrection I
[1:09:23] know this I've heard it and I know this
[1:09:25] I receive it and I know this I'm acting
[1:09:28] is that reacting very good I'm doing all

[1:10:02] my children my grandchildren I've led
[1:10:06] the most precious thing in the world to
[1:10:08] me to this life
[1:10:12] and I want to say

[1:10:33] throw it at the feet of my Lord
[1:10:34] hallelujah
[1:10:37] how do I know the Rapture is real
[1:10:39] because I've heard the same voice of the
[1:10:42] Resurrection it raised Lazarus
[1:10:46] it raised Jesus it raised all the Old
[1:10:49] Testament Saints
[1:10:51] because they were sincere I have the
[1:10:53] same sincerity
[1:10:56] I have the same voice

[1:11:00] change me forever thank God thank God
[1:11:02] thank God Don't You Worry friends it'll
[1:11:04] change you forever and everything the
[1:11:07] devil has battled you over he'll not
[1:11:09] brother put him just like Moses he said
[1:11:12] these Egyptians whom you've seen today
[1:11:14] you will see them no more forever
[1:11:22] and he said
[1:11:24] this is okay
[1:11:25] I just want to finish this testimony
[1:11:28] this is my time for Testimony
[1:11:31] he says in us trying to pack this heavy
[1:11:33] Caribou down
[1:11:35] the trophy down the mountain I packed
[1:11:36] the rifle part of the timing
[1:11:39] he would pack the rifle and vice versa
[1:11:42] we got almost to a big glacier
[1:11:47] we got under there it was kind of hot
[1:11:50] we got in the glacier of ice and sit
[1:11:52] down there a while and cool off
[1:11:54] he said you know brother Branham
[1:11:57] we're not over a mile
[1:12:01] now before he was 50 mile radius
[1:12:04] that's 25 miles in every direction
[1:12:07] he says now we're not more than about a
[1:12:09] mile
[1:12:10] from where Eddie and Blaine them two
[1:12:12] boys be standing
[1:12:14] that old bear better be showing up
[1:12:18] I said bud I believe you're doubting it
[1:12:24] we have to own that
[1:12:26] because we get the same way
[1:12:28] come on
[1:12:29] own that we get the same way
[1:12:32] but it's not Bud's a real Christian
[1:12:35] Bud really is a believer
[1:12:36] but the circumstances look so impossible
[1:12:40] this time
[1:12:41] I mean it's yeah it's looked impossible
[1:12:43] before but brother Branham
[1:12:46] less than a month
[1:12:49] I told you before we left he wasn't up
[1:12:51] here when we when I could see 50 mile
[1:12:53] radius he wasn't anywhere and now we're
[1:12:56] a mile away
[1:13:02] he said brother I said but I believe
[1:13:04] you're doubting it
[1:13:06] he said brother Branham
[1:13:08] my brother had epileptic fits for years
[1:13:12] and you told me once the first time up
[1:13:15] here when we went down to another place
[1:13:17] told me what that boy looked like and
[1:13:20] Eddie was writing right by my side there
[1:13:22] on a horse when the lord gave the vision
[1:13:24] I and and brother biscal tells that in
[1:13:26] his testimony he was writing side by
[1:13:28] side with brother Branham his horse next
[1:13:30] to his horse and they were riding along
[1:13:31] and brother Branham says to brother
[1:13:33] Eddie I've Just Seen A Vision tell
[1:13:35] brother Bud here's what's here's what to
[1:13:37] do about his but he's got a brother in
[1:13:39] describe and he described him and said
[1:13:40] here's what you do he said you you tell
[1:13:43] his wife get a message to his wife and
[1:13:45] say that the next time he has one of
[1:13:47] those fits you rip that shirt off of him
[1:13:49] and you throw it into the wood stove and
[1:13:52] say this I do in the name of Jesus
[1:13:54] Christ and he'll never have another one
[1:13:55] now you explain that I don't know enough
[1:13:57] about quantum mechanics to tell you how
[1:13:59] that worked
[1:14:00] but I'm here to tell you that little
[1:14:02] bitty woman and she was a small woman
[1:14:04] and her husband was a big guy Bud's
[1:14:06] brother and Bud was a big old big old
[1:14:08] albertan cowboy and he and here he's
[1:14:11] going and he and he's and he and he says
[1:14:13] you tell her and she here he goes into
[1:14:16] one of those fits and brother Ed tells
[1:14:17] the story and that little half a nothing
[1:14:20] woman jumped on that great big guy
[1:14:23] ripped and clawed until she got that
[1:14:25] shirt on a man having an epileptic
[1:14:26] seizure
[1:14:28] and she got that shirt stripped off of
[1:14:30] him and opened the fire and threw it in
[1:14:32] there and said this I do in the name of
[1:14:34] Jesus Christ and he said he's never had
[1:14:37] another fit in his life
[1:14:43] he said and now he said I can't doubt it
[1:14:48] I said bud
[1:14:50] I don't know
[1:14:52] where the bear is coming from
[1:14:54] but he said I've never

[1:18:07] the last pain I ever feel
[1:18:12] he said it's a silver trip that Silver
[1:18:13] Tip that's him
[1:18:15] when we got the grizzly he says and
[1:18:17] remember in the vision I told you I was
[1:18:20] scared about that rifle it was a little
[1:18:22] bitty 270 small bullets you see it's on
[1:18:25] tape and I got to bear just about 500
[1:18:27] yards like it's and Bud said you better
[1:18:30] shoot that bear in the back
[1:18:32] and and he said did you ever shoot a
[1:18:34] grizzly bear I said nope
[1:18:37] he said oh they don't know what death is
[1:18:39] I he said I learned that a little a
[1:18:41] little later he says they don't break up
[1:18:44] from shocks said you better shoot him I
[1:18:46] said I can't shoot him in the back buddy
[1:18:48] brother Brandon Bud wanting to hit him
[1:18:49] in the spine and break his back because
[1:18:51] he wouldn't die for sure a little 270.
[1:18:53] no Hunter insane enough to would shoot a
[1:18:56] silver tip without with nowhere to run
[1:18:58] and hide with a 270.
[1:19:02] and he said I mean when I was hog
[1:19:04] hunting I went me and Matt walked down
[1:19:06] the road one time we had our I had a
[1:19:08] crossbow he had a bow and Hogzilla went
[1:19:10] across the road in front of us
[1:19:12] and we just Matt and Matt I was afraid
[1:19:15] to move Amanda said dad to start backing
[1:19:16] up and stop backing
[1:19:19] and we started backing up because it
[1:19:21] sounded like they were coming in around
[1:19:22] us these things were like trained
[1:19:24] Warriors and I said I'll never come in
[1:19:26] here again and next time I come I had my
[1:19:29] 300 Magnum on this arm my 44 Magnum in
[1:19:32] in this holster I was gonna kill
[1:19:35] something and here he is with a 270
[1:19:37] gonna shoot a big giant Silver Tip
[1:19:40] and he said here we go
[1:19:43] and I and he said according to the
[1:19:44] vision but according to the vision I
[1:19:46] shot in the heart he said well
[1:19:49] if that Vision said so I'm going to
[1:19:51] stand by you
[1:19:52] and he meant that literally
[1:19:55] and he said here we go and I said here
[1:19:57] we go and we got a little closer and
[1:20:00] when I raised up the bear saw me that
[1:20:02] was what he wanted to make a charge and
[1:20:04] I shot the bear it didn't even seem like
[1:20:06] it even hurt him
[1:20:08] here he come and before I could get
[1:20:10] another bullet in the gun the Bear died
[1:20:12] about 50 yards from me but was white
[1:20:15] around the mouth and said brother branna
[1:20:18] I didn't want him on my lap
[1:20:23] brother Brown said I didn't either
[1:20:32] I never wanted the world to get this
[1:20:33] close
[1:20:37] I've been firing shots and I never
[1:20:39] imagined it would get this close
[1:20:41] I never imagined they would Crown a man
[1:20:43] as a beauty queen woman
[1:20:46] I never imagined the world would accept
[1:20:48] that in wholesale and now it's so
[1:20:51] Politically Incorrect to even suggest
[1:20:53] differently
[1:20:54] I never wanted that for my children I
[1:20:56] never wanted I never wanted the world to
[1:20:58] get that close I didn't want it in my
[1:21:00] lap but that's where it's at
[1:21:02] I didn't want it for my kids I didn't
[1:21:04] want it for my grandkids I was certainly
[1:21:06] sure my kids would never grow up and I
[1:21:08] was doubly sure my grandkids and here
[1:21:10] they are growing up into full adults and
[1:21:13] I find myself all the time on this road
[1:21:15] of Life put like trying to push the
[1:21:17] brake pedal through the floor
[1:21:19] you ever done my teaching a teenager how
[1:21:22] to drive you know almost you know
[1:21:24] there's no break there but you're
[1:21:25] pushing it all the way through the floor
[1:21:26] and when I see the world and I see what
[1:21:29] my children what my grandchildren are
[1:21:31] facing I find myself trying to push the
[1:21:33] break through the floor yeah I never
[1:21:34] imagined it would be this close I didn't
[1:21:36] want it in my lap but I still got a
[1:21:39] promise and I still got a weapon and I
[1:21:42] still got a vision
[1:21:45] hallelujah oh my it feels like he's in
[1:21:48] our lap at this point and brother
[1:21:50] Branham and brother Branham said but he
[1:21:53] said I'm glad that Vision said you got
[1:21:56] him
[1:21:59] when I see the sin that my family has to
[1:22:02] go through I'm glad Paul saw that we
[1:22:04] made it
[1:22:05] I'm glad a prophet said I see you all
[1:22:07] over there Hallelujah I'm glad for some
[1:22:10] glorious morning I didn't want it in my
[1:22:12] lap but here it is
[1:22:14] but I'm still firing and I got a promise
[1:22:18] it'll go right to the heart of the enemy
[1:22:21] oh my let me finish here last bit
[1:22:25] and I said no he said now if them horns
[1:22:28] are 42 inches I'm gonna have a runaway
[1:22:31] I'll say it the way he did I'm going to
[1:22:32] have a screaming fit
[1:22:35] those are fun
[1:22:37] I said well you just Minds right have it
[1:22:40] right now because that's what it's going
[1:22:42] to be
[1:22:43] when we got down there to brother Eddie
[1:22:45] and he said to brother Eddie we tied the
[1:22:47] horses off and they're scared of a bear
[1:22:49] see and oh my
[1:22:51] they had the smell of it and we couldn't
[1:22:53] skin him out it was too late and they
[1:22:55] they had to come back the next day and
[1:22:57] then we we broke up the string about 10
[1:23:00] times horses running everywhere and so
[1:23:02] when we got down there he said went and
[1:23:04] got the tape measured out of his out of
[1:23:07] measure out of a saddlebag and said
[1:23:08] Blaine and I said to brother Eddie I
[1:23:10] said now watch that little hand there
[1:23:12] see according accordingly I thought it
[1:23:15] might have been Billy Paul little bitty
[1:23:17] hand holding the tape measure wasn't
[1:23:19] brother bradham's son it was butt son
[1:23:21] Blaine but 18 at the time brother bisco
[1:23:24] tells us in detail he's standing there
[1:23:26] with his checkered shirt on he didn't
[1:23:28] have it on when they left
[1:23:31] he's got it on when they come back and
[1:23:33] he said I was standing there and they
[1:23:34] were going to measure and he said
[1:23:35] brother Brandon punched me and said I
[1:23:37] thought you didn't have a checkered
[1:23:38] shirt he said Brother Brad I'm the most
[1:23:40] amazing thing he said I I told my wife
[1:23:42] to throw it away she must have mended it
[1:23:44] and stuck it in my bag he said I'm sorry
[1:23:46] I didn't know and and brother Brandon
[1:23:49] had I mean brother Ed had felt fallen in
[1:23:51] water and that's why he had to change
[1:23:52] the shirt
[1:23:54] see I mean you're gonna if an angel
[1:23:56] trips you and pushes you you're gonna
[1:23:58] fall in water
[1:24:01] I'm sorry it's probably not even your
[1:24:03] fault
[1:24:06] and so brother brother biscal when he
[1:24:09] tells that story he says and I was
[1:24:11] watching
[1:24:13] he he says brother random says here he
[1:24:15] says now watch that little hand I
[1:24:17] punched brother Eddie we step back he
[1:24:19] put it right up like that exact exactly
[1:24:21] on the nose 42 inches see just exactly
[1:24:23] Jesus never fails the word will never
[1:24:26] fail as long as it comes from God and
[1:24:29] brother Ed tells that story he said I
[1:24:32] was standing there and he popped me and
[1:24:34] said I thought you didn't have this
[1:24:35] shirt and I well I didn't I thought it
[1:24:36] was gone my wife put it in there and he
[1:24:38] said and we're standing there and he
[1:24:40] said as Blaine got down and he said now
[1:24:42] what happened was you they were trying
[1:24:45] to put the tape up here at the tip and
[1:24:47] they would bring the bring it down
[1:24:49] across the head and go up the other side
[1:24:51] and before they could get up there this
[1:24:53] side would pop off and Bud was trying to
[1:24:55] measure and every time he would start
[1:24:56] again and get up there and this one
[1:24:58] would pop off and he said Blaine hold
[1:25:01] that tape down right there and Blaine
[1:25:03] drops down because he's walking in a
[1:25:04] vision and doesn't know it yeah
[1:25:07] that's you

[1:38:53] and uh
[1:38:54] I just have back issues I fell out of a
[1:38:56] tree when I was pretty young and I think
[1:38:57] it's just been like the Catalyst behind
[1:38:59] it but basically it'll go out and it'll
[1:39:01] be really bad well this time it started
[1:39:03] like a month ago and I just like wake up
[1:39:05] every morning at the same time about 5
[1:39:07] a.m and I would just have the worst pain
[1:39:09] ever and be right in the center of my
[1:39:11] back and anyways I would take stuff and
[1:39:13] stretch and do whatever could hot shower
[1:39:15] and finally about one o'clock every day
[1:39:17] it would feel better but then it would
[1:39:19] repeat and this went on for four almost
[1:39:21] five weeks came up last uh Sunday
[1:39:24] Wednesday
[1:39:25] God prayed for got hands laid on me
[1:39:28] prayed and within a day maybe a day and
[1:39:31] a half gone completely problem solved so
[1:39:33] I just want to be thankful for yeah
[1:39:41] I saw two hands behind me okay oh Andrew
[1:39:44] go ahead you got a mic there yeah
[1:39:48] I just wanted to give this real quick
[1:39:51] testimony we this not this past Thursday
[1:39:53] but the Thursday before
[1:39:55] um I had just gotten to work and I got a
[1:39:57] text from my wife that said uh Landon's
[1:39:59] dog Sherlock he's a three-year-old
[1:40:01] golden retriever had been hit by a car
[1:40:04] in the road
[1:40:05] uh kind of out in front of our house
[1:40:07] down a little ways he had he doesn't go
[1:40:09] out in front because we had an electric
[1:40:10] fence there but he had gone through the
[1:40:12] neighbors a little ways down and had
[1:40:14] gotten out and uh got hit by a car and a
[1:40:17] young man had come by and saw him just
[1:40:19] turning circles and falling over on the
[1:40:21] side of the road I started knocking on
[1:40:23] doors trying to find us and eventually
[1:40:25] they they found that they found us and
[1:40:26] it was our dog so we took him to the
[1:40:29] emergency vet and um they charged us a
[1:40:33] whole lot of money to tell us that uh he
[1:40:35] had a head injury
[1:40:37] and uh that he had swelling on his brain
[1:40:40] and he was completely blind and they
[1:40:43] weren't sure if he could hear
[1:40:45] and they wanted to keep him overnight
[1:40:46] for another five thousand dollars
[1:40:48] and give him some meds and some fluids
[1:40:51] and um I said well I asked him well what
[1:40:54] do you think what about just euthanizing
[1:40:55] him because you know we don't want him
[1:40:58] to suffer like that if he's going to be
[1:41:00] blind he can't hear
[1:41:01] and they said well it's premature I
[1:41:04] think for that the vet said because
[1:41:06] there's a chance once the swelling goes
[1:41:08] down on his brain you know he may get
[1:41:10] some function back but we just don't
[1:41:11] think he'll be you know we're not too
[1:41:14] hopeful but we we think it's too early
[1:41:15] to just euthanize him so I said well
[1:41:17] okay well can you give him the meds let
[1:41:19] us take him home they said yeah we can
[1:41:21] do that but you know he might not do
[1:41:23] well we said okay well at the at the
[1:41:25] time that it happened when they found
[1:41:27] out Emily I guess she texts this to
[1:41:29] Rachel
[1:41:30] Rachel Watkins yeah and next thing you
[1:41:33] know we were getting texts from
[1:41:34] everybody saying they were praying and
[1:41:37] so
[1:41:38] um I don't know they activated some kind
[1:41:39] of phone tree or something but everybody
[1:41:42] just was texting and saying they were
[1:41:43] praying and uh and we were praying and
[1:41:45] so we brought him home and kept him out
[1:41:48] his head elevated and took him to his
[1:41:50] vet the next morning and the next
[1:41:51] morning his his pressure was really high
[1:41:53] and they wanted us to take him back to
[1:41:56] the emergency vet hospital having them
[1:41:58] keep him and we said you know we were
[1:42:00] like well we can't really afford that
[1:42:02] we're not going to do that we're just
[1:42:03] going to keep praying and believing and
[1:42:04] see what the Lord can do and so they
[1:42:08] kept him at the vet and gave him fluids
[1:42:09] all day and then later that afternoon he
[1:42:12] started improving his pressure came down
[1:42:14] and we took him home and he basically
[1:42:17] was he was at meaning that he couldn't
[1:42:20] stand up straight he couldn't walk he
[1:42:22] would just go sideways and fall over
[1:42:24] um for about two days and uh we just
[1:42:27] kept there and praying and he couldn't
[1:42:30] get up and down down the steps or having
[1:42:31] to carry them up and down and
[1:42:33] but anyway uh he slowly slowly improved
[1:42:37] and uh in about
[1:42:40] by four or five days later
[1:42:43] um he was starting to get get around and
[1:42:46] he's just kind of walking in circles and
[1:42:48] then
[1:42:49] um
[1:42:50] maybe uh was it maybe Friday or Saturday
[1:42:53] I know it must have been Sunday for the
[1:42:56] first time
[1:42:57] he went after a tennis ball Landon
[1:42:59] rolled a tennis ball and he went after
[1:43:01] it and he picked it up off the floor so
[1:43:03] we were like well he can see something
[1:43:05] because he picked up the tennis ball and
[1:43:08] brought it back so um but after that he
[1:43:11] slowly improved and uh to the point now
[1:43:14] he's got a little problem with his back
[1:43:15] foot where he's still limping a little
[1:43:17] bit but now he's just running around you
[1:43:20] would almost did not even know that he'd
[1:43:22] ever had any problem at all he's he's
[1:43:24] playing ball again and running around in
[1:43:25] the yard I just wanted to say we just
[1:43:27] appreciated it so much that God is
[1:43:29] mindful of even the little things that
[1:43:31] are important to us so praise the Lord
[1:43:37] was that the testimony you were going to
[1:43:39] give yeah
[1:43:40] yeah Chris
[1:43:41] this was so good Chris gave me this the
[1:43:43] other morning sister Debbie and I and uh
[1:43:46] um I want you to tell it all but try not
[1:43:48] to go too long amen I'm
[1:43:53] it's a lot but um
[1:43:56] and I was almost afraid of what all to
[1:43:58] share because this is the first time a
[1:44:00] testimony
[1:44:01] has a not Justice for myself I guess
[1:44:03] other people were involved but I I guess
[1:44:06] I realized and he keeps saying it's good
[1:44:08] you know I feel like God's in the
[1:44:09] details so you know those are the parts
[1:44:12] you mentioned that helped give God glory
[1:44:14] you know and
[1:44:15] so um
[1:44:17] yeah I'll try to be fast so basically in
[1:44:19] case you all didn't know I was in a bad
[1:44:20] situation I was living in a motel room
[1:44:22] for three months
[1:44:24] and um in this time I became laid off of
[1:44:27] work
[1:44:28] and uh
[1:44:30] so I'm living in a motel and
[1:44:34] um laid off of work so I'm trying to
[1:44:36] find a job
[1:44:37] and it's weird you know it's like
[1:44:39] it's been really like a growing process
[1:44:41] I guess and you know and um I've lost
[1:44:43] like everything
[1:44:45] and uh
[1:44:46] through this time and I started coming
[1:44:48] back to church and stuff it's like I've
[1:44:51] matured a lot and I just for some reason
[1:44:54] it seems like you know I just got laid
[1:44:56] off of work I'm living in a motel but
[1:44:58] how am I going to afford every day to
[1:45:00] pay for this motel and it's just like
[1:45:02] every day I'm trying to like hustle to
[1:45:04] figure out how to have a roof over my
[1:45:06] head
[1:45:07] so um
[1:45:09] long story short even though it's a long
[1:45:11] story
[1:45:12] um so um
[1:45:15] oh and I was going to say we're not in
[1:45:17] this maturing process for some reason
[1:45:18] you know I'm about to be on the street
[1:45:21] I'm running out of money but for some
[1:45:23] reason I have like this piece or
[1:45:25] something it's like um
[1:45:27] I should have way more urgency and stuff
[1:45:29] but I'm not like freaking out or
[1:45:31] anything I'm just calm and
[1:45:33] I don't know I guess I just feel like
[1:45:34] whatever
[1:45:36] I'll just it's gonna happen I guess I
[1:45:38] don't know it's weird how to explain it
[1:45:40] but anyway
[1:45:41] it was like I think it was on a Tuesday
[1:45:44] and I only had thirty dollars left for
[1:45:46] my motel room
[1:45:48] and I couldn't think I was short thirty
[1:45:51] dollars I could have think I couldn't
[1:45:52] get a hold of anybody
[1:45:54] that I have friends with in Beaufort
[1:45:56] that if I needed to reach out sometimes
[1:45:58] for some help that they would help me
[1:46:00] out I couldn't get a hold of any of them
[1:46:02] so I called a brother in the church
[1:46:05] um I called George Buckman brother
[1:46:07] George and he was out of town but he
[1:46:09] just asked me why I called and I just
[1:46:11] mentioned you know I was just trying to
[1:46:12] get thirty dollars I could pay you back
[1:46:14] tonight well obviously he was out of
[1:46:15] town but he just suggested you know call
[1:46:18] Matt or one of the other brothers
[1:46:19] brother Matt Watkins and anyway
[1:46:23] um I haven't really spoke to Matt too
[1:46:24] much since I first started coming back
[1:46:26] to church so I haven't really talked to
[1:46:28] him much so anyway I'm like I'm trying
[1:46:31] to hurry all right so I call Brother
[1:46:33] Matt
[1:46:35] and I asked him if I could borrow 30 and
[1:46:37] he's like yeah you can borrow three
[1:46:38] dollars and then he's just like what are
[1:46:40] you doing right now and I was like I'm
[1:46:41] not working he's like you're not working
[1:46:44] and I was like no I got laid off and
[1:46:45] he's like well if you want you come work
[1:46:47] for me like today
[1:46:48] so um
[1:46:50] is that's what happened he picked me up
[1:46:52] he gave me the thirty dollars so I'd
[1:46:53] have a room for the night and I worked
[1:46:55] with him and then the next day
[1:46:57] I was in the same situation I needed
[1:46:59] money for the room
[1:47:01] um I was going to work with Matt and I
[1:47:03] said Matt is there any way you could
[1:47:04] help me with the room and he said yes
[1:47:05] and then I believe if I'm correct that
[1:47:09] was also I came to church and I put in a
[1:47:11] prayer request you know just asking for
[1:47:13] help you know for my situation
[1:47:15] everything because um
[1:47:17] you know I don't know what to do
[1:47:19] honestly and so um
[1:47:22] that evening
[1:47:24] um I guess after church
[1:47:26] I look in my bank account because I have
[1:47:28] like an app online you can look I had
[1:47:31] like 25 dollars in my bank account or
[1:47:33] something and then so later on I look
[1:47:37] and then I have like
[1:47:39] I think it was like 98 or 108 dollars I
[1:47:43] don't know but for some reason I had
[1:47:44] more money in my bank account than I had
[1:47:45] before and then so I'm like kind of
[1:47:48] puzzled but I'm like already thinking
[1:47:50] well that's wonderful because tomorrow
[1:47:52] I'm gonna have to pay for this room
[1:47:53] again and now I have the money magically
[1:47:55] or something you know
[1:47:56] so um
[1:47:59] so um anyway it was either I think it
[1:48:03] was later on in the evening before I
[1:48:04] went to bed again I checked my bank
[1:48:06] again and then I had 300 and something
[1:48:07] dollars
[1:48:11] and so uh
[1:48:12] I was like
[1:48:14] my money's coming back to me or
[1:48:15] something I didn't know you know I just
[1:48:18] it was just to me it was like amazing
[1:48:20] and so I went to bed and the next
[1:48:23] morning
[1:48:25] you know the housekeeper knocks on my
[1:48:26] door like every morning like clockwork
[1:48:28] at 9 30. knocked out my door and said
[1:48:30] they need you to go to the front because
[1:48:32] you gotta check out and I was like no
[1:48:33] I'ma stay over and they were like well
[1:48:34] you need to talk to her because they
[1:48:37] said you need to go up there so I go up
[1:48:38] there
[1:48:40] yeah they're kicking me out of the motel
[1:48:41] because uh that most I was saying to the
[1:48:45] super eight and it's like right now
[1:48:46] they're renovating most of their rooms
[1:48:48] like Remodeling and Military graduation
[1:48:51] if I can't beat them to the room I can't
[1:48:53] book it they put me out
[1:48:55] so um
[1:48:57] I'm already making a plan you know they
[1:48:58] said I can't stay in the room I was like
[1:49:00] well I can take money from here and out
[1:49:02] of the bank and take it with my deposit
[1:49:03] I'll get back and go get a room at
[1:49:05] another hotel
[1:49:07] and uh brother Jason gives you a phone
[1:49:10] call and he's like what are you doing
[1:49:12] right now and I'm like I'm actually
[1:49:13] getting ready to check out a motel
[1:49:15] because they said I can't stay here and
[1:49:16] I told him the same little story and
[1:49:19] he's like well why don't you let me pick
[1:49:20] you up and um I want to like spend some
[1:49:23] time with you and show you some things
[1:49:24] or something and like I have a surprise
[1:49:26] or something like that he said so I was
[1:49:29] like okay so um I'm going with him and
[1:49:31] we're like just hanging out running
[1:49:33] errands you know and um
[1:49:36] you know I really did enjoy it even
[1:49:39] though it was like briefly but it's like
[1:49:41] I got to see more of a
[1:49:43] like a funner or like a human side of
[1:49:45] you like
[1:49:50] that or anything but
[1:49:53] but it was like you're just like cutting
[1:49:55] up I didn't mean no disrespect you know
[1:49:57] but
[1:50:01] another you weren't behind the pulpit so
[1:50:04] okay so um
[1:50:07] we go and I need to try to hurry this up
[1:50:09] so okay so we're running his errands
[1:50:14] um we go to Graco and um he's got this
[1:50:16] propane tank and we go pick up like a
[1:50:18] garden hose we get the propane tank
[1:50:20] refilled and
[1:50:22] um
[1:50:23] he needs to make some keys copies for
[1:50:26] some keys and stuff and it was like
[1:50:27] interesting because um
[1:50:29] we I think we went out in and out of the
[1:50:32] store a few times I don't know but I had
[1:50:34] to go to the truck get the propane tank
[1:50:35] and stuff and um
[1:50:38] he start telling the guy about the keys
[1:50:40] he's like I got these keys to a camper
[1:50:42] and like I need you know to get them
[1:50:44] copied and he's going on about a story
[1:50:47] about you know he didn't want
[1:50:48] to replace the locks because a lot of
[1:50:51] people might have keys to those newer
[1:50:52] locks or I don't know but anyway I was
[1:50:55] even thinking in my mind it's like it'd
[1:50:56] be cool if he just like let me hold
[1:50:58] those keys
[1:50:59] say a camper that that went in my mind
[1:51:01] but anyway he gets the keys and stuff
[1:51:04] and we get everything back into the
[1:51:06] pickup truck and then we go to Walmart
[1:51:09] he's got Aaron he's got to run for
[1:51:10] sister Debbie you have to return
[1:51:12] something so
[1:51:14] um
[1:51:16] on her way to Walmart we're having
[1:51:18] another conversation and he's talking to
[1:51:21] me about um trying to help you know he's
[1:51:24] must try to help get my or my life back
[1:51:26] on track and uh
[1:51:28] I've had some problems with my driver's
[1:51:30] license and stuff and it's
[1:51:32] um suspended but he's gonna he said he
[1:51:35] would like to help me he was what really
[1:51:37] was really struck me about this it's
[1:51:40] like the whole time I've known you I've
[1:51:41] known you for a long time
[1:51:43] that you said it to me like this you're
[1:51:46] like I love sister Jackie I love you
[1:51:48] know Mike and I was like y'all are like
[1:51:50] family that you know my family married
[1:51:53] into your family but that was the first
[1:51:55] time I think ever that I've ever heard
[1:51:57] you kind of consider me as family and
[1:51:59] not just like a brother in Christ you
[1:52:02] know so that really meant a lot to me
[1:52:04] you know and uh
[1:52:06] so um you said you know I told him what
[1:52:08] I need to do get to my license situated
[1:52:10] and he said he would help me with that
[1:52:11] and I thanked him and he said it'd be
[1:52:13] his pleasure you know it just made me
[1:52:15] feel good that because that's another
[1:52:17] thing through this whole time it's like
[1:52:18] I've had no family my parents both
[1:52:20] passed away two years ago and there's
[1:52:23] nobody here and all my friends basically
[1:52:25] except for now these friends they all
[1:52:28] turn their back on me so uh it just
[1:52:31] meant a lot you know so
[1:52:33] I'm trying to hurry so then
[1:52:36] we we leave Walmart and then he wants to
[1:52:38] make sure these Keys work so we go out
[1:52:41] to this RV campground or where there's a
[1:52:43] camper at and uh
[1:52:46] you know he's making sure the keys work
[1:52:48] and he said they're great they do work
[1:52:50] he asked me to put the propane tank in
[1:52:52] the front of the camper and stuff and he
[1:52:53] hooks up the garden hose and
[1:52:55] he goes on a little bit and he says I
[1:52:57] just want you to know that I've been
[1:52:59] trying to figure out how to help you you
[1:53:01] know and it's just so happened I I have
[1:53:03] this trailer or this camper and he's
[1:53:05] like um I can afford to let you stay
[1:53:07] here for one month rent free
[1:53:09] so you can get back on your feet you
[1:53:12] know and I just really greatly
[1:53:14] appreciated that you know because you
[1:53:16] know we both had conversations and I've
[1:53:17] had conversations with other people
[1:53:19] it's very expensive to live in a motel
[1:53:21] so um but that was my only option and uh
[1:53:26] so
[1:53:27] he does this for me so like and that was
[1:53:30] amazing to me it's like so I don't I
[1:53:33] think I told Brother Jason but I don't
[1:53:34] know if he knew from the conversation
[1:53:36] but the day I got kicked out of the
[1:53:37] motel was the same day that now I got
[1:53:40] this camper I can stand
[1:53:43] and
[1:53:44] and then after that you know and I thank
[1:53:46] brother Jason for that and everything
[1:53:48] and I appreciate it so much and then
[1:53:51] he said you know he had some work around
[1:53:53] his house I could do and so I was like
[1:53:56] it just keeps going and ongoing and
[1:53:58] going so then he said I could work for
[1:54:01] him his backyard doing some work around
[1:54:03] the house like clearing the land or I
[1:54:06] don't know I don't want to go in a big
[1:54:07] Spiel but anyway so he gives me labor to
[1:54:10] do and he pays me you know he paid me
[1:54:13] cash money to do it and he's told me
[1:54:16] he's got because we left my moped at the
[1:54:18] motel and he would take me back after I
[1:54:20] worked and he said um you know take some
[1:54:23] of that money and get you some stuff you
[1:54:25] need from the store before you come to
[1:54:26] the camper I was like all right
[1:54:30] so um I go to oh I stop at Food Lion at
[1:54:34] ladies Island and I'm going around
[1:54:37] looking for the stuff I need like some
[1:54:39] paper cups or styrofoam cups and some
[1:54:41] dish soap and I don't know just some
[1:54:43] random things that I needed and
[1:54:45] um I was always
[1:54:47] being Frugal about everything that
[1:54:48] through this whole
[1:54:49] time I'm like trying to be very frugal
[1:54:52] so um I don't know if people notice it
[1:54:54] on Frugal but
[1:54:56] um I go in the checkout line and I
[1:54:59] probably only had like ten dollars of
[1:55:00] stuff and this lady behind me she's like
[1:55:03] um
[1:55:04] tells the the clerk or whatever you call
[1:55:07] the person running the cash register
[1:55:08] just bag up his stuff and Tack it onto
[1:55:12] mine and um
[1:55:14] you know and I'll take care of it and I
[1:55:16] looked at the lady I'm like really and
[1:55:18] she's like yeah really sometimes I just
[1:55:19] do that for people I just you know
[1:55:21] whatever they're getting I just add it
[1:55:22] to my bill and I pay for it
[1:55:24] so uh
[1:55:27] so I looked at her and I was just like
[1:55:29] you know I thanked River and I was like
[1:55:31] thank you so much and I was like you're
[1:55:33] such a blessing you know and I just said
[1:55:35] God bless you and
[1:55:37] you know and I didn't even realize I
[1:55:40] left an impact so um
[1:55:43] I grab my stuff and go down the road
[1:55:47] I'll stop at the gas station across a
[1:55:49] new point on ladies Island
[1:55:50] asked the sales clerk there for a couple
[1:55:53] styrofoam cups because I didn't want to
[1:55:55] buy this giant pack of Styrofoam cups
[1:55:57] even though it was a good deal but I'm
[1:55:59] like on a moped
[1:56:00] so I can't fit a lot of stuff on a moped
[1:56:03] so anyway they gave me the cups for free
[1:56:07] and I go back along my way and I go to
[1:56:10] the camper
[1:56:11] and um
[1:56:13] I'm pulling into the campground and
[1:56:16] right behind me to pulls this car
[1:56:18] and I noticed it was weird because when
[1:56:19] I was driving to the campground this car
[1:56:21] was in front of me at first and it was
[1:56:23] weird it like pulled over to the
[1:56:25] shoulder or something on Sam's Point and
[1:56:27] a car swerved around it so I decided to
[1:56:29] swerve around it
[1:56:30] and just be keep going about my way and
[1:56:33] so um
[1:56:34] I pull into where the camper is and she
[1:56:37] pulls in right behind me and she gets
[1:56:39] out and she's like are you the guy I
[1:56:41] just saw at the gas or at the Food Lion
[1:56:43] and I was like yes you know that was me
[1:56:46] and she's like well we just so happen to
[1:56:48] be going the same way she's like I'm
[1:56:49] just going a little bit past where
[1:56:50] you're at but she's like but you told me
[1:56:53] I was a blessing to you so I just wanted
[1:56:54] to do this for you so uh
[1:56:57] she gets out of her car and she hands me
[1:56:59] forty dollars
[1:57:01] and uh you know I thanked her again and
[1:57:04] everything and um you know I asked her
[1:57:06] in that conversation I was like what is
[1:57:08] your name and she said her name was Lynn
[1:57:11] and I can't remember
[1:57:13] her last name but she was wearing like a
[1:57:15] sherwin's Williams like shirt she worked
[1:57:17] for a painting company or owned a
[1:57:19] painting company like Connor painting or
[1:57:21] something
[1:57:22] and uh
[1:57:24] after she gave me the money she asked if
[1:57:26] I was working and I was like I'm working
[1:57:27] a little bit but I'm kind of in between
[1:57:29] jobs so she also said that her company
[1:57:32] does a lot of like uh well painting
[1:57:35] obviously but like there's like remodels
[1:57:37] and so forth they could use someone
[1:57:38] because I said I was a plumber and I can
[1:57:40] do handyman work and stuff and so she
[1:57:42] took my phone over and said she would
[1:57:44] give me a call if she had some work for
[1:57:45] it for me to do so the woman you know
[1:57:48] bought my groceries followed me home
[1:57:50] gave me more money and then offered to
[1:57:53] give me a job
[1:57:54] so uh
[1:57:57] but um
[1:57:59] but that whole day it was just like so
[1:58:03] miraculous you know and um
[1:58:05] and I I said at least you know from that
[1:58:08] whole experience and it's like I've gone
[1:58:10] from the very bottom and now I'm
[1:58:13] starting to come back up and and I just
[1:58:15] feel like you know because of all this
[1:58:17] that happened I feel like if nothing
[1:58:19] else or my experience that I could truly
[1:58:21] believe that God really loves me
[1:58:23] and that you know get things worked out
[1:58:26] you know and I don't know but what I
[1:58:29] also want to say because I
[1:58:31] I swear I'll give this I'll give this to
[1:58:34] somebody else but um
[1:58:37] just by
[1:58:38] making myself give that testimony also
[1:58:41] caught myself in a little white lie
[1:58:43] so I want to say this brother because I
[1:58:45] just talked to him last night about a
[1:58:46] potential job offer and I told him I
[1:58:48] could drive a van well technically
[1:58:49] legally I can't so I guess it was a
[1:58:51] white lie but I'm still professing
[1:58:53] positively or confessing but I just
[1:58:56] wanted to say that that you're not be
[1:58:57] like why do you say that after just
