TRANSCRIPT
========================================
oh gracious father Lord we come before you this morning yet again humbly requesting your presence Lord that we would come before you not with a hotti attitude or with an attitude of of personal uh Enlightenment but Lord we would come with an attitude of a thirst of a hunger of a recognition that we are nothing without you lord know a recognition that we would have nothing to say or nothing to hear if it weren't for you you for your anointing father and so we ask you would come down and anoint this Sunday school that it would be your presence speaking through through me father that the people would uh be in the anointing to open their hearts to hear that you what you would have to say that Lord that you would help me to step out of the way and that there would be no uh personal feeling or attitude in in what I would have to say but but Lord that it'd be you speaking through me and that it'd be your attitude and and your feeling and your emotion convey to the people that we would all be able to be uplifted by the revelation of your word and we ask these things in the name of the precious Lord and Savior the Lord Jesus Christ amen um we want to continue the thought that we've been um going through there's no shouldn't have need of a PowerPoint this morning um um uh but I do want to read um uh come up here all right let's go ahead and as a just as a as a scripture we'll read Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 again um continuing to emphasize the point sort of the foundation of this whole topic um Genesis chapter 1 and verse 26 um and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth Earth y'all can be seated um so I I I want to um uh so I want to just as a maybe a recap or or a reiteration of um something we discussed last Sunday um and I and I want to just again um sort of emphasize a point um that I had made concerning um how um um that it would be a a failure of the duty of a minister to not um preach the word in its entirety for the for fear of uh conflict or fear of of maybe hurting feelings or something like that um you know it it just sort of kind of emphasized that I once heard a long time ago um that Napoleon when speaking of War said that if you see your enemy making a mistake do not interrupt them okay um this is and it's kind of obvious and intuitive but likewise when you see your friends making mistakes and and walking into something dangerous or walking into a trap to stand by and and sit idly by and say nothing is a betrayal it is to treat them as an enemy okay and it it behooves all of us and and and hopefully you know we we may move into some of this but it it behooves everybody that when we know the way that God intended Humanity to live we know how God intended people to to um behave and and there was there's a standard that the word expects Christians to live up to to not tell people that for fear of conflict is a betrayal okay it is a it is a you do them wrong you treat them as an enemy um and I would I the the note that I wrote down goes I would rather be seen as maybe um uh harsh or or um or or or uh legalistic perhaps I'd rather be seen as as legalistic than to betray my friends and my loved ones with polite non-confrontational silence okay to to for fear because we know what the word of of God is to to be uh shy about saying it for fear of hurting someone's feelings um it it it is it is wrong and it is complicit okay it is complicit in the Trap that they are walking into so um just I also wanted to kind of refresh or or to to recognize to to reiterate the point about how um men and women are different we have different therefore there are different the the word is the the only standard but it applies to men and women differently because men and women are different okay male and female created he them okay um not you know gender binary or anything like that it is there's male and female and God expects males and females to behave accordingly and they're going to be treated accordingly they're being held to their standard accordingly um and we talked about how with the uh you know we talk about how in in in the scripture in Paul the Apostle Paul taught explicitly that a for a woman to cut her hair is dishonor to her headship and if she dishonors her headship she has no authority to even pray okay that God cannot hear her prayer and likewise if a man acts dishonorably and dishonors himself as headship and does not uphold his uh uh mandate then he was also cut off because because this is the standard of Holiness that they are to be upheld hold themselves to right that that uh men and women are there's a single standard of Holiness but it applies to men and women differently depending on their role and because God is Holiness God has a holy God he has a holy presence to enter into that presence to commune with God to pray requires that you be holy right there you can't be Unholy and expect have an audience with god with any kind of authority so therefore you have to live up to a Holiness standard okay okay to have that Authority with God in his presence and so um uh and we tied this back to um The Book of Exodus when it speaks of the token I want to go ahead and um turn there if we would to Exodus 12 and verse 1 and we're going to read to verse 13 we'll start at verse one it says the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel saying in the 10th day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for a house and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb the lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it out from the Sheep um or from the goats and you shall keep it until the uh 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly believe the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two sides of the post and on the upper doorstep doorpost of the houses wherein they shall eat it and they shall eat the Flesh in that in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it um eat not of it raw nor sodden um at all with water but roast with fire its head with its legs and with the pertinence thereof and he shall not and you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning shall be burnt with fire and thus shall ye eat it with your loins girded and your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will Smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both men and beasts and the and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to be to you for a token upon the houses wherein you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt amen okay so like I said last time there was a process to this okay it was not as simple as well we're going to kill a lamb and and put its Blood on the door and then that's the end of it okay there was you had to bring the lamb into the home right and and I want to I am tying this back to remember back to fathers and husbands being leaders in their home okay this is where we're going with this that husbands and fathers is that in order we talk about so often we talk about you know the me the token message that brother Brandon preached about how when you have things come against your family that you can apply the token and and stand against it right you can hold the death angel at Bay because you've applied the token well what does that mean exactly okay it is not as simple as was saying well I believe Jesus was the Savior and there's blood over my door there more than that okay that you had to bring the lamb into the home it had to be roast with fire which I would like to point out so you have huh you have the body of the lamb in direct contact with or prepared for consumption by the fire of the Holy Spirit okay it's there there was there was a a a a process to that it had to be prepared a certain kind of way you couldn't just pan fry it in some denominational frying pan right you couldn't boil it in some man-made Soup pot right it had to be roast direct fire to flesh contact right that would prepare it in the appropriate way for consumption you had to take the life it because it wasn't just a the blood of a lamb that was the chemicals on the door post isn't wasn't the trick right that that didn't wasn't going to do it for any for anybody what it was was the life that was in that lamb is now been consumed through the Flesh of that lamb into the person in the house right the people have taken the life of that lamb into themselves right it is now Chang to them their body will then manifest the life that was in that lamb okay not only that but you know there was there so there's a but it mentions the unleavened bread right this speaks that they had to clean their home you know it goes into into later detail and I'm I'm just going to for the sake of having 25 minutes not going to get into um but you know there's there's a cleaning of the home that's required you can't have Levan in the home you can't have frivolous sin in the home you can't have things that are uh you know blatant disregard for the standard of Holiness in your home and expect to have a token it doesn't work that way okay and so so many times you have heads of households you have fathers and husbands who will as a father and a husband be leading their household they'll kill lamb and put the do you know put the blood on the on the door they'll uh you know even you know feed on the message of the hour and read their Bible and pray and and pray for Revelation and all these things but they won't be studious about cleaning the leaven out of their homes and as a result what they've done is they've presented a phony token right they did not F go in accordance with the word of God they didn't go in accordance with what they were instructed to do and as a result there's no token there's no protection there's nothing right and so you know so many times people will say well I don't want to uh you know it's difficult it's for fear of conflict for fear of causing offense for fear of having an argument with the family because let's be real no one wants to do that nobody wants to have a hard conversation with the people they love the most that's hard right these are I mean again we talk about this so many times husbands and dads will die for their family right they will it is it is within our nature to do that and so to have conflict with those people that you love so much is so hard it's difficult and so we don't want to do it right we we we we we we kind of shrink back from it but don't forget that your job is to make is to protect the house right the the your your position God has has stood you up to be the leader who's going to say things that aren't necessarily popular sometimes and so often people like well I don't want to say this you know I don't want to enforce a standard of Holiness in my home I don't want to confront my wife or my children on this point because um you know it's going to create an argument well imagine imagine a dad in in Egypt going like well you know we're going to we're going to kill the lamb we're going to put the blood we're going to roast it with fire but we have some yeast rolles with our with our lamb well CU my family loves him so much and it was going to cause a big argument and we're going to fight all night and then everyone's going to go bed angry and then in the morning we're going to be all in out of sorts and we're going to be arguing with each other in the next morning yeah but you'll all be alive right everyone will be alive right I mean what's who's who which dad loves his his and and husband loves his family more the one who went along to go you know go went along to to get along and ended up with a Calamity at the end of it or the one who was a little bit unpopular and and ended up you know saving everybody at the end of the day uh we have a mandate as as men as Leaders to be unpopular sometimes right it's if you're looking for guess what you're supposed to be the type of Christ and Christ isn't always popular in case you hadn't heard matter of fact he was so unpopular they killed him right A lot of times now you do everything in love there's a balance you be belligerent you can be 100% correct in your Doctrine and wrong in your spirit and be a Pharisee okay that's also possible but it it requires the Life of Christ to be operating through that headship in order to to uh present a token that's going to save those children and to say and and and to to uh protect the home against any kind of con like attack of the devil you know um and I can say this you know and I know maybe this if anyone would have a a a a something in their heart to say well who's this guy doesn't have kids talking about being a father well let me tell you this I was the other side of that story okay when people have fear especially when you're dealing with teenagers have fear about I don't want to enforce a standard because I'm afraid it's going to drive my teenagers into the world okay well number one we are taught by the message of the hour that when you apply the token to your home a wayward loved one the token be can be applied and it will go after them no matter where they are okay you apply the token to your home even if it causes enough conflict to create a a temporary separation and the reason for that is no matter even if they leave your home they will not leave your token okay whereas if you compromise your standard and and and and just say well anything goes I don't want to hurt feelings I don't want to create separation then what you'll end up doing is they'll sit there thinking they're okay with no token at all and you've just delivered them to the angel of death on a silver platter okay you you have you have you have they would be better off to separate and and leave the home and still be under your token under your prayers than to remain in the home under a a a uh a a deceptive devil of religion telling them they're okay when they're not okay and I know that from experience I've been there and I've done that okay I've been the one who blew out into the world and it was because of my parents standard that brought me back okay this is you're not going to convince me that doesn't work it was only when I left and realized that I was wrong and needed salvation that I could even repent if I would have sat in a home that told me ah whatever you're you're okay you're living okay it'll be okay Mom and Dad will accept anything by the way Mom and Dad is the first version of God you'll ever see so the way Mom and Dad Act is going to color the way those children see God and and if Mom and Dad are okay with it then subconsciously well then God must be okay with it too no God's not okay with it okay and and the the end result I can tell you okay it was because of a token applied to my mom and dad's home that did not compromise it it you know I'm sure there were plenty of people who would have said well they're just a little bit legalistic well when the chips were down okay when it really mattered when it was down to the wire okay and it was on on on some night close to midnight when I was on my way to grab the pistol out of my nightstand yeah okay my my mom and dad's Holiness standard saved my life wow okay it wasn't and I don't mean like well I would have been out in the world no they'd have found my carcass in the river all right it was when I got to my front door to where my parents applied the token and said beyond this point is Holy Ground the spirit that was on me could not walk through that door and I turned and it drove me back into the arms of God so do not try to tell me that a Holiness standard that creates conflict with your children will not save them I've done it I've I was saved by it okay be courageous take God at his word when he says that he will save your children when you apply the token he means it and this this business of of well I'm a afraid I'm going to create conflict be conflicted at the end of the day you're not fighting with your kids you're fighting with the devil and the the devil may have been convinced that him and them are on the right on on the same team but they're not and the only way you're going to convince them otherwise is by upholding the standard and allowing God to work through you it's the only way God's not going there's going to be no power there's going to be no power whatsoever in a uh in a week um edited for non-conflict standard of the word there's no power in that at the end of the day the Tree of Life required 100% compliance for Adam and Eve to remain under its influence 100% compliance and when we edit things and when we say well we'll tolerate this sure kids sure wife you can eat of the tree and not surely die I mean come on like it requires that we be be be uncompromising in in what leaders allow in their homes it requires uncompromising uh uh upholding of Standards when we compromise then we strip the power of the word of the Lamb to protect us right when we when we say okay we'll kill the lamb we'll feed on the word we'll do all this stuff we'll be we'll be waiting for the Rapture with our staff in our hand but we'll allow leaven in in the home then the lamb died for nothing you all you did was murder a lamb that's all you did his his blood did you no benefit and I boy that's harsh I I know it you know it it believe me it scalds me before it'll ever reach you right I had to hear it first but it's the truth and if we want to have if we want to have the power of God moving in our lives you know people say oh we want to have the spirit of God moving in the church we want to have the spirit of God moving you know flowing want the gifts and the call you know moving in the church well guess what a church is made up of families amen all right and the church the spirit's not going to move in the church until it's moving in the families and the and and a family is made up of individuals and it starts with dads it starts with men recognizing that they have to live up to a standard of Christ recognizing that that we cannot compromise and and be and by the way before you point any finger at any member of your family recognize that you're pointing a whole lot of fingers back at yourself okay it's don't go don't go chastising your children for or your wife or how they're living before you get down on your knees and verify that you are up to Snuff yourself okay verify that you are not uh you are not the problem okay you know uh every every um no no family no church no organization will ever rise above the level of its leader amen okay no part of the body Rises higher than the head right amen okay as headship you are the the the level that your family will rise to and if you are living like a skunk then don't be surprised when your family does too amen okay that that's just the long and short of it if so if you want to see your family rise then you rise yourself and then because here's the thing if Dad is a hypocrite everybody in the family knows it right you can you can say all you want all you want right you can say whatever you want to say for as long as you want to say it but at the end of the day even if your your your kids can't even articulate it itively like they couldn't you know tell you what the matter is people know subconsciously right even if you couldn't tell you like you don't necessarily know your brain does right there's something in the back of your mind that goes okay there's something wrong here and you know we talk about because don't forget the token is to is to act as a barrier against the angel of death not you know the angel of mild inconvenience right it is it is the angel of of death right therefore when we talk about applying a token we talk about cleaning out the Lev we talk about um uh uh uh being in compliance with the Holiness standard okay and raising that standard over our lives we're talking about life and death issues there is death on the line and so when people say one thing but they don't act like death is on the line then it shows that they don't really believe it okay I can you know I work a lot with electricity right a lot of high voltage electricity and when I think a wire is hot I'm not going to let someone touch it right I'll knock you upside the head before I let you touch it right why because I'm not going to let you blow yourself up and me have to watch you get exploded if I have to hurt you feelings a little bit I'mma do it right because death is on the line amen right it's more important to me if you got a little cauliflower on the ear cuz I smacked you upside the head it's more important that you have that than your arm is exploded because you just grabbed you know 480 volts right this is important when dads do not act like death is on the line then your kids know that they don't really believe what they say they believe and they don't have to articulate that you never have to say that it just comes naturally amen right wow that was quick y'all still love me I still love you guys Amen brother but you know it's and we'll just stand and I'll I'll close with this the Bible says that those he loves he also chasteneth okay if if if we didn't preach the word and say what people didn't want to hear and say things that we know are probably going to make us unpopular then it shows we don't love you we could get a lot of adoration a lot of lip service by just tickling people's ears and just saying things that you know get you all whooped up and woohoo this is great you know it feels all all warm and fuzzy um but you know understand that when when any and and I don't want to make this about me or any anything else understand that you know the word of God speaks through many ministers and all ministers have to come to the same point where they're willing to to say no this is the stand that I'm going to make and I'm going to say things that are probably going to be unpopular to hear um because it's the word of God God would never do something God loves you right the God loves you he loves you so much he died for you and so when somebody who loves you that much is willing to say something that's going to make you upset understand they're saying it because it's necessary so we all love the Lord you all love the Lord everybody are you sure all right let's pray father Lord we we love you this morning and we know it is you you know every the the ins and outs of our hearts Lord you know every crack and and and crevice within our hearts Lord that where we would have things that we'd be holding on to or thing deep down on our inside where you know that we love you that you can recognize that seed that was inside of us father that like Boaz could see in Ruth you could see that same character that was in you is in is in US father that you could you could see it on our inside but Lord that no matter how much the devil would have us surrounded and would would battle us and embattle us and and cause doubts and fears and deceptions that Lord you would cut through all of it and that we could cling to the love that you have we could cling to your promise that no matter how tightly the devil may have us bound that we could break through all of it and rise to the level of your word that we could be made perfect made complete by Your Word acting and operating in our lives that father we wouldn't just simply try to lay claim to some some sacrifice Lord and say that that's the blood but reject the life thereof but Lord that we would say that that is the that is our Salvation that is our that is the the the the Messiah that we have accepted into our hearts the the the promised one that would Deliver Us from these things that have us bound that father we would find our Redemption and our submission to your word we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
