[56:53] have no Creed I have no Doctrine I have
[56:54] no message of my own but just Christ and
[56:57] him
[56:58] crucified I met him when I was a young
[57:00] boy and I got away from him got out into
[57:04] the world got into the army and was up
[57:07] at Fort Brag with the 18th Arbor Corp
[57:09] and did things that'd be ashamed for you
[57:11] to
[57:14] know but one
[57:15] [Music]
[57:18] nightl in an Old Barn down in Jonesburg
[57:21] Tennessee is actually on a Sunday
[57:24] afternoon
[57:26] I felt the presence of the Lord come
[57:28] into the room and I I knew it was him
[57:30] because I felt him when I was a
[57:32] boy and he spoke to me he said you go
[57:35] out that door I'll never call you
[57:38] again right there in that old building
[57:41] by myself not in the young people's
[57:42] meeting just there by myself I knelled
[57:45] at that door gave my heart to the Lord
[57:49] Jesus and I told him I said I'll follow
[57:52] you wherever you lead me I'll go
[57:54] Hallelujah so that's why I'm here this
[57:57] weekend and may the Lord richly bless
[58:00] you if you have your Bibles turn with us

[58:49] 4:9 and the Bible says
[58:52] this in this was manifested the love of
[58:55] God
[58:56] towards
[58:57] us because that God sent his only
[59:00] begotten son into the
[59:01] world that we might live through
[59:06] him that we might live through himl
[59:10] Hebrews
[59:12] 12:2 the Bible says
[59:24] this looking unto Jesus Jus the author
[59:27] and finisher of our faith who for the
[59:30] joy that was set before him endured the

[1:00:57] look unto Jesus the author and finisher
[1:01:01] of our faith who for the joy that was
[1:01:04] set before him endured the cross
[1:01:07] despising the shame and is set down at
[1:01:11] the right hand of the Throne of God now
[1:01:14] referring to the scripture the prophet
[1:01:16] of God said now God is saying here look
[1:01:18] unto me look unto me for I am God and
[1:01:22] there is none other and he said I wonder
[1:01:25] in a time that we're living in now what
[1:01:28] could we look to that would be more
[1:01:30] solid than God all right and God is the
[1:01:34] word so look to the word of God today
[1:01:37] for your answer the Bible has the answer
[1:01:41] for this day and let me say friends
[1:01:43] we're living in a time that Fox News
[1:01:45] says that CNN is fake and CNN says Fox
[1:01:49] is fake and they both say Newsmax is
[1:01:51] fake and the Democrats say the
[1:01:53] Republicans are fake and the Republicans
[1:01:55] say the Dem rats are fake and nobody
[1:01:57] knows what the truth is anymore but I
[1:02:00] want you to know tonight there is a
[1:02:02] truth and the word of God is the truth
[1:02:05] and the prophet of God said they don't
[1:02:07] have the answer the Democrats don't have
[1:02:09] the answer the Republicans don't have
[1:02:11] the answer come on somebody they do not
[1:02:14] have the answer but the Bible has the
[1:02:17] answer for this day it had it for other
[1:02:19] days and it's got it forever because
[1:02:22] it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:02:24] today and forever ever you see we're
[1:02:26] living in a time that there's no
[1:02:28] stability in the society as we know it
[1:02:31] today they have ripped up the
[1:02:33] foundations of marriage they're
[1:02:34] destroying the foundations of gender is
[1:02:38] that not true friends they're blurring
[1:02:40] the lines between right and wrong and
[1:02:42] we're living in an unstable Society
[1:02:46] we're living in a time that the world
[1:02:48] has absolutely gone
[1:02:52] insane amen fact the world has gone
[1:02:56] insane when they don't even know what
[1:02:58] bathroom to use
[1:03:00] anymore but I'm so glad tonight that
[1:03:03] there's another people that's lost their
[1:03:04] mind Hallelujah we've got the mind of
[1:03:07] Christ amen because we know what he
[1:03:10] wants done with his word an unstable
[1:03:14] Society they've blurred the lines
[1:03:16] between right and wrong to the point
[1:03:18] that they don't even know what truth is
[1:03:22] it reminds me of the days of Jesus we
[1:03:24] see repeating again in when he stood
[1:03:27] before Pilate right and pilate looked at
[1:03:30] him and said what is
[1:03:32] truth and truth was standing right
[1:03:35] before him amen and let me say young
[1:03:38] people the only foundation that is sure
[1:03:41] the only foundation that is true is the
[1:03:44] word of God on Christ the solid rock I
[1:03:48] stand all other ground is sinking
[1:03:53] sand but the word of God is an
[1:03:56] everpresent help in the time of trouble
[1:04:01] in a time of trouble a troubl society a
[1:04:04] troubled nation that we are living in
[1:04:07] Christ has the answer amen you see when
[1:04:10] the children of Israel was being bitten
[1:04:12] by
[1:04:13] snakes and Moses could not pray for all
[1:04:16] of them so God told him go and erect the
[1:04:19] brass Serpent and put it on a pole and
[1:04:23] they were to look upon that Serpent and
[1:04:25] live amen and Prophet said let's take
[1:04:28] the symbol of that the first thing the
[1:04:30] brass serpent represented was Jesus
[1:04:33] himself because the serpent represented
[1:04:36] sin already judged from the Garden of
[1:04:39] Eden and Jesus was made sin for us
[1:04:43] knowing no sin knowing no sin but he was
[1:04:48] made sin for
[1:04:51] us oh my amen the brass that the serpent
[1:04:56] was made out of represented Divine
[1:04:59] judgment brass is divine judgment and
[1:05:02] the pole of course was the cross and the
[1:05:05] brass serpent couldn't pray for anyone
[1:05:07] they was just to look at the brass
[1:05:09] Serpent and live look and live and that
[1:05:12] was a type of Christ and if they could
[1:05:15] look at that type and live how much more
[1:05:17] can you and I tonight look at the
[1:05:19] antitype which is Jesus Christ
[1:05:22] himself we can look to him and live amen
[1:05:27] amen the only way to live is through
[1:05:30] Jesus
[1:05:31] Christ let me say that again the only
[1:05:34] way to live is through Jesus Christ he
[1:05:37] is the way the truth and life the life
[1:05:42] amen you know there's some women in the
[1:05:44] hotel room up in Canada and the prophet
[1:05:47] of God was up there in some meetings and
[1:05:48] he was staying at that hotel and these
[1:05:50] women come down the hall and they' been
[1:05:54] drinking and they said they didn't have
[1:05:56] no shoes on if I remember it right and
[1:05:58] they had a bottle of liquor in their
[1:05:59] hand and they were staggering down the
[1:06:01] hall singing one of them kicked up their
[1:06:03] leg and said whoopee this is
[1:06:06] life brother Ben said I couldn't stand
[1:06:09] it anymore and I stepped out and said
[1:06:11] that's not life it's
[1:06:13] death amen hallelujah she that liveth in
[1:06:17] pleasure is dead while she yet
[1:06:20] liveth that's not life people strive so
[1:06:24] much to be popular to be rich there's
[1:06:26] nothing wrong with having money there's
[1:06:28] nothing wrong with having a good job in
[1:06:29] a house but if that's your God that's
[1:06:32] wrong and people will strive so hard to
[1:06:35] be famous to be popular to have so many
[1:06:40] followers on talk Tick Tick Tock or
[1:06:43] whatever I don't
[1:06:44] know but to be famous but look where
[1:06:48] does popularity lead many
[1:06:51] people they end up hanging theel in a
[1:06:54] hotel room because that does not give
[1:06:59] life Hallelujah The Thirst that's in
[1:07:02] them that was put there by God
[1:07:04] hallelujah that thirst cannot be
[1:07:06] answered by Hollywood by popularity by
[1:07:12] money amen there's only one thing
[1:07:15] that'll satisfy that thirst that's put
[1:07:17] in every one of us and that's Jesus
[1:07:21] Christ she that liveth in pleasure is
[1:07:23] dead while she yet liveth

[1:07:29] Adam all

[1:09:28] a world before there was a
[1:09:31] star he knew your name he knew the color
[1:09:35] of your eyes and the color of your hair

[1:09:46] people could only see that if I could
[1:09:48] only pound that into the people that
[1:09:51] Jesus died that he might take the people
[1:09:54] away from this hybrid Church stuff he
[1:09:57] didn't die to make us a bunch of church
[1:09:59] members he didn't die to make us a
[1:10:01] denomination to make us an organization

[1:11:12] Faith well I don't know if it'll work or
[1:11:14] not but he died to bring our faith back
[1:11:17] to what God Said Hallelujah where is the
[1:11:21] resting place of our faith tonight not

[1:11:29] Said Amen Jesus never died that we'd
[1:11:33] have a weak Faith or a hybrid faith I
[1:11:35] don't know if it'll work or not but he
[1:11:37] died to bring our faith back to what God

[1:12:09] I'm not used to I just have to be myself
[1:12:12] okay but go with me tonight let's let's
[1:12:15] take a little
[1:12:17] trip you want to go with
[1:12:21] me we
[1:12:23] find our
[1:12:26] self in a
[1:12:30] garden and we see over here they are
[1:12:33] three
[1:12:34] men and they're laying under a
[1:12:37] tree
[1:12:40] sleeping and we go about a stone throw
[1:12:45] away and we hear the
[1:12:48] voice it is the
[1:12:50] voice of a
[1:12:53] man his voice voice is
[1:12:57] trembling he's in great
[1:13:00] Agony and we can hear by the tone of his
[1:13:04] voice he's
[1:13:08] afraid this is the
[1:13:11] voice of
[1:13:14] Jesus brother darl you say Jesus was
[1:13:19] afraid the Bible said he was Hebrews 5:7
[1:13:24] who in the the days of his flesh when he
[1:13:28] had offered up prayers and supplication
[1:13:30] with strong crying and tears unto him
[1:13:34] that was able to save him from death and
[1:13:38] was heard in that he
[1:13:43] feared we
[1:13:45] see that he's
[1:13:48] sweating and his sweat is turning to
[1:13:52] Great
[1:13:53] drops of blood
[1:13:56] you see there's a medical condition
[1:13:58] that's known as
[1:14:00] hematosis and hematosis is where the
[1:14:03] capillaries that feed the sweat glands
[1:14:06] they actually rupture and the blood
[1:14:09] seeps into the sweat glands and a man
[1:14:12] will actually sweat
[1:14:14] blood hematosis happens it happens under
[1:14:18] extreme physical and mental stress amen
[1:14:24] Luke being a position he catches this
[1:14:27] understanding and he writes about it so
[1:14:29] that we may know and Luke writes in
[1:14:32] 22:24 he said that he that being in
[1:14:36] agony and the word agony you know what
[1:14:39] that means it means a struggle for
[1:14:43] [Music]
[1:14:45] victory before there could be a victory
[1:14:48] there must be a
[1:14:50] Victor and we find him here in anguish
[1:14:53] struggling for Victory
[1:14:57] amen Luke said he prayed more earnestly
[1:15:00] and his sweat was like drops of blood
[1:15:03] falling to the
[1:15:06] ground we
[1:15:07] notice he's
[1:15:10] praying said
[1:15:14] father if there be any other
[1:15:19] way please let this cup pass from me
[1:15:25] Mark 14:36 he said Abba Father all
[1:15:28] things are possible unto thee take away
[1:15:31] this cup from me nevertheless not what I
[1:15:34] will but what thy
[1:15:36] will all
[1:15:39] things you're God you can do
[1:15:44] anything surely there could be another
[1:15:48] way don't make me drink this
[1:15:52] cup you see from the time he was a
[1:15:54] little little
[1:15:56] boy he had seen
[1:15:58] crucifixions and Rome knew how to
[1:16:00] inflict punishment on the prisoners and
[1:16:03] they would crucify him out on the
[1:16:04] roadway so that we we walk by you could
[1:16:06] see them on the cross and you would say
[1:16:08] if you mess with Rome this is what you
[1:16:11] get and from the time he was a little
[1:16:14] boy he saw men hanging on
[1:16:18] crosses and not only that he was the
[1:16:20] word and being the word he knows all
[1:16:23] things
[1:16:26] and he says
[1:16:27] father you're
[1:16:29] God you can do
[1:16:34] anything don't make me drink this
[1:16:37] cup and he gets
[1:16:41] up and he goes to his
[1:16:44] disciples and where does he find
[1:16:48] them
[1:16:50] asleep and he wakes up Peter and he says
[1:16:53] Peter wait wake
[1:16:55] up Peter
[1:17:01] Just
[1:17:03] Master what's the
[1:17:06] matter you're
[1:17:09] Satan I've never seen you like this I've
[1:17:12] seen you walk on the water I've seen you
[1:17:14] raise the dead I've seen you feed
[1:17:16] 5,000 but I've never seen is that blood
[1:17:20] is are you
[1:17:23] bleeding Peter
[1:17:27] Peter watch with me
[1:17:30] Peter watch with me pray Peter would you
[1:17:35] pray with
[1:17:42] me the Bible
[1:17:45] says he goes
[1:17:48] again and he falls upon the ground and
[1:17:51] he begins to pray and Peter's saying
[1:17:55] what shall I
[1:17:58] pray what do you want me to
[1:18:03] pray the Bible said he went again a
[1:18:06] second time and he prayed saying oh
[1:18:08] father if this cup may not pass away
[1:18:10] from me except I drink
[1:18:12] it th will be
[1:18:16] done and the prophet said a conference
[1:18:18] was
[1:18:19] called and the
[1:18:22] father he said Gabriel come down sat on
[1:18:25] the Rock wormwood came down all the
[1:18:27] other Angels came down and began to sit
[1:18:29] around in the
[1:18:31] garden then he said that Pillar of
[1:18:37] Fire came
[1:18:40] down a conference was called and the
[1:18:43] father said are you
[1:18:45] willing is your love for your brethren
[1:18:48] great enough is your love for that
[1:18:50] sinful stinking world that you were born
[1:18:52] in do you love him enough to forfeit
[1:18:55] your life do you love them enough to
[1:18:57] take their place to Bear their sin the
[1:19:00] hardest cruelest death they will cut you
[1:19:02] to pieces they will drain every drop of
[1:19:05] blood from your body the prophet said
[1:19:08] there could be nothing that could die
[1:19:09] that kind of death but him and in that
[1:19:11] conference such a decision was made
[1:19:13] until the blood dropped from his brow
[1:19:15] that he was under such a strain and the
[1:19:17] sins of the world was upon him my sins
[1:19:20] was upon him your sins upon Him amen
[1:19:25] whether we're eight or whether we're 80
[1:19:26] tonight our sins was upon
[1:19:30] Him brother said oh can we have that
[1:19:32] decision in our hearts tonight can you
[1:19:34] forfeit that little filthy life of yours
[1:19:37] are you willing to look in his face and
[1:19:38] say not my will I'm a drunker but I'll
[1:19:41] drink no more I'm a gambler but I'll
[1:19:43] gamble no more I'm immoral but I'll be
[1:19:45] immoral no more I'm a liar but I'll stop
[1:19:47] it today I'm a foul person but in this
[1:19:50] conference tonight I'll look into your
[1:19:53] face
[1:19:55] and I will do like my master I will take
[1:19:58] like my master who died for me to make
[1:20:00] my way clear and I will say to him not
[1:20:03] my
[1:20:04] will but your will be done in my
[1:20:10] life and the prophet said after the
[1:20:13] father had spoke to
[1:20:15] him then Here Comes
[1:20:17] Satan you see Satan spoke to him just
[1:20:20] like he tries to speak to us after you
[1:20:22] have a good service and you feel God in
[1:20:24] then when you get out in the parking lot
[1:20:26] or when you get home then Satan will
[1:20:27] tell you oh that was just emotion you
[1:20:29] never got nothing God don't care for
[1:20:32] you but you know what you need to tell
[1:20:34] the devil you know people come all the
[1:20:36] time up for prayer and they say brother
[1:20:38] Daryl the devil told me this and the
[1:20:39] devil told me that and the devil said
[1:20:41] this and the first thing that comes to
[1:20:42] my mind is why do you listen to him you
[1:20:45] know he's a
[1:20:47] liar he can't tell the
[1:20:50] truth they can't quote two good quotes
[1:20:52] they can't quote one good Bible
[1:20:54] scripture but they can tell you
[1:20:56] everything the devil said to
[1:20:58] them you know sometimes I think we need
[1:21:00] to tell the devil why don't you s down
[1:21:02] and shut
[1:21:05] up well brother darl we don't say shut
[1:21:07] up around here we teach our children not
[1:21:09] to say those kind of things well then
[1:21:11] tell him to
[1:21:12] hush tell him something I said tell him
[1:21:16] something let your voice be heard when
[1:21:18] he tries to remind you of your past you
[1:21:19] need to remind him of his
[1:21:21] future Hallelujah you need to tell him I
[1:21:24] can't wait for the day I see you thrown
[1:21:26] into the Lake of

[1:21:51] serpent
[1:21:55] Satan begin to talk it's too
[1:21:59] much oh it's too
[1:22:03] much he's asking too much of
[1:22:09] you is it really fair that you should
[1:22:13] die for something they

[1:22:21] stole you never looked at something on
[1:22:23] the Internet you shouldn't look at

[1:22:35] sins he's asking too much it's far far

[1:22:42] heavy the burden that you must
[1:22:45] carry is too
[1:22:48] heavy save
[1:22:51] yourself but you see if he saved himself
[1:22:54] he could not save

[1:23:05] Buford South Carolina that there'll be
[1:23:07] any young people there that will even
[1:23:10] care what you're fixing to do in that
[1:23:13] world when everything is instant this
[1:23:16] and instant that and there's so much
[1:23:19] information being pounded into their
[1:23:21] head do you think they'll ever take the
[1:23:24] time to even care well I'd like to tell
[1:23:27] the devil tonight I don't know about you

[1:23:52] [Applause]
[1:23:56] Hallelujah the prophet said there was a
[1:23:58] time after a perfect life of 33 and a
[1:24:02] half years he had lived a man who wanted
[1:24:04] to
[1:24:05] live as much as you and I want to live a
[1:24:09] man who had something to live for
[1:24:11] Brethren that he loved people that he
[1:24:15] loved they sat around the campfire with
[1:24:17] the
[1:24:19] disciples they say Peter tell me a good
[1:24:22] fishing story who don't like a good
[1:24:25] fishing story and they would sit around
[1:24:28] and laugh and maybe talk about the time
[1:24:30] Peter fell out of the boat or whatever
[1:24:32] it would be and just laugh and slap one
[1:24:34] another on just as we get around and
[1:24:35] have a good time in a fellowship hall
[1:24:38] they were just sitting around the
[1:24:39] campfire enjoying each other's company
[1:24:41] enjoying
[1:24:44] life he loved their Fellowship he loved
[1:24:49] sunsets he liked to watch the sun set up
[1:24:52] on the water and satting there watch
[1:24:54] watching the disciples laugh slap each
[1:24:57] other on the shoulder he realized
[1:25:00] sitting there watching them enjoying
[1:25:04] life he realized the only way they could
[1:25:10] live was for
[1:25:12] him to
[1:25:16] die he remembered the words he spoke yet
[1:25:20] a little while the world will see me no
[1:25:22] more but ye shall see me
[1:25:25] ye shall see me because I live ye shall
[1:25:30] live
[1:25:35] also you see he realized he was the only
[1:25:40] one who could
[1:25:42] fulfill that
[1:25:45] scripture Peter couldn't do it Moses
[1:25:48] couldn't do it Daniel couldn't do it
[1:25:51] Isaiah couldn't do it brother brandom
[1:25:53] couldn't do it brother brother Jason
[1:25:54] couldn't do it brother Brad couldn't do
[1:25:57] it only
[1:26:00] him it all came down to him the only way
[1:26:06] that these could live the only way that
[1:26:09] he could ever enjoy the
[1:26:12] fellowship he would have to
[1:26:20] die oh
[1:26:22] God the only
[1:26:29] way that he could ever gather together
[1:26:33] again as
[1:26:36] brothers was for him to die and to
[1:26:40] resurrect so that they could follow in
[1:26:44] his
[1:26:45] steps and there in the Garden of Eden
[1:26:48] has he sweating it out it's the only
[1:26:50] place you ever see his will ever come
[1:26:53] into focus it was always I come to do
[1:26:56] the will of my father I come to do the
[1:26:58] will of he who sent me I do nothing
[1:27:00] except my father show me first this is
[1:27:02] the only place you find him ever
[1:27:04] wrestling out his own will that's right
[1:27:08] if there be any other way Lord if there
[1:27:10] be any of your God you can do
[1:27:13] anything don't make me drink this
[1:27:17] cup but there in that conference he
[1:27:20] realized he was the only one
[1:27:24] who could do it
[1:27:27] amen and there he
[1:27:30] surrendered his
[1:27:34] will and he said not my will let thy
[1:27:39] will be
[1:27:41] done and he steps into the will of the
[1:27:49] father and they arrested him
[1:27:55] and all night long without sleep without
[1:27:59] water without food amen they tried
[1:28:05] him he said I hid not my back from the
[1:28:09] smiters nor my cheeks from those who
[1:28:12] pluck the hair from my face I hid not my
[1:28:16] face from the
[1:28:18] spit and from their
[1:28:21] shame friends you know as as well as I
[1:28:24] do if I walked up to you and went you
[1:28:28] would oh yeah amen but he said I hid not
[1:28:33] my face from their
[1:28:36] spit all night long they smacked him and
[1:28:41] tried him without sleep without rest
[1:28:43] without water without food and they took
[1:28:46] him from Pilot's
[1:28:48] Hall and they tied him to a whipping
[1:28:51] post and they took these rods and they
[1:28:54] begin to strike him on his back and
[1:28:57] those rods would break the capillaries
[1:28:59] into the skin it would cause deep
[1:29:02] bruising and then after they broke it
[1:29:04] all up in his back till it was just one
[1:29:06] great bruise they took the canine Tails
[1:29:09] a whip with pieces of bone and pieces of
[1:29:12] glass and they would strike him into the
[1:29:14] back and they would rip it like that and
[1:29:16] it would rip open great wounds and the
[1:29:19] blood because the capillaries had broke
[1:29:21] into the skin the blood would gush out
[1:29:23] of his body
[1:29:27] Paul said I got 39 I got 40 Stripes
[1:29:29] minus one five different times but there
[1:29:32] was nobody here counting the stripes
[1:29:34] there was nobody saying that was
[1:29:36] enough they struck him and struck him
[1:29:39] until they had to take over and somebody
[1:29:41] else had to swing the
[1:29:44] whip stripe after to stripe until they
[1:29:48] caused deep wounds in his back that you
[1:29:50] could actually see his kidneys
[1:29:54] through the gaping wounds of his
[1:30:01] back oh
[1:30:04] God but the Bible says for the joy set
[1:30:09] before
[1:30:10] him he
[1:30:12] endured the
[1:30:15] cross what was on his mind what was he
[1:30:19] thinking as they whipped him at the
[1:30:23] whipping post
[1:30:25] oh
[1:30:27] God he starts up Calvary the prophet God
[1:30:30] said I can see him His Garment a spot of
[1:30:32] red here and a spot of there until it
[1:30:34] becomes just one bloody garment slapping
[1:30:37] against his
[1:30:39] legs and they take him up
[1:30:42] Calvary and they throw him
[1:30:45] down and they take this arm he bend it
[1:30:48] way back like this and drive it into the
[1:30:51] board and then they take this arm way
[1:30:54] back like this and drive it into the
[1:30:56] board and then they had a platform where
[1:30:58] they put their feet and they crossed his
[1:31:00] legs and drove a nail into both of his
[1:31:03] feet on this platform and then they
[1:31:05] raised him up into the air like
[1:31:07] this and
[1:31:09] he dropped him into a hoe in the ground
[1:31:13] and the Bible said all my bones are out
[1:31:17] of
[1:31:18] joint you see his arm stretched out like
[1:31:21] this and out like this and the way they
[1:31:23] had that when he went into the ground it
[1:31:26] dislocated his shoulders anybody have a
[1:31:28] dislocated bone it's one of the most
[1:31:30] painful things ask Brother Brad he was
[1:31:32] in surgery people come in with a
[1:31:34] dislocated shoulder or a dislocated hip
[1:31:36] you have to put them asleep to put it
[1:31:37] back in place because they cannot stand
[1:31:39] the pain and let me tell you it wasn't
[1:31:41] just his help but the Bible said all my
[1:31:44] bones amen are out of
[1:31:48] joint they came up me with their mouths
[1:31:52] they waged their heads they shoot out
[1:31:54] their
[1:31:58] lips oh
[1:32:02] God he was cut to Pieces the Bible said
[1:32:06] his face was disfigured more than any
[1:32:09] man's face had ever been disfigured
[1:32:11] before when you looked at him you
[1:32:13] couldn't even tell who he
[1:32:15] was amen where they had smacked him and
[1:32:20] beat on
[1:32:21] him and no one was there
[1:32:25] to stop
[1:32:27] him no one was
[1:32:29] there
[1:32:31] Peter James
[1:32:34] John
[1:32:39] no when he stretched him out like
[1:32:42] this it would stretch the
[1:32:45] diaphrag and it caused where you
[1:32:47] couldn't get a deep
[1:32:48] breath so you would actually smother
[1:32:51] while you hung on the cross but Rome put
[1:32:53] a platform there so that you could push
[1:32:55] yourself up and when you pushed yourself
[1:32:58] up it would relax the diaphragm enough
[1:33:00] for you to get some breath so hanging
[1:33:04] there between the heavens and the Earth
[1:33:06] bleeding with the
[1:33:11] spit he would push
[1:33:19] up when he couldn't hold it up no longer
[1:33:21] he would go back down like this and he
[1:33:23] would SMUD smother smother
[1:33:28] did and he' go down and he'd smother and
[1:33:32] his
[1:33:38] mother said he was a man when he died at
[1:33:41] Calvary for sacrifice bleeding the blood
[1:33:43] running out of him like a mortal spit
[1:33:45] hanging all over his beard he was a man
[1:33:47] disgraced hanging in shame taking our
[1:33:49] place he was a man and when the pain got
[1:33:51] so great
[1:33:53] when the pain got so great he couldn't
[1:33:57] bear it anymore he pushed up on the
[1:34:02] cross my God my
[1:34:09] God
[1:34:10] what
[1:34:13] now
[1:34:16] for

[1:34:46] from helping me from the words of my
[1:34:48] roaring help

[1:34:54] said a curse hanging on a tree

[1:34:59] creation he created was forsaken him the
[1:35:01] moon the stars the sun everything

[1:35:09] died alone let me tell you young people
[1:35:12] there might have been days that you felt
[1:35:13] like you was so all alone that you
[1:35:15] couldn't take another moment there may
[1:35:16] have been times that you felt like
[1:35:18] nobody cared for you and nobody loved
[1:35:20] you and nobody understand you I guess
[1:35:22] all of us has felt that way from one
[1:35:23] time or another but let me tell you the
[1:35:25] worst day of our life the worst day of
[1:35:28] my entire life has never been like this

[1:35:38] its light for us oh Hallelujah has the
[1:35:40] son ever hid its face from
[1:35:44] us but it did him the prophet
[1:35:47] said what was on his
[1:35:50] mind what was he thinking about how how
[1:35:54] was he bearing the
[1:35:58] pain he labored so we could
[1:36:02] rest he suffered so we could be healed
[1:36:06] he died so we could live he was
[1:36:10] forsaken that you and I could say
[1:36:12] tonight you promised me you'd never
[1:36:15] leave me nor would you forsake
[1:36:20] me he pressed up on the cross
[1:36:28] a
[1:36:31] thirst of
[1:36:34] thirst you
[1:36:36] see there's a condition known as hypo
[1:36:40] Valic shock hypovolemic shock is when
[1:36:44] the body loses so much
[1:36:47] fluid that it'll take the fluid that's
[1:36:49] left and pull it into the vital organs
[1:36:51] like your liver and your kidneys and
[1:36:53] your in your heart to keep you alive and
[1:36:56] he hanging there on the cross he said my
[1:36:58] tongue it cleaveth into my
[1:37:00] jaw what was he experiencing hypovolemic
[1:37:04] shock he was going into
[1:37:07] shock that's why he was so thirsty his
[1:37:10] body was craving fluid because all his
[1:37:12] blood was spilled out on the ground you
[1:37:15] can look all around the cross it was
[1:37:17] just one bloody
[1:37:19] Hillside he said my tongue because the
[1:37:21] moisture of his mouth had all dried up

[1:37:29] jaw I
[1:37:32] thirst a
[1:37:34] thirst his body was
[1:37:36] dying and they ran and got vinegar on a
[1:37:39] sponge and they tried to give him a
[1:37:40] drink but he refused it he refused to
[1:37:43] drink the vinegar because it was like an
[1:37:46] anesthetic you see he wanted to fill it
[1:37:49] all he wanted to fill every bit of it
[1:37:51] for you
[1:37:54] his body was dying and the Bible says
[1:37:58] for the joy for the joy set before

[1:43:18] vinegar from a sponge but the only thing
[1:43:21] that would satisfy that hunger the only
[1:43:24] thing that would satisfy that longing
[1:43:26] that was in his
[1:43:28] heart was for your fellowship

[1:43:44] suits I've got in my
[1:43:46] closet and he had one but he never asked
[1:43:51] the father for one
[1:43:53] new
[1:43:55] suit never he never asked the father for
[1:43:59] a new garment he walked everywhere he
[1:44:04] went but not one time did he ever ask
[1:44:07] the father for a chariot to make his
[1:44:11] journey a little
[1:44:16] easier he said the birds have nest and
[1:44:19] the foxes have burls but I the son of
[1:44:22] man

[1:44:24] place to lay my head he never had a
[1:44:31] house he
[1:44:33] never had a
[1:44:35] house but he never asked a father for a
[1:44:38] place to live he never asked for a new
[1:44:41] suit he never asked for a chariot he
[1:44:43] never asked for a house the only thing
[1:44:46] he ever asked
[1:44:51] for was our fellowship
[1:45:01] the joy that was set before him was to
[1:45:05] see you sitting here and receiving that
[1:45:08] day at
[1:45:09] Calvary because on that Resurrection
[1:45:12] morning he realized what he had done
[1:45:15] fulfilled the prophecy of his scripture
[1:45:18] amen when he said because I live because
[1:45:21] I live ye shall live
[1:45:26] also now now because I've done this we

[2:08:26] everyone about Freedom you know what you
[2:08:29] heard tonight friends you
[2:08:31] heard the oldest originalist is that a
[2:08:36] word the very first form of the Gospel
[2:08:41] that ever went out to the world Jesus
[2:08:44] died to save Sinners Hallelujah that God
[2:08:48] so loved the world sent his son my
[2:08:51] brother R said God lived and his son
[2:08:53] came and took took death upon himself he
[2:08:58] who knew no sin became sined you know
[2:09:01] why he had never committed a sin but he
[2:09:04] had you had and he took it all and
[2:09:07] brother brandham says God judged him a
[2:09:11] sinner and sent him to
[2:09:13] hell that's right he went into the
[2:09:16] straight into the lower parts he that
[2:09:18] ascended is the same that first
[2:09:20] descended into the lower parts of the
[2:09:21] earth said God judged him a sinner and
[2:09:24] sent him to hell you know why friends
[2:09:26] you know why so you and me would never
[2:09:29] have to go I just say blessed be the
[2:09:32] name of the Lord blessed be the name of
[2:09:35] the Lord he's worthy of
[2:09:40] Praise I'm glad we have a
[2:09:43] victory I'm glad that we have a Victor
[2:09:46] so we can have Victory I I like having
[2:09:49] Victory my I remember hearing a
[2:09:51] a man testified one time I was young
[2:09:54] myself it so moved my heart and he was
[2:09:56] so sincere with it he was just telling
[2:09:58] just a simple gospel and he's looked out
[2:10:01] in that audience and I was sitting out
[2:10:02] of that audience and he said he said one
[2:10:05] day he said I I realized that I was
[2:10:09] dying and on my way to hell and there
[2:10:11] was nothing I could do about it but God
[2:10:14] loved me and Christ saved me and he said
[2:10:16] I had no way to turn it around but the
[2:10:19] Lord loved me that much and and turn my
[2:10:21] life around that's why friends that's
[2:10:24] why you know I I I I believe that this
[2:10:26] gospel it should be told constantly and
[2:10:29] you know something it's not a cheap
[2:10:30] gospel I think you heard tonight I think
[2:10:33] you'd agree with me hearing brother
[2:10:35] Daryl describe all of that detail I just
[2:10:39] say brothers sisters we can never let
[2:10:42] this gospel become a cheap gospel this
[2:10:45] gospel is dripping with the blood of
[2:10:48] Martyrs it's dripping with the blood of
[2:10:50] Christ Hal huah it's worth serving it's
[2:10:54] worth living for I believe that friends
[2:10:58] and I I thought to myself as brother
[2:10:59] Daryl was preaching I thought you know I
[2:11:01] I'd always said to myself you know he
[2:11:03] saw me the Bible says that he he'll see
[2:11:05] his seed and be satisfied he saw me but
[2:11:09] as brother Daryl took it a step I had
[2:11:11] never quite taken in my mind he didn't
[2:11:13] just see
[2:11:14] me he saw me
[2:11:17] free he saw me finished he didn't see me
[2:11:20] b bound he didn't he didn't die so as
[2:11:24] Brother D said so you could have weak
[2:11:26] Faith he didn't die so you could be
[2:11:27] bound he died so you could be free am he
[2:11:31] didn't die so you could be a slave to
[2:11:33] the devil he died so you could be Sons
[2:11:35] and Daughters of God oh my I'm here to
[2:11:38] tell you that's worth something to me he
[2:11:41] died so that I could be healed so that I
[2:11:45] could be free and so that I can be
[2:11:48] strong my I love any anytime I hear the
[2:11:52] story of that day on Calvary I want to
[2:11:55] tell you something friends that has
[2:11:57] tugged at my heart since a boy I I never
[2:12:01] tired of hearing about that day on
[2:12:04] Calvary it changed my whole life I see
[2:12:08] Jesus surrendering in that Garden you
[2:12:10] know friends I want to tell you
[2:12:12] something I really believe that Jesus
[2:12:15] was able to surrender in Gethsemane I've
[2:12:19] thought this for years he was able to
[2:12:22] surrender there because he had spent his
[2:12:24] whole life surrendering he surrendered
[2:12:27] his way all the way to a surrender how
[2:12:30] could he go to Calvary he had been going
[2:12:32] to Calvary since a
[2:12:34] child he had always did that which
[2:12:38] pleased the father I thought to myself
[2:12:41] tonight I thought you
[2:12:43] know I'm I've been my whole I'm in an
[2:12:48] order of ascending and I've been
[2:12:51] ascending for a long time and one of
