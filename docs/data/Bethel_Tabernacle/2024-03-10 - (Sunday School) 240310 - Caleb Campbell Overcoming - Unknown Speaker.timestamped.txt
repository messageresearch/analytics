[0:01] that the Book of Revelation speaks of
[0:02] it's just it's a spirit on the age so
[0:05] even when you're born again of the
[0:07] spirit of God you still have to actively
[0:09] fight against that spirit amen because
[0:12] it's Waring against each of
[0:14] us talking a little bit about overcoming
[0:17] you know you'll never be an overcomer
[0:20] unless you have the Holy Ghost that is a
[0:23] solid Firm Foundation you can't be
[0:25] because it's Jesus who overcame death
[0:29] hell and the grave so it's through him
[0:32] that we overcome Amen brother Brenham he
[0:35] makes it so clear in some of the quotes
[0:37] we get into he says and how can I
[0:40] overcome uh a pretty appropriate sermon
[0:43] for this he says the Lord Jesus an hour
[0:45] and 15 minutes ago standing trying to
[0:49] take your word he's he's just speaking
[0:52] to the people he's Lord Jesus standing
[0:54] here trying to take your word and
[0:55] explain to the people how to overcome
[0:57] you told us how it's done and you did
[1:00] didn't only tell us but you showed us
[1:01] how it was done you led us you showed us
[1:04] how to do it to receive the word inside
[1:07] of us and be sure to hold that word it
[1:10] is written in every temptation but be
[1:13] humble walk humbly now and I wanted to
[1:16] pin this here watch this here he says
[1:17] then we have com conquered through you
[1:22] through your power which has already
[1:24] conquered our enemy and the only thing
[1:27] we have to do is just walk humbly with
[1:30] faith believing that and our Badge of
[1:34] identification of the Holy Ghost and
[1:37] Satan has to move so we have a badge of
[1:41] identification and it says to even be an
[1:43] overcomer you you have to have that
[1:46] Badge of uh of identification and that's
[1:48] the very thing that you yield to the
[1:51] devil when he comes in your life and
[1:53] says you can't do a certain thing well
[1:56] devil I've got the holy ghost in my life
[1:57] and he already overcame you so therefore
[2:00] I can overcome based on what he's
[2:02] already done amen it's already a work
[2:04] now I'm just living out what the Lord
[2:05] has told me to live out in my
[2:08] life now you have to blend that
[2:10] perfectly with brother brandham
[2:12] describing overcoming in the last day
[2:14] and how God doesn't want to push us
[2:16] through a pipe we and we come out the
[2:18] other side as Overcomers you're going to
[2:20] have tests after you're born again
[2:22] you're going to have trials you're going
[2:23] to have Temptations in our Christian
[2:25] Journey but the scripture we read this
[2:27] morning is greater is he that is in you
[2:29] than he that is in the world Amen who is
[2:32] he he is the spirit of Truth the Lord
[2:36] Jesus so young people old people anybody
[2:38] in here if you're struggling with
[2:40] something in your life if you have
[2:41] temptations you seem you can't overcome
[2:44] just ensure with everything you've got
[2:46] that you have been born again of the
[2:48] spirit of God Ure that you have the go
[2:50] holy ghost that you've been regenerated
[2:53] because you'll never overcome those
[2:55] things without that solid
[2:58] foundation but once you have that now
[3:01] you have the badge of
[3:04] identification and I think that's
[3:06] something that we ought to be concerned
[3:08] about a brother had come to me uh after
[3:11] I did the first part of this Sunday
[3:12] school um and was just talking to me and
[3:14] mentioned something that really struck
[3:16] my heart in this matter you know there
[3:18] can be indifference in our lives when we
[3:21] go to church there can be different
[3:22] indifference in our life when you know
[3:25] towards a brother towards a sister we
[3:27] there can be indifference in our lives
[3:29] towards many things which is you know
[3:31] what a lot of my material is on but one
[3:34] thing that creeps into our lives is
[3:38] being indifferent towards our brother
[3:40] and our sister in in church or being
[3:43] indifferent towards our brother and
[3:44] sister when you know in our Natural
[3:48] Life um it's
[3:52] it's I found this quote when he when he
[3:55] was talking to me about that and I
[3:56] thought it just was striking he says in
[3:58] brother bom says in the commission 1958
[4:01] that's what the world is hungering for
[4:03] and that's the reason that the rest of
[4:05] the world isn't coming into the
[4:07] Pentecostal belief as we have it is
[4:09] because it's our own attitude towards
[4:13] one another that's truth Brethren it's
[4:15] because of our indifference towards each
[4:17] other they see one talking against the
[4:20] other one one against the other this
[4:21] against that and this denomination and
[4:23] they're scared of it you know and if
[4:26] Satan can't seem to get into your life
[4:28] and and you're reading the word or
[4:31] coming to church then he's going to try
[4:33] a different approach he's going to try a
[4:34] different avenue he'll start what he'll
[4:36] start doing is he'll start magnifying
[4:38] the flaws and the failures in another
[4:41] brother or in another sister's life but
[4:44] that's a trap and the Bible says that we
[4:46] need to know all of Satan's devices we
[4:48] need to know his tactics we need to know
[4:50] his tricks and you know if you if you
[4:53] become indifferent towards your brother
[4:55] or your sister by definition you're
[4:57] lacking concern for that person and
[5:00] you're doing the opposite of what the
[5:01] Bible teaches the Bible says to pray for
[5:04] one another if any Strife is among you
[5:06] fix it uplift one another amen 1
[5:09] Thessalonians 1 or 1 Thessalonians 5
[5:12] says wherefore Comfort yourselves
[5:16] together uh if you want to put it up 1
[5:18] Thessalonians
[5:19] 5:1 wherefore Comfort yourselves
[5:22] together and edify one another even as
[5:25] also ye do so edify one another that's
[5:28] what that's our commission and and we
[5:29] beseech you Brethren to know them which
[5:31] labor among you and are over you in the
[5:34] Lord and admonish you and to esteem them
[5:37] very highly in love for their work sake
[5:40] and be at peace among yourselves now we
[5:43] exhort you brother and warn them that
[5:45] are unruly Comfort the feeble-minded
[5:48] support the weak and be patient towards
[5:51] all men now that that's that's
[5:55] incredible that's an incredible
[5:56] statement we have to be patient towards
[5:58] every one of us you know we're not all
[6:00] at the same position in our Christian
[6:03] walk but God is trying to get us to that
[6:06] place we're all trying to get into our
[6:08] maturity Amen in into our into our place
[6:11] where God wants us amen and so we have
[6:13] to be patient towards all men and rather
[6:16] than when you see a brother fall when
[6:17] you see a sister fall pray for that
[6:19] person uplift that person if we you can
[6:22] find and I've got the longest list you
[6:24] can find a fa flaw or a failure in
[6:28] everybody and everybody has them and if
[6:30] you focus on those things then it takes
[6:33] you down a rabbit Trail but if you focus
[6:35] on the good things in their life you
[6:37] focus on where wow you know this brother
[6:40] this sister was at this point and now
[6:41] he's at this point blessed be the name
[6:43] of the Lord you uplift that c person you
[6:46] admonish that person you you encourage
[6:48] them and you be patient towards them and
[6:51] support it says support the weak Comfort
[6:54] the feeble-minded you know sometimes we
[6:56] all have times in our life where we feel
[6:58] weak or we feel feeble-minded but when
[7:01] someone and I this is just an example in
[7:03] my own life I was just you know in one
[7:06] of those mind battles in a day and just
[7:08] feeling discouraged and I got this text
[7:10] message from you know someone who just
[7:13] really en it was just an encouraging
[7:14] text message and just as little
[7:17] something as little as that someone
[7:18] admonishing someone Someone uplifting
[7:20] encouraging you that can really change
[7:22] the atmosphere in a situation so when
[7:24] you're going through something or when
[7:25] you have someone on your heart and even
[7:28] if you're just praying for them maybe
[7:30] you know reach out to him and say I'm
[7:31] praying for you God bless you you know
[7:33] it's such an encouraging thing to see in
[7:34] church those things matter those things
[7:37] are supporting the body
[7:39] amen so uh verse 15 says see that none
[7:43] render evil for evil unto any man but
[7:46] ever follow that which is good both
[7:49] among yourselves and to all men Rejoice
[7:53] ever more pray without ceasing in
[7:55] everything give thanks this is the will
[7:56] of God in Christ Jesus concerning you
[7:59] quench not the spirit despise not
[8:02] prophesyings and then it says prove all
[8:04] things and hold fast that which is good
[8:07] as abstain from all appearance of evil
[8:12] now God gave us lips he gave us words to
[8:15] speak those things were for creation he
[8:18] gave us those things to admonish one
[8:19] another to esteem one another to to
[8:22] glorify God that's what he gave us those
[8:23] things not to talk down about a brother
[8:25] not to find the flaw in their in their
[8:27] situation he gave us those things and if
[8:30] we see those things recognize recognize
[8:33] those things as evil excuse me recognize
[8:35] those things as evil prove it prove all
[8:38] things and hold fast to only that which
[8:40] is good if it doesn't agree and line up
[8:42] with this then lay it
[8:44] aside 2 Timothy 2 says this is a bible
[8:48] study this morning so 2 Timothy 25 and
[8:51] 16 says study to show thyself approved
[8:55] verses 15 and 16 study to show thyself
[8:58] approved un un to God a Workman that
[9:01] needeth not to be ashamed rightly
[9:02] dividing the word of Truth the next
[9:05] verse but shun profane and vain
[9:07] babblings for they will increase unto
[9:11] more ungodliness so the more you do
[9:13] something the more you talk about
[9:15] somebody the more the the more that
[9:16] it'll increase into more ungodliness you
[9:19] start having a good atmosphere God will
[9:22] start to feel welcome in that place and
[9:24] then it it'll good increases good but
[9:27] evil increases evil and that is an evil
[9:29] thing Ephesians
[9:32] 4:20 uh let's see Ephesians 4:29 I think
[9:35] is what I have if you want to go to that
[9:37] let no uh corrupt communication proceed
[9:41] out of your mouth uh go to 29 I'm sorry
[9:45] bro verse 29 let no corrupt
[9:48] communication proceed out out of your
[9:50] mouth but that which is good to the use
[9:54] of edifying that it may Minister Grace
[9:58] unto the hearers now if you keep this at
[10:00] the Forefront of your mind anytime that
[10:02] you are talking with somebody or about
[10:05] somebody think about it and say is this
[10:07] ministering Grace unto those that are
[10:10] hearing this is it is it ministering
[10:12] Grace to them is it going to is it going
[10:14] to bring them closer to to Jesus is it
[10:17] going to glorify God in any way and if
[10:19] it's not then shun the very appearance
[10:21] of it James 4 says uh James 4:7 submit
[10:26] yourselves therefore to God resist the
[10:30] devil and he will flee from you draw
[10:32] nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you
[10:34] cleanse your hands ye sinner uh cleanse
[10:36] your hands Sinners purify your hearts
[10:38] you double-minded be afflicted and mourn
[10:41] weep let your laughter turn to mourning
[10:42] your joy to heaviness humble yourselves
[10:45] in the sight of the Lord he shall lift
[10:46] you up and speak not evil one of another
[10:50] Brethren he that speaketh evil of his
[10:52] brother and judges his brother speaketh
[10:55] evil of the law and judges the law but
[10:58] if thou judge the law Thou Art not a
[11:00] doer of the law but a judge Hebrews
[11:04] 10:22 says let us draw near with a True
[11:07] Heart in full Assurance of Faith having
[11:11] our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[11:13] conscience and our bodies washed with
[11:15] pure water let us hold fast the
[11:17] profession of our faith without ra
[11:19] wavering for he is faithful that
[11:21] promised and let us consider one another
[11:25] to provoke unto love and to good works
[11:28] so
[11:29] you think of provocation you think of
[11:31] provoking someone to do wrong but the
[11:33] Bible says to provoke them unto love to
[11:36] provoke them unto doing good
[11:39] works and we're going to get a little uh
[11:42] you know more in depth in this in a few
[11:44] minutes but you know it's a gradual
[11:46] process that you can begin to take you
[11:48] know if you have a thought against a
[11:50] brother or sister this opening one of
[11:52] the opening scriptures is you are to
[11:54] take everything cap every single thought
[11:58] captive in the name name of Jesus Christ
[12:00] confess that it's not your thought the
[12:02] Holy Spirit brother brother Jason
[12:03] preached on that the holy spirit will
[12:05] take care of that thing but if you don't
[12:08] if you don't then you begin tolerating
[12:11] that thought and that eventually leads
[12:13] into embracing that thought I'm going to
[12:15] we'll quote this probably the next
[12:16] Sunday school but John Wesley says one
[12:18] generation's Toleration leads to another
[12:21] embrac another generation's embracing it
[12:23] and now that can happen in your own life
[12:25] in your own thought process you you
[12:27] begin to tolerate something and then
[12:29] eventually then more things more
[12:32] thoughts then you begin to embrace it
[12:34] then by embracing it out of the Mind
[12:37] speaketh what is in the heart amen so
[12:38] then you begin to speak whatever is in
[12:40] your mind towards that person and it all
[12:43] began to not be because you didn't take
[12:44] that thing captive you didn't you
[12:46] weren't in obedience to the
[12:51] word I have this note in here for it
[12:54] says it says for young people but
[12:56] everybody in here don't we can't fall in
[12:59] into that trap you know you hear you
[13:01] hear someone being talked about in a
[13:04] negative way display Christ in that
[13:07] situation don't focus on flaws or the
[13:11] mistakes or you know or something in a
[13:13] negative way encourage encourage them
[13:16] build them up build the character up you
[13:18] know like I was saying it's easy to find
[13:21] faults it's easy to find failures in
[13:23] people we've all got them but greater is
[13:25] he that is in me than is he that is in
[13:27] the world Amen and we're were to look
[13:30] past the Fallen nature were to look past
[13:32] that Fallen condition and not Embrace
[13:34] young people you know especially if you
[13:37] know you just hear you hear conversation
[13:39] you hear someone being talked about shun
[13:41] the very appearance of it don't you be
[13:43] be Christ in that situation you know
[13:45] Express express some find something
[13:48] encouraging to say about that person and
[13:50] then shun the very appearance of
[13:52] evil you know um the
[13:55] Bible says being in one mind and one
[13:58] Accord and it says that a lot and it's
[14:00] something for the entire body of
[14:03] Believers old and young
[14:06] alike um with with just the little time
[14:10] that we have on Earth uh I don't believe
[14:12] God intended for us to spend any of that
[14:15] time tearing one another down or
[14:17] gossiping or talking negatively towards
[14:19] your brother or your sister I think that
[14:21] there's so many scriptures and we're
[14:24] going to go through some of these
[14:25] scriptures kind of kind of fast here but
[14:27] so many of these scriptures are are
[14:29] talking about unity in the faith and
[14:31] being in one mind and being in one
[14:33] Accord um You probably won't follow me
[14:36] with this Caleb because I'm going to go
[14:38] kind of quick but 1 Corinthians 12:12
[14:41] says for as the body is one and hath
[14:43] many members and all the members of that
[14:45] one body being many are one body so also
[14:49] is Christ for by one Spirit we are all
[14:51] baptized into one body whether we be
[14:54] Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or
[14:56] free and have been all made to drink and
[14:59] one spirit for the body is not one
[15:01] member but many amen skipping down to
[15:04] verse 18 it says but now hath God set
[15:07] the members everyone in that body as it
[15:09] has pleased him and if they were all one
[15:11] member where were the body but now they
[15:14] are all members yet one body and the eye
[15:16] cannot say un the hand I have no need of
[15:18] thee nor again to the feet I have no
[15:20] need of thee nay much more of these
[15:22] members of the body which seem to be
[15:24] more feeble are necessary and those
[15:26] members of the body which we think to be
[15:28] less hon honorable upon these we bestow
[15:31] a more abundant honor and our uncomely
[15:33] parts are have more abundant cless for
[15:36] our comely Parts have no need but God
[15:38] hath tempered the body together having
[15:40] given more abundant honor to that part
[15:43] which lacked that there should be excuse
[15:46] me no Schism in the body but that the
[15:49] members should have the same care one
[15:53] for another and whether one member
[15:55] suffer all members suffer or whether one
[15:58] member be honored all the members
[16:00] Rejoice with it now we are the body of
[16:02] Christ and members in particular we are
[16:05] the body one Unity amen we're talking
[16:08] about Unity right now I'm going to go
[16:10] through some of these kind of fast but
[16:11] he looks like he's following along great
[16:13] so Galatians 3:28 says there is neither
[16:16] Jew nor Greek there is neither Bond nor
[16:18] free th there is neither male nor female
[16:21] for ye are all one in Christ Jesus amen
[16:25] Philippians 22-3 says fulfill ye my joy
[16:29] that you be likeminded having the same
[16:32] love being of one mind and one Accord
[16:35] let nothing be done through Strife or
[16:38] vain Glory but in lowliness of Mind Let
[16:42] each esteem other better than themselves
[16:46] look not every man on his own things but
[16:48] every man also on the things of others
[16:50] and let this mind be in you which was
[16:52] also in Christ I I love that scripture
[16:55] it says in loneliness of Mind esteem
[16:59] your brother esteem your sister higher
[17:02] than yourself they may be going through
[17:04] a struggle in their life they may be
[17:05] going through something in their life
[17:07] esteem them higher than yourself pray
[17:09] for that person encourage that person
[17:12] you know where where do where do it
[17:14] where to be a part of one body amen and
[17:18] then let this mind that's how you let
[17:20] the mind of Christ be in you you apply
[17:24] these scriptures Romans
[17:26] 14:19 let us therefore follow after the
[17:29] things which make for peace and things
[17:31] wherewith one may edify another
[17:34] Colossians 3:13 says forbearing one
[17:37] another and forgiving one another If any
[17:39] man have a quarrel against any even as
[17:42] Christ forgave you so also do ye and I
[17:45] like to read this one in the Amplified
[17:47] that Colossians
[17:48] 3:13 be bearing graciously with one
[17:52] another and willingly forgiving each
[17:56] other if one has a cause for complaint
[17:59] against another just as the Lord has
[18:02] forgiven you so should you forgive so
[18:05] graciously forgive that person and
[18:08] willingly forgive sometimes you come to
[18:10] come to a situation and you know we're
[18:12] going to forgive but are we going to
[18:13] willingly forgive that person are we
[18:15] going to graciously do it and then if
[18:17] you have a complaint against that person
[18:20] just as the Lord forgave you forgive
[18:23] that person and then this last scripture
[18:27] here says Psalms Psalms 133 says behold
[18:31] how good and how pleasant it is for
[18:34] brothers to dwell in
[18:36] unity it is like Precious oil of
[18:39] consecration poured on the head coming
[18:42] down on the beer even the beard of Aaron
[18:45] this is the Amplified version even of
[18:47] beard coming even the beard of Aaron
[18:50] coming down upon the edge of his
[18:51] Priestly robes consecrating the whole
[18:53] body it is like the Dew of Mount Herman
[18:56] coming down on the hills of Zion for
[18:59] there the Lord has Comm commanded the
[19:02] blessing life forever more and I'm just
[19:06] kind of running out of time here but you
[19:09] know brother Jason always has that
[19:12] saying you know we're all all for one
[19:14] and and one for all you know we are to
[19:17] recognize the enemy in every one of his
[19:20] tactics and many times in our life he's
[19:23] not going to get us in a certain way so
[19:26] he's going to try every single other way
[19:28] to to try to get you that's just that's
[19:30] what the devil is he's Relentless he's
[19:32] out to kill you he's out to steal your
[19:34] life he's out to destroy you he's out to
[19:36] bring Schism in the body he's out to
[19:38] he's out to recognize people's flaws I
[19:41] mean that we we spent a lot of time on
[19:44] that but he's going to magnify those
[19:47] things and what are we to do we are to
[19:48] take every single thought captive in the
[19:52] name of Jesus Christ and if it doesn't
[19:54] admonish someone if it doesn't encourage
[19:57] and uplift now there's corre it the
[19:59] Bible says there is a place for
[20:01] correction this is the house of
[20:02] correction and it says if you have a
[20:04] quarrel against your brother go to that
[20:06] person and make it known under that
[20:08] person and if they're a brother or if
[20:10] they're a sister then that will make it
[20:13] right the Lord in you and the Lord in
[20:15] them will recognize that one of us may
[20:18] be wrong in this situation and then
[20:19] you're going to pray about it but
[20:22] besides that all of the negativity the
[20:24] negativity that can creep into our lives
[20:26] just recognize that that is a tactic of
[20:28] the enemy and that he's trying to cause
[20:30] schisms in the body he's trying to get
[20:33] into the church in every way in every
[20:35] shape and every form but if we can and I
[20:38] talked on this last time if all of the
[20:41] of the thought processes that we think
[20:43] we think 50 to 70,000 thoughts a day of
[20:46] all of those thoughts I know that we're
[20:48] constantly having to battle mind battles
[20:50] it's the greatest battle ever fought and
[20:52] we're constantly having to bring things
[20:54] into subjection to the Holy Ghost and
[20:56] bringing things into subjection what I'm
[20:58] looking looking at right here among all
[21:00] of you is a bunch of soldiers who are
[21:02] having to fight daily before you even
[21:04] come to church before before I even know
[21:06] the Mind battles that you're having
[21:08] you're having those mind battles and so
[21:10] you're a soldier and you're having to
[21:11] constantly put things into subjection in
[21:14] your mind so what I what my
[21:16] encouragement to you is wield The Sword
[21:18] and recognize that if that thought
[21:20] doesn't line up with the word if that
[21:22] thought doesn't admonish a brother if
[21:24] that thought isn't going to edify one
[21:27] another then cast sit down in the name
[21:29] of Jesus and encourage one another
[21:32] encourage yourself in the Lord and
[21:34] continue to press on Amen Let's uh let's
[21:37] just bow our heads Heavenly Father we
[21:40] just want to thank you for this time
[21:42] together father I just pray that you
[21:44] would be with the remainder of the
[21:45] service Lord God just the most important
[21:47] part here coming shortly father just the
[21:49] ministering of your word I pray that
[21:51] you'd Lord anoint the speaker anoint the
[21:53] hear father be with the musicians Lord
[21:55] May everything be done today to glorify
[21:57] you we love you now and ask it all in
[21:59] the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless
[22:02] you
