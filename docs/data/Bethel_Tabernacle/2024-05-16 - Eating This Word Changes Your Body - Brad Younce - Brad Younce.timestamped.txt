[48:18] on the upper doors of the houses wherein
[48:20] they shall eat it may God add a blessing
[48:23] to the reion have your seats for a title
[48:26] this evening I want to speak on eating
[48:29] this word changes your
[48:32] body this scripture we was reading right
[48:34] here is the first communion because
[48:37] brother R said in communion communion
[48:39] was held first way down in Egypt the
[48:42] first of the communion which was the
[48:44] Passover Lamb that was slain which was a
[48:46] type of Christ and when they come out
[48:49] there wasn't a feeble one among them and
[48:52] there even their clothes was not even
[48:54] threadbear for 40 years God had kept
[48:57] them and in taking of the communion was
[49:00] a difference between life and death and
[49:03] those who were on the inside under the
[49:04] shed blood took the communion and no one
[49:07] could take the communion outside being
[49:09] under the shed blood the blood of the
[49:12] Lamb was shed first then was put on the
[49:15] lentil and on the doorpost and on the
[49:18] doorpost and the lamb was roasted and
[49:20] was eaten with bitter herbs and they GED
[49:22] themselves after the blood was shed they
[49:26] had passed pass under the shed blood
[49:28] they were girded and ready for the March
[49:31] they must come under the blood first and
[49:33] be cleansed from all sin which is
[49:36] unbelief and then be shod with the
[49:38] preparation of the Gospel having on the
[49:40] whole armor of God ready for the summons
[49:43] at any time and it was a sign that the
[49:47] death angel could not go beneath the
[49:49] blood the death angel had to rise and go
[49:52] over the blood and there is where the PO
[49:55] got the inspiration when I see the blood
[49:58] I'll pass over you eating changing your
[50:01] body you know we're living in an age
[50:04] where all people talks about you'll go

[51:48] be
[51:50] amen
[51:52] hallelujah on you still love me right
[51:56] all right you know we've heard brother
[51:58] Jason been preaching brother Matt's
[51:59] mentioned it last time he was up here
[52:02] that the most important thing here are
[52:04] young people is getting the Holy Ghost
[52:08] amen we said it you've heard it I just
[52:11] said it again the most important thing
[52:12] you're receiving the Holy Ghost it is
[52:14] vital after you receive the Holy Ghost
[52:17] it is vital to be feeding on this word
[52:20] by your diet you're known what you feed
[52:24] on is who you are if you you feed on the
[52:27] world then what do you become the world
[52:30] but if you feed on God what do you
[52:32] become you become little Gods you know
[52:35] the children of Israel had G down in
[52:36] Egypt we all we all know the story we
[52:38] ain't got time to go into that how they
[52:40] come down and sojourned for 400 years
[52:43] and Moses came down on the scene to to
[52:45] draw them out Moses went in the
[52:46] wilderness for 40 years come back and
[52:49] started doing all these plagues upon
[52:51] Egypt God say I'm going to have my glory
[52:53] on on Pharaoh so he had all these
[52:55] plagues and the last one was going to be
[52:58] death so we'll skip a little bit you
[53:00] like
[53:01] that you know the story of all this
[53:03] stuff we're not we ain't got time to go
[53:05] into
[53:06] it but in Exodus 12:1 the Lord spake
[53:09] unto Moses I want you GA the people and
[53:11] I want you tell the people this in the
[53:13] land of East saying this month shall be
[53:15] unto you the beginning of months it
[53:18] shall be the first month of the year to
[53:20] you you know which is about the middle
[53:23] of March and April is our is in our in
[53:26] our calendar before it was in the middle
[53:28] of September and October being their
[53:30] first month he said I want the middle of
[53:33] March to be the start of the new year
[53:35] that's the month of the crucifixion of
[53:37] Jesus and the resurrection so he says
[53:39] speak ye into the congregation of Israel
[53:42] saying in the 10th day of the month they
[53:44] shall take to them every man a lamb
[53:48] according to the house of the fathers a
[53:50] lamb for a house it was one lamb for a
[53:54] house he didn't say go out there and get
[53:57] you two
[53:58] Lambs or three Lambs he says get you one
[54:01] lamb the father was to bring the lamb
[54:04] into their house it was to become part
[54:06] of the
[54:07] family so that when it was time for a
[54:10] sacrifice it would be a greater
[54:11] sacrifice for them to sacrifice a part
[54:14] of the family they brought that lamb in
[54:17] no doubt the kids named him whatever you
[54:19] would name a lamb this little lamb had a
[54:22] name it become part of the family and by
[54:26] the time was sacrificed on the 14th day
[54:28] it was cherished and then it was mourned
[54:31] God wanted the sacrifice of something
[54:33] precious that's the what Jesus was Jesus
[54:35] was part of the family the father had
[54:38] set him aside for service Jesus entered
[54:40] Jerusalem four days before he was to be
[54:42] crucified to be set aside for the
[54:45] service Exodus 12:4 and if the household
[54:47] would be too little for the lamb let him
[54:49] and his neighbor next unto his house
[54:52] take it according to the number of souls
[54:55] every man according into his eating
[54:57] shall make your count for the lamb the
[55:00] law required that at least 10 people for
[55:03] each Pascal lamb but I thank God that
[55:06] this the lamb Jesus was enough for
[55:11] everybody your lamb should be without
[55:15] blemish a male of the first year you
[55:17] shall take it from the sheep or from the
[55:20] goats we had to have a lamb for this day
[55:23] we had to have a lamb without blemish we
[55:25] had a lamb that was virgin
[55:28] born God's was God's greatest gift to
[55:31] this earth that land slain back in in
[55:34] Exodus at one year old was in the prime
[55:37] of his life when Jesus was slain he was
[55:39] in the prime of his life look at the
[55:43] parallel the 14th day of the same month
[55:45] and the whole assembly of congregation
[55:47] shall kill it in the
[55:50] evening this slain lamb of Exodus 12
[55:53] represents the slain lamb at Calvary
[55:56] so on the 14th day of the month Jesus
[55:59] was brought before pilate's Hall this
[56:02] lamb was slain about the same time that
[56:05] Jesus died in the afternoon around
[56:09] 3:00 they were slain on the same day
[56:11] they took Jesus into into Pilot's Hall
[56:14] and smoted him and beat him with whips
[56:17] and chunks of Flesh come off his
[56:21] body he stood there a perfect sacrifice
[56:24] but not a word was said
[56:26] not a word did he
[56:29] utter I could I could see him sit there
[56:32] and take those beatings and he had that
[56:33] far away look in his
[56:36] eyes if they could ask him what are you
[56:38] looking at
[56:39] Jesus why ain't you saying a word and
[56:41] why he was taking those beatings he was
[56:44] looking ahead in time and he was seeing
[56:46] bethl
[56:47] Tabernacle he says I'm taking all of
[56:50] this for you the slain lamb for
[56:54] you we heard you know we heard that
[56:56] saying you know when Jesus took that
[56:58] last breath and cried it is finished the
[57:02] saying Heaven is just a breath away this
[57:05] is when that saying came to pass Jesus
[57:08] took that last breath and when he
[57:13] died Heaven become just a breath away
[57:16] cuz once before we could get to him
[57:19] there was no bridge but when he died
[57:21] there was a bridge that we could access
[57:24] heaven heaven is on only a breath away
[57:28] he represented the lamb that was slain
[57:29] in a garden for Adam and
[57:33] Eve it's getting hot up
[57:39] here when she fell to the lies the
[57:42] devil if we believe a lie of the devil
[57:45] death sets in on us that's what happened
[57:47] to to Adam and Eve when they believe the
[57:49] lie of the devil death set in on
[57:52] them Exodus 12:7 they shall take the
[57:55] blood and strike it on two side posts
[57:58] and on the upper doorpost of the houses
[58:01] wherein they shall eat they were to
[58:03] strike that door they got this hup they
[58:07] dipped it in the blood and went over and
[58:08] painted the
[58:11] door I don't know how much they put on
[58:13] it but it was it better have been
[58:15] enough I can see that that boy the
[58:19] oldest son father are you sure the
[58:21] blood's there and the father would come
[58:23] around and look up there says yeah it's
[58:25] right there do you think it's
[58:28] enough it's enough son just one drop of
[58:32] Jesus Christ will take away the sin of
[58:34] the
[58:36] world but they couldn't eat that lamb
[58:39] until they applied the blood to the
[58:41] doorpost
[58:42] first even if they did roast a lamb they
[58:46] could have went in our house and cooked
[58:47] it roast it like Moses said but if they
[58:50] didn't put the blood on the door that
[58:52] Death Angel could still walk right in
[58:55] fathers that's why we need to do to our
[58:57] homes we need to put the blood over our
[58:59] doorpost and say devil you're not
[59:01] welcome here if you got a Lost Child a
[59:06] lost loved one a husband or a wife or a
[59:08] family member just apply the blood over
[59:10] their
[59:11] door the devil's not allowed in
[59:14] there apply the token we can eat this
[59:18] word and gain a head
[59:20] knowledge but if we don't apply the
[59:22] blood to our lives and get Washed by the
[59:25] blood we will perish like the rest of
[59:27] the
[59:28] world we can't truly eat this word until

[1:09:19] feasting we're not
[1:09:21] cannibals but we're feasting on the body
[1:09:24] word of the son of man cuz Jesus says in
[1:09:26] John chap 6 verse this is important John
[1:09:29] 6:47 says verily verily I say unto you
[1:09:33] he that believeth on me hath everlasting
[1:09:37] life amen I am the bread of life your
[1:09:42] fathers did eat the the man in the
[1:09:43] wilderness but are
[1:09:46] dead this is the bread which cometh down
[1:09:49] from heaven that a man may eat thereof
[1:09:51] and not die
[1:09:56] I am the living bread which come down
[1:09:58] from heaven If any man eat of this bread
[1:10:02] he shall live
[1:10:04] forever this ain't Sarah Lee this ain't
[1:10:08] Ezekiel this is
[1:10:12] Christ and the bread that I will give
[1:10:15] them is my flesh which I will give for
[1:10:18] the life of the
[1:10:21] world the Jews therefore strove among
[1:10:24] themselves saying how how can this man
[1:10:26] give us flesh to eat and then Jesus said
[1:10:28] to them said verily verily I say unto
[1:10:30] you except ye eat the Flesh of the son
[1:10:34] of man and drink his blood you have no
[1:10:37] life in you
[1:10:41] amen whosoever eateth My Flesh and
[1:10:45] drinketh my blood haveth eternal life
[1:10:50] there's the key if you don't eat it you
[1:10:53] ain't got eternal life it's just a
[1:10:55] simple as
[1:10:57] that but whosoever eateth my flesh and
[1:11:00] drinketh my blood hath eternal life and
[1:11:03] I will raise him up in the last days for
[1:11:07] my flesh is meat in my flesh is meat
[1:11:10] indeed and my blood is drink indeed so
[1:11:14] he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[1:11:17] blood dwelleth in me and I in
[1:11:22] him Hallelujah
[1:11:25] as a father has sent me I live in a
[1:11:27] father so he that eateth me even he
[1:11:29] shall live by me this is that bread
[1:11:33] which came down from
[1:11:34] heaven your followers eat they are dead
[1:11:37] B said except ye he backs this up he
[1:11:40] says except you eat the Flesh of the son
[1:11:42] of man what do you think of a doctor
[1:11:43] would have thought if he had been
[1:11:46] sitting in there what do you think of a
[1:11:47] man would just come and thinking you
[1:11:50] have to eat my flesh and drink my blood
[1:11:52] they say this man is nothing but a
[1:11:54] vampire he's not a minister stay away
[1:11:56] from that man he's crazy stay away from
[1:11:58] him but it was the truth it was the
[1:12:02] truth except you eat it you'll
[1:12:08] perish you'll all die if you don't eat
[1:12:12] it he said the bread and wine is only a
[1:12:15] symbol don't let that natural thing get
[1:12:17] you down you got to eat
[1:12:22] Christ which is the word that you live
[1:12:24] by every word that proceeds out of the
[1:12:27] mouth of God from The Book of Genesis to
[1:12:31] the Book of Revelation every
[1:12:34] word the son of man is Christ first is
[1:12:37] false anointed ones or this is the
[1:12:38] anointed ones of the end time the son of
[1:12:40] man is Christ he is the one that you're
[1:12:43] feeding on you're not feeding on no
[1:12:46] man his words will fail but you're
[1:12:49] feeding on the unfailing body
[1:12:53] word these says in Exodus 12 again and
[1:12:57] thus shall ye eat with your loins girded
[1:13:00] your shoes on your feet your staff in
[1:13:02] your hand and you shall eat it in haste
[1:13:07] right you ain't got time to put your
[1:13:10] little bib on and eat
[1:13:13] slow I've worked at the hospital some of
[1:13:15] you people works in the hospitals you
[1:13:16] know how it is they say you get 30
[1:13:18] minutes for lunch but a lot of times you
[1:13:20] don't and so you all you
[1:13:23] do you're done
[1:13:25] and I still eat that way 14 years of
[1:13:28] training I still eat
[1:13:30] fast eat it in
[1:13:34] haste your staff in your hand you got to
[1:13:37] be ready you got to have your shoes on
[1:13:39] your feet you got to have your spear up
[1:13:42] you got to have your shield on ready to
[1:13:44] go because at any minute the death angel
[1:13:48] is going to pass
[1:13:51] over any minute the Rapture is going to
[1:13:54] take place any minute you got to be
[1:13:58] ready to
[1:14:01] go so what I would do if I was you I'd
[1:14:05] start eating this stuff in
[1:14:08] haste get every word of it you can
[1:14:11] because the more you eat it changes your
[1:14:16] body where before you're
[1:14:19] old all of a sudden you're a young man
[1:14:21] again a young woman because of what you
[1:14:24] eating
[1:14:27] it's the same today as it was in Egypt
[1:14:28] when they ate the lamb they were dressed
[1:14:30] to leave and that's the bride we're
[1:14:33] making ourselves ready we're putting on
[1:14:36] our helmet we're ready to
[1:14:39] go you're eating this words you can
[1:14:41] watch your body change before your very
[1:14:45] eyes you get up in the morning look in
[1:14:47] the
[1:14:48] mirror and where you didn't have any
[1:14:51] hair stuff starts growing
[1:14:55] you're watching yourself change before
[1:14:57] your very eyes your feet Shaw with the
[1:15:00] preparation of gospel peace above all
[1:15:02] take the shield of Faith wherewith you
[1:15:04] shall be able to quench all the fiery
[1:15:06] darts of the wicked and take th helmet
[1:15:08] of salvation and the sword of the spirit
[1:15:11] which is the word of
[1:15:13] God says when you see the church going
[1:15:16] in this great exus it's the pillar of
[1:15:18] fire leading before us standing and
[1:15:22] Performing Miracles and signs he is here
[1:15:25] tonight in all his redeeming power he is
[1:15:29] here to make whole every sinner to take
[1:15:32] back every backslider he is here to heal
[1:15:36] every sick
[1:15:39] person every sick person he is the Full
[1:15:44] Gospel and we preach the Full Gospel eat
[1:15:48] the whole lamb roasted with the Holy
[1:15:51] Ghost and know that it's good eating
[1:15:57] for the Holy Spirit has divined us that
[1:16:00] it is real good taste and see the Lord
[1:16:04] is good it tastes like honey on the
[1:16:08] Rock our he says our lord Jesus here in
[1:16:11] his love and Power in his great
[1:16:14] Redemptive blessings and he stands
[1:16:16] between the church and sin tonight and
[1:16:18] he stands between you and judgment
[1:16:21] bleeding and praying
[1:16:26] wow But first you got to apply the blood
[1:16:29] you got to get Sanctified you got to
[1:16:30] clean out your
[1:16:32] house you got to get rid of the sin the
[1:16:34] leaven bread get it out of your house
[1:16:37] get your shoes on get dressed for the
[1:16:40] journey start eating this word when
[1:16:44] Israel ate that lamb not one feeble
[1:16:46] person was among
[1:16:48] them say these Jews they come up each
[1:16:50] year and there was a fountain inside the
[1:16:52] church and they taken the bread and the
[1:16:54] bitter herbs than the lamb and they
[1:16:56] drank it from this fountain in the
[1:16:58] church and they rejoiced together
[1:17:00] because that God had showed them favor
[1:17:03] amen so this being the time the Passover
[1:17:06] Not only was it the Passover it was a
[1:17:08] special one there was
[1:17:11] something there's sometimes that we go
[1:17:14] to church and we all love
[1:17:20] to we all love
[1:17:23] to but there's something times that
[1:17:25] something special
[1:17:29] happens you know what I'm talking about
[1:17:31] there just some service that something
[1:17:34] special just
[1:17:35] happens and this was one of those times
[1:17:39] the air was charged with
[1:17:41] expectancy Moses had gave him the word
[1:17:45] Moses told him you apply the token then
[1:17:47] when you get the Holy Ghost you start
[1:17:49] eating and feeding on this lamb they're
[1:17:51] expecting something because he says a
[1:17:53] death angel is going to pass pass over
[1:17:55] and that Pharaoh is going to say get
[1:17:58] out they were expecting something are
[1:18:02] you is there expectancy in the air this
[1:18:04] evening are we expecting something to
[1:18:06] happen
[1:18:09] right if you're looking for it he'll
[1:18:11] come to
[1:18:13] you we're expecting the exit once again
[1:18:17] so you got to eat this word not just
[1:18:19] part of it
[1:18:25] when you eat this word it don't matter
[1:18:27] if your favorite football team
[1:18:32] loses what a lot of amens on that
[1:18:35] one it don't
[1:18:38] matter the petty little things don't
[1:18:41] matter
[1:18:43] oh she bought a dress just like me I got
[1:18:47] to take it
[1:18:49] back things don't matter
[1:18:55] Israel was commanded to take a lamb and
[1:18:56] kill it and put the blood over the door
[1:18:59] and every family go in and eat that
[1:19:02] lamb Fellowship around the roasted
[1:19:06] lamb that's what we're doing this
[1:19:08] evening we're having Fellowship around
[1:19:10] the roasted
[1:19:12] lamb eat the body of the Dead sacrifice
[1:19:16] that died in their stead God says when I
[1:19:20] see the blood I'll pass over you the
[1:19:23] death angel could not touch the him
[1:19:25] because the blood of the Lamb was over
[1:19:27] the door and they were in in there
[1:19:30] having
[1:19:31] communion fellowshiping around the
[1:19:35] lamb
[1:19:36] Hallelujah that's the way it is in our
[1:19:38] heart when we apply the
[1:19:41] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ he takes
[1:19:44] away all our sins and then we can have
[1:19:47] fellowship and eatting the word of God
[1:19:50] around the table of God fellowshipping
[1:19:53] upon Godly things in the Physical Realm
[1:19:56] that if you're just eat a little
[1:19:58] bit that's all you can eat you know some
[1:20:02] people going to eat just a little bit
[1:20:04] cuz stomach stomach's so small but if
[1:20:05] you want to get a bigger stomach start
[1:20:07] eating
[1:20:09] more if you got a spiritual small
[1:20:11] stomach tonight go ahead and start
[1:20:14] eating you'll find that belly start
[1:20:16] getting big and you just keep eating
[1:20:19] more and more until your stomach swells
[1:20:21] larger and
[1:20:23] larger and he says I'm telling you what
[1:20:25] the church needs today I got this in big
[1:20:28] bold letters so I won't miss it what the
[1:20:31] church needs today is a good
[1:20:33] oldfashioned spiritual gastronomic
[1:20:40] Jubilee it's exactly what we
[1:20:44] need is to eat on the word of God until
[1:20:47] we just crowd out the world crowd out
[1:20:51] everything and stick the word of God in
[1:20:54] there and live by
[1:20:58] it what you eat today won't help you
[1:21:04] tomorrow so the hamburger you ate this
[1:21:06] afternoon you will probably have to go
[1:21:08] home after church and have another
[1:21:12] one oh that's what we
[1:21:16] had tomorrow morning you'll have to get
[1:21:18] up and make you some eggs and bacon to
[1:21:20] go through the
[1:21:21] day so what today it ain't going to help
[1:21:25] tomorrow you need food every day that's
[1:21:29] way it is with this what we're eating
[1:21:31] today we're going to need something else
[1:21:32] tomorrow something else Friday something
[1:21:35] else on Saturday we need to keep eating
[1:21:39] you just can't eat one time and say well
[1:21:41] I'm good for the
[1:21:43] week well I went to church on Sunday I
[1:21:46] think I I can make it till next Sunday I
[1:21:48] don't need to go
[1:21:49] Wednesday that was
[1:21:52] free the Holy Spirit feeds on the
[1:21:56] word that's what Jesus says man shall
[1:21:59] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:22:01] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[1:22:03] God that's what the matter one of these
[1:22:06] things today that makes the church in
[1:22:08] his anemic
[1:22:11] condition is because it doesn't take
[1:22:13] time to feed on the word the church is
[1:22:18] hungry he said if I was a doctor a great
[1:22:20] big Stout looking man come in here said
[1:22:22] sir I'm sick well what are your sin
[1:22:25] symptoms I'm so weak I can't hardly pick
[1:22:28] my hands
[1:22:30] up that's the way sometimes we come to
[1:22:32] church we'll come to church we're so
[1:22:35] weak
[1:22:36] because we haven't had time to read and
[1:22:39] pray and eat the word like we want to
[1:22:41] and our hands are just so weak we can't
[1:22:43] get them the preacher says come on lift
[1:22:45] your hands up let's worship God and
[1:22:47] yours this is all you got we're so weak
[1:22:49] we can't go no
[1:22:51] further I'm so weak I can't hardly pick
[1:22:54] up my hands I'll would say what are the
[1:22:56] few physical
[1:22:58] conditions I would say well sir have you
[1:23:01] been eating regular on oh I had a half a
[1:23:05] cracker day before
[1:23:08] yesterday well he said you're just
[1:23:11] hungry you need strength you need to eat
[1:23:15] amen I'm just going to tell you what you
[1:23:17] need to do right now if you feel weak
[1:23:19] spiritually all you need to do is eat
[1:23:28] that's what the matter with the church
[1:23:30] just read a scripture one little verse
[1:23:32] on Sunday morning and we ought to have
[1:23:34] our head in the word every minute we
[1:23:37] have to spare God help us God I say God
[1:23:42] help us every minute that we have to
[1:23:49] spare wonder how many likes I had on
[1:23:51] that picture I
[1:23:53] posted 35 I've got 750 people following
[1:23:59] me I bet you open up that bible app over
[1:24:02] there in the beginning was the word and
[1:24:05] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:24:08] God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:24:10] dwell among
[1:24:12] us
[1:24:14] hallelujah we ought to have our head in
[1:24:17] his word every minute we have to
[1:24:21] spare take a lot of times and lay
[1:24:24] something else's side and read that
[1:24:29] word he says again man shall not live by
[1:24:33] bread
[1:24:34] alone but by every word that proceeds
[1:24:37] out of the mouth of
[1:24:39] God but our Delight should be in the
[1:24:41] Lord to meditate on God's word day and
[1:24:44] night as it says in Psalms
[1:24:46] 1 but we can't keep the
[1:24:49] victory because of what we're feeding
[1:24:52] on if we feed on the word and the things
[1:24:55] of the world will never be Victorious
[1:24:58] and you wonder why you can't overcome
[1:25:00] things in your life is because you're
[1:25:01] feeding on the wrong
[1:25:03] thing

[1:27:16] want to associate with that but you're
[1:27:17] getting on Dangerous Ground right then

[1:32:37] eat we can't Feast on the things of the
[1:32:39] world expect our bodies to change for
[1:32:43] flight our bodies that we live in isn't
[1:32:46] up to the
[1:32:47] task that's like the caterpillar there's
[1:32:50] no way he's going to be able to fly with
[1:32:53] all these little
[1:32:55] legs can't fly with legs he's
[1:32:58] Earthbound but what he has to do he has
[1:33:01] to keep
[1:33:02] eating our
[1:33:04] bodies this body we live in can't live
[1:33:07] up to the task we can't produce the
[1:33:10] change that we need but there's got to
[1:33:12] be a change from the inside out as a
[1:33:16] caterpillar is eating to bring forth
[1:33:18] what's inside of him that's what we're
[1:33:20] doing we're keep eating to bring forth

[1:33:52] while they've eating ourselves into
[1:33:54] something all of a

[1:44:28] last couple days um just done some
[1:44:31] things for me nothing seemed kind of
[1:44:34] small but it just really touched my
[1:44:35] heart um uh I think it was Monday I was
[1:44:39] doing some work under a house in a real
[1:44:41] Sandy crawl space and um I get out of
[1:44:44] the crawl space and realize my phone's
[1:44:45] out of my pocket and it's somewhere
[1:44:48] under a house
[1:44:50] somewhere and um so I'm kind of
[1:44:53] panicking you know going under there
[1:44:55] with a flashlight looking can't find it
[1:44:57] trying to call it on a different phone
[1:44:59] see if the screen will light up because
[1:45:00] it's course is on silent so you can't
[1:45:02] hear can't hear it and I'm like man I I
[1:45:05] can't afford a new phone right now this
[1:45:06] is really not not good and I'm trying to
[1:45:10] retrace my my steps and I finally just
[1:45:13] kind of sat down in the house and said
[1:45:15] Lord I I I got to find this phone I I
[1:45:18] have to find it you know please I you
[1:45:20] could help me and i' about that time I'd
[1:45:23] like well I don't know maybe I just left
[1:45:24] it on the truck and I and I just didn't
[1:45:26] see it and I'm turning to go and
[1:45:29] something says just turn around one more
[1:45:30] time and I turn around and my flashlight
[1:45:32] hit it dead on and I it was buried in
[1:45:35] sand you couldn't see it oh you barely
[1:45:37] see the end sticking out of the out of
[1:45:38] the dirt wow and um so I really
[1:45:40] appreciate that and then again this
[1:45:43] morning I had a tool that I use all the
[1:45:45] time and a little part of it that's kind
[1:45:48] of important you know if without it the
[1:45:51] Tool's kind of useless and
[1:45:53] um I was working on a AC unit and I
[1:45:57] somehow I dropped that part somewhere in
[1:46:01] the grass it's I mean tiny little part
[1:46:03] size your into your pinky and never find
[1:46:06] it and I'm like well this is like a $40
[1:46:09] tool and it it's trash without this I
[1:46:12] can't you know I got to have this and
[1:46:15] like well I found my phone yesterday
[1:46:18] Lord help me find that so I said Lord I
[1:46:20] need to find this little part could you
[1:46:22] could you help me and I you know and I
[1:46:25] looked around and well I don't know
[1:46:27] maybe I'll just I'll find it later and I
[1:46:29] turned to walk and I saw it sticking out
[1:46:31] of the grass just out in the yard where
[1:46:34] I mean I somehow kicked it and sent it
[1:46:36] flying I don't know I I mean I couldn't
[1:46:38] have there's no way you could have found
[1:46:40] that without the Lord guiding me and
[1:46:42] said man so I was I was having a good
[1:46:44] time about it just thinking about it
[1:46:46] went I was sitting in the in our
[1:46:48] material trailer just kind of having a
[1:46:50] good time about it thanking the lord and
[1:46:53] it just came on my heart so strong about
[1:46:55] how brother brandom said if you lost
[1:46:56] your pocket knife and you really needed
[1:46:57] it he'd put it in your pocket I said man
[1:47:00] I you know I was just really thinking
[1:47:02] about that and so got to the end of the
[1:47:05] day and I was you know packing up the
[1:47:08] tools getting you know going home and I
[1:47:11] realized I could not find my pocket
[1:47:12] knife that I use all the time like well
[1:47:15] yeah that's about right you know I you
[1:47:17] know here I am rejoicing over this now
[1:47:19] my pocket knife's
[1:47:21] gone and um I get home and I always I
[1:47:25] got a a bowl that I dump all my stuff in
[1:47:27] you know my all my keys and wallet and
[1:47:30] everything and all the screws and wire
[1:47:32] nuts that in my pockets as well and I
[1:47:34] always empty my pockets out and I dump
[1:47:37] it all in there and I put all in there
[1:47:39] and there's no pocket knife and I'm
[1:47:41] sitting there talking to my wife and
[1:47:44] we're just kind of talking and I reach
[1:47:45] in my pocket and my pocket knife's in my
[1:47:47] pocket wow and it was not in my pocket
[1:47:51] there was no way way that was in my
[1:47:54] pocket I I mean I it it's just there so
[1:47:58] I I don't know it it just meant a lot to
[1:48:00] me and amen I I thought maybe itd
[1:48:02] encourage somebody to hear about
[1:48:07] it I have a testimony
[1:48:11] purple so around um well it's probably
[1:48:15] been almost five or six months now it's
[1:48:18] about the turn of the Year about 5
[1:48:20] months uh we upgraded our phones
[1:48:23] and there was a little hitch a little
[1:48:25] hiccup the guy upgraded the wrong phone
[1:48:27] and so I asked for it and they agreed to
[1:48:30] upgrade them
[1:48:31] both for a free promotional upgrade
[1:48:34] which technically mine apparently wasn't
[1:48:36] initially supposed to be but they had it
[1:48:38] all messed up so they agreed they did
[1:48:40] both well we get the next bill you know
[1:48:43] and they always say oh it'll show up
[1:48:45] give it a month or two it didn't show up
[1:48:47] so I called and contacted oh don't worry
[1:48:49] it's all coming through it'll be
[1:48:51] fine next month sure enough it hadn't
[1:48:54] showed up yet
[1:48:56] so it
[1:48:57] was I believe about 4 months
[1:49:01] in the next time I had called him I was
[1:49:04] like look it ain't showing up and so the
[1:49:07] lady says oh well they never even
[1:49:11] up filled out the form so she said I'll
[1:49:13] fill out the forms well Meredith's phone
[1:49:16] shows up right away and mine don't oh
[1:49:19] Lord have mercy I've called them so many
[1:49:20] times youall know how it is
[1:49:24] and
[1:49:27] so we you know Lord let this work out I
[1:49:31] I can't deal with these people keep
[1:49:33] calling them and bugging them and they
[1:49:35] keep they they'll tell you anything to
[1:49:36] get you
[1:49:38] off and so the next month sure enough my
[1:49:41] phone still hadn't showed up and I kind
[1:49:43] of in my heart I was like Lord well I've
[1:49:46] done all I can do I just I guess if they
[1:49:48] don't if they don't do it then I'll just
[1:49:51] pay for it technically I guess I
[1:49:54] initially would have anyway but I kind
[1:49:56] of forgot about it and um two nights ago
[1:50:01] Linda my mother-in-law she sends me an
[1:50:05] email with the bill and it hadn't come
[1:50:08] out of mine yet again this month thought
[1:50:11] well let me just look it up so I'll look
[1:50:12] in the app and you can go to the the uh
[1:50:16] projected next bill and it had cleared
[1:50:20] they put it in so praise the Lord
[1:50:26] [Applause]
[1:50:29] [Music]
[1:50:31] well so I guess a maybe last week or the
[1:50:34] week before um we had that pretty
[1:50:38] awesome
[1:50:39] thunderstorm and I'm guilty of bringing
[1:50:42] that to bufor so um I was doing a roof
[1:50:46] wash and you basically just spray the
[1:50:49] chemicals up on the roof and let them do
[1:50:51] the work and you have have to rinse them
[1:50:53] off otherwise it's can be a bad deal and
[1:50:56] I'd clean this one area that was kind of
[1:50:58] hard to get to multiple times already
[1:51:00] and just would not clean up like I
[1:51:02] wanted it to and I was like man all I
[1:51:04] need I've killed all the stuff that's on
[1:51:07] the roof with the chemicals I've tried
[1:51:09] everything I can't get pressure on it
[1:51:11] and so I was just I had already been
[1:51:13] looking at the forecast I do every week
[1:51:16] and I knew that it was supposed to be
[1:51:18] sunny pretty much all week it was
[1:51:20] supposed to sprinkle at 4:00 I was like
[1:51:23] okay well maybe 4:00 we'll roll around
[1:51:25] it'll help me rinse that off well I mean
[1:51:28] it barely like sprinkled at all
[1:51:32] so I was just kind of not loving how it
[1:51:36] was turning out and I was just like Lord
[1:51:39] in the Bible we're I we're allowed to
[1:51:41] hold the sun still so I think I'm
[1:51:44] allowed to ask for a
[1:51:46] thunderstorm and
[1:51:49] so so so I uh you
[1:51:54] know then it starts getting cloudy and
[1:51:57] I'm like man I'm not ready for it yet
[1:52:00] so I still had quite a bit of roof to
[1:52:02] finish but it was I mean it was just
[1:52:05] dark the sky just rolled
[1:52:07] in and uh as soon as I let off the
[1:52:11] trigger of the pressure washer to rinse
[1:52:14] the last area I'd left that one spot
[1:52:16] alone as soon as I finish that last
[1:52:19] section it just cracks and Thunders
[1:52:22] explodes and rain starts dumping down
[1:52:25] for the rest of the night and rinses
[1:52:26] that area spotless so also I got one
[1:52:32] more uh the Lord definitely I had a a
[1:52:35] need for that same business and you know
[1:52:38] I just really needed a pickup that that
[1:52:41] green truck that I was rolling it wasn't
[1:52:43] cutting it and uh yesterday I got the
[1:52:47] opportunity to buy a pickup I bought a
[1:52:49] Ford but it's a I'll tell them myself
[1:52:54] but um it was the way it all happened it
[1:52:57] was just totally of the Lord and I'm
[1:52:59] really really thankful and feel very
[1:53:01] blessed so
[1:53:03] [Applause]
[1:53:08] amen God's mindful of the little things
[1:53:11] he
