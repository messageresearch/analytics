to commit ourselves to you for your glory we ask it in jesus name amen god bless you be doing probably the last in their series on chosen by god and we'll be in the future lord willing moving on to speak about the attributes of god not in the sense of the elect but in the sense of god's holiness god's justice righteousness etc um in the in the future subjects on wednesday nights so uh with that said let's go to the scripture romans 8 verse 13 for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body you shall live amen amen can be seated seems like a very strange verse to begin speaking about about being chosen by god but it's a vast subject and there's many avenues that you need to look at when you're looking at election it's not just simply that we've been chosen by god but it's all the process within that and what specifically we're looking at is you probably know it as eternal security or it's also referred to and you know if you look this up in the message search brother branham will refer to it as the perseverance of the saints and you'll often find brother branham said i do believe in eternal security but often it turns into disgrace and that's the part that we want to talk about a little bit tonight because the true understanding scripturally of eternal security has within it the process there eternal security isn't you believe and that's the end of it eternal security speaks of the process he who began a good work in you will be faithful to complete it to finish it there's a work that he begins and there's a work that he finishes there's a process that we as the elect of god as the bride of christ must be going through amen as an outward evidence that there's an inward work of grace that's taken place in our lives and that's why i read that scripture to start for if if you remember probably don't but if you remember at least a little bit of what i spoke about last on this subject last time we talked about how you know there are scriptures that speak about people falling away and people it being impossible to renew them again unto repentance if they fall away talks about people that are they were once around among us they had faith etc um and we we read there in 1st john 2 19 gives a good explanation of that i don't have that in my powerpoint but you can refer to it in the in your bible if you want to or i'll just read it and you can listen along they went out from us so they left they fell away why did they go out from us john they were not of us for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest they were not all not of us so let's unpack that he's not talking about some group of people it's not talking about a specific local church as though this local church you know the baptist denomination or the message church everybody in the churches are saved and filled with the holy ghost and believers we know that that's not true that there's three kinds of believers in every church and you know we're looking at the mystical body of christ why did they leave why did they stop believing john they went out because they were not elect if they had been elect they would stay with the word they would stay in faith and again we talked about that before it's not that there are people who are genuinely filled with the holy ghost saved elect of god that make serious mistakes and fall miserably but god is ultimately going to save them restore them we've seen it people have experienced it it isn't saying that people never fall it's saying that god has them and he is going to keep them even through the fall but yet there are people that go out from us why because they were not of us if they would have had genuine faith given as a gift of god god doesn't give the gift and pull it away because if you you you earned the fact that he pulled it away you didn't earn the fact that he gave it to you and you can't do anything for him to take it away he never will the fact is that people heard responded but they never had true faith given to them as a gift by god they just had human faith and when when the circumstances arose the human faith failed and they walked away and john says why did they walk away they weren't of us they weren't elect they weren't predestinated in god before the foundation of the world so that's why there's people they draw near to god with their mouth but their heart is far from him that's why there's people that say lord lord haven't we prophesied and done many mighty works in your name and you'll say depart from me you were conic your workers iniquity of iniquity why because they didn't do the will of the father the father they didn't follow the word of god they follow their own mind their own will their own purpose all that for an explanation of back to romans 8 13. paul here puts it on us if you live after the flesh you will die wait a minute paul you wrote before that by grace are you saved through faith that not of yourselves it's the gift of work of god not of works lest any man should boast now you're saying if you live after the flesh you'll die but if you through the spirit mortify the deeds of the flesh you'll live you're putting it back on me as though i can earn eternal life no no that's not what he's doing he's saying if you have the gift of god you didn't earn it by works and you're not earn it earning it by mortifying the deeds of the body but if you have the spirit dwelling in you which is self his salvation if you have the spirit of god living in you it produces something inside of you what is that that you put to death the deeds of the body true and genuine spirit-filled faith given faith puts to death the deeds of the body human faith worldly faith will not do that right it will not accomplish that it will abide in sin it will make excuses it will justify true genuine faith puts to death the deeds of the flesh that doesn't mean there's not a struggle that doesn't mean there is in a long time maybe lifelong battle against specific sin in your life but ultimately you will humbly bow your head before god say help me put this to death amen i don't want this in my life i hate it i despise it may it be gone from me and god will give victory it might be at the end of your life that's okay that's in god's hands you don't accomplish your own salvation you don't accomplish your own sanctification it's a work of grace right three works of grace sanctification isn't a work of the flesh it isn't a work of your own will it isn't a work of your own power it's a work of god in you if you're if you have true genuine justification i'm talking bride justification new testament justification it results in produces sanctification and a sanctification that goes from now until you have a new body it's it's continual and that's what the spirit does within us isaiah i'm going to bring that up 66 verse 2. for all those things hath mine a handmade and all those things have been saith the lord but to this man will i look this is the kind of condition of a man that god will look to dwell in you know it's talking about his dwelling place in isaiah 66 heaven is my throne earth is my footstool where is the place of my rest he says oh i've made all this all this has been i've done it where but to this man will i look this is the place i want to live and dwell in amen this is the condition of the heart of the godly man that i want to live in even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembles at my word amen do you tremble at the word of god amen you should you say well i have no fear god loves me well that's god does love you but you have to understand god still is a consuming fire god is a just god he's a good god but he's a just god and he will give to every man according to his works we will all stand before the judgment seat of christ no it's not a judgment to condemnation but it is a judgment of our works done in our body unto reward some will be saved smelling of smoke the bible says others they'll build gold precious stones some build on the foundation hay and stubble the the fire will declare what kind of works your life has produced right some will be burnt up they'll be saved and they'll smell a fire the others will be purified by the fire amen hymn that is of a contrite spirit and trembles at my word that's that's what the new birth produces in a man or a woman a poor not a proud spirit a poor a contrite a humble spirit one that trembles at the word of god one that just doesn't pass over quickly and say oh it doesn't matter god will forgive me that's a sign that's a bad sign that's a really uh disgusting spirit around you that would say that it doesn't matter if you love god you don't want to hurt him not what the prophet told us you say but he he looks at me he sees the blood absolutely but it also says if if you sin you need to confess your sins he's faithful and just to forgive your sins it also says if you don't forgive those who have sinned against you neither will your father in heaven forgive you these are things that should cause us to tremble at his word it's not as though you know god leaves that on us period god is working all along but we have to respond to it we read that quote the other day you see 1962 a marriage of the lamb if you want to pull it up again i'm not sure if i can control it back here yeah you you see god could not push us through a little pipe pull us out on the other end and then saying blessed is he that overcometh you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself i have to make decisions for myself in doing that we show our faith and respects to god let me go back to philippians 2 yeah so let's look at that in the context of of this verse wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling remember we read that he that trembles at my word so work out your own salvation with fear and trembling the work out there is not speaking of labor in that sense it's speaking of working out a mathematical problem in other words you're carrying it to its expected end 2 plus two equals four so as a christian we're going to carry out our salvation to what it equals to right right we're going to do the things that god wants us to do we're going to walk in obedience to him we're going to repent when we sin we're going to make things right with people we're going to be givers we're going we're going to read the word we're going to pray we're going to pray for each other we're going to exhort each other the things the scripture commands us to do we walk in obedience to them we don't have to make up our own equation the equation is already set amen but we need to follow the word of god work it out with your own with your own salvation with fear and trembling why for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure so how are you working out your own salvation in your own power and strength no it's god who's energizing you god who puts his power in you both to ch to will means to choose so how are you choosing and making the decision to work out your salvation god is working in you to will and to do of his good pleasure so no he doesn't push you through a pipe you have to walk with him you have to live for him you have to respond to him but we understand that actually in all this it's god working in us paul says i think in i guess first corinthians 15 that he labored more than all the other apostles it's quite a statement i worked harder than everyone yeah yeah what did he say right behind that yet not i but the grace of god that was in me so this there's this working that you and i do this effort that we put in but ultimately we understand it's god in there working and moving amen [Music] let's go on to uh yes brother branham says this so if you ever want to pray for me this is in the sermon show us the father and will satisfy so if you ever want to pray for me it's not to have money not to have big homes or be popular but just pray that i can stay in the hands of christ mold clay that he can mold me and use me in any way that he sees fit to do i'll pray the same thing for you that you'll be the same way so no god doesn't push us through a pipe and yet we're clay he molds us he shapes us he works in us so you have to have both sides it's not just we're going to take this quote and this quote and we're going to cause them to fight against each other or this scripture in this scripture i mean right there in philippians chapter 2 he says work out your own salvation i'm going oh it's getting hot in here i'm not sure how that's going to work i can't work out my own salvation paul and then right behind it he comforts us with those words it's god working in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure but he he didn't just leave it as god working in you he's saying you work it out because it's god working they both go hand in hand and they're both important first john 3 verse 3 and every man that has this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure i love that so if you're elect if you're truly filled with the spirit of god you have that hope in you what is it you you purify yourself even as god himself is pure god is in you you'll be purified by the pure one first john 2 verse 29 if you know that he is righteous you know that everyone that does righteousness is born of him amen again very clear scriptures if you're if you're of this opinion and idea that we're saved by the grace of god and we don't have to live a righteous life that's that's what john is writing to that god's grace is free and full it matters not how we live we can live any way we choose to live and he says if you do righteousness you're born of him now in in a way you look that at that and say oh my so is it my righteousness that makes me born of him no no that's not what's being said it's saying it's looking at the outward to the inward paul is looking from the outward to the inward in philippians 2 right other places he looks from the inward to the outward but this one is saying hey you think that you're born of god without doing righteousness you've got it you got it wrong if you're doing righteousness you're born of him yeah in other words what produces righteousness amen right being born of him so being born of him you will live a righteous life a just life before god you're not going to be living sloppy any old way you're going to be living as a reflection of jesus christ first john 4 7 beloved let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god again if you love you're born of god does that mean i have to love to get born of god no you love him because he first loved you we love as a result of his love being placed upon us but when his love is placed upon us it produces it produces something right it produces a life of agape love not just lip service reality amen people misunderstand what love is we were talking about that on on sunday and sunday school and people get love as this sloppy thing love is corrective love is compassionate love reaches out love does love doesn't just sit back and say i love brother brad i see that he's you know dying on the street but that's fine i love him love says oh i gotta i've gotta help i've gotta do something all right uh first john 5 18. we know that who whosoever is born of god sins not ooh but he that is begotten of god keeps himself and that wicked one touches him not what does that mean because if that's if we're to take that lock stock and barrel literally i know i'm disqualified but we can't take it lock stock and barrel because he starts the book out saying if you say you don't have any sin you're a liar so what is he what is he trying to point out here i i it could be something else but i'll just put it this way uh on the one hand you look at god god justifying us and he he he looks at us and says you've never sinned in the first place so you could look at it from that direction or you could look at it also in the direction that the person that's born of god doesn't make a practice of continuing and abiding continuously in sin amen you know a believer is in a continual process of purging himself from sin we saw that before if you're you're born of god or if you have that hope in yourself you purify yourself even as he is pure we don't just sin continue if you look at it from that context that john is writing to people that are abusing what paul is preaching on the grace of god in the sense that you know let a sin that grace may abound if you look at it that in that sense you'll see whoever's born of god sins not i mean that's wrapping them on the fingers and saying if you have the new birth you're not going to be walking in a sinful lifestyle on a continual basis you'll be purging yourself and you'll not be walking and living in sin before god philippians 1 6 we referred to it before but just as we kind of close this portion of talking about election and move on to the next sub-topic he that began a good work in you will be faithful to complete it until the day of jesus christ that is ultimately what we're talking about when we talk about eternal security it's talking about the one who started the work will continue it and finish it it's not talking about he started to work and there's nothing else going on we just believe and we'll be saved there's nothing happening it's it's literally talking about he will keep us and preserve us until the day of jesus christ he will strengthen us to abide and stay and walk in christ through many ups and downs through many falls through many sins but will keep getting up and will keep walking because it's god working in us and he'll be faithful to complete it so next part is looking at that christ and you'll recognize this from quotes but christ died only for those whose names are written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world he dies only for the elect now we understand salvation is offered to all his blood is sufficient for all and yet god is not running his great drama of redemption and saying i hope some people respond he has a specific plan a specific purpose christ came he died exactly for that purpose for the elect he wiped all their sins away completely amen from start to finish but it was for specific people he did not die for every single human being in all of history if he died for every single human being in all of history every single human being in all of history would be saved but not every single human being in all of history is saved so we'll look at the scriptures first one is revelation 13 verse 8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of the life of the land book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world so there's people whose names are already on that book of life they're written there and they're written before the foundation of the world amen the next one revelation 17 verse 8 the beast that you saw was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the beast that was and is not and yet is so those are the ones that he was slain for those are the ones that he died for everyone whose name was written on that book he died for them proving his word brother branham says this now that's a big word predestinate but we all know it's the truth we absolutely know that the infinite god predestinated all things by foreknowledge before the foundation of the world even the lamb was slain and every name that would ever be on the book was put on the book before the book was ever written now how many knows that's true and jesus came to redeem those that were in the book in the bible the land came from the behind the curtain and taken the book and opened the seals that it was sealed with for he came to claim all that he had redeemed he's the intercessor now an intercessor making intercessions for those who he has redeemed all whose names was written on the lamb's book of life is redeemed amen so john 3 16 is the very first verse that people will bring up when they want to prove this is contrary to scripture god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life so god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son so it must be that he died for the whole world well we'll look at that in more in more depth in the scripture who did he die for but before we get there i want to read ii peter 3 verse 9 and we want to look at the will of god we speak of the will of god and we all know there's the perfect will of god the permissive will of god and there's different ways even the scripture speaks about the will of god ii peter 3 9 the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance so not willing so willing is the word we're looking that god is not willing so i'm going to look there's three different ways and there's there's more ways than that but three main ways i want to talk about tonight that god it's that the bible speaks of the will of god first the bible speaks of the sovereign will of god whatever god decrees he does it before the foundation of the world and that will come to pass there's nothing that's going to stop it there's nothing that's gonna thwart it nothing will get in the way of god working out that will which he has declared before the foundation of the world next one is how god makes his declaration of himself uh by the word he declares his word and he wants us to walk in obedience to it so that is the will of god for us how do we know god's will for you and you and me we read this book then we know the will of god for for us do we always follow the will of god in this book no we don't and so that's called sin when we don't believe and don't walk in obedience to the word of god and so that is that was in the sovereign will of god declared before the foundation of the world even though it's contrary to his declared word written in scripture and then the third third way the bible speaks about it is like human-like uh expressions of god you know that god uh burned an anger toward the children of israel and it's like god repented that he made man upon the earth well god knew when he made man before the world was ever created that they were going to sin that he was going to drown the earth in water none of that caught god off guard he planned it that way right it was his purpose and yet we he it speaks in a human-like expression of god's will in the sense of emotions this is how this is god in his heart towards the world right we know that that's that's not the only way that we look at the will of god because we understand nothing cuts him off guard he planned it that way so in this let's go back to the previous verse god is not willing that any should perish so does that mean that god was unable to save some people that god was not omnipotent that he lacked the power to save people no of course not this is speaking on a human human level god's heart towards the world he's not willing he doesn't want anyone to perish but look at it closer and notice that it says long suffering not to everyone long suffering to us word not willing that any should perish so the us word qualifies when he says any right so he doesn't mean any as in the whole human race from all of history it's qualified us word whose us word god's elect again god's not a spectator in his great drama of redemption he is working all things after the counsel of his own will ephesians 1 11. all right go ahead to the next one john 6 37 all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out that that looks at it from both directions anyone that puts their trust and faith in jesus christ will be saved but remember we're not talking about human faith that has nothing to do with salvation we're talking about the faith that is given as a gift from god the faith of jesus christ imparted to us as a believer that's what that's the faith that god recognized all the father given me will come that's the other side of it is not everyone comes to christ how do we explain that because they're not ordained to do it they're not ones that the father is given next verse john 6 39 and this is the father's will which has sent me that of all which he has given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day do you think jesus has lost anyone he said all power in heaven and earth is given unto me amen so omnipotent power is in the hands of jesus christ he will lose not a single one everyone that god has chosen from before the foundation of the world christ will bring through next one john 17 2 as thou has given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him doesn't say he gives eternal life to all flesh he gives eternal life to the ones that are given to him what does that mean the ones that god chose in christ before the foundation of the world amen next one i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thy they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept thy word he wasn't sent to everyone was he he was sent to manifest god's name to the men which were given to him just to those next verse i pray for them this is shocking i pray not for the world amen oh jesus how can you say that you should be praying for the whole world that wasn't his job that's not what he was sent to do i pray for the ones you've given me i pray for the elect next one verse 24 father i will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where i am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world doesn't pray for everyone this is christ's intercessory prayer before he goes to calvary he's interceding not for everyone but for the ones that the father gave him that they would be in heaven together amen next verse isaiah 53 8 he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken the whole world was he stricken no my people god's people god's elect next verse 53 verse 11 he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify all no justify many for he shall bear their iniquities it's many not all next verse john 10 verse 15 as the father knoweth me even so i know i the father and i lay down my life for the sheep who did christ come to die for he didn't come to die for the goats he came to die for the sheep that's who he laid the ones that the father had given him that's who he's laying his life down for the ones who he was sent to manifest his god's name to those are the ones the ones he was praying for i don't pray for the world i pray for the ones you've given me brother branham says this in the hebrew series he wasn't willing that you should be perished you would perish but him being infinite he had to know the end from the beginning or he isn't god so jesus never come to earth to say well i'll just see if somebody be mercy if i act to die in a hard way they'll probably think well it'll persuade their hearts and they'll god don't run his business like that jesus came for one purpose that's to save those who god before the foundation of the world knew would be saved he said so that's right it's not him that willeth or him that runeth it's god that showeth mercy amen thank you so as we said before if christ died for the sins of the whole world every person would be saved because that's how effective his blood is his blood is effective if it if god would have said this forgives an infinite number of sins then it would but that's not what he said he said he'll die for my people i came down to lay down my life for my sheep he'll justify many our sins our sins are completely dealt with at calvary amen that's why we can have that you know this is something we can have confidence in the blood of jesus christ it is sent for a specific purpose according to scripture to forgive my sins to forgive your sins specifically every one of those sins was it wasn't as though god said well all the sins of the world i don't know what's going to happen but you know there's been a lot of sins let's throw them on jesus and see kind of what sticks there and if anybody believes in him you know it'll work for him i mean that's crazy he took he knew what sins he was dying for he took my sins specific ones exact ones precise ones and they were there put upon christ in gethsemane and he was forsaken and he was bruised for my iniquities it's very that's that's our god our god is exact and specific he's not generic he knows exactly what he's doing god never fails amen god never fails he doesn't just throw throw the gospel net out and wonder what's going to happen he has the the plan is perfectly laid out the sins are perfectly atoned for he knows the very moment you're going to receive the holy coast or that you did receive the holy ghost all of that is pre-planned by god before the world was ever created brother branham says even every time that a flea would bat its eye something as insignificant as a flea god knows how many times it bats its eye one flea he knows how many hairs that brother luther lost and he knows how many hairs he still has and he's going to give every one of them back to him one day amen did jesus lose anyone he's never lost one of his sheep he couldn't possibly do it does christ intercede for the whole world he he said he didn't i don't pray for the world i pray for the ones you've given me even the intercession the mediatorship of christ is very specific and targeted and exact uh romans 8 33 and 34 who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifies so the implication is there's no one that's going to lay anything to the charge of god's elect it's completely impossible the highest judge of all the earth that's what abraham called him the judge shall not the judge of all the earth do right so he's the judge of all the earth it's god that justifies so you're you're making accusations but they're not sticking satan amen amen who is he that condemns so who's the one that can raise up and bring articles of condemnation against brother brad it's christ that died yeah yeah rather that is risen again who's even at the right hand of god who also makes intercession for us yes we got this we got this salvation thing wrapped up it's all taken care of we have god justifying us we have christ interceding for us there's he's not going to lose one amen next verse matthew 1 21 and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save who his people from their sins next verse even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many next verse blessed be the lord god of israel for he hath visited and redeemed his people not all people his people next verse i am the good shepherd the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep next verse take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the holy ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church of god which he hath purchased with his own blood who did he purchase the whole world no the church of god the elect of god next verse john 11 49-52 and some of some and one of them named caiaphas being the high priest that same year said unto them you know nothing at all nor consider that is it expedient for us that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perished not and this spake he not of himself being high priest that year he prophesied that jesus should die for that nation and not for that nation only but that also he should gather together in one the children of god that were scattered abroad i love that i love how john speaks of that that it's he's laying down his life for who everyone i know the children of god which are scattered gentiles not just for jewish children of god but for gentile children of god specific first timothy 2 a few verses that people will bring as objections for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time uh oh jason you're in trouble he gave himself as a ransom for all now number one we can never take a multitude of verses and try to reinterpret those verses based on one verse scripture interprets itself same thing that we look at the godhead you don't just take one verse and isolate it again you don't take matthew 28 19 and isolate it against the scriptures in the book of acts you don't take first john 5 7 and isolate it against the rest of the whole scripture you have to understand each of them and bringing a proper balance and blend to the whole situation so you know let's look at uh i think the next one up there is um mark 1 verse 5. you know well let's read it and there went out unto him all the land of judea and they of jerusalem and were all baptized of him in the river of jordan confessing their sins so if we take this verse at face value isolated against the rest of the gospel story we would be quite confused here we have all the land of judea is responding to the message of john and every one of them goes out and is baptized by john the baptist in the jordan river we know as a fact based on the gospel narrative not every single person agreed with john not every single person believed john many people rejected john so what does it mean what is the picture that's being painted here well let's the next verse i think is got luke 7 30 but the pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of god against themselves being not baptized of him amen so all and then here's not some of them were not so how do we how do we arrive here i mean it's pretty simple plain language it's it's it's simply saying a vast number of people from all ranks and societies went out to be baptized by john not literally every single person but many many many many many many many a huge number of people went out that it was everyone was shocked that's why the big superlative amount is used all of them went out and they were all baptized no not literally every single person we know that so all of what you know it can also be the bible can speak uh uh we read it before i think it was in revelation 13 verse 8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world so the whole all that dwell upon the earth will worship him well we know by scripture not every single person there's elected that don't so it's not all in that sense it means all of a group all of what group all of the ones who are not written in the lamb's book of life from before the foundation of the world all of that group so what is this saying they all went out they were all baptized a big group of people went out and a big group of people was baptized from every station of life from important people to the poor person to the average person they all went out and were baptized so christ gave his life as a ransom for all all who context of scripture all of god's elect amen who shall lay a charge against god's elect first timothy 4 verse 10 is another verse that's can be brought up for for therefore we both labor and suffer reproach because we trust in the living god who is the savior of all men especially of those who believe amen god's the savior of all men amen god makes his reign to fall on the just and the unjust god helps all of mankind those that love him those that hate him and in that sense we can say he's the savior of all men but then it goes he he wants to point out something more specific especially of those that believe this word specially means most particularly or in the greatest degree so he's the savior of all men but in the greatest degree of those that believe so there's two degrees here that paul's talking about there's one degree where he's the savior of everyone does that mean everyone's going to heaven no but he's to the greater degree the savior of those that believe he's the savior of all men he makes his reign to shine fall on the just and the unjust he pours his blessing out out on the just and the unjust he even helps people heals people delivers people from terrible circumstances that never call on his name never ask for help never even care or recognize that god did something for them that's our god he does good to the evil and of the good that's why he calls us to do the same thing right because he does it so musicians if you'd come just to bring a conclusion i'm gonna turn in the book of ephesians chapter one verse 4 according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love and then down to verse 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestined predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will this is our sovereign god amen he predestinated us again that means that he fixed our destiny before the foundation of the world he said this person is going to be immortal and is going to be walking on an eternal place an eternal city he's destined us to that before the foundation of the world and he works it according to the council of his own will he doesn't work it according to our will or all purpose he work our purpose he works it according to his purpose then he begins this work in us he draws us to himself he opens our heart to hear and receive the word he fills us with the holy spirit and then he says i've started this work in you and i'm going to continue this work of making you more like jesus christ of washing you with the water of the word and as an identification you're going to be walking in righteousness holiness love and but it's going to be me working in you and producing this and i've covered all your sins i've taken care of all of that and i'm going to keep you to the very end amen that that is the work of salvation that is election all of those processes and the fact is you can't make any of it happen in your own will remember we we started out where we talked about there's none that seeks after god there's none that does good no not one you're it's god that does the calling it's that god that does the filling with the spirit you can't fill yourself with the spirit of god it's god that creates the conditions in you that you respond to his call and then god continues to work in you to will and to do of his good pleasure and because of that work in you you have a heart that trembles at his word amen let's pray gracious heavenly father we're so thankful for your word lord so many treasures in there so many treasures to know exactly who we are to see what you're doing in us lord to see what you're to produce within us lord what treasures and that it's your work in us making us more like jesus christ making us more of a reflection of his love lord we just we ask that your spirit would take these words and write them upon our hearts lord i know for myself it's it's been over 20 years since these you you've taught me these things lord and through the scriptures and through the reformers and through brother branham's message lord and it's been my delight and it will continue to be my delight to know that i serve a glorious sovereign god who keeps me who creates purity and righteousness and holiness and love inside of me it doesn't cause me to be lazy it gives me such such a a passion lord for your glory and lord to see these things established in the hearts of believers it gives such peace as such rest lord it's you it's you working let us surrender to that work let us give our hearts and our minds and all that we are lord and allow you to use us and to shape us and to mold us and to create that perfect love within us that you said would be in the bride of jesus

these things in the name of jesus christ amen um i wanted to give an opportunity to sister brenda to tell her testimony i'll bring you the microphone here okay so this is just a shortened version um because there's so many things that the lord has done in this situation there would be no way for me to tell it all at this time but i do want to make it known that i thank god for all of it because it's all been so dear to me so back in october of last year um the lord delivered a message that went straight to my heart while i was in church and he let me know that i was gonna go through something but he was with me and i would be okay and that the battle is the lord's and i found myself sir surrender my will and accept the lord's word i was experiencing in my heart throughout that entire service and i made notes later and i shared it with my parents as a way to encourage them and not to fear as the lord had already prepared me for this i had a choice to make and accept his will use his word for my strength and i found a faith that rose inside of me that left no room for fear i just felt myself facing everything that was said to me as god's opportunity to be god in my life and to show himself his word was my faith my strength my comfort and as i faced pain and physical symptoms and the doctor's diagnosis i can't express strong enough that it was his word that came to me and spoke to my heart that gave me victory from the moment i heard it and accepted it it was an absolute no fear zone for me because of his word so in january the diagnosis was stage 3 melanoma cancer and it was explained that once it gets into the lymphatic system and bloodstream in microscopic cells it travels throughout the body through these symptoms i'm sorry these systems and it shows up in other parts of the body and that melanoma is a very aggressive cancer so i became aware of something painful under my arm in july or august last year and i was thinking that i had pulled a muscle from where i had been moving knowing hindsight that this was an aggressive cancer leads me to believe that god refused that demon any further access just my opinion but that is how i feel now that the treatment plan was given three to four months of a dual drug immunotherapy by infusions surgery to remove all my lymph nodes under the arm and other surrounding tissues as the tumor was too large to operate at that time they would not be able to get a clear margin around it and then they would do radiation and then they would go back to immunotherapy to finish out treatments for a full year so it would be march of 2021 to continue treating the systems that run through my body for protection i felt somehow resistant to surgery and even though i knew it was god's if that was god's will i would surrender my will it just never felt that it was going to be required i said no and i felt the lord back me up so i thank the lord for sparing me this the first week of march i received the first infusion and the first treatment literally laid a killing blow the treatment boosted my own immune system to do exactly what god had designed my body to naturally do my immune system fought and it killed cancer cells i literally felt it pulsing and gurgling it was aching and i was having a lot of pain that whole week and then it just suddenly stopped on week three i went back for the checkup in the examination and they couldn't feel the tumor at all it was gone after three months i had the ct scan and it showed that it had shrunk drastically the doctor said more than likely there was no cancer there at that time but my lymph nodes were still somewhat swollen so shortly after that appointment my examinations were felt to be all normal lymph nodes and my doctor kept just repeating almost in disbelief this is so wonderful i had to wait for the six months to get another scan and so here we are at six months and per my doctor's words i love this oh my goodness oh her words perfect scan no sign of any disease in my body all lymph nodes are normal all labs are good and i just need to go out and celebrate so i say yep so i say thank you lord jesus for such an awesome work of your love your grace and your mercy and your healing that you bestowed upon me thank you lord amen thank you any others all right let's worship the lord together [Music] i love to sing [Music] my ears the sweetest name on earth amen [Music] how i love jesus [Music] how i love jesus [Music] [Music] love me it tells me what my father's had in store for every day and though i dress a dark [Music] the [Music] way and know how i love jesus [Music] i love jesus oh how i love jesus [Music] amen uh looks like i missed a prayer request from brother don tonight we're gonna pray for that and then we can dismiss he says please pray for tony parricelli doctors are planning to remove his bladder and prostate his wife is asking for our prayers that the lord would intercede and bring about the best possible outcome amen let's pray heavenly father you're the same yesterday today and forever your people testify around the world that that's a that is absolute fact a reality in their lives lord and so this request was made known to brother don and it's been made known now to the to the church and we're just agreeing by faith in complete and total healing what a what what a difficult circumstance to blatter and prostate removed my but lord with you all things are possible you you are still in the business of healing so i asked that you would touch tony that you would make him completely well that when they go to retest before surgery that he would be miraculously healed and it would not be necessary lord we just want to commit each one here driving home into your hands watch over them and protect them lord and those listening in lord meet their needs be their god be their provider be their all in all lord meet them right where they're at lord and grant a mighty deliverance lord we thank you for your word for your light and life in this hour manifested before us we just commit each one to you for your glory in the name of jesus christ amen amen amen god bless you [Music] how i love jesus oh [Music] how i love you he's a begotten [Music] there is a name i [Music] and i love to sing it's worth [Laughter] [Music] the sweet name on earth and know how i [Music] he's how i love jesus [Music] love me [Music] [Music] [Music] you
