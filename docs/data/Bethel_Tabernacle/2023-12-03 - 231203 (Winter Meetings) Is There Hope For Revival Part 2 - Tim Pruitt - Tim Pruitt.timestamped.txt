[13:38] body amen give our brother a hand as he
[13:40] [Applause]
[13:44] comes pressure or prayer either
[13:49] works
[13:51] whatevers oh boy well I'm going to give
[13:55] a a little testimony if that's all right
[13:58] uh just to I'm just going to get real
[14:00] with y'all go ahead and I'm trying to
[14:03] all right
[14:06] keep well brother got me first with a
[14:09] song this morning U my old friend uh Tom
[14:12] Brown he's he's not gone on to be with
[14:14] the Lord but he would request that song
[14:16] and I've had my mind just so much on the
[14:20] Rapture Glen
[14:23] Hallelujah in these
[14:26] meetings I can't tell you
[14:29] just my own
[14:32] personal
[14:36] trial bear with me one
[14:41] second I
[14:43] have said I have all these things too
[14:46] much and I do have a lot of pressure on
[14:50] myself right now and uh it's a total
[14:53] sacrifice just to be
[14:55] here and uh he knows all
[14:59] things than God and there's just in my
[15:03] business there's millions of dollars
[15:06] being decided and consequences that
[15:08] affect me directly that uh I've had
[15:11] pressures on and along with all the
[15:13] trials of life that everyone goes
[15:14] through not to belittle anybody's issue
[15:18] but it just doesn't matter and and he's
[15:21] bought he's brought me other ones I know
[15:24] to a place where you know what the
[15:28] footsteps of the righteous were ordered
[15:31] not requested amen
[15:33] order of the Lord yes sir and so my own
[15:38] personal thought is he's taking all
[15:41] these things of the world not
[15:42] necessarily the the the good things that
[15:46] you enjoy but he's taking all of it and
[15:49] bungling it up and saying you can try
[15:51] and be aart you can try and mold it to
[15:54] your will but it just doesn't matter
[15:56] because our sight is on things above
[16:00] brother brandham preached look look up
[16:03] look up Hallelujah the brass serpent up
[16:05] here here don't look down here look up
[16:09] and that's it that's all we got to do
[16:11] Saints Amen brother Timothy is I always
[16:14] tell him he's my favorite but I tell you
[16:15] you're my favorite and brother Tim's my
[16:18] favorite so and uh and and but pray be
[16:22] prayer with us uh We've also been pulled

[16:28] facility in our area and uh we've just

[16:34] difficult and uh but I wanted to just

[16:39] didn't come back because of guilt we
[16:41] came back because we love y'all amen we
[16:43] feel pulled to to just be a part we
[16:45] don't want to leave these meetings we
[16:47] don't want to leave these times and I
[16:49] really don't want to deal with what I
[16:50] got to deal with when I go home so I'll
[16:52] stay as long as we

[47:08] your children in Jesus name amen amen
[47:12] God bless you why don't you turn with me
[47:15] to Matthew chapter 8 and we'll read from
[47:18] verse
[47:20] 23 Matthew 8 and verse
[47:24] 23 and when when he was entered into a
[47:27] ship his disciples followed him and
[47:30] behold there Rose a great Tempest in the
[47:32] sea in so much that the ship was covered
[47:36] with the waves but he was
[47:38] asleep and his disciples came to him and
[47:41] awoke him saying Lord save us we perish
[47:46] and he said unto them why are you
[47:48] fearful oh ye of little faith then he
[47:52] rose and rebuked the winds and the Sea
[47:55] and there was was a great calm but the
[47:57] men marveled saying what manner of man
[48:00] is this that even the winds and the way
[48:04] the sea obey him and when he was come to
[48:08] the other side into the country of the G
[48:12] genes then there met him two possessed
[48:16] with Devils coming out of the tombs
[48:19] exceeding Fierce so that no man might
[48:23] pass by that way God bless you you can
[48:26] be
[48:27] seated amen thank you very much we
[48:30] appreciate the musicians and all the
[48:33] contribution to the Lord the wonderful
[48:35] singing today and the worship unto the
[48:37] Lord it was is always wonderful Amen to
[48:41] see the Holy Spirit move and the songs
[48:44] and worship and you know we just have to
[48:47] keep pressing the battle with all that
[48:49] we have even when we come to church it's
[48:52] You Know The Enemy will come and try to
[48:55] pull you this side or that side but you
[48:57] have to focus in Amen Let the Holy
[49:00] Spirit speak to you very because he
[49:03] speaking expressly in this hour now
[49:06] today I am I'm actually going to um do a
[49:11] little bit of of um review of yesterday
[49:14] in the ministers meeting and and go from
[49:17] there I wonder how many of you streamed
[49:20] or heard the or was here for the for the
[49:22] ministers meeting raise your hand let me
[49:24] just see all right so there may be a
[49:28] tenth um of the congregation that was
[49:31] that has listened so anyway um you know
[49:34] we we did stream that yesterday for
[49:37] those who wanted to hear but um today as
[49:40] we're looking into the scripture I'm
[49:43] going to I'm going to take a a thought
[49:47] and I really I will recap a few things
[49:50] that I spoke yesterday in the ministers
[49:53] meeting but I will also um
[49:56] go into a lot of more new material today
[49:59] and I'm going to be speaking on is there
[50:02] hope for
[50:03] Revival so that's a question that comes
[50:06] on many hearts today is there hope of
[50:09] Revival and for the ministers that was
[50:12] there this will be part two for you and
[50:15] so I'd also like to take a scripture
[50:18] reading from Matthew chapter
[50:21] 14 and verse
[50:23] 22 and straightway Jesus constrained his
[50:28] disciples to get into a ship and to go
[50:31] before him unto the other side while he
[50:34] sent the multitudes away and when he had
[50:38] sent the multitudes away he went up into
[50:41] a mountain apart to pray and when the
[50:44] evening was come he was there alone but
[50:48] the ship was now in the midst of the sea
[50:51] tossed with waves for the wind was
[50:54] contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the
[50:57] night Jesus uh went unto them walking on
[51:01] the sea and when the disciples saw him
[51:04] walking on the sea they were troubled
[51:07] saying it is a spirit and they cried out
[51:10] for fear but straight way Jesus spake
[51:14] unto them be of good cheer it is I Be
[51:18] not Afraid and Peter answered and said
[51:21] Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee
[51:25] on the water and he said come and when
[51:28] Peter was come down out of the ship he
[51:32] walked on the water to go to Jesus but
[51:35] when he saw the wind boisterous he was
[51:37] afraid and beginning to sink he cried
[51:40] saying Lord save me and immediately
[51:44] Jesus stretched forth his hand and
[51:47] caught him and said unto him oh thou of
[51:50] little faith wherefore didst thou doubt
[51:53] and when they were come into the ship
[51:55] the wind ceased then they that were in
[51:58] the ship came and worshiped him saying
[52:01] of Truth Thou Art the Son of God now you
[52:06] know I I spoke to you um on Friday night
[52:09] on you know in an Evangelistic Manner
[52:12] and and brother Timothy has ministered a
[52:16] couple of very marvelous Evangelistic
[52:19] sermons but today we're just going to be
[52:22] laying in the the word of God in a
[52:25] little different format this morning and
[52:28] um talk about the day and hour that
[52:30] we're living in maybe this being Sunday
[52:34] use this as a little Sunday school
[52:35] teacher teaching and also for the
[52:38] ministers that might listen to this
[52:40] maybe to take this maybe a little step
[52:43] further than what we went and maybe to
[52:45] recap some of the things but uh for you
[52:48] for you young people that are here today
[52:53] um and and even some middle age you
[52:56] don't realize the the the great impact
[52:59] of the Revival that is that is taking
[53:02] place in this in this uh past Century oh
[53:06] starting with the zza street and there
[53:08] just was marvelous things that took
[53:11] place it was a true Revival of God and
[53:14] the supernatural worked in great ways
[53:18] and I don't even have time to even talk
[53:21] about their Revival but it was actually
[53:25] um part of the of the former reign in
[53:28] the sense of um preparing the ground
[53:32] softening the ground or preparing it for
[53:35] the planting to come right and so you
[53:38] know it would it would actually get an
[53:40] atmosphere of faith in people's lives
[53:43] where they would start believing in
[53:45] Miracles and Supernatural and and
[53:48] whatever it was preparing them for God
[53:51] to do greater things and so then of
[53:54] course in
[53:56] 1946 there would be the angel of God
[53:59] would come to brother brandom in U and
[54:02] in in the room and there when he he
[54:05] comes it was it came as a light as a
[54:08] pillar of fire about about like this and
[54:11] it was a a whirling fire and there and
[54:15] and then out of that fire stepped a man
[54:17] that was 200 lbs and 6ot tall and and uh
[54:22] had a white robe on and and was standing
[54:24] there there and and looking at him and
[54:27] and said you know that I I've come to
[54:30] explain to you about your misunderstood
[54:32] life and and um and explained to him
[54:36] about his gift that was in his life and
[54:39] what God had planned for us in the end
[54:42] time to prepare us for a time of for the
[54:47] Rapture now of course as you as you know
[54:51] that that spark to Revival um it it
[54:55] began with with just a miraculous
[54:58] beginning to happen one thing after
[55:00] another after another um and and um and
[55:05] it would just it would just grow in
[55:07] volume and then there would be people
[55:09] from everywhere that would come there
[55:12] was there was such a a Zeal that people
[55:15] would come and and lay under um the
[55:19] their trucks or their cars you know they
[55:21] would take a town of couple of thousand
[55:24] people in Jonesburg
[55:25] Arkansas and swell it to 30,000 and
[55:29] there's no accommodations for them so
[55:31] you know they're out there camping under
[55:33] their trucks or their cars or whatever
[55:36] else and coming to the meetings and it
[55:38] was a it was a tremendous time and and
[55:43] um brother Brandon made these comments
[55:45] and and maybe this will help U catch a
[55:48] little bit of glimpse of of what he
[55:50] witnessed he said we just witnessed one
[55:52] of the greatest revivals I've believe
[55:55] that the world has ever seen in this
[55:57] last 10 or 15 years it's been a Revival
[56:01] not just like the days of Billy Sunday
[56:03] or the days of the Welsh Revival the
[56:05] days of wesling Revival or the Moody
[56:08] Revival or Billy Sunday Revival has been
[56:11] a worldwide sweeping Affair around the
[56:15] world and great healing services and
[56:18] great Revival fires has burned
[56:20] practically on every heel there is in
[56:23] the world right tonight AC way over
[56:25] across in the lands of Africa down in
[56:28] China Japan this gospel is being
[56:31] preached and people are being healed
[56:32] right this very minute around and around
[56:35] the world it's been one of the greatest
[56:37] revivals because I believe it's one of
[56:39] the last revivals this world will see a
[56:43] world sweeping
[56:46] Revival but now in these last few years
[56:49] is quen down you you don't notice the
[56:51] enthusiasm in the people that used to be
[56:55] I I remember having the privilege by the
[56:58] Holy Spirit to spearhead that Revival
[57:01] that started when that angel of the Lord
[57:03] appeared on the river and said that
[57:06] about many years ago and to see it
[57:08] happen and see it set ministers hearts
[57:11] of fire and everywhere revivals broke
[57:13] out while you could just simply walk
[57:15] into a building and the people just get
[57:19] up out of their Cs and stretches and
[57:21] walk away healed you didn't have to say
[57:24] one word just being there that's all it
[57:28] taken I remember one night in vandelia
[57:30] Illinois I walked into the meeting and
[57:33] had no longer been in the meeting over
[57:35] five minutes there wasn't a feeble
[57:37] person around the place anywhere
[57:40] wheelchairs pushed out and piled up and
[57:43] blind was seeing and deaf and dumb
[57:46] speaking just simply the spirit of the
[57:48] Lord was present and he just healed the
[57:51] whole group of them but now that's when
[57:53] you can do something when Revival is
[57:56] going but let that Revival fire die down
[58:00] then you can hardly then people are
[58:01] still Christians they're they're not but
[58:04] they're not revived into that spirit
[58:07] that great atmosphere that does
[58:10] something notice that an atmosphere that
[58:13] does something how we must drive to have
[58:16] that atmosphere within our churches it's
[58:19] just like in in a forge in a
[58:21] blacksmith's shop you got to get the
[58:23] iron hot before you go to pounding it on
[58:26] an anvil if you don't you'll never
[58:28] straighten it out and that's what it
[58:29] takes to have a Revival is everybody
[58:33] under the heat of the spirit that's
[58:35] brought down the powers of God and a
[58:37] Revival me moving and there is prayer
[58:40] meetings going every going day and night
[58:42] every minute everywhere why the people
[58:44] wouldn't even leave the grounds and of
[58:47] course you know those meetings would go
[58:49] even brother Bron would try to pray for
[58:51] everybody and the prayer lines got even
[58:53] longer and and after he said I'll pray
[58:55] for everybody in 8 days and 8 night he
[58:57] was there in the prayer lines in Jones
[59:00] on in Jonesboro Arkansas so many things
[59:03] that happened you know dur during that
[59:06] time but brother brandom you know came
[59:09] and he and he and he he proclaimed the
[59:12] end of the isua and Divine Healing
[59:15] Revival and by the end of his ministry
[59:19] um people were simply no longer
[59:22] enthralled wow the the FI had been
[59:25] crowded with every kind of gimmick of
[59:27] the Janice and jambre that had been done
[59:30] remember this is exactly what happened
[59:32] in the first Exodus you know Moses goes
[59:35] out he casts down his his rod and it
[59:38] becomes a serpent well here comes Janice
[59:41] and Jem Brees they cast down their rod
[59:43] and it does it too now you say how did
[59:45] that happen well I'll tell you how that
[59:47] happened by the power of God amen amen
[59:50] amen because Satan can't create Satan
[59:54] can't heal
[59:55] Satan can't do that so but by but there
[1:00:00] by by using the the the faith and the
[1:00:03] power of God here they impersonated what
[1:00:06] Moses
[1:00:08] did amen but what did it do it was to
[1:00:11] try to keep them in Egypt yes in bondage
[1:00:16] not set them at
[1:00:19] Liberty are you with me so you see this
[1:00:22] is exactly what had been done there
[1:00:24] there're rows of hundreds you know there
[1:00:27] that was impersonating using gimmicks
[1:00:30] everything else that they could do and
[1:00:33] um by 1956 brother Brandon prophesied
[1:00:37] that that year America would reject the
[1:00:39] gospel and it would begin a spiritual
[1:00:43] Decline and and then you know he
[1:00:47] actually and I don't remember what the
[1:00:50] new title is it used to be called
[1:00:52] visions and prophecy in 1956 but anyway
[1:00:55] um brother brandham talks about um that
[1:01:00] where that he mentions that the Revival
[1:01:03] is over and I believe that this year
[1:01:05] that America will either accept or
[1:01:08] reject the gospel now you have to listen
[1:01:11] to the tape to get this but when you
[1:01:14] listen to it after brother brandham says
[1:01:17] that it just breaks out into pandemonium
[1:01:21] where that there is speaking in tongues
[1:01:24] all over the building I mean all I mean
[1:01:28] hundreds of voices all at one time and
[1:01:32] unity began to speak in other
[1:01:35] tongues and and so as it does I just
[1:01:38] want to remind you now what what happens
[1:01:41] is here brother Brandon makes his
[1:01:43] prophecy here tongues break out in
[1:01:46] unison all over the building I mean
[1:01:50] hundreds at one time begin to speak in
[1:01:53] other tongues and brother brandham said
[1:01:55] U you know about this in the church age
[1:01:58] book he said now tongues isn't the
[1:02:01] evidence of Revival it is the evidence
[1:02:05] of death tongues proclaim the the
[1:02:08] evidence that the ceremonial religion of
[1:02:11] the Jews was over and a new era had
[1:02:14] begun tongues today is ringing down the
[1:02:18] curtain on the Gentile Church ages and
[1:02:21] the gospel is going back to the Jews
[1:02:24] people are talking about tongues
[1:02:26] heralding in a great spiritual move they
[1:02:29] have missed the boat the truth is that
[1:02:32] that it is writing the Finish to all of
[1:02:35] man's ideas programs and kingdoms and
[1:02:38] the kingdom of God is being ushered in
[1:02:41] wake up people of God wake up now of
[1:02:45] course that that doesn't mean that if
[1:02:47] you speak in tongues that's the evidence
[1:02:48] of death no that but all of this going
[1:02:52] on as it as he said tongues rain down
[1:02:55] the Gentile Kingdom you know what he's
[1:02:57] talking about because there in in Daniel
[1:03:01] when Daniel was there in the Kingdom of
[1:03:03] of um belzar what what happened a
[1:03:06] handwriting came on the wall and it was
[1:03:09] in other tongues yes right amen but it
[1:03:12] it would take a prophet now to identify
[1:03:16] what was being
[1:03:18] said is that right amen so you know it
[1:03:21] would even be so for us in this last day
[1:03:24] God said things even in the Book of
[1:03:26] Revelation in symbols and is wrote in
[1:03:29] symbols but nobody knows what it means
[1:03:33] until a prophet comes on the scene there
[1:03:36] again is written many many Te You Farson
[1:03:38] what's it mean this guesses that this
[1:03:40] guesses this this and guess another but
[1:03:42] when a prophet comes on the scene now
[1:03:44] the Revelation becomes made known what
[1:03:48] God had actually said you're weighed in
[1:03:49] the balance and found wanting now so
[1:03:52] again he there he would stand in Life
[1:03:56] Tabernacle in spport Louisiana and
[1:04:00] preach the invisible Union of the Bride
[1:04:03] directing his sermon to the church now
[1:04:05] you know a Life Tabernacle is still
[1:04:08] exists today it's um moved in its
[1:04:11] location from where brother Brandon
[1:04:12] preached but they're now just a little
[1:04:14] Charismatic Church they got actually a
[1:04:17] little museum inside uh of a room with
[1:04:21] paraphernalia of the of the Revival past
[1:04:24] of crutches and different um items you
[1:04:27] know and testimonies of people being
[1:04:29] healed and and things like that you know
[1:04:32] just a
[1:04:34] museum a memory of what the Revival used
[1:04:38] to
[1:04:39] be are you with me yes amen now so again
[1:04:44] you know he stood in Life Tabernacle
[1:04:47] preached the invisible Union of the
[1:04:49] Bride he directing his sermon to the
[1:04:51] church the body of Christ and he said
[1:04:54] believing that the coming of the Lord is
[1:04:55] at hand and he said much more it's it's
[1:04:59] 20 years closer than what it was the
[1:05:01] first time I came to sort that would
[1:05:03] have been 1946 the beginning of the
[1:05:05] Revival and so much has happened since
[1:05:08] that time now we're looking forward for
[1:05:11] the coming of the Lord in our generation
[1:05:14] I'm not looking for Revival in our
[1:05:16] generation I'm looking for the coming of
[1:05:19] the Lord in our
[1:05:21] generation so as as we as we look at
[1:05:25] that for a moment and examine his quote
[1:05:27] he was not looking for another worldwide
[1:05:31] Revival this had been declared
[1:05:34] over now I you know I was there in those
[1:05:37] meetings and I I will tell you there was
[1:05:40] still the the the discernment that was
[1:05:43] still calling out people and their name
[1:05:46] and their address and so on like that
[1:05:49] there was there was things that was
[1:05:50] still happening in the Supernatural
[1:05:52] realm but the the great the great um
[1:05:56] move of the spirit that were there were
[1:05:59] massive healings and deliverance it
[1:06:01] wasn't
[1:06:02] there you see the Revival had died down
[1:06:07] and the expectations of the people were
[1:06:10] H wow you know you know brother bram's a
[1:06:14] prophet but you know holding there hey I
[1:06:16] watched him in invisible Union of the
[1:06:18] Bride when brother brandham actually was
[1:06:21] speaking about how that women were
[1:06:23] living in dressing and men and so on
[1:06:25] like that in the condition of the world
[1:06:27] and and women you know poking one
[1:06:30] another and giggling and laughing at the
[1:06:32] prophet of God I watch people walk out
[1:06:35] of the
[1:06:37] meeting
[1:06:38] amen amen so you you see there was all
[1:06:42] kinds of things that that as the the
[1:06:45] Revival was being turned down you know
[1:06:47] they would have brother brandham just
[1:06:49] for the phenomenal of the gift but they
[1:06:52] didn't want to hear them
[1:06:55] message so you know he he was saying he
[1:06:58] said now uh as he said in Albuquerque
[1:07:01] and God hid himself in Simplicity now
[1:07:03] you hear me if you believe me to be a
[1:07:05] messenger sent from Christ to you you
[1:07:07] believe me if you're not in the kingdom
[1:07:09] of God you better press right quick it
[1:07:12] will not get better it will grow worse
[1:07:15] all the time just Mark that down just
[1:07:17] remember whether to see whether it's
[1:07:19] right or wrong you see if it's going to
[1:07:22] be right or wrong it's it's not going to
[1:07:24] get better it's going to get worse it's
[1:07:26] going to get harder all the time the
[1:07:28] Revival is gone you're only gleaning in
[1:07:31] the field she's over you say I disagree
[1:07:34] with that fine it's okay if you do
[1:07:37] that's all right that's my conviction
[1:07:39] that's my hearing from heaven and he
[1:07:41] said what we have entered into the the
[1:07:45] leoan age where it's lukewarm and God
[1:07:48] spews her from her mouth and he said you
[1:07:51] are in the spewing stage
[1:07:55] so remember we are here in the leoan
[1:07:59] age the lukewarmness of the lukewarm
[1:08:04] rather of Le oia is spewed out of the
[1:08:07] mouth of
[1:08:09] God for rejecting the Pentecostal
[1:08:18] message yes this message we have is the
[1:08:22] Pentecostal message
[1:08:24] it is the message Paul
[1:08:27] preached come on now we're not talking
[1:08:30] about Aus Street don't get confused they
[1:08:32] they were they were wrongly named
[1:08:37] Pentecost amen they are they are
[1:08:40] mislabeled Pentecost they are not
[1:08:42] Pentecost but they were actually an
[1:08:45] extension of the man age the eagle
[1:08:47] hadn't even come are you with me so
[1:08:50] remember we are in the aloan age where
[1:08:54] um where they are spewed out of the
[1:08:56] mouth of God for rejecting the
[1:08:59] Pentecostal message if if you listen to
[1:09:01] brother brandham in as he as a seventh
[1:09:05] angel taking the seventh Church age as
[1:09:08] he preached it the leoan church age he
[1:09:10] said you see as Rich have need of
[1:09:13] nothing but you have need of the
[1:09:15] greatest thing and haven't got it Jesus
[1:09:18] standing outside trying to get back in
[1:09:21] with
[1:09:22] Pentecost
[1:09:26] he said what would you think tonight in
[1:09:29] the Methodist Church and I want you to
[1:09:31] think message church if the Holy Ghost
[1:09:34] fell upon the church and they begin
[1:09:36] shouting and jumping and speaking in
[1:09:38] tongues and acting like drun bunch of
[1:09:40] drunk people why the conference would
[1:09:43] throw that Methodist Church out of the
[1:09:45] conference what would happen in the
[1:09:47] Baptist Church that that happen the same
[1:09:49] thing Pentecostal what there's many of
[1:09:52] them it's happened the same thing yes
[1:09:54] sir they wouldn't put they wouldn't put
[1:09:56] up with that nonsense they'd say wow
[1:09:58] they've even spoiled our new carpets
[1:10:00] uhhuh um what a miserable Bunch they are
[1:10:03] you see now sadly message churches today
[1:10:07] and I I'm speaking I'm still continues
[1:10:10] to speak to the ministers I speaking to
[1:10:13] and the audience not just this one here
[1:10:16] but you know listen here because
[1:10:18] whatever you do not want to be caught in
[1:10:20] a lukewarm condition amen wo
[1:10:25] amen amen because if so you'll be spew
[1:10:27] out of the mouth of God you will not
[1:10:29] speak for him you will not be his
[1:10:34] representative so sadly today message
[1:10:37] churches are not immune to this people
[1:10:39] are getting so hard and are not tens
[1:10:42] tender and sensitive to the holy spirit
[1:10:44] that they are
[1:10:46] absolutely lukewarm about it so brother
[1:10:50] Bron would tell us in the same sermon of
[1:10:52] invisible you he said you see she's
[1:10:55] pregnated with something because she's
[1:10:58] bringing forth members all the time she
[1:11:00] don't want none of them screaming
[1:11:02] hollering blabbering two acts 238
[1:11:05] miserable creatures that she thinks they
[1:11:08] are it would certainly embarrass her it
[1:11:11] would ruin her and her educated ethical
[1:11:14] scientific Society Church that she
[1:11:17] belongs to oh yeah amen so she don't
[1:11:20] want to be pregnated with the word
[1:11:23] because that's the only kind the word
[1:11:25] can bring forth that's right so the the
[1:11:29] church would actually become ashamed of
[1:11:32] the Pentecostal
[1:11:35] experience amen now so you see he he
[1:11:39] even said in the message is shamed he
[1:11:41] said the Revival amongst the churches is
[1:11:44] died everybody knows that you feel it in
[1:11:47] this Tabernacle and I just say you're
[1:11:49] going to feel it in your church all
[1:11:51] right amen you're going to feel it
[1:11:52] everywhere
[1:11:54] amen there's a thump a dead feeling it's
[1:11:57] just something that isn't right is
[1:11:58] because Revival enthusiasm has gone away
[1:12:02] from the people you go into churches
[1:12:04] you'll see them sitting there and the
[1:12:07] pastor stumbling around for a message or
[1:12:09] something another and the first thing
[1:12:11] you know he's turned off on some kind of
[1:12:13] party they're going to have or something
[1:12:14] it just seem to be a dead thump
[1:12:16] everywhere but I'm going to tell you
[1:12:18] friends somebody's going to overcome
[1:12:22] this amen because even when he said I'm
[1:12:25] going to spew him out of my mouth he
[1:12:27] also said him that
[1:12:30] overcometh so God's going to have
[1:12:32] Overcomers in this age somebody's going
[1:12:35] to rise above the lethargic they Osa luk
[1:12:39] War condition and they're going to have
[1:12:42] an enthusiasm for this message and a
[1:12:45] desire to serve God with all of their
[1:12:49] heart
[1:12:51] Hallelujah yes sir now many times
[1:12:54] because of the lack of the spirit men
[1:12:57] are turning to
[1:12:59] psychology to put
[1:13:01] bandaids on sin
[1:13:04] problems yes are you with me so as he
[1:13:09] says and the world Fallen apart but the
[1:13:12] church set spiritually dead gone the
[1:13:14] hours past them they're in a slump
[1:13:16] hardly know what to do one running this
[1:13:18] way one that way and hear every promise
[1:13:21] that God made in the Bible every one of
[1:13:24] them is laying there just as good as
[1:13:25] they ever was it's the hour what makes
[1:13:28] the church like this it's the we're in
[1:13:30] the leoan age or the age of Leo deia
[1:13:33] when she got to come this way so is
[1:13:37] there hope for
[1:13:39] Revival is there Revival for the bride
[1:13:43] or will God just Rapture us in our
[1:13:46] lukewarm condition that makes him sick
[1:13:49] no move of the spirit no Spiritual
[1:13:52] Awakening and that just because that we
[1:13:55] sit on a message Pew we're just
[1:13:57] automatically going into
[1:14:02] Rapture
[1:14:04] now as he said I'm not looking for
[1:14:07] Revival in our generation I'm looking
[1:14:09] for the coming of the Lord now so I want
[1:14:11] you to understand the bride's Revival is
[1:14:15] the coming of the Lord yes sir yes now
[1:14:20] so in this he makes a distinction
[1:14:23] between the bride and the church he said
[1:14:26] some of you that really believe this to
[1:14:28] be the truth that we're entered into
[1:14:31] another Age We entering to the rapturing
[1:14:34] age you know the church can't go in this
[1:14:37] condition and it can't get any better it
[1:14:40] must get worse how many knows that now
[1:14:43] that's the church amen it's get worse it
[1:14:46] can't go like this see it's got to be
[1:14:49] something that's moving right now friend
[1:14:51] it's on the move is is own for the bride
[1:14:55] that's the truth th thus sayith the
[1:14:59] Lord amen amen so the church goes into
[1:15:04] decline remember vision of the Bride the
[1:15:07] church goes down the bride goes
[1:15:10] up amen this is the time of the
[1:15:15] Ascension amen as the as a as the world
[1:15:18] is falling as Satan falls from heaven
[1:15:22] come on Church as our society is falling
[1:15:25] all around us in that moment there's a
[1:15:28] bride
[1:15:29] [Applause]
[1:15:31] ascending
[1:15:33] hallelujah amen Revelation 12 shows
[1:15:37] Satan cast down the bride going up as he
[1:15:40] comes down the bride goes up as hell
[1:15:43] comes down up on the earth amen we are
[1:15:46] moving toward Heavenly
[1:15:48] [Applause]
[1:15:51] rounds I'm not looking for for Revival
[1:15:53] in our generation I'm looking for the
[1:15:55] coming of the
[1:15:57] Lord
[1:15:58] yes okay but you realize that the coming
[1:16:03] of the Lord comes first as the word to a
[1:16:06] prophet yes absolutely that's
[1:16:10] the amen this is this is the mystery of
[1:16:14] his
[1:16:15] coming amen behold I show you a mystery
[1:16:19] it happened in
[1:16:21] phases are you with me amen so then then
[1:16:25] of course but that ain't all of it it
[1:16:26] ain't all just God sending us a message
[1:16:29] and glory to God we got new Theology and
[1:16:31] we got new understanding it's not just
[1:16:33] that amen but now then the word must
[1:16:37] take on
[1:16:39] flesh of people who eat the book and
[1:16:42] become the word and speak the
[1:16:48] word so you see it must then take on
[1:16:51] flesh and be in full fully manifested in
[1:16:54] Bride
[1:16:56] form and then finally and
[1:17:00] ultimately to meet the Lord in the
[1:17:03] air shout voice and
[1:17:06] Trump now you know we we know the we
[1:17:09] know the shout is a message Gathering
[1:17:11] the people together bringing them back
[1:17:13] to the word amen Revelation 101 shows
[1:17:18] the mighty Angel comes down and what
[1:17:20] does he do amen he cries with a loud
[1:17:23] voice he's not weeping he's not snotting
[1:17:26] you know he is
[1:17:29] shouting right he shouts with a loud
[1:17:35] voice amen now so so again he would
[1:17:38] Shout with a loud voice and when he
[1:17:42] shouts when the message come seven
[1:17:45] Thunders utter their
[1:17:49] voices amen mysteries of God that have
[1:17:52] been held up sealed away to this last
[1:17:55] day become
[1:17:57] revealed now so again he shouts with a
[1:18:00] loud voice notice again the the the next
[1:18:04] phase of the Rapture is from shout is
[1:18:07] voice and it's the voice of the
[1:18:10] Archangel yes yes now scripturally go to
[1:18:14] me go with me anywhere and where are you
[1:18:16] going to see the voice of the Archangel
[1:18:18] except in Revelation
[1:18:21] 10 because in re ration 10 there the
[1:18:25] mighty Angel listen he comes down and
[1:18:28] does what he hands the book to the
[1:18:32] people so that they might prophesy again
[1:18:36] and become the voice when a church is
[1:18:39] being spewed out of the mouth of God for
[1:18:42] their
[1:18:44] lukewarmness because they made God sick
[1:18:47] and they rejected his gospel somebody
[1:18:49] help me preach amen while they are cast
[1:18:52] out the mouth of God there is another
[1:18:55] who is the mouth of God and they are the
[1:18:58] final voice to the final
[1:19:00] [Applause]
[1:19:02] age
[1:19:04] amen so it takes the fullness of the
[1:19:07] word to produce a bride a mature bride
[1:19:11] yeah Christ came in word form to the
[1:19:13] prophet but now the word must make a
[1:19:17] progression you say well I've seen God
[1:19:19] send a prophet I I listen to the tapes
[1:19:21] and I believe it's the message okay but
[1:19:23] that can't remain on
[1:19:27] shape amen you sure that's where the
[1:19:30] voice of God was that's where it sounded
[1:19:33] from but the days of the seventh angel
[1:19:36] and his voice is over with he's no
[1:19:38] longer bringing a new sermon from
[1:19:40] Jeffersonville and a new message God God
[1:19:43] that voice is now silenced not that we
[1:19:46] don't have it tape listen I can say the
[1:19:48] same thing about Paul Paul's not here
[1:19:51] preaching amen
[1:19:53] amen but but we still have his
[1:19:56] recordings but that's not Paul's message
[1:19:59] he's not bringing a new revelation or
[1:20:02] bringing a new expounding are you with
[1:20:04] me the same thing happens that and the
[1:20:07] same thing it changes now from the
[1:20:10] prophet to his
[1:20:12] prophecy that's
[1:20:14] right and his prophecy listen this this
[1:20:18] was never about God sending a Prophet
[1:20:22] this was about what God had in his mind
[1:20:25] before the world began and that was that
[1:20:29] he the lonely God wanted a
[1:20:35] family Hallelujah and everything he's
[1:20:38] ever done has been for that motive and
[1:20:41] purpose that God would have a family and
[1:20:45] God is determined he will have a bride
[1:20:47] without spot without a wrinkle without a
[1:20:50] blemish or any such thing
[1:20:56] I may I may need three
[1:20:58] sessions
[1:21:00] hallelujah
[1:21:01] amen now so the coming of the Lord would
[1:21:06] require that he come as word
[1:21:09] first because unless the word is
[1:21:12] restored there's nothing to make a bride
[1:21:14] out
[1:21:15] of because she's got to be a word
[1:21:18] bride is that right so then the word
[1:21:22] come restored but that's not remember
[1:21:25] it's the restoration of the brid tree
[1:21:28] yes yes now and then finally it comes
[1:21:32] manifested in Groom form where we meet
[1:21:35] him in the air listen don't ever ever
[1:21:39] forget if if if it doesn't materialize
[1:21:44] in the coming of the Lord Jesus where we
[1:21:46] meet the physical Lord
[1:21:49] Jesus in glorified bodies this has all
[1:21:53] just been air castles and pipe
[1:21:59] dreams our ultimate goal is to meet
[1:22:02] Jesus but to meet him we got to be
[1:22:05] dressed to meet
[1:22:07] him
[1:22:08] amen amen you've going to have to be
[1:22:11] dressed to meet you don't want to meet
[1:22:12] him in spotted garments amen spotted
[1:22:16] with sin you can't do it you're going to
[1:22:19] have to be
[1:22:20] ready I remember you know we live in a
[1:22:23] small town and it's yeah and our our our

[1:25:10] Darkness yes where there's weeping and
[1:25:13] wailing and nashing of
[1:25:16] teeth Great
[1:25:19] Tribulation says becoming begins with
[1:25:22] return of Christ the
[1:25:24] word and the message
[1:25:28] absolute and and I in some ways I wish I
[1:25:32] could have put this on the screen but
[1:25:34] it's from the message absolute it's
[1:25:37] paragraph 225 and 6 but um brother
[1:25:41] brandham says his this 1621 12-30 but he
[1:25:46] says I remember when he swept down in
[1:25:49] that big light Yonder standing Yonder at
[1:25:51] the bottom of the River 1933 in
[1:25:54] June he said as John the Baptist was
[1:25:57] sent forth and forun the first coming of
[1:26:00] Christ I send you with a message to the
[1:26:03] world to forerun the second coming of
[1:26:05] Christ and around the world she's went I
[1:26:08] want you to watch the language she's
[1:26:11] went he's talking about his ministry
[1:26:13] when Revival fires has been built for 15
[1:26:17] years on nearly every Mountain Divine
[1:26:20] Healing Across the Nation and the power
[1:26:23] and restoration now this is where he
[1:26:25] says where where people have taken and I
[1:26:28] think it was in the Nugget book it
[1:26:29] started out you know where with brother
[1:26:32] Jack Palmer making his notes in this
[1:26:34] that Rapture and Faith lays on the tapes
[1:26:36] but that's not what it says there's no
[1:26:39] quote that says that all right and I'm
[1:26:41] not even going to argue with you that
[1:26:42] Rapture and Faith isn't in the message I
[1:26:44] believe we have a Rapture Revelation yes
[1:26:47] but that's not what this quote says so
[1:26:50] he say he says and I believe she's
[1:26:53] watch's this is ready to strike that
[1:26:56] final climax Yonder to bring forth a
[1:27:00] faith that will Rapture the church into
[1:27:02] glory and she's laying in the
[1:27:05] messages so he's talking about his
[1:27:08] ministry and he has been laying in
[1:27:10] sermon after sermon after sermon hey you
[1:27:13] can do something all right let's try
[1:27:16] yeah there you go got amen I knew Matt
[1:27:19] Watkins come through for me
[1:27:22] so now so let's just look at this now
[1:27:25] now I believe she's ready to strike that
[1:27:29] final climax I'm go back to the next
[1:27:31] paragraph I want you to see this because
[1:27:34] he says around the world she's
[1:27:38] went when Revival so what's his language
[1:27:41] what's he talking about his ministry has
[1:27:44] now caused Revival fires to be buil for
[1:27:48] 15 years on nearly every Mountain Divine
[1:27:51] Healing across the Nations and the power
[1:27:54] and restoration and now I believe she
[1:27:57] speaking about his ministry is ready to
[1:28:00] strike that final climax Yonder to bring
[1:28:04] forth a faith that a Rapture the church
[1:28:07] in the glory and she's laying in the
[1:28:09] messages he's preached the church ages
[1:28:12] Daniel 70 weeks statue of a perfect man
[1:28:15] wisdom versus Faith restoration of the
[1:28:17] brid tree he just been laying one sermon
[1:28:20] after another building a v Foundation
[1:28:23] yes are you with me and we're really at
[1:28:26] the end time we've talked about it and
[1:28:29] everything but the thing is moved upon
[1:28:31] us now yeah yes sir here's one that's
[1:28:35] right okay so you see the the quote
[1:28:37] there we're really in the end time and
[1:28:40] he says I believe she's ready to strike
[1:28:43] that final climax I want you to get this
[1:28:46] we are in the final
[1:28:50] climax it's the final climax for the
[1:28:54] Gentiles for the world history oh yeah
[1:28:57] it's the final climax for the
[1:28:59] Bride of Seven Ages we are in the final
[1:29:04] climax amen and he said he would bring
[1:29:07] forth a faith that would Rapture the
[1:29:09] church for striking that final climax
[1:29:12] even in his ministry because now you
[1:29:16] know all of the Divine Healing movement
[1:29:18] had done was prepared the way he called
[1:29:22] it the former rain or the teaching rain
[1:29:25] so that the latter rain could
[1:29:27] follow and the latter rain would begin
[1:29:30] Now with an outpouring of the spirit but
[1:29:33] now it's coming in a way it's a mystery
[1:29:36] that the world is missing is coming
[1:29:39] because it's coming as
[1:29:41] word that's
[1:29:43] first a message
[1:29:47] first but it's Vindicated what the power
[1:29:51] that lays in that
[1:29:52] message with W with healing with
[1:29:56] salvation had he writes children with
[1:29:59] with the tumor with sister brandham on
[1:30:01] and on and on the the SP the creation of
[1:30:04] of squirrels you know what I'm talking
[1:30:06] about all of these one thing after
[1:30:08] another the speaking to the squirrels of
[1:30:11] the squirrels and the speaking to the
[1:30:12] storm all of these things that happens
[1:30:15] what to show us the power that's right
[1:30:19] that lays in the open
[1:30:25] book I'll tell you what I believe we
[1:30:27] have untapped
[1:30:29] resources sir we haven't even begun to
[1:30:34] discover the power that lays in this
[1:30:37] word this is a word that created the
[1:30:40] world and created the heavens and the
[1:30:43] Earth come on and that same word has
[1:30:47] power in it this morning to transform
[1:30:50] you from a sinner to a saint
[1:30:52] or to Quicken your mortal body and you
[1:30:55] be healed or Quicken your mortal body
[1:30:57] and Rapture
[1:30:59] you
[1:31:01] [Applause]
[1:31:05] Hallelujah now brother brandham said
[1:31:08] again in perseverance 62 he said I I
[1:31:12] believe the Revival's over he said the
[1:31:14] Revival doesn't lasts very long this
[1:31:17] been going on 15 to 16 years but he says
[1:31:20] it's the last Revival but I believe the
[1:31:23] next so next Revival will be pulling the
[1:31:27] church the elect from the
[1:31:29] groups and take them together and away
[1:31:32] it will go and we're looking for it to
[1:31:36] happen so the next Revival would be as
[1:31:40] he had the third pull Vision you know
[1:31:43] you know the next Revival would be
[1:31:44] catching the Covenant people the rainbow
[1:31:48] trout am are you with me so you see but
[1:31:52] we can see the Revival fires are burning
[1:31:54] down Lo so that Revival has died but
[1:31:58] there is another
[1:32:01] Revival that is going on come on that
[1:32:05] this one has made the way far that's
[1:32:08] right listen you couldn't have any
[1:32:11] confidence you well I tell you what it's
[1:32:12] the word that brought me to this message
[1:32:14] okay I I get that I understand that but
[1:32:17] listen if it had not been for the
[1:32:18] Vindication first you would have never
[1:32:22] you it would have never been known
[1:32:24] that's right that's right amen amen now
[1:32:29] so brother Brandon when he comes to the
[1:32:30] third seal he says he says this maybe
[1:32:35] smart man can bring this up again this
[1:32:38] third seal paragraph 182 that's the
[1:32:41] reason today the revivals we're supposed
[1:32:44] to have we have denominational revivals
[1:32:48] we haven't had a real stirring so he
[1:32:51] looks back back and he says okay now
[1:32:53] what has happened and he would explain
[1:32:55] it question answer 64 he said I actually
[1:32:59] he said I actually won millions of
[1:33:01] people and and and he said um 3/4 of a
[1:33:05] million of my converts went to the
[1:33:07] Assembly of God and then to others they
[1:33:10] just became denominational Christians so
[1:33:13] what's what he says now we haven't add a
[1:33:15] real St no no no no don't no sir don't
[1:33:18] think we got revivals we haven't oh they
[1:33:21] got millions and millions and millions
[1:33:23] of church members but not a Revival
[1:33:25] nowhere now it's all just died
[1:33:28] down and but we got church members out
[1:33:31] of
[1:33:32] it now listen God wants more than there
[1:33:37] just to be Buford
[1:33:40] Tabernacle or bethl Tabernacle he wants
[1:33:43] more than just another message church
[1:33:45] here and that that's he's not looking
[1:33:47] for buildings he's not looking for
[1:33:50] groups he not going to Rapture this
[1:33:53] church he's going to Rapture individuals
[1:33:56] out of this
[1:33:57] [Applause]
[1:33:59] church and if you're not ready you're
[1:34:02] going to be left behind that's right if
[1:34:03] you just decide you're just going to
[1:34:05] stay lukewarm you're going to be left
[1:34:06] behind there some of you ain't going
[1:34:09] you're going to miss the
[1:34:17] boat well I don't like that Brother D
[1:34:20] well amen that's what it was in Noah's
[1:34:22] day that's right yes yes you either got
[1:34:25] on the boat or you didn't make it that's
[1:34:27] right amen you either walked out with
[1:34:30] lot amen and and that type walked out
[1:34:32] with lot or you didn't you burning the
[1:34:34] fire yes yes one or the other so we he
[1:34:38] said we've had denominational revivals
[1:34:40] we hadn't had a real stirring no no no
[1:34:43] no sir no don't think we got revivals we
[1:34:45] have oh they got millions and millions
[1:34:47] and millions of church members but not a
[1:34:49] Revival nowhere he he says again and and
[1:34:53] just hold that right up for me he says
[1:34:56] oh we hear Revival this is just once
[1:34:59] more Lord in 63 we yeah we have
[1:35:02] denominational Revival getting more
[1:35:04] members in and things like that but look
[1:35:07] at the
[1:35:08] morals it's constantly
[1:35:11] decaying look how further and further
[1:35:13] away from God they're getting all the
[1:35:15] time getting away from the
[1:35:18] word
[1:35:20] amen so now he goes on to this next
[1:35:23] statement and and and we're going to
[1:35:26] cover this the bride hasn't had a
[1:35:31] Revival
[1:35:32] yet so now we've had a Revival among the
[1:35:36] church and you know and and the the
[1:35:39] miraculous being done but the bride
[1:35:42] hasn't had a Revival there's been no
[1:35:45] Revival there no manifestation of God
[1:35:49] disturb the bride yet right now they
[1:35:52] were stirred people
[1:35:54] actually they would they if you went to
[1:35:57] a brandom meeting buddy they they were
[1:35:58] in the in their six hours before service
[1:36:01] started they they wanted the best seat
[1:36:04] and you know they would even take their
[1:36:05] lunch in the church or slip out and get
[1:36:08] it while somebody held her I mean they
[1:36:11] camped out in there when the doors open
[1:36:13] look out you'd get run
[1:36:15] over yeah now but you
[1:36:19] see but but watch it stirred people and
[1:36:23] they got stirred up and revived and they
[1:36:26] become members of a church yeah yes good
[1:36:30] people maybe quit smoking or drinking or
[1:36:34] nice families or this or that but the
[1:36:37] bride hadn't had a Revival no
[1:36:39] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[1:36:43] yet we're looking for it it will take
[1:36:46] those seven unknown Thunders back there
[1:36:48] to wake her up again he will send it he
[1:36:52] promised it now what she was dead so you
[1:36:55] know here again he brings it on down and
[1:36:58] then he says if the churches would just
[1:37:00] forget their Creeds and forget their
[1:37:02] dogmas and and and just take the Bible
[1:37:04] and plead the promise it become affected
[1:37:06] to them but but see Jesus said your
[1:37:09] Traditions make the word of God non
[1:37:11] affected to well the same thing today
[1:37:13] with spiritual Eve the spiritual bride
[1:37:15] today so-called Church she takes the
[1:37:17] word of God and she won't accept it and
[1:37:19] she accepts dogmas and Stu said
[1:37:22] therefore the word is not effective to
[1:37:24] her because she tries to inject her
[1:37:27] Creed with the word and it won't
[1:37:33] work do you know what Creed means anyway
[1:37:36] it's not a bad word it means I believe
[1:37:38] what I
[1:37:39] believe and and this is what how we have
[1:37:42] hybridized the
[1:37:43] message with many of us putting in what
[1:37:46] we
[1:37:49] think and it and it'ss that what I think
[1:37:54] into the with the word and it won't work
[1:37:57] that's
[1:37:58] right in fact what it does it brings a
[1:38:00] false
[1:38:03] Revival with with a new self-proclaimed
[1:38:07] King building a
[1:38:10] kingdom now so he talks about Herald of
[1:38:13] his coming and if you'll just hold that
[1:38:17] right there on that Revival I'm going to
[1:38:19] come back to that for a moment now now
[1:38:21] he talked about the herald of his coming
[1:38:23] and he said how that you know I know
[1:38:24] those people they're wonderful people
[1:38:26] they you know they're always praying and
[1:38:29] and calling on God well if you said this
[1:38:31] brother and sister Moore you know they I
[1:38:33] know them they're they're good people
[1:38:35] and so on they're always crying out you
[1:38:37] know uh about Revival and um you think
[1:38:43] that was Jack Moore no it wasn't Jack
[1:38:45] Moore it was out from Los Angeles there
[1:38:49] in California it started in The Herald
[1:38:51] of his coming started back in
[1:38:53] 1941 with Willard SE and Sarah Sarah Fox
[1:38:57] Moore they traveled and held meetings
[1:38:59] and Brother Moore teaching on prayer and
[1:39:01] overcoming life and Gathering people to
[1:39:03] prayer and they had this magazine that
[1:39:05] they sent out and brother Bram reading
[1:39:08] this magazine said I I read it and world
[1:39:10] falling apart he said that that the
[1:39:12] church has cried the loudest what are we

[1:39:20] Revival in our time back this that the
[1:39:22] other what are they what are they
[1:39:24] looking for to do it what more do you
[1:39:26] want what does the church want anyhow
[1:39:29] we've already got
[1:39:31] it God gave it to us his promise for his
[1:39:34] hour we look in the Bible we see it
[1:39:36] everywhere Through the Bible anointed
[1:39:37] ones come on and make the word live
[1:39:39] again right in the hour for that hour
[1:39:41] and we've got the
[1:39:43] Messiah yes and this is him the word in
[1:39:47] the beginning was the word the word was
[1:39:49] with God the Word was God and and the
[1:39:51] word remains God Hebrews 16 and8 the

[1:39:58] this day we're one a messiah and God
[1:40:00] gave us the Messiah his promised word
[1:40:03] for this day is waiting for
[1:40:06] somebody with faith to anoint it and
[1:40:10] make it live again yes sir it's a real
[1:40:14] Messiah it's the word of God which Jesus
[1:40:16] said both heavens and earth will pass
[1:40:18] away but my word shall never but the
[1:40:20] church say spiritually dead gone the
[1:40:23] hour is past them they're in the slump

[1:40:36] the age of Leo deia she has to come this
[1:40:40] way this is the hour for
[1:40:42] it so now again he would refer to the
[1:40:46] same thing the editor of this and
[1:40:49] recognizing your day and this message

[1:41:48] pull of the hour but they hadn't
[1:41:49] recognize what's been
[1:41:51] done and that's what's making them feel
[1:41:54] that way and they're looking for
[1:41:56] something supposed to happen they're

[1:45:59] Thunders back there to wake her up again
[1:46:02] these Thunders is what's going to take
[1:46:04] to wake her up yes yes now so the seven
[1:46:09] Thunders have sounded amen and I hurt I
[1:46:12] hate to hurt anybody's feelings but they
[1:46:15] had nothing to do with the Seven
[1:46:19] Virtues
[1:46:20] absolutely nothing to do with the Seven
[1:46:24] Virtues amen amen oh well you got to
[1:46:28] have the Seven Virtues yeah you need to
[1:46:30] add your faith virtue knowledge
[1:46:32] Temperance patience whatever amen be and
[1:46:35] be filled with the Holy
[1:46:37] Ghost amen but all that's important but
[1:46:40] it has nothing to do with seven
[1:46:43] Thunders amen for how could Peter write
[1:46:46] what John was forbidden
[1:46:49] to am what a good amen now actually that
[1:46:54] came to me when I was about before I got
[1:46:57] married I was out on the Hayfield and
[1:46:59] you know that some of the brothers came
[1:47:01] down from south Louisiana and they had
[1:47:03] all you know jumped into this clan of
[1:47:06] seven Thunders and oh we got a seven
[1:47:08] Thunders Revival and and and and and I
[1:47:10] was out raking
[1:47:12] ay and and my dad was Baal and I The
[1:47:17] Rake I had I had to make was a single
[1:47:20] file rake you make one wind row it makes
[1:47:23] half you turn around you come back and
[1:47:25] and pile it on the other and you make
[1:47:26] one wind row and then the Bor comes
[1:47:28] along bails a hey and we're taught you
[1:47:30] know you make hay when the sun shines so
[1:47:32] we're in a hurry so here I look and I
[1:47:34] see this preacher comes walking across
[1:47:36] the field you know and he Flags me down
[1:47:39] on the
[1:47:40] tractor and he he said Hey brother Tim I
[1:47:43] just want you to know we just got the
[1:47:45] revelation of the seven Thunder system
[1:47:47] you did well great I said what a oh well
[1:47:52] that's wonderful I said there're they're
[1:47:53] to give Rapture in faith for the going
[1:47:55] away so uh uh what are these Thunders
[1:47:58] well he said you know that in what Peter
[1:48:00] said you know add your virtue Faith
[1:48:02] virgin Virg knowledge knowledge
[1:48:03] Temperance Temperance patience yeah yeah
[1:48:05] I said okay he said well when these
[1:48:06] Thunder out of your life God's going to
[1:48:08] cap you off with a with a cap us off and
[1:48:11] we're going to go into Rapture but what
[1:48:12] they was really preaching was no one had
[1:48:14] the Holy
[1:48:16] Ghost so once you ever get good enough
[1:48:19] God would finally feel you and You' be
[1:48:20] finally in the Statue of a perfect man
[1:48:22] and these things had to be thundering
[1:48:24] out of your life so then God would seal
[1:48:26] you and until then you got to work a
[1:48:28] little more so it kept the people in
[1:48:32] bondage in slavery trying to be good
[1:48:35] enough to get what God has given us by
[1:48:40] Grace
[1:48:42] amen are you with me so here here he
[1:48:45] comes again as we as we as I I said will
[1:48:48] you see that man behind me that's right
[1:48:51] he said yeah I I said that's my dad on a
[1:48:53] Bor and I said we got to make hay when
[1:48:56] sunshines see you
[1:48:58] later and I left him standing in the
[1:49:01] field and I started
[1:49:03] rean and as I go to rean hey I'm
[1:49:05] thinking about what he said and the
[1:49:06] spirit of God speaks to me says how
[1:49:08] could Peter write what John was
[1:49:10] forbidden to wow
[1:49:16] wow amen and and you see it kept me from
[1:49:20] a cult
[1:49:21] movement where they made a man a deity
[1:49:25] where they made him a apostle to clarify
[1:49:27] what the prophet bring Clarity to what
[1:49:29] the prophet said this message does not
[1:49:31] need man's
[1:49:33] Clarity God said it the way he wanted it
[1:49:37] that's right and he wants you to say it
[1:49:39] the way he said it and you to believe
[1:49:42] it that's right that's right so the
[1:49:45] message of Malachi 4 will the messenger
[1:49:48] of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is
[1:49:51] going to do two things one according to
[1:49:53] Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the
[1:49:56] children to the fathers two he will
[1:49:58] reveal the mysteries of the seven
[1:50:00] thunders in Revelations 10 which are the
[1:50:04] revelations contained in the Seven Seals
[1:50:07] it will be these divinely mystery
[1:50:10] revealed truths that literally turn the
[1:50:13] hearts of the children to the
[1:50:15] Pentecostal fathers all I say is just go
[1:50:18] listen to what is he you know it used to
[1:50:20] be CES at the time they didn't change
[1:50:22] the titles what is the sign of the ERS
[1:50:26] so you know again they you just go
[1:50:29] listen to that again and brother bram's
[1:50:32] going west to meet with seven angels to
[1:50:35] get the revelation of seven Thunders and
[1:50:37] he comes back and preaches Seven Seals
[1:50:41] yes amen so so what what was his
[1:50:45] commission go there get the revelation
[1:50:47] of the seven Thunders and he comes back
[1:50:50] and preaches them and night after night
[1:50:54] the angel of God comes into his
[1:50:58] room and there in the presence of that
[1:51:01] ball of fire amen Revelation comes I was
[1:51:06] just going to say what the other
[1:51:07] theologians have said and I thought that
[1:51:09] was good idea and it sounded good to me
[1:51:12] but about that time he came in the room
[1:51:15] and changed my thinking
[1:51:18] hall hallelujah I want you to know the
[1:51:21] message we have received is not from a
[1:51:24] man it is from the angel of his
[1:51:28] presence
[1:51:30] amen amen we're not following a man
[1:51:33] we're following the message of an angel
[1:51:36] of
[1:51:37] God true well you said well John Smith
[1:51:40] got that and he started the Mormons well
[1:51:42] let me tell you this is no John Smith we
[1:51:44] did not have to write a new
[1:51:47] Bible we didn't even have to do like
[1:51:49] Jehovah witness and go and reinterpret
[1:51:51] the Bible to make it say what we wanted
[1:51:53] to say in our own
[1:51:55] version amen we didn't even need a new
[1:51:58] Bible like that amen but what it did
[1:52:02] what it did was not a new Bible not a
[1:52:04] different Bible not an addition to the
[1:52:06] Bible not not something extra amen but
[1:52:10] revealing the same
[1:52:13] gospel that Paul
[1:52:15] preached coming back with the same
[1:52:18] mystery truths
[1:52:20] so that there could be a bride here in
[1:52:23] the end time that would be exactly like
[1:52:25] the bride at the beginning amen yes sir
[1:52:30] cuz God started a church the way he
[1:52:32] wanted it now he wants the church the
[1:52:35] way he started
[1:52:37] it
[1:52:39] amen now again have the seven Thunders
[1:52:43] which equal seven Mysteries been
[1:52:44] revealed were they revealed in the Seven
[1:52:46] Seals but not yet known to us as
[1:52:48] Thunders yet no
[1:52:50] they were revealed in the seals that's
[1:52:53] what the Thunders was about amen amen
[1:52:58] once they were sealed voices now they
[1:53:00] are known
[1:53:01] voices amen am so let's let's stop just
[1:53:05] for a moment they were once sealed up
[1:53:08] now God had to write it in the word so
[1:53:12] he wrote it in symbols yes so the first
[1:53:15] seal opens and here's the symbol what is
[1:53:18] it a white horse rider right well who is
[1:53:22] it uh one Theologian says Christ another
[1:53:26] said an well wonder what happen um one
[1:53:29] says um back here or there uh somewhere
[1:53:32] in the tribulation they'll ride ahead
[1:53:35] all kinds of ideas yes it's kind of like
[1:53:37] in the days of Daniel I was talking
[1:53:39] about something was wrote and it was
[1:53:41] wrote in symbols yes many many tle you
[1:53:45] Farson but nobody knows what it means
[1:53:48] it's a symbols a handwriting on the wall
[1:53:51] speaking in tongues on the wall yes but
[1:53:55] what does it mean I don't know it's
[1:53:56] speaking in tongues to
[1:53:58] me well what does it mean that book of
[1:54:00] Revelation I don't know it's speaking in
[1:54:02] tongues to
[1:54:04] me what does it mean I you know Patrick
[1:54:07] you know not Patrick Matthew Henry you
[1:54:10] know he's got his
[1:54:12] idea who was it Swiss um um apocalypse
[1:54:16] and they got their idea and lens's got
[1:54:19] his idea
[1:54:20] this others got their ideas and they all
[1:54:22] lay out their
[1:54:24] ideas one was just as good
[1:54:26] another yes once suser comes up well oh
[1:54:31] King I think it means this well you know
[1:54:33] say you had a little problem you said I
[1:54:36] think so you really don't know do you no
[1:54:39] sir I really don't but I I think well
[1:54:42] other said well but I I think it I think
[1:54:44] it might mean this I think and another
[1:54:46] comes finally said listen
[1:54:50] this is a much of
[1:54:51] confusion nobody knows what it is and
[1:54:54] there's a hand that's written on the
[1:54:56] wall well but there is a prophet in the
[1:54:59] land let's call the prophet yes so they
[1:55:03] called Daniel and Daniel looks up and
[1:55:05] and said okay here's what the symbol
[1:55:07] means many many tle you far you you're
[1:55:11] weighed in the balance and you're found
[1:55:13] wanting right so you see this is exactly
[1:55:17] what God did in our day we had every
[1:55:19] body probing at the book everybody's
[1:55:23] guest and your guess was as good as mine
[1:55:26] and yeah that's plausible and yeah I
[1:55:29] think that's a good educated guess but
[1:55:31] friends this is no educated guess
[1:55:35] amen Amen brother amen this is not even
[1:55:38] a seventh grade kian's idea that's right
[1:55:42] amen this is something Way Beyond that
[1:55:45] this is from the very Mindy God the one
[1:55:47] spoke it
[1:55:51] sad now this symbol that it wrode forth
[1:55:56] is is now not Christ he is the
[1:56:01] Antichrist and here he progresses from
[1:56:05] that gets bloodied with the sword and
[1:56:07] red and then the black with the Dark
[1:56:09] Ages and then finally to the pale and
[1:56:12] then he begins to place others who are
[1:56:15] in the
[1:56:16] book people we didn't know who was in
[1:56:18] the book Martyrs slain under the Jewish
[1:56:21] and the Jewish dispensation I mean the
[1:56:23] Gentile dispensation and God said I
[1:56:25] hadn't forgot
[1:56:27] them they stood for the testimony they
[1:56:29] knew are they held yes and I give them
[1:56:32] white robe just be Qui until the rest of
[1:56:34] them the 144,000 are slain like you amen
[1:56:38] then it breaks into the Sixth Seal and
[1:56:39] what is it a multitude without number
[1:56:41] come out of Great Tribulation some said
[1:56:44] it was a bride some say even brother
[1:56:46] brandham thought it was a bride but he
[1:56:47] comes along by revelation and he says
[1:56:50] it's not the bride at all it's the
[1:56:51] church she goes through this Great
[1:56:55] Tribulation that's
[1:56:57] right amen then the 144,000 aren't you
[1:57:01] glad aren't you glad aren't you glad
[1:57:05] this was place for us yes when Joshua
[1:57:08] goes into the land brother Jason God
[1:57:10] says okay leave Mount sier alone that's
[1:57:13] not yours leave Moab that's the children
[1:57:16] of Lot leave them alone children of Esau
[1:57:19] the children of Lot leave them alone
[1:57:20] that's I've given them that yes but
[1:57:24] that's not your inheritance and he
[1:57:26] defines the inheritance for Israel and
[1:57:31] says here okay here is our
[1:57:34] borders here's what belongs to don't you
[1:57:37] know you don't have to try to be the
[1:57:39] tribulation Saints you don't have to
[1:57:41] worry about that you don't have to be
[1:57:43] the
[1:57:44] 144,000 you know who you are because why
[1:57:48] God set you in in the land and said now
[1:57:51] every promise that pertains to the
[1:57:54] Gentile bride is
[1:57:57] yours possess itall if healing in it
[1:58:01] possess it if the Holy Ghost is in it
[1:58:04] possess it amen whatever it is Miracles
[1:58:08] possess it Mysteries possess
[1:58:12] it it's
[1:58:14] yours go take
[1:58:15] it so the move is on for the bride
[1:58:18] that's thus sayith the
[1:58:21] Lord but notice
[1:58:25] now notice
[1:58:28] now we want to get something
[1:58:32] here it's not just receiving the
[1:58:35] mechanics of the
[1:58:41] message because mechanics without
[1:58:45] Dynamics will go
[1:58:48] nowhere yeah and so brother Bram tells
[1:58:52] us in it is the rising of the sun he
[1:58:55] said until that church becomes both
[1:58:58] Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of
[1:59:01] God that moved him to do the things he
[1:59:03] did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will
[1:59:06] the bride amen for he said in John 14:12
[1:59:10] he that believeth on me the works that I
[1:59:11] do shall he do also and and he says I'll
[1:59:16] give him a charge of my Dynamics in his
[1:59:20] mechanics that the world will not be
[1:59:21] able to stand it and I will raise it up
[1:59:24] at the last day that's the Easter
[1:59:26] message the Dynamics and the mechanics
[1:59:30] together amen the mechanics without
[1:59:33] Dynamics no good neither is Dynamics
[1:59:36] without the mechanics you can scream and
[1:59:38] shout and jump up and down all you want
[1:59:41] to and deny this word so sound like
[1:59:44] Dynamics has a little bit of screaming
[1:59:47] and shouting or maybe a whole lot out of
[1:59:49] it of screaming and shouting and jumping
[1:59:52] up and
[1:59:54] down come on Amen it's not just a dry

[2:00:53] invisible Union brother brandham said
[2:00:56] and this he said we know this 279 we
[2:00:58] know the modern Church in its present
[2:01:02] condition in is in no condition to
[2:01:05] finish up the Great Commission that God
[2:01:08] gave for the
[2:01:10] church so I want you to understand it
[2:01:13] lays on our
[2:01:15] shoulders what is a Great Commission you
[2:01:18] remember go into all the world and
[2:01:20] preach the gospel where to Every
[2:01:24] Creature yes amen we got responsibility
[2:01:27] before but listen this is not about us
[2:01:30] and us four us four and no more there's
[2:01:34] a bride around the world we got a
[2:01:35] responsibility are you with Meen amen so
[2:01:39] you know again again we have to finish
[2:01:41] up the Great Commission go preach
[2:01:43] brother brandom said this is not
[2:01:44] teaching he said it's
[2:01:48] demonstrating yes demonstrating the
[2:01:51] gospel and he said then he said and then
[2:01:53] these signs
[2:01:55] shall that's not a maybe so church amen
[2:01:59] that you know might good if they feel
[2:02:01] like it these signs
[2:02:04] shout follow them that believe are you a
[2:02:09] believer that in my name they shall cast
[2:02:12] out devils in my name they will speak
[2:02:14] with new tongues come on if they lay
[2:02:18] their hands on this sick they shall
[2:02:21] recover that's the promise of God if
[2:02:23] they drink any deadly thing they'll not
[2:02:25] harm them amen amen amen no sir amen now
[2:02:30] he said we know that the church couldn't
[2:02:32] not the Pentecostal Church by no means
[2:02:35] by no means could carry out the last day
[2:02:37] message in its present condition could
[2:02:40] it why it can't even agree on one or two
[2:02:43] words in the Bible how's it going to do
[2:02:45] that so you see denomination out it's
[2:02:48] going to be an elected people that's
[2:02:50] elected for it are you with me now so so
[2:02:55] again you know an elected people that's
[2:02:58] elected ver let me just make something
[2:03:00] clear the apostolic age is not
[2:03:05] over just because the healing Revival is
[2:03:08] over doesn't mean the apostolic age is
[2:03:10] over it never
[2:03:12] ends until the last predestinated member
[2:03:16] of the Bride comes in
[2:03:19] yeah is that right amen now I got just a
[2:03:25] few more minutes man now I know what it
[2:03:28] is when you start getting hungry I know
[2:03:30] there's a big dinner and I do not want
[2:03:33] to be looking like a bunch of
[2:03:35] [Laughter]
[2:03:38] baloney now this gospel has to be
[2:03:41] preached Matthew 24:14 say and this
[2:03:45] Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached
[2:03:48] into all the world for a witness unto
[2:03:50] all nations and then shall the End come
[2:03:54] you want the end to come find the last
[2:03:58] predestinated
[2:04:00] [Applause]
[2:04:04] sheep now only those to whom the whole
[2:04:08] book is given can fulfill the Great
[2:04:13] Commission now this is the restoration
[2:04:16] of the brid tree now brother brand and
[2:04:19] the scripture would say when the Fig
[2:04:21] Tree but you don't notice it says in all
[2:04:23] the other trees so we see Israel the Fig
[2:04:26] Tree but what about the other
[2:04:29] trees putting forth their buds well then
[2:04:31] you know that summer is not so in other
[2:04:34] words that we can look then for a
[2:04:36] harvest
[2:04:37] season is that right so so he said you
[2:04:41] know they they've all put forth their
[2:04:43] branches Methodist Baptist Catholic
[2:04:45] Pentecostal toor Roberts all them all
[2:04:47] their have and all El are having their
[2:04:49] revivals putting forth this Branch then
[2:04:52] we know that time is at hand but I want
[2:04:54] you to understand that remember this
[2:04:59] atmosphere of the breaking forth of the
[2:05:01] Holy Spirit was
[2:05:04] not just was not for all them other
[2:05:08] trees what God in his mind was a bride
[2:05:12] tree yes yes so so you see again the the
[2:05:16] bride tree must produce its
[2:05:21] fruits and it has to produce the same
[2:05:24] fruits that the groom tree did so that
[2:05:28] what was done in the ministry of Christ
[2:05:31] must be done in the ministry of the
[2:05:34] Bride amen so he said now we know that
[2:05:38] the Revival we just went through his
[2:05:39] ceas there must be coming something else
[2:05:42] that's glorious and great I thought
[2:05:44] there was nothing else he said this
[2:05:46] revival cease but there's coming for
[2:05:48] something that is glorious and great
[2:05:51] amen I am beginning to believe that is
[2:05:54] right and he said that that um let let
[2:06:00] me back up he said so I've been studying
[2:06:01] hard to find these places in the
[2:06:03] scripture and I think our Revelation
[2:06:05] must be scriptural then we know it's
[2:06:07] right if it's a scripture is from the
[2:06:09] Lord and I'm beginning to believe that
[2:06:11] that's right that there's coming a
[2:06:13] ripening time for the evening
[2:06:17] fruits so we're not just going to have
[2:06:20] fruit we're going to have ripened
[2:06:23] mature fruit that's ready to be picked
[2:06:27] to put on the master's
[2:06:29] table amen so you see there's a brid
[2:06:32] tree coming forth bringing for this
[2:06:35] fruit and down through the Dark Ages and
[2:06:37] all we know it was cut down but he said
[2:06:39] I will restore don't forget that's what
[2:06:42] we have preached about is that this is a
[2:06:44] restoring message we're riding on that
[2:06:47] wave of restor restoration that's
[2:06:50] right amen so you can have your home
[2:06:52] restored your family restored your
[2:06:55] children
[2:06:56] restored whatever come on because we are
[2:06:59] riding on that wave and it's all
[2:07:02] conclusive
[2:07:04] yes
[2:07:06] Hallelujah yes you know he said he'll
[2:07:09] bless you in the city he'll bless you in
[2:07:11] the country he'll bless you in the
[2:07:14] field amen he'll bless you come on go in
[2:07:18] in and coming out he's going to bless
[2:07:19] you in every kind of way that's what
[2:07:22] God's going to doen well but brother Tim
[2:07:24] you didn't read that other part brother
[2:07:26] Tim where he said now if you don't walk
[2:07:28] in the word and whatever you're going to
[2:07:30] be cursed with this and cursed with that
[2:07:32] let me tell you something that don't
[2:07:33] apply to
[2:07:35] you let me tell you why he took your
[2:07:40] curse he took your curse you ought to
[2:07:43] start expecting to be
[2:07:45] blessed I'm going to be blessed in my
[2:07:48] home I'm going to be blessed in my
[2:07:50] family we're going to be blessed in this
[2:07:52] church we're going to be blessed in our
[2:07:54] finances we're going to be blessed every
[2:07:56] way we look God's blessings on my life
[2:08:00] he's going to bless me with healing
[2:08:02] bless us with Miracle bless us with
[2:08:04] signs bless us with the Holy Ghost
[2:08:07] pouring out into our meeting he's going
[2:08:09] to bless
[2:08:10] us every way we look Lord every way we
[2:08:13] turn I am blessed I am blessed I am
[2:08:17] blessed I'm under God's blessing the
[2:08:20] Devil can't curse me the devil can't
[2:08:22] push me down I am blessed I am blessed I
[2:08:26] am
[2:08:27] [Applause]
[2:08:31] blessed abs and we're here at the top of
[2:08:36] the tree in the light where the fruit
[2:08:41] ripens
[2:08:43] yes
[2:08:45] hallelujah amen glory
[2:08:49] amen now so
[2:08:52] speaking of the early Church in domestic
[2:08:55] conference brother brandham says
[2:08:59] notice you know the Catholic Church
[2:09:01] claims to be the first church he said if
[2:09:04] it's the church then when they've obeyed
[2:09:07] what God Said originally and it's the
[2:09:09] word of God look at the signs Miracles
[2:09:12] and signs and so forth they had and you
[2:09:14] don't have them at all today is an
[2:09:17] Evidence
[2:09:19] that God is not with
[2:09:22] you amen now wait wait a minute many
[2:09:26] times we're running out here oh you know
[2:09:29] he said you know there would be those
[2:09:30] who said Lord Lord you know have not we
[2:09:33] done many mighty Miracle but if the
[2:09:36] signs are not following
[2:09:39] Believers it's the evidence that God is
[2:09:42] not with
[2:09:44] [Music]
[2:09:47] you so you cannot dismiss it by just
[2:09:51] saying well the false is the false you
[2:09:53] know many will come to me no the bride
[2:09:56] has to have the
[2:09:58] manifestation she has to produce the
[2:10:01] fruit now signs will follow them that
[2:10:04] are believers it is impossible for it
[2:10:07] not to listen again this is um from
[2:10:11] uncertain sound now what kind of signs
[2:10:13] is going to follow them these signs well
[2:10:15] on some of them that it'll follow
[2:10:17] perhaps it will maybe it will these
[2:10:19] signs shall follow them they'll believe
[2:10:21] in healing they'll believe in casting
[2:10:22] out Devils they'll believe in speaking
[2:10:24] with no tongues they'll believe in the
[2:10:26] Supernatural works the resurrected Jesus
[2:10:29] working with them then is that the truth
[2:10:31] that God's last word right remember I
[2:10:34] talked to uh some of you were there
[2:10:36] yesterday when I talked about Lincoln's
[2:10:38] you know the final moments there in the
[2:10:40] book that was written about uh about
[2:10:42] Lincoln you know and his last days and
[2:10:45] describing that and how God was trying
[2:10:47] to impart to us in the message what he
[2:10:50] wanted with the last words from
[2:10:52] Jesus commissioned you go preach how
[2:10:57] dare some so-called headquarter tell us
[2:11:00] to sit down they didn't call me God
[2:11:05] called me God called me man didn't call
[2:11:08] me I didn't get my calling from my
[2:11:10] headquarters nobody can tell you to sit
[2:11:12] down and shut
[2:11:14] up amen for we are the final voice to
[2:11:17] the final
[2:11:20] age yes sir the voice of God brother
[2:11:23] Brandon said would come through the
[2:11:25] ministry it's in the bride the voice of
[2:11:29] God is in
[2:11:30] [Applause]
[2:11:32] you
[2:11:34] Hallelujah was the Pentecostal church
[2:11:37] and noisy church back in the beginning
[2:11:39] when the Holy Ghost first fell the
[2:11:41] Virgin Mary she was a drunk staggering
[2:11:44] under the power of God and all them like
[2:11:45] that and the people said they're full of
[2:11:47] new wine that's the way the church was
[2:11:49] ordained that's the way every church is
[2:11:52] ordained every time God has a church
[2:11:56] it'll be that same kind of
[2:12:00] church Hallelujah I believe God's a
[2:12:03] church got a
[2:12:05] church amen you might can pick and pull
[2:12:07] this and up since you're trying 56 11:25
[2:12:11] secondhand robe brother brandom says
[2:12:14] they say Divine Healing cannot work the
[2:12:16] days of Miracles is passed if the days
[2:12:19] of Miracles is passed the day of God is
[2:12:24] passed the church that don't believe in
[2:12:28] Supernatural will finally die and God
[2:12:32] will leave the church it has to so here
[2:12:36] we come back along you know you know is
[2:12:39] there hope of
[2:12:42] Revival let me just share this and from
[2:12:45] God of this evil age just just a couple
[2:12:47] right here here that that he said when
[2:12:49] she as Eve had the feeling of God's word
[2:12:52] in her hand she could have took God's
[2:12:54] word but what did she do in to that
[2:12:57] instead of tearing for the baptism of
[2:12:59] the Holy Ghost let science prove to her
[2:13:02] that the Holy Ghost was only for the
[2:13:04] disciples instead of keeping Divine
[2:13:06] Healing going when she ought to be
[2:13:10] now raised the dead and doing great
[2:13:13] Miracles she has L Satan under his
[2:13:16] leadership of relig man take the word of
[2:13:22] God and try to say was for another age
[2:13:27] and she believed it well you know that
[2:13:29] was only for brother
[2:13:30] Brandon that was only 50 years ago that
[2:13:33] you know that's all dead now God's word
[2:13:36] ain't
[2:13:37] [Applause]
[2:13:38] dead the Revival might be dead but God
[2:13:41] ain't dead
[2:13:43] am Amen in the message once more in in
[2:13:48] in in 1963 he said there ought to be a
[2:13:51] holy power surrounding in the church
[2:13:54] that will make demons flee instead of
[2:13:57] that it's become a laughing stock what
[2:13:59] is it the mechanics instead of the
[2:14:05] Dynamics amen there again you know he
[2:14:08] said he he he goes on to say he's still
[2:14:12] the same God of History he's the one was
[2:14:14] with Daniel and the Lions Den with the
[2:14:16] Hebrew children the furnace he's still
[2:14:19] the same God of History he's waiting on
[2:14:21] his people to calling up out of
[2:14:25] History amen the same God remains God
[2:14:28] he's God forever but our Traditions
[2:14:31] we've taught it away from the people and
[2:14:35] it's happened you don't need to speak
[2:14:37] with tongues anymore now you know the
[2:14:39] gifts are all laid on the shelf and
[2:14:41] there ain't even quote for
[2:14:44] that well that which is perfect has come
[2:14:47] and that which is part is done away with
[2:14:49] yeah that's right when the whole word
[2:14:51] comes just having part is done away with
[2:14:54] we have the whole book we have every
[2:14:57] promise in it well jumping up and down
[2:15:00] and trying to speak in yeah trying to
[2:15:02] speak in tongue trying to work something
[2:15:04] that's over with that's baby stuff we've
[2:15:07] learned better than that amen but
[2:15:09] speaking in tongues ain't over
[2:15:11] with amen that's a gift that's always to
[2:15:14] be in the
[2:15:15] church what am I trying to say Tim you
[2:15:18] want a bunch of gifts and signs and
[2:15:20] wonders well I guess I
[2:15:24] do Paul did say desire
[2:15:28] them yes so I guess I
[2:15:30] do but but friends what what I what I'm
[2:15:34] really trying to say is I'm not trying
[2:15:37] to emphasize gifts or signs or wonders
[2:15:40] or Miracles or healing I'm trying to say
[2:15:43] we have an open
[2:15:46] book are you with me yeah amen we have
[2:15:49] the book has been revealed the Mysteries
[2:15:52] have been revealed it is opened up the
[2:15:54] book so it opens up healing it opens up
[2:15:57] signs it opens up wonders it opens up
[2:16:00] overcoming life it over come on whatever
[2:16:03] it is it lays in the book I'm saying
[2:16:07] whatever's in the
[2:16:09] book whatever's in the book is mine if I
[2:16:13] need healing is mine if I need God to
[2:16:16] speak to me he's got a voice and I've
[2:16:18] got an
[2:16:19] ear whatever it is God is still
[2:16:23] [Applause]
[2:16:25] God that is the truth well you're
[2:16:28] emphasizing well maybe because it's been
[2:16:32] deemphasized so then you have to kind of
[2:16:35] overemphasize sometimes to real to point
[2:16:38] out things that have been
[2:16:46] forgotten
[2:16:48] and he says testimony on the
[2:16:51] sea he said when then we begin to find
[2:16:54] out Miracles isn't taking place no more
[2:16:59] like they were the sick go home sick and
[2:17:03] it isn't because of God it's because of
[2:17:06] the lack of Revival among the people
[2:17:09] there is no Revival they just sit and
[2:17:13] listen go home and say well I guess that
[2:17:16] was pretty good mhm great sermon brother
[2:17:19] brother
[2:17:21] Jason kind of like a little boy standing
[2:17:24] with his grandma Yeah standing at the
[2:17:27] back
[2:17:27] door and the the the pastor was standing
[2:17:30] the back door shaking hands as they went
[2:17:32] out and old granny comes by and said oh
[2:17:35] Pastor dear I I was just so filled with
[2:17:40] your
[2:17:41] sermon and he looked down little boy yes
[2:17:44] sunny boy what did you think of it he
[2:17:46] said well frankly sir I got a belly full
[2:17:48] of it
[2:17:54] myself you blondes will get that
[2:18:03] tomorrow but that's the way it is it's
[2:18:05] just
[2:18:06] H we've got the greatest message there
[2:18:09] ever
[2:18:11] was why why why listen you shouldn't be
[2:18:16] looking for excuse not to come to church
[2:18:19] you need to look for every reason to
[2:18:20] come to church God fill My Heart Lord we
[2:18:24] gather together let me be a part of the
[2:18:26] atmosphere let it be that all around me
[2:18:29] people can see that God is
[2:18:32] moving that I'm inspiring somebody else
[2:18:36] to be saved to be healed to be delivered
[2:18:41] yes that's true
[2:18:44] amen I realize it isn't in a lot of
[2:18:47] noise
[2:18:49] that isn't it but
[2:18:51] yet I mean that's only half the quotes
[2:18:54] by the way that's only one side the
[2:18:57] other side says everywhere Jesus is
[2:18:59] there is
[2:19:00] noise amen so it isn't the noise you can
[2:19:04] have noise and not have Jesus but if you
[2:19:06] have
[2:19:07] Jesus I think you're going to have some
[2:19:09] kind of noise cuz everywhere he is
[2:19:13] there's
[2:19:14] noise amen course we've seen people
[2:19:17] shout and praise the Lord and have not
[2:19:19] have enough Faith to heal a tooth a I
[2:19:22] and I know there are those that trained
[2:19:23] to conversation yeah their congregation
[2:19:26] I mean to give a response of just
[2:19:28] running up to the platform standing
[2:19:29] shouting screaming to the preaching
[2:19:31] noise that some have even confused as
[2:19:36] the evidence of the Holy
[2:19:38] Ghost and much of it is no different
[2:19:41] than from the priest of Baal who Elijah
[2:19:44] mocked as he tried to scream down the
[2:19:46] power of their God
[2:19:48] so the evidence of the
[2:19:50] token is not
[2:19:52] noise but a surrendered life to
[2:19:58] God that's what you want to look for not
[2:20:01] who hollers and screams and runs the a
[2:20:03] of most but is that life surrendered to
[2:20:09] God Amen sure there's a lot of
[2:20:12] difference between blessings and and
[2:20:14] power brother brand said he said brother
[2:20:16] the whole floor was dancing in the
[2:20:18] spirit not enough Faith to heal a
[2:20:20] toothache you call that power that's not
[2:20:22] power that's blessings there's a lot of
[2:20:24] difference between blessings and
[2:20:26] power but don't lose your balance here
[2:20:29] though it is not power and neither is
[2:20:32] there any faith in it maybe it is
[2:20:34] blessings yes yes and blessings are
[2:20:37] needed yes yes shouting is needed yes
[2:20:42] let me tell you the Bible they they
[2:20:44] didn't discourage shouting they
[2:20:46] encourage courage
[2:20:49] shouting come on Psalms 32:11 be glad in
[2:20:53] the Lord and rejoice you righteous and
[2:20:56] Shout for joy and all ye that are
[2:21:00] upright in heart are you upright in
[2:21:01] heart are you righteous then you got a
[2:21:04] right to shout and that's what brother
[2:21:06] Bram said I don't care how high you you
[2:21:09] jump he said just live as high as you
[2:21:11] jump so if you're living this this high
[2:21:14] you can jump that high if you're living
[2:21:15] that high you can jump that if living
[2:21:17] like that you can jump that high are you
[2:21:20] with me Psalms 47:1 oh clap your hands
[2:21:23] all you people shout un to God with a
[2:21:26] voice of Triumph it is a part of
[2:21:30] worship it is a part of worship amen it
[2:21:33] says sick them
[2:21:35] boy
[2:21:37] amen but let me tell you something dry
[2:21:40] theology won't work that's right you see
[2:21:44] in the churches book brother Bram said
[2:21:47] in in the Ephesian Church
[2:21:49] age said Paul saw it come and he warn
[2:21:52] warned them about this subtle priesthood
[2:21:54] that would come and take over with its
[2:21:56] false doctrines he knew they would
[2:21:58] Implement a way of worship now watch
[2:22:01] Implement a way of worship now they're
[2:22:04] going to use quotes to do it
[2:22:08] sir are you hung up on
[2:22:12] me try that again they would Implement a
[2:22:14] way of
[2:22:15] worship that excluded the people from
[2:22:18] any part in a holy spirit
[2:22:22] Ministry and even right today among
[2:22:25] those who claim to be free and full of
[2:22:27] the spirit there's not too much freedom
[2:22:30] in the Ley and the best we can see is a
[2:22:34] few preachers with inspired preaching
[2:22:37] while the flock just sits there and
[2:22:39] tries to ass Serb it and this is a far
[2:22:43] cry from Paul who said when all came
[2:22:45] together and all had the leading of the
[2:22:47] spirit and all participated in spiritual
[2:22:52] worship so so there there again you see
[2:22:56] this is this is word that we've got off
[2:22:58] to that we don't want the Holy Ghost it
[2:23:01] would embarrass
[2:23:03] us to have an act two
[2:23:05] experience we would be embarrassed and
[2:23:08] me in fact people people say just like
[2:23:11] brother Bram quoted back at then he said
[2:23:13] I'm afraid I might speak in tongues and
[2:23:15] act like some of them I I don't believe
[2:23:16] I want the Holy
[2:23:18] Ghost brother brand said I don't care if
[2:23:20] it makes you scream and cry and ball at
[2:23:22] the altar he said and and and run around
[2:23:26] like a chicken with his head cut off
[2:23:29] that's what he said by the way I'm
[2:23:32] quoting him amen he said I don't care
[2:23:35] what way he said a new birth is a mess
[2:23:38] but we want it in a formal way a
[2:23:40] classical way but that ain't the way it
[2:23:43] happened in the book of Acts and it's
[2:23:44] not going to happen that way for you
[2:23:46] that's right
[2:23:48] when it comes it's a supernatural
[2:23:51] experience it's not just a mental essent
[2:23:55] assertion that I believe the message it
[2:23:57] is an
[2:23:59] [Applause]
[2:24:04] experience
[2:24:06] Hallelujah now coming down to my message
[2:24:16] finally
[2:24:18] still shorter than you brother
[2:24:29] Matt become afraid of the new birth
[2:24:31] afraid to shout the Praises of God
[2:24:33] afraid of the gifts of the Spirit they
[2:24:36] want nothing to do with that they just
[2:24:37] might be called
[2:24:41] Pentecostal I hope we are called
[2:24:45] Pentecostal
[2:24:48] they're afraid of the new
[2:24:51] birth hey you know what I'm I'm just
[2:24:54] going to read a couple of these it'll
[2:24:56] make you go into overtime that's
[2:25:00] okay I'm I'm going to borrow some of
[2:25:02] brother Matt's next sermon bring it here
[2:25:06] so he can shorten his up I'm going to
[2:25:08] steal a few minutes from
[2:25:11] him God this is from thirston and life
[2:25:15] 1960 March before people are afraid of
[2:25:19] the new birth they're afraid of it now
[2:25:21] any birth I don't care what level it's
[2:25:24] on it's a mess you can take it if it's
[2:25:27] out yonder in a pig pin any birth makes
[2:25:30] a mess if it's a pig pin if it's in the
[2:25:33] cow table if it's in a pink decorated
[2:25:36] hospital room I don't care where a birth
[2:25:38] takes place it's a mess and the new
[2:25:41] birth is the same it might it'll make
[2:25:43] you do things you didn't think you would
[2:25:45] do you might cry boohoo rub around on
[2:25:50] the altar no matter what you do I I
[2:25:53] never asked God it wouldn't do no good
[2:25:55] to try to bring the new birth to my
[2:25:57] level I want to meet God's level of the
[2:26:00] new birth and receive it I don't care
[2:26:02] what I have to do someone said long not
[2:26:05] long ago I'm afraid to receive the Holy
[2:26:07] Ghost I'm afraid it make me speak in
[2:26:09] tongues like them others I don't care if
[2:26:11] I spoke in tongues talked in tongues
[2:26:14] crowed in tongues or anything else I
[2:26:17] want the Holy
[2:26:19] Ghost that's the main principle I don't
[2:26:22] care what level it is I'll meet God on
[2:26:24] his level then he goes on to say the new
[2:26:28] birth that changes a man changes a woman
[2:26:31] changes the Desir their
[2:26:36] appetites now let me bring you to the
[2:26:38] other this is a deceived Church by the
[2:26:41] world brother brandham speaks about
[2:26:45] Samson he will talk about this for all
[2:26:48] through after saying Revival is over he
[2:26:51] shows another Revival a new crop
[2:26:55] coming are you with
[2:26:58] me Samson is blinded taken prison that's
[2:27:01] the church it's in this horrible
[2:27:03] condition but there's a new crop coming
[2:27:05] where the power
[2:27:07] returns are you with me yes so he comes
[2:27:10] right in he says this he says we all
[2:27:14] know about that birth I don't care where
[2:27:16] it is where abouts if it's a mess if
[2:27:18] it's a baby born on a Shu pile or a hard
[2:27:21] floor a pink decorated hospital room
[2:27:23] it's a mess anyhow birth of a c birth of
[2:27:26] anything else is a mess and the new
[2:27:28] birth is nothing less than a mess but
[2:27:32] people so starchy we'll go over where
[2:27:34] they shake hands we'll go over where
[2:27:36] they don't ball and cry and beat on the
[2:27:39] Altar and cry out you want to be too
[2:27:42] human what we need is a birth to die now
[2:27:45] to bring forth life old sea potato oh
[2:27:48] potato sea potato you might take that
[2:27:51] potato put it in the ground until you
[2:27:53] can to have until you can have new
[2:27:56] potatoes that old potato has to rot a
[2:27:58] corn cannot produce light new life until
[2:28:01] it's rotten and a man or woman can never
[2:28:04] have a new birth until their
[2:28:06] intellectuals and their own self is
[2:28:08] rotten Dead die out at the altar and
[2:28:12] scream and get all messed up to a place
[2:28:15] the starch get out of your collar and
[2:28:18] you're born again by the spirit of God I
[2:28:21] don't care if you Squall speak in
[2:28:23] tongues jump up and down flop like a
[2:28:26] chicken with his head off you're
[2:28:27] bringing forth new
[2:28:30] life amen but we substituted something
[2:28:33] for it we want it the classical way
[2:28:36] because we actually become ashamed of
[2:28:41] him we are
[2:28:43] embarrassed for the church to bring
[2:28:45] forth children
[2:28:51] they might get out of order well I ain't
[2:28:53] never seen any kids that
[2:28:58] didn't take them to a
[2:29:02] restaurant you wish you
[2:29:04] hadn't they going to get out of
[2:29:07] order amen take them to
[2:29:11] church makes it a lot of beating for
[2:29:13] them to learn to sit
[2:29:15] still
[2:29:19] yeah but I mean you can read the the
[2:29:23] ashamed of him and so on but brother
[2:29:25] Bram goes on into this he takes these
[2:29:28] that I've read from the
[2:29:30] Revival and we've had the revivals but
[2:29:33] he said we are resting between
[2:29:38] revivals so if we're resting between
[2:29:41] revivals there's another Revival
[2:29:45] coming that just because that other is
[2:29:48] over with doesn't mean God's
[2:29:52] through and he said we've been resting
[2:29:54] between revivals and we've been
[2:29:56] testifying and you know and we're
[2:29:59] testifying oh my glory to God you know
[2:30:03] the Miracles the signs of Wonder oh look

[2:35:32] years of mechanics and studying them and
[2:35:36] Fiddle fatling with them and discovering
[2:35:39] these are the vows and these are the
[2:35:42] whatever carburetor here's the this and
[2:35:44] here's how that works and here's how
[2:35:46] that work and explaining this and
[2:35:48] explaining that we don't need more
[2:35:51] explanations we need the dynamic power
[2:35:54] of the Holy Ghost in the church to make
[2:35:57] alive what we've already
[2:35:59] [Applause]
[2:36:04] know yes Lord
[2:36:06] Jesus when brother Bram left us he left
[2:36:08] us a car that would drive down to Divine
[2:36:10] Healing it would drive down to Miracles
[2:36:13] it would drive down come on it would go
[2:36:16] somewhere it wasn't dead it was alive I
[2:36:19] don't know who is fiddle fle with it I
[2:36:21] don't know who's been turned off but I
[2:36:22] want to tell you if God had a a car that

[3:26:51] those Dynamics if you want a refilling
[3:26:53] of the Holy Ghost that starts with fresh
[3:26:55] commitment and that's what we did a
