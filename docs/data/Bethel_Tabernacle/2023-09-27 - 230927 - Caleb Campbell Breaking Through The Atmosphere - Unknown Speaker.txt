foreign [Music] amen amen praise the Lord amen praise the Lord good to be in the house of God tonight Saints amen good to be here let's just turn right into the word tonight we're going to open up our Bibles here in the Philippians 3. Philippians 3 this thought has been burning heavy on my heart the last few weeks I pray it can be a a blessing and encourage our hearts tonight did we come expecting to hear from the Lord tonight amen praise the Lord we'll have two portions of scriptures we're going to open with first in Philippians 3 and then we'll turn over into Hebrews Philippians 3 and verse 7 we're going to start in verse 7. amen and it says but what things were gained to me those I counted lost for Christ yea doubtless and I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that which that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before so we have to reach forth into something but before we do that he says we have to forget those things that are behind he says then I press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus hey man I want to actually uh pick up a few verses of that in the NLT verse 12 says I don't mean to say that I've already achieved these things or that I have already reached Perfection but I press on to possess that Perfection for which Christ Jesus first possessed me no dear brothers and sisters I have not achieved it but I focus on this one thing forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead I press on to reach the end of the race and receive the Heavenly prize for which God through Christ Jesus is calling us let us all who are spiritually mature agree on these things if you agree disagree on some point I believe God will make it plain to you let's turn over in the scriptures to Hebrews the 11th chapter and the evidence for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear and I'd like to take a text for tonight's service out of those two scriptures titled breaking through the atmosphere Heavenly Father Lord God we just bow our hearts tonight before you Lord Jesus father we're just coming to you under a full surrender Lord we ask that you would come and break the bread of life to us tonight father we pray that you would anoint these words father we pray that you would anoint our ears Lord and I pray that Faith would pick up the words and take it and Seed into our hearts tonight father be with each one here tonight father we lord again we're just Lord we're striving father we're striving for something Lord we're pressing towards the mark father and tonight Lord we're we're here to press a little bit further Lord toward that Mark father we just lay aside those things of life we we came into these doors tonight Lord to hear from you father so we pray that you would speak to us you'd minister to our hearts Lord you'd move us out of the way father Lord and you'd come and anoint the service father we'll be careful to give you all the praise tonight Lord and we ask all these things in Jesus name amen I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the reading thank you brother Branham comes down in this and the sermon countdown 1962 1964. he begins to describe to us the development of Transportation the achievements mankind made in science to move us further and further along in transportation he says paragraph 33 says now my text tonight is called the countdown now things all things in the natural are types of things in the spiritual we understand that see the natural only types the spiritual and as Believers we know that the natural things happening always type the spiritual things of our Lord Jesus he goes on to say in paragraph 52 but modern happenings is a forerunner of spiritual happenings now remember modern Runnings are forerunners of spiritual happenings the natural as the spiritual exactly each happenings accompany the other only improved over the other each thing that happens in the natural and the next thing that happens is an improvement when anything happens on Earth it is a warning to us that something is fixing to be happened from Heaven what does What man does on Earth by his achievement is something that God is fixing to do by his achievement to his church so when anything happens it's a warning to us that something is fixing to be from Heaven straight from a prophet he says so when we when we see God doing incredible achievements or when we see mankind doing incredible achievements in in science and on Earth we know God is fixing to do something Matthew 24 uh 24 says therefore be on alert for you do not know which day your lord is coming and just to set a little bit of a foundation tonight the prophet takes us through a journey of the ages to show the happenings of the Lord restoring uh restoring his family back to that Faith the fifth Church age messenger which was Martin Luther he shows was preaching justification the just shall live by faith and that age Martin Luther lived from 1483 to 1546 and if you go back and you study the development of horse and Buggies there's history that it was actually a means of transporting goods all the way back into the ancient times but as a means of transporting vehicle to carry passengers didn't first appear until England in 1955 right after Martin Luther left the scene and just a few years after that messenger leaves the scene you see that natural achievement takes place in the form of horse and buggy moving further into the next stage was sanctification a man by the name of John Wesley brings a message that completely stood against the message of the day and that church age was the Philadelphian Church age the church age book page 331 brother random says now this is the sixth Church age in the eyes of God time is drawing to a close he will soon be coming back soon the cry will go forth as he comes and then he quotes that scripture in 20 revelation 22 he says and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still he that is Holy let him be holy still that righteousness that he's talking about which was in our opening text in Philippians 3 verse 9 is of God by faith not our own righteousness but his righteousness amen I know these things are familiar we're just laying a little bit of a foundation tonight 1962 brother Branham comes in uh the countdown he says now we look that when we come from the horse and buggy automobile airplane the church God has been able in spiritual line to achieve from justification through Luther sanctification through Wesley to the baptism of the Holy Ghost now see it's a type a shadow achievements what God has been able to do the natural achievement of man John Wesley lived in 1703 to 1791 the first steam-powered engine came into production around 1672 but the first automobile that was capable of human Transportation was in 1769 right near the end of John Wesley's life and you see you see these things they they're typing the natural typing the spiritual each time the Lord gives a little bit more Revelation in the word the man gets a little bit more Revelation in the natural amen so there was even even when God does give a little bit more Revelation though there's always a maturing time that has to take place right along with that and the same thing happens in the natural when something is first invented and first created in first trademarked it takes a little bit of time for that thingy to come into production and takes a little bit of time for it to be perfected and used it took time for men to perfect the automobile you know when we see these things taking place on a grand scale you know that's the way God does things he waits till everything is lined up exactly according to what the way that he needs it and he's perfectly patient every time the same thing happens in our lives on a personal scale he calls us out of our sin you know we repent we accept Jesus Christ into our hearts the blood cleanses our sins and then we stand Justified but that's just the beginning then we move into our cleaning out the sanctification the cleansing amen the emptying out but then once we're empty we're not supposed to stay empty the Lord is just then ready to to fill you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost after you stand Justified after you've received that sanctification now you you now you're standing in the place where you can actually receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in 1903 the Wright brothers embarked on their first successful attempt at flying their flight only lasted 12 seconds and the flight only went 180 feet but it was living proof that mankind was about to dive into unimaginable Heights 1906 just three short years later the Azusa Street Revival took place in Los Angeles California and there come Azusa brother random says this there come Azusa when they left the ground and hit then the air through the baptism of the Holy Ghost God took the church from an Earthbound Creed into a solo flight in the air just as the airplane come in the Holy Ghost come in right behind it see that's right justification the horse and buggy sanctification what was it what was it the automobile beginning to move along then the baptism of the Holy Ghost you took off the ground got your feet off the air a got up in the air flying around in the heavenlies with the Heavenly gifts the speaking in tongues the Divine Healing them was still in the automobile and still riding in the horse and buggy they thought that that was the strangest thing that they had ever seen then people was having a fit but they got their feet off the ground God was able to bring to the church his achievement when he got a bunch of people standing still long enough that he could pour His Spirit into him what was it then and it wasn't just a few short years later that the first plane to ever carry passengers any amount of distance was invented and put into use then if you move a little bit further the world's first jet plane was established by a German engineer came by manned achievement around the 1930s you see it moving further and further in the spiritual brother Branham in 1933 the angel of the Lord sent a commission to him right there at the river just as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming your message was sent to forerun my second coming oh my praise God for October 4th 1957 the Soviets launched the very first shuttle into space breaking into an entire New Era of travel April 1961 the first human to go out of the atmosphere and into space not long right after that the church Ages were preached not long after that the seals were preached amen people talking about the modern brother Branham says paragraph 70 in that same sermon they call that modern this is the modern according to the kingdom of God astronauts Glory the astronaut age sure Eagles God's prophets Rising on the scene how how thankful we are for that what is it spiritual manifestations of spiritual word becoming literally be fulfilled before us amen word of God manifested once was hard to understand now is made plain through the astronaut amen the position of the church that should be Plumbing the heavenlies not down here floating around through the clouds and buzzing like an airplane but something that's propelled by something something that sends it beyond anything that airplane could ever think of it's an astronaut amen that's the age we're living in friends spiritual astronauts now the astronaut can see the horse and the buggy or the automobile but the airplane things that the airplane couldn't even see because he's thousands of miles ahead of them he's so far ahead till they're 50 times the speed now you see why these people think they get crazy they can't understand it glory god say you see it thanks to God spiritual astronauts living so far above what even an airplane could think of he wants to take our thinking into New Heights and when you you know when you get into a space shuttle you are completely pressurized to the atmosphere of which you will enter as long as you stay in that vehicle and that vehicle that you're in stays pressurized and no outside elements hinder its path you see brother Branham when he comes and tells us this word that we're astronauts you know when a plane I have brother Matt say this I like to plagiarize other ministers brother Matt was saying this when a plane hits turbulence in the air the plane kind of shakes and it causes the people to get get nervous get get on board get nervous either flying they're flying in the clouds but then a little a little a little Shake happens and then they get nervous you see but when you when you're on a space shuttle you're moving so fast and so far above the turbulence that it doesn't have any effect on you anymore brother Adam says this in paragraph 108 you see the progress of the church has followed the progress of time you know that and we've changed now from airplane to astronaut and there's got to be a change you see we've seen the three changes come in the progress of Transportation power always taking added power added power keep more and more and more why don't the airplane get up there he says it hasn't got the power to do it it isn't built for it it couldn't do it but the astronaut has the power the tube that he's in it has the power he's up there he goes up sends up by electronic by atoms which is far greater than gasoline or anything we're in another age he says what was happening there was man was having less and less control and the Machine was getting more and more powerful the horse and buggy they were in total control there was horses they were leading which way it went right the automobiles they took a little bit of gasoline a little bit of combustion a little bit more power you move into the airplane it moves miles above the automobile it would take you way further in less time but you see that's right there when there started to be a control tower you see when they started rising up higher in the clouds there started to have to be a control tower to to guide you where to go and and to tell you look you can't go that route because there's clouds in the way there's weather there's storms there's things that are going to get in your way and so when you get the Holy Ghost when you're baptized by the spirit of God there's things in your life that the control tower will tell you to avoid but God wants to take us higher than that he wants to take us where those things don't affect us anymore Hallelujah what was happening was something that was all together different the space shuttle opened up the door for so much more it wasn't they weren't controlling anymore their faith was solely in those instruments they had to rely on that control center to be their eyes and ears I thought this was so amazing scripture says that it'll be so that it'll through the narrow way brother random says you know in 1959 I quoted this in my in one of my Sunday schools but straight is the gate 1959 he says it'll be so few in that Rapture you know NASA's astronaut selection process had more than 12 000 applicants their last selection and only 10 were selected that's not even one percent that is a fraction of a percentage oh he says in in in how can I overcome 1963 paragraph 66 he says oh my beloved friends don't let that door shut Jesus says As it was in that day so shall it be in the coming of the son of man thank you brother so shall it be in the coming of son of the man now there is somebody going to get caught outside this door now listen to this friends if attention here many of them might have good intentions and someday if such things will happen we'll go in with brother Noah because he's a fine fellow but you see it just caught a outside you see brother random sees as a prophet he sees the attitude of the people and he sees you know you know I I know that that I want to do right I know that I want to go to church I want I know that I want to live right I know that it's the truth but I just am not willing to completely give it all yet I I will one day I know I will one day but I'm not there yet and you see he says one day they'll be caught outside that door he really brings us down to earth some might have good intentions you believe the message you think it's a real nice thing you say Someday I'm gonna guilt my life right oh someday I'm going to go back to church someday I'm going to surrender my life to Christ but it's not for me now he says now think hard now this isn't me this is a prophet think hard now if you were laying around getting Dodie get in hurry because the door might close at any time amen he comes down to the next paragraph it's by one Spirit Romans 8 1 that we're all baptized into one body into the domain of that Kingdom one spiritual baptism no matter how good no matter how bad whatever you're in that Kingdom by Holy Ghost baptism see that's the only way you overcome It's all under that shed blood is Overcomers because you cannot overcome yourself it's he that overcome for you you are resting he said he says you know he's asking the question but brother Reno How will I know then brother random that I'm in there watch what kind of life that you're living just look around and see now because you can go and you can watch your life and you can live a pretty nice life but just look around and see if it's lived out of you automatically is this life being lived out of you have used out of you the way the prophet teaches us then something's wrong he says or you don't or or do you have to strain and pull see then you're doing it but don't try to do it did you ever try it he says yeah don't 1959 straight as they gate if I never preach another sermon in my life that is the truth there's just going to be a few people saved just remember that they're just a very few and and when I just kind of dramatized for a second you know you can read something like that and you can read straight As the gate narrow away is the way and you can get kind of discouraged in your heart because my goodness less than one percent but then he says you be one of them I'm not worried about anything else I'm just worried about being one of them I'm worried about my relationship with the Lord I'm worried I just want to be right with my Lord Jesus I just want to walk so closely with him I just want to live in such a Unity with him that there's nothing hindering me there's no clouds there's no turbulence there's no there's no weather that's hindering my past with the Lord Jesus Christ he says but you be lined up with God if your heart don't beat just with that Bible then there's something wrong there's something wrong no matter what your church says you can't go by you can't go in by that we believe in a message we believe God sent a prophet you cannot go in by what the church says you go in by what your revelation of what God in you is you go in by Holy Spirit baptism by one Spirit we're all baptized into God hallelujah this is the book that you'll be judged from the Bible stay right with it what simple directions from a prophet just a few only those that have that seal Hallelujah just settle it in your heart saints of God he goes on to say you know if it's not lived automatically just strained or do you have to strain and pull you know but glory to God Saints when you just know that you're resting in there then it's just a rest because you're just walking right where you know that God is Walking With You amen I want to take a little bit of a turn today when space shuttles are taken off there's actually a certain velocity that it takes a speed that the space shuttle has to attain before it can escape the Earth's enormous gravity oh my I was reading about this I just about have a jubilee this term is called escape velocity and this definition is straight from NASA's website the gravity of Earth is constantly trying to pull things down to the ground who else feels that way sometimes all the gravity of these things are trying to pull me down oh the Rockets are so heavy they need to be able to generate incredible speed NASA says to escape earthstrong's gravity and that speed is called escape velocity a rocket needs to be going about 25 000 miles per hour in order to escape Earth and get displace glory to God there's a pressure rising up in the world that outweighs anything ever in history the Bible prophesied about it if the gravity is this Earth the way of Satan trying to pull down pull you down and keep keep you down on the ground the principalities the powers the spiritual wickedness in high places those spiritual wickedness in high places oh they're they're working in the clouds they're in high places oh but the distractions are at an all-time high that the pressures are maybe almost unbearable whoever feels like that sometimes you just feel things are unbearable you feel like things are overwhelming you feel like there's just there's just nothing you can do but you see those spiritual astronauts God's elect the Bride of Jesus Christ they're getting ready to take their Heavenly fight Hallelujah and in order to escape the gravity the pulling down of weight it's going to take an escape velocity it's going to take what the prophet calls on astronaut faith and in order for any ship to really gain that amount of velocity right from this NASA website how much force are we going to need here we're measuring the force of thrust produced or as that is the force that pushes the rocket into space it has to produce a Thrust to escape the Earth's gravitational pull of 7.2 million pounds of thrust to do that and as the fuel burns the shuttle actually gets lighter and less as it speeds up as it speeds up it reaches what they call supersonic speed and that's passing the speed of sound oh saints of God faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God and when you are going at a height and a depth in the word where you're hearing it and you're eating it and you're living it you you break past that barrier of sound Oh Glory to God as you begin to speed up you hear the word scraping away those last remnants of the world from you you start to reach this supersonic speed that the message of the hour is producing in our lives and then it takes more than it just than just going to church and having a relationship between this message has become more than you than just something in your life it's when it's crossed the threshold to being your life hallelujah it's when this message has become your life because it's God's word given to us to make a Rapture Hallelujah it should mean everything to us you see when you reach that speed it can create what they call a sonic boom which can produce a shock wave you see oftentimes those shock waves can cause damage to things around it you see the separation of the world the separation of Life can sometimes cause those shock waves in our life it severs relationship with friends maybe sometimes with family it breaks off those things that are holding you back the weights of sin the burdens the besetting things oh but in order for you to keep moving Higher and Higher and break through this atmosphere and into the next that supersonic speed has to be achieved glory to God as we speed up into our spiritual lives those hindrances will break away I promise you though friends you don't oh you don't want to keep those things anyway if it's holding you back from moving further with the lord it's not important anyway I promise you on the other side when you're reaching when you're shouting for Glory those things those besetting things will not be important to you at that time oh I'm moving a little further then it reaches this point called Max q and that's when you pass through an atmosphere that is extremely thick and the aerodynamic pressure is actually at its very highest oh my I believe that happens in Believers lives when the pressure feels seems like it's the very highest the aircraft now this is actually what happens in the space shuttle the aircraft has to actually slightly throttle back and it does that in order so that it knows that the vehicle can handle the loads as it breaks through that atmosphere oh you see the spiritual connection Saints sometimes we think when something happens in our life and a great trial comes our way our Humanity steps in and the devil throws mind battles your way oh my but that slow down that trial that you're going through God's using it to help you break through this thick atmosphere of life and take you into Resurrection with him oh my when tragedy comes in your heart breaks in half and you feel numb you feel like you can't comprehend anything he just Whispers in your sight Whispers in your heart he says my dear child I'm weeping with you I'm hurting with you but it won't be much longer oh you see my son he went through the greatest suffering any man could ever go through but without his death there could be no Resurrection oh and even though it's so hard now it won't measure up to the perfect place I have prepared for you my child and oh it just Whispers it says because I love you so much my word says that I will work it for your good so this thing that the enemy thinks in your life is breaking you down oh he thinks he's got you with oh it's just something to get you into that next atmosphere it's just something that's gonna take you further oh oh I feel that way sometimes oh saints of God I can just just dramatize this for a second oh can you just imagine sitting there all the Angels probably were just sitting there I just heard this quote this morning always as the angel sat there and watched his son being beat to death and he they watched it happen oh and I can just see Gabriel with a great sword right next to him and wormwood sitting right there and brother Brown dramatize it so perfectly in conferences and he just says oh then there comes there was a conference oh and hell of him oh he came down and he says oh he says my job oh he says he says oh are you willing are you willing to to bear this are you willing to bear this are you willing to go through this oh he says be it unto me oh he says not my will but thine will be done oh Saints oh it'll all make sense there just as it seems like you can't go on anymore as you as you begin to throttle back you begin to reach that point where where you know that you're just about ready to break through into that supersonic speed and you have to throttle back and those things are weighing you down you know and you have an assurance that those things are actually so that so that God can take you into that next phase oh saints of God and just just as you think it's slowing down it begins to throttle back up just as it reaches the point where it breaks from one atmosphere to the next as the fuel burns the shuttle gets lighter and less and it does something called jettison these rockets that help to get the space shuttle off the ground actually just detach it's such a cool process to watch you watch a space shuttle and you've got two rockets beside it and then you've got this enormous fuel tank on the back of it and as you begin to break through before you reach into that other atmosphere you actually have these two rockets that have expelled their fuel and they've done their job they've gotten you to where you need to go and then they expel and they drop off into the ocean and they just and they go pick them up as if it was not even ever attached to it in the first place then then once it gets a little bit further that main tank that carried most of the fuel finally detaches and it falls and it burns up in the atmosphere and what's incredible about the fuel tank is that it weighs nearly 20 times the space shuttle itself and it just falls back to Earth all those trials all those failures all those human flaws one day as you ascend up they're going to detach from you and never be with you anymore glory to God oh but you see until then God uses those things to perfect you he uses those things to train you Hallelujah and just like those astronauts have to trust that control tower and the autopilot you know I can just imagine when they get to that point of deceleration you know these are some of the most highly trained individuals in the world they go through thousands of hours of simulations and and they they do countless number of training in years and years of training before they ever even step foot into that space shuttle you see and then as you've been trained you you go up and you have to recognize because the the the the autopilot has control of that vehicle as it's ascending up but the but the astronaut can actually take control of it you see and I believe when they get up into that and I'm not sure I couldn't find anything on it but I believe probably when they get to that point of deceleration they're probably you know oh my this this is this is why am I slowing down I was supposed to be speeding up I need I need to speed up but you see they've been in so many simulations that their faith takes over and they trust that autopilot and when it gets to that point when we Face something in our lives that seems so trying We Trust in our autopilot to take over glory to God that's true Faith amen taking our hands off the wheel and allowing God to be the one in Supreme control of your life operating his life through you you know and that's reaching a point where his Divine Purpose outweighs our Earthly desires you see the works of God will come but the astronaut faith is something so simple you see we still have something called Free Will those astronauts can still take over that aircraft but they don't need to you see God is hiding himself in Simplicity God became Jesus humbled himself to this position where he had all the power in the entire world and yet at this time that he could have shattered the world he could have had his angels shatter everything he kept silent because there was a purpose in play for he did only the will of his father Colossians 1 verse 23 says if he continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under Heaven whereof I Paul and made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even verse 26 even the mystery which has been hid from the ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of his glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory the mystery which was hid from the ages but now is made manifest Christ in you the hope of glory remember back to that quote the word of God man of the word of God manifested was once hard to understand now is made plain through that astronaut message brother Brennan brings amen It's Made Simple it's made plain God always makes it plain he hides himself in Simplicity always in Moon the Moon exploration the first flight to the moon the Apollo 11 1969 happened right you know right after the end of brother branham's life NASA recently launched a project and that project is called Artemis project Artemis had its first launch in 2022 when it successfully orbited the Earth and landed back in the Pacific Ocean the next scheduled takeoff for project Artemis I think it's a five-part series is in November 2024 and it will be what they call the furthest space exploration man has ever been on going further into space than ever achieved before in history you see it's typing the spiritual man's achievements always come close to when when God is achieving something brother random says this in uniting time in PSI 1963 you remember in the scripture what time is it Watchmen and the Watchmen come back and told him what hour it was see they kept time by the Stars Now isn't it strange that these stars were exactly in line for three men and nobody else saw it see just exactly in that line so now you can be it's so in line with the scripture see that when those stars become in unity United themselves together in this consolation three men also were United at the same time you can be so United with God in his word until these things become realities and you can see them and know that they are true see it's the sign of the time you might look over the top of it and say ah nonsense but it's the sign of the time amen going through a few quotes here this this evening if that's all right Amen brother random says it's a countdown 1962 paragraph 122 says oh I don't want Treasures of this Earth I have Treasures in Heaven thank God one day I stepped into that astronaut too but the body of Jesus Christ baptized in there by the Holy Ghost watching and waiting and listening at that countdown I see the Ages come by come by come by till the last age is counted off the next breath it's more than three minutes I mean less than three minutes science says it's three minutes for the earth to be bowed in time it's less than that the next breath of Jehovah is come out of it my people come up higher amen Psalms 86 11 says teach me thy way O Lord and I will walk in thy truth unite My Heart To Fear Thy Name there's this quote I read on on prayer and I read the other day it struck my heart it says you still may know you do not quite you still may know you still may say you do not quite see why a man who abides in Christ and in whom Christ's words abide should be allowed to ask whatever he wills and it shall be done unto him I answer you again it is so because it is in such a man as that there is a predominance of Grace which causes him to have a renewed will which is according to the will of God suppose a man of God is in prayer and he thinks that such is such a thing is desirable yet he remembers that he is nothing but a babe in the presence of his all-wise father and so he bows his will and asks as a favor to be taught what to will though God bids him ask what he Wills he shrinks and cries my Lord here is a request which I am not quite clear about as far as I can judge it is a desirable thing and I will it but Lord I am not fit to judge for myself therefore I pray thee give not as I will but as thou wilt oh my do you not see when we are in such a condition as this our real will is God's will deep down in our hearts we will only that which the Lord himself wills and what is this but to ask what will and it has done to us it becomes safe for God to say to the Sanctified Soul ask what that will and it shall be done unto thee he goes on to say uh the spiritual life is mastering him and so his aspirations Are Holy Heavenly god-like and will he and uh he has been made partaker of the divine nature and as a son is like a father so now in desire and will he is he is in line so close with God as the echo answers to the voice so does the renewed heart Echo the mind of the Lord our desires are reflected beams of the Divine will ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done it's a beautiful representation of trusting God's will over our own will our will sometimes asks and expects a certain thing and then something contrary takes place but you see then I remember I'm just a babe in his presence glory to God and then what I and his will has a purpose that flies me above the clouds and into another world amen brother random says this some of the principles of Faith here there's a couple quotes I want to get to he says this quote so struck me the other day brother Brandon makes this statement from his opening text in Mark the 11th chapter the context from the scripture the scripture is Mark 11 22 I believe Jesus answering said unto them have faith in God verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you whatsoever things you desire you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that you that your father also which is in heaven May forgive your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses this quote so struck my heart the other day brother random says this in perfect Faith he says now faith is based on forgiveness and then as we said this morning trying to get the church into a place to where they could really see Apostolic times moving Among Us that's what we all hunger for it's just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it who wants to see more of it hallelujah it's saying on the door we want to see more of it we want it in such a flow that it'll be a help to us and it'll flow out to others that's what I want in my life I wanted to be a help to me so that it can flow out to others amen if you don't but it said but if you don't even follow those instructions from Jesus he says neither will your father forgive you in some in simple instructions you know just a definition I Googled on forgiveness in general it involves an intentional decision to let go of resentment and anger holding something towards somebody can actually grip you and hold a grip on you and that grip can become a hindrance in your life that keeps you from where you are called to be with God you know that forgiveness doesn't always have to involve another person either most cases it does but when it when it does and when it does it's not always easy to forgive it takes determination amen it takes you know most importantly it takes prayer and supplication and a willingness but true forgiveness also involves ourselves you know we as humans we make mistakes we make a lot of mistakes amen who else is with me who makes a lot of mistakes amen but the prophet said simple instructions faith is based on forgiveness and I and if we don't forgive others and if we can't forgive ourselves and let go of those things which are in the past in Philippians that have said that you know the Bible says that there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus and if you Fester unforgiveness towards a brother or a sister or if you have something condemning your heart brother Brenham says it and picks that up in in in perfect Faith he would tie in that scripture John 3 21 where it says uh if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence then the if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence towards God so if our hearts condemn us then we can't have faith but if our hearts don't condemn us then we can have faith and then we can have confidence towards God but as long as you're doing things that's wrong you can't have confidence towards God you see you'll automatically know that you're wrong you'll automatically put yourself back there as a sinner by knowing you're wrong but when your heart don't condemn you and you know you are a Believer there's nothing between you and God you can ask what you will and it will be given because it's the word that's giving you to ask what you will Hallelujah I say we got a bunch of Bible Believers tonight amen those are some principles of Faith basic things that God wants to take us from here into those clouds and take us further into our Christian walk with him but in order to walk the way God wants to walk with us Philippians 3 brother brother and I count not myself to had apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching those things which are before pressing towards the mark who who is pressing towards that Mark tonight with me we're pressing towards something but you can't even go into that first scripture that second verse if you if you move past that first one if you don't forget about those things you don't lay it before the Lord now that doesn't that doesn't escape girl repentance you have to repent in your heart brother random showed that later on in that perfect Faith uh sermon you know uh he was talking with someone and they came to the prayer line and he was saying I'm just paraphrasing but it's in that sermon and he was talking to him and he said you know he said uh you you have such and such but you know but you need to make this thing right first you you have such and such that you're praying for but you need to go make such and such right with so and so you need to you need to go and apologize you may write with your wife make it right with your husband we're familiar with that so you can never bypass the repentant side of things but once you've repented once you're once you once it's under covered under the blood then you can move past that thing you can you can lay it aside you can forget it you can forget all about it and then you can press towards that Mark brother Benham says in nineteen uh 63 how can I overcome the devil wants you to mind him the first he made his attack upon to use his great power which he knowed he was the word he knowed his position you believe he did I the son of man he knowed his position and Satan come and wanted to use his own power on himself to feed him want to defeat himself you know in his greatest Temptations he a man gets hungry he'll do almost anything he says he'll still Rob big borrow anything see he had the appetite and Satan used his first great major assault upon him to take his power that he had been given to overcome with and use it on himself he didn't use it on himself no he used it on others that's right he used it on others not himself it wasn't for him though he could have done it he certainly could have done it but you see how the devil gets the devil wants you to mind him he minded only what the father said to do that's right he goes on to say the thought runs deeper than what it's wrote see it's inspiration oh I'm sorry I missed him he said he said why Satan said it's written he'd give charge of the angels He said yeah but it's also written see there you are see he knew who he was Satan didn't the thought runs deeper than what it's wrote see it's inspiration the colonel is on the inside of it you see what it really is the thought runs deeper the devil wants us to mind him and get caught up in those things get caught up in the trials get caught up in the things that maybe we don't understand get caught up in what some what somebody did to you get caught up in what we did to somebody else amen get caught up in my past faults living with guilt when the Lord's already done forgotten about it don't let don't even mind that stupid devil when he comes around and he says you remember this what you did in your past you remember that you remember you're the biggest sinner I know he comes in my mind and says that quite a bit because I know I'm the biggest sinner I know but then I can just search in the scripture and say well there's no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus and the only way I can stand and have the kind of faith that God God wants me to have if I have a heart that doesn't condemn me and there's no condemnation so praise the Lord devil I'm not going to mind what you're going to say hallelujah we're not going to mind what the devil says tonight we're going to have faith in God we're going to move past those things Hallelujah let Christ be in you let the word work through you and mine what the father said do he says this 1963 calling Jesus on this he says what a secure feeling knowing and watching the Holy Spirit change your nature from a vile person amen then we know we've passed from Death unto life to see the Holy Spirit living in us his life that's what the holy spirit is does he with astronaut Faith he lives his life through you Paul said the one the life that I once lived I live no more oh not me but the Christ that lives in me brother Benham keeps going on and he says then he had passed from Death unto life and Christ was alive in him safely secured Christ was the one guiding the ship Paul just had to sit there and Obey him notice God will make our bodies oh so obey him that he said in John the sixth chapter he thinks he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last body think of it our bodies obey when we have no more control over it and it turns back to a spoonful of dust God will speak to that body and it'll raise up again in the likeness of the resurrected Jesus Christ so what are you worrying about tonight it's in the hands of God let go for he will raise it up in the last day he promised to do it that's thus saith the Lord it's written in his word amen he's calling come up a little higher and two his perfect word amen and we as we as we move into our position in Christ you know as he identifies himself in us as we re as we reach our escape velocity one day we'll find ourselves walking so closely with what the father's will is amen where we find ours we're not living in the automobile age anymore where we let differences hinder our walk or you know we let we let the the speed limits hold us back from as fast as we need to go where we don't fellowship with with one another because of differences or past hurts he's calling higher than even airplanes when when the turbulence and the cares of life where we let carnal living and we let worldly entertainments and we let the unnecessary distractions of the weather you know affect our lives the you know and he doesn't you know even in even in the airplane mentality of things the Mind battles that we have can get us off course it's when we let those failures get to us astronaut faith is when you're so hidden Christ that there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus and not just saying that repeating a verse but believing it the ups and the Downs the bad days they don't affect your destination your destination is set I've just got to reach my escape velocity the failures shouldn't affect us anymore the Mind battles are proof to me that I'm on my way up and the devil wants me to mind him but I'm already pressurized amen hallelujah nothing's gonna stop us to God be the glory amen we bring into captivity every thought Under The Obedience of the word of God we enter into the Fellowship of the suffering recognize that those things are happenings because as we get higher and higher we get into that pressurized State and it's actually shedding off that extra cargo that we don't need to take with us that jettison State when we reach a certain point all of our Earthly baggage will fall into this atmosphere and will our Ascent will continue my title for tonight was was breaking through the atmosphere it's not it's not just trying to get so deep with things that we run ourselves in circles trying to understand it's so it's a simple hidden life in Christ you hear the word you recognize it to be the word then you act upon the word by saying Amen to it by what pastor's been preaching on not just saying amen with our words but living it in our actions living it through our lives letting the holy ghost live it through you doing only the will of the father earnestly contending for that faith that was once delivered to the Saints the faith when when they were beaten and mocked for the cause of Christ they walked or I read that acts the other day they walked away rejoicing that they could partake in the sufferings of Christ you know when Stephen operated his faith by forgiving them as they were killing him and he went even further he interceded on their behalf to the Lord you know flying higher isn't always you know something's far-reaching it's actually stepping lower than you've ever been before those astronauts are some of the most highly trained in the world they go through some of the most training yet when they get into that vehicle and the autopilot takes over and and they're going in there Ascent in outer space they have to trust that autopilot amen just a few just a few more minutes here tonight Saints amen praise the Lord God is good praise God while I was studying this I got a little curious about that word Artemis you know that Space Project NASA is working on we were talking about come to find out that dates all the way back that word dates all the way back to the early church the city of Ephesus Artemis was an idol that people worshiped in Ephesus you know when Paul the Apostle Paul goes and visits the Ephesian Church age and he begins preaching Jesus acts the 19th Chapter there was actually a specific Idol that they were that they would worship and I think Demetrius was his name and he actually made money by by selling this Idol and then you know he got upset with Paul because Paul said you know we don't worship idols made by human hands We Worship the Lord Jesus Christ and it caused his business to uproar and then he got all upset about it that Idol's name was Diana which is actually the Latin name for Artemis it became so popular in the city of Ephesus that they built an entire Temple dedicated to worshiping this Idol and interestingly enough that temple in art of Artemis actually was so large in fact that it made its way to the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World at one point in history I don't think it's a coincidence that today in the last Church age one of man's greatest scientific achievements is named after something that was hindering God's First Church age message in the first message at the the book of Ephesus NASA has no idea that they're operating in the hands of God the war the world has no idea what's going on around us you know you see it I have people coming to work all the time you know that you know they say all these things about you know the politics and they say well you know we need to get this person into office we need to get do this and you know no we don't we don't know it's it's the pressures are rising we don't we don't need to do anything except get get hidden in Christ and get ready for our Heavenly Ascent Hallelujah she recognizes the bride recognizes what what's taking place you know brother Brandon we had quoted back earlier in countdown brother Brandon talks about at modern science at the time coming together and discussing that Doomsday Clock what he's referring to is actually what they call the bulletin of the atomic scientist and it's something that they do to this day and they had an article that they met together I think the beginning of this year and it says unprecedented Danger Russia Ukraine war pushes ionic Doomsday Clock closest to midnight ever it's been in history and that was the latest report in history all based on it's this this scientific achievement it's all based on on science advancements and nuclear advancements in 1962 it was three minutes to midnight the latest Council determined that it was 90 Seconds To Midnight glory to God it's a scary thing for the world when you look at something like that but for God's people it's the countdown to go home glory to God pressures are rising oh but it just means our Ascent is starting to happen amen we're enjoying it today brother Branham says this he says we're enjoying it today sure we're in a great age paragraph 114 of the countdown 1962 a great time an astronaut age God give us astronauts give us men and women daring men daring women what did John Glenn and them have to do when they stepped into that tube they were Pioneers God wants Pioneers to this word astronauts who will take the things that we have got and not be satisfied with it but we're going on God is making achievements and I just love how the prophet says this one of these mornings God's achievement of his astronauts that's climbed into Jesus Christ been born in there by the Holy Ghost filled with his power one of these mornings the whole universe will be screaming and wailing and gnashing of teeth see when they've missed it when the Great Eagle powered by the Holy Ghost in fire begins to spread her wings the astronauts will take off into the sky to go meet the bridegroom when the bride takes off and the astronaut power of God Almighty who sent Jesus Christ to the Earth in the form of the Holy Ghost glory to God has brought the church through these achievements he says get in my brother my sister get pressurized the pressure won't hurt you when you get in the inside and get pressure get in Christ and won't care what the world says they can never hit you anyway you're safe you're tucked in you know liftoff isn't going to be the kind of show that that NASA makes it to be on TV as we go up it'll be a thief in the night come to collect his little bride the little bride that's done everything you need they need to do to prepare for him amen I just want to be so hid in Christ Jesus tonight that he can manifest his life through me in these things amen let's just stand to our feet this evening you know as man is coming to a place where achievements are at an all-time high especially in nuclear warfare and space exploration you know the countdown is on and with all these things happening around the world the world coming to an end I'm finding my rest in where I am I've climbed into Jesus Christ born again by the spirit of God I just love how the prophet says that Born Again by the spirit of God filled his power don't mind the devil friends that's the devil that beeping that's the devil don't mind him home to see my Jesus amen you know one of the amazing things about the countdown process is that it has to be absolutely perfect when they go and they are getting ready to launch the space shuttle into space everything has to be in line I I watched this video the other day and I just thought it was so incredible of the countdown process and you hear every every person in their position and they say this position ready this position ready this position ready all the way down to the smallest detail the weather the engines the computer the flight the crew every single aspect has to be in place before they can initiate the final countdown that is what is happening right now the countdown to our Heavenly fight and now there's just a few things that haven't come into alignment perfectly yet there's just a few of his people amen that he's waiting on to get sealed with the Holy Ghost to prepare for launch you know if you're one of those tonight that you know maybe you're not sure or even listen on
