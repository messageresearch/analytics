[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Good morning. Amen. Let's all stand. Amen. I want to greet all the guests this morning. Amen. God bless you. Amen. I see my buddy Teddy. That was the first person I laid eyes on. How you doing, buddy? Amen. Amen. [Music] How many just ready to enter into service in worship and praise? Amen. Amen. Amen. We're going to have a little bit of faulty this morning. Here we go. [Music] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now I'm found. Was blind, but now I see. My chains are gone. My chains are gone. I've been set free. My God, my savior, you're ransom me. And like a flood his mercy reigns. [Music] Unending love. Amazing grace [Music] the Lord has promised good to me. His word secure. Oh, he will my shield and shall be as long as life enduring. [Music] My chains are gone. I've been set free. My God, my save, your ransom me. And like the flood, his mercy reigns, unending blood. Amazing grace, my chains are gone. I've been set free. My God, my savior, your exom. And like a flood, his mercy reigns. Unending love. Amazing grace. The earth shall soon dissolve like snow. The sun forbid to shine. But God who called me here.

I needed somebody to break the chain, especially after Sunday school like that. being a leader. How many times you failed? But thank God he didn't. And he took that prize. He took it all the way to Calvary because you couldn't do it. And neither could I. Amen. Want to remember Sister Melissa this morning. She's visiting her mom. She is in the hospital. She's home now, but she's over there with her family and stuff. So, I want to remember her this morning. And um my son now, you know, when I gave my heart to the Lord, I was a party animal is what they would call. I drank, I smoked, did things that no Christian should be doing. But once I gave my heart to the Lord, it all disappeared one day, one moment. And my son um since he was early teenager, 15 16 has rebelled. He went out thinking that this isn't the life for him. He's 36 years old now. And he went through um rehab in LA for like 7 months. This was almost a year ago or so. And the first day he get out free going to North Dakota, he stopped at a motel, drunk himself into ICU after 7 months. So I went visit him. He got recovered from that and he continued up to North Dakota where he had a job. Um he as far as drinking goes, he was doing okay, but he can't handle people. Got four jobs up there, four good jobs. Um he'd probably been sober about six, seven months working at this job and he met a girl up there in church. She's a woman preacher by the way, but he's back in LA. Went back yesterday back to the same rehab place which basically um they don't let you do anything and they're checking you every day to make sure you're not drinking. you know, talking to brother Dale, and Dale was a mess before he gave his heart to the Lord. And it took one day, one moment in time, same as me. But he just keeps continuing thinking he's somehow going to do this on his own. And he can't until he comes to that. It's like my brother was preaching Sunday school, pride. You got to let go and let God. So, I want to remember them this morning. and I just want to give you an update on what he's doing. Let's pray. Father, I love you. The token still holds, Lord, in the name of Jesus, we hold the token over our loved ones, over the things in life that, Father, we struggle with. But we thank you, Father, for the victory in Christ Jesus, in all things. Lord, I pray that you have blessed this congregation this morning, those that would be streaming, those that would archive it, may the words that have come forth as our brother prayed this morning, may they reach down into our hearts and Lord, bring that seed to more life. We thank you for your goodness and mercy. We thank you for the comfort and the peace and joy that you give us, Father. We just pray Lord this evening, this morning. I'm sorry that you would bless the tithes and offerings. Bless our worship. May you receive it as being in spirit and in truth. Love and worship you this morning, Father, in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand. Amen. Amen. Let's sing a little bit of He Abides. Amen. [Music] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk this pilgrim way for the hands of God in all my life I see and the reason of my bliss. Yes, the secret all is this that the comforter abides with me. Let's put our hands together. will he abides. He abides. Oh, hallelujah. He abides with me. Well, I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk this narrow way. For the comforter abides with me play. Oh, he abides. He abides. Oh, hallelujah. He abides with me. I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk this narrow way. For the comforter abides with me. Well, once my heart was full of sin. Once I had no peace within till I heard how Jesus died upon the tree. Well then I fell down and there came up. Now the comforter abides with me. Everybody abides. He abides. Oh, hallelujah. He abides with me. Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk this narrow way. For the comforter abides with me. Sing it again. Oh, he abides. He abides. Oh, hallelujah. He abides with me. Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk this narrow way. For the comforter abides with me. Well, he is with me everywhere and he knows my every care. I am happy as a bird, just as free. Oh, for the spirit has control. Jesus sanctify my soul. Since the comforter abides with me, say he abides. Hallelujah. He abides with me. Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day as I for the conflict abides. One more time say he abides. [Music] He abides. He abide. Oh hallelujah [Music] with me. Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk this narrow way for the comforter of life. Listen last verse now.

Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day. As I walk this narrow way for the carpenter turn about with me. [Music] Amen. Amen. Amen. Brother Ken, if you come and give us a special this morning. Amen. Let's give Brother Ken a hand. Amen. Nope. Y'all can stay standing up. Come on, stand back up. Amen. I asked Ken to sing this song and I wanted it to kind of be a congregational. So, we're going to have a good time this morning. Amen. Let's give the Lord another hand. Hallelujah. Just a quick testimony. Uh couple Wednesdays ago, we asked Brother Jason to pray for our business. Um, not to go into all the details, but God gave us another location. And we were having a difficult time uh finding insurance for it. And um when we asked for prayer, it was like like a day or two later and God brought us not just a insurance policy, but a very good one at a great rate. &gt;&gt; So I just want to give the Lord glory and that's kind of what this song goes along with. So, you know, let's put our hands together and sing out with me on this song. Ain't no bird [Music] going to sing in my place. As long as I'm alive to glorify, I'll praise his name. I said there ain't no bird. We're going to sing in my place. As long as I'm alive to glorify, I'll praise his name. Oh, praise the Lord. Praise his name. As long as I'm alive to glorify, I'll praise his name. Oh, praise the Lord. [Music] Praise his name. As long as I'm alive to glorify, I'll praise his name.

Sister Brenda. Amen. if you come. I thank your nephew Jackson. Amen. Amen. Let's give him a hand. Amen. [Applause] [Music] [Music] You might not recognize me now. [Music] Those chains that once surrounded me are laying on the ground. [Music] You can't keep digging up my past. [Music] You may have had a laugh or two, but you won't get the last. You might not recognize me now. [Music] &gt;&gt; Maybe I was blind, but now I see. Maybe I was bound, but now I'm free. Maybe you need reminding you're under my feet. [Music] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're a lie that I don't need. Maybe you should listen when I speak. Maybe you need a minding. You're under my feet. If you want scars, I'll show you scars. All the wounds upon the hands of light that pierce the dark. If I were you, I'd be afraid. Cuz everything you meant for guilt. The cross is met with grace. [Music] Maybe I was blind, but now I see. Maybe I was bound, but now I'm free. Maybe you need reminding you're under my feet. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're a lie that I don't need. Maybe you should listen when I speak. Maybe you need a reminding you're under my feet. Oh. [Music] Oh. I think it's time you meet my maker. I think it's time you meet my maker. Oh. Oh. I think it's time that you remember. I think it's time that you remember. Maybe I was blind, but now I see. Maybe I was bound, but now I'm free. Maybe you need reminding. You're under my feet. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're a lie that I don't need. Maybe you should listen when I speak. Maybe you need a reminding you're under my feet. &gt;&gt; Maybe this is where we say farewell. Maybe you should get on back to hell. Maybe you need reminding you're under my feet. Under my feet. [Music] [Applause] Amen. Amen. I was tempted to sing a song, but I'm feeling the cause of the sister Dev to put her on the spot to give us a song. How you like that? Amen. Man, let's give Sister Deb a hand. Amen. [Applause] I did forewarn her. I said I may call you, but I was just wanting to kind of check her spirit. Amen. Amen. Let's give our sister another hand. Amen. [Music] I'm sure most of you know this song by now. It's really special to me because it it talks about how even if we don't really understand what's going on, that the Lord does have a plan. And sometimes it can be really hard to follow that plan, especially if you're really unsure about what you're supposed to do next and you just feel the the heat of the fire, but he his hand is still on you. And that has been a big lesson I've had to learn over the last few years. So, if you know the song, you can just sing along with me. And um I hope you appreciate the lyrics as much as I do. [Music] I know you're going through the [Music] hard heat. But even harder is the wondering is God's hand still on me. And it's lonely in the flames when you're counting days of pain. [Music] But the potter knows the clay how much pressure it can take. [Music] How many times around the wheel? Till there's submission to his will. He's planned a beautiful design, but it will take some fire and time. It's going to be okay [Music] cuz the potter knows the clay and I just came through that fire not too long ago. ago. And looking back, I can't see why. And that my God was in control. But on the hottest days, I'd cry, "Oh Lord, isn't it about time?" [Music] But the potter knows the clay how much pressure it can take. How many times around the week till their submission to his will? He's planned a beautiful design, but it will take some fire and time. It's going to be okay [Music] cuz the potter knows the clay how much pressure it can take. How many times around the wheel? [Music] Till there's submission to his will. He's planned a beautiful design, but it will take some fire and time. It's going to be okay [Music] cuz the potter knows the clay. [Music] [Applause] Amen. How many's ready for the word? Let's stand to our feet. When the music fades and all is stripped away and the simply comes longing just to bring something that's a word that will bless your heart. [Music] I'll bring you more than a song. For a song in itself is not what you have required. [Music] You search much deeper within through the way things appear. You're looking back to my heart. [Music] I'm coming back to a heart of worship. And it's all about you. All about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I've made. It's all about you. [Music] All about you, Jesus. [Music] King of endless world. No one could express how much you deserve. Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is yours. Every single breath you [Music] have. You search much deeper within through the way things appear. You're looking into my heart. I'm coming back to heart of worship when it's all about you. all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for things I made. All about you. [Music] All about you, Jesus. He's worthy of praise, friends. Give him a hand this morning to welcome the Lord. We come now to his word. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn around, shake hands with somebody. Say, "God bless you." Happy to have you all in the house of God today. Amen. Praise the Lord. Now, we got friends from all over today. Praise God. Happy to have you in the house of God today. Got friends from Virginia and Minnesota and Tennessee and Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord to my best friends. Brother Jason walked in. God bless you, Brother Jason. Happy to have you here today, Belle. Good to see you again, honey, sister. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Happy to have all of you. Amen. Y'all shake hands yet? Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you. We're going to invite you to Galatians chapter 3. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um Galatians chapter 3. We want to continue our thought that today should be part six, I believe. Uh we had a little mixup on the u on the YouTube site. I think it was showing four twice. Last time would have been five, so this would be six. So, we sent that correction in. And we're making some changes to the website. So, just for people streaming, I've had uh some emails and questions. We're working on some changes and making some changes, but you can always get the archive and the live stream on our YouTube channel. Amen. We're trying to get our website back function again and may already have it already. Um, brother Matt working on that diligently. Amen. Praise the Lord. Had a wonderful time yesterday. Amen. Uh, at the wedding there with brother Joshua. And I was told, make sure you call him Joshua. Amen. and I had to call her Isabelle. And so instead of Josh and Belle. So I told them to make sure they were in by 9:00 last night, but I don't think they listened to that. &gt;&gt; Did they? Okay. Praise the Lord. Well, you're supposed to uh listen to your pastor. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Brother Doug, it's so good to see you guys. Uh they walked into the wedding yesterday and I thought they've stepped I thought I was seeing a vision. Amen. And there they were. Come to the wedding. who are happy in the Lord for all of that. And one and all, God bless you today. Let's look at Galatians chapter 3. We're going to begin at verse one and we'll read down and we'll skip a little bit along here just to save time. We're continuing on future events becoming clear in prophecy. And don't forget, don't forget the theme of the whole thing. Whether we were in our previous nine-part series of past events, modern events, but now future events, don't forget that the bride of the last day is the most significant modern event made clear in prophecy. So, it's all about you uh becoming everything that God has envisioned for his family. We're going to look today and he's been planning it a long time. To God, it's not a long time, but to us, it's covered it's covered multiple millennia. Oh foolish Galatians verse one Paul says who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you. This only would I learn of you received you the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith? Are you so foolish having begun in the spirit? Are you now made perfect by the flesh? Have you suffered so many things in vain, if it be yet in vain? He therefore that ministerth to you the spirit, and workketh miracles among you, doth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith, even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. And the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. So then they which be of faith are blessed with fa faithful Abraham. Verse 13, Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us. For it is written, Cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree, that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. Verse 16. Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not and to seeds as of many, but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ. Hebrews chapter 2, one quick verse. If they'll just put that up for me. Um, by the time you find it, I'll probably have already read it. Hebrews chapter 2, verse 10. For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. So, he's bringing many sons to glory. It wasn't just after Abraham, right? And so God was never going to be satisfied to just stay bottled up in one Nazarene walking the shores of Galilee going about doing good. Right? The whole plan, remember that he said before the gospels ever came, God was already before the gospels was preaching this what you read in the Gospels, he was preaching it to Abraham. So Paul was saying what I'm saying agrees with the gospels which agree with Genesis. So this is a a great example of this dovetailing of the scripture from Genesis to the four gospels to Paul's letter to the Galatians. There's no break. It's all saying the same thing. And now Paul is trying to get them to understand he's bringing many sons to glory. So let's then look. How many would like to be part of that? Sons and daughters. Amen. Amen. And so, uh, so we I've said many times, you know, when we talk about sons, you sisters have to say amen, too. Uh, because I have to say amen when he says bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's all when he talks about man, very often times it's a Hebrew word or a Greek equivalent meaning mankind or humanity. Amen. So, he's bringing many sons, many members of the kingdom. That's always been the plan. Everything you see is all about that. All right. So, let's pray. Master, we commit ourselves into your hands right now and we ask for your divine mercy, Lord, upon our lives and upon the preaching of the word. Lord, we're going to take another installment today. We already can see, Lord, that it's more than we can cover today. There's more yet to say after today, but may it be so that today we will say exactly what you want said today. May it be so, Father. We commit it to you and ourselves into your hands for service and leadership. Just your assistant. That's all I am. I'm just here to assist you, Lord. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. God bless you, friends. You can be seated. that just so leapt out at me this morning. How that Paul from his vantage point, you know, sometime after the crucifixion, the death, the burial and resurrection, ascension, the descending of the spirit back into the church. And now the church is running toward um the resurrection. And Paul has birthed a church there in Galatia. And Judaizers have come in behind him and uh sewing discord and sewing seeds of discrepancy trying to get the people back to observing various elements of the of the of the u the law of Sinai. But but if they could have only realized friends that what Paul was trying to get across to them is that the law from Sinai uh you know first of all was not they called that the law of Moses but that really wasn't the law that wasn't Moses doing and I get the I don't want to argue over semantics I'm just wanting to make a point. I get that that law came and and Moses brought it to them on tables but Moses didn't write it. The finger of God wrote it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it was never Moses idea. In fact is it was not it was really not God's intention, but it was the people. And prophet talked about it was the the most rational decision they ever made. They ha that they had a pillar of fire. They had a prophet. They had a a cloud by day, fire by night. They had the brazen altar. They had everything working uh under grace, under the promise. God was fulfilling to his children what he had promised Abraham. And here they come along wanting a part in it. They wanted to feel like we're accomplishing something and they wanted works. They chose works. They chose law over grace. &gt;&gt; So So when we when we call it the law of Moses to me the the the law that that law of Sinai was the people's choice. The law of Moses had always been, "The Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like me &gt;&gt; from among your brethren, and whoever won't hear him will be cut off." That was the law of Moses because otherwise you can't make it fit when you get across Jordan and you've got God telling Joshua, now Jordan represents, you know, crossing over into the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and now crossing over into the Canaan's land, the Holy Ghost, not the millennium, the Holy Ghost. And now God says remember the law of Moses. And you're thinking, well, wait a minute. Now it's almost like God is contradicting himself in the type. Now the type is broken. You mean in the Holy Ghost, we're coming back to a man-made law from Sinai? No. The law of Moses was about a Messiah coming. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost that it wouldn't just be God above or God with, but God in. And that would reproduce in a kingdom of saints. &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful plan. the plan of redemption. And so, so we realize then that that overall as we've been studying it, the prevailing view across both Jewish and Christian traditions concerning the name change of Abraham, we dealt with that a lot last Sunday. I want to talk about some more about it today. We want to carry on from there. But it it doesn't matter whether it was Jewish tradition. We went back and quoted to you historians and and and great thinkers under the man age and Matthew Henry and and and and and t trap I believe and and some other different ones and there were other ones also. Augustine spoke about it and so Origin spoke about it. But but we find that that they were they all agree that the name change when God changed Abram's name to Abraham that it was a pivotal moment that that it was a pivotal moment in the redemptive plan that we're talking about today. Brother Brandham talks about how that, you know, there we're there's times when we're, you know, on our journey back home, uh, that we're turning a corner and, you know, it just like it signals it signals elevation like when we read um, Revelation 4. See, we we know that Revelation 4 is caught up into the revealed word. And and I get that at the end of chapter 3, and we've taught on that. I'm not going to get sidetracked in that today. the bride goes up. That's all true. Brother Brandham then begins to explain that chapters 5 and four is God from 4 through 10 showing how he raptured that church at the end of seven ages. Oh, you're headed for a rapture. You are at the end of the seventh age. &gt;&gt; There wasn't an eighth one. There wasn't an eighth messenger. He only had seven stars in his right hand. And so what what we look for then if it's not our body change then what is it then it then it becomes a spiritual elevation and we remember that our entire journey of life and here's where we were really uh trying to get you to understand in these previous sessions because this is where your real strength to beat the devil down will come from an understanding of who you are in Christ and what Christ has done on your behalf and that when the bride recognizes who she is in that position and that and that she came from God and goes back to God, we remember that our entire earthly journey, don't lose sight of this. If you leave here today and this is all you remember, it's a journey uh going back home. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a journey of restoration. Because I'm here to tell you, home for me is not this drop-own place called time. &gt;&gt; No sirm. It's not where I started. I didn't start here and I'm not finishing here. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in the message perfection, that's a great title. 1956. Now, this great chain of perfection and he he's he's going to actually draw a circle. I started to put it up here today and he and it's a circle representing we were dealing with that yesterday at the giving and receiving of rings. It's an eternal circle. And he says, "Now this great chain of perfection was broken by time space." So, so remember that that you know I preached here some maybe a year ago. Life interrupted and life interrupted is not the hardships that I've had in this life are the losses. I'll have more hardships. &gt;&gt; I'll have more losses. I'm never going to get beyond those. I'm going to finally get beyond them. But man that's born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble. And so it's just you're either you either just come out of a hardship or a trial or you're in a hardship or a trial or you're headed for a hardship or a trial. &gt;&gt; But my journey is not to stay here. My journey is to escape here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so, so we we realize that that the fact that I was in Christ and that I came here, that is my life interrupted. &gt;&gt; My life interrupted is that I used to be a part of God. Thank God I'm going back to that when this awful interruption is over. So he says this great chain of perfection was broken by time space. Time came because of sin. Let's draw a picture of time. Let's see a perfect circle forever. Forever. And then all of a once sin dropped in and put a little and he says as my wife calls it a little hickey or a little drop down in the chain. So now instead of a perfect circle, you've got this little drop down, this little loop 6,000 years &gt;&gt; of human history in a fallen condition. Eventually it comes back into the circle again. &gt;&gt; Now the circle of eternity didn't stop. &gt;&gt; Only we got interrupted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says eternity continues on. See, so so brother Brandham talks about how that, you know, sin, you know, broke the whole picture and and but brother Brandham says, "But you come anyway. You still arrived here, but you were born lost." See, so then Jesus has to come and pay that price to redeem you back. So he says, "Eternity continues on, but it's not in its perfect condition. Here's a little gap come down, breaks over this way, goes out this way. God had to do that because Satan caused it and it dropped down to a space of time. Here's why, friends. For here, here's here's the here's the essence of every trial loss that you've ever faced. God did it this way. God had to do that because Satan caused it and it dropped down to a space of time for the trying and the perfecting and the purging of the lost. That God by his sovereign grace might someday lift that little hickey or gap back into the perfect circle. Then she rolls on just the same. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we found a bride identified in the word with a higher calling because that's what the word does for us. The revelation of the word of God is not just theology or or doctrinal, you know, memorization skills. It's not really about that. There's, you know, there there there's there's one man that I heard about as growing up and they called him the walking Bible. The man had literally committed to memory 6,000 Bible verses. And I mean, I'm thinking, wow, do I can I even quote six verbatim and not miss a word? And this guy's got 6,000 of them. They called him the walking Bible. God bless him for that effort. But but that's not my requirement. That's not your requirement. The bride is identified by the word that she has a calling that is not something she did herself. It is a calling from God. It is a blessing from God. But now here's where it circles back to come to you and I. It calls you to a higher responsibility. &gt;&gt; The world loves walking around in a candy shop thinking that Jesus paid it all and I don't have to do anything. That's not the gospel. That's never been the gospel and that will never be the gospel. The whole point of the gospel, the whole point of the Holy Ghost is to change you into him, &gt;&gt; not leave you as you. &gt;&gt; If he was going to leave you as you, he would have never had to die anyway. See? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so then we've observed uh in our past sessions that God uses the the Hebrew out of the Hebrew alphabet. And I and it's it looks like an N, but it's it's actually three letters. It takes three English letters to to pronounce it. It's he h e h he it's like the breath of god. So it's actually the very letter it's the breath of god that created the world. And it's and here was the point we were making last time that it is that exact same letter that he that same creative breath that produced a creative word. That's the exact same uh power word and even the very same letter that God employed when he was changing Abram to Abraham. So you can rest assure that it was with that kind of involvement that God is going to use Genesis power to do something that it wasn't just listen Abram go down to the court county clerk and fill out a document and sign it and get your name changed. &gt;&gt; This wasn't just some casual name change. God literally summoned the creative power of his word. He was doing more than just changing letters of his name. He was he was showing you and I that he doesn't just make us Baptist or Methodists or Presbyterians. He makes us Mrs. Jesus Christ. This is a supernatural change that occurs by the supernatural word &gt;&gt; that you put your faith in. See, so it's literally the breath or the word of God speaking creation into existence. So you should be able to see today that your new birth is an act of the exact same creative word. &gt;&gt; That's what the new birth is. It's not something you can do yourself. It's not something you can confess. It's not a prayer you can read. It's not words you can say. It's not any of that thing. It's not any kind of life you can live. It's God by his creative power finding his children and sending them his creative word. And his children who are part of that word recognize that word. It is innate. It is intrinsic. They they can't not believe it. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And the evidence of that that it's supernatural is that it changes their life completely. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're in no way the same person. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, this is exactly what James was talking about in James 1:18. Don't bother trying to follow me. Let me just quote it. Of his own will begget he us with the word of truth. &gt;&gt; So, don't ever let anyone say to you, "You got born again because you made a decision to read a sinner's prayer." &gt;&gt; You might have read a sinner's prayer. You might read a thousand of them. You might have knelt at an altar and you might have got born again there, but all you did was find out you had always been a child of God. &gt;&gt; When the supernatural takes place, that's what really reveals it to you. And in that revelation becomes a strength. And friends, that's why you notice that that Abraham, you know, once he moved into the office of of he became a father and now a son comes on the scene. My goodness, before that, he gets caught lying down. He first of all he backslides and leaves the promised land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because why? Trials and hardship. &gt;&gt; They had a famine. So he took off and he hadn't, you know, had a hard time fully obeying God. Took his father with him and and that held up 10 years and then he finally got somewhere and then the famine came. Then he's you find him backslid. He any Jew that leaves Palestine there, brother Am says that leaves the promised land is backslid. And so he goes down there. We see him lying, you know, to to save his skin full of fear. Yeah, &gt;&gt; Sarah, they'll kill me. You're going to have to lie. See, that's why we we have said to you so many times, it's Paul's not saying Abraham never made a mistake. Paul's saying Abraham never stumbled at the promise. &gt;&gt; Even though it looks a lot of times by the observer, wow, you're down there afraid. You're out of the promised land. You're lying to Pharaoh. You almost get killed. You almost lose Sarah. You pick up Hagar. Your people are paying for that to this day. And then and then what do you see him next? Then he's then he's over here in front of the king of the Philistines. Uh listen Sarah, that same old thing. See friends, all that happens is when you come to Christ and you don't come to a full new birth, you just keep a little ticking time bomb down inside there. And all it needs is the right environment and the right time and the right setting to come around and that thing will blow up again and again and again. You've got to die and get that picking time bomb out of you. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so once he has Isaac and now you can see that now you have the son on the scene. And once sunship comes on the scene, you don't find Abraham doing that anymore. See, then he's faithful to the Lord from then on, even willing to kill his son uh to prove his faith. That's pretty intense. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here he was trying to save his own skin and now he's willing to take his son, his only son, as far as God was concerned. First Peter, so so James 18 said, "Of his own, of his own will begott he us with the word of truth." Amen. That here's why. That we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures. &gt;&gt; So he saved you to make him like him. &gt;&gt; To make you like him. &gt;&gt; Peter says the same thing. 1 Peter 1:23 123 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, &gt;&gt; but of incorruptible by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. So your new birth comes because you have a faith in the revealed word of God. It's always been that. It's never not been that. There's no form of the gospel of Jesus Christ that has ever been different than that. Even back in the Old Testament, it was always that it was God has spoken. You're either going to believe it and follow it or you won't. &gt;&gt; And and and it and if you don't, none of your good deeds will matter. And if you do, none of your bad deeds will matter. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, his creative word is what sets the divine purpose for our lives. Would you agree with that? &gt;&gt; Amen. So we find then that the same creative word that changes our nature in the realm of our soul that same that same creative word that brother Brandham says now that puts the believer back across the chasm. &gt;&gt; See and remember we're sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. That's right now my soul is already in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. You say, "But but your soul's in your body." Exactly. And that's where Jesus rules and reigns inside my heart. You see, stop looking at God and trying to divide him up in per in persons, places, and things. God fills all time and space and eternity. See? So, it doesn't matter that he rules from heaven. He lives in me. He lives in you. &gt;&gt; See? &gt;&gt; All right. So, a lot more to say on that. I don't won't have time to get to it today. I've already set it aside for a different portion. So, it's that same creative word that puts us back across the chasm, that chasm that exists between the land we came from and the land we live in now. &gt;&gt; And Jesus bridged that chasm. You came from God, but you came here fallen. A chasm between you. No way to get back. Jesus Christ bridged that chasm for his family. So, through Christ, I am joined back to God. I'm enjoined through the blood of Jesus back to Abraham. Now I'm a son of Abraham. &gt;&gt; See, so the same power that raised Jesus from the dead is the same power that quickens our inner life. Uh quickens it quickens our inner life that was deep within us as a gene of God all along. And it is when that quickening comes to pass by that same power that raised Jesus from the dead, it molds us into the image of the children of Abraham. And it makes us hes according to the same promise given to him. I mean, ask yourself a question. When that quickening power came back to Jesus in a grave, did he still look like a dead man? &gt;&gt; Not at all. In fact is when they came to find him, all they found was a napkin and his garment. They didn't even find him. He was not in a tomb. He was not dead. He was completely changed. And that same power that raised Jesus, if it quickens your mortal body, it shall also make you a new creation. And you won't be the same as you were before. Amen. &gt;&gt; So in he in this Hebrew word uh he is symbolic symbolically and this is from my lexical aid it is associated with another Hebrew word if I'm pronouncing it correct bina b i i n ah and it means understanding. So I want you to know something friends the same god that saved you understands you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows &gt;&gt; what you're going through. &gt;&gt; Don't think that he is some far removed god unconcerned. Nothing could possibly be further from the truth than that. &gt;&gt; He has tremendous understanding. In fact is this this word this symbolically associated word uh ba it means a divine attribute and it's actually used in the Old Testament 38 times. I'm not going to cover them all today, but Proverbs Solomon speaks about it and how that it it was personified as the companion of wisdom and he urged people in Proverbs 2 and 3, he urged people to seek for it. So, seek wisdom, seek understanding. You're not, you know, it's not just, you know, uh, like you've heard me say so many times, God didn't say, "Okay, you're saved. see in heaven. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Or yeah, the ship of Zion is coming. Take your luggage and go down to the docks and sit on your luggage. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Wait for the old ship of Zion. No, he wants you to have understanding. When the bride has understanding, &gt;&gt; why are we preaching this series? So we have biblical understanding of how I got here, why I'm here, why I got chosen, why I'm born again, what am I to do, where am I going, how am I getting there? Amen. &gt;&gt; What do all of these modern events that I see happening that has men's hearts failing for fear in the world in gross darkness? How is it that I see it all so clearly and I know what it's I know what's up. I know the why. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, how are we going to get out of here? I know the how. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. Uh Lee used to say, "I know the the very hour that the Lord is coming." And when people finally, you know, put their false teeth back in their mouth and caught their breath. And brother Lee, what's the hour of his coming? In the hour you think not. So it it's also the same word. It's a companion to wisdom. It's the exact same spirit that that fell upon them when they were erecting the tabernacle in the wilderness. You find that in Exodus 31, Exodus 35. Isaiah describes it uh as the coming Messiah is endowed with the spirit of wisdom. Isaiah 11, various places. So it it it it comes back to just more than a knowing the what. I know the how and I know the why. And that should inform our thinking on our daily life. Am I just living here and getting an education and getting a career and getting married and having a family, paying bills, paying taxes, take vacations, uh start all around again, go work, come back, get some sleep, eat, go back, do the next same thing. Is that all there is to life? I I'm here to tell you friends, that's not even real life. That's just this little hickey. That's just this little uh wayside station. I'm going back to an eternity. Hallelujah, friends. And I I won't have to face these kinds of things. I'm so glad to know I'll never have to come back here and do this again. &gt;&gt; It gives me ba. It gives me understanding. I I have found the companion to wisdom. And therefore I now I'm know what to do with all this wisdom because now I have understanding how to how to employ it. So you you see this actually in Abraham as well. Genesis 18 uh 16 uh 17 and 18. And the men arose up from then and looked towards Sodom. Now this is the days of Lot. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now think Luke 17:30. This is in Genesis, right? Luke 17:30 is foretold in the gospels that at the end time, the gospels foretell that at the end time it would return back to the days of Lot. And the same principles that applied there would apply here. That's what the gospel message is telling us. And the men rose up from then and looked towards Sodom and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. And the Lord said, "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?" Now, we're coming back to ba. We're coming back to wisdom. We're coming back to understanding. Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do? Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him. Abraham and his wife were still barren. I mean, you know, as as far as bringing the promised son on the scene, there's no Isaac. And so, he's come now to say about this time next year, you'll have a son. He had he had a son through Hagar. But here is here is Sarah in her old age. Her name has been added an H also, just like Abram to Abraham. Sarai went to Sarah because God is also the same the same word that that brought forth Christ is the same word that brings forth the bride. &gt;&gt; The same power that raised him is the same power that changes you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You both have the same origin. &gt;&gt; You both have the same makeup. You're both made of the same element, the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so this is why you have the faith of the son of God. Not you're not limited to a faith in the son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The unwise virgin have a faith in the son of God and are saints and sanctified people and righteous people and will be granted eternal life because of their heart response to the word. But we're not talking about just a faith in the son of God. We're talking about the faith of the son of God. So, so we find that he he says, "He shall become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him." Now, James picks up on that in James 2:23, "And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith," Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness, and he was called the friend of God. See, &gt;&gt; Jesus talks about that. St. John called that and wrote it in his in his gospel. St. John 15:15, "Henceforth," Jesus speaking, "henceforth I call you not servants, for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth, but I have called you friends. For all things that I have heard of my father, I have made known unto you." See, so now when you come back to Genesis, we left off in God saying, "Seeing that Abraham shall surely become shall verse 17, shall I hide anything from Abraham, seeing he shall become a great and mighty nation? The all the earth shall be blessed in him." Then verse 19, for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. &gt;&gt; Now, the children of Israel almost became everything the anti of that verse, &gt;&gt; right? The children of Israel rebelled. They constantly made mistakes. All even God's very finest made mistakes. &gt;&gt; You remember even Moses losing his temper, got kept out of the promised land. You you find what David did, what Solomon did. You you find all and Brother Bram talks about, you know, the the record of those with all of these blemishes in the record, and it almost seems like they wouldn't even qualify. But but none can deny that they were used of God. See, and he says there's many more with these serious problems in their lives than there ever was. People like Joseph who only had one little scratch that he kind of used a little bit of guile when his daddy was talking to Pharaoh and he and and he and and he wasn't really supposed to do that. And but of course his daddy being a prophet wouldn't wouldn't lie and he just told Pharaoh, "What do you do for a living? Your servant are shepherds?" Oh, Dad, don't tell him you're shepherds. That's an abomination to Egypt. So, you know, even Joseph was uh bending a little bit, feeling a little bit of political pressure, little bit of social anxiety, uh because, you know, kind of things I don't want to stand out on. But, but that was Joseph's only little thing, one little scratch. Oh, friends, I'm here to tell you something. God never changed his opinion. He never went back. There's not a verse 20 that says, "Until they start sinning and falling away and then I'm just going to be done with them." No, he says his household after him, they shall keep the way of the Lord. They shall do justice and that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he have spoken. I'm here to tell you, we got all of our problems. They had all of their problems. But God doesn't change his mind about what he says about you, about Abraham, about Israel, about David. &gt;&gt; Did they have flaws? Yes, they had them galore. But God never went back and amended his word. He didn't need to because he knew in the end his word would finally conquer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. By the way, brother Brandham said Jesus never screamed at devils. He didn't have to scream at them. He knew that his words could not fail because he knew who he was. And he knew that someday his word would conquer. Hallelujah. Friends, we have arrived at a day when he is conquering a people's heart and minds to to the degree that it's going to have an unprecedented event and take a global bride and a body change and raise the dead for hundreds of years out of the grave. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; For I know him and I know his people after him. Verse 20. And the Lord said, "Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievious, I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether, according to the cry of it which is come unto me, and if not, I will know." And the men turned their faces from then, and went towards Sodom. But Abraham stood yet before the Lord. And Abraham drew near and said, "Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? Per venture there be 50 righteous within the city. Will thou also destroy and not spare the place for the 50 righteous that are therein?" Look at what he says. It's so audacious. I mean you think the audacity of this guy that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee? Shall not the judge of all the earth do right? I want you to know Abraham knows exactly who he's talking to. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; He knows. He knows the man that met him at the tent door was that's why he bowed to worship him. Called him Elohim, &gt;&gt; my Lord. Call him that name. And if you look back in the in the in the in the Hebrew, that name that he used for when he he referred to uh that one standing there, it is only exclusively, it's never any other way. It is used exclusively for the God of creation. He knew that this man that this was God in human form, not the one that met him on the road uh from the slaughter of the kings. That was God in a theophotic theophonic appearance, a prefigure of Christ. This wasn't just a prefigure of Christ. This was almighty God visiting him. We've had all kinds of prefigures down through the church ages, but we're promised in the last day that the very literal God will come down and dwell in flesh. And it won't just be a prophet. It'll be a whole people. &gt;&gt; It'll be the entire word uh filling up God's role of the Lamb's book of life. Oh, what an hour that we live in. So we see in Abraham's involvement with God's plan, it's actually he's part of the process for God to arrive at his ultimate vision. And that's a key part. So I want to say it again. Abraham knew this God because that's that's that's the desire that Paul says that I may know him. &gt;&gt; See, that I may know him in the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death. See, if I might attain to the resurrection also. So, so we realize that this whole idea of So, I've connected the dot for you that that literally the same creative word that made you a believer is the same creative word that changed your nature, the same creative word that gives you understanding of who God is. And the world thinks they know who Jesus is. And they think they know what kind of a deity he is. And it shows in their life. And it shows in their churches that they don't understand him at all. &gt;&gt; He's not a swinging hipster. He's not a cool dude. He's the living God Almighty. And he he's holy and he's righteous. He's all powerful. &gt;&gt; He's to be revered. You're you're to come before him soberly. You're to come before him with thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Not here to tell him what to do. I'm here to be like him. &gt;&gt; Amen. So th this is that this is what it done for Abraham. You can see it in the shadow in the type of the Old Testament in Genesis. It's why the entire gospels everything we preach can be preached right out of the book of Genesis. The entire book of Revelation can be preached right out of the book of Genesis. No one knew that until the seals were open and we could see it. So we we see then that that it's becomes part of God's plan and Abraham now drew near the other the the the angels to Sodom separated. &gt;&gt; They had a different mission. &gt;&gt; But Abraham, seven letter Abraham drew near. &gt;&gt; First of all, who's got the courage to do that? And then he put it upon himself to speak. Let me just speak. And then he gets to 40 and I'll speak once more. And it gets to 30, I'm gonna Don't be angry. I'm gonna speak once more. It gets to 20. Oh, let me just speak once more. And then he gets to 10 and he's still speaking. And every time he comes forward with a feeling in his heart, God agrees. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything that Abraham thought, this is how it should be. God was like a man after my own heart. We think exactly alike. No wonder he could know that Abraham and Abraham's children, Hello, Abraham's children. He knew we'd believe the word. He knew we would think like him. He knew we would have a world view that is shaped by this. &gt;&gt; He knew we would love the word. He knew he wouldn't have to beg us to serve him or prod us to serve him or beat us to serve him. He knew our love would anchor in my heart and I'd say, "Lord God, I want to serve you every day of my life. I want to be just like you in every aspect." &gt;&gt; You don't get that just by the acquiring of knowledge and doctrine. &gt;&gt; That's why it has to be an experience. See? So, so I want you to understand that Abraham now, as do you, has an involvement. So, per adventure, you thought that I just need to go to church today. Why? Well, it's Sunday. It's, you know, a little after 10:00. The Sunday school starts. We better get moving. and you drove through traffic and you burned fuel and put wear and tear on your tires in your vehicle and you came in here and you sit here and you're sitting here still listening to a crazy man scream and yell and wave his hands. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; What are you nuts? So many better things you could be doing with your life. You could be out making money, honey. A lot of people are. &gt;&gt; But why why are we here? Because I have an involvement. Yes, &gt;&gt; there's some intrinsic knowing. There's some internal compass that tells me, "No, no, I I'm not just coming to church. I'm not just coming to a building. I It might not even be inside of these four walls. I'm I'm doing like Abraham. I'm moving near to God &gt;&gt; because there's something in me, a deep calling, a deep drawing me. I can't help that that or Roberts and Billy Graham went that way. I'm not that's not my message. My message is I'm Abraham. Seven letters. Abraham. I'm here to worship Elohim. I'm part. I've got a part of his name. &gt;&gt; The same H in Elohim is now in Abraham. The same H that's in Elohim is now in Sarah. Hallelujah, friends. And it it it changes our whole thinking. It changes the whole reason we're at church today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we're part of it. I'm actually a facilitator of the rapture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're a facilitator of the resurrection. Absolutely. What brother taught us that when the headstone comes down and it comes down and connects with that body, he said the dead for hundreds of years will come right up out of the ground. That's you. That's you involved with him. &gt;&gt; See? So, so we see his involvement with God's plan. We see his involvement with the process for God to arrive at his ultimate vision. So I just simply say today, now it's our turn. &gt;&gt; Bride of the last day. &gt;&gt; Now it's our turn. Now it's your turn to become involved. It's your chance to step forward. It's your chance to not stay back. It's your chance to go forward and begin to speak and begin to pour your heart out. Because what you'll find is the more the closer you get to him and the more you have these heart heart-to-he heart talks, you'll find you love him more and more and more and more and you get so filled up with the love for him, it changes everything. You start overcoming things you never could overcome. You get strength you never knew you had. You find yourself and you find yourself soaring like an eagle you're supposed to be. &gt;&gt; It's when you don't step near him. Be a seed gene of God as you might be. Be b have it birthed by the Holy Spirit. But if you don't have your life stepping toward him, if all you ever do is step away from him and step toward if all you ever do is step toward an education, a career, friends, social media, politics, step toward recreation, step toward this, this that you'll never you'll never find that that life, that energy, that strength that that can satisfy you when you lay your head on your pillow at night and know that your life is walking in the order of God's There is nothing so satisfying to a Christian in his soul as to be able to close your eyes at night say, "Lord, I love you. I thank you for this life today. Tomorrow I'll go forward and I'll serve you again and you get a however much sleep you get and you wake up and you're still talking to him. Lord, good morning. I love you. I don't even want to put my feet on the floor until I say I love you and I want to serve you and I put my feet in the name of Jesus Christ on this floor. I'm here to do your will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what and only what will accomplish that is when you recognize your position and own your responsibility. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To step near him and commune with him. So it's a kingdom of saints. kingdom of saints that were planted in the earth, born in sin, redeemed back to God, and have bodies like unto his glorious body. Brother Brandham says it like this astonishing statement. Who is this mazdc? And the one that left home only come to the earth to serve his purpose. Is that right? &gt;&gt; All right. Then after it's finished, it's brought back in a glorified state. It's matured and brought back again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Friends, what is the gospel about if I don't live with that knowledge? Why what's why am I here? I'm not here to just to just be on the earth. I have accepted a purpose. I have realized that I've had a name change like Abraham has. &gt;&gt; He no longer calls us just church. He calls us bride because we've been called out of a church. And you remember last week or the week prior, we found that it was illegal. It was against the word of God to ever go back and refer to Abraham as Abraham again. You you don't ever let the devil get you to confess anything other than you are the virgin uh virgin bride of the Lord Jesus Christ and stand perfect in his sight. &gt;&gt; Don't ever let your lips betray that. See? So, so we see then that that in the gospels when when Jesus comes to Matthew 13. All right, I've got about 15 minutes of regulation. You good? I shouldn't need more than that. So, when we when we come to Matthew 13, hey, let's have a look at that. Brother Mark, I think we'll put that up. Matthew 13. We're going to catch three verses. We're going to start at verse 36 because in the in the Gospels now, we're going to see a further phase of this great plan because it was never going to be just Abraham. It's a coming kingdom. Remember, he said, "I know that he'll do it in all of his all of his seed after him." So, the gospels are there now. And now Abraham got a name change from Abraham to Abraham. That was a very significant event. Now the gospel's come forward and now it's going to really accelerate. We're going to ramp see God's plan begin to ramp up in Matthew 13 and uh we'll catch 36 37 and 38. Then Jesus sent the multitude away. He' just given the parable of the swer and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tears of the field. He answered and said unto them, he that sweth the good seed. Look how simple this is. He that sweth, so you've got a person seowing seed and it's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? He that sweth the good seed is the son of man. &gt;&gt; Verse 30, verse 38. The field is the world. The good seed are the children of the kingdom, but the tears are the children of the wicked one. So when we when we look at that we can see that the gospels are continuing to develop our understanding more and more and more about how it's the divine word uh is is actually joined to creation. Now you remember we have already showed you that he the breath of God the same Hebrew letter that he used to change Abram's name to Abraham is the same thing he used to say let there be &gt;&gt; right so so now we're coming to the gospel and we're seeing that that that the that the gospel itself this divine word is actually part of the continuation of creation. Amen. &gt;&gt; It It's not a It's not a different power. It's not a different person. It's the same God, the same Jesus according to the book of Colossians that the everything that's made was made by him. John John chapter 1 declares the same thing. Colossians chapter 3 declares the same thing. That there's not anything made that he didn't make. See? And so now that same one that created it all, that changed Abraham is now here in the Gospels alive and he's giving us the revealed word. So I want you to the the point I want to make that you connect the dot to is that this creative power is attached to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the only way to unlock its magic is to have the word revealed to you. &gt;&gt; The only way that work because God brother says when God spoke God actually had to have faith in his own word. And so how do you expect to gain the benefits of that same creative word? Do you think Abraham would have received the promise if he had doubted the word? &gt;&gt; The very fact that he believed the word literally nullified every mistake he would ever make past, present, and future. That he believed the word and that's what God was looking for. Because God knew faith in his word was the key. He believed his own word. Abraham believed his own word. You are a believer of his own word. &gt;&gt; There's no way to force God to give you eternal life. He gives you his word and the opportunity to receive it. &gt;&gt; And that doesn't conflict with predestination and election. As long as you're believing everything he has revealed to you, you'll get the reward of that faith in whatever order that is. The the judgment bar will reveal the order of things. You can see that in the book of Revelation. So you see many many categories of humanity and it was always their their position was election which was origin but the the fact that the thing that made it work for them was they believed the word in whatever form God revealed it. See so they they reaped the reward of that. So now as we are looking to see that this word is connected to creation. So just as God created the world by that same letter and formed Abraham's new identity with the same letter, then when you find Jesus in Luke 11 and he's he's saying a prophecy of the end time, make sure you all look back. Don't just come back here and look at me. Keep going all the way back to where it started and look back at Abraham. Thank you, Lord. What am I seeing? You're seeing the ministry of the son of man. You're seeing the word made flesh and a mortal man with all kinds of faults believed that ministry. &gt;&gt; And when you see that ministry again, you need to believe it. &gt;&gt; You need to accept that. And it'll create in you what it created in him. It'll be it'll operate in you. How it operated in me. &gt;&gt; And that same power that raised me will raise you. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Friends, do you understand what God has done for us in this hour? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; so it's what it's how he's creating children of his kingdom. Both are both are acts of divine speech. &gt;&gt; What he said to Abraham, what he said in Genesis creating let there be when they asked Jesus what's what's with this parable, he said the sewer is the son of man. The seed he's sewing is good seed. The field is the world and the wheat are the children of the kingdom. They're the crop of the seed. &gt;&gt; Did Did Jesus go get a plow and start plowing? No. He sent his word. He sent it. He He came into the upper room and then they begin to take the word and it went down through the ages and God interceded for ignorance. But it come to the last day and now the days of Lot are back among us. And what does it do? It's the same word seowing the same seed and the same kind of people are believing it with the same kind of faith and getting the same kind of results. &gt;&gt; The result is new life just like Abraham became a new man. Just like the disciples were becoming part of a of a they were becoming part of a new a new a new segment of humanity. I can say it like that because if you'll remember that Jesus was uh he was a he was um he was unique. There had never been anyone in the earth like him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Melzdc was God in flesh, but Melzdc God just built a body and stepped in and stepped out of it and disassembled it. &gt;&gt; But that wouldn't redeem me and you. Jesus had to be born of a woman &gt;&gt; because a woman caused the fall. She was party to the fall. She didn't cause it. It was Satan that did it. And it was Adam that broke the world. But Eve was a participant in that. &gt;&gt; And so, so you realize now it's got to come back through the woman. He's got to be born. Only now he's born by a virgin birth so that he's not born in sin. But he is building a body made out of the cursed earth. That's why he ages. That's why he can get sick. That's why he could be killed. &gt;&gt; You can't kill God. You understand? So God acting out the part of death in Christ. Brother Ram said he acted out death in Christ. Now he really died. Jesus really died. He was really dead. But when the Roman even when he died, the life that that was in that original blood cell was still there because that was the continuation of what his body would be. And brother Brandham said when that Roman spear pierced his side, the tip of that spear pierced that original blood cell and released the bride. Hallelujah friends. Now it's all God can be all in all. He's redeeming his whole creation. &gt;&gt; His in Noah's day baptized the earth. His blood claimed the earth. And now his life is going to come in the church. And then he's going to redeem the earth. He's going to redeem you. He's going to redeem our bodies. We're going to a kingdom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. That's why I'm a believer today. That's why you believe what you believe. &gt;&gt; That's why you're That's why you Oh, forward. If those kind of things aren't clear to you, then go to God. Do like Abraham. Go to God. Say, "Reveal this great that this what Abraham wanted. Abraham wanted to know um what what are you doing? Wait, what? You're you're you're going to what if there's 50 people that are righteous? &gt;&gt; What if there's 40, 30, 20, 10? I would say to you today, if you don't understand things in the word of God, just do like your father did. Do like Abraham did. Just step near and just say, "Lord, what's up with my life? What's going on? What is this burning down inside of my heart? What is this deep I feel calling to deep? Oh friends, I hope you feel that today. I say, "Yeah, brother Jason, I responded to that a long time ago. I hope you want more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more of Jesus." I love that song they sing in Africa. More and more and more and more of him. Ah, nothing left of me. Nothing left of me. I want more and more and more and more of Jesus. That beautiful. More and more and more and more of him. Let's stand to our feet, friends. Oh, hallelujah. We love the Lord. I'm not going to try to carry on. I think we've made uh enough enough mileage today in the thought. There's more to say and uh we'll get to it. Um unless the rapture comes and then it'll we'll all we'll all understand it anyway. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.

He's going to answer the why. He said, "Ever all the things you wanted to know. Everything you've ever wondered at will be made known. It'll be revealed." He said, "Here we have a service, we hear preaching, we think it, oh, it's so good. It does are it just feels like we're having a gastronomical jubilee. He says, "But someday he and that word will become what you never dreamed possible." Oh, I'm looking forward to that. Amen. What you going to sing, Brother Kenny? &gt;&gt; Oh, wow.

It's always belong to you. I don't know sometimes, Lord, why we think we have to fight it on our own. Why we don't just come to you and do like Abraham and just step close and start talking. Lord, I pray today in this building and out across the airwaves, there's many children of God who know, Lord, they hear a they hear a high altitude sermon like this and they say, "My, I know I'm a part of that. I just wish I could feel what it feels like to live in those high atmospheres." Lord, it's not rocket science. It's not complicated. You have called us up higher. That was what John saw. A door was open in heaven. Come up higher, John. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Oh master, I pray today that each and every person, man, woman, boy, or girl, under the sound of my voice now, live here, across the stream, across the archives in days to come, Lord, may they take hope today. May the word of God begin a work that starts down inside their heart and begins to drive them closer and closer and closer until Lord, they become so lost in you, as the prophet said, Satan can't even find them anymore. We want that kind of victory. Lord, I want that kind of victory for me, for my family, for this church, for your bride. We know, Lord, that we're near the end. We we can see we understand modern events. They're made clear to us in prophecy. We're not here in fear, Lord God. We're here in faith. We can see the the what. We can see the why. We can see the how. We know what the plan is. So I pray, master, you give us the courage that we need to move forward. I don't think I could leave the people with anything of a better piece of advice just to say whatever's been in the past, forget it. Just step forward. Just step forward. Just move forward. Move close to him and start talking. I promise you he'll respond. Lord, we commit it to you today. Commit all these people into your hands, Lord, for the effect of the word to be upon their lives. And let it, Lord Jesus, be an effective thing on me. Lord, we desire not to just be one that preaches the gospel as Paul said. What a what a dreadful thing having put so many in the way then be set aside myself. May it never be. Lord, draw us closer to thy bleeding side. We commit it to you today in Jesus name. Amen.
