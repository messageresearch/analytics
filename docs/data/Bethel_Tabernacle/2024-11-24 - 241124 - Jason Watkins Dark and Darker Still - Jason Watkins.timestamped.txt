[22:02] Sister Deborah A
[22:04] [Applause]
[22:14] handen S makes more nervous but I want
[22:17] to say a little
[22:19] something um this song is really special
[22:22] to me
[22:23] because
[22:25] it it came to me during a Time of very
[22:29] deep spiritual dryness and I didn't
[22:33] realize when inspiration struck for it
[22:36] that it was
[22:39] actually somewhere deep within me a
[22:42] prayer that
[22:43] was searching to grow and
[22:48] I I didn't fully understand what I was
[22:51] asking when I wrote this song and that a
[22:54] lot of times when you want to grow
[22:55] spiritually it means you're going to go
[22:57] through a lot of hard
[22:59] trials but it this song was kind of the
[23:02] beginning of a chain of events that
[23:04] caused a lot of growth in my life and
[23:07] I'm so thankful that the Lord inspired
[23:09] it because at the time I didn't even
[23:12] really fully know what the words meant I
[23:14] just I thought oh what a nice song and
[23:16] I'll sing it and I know some some people
[23:19] seem to be blessed by it but I didn't
[23:20] fully realize and now looking back on it
[23:23] I'm just so grateful that the Lord not
[23:25] only inspired this song for me but that
[23:28] he
[23:29] created the growth in my in my life that
[23:31] I desperately wanted even though I
[23:33] didn't know that I wanted it so I hope
[23:36] it's a blessing to you and I know you
[23:38] all know it at this point so you can
[23:39] sing it along with me so I won't be as
[23:43] [Music]
[23:52] nervous I love
[23:55] you for what you
[24:00] are
[24:02] doing in
[24:06] me
[24:08] although
[24:10] I am not
[24:13] yet what I
[24:16] need to
[24:21] be for in my
[24:24] mind I often find
[24:29] there's too
[24:31] much of
[24:33] me I pray you take it
[24:36] [Music]
[24:38] away and then you'd
[24:42] stay where I
[24:45] used to
[24:49] be I love
[24:53] you for what you
[24:58] are
[25:01] doing in
[25:03] [Music]
[25:05] me
[25:07] although
[25:09] I am not
[25:14] yet what I
[25:17] need
[25:18] to
[25:22] be for in my
[25:26] mind I often
[25:30] find there's too
[25:33] much of
[25:35] me I pray youd take it
[25:40] away and then you'd

[26:00] far that I've broken
[26:03] my

[26:12] seen the things I've
[26:17] done and what I have
[26:24] become but you're the one
[26:28] who made me out of
[26:32] dust so make me one more
[26:38] time and when you look at
[26:43] me I want to
[26:45] [Music]
[26:48] be what you had in
[26:53] mind

[27:23] need
[27:24] to be

[27:35] find there's too much left of
[27:40] me I pray you take it
[27:45] away and then you'd
[27:49] stay where I
[27:52] used to be

[35:57] they've given him 24 hours to live and
[35:59] so naturally as any son of the Kingdom
[36:03] he you know has a concern for his father
[36:05] amen and so uh we we joined me in prayer
[36:08] today for that request I know that the
[36:11] Lord will move mightily Amen brother
[36:14] Virgil good to see you today praise the
[36:16] Lord amen let's turn in our Bibles to
[36:19] Acts chapter 26 while you're turning to
[36:22] Acts 26 I'd like to say that um so this
[36:26] might shock you but we're going to um
[36:28] stand down from the service in the
[36:30] midweek it's Thanksgiving weekend and
[36:33] I've never done that I've always uh held
[36:35] service on Tuesday but um we have a
[36:39] rather unique Dynamic here at at bethl
[36:42] Tabernacle that most of this church is
[36:45] imported and uh very very very few
[36:49] native bonian and that that's the way it
[36:52] goes um you know it's little Seaside
[36:54] Town you're not really I mean if you're
[36:56] going to come to Buford you got to come
[36:58] to Buford you're not really going
[37:00] through you're not going anywhere
[37:02] through Buford amen you're either coming
[37:04] here or you're not so you got to kind of
[37:06] come off of the beaten Trail come down
[37:08] near the ocean and you'll be right here
[37:10] with us amen and so um so it it kind of
[37:15] works out that way the Lord has brought
[37:17] us in they come from the East and West
[37:20] amen they come from the lands ofar to
[37:22] Feast with the King to dine as his guest

[37:39] a sign seating except for sister
[37:42] Jean do not get her I will get a phone
[37:46] call do not get her Amen brother Luther
[37:49] knows to hold on to her seat her problem
[37:52] is she's she's so short that she can't
[37:54] see good so she has to have that spot
[37:57] amen man and so and I think she just
[37:59] likes to look at me so praise the Lord
[38:02] so we're happy to to have that amen
[38:05] praise God Amen so amen amen praise the
[38:10] Lord so um so normally I haven't done

[39:18] amen God bless you let's read Acts
[39:20] chapter
[39:23] 26 Michael I guess you don't have an
[39:25] update since you reached out to me for
[39:27] your
[39:29] dad okay all right all right uh acts
[39:33] 2612
[39:35] to8 we're we're continuing today and
[39:40] um I had a brother reach out to me who
[39:44] uh brother Mark coffee who transcribes
[39:46] all of my sermons and especially my
[39:48] series it's super helpful to me uh when
[39:51] I'm in a especially a lengthy Series so
[39:53] I can go back so I don't you know cover
[39:56] things we've already covered sometimes
[39:58] you can you'd be surprised you it's hard
[40:00] to remember exactly okay did I cover
[40:02] this did I cover that and I preach all
[40:05] the time and so sometimes I don't
[40:07] remember where I said what when uh so
[40:09] it's very helpful so he wrote to me he
[40:11] said now how do you want to do this he
[40:12] said because I've never I've never as
[40:15] far as I know I've never in all my
[40:18] Ministry had the Lord dropped three
[40:21] sermons on me with three different
[40:23] titles and I actually announced them all
[40:26] in advance I've never done that usually
[40:29] I say I've got a little series two or
[40:30] three parts and it ends up being eight
[40:32] or nine but I've never thought okay I'm
[40:35] going to start three separate thoughts
[40:38] so they are I guess uh they do
[40:41] definitely go together we spoke last
[40:43] time uh a sermon titled into the
[40:46] darkness and to today we want to carry
[40:49] on and I want to take the title dark and
[40:52] darker still
[40:55] amen acts 262 12 to
[41:00] 18 whereupon as I went to
[41:03] Damascus with authority and commission
[41:07] from the chief
[41:09] priest at midday O King I saw in the way
[41:14] a light from heaven above the brightness
[41:17] of the sun shining round about me and
[41:20] them which journeyed with me and when we
[41:24] were all Fallen to the earth I heard a
[41:26] voice speaking unto me and saying in the
[41:30] Hebrew tongue Saul Saul why persecutest
[41:35] thou me it is hard for thee to kick
[41:38] against the Pricks and I said who art
[41:41] thou Lord and he said I am Jesus whom
[41:45] thou persecutest but rise and stand upon
[41:48] thy feet for I have appeared unto thee
[41:51] for this purpose to make thee a minister
[41:55] and a witness both of these things which
[41:57] thou has seen and of those things in the
[42:00] which I will appear unto thee delivering
[42:03] thee from the people and from the
[42:04] Gentiles unto whom now I send thee to
[42:09] open their eyes and to turn them from
[42:12] Darkness to light and from the power of
[42:15] Satan unto God that they may receive
[42:18] forgiveness of sins and inheritance
[42:22] among them which are Sanctified by faith
[42:25] that is in me
[42:28] H my goodness my goodness you have no
[42:32] idea how my heart is
[42:34] exploding let's pray father we thank you
[42:37] for your love to us Lord this morning
[42:41] and I stand rather astonished Lord as I
[42:44] read the text that I planed to read all
[42:47] week and yet when I read it father I
[42:50] just see such a connection to the
[42:52] thought and the direction you've led me
[42:54] so I just relax myself Lord humble
[42:57] myself before you and ask you to be the
[43:00] speaker in our midst today thank you for
[43:03] answering prayer I give it now quickly
[43:05] into your hands in Jesus name amen God
[43:08] bless you friends you can be seated
[43:35] when we were
[43:36] finishing on Wednesday with the sermon
[43:40] into the darkness we were we had tracked
[43:44] the time of the Garden of Eden where
[43:48] they were in a in a state of pure light
[43:51] and pure ecstasy and pure joy in the
[43:55] presence of the Lord daily and and how
[44:00] that we tracked all the way through to
[44:04] the time of the anid deluvian
[44:06] destruction made a number of comments
[44:08] I'm not going to revisit all of that
[44:10] today you can go and catch the Wednesday
[44:12] night archive but we found ourselves
[44:15] from the garden to the day of Enoch to
[44:18] the day of Enoch Noah and we found that
[44:22] Enoch in building his pyramid
[44:27] um you know you you can see that the
[44:30] that the diligence that Enoch had and
[44:33] that he was his perseverance and brother
[44:36] brandham speaks about it often and and
[44:39] he was actually brother brandham talks
[44:41] about how that God has written three
[44:44] Bibles the very first Bible that he ever
[44:48] wrote was in the stars and he put all of
[44:51] the all all of his mystery truths in the
[44:55] heavens and there's still discovering I
[44:57] was just reading yesterday about a a
[45:00] brand new scientific discovery Amen
[45:03] brother Mark almost sent it to you we
[45:05] were brother Mark and I talking about
[45:07] the vast distances you know I if you if
[45:10] you were to travel at the speed of light
[45:13] uh it would only take you a few seconds
[45:15] to get to the moon if you and if you
[45:17] traveled at the speed of light it would
[45:19] only take you a few minutes to get to
[45:21] the Sun but to but to Traverse the
[45:24] entire galaxy would take several couple
[45:27] of thousand years at that same speed so
[45:31] and that's just one Galaxy and they and
[45:34] they they think they understand things
[45:36] until suddenly they see something that
[45:38] they had never seen before because the
[45:40] light of it taking all of these billions
[45:43] of years to reach us finally they see
[45:45] and they saw actually in the heavens a
[45:48] ring of galaxies that they can now see
[45:51] that they had never seen they had seen
[45:53] an arc of galaxies which puzzled them
[45:55] and now they see a ring of galaxies and
[45:58] that the the scientists were saying this
[46:00] is unusual because this is not what we
[46:02] would expect to see from you know if we
[46:06] if our only understanding is that there
[46:08] was a single big bang and now I'm not
[46:11] contesting The Big Bang Theory I like
[46:14] what brother brother Joe used to say
[46:16] there in South Africa uh he would say I
[46:18] I I have no argument against the big
[46:20] bang I just want you to tell me who
[46:22] pulled the
[46:23] trigger so I just thought wow that was a
[46:26] really good good answer and and and so
[46:29] you know brother brandham did lend some
[46:31] to that some Credence to it by saying
[46:33] God spoke and the prophet's words were
[46:36] not big bang he said an Adam bursted God
[46:40] spoke and an Adam bursted an Adam a
[46:42] single Adam bursted and so and so the
[46:46] the Galaxy and so they say you know with
[46:48] that kind of a thinking then you would
[46:50] just naturally not expect to find
[46:53] patterns you'd expect to just find
[46:55] everything dispersed you know like
[46:58] equally out in and and everything should
[47:00] look the same because it's it's it's
[47:02] it's galaxies and planets and stars
[47:04] flying out in every direction and
[47:06] birthing them as it goes so so to find a
[47:10] galaxy of rings not planets not moons
[47:14] galaxies and and and at a and at a
[47:17] greater distance from each other than
[47:20] they than they are to us and they're so
[47:23] far you you would take hundreds and
[47:25] hundreds and hundreds and thousands
[47:26] thousand of of years trying to travel to
[47:29] them at the speed of life so so we
[47:32] realize then that man don't have it all
[47:34] figured out friends and so you know I I
[47:37] when I when I look at Enoch's pyramid
[47:40] here is a man who was a type of the
[47:43] Bride of Jesus Christ and Enoch was
[47:46] figuring out what the world couldn't
[47:48] figure out they had the ability to build
[47:50] they had all kinds of technology to
[47:53] build the Pyramid but that but but
[47:55] theirs was limited to you know that they
[47:58] could build it but how to build it that
[48:01] the pyramid Bible match the Stars Bible
[48:04] because I'm here to tell you something
[48:06] friends when everybody got done building
[48:09] and Enoch built his last element and the
[48:11] world built their last element the world
[48:13] got destroyed Enoch went home so I know
[48:17] that technology is running at a crazy
[48:19] Pace today uh but I'm here to tell you
[48:22] knowledge for the sake of knowledge
[48:24] isn't going to save your life the only
[48:26] way to save your life is to eat of the
[48:28] tree of life and when and when the world
[48:31] has figured out how to destroy itself I
[48:34] you and I will be in glory in another
[48:38] dimension so Enoch you know I I made
[48:41] that statement how that he was he had to
[48:44] in order to have perseverance he would
[48:46] have been building according to the
[48:48] promise that God had made in the fourth
[48:50] chapter of Genesis when he gave a
[48:53] revelation to Abel that he had to bring
[48:56] a blood sacrifice so there was going to
[48:58] have to be a redeemer and God knew that
[49:02] Abel caught that Revelation I I don't
[49:05] suggest that Abel caught everything uh
[49:07] but by the time it got to Enoch there
[49:10] was enough of a catching to give Enoch
[49:13] rapturing faith and I'm here to tell you
[49:15] something friends I know that all the
[49:17] Through the Ages maybe they didn't have
[49:19] it all figured out but at the end time
[49:21] all the Mysteries are made known and
[49:23] this bride is figuring it out how to get
[49:25] home and and I'm glad for that I'm glad
[49:28] I don't have to stay here in this world
[49:29] forever I wouldn't want to have eternal
[49:31] life in this broken down system I want a
[49:34] new world whose Builder and maker is
[49:39] God we found that in our even when they
[49:44] they were at such a simplistic level
[49:46] there coming out of the Garden of Eden
[49:48] it's just when they began the sons of C
[49:51] began to acquire knowledge they began to
[49:53] be artificers and and and instruments
[49:56] and and and they made all kinds of
[49:58] cities and built you know all kinds of
[50:01] uh man-made kingdoms you find nrod doing
[50:05] that on the other side of the flood they
[50:07] just went right back to it now it took a
[50:09] little while but not that long even
[50:11] after Noah came out by you know they
[50:14] were
[50:15] already Hislop records how that they
[50:18] were already moving into false teaching
[50:21] even while the last survivor of the
[50:24] flood which was ham was still alive and
[50:27] was able to be a living witness to
[50:28] testify to him there are there are
[50:31] living Witnesses of what God did in our
[50:34] Day still alive in this world but yet
[50:36] the world is still going off a cliff and
[50:39] God didn't do it in a corner he showed
[50:41] it to the whole world and today there're
[50:43] still Witnesses like Paul said when he
[50:45] spoke about the Ascension of Christ on
[50:47] the Mount of Olives and Paul says there
[50:49] were there are some witnesses who are
[50:51] still alive to this day who were
[50:53] standing there and and Peter that's why
[50:56] why Peter would say we have a more sure
[50:58] word of Prophecy because we have seen
[51:01] these things we have experienced these
[51:03] things and I can't claim that I saw the
[51:06] prophet of this day as a baby I would
[51:08] have no memory of that but I can claim
[51:10] that I've had the same experience I have
[51:13] I can claim that it's doing the same
[51:15] thing for me that it did for him I can
[51:17] claim that the ministry of Elijah that
[51:20] could open up the Jordan when it came to
[51:22] Elisha he could do the same thing
[51:25] because the Jordan represents death and
[51:27] that's the real test of a of a god-
[51:30] calleded Ministry can your ministry
[51:32] reproduce the ministry of Elijah and
[51:35] bring people from the from Death in
[51:38] sickness and sin and the and the
[51:40] diseases of sin and bring them across
[51:43] the Jordan into the promised land of the
[51:45] Holy
[51:47] Ghost that's the credentials of a
[51:49] god-called Ministry when it can
[51:51] accomplish that then it definitely has
[51:54] the same anointing that was on Elijah
[51:57] doesn't make it doesn't make the
[51:59] individual a a a dispensational angel
[52:03] messenger but it doesn't even make a
[52:05] minister that can do that a profit but
[52:07] remember that that that the spirit that
[52:11] that the testimony of Jesus Christ is
[52:15] the spirit of
[52:16] Prophecy see so regardless of whether
[52:20] it's coming through an apostle a prophet
[52:21] a pastor a teacher an Evangel what it
[52:23] doesn't matter what it's coming through
[52:25] whether it's coming through a Labb
[52:26] person whether it's coming from a parent
[52:28] in a home uh uh putting eternal life
[52:31] before their children the testimony of
[52:34] Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy
[52:37] amen
[52:41] amen so we found that they began with
[52:45] such a simplistic way we were showing
[52:47] you last time that even their
[52:50] names uh
[52:52] represented Ultra simplistic meanings
[52:56] and you know that that just we you had
[52:59] one son and his name just meant
[53:02] Carrie you know it meant you know you
[53:04] had another one and his name just meant
[53:06] run yeah and so you know the world was
[53:09] just getting started but but by the time
[53:12] it reaches the days of of Enoch it went
[53:16] from finally one man died a man had
[53:19] actually been killed in the earth and it
[53:21] shook everybody until it got to the time
[53:23] of Enoch when God said man's mind all
[53:27] over the Earth is evil continually it's
[53:31] just vile and there was one man with his
[53:34] family Noah who found Grace in the eyes
[53:37] of the of the
[53:40] Lord so we were we were looking how that
[53:44] last time and here's why I want to begin
[53:46] to move forward because we were we were
[53:49] showing last time how that you know in
[53:52] the Garden of Eden the time of the
[53:54] Garden of Eden they lived freely without
[53:58] the sweat of of a man's brow and how we
[54:02] showed you how that every every day for
[54:07] for you know for hundreds of years you
[54:10] know something less than a thousand
[54:12] living out in that seventh day every day
[54:15] for hundreds of years every day for Adam
[54:18] and Eve ended with a worship service and
[54:22] that worship service would go on into
[54:24] the late evening and and it's just like
[54:26] you and I when we leave a good worship
[54:28] service how we go home and we lay in our
[54:30] bed and our hearts are filled with the
[54:32] joys of the Lord and that's the way Adam
[54:35] and Eve every night God would lay them
[54:37] down in their bed and kiss them good
[54:39] night on their cheek and get some rest
[54:41] now my darlings got a big day tomorrow
[54:43] I'm here to tell you something friends
[54:45] oh we're resting in the Holy Ghost but
[54:48] we got a big day coming
[54:50] tomorrow and brother brandham would talk
[54:53] about how that that that picture got
[54:57] marred and and and God's enemy slipped
[55:00] in under the wall and and enticed Eve to
[55:04] step out from behind her protection
[55:07] which was fortified behind the word of
[55:10] God young people don't you realize that
[55:13] that is exactly if you are privileged to
[55:15] have been raised in a message home do
[55:17] you realize you're being fortified
[55:19] behind the word say oh they're limiting
[55:21] me they're they're keeping me they're
[55:23] hindering me I can't do what I want to
[55:24] do you're being protected
[55:27] you're behind the word you got Godly
[55:29] Parents a Godly Pastor a Godly Church
[55:32] Godly Ministry who are fortifying your
[55:34] life don't run around that don't go away
[55:38] from that because that's what's going to
[55:40] keep you
[55:42] safe Eve stepped out and reasoned with
[55:45] it sounded sensible to her once she
[55:48] reasoned the word of God then sin looked
[55:52] desirable see once you start reasoning
[55:55] away the word of God then that sin
[55:57] nature in you is going to start sounding
[55:59] it sounds illogical suddenly you're
[56:01] going to find yourself being drawn and
[56:04] pulled hard by the sin nature that
[56:07] you're born in so so don't do that don't
[56:09] compromise the word of God believe on
[56:12] him whom God ha sent Believe In Christ
[56:14] the word that has been brought in this
[56:17] hour so we find then that once that
[56:20] happened and then I'm not going to go
[56:22] through the quotes today but brother
[56:24] brandham talks about in such such such
[56:27] beautiful ways and how that God came
[56:30] down you know here he come in the cool
[56:33] of the evening like he had done it's
[56:36] it's Church time and God is not going to
[56:39] be late and brother Ram said Jesus
[56:41] always comes when he's invited and so
[56:44] for for every day for hundreds and
[56:47] hundreds and hundreds of years we don't
[56:48] know exactly something less than than
[56:50] the full thousand years of that seventh
[56:53] day at some point he come down after
[56:56] after so many hundreds of times and and
[57:00] suddenly nobody's at church and
[57:03] something's wrong and Adam and Eve are
[57:06] are hiding and brother brandham just
[57:09] goes through a number of quotes and he
[57:11] he lists several things that he said you
[57:14] see Adam and Eve what they ought to have
[57:17] been doing was they ought to have ran
[57:20] out quickly and repented they ought to
[57:23] ran out quickly instead of running away
[57:25] from him they should have ran to him and
[57:27] fell at his merciful feet say oh God we
[57:31] we've done wrong we're repenting help us
[57:33] forgive us but instead they run away and
[57:35] and the prophet said that's exactly how
[57:38] people do today they they they won't
[57:40] come to church because the church is the
[57:43] house of judgment it's the place where
[57:45] God comes down to show us our pernicious
[57:48] ways where God comes down so that we can
[57:51] look into the mirror of his word and we
[57:52] can see where we need to repent we can
[57:55] see where we need to move up but what
[57:57] happens to people who who go that way
[58:00] suddenly they don't want to go to church
[58:02] anymore they don't want to read their
[58:03] Bible anymore they don't want to repent
[58:06] anymore oh don't make that same mistake
[58:09] friends if you have stumbled run to
[58:12] Jesus if you have fallen get your I'm
[58:15] here to tell you that his Mercy he
[58:18] desires for you to ask for
[58:22] Mercy let me tell you a lie that the
[58:25] devil will tell you you've done this
[58:27] same thing again and again and again and
[58:31] you shouldn't even have the audacity to
[58:33] ask for Mercy I'm here to tell you
[58:35] that's a lie that Christ paid a terrible
[58:38] price so you could ask for mercy and he
[58:41] desires for you to ask again and again
[58:45] and again and again I'm so glad he
[58:47] desired me to ask again and
[58:54] again they don't want want to Fellowship
[58:58] in another place where he would say they
[59:00] lose their desire to Fellowship they
[59:03] things of the world get into their life
[59:06] and suddenly they don't whereas every
[59:09] day that had been a worship service now
[59:11] they're hiding away they don't want to
[59:14] repent they don't want Fellowship they
[59:17] don't want that atmosphere it's starts
[59:20] driving them to other things over the
[59:22] world and the whole world and and
[59:24] brother brandham talks about you know
[59:26] when you try to speak to them they'll
[59:28] say Hey you mind your own business now
[59:30] the reason people do that is because
[59:33] when you when you when you get to the
[59:36] point where you no longer want to sit in
[59:39] the presence of God you no longer want
[59:42] to repent you no longer desire that
[59:44] Fellowship it means that basically
[59:46] you've just started tending to your own
[59:49] business and so you don't want anybody
[59:52] else tending to your business you don't
[59:54] want a preacher you don't want the Holy
[59:57] Ghost you don't want him to come and
[59:58] tend to you you don't want that loved
[1:00:00] one that family member saying a word to
[1:00:02] you you just say mind your own business
[1:00:05] I'll mind my own business I have no
[1:00:07] desire to mind my business I want him to
[1:00:10] be my
[1:00:14] business and when brother brandham tells
[1:00:16] the story and you can you can believe
[1:00:19] what you want to believe but I'm here to
[1:00:21] tell you something friends prophets see
[1:00:23] things sometimes that blow the human
[1:00:25] mind oh yeah read your Bible prophets
[1:00:27] saw things that don't even exist in the
[1:00:30] natural world and they they they saw
[1:00:33] things that that just looked crazy where
[1:00:36] when you know like that preacher said to
[1:00:38] brother bradam Dr Davis said you know or
[1:00:41] wasn't Dr Davis is someone else and said
[1:00:42] you know I John must have ate a hot
[1:00:44] pepper that night before going to bed to
[1:00:47] write a book of Revelation like that and
[1:00:49] brother brandom up braided him and said
[1:00:50] aren't you ashamed of yourself to say
[1:00:53] something like that to imagine that the
[1:00:55] Holy Ghost doesn't know what he's doing
[1:00:57] I'm here to tell you you've got a word
[1:00:59] and the Holy Ghost knows exactly what
[1:01:00] he's doing he knows exactly what you
[1:01:03] need don't think you know what you need
[1:01:05] you don't know what you need only he
[1:01:07] knows what you need that's why the Bible
[1:01:10] says sometimes the Holy Spirit uh utters
[1:01:13] out of us groans that can't even be you
[1:01:15] can't even put it into words he said
[1:01:17] because the Holy Spirit not only knows
[1:01:19] what to pray for for you but he knows
[1:01:21] how to pray for for you and I just say
[1:01:23] Lord God intercede for me don't never
[1:01:26] let me get so arrogant that I don't
[1:01:28] think I need the holy spirit in my
[1:01:31] life and how that and and so prophets
[1:01:35] see things in that way I remember
[1:01:37] brother brandham talking about how that
[1:01:38] he was he was debating with Dr Davis
[1:01:41] over the baptism of Jesus I've told this
[1:01:43] before I tell it again I heard it years
[1:01:45] ago it's it's it's on tape where brother
[1:01:47] Brenham is disc is describing I haven't
[1:01:49] read it in a while but this is the
[1:01:51] essence of it and he said we were
[1:01:53] discussing it and Dr Davis said see
[1:01:56] Billy after Jesus uh after John baptized
[1:02:01] Jesus then Jesus turned around and
[1:02:03] baptized John and brother brandom said I
[1:02:06] don't think so Brother Davis and he said
[1:02:08] Billy you know that's Baptist teaching
[1:02:10] he said but it's not Bible teaching the
[1:02:12] Bible says he went straight way up out
[1:02:14] of the
[1:02:15] water so it doesn't mention that you're
[1:02:17] adding to the scripture and brother
[1:02:19] Brenham said we went over it and over it
[1:02:21] year after year year after year he said
[1:02:23] Till and it was a question in my mind
[1:02:25] could be right but why does the Bible
[1:02:27] say he said then one day he said he
[1:02:29] stood me on the bank there and I watched
[1:02:32] it take place and he said it was exactly
[1:02:34] like the Apostle recorded he went
[1:02:36] straight way up out of the water and
[1:02:38] immediately the Holy Spirit began to
[1:02:41] speak so here you've got a you've got
[1:02:44] you when you read your Bible you can
[1:02:46] read where it says God came walking the
[1:02:49] voice of God came walking in the cool of
[1:02:52] the day now that's not unusual even
[1:02:55] lexical AES will show you that that's
[1:02:57] the theophonic uh pre-incarnate of
[1:03:00] Christ that God who is a spirit no man
[1:03:03] has seen God at any time but but there
[1:03:05] are many examples in the Old Testament
[1:03:08] where he came as a theophany or in a
[1:03:10] theophonic form he came as a soldier
[1:03:12] came as an angel came as a man came as
[1:03:14] this and he he spoke to people and how
[1:03:17] that he came there in the Garden of Eden
[1:03:20] in a form that because he had created
[1:03:23] man see and he made man His Image so God
[1:03:27] was able to come down say well what what
[1:03:30] kind of image was he in well he could
[1:03:32] kiss his children good
[1:03:35] night he could put lips to their cheek
[1:03:38] he could speak from lips and they heard
[1:03:40] it in their ears oh I'm here to tell you
[1:03:42] something friend don't ever limit the
[1:03:44] god of Israel don't ever limit God to be
[1:03:47] able to speak to you exactly how you
[1:03:49] need him to speak he can meet you
[1:03:52] anywhere in the perfect condition and
[1:03:54] brother brandom starts talking about how
[1:03:56] that you know the voice of God walking
[1:03:59] was and brother brandom agrees with that
[1:04:02] with that uh lexical a how that brother
[1:04:04] Brandon when he describes it I'm not
[1:04:06] going to read the quotes to save time
[1:04:07] but I have them how that he was L Elohim
[1:04:11] the self-existing spirit but then he
[1:04:13] takes on a form and he comes down and
[1:04:15] brother brandham said and when brother
[1:04:17] brandham tells the story I don't know
[1:04:19] Hey listen friends maybe we can read at
[1:04:21] one point it's the voice of God walking
[1:04:23] and that has its certain meaning that
[1:04:25] even theologians agree with but when a
[1:04:27] prophet sees it at some point he's no
[1:04:30] longer walking and he's not just
[1:04:32] speaking Prophet said he's running up
[1:04:35] and down the garden and he's to use a
[1:04:38] Kentucky word
[1:04:39] hollering he's hollering I thought to
[1:04:43] myself this wasn't just God coming down
[1:04:46] like some denominational stuffy quiet uh
[1:04:50] seminar type of thing this was God
[1:04:52] demonstrating what a preacher is gonna
[1:04:55] do I'm standing here today doing the
[1:04:57] same thing I'm hollering Adam Adam Where
[1:05:00] Art Thou
[1:05:02] Adam it showed the mark that would be on
[1:05:05] the ministry we're not here to just to
[1:05:07] talk to you or give you some kind of a
[1:05:09] talk I'm all for any kind of a preaching
[1:05:12] and teaching I'm for all styles and I do
[1:05:15] it myself sometimes but it's got to come
[1:05:17] with power and demonstration of the Holy
[1:05:20] Ghost because that's the only thing
[1:05:22] that'll bring Adam back to his senses
[1:05:28] it's what brought Adam out of his hiding
[1:05:30] spot maybe it'll bring you out of your
[1:05:32] hiding spot today
[1:05:36] amen there's so much to accomplish I
[1:05:39] know it's I know it's dramatic I get
[1:05:43] it oh but let me tell you something
[1:05:45] friends if I if I can use drama to fill
[1:05:48] your heart and mind and if I can just
[1:05:52] anoint your imagination Hollywood tries
[1:05:54] to do it all the time why should I not
[1:05:56] be a counter voice they've got all kinds
[1:05:58] of Technology they've got all kinds of
[1:06:00] special effects and explosions and
[1:06:02] lights and dazzling and computer images
[1:06:05] let me tell you if it takes drama to
[1:06:07] anoint your imagination and stir your
[1:06:10] heart to where you'll believe there's a
[1:06:11] new world there's another day and I I've
[1:06:14] got a a ticket waiting on
[1:06:17] me then so be
[1:06:20] it I'll run up and down the garden I'll
[1:06:23] holler and shout and scream
[1:06:26] see so it's what what Hollywood has is
[1:06:30] all just fantasy
[1:06:31] anyway listen friends don't mistake it
[1:06:34] young people don't mistake it it's just
[1:06:37] designed to hypnotize you and keep you
[1:06:38] in spiritual
[1:06:40] Amnesia just long enough to miss out on
[1:06:43] the most epic reality the world has ever
[1:06:49] known so we find then
[1:06:52] that after the flood
[1:06:55] Noah comes out and the Earth is cleaned
[1:06:58] off and he starts again and it's it's
[1:07:02] almost no time before even
[1:07:05] Noah is struggling with weakness of his
[1:07:08] flesh yes amen it was a Son of
[1:07:12] God see genan of God but he he couldn't
[1:07:16] be born again yet because the Holy Ghost
[1:07:18] wasn't yet given because of the Lamb of
[1:07:19] God hadn't you see the reason the Lamb
[1:07:22] of God had to be sacrificed first is
[1:07:24] because the holy ghost the baptism of
[1:07:27] the Holy Ghost puts you back in
[1:07:29] connection to the tree of life and
[1:07:31] there's no way he can let you be
[1:07:33] reconnected to that tree in a fallen
[1:07:35] condition that's why he chased Adam and
[1:07:37] Eve out of the garden lest they put
[1:07:39] forth their hand and partake of the tree
[1:07:40] of life and so he hid the way he he he
[1:07:44] hid it under what Paul called The
[1:07:46] Mystery of redemption oh I'm here to
[1:07:48] tell you friends that it is one of the
[1:07:50] most great unfolding of God's mind
[1:07:53] before the foundation of the world he
[1:07:55] would have a family he would have a
[1:07:57] whole Kingdom and he would spend from
[1:07:59] the days of Genesis from the time he
[1:08:02] gave a abble the Revelation in Genesis 4
[1:08:05] from the time of Genesis 1: 126 when he
[1:08:09] said let us make man in our image let
[1:08:12] him have dominion let him be in our
[1:08:13] likeness and the prophet said he made
[1:08:15] his whole family right there I was in
[1:08:17] his mind you were in his mind and there
[1:08:20] was nothing not enough devils in Hell
[1:08:22] there was not an anti- delu destruction
[1:08:25] there was not Noah's failure there was
[1:08:26] not Abraham's failure there was not
[1:08:28] David's failure there was not Moses
[1:08:30] failure there was nobody's failure going
[1:08:33] to stop God's
[1:08:35] plan Hallelujah in that day on Calvary
[1:08:38] God in the form of a human being was
[1:08:41] lifted up and said I will draw all men
[1:08:44] to
[1:08:44] [Applause]
[1:08:47] me because the darkness has to be dealt
[1:08:50] with
[1:08:56] it had gotten dark in Genesis and coming
[1:08:58] out and it just got darker
[1:09:02] still God starts it over in
[1:09:05] Noah but when they come out they're
[1:09:08] still in
[1:09:10] darkness sin is still not dealt with
[1:09:13] yeah see Satan now brother bam talks
[1:09:18] about Adam had the book of life and when
[1:09:22] he forfeited it Satan tried to get it
[1:09:25] yeah but brother Brenham said but his
[1:09:28] thank
[1:09:30] God his Filthy Hands couldn't hold it so
[1:09:34] it went back to the one who gave it it
[1:09:38] went back to the one seated on the
[1:09:40] throne I'm so glad it's in his hands
[1:09:43] today let me tell you you're in his
[1:09:45] hands you're not in the devil's hands
[1:09:48] you're not subject to him today I have
[1:09:51] been made free by the blood of the Lamb
[1:09:55] today I'm free to love God according
[1:09:58] according to the way he wanted to be
[1:10:01] loved I'm I'm free to worship God
[1:10:03] because there's only one way you can and
[1:10:05] that's in spirit and in truth I'm I I
[1:10:08] have the the freedom to come God's
[1:10:10] provided way because there's only one
[1:10:12] provided way hallelujah it's interesting
[1:10:16] because there was only one provided way
[1:10:19] and you couldn't provide
[1:10:21] it so the only thing that could save you
[1:10:23] you couldn't do I'm so glad somebody
[1:10:26] could I'm so glad there was a worthy one
[1:10:32] Hallelujah so he comes you know all the
[1:10:34] way now he comes to Paul because you
[1:10:39] have to understand he when he he he
[1:10:42] comes to Abraham and yet we know brother
[1:10:45] bam deals with this in the church age
[1:10:47] book of course it's in the scriptures
[1:10:49] you can see it very
[1:10:51] clearly and he says talks about God's
[1:10:53] Messengers
[1:10:55] and he said many of them in fact is the
[1:10:58] majority only a very small minority had
[1:11:02] you know very little against them you
[1:11:05] know even like Joseph brother brandham
[1:11:07] said he perfect in all of his ways but
[1:11:09] he had one little scratch when he tried
[1:11:10] to get his daddy to lie to pharaoh to
[1:11:12] save his skin see so it doesn't matter
[1:11:15] what it was if you've sinned in one
[1:11:18] you've sinned in the whole we all come
[1:11:21] into the world speaking lies we all come
[1:11:23] into the world Sinners yeah see so it
[1:11:25] doesn't matter you can't good your way
[1:11:27] out of that you can't do that you can't
[1:11:30] good workk your way up and out of that
[1:11:32] and so you you you you say well if I
[1:11:35] live the St the the directives of the
[1:11:37] scripture and live that kind of a life
[1:11:39] and I'm kind and I'm giving and I'm I'm
[1:11:41] I'm you know well well does that give me
[1:11:43] any benefit of course it does absolutely
[1:11:45] it does you'll be blessed God will bless
[1:11:47] you He blesses the cheerful Giver he'll
[1:11:50] you give and he'll cause other men to
[1:11:51] give to you press down shaking together
[1:11:54] if you live a decent life people will
[1:11:56] respect you you'll have a name in the
[1:11:57] community there's all kinds of blessings
[1:12:00] you you won't like I said the Christian
[1:12:02] lifestyle if even if there was no Heaven
[1:12:03] is a it's a better lifestyle because
[1:12:05] it's healthier it's safer and and and
[1:12:08] and you don't spend your money and lose
[1:12:10] your health over wild crazy living and
[1:12:12] so it's illogical to not live by God's
[1:12:14] word and all of that is absolutely true
[1:12:17] but as for an eternal
[1:12:21] value you can do all the good works in
[1:12:23] the world it's not going to give you
[1:12:25] eternal
[1:12:27] life there's only one Giver of eternal
[1:12:30] life and that's Christ and Christ is his
[1:12:33] word says the wordl see so when we come
[1:12:36] to the word we're coming to Christ when
[1:12:38] you reject the word you're rejecting
[1:12:40] Christ no matter what you think mentally
[1:12:42] God's not going to judge mentally he's
[1:12:44] judging in the
[1:12:45] heart and people can mentally think say
[1:12:48] and believe they're Christian but if in
[1:12:50] their heart they resist the word of God
[1:12:52] how do you exp how do you plan to
[1:12:54] explain
[1:12:57] that I I saw
[1:13:00] yesterday I showed it to my wife and and
[1:13:04] I showed her a picture of a banana like
[1:13:07] you could buy at at Publix just a banana
[1:13:11] nothing special about it and some artist
[1:13:14] in Italy I think had taken a banana and
[1:13:16] put it on a whiteboard and put a piece
[1:13:18] of gray duct tape over it and it was
[1:13:20] called banana under duct tape or
[1:13:22] something like that
[1:13:25] and he he he says this is Art and the
[1:13:29] art community were like
[1:13:31] oh wow oh my
[1:13:34] goodness you say well that doesn't mean
[1:13:37] anything it didn't until somebody paid
[1:13:39] $6 million for
[1:13:41] it amen I said to my wife said that's
[1:13:45] insane I said it's more than in insane
[1:13:48] it's
[1:13:50] obscene let me tell you something
[1:13:51] friends you're talking to a man who has
[1:13:53] seen too many Starving Children children
[1:13:56] I've been into too many places where
[1:13:58] children don't even have enough food to
[1:14:00] eat and you feel like you want to feed
[1:14:02] everybody and there's millions of them
[1:14:04] you can't even possibly do it and Jesus
[1:14:06] even said the poor you'll always have
[1:14:08] with you I get that God's got a plan for
[1:14:10] that I just say I just give that to the
[1:14:13] one who knows all about it Hallelujah I
[1:14:16] can't fix it I can't feed the world I
[1:14:17] can't fix the whole world but I I do
[1:14:20] know somebody who can
[1:14:23] Hallelujah and I said that somebody
[1:14:26] would spend that kind of
[1:14:28] money over over something that was so
[1:14:32] ludicrous and ridiculous to call it art
[1:14:35] and spend that kind of money when when
[1:14:37] there's millions of children will go to
[1:14:39] sleep tonight and haven't eaten in days
[1:14:43] I said I don't know how they're going
[1:14:45] how are you going to explain that to
[1:14:48] God I see people do some of the dumbest
[1:14:51] things some of some of the craziest
[1:14:53] things and I if I thought if I could
[1:14:55] talk to them I would just say listen

[1:14:59] you're you're building the image of God
[1:15:01] you can put move do whatever you want to
[1:15:04] do but I'm my question is I see you
[1:15:07] doing this and I just want to know on
[1:15:10] that day CU everybody's going to be
[1:15:12] there at that day and everybody's going
[1:15:15] to give an account Paul said we shall
[1:15:17] all stand before that judgment scene
[1:15:18] give an account see and so on that day
[1:15:23] how are you going to EXP explain that to
[1:15:25] the judge yeah what are you going to
[1:15:28] say I mean I I don't want to be you I
[1:15:32] don't want to be one of these tyrants
[1:15:35] you know from from Antiquity or you know
[1:15:38] the even the IND the an deluvian world
[1:15:40] and and after that and all these
[1:15:41] dynasties and these cruel-hearted men
[1:15:44] who ruled and thought they were gods and
[1:15:46] and their and life and death was in
[1:15:48] their tongue and they were just mortal
[1:15:50] they were just
[1:15:52] dust they were born they lived and they
[1:15:55] died and even pharaoh who thought he was
[1:15:58] a god thought he was the son of the
[1:16:00] morning and we we find that that the
[1:16:03] Bible says that when finally Pharaoh
[1:16:06] descended after death it wasn't a pretty
[1:16:09] picture he descended down into a dark
[1:16:12] pit you remember we took the text last
[1:16:15] Wednesday how that the Angels which kept
[1:16:17] not their first estate he threw them
[1:16:19] into a pit of darkness and Gloom the
[1:16:22] Bible says that everybody from behind
[1:16:24] their cell the cells were all along the
[1:16:26] walls of this I don't know use your
[1:16:29] imagination this ginormous Pit and the
[1:16:31] wall is from as high and his load as you
[1:16:34] can see as cells of people and they they
[1:16:37] they come to the bars as Pharaoh is
[1:16:39] descending this is in the scriptures and
[1:16:41] they start they start saying ah Pharaoh
[1:16:45] finally you too have come take your
[1:16:48] place in the wall yourselves waiting on
[1:16:51] you oh I don't want to be that person I
[1:16:54] don't want to have to try to give an
[1:16:56] account of my miserable life I just want
[1:16:57] to say I Jesus led me all the
[1:17:01] way Jesus led me all the way that's all
[1:17:04] I know that's all I want to know that's
[1:17:06] all I care about
[1:17:08] knowing when I fail him I Repent when I
[1:17:12] when I have faith in him I'll go forward
[1:17:14] If I Stumble I'll repent and get back up
[1:17:16] and go forward
[1:17:19] again there's no turning back for me
[1:17:21] there's no quitting no stopping no
[1:17:23] falling away I'll die first before I
[1:17:26] ever leave Christ in his word hallelujah
[1:17:31] hallelujah so we find then that he's
[1:17:35] going to come to that day on
[1:17:38] Calvary and after his death burial
[1:17:42] Resurrection his Ascension and he sent
[1:17:44] his Spirit back into the Earth and now
[1:17:47] he comes to
[1:17:49] Paul because if you'll remember in our
[1:17:51] text this is when he's standing before
[1:17:53] grippa Jewish King and he's giving his
[1:17:58] testimony Paul I hear all kinds of crazy
[1:18:01] things about you you you were a man of
[1:18:03] renown you reputable you are a man of
[1:18:05] learning you're a man of of great of
[1:18:08] great knowledge and and you understood
[1:18:10] great things how is it why do I hear
[1:18:12] that you've lost your mind explain
[1:18:14] yourself
[1:18:16] Paul what can Paul do what can you do
[1:18:21] how would you explain the opportunities
[1:18:23] that you've let DFT on by to follow
[1:18:27] Jesus how you going to make sense of
[1:18:29] that how you going to stand you think I
[1:18:32] could make sense of it I wasn't in this
[1:18:34] town five years and I had one of the
[1:18:36] wealthiest men in Hilton had who liked
[1:18:39] my way of doing things and wanted to
[1:18:41] hire me and I and of course I wasn't
[1:18:43] going to do it I was pastoring he said
[1:18:45] well if you're ever not going to do that
[1:18:46] anymore please come see me and so I just
[1:18:49] said well what could I hope to realize
[1:18:50] he said i' give you my word you'd make
[1:18:53] your first million in your first year
[1:18:55] and I'd put you in in in contact with
[1:18:57] the with all of the families the the
[1:18:59] movers and the Shakers you've got the
[1:19:01] personality you've got the appeal you've
[1:19:03] got the look that they're looking for
[1:19:04] you you could go far and I just thought
[1:19:06] wouldn't Satan love to see me prostitute
[1:19:09] the gift of God and I just said well
[1:19:12] thank you I appreciate your compliments
[1:19:14] and I walked away from there and I said
[1:19:16] Lord God I will let me never compromise
[1:19:18] the word of God I'll take the way with
[1:19:21] the Lord's despise few I started with
[1:19:24] Jesus Jesus guess what I'm going
[1:19:27] through how can I explain that to
[1:19:29] somebody they would say you're nuts
[1:19:31] you're crazy and they'd be right I lost
[1:19:34] my mind and I got the mind of Christ and
[1:19:37] that's the only mind I've ever cared
[1:19:39] about having and that's the why I preach
[1:19:41] I want you to adopt that mind of
[1:19:44] Christ this world is not my home this
[1:19:48] world this life is not about this life
[1:19:50] it's about the next one coming oh I know
[1:19:53] it's dark now but Joy comes in the
[1:20:00] morning all Paul could do was what you
[1:20:03] do what I do all I can do is tell you my
[1:20:09] experience I can't I'm sorry that I
[1:20:12] can't make sense out of why I have
[1:20:16] spurned the
[1:20:17] world why I have passed on opportunity
[1:20:20] after opportunity to stay with God's
[1:20:23] humble people
[1:20:25] you think Moses could explain that when
[1:20:29] Moses here he was and they said look
[1:20:31] Moses you can be you'll be pharaoh and
[1:20:33] then you can change the law and help
[1:20:34] your people Moses didn't want to come a
[1:20:37] man-made way a man-made way sounds so
[1:20:41] logical sensible brother brandom uses
[1:20:43] that exact words the the the whole uh
[1:20:47] the whole seed of the Roman Catholic
[1:20:49] system and the whole thing of uh of
[1:20:53] nianis and B alism and brother brandham
[1:20:56] says and they said you know we we need
[1:20:57] to establish what we believe we need to
[1:20:59] write a Creed and we need to put it all
[1:21:01] in writing we need to put a period on it
[1:21:03] and brother brandham said that sounded
[1:21:07] sensible that's
[1:21:09] logical I I'm glad we got 1,00 tapes
[1:21:12] yeah you understand I'm glad God thought
[1:21:14] to do it that way but brother brandham
[1:21:17] said what sounded logical and sensible
[1:21:19] and reasonable ended up being the seeds
[1:21:22] of the Catholic Church am I'm here to
[1:21:24] tell you something friends do not put
[1:21:26] God in a box do not limit the god of
[1:21:29] Israel do not try to make him fit your
[1:21:31] agenda you just want to raise up both
[1:21:33] hands and say I surrender all All to
[1:21:36] Jesus I Surrender I'm not here to try to
[1:21:38] explain my life I ow I owe this Earth no
[1:21:41] explanation I owe the devil no
[1:21:43] explanation I don't want a treaty I
[1:21:45] don't want an armist I hate that guy I
[1:21:48] Want To Be A Champion for the Holy
[1:21:49] Spirit I want to go forward like Paul
[1:21:52] did and tell them how I got saved
[1:21:57] and he just simply says look King here's
[1:22:01] the deal I went to Damascus with
[1:22:03] authority and letters I was the man I
[1:22:07] had a I had a federal
[1:22:10] mandate well
[1:22:12] Paul okay good start who what what
[1:22:16] hindered you why did you not make it why
[1:22:18] did you change course well the truth is
[1:22:21] your majesty at around noon you know I
[1:22:25] saw in the way a
[1:22:27] light now a lot of people see a
[1:22:31] light Paul said I saw a light from
[1:22:35] Heaven see th this is this is exactly
[1:22:39] what what Adam saw this is what John saw
[1:22:44] this is what they you know John the
[1:22:46] Baptist he saw that that Pillar of Fire
[1:22:48] in the bodily shape of a dove come down
[1:22:51] you know th this is what Moses saw this
[1:22:54] is what Isaiah saw they describe it as
[1:22:57] this great light and Paul says it was a
[1:23:00] light from Heaven brighter than the sun
[1:23:02] shining around about me and the men that
[1:23:04] journeyed with me and we fell to the
[1:23:06] ground and I heard a voice saying to me
[1:23:07] Saul Saul why persecutest thou me oh my
[1:23:12] I think here we are again it's Genesis
[1:23:15] all over it's not Adam Adam it's Saul
[1:23:17] Saul Adam Adam you you you've plunged
[1:23:20] the world into darkness son you've
[1:23:22] broken the Covenant now you're going to
[1:23:24] have to leave the garden now you're
[1:23:25] going to have to go out of my presence
[1:23:27] but I'm glad it went from Adam Adam to
[1:23:29] Saul Saul I'm going to send you to the
[1:23:32] Gentiles because I'm bringing life back
[1:23:34] to my
[1:23:35] family Hallelujah friends God wasn't
[1:23:38] listen God was finished with just trying
[1:23:41] to call Israel as a nation of servants
[1:23:44] I'm here to tell you God was about to do
[1:23:46] something different he was about to go
[1:23:49] Global and why would he go Global
[1:23:51] because this is going to be a global
[1:23:53] bride across two 2,000 years across
[1:23:56] seven continuous and continuous Church
[1:23:59] ages and God is going to redeem a family
[1:24:02] back
[1:24:05] home Saul Saul do you hear his voice
[1:24:09] today do are you willing to come from
[1:24:12] Darkness to light because that's what
[1:24:14] the ministry of Christ is all
[1:24:18] about this was the
[1:24:20] promise
[1:24:23] Saul I'm I'm going to keep my
[1:24:25] promise this hasn't
[1:24:28] been since
[1:24:30] Genesis when a man would have dominion
[1:24:34] once again he would be restored back to
[1:24:37] my exact image and my exact likeness and
[1:24:41] he would have dominion over the fish of
[1:24:42] the sea and over the foul of the air and
[1:24:45] over the cattle and over all the Earth
[1:24:48] and every creeping thing upon the Earth
[1:24:50] even that he says to this mountain be
[1:24:53] thou removed and cast into the sea even
[1:24:55] if he says to a fig tree no man eat from
[1:24:58] thee from this day forward even if he
[1:25:00] should drink a deadly thing even if a
[1:25:02] Viper bites him none of this will stop
[1:25:04] you I have given you power to tread on
[1:25:07] scorpions and snakes and and over all
[1:25:10] the power of the
[1:25:13] enemy and nothing shall by any means
[1:25:16] hurt you oh do you realize it doesn't
[1:25:19] matter what happens to your body nothing
[1:25:22] can by any means hurt you you passed
[1:25:24] from Death to life and light has come
[1:25:27] back in the
[1:25:31] darkness and a light from
[1:25:34] Heaven this is exactly what the ministry
[1:25:36] of Christ was that was the son of man
[1:25:38] Ministry because it was a word made
[1:25:40] flesh it fit God's perfect
[1:25:44] plan Seven
[1:25:46] Ages were purposed now to fill the role
[1:25:51] from the Lamb's Book of Life and to
[1:25:54] finish the bride's call among the
[1:25:57] Gentiles before turning back to gather
[1:26:00] the elected Jew under Moses and Elijah
[1:26:03] it All Began that day on Calvary oh I'm
[1:26:06] here to tell something friend from the
[1:26:07] Creator from the Creator's view I and I
[1:26:11] just and I'm gonna I'm G to hit another
[1:26:14] pause here because I don't want to go
[1:26:16] into the the third installment but I I I
[1:26:20] just let me come come to a close with
[1:26:22] this thought
[1:26:24] he trusted Noah and he failed he trusted
[1:26:27] Moses he trusted Abraham he trusted
[1:26:30] David he trusted them all and they all
[1:26:32] failed him even John the Baptist doubted
[1:26:35] his own Ministry after God after giving
[1:26:38] Christ such a compliment even Joseph had
[1:26:40] a little scratch against his life and he
[1:26:42] is a perfect type of
[1:26:44] Christ and brother brandham said
[1:26:46] concerning the the the the ministers and
[1:26:48] The Messengers and the prophets the
[1:26:50] apostles and everybody that God has ever
[1:26:52] used down Through the Ages don't think
[1:26:54] they were perfect people come on far
[1:26:57] from it brother brand would go on to say
[1:26:59] in fact is the ones who who who have a
[1:27:03] life with failure and and you know that
[1:27:07] that far out stripped I forget the exact
[1:27:09] word on have it in front of me but the
[1:27:11] ones who lived with failure in their
[1:27:14] life many of them with multiple
[1:27:17] failures Abraham got caught lying and
[1:27:20] then got caught lying again and then
[1:27:22] that passed on to his son Isaac and then
[1:27:24] he got caught lying in the same way for
[1:27:25] the same reason Moses was fine but Moses
[1:27:29] never got his temper under control and
[1:27:31] it cost him David was a man after God's
[1:27:34] Own Heart but but oh he he lifted his
[1:27:37] eyes in the wrong direction friends God
[1:27:40] doesn't want you to lift your eyes in
[1:27:42] the wrong direction he said to Abraham
[1:27:44] lift up now Thine Eyes listen the first
[1:27:47] time that was ever said in the Bible was
[1:27:50] when the Bible says lot Abraham said
[1:27:53] choose you'll go and the Bible said lot
[1:27:56] lifted up his eyes and looked toward the
[1:27:59] fertile Plains of Sodom and he thought
[1:28:02] you know I can make a living down there
[1:28:03] I can be successful down there and
[1:28:05] that's the first time that the Bible
[1:28:07] says he lifted up his eyes and when
[1:28:09] light when we know how that story ended
[1:28:13] amen but then he comes back to Abraham
[1:28:15] now that he has separated himself now
[1:28:18] that Abraham has obeyed all the word of
[1:28:21] God then God says lift up now thine eyes
[1:28:24] eyes and look northward and Eastward
[1:28:26] Westward and Southward and everything
[1:28:28] you see northward Southward Eastward
[1:28:31] Westward all of this all of this have I
[1:28:34] given you Hallelujah don't lift up your
[1:28:36] eyes to the world lift up your eyes to
[1:28:39] the
[1:28:40] word lift up your eyes to Christ
[1:28:43] today this is exactly what he was trying
[1:28:47] to get the people to
[1:28:52] do to God
[1:28:55] it just seemed like enough was
[1:28:57] enough and brother brandham said the
[1:29:00] ones that failed him far outpace the
[1:29:03] ones who seen and brother in fact is in
[1:29:06] one place in the same place brother
[1:29:08] brandham said in many respects they
[1:29:11] wouldn't seem inhuman they wouldn't even
[1:29:14] seem to
[1:29:16] qualify but what you can't deny is God
[1:29:20] used them you can read their stories and
[1:29:24] it looks like when I read this I go my
[1:29:26] goodness this man couldn't even qualify
[1:29:30] and yet I read what wait a minute God
[1:29:32] kept you God kept oh my go wow look at
[1:29:36] the
[1:29:37] ending amen oh I'm here to tell you but
[1:29:40] God had had men rise up and fall and
[1:29:43] rise up and fall and God kept going and
[1:29:46] another Prophet would rise up and make a
[1:29:48] mistake and God kept going and another
[1:29:50] Sage would rise up and have an error but
[1:29:53] God kept going
[1:29:54] God was determined to get to a man who
[1:29:56] would not
[1:29:57] fail and that's why God the only way he
[1:30:00] could do it was to Tabernacle himself in
[1:30:03] a human flesh and come down and Jesus
[1:30:05] said I do always that which pleases the
[1:30:09] father God had said enough was enough
[1:30:13] because he's now going to introduce a
[1:30:15] sweeping change in the order of things
[1:30:18] and he says Paul I'm taking you out of
[1:30:20] Darkness I'm going to bring you to the
[1:30:22] Glorious light and you're going to take
[1:30:24] that light to the Gentiles and the light
[1:30:26] that you live that you leave behind is
[1:30:29] going to go to Ephesus and Sam and to
[1:30:31] pergamus and th Ty and it's going to go
[1:30:33] all through seven Church ages it's going
[1:30:35] to go down to nothing and it's going to
[1:30:37] come back up to everything and at the
[1:30:39] end there's going to be a bride who's
[1:30:41] going to stand on the earth and the
[1:30:43] Bible says in the spirit and the bride
[1:30:46] say come because why God had had enough
[1:30:49] of man failing he was going to have a
[1:30:51] bride who would not disbelieve in
[1:30:55] word he's going to have a misses Jesus
[1:31:00] Christ from Darkness to dark and even
[1:31:03] darker
[1:31:04] still but now we find that a glorious
[1:31:07] light is prophesied at the end time and
[1:31:10] you bride you have come from the East
[1:31:15] and from the West you've come to the
[1:31:17] brightness of his Rising arise shine thy
[1:31:21] light has come we're done stand up

[1:32:32] day we've come now Lord to the end of it

[1:33:04] would have to go for a while that the
[1:33:06] church would have to go for a while and
[1:33:08] he said God's not slack don't think that
[1:33:10] he's overdue or forgot his
[1:33:12] church it was always going to the church

[1:33:27] Life and now we've come to this hour

[1:33:41] Darkness oh my soul is thrilled to think
[1:33:44] of it when Sons and Daughters of the

[1:33:50] Earth again and there shall be all the
[1:33:52] glory of God filling the universe oh

[1:34:17] Darkness we have come to the rising of

[1:34:57] that people will
[1:34:59] see what that day on Calvary
[1:35:02] meant that they'll see that they don't
[1:35:04] have to be bound by the sin they were
[1:35:07] born into they can be free to serve God
[1:35:10] according to the real deep desires of
[1:35:13] their heart they don't have to they
[1:35:15] don't have to battle that flesh the the
[1:35:18] prophet taught us the the idea in the
[1:35:20] greatest battle ever fought is not to
[1:35:22] just drag it out but to end it to put it
[1:35:26] down to stop it move it move deeper into
[1:35:30] Christ I pray you help me you know I
[1:35:32] can't go any further Lord I'd be in the
[1:35:35] into the third installment but Lord
[1:35:37] that's where we're headed oh God what
[1:35:40] you have done for us in this hour defies
[1:35:44] all imagination it defies expectation of
[1:35:46] the world no one thought you could pull
[1:35:49] it off so perfectly the devil has fought
[1:35:52] no doubt thinking he will win win not
[1:35:55] only realizing not realizing that it's
[1:35:59] already too
[1:36:01] late he can't win the Bride of this day
[1:36:05] is already birthed by the word she's on
[1:36:07] the scene she's a final voice to the
[1:36:09] final age and she is she is she is
[1:36:14] fortified against being deceived she's
[1:36:18] predestinated not to fall and God who
[1:36:22] created all things we'll see to
[1:36:25] it I thank you for these things Lord we
[1:36:27] praise you we glorify you I pray young
[1:36:30] people will take a fresh look at that
[1:36:32] day on Calvary what it meant what God
[1:36:34] did after after suffering 4,000 years
[1:36:39] the world rejecting him full of
[1:36:42] heathenism his own Nation Israel on
