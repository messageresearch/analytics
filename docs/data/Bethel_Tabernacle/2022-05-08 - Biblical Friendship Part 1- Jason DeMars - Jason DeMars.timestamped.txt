[0:08] [Music]
[0:35] so
[0:39] [Music]
[1:37] [Music]
[2:01] [Music]
[2:19] heavenly father we just come before you
[2:21] now lord and we ask that your holy
[2:22] spirit would be with us
[2:24] lord that you would take your word and
[2:26] speak it into our hearts lord we want to
[2:28] just pray and lift up those who are
[2:32] not feeling well today lord may your
[2:34] hand be upon them touch them and make
[2:36] them completely well lord
[2:38] we thank you for this time we have
[2:40] together in your word lord i pray that
[2:43] you would come and make it alive in our
[2:45] hearts in jesus name amen
[2:48] all right i want to speak this is a
[2:50] subject i
[2:52] spoke about
[2:53] probably
[2:55] uh close to two years ago
[2:58] and um
[3:00] it's just been on my heart for the last
[3:02] month or two to go into it again
[3:05] to speak about biblical friendship
[3:08] and so it it's the same notes but
[3:11] uh like brothers know when whenever you
[3:14] preach different places the note it'll
[3:15] come out differently so just
[3:19] i didn't have i also want to say i
[3:21] didn't have anybody here in mind
[3:24] when speaking about big biblical
[3:25] friendship and i'm not asking you to do
[3:28] anything differently with me i'm i'm
[3:31] looking at myself when i look at these
[3:33] notes all right so
[3:35] first scripture is john 15 verse 15.
[3:40] henceforth i call you not servants for
[3:43] the servant knoweth not what his lord
[3:45] doeth but i have called you friends for
[3:47] all things that i have heard of my
[3:49] father
[3:50] i have made known unto you amen may the
[3:53] lord add the blessing to the reading
[3:55] of his word
[3:57] so
[3:59] this
[4:01] these notes were really born out of
[4:04] looking at the subject of love
[4:06] and we'll look at the definition more
[4:09] closely but when you
[4:10] when we we as christians and especially
[4:13] as message believers think about
[4:15] love we start to think about the
[4:16] different words that brother branham
[4:18] used and explaining the greek
[4:20] agape and filio
[4:23] and these different things and there's
[4:26] a number of different ways to express
[4:29] uh the idea of love in the greek
[4:31] language in english it's simple it's
[4:33] love but it means tons of different
[4:36] things it could be about food it could
[4:37] be about your friend it could be about
[4:39] your brothers and sisters in christ it
[4:41] could be about the your your spouse your
[4:43] children
[4:44] all these are different types of love in
[4:47] greek they have different words for it
[4:49] in english i guess we're too simple
[4:50] minded so we just say love
[4:54] but we don't always mean love when we
[4:55] say love
[4:57] so in in greek you see the word
[4:59] love it could be multiple different um
[5:04] different words that are used there
[5:05] so the term friend that we have
[5:09] the source of that word is filio
[5:12] so it's just that it's just a different
[5:14] uh tense of the word filio
[5:17] different usage of the word filio so
[5:20] you know
[5:21] when we look at filio filio we think of
[5:24] as a lower thing it's lower than agape
[5:27] and that's true
[5:29] agape is an unselfish
[5:32] love
[5:33] a love that is not looking to receive at
[5:36] all but a love that's looking to give no
[5:38] matter what filio is a love where
[5:40] there's a mutual
[5:43] enjoyment there's a mutual
[5:46] blessing that comes
[5:47] but as christians we can't
[5:50] stay on the level of filio
[5:53] even though that's friendship but the
[5:55] reality is we've got we've got to kind
[5:57] of come up
[5:58] higher and let our filio
[6:01] be covered by our agape
[6:04] love
[6:05] so our friendships
[6:08] are only going to thrive and work as as
[6:10] believers
[6:12] when we're walking in agape
[6:15] divine love we call it unselfish love
[6:18] and so when we look at
[6:21] this
[6:23] this is not about
[6:25] okay uh this is what i'm demanding that
[6:27] other people
[6:29] give to me as christians that's not our
[6:32] attitude
[6:33] well the bible talks about friendship
[6:34] and we're always pointing at what other
[6:36] people ought to be doing
[6:39] on my behalf
[6:41] which is so dangerous and it leads to so
[6:43] many different disappointments
[6:46] the christian ethic is not self-centered
[6:50] it's let every man seek not his own good
[6:54] but the good of others
[6:56] so we
[6:57] we take that and we make that a
[6:59] religious statement and we separate that
[7:02] from well i have my friends and i can do
[7:04] whatever i want to in my friendships no
[7:07] no you can't
[7:08] as a christian
[7:10] our friendships need to be completely
[7:13] biblical
[7:15] when i say biblical friendship that's
[7:17] what i mean
[7:18] our fr our friendships need to be based
[7:20] on the bible
[7:21] we don't have our friendships over here
[7:23] and the bible over here young people if
[7:25] you're listening in we don't have our
[7:27] friendships on one side and the bible
[7:29] over here the bible covers everything we
[7:32] want to live in every way according to
[7:34] the bible including who we choose as our
[7:37] friends including how we behave and
[7:40] interact with friends
[7:44] so
[7:45] friendship
[7:46] it's it's a relationship
[7:49] and just like any relationship
[7:51] it tends towards isolation
[7:55] hurts frustrations it's just a natural
[7:58] occurrence
[7:59] you you first meet people and the
[8:01] friendship is is wonderful and
[8:03] everything's great but then time goes
[8:05] along and guess what we disappoint each
[8:07] other
[8:08] what what can you count on i want to
[8:10] guarantee you something i will
[8:12] disappoint y'all
[8:14] i'm going to do something that
[8:15] frustrates you that makes you upset
[8:18] that's where
[8:20] this
[8:22] going from being on a page
[8:24] to here to hear it needs to happen
[8:27] is because
[8:28] as time goes along things build up
[8:31] issues build up and we have to be able
[8:33] to one
[8:34] lovingly kindly
[8:36] not emotionally
[8:38] speak to one another if we have a if we
[8:40] if we have something where we feel like
[8:42] man there's something between us don't
[8:44] let that fester don't let that sit there
[8:46] that's not loving
[8:48] we think sometimes that's loving we just
[8:51] love covers a multitude of sins
[8:53] that's true
[8:54] that's true but if you have something in
[8:56] your heart against someone what happens
[8:58] you build a complex
[9:01] you can't get around you're not so
[9:03] you're not so angelic that you're going
[9:04] to get around that you still have a
[9:06] flesh that eats at you that that that
[9:10] that wars against what you really want
[9:13] in your soul
[9:14] and so we we have to be in that place
[9:16] where we just talk about it don't be so
[9:19] don't be so um
[9:24] stuck in your own feelings
[9:26] that you can't talk about it then again
[9:29] don't just
[9:30] don't get so easily hurt by everything
[9:33] that you're you're constantly
[9:35] shoveling stuff on people's
[9:37] laps
[9:38] there's a balance
[9:40] in your character and your behavior yes
[9:41] you have to talk about things but don't
[9:43] be offended by everything
[9:45] we become we become easily offended by
[9:48] everything we constantly
[9:51] bring that to people and it brings a
[9:53] separation
[9:55] and it shouldn't do that but as natural
[9:58] human beings
[9:59] it does that
[10:03] jesus says in that scripture we read
[10:06] to open
[10:07] i don't call you servants now i call you
[10:10] friends
[10:12] because the things that i've heard of my
[10:13] father have made known unto you
[10:15] in other words we have
[10:17] we have an intimacy
[10:19] in our relationship that we sh i've
[10:21] shared
[10:22] my heart with you
[10:24] that's friendship we can share each
[10:27] other's hearts
[10:28] with each other we can we can open up
[10:30] our heart to one another
[10:33] i believe that's the definition
[10:35] jesus is giving us the definition
[10:38] of real christian friendship
[10:42] but
[10:43] this is not something we demand
[10:46] we demand it from everyone no
[10:49] this is something we give
[10:51] right
[10:52] but it's also something we build
[10:55] jesus didn't say this in john
[10:57] chapter
[10:58] 5. he said it in john chapter 15
[11:02] in other words time they grew they
[11:05] listened to him they were with him he he
[11:07] he opened his heart to them
[11:11] so that they could know the things that
[11:13] the father had spoken to him so
[11:15] what's my what's my point in saying that
[11:17] it's
[11:18] trust is built
[11:20] over time
[11:22] trust can also be destroyed over time
[11:34] that this type this type of friendship
[11:37] demands
[11:38] loyalty
[11:40] and it also demands
[11:42] trustworthiness
[11:44] if you have a spirit of gossip on you
[11:47] don't think that this kind of friendship
[11:49] is going to happen
[11:51] if you're telling everybody's secrets
[11:54] to other people you're not going to have
[11:57] transparent close friendships because
[12:00] people will immediately with wisdom say
[12:03] boy i can't open up myself to them
[12:05] because as soon as i say this to them
[12:08] 99 people are gonna know about it so i
[12:10] should be i should be i should guard
[12:12] myself that's natural
[12:15] that's natural now
[12:17] i'm not teaching you to be natural i'm
[12:19] teaching you on the side if if you're
[12:21] struggling
[12:22] and people aren't opening up to you
[12:24] maybe examine yourself
[12:26] all right
[12:27] but secondarily looking at it
[12:30] looking at it this way as believers we
[12:32] don't shut ourselves off
[12:34] because someone has offended us
[12:36] did jesus shut himself off
[12:39] no he went to the cross he was betrayed
[12:42] by everyone and his love didn't change
[12:45] neither should our
[12:47] love change towards one another
[12:51] jesus made himself transparent to us and
[12:53] for us
[12:55] and i guess it got him killed didn't it
[12:59] and
[13:00] we are to be we're to walk in the same
[13:02] footsteps
[13:04] for one another not for ourselves
[13:06] if we look at
[13:08] friendship as it's about me
[13:13] that's that's not what
[13:15] god intends for us that's what the world
[13:17] does
[13:19] friendship is all about me and how this
[13:21] person benefits me
[13:23] and many many christians
[13:25] behave this way i don't believe
[13:27] we should
[13:28] as as members of the bride of christ
[13:32] our friendships should not be about
[13:33] ourselves but our friendship should be
[13:35] about serving and loving other people
[13:38] um
[13:41] i believe that's that's what the lord
[13:42] wants for us
[13:44] selfless
[13:46] friendship that lay we lay down our
[13:48] lives
[13:49] for our friends
[13:52] so i mean of course we look at scripture
[13:54] and we see jesus had the 12 but then he
[13:56] had
[13:58] his most trusted friends peter james and
[14:00] john that he brought close to him so
[14:02] there's different there are different
[14:04] layers and levels of friendship
[14:06] and that's okay and we need to be okay
[14:08] with that
[14:10] um
[14:11] god has a purpose in all that and
[14:14] and and you there's many friends but
[14:16] there's sometimes just a few people that
[14:18] you can really share your heart with
[14:20] and that's what that's
[14:22] that's okay
[14:23] that's normal
[14:25] and if we don't think that's normal we
[14:27] get this idea and we start the
[14:29] jealousies form and this forms in that
[14:31] form
[14:32] it's all right just relax
[14:34] god loves you just the same
[14:37] and we should love each other just the
[14:38] same
[14:40] but understand there's sometimes special
[14:42] connections
[14:43] and that we have to be okay with that we
[14:45] have to be mature enough
[14:47] to be okay with that
[14:49] neither but at the same time to balance
[14:52] that out neither should we be
[14:54] cliquey we just have our clique of
[14:56] people and
[14:57] everybody we just shove them away don't
[14:59] don't don't you're not welcome we just
[15:00] have these friends these are the people
[15:02] that we're comfortable with don't come
[15:03] near us
[15:05] no
[15:06] we need to be careful about that as well
[15:12] sometimes people are
[15:15] broken
[15:17] sometimes people
[15:18] are have been hurt
[15:20] they've had things from their past
[15:22] that have all but
[15:25] destroyed them and ruined them
[15:28] that's what the body of christ is for
[15:30] that's
[15:31] what the preaching of this word is for
[15:33] is to bring really
[15:35] genuinely to bring healing
[15:37] to people's hearts
[15:40] to bring people to restoration to bring
[15:42] people to transformation the love that
[15:44] we have for each other should be
[15:46] transformative
[15:49] it shouldn't be just on this level well
[15:51] everybody just we have our friends we
[15:53] have our group we have our social group
[15:55] and we connect with each other and then
[15:57] please the rest of you stay away that's
[15:59] not transformative that's hurt that's
[16:01] hurtful that's painful what god wants is
[16:04] our love for one another to change each
[16:07] other's hearts because we're jesus to
[16:09] the other people
[16:10] he's pouring himself out through us
[16:13] to them and so we got to get beyond
[16:17] what this guy wants
[16:19] what's comfortable for this person right
[16:22] here and looking to others
[16:25] outside of myself
[16:29] in the next slide there
[16:32] from the
[16:34] uh baker dictionary of the bible says
[16:39] most of old testament about defining the
[16:42] word friend and friendship most of the
[16:43] old testament words translated friend
[16:45] friendship or be friendly come from two
[16:47] hebrew roots
[16:49] the most common terms for friend
[16:52] you can see that there i'm not going to
[16:53] try to read these hebrew words
[16:55] a partial meaning of one who loves in
[16:57] the new testament several words appear
[16:59] in including filo's friend
[17:03] hetairos companion comrade and placeon
[17:06] neighbor
[17:07] along with a variety of kinship turns
[17:09] such as brother
[17:11] mother or child extended to revert to
[17:13] people outside one's family for whom one
[17:16] feels special affection
[17:18] the term mo used most is filo's friend
[17:22] and adelphos
[17:23] brother sister the last of which becomes
[17:25] a technical term
[17:28] for a fellow believer i like that
[17:31] a technical term for a fellow believer
[17:33] the word for friend
[17:36] i think that's outstanding
[17:38] that's what the lord wants us to be
[17:40] to one another
[17:42] first samuel 19
[17:44] 1. an incredible example of selfless
[17:48] friendship
[17:50] and saul spoke to jonathan his son
[17:53] and all his servants
[17:55] that they should kill david
[17:57] but jonathan saul's son delighted much
[18:00] in david
[18:01] and jonathan told david saying saul my
[18:03] father seeks to kill me now therefore
[18:06] to kill thee now therefore i pray thee
[18:08] take heed to thyself until the morning
[18:11] and abide in secret places and hide
[18:13] thyself
[18:15] and jonathan spake good of david unto
[18:17] saul his father and said unto him let
[18:19] not the king sin against his servant
[18:21] against david because he hath not sinned
[18:24] against thee and because his works have
[18:26] been to the word very good
[18:28] this is loyalty
[18:31] and i think
[18:33] this is important we have to have each
[18:35] other's back
[18:37] it's brother jason speaks over and over
[18:39] again it's all for one and one for all
[18:44] we have to be loyal like this kind of
[18:46] loyalty
[18:48] like your dad comes to you and says i'm
[18:50] gonna kill your buddy no i don't i think
[18:53] you're mistaken
[18:55] i think you're mistaken i think your
[18:56] your judgment of my friend
[18:58] is not right and go to your friend and
[19:00] say be careful
[19:02] be careful
[19:03] that's that's real friendship it's
[19:05] loyalty in the face of great loss
[19:08] this is great loss for jonathan why is
[19:10] it great loss for jonathan because he's
[19:12] supposed to be king next
[19:14] if he gets behind his father
[19:17] and
[19:18] deceives david and kills him guess what
[19:20] happens
[19:22] jonathan inherits the crown
[19:25] ins instead he gets behind god
[19:28] and is loyal
[19:30] to his friend
[19:32] to his own personal detriment
[19:35] that's friendship
[19:39] proverbs 17 17 a friend loveth at all
[19:42] times
[19:43] and a brother is born
[19:46] for
[19:46] adversity
[19:48] a friend stands with you in good times
[19:50] bad times
[19:52] but your brother stands with you
[19:54] when there is adversity in other words
[19:57] your friend is always there for you
[20:00] your brother when things are terrible
[20:02] fine then he'll come he's not going to
[20:04] be there with you all the time
[20:06] your blood brother
[20:08] he's not gonna be there with you all the
[20:09] time but when it gets really tough
[20:10] you'll be there but the friend is there
[20:12] all the time and i believe this is
[20:14] speaking of friend as in a christian
[20:16] believer
[20:17] he's there for you when times are good
[20:19] when times are in between and times are
[20:21] bad
[20:22] that's what we need to be there for each
[20:23] other we don't abandon one another when
[20:25] the times get hard
[20:30] job 19 14.
[20:33] job looking at this and realizes
[20:36] that his people that he considers who
[20:38] are his friends really aren't his
[20:39] friends
[20:41] my kins folk have failed and my familiar
[20:43] friends
[20:44] have forgotten me
[20:46] and i think um this isn't to discourage
[20:49] you to bring the scripture and say
[20:51] everybody's forgotten me sometimes we
[20:52] feel that way
[20:54] and thank god we're christians because
[20:56] then we can know actually we're not
[20:58] alone
[20:59] we have a friend
[21:00] who's with us the lord jesus he never he
[21:03] said i'll never leave you
[21:05] and never forsake you
[21:07] and so take comfort if you feel alone
[21:09] you feel like everybody's forgotten you
[21:11] that's okay
[21:13] don't blame him
[21:15] maybe god has a purpose in that
[21:17] maybe he's trying to grow something you
[21:18] i've felt this way i felt this way
[21:21] my family's failed me my familiar
[21:23] friends everybody's forgotten me here i
[21:25] am alone
[21:28] that's right
[21:30] the lord is always
[21:32] with us and the times that i felt the
[21:34] most alone
[21:36] is when the lord has been the closest
[21:39] and don't forget that he's trying to
[21:41] when you when you have times where you
[21:43] feel lonely
[21:44] remember the lord is trying to say
[21:47] don't trust in people
[21:49] trust in me
[21:51] i'm with you i'm here for you
[21:54] find your satisfaction in me
[21:58] brother branham says there's another
[22:00] thing and that i would like to say that
[22:01] is another thing
[22:02] running out is friendship is running out
[22:05] don't seem like that we have friends
[22:07] that we used to have and the friends
[22:09] that we have are not loyal friends like
[22:11] it used to be used to be i can remember
[22:13] when someone got sick in the
[22:14] neighborhood that everybody come around
[22:15] and they helped them with all their work
[22:18] and lended a hand to anything could be
[22:19] done set up with them all night at a
[22:21] time as often said it's truth that we
[22:23] hardly know the neighbor is dead until
[22:25] we see it in the paper friendship

[22:31] just want to say

[22:34] church in the time in our lowest time
[22:37] me and my family you all were there for
[22:39] us i'm so thankful

[22:43] bride of christ

[23:42] james 1 19
[23:46] know this my beloved brothers let every
[23:48] person be quick to hear
[23:50] slow to speak
[23:52] slow to anger this is a great
[23:54] and important lesson in friendship
[23:59] is
[24:00] are we the one that's
[24:02] chattering away all the time there's
[24:04] times where we need to
[24:06] and your friend is there to listen to
[24:07] you
[24:08] but
[24:09] is that what it always is
[24:11] are you always the one that's constantly
[24:13] talking and telling everything
[24:15] about that's going on in your life but
[24:17] you're not listening
[24:19] real friendship is asking questions and
[24:22] listening and caring enough
[24:24] to actually listen
[24:26] and actually hear and receive what
[24:29] they're saying take it in
[24:31] and and converse about that uh it's not
[24:33] just waiting for your chance to speak
[24:36] okay i'm listening because i really have
[24:38] something i want to tell but i'm going
[24:39] to listen just just long enough
[24:42] so that i can say what i want to say
[24:43] no it's really caring enough to ask
[24:46] questions
[24:47] listen
[24:48] and hear what the people are saying
[24:50] i think the statement is you're given
[24:52] one mouth and two ears so use them
[24:54] accordingly
[25:00] you know listen
[25:02] this goes to every relationship
[25:04] listen for understanding not don't
[25:07] listen
[25:08] just to respond
[25:10] sometimes a person they don't even need
[25:12] you to
[25:13] say anything they just need you to
[25:15] understand to show that you understand
[25:17] and that in itself can bring healing to
[25:19] a person
[25:22] proverbs 27
[25:24] 9 oil
[25:26] and perfume uh yeah oil and perfume make
[25:29] the heart glad
[25:31] and the sweetness or the pleasantness of
[25:33] a friend comes from his earnest
[25:36] counsel or advice
[25:38] i think that's tremendous
[25:41] the pleasantness of a friend comes from
[25:44] his
[25:45] earnest counsel
[25:47] that that's what we need one another for
[25:48] sometimes we don't see things right
[25:50] sometimes we don't see the whole
[25:52] can i say this most problems in our
[25:55] interpersonal relationships in church
[25:58] are because we just don't have all the
[26:00] information
[26:03] 99.999 i can say that as a from a
[26:06] position of ministry
[26:08] i've seen a lot all over the world
[26:12] and
[26:13] it's almost always a lack of information
[26:17] and a lack of even desire to to
[26:20] get that information or know when you
[26:22] don't need to know anything
[26:24] and you don't need to react and you
[26:26] don't need to do anything
[26:29] it's a lack of wisdom and so this is
[26:30] where the sweetness of a friend
[26:33] comes in which can
[26:34] say that you're not looking at this
[26:36] right you're not seeing this
[26:38] correctly and love them enough to
[26:41] listen to what they say respect respect
[26:44] what they say
[26:45] but then help them see the bigger
[26:46] picture
[26:50] faithful proverbs 27 6
[26:54] faithful are the wounds of a friend but
[26:56] the kisses of an enemy
[26:58] are
[26:59] deceitful so a friend is someone you can
[27:01] to can turn to for advice
[27:04] they care for you they help you with the
[27:06] encouragement and they also help you
[27:09] with a loving
[27:10] rebuke or correction
[27:13] a true friend will speak to you when
[27:15] you're when you're wrong
[27:17] they'll speak to you about it a true
[27:18] friend will not just flatter you
[27:23] with empty words
[27:24] a true friend will say
[27:26] you're misunderstanding you're that's
[27:28] not that's not right
[27:30] how can you look at that situation that
[27:32] way
[27:33] that's real friendship just be honest
[27:35] with one another be straight be real
[27:39] with one another
[27:44] time is winding down
[27:46] philemon 1 10-12
[27:50] i
[27:51] i appeal to you from my child anessimus
[27:53] whose father i became
[27:55] in my imprisonment formerly he was
[27:58] useless to you
[27:59] but now
[28:00] he is indeed useful to you and to me
[28:03] i am sending him back to you
[28:05] sending my very heart
[28:08] i love that
[28:10] paul calls
[28:14] onesimus i'm sending you
[28:18] my very heart this man who
[28:22] did wrong
[28:23] i mean he ended up in prison
[28:28] who did wrong who who ran away he said
[28:31] i'm sending you my very heart
[28:34] isn't that an amazing statement someone
[28:36] who
[28:37] most people would just write them off as
[28:39] worthless and useless
[28:41] the apostle paul says
[28:43] i'm sending you back not
[28:45] a servant
[28:47] i'm sending you back my very heart and i
[28:49] think that's that's the kind of love we
[28:51] should have
[28:53] for one another not just empty words but
[28:55] really
[28:57] a real
[28:58] christian feeling in our hearts towards
[29:00] one another
[29:03] i think i'm gonna
[29:05] end
[29:07] there i never am able to finish in one
[29:10] session so let's stand and pray
[29:14] gracious heavenly father we just come
[29:16] before you now lord and we ask that your
[29:18] holy spirit would just take these words

[29:28] this earth and the things that go along
[29:30] with it they
[29:32] they drag us down they tear us down lord
[29:34] but we want more of you
[29:37] we ask that your holy spirit would just
[29:40] be sovereign over the service this
