[0:00] [Music]
[0:46] Good morning.
[0:48] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand and have a word of
[0:50] prayer.
[0:53] Dear gracious father, Lord, we want to
[0:55] come before you this morning,
[0:57] Lord. invite you into our Sunday school,
[1:00] Lord, that we could learn something,
[1:02] Father, that your word says to
[1:05] the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:07] wisdom. So, Father, we want to begin
[1:09] with our pursuit for knowledge and
[1:11] understanding of your word by
[1:13] recognizing your authority.
[1:15] Father, we want to ask that you would
[1:16] come down, reveal yourself to us, open
[1:20] the word to us, Father, but above all,
[1:22] that you would anoint our hearts that we
[1:24] could hear it and receive it. that
[1:26] Father, it wouldn't just be Lord a a a
[1:30] sounding brass or a tinkling symbol, but
[1:31] Lord that it would move and it would act
[1:34] that the hearing of the word would would
[1:35] quicken life within us. We ask these
[1:40] things, ask this blessing upon the word
[1:42] as we before we would read it in the
[1:45] holy and precious name of the Lord Jesus
[1:46] Christ. Amen.
[1:49] We want to turn
[1:51] um this morning to Genesis chapter 2.
[1:56] Um, and we'll go to verse 21.
[2:00] Um,
[2:07] Genesis chapter 2 and
[2:10] verse 21. And the Lord God caused a deep
[2:13] sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept.
[2:16] And he took one of his ribs and closed
[2:18] up the flesh instead thereof. And the
[2:21] rib which the Lord God had taken from
[2:23] man made he a woman and brought her unto
[2:27] the man. And Adam said, "This is now
[2:29] bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh.
[2:31] She shall be called woman because she
[2:33] was taken out of man. Therefore shall a
[2:36] man leave his father and his mother and
[2:38] shall cleave unto his wife, and they
[2:39] shall be one flesh." And they they were
[2:42] both naked, and the man and his wife,
[2:44] and were not ashamed.
[2:46] Y'all can be seated. Um, I want to also
[2:49] turn, well, I'll just read it here. We
[2:52] don't just for the sake of time. Um,
[2:54] I'll just read it from my notes. This is
[2:56] Romans 13 and verse 8 through 10. Says,
[3:00] "Owe no man anything but to love one
[3:02] another. For he that loveth another hath
[3:05] fulfilled the law. For this, thou shalt
[3:08] not commit adultery. Thou shalt not
[3:09] kill. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt
[3:11] not bear false witness. Thou shalt not
[3:13] covet. And if there be any other
[3:15] commandment, it is briefly comprehended
[3:17] in this saying, namely, thou shalt love
[3:20] thy neighbor as thyself. Love workketh
[3:23] no ill to his neighbor. Therefore, love
[3:25] is the fulfilling of the law.
[3:29] Um,
[3:31] now I want to
[3:34] uh I want to continue on with my thought
[3:36] that I've been um speaking on um the
[3:39] title, why are we here?
[3:41] um speaking on primarily on on the
[3:44] family and and and how the family is to
[3:46] be structured and the purpose of it. Um
[3:48] and so I want to last week we had we had
[3:51] um I talked mentioned I'd ended with the
[3:54] point that
[3:56] in Genesis chapter 2 um that the in
[3:59] Genesis the pattern of the family right
[4:01] the type that the modern family is
[4:04] supposed to follow is the type is the
[4:07] pattern after the uh family in the
[4:10] garden of Eden that the the Lord had a
[4:14] ideal for a family and that it is our
[4:17] goal as message people to return back to
[4:20] that that we would organize our families
[4:22] and structure it in that way and that in
[4:24] fact is God's great purpose that in fact
[4:26] the purpose of the the Bible and the
[4:27] scripture and everything the whole
[4:29] everything was that God could have a
[4:32] family that God could be a father he
[4:33] could be a husband and that he could
[4:35] have children in you know in his perfect
[4:38] ideal for a home which was the Eden
[4:41] condition.
[4:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:43] Um, and so it is our job, it is our goal
[4:46] to pattern everything that we are, all
[4:48] of our family and the way we we do
[4:49] things after that ideal, after that
[4:53] perfect image. And so
[4:57] um and I I read this this uh here in in
[5:02] Genesis chapter 2
[5:05] um that that last verse verse 24.
[5:07] Therefore shall a man leave his father
[5:09] and his mother and shall cleave unto his
[5:10] wife and they shall be one flesh. Now I
[5:13] want to note again just to reiterate
[5:16] that here it is the the you have the
[5:18] narrator of the Bible telling a story
[5:21] right? He's telling the story of how,
[5:22] you know, God made Eve out of Adam. And
[5:26] then he gets to verse 24 and then the
[5:28] narrator stops and breaks the fourth
[5:30] wall and talks directly to the reader
[5:32] and says, "This is why we just heard
[5:34] this story."
[5:35] &gt;&gt; Right? Therefore, shall a man leave his
[5:37] father and his mother and shall cleave
[5:38] unto his wife, and they shall be one
[5:40] flesh. This is an important point. This
[5:42] isn't just something that we can pass
[5:44] over, but that it would indicate the
[5:48] process of building a marriage. If we're
[5:50] going to start, if we're going to build
[5:51] families, if we're going to build the,
[5:53] you know, the foundation of the family
[5:55] is the marriage and the foundation of
[5:57] the marriage is the man, right? Because
[5:59] God started there. God started with a
[6:01] man and then added the woman to the man.
[6:04] And if you get that out of order, you
[6:06] get that out of order, you're going to
[6:07] end up with all kinds of problems,
[6:09] &gt;&gt; right? That it is it because the man is
[6:11] the head of the home, right? That, you
[6:13] know, we'll we'll get there at some
[6:14] point. I don't know if we'll get there
[6:15] today, but you know that particular
[6:17] scripture um you know talking about that
[6:20] uh the husband is the head of the wife
[6:22] Jesus Christ is the head of the church
[6:24] right and husbands love your wives even
[6:25] as Christ loved the church. So there's a
[6:27] there's a a calling for the men to
[6:29] behave as Christ would behave
[6:32] and that that's the foundation.
[6:34] Everything's built on the man and his
[6:36] relationship with God. Right? Um,
[6:41] so there's two co key concepts that I
[6:43] want to kind of keep forefront in our
[6:45] mind in dealing with any of this. And
[6:47] the first is that if the natural types
[6:50] the spiritual, then the spiritual
[6:51] predicts and determines the natural,
[6:54] right?
[6:56] English when if the natural type's a
[6:59] spiritual then what's going on
[7:01] spiritually is simply a predictor of
[7:04] what's going to happen naturally.
[7:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[7:08] If in the garden of Eden when Adam left
[7:11] the garden or left the uh Adam fell and
[7:15] God's going through the garden saying,
[7:17] "Adam, Adam, where art thou?" God is not
[7:19] asking, "What bush is Adam hiding
[7:21] behind?" Right? He's asking, "Adam,
[7:26] where's your heart?
[7:28] Your heart's left the garden. Your
[7:30] heart's not with me anymore. Where did
[7:33] you go spiritually?"
[7:35] And what happens and we see this with
[7:37] with in a marriage before a marriage
[7:40] goes bust or when children rebel against
[7:43] their parents the hearts leave the
[7:46] family first
[7:48] right it is always the heart that leaves
[7:50] first and
[7:53] but and it's and it's a predictor right
[7:56] the the the the when the heart leaves
[8:00] that's when the person the heart always
[8:02] leaves before the person physically
[8:03] leaves. Yeah,
[8:04] &gt;&gt; right. Adam had to leave the garden
[8:06] because spiritually he had already left
[8:08] the garden. His heart had already been
[8:11] gone before he had to leave the garden.
[8:14] Right? So what happens spiritually is
[8:18] the is the determinator for what will
[8:20] happen physically. And then kind of key
[8:23] to this is that a marriage does not
[8:25] start at an altar. It starts when a
[8:28] young man gets the Holy Ghost and moves
[8:30] out of his father's home. Okay? There is
[8:33] it is important that a young man leave
[8:36] his father and mother before he goes and
[8:37] seeks a wife. Right? That's scriptural.
[8:41] That's and and I'll I'll uh let me um
[8:45] come down to my other other scriptures
[8:47] here. So in John 14, in my father's
[8:49] house are many mansions. If it were not
[8:51] so, I would have told you. I go to
[8:52] prepare a place for you. And if I go and
[8:54] prepare uh and if I go and prepare a
[8:56] place, I will come again and receive you
[8:59] unto myself, that where I am, there may
[9:02] ye be also. And whether I go
[9:06] uh whether I go, you know, and the way
[9:09] you know. So here's Christ. Christ does
[9:12] not have an invisible union with a bride
[9:14] until he goes and prepares a place for
[9:16] her. Okay? young men who want to go take
[9:20] a wife to, you know, and have have a
[9:23] marriage, it is your responsibility to
[9:25] be able to provide for her and have a
[9:27] home outside of your dad's spare
[9:29] bedroom. Okay? That's not preparing a
[9:33] place, right? And I can already hear
[9:36] someone go, "Well, actually, it says in
[9:38] my father's house." Well, okay.
[9:42] Okay. You might have an argument if I
[9:44] were a trinitarian,
[9:46] but I am not. The the fact of the matter
[9:49] is it is Christ going to prepare a place
[9:51] for his bride before he goes 2,000 years
[9:54] later to to have an invisible union.
[9:56] This is a pattern that we are to follow.
[9:58] Okay? It is important that a if a young
[10:01] man cannot prepare a home and provide a
[10:03] home to that girl, he's not fit to marry
[10:07] her. Period. Okay? That is that is
[10:10] that's not um it's not just good advice.
[10:15] Okay? It is good advice, but it's not
[10:16] just good advice, right?
[10:20] It is it is actually vital that a that a
[10:22] man is able to provide for his family.
[10:24] It is it is key. It is integral. It is
[10:27] not like I said before, the family is
[10:30] not just a a nice benefit to the message
[10:34] of the hour. It is core to the message
[10:36] of the hour. Okay? The same thing with
[10:39] your finances and your ability to
[10:41] provide for your wife and your family as
[10:42] a man. It is not just a side note. It's
[10:47] core and it's integral. Okay. Um
[10:54] I'll I'll read this. This is 1 Timothy
[10:56] chapter 5. But if any provide not for
[10:59] his own and especially for those of his
[11:02] own house, he hath denied the faith and
[11:05] is worse than an infidel.
[11:07] Okay. that any man who can who who is
[11:10] not providing for his family and and I
[11:12] will just make a note here and and again
[11:13] at some point I will
[11:16] well I I think I I I let's just do it
[11:18] now um the that provide there to provide
[11:23] for your family that's not just finances
[11:28] okay remember the natural types the
[11:30] spiritual if you are failing to provide
[11:32] for your family financially it's a
[11:34] pretty safe odds that you are not
[11:37] providing for your family spiritually
[11:38] either. Okay, you it is it is incumbent
[11:42] upon every man. You will be it's not
[11:45] just something that's going to make your
[11:47] life easy. It's something that you will
[11:48] answer to God for on the day of
[11:50] judgment. If you fail to provide for
[11:52] your family both physically and
[11:53] spiritually if you do not put food on
[11:55] the table and a roof over their head,
[11:56] but also when they have spiritual needs,
[11:59] it is your job to handle that. is your
[12:02] job to be the provider spiritually and
[12:04] to lead them and guide them into things
[12:06] that they have need of when they have
[12:08] questions, when they have concerns, when
[12:10] when your when your children need need
[12:12] direction and guidance, you have to be
[12:15] there. Not just that, but man, and and
[12:18] man, I wow, time goes and I don't really
[12:21] have time to get into this too much, but
[12:24] listen, children, I'll just say this.
[12:28] There was a um this isn't in my notes so
[12:30] I'm going to kind of go off road here
[12:31] for a minute. Um there was I believe in
[12:34] the late 1800s early 1900s I might have
[12:36] the dates a little bit wrong but the
[12:39] story is is the same. Back in the day um
[12:42] there was a orphanage it was commonly
[12:45] known that u when a mother died early on
[12:48] like in childbearing or something like
[12:49] that and there was no nobody to take
[12:51] care of the baby. babies would go to an
[12:53] orphanage and it was commonly known that
[12:55] babies in an orphanage would die. They
[12:58] did not live. They they would live maybe
[13:01] a couple of months and um nobody knew
[13:05] exactly why because it wasn't that they
[13:06] weren't being fed. It wasn't that they
[13:07] weren't being, you know, clothed and and
[13:10] washed and things like that. It's just
[13:12] they had an incredibly high mortality
[13:13] rate. Virtually no babies made it to to
[13:16] adulthood if they were raised in an
[13:18] orphanage.
[13:20] And uh there was no immediately apparent
[13:23] reason why their physical needs were
[13:25] being taken care of, but they would just
[13:26] die. And nobody knew why. And so a
[13:29] doctor found out one day that there was
[13:31] an orphanage in Germany in that did not
[13:33] have a near 100% mortality rate for
[13:36] infants. And this was a huge revelation.
[13:40] He's like, "We got to go. I got to go
[13:41] get down there immediately. We got to
[13:42] figure out what's going on. Why are
[13:43] these babies not dying?" Because this is
[13:45] everybody knows it around the world.
[13:46] Everybody knows babies just die. And so
[13:49] he gets there and the only difference
[13:51] the only difference between this
[13:53] orphanage and all the other orphanages
[13:55] was that the the lady who ran the
[13:57] orphanage
[13:58] made it a point every single day made it
[14:02] a point to pick up and hold and love on
[14:05] every single one of those babies.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; Every single one of them. She made a
[14:10] point even if it was a few minutes, a
[14:12] few hours, whatever it was, she made she
[14:14] didn't go anywhere without a baby on her
[14:15] hip because she had to make sure she had
[14:17] time in her day for every single baby
[14:19] under her care because they all need to
[14:21] be held and shown affection.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; All of them. And what and so many times
[14:26] and we there's man I I get into there's
[14:29] a lot of scientific literature on this.
[14:30] Babies need affection. And it doesn't
[14:33] just stop when they're babies. Your
[14:35] children need the affection of their
[14:37] parents. They need time. They need
[14:38] personal time. You need to build a
[14:40] relationship with them. You do not get
[14:42] to let them grow up to teenagers. And
[14:44] then when their heart left the home, if
[14:46] you neglected their heart for the first
[14:48] 13 years of their life, you don't get to
[14:49] scratch your head and wonder what
[14:51] happened.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; Okay? You have you have a certain you
[14:55] have until they are teenagers to build a
[14:57] heart connection with them. Okay? Their
[15:00] heart will leave just like Adam's left.
[15:02] And when Adam's heart left, so did Adam.
[15:05] And when your children's heart leaves
[15:07] your home, they will leave right behind
[15:08] it.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[15:10] &gt;&gt; Okay. You You have an obligation. You
[15:12] have an obligation as a parent to to woo
[15:16] your children the way God woos his
[15:18] children.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; To build a connection. Fight for their
[15:22] for their heart.
[15:24] &gt;&gt; Fight to to have a love connection there
[15:27] because I you know you because ah I'm
[15:30] I'm I'll I'll get tongue tied and and
[15:32] shut down on this and I I just don't
[15:33] have time to to get into it. I will get
[15:35] here at some point. I promise. But just
[15:37] just bear that in mind. You have an
[15:39] obligation to to fail to build that
[15:42] connection with your children is to deny
[15:44] the faith and be worse than an infidel.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; Okay? It is important that you do that
[15:49] because it is the only thing. You are
[15:50] the first version of God that they will
[15:52] ever see.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; You're the first version of God. And if
[15:55] you if if dad cannot set his golf clubs
[15:59] down long enough to spend time with his
[16:00] kids,
[16:02] then he is not being Christ to those
[16:04] kids. Christ set aside heaven and earth.
[16:07] He set aside the throne of glory to tell
[16:09] his children that he loved them. And if
[16:11] and if you know, I'm I'm sorry, but if
[16:14] your fishing pole has to collect some
[16:15] dust so that you can spend some time
[16:17] with your kids, so be it.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; Okay? You've got to do that. It is it is
[16:22] your obligation. It's what you signed up
[16:24] for when you had kids.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; And I'll I'll uh
[16:31] I'll I'll just make one one final point
[16:34] because I am I am rapidly running out of
[16:36] time. One final point just sort of
[16:38] hitting that point about the natural um
[16:42] sort of natural provision. Um it is
[16:45] especially in this day and age and I
[16:47] know it's in this economy things are the
[16:49] way that they are. And I but I I just
[16:51] want to I want to read this. This is
[16:52] something I read. Um this is from and
[16:55] knoweth it not. Um he says um
[17:00] uh just watch, stay close to Christ. Let
[17:03] me warn you now as a minister of the
[17:05] gospel. Don't take any foolishness.
[17:07] Don't imagine anything. Stay right there
[17:08] until this inside of the inside is
[17:10] anchored to the word that you're right
[17:12] in Christ because that's the only thing
[17:14] that's um going to because we're in the
[17:17] most deceiving age that we ever lived
[17:18] in. It would deceive the very elected if
[17:22] it was possible because they have
[17:24] anointing. They can um they can do
[17:27] anything like the rest of them. Clean
[17:29] your lives up, pay your debts, owe no
[17:34] man.
[17:36] Jesus said, um uh let's see now. I don't
[17:39] mean things like your house rent and
[17:41] stuff. You got to do it. Get all your
[17:43] things off your hands. Get everything
[17:44] right. Make ready. Get ready. remember
[17:47] in the name of the Lord something's
[17:48] fixing to happen. So he said that on uh
[17:52] August the 15th
[17:55] and then August the 22nd. So this is one
[17:58] week later he actually gives some
[18:00] commentary on what he just said. Um
[18:04] uh I said um now someone uh someone
[18:09] asked should we buy a car? Um, now that
[18:11] isn't what Jesus spoke of or the Bible
[18:13] there, um, that said, "Oweow no man
[18:15] nothing." That's lingering debts that
[18:17] you could pay, pay them. That's owing no
[18:20] man nothing. It doesn't mean we owe our
[18:24] rent or our telephone bill and what
[18:26] more. We owe those things and we pay
[18:28] them. But an old lingering debt that you
[18:30] could be paying on, pay it off. See,
[18:33] don't go with anything hanging on you
[18:35] like that.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; Okay? You speak going to going to to the
[18:39] other side. Don't pass on. Don't try to
[18:42] face the rapture if you have a bunch of
[18:44] lingering debt.
[18:46] He said, and this is the same same
[18:48] sermon, but I'm going to skip a
[18:49] paragraph because uh just for the sake
[18:52] of time. He says, "Oh, some Christian
[18:53] here at the church one time went out and
[18:55] got some work done on a car here. Um and
[18:58] the man came down. The man said, "I'll
[19:00] pay you. I'll get I get paid Saturday or
[19:02] something another." And he never paid
[19:04] him. And weeks after weeks rolled by and
[19:08] never paid him, never said a word. And
[19:10] the man come and ask me, see, it
[19:14] reflects against the church.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; It reflects against Christ.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; If you can't pay him, go tell him. Say,
[19:22] I owe you and I'm going to pay you. I'm
[19:24] a Christian, but I just can't do it
[19:26] right now. I owe this. And you remember
[19:30] it's on God's books, too. You know that
[19:33] you do.
[19:35] Right? When you owe someone money, it's
[19:38] on God's books, too. Don't h It's in
[19:42] It's in the Bible. It's in the message
[19:44] of the hour. Christians oughtn't be
[19:46] racking up 30 $40,000 in credit card
[19:49] debt of just consumer debt because they
[19:51] wanted to go on vacation to Disneyland.
[19:54] &gt;&gt; Okay? You oughtn't do that. You You owe
[19:57] that,
[19:58] &gt;&gt; right? That's going to that's going to
[19:59] be you're going to have to answer for
[20:01] that one day. if you're just racking up
[20:03] debt and then and that you can't pay
[20:05] back right now. Again, we understand
[20:07] there's difference between, you know,
[20:09] rent, your mortgage, your car payment,
[20:11] medical bills, something like that.
[20:13] That's different. That's not the same
[20:15] thing. But if you're just smoking your
[20:17] credit card because you got to have the
[20:18] latest, greatest toys, that's wrong.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; Okay? The Bible says it's wrong. And
[20:25] I'll I'll end with this because I I got
[20:26] two minutes left.
[20:30] Um I just I'll just read three bullet
[20:33] points that I have here in my notes. It
[20:35] says when we say that we are Christian
[20:37] husbands that means something more than
[20:40] that we are husbands who also go to
[20:41] church. It is a public declar de
[20:43] declaration that we are leading our
[20:45] homes in the way Christ would lead our
[20:48] homes.
[20:50] Number two if the natural types of
[20:52] spiritual then the spiritual determines
[20:53] the natural. If the heavenly groom has
[20:56] made an invisible union with their
[20:57] earthly bride, then our marriages should
[21:00] reflect and demonstrate what that looks
[21:03] like made flesh. We are the invisible
[21:06] union made flesh. Allegedly,
[21:09] right? Allegedly, we are the word made
[21:13] flesh in this day. Well, what's the word
[21:14] made flesh in our day? Christ has come
[21:17] down. There's an invisible union. We're
[21:18] going to a marriage supper. They're
[21:20] supposed How are we supposed to be the
[21:22] fulfillment of that if our marriages are
[21:24] completely contrary to the word of God?
[21:26] If our families are completely in
[21:27] disarray
[21:30] and and I'll I'll finish with this. It
[21:32] says uh we say preach the gospel with
[21:36] all your hearts and when all else fails
[21:38] use words. So when our families are not
[21:42] a reflection of the heavenly family,
[21:45] then we are preaching an antichrist
[21:47] message to the world through our
[21:49] lifestyle.
[21:51] That's hard,
[21:53] &gt;&gt; but it's true, right? When your family
[21:56] is in chaos, when you are not living
[21:59] according to the word, when you are not
[22:01] taking on the role of the in the family
[22:03] that God has laid upon you in the word
[22:05] of God, right? When husbands do not
[22:08] honor their wives, do not love their
[22:10] wives the way Christ would love the
[22:12] church. When the when the wives do not
[22:15] honor their husbands and do not follow
[22:17] their husbands in the way that the the
[22:19] church follows after Christ. When
[22:21] children are not obedient to their
[22:23] parents and are just going every which
[22:24] way and they're they're completely
[22:26] rejecting the instruction of their
[22:28] parents and not following their parents,
[22:30] then what that is it's it's just natural
[22:32] typing the spiritual folks. It's all it
[22:35] is. The natural is determined by the
[22:37] spiritual. And if your spirit, if our
[22:40] hearts are not connected, that's why I
[22:42] read that that quote, if you'll remember
[22:44] from the message oneness where brother
[22:46] Brandham said, anything that disrupts
[22:48] the unity of the family is not of God,
[22:51] right? There has to be a heart
[22:52] connection because that's how we reflect
[22:56] God's relation to his church. We have a
[22:59] heart connection with God. We have a
[23:01] heart connection to our brothers and
[23:02] sisters. And bear in mind a church is
[23:05] simply a collection of families. The
[23:08] things the the the things that that
[23:10] afflict us in our family dynamics will
[23:12] unfold on the church level. If every
[23:15] church family in the church is disrupted
[23:18] and broken and there's disunityity, then
[23:21] there will be disunityity in the b in
[23:22] the church body itself because it's just
[23:24] going to roll up the chain.
[23:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Right? You can't if you don't have unity
[23:30] in your own family, then you can't have
[23:31] unity with your brothers and sisters in
[23:33] Christ either. It will it that's where
[23:35] it's going to go, right? Natural is
[23:37] determined by the spiritual. And and
[23:41] you know, it'll just keep moving up the
[23:43] up the line. And and it's not a again,
[23:48] it is not for nothing that on the in the
[23:51] in Acts chapter 2 that they were in one
[23:53] mind and one accord. They they had a
[23:56] heart connection in the church and
[23:57] that's what brought the move of the
[23:58] spirit amongst them.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:01] &gt;&gt; Okay. And if we do not have connection,
[24:03] if we do not have we're not operating in
[24:06] love and that's part of the reason why I
[24:08] read that scripture in in in Romans 13
[24:11] that all the law can be summed up in
[24:14] love your neighbor as yourself. All of
[24:16] it. You have to have unity and that
[24:18] you're operating in love one towards
[24:20] another. If you don't, then you will not
[24:23] have the Lord moving in your church.
[24:25] Okay. At the end of the day, that's
[24:27] where all this is leading. But it starts
[24:30] it starts at your own home.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; It starts in your own family that you
[24:34] start there and build get actual true
[24:37] divine love. And that doesn't man well
[24:39] anyways. I'm out of time. I'm going to
[24:41] I'm going to quit. I'll just finish that
[24:43] and say finish that thought and say you
[24:44] have to have divine love in your own
[24:46] family. And that doesn't just mean that,
[24:49] you know, we just um anything goes and
[24:51] and we just want to have gentle
[24:53] parenting and um you know, we don't want
[24:55] to be invasive in our children's lives.
[24:57] And no, true love means that you'll
[24:59] bring correction if it's if it's needed.
[25:01] True love means that husbands and wives
[25:03] can have conflict. You can have an
[25:06] argument with your wife, but you'll do
[25:08] it in a way that's that's subject to the
[25:10] Holy Spirit. You can have conf I mean,
[25:12] every marriage is going to have have
[25:13] conflict. They all do. they have to, you
[25:15] know, it's called an engagement for a
[25:18] reason, right? Um, but look, they're all
[25:23] going to have conflict, but but there's
[25:26] a pathway to do that subject to the word
[25:29] of God and to do it properly under under
[25:32] the the the anointing of of of um of
[25:37] divine love. So, we'll pull the brakes
[25:41] there before I end up in the song
[25:43] service. We'll have a word of prayer.
[25:46] Father, Lord, we come before you this
[25:49] morning. We ask that you would that you
[25:51] would take these broken words, this
[25:53] these stammering lips, Father, and that
[25:54] you would maybe take the things that
[25:57] were said today and Lord, that someone
[26:00] could hold on to it. Give them strength
[26:03] by it, Lord, that you could take it and
[26:04] you would know how to place those words
[26:06] in the hearts of the people that it
[26:08] would bring it would bring life and it
[26:10] would bring encouragement. We thank you,
[26:12] Father, for all that you do for us.
[26:14] Thank you for the anointing that you
[26:15] bring. Ask that you'd be with us through
[26:17] the remaining of the service, through
[26:18] the the worship service, and into the
[26:21] ministering of the word. We ask these
[26:23] things in the name of the Lord Jesus
[26:24] Christ. Amen.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
