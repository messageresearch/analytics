visited so amen we're going to really Heap on the guilt but we're happy to have them amen happy to hear my second goddaughter out here singing tonight praise the Lord and all the family and Grandma I kept thinking who is Tony talking about Grandma I remember him calling such a gene man I thought who would that be and then I heard sister Dorothy start up I was immediately in the right place at the right time amen God bless you we want to turn to Hebrews chapter 11 this evening we want to just move quickly along I don't I don't want to use the word quickly but let me just move studiously along because we kind of made an announcement today that we're abbreviating every little bit here and we've cut back a little bit on the cut into brother Anthony's time going to cut into my own time a little bit we're gonna I'm Gonna Give You Anthony's leftover time and my leftover time I'm gonna give it to you amen and we're going to come up around like in the old days and pre-pandemic pre-pandemonic and uh and pray Urbana around the altar so cap Sarah you picked a good weekend amen praise the Lord so then we're going to have some testimonies I'm sure that you've got got some I've already heard a number of good ones on so we're going to have some of those repeated tonight just take a little time for that amen it's wonderful and I love love doing it last week we did it on Wednesday and brought you up nobody had a testimony and I said my goodness everybody's in vapor lock and I I got home I said well you know they hadn't done it in so long probably called everybody off guard so tonight I'm sure that almost ever we'll probably have to shut y'all down on testimonies tonight praise the Lord Hebrews chapter 11 I want by the grace of God to pick up the continuation of a thought that I've preached on in December and in December we took a title called a sure foundation and I want to take part two of that tonight I believe if memory serves you'll find that and maybe in the first or second week of December if you're going to look for that on the archive if you haven't heard part one but tonight want to catch part two we're going to actually take our same opening text I believe is what we used last time Hebrews 11 beginning at verse 32. and what shall I more say for time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barrack and of Samson and jephthah and David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed Valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life now if you just stop right there you'd say my goodness what a successful military campaign this Army whoever they were were Unstoppable undefeatable all right now now we're going to flip but I want you to remember what you're about to read did not diminish the Victorious position of the same Army all right they were still just as Victorious and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourging yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sauna Sunder we're tempted we're slain with the sword where they wondered about in sheepskins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented can we think of any other horrible descriptive terms here Now Catch Paul's summation whether they were successful what it looks like successful or what looks like unsuccessful of whom both sides the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and in caves of the Earth all and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect let's pray father we thank you for your word tonight Lord and I just stand here Lord and surrender myself fresh father my whole heart and mind just into your care take the word Lord as you have brought it to me throughout the number of days Lord been looking at these notes and adding a little here and a little there as you inspired me and Lord it just seemed today the windows of Heaven open I could hardly contain it and yet we have an abbreviated service tonight and so I'm just asking you now Lord to be the preacher you'll get it all said and it'll be said perfectly Lord I commit myself into your hands in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated and um excuse me one minute I realized that I missed one of my prayer requests I've had a number of prayer requests come in and I got one from my sister earlier today and I meant to read it and meant to post it here in my notes but I failed to do that so let me just catch that or I'll forget it sure is anything it's not brother Lisa that would be Sister Lisa amen praise the Lord have a number of prayer requests we'll get to them just at the end praise God now it's amazing um the scripture that we read and how that God really is not um how would I say this he's not you know mincing words and he's not trying to you know sometimes if you come in a situation and you ever hear the old term the elephant in the room and it's the thing nobody wants to talk about and everybody just kind of avoids it in this the air is awkward because everybody knows what needs to be said but nobody wants to say it and God just walks down into our building tonight and just says hey I'm going to talk about the elephant in the room whether it looks successful or whether it looks like a failure you're still Victorious and and whatever you do don't don't be afraid to say hey I'm in the middle of a trial and I need prayer because that's part of the program that we in fact is that we find out that you know we we none of us like this idea and even brother Brandon would talk about you know it's too bad it has to be this way but sometimes situations uh occur in our lives Trials Come afflictions come and it's all for our gain it's all for our advancement it's all to build character because there's just no way to build human character apart from suffering you you literally have to have the contrast you it's impossible for you to appreciate a sunny day without a rainy day now you might say oh no I'd like every if every day was sunny I promise you after a while you'd be glad to have a rainy day you can't appreciate real happiness without a contrast of some sadness you can't appreciate gain without loss what I'm really glad is that when we cross into a new heavens and a new Earth and I made some comments about this on Sunday uh at the memorial service for sister Jan there that when we have that body and in that new heavens and in that new world and in that new everything where everything is God and God is everything in expression and there's not any iota of anything else that's not him an expression think of it friends there in that condition you won't need contrast you'll never have to come in the Aeons of time back to a hardship and a trial and a suffering and a loss or separation all is peace forever more on that happy Golden Shore and you know you know if we be honest we we long for that none of us you know I I I feel this way a lot that Lord I I wouldn't that you hasten your coming but yet I don't want a shortcut you know I I do want to be there but I don't want to be there till it's over and I I don't want to go ahead I want us all to go together amen and I and I I feel that way very genuinely and very sincerely and I I say Lord give me give me strength to I want to be like poets nothing wrong with wanting to go Paul wanted to go Paul said I'm in a great Strait see because I'd like to I'd like to be on the other side having seen it I'd like to go back but for your sakes it's better if I stay and so humanly speaking I'm in this I'm in this quandary in my spirit and and so but you have to understand that Paul reached a place where he could actually say I have I have ran my race I have finished my course and I ran it well and I finished my course and you know I I I I feel like with this world is is every day less and less my home but really friends if you just uh bear in mind that it's only the world order that's so uh abrasive to you it's only the world order this world was built for you and there's great Heavenly Joys and realities that lay just ahead for every last one of us and I just I just every day I wake up and I thank God for life and I thank him for Liberty and I thank him for Faith and I'm thinking for a determination to keep pressing especially as I began to see the security of the believer the more more and more in the word every day we see it we I I I believe that we're coming to it and I think it's happening to us all I know that we struggle with insecurities I get that we're human beings sadly but the but the bottom line is the prophet said you know when the bride recognizes who she is then that that's really the that's really the Catalyst that's that's going to give you the kind of Faith you need say well I how what kind of Faith do I need how do I get it I will say to you tonight don't worry because he who's made the plan has got the remedy he's got the solution you understand that when he came to Abraham we made this comment in part one when he came to Abraham God not only gave him the promise but he gave him the requirement and he gave him the goods he gave him a promise and said now here's the requirement but I'm going to go ahead and give it to you and the whole thing came in one ball of Wax and Abraham believed God and from that moment nothing no failure of Abraham no backsliding no nothing uh nor that promise it couldn't have known it because it was a unconditional Covenant and the bride is realizing today that God is the one who called us God is the one who issued the requirement and God has provided the solution to his own demand and the more I absorb that the more I see that the more that becomes a reality to me and I say it almost every day because I see my weaknesses every day I see my stumblings every day and so I I just want to say to the devil take that devil because you tricked me but that made my faith stronger and now I love God even more and I hate you even more and I want Heaven even more and I want even more separation the devil can't win for losing he could actually win if he wasn't always losing Adam's part as we we made this I've got several lines that just to just to connect back to part one because it was more than a month ago but Adam's part I'm sorry Abraham's part was to hear and to recognize or to believe hearing recognizing or hearing receiving or hearing believing and acting so receiving believing recognizing brother Branham would use those terms all to mean the same thing it's the middle category his part was to hear it his part was to recognize it to receive it to believe it and then once he had accomplished that second part he was to act upon it in real time thank you brother and so we can see in the Bible and and this this is such a beautiful thing if you would just absorb this for your own life tonight listen the Bible says that Abraham staggered not at the promise he didn't say Abraham staggered not we all fall short all of us do there's none good only Jesus was the perfect one it didn't say Abraham didn't stumble it is said he didn't stagger at the promise he did he had all brother we can read in the Bible and that hey harry fled the promised land to Egypt and a prophet in this day said as soon as a Jew leads the promised land he's backslid so I can say on the authority of scripture interpreted by a prophet Abraham backslid that don't don't faint don't throw something at me Abraham backslid how do you not read it he got down there lying trying to save his own skin and that was God's predestinated elected and charge free prophet the unindictable prophet of God was down there conniving and sneaking and lying and did God let him get away with it no did God let the rest of Egypt get away with it sure but not Abraham God let the world go right on but he won't let you go right on because you're his child and he'll bring the rod of Correction or this a direct tape teaching brother Branham says you'll do wrong direct quote you'll willfully do wrong it doesn't mean you're not a son it just means the rod of Correction is on the way he stumbled in weakness yet but in his faith he never staggered at the promise he kept going say how do you know he never staggered because he kept going how do you know he didn't stagger the promise because when he stumbled in his flesh he kept going and he repented and he and he turned his feet and went back to the promised land Hallelujah we find him coming up again lying Abraham had had these ticking time bombs I preached on that some years ago at the men's meeting he just had these ticking time bombs and all it took was the right circumstance we've got those we can be ever so spit feel ever so spiritual in church and we do but you know as well as I know and I know that you know and you know that I know we all know that we know that sometimes if we're not careful and our prayer life gets waning our church attendance wanes and our fellowship Wings all Satan has to do is get you in the right circumstance at the right place at the right time and the right thing happened and you've got a problem oh but I'm here to tell you once Abraham had that promised son once the office of son was on the scene Abraham never fell again he never staggered again and what do we have today but the ministry of the son of man it's back among us and this bride is recognizing who she is when we read that 40th verse and here's the last point that I wanted to make from part one and I'm saying other things that wasn't there but I wanted to for sure get these two or three here and here's the last one that 40th verse when we read that 40th verse and Paul saying to the to the to the New Testament era Church and at first 39 40 and these all in the Old Testament having obtained a good report through faith and they had even been resurrected and went with Christ on Resurrection morning amen and we we were talking about it with some Brothers Here recently because if you look at the qualification brother Branham said not every the Bible says that many of the Saints which slept arose see remember that that you've had a Remnant in every age and I don't want to get too deep teaching on this tonight I just want to make a quick mention of it but just remember that many of the graves many of the bodies of the Saints would slap Rose don't forget that the remnant the foolish virgin are called Saints they are called righteous they are called Sanctified ones so you understand but but they're not in the in the Millennium they don't go in the Rapture only only the redeemed go in the Rapture and you see that type not all of the bodies of the Saints which slept the rose but many of them did but brother Branham said not all of them did just because they were a Jew because not all Israel's Israel and so we find that brother Branham said not all of them Rose but who Rose it was those who with sincerity that they maintained in their lifetime a deep sincerity before God because they couldn't even be born again to the level in the soul that you can be by the Holy Ghost baptism it wasn't given yet you understand but yet without that that those gragged men and women of faith and young people of faith it didn't matter that that Joseph was young he he refused he refused to offend God it didn't matter that however young they were it didn't matter how young Samuel was and he was from a young boy ready to serve God and those men in Daniel with no church to go to for 60 years didn't even couldn't go to a church service like you and I go didn't have any Fellowship of anybody he had Shadrach Meshach and Abednego but they had actually been appointed Governors and rulers and Scattered across the kingdom he rarely saw them he literally sustained himself without the Holy Ghost experience like you have now he had plenty of experiences with the Holy Ghost but not bringing a a new birth like you have the right where it destroys the old nature this is what weary David brother Branham said because David knew the word should somehow live stronger he just knew it it should live stronger he said I I don't understand him brother Brown said it wearing him because he said you know I I tied it to my bed post I've put it between my eyes I meditate upon it day and night but brother Branham said it wearing him because he couldn't make it live out like he somehow knew it ought to and I say blessed be the name of the Lord you don't have to suffer David's weary you can pass from Death unto life and get a new nature and you're going to need it because the world is many many hundreds of times more evil than in the days of David but I'm here to tell you God has given us the requirement and has given us the solution and he's provided the sacrifice and this is all part of a bride understanding who she is and that's where her strength comes from because they those graves are the ones which arose they obviously they couldn't rise because they were lineage to Abraham because Jesus talked to people who were the lineage of Abraham and they were the children of the devil they said we have Abraham to Our Father and Jesus didn't argue that wouldn't have done him any good because they had family records they could prove it but they were of their father the devil because they're the spirit of the devil and it didn't matter that they could or couldn't keep the law it had nothing to do coming out of the Grave wasn't that they kept the law because frankly if you offended in the least you're guilty of the whole the problem with keeping the law is nobody could if anyone could Jesus wouldn't have had to the fact that he had to prove that's why he gave him the law to prove to him they couldn't keep it oh God gave him an unconditional Covenant gave him a prophet gave him a pillar of fire and they did and they wanted something to do in their own I'm here to tell you tonight I don't want none of my own my own's no good my own frustrates me I want his and his alone Hallelujah so we realize that this is the this is the strength what brought them out of the grave what's that they had brother and said it was those that had that sincere that's a powerful word that's sincere Faith like Abraham had that constant Never Say Die never say quit never say Retreat that constant sincerity it didn't matter come what may they were going to serve Jehovah they had their ups and downs they were men and women of like passions brother said it meant they had their ups and downs but yet they kept pressing they kept pressing and that's the day and I'll an hour that I live in say how do you know you're going to Rapture because I know I got that same sincerity so how do you know you got that because I know it in my life you say do you make mistakes I do but that but that tells them a Believer because I repent and I press on and I press on and I press on and I'm pressing tonight and I'll be pressing tomorrow and there's no possibility I've already passed the point of no return there is no possibility for them the devil to turn me around short of a new birth you can be turned around trust me if you can be persuaded and you can be dissuaded out brother Burley says brother Jason I learned a long time ago if somebody can get you in with a hot dog somebody gets you out with a hamburger I said barley you're the only one who would ever come up with that and I that is so true but this verse 40 Paul is telling them with everything you had without us you could never be made perfect and that and he was talking to the church that thought the Rapture was imminent unaware it would it would take seven Church ages and two 20 centuries and we're still here and now we look back and go oh you think so Paul guess what without us you can't be made perfect what it what that 39th and 40th verse means is that there was still more to do I know we're tired I know we're weary I know the world is evil but there's still more to do we gotta press harder because if we were done we'd be gone we have a sure Foundation tonight so we find then that this ability to hear and to recognize and act on the revealed word that's that's that's literally how it's got to come these Cycles I don't want to get too too bogged down tonight in teaching because I may carry this over into Sunday I don't know yet I don't have my marching orders yet I've got a lot of material don't know exactly how it'll go this here's a month coming after part one so that just gives you some idea of how it can go I don't get to choose it but but we find then that you know you you can you can see all of these these types if you go back and you you look at Adam and I'm just I'm just going to drop this pert Venture the Lord will let me pick it back up this weekend if he won't I'll remind you of it again amen so when you go back and you look at Adam free fall you're really seeing a really awesome parallel to the believer today Born Again of the spirit of God because he he talked with God he had fellowship with God and that's what the Holy Ghost restored it restored that lost Fellowship from Eden see and so we have that that that was a perfect type of a holy ghost that's why brother Branham said the third part of the Restoration in the back part of his mind was to restore the kingdom that's us to our rightly I love that word that means it's your rights you have a right to go back to that kind of a life that Adam enjoyed you have a right and I'm here to tell you some friends we are on our road there and you're already part of the way because your your soul is already crossed the across the chasm of sin and it's back in the presence of God brother Branham said it's already back on the other side sitting in the presence of God in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus don't think linearly because you'll get messed up quantum mechanics is proving that quantum theory is proving that today like never before I just was reading a statement from one of the leading professors and experts and he was quoting the pioneer of quantum theory and quantum mechanics and Quantum uh physics and he said and he made he made this statement I don't have it in front of me so it's not an exact quote but he he basically said that what they discovered in the quantum world that everything in this world that we consider real is made up of things that actually can't be real it's a whole they're they're they're they're beginning to get a whole paradigm shift I'm here to tell you they're starting to get a little bit of a a little bit of a crack into understanding that this great Creator and and I I had a quote today from Brother Eugene concerning Albert Einstein and he was just he was just trying to implore right before he's he's passing away that he said all my years and all my years of pondering and musing on this he said I have I am no closer today than fine in one question he said I'm no closer today to finding the answer to this impenetrable question and he's really looking for what's how did life start and what life is and I'm here to tell you something friends without going any further into it tonight I'll go to it deeper in the future but but don't don't get so wrapped up in what you see around you and let me say don't get so twisted and bent and discouraged by it don't don't go lusting after it because it ain't what you think it is and don't get discouraged by it because it ain't what the devil's telling you it is I'm here to tell you we've got something ahead of us where he and that word are going to become what you never dreamed possible say well but Adam Free Fall he had a perfect body he did but in understanding you outstrip him because he he understood nothing of redemption he didn't understand a A Healer a provider a savior a captain he don't understand any of those things and and so now we come today I'm here to take something friends being born in sin and and let me just say this to you I don't care where the devil took you to in sin once you have passed from Death to life you become more valuable to God having made all of those mistakes you become more valuable to God after being born in sin and come into the world speaking lies and I get that it can scar up our life and I get that it can put baggage on our life but I'm here to tell you if you can overcome all of that and stand Victorious you are a greater testimony we got a testimony service tonight you become a testimony you become Hebrews chapter 11. they're still writing verses about you and me oh brother Branham comes to proving his word and it's amazing because I've been wanting to hear this for a while and and a brother on our call-in brother Jack quoted from it and uh and so I thought and I actually copied and pasted the quote into notes that I'll either get to tonight but maybe not tonight but maybe Sunday and and so while I'm sitting there working and in the afternoon Mr Debbie nice our as our custom and we've got a tape playing so I just went for her just pick pick one and I just picked this one I said well let me just hear the whole thing and it opens up one that's brother Andrew said twice this one is from August the 16th 1964 preached it again in 65. but here's where he begins to tell and he told it a number of places this was a lot of detail here about the Caribou with 42 inch horns and the Silver Tip grizzly bear that he got both and prophesied and told him months in advance about how it would happen and gave detail all kinds of detail and and I and I thought tonight that that I might just take a look at this and and bring us bring let me try to bring to you my heart if I can is that okay I'm going to do it in a way I've never done it but it's how I feel it and so brother Branham picks up here and he says now he's going to give this testimony before he actually preaches a sermon and I'm just going to read through the testimony and comment to you as the Lord laid it on the heart and then we're going to wrap up and take up prayer request and give you an opportunity because listen uh testimonies are popping everywhere I'm constantly getting texts and phone calls God got several just in the last 48 hours got three I hadn't even heard it all and more and more things are happening I'm here to tell you something God God's busy and I don't know if you've noticed it or not but the world's getting really bad and I believe we're getting really close oh my I believe we're getting so close to the whole world I I was looking at a at a headline which was rather nauseating but but I it caught my attention because I remembered that back in 2019 there was a headliner right before the pandemic there was a headline about a state championship some young woman who had won you know I think she was maybe Miss Texas I don't remember if that might stand correction but I believe it was Texas and uh and that and of course that wouldn't be the to attract me but what attracted me was she was he was the first in history to win a Miss beauty contest because he was a trans man and I know politically they want me to say a trans woman hear me political world I ain't saying it I ain't saying it it's a dude dress up like a girl and some some some repulsive non-called non-genuine doctor tampered with what God did and got paid for it and you think this world isn't corrupt and he won Miss Texas or missed whatever state it was and then last year he made headlines again because he actually won he won the Miss USA pageant and he's a fellow filipino-american man so Filipino men are slight and small and so he's he's got features that he was you know with enough surgery and enough hormones he was able to make himself an enough Max Factor it's still still pretty ugly I don't see how he won but he did but it's political it's probably why he won in fact is that was the argument they're saying it's all rigged because they wanted him to win it because everybody was so proud that he's a trans man made to look like a woman I'm not here for political stump tonight I just want to throw this in and so today I catch the headline and it's this guy again and now he's not only went to the state level he won the nation he won the Miss USA in in a in a in a hole I forget how many you know probably 50 I guess I don't know I don't watch it thank God I guess 50 contestants would be in a Miss USA and here are women who have spent their whole life beautifying themselves rather in an ungodly fashion no doubt and here's some man born a man gets a surgery and puts on Max Factor and there's enough political pressure to give him the crown and set and set 49 ladies aside 49 women I won't call them ladies well guess what's the headline today he went on to the Miss Universe Pageant 28 Nations represented guess who you want to guess who won and there's they're calling it conspiracy because because you know he's he's definitely I mean and I saw a picture and I started I could have put it up tonight it was perfectly decent he's standing there with his crown and his flowers and there's I forget what do they call that Boca where the women behind him are in blur uh so you couldn't even see it too good I could have actually put it up but I could tell that by worldly standards by worldly standards the women standing behind him had had spent years and and were by the world standards beautiful now brother Benham said a real Son of God don't call that beautiful because it's fake anyway but here he is I could just as a human I could make the observation that he's less attractive but yet he wins the Miss Universe and I said to my wife I showed it to my wife I said this is the seal this goes to show you that the homosexual perverted agenda is now the king of the world that spirit is now global and the whole Global Community they know it was political all the lady contestants are up in Arrow ripsing it was all political of course it was political but that goes to show you the day and hour the day of Sodom the day of lot and the day of Noah we are right in the middle of it [Applause] Hallelujah I'm here to tell you something friend you I'm not here to to to to get on a stop and say oh it's hell it's horrible oh it's horrible I'm I'm here to get In a Pulpit and say we're almost home we're almost home we're almost home Hallelujah brother Branham says he's telling he went off with bud southwickened I don't know if you've ever heard Bud's testimony it's quite amazing he's went on to Glory now but they recorded his testimony years ago sitting by a campfire and he he corroborates everything brother Brandon is saying and even when brother Brandon was telling the story brother biscal is in the congregation and he was on this hunt he's the little guy in a green checkered shirt didn't think he had one forgot he didn't even know it was in his bag in fact is when he when he got it out he said I was actually a little upset at my wife because it had gotten torn and it was worn out and I had told my wife throw this thing in the trash sister Ruth being The Frugal housewife she mended it and stuck it in his hunting bag said well you can wear it hunting men don't like it when they get overruled by their wives in secret there's nothing he'd do about it when he got in the wilderness there was his shirt but but God knew before the foundation of the world God had already took a prophet forward in time and I don't want to even use the word I use the word for because we think of time as linear but time's not linear time is eternal time and we're talking about he took him not into time but he took him into eternity where brother Branham said where I can stand here and look back there and he said and I know I'm standing in this building and hoping people can still hear me but I'm somewhere else and I'm looking back in someone's past and then I can see him standing right in front of me and I can see him in the past and when he comes out he's not even sure what he even said I'm here to tell you something friends there's Realms and worlds of Realms we know nothing about but he'd already seen him standing there in that green checkered shirt brother Brandon picks up the story I gotta hurry he says when I got over got the character he talks about blood he says Bud told he said brother Branham and they talked about this this this great animal with 42 inch horns didn't make sense to Bud he said you know where we're going to there's there isn't that kind of an animal brother Brandon he said there maybe it'll be a different hunting trip brother I said no it's this one he said well brother Brown and I've hunted these Hills for all my life he said I'm telling you we're going into sheep country the animal you're talking about doesn't exist up there they don't live up there at all they're nowhere around us we'd have to go a long ways to get to them and so he says well we'll go and so the next day you know they're sitting by the campfire and they're getting ready to start out and Bud says well brother Branham says look said brother says you know we couldn't find them they weren't didn't seem to be anywhere and Bud said well look if you don't mind A Long Walk he said me and you can walk he said we go over this mountain range he said no that's a long walk brother Branham but if you don't mind brother Adam said well I like walking and uh and he he did he loved walking and brother brother Perry green tells how that brother Brandon when he was remember when he was shot at 14 and it tore all the muscle out of the back of his of his thighs and so if it is so the back of his legs on his thighs were just gone where the shotgun blew through him and so brother Branham actually developed a little tricky way to walk where he and I don't understand how it worked but he walked somehow from his knees down and he he it wasn't all about swinging his hips or moving moving the upper part of his legs and he could walk for 10 20 30 miles over mountainous ranges like that so he said but I like to walk and so away they went and just as sure as anything just exactly what a prophet said They Came Upon that caribou and brother Branham took him with a shot and Bud was astounded and they they dressed him and now they're trying to pack him back and brother M talks about you know we're carrying that big rack in that cape and man it's hot and we had to get down near Glacier you hear you're here until it he says he says now when I got over and got the caribou and Bud said to me now brother Branham you say these horns are 42 inches I said that's what they'll be he said looks to me like 92. and I said no they're 42 inches and he said now and he he was using that as a Segway see he's going to compliment brother Brandon before he insults him and he said now according to what you told me before we get back down to that boy down there with the checkered shirt on which no one knew there was a boy with a checkered shirt because brother Branham had already asked everybody in the camp you had a trick or church no ask brother Eddie you got to check her shirt no he didn't know it was in the bag he didn't know that God had predestinated before the foundation of the world and nothing could keep it out of that bag that bag could have caught on fire that shirt would have survived that bag could have got trapped under a nice Glacier the shirt would have floated to the top I don't know a bird would have carried it I don't know but he would have had that shirt on and so he says we're going before we get back down there to that boy with a checkered shirt on Eddie where they was going to meet us down below the mountain couple miles said you're going to kill a grizzly bear I said it's thus saith the Lord I just thought about that confidence that there he's standing with a guide who has hunted those areas he's a brother Brenham I've never seen one up here not a silver tip no way he said I've sent a sense a boy he said I've been all over these mountains brother Branham there are no silver tips they're much further away from here and he said well but he didn't believe the Caribou he didn't I mean he he said that animal is not around and the bear the Bear's not around and this must be the wrong hunting trip but it wasn't and he said now according to what you told me before we get back down there you're going to kill a grizzly bear I said it's thus saith the Lord he said brother Branham where is he coming from I can see from 50 miles around brother Branham says this now was way up above the Timberline up where sheep lived there's no no trees you're on the top of a high mountain any of you who have been in in western states and you know Big Sky country and I mean you can see like that they take powerful glass for uh scoping and things like that and when you get on top of those you know there's no trees there's no nothing and you can just see for as far like a pilot and you got visibility all around you and he says brother Branham I can see from 50 miles around us where there's where's he even gonna be hiding there's no even nowhere to hide him he says brother Brandon where is he going to come from I can see for 50 miles around and I said he's still Jehovah Jireh Abraham was on a Mountaintop where no Ram would have survived a day wouldn't have survived a day with the Predators and Abraham is standing right there and there's no Ram anywhere until he needs it and Jehovah Jireh provided him on the spot you know why you know why Jehovah did that brother Brahm said because his word had already declared it he says I said he's still Jehovah Jireh the Lord can provide for himself see he can make squirrels coming to existence if he can make a ram come into existence if he has spoken about a bear a bear can come into existence you know I I look around my life in the world and I feel like I got a good visibility I can see for 50 miles around my life I can see you know I can see all the way back to where I began this journey I have memories that go back to Childhood I remember the family that lived at 309 Hawthorne Drive and there was five of us strong and one was not because he was taken as an infant and now out of that family that sat around that table and drove to church in a car the remains myself my sister and my mother and I remember it like it was yesterday I remember standing in I remember one time standing in the bathroom and I got up on stood up on the toilet and looked in the mirror because I was nine and I wanted to see how I looked When I Was This Tall that's the truth I remember walking out on my porch and thinking I wonder how old I'll be how old would I be in the year 2000 it seemed like no that's ridiculous we'll never see the year 2000 yeah and this was you know just a boy we moved there in the early 1970s and and I I can see all the way back to where I began this journey and I'm I I'm close enough now to the promised years that I can I can look forward and see the end coming and I know I'm well over halfway there well over fact is I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm soon to you know I'm actually already in moving into uh I'm already in the third quarter and you know we're we're talking about promised years of 70 and then 80 maybe you make it to 80 and I'm already uh soon to be 60 and and I can see from where I start I can see my whole life brother Branham where's this Rapture going to come from I can see all the way back to my childhood and I've waited for that day since I was a boy and I'm looking toward the end time and I I can see but but I but but but but yet at the same time but at the same time I believe that I am the generation that will see the coming of the Lord and I can see where I started I can see that my end is coming close but I still believe that the Rapture is coming in my lifetime I see how improbable it is for me and I think that if we would be honest tonight it's not just about staying alive long enough there are going to be people who stay alive long enough who miss it by the billions who will be alive and remain and they'll remain but there will be a people alive and remain who will be gone because why like Enoch the Lord took them so it's not about living long enough to see it but really it's about being the kind of Overcomer being the right kind of hearer being the right kind of receiver being the right kind of acting I want to hear and I want to believe and I have heard and I do believe and now I'm acting on the word of God but is it enough am I going to make it I believe I will but at the same time that man in the mirror gives me gives me pause to say are you sure are you sincere enough are you righteous enough are you praying enough are you holy enough are you enough for God I can't be the only one who the devil tries to bother our minds with yes I know I've passed from Death of Life yes I know there's an amen or down inside of me but I'm also still a human who when I was reading I was hearing brother Branham say this and he said brother Branham that bear is going to be there but I can see everywhere It seems impossible and I just thought Lord how many times I've said on my knees repenting thinking it's impossible I can I can see my whole life I can see all my errors I can see all my mistakes I can see my weaknesses going forward I've still got these these inhibitions I'm still trying to overcome this I'm still trying to overcome that amen sometimes it can look very improbable if I had brother Branham here you know and I'd say between six and nine oh if I had Paul here if I had Paul here Paul in a moment yes in a twinkling of an eye yep really yep in a moment in a twinkling of an eye but I I can see 50 miles by the bread and I can see all around me where's it going to come from I see all my weaknesses I I see all my failures and you're telling me that somewhere between now and a wedding supper that my loved ones are gonna appear in my living room and I'm gonna be changed in a moment how's it going to happen brother Branham how's it going to be hell it's impossible Paul and brother Brandon would say he's still Jehovah-jireh the Lord can provide himself I'm here to tell you he's more than able oh Hallelujah if he has spoken about a resurrection I know this I've heard it and I know this I receive it and I know this I'm acting is that reacting very good I'm doing all I can I I can and I'm sincere with it I mean it I'm not a hypocrite I really believe God I really love his word I really want Perfection you don't have to convince me I don't have to convince you I know I too I've I've traded my life to have it I've dedicated my whole existence to it I've mortgaged my whole family to it my children my grandchildren I've led the most precious thing in the world to me to this life and I want to say to my family and to you and to your family none of us will be disappointed I'm here to tell you you can write it down in a book it's going to come to pass you're not going to be left holding the bag Hallelujah I'm going to be holding a crown just long enough to throw it at the feet of my Lord hallelujah how do I know the Rapture is real because I've heard the same voice of the Resurrection it raised Lazarus it raised Jesus it raised all the Old Testament Saints because they were sincere I have the same sincerity I have the same voice it'll raise the New Testament and it'll change me forever thank God thank God thank God Don't You Worry friends it'll change you forever and everything the devil has battled you over he'll not brother put him just like Moses he said these Egyptians whom you've seen today you will see them no more forever and he said this is okay I just want to finish this testimony this is my time for Testimony he says in us trying to pack this heavy Caribou down the trophy down the mountain I packed the rifle part of the timing he would pack the rifle and vice versa we got almost to a big glacier we got under there it was kind of hot we got in the glacier of ice and sit down there a while and cool off he said you know brother Branham we're not over a mile now before he was 50 mile radius that's 25 miles in every direction he says now we're not more than about a mile from where Eddie and Blaine them two boys be standing that old bear better be showing up I said bud I believe you're doubting it we have to own that because we get the same way come on own that we get the same way but it's not Bud's a real Christian Bud really is a believer but the circumstances look so impossible this time I mean it's yeah it's looked impossible before but brother Branham less than a month I told you before we left he wasn't up here when we when I could see 50 mile radius he wasn't anywhere and now we're a mile away he said brother I said but I believe you're doubting it he said brother Branham my brother had epileptic fits for years and you told me once the first time up here when we went down to another place told me what that boy looked like and Eddie was writing right by my side there on a horse when the lord gave the vision I and and brother biscal tells that in his testimony he was writing side by side with brother Branham his horse next to his horse and they were riding along and brother Branham says to brother Eddie I've Just Seen A Vision tell brother Bud here's what's here's what to do about his but he's got a brother in describe and he described him and said here's what you do he said you you tell his wife get a message to his wife and say that the next time he has one of those fits you rip that shirt off of him and you throw it into the wood stove and say this I do in the name of Jesus Christ and he'll never have another one now you explain that I don't know enough about quantum mechanics to tell you how that worked but I'm here to tell you that little bitty woman and she was a small woman and her husband was a big guy Bud's brother and Bud was a big old big old albertan cowboy and he and here he's going and he and he's and he and he says you tell her and she here he goes into one of those fits and brother Ed tells the story and that little half a nothing woman jumped on that great big guy ripped and clawed until she got that shirt on a man having an epileptic seizure and she got that shirt stripped off of him and opened the fire and threw it in there and said this I do in the name of Jesus Christ and he said he's never had another fit in his life he said and now he said I can't doubt it I said bud I don't know where the bear is coming from but he said I've never seen it fail God will give me that grizzly bear before I get to them boys and we was almost down where the small Spruce and Timber started in here to tell you something friends the world is falling apart and the days of Sodom and Noah have taken over the world Global instability is rampant financial markets are unstable world powers there's there's a powder keg in every region of the world right now just was reading today that the U.N now starting to become very friendly with terrorists who terrorize Israel and honoring them and recognizing men who have murdered their own their own U.N peacekeepers do you understand that prophecy says the whole world comes against Israel they hate her see and I'm here to tell you that it's literally a powder keg in every region of the world I mean Armageddon I want to say to you today we're we're almost down there we're almost down there friends we're almost down there just like Bud saying brother Brandon we're almost down there that bear better be showing up pretty soon I'm here to tell you Armageddon is just a snatch away we're almost down there that Rapture those Saints better be coming along soon don't doubt it believe what God has done brother Branham said I've never seen it fail and I'm here to tell you tonight I've never seen it fail I've never seen this promise forsaken I've never seen God's family left holding the bag he says a little lower down the hill we almost got into the timber he sat down he was the one that was packing the trophy then I had the rifle and he said that old bear better be showing up hadn't he I said he'll be here don't you worry he said I can see every Hill I said but I see a promise listen friends I know you see the weaknesses you have but would you look at a promise I know you see what's happening in the world I know you see well your children I know you see your home but would you stop seeing that and start seeing a promise [Applause] Hallelujah he promised I said whatever whatever he said bud and I said bud what is that sitting right there he tells it and another telling Bud said to him well it's either somebody's milk cow or the biggest Silver Tip I've ever seen in my life he looked and he said it's a big Silver Tip I said that's him one of these mornings friends I'm going to walk out into my living room I'm gonna go that's him there's going to be brother Brown said you'll turn around one of these days and there'll be mama there'll be Daddy there'll be brother there'll be sister said you'll feel a little a little funny feeling sweep over you like a little pain it'll be the last pain you ever feel in your life at my age you appreciate that the last pain I ever feel he said it's a silver trip that Silver Tip that's him when we got the grizzly he says and remember in the vision I told you I was scared about that rifle it was a little bitty 270 small bullets you see it's on tape and I got to bear just about 500 yards like it's and Bud said you better shoot that bear in the back and and he said did you ever shoot a grizzly bear I said nope he said oh they don't know what death is I he said I learned that a little a little later he says they don't break up from shocks said you better shoot him I said I can't shoot him in the back buddy brother Brandon Bud wanting to hit him in the spine and break his back because he wouldn't die for sure a little 270. no Hunter insane enough to would shoot a silver tip without with nowhere to run and hide with a 270. and he said I mean when I was hog hunting I went me and Matt walked down the road one time we had our I had a crossbow he had a bow and Hogzilla went across the road in front of us and we just Matt and Matt I was afraid to move Amanda said dad to start backing up and stop backing and we started backing up because it sounded like they were coming in around us these things were like trained Warriors and I said I'll never come in here again and next time I come I had my 300 Magnum on this arm my 44 Magnum in in this holster I was gonna kill something and here he is with a 270 gonna shoot a big giant Silver Tip and he said here we go and I and he said according to the vision but according to the vision I shot in the heart he said well if that Vision said so I'm going to stand by you and he meant that literally and he said here we go and I said here we go and we got a little closer and when I raised up the bear saw me that was what he wanted to make a charge and I shot the bear it didn't even seem like it even hurt him here he come and before I could get another bullet in the gun the Bear died about 50 yards from me but was white around the mouth and said brother branna I didn't want him on my lap brother Brown said I didn't either I never wanted the world to get this close I've been firing shots and I never imagined it would get this close I never imagined they would Crown a man as a beauty queen woman I never imagined the world would accept that in wholesale and now it's so Politically Incorrect to even suggest differently I never wanted that for my children I never wanted I never wanted the world to get that close I didn't want it in my lap but that's where it's at I didn't want it for my kids I didn't want it for my grandkids I was certainly sure my kids would never grow up and I was doubly sure my grandkids and here they are growing up into full adults and I find myself all the time on this road of Life put like trying to push the brake pedal through the floor you ever done my teaching a teenager how to drive you know almost you know there's no break there but you're pushing it all the way through the floor and when I see the world and I see what my children what my grandchildren are facing I find myself trying to push the break through the floor yeah I never imagined it would be this close I didn't want it in my lap but I still got a promise and I still got a weapon and I still got a vision hallelujah oh my it feels like he's in our lap at this point and brother Branham and brother Branham said but he said I'm glad that Vision said you got him when I see the sin that my family has to go through I'm glad Paul saw that we made it I'm glad a prophet said I see you all over there Hallelujah I'm glad for some glorious morning I didn't want it in my lap but here it is but I'm still firing and I got a promise it'll go right to the heart of the enemy oh my let me finish here last bit and I said no he said now if them horns are 42 inches I'm gonna have a runaway I'll say it the way he did I'm going to have a screaming fit those are fun I said well you just Minds right have it right now because that's what it's going to be when we got down there to brother Eddie and he said to brother Eddie we tied the horses off and they're scared of a bear see and oh my they had the smell of it and we couldn't skin him out it was too late and they they had to come back the next day and then we we broke up the string about 10 times horses running everywhere and so when we got down there he said went and got the tape measured out of his out of measure out of a saddlebag and said Blaine and I said to brother Eddie I said now watch that little hand there see according accordingly I thought it might have been Billy Paul little bitty hand holding the tape measure wasn't brother bradham's son it was butt son Blaine but 18 at the time brother bisco tells us in detail he's standing there with his checkered shirt on he didn't have it on when they left he's got it on when they come back and he said I was standing there and they were going to measure and he said brother Brandon punched me and said I thought you didn't have a checkered shirt he said Brother Brad I'm the most amazing thing he said I I told my wife to throw it away she must have mended it and stuck it in my bag he said I'm sorry I didn't know and and brother Brandon had I mean brother Ed had felt fallen in water and that's why he had to change the shirt see I mean you're gonna if an angel trips you and pushes you you're gonna fall in water I'm sorry it's probably not even your fault and so brother brother biscal when he tells that story he says and I was watching he he says brother random says here he says now watch that little hand I punched brother Eddie we step back he put it right up like that exact exactly on the nose 42 inches see just exactly Jesus never fails the word will never fail as long as it comes from God and brother Ed tells that story he said I was standing there and he popped me and said I thought you didn't have this shirt and I well I didn't I thought it was gone my wife put it in there and he said and we're standing there and he said as Blaine got down and he said now what happened was you they were trying to put the tape up here at the tip and they would bring the bring it down across the head and go up the other side and before they could get up there this side would pop off and Bud was trying to measure and every time he would start again and get up there and this one would pop off and he said Blaine hold that tape down right there and Blaine drops down because he's walking in a vision and doesn't know it yeah that's you you're walking in a vision you just remember that when you get up tomorrow I don't care what you feel like you're walking in a vision and he and he said and he put his hands down there to hold it and brother Ed said and brother Brown I'm kinda and he said and right when bud got up to that and put it over the tip of that other horn he said everybody standing in the circle kind of went and we looked and he said it was 42 inches exactly he said I'm not here to tell you it was 42 and an eighth or that it was 41 and 7 8. he said I probably wouldn't be standing here tonight he said but it was 42 exactly I'm here to tell you something friends we have a more sure word of Prophecy I hope you believe that tonight I hope you can accept that God has provisioned us with everything that we need you remember that tomorrow will you I don't care what happens I don't care what happens to you with you for you by you you just remember that a vision is unbroken and it's still marching forward Hallelujah God bless you let's stand to our feet amen come musicians praise the lord well I went about a quarter of an hour maybe 15 minutes longer than I

so much to me it meant so much that I could see my life in this testimony lord it's just an animal years ago a caribou and a bear and a prophet and a story but Lord I could see my whole life in it I I could see my own anguish Lord of of everything that we're facing in this world and how I feel about it in my heart and sin heaped up on every side but oh God I take courage tonight father this this very thought Lord that you're still Jehovah Jireh you can provide it Lord you can produce it you can put in me the kind of faith that I'm in need of that I can't seem to summon myself you can bring me to that perfect position you can bring me to a body change Lord you can provide and you will provide Lord there's frankly none of us we'd be honest tonight Lord there's none of us who feel like we could live holy enough to be able to be worthy of a body change Lord I'm sure that there's no one none of your Saints although they were Saints and they went into the ground down through two thousand years I'm sure none of them in their lifestyle qualified for Resurrection but they died in Christ they tied in the faith of their lord and savior and that's where we stand Today We Live they died in that faith we live in that Faith oh God we stand upon it tonight and we believe every word that you gave us that I bring these requests to you Lord we've read them out to you already you know o God

Heart Lord oh precious lamb of God give us that which we have need of tonight encourage our faith increase our faith Lord cause us father to to be able Lord to to to to to take the remainder of this

If I Stumble I'll repent and I'll get up and I'll go again Hallelujah It seems impossible but the promise has already been spoken someday as he said from between here and the camp down the mountain the promise is going to come to pass yep that's what he said somewhere between now I'm standing in a building tonight with your family of Believers somewhere between tonight somewhere between here at a marriage supper the dead in Christ are going to rise and we which our life and remain are going to be changed I thank you for that reality we love you Lord we ask you to touch these needs Lord these

yours is lengthy so I might where you at Chris uh no it's too good I'm gonna let you do it amen this might be the only one we get to how many's got a testimony you want to share tonight one two three oh behind me four okay okay y'all go back to your seats go back to your seats hey it's only 8 37 go back and sit down I want I want you to have these testimonies they're fantastic oh I wish I'd have made you stay up here amen let me start back here who you had one oh Chris had one we got two Chris's tonight I just like I just like testify that uh I started struggling with some sort of back strain and uh I just have back issues I fell out of a tree when I was pretty young and I think it's just been like the Catalyst behind it but basically it'll go out and it'll be really bad well this time it started like a month ago and I just like wake up every morning at the same time about 5 a.m and I would just have the worst pain ever and be right in the center of my back and anyways I would take stuff and stretch and do whatever could hot shower and finally about one o'clock every day it would feel better but then it would repeat and this went on for four almost five weeks came up last uh Sunday Wednesday God prayed for got hands laid on me prayed and within a day maybe a day and a half gone completely problem solved so I just want to be thankful for yeah I saw two hands behind me okay oh Andrew go ahead you got a mic there yeah I just wanted to give this real quick testimony we this not this past Thursday but the Thursday before um I had just gotten to work and I got a text from my wife that said uh Landon's dog Sherlock he's a three-year-old golden retriever had been hit by a car in the road uh kind of out in front of our house down a little ways he had he doesn't go out in front because we had an electric fence there but he had gone through the neighbors a little ways down and had gotten out and uh got hit by a car and a young man had come by and saw him just turning circles and falling over on the side of the road I started knocking on doors trying to find us and eventually they they found that they found us and it was our dog so we took him to the emergency vet and um they charged us a whole lot of money to tell us that uh he had a head injury and uh that he had swelling on his brain and he was completely blind and they weren't sure if he could hear and they wanted to keep him overnight for another five thousand dollars and give him some meds and some fluids and um I said well I asked him well what do you think what about just euthanizing him because you know we don't want him to suffer like that if he's going to be blind he can't hear and they said well it's premature I think for that the vet said because there's a chance once the swelling goes down on his brain you know he may get some function back but we just don't think he'll be you know we're not too hopeful but we we think it's too early to just euthanize him so I said well okay well can you give him the meds let us take him home they said yeah we can do that but you know he might not do well we said okay well at the at the time that it happened when they found out Emily I guess she texts this to Rachel Rachel Watkins yeah and next thing you know we were getting texts from everybody saying they were praying and so um I don't know they activated some kind of phone tree or something but everybody just was texting and saying they were praying and uh and we were praying and so we brought him home and kept him out his head elevated and took him to his vet the next morning and the next morning his his pressure was really high and they wanted us to take him back to the emergency vet hospital having them keep him and we said you know we were like well we can't really afford that we're not going to do that we're just going to keep praying and believing and see what the Lord can do and so they kept him at the vet and gave him fluids all day and then later that afternoon he started improving his pressure came down and we took him home and he basically was he was at meaning that he couldn't stand up straight he couldn't walk he would just go sideways and fall over um for about two days and uh we just kept there and praying and he couldn't get up and down down the steps or having to carry them up and down and but anyway uh he slowly slowly improved and uh in about by four or five days later um he was starting to get get around and he's just kind of walking in circles and then um maybe uh was it maybe Friday or Saturday I know it must have been Sunday for the first time he went after a tennis ball Landon rolled a tennis ball and he went after it and he picked it up off the floor so we were like well he can see something because he picked up the tennis ball and brought it back so um but after that he slowly improved and uh to the point now he's got a little problem with his back foot where he's still limping a little bit but now he's just running around you would almost did not even know that he'd ever had any problem at all he's he's playing ball again and running around in the yard I just wanted to say we just appreciated it so much that God is mindful of even the little things that are important to us so praise the Lord was that the testimony you were going to give yeah yeah Chris this was so good Chris gave me this the other morning sister Debbie and I and uh um I want you to tell it all but try not to go too long amen I'm it's a lot but um and I was almost afraid of what all to share because this is the first time a testimony has a not Justice for myself I guess other people were involved but I I guess I realized and he keeps saying it's good you know I feel like God's in the details so you know those are the parts you mentioned that helped give God glory you know and so um yeah I'll try to be fast so basically in case you all didn't know I was in a bad situation I was living in a motel room for three months and um in this time I became laid off of work and uh so I'm living in a motel and um laid off of work so I'm trying to find a job and it's weird you know it's like it's been really like a growing process I guess and you know and um I've lost like everything and uh through this time and I started coming back to church and stuff it's like I've matured a lot and I just for some reason it seems like you know I just got laid off of work I'm living in a motel but how am I going to afford every day to pay for this motel and it's just like every day I'm trying to like hustle to figure out how to have a roof over my head so um long story short even though it's a long story um so um oh and I was going to say we're not in this maturing process for some reason you know I'm about to be on the street I'm running out of money but for some reason I have like this piece or something it's like um I should have way more urgency and stuff but I'm not like freaking out or anything I'm just calm and I don't know I guess I just feel like whatever I'll just it's gonna happen I guess I don't know it's weird how to explain it but anyway it was like I think it was on a Tuesday and I only had thirty dollars left for my motel room and I couldn't think I was short thirty dollars I could have think I couldn't get a hold of anybody that I have friends with in Beaufort that if I needed to reach out sometimes for some help that they would help me out I couldn't get a hold of any of them so I called a brother in the church um I called George Buckman brother George and he was out of town but he just asked me why I called and I just mentioned you know I was just trying to get thirty dollars I could pay you back tonight well obviously he was out of town but he just suggested you know call Matt or one of the other brothers brother Matt Watkins and anyway um I haven't really spoke to Matt too much since I first started coming back to church so I haven't really talked to him much so anyway I'm like I'm trying to hurry all right so I call Brother Matt and I asked him if I could borrow 30 and he's like yeah you can borrow three dollars and then he's just like what are you doing right now and I was like I'm not working he's like you're not working and I was like no I got laid off and he's like well if you want you come work for me like today so um is that's what happened he picked me up he gave me the thirty dollars so I'd have a room for the night and I worked with him and then the next day I was in the same situation I needed money for the room um I was going to work with Matt and I said Matt is there any way you could help me with the room and he said yes and then I believe if I'm correct that was also I came to church and I put in a prayer request you know just asking for help you know for my situation everything because um you know I don't know what to do honestly and so um that evening um I guess after church I look in my bank account because I have like an app online you can look I had like 25 dollars in my bank account or something and then so later on I look and then I have like I think it was like 98 or 108 dollars I don't know but for some reason I had more money in my bank account than I had before and then so I'm like kind of puzzled but I'm like already thinking well that's wonderful because tomorrow I'm gonna have to pay for this room again and now I have the money magically or something you know so um so um anyway it was either I think it was later on in the evening before I went to bed again I checked my bank again and then I had 300 and something dollars and so uh I was like my money's coming back to me or something I didn't know you know I just it was just to me it was like amazing and so I went to bed and the next morning you know the housekeeper knocks on my door like every morning like clockwork at 9 30. knocked out my door and said they need you to go to the front because you gotta check out and I was like no I'ma stay over and they were like well you need to talk to her because they said you need to go up there so I go up there yeah they're kicking me out of the motel because uh that most I was saying to the super eight and it's like right now they're renovating most of their rooms like Remodeling and Military graduation if I can't beat them to the room I can't book it they put me out so um I'm already making a plan you know they said I can't stay in the room I was like well I can take money from here and out of the bank and take it with my deposit I'll get back and go get a room at another hotel and uh brother Jason gives you a phone call and he's like what are you doing right now and I'm like I'm actually getting ready to check out a motel because they said I can't stay here and I told him the same little story and he's like well why don't you let me pick you up and um I want to like spend some time with you and show you some things or something and like I have a surprise or something like that he said so I was like okay so um I'm going with him and we're like just hanging out running errands you know and um you know I really did enjoy it even though it was like briefly but it's like I got to see more of a like a funner or like a human side of you like that or anything but but it was like you're just like cutting up I didn't mean no disrespect you know but another you weren't behind the pulpit so okay so um we go and I need to try to hurry this up so okay so we're running his errands um we go to Graco and um he's got this propane tank and we go pick up like a garden hose we get the propane tank refilled and um he needs to make some keys copies for some keys and stuff and it was like interesting because um we I think we went out in and out of the store a few times I don't know but I had to go to the truck get the propane tank and stuff and um he start telling the guy about the keys he's like I got these keys to a camper and like I need you know to get them copied and he's going on about a story about you know he didn't want to replace the locks because a lot of people might have keys to those newer locks or I don't know but anyway I was even thinking in my mind it's like it'd be cool if he just like let me hold those keys say a camper that that went in my mind but anyway he gets the keys and stuff and we get everything back into the pickup truck and then we go to Walmart he's got Aaron he's got to run for sister Debbie you have to return something so um on her way to Walmart we're having another conversation and he's talking to me about um trying to help you know he's must try to help get my or my life back on track and uh I've had some problems with my driver's license and stuff and it's um suspended but he's gonna he said he would like to help me he was what really was really struck me about this it's like the whole time I've known you I've known you for a long time that you said it to me like this you're like I love sister Jackie I love you know Mike and I was like y'all are like family that you know my family married into your family but that was the first time I think ever that I've ever heard you kind of consider me as family and not just like a brother in Christ you know so that really meant a lot to me you know and uh so um you said you know I told him what I need to do get to my license situated and he said he would help me with that and I thanked him and he said it'd be his pleasure you know it just made me feel good that because that's another thing through this whole time it's like I've had no family my parents both passed away two years ago and there's nobody here and all my friends basically except for now these friends they all turn their back on me so uh it just meant a lot you know so I'm trying to hurry so then we we leave Walmart and then he wants to make sure these Keys work so we go out to this RV campground or where there's a camper at and uh you know he's making sure the keys work and he said they're great they do work he asked me to put the propane tank in the front of the camper and stuff and he hooks up the garden hose and he goes on a little bit and he says I just want you to know that I've been trying to figure out how to help you you know and it's just so happened I I have this trailer or this camper and he's like um I can afford to let you stay here for one month rent free so you can get back on your feet you know and I just really greatly appreciated that you know because you know we both had conversations and I've had conversations with other people it's very expensive to live in a motel so um but that was my only option and uh so he does this for me so like and that was amazing to me it's like so I don't I think I told Brother Jason but I don't know if he knew from the conversation but the day I got kicked out of the motel was the same day that now I got this camper I can stand and and then after that you know and I thank brother Jason for that and everything and I appreciate it so much and then he said you know he had some work around his house I could do and so I was like it just keeps going and ongoing and going so then he said I could work for him his backyard doing some work around the house like clearing the land or I don't know I don't want to go in a big Spiel but anyway so he gives me labor to do and he pays me you know he paid me cash money to do it and he's told me he's got because we left my moped at the motel and he would take me back after I worked and he said um you know take some of that money and get you some stuff you need from the store before you come to the camper I was like all right so um I go to oh I stop at Food Lion at ladies Island and I'm going around looking for the stuff I need like some paper cups or styrofoam cups and some dish soap and I don't know just some random things that I needed and um I was always being Frugal about everything that through this whole time I'm like trying to be very frugal so um I don't know if people notice it on Frugal but um I go in the checkout line and I probably only had like ten dollars of stuff and this lady behind me she's like um tells the the clerk or whatever you call the person running the cash register just bag up his stuff and Tack it onto mine and um you know and I'll take care of it and I looked at the lady I'm like really and she's like yeah really sometimes I just do that for people I just you know whatever they're getting I just add it to my bill and I pay for it so uh so I looked at her and I was just like you know I thanked River and I was like thank you so much and I was like you're such a blessing you know and I just said God bless you and you know and I didn't even realize I left an impact so um I grab my stuff and go down the road I'll stop at the gas station across a new point on ladies Island asked the sales clerk there for a couple styrofoam cups because I didn't want to buy this giant pack of Styrofoam cups even though it was a good deal but I'm like on a moped so I can't fit a lot of stuff on a moped so anyway they gave me the cups for free and I go back along my way and I go to the camper and um I'm pulling into the campground and right behind me to pulls this car and I noticed it was weird because when I was driving to the campground this car was in front of me at first and it was weird it like pulled over to the shoulder or something on Sam's Point and a car swerved around it so I decided to swerve around it and just be keep going about my way and so um I pull into where the camper is and she pulls in right behind me and she gets out and she's like are you the guy I just saw at the gas or at the Food Lion and I was like yes you know that was me and she's like well we just so happen to be going the same way she's like I'm just going a little bit past where you're at but she's like but you told me I was a blessing to you so I just wanted to do this for you so uh she gets out of her car and she hands me forty dollars and uh you know I thanked her again and everything and um you know I asked her in that conversation I was like what is your name and she said her name was Lynn and I can't remember her last name but she was wearing like a sherwin's Williams like shirt she worked for a painting company or owned a painting company like Connor painting or something and uh after she gave me the money she asked if I was working and I was like I'm working a little bit but I'm kind of in between jobs so she also said that her company does a lot of like uh well painting obviously but like there's like remodels and so forth they could use someone because I said I was a plumber and I can do handyman work and stuff and so she took my phone over and said she would give me a call if she had some work for it for me to do so the woman you know bought my groceries followed me home gave me more money and then offered to give me a job so uh but um but that whole day it was just like so miraculous you know and um and I I said at least you know from that whole experience and it's like I've gone from the very bottom and now I'm starting to come back up and and I just feel like you know because of all this that happened I feel like if nothing else or my experience that I could truly believe that God really loves me and that you know get things worked out you know and I don't know but what I also want to say because I I swear I'll give this I'll give this to somebody else but um just by making myself give that testimony also caught myself in a little white lie so I want to say this brother because I just talked to him last night about a potential job offer and I told him I could drive a van well technically legally I can't so I guess it was a white lie but I'm still professing positively or confessing but I just wanted to say that that you're not be like why do you say that after just saying all this so anyway thank you and God bless you thank you Glory amen praise the Lord praise the Lord let's stand back to our feet it's right at nine o'clock we're going to let you go I'm sure there's more testimonies we're just getting started back on our traditional Wednesday nights and so I'm looking forward to it my God
