brother matt and man he's going to have a few announcements then we're going to jump right back into that anointing amen amen thank you god bless you amen everybody doing good tonight amen how many is ready to have a time in the holy spirit and have a refreshing and a renewal if you have a need just raise it up right now say lord here's what i brought to camp it could be a for it could be for salvation for a re-baptism of the holy spirit could be for healing in the body the mind the soul god does all of it and i want you just to take that hand up raise it up to the lord i want you to hold that kneed up and say lord i'm gonna hold this is my cup this is my need represented right here lord and throughout camp at this moment i'm going to make a declaration to the lord to say lord here's my expectation you're going to meet the need that's represented behind this hand whatever it is and the lord already knows before we before we even ask him he already knows hold that in your heart and just believe and i believe the holy spirit's going to do something special for us this weekend amen i don't know of a time in my life that that i've seen the devil fight something harder than this youth camp he's fought it he's had a a well-tailored specific i mean uh nuclear attack he unlaunched on our church just uh here youth camp was coming up and we've had a few covet cases here and there never really had an outbreak and man just a few weeks before camp this is actually beginning of october one family second family third family fourth family covid kovacova just a massive outbreak we're having to cancel church we have brother jason to mars who goes into the hospital with it there was so much uncertainty surrounding everything and i knew it was just a storm an attack of the enemy trying to shut things down but somebody was praying and there was hearts i believe of you and your needs and your family and your parents who were praying and i believe that those prayers the bible says the the prayers of a righteous man avails much and the holy spirit moved in a supernatural way and the devil who thought he was going to put a stop to something about the time that everybody was out of quarantine and all of our days were over and everybody was recovered and brother jason comes out of the hospital it's camp time now the devil didn't design it that way but god knew what he was doing all along and not one person who was sick and and and feeble that couldn't have come to camp in that condition every single one of them are here tonight you ought to give the lord a handclap of praise for that hallelujah amen glory so i want to let the devil know right now you can try you can do all you want you can throw all the assaults you want but god wins in the end and the devil's a loser somebody say he's a loser he's a loser and he's going to lose we're the winners amen we want to get to the song service we have a lot amen here tonight we want to get to uh but i want to just make some reading announcements i got to just go over some of these before we begin a lot of these you heard some of the counselors heard some of this you got through way of email and and and different forms but so if these are repeated just make sure you listen up because these are real close this will be our camp orientation none of y'all have been here before and we've only been here a few times we took a few trips here scouting trips so uh i got in the golf cart to take a couple people uh today and i said where are you going and they said i'm at such and such and they and i said do you know how to get there and they said no i said neither do i so we're in trouble i had to pull out the map and then find out how to get there but we made our way so uh the property uh is is vast it's large lots of lots of it covers a lot of acres um so we we have some specifics and some things some guidelines we want you to follow while you're here at camp to make sure everybody has a good time there is weather better weather predicted for tomorrow so we know the master of the wind and we're going to pray how many will pray say lord give us good weather throughout camp supposed to turn around and get a little bit better in the morning and fortunately we're going to have a little bit of sunshine i'm not really sure so everything that we have on the schedule announced is going to be barring the weather and then we'll go as we as we can and play it by ear play other things by ear so i'm going to read through some of these um as we said in the emails campers aren't allowed to leave camp so once you're here you park your car unless there's an emergency you can't leave you've got to stay here and there's a gate that locks at night so we want to make sure that you're here there's also a buddy system that they've put in place that we want you to follow i'm going to get to that here in just a moment and at lights out um security will be making rounds the security team will make around to each dorm it lights out just to make sure uh everything's okay lights out will be will be given to you now if you signed up and opted in for the mass text that's one of our best ways of communication to get something to you fast lights out will be announced on that group text it'll be announced other ways your counselor get it and make sure that you know but lights out time is where is the time that we put on there i think was 11 30 is what's on the schedule depending on what the lord does in services depending on what will happen after that may change um it's not going to get any earlier don't worry but that may change um depending on service so you're going to want to watch out for that announcement that we give you concerning the lights out time and we'll give that out as i said based upon things and give you some heads up i want to say this because i didn't see this on here maybe it is on here and i'll get to it the canteen store which has drinks and snacks and souvenirs and all kinds of merch that you can get for yourself will be open tonight and we've told them nine o'clock that's just a rough random time don't know what time we'll actually get out i'll give the guy a heads up here so the camp store will be open tonight for drinks and snacks only please don't buy any merchandise or any souvenirs because it's just going to be open for 45 minutes so when i give them the time you have 45 minutes if you want something to get over there and get get a snack or a drink or whatever you want there so that'll be also open every day during activity time so during activity time you want to go to the camp canteen store get whatever you want snacks drinks merch uh you can purchase it then there's a five dollar minimum purchase for a debit card also medical situations anything that comes up medically you want to go to the front office during the day and report that any kind of medical needs that raise up that's for kids counselors both um so this is our our disciplinary action rules i'm going to tell you how they work three strikes y'all can finish it for me that's right three strikes say it again three strikes so we're gonna we're gonna give you one uh as a warning this is this is this will be coming from the uh the head of security here brother tony who's also our worship leader he's nice when he leads worship but he's real mean at security so be careful [Laughter] so there's three strikes and you're out first uh first offense is a warning second offense we'll call your parents um and third offense and arrangements will be made for you to take the bus home so walking the trails this is the buddy buddy system we talked about there's a lot of trails over here and there's two waterfall trails a lot of places you can cover we want to make sure let me just make sure i get this right here that you use a buddy system so you got to have somebody you want to have somebody with you don't go alone and if you're going to go uh there's no boy and girl pairing in any any areas that aren't public or you know where other adults are you can if there's a boy and a girl in a public area that's fine but any of those trails are anywhere off of the path you want to make sure that there's no boy girl pairings meaning boy and girl now if you're a group and there's guys and girls that's totally fine as long as there's more than two everybody understand that uh no boy and girl parents so you want to there is there was a request what if it's my brother what if it's my sister we at first said yes we're taking that back um because the image no one might would know that that was your brother or sister then you get reported uh and then you might have to get excommunicated from camp no i'm just kidding but um we might have to clarify that so remember that buddy system go with somebody guy and and just if you're going to be in a group there that's completely fine the activities for tomorrow after tomorrow morning's service uh and and and so this will this will remember we'll we're gonna get some of these out through the mass texting app as of right now we won't have the second morning service we announced it for

[Music] see [Music] [Music] praise the lord uh we meet at last hallelujah we have uh worked so hard to get here and to to actually see it happening is almost surreal to me it's almost like you're a vision am i having a vision y'all really out there it's so wonderful tonight to see you all have you here and to see the camp uh so full like this on the very first year and don't worry about the rain now don't worry about it we got my daddy used to say don't worry with us run up the road and turn the gate back so uh we're gonna do that and we'll get you some clear weather in here maybe tomorrow but saturday and sunday should look pretty good uh we're just trusting the lord for his mercy you know there's a big weather anomaly that's all in the news and there i forget the exact term they're calling it but it's um something like this giant river in the sky and it's it's coming all the way across the country and they said it is so large that it's a river flowing right above you and that it's moving something like 10 trillion gallons of water and you say that's a lot that's actually more water movement than the mighty mississippi 25 times more so i just say lord surely there's a spiritual river up there surely there's a spiritual remember that 25 times more mighty amen how many would like to have that rain poured out on you tonight amen say let it rain lord let it rain open the floodgates of heaven amen i should have had anthony sing that song praise the lord we might sing it before we get going from here tonight i want to just uh take a few minutes uh before we uh open the word of god i wasn't it's a surprise to uh everybody in my church except for a few people that i'm preaching tonight and that was uh not not in the original plan well it wasn't in our original plan it must have been in his original plan and uh brother diggs we'd have had him up i think tonight but uh he couldn't can't get here till tomorrow and so um i started to make a couple phone calls but then i just decided something felt urging in me just go ahead and take it so uh i love preaching to young people amen it thrills me it inspires me to see your happy faces believers my uh you know what i just say to the world i say to satan you ain't got all of them satan amen the lord has reserved some who have not bowed the knee to bail in this wicked laodicean age [Music] amen this camp uh is really from our heart to yours um it's it's and really myself it's it's a thought i've had in my mind for a long time but it just took the right team of people to put it together and i i can't say enough for the team that we have here assembled and my son matthew and brother jason demars and mine i heard matt telling you how the devil attacked us oh my goodness that's just one piece of it he has just fought it and fought it and fought it but he can't win i tell him all the time satan you ain't nobody i don't live by your mercies i don't live by the mercies of lucifer i live by the mercies of christ satan don't make any decisions for me my father makes those decisions amen you say well he's a he's an adversary yeah he is but my big brother whoops him every time amen and so we just are grateful tonight for all of the volunteer staff that's here and some that go right to our assembly in beaufort and some we imported a few helpers amen happy to have them here tonight and all of you from near and far we have one real goal and that is to see you come closer to jesus christ there is nothing that we could do for you more than to facilitate that opportunity amen now it's just an opportunity it's up to you to take it it's up to you to own it take it and and own it and say i am getting mine if nobody else gets theirs i'll get mine and there's two amen so i believe that you're lovers of the word am i right i believe you'll pull on the word is that right amen praise the lord and we're we did have a stream rolling i was uh checking it out as i was driving here and different ones are watching back home back in beaufort and all different places i've had people say they're going to be streaming from near and far so we're happy to have them tonight and happy to have all of you i just want to say that that um you know if you if you if you need uh information and you know if you if you get in trouble and you need somebody to help you and you say i'm going to run to brother jason i'm in trouble i'm going to run to brother jason he's a merciful man and you know let me let me describe to you what the reality is you remember in the ten commandments when somebody did something wrong and they were gonna whip them and they ran to moses and said run to moses prince moses and they ran in there you ever seen that and the woman fell down mercy moses mercy you remember that story in the bible it ain't nothing like that if you get in trouble you have to deal with brother matt brother jd our deacons don't run to brother jason for mercy because i am not making any decisions here it really is i wasn't even i'm actually on security patrol you'll see me i'm actually working for brother anthony uh this whole camp and i wasn't supposed to be preaching but i i'm glad i am amen and so uh if you get in trouble i'll probably be the one get you in trouble so [Music] amen praise the lord you'll go from here saying brother jason don't play we want you to have a good time we want this to be a a time of spiritual enrichment amen amen i'm going to invite you into the scriptures this evening to the book of second chronicles chapter 32. i i particularly love the book of chronicles ezra penned it and he gives a lot more detail to things than samuel did in the books of the kings samuel wrote first and second kings ezra was a scribe who penned first and second chronicles and we get a whole lot of detail that samuel left out on some really big things i'm glad the lord has a way of getting everything we need in the bible amen second chronicles i want to speak to you by the help of the lord this evening on a simple title a greater you than you amen second chronicles 32 we'll read verses one through eight and then we'll uh we'll read one through eight and then we'll catch drop down in catch 20-22 after these things and the establishment thereof synocrib king of assyria came and entered into judah and encamped against the fenced cities and thought to win them for himself and when hezekiah saw that cinecrib was come and that he was purposed to fight against jerusalem he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city and they did help him so there was gathered much people together who stopped all the fountains and the brook that ran through the midst of the land saying why should the kings of syria come and find much water also he strengthened himself and built up all the wall that was broken and raised it up to the towers now it's this is all really good productive stuff but there's a little bit of sadness in my mind as i read it i'm thinking you know hezekiah why did you need to quickly go and rebuild everything just because the enemy was approaching you know why why do we wait until we're in a trial to pray why why is it that we hold back and then and then we dial nine the heavenly 9-1-1 and we end up treating god like a vending machine or santa claus which he's neither see so he's looking for more of a relationship with you than that and he goes on to say and he raised up to the towers and another wall without and repaired milo in the city of david and made darts and shields in abundance and he set captains of war over the people and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city and spoke comfortably to them saying be strong and courageous be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of assyria let me read verse 7 again be strong and courageous be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of assyria nor for all the multitude that is with him for there be more with us than with him now considering that he had the syrian army was nearly a quarter of a million strong this isn't a numerics about humans that that hezekiah is referring to but how many know that little as much if god is in it how many know that you and jesus constitute a majority see and so he says there be more with us than with him with him now here's why with him is an arm of flesh but with us is the lord our god to help us and to fight our battles and the people rested themselves upon the words of hezekiah king of judah there's nothing to bring peace like the promise of the word you got a trouble tonight let me give you some promises of the word verse 20 and for this cause hezekiah the king and the prophet isaiah the son of amos prayed and cried to heaven and the lord sent an angel which cut off all the mighty men of valor and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of assyria so he returned with shame of faith to his own land and when he was come into the house of his god they that came forth of his own bowels these his own sons slew him there with the sword thus the lord saved hezekiah and the inhabitants of jerusalem from the hand of synacrib the king of assyria and from the hand of all other and guided them on every side father we thank you for your word this evening i pray master that you will come and anoint your word mightily lord i just want to stand here and just be your servant just want to be a eunuch lord not to take my own thought lord i i had many other thoughts father that i thought that i would take tonight but i found myself lord as i just began to look over and follow the leadership of the lord i found myself here in second chronicles i believe it's you i believe there are needs that will be met here tonight lord they're not just they didn't just come with needs they're going to leave with needs met father and i committed you in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated nope all right just getting used to okay this how many know that god purposed you before the foundation of the world how many knows that that before there was ever stardust the word of god existed and you existed in that word that is why you're here tonight this is why you're a believer this is exactly why the word has its predestinated effect on you and it not only affects you but it effects change in your life because it doesn't do any good to just be affected by the word you want to for the word to effect a change in your life that's why you're a christian because i'm here to tell you something friends uh i i get it that sometimes the battles can get really hot and heavy and even at even at your young age there's many of you already have surmounted tremendous uh obstacles in your life and many of you tonight could testify and say brother i had this crisis in my life or that crisis and i'd say my you're so young but the devil is no he doesn't wait till somebody gets some age on him he starts early he starts trying to derail you he comes into your childhood tries to invade your home you ought to be thankful for godly parents and pastors a man and family who will pray for you and apply a token to a home you don't you won't know until the other side how many times the angels interdicted on a move the enemy had planned for your life you got up on any morning like every other morning you got ready for school or a job or wherever you were going you're headed to the market or you're headed to see a friend or you're headed on a vacation and there were there were demon forces conspiring in a realm you couldn't see but also in that same realm there were angels moving on your behalf and you will be surprised on the other side to learn just how many times they stepped in to thwart the enemy for you we find that everything that god does is purposed and you know that he's he's not a purposeless god jesus even said of the word of god that there's not even a word of it'll pass away that actually that that that god values his word above his name and we find that not even a jot or a tittle not one iota i mean that's you're getting down to punctuations and and even smaller than punctuations and there's not nothing in the bible that is a contradiction it's written by men over hundreds and hundreds of years all from one central mind that saw me and saw you before the world existed god has a vision of you god has been moving your entire life whether you you say well i you know i'm actually just here tonight because a friend brought me i'm not even i'm not even born again i'm here to tell you something friends if there's anything in you to respond to the word of god you existed in the mind of god and god had a plan god had a plan before you didn't know you would want it god had a plan before you decided you didn't want it i'm here to tell you that if god is determined to do something you're not going to stop him and if he is determined to track you down i'm here to tell you he will send the fisherman and he if that angler can't catch you he'll send another fisherman and if that one can't catch you he'll put a change of lure and use another fisherman but understand finally if a fisherman can't get you he will send the hunter a hunter don't miss the holy ghost gets his man or his woman he's not he's not going to let the enemy take one of his offspring from his possession my advice to you tonight would be surrender my advice to you tonight now is just throw up your hands and say lord i surrender right now i remember somebody said one time that a preacher and a lawyer had went to church and they were both as world as could be in their buddies and my goodness the sermon got going and they both fell under conviction and they hit the old sawdust trail and they fell at the altar and my goodness that doctor he rolled around and he screamed out four or five minutes and jumped to his feet and thrust both hands in the air and said i'm free i'm free and that lawyer just you know he looked at that he went back to praying and he prayed for an hour and two hours and they beat him on the back and they they they caught on the name of the lord and finally after about three hours of rolling around in the sawdust he jumped to his feet under the power of god he said i'm free hallelujah they're walking home and the the lawyer says the doctor says hey bud i'll ask you a question sure sure but go ahead what is it he said isn't god good oh yeah he's good good old time oh all the time said i'm so glad he what he did for us tonight yes isn't it wonderful he said doc he said this is one thing i don't understand he said what is it pal he said you know he said when you got down in five minutes you jumped up full of the spirit of god he said for me i had to stay down there two or three hours and he said i don't understand that and the doctor laughed and he said oh that's easy he said that's just because i'm a doctor and you're a lawyer and he said well what's that got to do with and he said well when you got down there you started pleading your case i just told him i'm guilty don't plead your case friends just raise up the hand and say i'm guilty lord and i need your help 6 000 years of the histories of mankind has made it difficult if if not impossible for him to accept or really even even perceive that the word truly um you know is in control of everything that the word of god is controlling everything now i i could take a whole sermon which i love doing and and correlating history to prophecy because you can see that all of the pro all of the history that's ever been was controlled by prophecy the the current day you're living in is being controlled by prophecy don't ever let anyone tell you that politics are controlling it or the white house or the vatican or the kremlin they're not in control of anything they're puppets prophecy is controlling the world and it's hard for man to perceive that the world after 6 000 years of his histories is truly coming to a major upheaval of everything he has understood since the fall in the garden since that faithful day six thousand years ago mankind has basically had to make his own way in the world through trial and error through successes and failures through ups and downs and sometimes just dumb luck or not for fallen man to be able to grasp and to be able to come to terms with the fact that the whole thing the whole thing all the histories all the events of history have been a grand production that is being accomplished by god to fulfill his purposes and his goals time itself is a creation of god set in motion to achieve an eternal purpose think of the irony of that god set time in motion to achieve an eternal purpose moreover for him for fallen man to now realize the fact that the purposes of god are being finished up right here in the day and hour in real time this is happening in real time this isn't a joke this is serious the world is like a garment that's waxed old and it's ready for renewal they can cry all they want to and i'm not here to argue the science of the politics it's all of the devil anyway but i i know what's going on if the world's got a global warming and the world's got all kinds of trouble i know exactly what it is it's the earth knows it's about the transition and the earth is already going ahead and making changes [Applause] say myer polar caps are melting you ain't seen nothing yet honey they're going away completely even the deserts are going to blossom like a rose hallelujah oh i'm to tell you something friends our retirement plan is out of this world the world as he has known it has fallen mankind humanity the world as humanity has known it is approaching its end game there are in fact even as we speak tonight catastrophic judgments that are rushing to meet us and i'm here to tell you the only way out is up hear me again tonight friends there are catastrophic judgments rushing to meet this world and the only way out is up i want to go up hallelujah the principle is that whatever is not eternal must pass away however long it may have survived now by all human odds and i get it i get why it's a struggle for a fallen man to get his mind wrapped around what we're saying tonight by all human odds it should continue just as it always has just as it always does but against but odds against a principle are no match i don't care what the odds are the principles of god's word will prevail you should just take that and and speak peace into your own life tonight i don't care what the odds look might be stacked against you but if your life is based on the principles of god's word you have to win you can't lose see satan could actually win if he wasn't if it wasn't for always losing he could actually win but he can't win for losing and so we find that this 6 000 year epic drama has been and i say this unapologetically unequivocally it has been perfectly not partially it has been perfectly controlled it has been perfectly purpose-driven by the only source of eternal existence and life itself and that is god that's it there's no other answer god is in control of everything he's not only the god of good men he's the god of all men he's not only the god of the good he he he puts rings in the nose of of emperors and kings and leads them to his will i'm here to tell you something friends you don't have to you don't have to abide in the spirit of fear that's on this age you've been given a different spirit you've been given an ability to receive the word of god and receive the life that comes out of that world god alone man's six thousand year reign in a fallen condition is now fulfilling its final purpose and it's time to move on there is i think when we look at our text in second chronicles where i believe that any of us as believers would believe tonight that there is an incomparable difference really in trusting in the in the lord versus trusting in the arm of flesh they're so far apart they're not even comparable i would love to use one as a contrast but they're just too far apart when you are going to trust the lord you that is a mutually exclusive term you're not trusting the lord and trusting the arm of flesh at the same time perfect faith and perfect fear are mutually exclusive terms they can't both be true at the same time in a believer we have come to the age of perfect faith in a time of perfect fear and it's gripping the world but god has given you something better god has given you a peace and a faith and a belief that that god is in control of it all the king of assyria found this out the hard way this fallen world offers many challenges many challenges would you agree many trials many afflictions jesus never promised us it would be easy only that it would be worth it i want to tell you something today young man young woman it will be worth it oh will it be worth it job would make the comment and say that a man born of a woman he's just a few days and he's full of trouble and you know why i think it's a fair question why is trusting in the lord such an advantage over the arm of flesh and and there are many things that i could say on that tonight i just want to angle into one particular side of this mountain that be all right what is trusting in the lord why is it such an advantage over the arm of flesh because for one thing flesh looks forward trying hard to bring things to pass but those who put their trust in the lord know that the lord has accomplished it already so you can take the arm of flesh and you can try to make a life out of this out of this few days and full of trouble good luck with that i'll put my trust in the lord who has already sealed every divine promise it's already accomplished for me anything you will ever need from the cradle to the grave i got a message for you it's already done everything brother branham would say everything that you have need of for a rapture is in you now not coming it's now whether you're born again or not if a gene of god is in there for a new birth that's in you now you don't come to an altar and become a son or daughter of god you find out you always were and now by the baptism of the holy ghost you're able you're now free to cooperate in the vision that god had a view god had a vision of you bible says that that even when jesus was suffering on the cross he would see a seed and be satisfied everything you have need of god has done it already you know i saw an interesting interview they interviewed a nasa engineer quite a number of them when they were making the mars rover and they had a very wonderful celebration because they successfully landed the rover on mars and it's operational and sending back pictures and they've even got a little drone that they had to build specially has to be computer driven nobody can the atmosphere's so light and and and there were so many so many possibilities for it to go wrong it was quite a feat of human engineering ingenuity and engineering and this nasa engineer when he's being interviewed he he starts talking they say you know where were you nervous and he says that's that's that's an understatement he said that this is the culmination of years of years more than a decade of the greatest minds gathering over year after year after year after year for a landing that's going to be over in about a minute and all of this effort has been poured into that when that thing comes down the retro rockets will fire the separation will happen the parachute will deploy the feet will come down and everything will happen synchronously and it'll have a touchdown and it won't break and it'll be operational and everything will work and this is years and years of our lives invested in a few terrifying minutes and that thing's falling i i forget how many hundred miles an hour toward mars and he actually as he as he was telling the story he was literally sweating telling it and the interviewer even even said to him said you're sweating now just telling the story and he grabbed the handkerchief he goes you're right man i'm reliving it all over again because he he had to sweat it out and and he said he said because you you've got to realize he said at some point he said and i don't remember exactly why but he said communication goes dark and we're in the dark we know nothing all we know is we're we're descending and that's it and and it doesn't come back around and we don't get a video feed and we don't know what happened until the rotation comes around and the video feed hits the earth again it takes minutes to get here and when it comes on the screen we will know if we have disaster or if we have triumphed and they had triumphed when it came back on you should have seen my goodness i didn't know scientists could jump like that and they were screaming and hollering and running all over the place and hugging one another and crying and and and he said he said listen he said you don't realize the agony because that knowing whatever was going to happen had already happened and we're sitting there and there's i mean we're anxious but what's the point because at this point whatever has happened has already happened and and we find out that he he could only wait for the outcome to declare itself when the video feed made it back to the earth over many many agonizing minutes i want you to think through this with me he could wait in hope but wishing wouldn't make it so he could have some measure of human faith i mean i'll give him that based on meticulous preparation and engineering that it went into the whole thing but but these would be very little comfort while he waited it out while he sweated it out there was no if you think about it friends there was no peace even possible until he could see physically see the mystery revealed there's no way see he couldn't have he actually had to wait to get peace he had to wait to see it while he can't see it he's in agony while he can't see it he knows whatever's happened has already happened and it's just going to be what it's going to be and when the screen comes on either we've succeeded or we failed and that's it there's nothing i can do i can hope upon a star wish upon a star count my lucky stars but wishing isn't going to change anything and even the faith i've got is only a little bit of human faith based on all the work that we put in it all of his human hope and all of his human faith were made moot by the reality of what already existed he could only wait anxiously to see what the unalterable outcome would turn out to be all that could be done to help the situation had already been done during the time of construction and programming this i want to say to you tonight friends this when you're leaning on the arm of flesh this is the best life can offer you when you lean on the arm of flesh all you can do is give it your old notre dame try and hope for the best but i'm here to tell you there's a better way there's a better way than the arm of flesh i feel sorry for mankind who won't trust god i feel sorry for mankind who leans on the arm of flesh i feel sorry for them and that's why the bible says in this last day men's heart would fail for fear now you know when i know there is no greater fear for a human than the fear of the unknown that's why you won't go in a dark room without turning light on that's why you're walking in a dark alley you hear a sound you're creeped out why because you don't know what it is i can't see oh what a way that's that and and that is the greatest fear and man's heart is failing for fear of the unknown and here we are tonight with the open book and the full mind of god revealed you are such a privileged people you're so privileged my brother my sister don't take what god has done in this hour lightly hallelujah this is the best life can offer you when you lean on the arm of flesh but my eyes see a different reality i'm looking to a preparation from back in the eternities i'm looking for something that happened before creation was created hallelujah all the construction and labor on my behalf that happened before i got here but before anything got here before anything got here listen friend before stardust got here before stardust got here god had a purpose for my life so i i've had all kinds of failures yeah but i was purpose before i got here to fail hallelujah one of these days friends you're going to realize that nothing trumps that gene of god in you you're going to realize that there is now therefore no condemnation to them which are in christ you're going to take your failures and you're going to throw them back at the devil and you're going to say it don't matter it don't matter you don't matter satan i am a believer in the word of god i have given my heart and my life to christ it's not a hope or a faith that it will happen or neither is it a doubt that it won't happen hope has no voice in this that's why brother brandon would say hope is the worst enemy faith has see and so hope has no voice in this i'm looking at a promise that what he said he'd do he's already done it so how do you know because an open book is calling my name oh and i'm here to tell you something it seems to be a name it already knew hallelujah calling you calling me i know it called me because i hear the gospel trumpet draws me to this feast of the word i'm going to tell you something friends this is beyond me this is beyond a decision this is beyond me or you choosing this is someone that's already chosen me when the eagle flies over that gene brother branham said and eat when that eagle when that light flashes on that seed he said it'll come to life just as sure as anything i'm here to tell you something friends i found out that that there's a there's another being living inside me there's a better me than me i'm here to tell you tonight there's a you have access to a better you than you hallelujah there's there's an alien force inside me and it and it echoes from within me it it doesn't decide to believe god's word it echoes amen amen amen there's no decision there's no hope i'm not wondering i'm not trying to figure it out there's an alien voice inside me that says any man to every word of god how did it all happen brother jason all i know is that somewhere in the eternities morning stars sang together and sons of god shouted for joy and i was part of that group say how do you know because now that i hear the word i got the same shout for joy that they had when they heard the word they stood there and heard the word of god and they shouted for joy we know that the bible talks about a great falling away at the end time now i wanna dig a little deeper you good i want i want to i want to change my angle and dive a little deeper all right so when we think about the falling away that is to come at the end time we find too often times that what we are faced with and i know this authoritatively because i was raised in this message born into it my parents uh were in the meetings of brother branham i was a baby sitting there i was prayed for him healed of an incurable blood disease by proxy my dad's standing in a prayer line and me hundreds of miles away and the very instant it was pronounced that instant i was healed see so the time continuum isn't exactly what you think it is miles meant nothing when when god spoke to a prophet but we find too often a retreating from the ancient landmarks of the word now don't get quiet on me because i'm here to tell you brother jason i've seen this i've seen it from a boy growing up i've seen the old ways began to be uh drifted away from and you say oh is that but wait a minute the great falling aways that's happening in the world yeah that's fine what has that got to do with you and me i'm talking to you and me tonight i'm talking to sons and daughters of god i'm talking to believers and i'm here to tell you something that there's been a retreating from the ancient landmarks of the word and as a minister i want to i feel sometimes i want to say get back in step get back in line this is no time to be retreating from the ancient landmarks this is no time to water down the gospel with its transforming power if you want the transforming power of the gospel you take it like it is you take it straight you don't mix it you don't water it down you don't reconnect take it straight hallelujah too much diminishing a diminishing appreciation for the power of god bringing many sons to glory i'm here to declare that his word is unchanging i'm here as his officer tonight to make a declaration his word is unchanging it's just as powerful today as it ever was it still saves it still fills with the spirit of god it can still clean up your life it can still make the devil run from you [Applause] hallelujah it's unchanging there is still power in the blood there is still a holy ghost experience to be had and i'm not going to stand by and let preachers water that idea down as if you just make some mental decision or you're raising a message family or raising a message church nothing that when we leave here my church is going to burn under nuclear fire but it won't have anyone in there when it happens that's why i preach i'm not trying to get my building in a rapture i'm not trying to get my ipad in a rapture i'm trying to get you and me in a rapture hallelujah i'd like to just break into that tonight on the very first night how many would say well let's just break right into it tonight hallelujah that way when brother burley comes or brother john comes they don't have to drop back and hit these kind of things because we're already filled with the spirit of god we already got a church full of believers how many believers we've got in here tonight hallelujah satan knows he's very much aware that there are no contradictions in the scripture but it's not the scripture he fears brother branham holding up his own bible declared this is not the gospel the bible living in you that's what the holy ghost was given for it didn't come to increase your theology to give you better understanding over the baptist and methodists you do have better theology than them but that's not the point the point is that this thing is to become a living reality living behind mortal people living with all of our wrinkles and warts and ups and downs and weaknesses say you got them i got them you got them you got them we all got them we're all in this thing together hallelujah but i'm here to tell you we've got a heavenly father that knows who knows our weaknesses and knows how we're made knows and watched us in our molding and i'm here to tell you i don't care what you think about how you got here or what it is that's made up your life i want to go back and remind you that every step of a son and daughter of god whether it's before they be became born again or after is ordered of the lord and god is in control of your life say but i made all kinds of decisions and he let you because now he can redeem you and i'm going to tell you something a child of god who has come out of sin is a very valuable instrument in the hands of god satan knows there are no contradictions in the scripture so he moves to the spot where the connection is that transmits the written word or the spoken word into your heart and that's the mind and brother branham said that's the battleground that god and satan chose the mind of man because it's got to come here first and that's where satan is going to attack you with reasoning this is where satan is going to use your your five flesh body senses your your eyesight your ears your taste the things you put your hand to and he's going to use that as inlets to get to your memory and your reasoning your conscience your affection your imagination which are all in a fallen condition they're all in a falling condition none of them are none of those 10 are converted there's only one area of conversion and that's in the soul and that brother ram said that only has one sense either faith or doubt either you're born again or you're not you're not halfway born again there's no such thing you're either born of the spirit of god or you're not i understand growth and maturity but you're either born of the spirit of god or you're not and don't fool yourself thinking you are the devil would love to have you thinking you are when you're not and when you actually are born again he would love to make you think you're not born again he's a master of psychology don't don't fight him there and don't don't give i'm here to tell you something friends if you want the if you want a secret to the supernatural is keep your mind clear of laodicea's influence keep your mind stayed on the word of god feed on the word of god stop feeding on laodicea stop stop indulging in those things they're poison they're toxins and what he does is he comes to your mind because he knows there's no contradictions in the written bible so what he does is he comes to the spot where the connection is that leads from the written word to the living word and it's then lived behind human skin and he's not trying to make the bible a contradiction he's trying to make you a contradiction he's trying to fill your life with contradiction he's trying to give you the fashions of the world he's trying to give you all the popularity he's trying to get you to be one of the cool kids i'm here to tell you uh those kind of kids are gonna end up in a tribulation period i want to i don't want to be one of them i want to be the one who goes into glory with god [Applause] but understand how crafty he is he uses the things you listen to the things you gaze at because he knows the principle of the word better than you do he knows that we're tr changed into the things we gaze at that's that's a principle remember odds against the principle are no match say well i've been a believer all my life and odds are i'll stay i'll stay victorious not if you start violating the principles of god you want see so he's trying to create a contradiction between the word written in the bible and the word that's manifested in your life you know if you think about what a contradiction this age that we live in this is the age of of the selfie and uh of youtube and and and that that iconic phrase do you wow just do you no i'm not i'm not here preaching at selfies and youtube and and and slogans that's not even what i'm i'm talking about uh but what i what i'm i'm trying to get you to see the work of the enemy when you think about selfies when you think about youtube when you think about do you i mean how opposite is that to the path that christ took he made of himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross so i want to i want to make you aware of something i want to make you aware of this angle that the falling away at the end time is far more than just some people moving away from or abandoning truth in doctrine falling away at the end time is anything that moves you away from christ being first in every aspect of your life if he's not first in every aspect of your life you've already experienced a falling away though you might still be perfectly convinced of the teachings see it's not just about abandoning doctrine when he's not your highest thought and goal when he's not the center of everything you do you have fallen away so quite naturally quite naturally then the age of youtube and selfie and do you would would naturally be the opposite it would be the antithesis of having him first in your life it's real simple it's not complicated many people you know we'll we'll say to me tonight brother jason you know that's that's not my motive in watching youtube that's not my motive when i took a selfie that's not my motive when i said to my friend hey do you have a good time go have fun that wasn't my motive and and you know what i want to say friends that that that's fine i'm not indicting you this is about the spirit that's on the age and the motive and objective for satan of satan for your life it might not be your motive but i'm here to promise you it's his motive it's his motive to corrupt you it's his motive to poison you and and and we when we think about it in the simplest terms i can just ask you tonight just just think with me just answer this to yourself i don't need anybody to raise their hand or stand up or say yeah it's me i don't need you to say amen i just want you to think about a question go down your life your everyday walking talking life your everyday 24-hour life and just ask yourself one simple question is christ and his word first in every facet of my current life if you can identify any area of your life that he is not then that is a portion that you have allowed the god of this evil age to find a way into you and he's keeping you from being a better you god has a plan to make a better you than you and satan has just the opposite plan in mind it may not be as i said whether you're aware of it or not it might not be your motive it might not be your objective but it certainly is his objective and he's found room in you to work now you sit there young people listen think about that now i want you to really take measure of that in every one of you individually i'm looking at you right in the eye take measure of that is there anywhere in your life think now that you would have to be honest and say lord the truth is you're not first you're second but brother branham said he don't want second he don't want to be second he wants to be first i want him to be first remember friends that satan brother man taught us satan is almost powerless unless he can find somebody to work through so if he's working through you maybe in some unrecognized way then then just a then let me ask you now let me ask you a question what kind of damage might you be doing to those associated around you people you care about people you love because you have allowed the enemy to come and creep in and take some oh i go to church oh i go multiple times a week i read my bible but i ask you was there any area i'm here to tell you something friends jesus paid a price that makes him worthy to be first in every aspect of your life that's what the holy ghost is given for that's why and you know i want to say this the holy ghost and and my i have just it's uh it's such a burden on my heart over the years where i've seen the baptism of the holy ghost preached in such a way and and presented in such a way that made young people almost give up hope it's so hard to get it's not hard to get at all it's not hard to get at all it's your promise if you believe the word and surrender the the struggle is not receiving the holy ghost the struggle is in surrender the struggle is in surrender you just remember that you don't got to wait 10 days you don't got to wait 10 minutes you don't even got to come to an altar you don't got to jump up and down you don't got to do anything you might do all of that when the holy ghost comes on you i believe in something that's alive hallelujah but i'm here to tell you the holy ghost is not hard to get all it takes is a surrender want to say tonight lord god i want to surrender i want to have a fresh surrender in my life i don't want to wait till the third night or the fourth night or the last service i want to surrender right now hallelujah god will confirm a life in a ministry that believes his word i'm here to tell you something friends you don't have to back up from a devil you do not have to back up from a devil it's not your battle it's his this is exactly what hezekiah knew hezekiah promised those people what he was promising them was promises of jehovah jehovah said i'll be with you and i'll fight your battles and hezekiah said the lord is with us and he'll fight our battle i'm here to tell you as a minister of the gospel i'm never afraid to promise you anything that i know god has promised you in his word but you've got to believe it you've got to accept it i can't make you believe it but i'm a witness friends i'm a witness that god keeps his word i'm a witness all over the world i've been i've been i've preached this this message on six of seven continents and i've seen god keep his word i've seen the blinded eyes open i've seen epileptic demons cast off of children before not with thunder and lightning just a prayer just a prayer i was in moscow russia one time and just years ago and uh an old woman come up here in the prayer line very aged almost 90 and she was blind in one eye completely blind and we just we just offered prayer i'm here to tell you something friends when you're when you consecrate yourself before god and when you're serious about god and his word god will confirm his word through your prayers you'll lay your hands on the sick and they shall recover and we didn't jump up and down and i didn't need thunder to crack i didn't see any flashes of lightning we just prayed a prayer and condemned the enemy and we were coming back the next day brother barely and i'm walking up the steps into this ginormous auditorium there in moscow russia and all the sudden i hear a bunch of commotions of my screaming running and i look and i held this old lady at 90 and her size she was kind of healthy and she was running i know people didn't rant since she was 25 and she's running over jibbering in russian and and she's doing this and doing this and doing this and i knew right away god had healed her and the translator said she was in her bed that night and while she was laying in the bed a light come into the room and went inside her eye and came back out and she could see i'm here to tell you that's the power that the holy ghost has this thing's real we don't back down from devils we're not afraid of a devil hallelujah we know what the word has promised and we stand on it with confidence they brought a little girl up to be prayed for a five-year-old beautiful child my goodness unbelievably beautiful she was she was a mongolian from the from the uh from the step and and from an ancient people and she was rushing and she had come down that was her heritage and she had epileptic fit she was having she's like five years old beautiful long black hair dark black eyes gorgeous little child sweet as she could be and she was having three or four epileptic seizures a day three or four a day and me and a couple other brothers just laid hands on her no thunder no lightning just condemned the devil and asked jesus to be merciful to her she was healed instantly she didn't have another one from that moment and yeah i went back years later and they said brother jason from that moment god healed that child and she never had another epileptic fit hallelujah god keeps his word i was in the philippines preaching with with brother mike it was with your dad my very first missionary trip brother james took me to the philippines and i want to tell you something at the baptism after the meetings were over a native filipino they're not or they're not asian at all they're actually dark in complexion he come down out of the mountains and walked down and heard the meetings and gave his heart to the lord and came to be baptized and when he did his body was covered head to toe maybe your dad told you about this brother mike years ago his body was covered in sores and cankers from his head all down his arms his chest his fingers down his legs and we took him down brother james took him down under the water in the name of the lord jesus christ and when he come up every one of those sores washed off and his skin was like a baby god keeps his word god keeps his word there's power in prayer there's power in a consecrated life there's power when you'll submit yourself and make christ first make christ first don't make him second he don't want to be second hallelujah [Applause] oh how many things i jotted down so many just just to encourage you to things that just i've seen just in my ministry alone stood and stood and that's not just overseas i stood in florida praying for a woman that come up and was convinced she had heart trouble i knew she didn't the holy spirit spoke to my heart and i just immediately told us it says there's nothing wrong with your heart as it's the devil lying to you and it's just got you nervous and the change of life is on you you're don't you're fine let me pray a blessing of god on you and she went away from there and it was gone like that you say what did you do to her all i did was give her the promises of god's word by his strengths by his wounds you are already healed you need deliverance tonight it's yours if you want it you need the holy ghost tonight it's yours if you want it god keeps his word now i'm going to tell you something you you can jump up and down all day long but if you're not sincere before god the devil knows that if you god gives you an opportunity he doesn't say you'll take it he says there has no temptation taken you but such as his common demand but within that god has made a way that you might escape it it doesn't say you will escape it he said you could i'll make a way for you to be up to you if you take it or not see i had i had a man come to me some years ago he's having terrible marital problems and and fell and and and said he had a dream that his wife was cheating on him and i said well you know i'd have to see the dream so let's pray and see if god will show me the dream and then we'll know what we'll know what his word is and dreams operate in my life and ministry i'm not a prophet at all and usually it's a prophet that has to do that but the holy ghost can use any gifts in any holy ghost filled believer and so i prayed and sure enough i saw the dream perfectly came back set him down in my office and i said there was this this this and he said yeah and i said you didn't tell me about this he goes oh i forgot about that i said now did you notice this certain detail about your wife do you remember this in the dream he goes yeah you're right that was true and i said see that proves it wasn't this and it proves it wasn't this it's not rebellion it's just you are her problem you're the problem she don't actually have a problem it's coming from you and you'd you'd think you'd think he would have accepted and made changes and he did seem to accept it right there what could he do he couldn't deny it i saw the dream he had i told him things in the dream he left out in the dream telling me the dream and so we find out that that it was confirmed to him by prophecy and he went out of there and failed to make those changes and never repaired the marriage and it's blown to pieces to this day i'm here to tell you something god is not a god's not santa claus as i said he's not a vending machine this isn't this isn't you know just some charismatic pep rally we're talking about here we're talking about the power of god over demons i have a friend i have a pastor friend over in india and has tremendous tremendous ministry casting cassian devils in india they got some real hum dingers buddy i'm gonna tell you they had a little boy that little boy come into the church and he had a monkey demon on him say that sounds funny it's true little boy literally rolled and like like you see a little kid talk you know flipping he flit he flipped into the church they said here he is he flipped into the church flipped up in front of the pastor flipped all around and they they gathered the deacons around him to pray for him and his and the whole thing had come because his parents are worshiping a monkey god india's got 33 million of them 33 million gods and things they worship listen friends don't be fooled and think that that what's on your computer screen is just something innocent it it's it's coming from the from the tree of knowledge of good and evil and satan knows how to use it and he knows how to anoint your spirit and knows how to torment your mind and knows how to get things and get a hold and don't let him do it friends brothers and sisters don't let him do it because i've seen him get on men like that get on women and it can take years to throw that thing off i tell you if you already feel a little bit bound up tonight say lord right now i accept freedom lord right now i take the holy ghost i am free in the power of god hallelujah and they went to pray for him and they all closed their eyes and gathered in a circle when they opened their eyes he was gone and the little guy had rolled right between one of those legs rolled out the door and disappeared into the night into the jungle and all the deacons and everybody's running around with flashlights and the parents are screaming and brother the brother the pastor i won't call his name he just takes his flashlight and he said lord where's the child and the lord said go forward and he'll start walking forward i'm going to tell you the sons of god are led by the spirit of god and he said go here now turn right and he turn right now go some more now turn left now go some more now stop shine your light in that tree and shine it up and there's the child and they brought him down and took him back into the church and commanded the demon to come out of him and he stood on his feet like a normal child for the first time in years how how how had a man broad he wasn't even a believer had a man a man brought he was an idol worshiper and brought his wife into the church because this pastor has a has a reputation for casting out devils even the even the police come get him at two or three and four in the morning to go cast the devil out of a crazy person they can't handle and the woman come in and brother and the brother began to speak to her and she hit the floor and started writhing like a snake and hissing and she slithered up to him and tried to bite him but he said you can't touch me the power of jesus stops you and she got within inches and she couldn't go any further and she rolled around and screamed and cried and a man's voice started speaking out of her and said and this this couple had had she had been pregnant four or five times and every time she had a miscarriage and this demon started speaking out of her in a male voice and said i am the one because the pastor said who are you and he wouldn't want to say it in the name of jesus i command you who are you and he said i'm the one who has been eating the fetuses every time she conceives i eat the child and the pastor said you will come out of her and he said i won't come out of her and he said you will come and i asked him one time i said brother i said what what do you do if the devil won't come out he goes no this is not allowed i thought okay okay man said that's not allowed i guess that's not allowed okay devil is not allowed you're coming out and he commanded that devil to come out of her and it actually ended up being multiple devils cast every one of them out and a year later he sent me a picture the man gave his heart to jesus christ the woman gave her heart to christ and they were standing there dedicating a baby i'm here to tell you something friend god still moves for anyone who'll believe his word in fact it is later the pastor told me he told me that that actually the lord come to him the whole time cops were coming knocking on his door at three in the morning they'd take him out away from his family he'd cast demons out and come back home he said as soon as i entered my village all the dogs would start howling again as soon as i walked in the village because i knew demons were trying to follow me brother man talks about those things those things are real friends don't let anybody ever tell you a devil's not real don't let anybody ever tell you jesus isn't more real hallelujah and and and and finally the lord told him and said don't go anymore said tell those people to come to church and hear the word of god and repent and i'll heal them this ain't just a circus i'm not here just casting out devils for no reason and when the police came back he said you bring him to church sunday morning keep him in chains and bring him sunday morning and they'd bring him and he'd come in with chains and leave without them hallelujah oh i've seen it friends i've seen it i'm here to tell you i've seen it i i i've got friends in africa and and and here's a name i will call because many of you know him brother abraham myra who's been at our church and traveled around giving his testimony i'm here to tell you something that man when he gave his heart to the lord his own daddy tried to have him murdered multiple times and every time the assassins would be sneaking waiting to kill him he would just stop the angel lord said they're hiding right there call him out and he would call him out and they'd come before him ready to kill him and say because you have agreed and coveted with my own dad to shed innocent blood every one of you will be dead in a year one man died within minutes another man died within months and another man died seven or eight months later one man tried tried to tried to strike him tried to strike the death blow on him and the holy spirit struck him first and he fell to his face and hit a rock busted all of his teeth out and ran off later till he died i'm here to tell you this is a serious god god is serious about his word he was he was walking by the john one time he was coming back through the village because his village had sent him out he was only 15 years old and they ostracized him sent him out of the village his dad was the king of the tribe and they sent him out to live and he was naked and hungry and he said one night he was walking back to his hideout and the holy spirit said stop right here and he stopped and he said there's assassins hiding and he said where are they lord he said there's one there in the bushes one over here behind a tree one over here and one back there and they're all waiting as soon as you go through the gauntlet they're going to wipe you out and he said what do i do he said just stand still and brother abraham told me all of a sudden that light missiles call them what you want little missiles of light started flying over his head and blowing those guys up boom boom boom he said oh you never heard so much screaming men running screaming hollering he watched they ran down the village the light chased them beyond they ran past their homes into the jungles and god preserved his life to this very days a pastor is the largest church in uganda has 200 young people just young people has a jungle church it's impossible for him to have that many people with a jungle church but he has the largest church in all uganda and the power of god moves in him and and the people know it and respect him i'm here to tell you something if you'll make jesus christ first in your life first in your life then god can move in your life as well i was standing in the west coast of africa and there's a pastor there who went on to be with the lord just recently and when we got we got there me and some other brothers we found that he was under the influence of an evil spirit he's a very nice man but clearly he was under the influence of a lying prophecy spirit he'd given several prophecies they weren't true they hadn't come to pass and he wouldn't he wouldn't be corrected and we got there and he finally humbled himself and we put him in a circle and we gathered around him and started praying and i'll tell you something friends i'm not responsible to make you believe it i can only tell you what happened i was standing there with my eyes closed and my head bowed and suddenly i was looking at a demon spirit literally rising up out of this man and screaming as he went off and drifted off and that that pastor was set free right then and right there he stayed a faithful servant of god till the day god called him home just recently i'm here to tell you god still moves in his people the holy ghost is still just as real and just as relevant in 2021 as he ever has been hallelujah you okay can i tell you a couple more just a couple more brother matthew and i brother matt and i we're in beirut lebanon we were there on a missionary trip we were in lebanon very dangerous place to go i had actually been into syria a lot of those things that are bombed out now is hard for me to watch because i i walked in the streets of those cities i was in old damascus i walked the street called straight i saw where they let paul down out of a window i stood where he got knocked out of the saddle uh stephen's house i saw all of those different things and matthew and i were in barrett lebanon and we were we're holding a a little little church service only seven or eight men in there and matthew and i the only westerners and matt's preaching on the holy ghost and matt just starts preaching about the power of the holy ghost and that it's very real and it's very powerful and how it can change your life and i'm sitting there and the anointing begin to get thick and men begin to raise up their hands and the translator is trying to keep up he's he's talking as fast as he can and matt's you know how matt preached like a machine he's just going right at it and the translator is going right at it with him and all of a sudden i see grown men weeping i look across the aisle and here's a catholic priest in his robes and his and his everything and he gets out of his chair and he goes down to his knees and he raises up his hands i'm here to tell you the power of preaching all the holy ghost still moves people it still brings the unrepentant to christ oh my we the anointing was so thick and what did it come from from the power of the word because you had yeah they they were listening to a preacher who believed what he was preaching about and we were sitting there and and and then after that was all over we calmed down and everybody got back in their chairs and a little bit we had we calmed down and cooled down and then they wanted to ask some questions and so help me friends a lebanese man right here to my uh to my right started speaking asking me a question in lebanese and when he's asking me the question i said mm-hmm my and the translator said what are you earning about i didn't tell you what he said yet and then it dawned on me he hadn't translated it but i heard it perfectly i was sitting there and he's speaking in perfect lev in a perfect lebanese arabic he's speaking arabic that was a very difficult language he's speaking arabic i don't know a word of arabic i couldn't even tell you hi in arabic and he said he said you heard his question i said i heard every word of it he said tell me what his question was and i just repeated the question and he said oh glory hallelujah oh my god he said that's exactly what he's asked and i said now giving this answer out of the word of god and it met the need for the moment friends god because god is interested in meeting your need he's interested in meeting your need and your need and your needs he's interested in you here tonight i was preaching another time in in in russia and and i was preaching and just just meetings like this about a crowd about this size in moscow church and uh brother sasha's church and after the service he comes to tell me he said brother jason while you were preaching he said young people were getting filled with the holy ghost and i said well that's scripture and i came back the next night and preaching he comes back after service brother jason while you're preaching people with incurable diseases were being healed i come back the third night preaching and people were jumping up who had been bound in depression and darkness and evil and were being delivered on the spot i wasn't even praying for them i was just preaching the word of god hallelujah this thing is real friends this thing is real were coming off the street a man came got on a train

very back row and he knew enough english he heard the bible read he heard the comments i was mating making and the next thing he fell to his knees and gave his heart to the lord and those people are believers to this day those people are healed to this day they're healed to this day friends i'm here to tell you something friends that that that whether it's deliverance or whether it's the holy ghost or whether you need salvation i'm here to tell you that satan has a plan for you but the holy ghost has a plan for you and and dawn i want to say to you don't don't stagnate your life with worldly pleasures that strip you of your god-given privileges don't stagnate your mind with laodicea and deny your own self as the bible said men forsake their own mercies and deny yourself because

brother abraham i know him very well i've seen the power of god move in his life hallelujah this thing is real this thing this thing can be yours after the last service there was an elderly woman i'm glad she was elderly it would have made it kind of weirded me out otherwise but she was she was elderly and she came you'll understand in a minute and she came with the pastor brother sasha she came with me to give me a testimony and she said that she had been bound by a demon of depression and and oppression and she lived every day in a very dark place very dark she couldn't see she as if she just lived in a basement and she'd go out in the sunshine and to her it was just gloom it didn't matter what blessings came her way didn't matter her family loved her her grandchildren loved her they would kiss on her like any grandchild would but she lived in darkness and she didn't know why she was constantly depressed constantly gloomed she couldn't escape it she had a dream and in the dream she was in a dark dungeon like a like a deep root cellar she said way down and she said it was so dark she said i couldn't see anything it was all black i couldn't see so i couldn't see my hand in front of my face she said i'm just walking through pitch black darkness and she said suddenly a light opened and she said i realized there was a spiral staircase that opened at a door and she said a little girl opened that door and looked at me because that's where that came on her and she ran to that staircase and ran up that spiral staircase and the little girl moved out of the way and she burst into the light and she woke up later that day her phone rang oh okay i'm going to have to tell you this to i avoid this but i'm just going to tell it to make the story complete while she was in that dark basement groping in darkness she started crying out jason help me jason help me and then the little girl and then she was out and when she came out of the dream she thought that's strange i don't know a jason that's an american name i don't even know it jason why would i say jason help me her phone ring her best friend from across town said honey guess who brother sasha has coming for

i never brother john i never laid hands on a human i never prayed for anyone we made no prayer line no one even came up for prayer and i didn't even call for prayer because i could see what was happening was like the book of acts that while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost was falling and this one was jumping up and that was jumping up and i'm getting the testimony from the pastor of the church and here they come after the last service and she's not in a darkness anymore she's smiling she said she told me the story she said i'm free for the first time in years in years i'm free
