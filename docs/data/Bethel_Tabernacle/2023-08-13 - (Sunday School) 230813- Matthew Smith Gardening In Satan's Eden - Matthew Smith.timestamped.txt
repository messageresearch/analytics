[0:01] and God said behold
[0:03] I have given you every herb bearing seed
[0:06] which is upon the face of all the Earth
[0:08] and every tree
[0:11] in the witch is the fruit of a tree
[0:13] yielding seed to you it shall be for
[0:15] meat and to every beast of the earth and
[0:18] every fowl the air and everything that
[0:19] creepeth upon the Earth wherein there is
[0:22] life I have given every green herb for
[0:24] meat and it was so
[0:28] and God saw everything that he had made
[0:30] and behold it was very good and the
[0:33] evening in the morning were the sixth
[0:34] day okay y'all can be seated
[0:37] so
[0:38] um
[0:40] I was
[0:42] I was
[0:44] seems like these days there seems to be
[0:47] a um
[0:49] an obsession with uh
[0:52] you know what does it mean to be a human
[0:53] being like what is it you know like we
[0:55] have
[0:56] um the gender movement you know
[0:58] everybody's talking about what does it
[0:59] mean to be a man or a woman all these
[1:01] things
[1:03] and I was in
[1:05] I was hearing a discussion about that
[1:06] and it occurred to me you know in the
[1:08] Bible
[1:10] one of the first things that
[1:13] you know really when you look at what
[1:15] when God created Humanity
[1:20] he really lays out what humans most
[1:23] fundamental inner workings are right I
[1:26] mean this Obsession of what is
[1:28] what does it mean to be human I mean
[1:30] people philosophers have been going on
[1:31] about this for
[1:32] thousands of years really I mean you
[1:34] talk hear ancient Greeks have written
[1:36] down what they thought about what it
[1:38] meant to be a human you know 400 years
[1:40] BC I mean this is
[1:41] people have been you know frying their
[1:44] brains trying to figure this stuff out
[1:46] for a long time but really if you look
[1:47] at what
[1:49] how the story of God's creation of of
[1:52] man it really lays out fundamentally
[1:55] what you know there's there's certain
[1:57] fundamental aspects of what we are and
[1:58] how we function in that
[2:00] and um
[2:03] I find it interesting you know we would
[2:05] think well you know everyone's heard the
[2:07] phrase to air is human right humanity is
[2:09] imperfect and everything you do you have
[2:11] to it's the contending with the
[2:12] imperfection of your own abilities well
[2:16] according to the Bible you were
[2:17] something before you were imperfect
[2:19] right like the the I mean we would think
[2:22] that that Frailty and and and and
[2:25] mortality are some of these the
[2:28] fundamental aspects of what it means to
[2:29] be a human no actually
[2:33] beyond your mortality and imperfection
[2:36] is something a lot older than that right
[2:40] there's something bigger that's beyond
[2:42] that
[2:43] um before humans were imperfect and
[2:45] mortal
[2:46] they were made in the image of God
[2:48] right before it's I find it interesting
[2:51] that
[2:53] when God made Humanity
[2:56] the the two things that they were from
[2:58] the word jump right was that they were
[3:01] made in the image of God and that male
[3:02] and female created he them
[3:04] right that we can see that God made
[3:07] males and females and he made them in
[3:09] the image of God from the very beginning
[3:11] it was before man fell it was before
[3:13] they were anything else
[3:15] right they had the Divine spark of deity
[3:17] within them right they were the
[3:19] representation of Christ on the Earth
[3:20] and
[3:22] that they were male and female which I
[3:24] think is an indication of exactly where
[3:26] we are today why is it historically that
[3:28] every time a civilization Rises higher
[3:32] and higher in Civilization
[3:35] they're we always see a cultural
[3:37] movement to start questioning what
[3:38] gender is right you see these big why is
[3:42] it in Satan's even the Pinnacle of
[3:43] Satan's Eden we're breaking down what
[3:45] gender is right this is like the again
[3:48] one of the things that
[3:50] God instilled within humans from the
[3:53] very spark right from the very beginning
[3:55] because ultimately what it is is the
[3:57] devil is trying to destroy
[4:01] the the absolute Foundation of what God
[4:04] created humans to be
[4:06] and
[4:08] within this I thought you know as I'm
[4:10] reading through the story it it struck
[4:12] me that what God called humans to be
[4:14] what he his his Ideal Image
[4:18] um in some sense are gardeners right
[4:20] humans were to take he created a garden
[4:23] and he set Adam and Eve to have dominion
[4:26] and to be caretakers of a garden
[4:28] right that they would have and see
[4:30] gardening has a um
[4:34] gardening has a a particular atmosphere
[4:37] about it right it's it's
[4:39] in order to be a gardener you have to
[4:40] have patience you have to have it can't
[4:43] be about instant gratification because
[4:45] you will kill your plants doing that
[4:46] right you have to have a certain amount
[4:49] of
[4:50] um faith that what you what you put in
[4:53] the ground is going to come up later
[4:55] there's so much of everything God has of
[4:58] of what we as Saints of the end time are
[5:01] is wrapped up in
[5:04] in in in seed in in in planting and of
[5:08] growing right
[5:10] um
[5:12] so the other thing that I that I noticed
[5:14] is and this is this so struck me about
[5:16] humans being created in the image of God
[5:19] right
[5:20] um
[5:22] number one is that
[5:25] um
[5:26] it speaks to why because if you're the
[5:29] image of God
[5:32] speaks to why uh certain things are the
[5:34] way that they are we
[5:37] as far as I'm aware there's not a whole
[5:39] lot of this maybe somebody could correct
[5:41] me on this I don't know I was not able
[5:43] to find it
[5:44] um but I don't know of any particular
[5:46] scripture where it deals where the Bible
[5:48] specifically talks about nicotine
[5:51] I don't know of any where the Bible
[5:52] talks about smoking
[5:54] however
[5:56] we teach that that's you know that God
[5:59] does not uh this that's not acceptable
[6:02] for a Christian to do
[6:04] why not well it's because you're the
[6:07] image of God
[6:08] and by partaking in that you are
[6:10] defacing the image of God right you're
[6:12] poisoning that thing that God created as
[6:16] his representation on the earth and
[6:17] you're destroying it I mean it's it's I
[6:20] know there's there are some scriptures
[6:21] that deal with this but we don't
[6:23] we generally don't you know we preach
[6:26] against things like piercings and
[6:27] tattoos and and things like this why
[6:30] because it defaces the image of God
[6:32] right there's a you know if if we if
[6:35] there's a statue of George Washington
[6:36] out in town and when you found it there
[6:39] was you know spray paint all over it and
[6:42] you know garbage piled up on it and
[6:44] people dug big gouges out of it and you
[6:47] know shot Nails in it with a Hilty gun
[6:50] we're going to look at that and say well
[6:51] clearly somebody doesn't like George
[6:53] Washington very much
[6:54] right it's pretty obvious their
[6:56] motivations for doing this well when you
[6:58] see somebody who is
[7:00] covered in piercings and their body has
[7:02] been covered in tattoos and they have
[7:04] all these things you know they're
[7:07] they're uh poisoning their bodies with
[7:09] all kinds of substances well we can
[7:11] pretty much infer that if they're
[7:12] supposed to be the image of of God that
[7:14] something is driving them to to deface
[7:17] that and whatever that thing is it
[7:18] doesn't like God very much
[7:20] right
[7:22] um
[7:25] but moving on to to where I was saying
[7:27] with what we are as a you know to to be
[7:29] a gardener right
[7:31] God has given us a a small you know a
[7:36] garden to rule over you think well I
[7:38] mean Adam and Eve they kind of had the
[7:40] whole this whole Garden of Eden and does
[7:41] that really apply to us well yeah you
[7:43] have a little piece of the earth that
[7:44] you have full dominion over right you're
[7:47] made of the Dust of the Earth
[7:48] you might not have any authority over
[7:50] anything right maybe you're just a young
[7:51] person but you do have authority over
[7:54] that you have you have dominion over
[7:56] that piece of Earth that God has given
[7:58] to you
[8:00] um
[8:02] and it's your it is you know going back
[8:05] the last time I did Sunday school we
[8:06] talked a lot about you know freedom and
[8:08] responsibility
[8:10] and I guess the what I was really trying
[8:11] to get at with that was that you know in
[8:13] America we have so backwards the idea
[8:16] that will we have freedom
[8:18] we have freedom and it's just magically
[8:20] we have freedom God gave us freedom and
[8:22] God gave us these rights you know it's
[8:23] all about rights it's my right well
[8:26] the reason you have that right is
[8:28] because you are made in the image of God
[8:30] and you have a responsibility to act
[8:31] like it right you have a responsibility
[8:34] to
[8:35] do the things that God has commissioned
[8:37] you to do that is your responsibility
[8:39] and because of that you nobody has has
[8:43] the the the authority to come between
[8:46] you and fulfilling what God has for you
[8:49] to do
[8:50] and that's what that's what real freedom
[8:52] and liberty is is the is the freeness to
[8:54] fulfill God's
[8:56] commission right
[8:59] um
[9:01] I I ha I can't as Pop come back to my
[9:03] mind I I one of the things that I I
[9:05] thought of was
[9:07] um
[9:09] you know going back to the whole idea of
[9:12] of defacement right of the of the human
[9:14] body is ultimately a defacement of of
[9:16] the image of God you know it's it's so
[9:18] striking to me that
[9:21] you know that's you have these kids and
[9:24] I don't know this is a new thing but I
[9:26] think it's it's uh certainly seems more
[9:28] modern maybe it's just because of our
[9:30] awareness of it but it seems like
[9:32] anymore so many young people are dealing
[9:34] with suicide and self-harm
[9:36] right how many how many typically young
[9:39] girls though it's I don't certainly
[9:40] don't want to uh you know put a a
[9:43] bottleneck on that but you get a lot of
[9:46] kids covered in scars from cutting and
[9:48] things like that or kids who are
[9:51] um having having suicidal issues well
[9:53] what is that it's something within them
[9:55] that is and it's not just young people
[9:57] there's old people dealing with this too
[9:58] it's people who are
[10:01] there's something that hates God so much
[10:04] it's trying to destroy the image of God
[10:06] right it's the it's a devil who hates
[10:09] the image of God so much he's he's
[10:11] obsessed with covering it in scars right
[10:15] which is ironic the irony here the the
[10:18] thing to bear in mind in this
[10:21] the irony of that whole situation is
[10:23] that by doing that it is the devil
[10:26] admitting that you look like Christ
[10:28] because otherwise he wouldn't want to
[10:29] face it
[10:30] right it's the
[10:33] that's the that's the irony in the whole
[10:35] thing is that because there's this move
[10:37] in this time to destroy the human to
[10:40] destroy a Christian and what it means to
[10:41] be a Christian it's it's really an
[10:44] indication you know it's it's it's it's
[10:46] unfortunate and it that's the the
[10:49] ugliness about
[10:50] mental issues like suicide and things
[10:53] like that is the person is convinced
[10:55] that they're worthless and yet
[10:57] the fact that that's the struggle is an
[10:59] indication that the devil sees something
[11:01] worthwhile there that he's trying to
[11:03] destroy
[11:04] anyways
[11:05] um
[11:07] wow that time is fine today
[11:10] um
[11:11] so I'm I want to look at this idea of
[11:14] being a gardener right the idea that
[11:16] that uh
[11:19] God had commissioned Adam and Eve to to
[11:22] have dominion over this Garden to to
[11:23] plant and just and to sow and things
[11:25] like that
[11:27] and so much of our Lives you know we
[11:29] have this the garden that is yourself
[11:30] you know it's the it's the you have your
[11:33] the things that you can touch right
[11:35] you're you're the the things that God
[11:37] has given you dominion over whether it's
[11:38] your family whether it's whatever it is
[11:40] whatever it is that you have
[11:42] um you have a responsibility to
[11:47] um maintain that and be a steward of it
[11:49] and to raise that up into something that
[11:51] would be pleasing to God and
[11:54] I find it interesting
[11:56] um
[11:58] we
[12:01] first of all I would I
[12:05] so often we tend to as humans tend to
[12:08] neglect certain things right and this is
[12:10] where
[12:11] I remember driving past a a field
[12:15] um it was clearly it was a farmer's
[12:17] field that had not been planted and it
[12:20] hadn't been planted for a while
[12:22] and it's just overgrown I mean it's I
[12:25] mean it's up to your waist in Weeds
[12:28] and when you look at that you recognize
[12:32] if you don't plant something that
[12:34] doesn't mean nothing will grow
[12:36] right oftentimes we as humans have a
[12:40] tendency to neglect certain things we'll
[12:42] neglect corners of Our Lives we'll
[12:44] neglect certain areas and if you've ever
[12:45] tried to grow a garden you're very much
[12:47] aware that the little places that you
[12:49] are not constantly on top of the little
[12:51] corners of the of your garden plot will
[12:54] grow they'll grow something and you
[12:56] don't have to do anything it'll be all
[12:57] by itself and it's nothing that you want
[13:00] and a lot of the times the stuff that
[13:02] we're not constantly proactively on top
[13:04] of the stuff that we're not constantly
[13:07] putting effort into bringing into
[13:10] subjection to the word will be though
[13:12] something is going to grow there
[13:14] and it won't be anything that you want
[13:15] right and so oftentimes we get slack and
[13:19] we'll get lazy and ultimately it's it's
[13:21] a it's a product of
[13:24] the fall right I mean what was the thing
[13:26] that
[13:27] what happened when Adam fell as God
[13:30] condemned him to contend with thistles
[13:34] right I mean you you can read that in um
[13:38] uh
[13:39] decided to hang on my notes ran away
[13:44] um
[13:47] yeah in Genesis chapter 3 verse 16 do we
[13:50] have a screen yet
[13:52] okay
[13:54] um if you could pull up Genesis chapter
[13:55] chapter 3 verse 16. but I mean
[13:58] ultimately it's it's God recognizing
[14:01] that
[14:03] um because Adam fell part of his curse
[14:06] um uh do go to 17 please
[14:10] just for the interest time yes and Adam
[14:12] he said because thou has hearkened under
[14:13] the voice of thy wife and has eaten of
[14:15] the tree of which I commanded thee
[14:16] saying thou shall not eat of it curses
[14:18] the ground for thy sake and sorrow thou
[14:20] eat of it in all the days of their life
[14:23] um is there a verse 18
[14:26] .
[14:27] um yeah thorns and thistles shall bring
[14:28] fourth unity and thou shall eat the herb
[14:31] of the field 19.
[14:34] um in the sweat of thy face shall thou
[14:35] eat bread till I return to the ground
[14:37] for out of it was thou taken for dust
[14:40] Thou Art and unto death shell thou
[14:42] return
[14:43] this is
[14:45] ultimately this this everything that you
[14:47] are is this Fallen nature of your flesh
[14:49] is going to produce habits that you
[14:52] didn't ask for it's going to produce
[14:55] um uh
[14:57] um it's going to produce
[15:00] um
[15:01] behaviors and attitudes and bitterness
[15:03] and anger and depression and all this
[15:07] this string of things that you didn't
[15:10] ask for your body your flesh your your
[15:13] who you are it's just gonna do it all by
[15:15] itself unless you are constantly tending
[15:19] it unless you are constantly speaking
[15:22] the word to it unless you're constantly
[15:25] bringing it into under subjection to the
[15:27] word
[15:28] and um just
[15:31] uh have to start wrapping up here but
[15:34] I you know we have
[15:36] um
[15:38] you know brother random talks about I
[15:40] don't have time to pull it up now but
[15:42] brother Brandon talks a lot about how
[15:44] you know Adam
[15:46] uh he he could just speak and things
[15:48] would happen right you know this tree
[15:49] needs to move over here he would speak
[15:51] and the tree just uproots itself and
[15:52] moves over there you know this mountain
[15:53] needs to not be there this Valley needs
[15:55] to go over there you know these things
[15:57] you know Adam could just speak and the
[15:58] Earth would just manifest in into what
[16:01] he spoke right and you know the the
[16:04] and so and then it talks about you know
[16:06] obviously we're aware that you know when
[16:08] God created the heavens Earth he speaks
[16:09] you know let there be and then out of
[16:11] the earth the earth just manifests into
[16:13] what he spoke right the seed within his
[16:16] word right that when he spoke within
[16:19] that word was a seed and that seed would
[16:21] go to the Earth and then
[16:22] Sprout and grow into
[16:25] um the Fulfillment of of his of his word
[16:29] and
[16:30] Adam in speaking intending the garden
[16:33] through the spoken word is is
[16:35] replicating what God the way God
[16:37] operated right he was an amateur God on
[16:39] the Earth
[16:41] well ultimately isn't that what we're
[16:43] called to do
[16:44] right
[16:45] we have
[16:47] um
[16:51] we have
[16:53] uh a position right God has put us on
[16:56] the earth and he's calling us back to a
[16:58] place of Eden so doesn't that imply that
[17:00] when we're attending our Gardens that we
[17:03] should be operating that doing that
[17:05] through a spoken word by by speaking in
[17:09] accordance with the word of God and then
[17:13] what we speak
[17:15] manifest right we to have faith in that
[17:18] would it would happen
[17:20] um I want to read this this quote
[17:23] um
[17:25] here it is this is from at Thy Word In
[17:27] 1953 it says
[17:31] um at Thy word Lord I'm going to rise up
[17:33] from here I don't know how I'm going to
[17:34] do it but at Thy word Lord that's it
[17:37] take God at his word in God's spoken
[17:39] word will materialize and produce just
[17:41] exactly what it says it will listen the
[17:44] right mental attitude to attitude
[17:46] towards any Divine promise of God will
[17:49] bring it to pass I don't care what it is
[17:52] if you uh plant if you want corn you
[17:56] plant corn water corn leave corn alone
[18:00] it'll produce corn is that right wheat
[18:04] will produce wheat
[18:05] the promise of Salvation will produce a
[18:07] Christian the promise of the Holy Ghost
[18:09] will bring it to you the promise of
[18:11] Divine Healing will make you well any
[18:13] Divine promise of God and the Bible said
[18:15] that the word of God is a seed is that
[18:18] right
[18:19] Jesus said that A sower sowed and if
[18:21] you'll just take it in your heart and
[18:23] don't dig it up every day to see how
[18:25] it's getting along just sink it in your
[18:27] heart and settle it that's all walk
[18:29] right on God will take care of the rest
[18:31] of it he's obligated to his word
[18:34] do you know that everything that you see
[18:36] tonight is God's word materialized do
[18:39] you know that your body is God's word
[18:41] materialized
[18:43] do you know that the uh let's see um
[18:47] that concrete is God's spoken word
[18:49] materialized you know the whole earth is
[18:51] God's spoke is God spoke and said let
[18:53] there be and he believed his own word
[18:55] and an Earth come into existence if it
[18:58] didn't where'd it come from
[19:00] right and so so oftentimes we're running
[19:03] to these issues and oftentimes it's not
[19:05] so much you know that we're we have
[19:07] issues of
[19:09] you know what's going on around us
[19:12] that
[19:13] we struggle with right I mean though it
[19:16] happens you know sickness and and
[19:18] financial things and things like that it
[19:21] comes up we we
[19:24] um encounter those and and I find that
[19:27] oftentimes it's so easy for us
[19:30] to pray and and walk on faith when
[19:34] you know we're we're in a in a situation
[19:36] that we're kind of um sort of a exterior
[19:40] World sort of situation but when it's
[19:43] something in your heart something on the
[19:45] inside we have a lot less Faith or maybe
[19:48] it's just me I don't know it's a lot
[19:50] less Faith to say well that needs to
[19:53] come into subjection of the word and I'm
[19:54] going to speak and then it's going to
[19:55] come on come to pass
[19:57] right it's a lot harder for us to say
[20:01] this bitterness that I feel is going to
[20:03] come under subjection when I speak
[20:05] right it's harder for us to do that you
[20:07] know it's harder for us to to to to deal
[20:10] with with a a
[20:13] um
[20:14] you know anything that that uh you know
[20:17] like an addiction or something like that
[20:18] harder for us to look at that and say
[20:20] well
[20:22] I can walk on faith and and just speak
[20:25] the word and it'll come to pass it's
[20:27] harder for us to do that
[20:30] um
[20:31] and I think that but ultimately that's
[20:33] that's what it that's where uh we are in
[20:37] this day that was what the whole uh
[20:39] that's what
[20:40] um
[20:41] that's that's our over our Dominion
[20:43] right
[20:44] if you don't have dominion over the this
[20:47] piece of Flesh right this piece of the
[20:48] earth that God gave you then what do you
[20:51] have of anything this is the this is
[20:52] where you should have dominion the most
[20:54] right you should be able to walk on out
[20:56] on faith and and and overcome these
[21:00] things that that beset us so easily you
[21:03] we we have the authority to do that
[21:05] right the the devil has no more
[21:08] authority to to bind you the only way
[21:11] that he has the ability to do it is
[21:12] because we don't actually
[21:15] recognize that we can tell him to leave
[21:18] we tend to tend to just lay down and die
[21:21] instead of fighting and just accepting
[21:24] the Fate it's not that's not
[21:28] you know ultimately
[21:31] um
[21:33] really the the the the the the the
[21:36] drive that we should have is to is to
[21:39] recognize that we're free of these
[21:41] things and move forward
[21:43] and to because ultimately ultimately the
[21:45] word of God says there's going to be a
[21:46] perfect bride at the end
[21:48] right I mean God said it I I had a this
[21:51] is
[21:52] where we're freestyling now I don't have
[21:54] this in my nose
[21:57] I uh
[21:58] the other day I was talking to my wife
[22:00] and I said you know the Bible says that
[22:01] God swear by himself because he could
[22:02] not lie well I always could thought of
[22:06] that as well doesn't that I don't know
[22:09] this is the way I always took it was
[22:10] well that's just because God is
[22:11] physically incapable of saying something
[22:12] that's not true right you know if he
[22:14] knows that it's green and he says it's
[22:16] blue that would be a falsehood so we
[22:17] can't do that there's just he's
[22:18] impossible to do that well maybe but
[22:22] isn't it also possible that a being with
[22:24] the power of the spoken word that when
[22:25] he speaks reality rearranges so that
[22:27] what he said was true
[22:29] if he said it was green but it's
[22:30] actually blue would it would it be a lie
[22:33] if when he said it it became what he
[22:35] said it was
[22:36] right if if we're looking at ourselves
[22:39] saying oh we're imperfect we're the
[22:40] imperfect thing we could never be a
[22:41] perfect bride of Christ but God said
[22:43] there was going to be a bride of Christ
[22:45] so whether you are or not is kind of
[22:47] beside the point if what he says is
[22:48] going to manifest you and what he said
[22:50] it would be
[22:51] right
[22:52] is it a lie no it's just that your
[22:55] reality hasn't caught up with what he
[22:57] said yet
[22:58] um so anyways we're out of time uh so
[23:02] we'll have a word of prayer and let
[23:04] y'all worship Lord let's have a we'll
[23:07] stand
[23:12] Lord father
[23:15] thank you for this opportunity Lord to
[23:17] maybe say something that would
[23:20] benefit the people or just an
[23:23] encouragement
[23:24] might even just be the one
[23:26] Lord thank you for the opportunity to
[23:28] help just one
[23:30] Lord asked that you would take these
[23:33] things that I've said and maybe that the
[23:35] people will be able to
[23:37] grab hold and it would give them a
[23:38] little bit of extra encouragement to to
[23:41] not to not give up in this dark time
[23:46] Lord we thank you Father and we thank
[23:49] you for this opportunity to worship you
[23:51] and invite you to the service and that
[23:52] you would be with us as we praise your
[23:55] name in the upcoming service that we
[23:56] would ultimately partake in the ultimate
[23:59] form of worship and the hearing of your
[24:00] word
[24:02] and we ask these things in Jesus name
[24:03] amen
