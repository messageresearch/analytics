TRANSCRIPT
========================================
He displays [music] himself through his bride and many people can't see it. There's coming a day all we'll see. Amen. I want to be that bride. I want to reflect Jesus Christ in [music] my life. And I know you do, too. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here. Amen. Do you have a request upon your heart this evening? I know I have a request. I'm [music] My son is definitely struggling. I can't believe [music] it. But you know, God knows. Commit him to God and just leave it there and [music] it'll be all right. Amen. Let's pray. Father, I love you, Lord. As I stand here this evening, Father, how great. Listen to a sermon, Father, about [music] the infinity of God and how finite man is. And Lord, we see such a small portion, [music] but one day we will see as we are seen. Father, I [music] pray that you bless the people. You saw the hands that were lifted. You know the the burden upon my heart for my son. And Lord, I know you speak to me. [music] And I know that you tell me it'll be okay. And I thank you [music] for that. without that still small voice. Father, like Elijah [music] in the cave. We like the wind, we like the fire, we like the earthquake, but help us to just follow the leading of that still small voice. Bless your people this evening. Bless your tithes and [music] offerings. Lord, remember those that are streaming wherever we hear the word that comes forth [music] this evening. magnify it to our hearts, Father, Engs, Lord, that we [music] could just walk a little bit closer to you. I love your people. I love you. I thank you for your mercy and [music] grace, Father. Where would we be without it? I love you. And I pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Y'all can be seated. Made of wood, built by man. There [music] it stood. Salvation's plan. Adam's fall [music] and my own sin. [music] It was all [music] placed [singing] on him. [music] Without the cross, [music] I would not know [music] redeeming [singing] love [music] that sought my [singing] soul. Without the blood, where [music and singing] would I be? I would be lost without [music] the cross. I would be lost without [music] the cross. [music] Mercy spilled love divine [music] on Calvar's hill for all menind [music] flowing [singing] through [music] the ages past destined [music and singing] to reach me at last. [music and singing] Without the cross, I would not [music] know redeeming love [music] that sought my soul. Without the blood, where would I be? I would be lost.

I just want to sing it, I guess, my way. [music] A wonderful Savior is Jesus, [music] my Lord. Oh, a wonderful Savior to me. [music] He hideth my soul in the cl of the [music and singing] rock where rivers of pleasure I see. He hideth my soul in the [music] cliff of the rock that shadows a dry thirsty land.

He taketh my burden away. [music] He holdeth me up and I shall [music] not be moved. He giveth me strength as my day.

[music] Oh, he hideth my soul in the cl of the rock that shadows [music] a dry thirsty land. Oh, he hideth my life [music] in the depths of his love that covers [music] me there with his hand [music] and covers me there with his Amen. [music] I just want to thank you, Lord, for every time [music] you heard me pray. Just want to thank you for always [music] being there. [music] When I was so down, you came alone. [music] Made me want to sh [music] you. Oh, thank [music] you. If [music] I had a thousand lives to live, [music] I'd give it all for the Lord. He's been so good [music] to me. That is the least [music] I could make the good times [music] down the best [music and singing] friend I've ever had. Just want [music] to thank you. Thank you, Lord.

Invite the I believe it's believe it's the [music] pastor preaching tonight. Of course, we trust that it's not Brother Jason preaching. If it was Brother Jason preaching, we'd be in a world of hurt. [music] But it's the Lord Jesus preaching tonight, and that's why I'm here. I want to see here. Um, let's do Nobody Loves Me Like You. Four. See you in the sunrise. every [singing] morning like a [music and singing] picture that you've painted for me. Love letter in the sky.

Nobody loves me [music] like you do. Amen. You believe that? Praise the Lord. He's worthy of that. Hallelujah. My It's [music] interesting, brother Matt would have that song queued up for me to come out on. Praise God. Nice confirmation, [music] Lord. Appreciate that. Amen. God bless you. We greet you this evening in the name of the Lord. Happy to have all of you here. Praise God. We're going to go right into the book of James this evening, chapter 4. Amen. And I invite you to turn there. James chapter 4. Um, actually, I think I have it in my PowerPoint, so um, you can go ahead and and uh, put that up. I wanted to just while they're doing that and while you're finding your place. Wanted to just remind you that we have services this weekend, special services, Amen. with Brother Andrew Glover. We're looking forward to it greatly. Amen. Amen. Sister Debbie, she said, she reminded me. She said, "So, you're going to be in church tonight." Mhm. I'm actually preaching. Okay. And you're going to be at the men's prayer meeting tomorrow night. Oh, yeah. That's right. And then you're going to be at the youth gathering Friday night. Praise God. And then you got a min uh Bible study breakfast Saturday morning. Yeah. AND A SPECIAL SERVICE SATURDAY NIGHT and Sunday morning. Amen. AND THEN A FELLOWSHIP IN THE UPPER ROOM SUNDAY NIGHT. I SAID, "I'm going to be a spiritual man." [laughter] Wow. I'm going to be full of the Holy Ghost by the time this weekend is over. Amen. Praise the Lord. Get a nice oldfashioned refilling. Oh, I'll take a thousand of those, man. Amen. You know, the they got the same thing in Acts four that they got in Acts two. Amen. And so, I'm all for a refilling. Praise God. So, I just want to make that clear. Our services will start um right here Saturday night at 7 o'clock and then Sunday morning with brother uh Andrew will carry on. Now for our senior youth, we've got a gathering at the Urban Brew on on Saturday at 7 and Brother Andrew is going to minister. Uh what did I say? I meant it's Friday. Yeah. Thank you all. So we'll be here Saturday night. Young people will be there Friday night. Praise the Lord. Amen. [laughter] Amen. And you are like my wife. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. If I get it wrong, she'll fix me. Amen. Praise God. James chapter 4. And um you can see my title here. Let's see. Uh where's my little Is this going to work here? Let's hope it worked last time, didn't it? Oh, it's already on. I better turn it off and turn it back on. Okay, I'm gonna give it a try. Josh, um ah it works. You can see my subtitle. I'm I want to speak to you tonight on sufficiency versus excellency. Sufficiency versus excellency. The battle against living lukewarm. There's almost nothing in the world that that that I mean I am just uh almost bulletproof to depression. Um I get that from brother Eddie. Thank the Lord. Amen. And uh I'm always a glass is half full kind of guy. To me, every dark cloud has a silver lining. Every last one of them. And uh I'm just that way. And if I something does get me down, it's usually gone by noon. Amen. But one of the things that will knock me down is if I find myself accepting sufficiency and not excellency. Amen. if I'm just just doing enough to get by and u you know especially God forbid living living lukewarm. Amen. Praise the Lord. James, let's go. I've got it right here for you, but you've got your Bibles open. Amen. We're going to just read these first um uh maybe the four first four verses. From whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence even of your lust that war in your members. You remember Paul talks about that that in our members you know he said that that whole black dog white dog fight that goes on within us. And you know he said I find another law in my members that is my flesh waring against the the real me on the inside. So James is talking to people. It almost sounds like he's talking to people who have never even been born again, but that's not true. He's actually talking to people who are born again. But watch what he's saying here. From whence come wars and fightings among you. Come they not hence even of your lust lusts that war in your members. You lust and have not. You kill and desire to have. Doesn't mean you go murder somebody. Remember John his buddy had already said in his first epistle that to hate someone is to kill them. To hate them is to murder them. See? So you lust and have not. You kill and desire to have and cannot obtain. You fight and war. Yet you have not because you ask not. Isn't that amazing? Next. Next two. You ask and receive not because you ask a miss that you may consume it upon your lusts. Ye adulterers and adulteresses. Remember Jesus said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan." Amen. Peter wasn't Satan. He's speaking to what was happening in Peter's mind. All right? You adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not, boy, look at this. Know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? [clears throat] Enmity means that they're just they can't be reconciled. They're polar opposites. They don't they don't get along. They're not they don't live in the same space. All right? It's enmity with God. Whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the say it with me enemy of God. Maybe you don't mean to be, right? But if you're a friend of the world, as far as God's concerned, you're his enemy. All right, let's pray. Father, we commit ourselves into your hands right now. And I ask, Lord, that as I feel your anointing settling down upon me to preach this sermon, Lord, this sermon has been quite something for me, Lord. At times I have felt so encouraged by it and and then I'll open up another chapter of it and I'll feel like I'm laid out flat and then I'll feel that you've picked me up and encouraged me again and then I feel laid out flat again. And Lord, it's been a an amazing little journey studying this. I've been looking at it for some number of days. And so I am just asking you to be mindful of us all tonight on this Wednesday night. Lord, seems like a perfect little sermon for a Wednesday night. And it's from my heart, Lord. And I'm I'm so identifying myself here. I'm like these believers, Lord. I I don't want to be friends with the world. I know that these believers were pricricked in their hearts, Lord, because they were they love you. And and and the apostle felt like he had to use some shock therapy, Lord. So I pray that you will be our helper tonight, Lord. As we stand in your presence, we commit ourselves in into in your purposes now in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You can be seated. [clears throat] you know, the the language that we've read here [clears throat] is pretty rough. Pretty rough. And so I I just thought to myself, "Wow, James, you really I mean, this is this is Sister Debbie maybe her favorite book in the whole Bible, the book of James." And I say, "Wow, that language is really tough." Wow. It's almost I mean in in in I mean in in the woke Bible it don't say nothing like that. The liberals their Bible don't don't read like that. Their their Bible sees [clears throat] God as just you know having really no direct control over mankind. And when I read this I'm I'm pretty sure God has a lot or is intending to have a lot of control over our everyday lives. Our everyday walking talking walking around lives. Would you agree? [clears throat] Since James is so harsh here, I decided to switch translations and make it worse. That's what the Amplified Bible does. Whenever you read something in the Amplified, if it's good, it amplifies it to great. But if you read something tough, it really gets tough. All right. What leads to strife, discord, and feuds? And how do conflicts, quarrels, and fightings originate among you, you believers? How can this happen? Do they not arise from your sensual desires that are ever waring in your bodily members? I know you're born again. I know you love the Lord. THAT'S NOT IN QUESTION. WE'RE NOT This isn't an an outreach where we're where this is uh where we're trying to reach the sinner. I'm preaching tonight always to sinners, but we're preaching largely tonight to believers like me, like you. AMEN. AND WE SAY, I BUT I LOVE THE LORD. SO DO THESE PEOPLE. So did James. Say, WELL, DON'T YOU LOVE US, BROTHER JASON? I DO. SO DID JAMES. AMEN. WATCH. These are things that are waring in your bodily members. This is what keeps you, if you let it, from excellency. you are jealous and covet what others have. I mean, even if you say, "Well, wow, that's pretty broad." If you can say tonight and say, "You know, none of that stuff's true about me." Understand this that it all can be. Amen. Amen. It can be. Let your guard down and it will be. Yeah. See, you are jealous and covet what others have and your desires go unfulfilled. So you become murderers. To hate is to murder as far as your hearts are concerned. You burn with envy and anger and are not able to obtain the gratification, the contentment and the happiness that you seek. So you fight and war. Do you not have? YOU DO NOT HAVE BECAUSE YOU DO NOT ASK. AMEN. Or you OR YOU DO ASK GOD FOR THEM AND YET FAIL TO RECEIVE THEM BECAUSE YOU ASK WITH WRONG PURPOSE and evil selfish motives. LOOK, BEFORE I MOVE ON, I I think that what the Bible IS TRYING TO GET US TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT ALL IT TAKES IS a little abandonment of your prayer life, a little too much uh friendship with THE WORLD, AND YOU'LL FIND THAT OLD NATURE THAT YOU THOUGHT THE HOLY GHOST HAD HAD COMPLETELY ANNIHILATED. WHAT HE ANNIHILATED WAS NOT YOUR FLESH AND NOT YOUR SPIRIT. IT WAS THAT FALLEN NATURE. SO THAT YOU NOW AT LEAST YOU HAVE THE FREEDOM TO LOVE GOD. AMEN. SEE, YOU HAVE THE FREEDOM NOW to choose. PEOPLE SAY, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO GET AWAY FROM THE WORD OF GOD SO I CAN MAKE MY OWN CHOICE. THERE'S NO CHOICE. THERE'S ONLY IN CHRIST DO YOU HAVE A CHOICE. AMEN. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU GET A CHOICE. OTHERWISE, YOU'RE A PRISONER TO your sin and you can't CHOOSE OTHERWISE. I JUST SAY, LORD, I'M SO GLAD FOR THE HOLY GHOST. BECAUSE NOW I GOT A FIGHTING CHANCE. HALLELUJAH. I MIGHT GET DOWN AND I MIGHT FIND MYSELF IN MEDIOCRITY, BUT I I DON'T HAVE TO STAY THERE. I MIGHT BE LOOKING LIKE A LUKEWARM CHRISTIAN, BUT I CAN COME TO CHURCH AND HEAR THE WORD AND FEEL THE SPIRIT AND GET WASHED CLEAN, AND I CAN GO OUT OF HERE IN VICTORY. HOW MANY WANT TO GO OUT OF HERE IN VICTORY TONIGHT? ARE you see he HE THIS IS OBVIOUSLY I MEAN LOOK LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE YOU DO NOT HAVE BECAUSE YOU DO NOT ASK. SO THIS IS A PERSON WHO'S NOT USED TO PRAYING for a while. You see that OR YOU DO ASK GOD FOR THEM. YOU TREAT HIM LIKE SANTA CLAUS. SEE, YOU FAIL YET FAIL TO GET BECAUSE YOU ASK WITH THE WRONG PURPOSE AND EVIL SELFISH MOTIVES. YOUR INTENTION IS WHEN YOU GET WHAT YOU DESIRE TO SPEND IT IN sensual pleasures. Can you believe an apostle would talk like this? You are like you're like unfaithful WIVES HAVING ILLICIT LOVE AFFAIRS with the world AND BREAKING YOUR MARRIAGE. VOW TO GOD. I TOLD YOU IT'S GOING TO get worse. DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT BEING THE WORLD'S friend is being God's enemy? Young people, PLEASE READ THAT CAREFULLY. THIS IS HOW GOD FEELS ABOUT IT. DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT BEING THE WORLD'S FRIEND IS BEING GOD'S ENEMY? SO, WHOEVER CHOOSES TO BE a friend of the world takes his stand as an enemy of God. Amen. I would hate to think that I took my stand and my stand is an I'm an enemy of God. I'm an enemy of God. Here I stand. Wow. Or do you suppose that the scripture is speaking to no purpose that says THE SPIRIT WHOM HE HAS CAUSED TO DWELL IN US YEARNS over us and he yearns for the spirit to be welcome with a jealous love. DO YOU REALIZE THAT GOD IS JEALOUS OVER YOUR HEART? HE'S JEALOUS OVER YOUR AFFECTIONS. HE'S VERY JEALOUS OVER YOUR LOVE. AND HE'S OFFERING YOU THE WORLD NOW AND THE [screaming] WORLD'S TO COME. AND ALL HE SAYS IS, "LET ME LIVE IN YOUR HEARTS." AMEN. SEE, but he gives us, I love this, he finally throws us some encouragement. But he gives us more and more grace, power of the Holy Spirit to meet this evil tendency and all others fully. Now you know where you know where you find that principle in the scripture that the grace of God people say what is grace and they have this they have this really almost a nauseating idea of grace that God just is an old dirty grandpa who loves his grandkids and who will let him get AWAY WITH OLD DIRTY GRANDPAS WILL DO THAT God won't do that THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF LOVE BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID IT'S NOT LIKE THE CARE OF A BABY IT'S NOT THAT KIND of love THAT THAT THAT THAT THE BIBLE SAYS THAT GRACE TEACHES US TO DENY UNGODLINESS. HOW HOW DID I KNOW TO DENY UNGODLINESS? GRACE. OH WELL. WELL, WHAT HAPPENED IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT? THEN HE CAME AFTER ME LIKE A FAITHFUL FATHER WOULD GO AFTER ANY CHILD. AND I LOVE HIM FOR IT. OH, I thought he would just let me do anything. No, no, no, he won't. BUT HE GIVES US MORE AND MORE GRACE, POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT TO meet this evil tendency and all others fully. Do you believe that? Do you believe that? All others fully. Do you believe that Peter said you can reach a point where you never fall? You'll never be unfruitful. YOU'LL NEVER BE BARREN. OH, THAT'S THE LIFE I WANT. THAT'S THE LIFE I CRAVE. THAT'S MY WHOLE EVERYTHING. I'M I'M STRIVING FOR THAT. MY ONLY ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION COMES WHEN I FIND MYSELF SHORT OF THAT MARK. Oh my, you can tell this sermon has been rolling around in my soul for days. THAT IS WHY HE SAYS GOD SETS HIMSELF AGAINST THE PROUD AND HOTTY BUT GIVES GRACE HOW OFTEN continually to the lowly. Those who are humble enough to receive it. Those who are humble enough to receive it. See, that's what it means to humble yourself to the word of God. That's that's how sincerity is achieved because otherwise I MEAN IF IT'S NOT THAT then then sinc then be more you must you've got to be more sincere is a conundrum because wait a minute if I make myself sincere then that's not sincere and that's true you you'd just be you'd just be a blackbird trying to stick peacock feathers in your tail. Amen. SO, SO, SO THE PROPHET OF GOD WOULD JUST HAVE TO SAY, "LORD, VERY WELL. I AGREE. WHATEVER, WHATEVER NEEDS TO HAPPEN, THEN BRING IT. BRING IT. LET IT HAPPEN. MAKE ME, CAUSE ME TO BE WHATEVER THAT REQUIRES." SAY, "WHAT DOES IT REQUIRE IN MY LIFE? IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT REQUIRES OF ME. I MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF AN ISSUE THAN YOU, BUT GOD KNOWS US FROM TOP TO [screaming] BOTTOM." HALLELUJAH. I'M SO GLAD TO KNOW THAT. OH MY. Watch now. SO BE SUBJECT TO GOD. RESIST THE DEVIL. STAND FIRM AGAINST him and he will flee from you. See, SO THE KING JAMES SAYS, "SUBMIT yourselves to God. Resist the devil." You've heard me quote brother Bosworth many times that no one ever successfully resisted the devil until first they submitted themselves to God. Amen. Submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. One, two, three. A B C. Praise God. Not rocket science. It's ABCs. All right. All right. Wherefore, my brethren? Whoa, I'm in the wrong. What happened? Oh, here. Okay, we got to go back. We got to go back here. We got to go back one more. SO, BE SUBJECT TO GOD. RESIST THE DEVIL. STAND FIRM AGAINST HIM. LORD, HELP US TO stand firm against him. I JUST GOT TO STOP THERE AND SAY, "LORD, HELP ME RIGHT NOW." JUST SAY, "LORD, HELP ME TO STAND FIRM AGAINST HIM." HALLELUJAH. AND HE WILL FLEE FROM YOU. Come close to God. That's not hard, is it? You're doing it right now. COME CLOSE to God and he will come close to you. It's like, you know, Brother Ram said, "He careth you care." He'll care. Oh, does he care? But you got to care first. See, that's scripture. Come close to God and he will come close to you. Recognize that you ARE SINNERS. GET YOUR SOILED HANDS CLEAN. REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DISLOYAL, WAVERING INDIVIDUALS WITH DIVIDED INTEREST. I FEEL LIKE ROLLING around on the ground SAYING, "GOD, HAVE MERCY ON ME." WITH DIVIDED INTEREST. AND PURIFY YOUR HEARTS OF YOUR SPIRITUAL ADULTERY. WOW, THAT'S A STINGER. That's a stinger. BUT BUT IT BUT IT'S FOR OUR GOOD. YOU BELIEVE THAT IT'S FOR OUR GOOD. WATCH. AS YOU DRAW NEAR TO GOD, be deeply penitent and grieve. Even weep over your disloyalty. Let your laughter be turned to grief and your mirth to dejection and heartfelt shame for your sins. BROTHER BRANDON talks about he said can you imagine me you know of breaking a vow to my wife AND JUST COME TO HER in some nonchalant flippant way. Hey sweetheart uh UH LOVE OF MY HEART. HEY MY HEY OLD GIRL. HOW ABOUT IT? WHAT DO YOU SAY? FORGIVE ME. WHAT DO YOU SAY? COME ON. YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T MEAN IT. COME ON, OLD GIRL. Forgive me. And he said, she'd look at me like, "What has happened to my husband?" And he said, "WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO COME TO GOD, YOU NEED TO REALIZE WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO. THIS THING AIN'T SOME JUST CASUAL THING. IT'S NOT, LORD, I I SLIPPED UP. SORRY, PAL. IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT. IT'S IT'S GET DOWN ON MY KNEES. I I HAVE A PERSONAL BELIEF AND I I DON'T VIOLATE IT. I BELIEVE IF A MAN'S GOING TO REPENT, HE OUGHT TO BE ON HIS KNEES SOMEHOW, UNLESS HE CAN'T GET THERE." AMEN. IF YOU CAN'T FIND, YOU MIGHT BE IN A YOU MIGHT BE STANDING UP LOCKED IN CHAINS. I DON'T KNOW. BUT I I BELIEVE THAT IN YOUR HEART, YOU COULD BE KNEELING IN HUMILITY AND SAYING, "LORD, FORGIVE ME. FORGIVE ME. FORGIVE ME AND CLEANSE ME. CLEANSE ME. CLEANSE ME. SET ME [screaming] UP HIGHER. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN AGAIN." YEAH. SEE, SO HUMBLE YOURSELVES FEELING VERY INSIGNIFICANT in the presence of the Lord. Here's the good news. And he will exalt you. He will lift you up and make your lives significant. I think that's shocking. He will lift you up and he will make your lives significant. Amen. Sufficiency versus excellency. YOU REMEMBER THE STORY BROTHER BRADAM TELLS about in in South Africa and he was um I I think it was with one of one of the men there, one of the Oh, his brother brother Zadcliffe. He's with George Zadzcliffe. That's the guy I interviewed. wrote that book, A Prophet Visits South Africa. I interviewed him before he passed away to get the certainty of his accounting. And boy, was he ever certain. And and he he and and that he brother Brandham kept seeing these people who he had saw come into the meeting and receive Christ and it was for real. BUT HE SAW THEM IN TOWN OR IN THE BUSH carrying their idol. Yeah. Amen. He thought that's weird. And he says, "What? what's going on with that? He says, he says, "Well, Brother Brandham, let's go ask him." And so they, HERE'S ONE WALKING ACROSS AND THEY come up, they recognize him as being in the service. Excuse me, sir. Weren't you in the service? Yes. Thank you. The word was wonderful. Well, Brother Vim is saying, "Well, I'm just wondering." He said, "I I noticed that you accepted the Lord Jesus." Yes. Praise God. Hallelujah. I have Jesus in my heart. He says, "Well, then why are you carrying your idol?" And the the man very honestly said, "Well, if a lion comes after me in the bush, he said, "If if Jesus fails, then I will build a a a sacred fire to my idol, and he will protect me from the lion." And brother Brandham said, "Look, the only thing protecting you from the lion is the fire. You're building a fire, and that's why he won't come after you. Has nothing to do with that piece of wood." Amen. But but the problem was that that you know IT WAS IT WAS KIND OF LIKE YOU KNOW I I I FIND THAT THAT SATAN IS ALWAYS WORKING. HE'S ALWAYS WORKING TO TO CLOSE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN your reasoning and your faith. Now they ought to be miles apart. THEY OUGHT TO BE SO FAR APART YOU DON'T EVEN OPERATE IN REASONING WHEN IT COMES TO God's word. AMEN. IF I'M GOING TO CLIMB A LADDER, I'M GOING TO USE REASONING. BUT IF I'M GOING TO BELIEVE GOD'S PROMISE, I GOT TO GET AWAY FROM REASONING. SEE, SO SATAN IS ALWAYS WORKING TO CLOSE THAT DISTANCE. HE'S ALWAYS TRYING TO INSERT LINKAGE UH UH BETWEEN THEM. AND HE DOES THIS TO TO LIMIT YOUR FAITH FROM, YOU KNOW, TO TO OPERATING AS IT WERE O ONLY YOUR HE WANTS TO LIMIT YOUR FAITH TO ONLY OPERATE THE PROMISES OF GOD THAT ARE REASONABLE, the ones that make sense to you. And then you SAY, "YEAH, I GOT FAITH IN THAT ONE. I'm not so sure." You got a lot of reasoning. I'm not so sure if you have faith. SEE, LIKE JUST LIKE THE NATIVE, IF JESUS FAILS, WELL, I ALWAYS HAVE MY IDOL. WELL, IF JESUS FAILS, WELL, I ALWAYS HAVE MY MEDICINE AND I ALWAYS HAVE DOCTORS. IF JES I'M NOT AGAINST DOCTORS AND MEDICINE. I USE BOTH OF THEM IF I need to. Brother Brandham said God gave us that. It's a it's it's God's compassion for suffering humanity trapped in sin and he's got diseases and the devil's trying to wipe out humanity. So, God gives him doctors and medicine. Don't be afraid of that. See, BUT BUT ONCE WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WHEN IT GETS BEYOND MEDICINE AND BEYOND A DOCTOR? SEE, OH, I YOU KNOW, IF IF JESUS FAILS, WELL, I GOT PLENTY OF MONEY IN MY BANK. Why don't you just go ahead and get you an idol? Well, you know, IF IF JESUS FAILS, WELL, I I I I GOT THIS REALLY LUCRATIVE OPPORTUNITY OF A JOB, A CAREER, YOU KNOW, AN INVESTMENT. I GOT THIS, I GOT THAT. YOU KNOW, I I I I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS, THAT I CAN'T RECONCILE WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT. THOSE AT THE END TIME WHO KNOW THEIR GOD WILL DO GREAT EXPLOITS. I CAN'T RECONCILE GREAT EXPLOITS WITH SUFFICIENCY. GREAT EXPLOITS SEEMS LIKE EXCELLENCY TO ME. I CAN'T I CAN'T GET IT IN MY MIND THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO AROUND OPERATING EXPLOITS OF GOD, JUST OPERATING AS SOME MEDIOCRE, BARELY MAKING THE GRADE. OH, I'M SO DONE WITH BARELY MAKING THE GRADE. I GOT SO DONE WITH THAT YEARS AGO IN MY LIFE. AND SINCE THEN, I'VE BEEN ON A QUEST. I'VE BEEN ON A QUEST TO GO BEYOND IT AND SAY, "LORD, WHEN I GET BEYOND THAT LEVEL, I WANT TO GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND THE NEXT LEVEL." SAY, "HOW HIGH DO YOU WANT TO GO?" I DON'T KNOW. ENOCH WENT ALL THE WAY TO HEAVEN. AMEN. AMEN. BUT I CAN'T RECONCILE GREAT EXPLOITS with mediocrity. No way. SO PAUL SAYS HERE, watch this. NOW PAUL SAYS IN ROMANS 7, "WHEREFORE MY BRETHREN, ye also ARE BECOME DEAD TO THE LAW BY THE BODY OF CHRIST. THAT YE SHOULD that ye should BE MARRIED TO ANOTHER, EVEN TO HIM WHO IS RAISED FROM THE DEAD." THAT WE SHOULD HERE'S WHY. THAT WE SHOULD BRING FORTH FRUIT UNTO GOD. I I'M NOT MARRIED TO A DEAD DENOMINATIONAL HUSBAND. AMEN. YOU WONDER WHY THEY DON'T BRING FORTH THE FRUITS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS? BECAUSE IT'S A DEAD HUSBAND. UH YOU DON'T THERE'S NO WIFE IN HERE WHO'S GOING TO BRING FORTH FRUIT OF A MARRIAGE UNION FROM A DEAD HUSBAND. HE'S GOT TO BE ALIVE. YOU UNDERSTAND? AND THAT AND AND THAT'S WHY PAUL IS [screaming] SAYING NOW YOU'RE YOU'RE FREE FROM THE LAW. YOU'RE FREE FROM SIN TO BE MARRIED TO ANOTHER. THAT'S CHRIST. SO THAT YOU CAN BRING FORTH FRUIT OF HIS LIFE. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN. THAT'S WHY THE HOLY GHOST CAME. THAT'S WHY THERE'S A MESSAGE. AMEN. OH MY. FOR WHEN WATCH HIM think back. He's going to think back with you. Think back with Paul here. This is sensible. For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. Yeah. Amen. I need some more nods. Amen. Look at your neighbor and go, it's true. I That's true. I remember that. I USED TO BE THAT. YES, BUT I BUT I'M NOT I'M NOT THAT ANYMORE. I'M UP HERE. I'M TRYING TO BRING FORTH FRUIT UNTO GOD JUST LIKE I BROUGHT FORTH FRUIT UNTO DEATH. IF I DID IT FOR DEATH, WHY WOULD I THINK I CAN'T BRING IT FOR LIFE? SEE, WATCH. BUT NOW, NOW WE ARE DELIVERED FROM THE LAW THAT BEING DEAD WHEREIN WE WERE HELD. SEE, YOU HAD no freedom. You had no choice. You thought it was a choice. You had no choice. you were held that we should serve in newness of spirit AND NOT IN THE OLDNESS of the letter. Amen. See, I I WENT BACK AND PULLED I DON'T KNOW IF I EVER READ THIS particular I've read every once in a while I'll read uh uh uh some verses out of my own translation when I re-ransated the book of Romans or the most part of it. Anyway, here is the those two three verses from the translation I did some years ago. So, this is the point. Death ended your relation to the law because YOU DIED TO ITS POWER when you DIED WITH CHRIST ON THE CROSS. AND NOW YOU HAVE A SPIRITUAL UNION WITH CHRIST WHO RAISED FROM THE DEAD AND YOU WITH HIM. GLORY. HALLELUJAH. AS A RESULT, [screaming] YOU CAN REPRODUCE THE FULL LIFE OF GOD. GOOD NEWS. You can produce the full LIFE OF GOD. FOR WHEN WE WERE SAY, IS ARE IS THAT RIGHT? WELL, JUST JUST LOOK AT THE FLIP SIDE. FOR WHEN WE WERE CONTROLLED by the SINFUL NATURE, THE SINFUL PASSIONS AND APPETITES AROUSED BY THE LAW WERE AT WORK IN OUR BODIES. YEP. SO THAT WE BORE FRUIT UNDER DEATH. YEP. WELL, IF THAT'S TRUE, THEN THE THE TOP VERSE IS TRUE. SEE? SO PAUL CONCLUDES, "BUT NOW THAT WE HAVE DIED WITH CHRIST, HAVE YOU DIED WITH CHRIST?" THE LAW WHEREIN WE WERE HELD FAST HAS LOST ITS [screaming] HOLD UPON US SO THAT WE ARE NO LONGER I WANT THE DEVIL TO HEAR THAT I'M NO LONGER IN THE OLD BONDAGE OF THE LETTER, BUT IN THE NEW SERVICE OF THE SPIRIT. I CAN HAVE EXCELLENCY. I DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN MEDIOCRITY. SEE, it's not necessary anymore. When we read in our Bibles that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter, I wonder sometimes. Now, let me just get real close. Is that okay? I wonder sometimes if the devil can get us to a point where we just feel resigned to failure. I just have this thing I can't get past, Brother Jason. I keep falling to it over and over again. I I can never reach those heights of great exploits. You will get there. I'm sorry I made that sound like an encouragement, but it's a warning. You will get there. You've already been called to it by the word. And the word never fails. The Holy Ghost always gets his man. You can run. You actually can. But you can't hide. See, I agree, Brother Joe. I just say, "Thank you, Lord." Amen. The first thing that God may need to show you here tonight, even in this service, is just how sure he is that he will get you there. One of Satan's primary goals for God's family, this family who's now free from the law, one of his primary goals for God's family, devastating to your operation of perfect faith, is to get you to doubt. get you to doubt that all of your mistakes in life are met fully in the death, burial, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. He's always trying to defeat you there. If he can defeat you there, you'll never get on up the ladder. You'll never move on up the pyramid. You'll never You'll be so discouraged. if he can just hold you right there. But but but we find that THAT THE HOLY GHOST WHOSE PRIMARY work in in THIS LIFE IN YOUR LIFE AS HE AS HE MOVES WITH YOU THROUGH LIFE, HIS PRIMARY WORKING is to continually LEAD YOU AND GUIDE YOU INTO ALL TRUTH. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? AND AS SUCH, THE SPIRIT IS CONSTANTLY, THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS CONSTANTLY TRYING TO DISTANCE YOU FROM YOUR REASONING. SATAN IS ALWAYS TRYING TO BRING REASONING AND FAITH TOGETHER. THE HOLY GHOST IS ALWAYS TRYING TO LEAD YOU TO TRUTH AND GET YOU [screaming] AWAY FROM REASONING. GET YOU TO BELIEVE THE WORD OF GOD. THE ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE BUT TRUE PROMISE OF THE GOSPEL IS THAT ALL YOUR FAILURES, PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE, HAVE INDEED BEEN FULLY AND COMPLETELY ABSORBED AND MET IN THE DEATH, BURIAL, AND RESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. THEY HAVE EVERYONE PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE, EVEN THE ONES YOU HAVEN'T STUMBLED AT YET, ARE COMPLETELY DISCHARGED IN THE TRIUMPH OF CHRIST OVER SATAN. AND YOU GOT TO GET THAT FIRST TONIGHT AND SAY, "I BELIEVE THAT, AND I'M NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THAT I [screaming] HAVE TO BE A FAILURE, AND I'M NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME. I I AM FREE FROM THAT. HALLELUJAH. SO COMPLETE WAS HIS VICTORY. I I I [screaming] THOUGHT ABOUT THIS, YOU KNOW, TODAY AS I WAS WRITING THESE NOTES. I THOUGHT SO complete a victory. So total THAT HE LITERALLY HOLDS the keys of death, hell itself, and the grave. Amen. Brother Brown said he Satan don't have keys to his own house. that Jesus completely triumphed over him. WE'RE TALKING COMPLETELY THAT HE LEFT NO SO FINAL IS YOUR VICTORY IN CHRIST THAT [screaming] NO CONDEMNATION OF YOU BEFORE GOD IS EVEN POSSIBLE. [screaming] THAT'S HOW COMPLETE YOUR VICTORY IS TONIGHT. THAT'S [screaming] HOW THOROUGHLY CHRIST DEFEATED SATAN. AND YOU NEED TO GET THAT AND OWN IT AND SAY AND SAY, "IN CHRIST, I AM WEAK, BUT HE IS STRONG. IN [screaming] CHRIST, I CAN DO ALL THINGS THROUGH CHRIST WHO STRENGTHENS ME. I DON'T HAVE TO BE A VICTIM OF THE DEVIL ANYMORE. THERE WAS A DAY I COULDN'T PREVENT IT, BUT NOW [screaming] I'M FREE. I'M IN THE LIBERTY OF THE LOVE OF GOD." AMEN. HALLELUJAH. YOU KNOW, GOD SPOKE TO Job [snorts] and then he very very much like I was thinking about one of the ways that God spoke to Job very much like the way he spoke to brother Brandham in those Kentucky woods with the you know he's he's asking him a question with the answer hidden in the question you know you know and brother Brandon can't figure out Mark 11 until finally the Lord just start brother Rams is like losing it and finally the Lord just says okay you are so hung up on you're worried it's going to be you operating it and you can't figure out how that's under the covenant. Okay, I'm going to ask you a question and the answer is hidden within the question. When you know the secrets of people's hearts, you think that's you. All those miracles that are happening, you think that's you doing that? You think ALL OF THOSE PROPHECIES AND THUS SAYETH THE LORD AND THEY all come to pass perfectly, you really think that's you doing it? And brother Brandham saw the answer. No, it's not me. It's him. It's always been him. Amen. See, I mean, YOU KNOW, THE THE BIZARRE WAY OF ASKING, OF COURSE, IS IT'S NOT WITHOUT ITS PURPOSE, YOU KNOW, BE BECAUSE IT IT WHAT IT DOES IS IT IT MAKES ROOM FOR THE OPERATION of divine revelation. AND THAT'S WHAT GOD'S AFTER CUZ HE'S NOT JUST TRYING TO CONVINCE YOUR HEAD. HE'S TRYING TO GET A REALITY DOWN INSIDE YOUR HEART. YOU'LL FORGET WHAT'S IN YOUR HEAD. YOU'LL DOUBT IT. THAT'S WHERE REASONING IS. GOD'S TRYING TO COME DOWN INTO YOUR HEART. I STAND HERE TONIGHT AND MY HEAD KNOWS I'M I'M PROBABLY NOT EVEN WORTHY TO STAND HERE, BUT MY HEART KNOWS I LOVE GOD. MY HEART KNOWS HE LOVES ME. MY HEAD WOULD SAY, "BUT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN KICKED ASIDE." THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE, BUT HE LOVES ME. AND MY HEART TELLS ME THAT GOD COULD SAY TO ME, HE COULD SAY TO YOU TONIGHT, "DO YOU THINK THAT WAS YOU WHO CAME OUT [screaming] OF THAT BARROOM AND DECIDED TO BE A CHRISTIAN? DO YOU THINK THAT WAS YOU WHO ONE NIGHT YOU FELL AT AN ALTAR AND YOU GAVE YOUR WHOLE [screaming] HEART? YOU THINK YOU DID THAT? NO, LORD. THAT WAS YOUR GRACE ON MY LIFE. TRACKED ME DOWN. SEE, IT MAKES ROOM FOR THE OPERATION OF DIVINE REVELATION WHERE YOU LITERALLY COME TO THE ANSWER BY FOCUSING ON THE QUESTION. THAT'S WHAT GOD DID TO JOB. Job just lamenting everything AND GOD JUST HE'S GONNA HE'S GOING TO GIVE HIM A REVELATION. And Job, where were you when morning stars sang together and sons of God shouted for joy? Amen. Job, you really think you started here? You really think this life is about this life? You really don't remember, do you? When morning STARS SANG TOGETHER, JOB, you were there. YOU'LL BE THERE AGAIN. YOU CAN'T NOT BE THERE BECAUSE YOU WERE ALREADY THERE. YOU ALREADY MADE YOUR DECISION LONG AGO. YOU MADE A DECISION. YOU DECIDED AGAINST LUCIFER AND [screaming] YOU SIDED WITH MICHAEL AND THAT SEALED YOUR ETERNAL DESTINATION BEFORE YOU EVER CAME INTO THE EARTH AS A HUMAN BEING. SO, OH, LET LIFE COME WITH ITS UPS AND DOWNS. LET IT HAVE ITS ITS ITS DISAPPOINTMENTS. BUT I KNOW MY REDEEMER LIVING. [laughter] HALLELUJAH. NOTHING CAN KEEP ME HERE. HALLELUJAH. LIKE I SAID TO YOU SUNDAY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE ALIVE FOR A [screaming] LONG TIME. AMEN. THIS LIFE IS MEAN, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THAT THIS LIFE MEANS VERY little once you start realizing God's great purpose and that you're a part of it. The stress, the pressure, the anxiety of present distresses, we get them, don't we? Oh, yeah. Amen. I don't I'm not standing here tonight under any certain particular one. You may not may may not be maybe somebody is I'm I'm not aware that but that's beside the point that doesn't change the principle of God's word that the stress or whatever it is or pressure that WE GO THROUGH. REMEMBER I SAID TO YOU YOU'RE GOING TO BE THERE AND THAT'S NOT AN ENCOURAGEMENT. That's a warning. That's a warning. SEE, BECAUSE GOD KNOWS HOW TO GET YOU THERE. HIS WORD HAS ALREADY FORESEEN IT AND IT'S COMING TO PASS. You're literally living out prophecy, YOU KNOW, AND BECAUSE WHETHER IT'S STRESS, WHETHER IT'S PRESSURE, WHETHER IT'S ANXIETY, NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF DISTRESS IT IS, YOU KNOW, BUT BUT YOU YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT IT IS THE ANXIETY AND THE PRESSURE THAT WE ARE UNDER THAT LITERALLY RELEASES THE WORD OF GOD TO GO TO WORK. AMEN. DO DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID PAUL KEPT SAYING LORD HEAL MY EYES AND THE LORD WILL HEAL HIM? He get devil put it back ON HIM. LORD HEAL MY AND THE LORD WILL HEAL HIM. DEVIL PUT IT BACK ON HIM. LORD PLEASE HELP ME. THE LORD WILL HEAL HIM AND THE DEVIL PUT IT BACK ON HIM. AND THE LORD PLEASE HEAL ME AGAIN. FINALLY BROTHER SAID GOD JUST SAID Paul my grace alone all by itself that's sufficient. THAT'S REALLY ALL YOU NEED. YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT ALL THIS STUFF. AND BROTHER R SAID, WHEN PAUL CAUGHT THAT, HE SAID, "WELL, THEN I WILL [screaming] GLORY IN MY AFFLICTION. FOR WHEN I'M WEAK, I'M STRONG." THAT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS. WHEN YOU'RE WEAK, YOU'RE STRONG. WHAT DOES IT EVEN MEAN? UH BECAUSE [screaming] WHEN I'M WEAK, THEN HE'S IN CHARGE. AND WHEN HE'S IN CHARGE, THERE'S NOT ENOUGH DEVILS TO STOP ME CUZ THEY COULDN'T STOP HIM. [screaming] SO LITERALLY THE THE DISTRESSES THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT RELEASE. DON'T LAMENT THAT. DON'T DON'T LET THE DEVIL BEAT YOU ALL OVER THE PLACE WITH THAT. YOU UNDERSTAND FRIENDS? THAT'S WHY PETER SAID, "DON'T EVEN THINK OF FIERY TRIALS. IT'S NOT UNFAIRNESS. IT'S GOD'S LOVE. GOD RICH IN MERCY." EVEN JESUS LEARNED OBEDIENCE. AMEN. By the things he suffered. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT REALLY RELEASE THE POWER IN THE WORD for the hour that we live in. You release it. You release God's power in his word because your distress brings a desperation. And desperation is a manufacturing plant that produces one thing, faith. Amen. Hallelujah. And brother BRANDHAM SAYS IT'S TOO BAD THAT WE CAN'T, you know, MAKE OURSELVES DESPERATE. LIKE YOU THINK, MAN, I'LL JUST I'LL JUST TURN THAT FACTORY ON. AND I'LL JUST GET DESPERATE AND PRODUCE ALL THE FAITH I NEED. IT JUST DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT. YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE A LOWLY HUMAN. SO, GOD HAS TO COME DOWN WITH DISTRESS AND STRESS AND PRESENT DISTRESSES AND ANXIETIES AND TROUBLES AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS. WHY? BECAUSE THEN YOU START FEELING A DESPERATION. AND WHEN YOU START FEELING A DESPERATION, THE WHEELS OF FAITH START TURNING AND YOU LITERALLY BEGIN TO CALL ON GOD'S WORD. AND NOW YOU YOU BECOME THE ONE WHO'S CALLING THE WORD INTO ACTION. AMEN. AND THAT IS GOD'S DESIGN. [screaming] SEE, YOU RELEASE IT. THAT'S EXACTLY GOD'S design and allowing the trial in the first place. THAT'S GOD'S DESIGN IN ALLOWING THE HARDSHIP. SEE, and I want to SAY TO YOU TONIGHT that he won't allow you to avoid it. Amen. Or go around it. So, I want to say to you tonight, take courage because you're gaining. I don't care what might be happening to you tonight or what might be happening to me tomorrow. We're gaining. I didn't I DIDN'T SAY THE TRIAL IS NOT HARD. I'm not MINIMALIZING YOUR TRIAL. I'M NOT I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE NOT SUFFERING. WHAT I'M SAYING IS YOU ARE GAINING. AMEN. OH, IF I I I I COULD JUST ALMOST CLOSE RIGHT THERE AND JUST SAY THIS IS THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY TO YOU TONIGHT IS YOU'RE GAINING. YOU'RE WINNING. THE WORLD THINKS THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS. THEY HAVE KNOWN NOTHING ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO WIN OR TO GAIN. I'VE WON THE GREATEST PRIZE. I FOUND A PEARL OF GREAT PRIZE. I FOUND ETERNAL LIFE. I FOUND EVERYTHING. HALLELUJAH. SEE, IT'S GOD'S CONFIDENCE IN YOU. CAN YOU ACCEPT THAT? AMEN. FRIENDS, I brought this sermon to you tonight to say that I want I want and I hope you want with me. I want to excel. Amen. I want the position of the first resurrection. I want to go in the rapture. Amen. Amen. Does that shock you? It shouldn't SHOCK ANYBODY. I WANT TO GO IN THE RAPTURE. I WANT TO BE ALIVE AND REMAIN WHEN THE SAINTS COME BACK. I WANT TO LIVE IN THAT NEW CITY. I WANT TO BE A PART OF THE ROYAL FAMILY. I'M SORRY IF THE WORLD THINKS THAT'S SELFISH. IT'S NOT. I'M TRYING TO TAKE EVERYBODY WITH ME. I CAN. WHOEVER WILL COME ALONG WITH ME. COME ON. COME ALONG. [screaming] HOW MANY WANT TO COME ALONG WITH ME TODAY? OH, THOSE ARE [screaming] MY GOALS. BUT LISTEN FRIENDS, I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS TODAY. THOSE ARE MY GOALS FOR THERE. TH THAT'S WHAT I LONG TO ENJOY in that new world. But I long to experience these high realities of the living God now. Right now IN MY LIFE, I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE REWARD. I'M GRATEFUL THAT MY FUTURE IS BRIGHT. LET ME TELL YOU, I DON'T CARE WHAT'S HAPPENING. IF YOU'RE A BELIEVER IN THE WORD, YOUR FUTURE IS BRIGHT. YOUR FUTURE IS ALREADY SECURED. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. AND I I SO I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MY FUTURE. WHAT I GOT TO DO IS SAY, LORD, I WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT GROUP DOING GREAT EXPLOITS. I WANT TO HAVE EXCELLENCY. I WANT TO I WANT TO SUPERABOUND. I WANT TO EXPERIENCE THEM. I WANT TO KNOW HIM IN THE POWER OF HIS DEATH AND RESURRECTION. I want to be related to that ram caught in the thicket. Amen. I remember years ago the Lord just just a young minister and I began to study that and I just thought, "Wow, there's so much types and symbols there and I began to search through the message and cross reference scripture and break down. I remember is when I had my very first Hebrew and Greek uh Bible and and I would study from it and I and brother Brandham would would go into that ram because it was a perfect it was perfectly Christ and and because Abraham remember we preached on that Abraham needed a sacrifice other than his son and God and he said God shall provide himself a sacrifice and literally it was a spoken word creation. And if you'll notice, I remember I remember years ago when I was looking at that and I I began to break down the the types because because you remember that he's caught by his his horns right in the in the thicket and the the the the word the Hebrew word first of all the horns meant his strength. The horns of a ram are his strength. Brother Ram talks about that the the horns are the strength. AND AND SO AND WHAT IS THE STRENGTH? IT WAS CHRIST. SO WHAT'S THE STRENGTH OF CHRIST? HIS CHARACTER. WHAT KEPT HIM ON THE CROSS? HIS CHARACTER. You think THAT THOSE PEOPLE COULD HAVE KEPT HIM THERE? HE SAID, "DON'T YOU KNOW I COULD PRESENTLY RIGHT NOW CALL FOR 12 LEGIONS OF ANGELS AND MY HEAVENLY FATHER WOULD SEND HIM. HE'D DESTROY THE WHOLE WORLD AND START OVER WITH ME. AMEN. NO MAN TAKES MY LIFE. I LAY IT DOWN. I WILL PICK IT UP. BUT WHAT HELD HIM ON THAT? WHAT WHAT THEY SAID, "COME DOWN AND SAVE YOURSELF AND SAVE US." BUT WHAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW IS WHAT HE KNEW THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW IS THAT IF HE CAME DOWN, HE COULD SAVE HIMSELF, BUT HE COULDN'T SAVE THEM. AND HE WANTED TO SAVE ME AND HE WANTED TO SAVE [screaming] YOU. AND HIS CHARACTER HELD HIM THERE. NO ONE COULD FORCE HIM TO STAY THERE. OH, NATURE WOULD HAVE RELEASED HIM. HALLELUJAH. SEE, BUT SO HIS HORNS WERE HIS CHARACTER AND THAT'S WHAT HE WAS CAUGHT BY. AMEN. AND THE THICKET THAT THE HORNS WERE CAUGHT IN, IT'S A HEBREW WORD THAT MEANS LIKE IT'S IT'S LIKE ME, LIKE MESH, LIKE WEAVING, LIKE A BASKET, LIKE THEY WEAVE. IT'S LIKE MESHED TOGETHER AND WEAVE. YOU SEE, WHEN HE CAME TO MELZDC, ALL HE DID WAS TAKE SOME SOIL, GRABBED SOME COSMIC LIGHT, SOME POT ASH, SOME CALCIUM, AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID HE BLEW A BODY AND STEPPED INTO IT AND went and MET ABRAHAM AND BLEW ANOTHER BODY, ANOTHER BODY, AND HERE'S HIS ANGELS. AND THEY GO WALKING DOWN AND AND WHEN WHEN AND WHEN HE WAS DONE WITH THAT BODY, HE JUST STEPPED BACK OUT OF IT, DISASSEMBLED IT BACK TO ITS PARTS. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "WE DON'T NEVER HEAR NO MORE ABOUT MELZDC BECAUSE HE BECAME JESUS CHRIST." BUT JESUS DIDN'T JUST IT WASN'T LIKE HE COULD JUST STEP IN A BODY AND STEP OUT. HE WAS THE ONLY BEGOTTEN. HE WAS BORN OF A WOMAN. HE HAD CRISSCROSSED HIMSELF. GOD [screaming] CROSSED HIMSELF WITH HUMANITY AND HE COULDN'T JUST STEP OUT OF IT. HE SAID, "IT'S WRITTEN IN THE BOOK CONCERNING ME. I HAVE COME TO DO THY WILL, OH LORD. I'M NOT GOING TO EVACUATE. I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE. I'M NOT GOING TO DESERT MY FAMILY. I'M GOING TO [screaming] CALVARY. I'M GOING TO JERUSALEM." AND THEY'LL THEY'LL THEY'LL CRUCIFY ME. LORD, IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN TO YOU. GET BEHIND ME. [screaming] NOTHING'S GOING TO STOP ME FROM GIVING MY LIFE. HE WAS CAUGHT BY HIS HORNS AND THE THICKET. His character as a man held him there and he he didn't want to die as a human. See, surrendering to God, like brother Brandham says, you got to be neutral. If you want to know the will of God, important matters, get neutral. Yeah. Before you pray, pray to get neutral. Because otherwise, if you're not neutral, you'll pray leaning toward your desire. Amen. And you can't help it. Yeah. So he said first you got to get neutral. That's what Jesus did. Neutrality doesn't mean the absence of will cuz Jesus said not my will. Yeah. He had a will. Brother Brham said he was young. He wanted to live. He had his brother and he didn't want to die a cruel, horrible death. He loved life. He loved his father. He loved doing miracles. But but but he comes and he SAYS IF IT'S POSSIBLE LET IT PASS. IT'S NOT POSSIBLE. Very well. Then not my will today I surrender. That's what Gethsemane was all about. Friends what we need is a fresh Gethsemane. We talk about following him to Calvary. You understand that starts with Gethsemane. That's where you got to surrender and say, "Lord, no more me. I just want you. I'm done with me. I just want to be you." And whatever it takes, Lord God, you were held to that cross by your character. Nobody could have brought you down. The Bible said he will see his seed and be satisfied. When he was ON THE CROSS, I WAS ON HIS MIND. WHEN HE WAS ON THE CROSS, YOU [screaming] WERE ON HIS MIND. Oh my. I want to say tonight that my life is written. It's written in the scrolls concerning me. It's written in the scrolls concerning you. Your your liberty tonight is to say, "I have come to do thy will, oh God." Amen. That's real freedom. Give me liberty or give me death. If I can't have the liberty to say whatever is written in the scrolls concerning me, I have come to do thy will for me. There's no other purpose in life. That's right. Yep. I'll I'll pay bills and I'll take vacations and I'll preach the gospel and I'll buy new vehicles, but none of that stuff matters. It's all going to ash and cinder. You understand? It's all going to ash and cinder. I'm not worried about an idol if Jesus fails. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT A DOCTOR OR A BANK ACCOUNT IF JESUS FAILS. JESUS WON'T FAIL. HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE LEFT HOLDING THE BAG. YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ASHAMED. THE BIBLE SAYS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE EMBARRASSED AT THE END TIME, FRIENDS. HALLELUJAH. OH, my life is written in the word. For me, there is no curtain be. It's just whatever's written about me in the word. Let me finish right here. Brother Brandham, being a human being, you remember how that he he said to the Lord, he said, you know, I'm I've been preaching this long. I've went around the world and people's rejected my message. And look, I I just want to can I just go back into the mountains? You said I was a prophet. Everybody said I'm a prophet. I've never called myself that. But the people have called me that. And I know what you said on the river. And I know the commission. I know I I know what I'm called to do. But you called me to be a prophet. So I just want to go into the wilderness. And listen, if you have something you want to tell the people, just come tell me. And I'll stomp out of the wilderness like Elijah and I'll go tell the people. And then I'll go back to my trapping and my fishing and my hunting. I just want to be left alone. See, don't don't deny William Brandham being a human. Don't deny him the privilege of being a human. See, that's why that deity spirit is so acidic. That's why it's so poisonous. It takes away a a God-given privilege to say, just like David, Lord, remember I am but dust. You don't know how many times that's been my refuge when I couldn't think of anything else to say to explain my terrible weakness. I just say, "Lord, remember I'm but dust." And David said that and you honored it, so I'm saying it, too. Oh my. AND HE HE WHAT WHAT DID HE WANT? HE HE ACTUALLY HE HE WANTED TO LIVE A noble and sufficient life of a prophet. Just a just a sufficient barely making the grade. I'm already tired and worn out. I just want to go into the wilderness and I just want to be a sufficient prophet's life. But God told him, God didn't deny his reasoning because he said, "Look, they did that. Elijah did that. They all did that. Isaiah, Jeremiah, they lived. Micah, they lived out there." And you'd send them, they'd come in with a message and go back. They didn't have to constantly, you know, fend off these things. But the Lord said to him, "But you have been called to more than that. Amen. So no, YOU CAN'T JUST GO BE A SUFFICIENT PROPHET. AMEN. NO, BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN CALLED TO MORE than that. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THAT THAT WOULD ALMOST WHAT BROTHER BRANDON WAS ESSENTIALLY SAYING WOULD BE LIKE AS IF I SAID, "LORD, you know, living at the level of a bride, [sighs] man, the world is 2023 and oh my goodness, it's so difficult. How about this, Lord? How about you just let me live like a foolish virgin and I'll get eternal life at the judgment bar?" And okay, you know, you know what the Lord would say to me? But you've been called to more than that. DO YOU UNDERSTAND TONIGHT? YOU CAN'T GIVE GOD SOME SAD, SORRY TO SAY, I'M JUST TOO TIRED. I CAN'T PRESS ON. AND THE LORD WOULD SAY BACK TO YOU, THAT MIGHT BE FINE FOR OTHERS. BUT YOU HAVE BEEN CALLED TO MORE THAN THAT. YOUNG PEOPLE, YOU'VE BEEN CALLED TO MORE THAN THAT. YOU'RE NOT HERE TO [screaming] JUST TO JUST BE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND HAVE LIKES AND FRIENDS. YOU'VE BEEN CALLED TO MORE THAN THAT. WE'VE BEEN CALLED HIGHER AS A CHURCH. WE'VE BEEN CALLED HIGHER AS A MINISTRY TEAM. WE'VE BEEN CALLED MORE [screaming] AS SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. AND I WANT I DON'T WANT MEDIOCRITY. I DON'T WANT SUFFICIENCY. I WANT EXCELLENCY. I WANT TO PRESS TOWARD THE MARK OF A HIGH CALLING. THERE'S A GREAT PRIZE THERE. OH, I'VE BEEN CALLED TO A HIGHER ORDER. ONE THAT CAN FILL ME WITH ALL THE FULLNESS OF HIM, WITH ALL OF his knowledge, with all of his character, with all of his power and order. And and and I just tell you something, friends. I I JUST SAY TONIGHT THAT I'M WILLING to press harder. I'm willing to fight longer. I'm willing to live higher. How many are in here TONIGHT WITH ME SAY, "I'LL TAKE THAT WAY. I'M WILLING TO PRESS HARDER. I'M WILLING TO FIGHT LONGER. I'M TIRED, [screaming] BUT I'M GOING TO FIGHT ON. I'M I'M WEARY, BUT I'M GOING TO PRESS THE BATTLE. I'M GOING TO LIVE HIGHER. I'M GOING TO LIVE HIGHER TODAY THAN I DID YESTERDAY AND TOMORROW. I'M GOING TO LIVE HIGHER STILL. HALLELUJAH. ARE [screaming] WE WILLING, FRIENDS, EVERY ONE OF US IN HERE TONIGHT TO SAY, "I'M WILLING TO DO IT, LORD GOD. I'M WILLING TO CARRY THE EXTRA WEIGHT AND THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT IT REQUIRES." Are we willing to You say, "I DON'T I DON'T KNOW, PASTOR. I DON'T REALLY KNOW IF I'M WILLING TO DO THAT. THEN THEN ARE YOU WILLING TO BOW YOUR HEAD WITH ME RIGHT now all across this building? Are you willing to ask the Lord to make you willing? Are you willing tonight to say, "Lord, very well, make me more sincere. Make me more sincere, Lord. Make me willing, OH GOD, TONIGHT. MAKE ME, LORD, MAKE THIS AUDIENCE, FATHER, HANDS UP GOING OVER THE BUILDING. LET'S STAND UP TO OUR FEET, FRIENDS. LET'S RAISE UP HANDS TO HIM RIGHT NOW AND SAY, "LORD GOD, I I WANT TO BE WILLING, LORD. SOMETIMES I I FEEL MAYBE I'M NOT WILLING TO PAY THAT [screaming] PRICE OR BEAR THAT RESPONSIBILITY. SO, I'M ASKING YOU, MAKE ME MORE WILLING, OH GOD, MAKE ME MORE SINCERE. FATHER, HELP ME. GIVE ME A FRESH STRENGTH TO HAVE A FRESH SURRENDER." OH, may you grant it to us, Lord, tonight. We're just humble people. Oh friends, why don't you just raise up a hand to him? Say, "Lord, we're but dust tonight." But Lord, we're called. It's written and [clears throat] my life is recorded in the scrolls. IT'S WRITTEN ABOUT ME. I CAN'T ESCAPE IT. I'M HERE TO DO thy will, oh God. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Thank you, Father. Thank you for these honest hearts tonight. Is there another tonight? Anybody want to raise their hand? Say, "Lord, remember me, preacher. Remember me, pastor." Ask God to give it to me too. Hallelujah. God bless you friends. God bless you. You know I I remember Come musicians. Come please. I remember uh one of the brothers on our our call-in. I think it was brother Joshua I believe. Tremendous brother, tremendous preacher. I want to try to get him down here sometime. And he was talking about he made an astonishing statement. He says llukewarmness can be a great place to be in what? And he said because you see he said that's where God can come and get a hold of your heart and lift you up out of there and make you want to come up higher. So I thought to myself, wow, that being the case, then the devil really can't win. He really can't win. Even if he pulls me down into low altitudes, you know all that'll do? That'll just turn me and I'll start crying out to God because there's something down inside of me. I wonder if there's a witness here tonight. Say, there's something won't let me live in those low altitudes. I'm an eagle. I got to soar high. I got to feel the breezes. I got to fly into the sun. Oh, I got to feel those currents under my wings. I I I wasn't born to live here uh a a as dumb driven cattle of the earth. God has called us to more than that. I thought about Abraham looking for that city. Brother Brandon said he didn't even know right where he was building his altar. It was just above him. Amen. It was just above him. You know, tonight a lot of times we can find ourselves in a low estate. And I I don't I I fully don't know fully why I'm preaching this sermon tonight. Maybe it's somebody in this building. Maybe it's somebody on the stream. Maybe it's somebody on archive. Maybe it's all of the above. Amen. I'd like to think it's all of the above starting right here. And and maybe we all need to have a fresh realization. Listen, that joy you've been looking for, it's just above you. [sighs] That peace you've been wanting. Like you're like Abraham. You're offering a sacrifice. You're praying. You're He was looking for something. You say, "I'm looking for peace. I'm looking where's MY JOY, MY SALVATION. WHERE'S THE PEACE? WHERE'S THE FAITH? WHERE'S THE HAPPINESS I ONCE HAD? IT MIGHT BE LIKE ABRAHAM. IT MIGHT BE JUST ABOVE YOU. I WANT TO SAY TO YOU TONIGHT, YOU HAVE THE GRAND PRIVILEGE TO RISE UP HIGHER. GET UP INTO THAT SHIKINA GLORY. YOU'LL FIND YOUR JOY THERE. YOU'LL FIND YOUR PEACE THERE. YOU'LL FIND YOUR STRENGTH. YOU'LL FIND YOUR FAITH THERE. AND THEN YOU KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN? THEN GOD WILL START moving things around your life and bringing you out of that. You know what the beauty of that will be? is that you'll get victory and there won't be one thing yet that has changed. It'll be you that changed. Hallelujah. It It doesn't require one thing to change to go up higher into God. It'll be you that changes. And then when that happens, that's when God will come on the scene and start moving those things around that you were so worried about. Don't don't fear. That's the first thing the angel would say to [music] brother Brandham. So the first thing out of his mouth, fear not. Oh friends, get away from reasoning.
