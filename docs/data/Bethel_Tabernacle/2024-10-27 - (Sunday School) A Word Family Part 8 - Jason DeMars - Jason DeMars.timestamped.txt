[1:05] [Music]
[5:42] morning everyone let's
[5:47] stand going to continue on
[5:50] our subject to word family this is part
[5:53] eight go ahead and pull that PowerPoint
[5:55] up for me brother Mark and while he does
[5:57] that we'll pray Heavenly Father we just
[5:59] wna come to you Lord and we ask that
[6:01] your Holy Spirit would guide us and lead
[6:04] us Lord that it would be a a ministering
[6:07] of the word to the hearts of your people
[6:09] Lord that it would bring something that
[6:10] would be a help to them in their Walk
[6:13] with You Lord we just commit ourselves
[6:16] and our time in the word with you now
[6:18] Lord we ask that you'd be glorified in
[6:21] our midst in Jesus name
[6:24] amen all right so we'll start reading uh
[6:29] first Peter chapter
[6:35] 3 not sure if I'm connected I'm probably
[6:37] going to need you to help me out brother
[6:39] Mark I don't know if we're having a
[6:42] battery issue or what I am
[6:45] on 1 Peter 3:1 likewise ye wives be in
[6:50] subjection to your own husbands that if
[6:52] any obey not the word they also May
[6:55] without the word be won by the
[6:57] conversation of the wives
[7:01] next verse while they behold your chaste
[7:03] conversation coupled with fear whose
[7:06] adorning let it not be that outward
[7:08] adorning of plating the hair and wearing
[7:10] of gold or put of putting on of apparel
[7:12] but let it be the hidden man of the
[7:14] heart in that which is not corruptible
[7:16] even the ornament of a weak of a Meek
[7:19] not weak meek and quiet Spirit which is
[7:22] in the sight of God of great price for
[7:26] after this manner in the old time the
[7:29] holy women women also who trusted in God
[7:30] adorned themselves being in subjection
[7:33] unto their own husbands even as Sarah
[7:35] obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose
[7:38] daughters you are as long as you do well
[7:39] and are not afraid with any amazement
[7:42] likewise you husbands dwell with them
[7:44] according to knowledge giving honor unto
[7:45] the wife as unto the weaker vessel and
[7:48] as being heirs together of the grace of
[7:50] life that your prayers be not hindered
[7:52] may the Lord add the blessing to the
[7:54] reading of his word you can be
[7:57] seated all right now I have control good
[8:01] deal so you might you might be thinking
[8:04] why does he keep going on and on and
[8:07] preaching about A Woman's Place and I I
[8:12] have to say we understand and in our
[8:14] study we've realized that it was Men Who
[8:16] abdicated their position that allowed
[8:19] for feminism to grow uh unhindered amen
[8:23] it was weak men that that did that we we
[8:27] call them uh never
[8:31] mind sometimes you have to catch
[8:33] yourself it's brother brandham mocked
[8:36] people and so did Elijah but uh
[8:39] sometimes it's over the top so uh
[8:42] sissified men is how the prophet said it
[8:46] modern people would call them soy boys
[8:48] but we won't go
[8:52] there but it cissified men that refused
[8:56] to lead in the home in the church
[9:00] and in Civil Society amen and so if if
[9:04] we get the men in order eventually the
[9:06] women will come back into order but if
[9:09] we don't even understand what order is
[9:11] what's the order and how do we get back
[9:13] there and that's why we spend time
[9:15] speaking about the position and order
[9:18] that women have it used to
[9:21] be in the Reformation period anyone that
[9:25] was a Christian immediately understood
[9:27] they didn't have to preach on women
[9:28] shouldn't be preachers
[9:29] amen women shouldn't lead the
[9:31] family they they spoke about it they
[9:34] wrote about it but it wasn't something
[9:36] necessary to rebuke and preach again
[9:39] they didn't have to preach against
[9:41] modesty only a little bit amen they
[9:44] didn't have to preach wh why are why are
[9:47] people uh dressing this way and acting
[9:50] this way it wasn't necessary because
[9:52] everyone understood and knew in a
[9:54] Christian Society a woman should dress
[9:56] modestly she shouldn't wear makeup she
[9:57] shouldn't cut her hair she should put on
[9:59] pants men shouldn't go out with their
[10:02] women's underclothes on they should lead
[10:04] the lead in the home they should lead in
[10:06] the family and only in extraordinary
[10:08] circumstances would a woman ever be a
[10:11] leader in civil society and especially
[10:13] not if there was a vote cast to bring
[10:15] that of course in hereditary places
[10:18] where there was no one else to inherit
[10:20] de you you think of Deborah you think of
[10:22] the woman at the city that joab was
[10:23] about to attack God used them on a
[10:26] temporary basis but the norm was not w
[10:28] women
[10:29] in leadership positions in Civil Society
[10:34] the Civil Authority or the political
[10:35] Authority though it could happen in
[10:38] extraordinary circumstances that God
[10:40] could choose them to do that but again
[10:43] it wasn't the norm now we've come full
[10:46] circle and just to stand in the pulpit
[10:49] and say you know women shouldn't have
[10:51] the vote in a Christian country and
[10:54] women shouldn't run for civil office in
[10:57] a Christian St country and women
[11:00] shouldn't preach behind the pulpit in a
[11:02] Christian country and you are now marked
[11:05] as a
[11:05] radical well thank God I'm a radical I'm
[11:08] happy as a radical because I'm in good
[11:11] place with all the writers of the Bible
[11:14] and the prophets of old and the prophets
[11:17] of
[11:18] new amen and so as we look at this and
[11:21] we speak about women it's because we
[11:24] love women amen it's our duty to protect
[11:28] our sister isers we live in a world
[11:31] where women are unprotected because of
[11:34] feminism where women are put in a
[11:36] position in the place where they're out
[11:38] of their place instead of being
[11:41] protected by a father a grandfather a
[11:44] brother an
[11:45] uncle society as a whole they're put In
[11:49] Harm's Way in front of every man to
[11:52] dress any way that they choose to look
[11:55] any way they choose to and this is not
[11:58] God's purpose and program for the world
[12:01] and brother brandham speaks about it any
[12:03] country that will all would allow such a
[12:06] situation is a perverted country
[12:10] amen and so as we look at these things
[12:12] we look at First Peter we see God's
[12:15] purpose brother brandham says women oh
[12:18] let me pull up the PowerPoint again
[12:21] women ought to look to Jesus Christ you
[12:23] ought to look to Sarah and them of the
[12:25] Old Testament now they got so that I was
[12:28] preaching the other night someone about
[12:29] women to obey their husband obey yeah
[12:32] that went out of the marriage ritual a
[12:34] long time ago but they ain't going to do
[12:36] that no sir they live in America and
[12:38] they let you know so they're not going
[12:40] to obey but as long as you don't do it
[12:42] don't never try to call yourself a
[12:44] Christian CU you're not I don't care how
[12:46] much you dance and speak with tongues if
[12:48] you don't obey your husband you're out
[12:50] of the will of God am amen this is
[12:53] exactly the scripture just as we read
[12:56] Sarah obeyed Abraham
[12:59] calling him Lord who daughter whose
[13:02] daughters you are as long as you do well
[13:04] and are not afraid with any amazement
[13:08] this is the purpose and place of our
[13:12] dear sisters is under Authority amen the
[13:15] the you you look through scripture and
[13:18] we read it before and I'm just going to
[13:19] refer to it briefly read numbers 30 some
[13:23] people look and say well the Old
[13:24] Testament law has nothing to do with us
[13:27] as Christians well the ceremonial law
[13:31] that's true the ceremonial law we
[13:33] understand is a type of Christ and the
[13:37] bride right but in the laws we can look
[13:41] and see places that God put something
[13:44] there that gives us a principle and the
[13:48] truth is every nation should base their
[13:50] laws upon the word of God and upon the
[13:53] principles of the word of God so we look
[13:55] back to numbers 30 and it shows us what
[13:58] actual headship in a home means it means
[14:00] that the father or the husband is the
[14:04] deciding factor in the family if his
[14:07] wife or daughter makes a decision he can
[14:09] invalidate them even to the point where
[14:11] if they make a vow to God he can say no
[14:15] amen and God himself will honor that
[14:18] authority of the husband now again the
[14:23] immediate thing that happens is that uh
[14:26] modern women feminist women go directly
[14:29] to well if it's that way every woman
[14:32] will be abused was every woman abused in
[14:35] all of history no Would a Christian man
[14:39] abuse his wife not a real Christian man
[14:43] amen a a sissified man that doesn't
[14:46] understand what manhood is manhood in
[14:49] itself means work and guarding so a
[14:53] protector someone that controls someone
[14:55] that manipulates someone that uh beats
[14:59] his wife is a twisted person is a
[15:02] twisted man he is not a man he's weak
[15:07] amen and in order to establish his
[15:10] strength he has to use perverted means
[15:12] the Bible says the wrath of man works
[15:15] not the righteousness of God so the
[15:17] anger of man does not accomplish God's
[15:20] righteousness so an angry man an angry
[15:23] husband that uses anger to control his
[15:26] family is a perverted man
[15:29] yes
[15:30] amen as the young people say he's a
[15:34] beta he's not a real man he's we he he
[15:38] is
[15:39] absolutely Ethan's saying something
[15:42] different maybe he's a sigma I don't
[15:43] know but
[15:45] um the fact is he's weak he's not he's
[15:49] not a real man a real man understands
[15:52] that it it is his duty to protect it is
[15:57] his duty to provide and take care of
[16:01] those around him and those that are
[16:04] weaker even to his own hurt even to his
[16:07] own uh pain he must be that type of
[16:12] man all
[16:14] right continuing on 1 Thessalonians 2 7
[16:19] and 8 I want you to see the scripture
[16:23] speaks of the attributes and
[16:26] nature of a woman and Paul even speaking
[16:29] of himself that he as an
[16:32] apostle manifested to his children both
[16:35] the nature of of the love and nurture
[16:38] that a woman brings and the the
[16:41] correction and d and and wisdom that a
[16:44] father
[16:45] brings but the point being is looking at
[16:48] as these are attributes that a woman
[16:50] should have in her life and in her
[16:54] family so 1 Thessalonians 2:7 and8 but
[16:56] we were gentle among you even as a nurse
[16:59] cherishes her children so a woman isn't
[17:03] to be a brute a woman isn't to be hard
[17:07] hard and have a hard Edge and have a
[17:10] harshness to her as we read before it's
[17:13] a it's a a Meek and a quiet Spirit what
[17:16] is meekness meekness is not weakness
[17:18] meekness is being able to be led Moses
[17:22] was the meekest man on the earth what
[17:24] did it mean that he was weak absolutely
[17:26] was not weak what was he what was it he
[17:29] was actually uh easily led by God Amen
[17:34] he was the one that knew he was under
[17:36] the authority of God and knew that he
[17:38] needed to stay under that Authority and
[17:41] a Meek woman knows that she needs to be
[17:43] under headship and to follow
[17:47] headship so there's a gentle spirit that
[17:50] is upon a woman a mother that should be
[17:53] upon her harsh
[17:56] Brash uh aggressive that's not the
[17:59] nature that God wants a woman to have
[18:02] amen so being affectionately desirous of
[18:05] you we were willing to have imparted
[18:07] unto you not the gospel of God only but
[18:10] also our own Souls because you were dear
[18:13] unto us getting ahead of myself a little
[18:16] bit I just want to make the point that
[18:18] one of the names that Adam gave to his
[18:21] wife was Eve it means Hava it means
[18:24] lifegiver so if you're looking at the
[18:26] scripture a woman is designed to impart
[18:29] life unto her children this is this is
[18:33] her nature this is a her desire so we
[18:36] see how perverted our society has become
[18:39] that the number one issue in voting for
[18:41] women is that they can kill their unborn
[18:43] children amen abortion is a great
[18:46] perversion of Womanhood real Womanhood
[18:49] says I'll rather give my life and let
[18:52] the baby live then kill this baby so
[18:55] that I can just live however I want to
[18:57] without any
[18:59] uh any ramifications for my
[19:01] actions but that's the perversion of
[19:03] birth control and that's the perversion
[19:06] of abortion they don't want consequences
[19:09] for what they've
[19:10] done amen and they and and the Viewpoint
[19:14] of our age as children are an
[19:15] inconvenience to our own life this is a
[19:18] perversion and even this idea sometimes
[19:21] Creeps in to the church yeah but God's
[19:24] idea is quite different so a a real
[19:27] mother a real woman is ready to give her
[19:30] own life for her children in fact she
[19:32] does from her body after she has
[19:35] children it changes it's not the same
[19:37] body anymore she gives that up gladly
[19:41] joyfully it's not easy no one said it's
[19:45] easy but she joyfully does it because
[19:47] she Lo because of the love and the the
[19:51] the the nurturing Gentle Spirit that she
[19:54] has from God Amen not only that then
[19:58] after the baby's born she dedicates her
[20:01] whole time and effort to taking care of
[20:05] and feeding that baby from her own
[20:07] body and so this this is the real Beauty
[20:11] And Glory of
[20:17] motherhood brother brandham says in the
[20:22] sermon flashing red light of the sign of
[20:25] his coming again brother brandham is not
[20:28] afraid to call out the sins of the age
[20:32] and the sins of the
[20:34] hour he says what happens out of
[20:38] marriage here's another place in the
[20:39] Bible out of marriage Goes The Vow obey
[20:41] huh obey huh a keeper at home chased of
[20:46] Good Works she laughs in your face and
[20:48] goes to the powder plant somebody's
[20:50] office my husband yeah oh I doubt that
[20:52] if she forces today these forces today
[20:55] such a disgrace put women on the police
[20:57] force if that is and a mark of
[20:59] debauchery among any city as many men is
[21:02] out of work and they have to put them
[21:04] women out there when the Bible said she
[21:06] is to
[21:07] stay uh she's to stay home and be a
[21:11] chased Keeper at at home but she keeps
[21:13] all the boss's books and yours too
[21:16] that's right I ain't talking about good
[21:18] women now I'm not throwing this to you
[21:20] women that's really Godly women God
[21:22] Bless you that's on tape or what
[21:24] wherever more but I'm talking about
[21:26] where you find one like that you find
[21:27] 1,500 the other way they won't listen to
[21:30] a word keep your Bible preach it to
[21:32] yourself we don't want to hear it
[21:34] obey oh she might say this tell you tell
[21:38] your bible stories to somebody else keep
[21:40] your God to somebody else and leave me
[21:41] alone what are you hollering at me about
[21:44] I never did ask you to say these things
[21:45] I know but God did see so that's all so
[21:49] they still corrupt the way just as they
[21:51] did in the days of the Lord just as they
[21:53] did in that day so do they today just
[21:55] the same it hasn't changed it doesn't
[21:57] change it won't change
[21:59] juvenile delinquency finally gets her
[22:01] children the jail gets part of the women
[22:04] and the men and Hell takes the whole
[22:06] thing up that's exactly right fin
[22:08] finally swallows them all up and the
[22:10] preaching seems to go over the top of
[22:12] their backs they never listen to it
[22:14] they're going to have their own you
[22:15] could tell them what the Bible says
[22:17] Bible says this they say keep your Bible
[22:20] we're going to have our fun I can hear
[22:22] some of you sister saying now maybe not
[22:24] right present but hear you saying who me
[22:26] obey my husband huh I make him him obey
[22:29] me but there is where you're wrong stay
[22:31] at home chased I don't care what the
[22:33] Bible says about it you leave me alone
[22:35] listen sister that wasn't it back in the
[22:37] dark a that that wasn't in back in the
[22:39] Dark Ages that's the voice of today that
[22:42] never happened so much back in the anti
[22:44] deluvian it happens today too that's the
[22:47] same thing again they say I'm a modern
[22:49] woman I live in America well that's no
[22:51] more than you live in a a Hog Pen it
[22:54] wouldn't make a bit of difference to God
[22:55] where you lived you are what you are in
[22:57] your heart that's right and don't think
[22:59] sister that you're so modern that you're
[23:01] one of these modern women as you want to
[23:03] say today you're you're from a way back
[23:06] according to this Bible in Dark Ages in
[23:08] the ant deluvian time in the time of
[23:10] Noah that's when they did the same thing
[23:12] so you're not so very modern after all
[23:14] are you see that's the way they acted in
[23:17] the anti- deluvian world see and that's
[23:18] the way they're acting today so it must
[23:21] be a Dark Age Again back in the Great
[23:24] Dark Beyond and you man that will let
[23:26] your wife do it you're no longer sons of
[23:29] God no you kind of fell into Sodom
[23:31] that's right let the woman boss you
[23:34] around my goodness what a rebuke
[23:39] yeah seems to be even more fitting for
[23:43] the day that we're living in than it was
[23:45] even for the time of of brother brandham
[23:48] right uh in in his day at least there
[23:51] was a
[23:52] Remnant now it's seems to be all
[23:54] pervasive although I will say this that
[23:58] that this uh biblical understanding is
[24:01] starting to uh take effect it's starting
[24:04] to to make a make some a slight change
[24:08] amongst Christians that believe the
[24:09] Bible that they've discovered that this
[24:12] world is evil and we should not we
[24:14] should not be a little bit like the
[24:16] world and a little bit like the Bible
[24:18] but they say forget all that let's go
[24:20] back to the Old Paths and the old ways
[24:23] and I believe that's the right way and
[24:25] the right approach
[24:33] and again I'm I'm not reading this
[24:35] because I want to beat a dead horse I'm
[24:37] reading this because I want you to see
[24:39] what the prophet said it's easy to go
[24:41] along and listen to sermons and and and
[24:44] just gloss over it and not see where
[24:45] it's connected to the scriptures but
[24:48] it's important that we really see his
[24:50] attitude and his approach to these
[24:52] things and even how he he dealt with
[24:55] them in his preaching
[24:59] and you men that's smoking cigarettes
[25:01] that's Unbecoming and you men that's
[25:04] letting your wife do that and then you
[25:06] say you're sons of God a
[25:08] man the great the great vow that's took
[25:11] at the marriage ceremony love honor and
[25:14] obbey is gone in America the woman has
[25:17] the right of way well everywhere she has
[25:19] got the right of way the Bible said she
[25:23] would have it that
[25:25] way now don't shoot me this is just
[25:29] saying what the prophet said they say
[25:31] that the women is the most careful
[25:33] drivers that we got in the land that's
[25:35] wrong my son and I crossing the nation
[25:38] back and forth keep a book and every
[25:39] time there is what we call a boo boo
[25:41] pulled on the road if it's the man we
[25:43] put it under man and woman under woman
[25:45] and under
[25:46] three 100 boo boos Across the Nation
[25:48] there was 281 of them women how did they
[25:52] base this because of the reports that's
[25:54] turned in certainly them cops ain't
[25:55] going to arrest them Nic looking women
[25:57] if they got a telephone number they
[25:59] won't turn them in they let them go and
[26:01] that's the reason you see it's become a
[26:03] woman's world the Bible said it would be
[26:05] that way exactly so listen what he says
[26:08] next so the preacher in the Pulpit is
[26:11] just about the same thing he's afraid to
[26:14] say anything against it that's that is
[26:18] what we're living under that's what we
[26:20] see mega churches filled with people and
[26:24] the majority of them is women in these
[26:27] mega churches why because the preacher
[26:29] stands up and he rebukes the men and
[26:32] what about the women not a word they're
[26:34] the best members they're the ones that
[26:36] we love they're the ones that are women
[26:38] are more spiritual than men that might
[26:40] be true but they also need a rebuke just
[26:43] as much as the men do yeah and and
[26:47] especially in the hour that we're living
[26:48] in where feminism has creeped in and
[26:51] taken over the minds of people things
[26:53] need to be set in order and it takes
[26:56] courage and you must stand here here and
[26:59] preach the word of God Amen and I'm I
[27:01] thank God for sisters that have put up
[27:03] with me I think you still like me for
[27:05] eight eight eight series of uh uh Sunday
[27:10] school and who knows how many more it
[27:12] will be but our desire is to be right
[27:14] with
[27:15] God not to give you smooth words that
[27:19] everybody would say oh I just love Jason
[27:22] you might be coming to Sunday school
[27:24] flinching but if you if you leave a
[27:27] better woman a better man I think you
[27:30] should just thank
[27:34] God and again my point wasn't to talk
[27:37] about women being worst drivers as you
[27:39] see my point was not that my point was
[27:42] to point out authority figures are
[27:45] fearing of women right are husbands
[27:49] fearing of women I think so are
[27:52] preachers afraid of women I think so is
[27:56] the government even afraid of women to
[27:59] some extent absolutely amen so we live
[28:02] in a society that's afraid to hold women
[28:05] accountable well God isn't afraid of it
[28:08] so neither should his preachers be
[28:09] neither should the husbands be
[28:12] amen
[28:16] amen in questions and answers brother
[28:18] brandham is gets this question brother
[28:20] brandham the Bible tells us a wife
[28:22] should obey her husband I a Christian
[28:24] and my husband is a sinner he persecutes
[28:26] me in every way that he can and for me
[28:28] not to go to church and read my Bible
[28:30] and denies the word what should I do
[28:32] what should you do now listen you're
[28:34] supposed to obey your husband that's the
[28:35] word now if he tells you and refuses you
[28:38] to read the Bible go to church or
[28:39] something like that you don't have to
[28:41] obey that because he that will not
[28:43] forsake his father mother husband wife
[28:44] or whatever it is and follow me is not
[28:46] worthy of me is that right now don't the
[28:49] men are supposed you're not a man's not
[28:51] supposed to use that authority over a
[28:53] woman just because he's her ruler God is
[28:56] her ruler above you brother in other
[28:58] words Amen in other words it should be
[29:01] the leadership of Christ flowing through
[29:04] the husband to his wife and the rest of
[29:06] the family it's not just we use it use
[29:09] the authority over our wife just because
[29:11] we want to get our own way that's
[29:12] selfishness amen we use that Authority
[29:16] in order to bless in order to build in
[29:18] order to strengthen in order to rebuke
[29:20] correct
[29:22] Etc God her is her ruler above you
[29:24] brother see and if your wife is doing
[29:26] something wrong then don't then you got
[29:28] a right to tell her and she's supposed
[29:29] to listen to you but you haven't got no
[29:32] right to to beat her or drag her around
[29:34] or do those things no God Made Men a
[29:38] helpmate not a dormant remember she was
[29:40] your sweetheart she should always be
[29:44] that amen notice incredibly balanced
[29:49] beautiful answer the prophet gives well
[29:51] you're supposed to obey your husband he
[29:53] doesn't minimize that he doesn't say
[29:55] well sister you see he says yep that's
[29:58] the word obey your husband but if he
[30:00] tells you to disobey the word don't do
[30:02] that because you have to be willing to
[30:04] forsake all to follow
[30:06] Christ and men don't don't use your
[30:10] authority to control your wife God is
[30:13] her ruler above you in other words that
[30:15] you you're using your position of
[30:18] authority to speak what God speaks to
[30:21] you for your
[30:23] family and he says don't beat her or
[30:26] abuse her amen
[30:28] but in but instead you also need to be
[30:31] able to correct her if she's wrong sit
[30:34] down about it and another quote he says
[30:36] sit down look at the Bible together and
[30:39] pray over it amen that that's way he's
[30:42] saying to take the leadership and
[30:44] authority over your wife and as a wife
[30:46] you should obey a husband that's
[30:48] pointing you to the
[30:54] word Proverbs 11
[31:00] 29 he that troubleth his own house shall
[31:03] inherit the wind and the fool shall be
[31:06] servant to the
[31:09] wise so I want to read what John Gil
[31:13] says about this verse because I I think
[31:15] it's very important to understand as men
[31:18] a man can either bless his house with
[31:21] his leadership or he can trouble his
[31:23] house with his
[31:24] leadership regardless of the the
[31:27] situation of your country you might live
[31:30] in a Middle Eastern country where
[31:31] patriarchy is the norm you might live in
[31:34] America where feminism is the norm
[31:37] whether you're in in one country or the
[31:40] other you can be one of two kinds of
[31:42] husbands because there's patriarchy is
[31:45] inevitable because men are stronger than
[31:47] women men are in a in a better position
[31:51] to lead so what is the difference a man
[31:54] that
[31:55] abdicates his position of leadership
[31:58] leaves it to the woman is a is a
[32:00] feminist Le home a matriarchal home
[32:05] right that but he's still he's still The
[32:07] Leader by abdicating his authority so
[32:10] that means he's a bad leader and there's
[32:13] another kind who's a patriarch who
[32:15] abuses his authority that's wrong that's
[32:19] un that's just as unscriptural all right
[32:22] but then there is a godly man that
[32:24] understands that the authority of Christ
[32:26] flows through him to his own family on
[32:29] either ends of these places you have
[32:31] someone that is troubling his own house
[32:34] amen he's he's bringing he's not doing
[32:37] what he's supposed to do he's not
[32:39] bringing strength he's not bringing
[32:43] wisdom he's not bringing an uh the right
[32:47] kind of attitude because ultimately the
[32:50] husband is who creates the atmosphere
[32:52] for the home amen and and in in all
[32:55] pervasive not just spiritually speaking
[32:58] but but Naturally Speaking as well and
[33:01] so uh the purpose of a man is he should
[33:04] he should look and see that he is the
[33:07] benefactor of his whole family I am the
[33:10] provider and I'm the one that's to bring
[33:12] B every benefit to supply every need of
[33:17] my family now we understand we can't
[33:19] meet their spiritual need on their soul
[33:21] level but we can do the things that are
[33:24] necessary to keep them in the atmosphere
[33:26] where God can bring bring forth the
[33:28] blessing on the level of the Soul see
[33:32] bring them to church be a consistent
[33:33] person go to when there's church on
[33:35] Wednesday don't make an excuse that
[33:37] somebody's tired we're all tired the
[33:39] preacher himself is probably more tired
[33:41] than anybody so come get to church every
[33:44] single time don't make an excuse don't
[33:46] let your wife make an excuse don't let
[33:48] your kids make an excuse be there every
[33:50] time same on Sunday get to Sunday school
[33:53] on time every time 15 minutes early
[33:58] you're asking for the moon I'll I'll ask
[34:01] for the sun
[34:03] next amen amen get to church on time
[34:06] show that it is a priority in your life
[34:10] your children will never leave that path
[34:13] get them to the youth youth camp get
[34:15] them to the the the youth meetings make
[34:19] these things a priority pray in your
[34:21] home pray together when there's a big
[34:23] issue pray together over meals eat meals
[34:26] together what a revelation
[34:28] am and pray over your meals
[34:31] together sit down and enjoy one
[34:34] another's company as a man you set the
[34:36] atmosphere that that's what you
[34:39] want and lead by example so don't
[34:42] trouble your own house there John
[34:46] Gil I got one less than one minute left
[34:49] John Gil says this he that troubleth his
[34:51] own house this from his
[34:52] commentary his family his wife and
[34:55] children and servants by being bitter to
[34:56] the one and by Prov Ving the others to
[34:58] wrath and continually giving out
[34:59] menacing words to the rest or through
[35:01] idleness not providing for his family or
[35:04] through an Overworld Spirit pushing on
[35:07] business and hurrying it on beyond
[35:08] measure or through a Covetous and greedy
[35:10] temper withholding meat and drink and
[35:12] clothes convenient for them my goodness
[35:16] we're we're not to be that kind of man
[35:19] that brings trouble to our own house
[35:21] were to be the kind of man that the
[35:23] whole family would look at say is my
[35:26] father always yeah provided for me not
[35:29] just meat not just food but spiritual
[35:33] meat and emotional meat and mental meat
[35:36] to help me grow and become the person
[35:39] that God wants to be me to be let's
[35:44] stand Heavenly Father we thank you so
[35:46] much for your word we thank you so much
[35:48] Lord for the reality and Light of Christ
[35:51] in this hour Lord I'm so thankful to see
[35:54] young people sitting and listening at
[35:56] the word and not in the
