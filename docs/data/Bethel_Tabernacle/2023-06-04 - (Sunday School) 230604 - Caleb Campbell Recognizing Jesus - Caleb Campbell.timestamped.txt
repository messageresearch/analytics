[5:37] amen Saints good to be in the house of
[5:39] the Lord this morning we just want to
[5:40] stand stand to our feet we're just going
[5:42] to open in some scripture and a word of
[5:45] Prayer
[5:46] we're going to take a little title this
[5:48] morning on recognizing Jesus
[5:51] can actually turn into our Bibles to
[5:54] three portions of scripture so we have
[5:56] Philippians
[5:57] chapter 1 and verse 6 is going to be the
[6:00] first one
[6:02] thankful to be in the house of the Lord
[6:04] this morning amen
[6:07] being confident of this very thing that
[6:10] he which hath begun a good work in you
[6:12] will perform it until the day of Jesus
[6:15] Christ
[6:17] we're going to do two more scripture
[6:18] readings here to Second Timothy 4 8.
[6:23] second Timothy 4 8 henceforth there is
[6:25] laid up for me a crown of righteousness
[6:27] which the Lord the righteous judge shall
[6:30] give me at that day and not to me only
[6:33] but unto all them also that love his
[6:38] appearing amen
[6:40] and then Luke 24 13 we're going to read
[6:43] just a few scriptures there Luke 24 13
[6:46] says and now behold
[6:48] two of them
[6:49] went that same day to a village called
[6:52] Emmaus
[6:53] which was from Jerusalem about three
[6:56] score four Longs and they talked
[6:58] together all of these things which had
[7:00] happened
[7:03] and it came to pass that while they come
[7:05] commune together and reasoned Jesus
[7:08] himself Drew near and went with them
[7:11] but their eyes were Holden that they
[7:13] should not know him
[7:15] and in the international version it says
[7:17] that that they did not recognize him so
[7:21] let's just come before the Lord
[7:23] dear precious Heavenly Father Lord we're
[7:25] so grateful and so thankful Lord for the
[7:27] opportunity to come into the house of
[7:29] the Lord this morning Father Lord we're
[7:32] just praying that you would be the one
[7:34] in preeminence today Father we just lift
[7:37] up the name of Jesus we pray that Lord
[7:40] we can take the pressures of life we can
[7:42] take all the the thoughts and all the
[7:44] things Lord God that we have and just
[7:46] lay them aside Lord let your word father
[7:48] just Lord cleanse us this morning Lord
[7:51] let us just get a fresh refilling of
[7:53] your spirit father Lord we love you now
[7:56] we pray for the minister I pray that you
[7:57] would anoint him now Lord God help each
[7:59] one of us to just pull on that word even
[8:02] now in this Sunday school Lord I pray
[8:03] that you just help each one of us to
[8:05] just glean something from you Lord God
[8:07] we love you now we ask all these things
[8:09] in the mighty precious name of the Lord
[8:11] Jesus Christ amen you can take your
[8:14] seats
[8:15] so in the next part of that scripture in
[8:18] verse 17 and he said unto them what
[8:20] manner of communications are these that
[8:23] ye have with one another as ye walked in
[8:25] our sad so Jesus is just imagine putting
[8:27] yourself in these in this in this in
[8:30] these shoes you know the two men talking
[8:32] about the Lord thinking about the Lord
[8:34] thinking upon these things of the Lord
[8:35] and Jesus himself comes before them and
[8:39] says why are you sad what's going on and
[8:41] one of them says whose name was cleopas
[8:43] answered said unto them art thou a
[8:45] stranger in Jerusalem and hast thou not
[8:48] known the things which are come to pass
[8:49] and there in these days any testifying
[8:52] about the Lord to the Lord and he said
[8:53] unto them what things and they said unto
[8:55] him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which
[8:58] was a prophet Mighty indeed and word
[9:00] before God and all the people and how
[9:03] the chief priests and our rulers
[9:04] delivered him to be condemned to death
[9:06] and had crucified him but we trusted
[9:09] that it had been he which should have
[9:12] redeemed Israel
[9:13] and besides this today is the third day
[9:17] since these things were done yea and the
[9:19] certain woman
[9:27] and the certain woman also of our
[9:28] company made us astonished which were
[9:30] early at the Sepulcher and when they
[9:32] found not his body they came saying that
[9:34] they had also seen a vision of angels
[9:36] which said that he was alive and certain
[9:38] of them which were with us went to the
[9:41] sepuler and found it even so as the
[9:43] woman had said but him they saw not then
[9:46] he said to them o fools and slow of
[9:48] heart to believe that all the prophets
[9:50] have spoken
[9:52] ought not Christ to have suffered these
[9:53] things and entered into his glory
[9:56] and beginning at Moses and all the
[9:58] prophets he expounded unto them all the
[10:00] scriptures the things concerning himself
[10:02] and they drew an eye onto the village
[10:04] whether they went and he made as though
[10:06] he would have gone further so he was
[10:07] going to just keep going but they
[10:09] constrained him and said abide with us
[10:11] for it is towards evening and the day is
[10:14] far spent and he went into tarry with
[10:16] them and it came to pass as he sat meat
[10:18] with him he took bread and blessed it
[10:20] and break it and gave to them and their
[10:22] eyes were open for they knew him and he
[10:25] vanished out of their sight brother
[10:26] Branham picks this up here in looking
[10:28] unto Jesus and he says oh we notice the
[10:32] disciples uh paragraph 44 we noticed the
[10:34] disciples one time after it was Easter
[10:36] morning what a morning Jesus up from the
[10:38] dead walking among the followers
[10:42] and two friends cleopas and one of his
[10:44] friends was on the road to Emmaus and
[10:46] they were talking along grieved in their
[10:48] heart and a man stepped out of the Bush
[10:50] and walked with him the rest of the day
[10:52] talking to them about Christ and that
[10:54] evening they asked him and he was like
[10:56] he was going to pass them by but they
[10:58] asked him to come in and he did so
[11:01] Saints how many times in our hearts have
[11:03] we been longing to see Jesus and he what
[11:06] we have to invite him into our hearts
[11:08] and we have to invite him into ourselves
[11:10] he's not gonna he's not gonna put a
[11:12] thumb on us and and force us to do
[11:14] anything he's a gentleman so he wants us
[11:16] to open up our hearts to receive him
[11:19] amen and when you're looking for Jesus
[11:22] brother random takes this and when
[11:24] you're looking for Jesus you're gonna
[11:26] find him
[11:27] amen and uh when cleopas and his friends
[11:31] were on this road they were grieved
[11:34] and they did something
[11:36] but he did something there so they had
[11:39] actually seen Jesus and they'd seen the
[11:41] the things that he had been they'd seen
[11:43] his his uh you know he was a he was a
[11:45] man you know he was God but he was a man
[11:48] and so they saw the things that he did
[11:50] and they saw the ways that he walked and
[11:53] they saw the ways that he talked and so
[11:55] they recognized there was something
[11:56] about him that day that they had
[11:59] recognized that this is Jesus this is
[12:03] the same man this is the same person
[12:05] I've seen this happen and only one
[12:07] person that I've seen it happen before
[12:09] and then it was at that time that they
[12:12] recognized that Jesus was literally
[12:14] walking with them all that day
[12:16] can you just imagine that searching the
[12:19] scriptures brother Branham says and the
[12:21] Pharisees had a word drawed out just
[12:23] exactly the way that Messiah was coming
[12:25] so brother random comes and picks this
[12:26] up and says you know imagine then on the
[12:28] other coin of things when you know they
[12:30] had the scriptures as Pharisees they
[12:32] they had Moses's law they had all these
[12:34] things that they held on to and they
[12:36] were looking for a messiah to come they
[12:39] were looking for that they were all
[12:40] looking for the same thing but when they
[12:43] were when he was standing when when God
[12:45] in flesh was standing right before them
[12:46] he they could not recognize him so when
[12:50] you when it comes time to recognize
[12:51] Jesus you sometimes you're looking at
[12:54] the simple things of life God always
[12:56] reveals himself in Simplicity we have to
[12:59] remember that God always reveals himself
[13:01] in Simplicity amen
[13:03] and he said in um and looking unto Jesus
[13:05] he said Moses said the Lord your God
[13:07] shall raise up a prophet like unto me a
[13:10] lawgiver and so forth a prophet and him
[13:13] the people shall hear and if they had
[13:14] known Moses's writing they would have
[13:16] known him they thought they knowed
[13:17] Moses's writing but you see they didn't
[13:19] know it they were blinded to the very
[13:22] facts so just a few words from him what
[13:24] did they do they sprang up and said this
[13:25] man's got a devil devil come to teach us
[13:27] what school did he come from we have no
[13:29] record of him wonder whose Fellowship
[13:31] card he is packing or something on that
[13:33] order or that question but they failed
[13:35] to look and to see the very God that had
[13:38] promised the word was vindicating it
[13:40] right there
[13:41] through that person of Jesus Christ
[13:43] God's
[13:45] God's word produces the sunshine God
[13:48] produces the Earth God's word produces
[13:50] the air everything is the word of God
[13:53] made manifest everything that's got a
[13:56] reality to it some looked and saw and
[13:59] brother Matt brought this up in a in a
[14:01] sermon Brother Brad brought it up too
[14:03] when when different times in the
[14:05] scripture when different prophets and
[14:07] different men of God saw God and how
[14:09] they what did they see you know Isaiah
[14:12] Isaiah brother Brandon picked it up and
[14:14] and
[14:15] um Isaiah was said I see counselor
[14:18] Prince of Peace Mighty God Daniel saw
[14:21] him and I saw a stone hewed out of a
[14:23] mountain and brother brother Matt
[14:24] dramatized that so well that day and I I
[14:27] uh
[14:28] I think it was Ezekiel the wheel in the
[14:31] middle of the wheel and just seeing God
[14:33] and seeing seeing him in his different
[14:36] ways and and and recognizing who he was
[14:39] and then brother random comes and looks
[14:40] at the other coin looks at the other
[14:42] side of the coin and Nebuchadnezzar says
[14:44] one day had done an evil thing he threw
[14:47] three believing children into a fiery
[14:49] furnace and when he opened the door to
[14:51] see how they were getting along in there
[14:52] he saw the fourth man on the inside of
[14:54] the firmness and what did you see when
[14:57] you looked Nebuchadnezzar he said he
[14:59] looked like the Son of God that's what
[15:01] he saw when he looked into a crime that
[15:03] he had done that there was one that
[15:05] looked like the Son of God so what what
[15:08] side of the coin are we going to be on
[15:09] are we going to be on the side where
[15:11] we're looking for Jesus and we see the
[15:13] Prince of Peace we see the the Mighty
[15:16] the Mighty God in our lives through this
[15:18] message of the hour are we looking to
[15:20] Jesus and are we recognizing him or are
[15:22] we are we the nebuchadnezzars who were
[15:25] we we see him from afar off but it's not
[15:27] he's not with us he's not we're he's not
[15:30] recognized in our life
[15:33] John the greatest of all the prophets he
[15:35] was the one in the introduced Jesus
[15:37] Jesus said he was greater than any man
[15:39] that had ever been born
[15:41] you know and I was thinking the other
[15:42] day about the two Johns in the Bible
[15:44] John the Baptist and and John the
[15:46] disciple and you know likened unto uh
[15:49] you know the scripture talks so so
[15:52] greatly about John the Baptist one of
[15:54] the greatest men That Ever Walked the
[15:55] face of the Earth and God comes in flesh
[15:58] form and asks John the Baptist to
[16:00] baptize him because scripture had to be
[16:03] fulfilled that way John the disciple you
[16:06] know a man who laid in the bosom of
[16:08] Jesus me and me and my wife were just
[16:10] reading the scripture last night and
[16:12] several times when you read the book of
[16:14] John John refers to himself as the one
[16:16] whom Jesus loved amen and you see that
[16:19] and you you then you see how at at the
[16:23] culmination of his ministry Jesus's
[16:25] Ministry he comes and he sees John and
[16:29] he humbles himself and he washes his
[16:32] feet
[16:33] the god of the world in Simplicity
[16:36] washing John's feet can you imagine the
[16:39] position you can you imagine how little
[16:40] they felt God himself is literally
[16:43] washing my feet imagine imagine how
[16:46] little you would feel but that's what it
[16:49] takes to see God you recognize the
[16:51] littleness of yourself and the
[16:53] littleness of of what you are but then
[16:56] you see that even though I'm so little
[16:58] and even though I'm so nothing God still
[17:00] wants to have a relationship with me he
[17:02] still wants to wash my feet he still
[17:05] wants to to commune with me and then he
[17:07] gives me eyes to see and gives me eyes
[17:10] to recognize him through his ministry
[17:12] through the message of the hour amen
[17:15] it's such a beautiful thing
[17:17] and
[17:19] um
[17:19] you know
[17:21] we have I'm going to go through some
[17:22] quotes here so just this is just a
[17:24] little bit of a last minute uh a last
[17:26] minute study here so forgive me I didn't
[17:28] have any time to put anything up but
[17:30] we're going to go through some
[17:31] scriptures and some quotes here and if
[17:34] you any anybody wants those I can send
[17:36] them over but um the one John 24 or John
[17:41] chapter 21 4-7 but when the morning was
[17:44] come now Jesus stood on the shore and
[17:45] the disciples knew not that it was Jesus
[17:47] so this is another instance where where
[17:49] they hadn't recognized him yet and then
[17:52] Jesus saith unto him children have ye
[17:54] any meat and they answered and said no
[17:56] so he said unto them cast the net on the
[17:58] right side of the ship and ye shall find
[18:00] they cat so they cast therefore and now
[18:02] they were not able to draw it for the
[18:04] multitude of fish therefore that
[18:06] disciple whom Jesus loved imagine the
[18:09] disciple whom Jesus loved John saith
[18:11] unto Peter it is the Lord now when Simon
[18:13] Peter heard that it was the Lord he gird
[18:15] his Fisher's coat upon him for he was
[18:17] naked and he did cast himself into the
[18:21] sea
[18:22] and I I just was thinking back on on
[18:25] um a study I did not long ago on Peter
[18:29] at this time and this was the first time
[18:31] that Peter had actually seen Jesus after
[18:35] he had been resurrected after he had
[18:37] denied him three times and so can you
[18:40] imagine how Peter wanted to get to Jesus
[18:43] I said oh lord for you know I I I'm I'm
[18:45] can you imagine being like that we've
[18:47] all been in that state we've all been
[18:49] you know we've all fallen short of the
[18:51] glory of God and then to for God to to
[18:55] reach out his net and say listen there's
[18:57] there's I know you you messed up but
[19:00] just come come back unto me and and
[19:02] that's what that whole entire experience
[19:04] in that next couple of verses was about
[19:06] when you know God said to Peter you know
[19:08] uh do you love me Peter yes God you know
[19:13] that I loved you it's such a such a
[19:15] beautiful thing and then at Matthew 17
[19:17] 1-5 says and after six days taketh Peter
[19:21] James and John and his brother and
[19:23] bringeth him into a high mountain so
[19:25] this was when the mount Transfiguration
[19:27] and he was transfigured before him and
[19:29] his face did shine as the sun and his
[19:31] Remnant was white as the light and
[19:33] behold there appeared unto him Moses and
[19:35] Elias walking with him then answered
[19:37] Peter and said unto him Jesus Lord it is
[19:39] good for us to be here if thou Wilt let
[19:41] us make three Tabernacles one for three
[19:43] one for Moses and one for Elias while he
[19:46] yet spake Behold a bright Cloud
[19:47] overshadowed them and behold a voice out
[19:50] of the cloud which said this is my
[19:52] beloved Son and whom I am well pleased
[19:55] hear ye him
[19:57] and
[19:59] um
[20:01] I
[20:02] can't remember this
[20:05] scripture here but kind of talking about
[20:08] this morning I brother Matt had asked me
[20:10] to to do this Sunday school and the Lord
[20:12] had brought this out of my heart just
[20:13] this morning just listening to the
[20:16] prophet on in the car talking about
[20:18] getting into the land of adoption
[20:20] brother the scripture says according he
[20:24] hath chosen Us in him before the
[20:25] foundation of the world that we should
[20:26] be holy Without Blame before him in love
[20:29] having predestinated predestinated us
[20:31] under the adoption of children by Jesus
[20:34] Christ to himself according to the Good
[20:36] Will of his pleasure so in this the
[20:40] message what was the Holy Ghost given
[20:42] for in
[20:43] 1959 let me stop here brother Branham
[20:46] goes and starts to explain what that
[20:48] land of adoption was in the Old
[20:51] Testament how you know you were born
[20:53] into you know you were I'll just read
[20:55] what brother Banner says he explains it
[20:57] so well the next thing happened there
[20:58] came a birth into that home
[21:00] now when the Holy Spirit see another
[21:02] Spirit came in which was a son that son
[21:04] he was not in full charge neither was he
[21:07] Heir until he got to a certain age and
[21:09] he proved and he had to be proved first
[21:12] yes and they that had the law of
[21:14] adoption to you ministers the place
[21:15] English son is what I'm speaking on see
[21:17] when he came to a place where he was
[21:19] adopted and Jesus gave a beautiful
[21:21] illustration of it on the mount
[21:23] Transfiguration there we just read and
[21:25] brother Benham says as I said God will
[21:27] never go outside of his laws to do
[21:29] anything if you got an Artesian well and
[21:32] brother random just starts to dramatize
[21:33] the story if you have an Artesian well
[21:35] on this hill blowing all the water over
[21:37] there on the air and on this other Hill
[21:39] over here you've got a crop burning up
[21:41] you can stand on this hill and holler oh
[21:44] water run over here and fill my crop oh
[21:47] water get to my crop and it'll never do
[21:49] that but if you work according to the
[21:51] law of gravitation you can water that
[21:54] crop if you put the crop here and the
[21:56] hill brings the water down naturally so
[21:58] you have a sick man laying here or a
[22:00] sinner laying here or a man that wants
[22:02] to be right can't give up drinking can't
[22:04] give up smoking can't give up lust and
[22:06] things if you'll just work according to
[22:08] the laws of God and let the Holy Spirit
[22:10] come in here then he's no more of his
[22:12] own he will stop that thing because the
[22:15] Holy Spirit takes him over but you've
[22:18] got to work according to the law of God
[22:20] the rules of God now in the Old
[22:23] Testament now this is the explanation
[22:24] now in the Old Testament when the baby
[22:26] was born they watched it to see how it
[22:28] behaved the only way that you can say
[22:30] that Jesus is the Christ is it when the
[22:33] Holy Ghost comes into you and Bears
[22:35] record and witness itself out and says
[22:37] he is the Son of God that's the only way
[22:40] that you know the resurrection is when
[22:42] the Holy Ghost Bears record when he
[22:44] comes the Holy Ghost has come he will
[22:46] testify of me and show you things to
[22:48] come and bring out these things he said
[22:49] to your memories you'll never find it in
[22:51] the school but he'll bring things to
[22:53] your memories and brother brother
[22:54] Branham references John 14 12 verily
[22:57] verily I say unto you he that believeth
[22:59] on me the works that I do who shall he
[23:01] do and also greater which in the right
[23:04] translation here and brother Brennan
[23:05] brings that out many times is actually
[23:07] more if you want to look it up Greater
[23:09] Works more works because I go unto the
[23:11] father so if he went into the Father the
[23:13] Holy Ghost would come is that right
[23:15] another scripture said if I go not away
[23:17] the comforter will not come but if I go
[23:19] away I'll come again and be with you
[23:21] even in you see it's God with you over
[23:24] you first with you in Christ in you in
[23:28] the Holy Ghost it's God in you amen so
[23:33] brother Branham goes on to say then the
[23:35] father being a businessman by this time
[23:37] maybe in his 40s or his 50s he didn't
[23:40] have the time to P to teach the baby
[23:42] himself so in them days they didn't have
[23:44] public schools that they have so they
[23:46] got what they called a tutor or a school
[23:48] teacher and the school teacher was the
[23:50] best that he could find so that he could
[23:51] be truthful to tell what the father was
[23:53] the truth
[23:54] um to tell the Father the truth about it
[23:56] and when this boy got to a certain age
[23:59] say he was matured if that boy was just
[24:01] a renegade no no good didn't care for
[24:04] the father's business all he thought
[24:05] about was flirting and running with
[24:07] woman and drinking and gambling or horse
[24:08] racing that boy would always be a son
[24:10] but he was never placed into position to
[24:13] have air of all that the father had
[24:16] right so he but if he was a good boy and
[24:19] he was about the father's business and
[24:20] he proved to be the right child then
[24:22] they had the ceremony they took the boy
[24:25] into the street and put a white robe on
[24:27] him and they set him on a scaffold so
[24:30] that all the city could see they made a
[24:32] feast in a jubilee and the father then
[24:34] had the ceremony of adoption he adopted
[24:37] his own son into his own business and
[24:39] then the son was co-equal with the
[24:41] father in other words if it had been
[24:42] today then son's name was on the check
[24:45] just as good as the daddies now watch
[24:48] what God did when the son was born he
[24:50] let him go this is so beautiful he let
[24:52] him go for 30 years testing him and
[24:54] trying him then he gave him three years
[24:57] of a harder trial this is Jesus's
[25:00] Ministry and then at the end of that
[25:01] hard trial when you see that his son was
[25:03] about the father's business we see Mount
[25:06] Transfiguration Book of Luke he took
[25:08] Peter James and John the three Witnesses
[25:10] took him on the top of the mountain and
[25:12] there God performed the law of adoption
[25:15] he took up as they seen Jesus close
[25:17] shine white as lightning and as a cloud
[25:20] overshadow him and a voice came out of
[25:21] the cloud and said this is my beloved
[25:24] Son hear ye him
[25:27] my goodness I'll sit down now and have
[25:30] no more to say what he says is Law and
[25:32] Truth what a beautiful what a beautiful
[25:35] story and what a beautiful way that he
[25:37] brings it out because even you know
[25:40] Jesus was always going to have that he
[25:42] was all he was he was he was Christ in a
[25:45] man but he had to go through those
[25:47] testings and then when he did when he
[25:50] came to the end of his ministry God God
[25:52] came and
[25:54] he said hear ye him this is my beloved
[25:56] Son and each one of us have to step into
[25:58] that land of adoption each one of us has
[26:00] to come to those time trying times in
[26:04] our own life and in our own walk with
[26:06] the Lord where we have to make a choice
[26:08] God only calls you you don't you don't
[26:11] come to God unless he calls you so you
[26:13] know the work started God's gonna start
[26:15] the work and he's going to finish the
[26:17] work but there is a little bit of
[26:18] brother random said that I think in
[26:20] choosing of the Bride there is a little
[26:21] bit that we have to do there is
[26:23] something that we have to do and that is
[26:25] we have to we have to take up the cross
[26:27] and follow him and we have to lay aside
[26:29] all those weights that so easily beset
[26:31] us and we have to uh come and and come
[26:35] into that land and recognize that this
[26:37] is this is Jesus recognize this message
[26:40] that this is Jesus trying to unveil
[26:42] himself through through uh through the
[26:46] Holy Ghost in This final age to each one
[26:48] of us that is what the message of the
[26:50] hour is it's Christ unveiled through a
[26:53] bride at the final day to give us what
[26:56] we need to get into a Rapture amen so
[26:59] it's such a beautiful thing now the
[27:00] church has come through schools she
[27:02] married back a long time ago became a
[27:04] denomination in an organization and the
[27:07] birth produced something else and it's
[27:09] got to a place where the Pentecostal
[27:11] church and the New Birth has been tested
[27:13] and tried and now it come to a place and
[27:15] God doesn't deal with churches as an
[27:17] organization he doesn't deal with groups
[27:20] of people he deals with individuals and
[27:22] that's that's that's no that's no secret
[27:25] you know even in this church you know
[27:26] you come to a message church and but I
[27:29] think I don't know if I have it in this
[27:31] quote or not but brother Benham comes to
[27:33] say I mean even even the devil believes
[27:35] the message he believes that it's true
[27:37] he knows that it's true so you could be
[27:39] born into a message Church you could
[27:40] come all your entire life and you could
[27:43] sit under the ministry of the most
[27:44] incredible Ministry and yet you still
[27:47] have never come into your laminate a
[27:48] land of adoption yet because it's a
[27:50] placing and it's there has to come to a
[27:53] Time where that he draws you and you
[27:57] come unto him and then you lay aside
[27:58] everything you lay aside all of it and
[28:01] then God is able to give you the baptism
[28:05] of the Holy Ghost amen that is what that
[28:07] is
[28:09] some holy spirit that say the lutherans
[28:11] that Sanctified the methodists that
[28:13] baptized the Pentecostal is Now setting
[28:15] an order the coming of the Lord Jesus
[28:17] when it will be so powerful that body
[28:20] will come into a group of church that
[28:21] will draw the rest of them from the
[28:22] grave they'll be a resurrection that's
[28:25] what the Holy Ghost is for brother
[28:27] random says in what was the Holy Ghost
[28:29] given for that's what the Holy Ghost is
[28:31] for what is the Holy Ghost without us
[28:33] they cannot be made perfect they lived
[28:35] in one day under that we live in another
[28:37] day and when the enemy comes in like a
[28:39] flood the spirit of God will rise up a
[28:41] standard against it and the enemy has
[28:43] come in like a flood in this last day
[28:45] but guess what the spirit of the Lord
[28:48] Jesus has raised up a standard against
[28:50] him that standard is this message amen
[28:52] and it's such a beautiful thing
[28:56] what is it he's pouring in his Spirit
[28:57] those who are resting out yonder in the
[28:59] grave or under the altar as the
[29:00] scripture says how long Lord how much
[29:02] longer God is waiting listen to this
[29:04] this is powerful brother Benham says God
[29:07] is waiting on you and me and brother
[29:10] Donnie brought that out I think and when
[29:12] he was here in his meetings and you know
[29:13] we can keep going to church and we can
[29:15] keep doing this thing until that last
[29:17] predestinated seed comes into their land
[29:20] of adoption receives the Holy Ghost and
[29:21] then we can be going into a Rapture
[29:23] because he will not lose one he will not
[29:26] lose one he brother Benham says he is
[29:28] waiting on me and you amen wow the
[29:32] church is waiting on you and me adoption
[29:34] time when he can pour into his pour into
[29:36] us his fullness his power his
[29:39] resurrection and then when the church
[29:41] and Christ becomes so close together
[29:43] till Christ becomes visible Among Us and
[29:46] raises the dead and then we go into a
[29:48] Rapture praise the Lord now we're going
[29:51] to say that after a while for those who
[29:53] are filled with the Holy Ghost that goes
[29:54] into the Rapture for the rest of the day
[29:56] said live not for a space of a thousand
[29:58] years
[29:58] and
[30:00] um we're just going to go down here a
[30:02] little bit
[30:04] just have just have a few more minutes
[30:06] here but the the heart of my thought is
[30:11] from the beginning of the scripture
[30:13] bringing everything down to a simplistic
[30:17] scripture of recognizing Jesus and doing
[30:21] it not so much in just the the day and
[30:24] hour that you live in but doing it in
[30:27] the walk with Jesus that you personally
[30:29] have each and every day and and being
[30:33] confident of the very thing Philippians
[30:35] says that that which he hath begun in
[30:39] you
[30:40] that which hath he begun in you
[30:42] will he perform it until the day of
[30:45] Jesus Christ there is a work that God
[30:48] started in you and then there is a work
[30:50] that God will finish in you but there is
[30:53] there is things that we have to do we
[30:55] have to lay aside those things and and
[30:58] I've been going through the seals just
[31:00] by myself here the last few weeks and
[31:03] God brother Brenham starts everything
[31:04] with just the Simplicity God God hides
[31:07] and reveals himself in Simplicity and
[31:09] you go through all that and he keeps
[31:11] pointing back to that and that's what he
[31:13] keeps pointing pointing back to in the
[31:15] scriptures when the Pharisees it's just
[31:17] all about the Simplicity of walking a
[31:20] hidden life in Jesus Christ laying aside
[31:23] those things and when you come through
[31:24] that come through that door it's just
[31:26] you and the Lord Jesus Christ and him
[31:29] and you allowing him to reflect you just
[31:31] a little bit more each and every day
[31:33] amen so that that work that he began in
[31:36] you he can also finish in you amen it's
[31:40] really just such a beautiful
[31:41] representation and going through that
[31:44] and so that when you know when we have
[31:47] our walk to Emmaus and when we're
[31:49] testifying you know we're testifying to
[31:51] the Lord and what he's doing in our life
[31:52] and what he has done in our life and you
[31:55] know unbeknownst to us Jesus is walking
[31:57] with us you know and that's what he is
[31:58] he's walking with us every day of our
[32:00] life he is there with you he's there
[32:02] with you in the hospital room he's there
[32:04] with you in your car he's there with you
[32:06] at your job he's there with you if you
[32:09] have received that Holy Ghost that
[32:11] message for your day and if you have
[32:13] accepted it and you have pressed on into
[32:15] it so let's just stand to our feet this
[32:17] morning
[32:22] it's power hearts Heavenly Father Lord
[32:24] we're so grateful and so thankful Lord
[32:26] for the word
[32:28] Lord we pray that it would be a blessing
[32:30] father and we pray that Lord Lord all
[32:33] the the scriptures and the quotes and it
[32:36] just seems chopped up but father we pray
[32:38] that we can just take it home with us
[32:39] Lord and that we can just ponder it on
[32:41] ponder it throughout the day and
[32:42] throughout the week and Lord let it just
[32:44] change us a little bit more Lord God
[32:46] into your likeness into your image
[32:48] father God help each one of us Lord and
[32:50] if there may be one Among Us Lord maybe
[32:52] listening in that Lord maybe hasn't
[32:54] father God committed everything to you
[32:56] Lord let it just be that time that they
[32:58] do that father we love you now we pray
[33:00] for the ministry we pray that you'd
[33:02] anoint him I pray that you'd help him
[33:03] just step aside and just give us a word
[33:05] this morning well father we love you and
[33:07] we ask all these things now in the
[33:08] lovely name of Jesus Christ amen God
