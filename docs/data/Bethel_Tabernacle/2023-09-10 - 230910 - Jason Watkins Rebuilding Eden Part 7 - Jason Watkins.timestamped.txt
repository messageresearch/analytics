[9:58] accumulates you know how fear
[10:00] accumulates when you're on a plane and
[10:02] someone's scared because there's
[10:03] turbulence then you start getting scared
[10:04] that another person gets scared well the
[10:07] same opposite's true in church when you
[10:08] have faith to reach out and grab a hold
[10:10] of the promise it'll give somebody else
[10:12] faith when you say Hallelujah to the
[10:15] word of God it gives somebody else Faith
[10:16] to say I can I can reach out and break

[36:47] my series on rebuilding Eden this will
[36:49] be part seven and man I thought that it
[36:51] might be the last but it looks like I
[36:53] won't be able to get to everything today
[36:56] and that seems to be by design of the
[36:58] Holy Spirit that's not just me deciding
[37:01] that amen
[37:03] so um we want to read from Luke 17 and
[37:07] then we will let you be seated
[37:11] starting at verse 20
[37:14] and we're going to read down through 27
[37:16] a little lengthy but we'll go quickly
[37:18] Luke 17 verse 20.
[37:21] and when he was demanded of the
[37:23] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[37:26] come
[37:27] he answered them and said the kingdom of
[37:30] God cometh not with observation
[37:32] well that
[37:34] that blew their minds that's not the
[37:36] answer they were expecting
[37:38] neither shall they say Lo here or low
[37:42] there for behold now here's why the
[37:44] kingdom of God is within you see so
[37:47] Jesus was introducing a whole different
[37:49] concept from what Israel had thought the
[37:53] kingdom of God would be brother Branham
[37:55] shows how that they were expecting at
[37:58] any day Messiah to come and he would be
[38:02] a great War General
[38:04] and he would you know come on the scene
[38:06] and he would rally an army of Israel and
[38:09] he would route the Romans and and
[38:11] brother Brandon said what they wanted
[38:12] was a great General and what God sent
[38:15] him was a baby
[38:17] and brother Brown says I love how
[38:19] brother Ram says that he said God did
[38:21] that to humiliate
[38:23] amen praise the Lord I'll tell you if it
[38:25] if it requires my humiliation to make me
[38:28] a believer in the Lord pour it on is
[38:31] that your desire today friends oh we
[38:34] don't want to hide behind anything I
[38:36] want to say pass me not old Gentle
[38:38] Savior amen we want the Lord to you know
[38:41] I I the Bible talks about how that you
[38:45] know people come in they hear the word
[38:46] of God and then they go out and straight
[38:49] away they forget what manner of man or
[38:53] person that the word showed them they
[38:55] were they said it's like looking in a
[38:57] mirror and and when you do the word
[39:00] shows you the real you and then they go
[39:03] right out and forget it just it goes
[39:05] right out of their mind what the word
[39:06] had shown them about themselves and they
[39:10] never make any changes and I just say
[39:11] Lord don't let that be me
[39:14] I I want to be ex I want me exposed to
[39:19] me I don't want to be wrong I don't want
[39:22] to be have have something the the Lord
[39:24] has against me I want to know a man that
[39:27] I am that on that day I can hear him say
[39:29] Well done
[39:30] amen praise the Lord let's finish our
[39:33] reading verse 22. now notice here's he's
[39:36] going to make a make a change here he's
[39:39] gonna just finally he gives the
[39:40] Pharisees an answer that they can't
[39:42] comprehend and he doesn't explain it he
[39:45] turns to his church he turns to his
[39:47] disciples he turns to his family and he
[39:49] starts to explain it more deeply and he
[39:52] said unto his disciples the days will
[39:55] come when ye shall desire to see one of
[39:57] the days of the son of man you shall not
[39:59] see it and they shall say to you see
[40:03] hear or see there go not after them nor
[40:06] follow them
[40:08] for as the lightning that lightness out
[40:10] of one part under Heaven shineth unto
[40:13] the other part unto heaven so shall also
[40:16] the son of man be in his day so there's
[40:19] going to be an initial illumination of
[40:22] the ministry of the son of man that's
[40:24] going to begin in that was in Jesus and
[40:26] it's going to be it's going to
[40:27] transition to his church with the upper
[40:30] room experience right and that's going
[40:33] to run for a while that's the ministry
[40:34] of the son of man but then that church
[40:37] is going to backslide the disciples go
[40:39] off the scene and all the apostles die
[40:41] off and then it goes into the into
[40:43] Through the Ages comes up and at the end
[40:46] as the lightning started in the east in
[40:49] Jerusalem it comes back again to the
[40:51] full ministry of the son of man in the
[40:53] west at the end time the beginning of
[40:56] the ages the ending of the ages right
[40:58] all right so that's why he said you're
[41:00] going to desire to see one of these days
[41:02] but you won't because it and and that's
[41:04] a that's a little forecast about what's
[41:07] going to happen he with this and gives a
[41:09] lot more detail in Matthew 24 but I
[41:12] didn't read it on purpose today I want
[41:14] to stay right here all right now
[41:17] verse 25. or verse 24 again for as the
[41:20] lightning that lightneth out of the one
[41:23] part under Heaven shineth unto the other
[41:25] part unto heaven so shall also the son
[41:27] of man be in his day but first must he
[41:31] suffer many things and be rejected of
[41:34] this generation and as it was in the
[41:37] days of Noah so shall it be also in the
[41:40] days of the son of man now watch the
[41:43] description they did eat they drank they
[41:46] married wives they were given in
[41:48] marriage just normal life
[41:50] is going about their life until the day
[41:53] that Noah entered into the ark and the
[41:55] flood came and destroyed them all
[41:57] likewise also as it was in the days of
[42:00] lot they did eat they drink they bought
[42:03] they sold see how similar it is they
[42:06] they eating they're drinking they're
[42:07] buying and selling their plant they
[42:09] planted they build it but the same day
[42:12] that lot went out of Sodom it rained
[42:15] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[42:17] destroyed them all even thus shall it be
[42:20] in the day when the son of man is
[42:22] revealed in that day he which shall be
[42:26] upon the Housetop and and his stuff in
[42:28] the house let him not come down to take
[42:31] it away and he that is in the field led
[42:34] him likewise not return back remember
[42:36] Lot's wife
[42:38] whosoever shall seek to save his life
[42:42] shall lose it now these are
[42:48] critical guidelines
[42:50] for us at the end time amen
[42:53] amen remember Lot's wife
[42:56] he's talking he's talking about his
[42:57] second coming
[42:58] in most of this some parts of it are are
[43:01] you have to be very careful thankfully
[43:03] we have a prophet to lay it all out for
[43:04] us but but he's he's preaching on his
[43:07] second coming because the question was
[43:09] what about the kingdom of God when is
[43:11] that coming see
[43:12] and so his second coming is what's going
[43:15] to set up the kingdom of God and so one
[43:18] of the things he's warning you as is to
[43:21] look around in the age and when you see
[43:22] the days of Noah and lot repeating
[43:25] be careful remember Lot's wife
[43:28] don't lose sight of that at the end time
[43:31] remember Lot's wife
[43:34] all right
[43:35] whosoever here's another one whosoever
[43:38] can I say it like this whosoever in the
[43:41] last days particularly
[43:43] whosoever as it gets near the Finish
[43:45] Line particularly shall seek to save his
[43:48] life shall lose it and whoso right here
[43:52] at the finish line shall lose his life
[43:54] shall preserve it
[43:56] I tell you that I tell you in that night
[43:59] there shall be two men in one bed the
[44:02] one shall be taken and the other shall
[44:04] be left two women shall be grinding
[44:06] together the one shall be taken and the
[44:09] other left two men shall be in the field
[44:11] and the one taken be taken in the other
[44:13] left and they now watch this is curious
[44:16] and they answered and said unto him
[44:19] where Lord
[44:21] now that's strange instead of wind
[44:23] they're asking him where
[44:25] and he said unto them
[44:28] wheresoever the body is thither will the
[44:32] Eagles be gathered together so what's
[44:34] going to bring the kingdom the body word
[44:37] and the Eagles will gather around it
[44:38] because the before the kingdom comes on
[44:41] Earth the kingdom is within you
[44:43] how does that work a body word that the
[44:45] Eagles gather see and it's going to
[44:48] separate it'll separate two men and two
[44:51] women and two men again it separates
[44:54] before he separates you physically from
[44:58] the Earth
[44:59] in a Rapture he's separating you from
[45:02] the world while you're here
[45:04] right at the Finish Line he finishes
[45:06] that
[45:07] all right we're rebuilding Eden
[45:10] got me let's pray
[45:13] father we thank you for your word this
[45:15] morning
[45:16] I thank you for these divinely revealed
[45:19] truths Lord that come to turn the hearts
[45:21] of the children back to the faith of the
[45:23] fathers Lord if it weren't for that we
[45:26] would we would as the Bible says we
[45:29] James said we even even we would be all
[45:31] together like an under Sodom and
[45:33] Gomorrah Lord we would have no way to
[45:35] know we'd be victims of the blindness
[45:37] that's upon the age just like everyone
[45:39] else but I'm glad Lord that you uh uh
[45:43] you you you impose an injunction against
[45:45] your own judgment you're the only one
[45:47] who could do that Lord that's why it was
[45:49] an angel Who Rose from the East with the
[45:52] Seal of the Living God it was very clear
[45:54] Lord It's the holy spirit because he's
[45:56] the only one who can give the seal and
[45:59] he imposed a temporary stay of execution
[46:02] to give himself time to seal away his
[46:05] Gentile bride and to seal away his his
[46:08] his hundred and forty four thousand so
[46:10] father we're in that little interval of
[46:12] time now where we realize you are doing
[46:15] this finishing work work and your bride
[46:18] you are separating her from man-made
[46:20] ideology separating her from the social
[46:23] status and structure of the world you're
[46:26] separating her Lord from everything of
[46:28] the world and you're drawing her aside
[46:30] unto yourself Lord that she could be a
[46:32] holy a chaste virgin a bride a queen fit
[46:35] to stand by the side of the king Lord I
[46:38] pray today that you'll be our helper as
[46:41] we look into the word in these things in
[46:42] Jesus name amen God bless you friends
[46:45] you can be seated
[47:03] so I am
[47:06] you just keep me in prayer
[47:09] the devil sure has fought this sermon
[47:11] this morning
[47:12] tried every possible
[47:14] way with technical difficulties to
[47:18] um
[47:19] amen calls it to not be as effective as
[47:23] it could as it could be
[47:25] but I'm grateful to the Lord as I just
[47:27] began to pray and Lord begin to Prevail
[47:29] and I'm just
[47:31] trusting in his in his wisdom right now
[47:34] even the order that I want to go I'm I'm
[47:37] just before him so you just be praying
[47:39] for me will you do it
[47:41] amen amen
[47:45] when we think about the rebuilding of
[47:48] Eden
[47:50] we have said to you
[47:53] in previous installments how that the
[47:57] first thing that he would need to do in
[48:00] the rebuilding of Eden would be to
[48:03] rebuild Adam and Eve who had fell by sin
[48:06] in the garden who had lost the
[48:09] Consciousness that they had ever had
[48:10] that kind of relationship who had you
[48:14] know brother Branham when he's when he's
[48:16] talking about the threefold about the
[48:18] singular
[48:19] uh goal that God had in the back part of
[48:24] his mind which was expression that was
[48:26] his one goal in all the Bible but that
[48:29] how that he would unfold his one goal in
[48:33] three phases that first he would he
[48:36] would restore the first Adam see because
[48:39] remember that when he restores first
[48:41] he's got to he's got to uh come and be
[48:45] the full manifestation of all the upon
[48:48] of all the prophets and Priests and
[48:50] kings and so he's got to First fully
[48:52] restore and show Christ he's got to
[48:55] return back to where the Son of God
[48:58] because that's what the Bible says Adam
[48:59] was Bible doesn't even call Adam a Son
[49:02] of God it calls him the son of God
[49:04] so that that whole image of the Son of
[49:07] God has first got to be re-established
[49:10] and he lived that out and brother I'm
[49:14] sitting in all the lives of all those
[49:15] Old Testament people
[49:17] that's what he's doing and he's living
[49:20] out the you you remember that I'm saying
[49:24] to I've said it here before her brother
[49:27] and I were just discussing it recently
[49:28] how that brother Brandon would say Jesus
[49:32] Christ is in every verse of the Bible
[49:35] now that's a strange statement because I
[49:37] can read verses I can't see him really I
[49:40] can read how you know I can read about
[49:42] murder and I can read about adultery and
[49:44] I can read about incestual relationships
[49:46] and I can read about heinous deeds and
[49:49] worshiping you know of false gods and I
[49:53] I can't reconcile that with Jesus but
[49:57] yet I've got a prophet saying he's in
[49:59] every verse and if you don't see it you
[50:02] missed it go back and read it again
[50:04] so I did that and I still didn't see it
[50:07] and this was years ago the Lord helped
[50:09] me with this and I went back and I read
[50:11] those passages again
[50:13] and I still I said Lord I can't see you
[50:16] and you know I can see David taking
[50:19] another man's wife and having her
[50:21] husband murdered and I I can see Israel
[50:24] worshiping false gods and I can even
[50:27] your servants are making mistakes and
[50:29] even Aaron is building a calf while
[50:33] Moses is in horrib and and he he's at
[50:35] Sinai and he's building a calf and that
[50:38] children of Israel are worshiping false
[50:39] gods I can see I can see all of these
[50:42] heinous deeds and acts of God's family
[50:46] and I said Lord I just can't see Christ
[50:49] there and the Holy Spirit just said what
[50:52] did a prophet say and I said well the
[50:54] prophet said read it again he said or
[50:56] read it again so I read it again and
[50:59] again and I finally I said Lord I can't
[51:02] see because the Lord said why can't you
[51:05] see it and I said because I can't see
[51:07] that that you did any of these things
[51:10] and the Lord's and the Holy Spirit spoke
[51:13] right to my just a very young man and he
[51:16] said that's correct I didn't but you
[51:19] have done them and my family has been
[51:22] guilty of them and I took your sin upon
[51:25] me
[51:27] so yes you can read me into every verse
[51:30] and every line whether it was a great
[51:32] Victory or whether it was God rich and
[51:35] mercy
[51:38] redeeming his family who brother Brandon
[51:40] said he would not he's God and he will
[51:42] not be defeated I'm so glad
[51:45] and so once he re-establishes
[51:49] Adam in the life of Jesus now the
[51:52] ministry of the Son of God is
[51:54] reestablished in the earth now part now
[51:56] now we can get back to bringing the
[51:58] kingdom because that's what Adam and Eve
[52:01] were going to do originally be fruitful
[52:03] and multiply and brother Brandon we've
[52:06] been uh the brothers here we've been
[52:07] going through spoken word as Original
[52:08] Seed and brother Branham is making that
[52:10] so clear Christ was the child Eve would
[52:13] have had had she waited see it the Adam
[52:16] and Eve were the beginning of a whole
[52:18] Kingdom a whole Kingdom of Sons and
[52:21] Daughters of God but they fell and so
[52:25] now God's got to re bring it back and so
[52:28] the first thing he's got to do is get
[52:29] Adam re-established then he's got to get
[52:32] even brother Branham said now that's the
[52:34] second phase of his ministry to have
[52:37] preeminence over his church his body
[52:40] right so that comes in the upper room
[52:42] the Holy Ghost comes and now the
[52:45] ministry of the son of man is now
[52:47] working in the bride she's carrying on
[52:50] that's why brother Branham said it's a
[52:51] continuation he was the beginning of
[52:54] that of the creation of God and you are
[52:57] the continuation of that same creation
[53:00] man so so these things are Elementary to
[53:03] us and so so we realize that she is
[53:07] carrying on in his stead we we talked
[53:10] about it last time you see it in the in
[53:12] the ministry of Melchizedek you see
[53:14] because that's the scripture that two
[53:17] two places where brother Branham
[53:20] constantly went more than any other
[53:23] place and one is the woman at the well
[53:26] and the other is Abraham sitting in a
[53:29] tent and Melchizedek with his back
[53:31] discerns the heart of Sarah
[53:33] and the prophet went there almost more
[53:36] other than perhaps Hebrews 13 8 he went
[53:38] to those scriptures more than almost any
[53:41] other scripture combined and and because
[53:44] it's showing that the ministry of the
[53:46] son of man is now working in the in the
[53:49] body because that's his second phase
[53:52] first to re-establish Christ and and
[53:55] bring forth the image of the Lamb of God
[53:57] second to gain preeminence in his body
[54:00] the church and third to now what are we
[54:03] doing restore the kingdom
[54:06] can I say it rebuild Eden
[54:10] restore the kingdom back to its rightly
[54:14] position I know your lives are wrong now
[54:18] I know you've made mistakes but all
[54:21] wrongs are gonna be made right
[54:24] thank God Hallelujah there's nothing
[54:27] that follows me into that new world I
[54:30] have a body that's never failed I'll
[54:33] have a mind that's never been on pure
[54:36] Hallelujah nothing hangs on me going
[54:39] there thank God thank God thank God
[54:44] oh my think of it friends
[54:46] think of it today sometimes we we loathe
[54:50] our past failures think of a body that's
[54:52] never failed think of a mind that's
[54:55] never had a wrong thought oh think of a
[54:58] there that that that that that body that
[55:01] I'm gonna give it's never been envious
[55:03] it's never been jealous it's never hated
[55:05] it's never failed to forgive it's never
[55:07] lusted it's never been been weary it's
[55:10] never it's never been a failure
[55:13] oh my
[55:15] God so he's rebuilding
[55:18] Eden
[55:19] he's rebuilding Adam and Eve he's so
[55:24] that he can bring forth the kingdom of
[55:26] God
[55:28] so they're asking him they're not the
[55:29] only ones
[55:31] the church wanted to know the Pharisees
[55:33] that representing the nominal churches
[55:35] we have that today they just don't call
[55:37] them Pharisees and Sadducees they call
[55:40] them Catholic and methodists and
[55:42] Presbyterian Lutheran and Baptist and
[55:44] UPC and all these other things brother
[55:46] Branham he said you shouldn't you
[55:48] shouldn't be so Politically Incorrect
[55:49] I'm sorry let me clean it up brother
[55:51] Branham called it names of blasphemy
[55:56] so if we're going to be politically
[55:57] incorrect let's just go all the way
[56:00] their names of blasphemy see brother
[56:03] that's what the Book of Revelation calls
[56:06] them names of blasphemy brother Branham
[56:08] called him in his Kentucky English
[56:10] Blasphemous names
[56:12] see it's blasphemy to to to to to say
[56:16] you know the Church of God as a
[56:19] denomination that's blasphemy to the
[56:21] Holy Ghost because the Church of God is
[56:24] not a denomination the Church of Christ
[56:26] is not a denomination I defy that lie
[56:29] Pentecost is not a denomination that's a
[56:32] lie of the devil it's a living breathing
[56:35] experience that you need an I need and
[56:39] we not only need it once I need it many
[56:41] times I need fillings and refillings and
[56:44] refillings why because I'm growing I'm
[56:46] growing I'm growing
[56:51] so he's it requires it's it's now
[56:55] leading to the complete restoration of
[56:58] the kingdom of Christ and you are
[57:01] invited today to be a part of that
[57:03] that's what's at stake
[57:06] yeah that's what's up
[57:08] the choice is yours
[57:12] that's what's up
[57:13] the kingdom is being restored
[57:16] what's at stake your Eternal destination
[57:19] to either be a part of that Kingdom let
[57:22] me tell you something friends there's no
[57:24] as brother Jack Duff says so poetically
[57:28] you're never going to hear the voice in
[57:31] Revelation 4 that says come up
[57:34] unless you first hear the voice of
[57:36] Revelation 18 that says come out
[57:40] you're going to have to come out if you
[57:42] want to come up
[57:44] see
[57:45] and so you're never going to inherit
[57:48] that Kingdom
[57:50] without a new birth and without not not
[57:52] in the position of the Bride Anyway by
[57:54] no means I understand that the granting
[57:57] of eternal life to the foolish virgin
[57:59] but boy don't ever get those confused
[58:02] with the nominal uh debauchery you see
[58:05] these days that is so the church
[58:07] so-called the foolish virgin are first
[58:10] of all righteous people
[58:12] second of all they're saved
[58:15] that's probably first they're saved
[58:18] they're not they're not born again
[58:19] that's redeemed
[58:21] born again is redemption
[58:24] and that's further than salvation but
[58:26] they have trusted in Christ for real and
[58:29] there God has has granted them the work
[58:32] of the Holy Spirit upon their life has
[58:35] forgiven all of their sins and has
[58:37] Sanctified them and that's why they're
[58:40] they're called righteous in Matthew 25
[58:43] and they're called Saints in the Book of
[58:47] Revelation and Saint means Sanctified
[58:50] one
[58:51] see so don't don't get those confused
[58:54] when we think about lot and his DOT wife
[58:57] and daughters his wife and daughters
[58:59] don't represent the foolish virgin they
[59:01] represent the nominal Church his wife
[59:03] got destroyed and and he said well his
[59:06] daughter survived only for a while only
[59:08] to complete God's word because there had
[59:10] to come a moabite a woman named Ruth who
[59:13] came out of Moab and became the wife of
[59:16] of Boaz who would bring forth Jesse who
[59:19] would bring forth David who would bring
[59:21] forth Christ and when God was done with
[59:23] that the moabites in the ammonites were
[59:26] all assimilated by conquering Nations
[59:28] and they no longer exist as a culture
[59:30] anywhere in the world
[59:32] you understand
[59:34] so so so you you you've got to keep all
[59:37] that straight so
[59:39] so that's what's at stake it's high
[59:43] stakes decisions you know what when
[59:46] we're when we're preaching on this
[59:48] subject I I would say to you today that
[59:51] what I'm preaching on and have been
[59:52] preaching on in this series
[59:54] uh is is high stakes Ministry and and
[59:58] not to not to mean that the what I'm
[1:00:00] preaching is is is so high but what it's
[1:00:05] implying
[1:00:06] and what it's identifying that you're
[1:00:09] living in I mean it should it should be
[1:00:12] capturing your laser focus
[1:00:16] because we're at the finish line and
[1:00:19] this is the whole ball of wax this is
[1:00:21] all or none
[1:00:23] see you you're not going to be able to
[1:00:26] go into the Rapture if you're if you're
[1:00:29] not if your life is refusing to say Amen
[1:00:33] to every word of God now I understand we
[1:00:36] fail I get that that's no problem that
[1:00:39] don't even count
[1:00:42] there is no more condemnation to them
[1:00:44] which are in Christ you can't be
[1:00:46] indicted for your mistakes and failures
[1:00:48] the the Perpetual atoning blood the
[1:00:51] voice of Christ constantly speaking and
[1:00:54] Satan can't even get into the courtroom
[1:00:56] to accuse you because the The Blood
[1:00:59] Brother Branham said Christ died for me
[1:01:01] and the blood speaks for me and God
[1:01:03] can't see my sin hallelujah we're not
[1:01:07] talking about your failures past present
[1:01:10] or future the things that you are sorry
[1:01:12] and you repent over we're talking about
[1:01:14] the willful
[1:01:15] Disobedience to the word that God sent
[1:01:19] in this hour and if you are not willing
[1:01:22] to line up every aspect of your life to
[1:01:25] the message that William Branham brought
[1:01:28] you will miss the rapture
[1:01:31] there is no chance for you to go
[1:01:35] unless your whole life is willing to say
[1:01:38] Amen now the application of it we
[1:01:42] stumble and fall don't worry that's fine
[1:01:44] you're going to get you get credit for
[1:01:45] his life on that
[1:01:48] but you can't be in Defiance
[1:01:50] you can't say I'm just I just think that
[1:01:53] was William branham's opinion and I just
[1:01:55] don't think I have to do that you're
[1:01:58] going to be left behind
[1:02:01] now hey Bethel Tabernacle in 28 almost
[1:02:04] 29 years have you ever caught me in a
[1:02:07] lie
[1:02:08] I've never lied to you I'm telling you
[1:02:11] parents children teenagers young people
[1:02:15] old people married people single people
[1:02:18] the people who go in a Rapture are
[1:02:21] people who say Amen to every word
[1:02:29] and whether I can apply it successfully
[1:02:32] that's on God
[1:02:34] I already know I can't
[1:02:36] that's just on the Holy Spirit to get me
[1:02:39] there
[1:02:40] amen and he hasn't uh amazing
[1:02:44] imaginative ways
[1:02:46] of of getting you there
[1:02:48] he won't do it against your will he just
[1:02:50] has ways of changing your will
[1:02:55] but listen friends it's high stakes
[1:02:57] because we're talking about your Eternal
[1:02:59] destination and being a part of the
[1:03:01] first resurrection
[1:03:03] so while the world is going through a
[1:03:05] time of cataclysmic tribulation you can
[1:03:09] be safe in glory
[1:03:13] it's not like I'm offering you a bad
[1:03:15] deal
[1:03:16] I'm offering you the best deal that's
[1:03:18] ever been offered to people who are the
[1:03:20] most unworthy
[1:03:22] say why am I so unworthy because you're
[1:03:25] a human
[1:03:26] born in sin
[1:03:28] see you're the you're the offender the
[1:03:30] animal world didn't offend God humans
[1:03:32] did
[1:03:33] yeah see
[1:03:34] so so we realize that the life ahead of
[1:03:37] you
[1:03:38] know we have a life that's ahead of us
[1:03:40] friends that defies all attempts to
[1:03:43] describe it
[1:03:44] It's So Glorious and I as I've said to
[1:03:47] you before brother Branham when he came
[1:03:49] back from Beyond the curtain of time he
[1:03:51] had little trouble telling us what he
[1:03:53] saw described it in in panoramic detail
[1:03:56] he had no trouble telling us what he
[1:03:58] heard but what he couldn't describe was
[1:04:00] how he felt
[1:04:01] and he said if you just if you believe
[1:04:03] me to be a prophet he said you just
[1:04:05] believe this that just beyond this last
[1:04:07] breath just beyond this Veil is a world
[1:04:10] you can't even begin
[1:04:12] you have no idea he said I can't even
[1:04:15] describe it I don't even have the words
[1:04:17] to describe it so the stakes be higher
[1:04:23] amen
[1:04:25] so maybe maybe you will love me more for
[1:04:29] taking seven and probably eight maybe
[1:04:32] nine and ten parts
[1:04:33] getting us home
[1:04:36] even if it steps on some toes will you
[1:04:39] love me even more
[1:04:40] I'm trying to get us home
[1:04:43] Hallelujah
[1:04:44] ah true
[1:04:47] I could almost speak in tongues my
[1:04:49] goodness
[1:04:50] wow
[1:04:52] get it wrong
[1:04:57] steaks are so high
[1:05:00] to get it wrong will cost you everything
[1:05:07] you if you try to go in at 99
[1:05:10] you'll fail and lose all the 99 you
[1:05:13] achieved
[1:05:15] this is all or none you're either in or
[1:05:17] you're out you're either there's no
[1:05:20] brother Brandon said there's no black
[1:05:22] white bird or no white black bird
[1:05:24] it's it's you're in or you're out
[1:05:28] you're a Believer or you're not
[1:05:32] Stakes couldn't be higher
[1:05:35] see
[1:05:36] so how sure you know I
[1:05:40] I mean brother Jason how are you how how
[1:05:44] are how are you so convinced you know
[1:05:47] you know how how are you to be how am I
[1:05:49] let me let me speak for you how how are
[1:05:52] we
[1:05:53] gonna be sure to make the same choice
[1:05:59] to make the same choice to make the
[1:06:01] right choice the same choice that God's
[1:06:03] family has made down Through the Ages
[1:06:06] see because if you're if you're
[1:06:09] uncertain of what is right
[1:06:14] then there's no way to be certain what's
[1:06:16] wrong
[1:06:20] all right
[1:06:21] so don't imagine God would have left us
[1:06:25] in the large like that he has sent us
[1:06:28] what is right
[1:06:30] and if you and if you have a a problem
[1:06:34] with what is right you're never going to
[1:06:37] be able to avoid what's wrong
[1:06:39] and when he comes if you're found in the
[1:06:42] wrong you miss everything you lose
[1:06:44] everything
[1:06:45] Jesus said if they knew when when the
[1:06:48] master would return they they would have
[1:06:50] not got caught unawares don't get caught
[1:06:52] unawares
[1:06:54] we're at the Finish Line it's going home
[1:06:56] time
[1:07:00] so you forgive me won't you please if I
[1:07:05] seemed to drive home so strongly this
[1:07:09] warning that I keep coming to every time
[1:07:12] I come into this Pulpit on this series
[1:07:14] and I keep warning us that we must not
[1:07:17] compromise with the impersonation of
[1:07:21] Christianity
[1:07:24] amen
[1:07:26] so don't don't don't don't think of it
[1:07:28] as beating a dead horse the stakes are
[1:07:31] too high
[1:07:33] see
[1:07:34] a true and a full experience
[1:07:37] of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:40] in the in what we would call the new
[1:07:42] birth
[1:07:45] versus the what brother Branham would
[1:07:48] call living in varying degrees of
[1:07:51] sanctification
[1:07:53] is so close those two things are so
[1:07:56] close
[1:07:58] see and I'm talking about the real fire
[1:08:01] breathing experience of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:04] versus living in varying degrees of
[1:08:06] sanctification those are both the work
[1:08:08] of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:09] it's the Holy Ghost in justification
[1:08:11] it's the Holy Ghost in sanctification
[1:08:14] but that's a that's the that's a
[1:08:16] millennial leap from being born again
[1:08:20] and the difference is the born-again go
[1:08:22] in the first resurrection all who are
[1:08:25] who just stop at varying degrees of
[1:08:28] Sanctified life and believe in believing
[1:08:31] God sent a prophet
[1:08:34] camp out with the foolish virgin in the
[1:08:36] tribulation
[1:08:41] Jesus said to her so close it would
[1:08:43] deceive the elected if it was possible
[1:08:45] you say wait a minute I thought that's I
[1:08:49] thought that's the nominal Church what
[1:08:51] that's not going to fool any Christian
[1:08:54] good grief the the Tommy rot like the
[1:08:59] nonsense I showed that's not going to
[1:09:01] fool us
[1:09:03] the Asbury Revival is not going to fool
[1:09:05] me
[1:09:06] I I
[1:09:08] I'm not doubting their sincerity but I
[1:09:10] still see women in jeans and cutting
[1:09:12] their hair I still see men smoking
[1:09:13] drinking and cussing
[1:09:15] it's not going to trick me
[1:09:18] there's no chance that's not close
[1:09:21] what is so close that it would deceive
[1:09:23] the very elected is that fine line
[1:09:26] between believing what God has done in
[1:09:28] this day and allowing sanctification to
[1:09:30] come into your life but never coming to
[1:09:33] the full surrender say how do I get
[1:09:35] there you got to repent
[1:09:36] which means you got to say Amen to every
[1:09:40] word
[1:09:42] there's no accepted repentance outside
[1:09:44] of that
[1:09:46] so the stakes are high friends so don't
[1:09:48] feel bad at me if I'm in my seventh part
[1:09:51] still drilling this trying to trying to
[1:09:54] get it into the church
[1:09:57] see because varying degrees of
[1:09:59] sanctification
[1:10:01] I mean brother Branham said it'll it'll
[1:10:04] make you clean up your life
[1:10:06] it'll make you start going to church
[1:10:08] it'll make you stop your lying and stop
[1:10:11] your cheating and and you'll even say oh
[1:10:14] I believe the message brother Brandon
[1:10:15] says that right on tape he says you know
[1:10:17] he says remember
[1:10:19] Satan believes
[1:10:22] and brother Branham says he doesn't make
[1:10:24] believe he actually believes but he's
[1:10:27] not born again
[1:10:28] because he knowing the will of God
[1:10:30] knowing the word of God he refuses to do
[1:10:32] it
[1:10:33] see but he certainly believes that the
[1:10:36] Apostle said you believe in God you do
[1:10:39] well so does the devil
[1:10:42] it'll make you start going to church
[1:10:44] it'll make you it'll make you a believer
[1:10:47] of what God has done in this day and
[1:10:49] brother Brandon would say you say oh
[1:10:50] brother Branham I believe it he says but
[1:10:53] I'm asking you will you do it
[1:10:55] because it's hearing
[1:10:58] recognizing and acting on the word of
[1:11:01] God
[1:11:02] I'm not going to be guilty friends I'm
[1:11:04] not going to stand there on that day I'm
[1:11:06] sorry I'm not willing to stand there on
[1:11:09] that day and with a broken heart that
[1:11:12] any of you missed it because I didn't
[1:11:14] tell you
[1:11:16] I already know I have passed from Death
[1:11:19] to life I'm already sealed in the
[1:11:21] Kingdom I'm already in Heavenly places
[1:11:23] in Christ Jesus I'm not worried about my
[1:11:25] destination but I want to make sure you
[1:11:28] get to go with me
[1:11:30] Hallelujah so I'm never going to stop
[1:11:34] preaching and pleading and praying I'm
[1:11:37] never I might have to preach I might I'm
[1:11:39] on part seven today I might need 107 but
[1:11:41] I gotta get this to where the nail
[1:11:44] clinch is we are believers
[1:11:47] and that calls for a very distinct
[1:11:50] separation from the world
[1:11:52] there's no marginalizing there's no
[1:11:54] there's no gray areas of it I mean
[1:11:57] you're either a Believer or you're not a
[1:11:58] believer
[1:12:02] because as I said brother Branham talks
[1:12:05] about that
[1:12:06] sanctification will make you clean up
[1:12:08] your life it'll make you stop lying and
[1:12:10] cheating it'll you'll start going to
[1:12:11] church and you'll even agree with 99 of
[1:12:14] the word for your life
[1:12:17] so
[1:12:20] can you see why the Holy Spirit keeps
[1:12:23] bringing me back to it again and again
[1:12:26] and again I promise you I'm not short on
[1:12:29] material
[1:12:31] I got files and files of stuff I want to
[1:12:34] preach on
[1:12:35] but I don't get to choose that
[1:12:39] so I think that I dealt with
[1:12:41] the impersonation of Christianity very
[1:12:44] sufficiently some Wednesday nights ago
[1:12:48] so much so that I I believe it should be
[1:12:50] a Hallmark for this church for the rest
[1:12:52] of our days and one of the things that I
[1:12:55] have kept emphasizing to you is that I'm
[1:12:58] preaching to Believers this series is
[1:13:00] not a Outreach series to the Lost I'm
[1:13:04] preaching to believers
[1:13:07] see
[1:13:08] we can see according you know to Bible
[1:13:11] prophecy that as bad as the world is
[1:13:15] right now it's going to get much worse
[1:13:19] much much worse you see and and we've
[1:13:24] we've ministered before that if you
[1:13:25] can't win against the footman how are
[1:13:27] you going to handle the horsemen
[1:13:29] how are you going to run against how are
[1:13:30] you going to fight against the horse if
[1:13:32] the footman take you out
[1:13:33] come on this is your daily everyday
[1:13:35] walking around life if the simple things
[1:13:38] of laodicea keep you from having a
[1:13:40] spiritual experience with Christ you
[1:13:42] ain't even seen nothing yet
[1:13:44] it's going to get much worse than it is
[1:13:47] right now
[1:13:48] it's and we're now and and that you say
[1:13:51] are you trying to scare us maybe I don't
[1:13:53] know but we got little children in here
[1:13:56] and so I have no qualms of saying to you
[1:13:59] parents come on
[1:14:00] come on we can't afford we gotta have we
[1:14:04] want our children with us
[1:14:06] I don't want to see my children and my
[1:14:08] grandchildren cry go out into the world
[1:14:10] thinking that's okay it's not okay
[1:14:15] and all the ones who are out there I
[1:14:17] want them all back
[1:14:18] whoever Satan is holding prisoner of war
[1:14:21] I want him back
[1:14:22] Hallelujah
[1:14:24] and I will not rest until we have them
[1:14:27] back in the fall
[1:14:29] glory to God
[1:14:32] we concluded some Wednesdays ago I felt
[1:14:35] very much led to the Lord
[1:14:37] you know to
[1:14:39] Amen brother
[1:14:41] to wreck men to those
[1:14:43] uh who struggle you know
[1:14:46] with these things and then I made this
[1:14:48] recommendation to you I if you find
[1:14:51] yourself struggling with saying Amen to
[1:14:54] every word that came by a prophet then
[1:14:56] go back and reevaluate your confidence
[1:14:58] in the in the message and the messenger
[1:15:01] and go to God in prayer and say Lord
[1:15:04] make this a reality to me not just
[1:15:06] something I've been taught but I don't
[1:15:08] just want to know your your your your
[1:15:10] acts and your history I want to know
[1:15:12] your ways
[1:15:15] so we we want we might need to
[1:15:17] reevaluate our confidence in the message
[1:15:19] and the messenger God sent in these last
[1:15:21] days to teach us the word and to
[1:15:24] interpret the word of God to us for this
[1:15:26] unprecedented hour you know it's amazing
[1:15:29] if you you you would absolutely agree if
[1:15:32] I was if I was uh ministering you know
[1:15:35] to to a Muslim and you were standing
[1:15:38] there and and I would say to the Muslim
[1:15:42] that do you believe that Jesus was a
[1:15:46] true Prophet the Muslim was absolutely
[1:15:47] because the Quran speaks of Jesus in
[1:15:51] that way
[1:15:52] and so do you believe he was a true
[1:15:54] prophet of God yes well he said he is
[1:15:58] the way and the truth and the life and
[1:16:02] no man comes to God except through him
[1:16:04] now is he a true Prophet or not
[1:16:08] right
[1:16:09] so so so so so then you know when when
[1:16:13] uh when when we come to the scripture
[1:16:16] where you know it talks about how that
[1:16:19] you know let a man work out his own
[1:16:21] salvation and fear and trembling and
[1:16:23] brother Branham says that's only until
[1:16:25] the Holy Ghost comes
[1:16:28] see once the Holy Ghost comes then you
[1:16:30] got your will is gone and brother
[1:16:33] Branham talks about how that that the
[1:16:35] the word is interpreted to us that the
[1:16:38] word is of no private
[1:16:41] so do you believe William Branham was a
[1:16:43] prophet
[1:16:44] do you believe he was the Elijah that
[1:16:45] was to come just like I would say to the
[1:16:48] Muslim do you believe Jesus was a
[1:16:49] prophet well here's what he said Do You
[1:16:51] Believe William Brandon was God's
[1:16:52] Prophet for this last day well here's
[1:16:54] what he said when he went to that
[1:16:55] scripture that no scripture is of
[1:16:58] private interpretation and brother our
[1:17:00] Prophet said that's because God sends a
[1:17:03] prophet and gives you the interpretation
[1:17:06] there's no private you don't get to have
[1:17:08] your own private interpretation you
[1:17:11] don't get to water it down or make a
[1:17:13] message like we had one voice that gave
[1:17:16] us the interpretation of the word and
[1:17:19] there's nobody authorized to go behind
[1:17:21] him and vet his teachings
[1:17:25] see
[1:17:28] so we see the day approaching more and
[1:17:31] more that Paul spoke of so clearly I'm
[1:17:34] trying to watch my time very carefully
[1:17:36] amen excuse me I'm gonna have to make an
[1:17:38] adjustment here
[1:17:48] here we find that and don't don't don't
[1:17:50] follow it uh in the booth so let me just
[1:17:52] let me just quote these out because I'm
[1:17:54] going to move quickly
[1:17:56] but Paul makes the statement in second
[1:17:58] Timothy chapter three you can go home
[1:18:01] and read it verses one to four that Paul
[1:18:04] talks about the in the last days
[1:18:06] perilous times shall come
[1:18:10] see and as I've said to you before it
[1:18:12] wasn't that they didn't have perilous
[1:18:14] times in their day but you're at an
[1:18:16] unprecedented level there's never been
[1:18:18] an age like this day you're in the worst
[1:18:20] age of all it's it's went beyond even a
[1:18:23] prophet thought 1977 it went so dark
[1:18:26] nobody could survive that yet here we
[1:18:28] are
[1:18:29] and I would like to say we are surviving
[1:18:33] but in the last days perilous times
[1:18:35] would come he warned that there would
[1:18:36] come blasphemers
[1:18:38] he warned that there would be false
[1:18:40] accusers
[1:18:42] he warned that there would be despisers
[1:18:45] of those that are good so it shouldn't
[1:18:47] it shouldn't stun you that God's
[1:18:50] messenger gets attacked in this day it
[1:18:52] shouldn't stun you that the world thinks
[1:18:54] you're Politically Incorrect
[1:18:56] because this is the age where people are
[1:18:59] despisers of those that are good
[1:19:01] this is the age where false accusers
[1:19:04] come on the scene this is the age where
[1:19:06] blasphemers come what age perilous age
[1:19:09] see
[1:19:10] this is the time he goes on to show in
[1:19:13] the fourth verse that we will have
[1:19:15] traitors come on the scene
[1:19:18] so you've got you've got perilous times
[1:19:20] you've got blasphemers you've got false
[1:19:22] accusers you've got despisers of those
[1:19:25] that are good you've got traitors
[1:19:27] heading high-minded you've got lovers of
[1:19:30] pleasure more than lovers of God now
[1:19:33] that
[1:19:34] that implies that you do have a certain
[1:19:40] amount of love and affection for God
[1:19:42] that's not the issue the problem is you
[1:19:44] just don't love him as much as the world
[1:19:49] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:19:52] God
[1:19:53] here's a here's a here's a crippling one
[1:19:55] that has fallen Upon Us in this day
[1:19:59] and and why I had to make a clear Line
[1:20:03] in the Sand on the video I showed
[1:20:06] yeah because you've got those coming in
[1:20:08] the last day having a form of godliness
[1:20:11] but denying the power thereof in other
[1:20:14] words brother Branham said they're never
[1:20:16] willing to allow the Holy Ghost to come
[1:20:18] they're they're denying the life they
[1:20:21] have a form of godliness they sing songs
[1:20:24] and have churches but they don't allow
[1:20:26] the life of the word to come into their
[1:20:29] life and you can see it
[1:20:31] you can see that they're not living in
[1:20:34] the image of the Bible I'm not insulting
[1:20:36] them I'm not attacking them I'm warning
[1:20:39] you perilous times are here
[1:20:42] and these are the kind of things that
[1:20:44] that that false church is never willing
[1:20:47] to allow the Holy Spirit to come and
[1:20:50] give them a life-changing power see
[1:20:54] and and they attack they even attack
[1:20:57] the truth of those who carry it I was
[1:20:59] somebody was telling me just recently
[1:21:01] that
[1:21:02] they somebody I don't remember now the
[1:21:04] story they got witnessed to and and they
[1:21:07] seemed very receptive until they went
[1:21:08] over to our mega church and sat down
[1:21:10] with that Pastor and he told them that I
[1:21:12] was a false teacher and William Branham
[1:21:13] was a false prophet and we were a bunch
[1:21:15] of cultists
[1:21:16] my goodness if this produces a cult then
[1:21:20] thank God
[1:21:21] I'm one of them
[1:21:24] I'm so glad I can say I'm not one of
[1:21:27] them
[1:21:29] amen I'll take the life of the Bible any
[1:21:32] day it'll get me home it's my ticket
[1:21:34] home
[1:21:35] see
[1:21:37] so they attacked the truth of those who
[1:21:39] carry it it's not a it's not a new
[1:21:41] tactic by the enemy listen it's not a
[1:21:43] new tactic by the enemy to attack God's
[1:21:45] Messengers
[1:21:46] you realize from the scripture that's
[1:21:48] not novel that's not new that's first
[1:21:50] thing I tell them yeah you're you're not
[1:21:51] original you're not novel in any way
[1:21:54] don't think too highly of yourself
[1:21:55] you're simple that's been going on for 2
[1:21:59] 000 years
[1:22:00] you know and so you realize that from
[1:22:03] the scripture they they did the exact
[1:22:04] same thing to Paul it's in the Bible
[1:22:06] they did the exact same thing to John
[1:22:08] the the Apostle of love
[1:22:12] come on if you're gonna attack John what
[1:22:14] kind of monster are you
[1:22:17] is the Apostle of Love he's known
[1:22:21] throughout the land as the Apostle of
[1:22:23] Love loves everybody little children
[1:22:24] love one another
[1:22:26] if you say you love God but hates your
[1:22:28] brother you lie you've got to repent of
[1:22:30] that and yet you've got you've got
[1:22:32] people rising up writing letters and
[1:22:35] sending it to the churches they didn't
[1:22:37] have the internet so they couldn't get
[1:22:39] on YouTube and do it but they wrote
[1:22:41] letters and sent them out to other
[1:22:42] churches saying don't have anything to
[1:22:43] do with John he's a false teacher don't
[1:22:45] hear him
[1:22:46] Paul all Paul is nothing in his letters
[1:22:48] he's very bold but we met him the other
[1:22:50] day and he was a wimp
[1:22:53] he's nobody
[1:22:56] so that's that's not new they they
[1:22:58] attacked their Doctrine my goodness they
[1:23:01] attacked their their credibility they
[1:23:03] attacked the authority of the Apostles
[1:23:06] they even they even attacked their
[1:23:08] character
[1:23:09] my goodness so so you can read that in
[1:23:12] the New Testament in numerous places in
[1:23:14] church history I'm not going to get go
[1:23:16] down that rabbit hole today
[1:23:18] but you know and it is true historically
[1:23:21] factual they did public publish it and
[1:23:24] circulated it and you know my I I I I
[1:23:27] just say you know as a I I can say to
[1:23:31] you today friends thank God I look back
[1:23:33] on my life I look back as just a boy
[1:23:37] and just small five six years old and
[1:23:40] would watch preachers in the pulpit and
[1:23:42] knew someday I'm going to do that
[1:23:44] I sat in the woods as just a very young
[1:23:47] teenager 14 15 years old just like I am
[1:23:50] right now with my Bible open in my
[1:23:52] little hiding spot asking God about my
[1:23:55] life and my Ministry I have studied this
[1:23:58] this book this grand old book for years
[1:24:02] decades and decades and I've studied and
[1:24:05] I and I intentionally didn't go the way
[1:24:07] of theology you know why I didn't do
[1:24:09] that you know why there was nothing in
[1:24:11] me to go to theology school
[1:24:13] because my mom
[1:24:15] I was witnessing to my history teacher
[1:24:18] one time and
[1:24:20] uh seventh uh I don't remember what
[1:24:24] grade but anyway I I loved her she was a
[1:24:28] very kind-hearted woman she was a very
[1:24:30] good history teacher and I started
[1:24:31] witnessing to her she was a nominal
[1:24:33] Christian I started witnessing to her
[1:24:34] about the truth she seemed very
[1:24:36] interested I said can I give you a book
[1:24:37] I'm just a kid in school can I give you
[1:24:40] a book sure be happy to I go home I find
[1:24:42] one I bring it to her I remember now
[1:24:44] what it was and I I you know and I I
[1:24:47] took it to her and I was had I went to
[1:24:49] bed that night with such hopes and my
[1:24:51] goodness maybe she and when I came back
[1:24:54] you know the next day and I waited she
[1:24:57] didn't say anything as you would imagine
[1:24:58] and I waited till after class Miss
[1:25:00] player what did you think about the book
[1:25:03] and she she snared
[1:25:07] and she held up the book and she said
[1:25:09] how much education does this man have
[1:25:13] I was struck my heart she said how much
[1:25:17] theology did
[1:25:19] she was just you know disparaging him
[1:25:21] and disrespecting him this this guy is a
[1:25:24] an idiot
[1:25:26] how much theology I could never I can
[1:25:28] still remember how much Theology and she
[1:25:30] she gave me that sideways look of
[1:25:32] Victory like she had just wanted to
[1:25:34] debate
[1:25:35] silly child how much theology did he
[1:25:38] have
[1:25:39] and I I just took the book back from her
[1:25:42] and went home and I told my mom what
[1:25:43] happened and she said what you should
[1:25:46] have asked her
[1:25:48] is how much neology did he have
[1:25:52] and that stuck in my mind and I never
[1:25:55] forgot and I said Lord I don't need
[1:25:57] theology but I do need neology I need to
[1:26:00] that's where you get down on your knees
[1:26:03] before God and I'm here to tell you
[1:26:05] something friends I've studied that with
[1:26:07] this book open and the seals book opened
[1:26:09] and the church age book opened my whole
[1:26:11] life I found never a discrepancy it's
[1:26:14] it's on you you cannot resist the
[1:26:17] message if you're using the Bible it is
[1:26:20] the absolute word of God not only do I
[1:26:22] see that as a student but I see what it
[1:26:26] has done to my life and your life and
[1:26:28] all of our Lives they'll come from the
[1:26:31] East and West Hallelujah
[1:26:34] East and West to dine with the Kings who
[1:26:37] sent us his guest oh my I want to be
[1:26:40] part of that number friends
[1:26:44] it will be I can tell you this for sure
[1:26:47] that the teaching that Elijah brought us
[1:26:50] in this day
[1:26:51] of how to live our lives and conduct
[1:26:53] ourselves here at the end time it will
[1:26:56] be the measuring standard for right
[1:26:58] standing with God at the end time
[1:27:00] because he's taking us back to Saint
[1:27:02] Paul's teaching and that is
[1:27:05] incontrovertible it will absolutely be
[1:27:08] the qualifier for all who are taken off
[1:27:10] the Earth at the resurrection mark it
[1:27:12] down
[1:27:15] you know I I can't always spend
[1:27:19] the very limited and very valuable
[1:27:23] uh Pulpit time
[1:27:26] that I have preaching this kind of
[1:27:30] thought there's so much many other
[1:27:33] things to preach
[1:27:34] but I I just tell you something friend
[1:27:37] that
[1:27:39] that is just burning in my heart and I
[1:27:41] truly believe it's because it's an it's
[1:27:44] indicative of how close we are to going
[1:27:47] home
[1:27:50] and how much I still yet see in my life
[1:27:53] and your life I still see too much me I
[1:27:56] still see too much you and I'm pleading
[1:27:59] and I'm preaching as hard as I can and
[1:28:01] studying day and night I I told Brother
[1:28:05] Matt I said you want to burn burn a
[1:28:07] four-hour flight in 20 minutes start
[1:28:10] studying a sermon on the flight
[1:28:12] and we lifted off it at San Diego and we
[1:28:15] flew four hours to Atlanta and it felt
[1:28:17] like 15 or 20 minutes while I went
[1:28:19] through this sermon I'm preaching the
[1:28:21] continuation of today
[1:28:24] I don't know of anything more I could do
[1:28:26] or say
[1:28:27] that hasn't been said yet there is more
[1:28:30] to say that I know I won't get to today
[1:28:32] but I'm very grateful and I'm very
[1:28:34] grateful I want to say that I'm very
[1:28:36] grateful for the overwhelming majority
[1:28:39] uh uh in fact is it's been unanimous
[1:28:42] it's not even overwhelming majority I've
[1:28:44] had such unanimous uh statements and
[1:28:48] texts and emails and phone calls and
[1:28:50] people saying from around the world from
[1:28:52] other states from across the ocean
[1:28:54] saying brother Jason this series you're
[1:28:56] on is so vital and so rich and so
[1:29:00] exactly what what I needed in my life
[1:29:02] and I just say well brother then we're
[1:29:04] in the same boat because it's what I
[1:29:05] need in my life my my my how about you
[1:29:08] friends
[1:29:10] see I remain deeply concerned
[1:29:14] I remain deeply concerned as much as I'm
[1:29:16] glad for that I still find myself deeply
[1:29:19] concerned
[1:29:20] with the few too many because one's too
[1:29:24] many with the few too many under my care
[1:29:27] who continue to live on the edge
[1:29:30] and uh to I guess alter a common phrase
[1:29:34] one-third carnality and eat it too
[1:29:37] you know
[1:29:38] I realize that's altering the phrase but
[1:29:41] you know I as I've said before and I say
[1:29:44] again I have great concern
[1:29:47] for those kinds of people come wraps
[1:29:50] your day
[1:29:51] and I'd be dishonest if I didn't say
[1:29:54] that
[1:29:55] when the trumpet of the Lord shall sound
[1:29:58] and time shall be no more
[1:30:01] and that morning breaks Eternal bright
[1:30:04] and fair
[1:30:05] when the saved of Earth Shall Gather
[1:30:08] over on the other Shore and the role is
[1:30:12] Called Up Yonder I'll be there
[1:30:16] will you be there
[1:30:19] on that bright and cloudless morning
[1:30:22] when the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:30:25] and the glory of his resurrection share
[1:30:29] when his Chosen One Shall Gather
[1:30:32] to their home beyond the skies
[1:30:35] and the role is Called Up Yonder
[1:30:39] will you be there
[1:30:42] Hallelujah
[1:30:45] can I have 10 more minutes maybe
[1:30:49] I I don't need it thank you but I don't
[1:30:51] need a half an hour I can I can get it
[1:30:52] if I go half an hour I'd need an hour
[1:30:55] and if I win an hour I'd need 90 minutes
[1:30:57] so let me stop in 10 to 15 minutes here
[1:31:02] I wanna I wanna make a few comments on
[1:31:04] our text that we read
[1:31:06] you know
[1:31:07] the Nazarite it's interesting because
[1:31:10] the Nazarite vows the Bible says in
[1:31:12] numbers 6 4 all the days of his
[1:31:14] separation
[1:31:16] shall he nothing that is made of the
[1:31:18] vine tree from the kernels even to the
[1:31:21] husk so when he's in a Nazarite battle
[1:31:24] and a Nazarite vow you don't have to be
[1:31:26] a Nazarite you you can anybody can do a
[1:31:29] Nazarite Val it's no set time it's
[1:31:31] however time you decide to take a vow
[1:31:34] before the Lord men can do it women can
[1:31:36] do it but don't break it
[1:31:38] if you make a vow to God you're better
[1:31:40] to not make it than make it and break it
[1:31:43] and so you know when when you talk about
[1:31:46] the Nazarite because the reason I'm
[1:31:48] bringing this up is because brother
[1:31:49] Branham said you know that's what we are
[1:31:51] in a sense we are nazarites
[1:31:54] to the word of God
[1:31:56] our failure is notwithstanding
[1:32:00] come on our failure is notwithstanding I
[1:32:03] am a Nazarite see
[1:32:05] and and that's why that every aspect of
[1:32:08] our life has to say Amen to every word
[1:32:11] I'm going to read you this little short
[1:32:13] thing that Spurgeon said about the
[1:32:16] Nazarite and I want you now to think
[1:32:18] about what I'm preaching that I'm making
[1:32:21] the statement to you that you can't just
[1:32:23] take 99 of the word for your life and
[1:32:26] lose confidence in the other one percent
[1:32:29] for your life your life needs to toe the
[1:32:32] mark with everything that came to us in
[1:32:34] this day
[1:32:35] here's what Spurgeon said concerning a
[1:32:38] Nazarite now listen close
[1:32:41] nazarites had taken among other vows
[1:32:45] one which debarred them from the use of
[1:32:49] wine all right now that's their vow you
[1:32:51] got me I'm a Nazarite I'm not going to
[1:32:53] touch wine all right good now the Lord
[1:32:57] here's what the Lord said okay I'll
[1:33:00] accept your vow how long you going to do
[1:33:01] it 30 days okay noted let the angel
[1:33:05] record it all right now I've got to say
[1:33:07] something to you if you're going to make
[1:33:10] this vow to me you can't just avoid wine
[1:33:13] that won't you'll fail
[1:33:16] Lord what about what else do I need to
[1:33:18] know all right
[1:33:20] if you take a vowel then this particular
[1:33:24] vowel it's going to debar Spurgeon says
[1:33:27] it's going to debar them from the use of
[1:33:29] wine and in order that they might not
[1:33:32] violate the obligation
[1:33:35] they were forbidden to drink the vinegar
[1:33:37] of wine or strong Liquors and to make
[1:33:41] the rules still more clear
[1:33:44] they were not to touch
[1:33:47] the unfermented juice of grapes
[1:33:50] nor even eat the fruit either fresh or
[1:33:54] dried
[1:33:59] see
[1:34:00] so we're talking about things that you
[1:34:03] know contaminate our lives and break our
[1:34:06] our allegiance to God as nazarites and
[1:34:10] we sometimes we so lament our failures
[1:34:13] but I'm gonna say I'm gonna Spurgeon is
[1:34:16] going to help me suggest to you that you
[1:34:19] might be failing in your vow as a
[1:34:21] Nazarite to God because you're you're
[1:34:24] not shunning the very appearance you're
[1:34:26] not leaving off the things that lead you
[1:34:28] to that you're I'm not going to do that
[1:34:31] but I'm going to dance around with all
[1:34:33] this carnality are that Carnell is going
[1:34:35] to suck you right in and you're going to
[1:34:36] break it see
[1:34:38] so in order for them not to break it God
[1:34:41] says now look
[1:34:43] in order for you to make sure you don't
[1:34:45] break it you're going to have to go
[1:34:46] above and beyond and you're gonna have
[1:34:48] to have some things in place like what
[1:34:50] don't even touch it
[1:34:52] don't even don't even you know drink the
[1:34:55] vinegar of it in fact is if somebody
[1:34:57] lays grapes in front of you dried or
[1:35:00] fresh don't don't touch them don't eat
[1:35:02] them
[1:35:03] well I only made a vow not to drink wine
[1:35:05] I know but if you do that that'll lead
[1:35:07] you there
[1:35:09] watch
[1:35:11] they were not to eat the fruit either
[1:35:14] fresh or dried
[1:35:15] in order Spurgeon says in order all
[1:35:19] together to secure the Integrity of the
[1:35:22] vowel now look at these levels
[1:35:25] so so the first one is is that in order
[1:35:28] that they might not violate the
[1:35:30] obligation and then it goes another
[1:35:32] level to make the rules still more clear
[1:35:34] see and then now it's going to go to all
[1:35:37] together to secure the Integrity of the
[1:35:39] vowel they were not even allowed
[1:35:43] anything that had to do with the vine at
[1:35:48] all in fact they were in fact to avoid
[1:35:52] the appearance
[1:35:54] of evil
[1:35:56] don't even go near the vine stay out of
[1:36:00] them or church don't go to the vineyard
[1:36:05] in order all together to secure the
[1:36:08] Integrity of The Vow
[1:36:10] they were to avoid even the appearance
[1:36:12] of evil surely
[1:36:15] Spurgeon says
[1:36:18] surely this is a lesson to the Lord's
[1:36:21] separated ones are you that is that you
[1:36:25] teaching them to come away from sin in
[1:36:30] every form to avoid not merely its
[1:36:35] grosser shapes but even its spirit and
[1:36:39] similitude
[1:36:41] strict walking
[1:36:43] this blew my mind the SE is written in
[1:36:46] the 1800s you got a seat belt on you
[1:36:48] ready
[1:36:49] get some smelling salts out you might
[1:36:51] need them
[1:36:52] this is written in the 1800s
[1:36:55] strict walking is much despised in these
[1:36:59] days
[1:37:02] oh what to God I could have those
[1:37:04] despised days
[1:37:06] but rest assured dear reader
[1:37:10] it is both the safest and the happiest
[1:37:15] he listen now listen to his final shot
[1:37:19] he who yields a point or two to the
[1:37:23] world is in fearful peril
[1:37:27] he who eats The Grapes of Sodom will
[1:37:31] soon drink the wine of Gomorrah
[1:37:37] this ain't no joke
[1:37:39] this is serious
[1:37:41] and you're living in a serious hour
[1:37:44] and God is a serious man and he has sent
[1:37:47] us a serious word he's very serious
[1:37:49] about his word
[1:37:50] that's why it's not up to our
[1:37:52] interpretation of it God sent us a
[1:37:54] messenger who gave us the interpretation
[1:37:57] of it and it's ours to Simply say Amen
[1:38:00] to every word and if you and if you you
[1:38:03] say but I just can't quite say Amen
[1:38:06] because that would be a vowel and I just
[1:38:08] know I'll break it then
[1:38:10] then at least if you can't say old man
[1:38:12] as the old as they used to say if you
[1:38:13] can't say old man to say oh me or oh my
[1:38:16] or God help me or something
[1:38:19] just whatever you do don't leave here
[1:38:21] like you came
[1:38:22] have some kind of determination to say
[1:38:25] Lord I'm going to press towards the mark
[1:38:28] a little harder I'm going to reach and
[1:38:30] aim a little higher
[1:38:35] you see the the question I'm gonna I
[1:38:38] mean I'm gonna stop with this
[1:38:41] the question from the Pharisees
[1:38:44] as I said to you it concerns the arrival
[1:38:47] of the coming kingdom of God and in fact
[1:38:50] is you know that that once he turns to
[1:38:54] his disciples
[1:38:56] and he just leaves those denominations
[1:38:58] you know blinking and trying to figure
[1:39:02] out what he meant by that the kingdom of
[1:39:03] your God is within you it's not like
[1:39:05] it's not coming with observation like
[1:39:06] you think
[1:39:07] that's coming
[1:39:09] there will be a real king and a real
[1:39:12] Kingdom in a real world but before he
[1:39:15] can restore that he's got to restore
[1:39:16] this
[1:39:18] see
[1:39:19] so the kingdom is being restored only in
[1:39:22] the upper room say what happened the
[1:39:25] kingdom was being restored what's
[1:39:27] happening today with this message the
[1:39:29] kingdom is being restored why do I need
[1:39:31] the token the kingdom is being restored
[1:39:36] and so you realize that that that that
[1:39:39] that that that this Kingdom that he's
[1:39:41] been Gathering as he across two thousand
[1:39:43] years as he said as the lightning starts
[1:39:46] under the eastern part of the heavens
[1:39:48] and shineth all the way to the western
[1:39:50] part of the heavens and you can see that
[1:39:51] historically and geographically the word
[1:39:54] of the original Apostles has migrated to
[1:39:56] our day to our lands and that's why you
[1:39:59] find America in Revelation chapter 13.
[1:40:03] and when you find her there she's under
[1:40:05] the control of a beast power don't don't
[1:40:08] think that's not happening see and so
[1:40:11] you have you have a number of things
[1:40:13] that are blending in and incorporating
[1:40:16] the first age and the last age in some
[1:40:18] ways they're they're quite a bit of like
[1:40:20] they're quite uh alike and in other ways
[1:40:23] you have to separate it out you know
[1:40:25] that the you know for instance the the
[1:40:28] characteristic of it being the days of
[1:40:30] Noah and the days of lot are
[1:40:34] specifically for the last day
[1:40:36] whereas when he said if you're on the
[1:40:39] rooftop you see the armies don't go down
[1:40:42] and grab anything if you're in the field
[1:40:44] you see the armies just go take off
[1:40:46] running
[1:40:47] run as fast as you can don't don't grab
[1:40:50] anything just go
[1:40:51] teach your children teach your family
[1:40:53] that way if you're in the house and
[1:40:55] they're in the field or vice versa or
[1:40:56] they're in town and you're not with them
[1:40:58] teach your family how to escape the
[1:41:01] judgment
[1:41:03] I'm here to tell you something friends
[1:41:05] we see the Winds of judgment moving on
[1:41:08] the earth the seventh vial has already
[1:41:09] been partially broken open and where
[1:41:12] it's already infecting the minds of
[1:41:14] mankind with Madness flee run teach your
[1:41:18] children run from this
[1:41:22] so where do I tell them to run to run to
[1:41:24] the word it's the it's the covert from
[1:41:27] Storm it's a safety
[1:41:32] see now in contrast to that you you have
[1:41:35] the both ages and all ages uh are judged
[1:41:38] because of their rejection of the word
[1:41:40] both at the beginning and the ending and
[1:41:43] so when we see the separating and we we
[1:41:46] came down to the separating that started
[1:41:48] in verse 34 and and 37.
[1:41:52] um I I don't think I want to well let me
[1:41:55] just sketch it here I tell you and that
[1:41:57] night there shall be two remember you
[1:41:58] got two in the bed two in the field two
[1:42:00] in grinding and and and you've got to
[1:42:02] want to be taking the other left and
[1:42:05] then they answer where Lord and he says
[1:42:07] wheresoever the carcasses so once you
[1:42:10] start with this kind of a separating
[1:42:12] found in Verses 34 to 37 we realize that
[1:42:16] the separating is to the word where the
[1:42:20] Eagles gather before the Rapture that's
[1:42:23] the separating
[1:42:25] two men here two women here two men here
[1:42:28] I'm gonna take one leave one take one
[1:42:30] leave one he's separating now as I said
[1:42:33] the Rapture is the ultimate separating
[1:42:34] we literally leave and meet the Lord in
[1:42:37] the air aren't we looking forward to
[1:42:38] that
[1:42:40] but before you get there you've got to
[1:42:42] be separated here and and that's why he
[1:42:46] doesn't say when they say where
[1:42:48] and he gives them the answer where the
[1:42:51] word is how do I get how do I make sure
[1:42:53] I'm the one that gets taken and not left
[1:42:55] go to the word gather around the word
[1:42:58] and if you eat on the word you'll be
[1:43:01] taken you won't be left
[1:43:03] oh hallelujah thank God for what he said
[1:43:06] in this hour
[1:43:08] my
[1:43:10] it's such a Perfection of I never caught
[1:43:13] this till today when I was studying
[1:43:14] early this morning we can talk about
[1:43:17] Revelation 13 we've read it many times
[1:43:19] but Ezekiel so so brings out uh brother
[1:43:23] brother Gideon give me Ezekiel 16. I
[1:43:25] just want to read two three verses there
[1:43:27] I promise I'm going to quit here just in
[1:43:30] a minute I'm just trying to get to this
[1:43:31] last thing
[1:43:32] Ezekiel 16 48 now this is a perfect
[1:43:35] description of the United States as you
[1:43:38] see it described in Revelation 13 also
[1:43:41] but he says here he's saying this to
[1:43:44] Israel
[1:43:45] as I live saith the Lord God Ezekiel 16
[1:43:48] 48. just just pay attention as I read
[1:43:51] till they get it as I live saith the
[1:43:54] Lord God
[1:43:55] Sodom thy sister hath not done he She
[1:44:00] nor her daughters as thou has done
[1:44:04] thou and thy daughters
[1:44:06] see that was our text we read about as
[1:44:09] it was in the days of Noah as it was in
[1:44:11] the days of Sodom
[1:44:14] all right so that's why we're reading
[1:44:16] this
[1:44:17] verse 48 again as I live saith the Lord
[1:44:20] God Sodom my sister hath not done nor
[1:44:24] She nor her daughters as thou has done
[1:44:27] thou and thy daughters verse 49
[1:44:30] behold this was the iniquity of thy
[1:44:35] sister Sodom here was her iniquity Pride
[1:44:39] fullness of bread remember I'm rich and
[1:44:42] increased with Goods I have need of
[1:44:43] nothing is there any people so infected
[1:44:46] with poisonous Pride than the United
[1:44:48] States see
[1:44:50] I have need of nothing I'm rich and
[1:44:52] increased with Goods well if you have
[1:44:54] need of nothing you don't need God for
[1:44:55] sure see
[1:44:57] so behold this was the iniquity of thy
[1:45:00] sister Sodom Pride fullness of bread and
[1:45:04] abundance of idleness
[1:45:07] was in her
[1:45:09] and in her daughters neither did she
[1:45:12] strengthen the hand of the poor and the
[1:45:14] needy and they were haughty and
[1:45:18] committed Abomination before me
[1:45:20] therefore I took them away as I saw good
[1:45:24] now brother Branham
[1:45:26] makes a notation and I didn't put it on
[1:45:29] a PowerPoint I'm going to read it for
[1:45:30] you
[1:45:31] brother Branham makes a notation
[1:45:34] um in the message hearing recognizing
[1:45:36] acting on the word of God from February
[1:45:38] 1960 February 21.
[1:45:41] he starts talking about how he's reading
[1:45:44] in Matthew Matthew 24 because Matthew 24
[1:45:46] is the parallel to Luke 17 30 all right
[1:45:50] Matthew 24 has quite a bit more details
[1:45:52] all right that's uh that's where he says
[1:45:55] it'll be so closer to see the very
[1:45:56] elected if it were possible and many
[1:45:58] false christs will arise and deceive
[1:46:00] many that's Matthew 24 right
[1:46:03] so but but the reason we're stuck with
[1:46:05] Luke 17 is because that's the ministry
[1:46:07] of the son of man
[1:46:08] and in fact is brother Branham notes in
[1:46:11] in Matthew 24 that the days of lot now
[1:46:15] catch this because this is really
[1:46:16] something the days of lot are not even
[1:46:19] mentioned
[1:46:21] only the days of Noah
[1:46:24] and in fact is in all the gospels only
[1:46:28] Luke Mark Miss doesn't mention lot John
[1:46:31] doesn't mention lot Matthew who seems to
[1:46:34] record everything doesn't mention a lot
[1:46:37] ha
[1:46:37] only Luke
[1:46:40] because now we're talking about the
[1:46:42] transference of the ministry of of the
[1:46:44] son of man and brother Branham says the
[1:46:47] reason that he doesn't mention I'm going
[1:46:49] to read you the quote is because it's
[1:46:51] going to be left to Revelation see it's
[1:46:54] it's a it's literally prophetic in fact
[1:46:57] as I said a lot in his family are not
[1:46:59] mentioned at all in the gospels of Mark
[1:47:01] and John and you have this one mention
[1:47:03] here in Luke 17 alone where you where
[1:47:06] you get just this little short list of
[1:47:09] characteristics in fact as half of which
[1:47:11] are is just a repeating of what he said
[1:47:13] about Noah
[1:47:15] and so so brother Branham so so what
[1:47:18] happens is is that you have brother
[1:47:20] Branham indicates that it's because that
[1:47:23] the full disclosure
[1:47:25] of Sodom
[1:47:27] is left for Revelation coming at the end
[1:47:30] time
[1:47:31] see
[1:47:32] and so so Jesus doesn't really talk a
[1:47:35] lot about it none of the other guys even
[1:47:37] write about it since it is connected
[1:47:39] since it's connected
[1:47:42] to the lightning that starts in the East
[1:47:45] and finishes in the west then it's
[1:47:47] connected to the second coming
[1:47:50] is that easy you're with me you're with
[1:47:53] me all right I can't lose you in the
[1:47:56] shuffle this is too important all right
[1:47:57] now
[1:47:58] so brother Branham is indicating that
[1:48:00] it's it's because it's going to be left
[1:48:03] to Revelation the understanding would be
[1:48:05] given at the end time to the end time
[1:48:07] Messenger to to you know to to the time
[1:48:11] of the messenger of the end time so that
[1:48:14] the bride living in the end time
[1:48:18] could know what to watch out for
[1:48:22] you need to know what to watch out for
[1:48:25] now here he says it's just one paragraph
[1:48:28] listen close hearing recognizing acting
[1:48:31] on the word of God did you notice Jesus
[1:48:33] in his speaking of the coming Second
[1:48:37] Coming he said as it was in the days of
[1:48:40] Noah they'll be eating drinking marrying
[1:48:42] and giving in marriage but when he spoke
[1:48:44] of the days of lot he never said nothing
[1:48:46] about it and that's true in Matthew and
[1:48:49] Mark and John he didn't see he never
[1:48:52] said anything about never spoke of the
[1:48:54] days of lot he never said nothing about
[1:48:56] it as the days of lot that's for
[1:48:59] revelation
[1:49:01] see now that's that's not different than
[1:49:04] when Paul
[1:49:05] goes back and speaks of Melchizedek
[1:49:08] and Paul starts to describe
[1:49:11] characteristics about Melchizedek that
[1:49:13] aren't anywhere in Genesis
[1:49:15] and nowhere in the Bible
[1:49:17] Paul had no no authoritative verse he
[1:49:20] could stand on when he said things like
[1:49:22] this Melchizedek having no beginning of
[1:49:25] days and no ending of life this
[1:49:28] Melchizedek who had no father who had no
[1:49:30] mother
[1:49:32] who abideth forever a priest continually
[1:49:34] Paul had no Authority except his
[1:49:37] prophetic office to make that statement
[1:49:39] see so now
[1:49:41] when Jesus speaks in three gospels it's
[1:49:45] not even mentioned and brother Branham
[1:49:46] reading from Matthew 24 says notice he
[1:49:48] doesn't mention it and then when we come
[1:49:50] to Luke Luke gives a few descriptions
[1:49:53] and it's really only tied to half of
[1:49:56] what was happening in the days of of
[1:49:58] Noah so it's going to take a prophet
[1:50:02] under Revelation when the when the
[1:50:05] lightning is in the West
[1:50:07] to show us what to look out for
[1:50:12] so reject him at your own peril
[1:50:17] if you don't take what's right you'll
[1:50:19] never be able to tell what's wrong
[1:50:21] see
[1:50:23] and so the first thing brother Branham
[1:50:25] describes when he comes to lot first he
[1:50:27] describes him as a leader brother
[1:50:29] Branham says perhaps a mayor of Sodom
[1:50:31] now that's that part's not novel The
[1:50:34] Bible gives some indication that lot was
[1:50:36] a leader in Sodom in Genesis 19 1. you
[1:50:39] can read about it how that it says lot
[1:50:41] was sitting in the Gateway of the city
[1:50:43] and
[1:50:44] when he saw the two angels who who came
[1:50:46] to warn him you know of that impending
[1:50:48] destruction and in Bible days the
[1:50:49] Gateway we've taught on this before the
[1:50:52] Gateway of the city is a place where
[1:50:54] important people such as Elders I'm
[1:50:56] reading this right from um uh right from
[1:50:59] lexical AIDS such as Elders judges
[1:51:01] rulers would sit and conduct business
[1:51:03] administered Justice and welcome guests
[1:51:06] see so that's not novel when brother
[1:51:08] Branham said
[1:51:10] when brother just like Jesus in The Book
[1:51:12] of Luke does give a few he says well
[1:51:14] they were buying and they were selling
[1:51:15] so that's a little different they're not
[1:51:17] just you know doing this and eating and
[1:51:20] drinking they're also they are marrying
[1:51:22] and giving in marriage but they're also
[1:51:24] buying and selling see but now brother
[1:51:26] Branham is going to come down with the
[1:51:28] last day Revelation and he's going to
[1:51:29] show how that he's going to break down
[1:51:31] the family and he starts out with saying
[1:51:33] you know lot was like a leader he's like
[1:51:35] the mayor perhaps of Sodom which as
[1:51:37] we've shown you that's not the novel
[1:51:39] part but then he goes on by now by
[1:51:44] direct Revelation we're going to start
[1:51:45] to get an inside look at how it
[1:51:49] devastated how that lot making that
[1:51:52] decision to live
[1:51:53] and down in the fertile Plains and left
[1:51:57] Abraham
[1:51:59] the who was a representative who's the
[1:52:01] one who received Melchizedek
[1:52:04] and he looked at the fertile planes of
[1:52:06] the valley and he said I'm going to go
[1:52:07] down and live down near there and he
[1:52:08] ended up getting elected his mayor and
[1:52:10] sat in the gate as a judge
[1:52:12] see how see how the devil just pulled
[1:52:14] him in
[1:52:15] and got him got him all twisted and
[1:52:16] don't you think he's not trying to do
[1:52:18] that to you
[1:52:19] don't you think he's not trying to do
[1:52:21] that to you
[1:52:22] you you you college kids who are in
[1:52:25] University God bless you don't lose
[1:52:27] sight of that they're going to try to
[1:52:30] twist you and pull you into that
[1:52:32] we we have college graduates here who
[1:52:35] can testify to that and and then and you
[1:52:38] we're we've got to be in business we've
[1:52:40] got to have schools we've got to raise
[1:52:41] families we've got to pay bills we we do
[1:52:43] live here we're not going to a commune
[1:52:46] I'm not going to build a wall around
[1:52:47] this place and we're all going to live
[1:52:49] here as a commune that's not the idea of
[1:52:51] the Gospel the gospel is I have sent you
[1:52:54] a sheep Out Among Wolves the gospel is
[1:52:57] you can't go out of the world just make
[1:52:58] sure you understand you're not from here
[1:53:00] you're not staying here
[1:53:05] see and that's what you should be
[1:53:08] teaching your children
[1:53:09] see
[1:53:11] so brother Branham now is going to take
[1:53:13] a real inside look at how it devastated
[1:53:15] his life and and the life of his family
[1:53:18] he breaks down the Family Affair how he
[1:53:21] says here that that Mrs lot now here's
[1:53:24] here's a prophet under Revelation he
[1:53:27] talks about how Mrs lot was a leader in
[1:53:30] society
[1:53:31] she was a a leader of the the president
[1:53:34] of all these Social Clubs and women's
[1:53:37] society and this society and that
[1:53:39] society and her husband is a judge and a
[1:53:41] mayor and he sits in the city gate and
[1:53:43] and brother Branham goes on to describe
[1:53:45] how that down through the family that
[1:53:48] that even her daughters it affected the
[1:53:51] daughters and how they ended up marrying
[1:53:52] into celebrity and the corruption that
[1:53:55] that the corruption that comes with that
[1:53:58] kind of worldly entertainment
[1:54:00] see he picks it up here watch what
[1:54:02] happened in the days of lot there was a
[1:54:05] lot down there in Sodom well settled
[1:54:08] down intellectually become the one of
[1:54:10] the big men of the city the judge said
[1:54:12] in the gates and judged the people his
[1:54:15] wife belonged to all the societies this
[1:54:17] is like Paul talking about Melchizedek
[1:54:20] here's here's Elijah at the end time
[1:54:22] talking about The Insider now he's
[1:54:24] giving you an inside view to the family
[1:54:25] his wife belonged to all the societies
[1:54:28] there was of the city
[1:54:30] that's a lot
[1:54:32] she she belonged to all the societies of
[1:54:35] the city and his daughters and all of
[1:54:38] them married among the celebrity
[1:54:41] intellectual Highly Educated smart witty
[1:54:45] you see you see how lot's decision
[1:54:49] permeated his family
[1:54:52] you see how that was just a trickle-down
[1:54:54] economy to ungodliness
[1:54:57] you see why we need praying families
[1:54:59] with praying parents we need a spiritual
[1:55:02] church and if you're going to have a
[1:55:04] spiritual church you got to have
[1:55:05] spiritual families and if you're going
[1:55:07] to have spiritual families you've got to
[1:55:08] have spiritual daddies
[1:55:11] God's spiritual husbands
[1:55:13] you got to have wives who know their
[1:55:16] place and stay in their Lane and pray
[1:55:18] for their husbands Pastor the children
[1:55:20] you got to have a Ministry who'll tell
[1:55:22] you the barefested truth you got to have
[1:55:25] the power of God that knows he can come
[1:55:27] down and move freely and I want him to
[1:55:29] know he can move freely
[1:55:32] he can go up and down these aisles he
[1:55:34] can come all over the platform he can
[1:55:37] take me he can take you how many would
[1:55:39] like to have that in your life today
[1:55:45] we can sin
[1:55:47] lot was I mean think of where this Got
[1:55:51] to Now now think about American fathers
[1:55:55] but the spirit of America
[1:55:58] and mothers who
[1:56:00] dress their little innocent children up
[1:56:02] as hookers and put them in beauty
[1:56:04] pageants
[1:56:06] put them on singing contests and and
[1:56:09] stand in the wings and cry because their
[1:56:11] little baby is being applauded and the
[1:56:14] little babies being molested
[1:56:17] by the devil
[1:56:20] and ruining that child
[1:56:23] notice that lot was not even hesitant to
[1:56:27] give up his daughters
[1:56:30] and he said to those evil men don't
[1:56:32] touch these angels but here have my
[1:56:34] daughters
[1:56:35] you see now this goes to show you
[1:56:37] because this this this should inform
[1:56:40] your thinking where the daughters were
[1:56:41] living
[1:56:42] don't forget
[1:56:44] come on let's be adults here these are
[1:56:46] the same two girls who would later get
[1:56:48] him drunk
[1:56:49] and have incestual affair with him to
[1:56:51] Bear children
[1:56:53] these aren't good girls
[1:56:55] these are girls who their daddy didn't
[1:56:57] care enough to keep the world out of the
[1:56:58] house
[1:57:00] and lot doesn't even have a hesitation
[1:57:02] to offer them
[1:57:04] see apparently I mean to me I'm thinking
[1:57:08] Lots lot's basically saying he probably
[1:57:10] had him before
[1:57:12] because my daughters basically are just
[1:57:14] little Street walkers
[1:57:17] you see and here he is now to save his
[1:57:20] own hide ready to do what he's been
[1:57:22] doing give up his daughters to Sodom
[1:57:26] is that tough
[1:57:27] is that hard
[1:57:29] you still love me
[1:57:32] this is the truth of God's word friend
[1:57:35] this is a serious hour and we can't play
[1:57:37] around with this we've got to have the
[1:57:39] power of God in total freedom it needs
[1:57:42] to move in my home in your home needs to
[1:57:44] move in this church it needs to move on
[1:57:45] our children we need to see the Holy
[1:57:47] Ghost I want to see all of our young
[1:57:49] people full of the Holy Ghost and on
[1:57:51] fire
[1:57:52] Hallelujah we want nothing to do with
[1:57:54] the world if you drink the if you drink
[1:57:56] the the the the grape of Sodom you'll
[1:58:00] drink the wine of Gomorrah see
[1:58:03] and so yeah and as far as his wife my
[1:58:06] goodness she never made it out entirely
[1:58:07] her heart was so completely engrossed in
[1:58:10] Sodom that she looked back longingly and
[1:58:12] God destroyed her
[1:58:14] and all of this we see
[1:58:16] lot you know as a as a type of the
[1:58:19] foolish virgin that had a righteous soul
[1:58:21] that sin vexed him brother Branham said
[1:58:23] it like this
[1:58:25] and I hope to God
[1:58:27] no husband or dad or man
[1:58:32] has this happening in his life the Bible
[1:58:35] says the sins of Sodom vexed his
[1:58:38] righteous Soul daily
[1:58:40] when brother Branham ran that through
[1:58:41] his Kentucky grammar he said it it it
[1:58:45] grieved him but he just didn't have the
[1:58:48] plain nerve enough to stand against
[1:58:53] that's putting it on the brass tacks
[1:58:56] say God give me courage
[1:58:58] give me give these men courage give
[1:59:01] these parents give these young people
[1:59:02] courage if Mom and Dad won't be
[1:59:05] spiritual young person you be spiritual
[1:59:07] if the fire's going out into home start
[1:59:10] one yourself
[1:59:11] Hallelujah I've seen young people get on
[1:59:13] fire and catch mom and dad on fire
[1:59:16] Hallelujah the power God can use anybody
[1:59:20] all he needs is one person under his
[1:59:23] complete control
[1:59:26] this is what would happen
[1:59:30] and we see that so perfectly
[1:59:33] that nominal Church
[1:59:35] that foolish virgin
[1:59:37] and we see Abraham
[1:59:40] up there
[1:59:41] on a mountain
[1:59:43] separate living separate
[1:59:47] from lit from laodicea from Sodom from
[1:59:51] Gomorrah oh friends is this the kind of
[1:59:54] life we want to have like Abraham had
[1:59:57] why don't you stand up with me and let's
[2:00:00] see if the Lord will will like to hear
[2:00:02] you say would like to see you raise your
