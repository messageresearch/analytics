[44:24] we're just uh glad that the Lord had
[44:27] something in his mind and wanted to go a
[44:29] little bit further with this so I trust
[44:31] that you came hungry Amen in an
[44:33] expectation how many just appreciated
[44:35] the word and the spirit that we heard
[44:37] Wednesday not just what was said but the
[44:40] spirit of God that moved in this church
[44:43] I believe that Spirit brother random
[44:45] said that lingers
[44:47] so that same spirit's still here today
[44:49] all you got to do is tap into it amen
[44:52] get get out of this Earthly amen and I'm
[44:55] gonna go right with you
[44:56] amen and go into that other dimension
[44:58] amen Joshua chapter four we're just
[45:01] going to remember all those that are
[45:03] sick also and now we've prayed we're
[45:04] going to ask again here for special
[45:05] prayer all those that are out of church
[45:08] this morning at home streaming because
[45:10] of a flu bug going around a different
[45:12] one sick and
[45:13] um brother Keith Brown I don't know if
[45:15] this got announced or not was supposed
[45:17] to be speaking today and Mr charity uh
[45:19] came down with flu symptoms so they went
[45:21] home and then Mom and Dad got it uh
[45:24] still filling some flu symptoms this
[45:26] morning so they're at home streaming and
[45:28] I'm sure there's many others so we just
[45:30] but we we believe in healing amen we
[45:33] believe in an atonement that didn't just
[45:35] save us but also heals us and heals our
[45:37] body and so we want to ask the Lord to
[45:40] remember those that are out this morning
[45:43] and so we're going to pray for those
[45:45] needs here in just a moment I would like
[45:47] to discontinue on from where we were
[45:49] Wednesday on anointed by the
[45:51] supernatural and it came to pass when
[45:54] all of the people were clean past over
[45:56] Jordan that the Lord spoke unto Joshua
[45:59] saying take you 12 men out of the people
[46:02] out of every tribe of man and command
[46:05] you them saying take you hints out of
[46:09] the midst of Jordan out of the place
[46:11] where the priest feet stood firm
[46:16] so this was specific to the Lord out of
[46:20] a certain spot you're going to take
[46:21] these Stones go into the river don't
[46:23] just grab any don't just pick up any
[46:25] stone because there was going to be a
[46:28] significance that was going to take
[46:30] place years after this event of the
[46:33] crossing of Jordan you're going to see
[46:35] that here in just a moment but he says
[46:37] here go out of let's read it again
[46:38] commanding them saying take you hints
[46:40] out of the midst of Jordan
[46:41] out of the place where the priest's feet
[46:45] stood firm 12 Stones and you shall carry
[46:49] them over with you and leave them in the
[46:51] lodging place where you shall Lodge this
[46:54] night then Joshua called the 12 men whom
[46:57] he had prepared of the children of
[46:59] Israel out of every tribe of man and
[47:02] Joshua said unto them pass over before
[47:05] the Ark of the Lord your God into the
[47:08] midst of Jordan and take you up every
[47:11] man of you a stone upon his shoulder
[47:14] according unto the number of the tribes
[47:17] of the children of Israel that this may
[47:19] be a sign among you that when your
[47:22] children ask their fathers in time to
[47:25] come saying what menu by these stones or
[47:29] Daddy what do these Stones mean what's
[47:32] this all about
[47:34] what's all these things we talk about
[47:36] what's all this about and he says when
[47:38] your children ask what menu by these
[47:41] Stones then you shall answer them that
[47:45] the Waters of Jordan were cut off before
[47:48] the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when
[47:50] it passed over Jordan the Waters of
[47:53] Jordan that's as important we spoke
[47:55] Wednesday on this same river that Elijah
[47:58] and Elisha cross it's the same river
[48:00] that Joshua crosses and he says let's
[48:04] read it again he says and you shall
[48:05] answer them
[48:07] verse 7
[48:09] the Waters of Jordan were cut off before
[48:11] the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when
[48:13] it passed over Jordan the Waters of
[48:15] Jordan were cut off and these Stones
[48:18] shall be
[48:19] for a memorial unto the children of
[48:22] Israel
[48:24] forever
[48:25] Lord Jesus we just bow our heads now in
[48:28] your presence Lord

[49:50] morning as we discontinue Lord in the
[49:53] Sunday morning worship service to
[49:54] Worship You Lord now God may you take
[49:57] your word Lord and may you speak we ask
[49:59] in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be
[50:02] seated this morning
[50:08] we picked up left off in what house will
[50:12] you build me and I want you to go and
[50:13] display that PowerPoint if you could and
[50:15] I'm just going to read this to cap some
[50:17] of these things that we spoke on
[50:19] Wednesday and brother Brandon begins to
[50:22] give Express his desire for the Tucson
[50:25] Tabernacle in Tucson Arizona and it's
[50:29] 1965 what house will you build me he's
[50:32] coming as we said on Wednesday to some
[50:35] of the last things he would speak some
[50:37] of his last thoughts as we spoke on
[50:40] Wednesday on the transfer of that burden
[50:44] or the transfer of that inheritance just
[50:47] as Elisha asks for a double portion of
[50:50] Elijah's spirit because he needed that
[50:53] mantle and he understood that when he
[50:55] was in Jordan and he wouldn't stay and
[50:57] Elijah says Terry here and I said Lord
[51:00] is my soul liveth I'll not leave thee
[51:02] but I'll go with you I'll stick with you
[51:04] I'll stay beside you and so Elisha was
[51:07] not going to stop in Bethel until he had
[51:10] the mantle that Elijah was wearing and
[51:13] that mantle was representative of a
[51:16] promise or a purpose that the Lord had
[51:19] had it was representative of a burden
[51:21] that God had placed upon this man Elijah
[51:24] and with that burden there was promises
[51:27] that was given unto Elijah and Elisha
[51:30] knew that in order to to pass over
[51:33] Jordan again I'm going to need that same
[51:36] power I'm going to need that same burden
[51:38] I'm going to need that same anointing
[51:40] I'm going to need that same God but not
[51:43] just the same or else he would have said
[51:45] give me what you have but Elijah
[51:48] realized he needed more than what he
[51:50] Elisha realized he needed more than what
[51:53] Elijah had somebody following me this
[51:56] morning so he says give me a double
[51:58] portion of what you had let that Spirit
[52:00] be a double Let It Be magnified in two
[52:04] times what you have and I believe it's
[52:07] so representative of the age that we
[52:10] live in today that we need a double
[52:12] portion of the anointing that was on the
[52:15] messenger has to come on to the bride
[52:17] there's got to be a transfer of that
[52:20] same expectation of that same Faith the
[52:24] prophet would say it this way there's
[52:25] got to come a rapturing faith upon the
[52:30] people and before we can ever have a
[52:32] Rapture in faith there's got to be an
[52:34] expectation there's got to be a burden
[52:36] there's got to be something that that
[52:38] burns inside of them an expectation and
[52:42] it so he begins to list some of his last
[52:44] things that he's going to say in this
[52:46] church here he speaks
[52:48] um and I don't remember the title I was
[52:50] just hearing it just the other day and
[52:53] the prophet of God is saying this to a
[52:55] church in Arizona and he starts saying
[52:58] you Brothers here he said I he said I
[53:00] didn't want to I didn't want to have a
[53:01] church here I don't want to cause a
[53:03] controversy amongst you Assemblies of
[53:05] God and some of you that are in the
[53:07] Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness and some of
[53:09] you in the Baptist Church and even
[53:11] points to some of the brothers who were
[53:13] there in that meeting that were uh in a
[53:15] Catholic church and brother Bynum says
[53:16] him he says but I sat here for three
[53:19] years and you never invited me to preach
[53:21] in your pulpits you never had me speak I
[53:23] was here in the desert for three years
[53:25] and now brother green has opened up a
[53:27] church you know brother green it was so
[53:29] incredible do you know why brother green
[53:32] said he brother Perry green opened a
[53:34] church in Tucson Arizona why he started
[53:37] a church and left Beaumont Texas he was
[53:40] the superintendent of a denomination
[53:42] there and he leaves Beaumont Texas thank
[53:45] you brother Tony he leaves Beaumont
[53:47] Texas and he and he and he leaves
[53:49] everything my Grandpa and Grandma were
[53:51] there with brother Green in Beaumont
[53:53] before he went to Arizona and had my
[53:55] grandpa went with brother green I'd
[53:57] probably be living in Arizona right now
[53:59] but he didn't the Lord had other plans
[54:01] and brother green goes to Arizona and he
[54:04] starts a church and I thought it was so
[54:05] incredible that brother green says the
[54:08] reason I I started the Tucson Tabernacle
[54:11] at church is that I wanted a place of
[54:13] worship that I can come into and say the
[54:17] name William Branham
[54:19] and it not offend anybody
[54:23] that was his reason he started a church
[54:26] was that so he could preach the message
[54:28] and not have to explain it or be offend
[54:32] anybody by it
[54:33] and you hear Brother Brian I'm saying
[54:35] I'm so glad I've got churches that have
[54:37] opened the door uh to my Ministry and
[54:39] have caught the inspiration listen to
[54:42] some of these things he says here it's
[54:43] uh just I thought was so profound to
[54:46] that church here this this one doesn't
[54:47] work guys I don't know what happened to
[54:49] the good one if you got another one of
[54:50] these Logitech ones back there please
[54:52] bring it if not just go ahead and
[54:54] Advance the slide press the next Arrow
[54:55] notice this the next one uh there he
[54:58] says but we this is what house will you
[55:00] build me but we as this group of people
[55:03] unless we read Wednesday we'll get we'll
[55:06] we'll cover that again we have a message
[55:08] for this day
[55:11] we believe that God has given us a
[55:14] message and brother green has I don't
[55:16] know what to call him my associate
[55:18] because we are well it is also my
[55:21] associate we're together in this message
[55:24] brother green preaches the same thing
[55:27] and message that I believe in he has
[55:30] left his home he has left his people he
[55:33] has left his church he was I believe he
[55:36] was a district superintendent or
[55:37] something of one of them one of the
[55:39] organizations and give the whole thing
[55:41] up when he heard this he left everything
[55:45] that was dear to him also to come to the
[55:49] desert just to support what God is
[55:51] giving to us now let me stop and
[55:55] emphasize it cannot be overemphasized
[55:57] enough that there was a generation of
[56:00] people who left everything to come to
[56:05] this
[56:06] now what about the generation of people
[56:08] I included who didn't have to leave
[56:10] anything but were raised up in the
[56:13] message you didn't have to sacrifice and
[56:15] leave a home or leave a church or leave
[56:17] a family and leave everything to come to
[56:19] this let me just say until you leave
[56:22] everything
[56:26] until you leave every thought every
[56:28] previous idea all opinions listen we're
[56:31] not a church full of opinions we've got
[56:33] the Vindicated the saith the Lord from
[56:36] God's prophet and it's not a matter of
[56:38] opinion or what I think or your
[56:40] perspective or my perspective
[56:42] but we leave everything
[56:47] say why brother Matt because we want
[56:49] that same anointing that was on Elijah
[56:51] to come to Elisha
[56:52] and you'll never receive in it
[56:54] questioning Elijah
[56:58] well amen
[57:01] he says we he's left everything he left
[57:04] everything was dear to him and also to
[57:06] come to the dead just to support what
[57:08] he's given us now go to the next slide I
[57:11] say I believe it's not only should be in
[57:13] our hearts it should be our duty to back
[57:17] him up everything that we can to attend
[57:22] the services to come here to worship to
[57:25] make this a place where God can reveal
[57:28] to us the things that he has for us to
[57:32] reveal
[57:34] I say we ought to support the church we
[57:38] ought to support the pastor we ought to
[57:40] attend the services
[57:43] hello this was his desire for his church
[57:46] in Tucson and as his word said this is
[57:48] Brother Branham quoting what brother
[57:50] green had said on the tape before
[57:51] brother Branham takes the pulpit and as
[57:54] his word said the message doesn't come
[57:56] to me this is Brother green through the
[57:58] giving of the inspiration as it did does
[58:01] maybe to some of us but he said I am
[58:04] here to back up what God has given
[58:11] let me just say brother Matt is here to
[58:13] back up what God has given how many
[58:16] would join me and say I am here to back
[58:20] up and to support what God has given
[58:24] Glory
[58:25] and he says I'm here to back up what a
[58:27] statement brother Burnham says and I
[58:29] believe if we will cooperate together
[58:31] we'll put our hearts to it next
[58:35] next I know that each of you if you feel
[58:38] like I do I am so hungry to see the
[58:41] spirit of God moving I just can't hardly
[58:45] stand it this is what was burning in
[58:48] brother random's heart he's about to
[58:49] lose in November in December he'll he'll
[58:52] be he'll be in a car accident just in
[58:54] just a few months a few weeks later and
[58:56] here's what's on his heart after the
[58:58] seals after the Mysteries are unfolded
[59:00] after the revelation of the word after
[59:02] the Mighty God unveiled and brother
[59:04] Branham saying I'm so hungry I just
[59:07] can't hardly stand it some experiences
[59:10] I've had just up in the mountain just to
[59:12] feel that once again that's something
[59:14] that when I was first Saved he goes back
[59:17] to all the all the way back to the first
[59:20] initial experience he had when he got
[59:22] saved
[59:25] and here he is at the end of his life
[59:27] and he's Longing For What the Lord did
[59:29] him did for him years before this
[59:33] and he says and we can
[59:35] Wicked place we can sit we could see it
[59:37] among us that we're drying
[59:39] as we sit here in the desert I get among
[59:41] my brother and they talk with me and I
[59:43] talk with him always in a little way of
[59:44] watching filling out there with the
[59:46] spirit as it was to see just the
[59:48] condition of that brother to see what's
[59:50] wrong keep keep going follow with me I
[59:53] begin to fill us all reclining
[59:59] I begin to feel us I'm so hungry to see
[1:00:02] the power of God I'm so hungry I could
[1:00:04] just hardly stand it
[1:00:06] but I begin to fill us all reclining
[1:00:10] getting away from the spirit
[1:00:13] it's became too natural a thing to us
[1:00:17] and he says we must Worship in the
[1:00:21] spirit
[1:00:22] where the spirit of God is Not only our
[1:00:25] message should be the flame of the hour
[1:00:27] I love this it should be the flame in
[1:00:30] our hearts
[1:00:32] it's got to be in our hearts or we can't
[1:00:33] rightly present it to the people the
[1:00:36] spirit has to pack the message itself
[1:00:39] they may never hear what you say but
[1:00:42] they'll feel the spirit that you carry
[1:00:45] and that'll make the way for what you
[1:00:47] want to say
[1:00:48] go on go on and now that brother green
[1:00:51] God has sent him in here and opened us
[1:00:53] up a church of like Precious faith that
[1:00:55] we believe in we ought to be very
[1:00:57] grateful to God and attend every service
[1:01:03] take every place that we can
[1:01:10] take every place I'd miss stopping here
[1:01:13] because I feel the Holy Spirit
[1:01:15] take every place
[1:01:17] we ought to be very grateful to God that
[1:01:20] we've got a church that we could come to
[1:01:22] we ought to be very grateful to God that
[1:01:24] there's a local body of Believers that
[1:01:26] we can worship with we ought to be
[1:01:29] because there's some people who don't
[1:01:30] have that privilege aren't in a place of
[1:01:32] life where they can go to a body
[1:01:33] Believers and Worship the Lord in
[1:01:36] Freedom and in truth we ought to be very
[1:01:39] grateful
[1:01:40] to God and attend every service
[1:01:44] take every place take every place take
[1:01:48] every place what's he saying here don't

[1:02:11] just anxious to do it
[1:02:15] keep the message honorable
[1:02:18] live the right kind of life
[1:02:22] we're living too late now this is the
[1:02:24] last words Elijah's saying to Elisha
[1:02:26] this is the last burden upon his heart
[1:02:29] this is what he wanted to instill this
[1:02:31] is the Mandate he wanted to pass on this
[1:02:34] is the commission he was commissioning
[1:02:36] Elisha with keep the message honorable
[1:02:40] how many want that here today
[1:02:43] live the right kind of Life come on I
[1:02:45] need your help preaching this morning

[1:03:08] somebody here this morning
[1:03:10] well my life your life all of our Lives
[1:03:13] need to be picked up before God
[1:03:17] our young people just ride around from
[1:03:19] place to place from show to show
[1:03:21] drifting further and further away from
[1:03:23] God right now that's the truth I see it
[1:03:27] in my children
[1:03:28] and I see myself getting to a place
[1:03:31] where not listen
[1:03:33] you you've got to assemble ourselves
[1:03:38] together
[1:03:41] to worship God
[1:03:44] the Bible said so
[1:03:46] when we see this day approaching that
[1:03:49] much more come together
[1:03:54] if there's only two people here you be
[1:03:59] one of them
[1:04:00] [Applause]
[1:04:01] if we come together and worship together
[1:04:03] then we just something another about it

[1:04:08] gathered in my name there I am
[1:04:12] in their midst
[1:04:14] go back thank you there I am this was
[1:04:17] the passion
[1:04:19] this was the desire this is what he was
[1:04:22] placing this was is what he was
[1:04:24] instilling this is what was upon his
[1:04:26] heart this is what he wanted to say this
[1:04:28] is what he wanted to pass down this is
[1:04:31] what he wanted to pass on if he had a
[1:04:34] few burdens he could leave with the
[1:04:36] church
[1:04:37] if his voice could say up something if
[1:04:40] he could pass something on to them if
[1:04:42] his voice could speak today this morning
[1:04:46] this is the this is the burden he'd want
[1:04:48] to pass on this is the the the the the
[1:04:51] the this is the uh uh uh prayer that he
[1:04:55] would pray
[1:04:57] and I think I think it's significant to
[1:04:59] understand this because lest we go
[1:05:03] beyond the message unless time goes on
[1:05:05] and then we forget the initial burden we
[1:05:09] forget the original purpose
[1:05:11] you know as brother Brandon says they
[1:05:13] always the the he says there's always
[1:05:15] been a spirit that will always try to
[1:05:18] come in and change this or change that
[1:05:21] or paint this up or dress this up over
[1:05:24] here or modernize this and reculture it
[1:05:27] over here
[1:05:29] there's always that Spirit we're always
[1:05:31] having to fight against that spirit
[1:05:33] and so he says this is the original
[1:05:35] purpose this is the original burden I
[1:05:38] want you to move on down Noah to slide
[1:05:40] uh 21. we're just gonna Skip and then
[1:05:43] we'll come back the way the lord gave me
[1:05:45] this y'all forgive me I'm on short
[1:05:46] notice this morning
[1:05:48] and it's always
[1:05:49] so get in the spirit listen to what
[1:05:52] in the message in the in the Patmos
[1:05:54] Vision he says he's quoting the
[1:05:56] scripture here I was in the spirit isn't
[1:05:58] that just beautiful my I love that you
[1:06:01] could just call those words the whole of
[1:06:05] the Christian Life
[1:06:07] I was in the spirit if we're going to
[1:06:10] live as Christians we have to be in his
[1:06:13] Spirit John was not talking about being
[1:06:16] in his own spirit that would not have
[1:06:18] brought these Visions it had to be the
[1:06:20] spirit of God it has to be the spirit of
[1:06:23] God With Us to all of our efforts or all
[1:06:26] of our efforts are in vain Paul said I
[1:06:28] will pray in the spirit I will sing in
[1:06:31] the spirit I will live in the spirit if
[1:06:34] there is anything good that will come to
[1:06:36] me it has to be revealed by the spirit
[1:06:39] confirmed by the word and made manifest
[1:06:42] by the results it bears as surely as
[1:06:45] John needed to be in the spirit to
[1:06:47] receive these tremendous Revelations
[1:06:48] fresh from Jesus we need to be in the
[1:06:52] spirit to understand the revelations
[1:06:55] that God has given to us to live by in
[1:06:58] his word for it is the same spirit
[1:07:02] so this this was some of the original
[1:07:04] things because that's what we're going
[1:07:06] to be talking about here today some of
[1:07:08] the some of the initial purpose or the
[1:07:10] original blessing or the original burden
[1:07:13] that was upon Elijah has to be passed to
[1:07:16] Elisha and here was one of the
[1:07:18] foundational principles this is what's
[1:07:21] happening in Joshua in our scripture
[1:07:23] here it was the foundational Stones when
[1:07:26] they're passing over Jordan there's
[1:07:28] going to be a miracle take place
[1:07:30] something that is uh happens in Joshua
[1:07:33] it also happens in Elisha and Elijah
[1:07:36] but here it is with Joshua and the the
[1:07:39] Jordan waters are going to part they're
[1:07:42] going to separate for them to pass over
[1:07:44] Jordan and so what's going to happen
[1:07:46] it's a fresh generation of people this
[1:07:49] is not the generation that comes out of
[1:07:51] Egypt are you hearing me this is not
[1:07:53] them that came out of Egypt they died in
[1:07:55] the wilderness as God spoke to Moses and
[1:07:57] said their carcasses will fall in the
[1:07:59] wilderness but there's an entire new
[1:08:02] generation of people who weren't raised
[1:08:04] in the message who never seen Egypt who
[1:08:07] never came out of Egypt and God tells
[1:08:09] Joshua re-circumcise the new generation
[1:08:13] circumcised the new generation in other
[1:08:15] words let them have the same experience
[1:08:18] as the first experience
[1:08:20] because if you don't have an experience
[1:08:22] of leaving something and forsaking
[1:08:24] something you'll never appreciate that
[1:08:26] something
[1:08:27] but when you leave it and you forsake
[1:08:29] something then you hold dear what the
[1:08:31] Lord has given you
[1:08:33] and so he says have the 12 priests out
[1:08:36] of every tribe of man they're going to
[1:08:38] pass over Jordan so they go through
[1:08:40] Jordan they cross the river and then God
[1:08:42] says now I want you to take he says I
[1:08:45] want you to take a stone out of every
[1:08:48] place where the priest feet stood firm
[1:08:51] 12 Stones
[1:08:55] notice this isn't just random it's not
[1:08:57] just any stone in the Jordan River but
[1:09:00] he specifies in our scripture out of the
[1:09:03] place where the priest's feet stood firm
[1:09:09] in other words wherever they were
[1:09:11] standing when they were standing and
[1:09:13] crossing the Jordan
[1:09:14] Joshua tells them I want you to take a
[1:09:17] man and he says and I want you come here
[1:09:19] brother he says I want you to take a man
[1:09:21] and he says I want you to take a stone
[1:09:23] and he says and out of the Jordan River
[1:09:26] pick up a stone right so it picks up
[1:09:29] that stone wherever the priest feet
[1:09:31] here's a priest right here come here
[1:09:32] stand here brother stand right here come
[1:09:35] here brother you stand right here we got
[1:09:36] enough Johnsons we can make all the
[1:09:38] first all 12 tribes come here come here
[1:09:41] come here Chris
[1:09:42] come here brother Steve Chris I want you
[1:09:44] to face I want you to face here brother
[1:09:46] Stephen wants you to face this brother
[1:09:47] come here Josh come here Rome
[1:09:50] and come here Caleb is that Caleb come
[1:09:52] here Chris come here
[1:09:54] oh we got enough we got enough okay I
[1:09:56] want to have it just like this okay turn
[1:09:58] you ready now this is what God says the
[1:10:01] the priests are going to go into the
[1:10:03] water here's all of the priests they're
[1:10:05] going to go into the water
[1:10:07] and when the priest feet the priesthood
[1:10:10] when they touched the Jordan not before
[1:10:15] but they have to have enough faith when
[1:10:17] they're putting their foot in the water
[1:10:19] that Jordan's gonna Park
[1:10:21] you know sometimes you don't see the
[1:10:23] evidence of what God's doing until you
[1:10:25] take a step of faith and put your foot
[1:10:27] in the water
[1:10:29] it wasn't going to be when they waited
[1:10:31] God was going to do it like Moses when
[1:10:32] he takes a staff and here's God's
[1:10:34] Prophet this is not the Prophet this is
[1:10:36] the priest this is not the Moses
[1:10:38] Ministry of Moses this is the ministry
[1:10:40] of Joshua the Holy Ghost and so Moses
[1:10:43] takes the staff and all the people are
[1:10:45] are are there and he takes a staff
[1:10:47] plants it in the joy in the Red Sea and
[1:10:49] the waters come up like Billows but here
[1:10:51] now the dispensation of priests and so
[1:10:55] he he puts his feet in the water and
[1:10:57] Jordan Parts Waters begin to separate
[1:11:00] then you notice the next priest you
[1:11:02] could you could see the water pardon he
[1:11:03] goes to stand and then the water Parts a
[1:11:05] little bit more and he stands here then
[1:11:07] the water Parts a little bit more and
[1:11:09] before you know it there's a pathway
[1:11:12] going to over to Canaan
[1:11:15] through Jordan
[1:11:17] but you first got to come through who
[1:11:19] the anointed priest that God has placed
[1:11:22] in the Jordan River
[1:11:24] and by their lives or their Ministry
[1:11:27] backing up what Moses had said backing
[1:11:30] up what God had said through Moses
[1:11:32] listen they weren't going to come and
[1:11:34] try to change something or give their
[1:11:36] opinions they were eunuchs they didn't
[1:11:37] have a seat of their own they didn't
[1:11:39] have a thought coming of their own they
[1:11:41] were just going to say what he said they
[1:11:43] were going to preach what he preached
[1:11:45] they weren't going to change it if they
[1:11:47] did it wouldn't have worked
[1:11:49] but those priests job were to be
[1:11:51] faithful to the law that God had given
[1:11:53] and so when they stood in the water and
[1:11:55] that priest what was Jordan to represent
[1:11:57] what was the river representative of
[1:11:59] death
[1:12:01] sin that's what the prophet teaches it
[1:12:03] represents sin and it represents death
[1:12:07] so when a priest who's anointed by God
[1:12:10] and commissioned by a prophet stands in
[1:12:13] death he is commissioned to hold death
[1:12:16] back from his family
[1:12:20] let me say that again when a man of God
[1:12:22] I'm not just talking about preachers I'm
[1:12:24] talking about any Son of God that is
[1:12:26] that is Anointed by the baptism of the
[1:12:28] Holy Ghost when he puts his foot into
[1:12:31] sin or to death that is trying to creep
[1:12:35] into his home he is commissioned by God
[1:12:38] to hold sin out of his family's life
[1:12:41] he's commissioned by God to hold the
[1:12:44] devil out of his gateways to his home
[1:12:46] are you with me Church
[1:12:48] do you realize that the people are
[1:12:50] passing through the waters because
[1:12:53] there's an anointed priesthood who is
[1:12:56] preaching what Moses preached and now
[1:12:57] death stays out of their life and sin
[1:13:00] stays out of their homes
[1:13:05] now let me ask you something what
[1:13:07] happens if the priest decides you know
[1:13:09] that was just brother branham's opinion
[1:13:10] and I really don't know about that and
[1:13:13] then that priest steps out of the water
[1:13:15] and then this priest overhears steps and
[1:13:17] goes you know I just don't know guys
[1:13:19] this is a new modern generation we gotta
[1:13:21] we gotta change it it doesn't exactly
[1:13:23] work here I'm just gonna I'm just gonna
[1:13:25] sit down I I you know I'm just gonna
[1:13:27] take a seat I'll just push play we
[1:13:30] really don't need that anymore do you
[1:13:32] know what happens when priests don't
[1:13:34] stand in their post of Duty and preach
[1:13:36] what Moses is for what Moses preached
[1:13:39] sin comes into the church compromise
[1:13:42] comes into the families
[1:13:45] lukewarmness creeps into the home when a
[1:13:48] priest doesn't stand in his position oh
[1:13:50] let me just preacher today and say I'm
[1:13:53] not gonna you might want to give up on
[1:13:54] the Promises of God you might want to
[1:13:56] change the message and what Elijah said
[1:13:58] I'm going to stand with my foot on the
[1:14:01] promise God gave me and I'm going to
[1:14:03] preach it the way he preached it and I'm
[1:14:06] not coming out of Jordan I'm not taking
[1:14:08] my foot out of the water I'm going to
[1:14:10] preach at Gun Barrel Street
[1:14:13] you say why brother Matt because it's
[1:14:16] because if I don't and we compromise
[1:14:18] then sin is like a tidal wave
[1:14:22] waiting at any moment for someone to
[1:14:24] step out of their position so it can
[1:14:26] flood our churches and flood our young
[1:14:29] people and flood our marriages and flood
[1:14:31] our music and flood our pastor and flood
[1:14:33] our our ministry and flood our churches
[1:14:35] listen friends I don't want Jordan in
[1:14:37] any part of my life how many would stand
[1:14:39] with me would raise a hand and say I
[1:14:41] don't want Jordan and any part of my
[1:14:43] home and in part of my mind any part of
[1:14:45] my spirit I want to say thank God for a
[1:14:48] Ministry that will preach the message of
[1:14:50] the hour without compromise do I have a
[1:14:53] church that's thankful and we'll say
[1:14:55] thank you our brothers and Pastor who
[1:14:58] will preach the unadulterated word
[1:15:01] hallelujah and not change it and not
[1:15:04] compromise on it and not regenerate it
[1:15:07] or modernize it but will preach it the
[1:15:09] way God said it
[1:15:11] amen thank you Brothers
[1:15:15] now God says Joshua I want you to go
[1:15:18] over
[1:15:19] and I want you to take the stone
[1:15:23] where his foot was
[1:15:26] so here's here's that man who got
[1:15:28] ordained to come out of
[1:15:31] to represent Reuben
[1:15:33] to represent Simeon to represent
[1:15:35] Manasseh these are the these are the
[1:15:37] names this is the generation this is the
[1:15:39] family of God
[1:15:41] and God says I want you Joshua to take a
[1:15:44] stone so where his right foot was stay
[1:15:48] there
[1:15:49] take that stone his right foot was right
[1:15:51] there I want you to lift that stone
[1:15:54] and place it here now come over here
[1:15:57] take this Stone here was his left foot
[1:15:59] his left foot was on this Stone right it
[1:16:01] wasn't on that stone it wasn't on that
[1:16:03] over that wasn't on what this brother
[1:16:04] said or with that bro what they said
[1:16:06] over here about three gods or or you
[1:16:08] know baptism in a church no no his foot
[1:16:10] stood on one God to baptism in the name
[1:16:13] of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm going to
[1:16:15] place it right here oh over here oh oh
[1:16:17] so over here it wasn't his his foot was
[1:16:20] right here his foot was on this Stone
[1:16:22] now this priest over here his foot was
[1:16:24] on this Stone what were these Stones
[1:16:26] representative of the original faith
[1:16:29] that was delivered to the Saints it was
[1:16:32] what he stood upon it's what he preached
[1:16:34] it's what Luther preached through
[1:16:36] justification and Wesley preached their
[1:16:37] sanctification and Pentecost preached
[1:16:40] through the restoration of the gifts
[1:16:41] back to the body
[1:16:44] and so he says take these specific
[1:16:46] stones
[1:16:48] don't change it
[1:16:50] because this is where they stood firm
[1:16:55] this is where God's Prophet stood firm
[1:16:58] though doors were shut to him though he
[1:17:00] was his ministry was rejected those said
[1:17:03] I said unto some for three years you
[1:17:04] never invited me so did that mean he
[1:17:06] would change his ministry so that he'd
[1:17:08] get invitations to other churches no he
[1:17:11] stood firm it cost him his family it
[1:17:14] cost him his friends it cost him his
[1:17:15] health
[1:17:17] but his foot stood firm
[1:17:21] and so God
[1:17:22] the Lord tells Joshua take those stones
[1:17:25] because those stones are going to
[1:17:27] represent
[1:17:28] something to the Next Generation
[1:17:32] because there's coming a generation of
[1:17:34] that that generation will go through the
[1:17:36] Wilderness though through Canaan that
[1:17:38] generation may pass off the scene but
[1:17:40] there's come in a Revival
[1:17:43] when children young people begin to look
[1:17:47] into the message for themself and say
[1:17:49] hey what does this mean
[1:17:54] what does this mean Dad and God Joshua
[1:17:57] said the Lord tells Joshua so that you
[1:17:59] can point back not to the opinion not to
[1:18:03] that not to what you think but you could
[1:18:05] point back to the Vindicated word and
[1:18:07] say when God sent a Revival and God sent
[1:18:10] a prophet he separated us from the world
[1:18:13] he separated us from denominational
[1:18:15] ideas he separated us from compromise he
[1:18:19] separated us from a life of sin he
[1:18:21] separated us to not look like the world
[1:18:23] not dressed like the world not act like
[1:18:25] the world not go to the places that the
[1:18:27] world goes
[1:18:30] Jordan was clean we cleaned passed over
[1:18:33] it
[1:18:36] and the Waters of Jordan were separated
[1:18:39] and so that that next Generation could
[1:18:42] receive a Revival
[1:18:44] not by asking mom and dad
[1:18:47] hello
[1:18:48] it was good for Mom and Dad to tell the
[1:18:50] stories it was good for Mom and Dad to
[1:18:52] to to teach the children but those
[1:18:55] children who would receive the Revival
[1:18:57] had to go all the way back to the first
[1:18:59] foundations of when the church was laid
[1:19:01] on the day of Pentecost
[1:19:03] and they would have to receive that same
[1:19:06] experience
[1:19:08] original experience
[1:19:11] that original flame that original fire
[1:19:15] listen to what brother random says here
[1:19:16] this is some foundational things here's
[1:19:18] some Stones where the priests feet
[1:19:21] stood firm
[1:19:23] Paul said I pray in the spirit I'll sing
[1:19:25] in the spirit if there's anything good
[1:19:27] uh he says let's go to the next slide
[1:19:29] brother Noah the next one after that
[1:19:31] he says now he was in the spirit he got
[1:19:35] in the spirit then things begin to take
[1:19:40] place
[1:19:42] notice here maybe he was dancing jumping
[1:19:46] running all around the island he was
[1:19:48] having a good time he was in the spirit
[1:19:51] so that may sound sacrilegious but I
[1:19:54] don't mean it that way he says he could
[1:19:57] well he might have been doing that I
[1:19:59] believe he was having a good time in the
[1:20:01] spirit just praising God because that's
[1:20:04] exactly what happened when the spirit
[1:20:06] fell on them at the first place when the
[1:20:09] Holy Ghost fell on them they staggered
[1:20:12] like drunk men and women and acted like
[1:20:14] they were drunk and jabbering and
[1:20:16] carried on like that until the people
[1:20:18] said these people are full of new wine
[1:20:20] that's the way they acted the first time
[1:20:22] so the Spirit come again he probably
[1:20:25] acted the same way
[1:20:28] I love this statement there's nothing
[1:20:30] new about this
[1:20:32] this thing
[1:20:33] this is an old-time religion
[1:20:38] what is the message of the hour there's
[1:20:39] nothing new about the message over the
[1:20:41] hour
[1:20:42] it's an old time it's the old-time
[1:20:44] religion
[1:20:46] Hallelujah
[1:20:48] he says pray to God for Revelation for a
[1:20:52] revelation by spirit that is the first
[1:20:55] step get in the spirit
[1:21:01] I'm just going to preach that here for a
[1:21:03] moment I could have titled my sermon
[1:21:05] that get in the spirit
[1:21:07] I mean it's you use another illustration
[1:21:09] suppose you need healing what is God's
[1:21:11] words what does the word say well we've
[1:21:13] read it countless times but did not get
[1:21:16] in the spirit when reading it
[1:21:19] I never knew brother Branham said this
[1:21:20] still I read this in patna's vision he
[1:21:23] says we've read it countless times but
[1:21:25] did not get in the spirit when reading
[1:21:26] it did we ask God for his Spirit to
[1:21:29] teach us the real truth of it if we did
[1:21:31] we would call the Elders confess our
[1:21:33] sins be anointed and prayed for and that
[1:21:36] would be that it might not come
[1:21:38] immediately but in his spirit it's all
[1:21:41] over
[1:21:43] there's no other court of appeal God
[1:21:45] will fulfill his word oh we need to get
[1:21:48] in the spirit
[1:21:50] and then things will be done don't go
[1:21:53] through the acts first get in the spirit
[1:21:55] and then go through the acts and watch
[1:21:57] God watch what God will do
[1:22:00] so what is the two keys to a promise of
[1:22:02] God being transferred off of the Bible
[1:22:04] into my life first get in the spirit
[1:22:09] and then go through the acts
[1:22:13] hello
[1:22:15] it's twofold
[1:22:16] you don't just get in the spirit and not
[1:22:18] go through the ax
[1:22:20] you don't just go in the ACT through the
[1:22:21] acts a lot of people go through the acts
[1:22:23] of emotions but they never got in the
[1:22:25] spirit but a lot of people get in the
[1:22:27] spirit but they never are willing to go
[1:22:28] through the acts you say what are some
[1:22:30] of the acts saying Amen to the word of
[1:22:32] God as part of the acts with your vocal
[1:22:35] cords and your voice amening the word if
[1:22:38] you need if you need prayer you get up
[1:22:40] out of your seat you come to an altar
[1:22:42] that's going through the acts when I
[1:22:43] anoint you with oil and we begin to pray
[1:22:45] that's going through the acts how can
[1:22:48] you ever expect God to fulfill his word
[1:22:50] if you're not willing to go through the
[1:22:52] acts
[1:22:54] brother Bradham said that he said a lot
[1:22:55] of people he said a lot of people are
[1:22:57] are expecting God to give them something
[1:23:00] they never asked for
[1:23:03] you gotta ask
[1:23:05] well I thought the Lord knows my heart
[1:23:07] brother Adam says you gotta ask a lot of
[1:23:09] people are waiting for God I just know
[1:23:11] God's going to do it you got to ask
[1:23:12] first
[1:23:13] you've got to go through the acts I'm
[1:23:15] going to keep reading this have you ever
[1:23:16] noticed how the world gets in the spirit
[1:23:18] of things that are in the world
[1:23:20] they go to their ball games they're
[1:23:22] sporting events and their dances they
[1:23:25] enter into the spirit of it they don't
[1:23:28] sit there like Wallflowers
[1:23:30] come on Church they don't sit there like
[1:23:34] Wallflowers
[1:23:35] I've been with you watching some of your
[1:23:37] games you don't sit there like
[1:23:39] Wallflowers you get excited you're
[1:23:41] you're for your team what are you doing
[1:23:43] you're getting in the spirit of it oh
[1:23:45] how much more do we have something so
[1:23:47] much greater than a ball game or a
[1:23:50] football game we have the power of the
[1:23:52] Living God moving amongst us how much
[1:23:56] more should we get in the spirit of our
[1:23:58] church services
[1:24:00] you get in the spirit of it
[1:24:02] they in a ride into the he says they
[1:24:04] don't they don't sit there like
[1:24:06] Wallflowers old dried up sticks they
[1:24:08] enter right into the fill of things and
[1:24:11] become a part of things but oh how they
[1:24:15] hate us Christians forgetting in the
[1:24:17] spirit of God's word they call us
[1:24:19] Fanatics and holy rollers there's
[1:24:21] nothing that they won't do to show their
[1:24:23] hatred or disapproval but I love this
[1:24:25] but ignore that
[1:24:27] you can expect it knowing where it's
[1:24:29] coming from just go on and get in the
[1:24:31] spirit of worship
[1:24:33] don't worry about what the critic says
[1:24:35] don't worry about what the
[1:24:36] traditionalist says just go ahead and
[1:24:38] get in the spirit of it
[1:24:39] Hallelujah
[1:24:41] the Christian
[1:24:42] ought to be just as exuberant and full
[1:24:46] of his pleasure in the Lord as the world
[1:24:49] is when it Savers and delights in its
[1:24:51] pleasures
[1:24:52] both Christians and the world are human
[1:24:56] both have emotions the difference is the
[1:25:01] Christians hearts and emotions are
[1:25:04] purely on The Lord Of Glory and his love
[1:25:06] while the world satisfies the flesh I
[1:25:09] don't know about you but I can identify
[1:25:11] and say Lord my heart is purely on The
[1:25:14] Lord Of Glory and his love he said
[1:25:18] brother Matt is that important it's
[1:25:19] important that we get in the flesh you
[1:25:22] know that's been so so talked about
[1:25:24] you're getting in the flesh as if it was
[1:25:26] a bad thing
[1:25:28] David in Psalms 139 I think it says I
[1:25:31] will praise the Lord he says I will give
[1:25:33] glory to the Lord in my flesh
[1:25:36] I read you the quote just Wednesday
[1:25:38] night brother Brandon says God will be
[1:25:39] so real in their bodies which is their
[1:25:41] flesh
[1:25:42] you say it's not all speak with tongues
[1:25:44] absolutely not all I didn't speak in
[1:25:46] tongues when I was first born of the
[1:25:48] spirit of God I did years later have
[1:25:49] many times since that doesn't mean that
[1:25:51] you'll speak in tongues but did you know
[1:25:53] just while we're here
[1:25:55] while we're here did you know that
[1:25:57] speaking in tongues in the gifts of
[1:25:59] prophets the gift of Prophecy and
[1:26:01] interpretation is the only thing in the
[1:26:03] entire New Testament Bible that you are
[1:26:05] allowed to covet
[1:26:10] thou shall not covet
[1:26:12] anything except speaking in tongues
[1:26:16] well you don't believe me then you don't
[1:26:18] believe the Bible because that's what
[1:26:19] the Apostle Paul said
[1:26:21] he says Brethren covet ask that you may
[1:26:24] prophesy that you may speak in dunks but
[1:26:26] more that you may prophesy in other
[1:26:28] words give an interpretation to it not
[1:26:30] all speak in tongues most of the time
[1:26:32] people listen a lot of the times you get
[1:26:35] you get an individual who doesn't shout
[1:26:37] or doesn't dance that's because they
[1:26:39] don't shout or dance at ball games or
[1:26:41] any other kind of event they express
[1:26:43] themselves in a different way that's
[1:26:45] okay so long as you're expressing
[1:26:47] yourself
[1:26:48] hello so long as you're letting the
[1:26:51] freedom of the Holy Spirit have its way
[1:26:53] it doesn't matter who you are we don't
[1:26:55] have a bunch of lookalikes we don't all
[1:26:57] act the same way the point is we get out
[1:27:00] of ourself and out of our shell and out
[1:27:03] of our being to do something to get
[1:27:05] God's attention
[1:27:14] there's not I'm just going to stop here
[1:27:15] there's not one single emotion that you
[1:27:18] should look for
[1:27:20] but let me say this you something has to
[1:27:23] happen
[1:27:25] I say that on the basis of God's Prophet
[1:27:28] something will happen
[1:27:31] that something may be different but
[1:27:33] something will happen
[1:27:36] something that's exact quote from
[1:27:38] questions and answers when he's asked
[1:27:40] about those that believe the message
[1:27:41] with all their heart yet they've never
[1:27:42] had a Pentecostal experience they've
[1:27:44] never had these signs should they he
[1:27:46] says brother Brandon do they have the
[1:27:47] Holy Ghost or do they still need it
[1:27:48] brother Brandon gives one simple story
[1:27:50] the story of a candle and he says you
[1:27:52] have the candle you have the wick you
[1:27:53] have the Tallow you have all the wax you
[1:27:55] have the vessel and he says that you've
[1:27:57] got all the ingredients and brother
[1:27:58] random points to those ingredients as
[1:28:00] the fruits of the spirit
[1:28:02] you have all of the degree all you're
[1:28:04] made up of all of the word of God you
[1:28:05] have everything in order brother random
[1:28:07] says but until that candle received the
[1:28:10] lighting of the flame
[1:28:12] it's not born again
[1:28:15] it's exactly what he answers and
[1:28:16] questions and answers and it takes the
[1:28:18] lighting of the flame
[1:28:22] something happens and it's not just a
[1:28:24] knowledge or an Enlightenment or
[1:28:25] rationalizing a mental greeting agreeing
[1:28:28] that's not Revelation Revelation is when
[1:28:30] something strikes your heart and it
[1:28:31] brings stimulation by revelation
[1:28:34] listen to me friends he that though all
[1:28:37] those things is the Holy Ghost the Bible
[1:28:39] says the Holy Ghost is the spirit of
[1:28:41] wisdom if you need Wisdom ask for God
[1:28:43] he'll Grant it
[1:28:46] I just read you a verse out of the Bible
[1:28:48] needeth thou Wisdom ask the Lord and He
[1:28:50] Shall give it to thee Solomon asked and
[1:28:52] the lord gave it to him you need wisdom
[1:28:54] knowledge understanding but listen true
[1:28:57] conversion moves beyond the human mind
[1:29:01] it moves Beyond human emotion it moves
[1:29:05] and it happens in the soul
[1:29:08] yet both Realms recognize it
[1:29:13] it did in every case in the Bible every
[1:29:17] single one of them in the book of Acts
[1:29:20] so let me just move on through some of
[1:29:22] this but let me just stop and say you
[1:29:24] say brother Matt does that mean
[1:29:25] something we have to do there there has
[1:29:28] to be something take place do you know
[1:29:31] that that brother branham's with banks
[1:29:33] woods and he throws up a rock in the air
[1:29:36] what was that rocket was a physical
[1:29:38] doing so he didn't just think think
[1:29:40] something in his mind and then brother
[1:29:42] random says Ah caught your thought there
[1:29:44] brother Woods no no no he picks up a
[1:29:46] rock and he throws it up in the air
[1:29:48] and brother random says when that rock
[1:29:50] he said it spun around three times
[1:29:53] and it created just a little disturbance
[1:29:55] in the atmosphere
[1:29:56] just the disturbance in the atmosphere
[1:29:59] and he says and then it began to spin
[1:30:01] and he says when that Whirlwind landed
[1:30:03] it landed on Alaska and nearly sunk it
[1:30:07] what was that that was a person
[1:30:09] physically doing something
[1:30:13] and then God in the Supernatural
[1:30:15] reacting and responding
[1:30:17] what does the Bible say call upon the
[1:30:20] name of the Lord and you shall be saved
[1:30:23] it doesn't say think upon the name of
[1:30:25] the Lord it says call upon the name of
[1:30:28] the Lord I'm just going to keep
[1:30:29] preaching this to you believe it because
[1:30:31] it's the truth when Jesus prays for a
[1:30:33] man he takes mud he spits into the dirt
[1:30:36] and makes UPS why did Jesus do that what
[1:30:39] was he doing because there was a
[1:30:40] representation with something physically
[1:30:43] that had a supernatural consequence
[1:30:46] when brother when he threw throws up the
[1:30:48] Rock brother random says it Disturbed
[1:30:50] the atmosphere you know sometimes when
[1:30:52] you're going through hell and some of us
[1:30:53] are going through hell on Earth in our
[1:30:56] lives you know sometimes the devil is
[1:30:58] gets you to Stew and it'll get you to
[1:31:00] think about it and you get so down in
[1:31:01] your mind and you're struggling with
[1:31:03] that thing and that pressure sometimes
[1:31:05] what you ought to do is use your vocal
[1:31:07] cords and your voice and curse that
[1:31:09] Spirit out loud and it might just
[1:31:12] disturb that atmosphere enough to break
[1:31:15] that Spirit out of your life
[1:31:17] why do we verbally say Amen to the word
[1:31:20] of God when the preacher's preaching to
[1:31:22] disturb the atmosphere to move out of
[1:31:26] this Earthly to get the Heavenly to come
[1:31:28] down
[1:31:29] that's why people stand to their feet
[1:31:31] and Shout not to be emotional though
[1:31:34] it's all right to be emotional it's to
[1:31:36] disturb you're doing something
[1:31:37] physically
[1:31:41] when Hattie Wright speaks I know we used
[1:31:44] this last time but when Hattie Wright
[1:31:46] spoke and said that's nothing but the
[1:31:49] truth brother Brandon
[1:31:51] and brother Brandon says that moved
[1:31:53] heaven
[1:31:54] I I thought about that what would have
[1:31:56] happened had had he not spoke
[1:31:59] hello
[1:32:01] what if she would have just thought
[1:32:02] about it
[1:32:04] and in her mind that's the truth
[1:32:07] I mean friends I'm just going to hear
[1:32:09] that I'm just gonna tell you what a
[1:32:10] prophet said when she spoke those words
[1:32:14] and she spoke them and when you speak
[1:32:16] something enters the atmosphere that's
[1:32:18] troubling you and it breaks something
[1:32:22] that's why the Bible says let the
[1:32:24] redeemed of the Lord say so
[1:32:29] I could go on and on and on and on and
[1:32:31] on and on about it there was something
[1:32:33] physical that was attached to the
[1:32:35] supernatural
[1:32:37] this is why emotion matters to God
[1:32:41] responding to the preaching of the word
[1:32:43] matters to God
[1:32:46] you say why brother Matt because this
[1:32:48] was the original flame listen to what
[1:32:49] brother Brandon says here and go back up
[1:32:51] to the very first quotes Palmer worm uh
[1:32:54] Locust canker worm it's slight 10
[1:32:57] brother Noah listen what brother Adam
[1:32:59] says here now we know that we can only
[1:33:01] build a church first upon the material
[1:33:03] that God gave us to build it with that's
[1:33:05] all we have and I think I know this is
[1:33:08] strong in its own tape hundreds of
[1:33:10] people around the world will hear it but
[1:33:13] before we can ever have a building the
[1:33:15] Church of God will have to restore back
[1:33:18] all those things that these insects has
[1:33:20] ate out of it
[1:33:21] will have to go back before you can go
[1:33:24] forward you got to go back
[1:33:27] and find out what the insects hate
[1:33:29] before this Vine of the Lord the
[1:33:30] Grapevine he's the vine we're the
[1:33:32] branches before we can ever find out or
[1:33:35] the church can stand in its formal and a
[1:33:38] farmer and original Power will have to
[1:33:41] go back and find out what the insects
[1:33:44] ate and the church will have to be
[1:33:48] restored back
[1:33:51] to that
[1:33:54] what are we preaching on some of the
[1:33:56] original Stones where the priest feet
[1:33:58] stood firm
[1:34:00] the church before it will ever stand in
[1:34:02] its glory and its first standing now the
[1:34:06] first thing the church was established
[1:34:09] on the day of Pentecost
[1:34:11] Peter preached the inauguration sermon
[1:34:13] at thee and I'm not going to pronounce
[1:34:14] that word when the church was born my
[1:34:17] son had one and I couldn't even
[1:34:18] pronounce it then
[1:34:20] some of you uh educated people can give
[1:34:22] me that word
[1:34:24] church was born it's the inauguration
[1:34:26] that's what brother Brandon's point is
[1:34:28] and he says the church was born the
[1:34:30] Christian church was born on the day of
[1:34:32] Pentecost
[1:34:33] and if God is infinite infinite cannot
[1:34:36] change his church must remain the same
[1:34:38] as it was at the beginning do you admit
[1:34:40] that the church must remain the same as
[1:34:43] it was listen here listen close to what
[1:34:46] I want to tell you the ever knowledge
[1:34:52] anybody reading with me
[1:34:54] come on call off that false Doctrine
[1:34:59] the ever understanding
[1:35:03] the ever education
[1:35:06] the ever Behavior
[1:35:09] no it's not what he said the ever
[1:35:12] presence
[1:35:14] that's him his person his presence of
[1:35:17] the Living God is the lifeline of any
[1:35:21] church not the personality not the
[1:35:24] Charisma of the man not his gift that he
[1:35:27] has not how good the music is though we
[1:35:29] love good music and we got some of the
[1:35:31] best
[1:35:33] can I get it amen
[1:35:35] we got good song leading some of the
[1:35:37] best we got good church we got good
[1:35:38] gifts but listen that is not the
[1:35:40] lifeline of Bethel Tabernacle what is
[1:35:43] the lifeline of this church the presence
[1:35:46] of the Living God is the lifeline of the
[1:35:50] church
[1:35:51] you could cut everything else out but
[1:35:54] have that and you'd have all you need
[1:35:56] or any bunch of people the ever presence
[1:35:59] of the Living God to perform and to do
[1:36:03] and to act and to live with the people
[1:36:06] as he did at the beginning if the
[1:36:09] presence of the Living God brought a
[1:36:12] Pentecost with power with signs with
[1:36:16] wonders brought a people so full of the
[1:36:19] glory of God till they shouted and spoke
[1:36:22] with other languages and went and
[1:36:25] martyrs for the faith brother random
[1:36:27] says let's earnestly contend
[1:36:30] for that faith
[1:36:32] until death shall set us free earnestly
[1:36:36] fight earnestly struggle earnestly
[1:36:40] contend
[1:36:43] don't compromise
[1:36:45] let us earnestly contend for it if God
[1:36:49] brought forth his first Branch out of
[1:36:52] that vine was a Pentecostal Branch with
[1:36:56] power Visions Revelations healing
[1:37:00] sanctification Holy Spirit the next
[1:37:04] Branch will be the same thing
[1:37:12] it will be the same thing certainly will
[1:37:15] every time that vine puts forth a branch
[1:37:18] it'll be exactly like the first one was
[1:37:21] at the first place the martyrs stood
[1:37:23] there without a bat of his eye he knewed
[1:37:26] where he was standing he know who he had
[1:37:29] believed he was able knowing this that
[1:37:31] God could raise him up in the last day
[1:37:33] because he promised before he'd bowed
[1:37:35] down to any man-made old dirty rack sap
[1:37:38] line he'd die on that stump Hallelujah
[1:37:42] let me die the same place if my God
[1:37:46] doesn't come in my generation here's
[1:37:48] what Elijah said to Elijah I'll die on
[1:37:51] the stump where the canker worms ate to
[1:37:54] it believing that Jesus Christ and his
[1:37:57] church and his word is the same
[1:37:59] yesterday today and forever I'll die on
[1:38:04] this stump let my voice be this
[1:38:10] I might not be able to produce it out of
[1:38:12] all these branches because old sap lines
[1:38:14] here of denomination and Creed cut me
[1:38:16] off and drop me out like a hot potato
[1:38:17] that might be true but I'll Stand loyal
[1:38:20] on the stump and cry that that hour will
[1:38:23] come God will restore his church to its
[1:38:28] former condition
[1:38:30] Hallelujah
[1:38:35] you say brother Matt what are you
[1:38:36] preaching
[1:38:39] listen
[1:38:40] I'm going to read you one more
[1:38:42] the messenger Malachi 4 Revelations 10 7
[1:38:44] is going to do two things according to
[1:38:46] the Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of
[1:38:48] the children to the fathers two he will
[1:38:50] reveal the mysteries of the seven
[1:38:51] Thunders and Revelations 10 which are
[1:38:53] the revelations contained in the Seven
[1:38:55] Seals it will be these divinely revealed
[1:38:58] mystery truths that literally
[1:39:02] physically
[1:39:05] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:39:09] Baptist fathers
[1:39:12] oh I read that wrong
[1:39:15] it'll literally turn the hearts of the
[1:39:18] children back to the pilgrim Holiness
[1:39:20] back to the Assemblies of God back to
[1:39:22] the Methodist back to the Catholic no
[1:39:26] back to 1906 Azusa no
[1:39:30] back to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:39:33] [Applause]
[1:39:33] [Music]
[1:39:34] exactly so he turns the hearts of the
[1:39:37] children back to the faith of the
[1:39:40] Pentecostal father so it would be back
[1:39:42] to the original message
[1:39:46] we know when it gets here it'll be a
[1:39:48] restoration to send that lukewarm
[1:39:50] latency in church back to that original
[1:39:52] Faith back Yonder again and this time
[1:39:56] he's to take the same Faith because they
[1:39:59] got away from the original Faith he's
[1:40:01] going to turn the faith of the fathers
[1:40:03] of the children back to the fathers the
[1:40:06] Pentecostal fathers another
[1:40:10] acts 2. that's right
[1:40:13] another one
[1:40:15] he promised Malachi 4 he would do this
[1:40:18] and manifest his word this is the token
[1:40:20] 1964. for those of you that dates matter
[1:40:22] what date did he say this in the day he
[1:40:25] date he was a prophet that's when
[1:40:27] as brother Aaron says he but Malachi
[1:40:29] before he would do and manifest his word
[1:40:31] to turn the hearts of the children back
[1:40:33] to the fathers again back to the
[1:40:36] original Pentecostal word the real Bible
[1:40:39] word the Pentecostal they claim
[1:40:41] Pentecostal organization there's no such
[1:40:44] a thing
[1:40:45] as a Pentecostal organization Pentecost
[1:40:48] is an experience
[1:40:52] not an organization they tried to
[1:40:54] organize it but you can't see it doesn't
[1:40:55] organize Pentecost is an experience it's
[1:40:58] the Seal of God the holy spirit that
[1:41:01] come on the day of Pentecost
[1:41:05] want to stop here just a moment and
[1:41:07] share a thought with you just something
[1:41:08] I was just pondering on over just last
[1:41:10] night actually before I knew I'd be
[1:41:12] preaching today pondering this just a
[1:41:14] few days ago brother Branham says and he
[1:41:16] preaches this in cankerworm Palmer worm
[1:41:18] Locus caterpillar preaches it and I will
[1:41:20] restore saith the Lord he picks it back
[1:41:22] up in the token in The Invisible union
[1:41:24] he picks it back up all of these later
[1:41:27] messages brother Brandon preaches he's
[1:41:29] preaching the same thing all the way
[1:41:32] from the beginning to the end so anyone
[1:41:35] that wants to come and say oh that was
[1:41:37] back when him brother Brandon was
[1:41:38] Pentecost to him this is the word and
[1:41:40] the word only and though you can't this
[1:41:41] is not a Pentecostal message that was
[1:41:43] back when brother before the seals were
[1:41:45] open listen he tells those same stories
[1:41:46] says those same exact things all the way
[1:41:48] to what house will you build me 1965
[1:41:51] leadership 1965.
[1:41:55] I was pondering this the other day
[1:41:56] brother Adam preaches this and I will
[1:41:58] restore
[1:42:00] and he says and this is Elementary so
[1:42:02] just stay right with me it's not
[1:42:03] complicated he shows how that the church
[1:42:05] Jesus said unless a corn of wheat goes
[1:42:09] dies and goes into the ground it abides
[1:42:11] The Loner brother random picks that
[1:42:12] scripture up in Matthew and says that
[1:42:15] was Jesus prophesying of the Gentile
[1:42:18] dispensation that would start in Ephesus
[1:42:22] through Paul
[1:42:23] and brother Branham says he Jesus knew
[1:42:26] that God would pour out an original
[1:42:28] experience on Pentecost and then that
[1:42:31] church in just a few short years would
[1:42:33] denominate and organize and fall away
[1:42:35] from that original word what is it that
[1:42:37] corn of wheat that seed goes into the
[1:42:39] ground and it dies
[1:42:42] and brother random says it was dead
[1:42:44] throughout the Dark Ages and then he
[1:42:46] comes to the end of the Ephesian
[1:42:47] churches and he says he says all that's
[1:42:49] left is a squalid village with just a
[1:42:51] few Believers signed Pentecost there's
[1:42:52] nowhere to be some of the some of the
[1:42:54] you read some of the things he said in
[1:42:55] Ephesian Church age then he says then
[1:42:57] God promised I will restore I'll restore
[1:43:00] it back through Luther what was Luther
[1:43:02] brother and it says he was a life
[1:43:03] messenger
[1:43:05] and he would restore some of the life
[1:43:07] that seed that went in the ground and
[1:43:09] died it would
[1:43:12] pop up in a stalk
[1:43:15] and brother Brandon says that stalk was
[1:43:17] Luther's message
[1:43:19] and he preached the just shall live by
[1:43:21] faith
[1:43:23] but it wasn't listen the seed was the
[1:43:26] original Church Luther was the stalk he
[1:43:28] wasn't the original church but it was
[1:43:31] the beginning or the framework brother
[1:43:32] Brandon would call it to restore that
[1:43:34] Original Seed
[1:43:37] and so brother random says Luther was
[1:43:39] the stalk and he says brother Adam says
[1:43:41] that that church that died at Pentecost
[1:43:44] would be restored through three life
[1:43:46] Messengers
[1:43:49] and so he calls Luther a life messenger
[1:43:51] he restores justification and he types
[1:43:54] him as the stop then he talks about
[1:43:56] Wesley and he says John Wesley's message
[1:43:59] of sanctification why did he have to
[1:44:02] preach sanctification because the church
[1:44:05] when John Wesley comes on the scene
[1:44:07] they've lived under Luther but brother
[1:44:10] random says what God what would happen
[1:44:12] he says God would send the message there
[1:44:14] would be a Revival that struck the heart
[1:44:16] of people then that messenger would die
[1:44:19] and the people would denominate and
[1:44:21] organize around his teaching and they
[1:44:24] would die the life was was gone so
[1:44:27] Wesley comes along and brother Brandon
[1:44:29] calls him the tassel and he uses the
[1:44:31] wheat plant
[1:44:32] another place he calls him just a blade
[1:44:35] and so here's more restoration and so
[1:44:37] Luther come joestly comes on the scene
[1:44:39] and while everyone's claiming
[1:44:41] justification and they're living
[1:44:43] Justified they're also living like the
[1:44:45] world
[1:44:46] and so Wesley preaches sanctification
[1:44:48] remember the man says what was that it
[1:44:50] was another life messenger death
[1:44:52] messenger had took it out of the church
[1:44:53] God sends a life Messenger to restore a
[1:44:55] little bit back
[1:44:57] and then he says then the third life
[1:44:59] messenger was 1906 Azusa Street
[1:45:04] to a bunch of unlearned people God shows
[1:45:08] up in a little corner somewhere on a
[1:45:10] street that no one had even paid any
[1:45:12] attention to as we preached not some
[1:45:14] great big steeple with brick buildings
[1:45:16] and big oh you know white steeple on the
[1:45:18] top and people in the nicest cars and
[1:45:20] people best dressed the celebrities know
[1:45:23] brother random says he passed all of
[1:45:24] those people by and he shows up in a
[1:45:27] little dingy building
[1:45:29] with hardly any lights in the building
[1:45:32] but he says those people were crying out
[1:45:35] and Desperation for the Holy Ghost and
[1:45:38] for the power of the book of Acts and
[1:45:40] brother Branham says and God pours out
[1:45:42] his Spirit on that little humble group
[1:45:44] of people
[1:45:47] and he says that was the third life
[1:45:49] messenger that's restored back 1906 he
[1:45:52] calls that Pentecost that then
[1:45:55] denominates that same Azusa Street
[1:45:58] Experience just as every other age they
[1:46:01] denominated they rose up organizations
[1:46:03] they they became Church of God they
[1:46:05] became UPC Pentecostal they became they
[1:46:08] gave them all kinds of names became
[1:46:09] denominational shut the doors to brother
[1:46:11] Branham kicked him out of their churches
[1:46:15] I said oh brother man if you'll just
[1:46:16] change this and change that take your
[1:46:18] tapes back and you know you need to call
[1:46:20] those tapes back in and you need to you
[1:46:22] need to you need to you need to bring
[1:46:23] them back and change this brother and it
[1:46:24] says I'm not calling my tapes back in he
[1:46:27] says if you think that was something I'm
[1:46:28] going to preach you harder on the next
[1:46:30] tape I'm going to preach it more
[1:46:32] straight on the next tape what was it he
[1:46:34] wasn't going to compromise by
[1:46:36] celebrities or popularity or what the
[1:46:38] mass installed
[1:46:41] huh
[1:46:42] and so so brother Brandon preaches and
[1:46:45] he preaches this life messenger was
[1:46:47] Pentecost the shock
[1:46:49] was the shock in that shuck brother
[1:46:52] Brandon says if you if you look at it
[1:46:54] and you look at the berries that are on
[1:46:56] that he says they look
[1:46:58] so close to the grain the grain The
[1:47:01] Original Seed
[1:47:02] and he says they looked so close to the
[1:47:05] real I've been with Farmers out in the
[1:47:07] field he says and he says any of you
[1:47:09] weep no any of you farmers who ever
[1:47:11] plant wheat know that that looks so much
[1:47:14] like the real
[1:47:17] Luther didn't look like the real
[1:47:19] he preached part of it but he smoked a
[1:47:22] pipe believed in three gods
[1:47:24] Wesley looked like it no Wesley didn't
[1:47:26] look like it Wesley was a life messenger
[1:47:28] but brother Brandon says but Penny calls
[1:47:30] 1906 with signs and wonders and miracles
[1:47:33] and demonstrations of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:35] looked so much like the real I thought
[1:47:38] this is what I was studying on last
[1:47:40] night
[1:47:41] he says it looks so much like the real
[1:47:44] and then he quotes Matthew 24.
[1:47:49] that it will be so close
[1:47:53] it would be like your left hand and
[1:47:55] right hand he says in another place that
[1:47:57] it would deceive the elected of God if
[1:48:01] it were possible
[1:48:03] amen he calls the Pentecostal Church the
[1:48:07] final stage which was the shock and then
[1:48:09] he preaches the seed
[1:48:11] shall not be heir
[1:48:13] with the shock
[1:48:16] and so he says that but that grain
[1:48:17] though it looked just like it yet inside
[1:48:19] of there when it opened up there was the
[1:48:22] real grain
[1:48:23] and the shock pulls away
[1:48:25] and shuts the door
[1:48:27] and brother Brandon says now what do you
[1:48:29] have at the top of the head you have
[1:48:31] exactly what went in the ground
[1:48:34] the original God of Pentecost back in a
[1:48:36] church again
[1:48:37] but let me just stop here and get you to
[1:48:39] think about something with me the shuck
[1:48:41] pulls away at the point the life leaves
[1:48:44] the shuck that's when Pentecost
[1:48:46] denominates and it moves into the wheat
[1:48:49] the bride elected the literal Life of
[1:48:54] Christ
[1:48:55] the reflecting brother random says she
[1:48:58] would reflect that seed that went in the
[1:49:01] ground
[1:49:03] but almost every time brother Branham
[1:49:06] almost every time he uses this example
[1:49:09] even in 1965 in leadership he references
[1:49:13] Matthew 24 24 that it would be that the
[1:49:17] true
[1:49:18] would be so close to the false
[1:49:22] are you with me
[1:49:23] that it could deceive the very elected
[1:49:25] if it was possible he quotes Matthew 24
[1:49:28] 24 being so close my point is is that if
[1:49:32] the True Church the true church the
[1:49:35] bride Church the elected Church of God
[1:49:38] of the last day
[1:49:40] yeah looks identical
[1:49:43] to the Pentecostal shock
[1:49:47] hello
[1:49:49] I'm not preaching something new this is
[1:49:51] exactly what brother random taught
[1:49:53] that that Pentecostal Church would look
[1:49:57] so much like the real
[1:49:59] that went in the ground yet it wasn't
[1:50:03] so the true church will also look like
[1:50:06] the real but it will be the real
[1:50:10] that's why he says Pentecost
[1:50:14] Pentecost is the standard
[1:50:19] he says there's no other standard that's
[1:50:22] why he says Pentecost is the pattern
[1:50:25] there is no other pattern
[1:50:28] that's why he says the original church
[1:50:31] at Pentecost
[1:50:33] with Mark 16 in action
[1:50:37] come on message believers
[1:50:40] is the true church that Jesus claims as
[1:50:43] his own all else
[1:50:47] is false
[1:50:51] all else is false do you realize
[1:50:55] that the true church and the false
[1:50:57] Church which is not the Baptist Church
[1:51:01] it's not the intellectual dry dead
[1:51:03] church I'm talking about the Pentecostal
[1:51:06] charismatic church that had signs and
[1:51:09] wonders and demonstrations of the Holy
[1:51:11] Ghost do you know that brother Branham
[1:51:13] says that the true church and the false
[1:51:16] church will look so similar
[1:51:20] I know I got you thinking and that's a
[1:51:21] good thing
[1:51:23] listen to what brother Brandon says here
[1:51:24] in this next line
[1:51:25] if you're choking it's made by May uh
[1:51:28] may help you out
[1:51:30] sardesian Church age brother Noah he
[1:51:32] will
[1:51:33] all be the same
[1:51:35] and act the same
[1:51:38] church we'll have the same
[1:51:42] same word and have the same power and if
[1:51:45] the church is the true church it will
[1:51:48] have the very same spirit and word and
[1:51:51] acts of power that they had at
[1:51:55] Pentacles
[1:51:58] by experience it will be a penny costal
[1:52:03] Church
[1:52:06] my only point is this I'm going to make
[1:52:08] it quite simple the look-alike the twin
[1:52:11] doesn't look like the Baptist Church
[1:52:14] it doesn't look like dry dead theology
[1:52:16] solo scriptura
[1:52:20] it doesn't look like it doesn't look
[1:52:22] like dry intellectual theological
[1:52:24] seminars that's not who you're that's
[1:52:26] not who the twin is that's what brother
[1:52:28] random said the one that looked so close
[1:52:31] that would deceive the very elected is a
[1:52:33] church that you turn on the television
[1:52:35] you watch their shows they're shouting
[1:52:37] they're dancing they're there's Miracles
[1:52:39] there's miraculous they believe in the
[1:52:40] power of God they believe in the spirit
[1:52:42] of God
[1:52:43] then I just ask one question if that's
[1:52:45] who our look-alike is then shouldn't we
[1:52:48] at least look like that
[1:52:52] I know it's very simple and should be
[1:52:54] mind-blowing to us if this is our
[1:52:57] look-alike and yet we don't even look
[1:52:58] like the falls
[1:53:02] God help us
[1:53:04] you say brother Matt what are you
[1:53:05] preaching here this morning this is what
[1:53:07] I'm preaching to you no you're about to
[1:53:08] go on an exercise of scripture and so
[1:53:10] just be ready new guy so if someone
[1:53:13] wants to go back there and help him I
[1:53:14] want to read some of these listen to
[1:53:16] what it says in Acts 3 brother Noah Acts
[1:53:18] 3 verse one pull up the the scriptures
[1:53:21] getting if you could fast listen to what
[1:53:23] the book of Acts if we know that the
[1:53:26] true church will be like the first
[1:53:28] church can I get an amen on that
[1:53:30] the true church will look like the first
[1:53:33] church but we just read it brother
[1:53:34] Brandon says she'll be exactly like she
[1:53:36] was maybe I didn't get to finish that
[1:53:38] quote and he says he says if the church
[1:53:40] is the true church it will have the very
[1:53:42] same word and acts of power that they
[1:53:44] had at Pentecost by experience it will
[1:53:47] be a Pentecostal Church there will be
[1:53:50] tongues and interpretation and prophecy
[1:53:53] and healing God will be in the midst of
[1:53:56] her and God would declare himself in the
[1:54:00] midst of her as he always has
[1:54:03] Hallelujah and she will be unorganized
[1:54:07] don't forget that
[1:54:09] I'm reading you what brother Brandon
[1:54:10] says don't forget that
[1:54:14] she will have listen she'll be so much
[1:54:17] like the first church brother random
[1:54:19] even says Paul the first messenger the
[1:54:21] last messenger would be just like Paul
[1:54:24] and so the first Messengers Church would
[1:54:26] look like the last Messengers Church
[1:54:32] you say What's the difference between
[1:54:33] Pentecostal charismatics false and the
[1:54:37] true the only difference is that one
[1:54:39] rejects the word for their hour and one
[1:54:41] accepts it
[1:54:43] one of them compromise on the word of
[1:54:45] God and one of them won't compromise on
[1:54:47] the word of God
[1:54:49] we're not compromisers that's not Who We
[1:54:51] Are
[1:54:51] listen to what it says in Acts 3. I want
[1:54:53] to give you some of these this is
[1:54:54] Matthew 10 you don't have to give me
[1:54:56] that let me read you Matthew 10 1. and
[1:54:57] he called us to him he called to him his
[1:54:59] 12 disciples and gave them authority
[1:55:03] over unclean spirits to cast them out
[1:55:06] and to heal every disease and every
[1:55:08] Affliction this is the power or the
[1:55:11] commission that Jesus commissions the
[1:55:14] first church with
[1:55:15] this is the authority it was a transfer
[1:55:19] of the power of Jesus
[1:55:22] to the believer
[1:55:24] not on Jesus but now I'm the believer
[1:55:26] not on just a prophet but not on your
[1:55:29] lips on your faith on your flesh in your
[1:55:32] home in your family
[1:55:34] the same power transferred
[1:55:38] to the family of God
[1:55:41] listen to what Acts 3 say what are some
[1:55:43] Dimensions if we're to be like the first
[1:55:45] church the book of Acts Church let's
[1:55:47] read about them Acts 3 verse 1. now
[1:55:49] Peter and John went up together in the
[1:55:51] temple at The Hour of Prayer be I'm
[1:55:53] going to read fast so read with me
[1:55:54] because I got a lot
[1:55:56] at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth
[1:55:57] hour and a certain man lame from his
[1:55:59] mother's womb was carried whom they laid
[1:56:00] who laid daily at the Gate of the temple
[1:56:03] which is called Beautiful to ask alms of
[1:56:05] them to enter the temple who's seeing
[1:56:07] Peter and John about to go into the
[1:56:08] temple astronomes and Peter fasting in
[1:56:12] his eyes upon him with John said look on
[1:56:15] us
[1:56:16] and he gave heed unto them in other
[1:56:18] words he paid attention to what they
[1:56:20] said expecting
[1:56:23] expecting
[1:56:25] do you realize you get what you expect
[1:56:29] you're sitting there with your arms
[1:56:31] crossed looking like a sour pickle
[1:56:33] you're gonna get a sour pickle that's
[1:56:35] what you're gonna get
[1:56:37] but those that have hands up that are
[1:56:39] saying Amen to the word of God your in
[1:56:41] expectation you're saying let that God
[1:56:44] of Pentecost come down on me let him
[1:56:47] inhabit the Praises of his people
[1:56:49] let him live in my lips and in my body
[1:56:52] and through my mind and through my heart
[1:56:53] and through my through my flesh and
[1:56:55] every part of me
[1:56:57] he gave heed unto them expecting to
[1:57:01] receive something of them
[1:57:04] then Peter said Silver and Gold Have I
[1:57:06] None
[1:57:07] but such as I have give I Thee in the
[1:57:11] name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up
[1:57:15] and walk
[1:57:17] and he took him by the right hand and
[1:57:19] lifted him up and immediately his feet
[1:57:23] and ankle bones receive strength acts 5
[1:57:26] verse 1 but a certain man named ananias
[1:57:29] with Sapphira his wife sword of
[1:57:31] possession kept back part of the price
[1:57:33] his wife also being privy to it brought
[1:57:35] a certain part and later the apostles
[1:57:36] feet but Peter said an ananias why is
[1:57:40] Satan filled thine heart to lie to the
[1:57:42] Holy Ghost
[1:57:43] do you know Satan can fill your heart to
[1:57:46] lie to the Holy Ghost
[1:57:49] I'll say that again Satan can fill your
[1:57:51] heart to lie to the Holy Ghost
[1:57:56] this is what Peter says and to keep back
[1:57:59] part of the pressure land while it
[1:58:01] remained was it not thine own and after
[1:58:02] it was sold was it not in thine own
[1:58:04] power why is thou conceiving this thing
[1:58:06] in thy heart that was not light unto men
[1:58:09] hold on Peter she just told a lie to you
[1:58:16] so you mean that now Peter and John were
[1:58:20] representing the Holy Ghost
[1:58:24] and when they lied to their Pastor they
[1:58:27] were lying to the Holy Ghost
[1:58:31] it's a sobering thought
[1:58:34] that was not light unto men but unto God
[1:58:37] verse 5.
[1:58:39] well he says in an iris hearing these
[1:58:42] words fell down and gave up the ghost
[1:58:43] died
[1:58:45] and great fear Came Upon all of them
[1:58:47] that heard these things
[1:58:48] verse 12 and by the hands of the
[1:58:51] apostles were many signs and wonders
[1:58:53] wrought among the people and they were
[1:58:56] Solomon's porch and of the rest Durst no
[1:59:00] man join himself to them but the people
[1:59:01] magnified them so the rest of the people
[1:59:04] the rest of the people all of those on
[1:59:06] the outside didn't want anything to do
[1:59:08] with that little church on Mossy Oaks
[1:59:10] Road they didn't want anything to do
[1:59:12] with it stay away from that cult stay
[1:59:14] away from those people but the people
[1:59:16] magnified them and God did Miracles and
[1:59:20] signs and that he says go to the next
[1:59:22] verse and he says and Believers were the
[1:59:25] more added to the Lord multitudes both
[1:59:28] of men and women
[1:59:30] do you know who we want added to this
[1:59:32] Church Believers
[1:59:35] not doubters not questioners not
[1:59:37] compromisers not people that want to
[1:59:40] change it I want a church full of
[1:59:42] Believers because I need a faith an
[1:59:44] atmosphere of faith and it can only come
[1:59:46] when the church is in one heart and one
[1:59:49] Accord and everyone believes the word
[1:59:54] and he says and Believers were added
[1:59:56] unto them and so much that they brought
[1:59:59] forth the sick into the streets and laid
[2:00:02] them on beds and couches that at the
[2:00:05] least the shadow of Peter passing by
[2:00:07] might overshadow some of them there came
[2:00:10] also a multitude out of the city's
[2:00:12] roundabout Jerusalem bringing sick folks
[2:00:15] and them which were vexed with unclean
[2:00:18] spirits and they were healed every one
[2:00:21] if you needed a latte you went down to
[2:00:25] the big mega church but if you need
[2:00:27] delivered of a disease and an evil
[2:00:29] spirit you went to the book of Acts
[2:00:31] church if you needed a feel-good Vibe
[2:00:34] for that Sunday morning you went down to
[2:00:36] the mega church but if you needed the
[2:00:38] power oh do I have somebody here they
[2:00:41] could say I don't need a feel-good I
[2:00:42] don't need a good vibe I need the power
[2:00:45] of God preached an adulterated word of
[2:00:47] God to come and be spoken to my life oh
[2:00:51] how many would say that's what I want
[2:00:53] that's what I'm going looking for that's
[2:00:55] what I'm Desiring in my life
[2:00:57] I want the spirit of God
[2:01:00] Hallelujah
[2:01:05] ax listen to this this is we're in Acts
[2:01:08] 5. notice this in Acts chapter 8.
[2:01:11] verse 14. now when the apostles which
[2:01:13] were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria
[2:01:15] received the word of God they're sending
[2:01:16] them Peter and John who they were to
[2:01:18] come down prayed for them that they
[2:01:19] might receive the Holy Ghost
[2:01:22] for as yet
[2:01:24] he was falling upon none of them
[2:01:27] only they were baptized in the name of
[2:01:30] the Lord Jesus then they laid their
[2:01:33] hands on them and they received the Holy
[2:01:36] Ghost acts 9 verse 33 and there he found
[2:01:40] a certain man named manias which had
[2:01:42] kept the bed which it which had kept his
[2:01:44] bed eight years and was sick of the
[2:01:47] palsy and Peter said unto them anes
[2:01:50] Jesus Christ maketh thee whole arise and
[2:01:54] make thy bed and he arose immediately
[2:01:59] verse 36 now there was a japa a certain
[2:02:01] disciple named Tabitha which by
[2:02:03] interpretation is called Dorcas this
[2:02:06] woman was full of good works and all
[2:02:09] armed Deeds which she did and it came to
[2:02:11] pass in those days that she was sick and
[2:02:13] died whom when they had washed they laid
[2:02:17] her in an upper chamber for as much as
[2:02:20] Lydia was night to Joplin the disciples
[2:02:22] had heard that Peter was there they said
[2:02:24] unto him two men Desiring him that he
[2:02:26] would not delay to come to them then
[2:02:28] Peter arose and went with him when he
[2:02:30] was come they brought him into the upper
[2:02:32] chamber and all the window all the
[2:02:34] widows stood by him weeping and showing
[2:02:36] the coats and garments which dork has
[2:02:38] made while she was with them they were
[2:02:40] weeping memorizing this is this woman we
[2:02:42] love so much but Peter put them all
[2:02:45] forth
[2:02:47] and kneel down and prayed and turning
[2:02:51] him to the body said Tabitha
[2:02:54] arise
[2:02:56] and she opened her eyes and when she saw
[2:02:59] Peter she sat up and gave her his hand
[2:03:02] and lifted her up and when he had called
[2:03:04] the Saints and widows presented her
[2:03:07] alive
[2:03:09] this is what we believe this is what we
[2:03:13] preach Resurrection to the dead life to
[2:03:18] the dead freedom to the addicted freedom
[2:03:21] to the depressed
[2:03:23] I say God pour it out in this church
[2:03:25] pour out that resurrection power in my
[2:03:28] life pour out a Revival where the Deads
[2:03:30] are there that have been given up on yet
[2:03:32] God pours the spirit and you might have
[2:03:35] gave up on them but God raises them up
[2:03:37] to life
[2:03:39] Hallelujah
[2:03:40] acts 12 and behold the angel Lord came
[2:03:43] over and a light shine in this prison
[2:03:44] and he smoked Peter on the side this is
[2:03:46] acts 12 verse 7 and raised him up saying
[2:03:49] to rise up quickly and his change fell
[2:03:51] off of his hands the angel said unto him
[2:03:53] gird thyselfs and bind on my sandals and
[2:03:55] so he did and he said unto him cast thy
[2:03:58] garment about thee and follow me and he
[2:04:00] went out and followed him and knew not
[2:04:02] that it was true which was done by the
[2:04:04] angel but thought he saw a vision in
[2:04:06] other words it was real
[2:04:08] when they were past the first and the
[2:04:10] second ward they came unto the Iron Gate
[2:04:12] that leadeth unto the city which opened
[2:04:15] of which opened to them of his own
[2:04:18] accord
[2:04:19] hold on a minute did we just read that
[2:04:21] right you mean bars and doors that man
[2:04:24] had shut God can open
[2:04:27] I said doors and bars and Gates
[2:04:30] that the devil has shut and they haven't
[2:04:33] opened God says I'll open them in your
[2:04:36] life you might have given up on them and
[2:04:38] said it'll never open but God said I'm
[2:04:40] going to open those doors that have been
[2:04:41] shut in your life
[2:04:45] Hallelujah
[2:04:47] and they went out and passed on through
[2:04:48] one Street
[2:04:50] and forth with the angel departed from
[2:04:53] him
[2:04:54] notice this and when Peter was come to
[2:04:56] himself he said now I know of a shorty
[2:05:00] that the Lord had sent his Angel and
[2:05:03] that delivered me out of the hand of
[2:05:05] Herod and from all the expectation of
[2:05:08] the people of the Jews and when he had
[2:05:09] considered the thing he came to the
[2:05:11] house of Mary the mother of John whose
[2:05:13] surname was Mark or many were gathered
[2:05:15] together praying and as Peter knocked at
[2:05:17] the door of the gate a damsel came to
[2:05:20] hearken named Rhoda
[2:05:22] acts 13 Verse 6 but elements the
[2:05:27] sorcerer for so is his name by
[2:05:30] interpretation withstood them seeking to
[2:05:32] turn them away and he said seeking to
[2:05:34] turn away the deputy from the faith then
[2:05:37] Saul who is also called Paul filled with
[2:05:39] the Holy Ghost that's an important thing
[2:05:41] what made Saul Paul he was filled with
[2:05:43] the Holy Ghost set his eyes on him and
[2:05:46] said oh for all full of septility and
[2:05:49] all Mischief thou shout of the devil
[2:05:51] thou enemy of all righteousness wilt
[2:05:54] thou not cease to pervert the right ways
[2:05:56] of the Lord and now behold the hand of
[2:05:58] the Lord is upon thee and thou shalt be
[2:06:00] blind not seeing the Sun for a season
[2:06:03] and immediately there fell on him a mist
[2:06:06] and a darkness and he went about seeing
[2:06:09] sin and he went about seeking some to
[2:06:11] lead him by the hand
[2:06:14] you see there's blessings that come with
[2:06:16] this church and there's cursing that
[2:06:19] comes to this church that's why we say
[2:06:22] the most dangerous spot you can be in
[2:06:25] it's a church that is preaching the full
[2:06:27] unadulterated word of God it's the most
[2:06:31] dangerous place you can be in because
[2:06:33] when we speak it and you hear it you are
[2:06:36] now held accountable for what you have
[2:06:39] heard
[2:06:40] and it's not my words if I had my words
[2:06:42] it wouldn't mean nothing not a hill of
[2:06:44] beans but when I speak the word of God
[2:06:46] that's been Vindicated then it's on your
[2:06:49] laps what you do with it I say God help
[2:06:52] us to have a ten of hearts
[2:06:55] acts 16 let's keep going and it came to
[2:06:58] pass verse 16 acts 16 16. no I'm sorry I
[2:07:01] missed one acts 14 14 verse 8 acts 14
[2:07:05] verse 8. there's had a certain man at
[2:07:07] lystra impotent in his feet being a
[2:07:10] from its mother's womb who had
[2:07:12] never walked the same heard Paul speak
[2:07:14] who steadfastly beholding him and
[2:07:16] perceiving that he had Faith to be
[2:07:18] healed said with a loud voice why do we
[2:07:21] use a loud voice because they did in the
[2:07:22] Bible
[2:07:23] so I'm using a loud voice
[2:07:26] you know sometimes you got to speak loud
[2:07:27] enough for the devil to hear you
[2:07:29] sometimes you got to say Amen I'm not
[2:07:31] loud enough for your doubt to hear you
[2:07:33] for that fear to hear you speak over
[2:07:35] those voices of fear speak over that
[2:07:38] doubt one time it'll shut the devil up
[2:07:40] in your life
[2:07:42] and he cried out with a loud voice
[2:07:45] stand up right on my feet
[2:07:48] and he leaped
[2:07:51] and walked
[2:07:53] and he leave him being a the
[2:07:55] same hurt Paul speak he said save with
[2:07:57] the loud voice stand upright upon the
[2:07:58] feet notice acts 16 verse 16 now and it
[2:08:01] came to pass as he went to prayer a
[2:08:03] certain damsel possessed with the spirit
[2:08:04] of divination met us which brought her
[2:08:07] Masters much gained by sooth saying the
[2:08:09] same followed Paul and us and cried
[2:08:12] saying these men are the Servants of the
[2:08:14] most high God which show unto us the way
[2:08:16] of Salvation and this did she many days
[2:08:19] but Paul be in grieved turned aside and
[2:08:23] said to the spirit I command thee in the
[2:08:25] name of Jesus Christ to come out of her
[2:08:28] and he came out that same hour
[2:08:30] expert and had the same chapter verse
[2:08:33] 25.
[2:08:34] and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed
[2:08:36] and sang Praises unto God and the
[2:08:39] prisoners
[2:08:40] heard them
[2:08:45] you know what when you sing the
[2:08:47] prisoners ought to hear you sing
[2:08:50] I said when you sing the prisoners ought
[2:08:53] to hear you sing
[2:08:55] because when the prisoners hear you sing
[2:08:58] those prisoners might get to go free
[2:09:01] the Bible says he praised God and the
[2:09:03] prisoners heard them
[2:09:06] and suddenly there was a great
[2:09:09] earthquake so that the foundations of
[2:09:12] the prison were shaken and immediately
[2:09:14] all the doors were opened and everyone
[2:09:17] not just Paul not just Silas but
[2:09:21] everyone that was bound everyone that
[2:09:25] was diseased everyone that had spirits
[2:09:28] of evil everyone that was afflicted
[2:09:30] everyone that was in Chains you see when
[2:09:33] the people of God can get free Enough To
[2:09:36] Worship in the spirit of God and not
[2:09:38] care about what everybody thinks
[2:09:40] prisoners can go free
[2:09:42] addicted can drop can throw off their
[2:09:44] chains I say God let me get free enough
[2:09:47] so that all the prisoners can go free in
[2:09:50] our church oh let me get so free let me
[2:09:53] get so full of praise and worship that
[2:09:57] not a devil can stay in this building
[2:09:59] but we run him out of the windows and
[2:10:01] run him out of the door and freedom can
[2:10:03] go to Every Chain and every disease and
[2:10:07] every burden and every heart and every
[2:10:09] every disease of sickness every demon of
[2:10:12] depression every disease and a demon of
[2:10:14] Affliction and anxiety won't stand a
[2:10:17] chance in the presence of God if the
[2:10:19] church can get free
[2:10:22] how many would say I want that kind of a
[2:10:24] church
[2:10:26] Acts 19 verse 1 then said Paul John
[2:10:29] verily baptized with the baptism of
[2:10:30] repentance saying unto the people that
[2:10:32] they should believe on him which should
[2:10:33] come after him that is on Christ Jesus
[2:10:36] when they heard this they were baptized
[2:10:39] in the name of the Lord Jesus and when
[2:10:42] Paul had laid his hands on them the Holy
[2:10:44] Ghost came on them and they spoke with
[2:10:46] tongues and prophesied
[2:10:50] verse 11 Acts 19 and God wrote special
[2:10:53] miracles
[2:10:55] by the hands of Paul
[2:10:58] so that from his body were brought into
[2:11:01] the sick handkerchiefs and aprons and
[2:11:04] the diseases departed from from them and
[2:11:07] the evil spirit went out of them
[2:11:11] it should be our expectation
[2:11:17] I said it should be our expectation
[2:11:23] do you know that that Marcus Humphrey
[2:11:25] the man who was healed of stage four
[2:11:26] Hodgkin's lymphoma I mean I won't have
[2:11:28] time he'll have to give the testimony do
[2:11:30] you know that that's the second time
[2:11:31] cancer has been healed supernaturally in
[2:11:35] the life of brother Travis also prayed
[2:11:37] for a little boy that was diseased with
[2:11:39] cancer went to his grandpa's house the
[2:11:42] boy was in a bed giving up on was gonna
[2:11:44] die and brother Travis took a prayer
[2:11:46] cloth of brother Branham or one that we
[2:11:47] had prayed over
[2:11:48] yeah a prayer cloth of God's Prophet
[2:11:51] laid it on that boy went to that job
[2:11:53] sometime later that boy was
[2:11:54] supernaturally healed of cancer
[2:11:57] you say brother Matt what does that mean
[2:11:59] it should be our expectation this should
[2:12:02] be the Church of Pentecost this should
[2:12:04] be the church with signs and wonders
[2:12:07] this should be our expectation not a
[2:12:10] dead drive just teaching just some kind
[2:12:12] of some kind of lifestyle that we have
[2:12:14] of long hair and dresses oh thank God
[2:12:16] for it but there ought to be a life
[2:12:18] there ought to be a spirit that backs up
[2:12:21] that lifestyle there ought to be a power
[2:12:24] that backs up your preaching there ought
[2:12:26] to be a power that backs up your family
[2:12:28] and your prayers
[2:12:30] ought to be heard by God I say God give
[2:12:32] us a power like they had in the book of
[2:12:35] Acts to where we speak and God listens
[2:12:38] to where we petition and God sets us
[2:12:41] free
[2:12:43] this is the Church of Pentecost
[2:12:46] Acts chapter 20. verse 9 I'm going to
[2:12:49] close don't get scared
[2:12:52] and they're sat in the way a window a
[2:12:54] certain young man and uticus being
[2:12:56] fallen into a deep sleep and as Paul was
[2:12:59] long
[2:13:05] my goodness brother Matt
[2:13:07] it's 112.
[2:13:12] Paul was long
[2:13:15] preaching
[2:13:19] he sunk down with sleep and fell down
[2:13:22] from the third Loft and was taken up
[2:13:24] dead and Paul went down and fell on him
[2:13:27] and embracing him said trouble not
[2:13:30] yourself for his life is in him
[2:13:33] when he therefore has come up again and
[2:13:34] he had broken bread and eaten and talked
[2:13:37] a long while
[2:13:40] when God raises you from the dead long
[2:13:42] while and long sermons and long
[2:13:44] preaching don't bother you a bit
[2:13:46] yeah
[2:13:49] even till the break of day
[2:13:53] and they brought the young men alive and
[2:13:55] we're not a little comforted listen to
[2:13:57] what it says that that simply means it
[2:13:59] wasn't just a little Comfort they were
[2:14:01] greatly comforted acts 28 just two more
[2:14:04] I think two more acts 28 verse 3 and
[2:14:07] when Paul had gathered a bundle of
[2:14:09] sticks and laid them on the fire there
[2:14:11] came a viper out of the Heat and
[2:14:13] fastened on his hand and when The
[2:14:15] Barbarians saw the venomous Beast hang
[2:14:17] on his hand they said among themselves
[2:14:18] no doubt this man is a murderer whom
[2:14:21] though he had escaped the sea yet
[2:14:23] Vengeance suffereth not to live this is
[2:14:26] what they actually thought of him
[2:14:28] yeah the guy escaped that shipwreck but
[2:14:31] now the Viper's biting him he must be a
[2:14:33] devil
[2:14:36] and he shook off the Beast I love how
[2:14:38] simple it was and he shook it off you
[2:14:42] know when people criticize you shake it
[2:14:44] off
[2:14:45] don't buy don't don't don't get weighted
[2:14:47] down with that and try to argue just
[2:14:49] shake it off into the fire when that
[2:14:51] Devil comes by then you just shake him
[2:14:53] off you ain't nothing devil I'm just
[2:14:55] gonna shake you off a little bit of
[2:14:57] Doubt comes in my heart I'm just gonna
[2:14:59] shake you off I'm not going to pay no
[2:15:01] attention to you
[2:15:03] and he says he shook him off into the
[2:15:06] fire and felt no horror how be it they
[2:15:07] looked when he should have swollen or
[2:15:09] Fallen dead down dead suddenly but after
[2:15:12] they had looked a great while and saw no
[2:15:14] harm come to him they changed their
[2:15:16] minds and said he was a god
[2:15:21] they weren't wrong
[2:15:24] he wasn't God but he was a messiah with
[2:15:27] God's power flowing through his veins
[2:15:31] acts 28 verse said look look at verse 7
[2:15:34] same chapter in the same last one in the
[2:15:36] same quarters were possessions of the
[2:15:38] chief man of the island whose name was
[2:15:40] publish I think that's how I'm saying
[2:15:42] that correctly who received us and
[2:15:44] lodged us three days courteously and it
[2:15:47] came to pass that the father lay sick of
[2:15:49] a fever and of a bloody flux to whom
[2:15:52] Paul entered in and prayed and laid his
[2:15:54] hands on him oh hold on a minute you
[2:15:56] mean Paul didn't just walk up to him and
[2:15:58] say you ought you should just accept it
[2:16:00] and believe it brother
[2:16:03] God said just believe it just accept it
[2:16:06] even Paul didn't just walk in and go
[2:16:08] uh-huh yeah amen amen
[2:16:12] you mean Paul did something physically
[2:16:15] he used his physical hands to lay hands
[2:16:18] upon him
[2:16:19] you mean it might have to start in the
[2:16:21] flesh before God will do anything for
[2:16:22] you sometimes your brother and said
[2:16:24] you've got to go through the ax if
[2:16:26] you're not willing to go through the
[2:16:27] acts you'll never get to the spirit
[2:16:30] and he laid his hands upon him
[2:16:33] Paul and her prayed and laid his hands
[2:16:35] on him and healed him
[2:16:38] so when this was done others also which
[2:16:41] had diseases in the island came and were
[2:16:46] healed
[2:16:51] when the spirit of God came this is what
[2:16:54] it looked like
[2:16:55] in the book of Acts Church
[2:16:58] and brother Branham says that false
[2:17:00] church that Pentecostal church and 1906
[2:17:03] the Azusa Street that had had organized
[2:17:06] and denominated
[2:17:09] because they rejected the word
[2:17:11] and brother Brandon says those doors
[2:17:13] you've closed to me you won't even have
[2:17:14] me preach oh brother random change this
[2:17:16] and change that and then he comes to
[2:17:18] that comes to that same exact message
[2:17:20] and says oh but I'm so glad they might
[2:17:22] have turned me down but I'm so glad for
[2:17:24] these churches these these little few
[2:17:26] churches that have opened their doors to
[2:17:29] me and for your young Pastor here who's
[2:17:32] caught the inspiration what was it it
[2:17:35] was more than just a teaching or a
[2:17:37] Doctrine or an understanding or theology
[2:17:39] he had caught the inspiration of Elijah
[2:17:43] he had caught the inspiration of the
[2:17:46] message that this as they said in the
[2:17:48] book of Acts Peter said this is that
[2:17:54] Peter said this
[2:17:56] is that
[2:17:58] that job prophesied about that I will
[2:18:01] restore saith the Lord and your young
[2:18:04] men shall dream dreams and your your
[2:18:07] young men shall see vision and your old
[2:18:09] men shall dream dreams I'll pour out my
[2:18:12] spirit upon All Flesh what was that
[2:18:16] Spirit he was pouring out it wasn't the
[2:18:19] denominational Spirit it wasn't a spirit
[2:18:22] of Education it wasn't a spirit of
[2:18:24] intellect it wasn't just Doctrine it was
[2:18:26] a supernatural anointing it was a
[2:18:30] supernatural spirit that dwelt on Elijah
[2:18:32] and I say God let me be a recipient of a
[2:18:36] double portion of the same spirit that
[2:18:38] fell at the book of Acts well how many
[2:18:40] would stand to their feet and raise
[2:18:41] their hand and say Lord let me be a
[2:18:44] recipient of that double portion
[2:18:47] let it live in me let it breathe through
[2:18:49] me let it think through me let my
[2:18:52] thoughts be its thoughts Let My Words Be
[2:18:54] its words
[2:18:55] oh God I raised my hands this morning
[2:18:58] and I say God give me a church as your
[2:19:01] Prophet said give me a church that's
[2:19:04] every move
[2:19:06] it's thus saith the Lord
[2:19:09] and I say and I Echo those words and
[2:19:12] there's a group of people here that'll
[2:19:13] raise hands and Echo those words give me
[2:19:16] a church that every move is thus saith
[2:19:19] the Lord
[2:19:21] and I'll show you a messiah
[2:19:24] upon the Earth give me a church that's
[2:19:27] so full of the power of God and so full
[2:19:30] of the spirit of God there wouldn't be a
[2:19:32] sick person in this building there
[2:19:34] wouldn't be a disease in this building
[2:19:36] that couldn't stand to be here give me
[2:19:38] the power of God so strong Lord that
[2:19:40] would care that would every demon Spirit
[2:19:42] would flee every lion devil would every
[2:19:45] every every every lying voice would be
[2:19:48] silenced every lion tongue would be
[2:19:50] silenced oh God I wonder if you would
[2:19:53] raise your hand and say that today hands
[2:19:55] up all over the building
[2:19:58] give me that Lord Jesus
[2:20:02] give me that Lord
[2:20:05] give me that give our church that
[2:20:09] all friends that your head bowed every
[2:20:11] eye closed
[2:20:18] I'm just going to say what the
[2:20:19] inspiration of the Holy Spirit has upon
[2:20:21] my heart you can just play something
[2:20:22] Softly
[2:20:25] every voice and every spirit
[2:20:28] is trying to shut this up
[2:20:32] and every every demon spirit and evil
[2:20:35] spirit is doing everything he can to
[2:20:38] silence our voices to shut our mouths to
[2:20:42] cause us to sit down
[2:20:44] every kind of evil spirit trying to get
[2:20:46] us to backslide and trying to get us to
[2:20:48] compromise do you know why do you know
[2:20:50] why people don't want this kind of
[2:20:51] preaching because it was prophesied they
[2:20:54] would come into the spirit of the last
[2:20:55] days
[2:20:57] and in the spirit of the last days it
[2:20:59] said they would Heap unto themselves
[2:21:01] this is the scripture
[2:21:03] they would Heap unto themselves teachers
[2:21:07] having itching ears
[2:21:12] there would be a generation of people
[2:21:18] that Paul would speak of and say for the
[2:21:19] time will come
[2:21:21] when they won't endure
[2:21:23] sound Doctrine
[2:21:25] they don't want that preaching they
[2:21:27] won't want them they won't they won't
[2:21:29] want that kind no they won't want that
[2:21:31] kind that's what brother random speaks
[2:21:33] of an invisible Union they don't he says
[2:21:35] they don't want any of them tongue
[2:21:36] talking that's not the kind of children
[2:21:38] they want they don't want them miserable
[2:21:41] wretches that they call them their
[2:21:43] Church would put them out if they had
[2:21:44] them they don't want anything to do with
[2:21:45] that Pentecostal message
[2:21:48] they want to modernize it and paint it
[2:21:50] up and dress it up and re-culture it and
[2:21:52] redefine it
[2:21:53] because it was prophesied
[2:21:55] for the time will come when they won't
[2:21:58] endure sound Doctrine but having itching
[2:22:00] ears they'll Heap unto themselves
[2:22:02] teachers
[2:22:05] [Music]
[2:22:08] teachers
[2:22:10] that they'll Heap after their own lusts
[2:22:13] this is going to be the heart of the the
[2:22:15] people prophesy unto us smooth things
[2:22:20] this is what Isaiah said in Isaiah
[2:22:22] chapter 30. they say which say to the
[2:22:25] seers and the prophets don't see
[2:22:27] prophesy not Prophet prophesying to us
[2:22:30] right things speaking to us smooth
[2:22:33] things prophesying to us deceits do you
[2:22:35] know this was a prophecy of this age
[2:22:38] 2022 there's a spirit that is moving on
[2:22:41] religious people it's in denominational
[2:22:44] churches and sadly to say it's in
[2:22:46] message churches it's upon
[2:22:48] make-believers and unbelievers
[2:22:50] a spirit that will doesn't like this
[2:22:52] kind of preaching wants to shut it up
[2:22:54] prophesy tell us good things tell us
[2:22:56] smooth things don't talk about those
[2:22:58] kind of things
[2:23:00] but let me give you your commission this
[2:23:02] is what the lord gave me let me give you
[2:23:04] your commission
[2:23:05] Paul said I charge thee
[2:23:09] before God in other words I command thee

[2:23:15] judge the quick and the dead at his
[2:23:17] appearing in his kingdom preach the word
