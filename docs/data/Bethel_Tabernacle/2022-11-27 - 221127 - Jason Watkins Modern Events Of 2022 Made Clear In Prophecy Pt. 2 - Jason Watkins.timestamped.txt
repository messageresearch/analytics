[35:40] Lord You're continued and complete
[35:42] blessing upon her that this will all end
[35:45] Lord redounding completely to your glory
[35:48] we give you thanks for our visitors
[35:51] today and we ask now do you be with us
[35:52] in a special way in Jesus name amen God
[35:57] bless you friends you can be seated
[36:06] praise the Lord so I I managed last week
[36:11] to lay some foundation on a burden
[36:15] that's on my heart and I was looking
[36:18] back over the notes as I was as I was
[36:20] probably the last third we were able to
[36:24] kind of turn it
[36:25] um you know
[36:27] introspectively and that's always to me
[36:30] the value of the word the the the
[36:32] preaching doesn't really come just to
[36:34] fill your head full of data all right
[36:36] I'm not here just to just to you know
[36:39] talk about all the advances in theology
[36:41] that we have because as we've said
[36:44] before the gospel this message which is
[36:47] the gospel restored didn't come to just
[36:50] fill up our heads with theology we you
[36:54] say well we we have Superior theology
[36:56] here there wouldn't we naturally have
[36:59] that with the opening of the seals and
[37:02] the restoration of the word you would
[37:04] but you didn't do anything that was him
[37:07] so come off your high horse and just say
[37:10] thank God that blessed are your eyes
[37:13] that see in your ears that hear for many
[37:16] have desired and it wasn't granted
[37:19] but we realize that that God has indeed
[37:23] given us and but you know what what is
[37:26] really important in the in the
[37:29] understanding of deeper things of God is
[37:33] why
[37:34] God brought it to you and I've already
[37:37] said it's not just to increase your
[37:39] theological understanding it's far more
[37:41] than that it's it's actually to because
[37:45] you are what you eat and you're the
[37:47] things you gaze at you're transformed
[37:49] into the Bible teaches us so yes uh if
[37:53] God wants us to become the perfect image
[37:57] of Christ at the end time which is what
[37:59] the prophecy said would happen for the
[38:00] bride she would come perfectly into his
[38:03] image and that and that would enable the
[38:05] Capstone to have an invisible Union and
[38:09] we have that then we realize then it's
[38:11] far more than just head knowledge it's
[38:13] got to get down into the gears down into
[38:15] the engine room and it's got to have
[38:17] some way to make the word live
[38:21] it's not just restoring signs and
[38:23] wonders and powers and miracles how
[38:25] about a power to be an overcomer
[38:28] how about a power to have a simple life
[38:30] of prayer like brother Caleb was
[38:32] ministering on today how about a
[38:34] determination and an impossible
[38:36] situation to say I'm going to press on
[38:40] regardless of how weird I become to the
[38:44] world what an oddball does it matter I'm
[38:47] going to press on because I'm I've I've
[38:49] been brought into the to the vision of
[38:51] the word of God
[38:56] so it's for our ratification it's for
[38:59] correction it's it's uh you know and you
[39:02] you you want to think you know
[39:05] introspection is so good because uh you
[39:08] know we don't just want to be Camp Stars
[39:10] we don't just want to run from service
[39:12] to service from meeting to meeting and
[39:14] Shout here and Shout here and Shout
[39:15] there but we're only shouting at the
[39:17] meetings and everywhere in between
[39:21] see so so we want to apply the word down
[39:25] into our hearts so as we looked at it
[39:27] last Sunday we were really talking about
[39:31] a lot of things that thrilled the bride
[39:33] it just Thrills us and it's hard to to
[39:36] keep calm and the stimulation from it
[39:39] stimulation as brother Brenda would say
[39:41] stimulation amen boy wow amen so but but
[39:45] you know it's not about just blowing it
[39:48] out the whistle it's get that Steam down
[39:50] into the gears and make this locomotive
[39:52] start going down the track
[39:54] all right so that's that's what we want
[39:58] so you know we were able then last week
[40:01] to hit a few things which were real
[40:04] burdens of my heart
[40:06] and uh how that it it should have an
[40:09] effect in our lives and it ought to just
[40:10] as you've heard me say many times the
[40:13] only difference between affect and
[40:15] effect is one letter but the meaning is
[40:17] vastly different you can come here and
[40:19] get thrilled in the word and be greatly
[40:21] affected your Cry tears and feel
[40:23] Goosebumps and want to jump and run but
[40:26] does it affect change when you leave
[40:29] here has change been affected in your
[40:32] life I don't just want to be affected I
[40:35] want to be affected by the word of God
[40:38] that is my all-consuming burning desire
[40:42] is to come into this image oh my it
[40:46] don't don't take me into a seven course
[40:49] meal and and it's so magnificent and I
[40:52] lick my chops and tell me I I can't
[40:54] really eat it if if I'm gonna get to go
[40:56] see it let me have a feast and let me
[40:59] eat it let me assimilate it
[41:01] [Music]
[41:04] we're not here to leave the same way in
[41:06] fact as you can't that's the that's both
[41:09] the blessing and the danger uh the curse
[41:13] as it were you say God would bless and
[41:14] curse he sure would he told Israel made
[41:16] him walk between Mount druism and mount
[41:19] evil and he put priests on this side on
[41:22] Mount charism and put priest over here
[41:23] on evil and the children of Israel had
[41:26] to walk between those two mountains and
[41:27] these priests shouted blessings for
[41:29] keeping God's word and these priests
[41:31] shouted cursings for breaking his word
[41:33] and as the Israelites walked through
[41:35] there they had to hear it in stereo
[41:37] they had to go right through the middle
[41:39] of that and make up they were you
[41:41] talking about being in the valley of
[41:42] decision
[41:44] so when you come here to the house of
[41:47] God to hear the word of God this isn't a
[41:49] place to play this isn't Disney World
[41:52] this is this is the valley of decision
[41:54] and people are gaining eternal life
[41:57] are forfeiting their own Mercies and
[42:00] that's why Prophet said you can't leave
[42:02] the same you will either leave and prove
[42:04] you'll leave better or you'll leave
[42:05] worse you'll leave with the deficit I
[42:07] don't want to deficit I want to I want
[42:10] to be a plus I want a game Hallelujah
[42:14] and the only way you gain the only way
[42:17] the only inescapable way is application
[42:22] you must apply the word of God knowing
[42:25] is half the battle but knowing is half
[42:28] the battle
[42:30] amen
[42:31] the other side is always application
[42:35] interestingly when we come to this
[42:38] statement in our scripture
[42:40] and and so by the help of God today I
[42:42] have two great burdens of introspection
[42:44] I probably will only get to one of them
[42:46] today and we'll have to save the other
[42:48] one for next time the Lord willing
[42:52] it's interesting because that when you
[42:56] see this term and I saw another Mighty
[42:59] angel
[43:02] all right so this term another now
[43:05] ironically
[43:07] I I when you read the theological
[43:12] um what will we call it the you know the
[43:15] the the the agreed upon standard among
[43:18] theologians who read this passage that
[43:21] you read today
[43:22] and you see that it says another Mighty
[43:26] Angel and so we realize that that the
[43:32] we find that that their their problem
[43:35] this great debate is over the identity
[43:38] of this angel
[43:39] because you know some insist that it's
[43:43] Christ
[43:44] all right and and and there's a lot of
[43:47] good reasons for that and even the
[43:48] theologians admit that but in spite of
[43:51] all the evidence and there there's a
[43:53] litany I could go down the bullet list
[43:54] today I'm trying to save time but just
[43:57] by the description alone you can see
[43:59] that it's Christ but in spite of all
[44:00] this evidence
[44:01] the theologians remain unconvinced
[44:05] of something you so freely accept
[44:09] they remain by and large unconvinced
[44:11] you'll find the ones here and there who
[44:13] suggest it could be but overwhelmingly
[44:16] they remain unconvinced because and it
[44:19] all goes back to a Greek word because
[44:21] the the Greek word for another I saw
[44:24] another Mighty Angel one meaning another
[44:28] of the same kind and the second meaning
[44:31] another of a different kind so if this
[44:34] Angel were Jesus one Theologian
[44:37] postulates if this Angel were Jesus
[44:40] Christ he would certainly expect to find
[44:42] the second term used for he would be an
[44:46] angel vastly different from this one
[44:48] blowing trumpets or any other angel in
[44:50] this book for that matter so so it so
[44:54] they would expect that if it's Jesus it
[44:57] would have to say an angel of a
[44:58] different kind
[45:00] but the but the reason they remain
[45:02] unconvinced that it's Christ is because
[45:04] it uses the Greek word of the same kind
[45:07] another Angel of the same kind
[45:10] all right and so so he says here he
[45:13] concludes that that he is the uncreated
[45:16] Eternal existing Son of God yet John
[45:18] uses the word that means another of the
[45:21] same kind so this ain't this is an angel
[45:24] not Jesus Christ
[45:27] and when I started reading that I just
[45:29] sit back in my chair and I just thought
[45:31] my goodness what great things God has
[45:34] opened up to us
[45:35] but here I went and I told my wife I
[45:37] said here I am with no formal training
[45:40] in theology all my training is auto
[45:42] didactic from a child just studying it
[45:44] myself with no certifications and yet
[45:47] these men have committed their whole
[45:48] lives to years and years and years yes
[45:51] and yes
[45:55] and yet here I am and I have a better
[45:58] understanding
[45:59] than they have because this is this is
[46:02] this is the exact misunderstanding that
[46:06] you would have when the mystery of the
[46:08] godhead is not clear to you
[46:12] so so now
[46:15] you've got to get your mind wrapped
[46:17] around the fact today that understanding
[46:19] the godhead is not just is he one two or
[46:22] three
[46:24] because every one of those human
[46:26] interpretations is an error
[46:29] see so he's not one like the Oneness
[46:33] he's not three like the trinitarians
[46:35] he's not two like two Lords
[46:37] see but but we do find out that the
[46:40] mystery is in expression because God has
[46:43] expressed himself and therefore his word
[46:46] and he are the same thing this is just
[46:48] another expression of the same Eternal
[46:52] God
[46:53] see so Jesus was just another expression
[46:56] this Angel this this is this is the
[46:59] beauty of you understanding The Mystery
[47:02] of the godhead because
[47:03] to really understand what the seventh
[47:06] seal revealed is in the godhead you're
[47:09] part of it
[47:11] [Music]
[47:12] so now it's not one two or three it's a
[47:15] whole church full it's a whole nation
[47:17] full it's a whole world full
[47:21] this is Christ in you the hope of glory
[47:25] this is the great mystery that they miss
[47:27] out on
[47:30] they haven't understood it since the
[47:32] days of irenaeus brother Branham said
[47:34] that second messenger was the last one
[47:36] to have a clear understanding of the
[47:38] godhead
[47:39] and it wasn't restored until our day
[47:41] when it was prophesied to be so now so
[47:44] now when we look at the godhead and we
[47:46] see the Plan of Redemption just remember
[47:48] it's you say it's all about him well she
[47:51] is him and he is her and it's all one
[47:55] expression of God expressing itself down
[47:58] through age that's why everybody in the
[48:00] Bible
[48:01] is all expressing one goal that God had
[48:04] in his mind before the foundation of the
[48:06] world oh my no wonder it changes Our
[48:10] Lives because when we hear it are there
[48:12] something inside of me that starts
[48:14] lining up to it and there wasn't enough
[48:17] sin in this flesh to stop that from
[48:19] happening
[48:22] there's no birth no raising no culture
[48:26] no mistakes no failures not enough
[48:29] devils in hell just stop the Inner Man
[48:32] from saying Amen to every word
[48:40] the true God is known in expression
[48:45] I mean this is why Jesus could come in
[48:47] Saint John 14 and in the 17th verse
[48:51] speaking of the spirit of Truth
[48:53] he says for he dwelleth with you
[48:59] he's standing there looking at him
[49:01] the spirit of oh Lord we need the spirit
[49:03] of Truth yeah he's right here
[49:06] where's he at he's dwelling with you
[49:08] where
[49:10] hello
[49:11] he's right here
[49:13] you know he he holds up a coin and he
[49:16] says whose image and superscription is
[49:18] this
[49:19] and they said oh that's Caesar so here
[49:21] they could see the image of Caesar and
[49:23] they couldn't see the image of God
[49:25] looking right at him
[49:28] so he says this the spirit of Truth for
[49:30] he dwelleth with you
[49:32] and
[49:34] shall be in you he comes down to the
[49:36] 18th verse I will not leave you
[49:38] comfortless I will come to you verse 20.
[49:41] at that day you shall know that I am in
[49:44] my father and ye in me and I in you
[49:49] then he goes on three verses later if a
[49:53] man loved me he will keep my words and
[49:55] my father will love him and we will come
[49:58] unto him and make our Abode with him
[50:01] this is all about the family friends
[50:04] this is all about God expressing himself
[50:08] that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[50:11] it's Christ Living Through you and you
[50:14] buy a new birth experience
[50:18] so a sad misunderstanding of the church
[50:22] is a beautiful reality for the followers
[50:24] of The Last Day message
[50:26] and that reality is that of course this
[50:29] angel
[50:30] of course this Angel would be another
[50:33] of the same kind because it's the same
[50:36] God that John saw in chapter one seated
[50:40] on the throne it's the same one Daniel
[50:43] saw as the Ancient of Days it's the same
[50:46] one living in and through a bride making
[50:49] her part of God's godhead
[50:51] [Applause]
[50:53] this is why
[50:55] he descended in a cloud
[50:59] that we read in in 10 verse chapter 10
[51:02] verse 1.
[51:04] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[51:06] from heaven clothed with a cloud
[51:08] see this is a living Cloud this you find
[51:11] these references give me uh Matt give me
[51:14] um or whoever's running there give me
[51:16] Leviticus 16 2. let's look at three a
[51:19] few places
[51:22] Leviticus 16 2 and the Lord said unto
[51:24] Moses
[51:26] speak unto Aaron thy brother that he
[51:29] come not at all times in the Holy place
[51:30] within the veil before the mercy seat
[51:32] which is upon the ark that he die not
[51:37] look at it for I will appear in the
[51:41] cloud upon The Mercy Seat
[51:45] Daniel chapter 7.
[51:47] all right Daniel chapter 7 verses 13 and
[51:50] 14.
[51:51] I saw in the night visions and behold
[51:54] one like the son of man came with the
[51:57] Clouds Of Heaven look at this these are
[51:59] living clouds
[52:01] I saw in the night visions and behold
[52:03] one like the son of man came with clouds
[52:05] of heaven and came to the Ancient of
[52:07] Days and they brought him near before
[52:09] him and there was given him dominion and
[52:12] glory in a kingdom that all people
[52:13] Nations it's not hard to tell who this
[52:15] is talking about
[52:16] and that all people Nations and
[52:19] languages should serve him his Dominion
[52:21] is an everlasting Dominion which shall
[52:24] not pass away look at it and his kingdom
[52:27] that which shall not be destroyed his
[52:30] kingdom you don't have a kingdom unless
[52:32] you've got subjects Hallelujah this is
[52:35] the ever increasing Kingdom of our Lord
[52:39] and of his Christ the kingdoms of this
[52:41] Earth have become the kingdoms of our
[52:43] Lord and of his Christ not to Lords but
[52:47] Christ and his entire family since
[52:50] Genesis to now
[52:55] from Genesis to revelation
[52:58] that's the kingdom friends that will
[53:01] never know an end
[53:04] if you're looking to live forever you
[53:07] need to be a part of that Kingdom
[53:13] Hebrews 12.
[53:15] here's another one Hebrews 12 verse 1.
[53:18] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[53:22] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[53:25] let us lay aside every wait and see now
[53:28] look at thee look at the responsibility
[53:31] you take on
[53:32] when you realize that the mighty Angel
[53:34] descended clothed with a cloud
[53:37] because you're looking at Christ
[53:39] identified in his body that's the whole
[53:41] that's the whole descending purpose he
[53:44] doesn't descend to give you more
[53:45] knowledge he descended down to become
[53:48] you and you become him
[53:50] and that's the hour we have arrived at
[53:54] because that's true
[53:56] then let us lay aside every weight
[54:00] and the sin which doth so easily beset
[54:03] us
[54:04] and let us run with patience the race
[54:07] that is set before us
[54:10] so it's an admonition
[54:12] if you would do it automatically Paul
[54:14] wouldn't have needed to say it
[54:17] this is a
[54:18] this is a
[54:20] a kick in the pants as they say to to
[54:23] bust up complacency
[54:26] this is this is an inoculation against
[54:28] the laodicea and flu
[54:31] I'm here to tell you covet is a is a is
[54:33] a kindergarten compared to the laodicea
[54:36] flu
[54:37] this is under the seventh file that got
[54:39] released on the men's minds and it's
[54:41] driving insanity
[54:43] of the world
[54:46] but there's a cure
[54:48] there's a remedy there's an inoculation
[54:52] Hallelujah let us lay aside every weight
[54:55] since he came in a cloud since that
[54:57] represents a family since you're part of
[54:59] that family then let us lay aside every
[55:01] weight in the Sin which doth so easily
[55:04] beset us people choose it or they don't
[55:07] people that believe the message of the
[55:10] hour not no kidding they don't have they
[55:12] don't fake believe it they really do
[55:14] still don't lay aside every weight
[55:19] you're talking about a travesty
[55:21] uh you're talking about an injustice
[55:24] against God
[55:26] to have come down and descended down in
[55:29] his Living Word and brought you into it
[55:32] and pulled you into the mystery and made
[55:34] you a part of the mystery and now this
[55:36] one this mystery that wanted to have
[55:38] fellowship with you all along the
[55:40] mystery was never Doctrine the mystery
[55:42] wanted Fellowship
[55:44] oh my and to have that happen to you and
[55:48] you're uh you're a fraction of a
[55:50] fraction of a fraction of humanity and
[55:52] then you won't lay aside every wait and
[55:55] sin
[55:56] that beset you and run don't walk Skip
[56:00] Hop run
[56:05] the race that is set before us
[56:09] it's sad
[56:11] it's what you want to talk about what
[56:13] what takes sleep and what takes my sleep
[56:15] away at night
[56:16] it's people who I know love God and
[56:18] believe this word but won't do that
[56:22] won't do that
[56:26] don't let me don't let me get
[56:28] sidetracked
[56:31] so it all
[56:39] symbol
[56:40] he had a rainbow about his head that
[56:41] means a covenant brother I'm saying it's
[56:43] a covenant angel and a prophet would go
[56:45] right to the Chinese laundromen
[56:47] and he said you go in there you write
[56:49] your name on a piece of paper and he
[56:51] rips it right down where you wrote and
[56:54] then he holds the upper half with the
[56:56] upper half of your name and you've got
[56:57] the bottom half with your name and when
[57:00] you bring them back you can't just match
[57:01] the paper the letters have to match if
[57:04] you've got to you the same Jesus in the
[57:07] beginning has to be the same Jesus in
[57:09] the end it can't change Hallelujah the
[57:13] idea he's a covenant he's coming down
[57:15] with the upper half you've got the lower
[57:17] half
[57:19] Hallelujah you're the parties coming
[57:21] down to to match that Mr Jesus and Mrs
[57:25] Jesus are the same Hallelujah
[57:33] his feet
[57:35] are the same pillars of fire because
[57:37] because it's God divided into his family
[57:40] now he didn't say his feet were the
[57:43] what's the pillar of Fire
[57:46] he said it was pillars because in the
[57:49] upper room at in the upper room in
[57:52] Jerusalem he divided himself into his
[57:55] church and pillars of fire clothing
[57:58] tongues of fire rested upon all of those
[58:01] Hallelujah
[58:03] so it that you understand when you read
[58:05] Revelation 10 1 we you understand that
[58:09] this is this is you're looking at the
[58:11] imagery of God coming as a kingdom a
[58:15] kingdom of saints Christ and his bride
[58:22] his body the true church the bride of
[58:24] Christ no wonder
[58:26] no wonder it didn't say in the Greek
[58:29] another of a different kind because she
[58:31] is him
[58:33] she's the same as him Hebrews 13 8 shows
[58:36] us that that's how she's the same as him
[58:39] she's not literally him she's the same
[58:41] as him she's life of his life word of
[58:44] his word see that's expression so so my
[58:48] children are the expression of me
[58:49] they're bone of my bones sell of my cell
[58:52] see so so when he appears here in
[58:55] Revelation 10 1 he comes not as the nail
[58:57] scarred man not seen in the earth until
[59:00] revelation 19.
[59:02] see
[59:04] he doesn't come as the nail scarred man
[59:06] that the world is looking for they
[59:07] finally see that in Revelation 19 but
[59:09] here in Revelation 10 he comes in the
[59:13] form of his word
[59:14] and by his Spirit he's invisibly United
[59:18] as one in his bride on the earth at the
[59:21] end time that's prophecy
[59:23] so what's happened to us isn't something
[59:26] we made up
[59:27] it's not something William Branham
[59:29] invented this is just God sending a
[59:32] messenger with the prophecy to say Now's
[59:34] the Time this is going to happen
[59:40] it's an invisible Union
[59:43] it's invisible to the unregenerate world
[59:47] to theologians he's an impenetrable
[59:49] mystery
[59:51] they only see him as the nail scarred
[59:53] Nazarene
[59:55] now it's not an invisible display I want
[59:58] to make that clear it's not in it you're
[1:00:00] supposed to have it on display you
[1:00:03] understand let this mind which was in
[1:00:05] Christ be in you let it work for you see
[1:00:08] last we'd already read lay aside every
[1:00:10] weight and sin that keeps you from
[1:00:12] displaying it
[1:00:14] because it's not supposed to be an
[1:00:16] invisible display
[1:00:18] see it's it's not an invisible uh
[1:00:21] display but an invisible understanding
[1:00:23] of how it works that's what the world
[1:00:26] don't understand how how do we see the
[1:00:30] word uh needed for a Rapture beyond the
[1:00:34] the saved Christians unwise virgins
[1:00:37] saved Christian saints Saints righteous
[1:00:41] how how is it that we see the word
[1:00:44] needed for a Rapture Beyond those saved
[1:00:47] Christians who miss it
[1:00:50] and end up in a tribulation period
[1:00:55] there is only one viable answer
[1:00:59] the gene of God and election
[1:01:05] they don't see
[1:01:07] The Mystery of the Mighty God unveiled
[1:01:09] multiplied
[1:01:11] in the form of his family
[1:01:14] they don't they they they
[1:01:16] you know we we become more even more of
[1:01:18] an oddball
[1:01:20] how do we
[1:01:21] how why are we going so much further
[1:01:24] away from being politically correct
[1:01:28] and every day we get further away from
[1:01:30] it
[1:01:32] I I'm just I'm just wanna I just want to
[1:01:34] remind the world I I he doesn't change I
[1:01:36] don't change his word don't change if if
[1:01:39] there's distance coming between me and
[1:01:40] the world it's because the world's
[1:01:42] backsliding and I ain't going
[1:01:44] I ain't going
[1:01:46] I'm moving on up Hallelujah
[1:01:49] going up higher I'm not even looking I
[1:01:51] don't this world is not my home I'm it
[1:01:54] will be but it's not my home now
[1:01:56] Hallelujah
[1:02:00] so the word made flesh in the Earth
[1:02:03] again this is the mystery of the son of
[1:02:06] man this is the final voice to the final
[1:02:07] age in fact the only version of Jesus
[1:02:10] the world will see before the end
[1:02:14] they look to see him
[1:02:16] they won't
[1:02:17] this is the bride form of his word made
[1:02:21] flesh invisibly United to Christ
[1:02:24] she the same as him is the only form of
[1:02:27] Christ they will see before it's too
[1:02:29] late
[1:02:31] so and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[1:02:34] down from heaven clothed with a cloud a
[1:02:36] rainbow was about his head his face was
[1:02:37] as it were the Sun how beautiful
[1:02:39] his face was as it were the Sun
[1:02:43] now watch this because
[1:02:45] brother Brandon reminds us how that they
[1:02:47] had to put a veil
[1:02:49] over the face of Moses
[1:02:51] because they couldn't the the glory was
[1:02:54] just too much they couldn't gaze at it
[1:02:56] see
[1:02:57] and so and and then Jesus when when
[1:03:00] Jesus was transfigured he he glistened
[1:03:03] he was transfigured right before them
[1:03:05] and his his whole his whole body looked
[1:03:07] like the blazing sun
[1:03:10] so it shouldn't surprise us when Moses
[1:03:14] was like that and Jesus was like that
[1:03:16] and I say to you that he descended down
[1:03:19] in the image of it of Christ and his
[1:03:21] family united it shouldn't surprise you
[1:03:23] that his face is as it were the son no
[1:03:26] more than pillars of fire or clothed in
[1:03:28] a cloud or have a rainbow about his head
[1:03:30] my so it's all like the other notable
[1:03:34] descriptions it's all God manifesting in
[1:03:37] his family
[1:03:42] clicking along faster than I'd expected
[1:03:45] so maybe we'll we will get to
[1:03:48] we'll see
[1:03:52] now
[1:03:54] I want to approach
[1:03:57] you know my my first burden
[1:04:01] brother Branham says in the message a
[1:04:03] hidden life I love that sermon
[1:04:07] he said in a voice
[1:04:09] out of a cloud said
[1:04:12] this is my beloved Son hear you him
[1:04:16] set him upon a mountain put the witness
[1:04:18] there to see witness is there to see it
[1:04:21] remember Peter James and John
[1:04:23] witnesses there to see it
[1:04:26] clothed him in a robe
[1:04:28] as bright as the sun shining
[1:04:32] they even Shine Like the Sun in its
[1:04:34] strength
[1:04:38] and God spoke out
[1:04:40] and said this is my beloved Son
[1:04:43] hear you him
[1:04:46] now
[1:04:48] this is going to turn a corner
[1:04:50] and it's going to hit you square between
[1:04:52] the eyes
[1:04:55] this is about adoption
[1:04:57] of the whole this you're looking at the
[1:05:00] process for adopting the whole family
[1:05:03] this is what's going to this is the same
[1:05:06] process
[1:05:07] that you're going to have to go through
[1:05:10] and to to operate the prophecy that God
[1:05:13] has for you to operate
[1:05:16] so he says this is my beloved Son
[1:05:18] hearing him sat upon a mountain put the
[1:05:19] witnesses there to see it clothe him
[1:05:21] with a robe as bright as the sun shining
[1:05:23] they even Shine Like the Sun in its
[1:05:25] strength God spoke out this is my
[1:05:27] beloved Son hear ye him
[1:05:29] God adopted his own child into the
[1:05:32] family hear me no longer but this is my
[1:05:35] son who takes over from here
[1:05:39] One play because when he come to the
[1:05:41] water he didn't say that he said my
[1:05:44] beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[1:05:45] and that was it it's all he said
[1:05:47] but now Jesus has went to the Wilderness
[1:05:49] and he's overcome The Temptations of the
[1:05:51] enemy now he's come out and I started in
[1:05:53] his ministry now he's proving himself
[1:05:55] faithful now you know what he's done
[1:05:57] he's been willing to lay aside
[1:05:59] the weights and sins of the world
[1:06:02] pressing upon him say but he wasn't born
[1:06:04] in sin right but in every way he was
[1:06:06] tempted just like you and me
[1:06:08] but he would steal away in prayer he
[1:06:10] would talk to the father he spent his
[1:06:12] life in Dedication that made him an
[1:06:14] overcomer
[1:06:16] and now he comes up on the mountain of
[1:06:19] transfiguration and the voice repeats
[1:06:21] this is my beloved Son he's never going
[1:06:24] to be disqualified and neither will you
[1:06:25] be disqualified Hallelujah says the same
[1:06:28] thing this might beloved Son but now he
[1:06:30] adds an addendum hear ye him this is
[1:06:35] adoption
[1:06:37] why'd you say that's pretty strong watch
[1:06:39] what he says God adopted his own child
[1:06:42] in the family hear me no longer but this
[1:06:44] is my son who takes over from here
[1:06:45] brother Brandon said in another place I
[1:06:48] think it was uh the uh the statue of
[1:06:50] perfect man he said in other words God
[1:06:52] said I will sit down now his words are
[1:06:55] spirit and life
[1:06:57] so he adopted his child into his own
[1:06:59] family hear me no longer but this is my
[1:07:01] son who takes over from here amen
[1:07:04] that adoption is near the time in
[1:07:07] parable of the church it's time for that
[1:07:14] so now he brought it right around you're
[1:07:16] standing here like like Peter James and
[1:07:18] John and you're looking at all this and
[1:07:20] suddenly the word turns and says but now
[1:07:22] that time is on you
[1:07:27] now you're the one going to go forward
[1:07:29] with my word you're going to be the one
[1:07:32] who now lays aside every weight and sin
[1:07:35] you're going to be the one who lets the
[1:07:37] mind which was in Christ be in you
[1:07:40] the adoption is near the time and
[1:07:43] parable of the church it's time for that
[1:07:47] he says in the message Shalom speaking
[1:07:49] of the darkness on the last age
[1:07:53] when we see Darkness
[1:07:55] settling
[1:07:58] and boy
[1:08:00] 1964 wood to God we could have that
[1:08:02] kindergarten day again
[1:08:05] as far as darkness is concerned
[1:08:08] I appreciate all the advances like
[1:08:10] anybody but boy I sure don't appreciate
[1:08:12] the overspreading of abomination
[1:08:15] I sure don't appreciate the darkness
[1:08:17] that's times a thousand
[1:08:19] see
[1:08:21] when we see the darkness settling
[1:08:23] Darkness just before day
[1:08:27] we know this is so I'm so glad we know
[1:08:30] that the morning star is hanging Yonder
[1:08:32] to introduce the coming Sun so this was
[1:08:35] God's remedy to the darkness the
[1:08:37] burgeoning darkness what's the ministry
[1:08:39] of the day star
[1:08:41] you understand the ministry God was
[1:08:43] saying I'm going to send you I'm going
[1:08:46] to have you here in an impossible time
[1:08:50] I'm even gonna finish up with my Prophet
[1:08:52] I'm going to take him home and you're
[1:08:54] going to go all the way to 77 and Beyond
[1:08:57] a time so dark a prophet couldn't even
[1:09:00] see and thought nobody could survive it
[1:09:02] you're going to go to 87 and 97 and 07
[1:09:05] and 17 and here we are today coming to
[1:09:07] the end of 22. and it's more it's it's
[1:09:10] so in dark it's impossibly dark it's
[1:09:12] impossibly dark but here's the ministry
[1:09:15] of the Morning Star
[1:09:16] to do what it's you're you're you're
[1:09:18] you're the final voice to the final age
[1:09:24] because it's it's that's when the
[1:09:26] Morning Star shines
[1:09:29] bad news
[1:09:31] it had to be this evil for you to shine
[1:09:36] and the way this worked the way the
[1:09:38] Machinery works this thing's geared is
[1:09:40] it's got to get worse and worse for you
[1:09:42] to get brighter and brighter
[1:09:44] [Music]
[1:09:46] say Lord I want to run there's nowhere
[1:09:48] to run
[1:09:49] as I've said to you before there's no
[1:09:51] way out but up
[1:09:53] Hallelujah
[1:09:54] there's no way out but up you might as
[1:09:56] well fight
[1:09:57] you might as well buckle down you might
[1:09:59] as well take it seriously because you
[1:10:01] ain't getting out of here
[1:10:03] Hallelujah
[1:10:07] it's going it's the going in between
[1:10:11] so you know I I don't want to take the
[1:10:14] time to
[1:10:15] to read about it or even I was going to
[1:10:17] put up the pictures but it would
[1:10:18] Sidetrack me and I'm not really
[1:10:19] preaching about that I I found a curious
[1:10:21] thing that never caught ever caught
[1:10:22] before and brother Brandon preached
[1:10:25] um modern events make clear
[1:10:27] by prophecy brother Branham really
[1:10:30] didn't talk about the politics and
[1:10:32] political you know there was times we
[1:10:34] talked about you know what's going on in
[1:10:36] in Khrushchev and Castro and Washington
[1:10:38] and Eisenhower and this one and that one
[1:10:41] in the Rome the Vatican and you know
[1:10:43] what's happening but but in in in this
[1:10:46] epic sermon
[1:10:48] modern events made clear in Prophecy one
[1:10:50] of his last sermons he says to that
[1:10:52] audience if I never see you again and he
[1:10:53] never would
[1:10:55] he's days away from going home
[1:10:58] and in there
[1:11:00] what he took up was
[1:11:02] the the religious World in Prophecy
[1:11:07] and he showed in the Bible everything
[1:11:10] that the modern Christian Church was to
[1:11:13] be and said now look out you see it
[1:11:15] right it's described
[1:11:18] it's all tables full of vomit it's
[1:11:19] Harlot daughters following a
[1:11:21] system that's scripture words not me
[1:11:23] don't don't don't cancel me
[1:11:28] I'm only quoting a scripture words
[1:11:31] she was a harlot she was a she had
[1:11:33] Harlot daughters
[1:11:34] and they meet under names of blasphemy
[1:11:38] see
[1:11:39] so so we so we find out then that
[1:11:43] that we come to this time and and so I'm
[1:11:46] not here to really talk about I don't
[1:11:49] really have to come up here and be a
[1:11:50] news reporter thank God I don't have to
[1:11:52] be a news reporter because you see the
[1:11:54] same filth that I see
[1:11:56] and I I was just looking at at two
[1:11:59] particular articles and I only use these
[1:12:02] two I could have used 200.
[1:12:04] because every day you open the news
[1:12:06] here's five more now you cannot believe
[1:12:10] it's happening
[1:12:12] and ten years ago only it would have
[1:12:14] been unthinkable
[1:12:17] one is
[1:12:19] a California Early Childhood teacher
[1:12:23] she's she's teaching preschoolers
[1:12:27] she teacher admits to using what she
[1:12:30] calls a gender unicorn
[1:12:32] to instruct three and four-year-olds
[1:12:35] on sexual attraction
[1:12:39] and the teachers union is supporting her
[1:12:46] I've said for years public schools are
[1:12:48] no place for a child of God and their
[1:12:51] children
[1:12:52] there's too many other alternatives
[1:12:56] that that are out there available to you
[1:13:01] three and four-year-olds she uses this
[1:13:03] gender unicorn and she's got I don't
[1:13:06] even want to describe it it's obscene
[1:13:10] it's vulgar nasty filthy
[1:13:14] and and her herself a transsexual a
[1:13:17] transgender
[1:13:18] who had the who had the the change
[1:13:22] you don't really change you just get
[1:13:24] surgery for nothing
[1:13:28] now this is what they're teaching
[1:13:31] how they're teaching preschoolers
[1:13:34] on sexual attractions so that they
[1:13:36] understand that if a little boy feels
[1:13:39] like he likes another little boy then at
[1:13:41] three and four years old he can get
[1:13:43] instructed how that he's probably
[1:13:44] homosexual
[1:13:46] and his parents can get counseling on
[1:13:48] how to nurture him
[1:13:51] you say brother Jason that is that makes
[1:13:54] me cringe yeah it does but it's here's
[1:13:57] here's the sad part I'm only reading you
[1:13:59] headlines
[1:14:00] I'm only reading you headlines
[1:14:02] the world has become so desensitized to
[1:14:06] this
[1:14:07] another young girl
[1:14:09] she says here's the headline my high
[1:14:13] school punished me and they did they
[1:14:15] suspended her and and wanted us make her
[1:14:18] go to counseling
[1:14:19] my high school punished me
[1:14:22] for saying male students shouldn't be
[1:14:27] allowed to watch me undress
[1:14:29] in my locker room
[1:14:32] she's 14.
[1:14:34] and there's boys who woke up on Monday
[1:14:37] and said I think I'm a girl and now they
[1:14:39] get to go in to the locker rooms of the
[1:14:42] girls at 14.
[1:14:44] send your kids to those hell holes if
[1:14:46] you want but I'm gonna tell you what it
[1:14:48] is it is one of the most highest forms
[1:14:50] of child abuse known to God in man
[1:14:52] [Music]
[1:14:56] now I'm so grossed out I want to move on
[1:15:00] I want to say this
[1:15:03] so now that's a modern event
[1:15:06] made clear in Prophecy
[1:15:09] this book said that would happen
[1:15:12] and it's happening
[1:15:16] I was sitting in a barber shop where
[1:15:18] I've been going for years and
[1:15:19] conversation come up and I just and and
[1:15:23] you know Jim he has great respect for me
[1:15:25] not as much as I'd like for him to have
[1:15:27] all the time but but he's he's got a
[1:15:31] good heart and I I don't hesitate to
[1:15:32] talk to him and witness to him and all
[1:15:33] it doesn't matter there's four or five
[1:15:35] guys in there I'll start talking about
[1:15:36] the Lord
[1:15:38] and they all they all know in the
[1:15:39] sheriff's department chaplain and the
[1:15:40] pastor and they so there's like okay the
[1:15:42] pastor's gonna start preaching and I do
[1:15:48] ain't for the conversation to come up
[1:15:49] about you know the craziness in the
[1:15:51] world and that's my little open door to
[1:15:53] say look there's not it doesn't matter
[1:15:55] nothing this name pick up a topic
[1:15:57] doesn't matter which one you want you
[1:15:59] want to talk about religion you want to
[1:16:00] talk about politics you want to talk
[1:16:01] about the environment you want to talk
[1:16:03] about science and education technology

[1:16:10] threat monetary system doesn't matter I
[1:16:13] will take you in this book in this book
[1:16:15] and I will show you that everything
[1:16:16] you're questioning was supposed to be
[1:16:18] exactly what you see
[1:16:21] and just pick a topic any topic I don't
[1:16:23] care we can prove it
[1:16:28] God knew

[1:16:33] I'm here to tell you something friends
[1:16:34] as I was saying to you earlier you

[1:16:38] because nobody's getting out of here
[1:16:40] alive
[1:16:42] absolutely nobody those who are alive
[1:16:44] and remain to the coming of the Lord
[1:16:45] will have to actually be changed and a
[1:16:48] moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:16:51] and you know something that'll have to
[1:16:53] start with a spiritual death first
[1:16:57] nobody's getting out of here alive

[1:17:02] another
[1:17:04] I just say Lord God take my life and
[1:17:06] give me Jesus in the morning when I Rise
[1:17:09] Give Me Jesus Hallelujah
[1:17:13] [Applause]
[1:17:17] the Bible doesn't even say that Enoch
[1:17:19] Journey To Heaven it says he was found
[1:17:21] not because God translated him
[1:17:24] see
[1:17:25] God just took him
[1:17:27] he didn't walk off to Heaven God took
[1:17:29] him
[1:17:30] my but he had this testimony that he
[1:17:33] pleased God I just said take my life
[1:17:36] Lord may I be pleasing that's got
[1:17:39] friends everything I'm preaching today
[1:17:41] is that sentence take my life Lord that

[1:18:01] God burn in my heart oh God
[1:18:04] Hallelujah
[1:18:07] brother Adam goes on in Shalom It's
[1:18:09] always darkest just before just a few
[1:18:10] minutes before day the blackout comes
[1:18:12] the moon fails to shine The Darkest Day
[1:18:15] the darkest before day is because the
[1:18:17] light is pressing the darkness and that
[1:18:19] interesting
[1:18:20] we know that's true Hunters know that
[1:18:25] but the Morning Star comes out and says
[1:18:27] good morning

[1:18:45] good morning shalom
[1:18:48] arise shine
[1:18:50] for the light has come to you
[1:18:55] I love how a prophet
[1:18:57] amplifies that
[1:18:59] the light has come to you
[1:19:03] arise
[1:19:05] shine
[1:19:06] the light has come to you
[1:19:10] it could have went to anyone else it
[1:19:12] came to you
[1:19:14] say I don't feel worthy it came to you
[1:19:17] I don't know how this happened I neither
[1:19:19] do I but it came to me it came to you
[1:19:21] Hallelujah
[1:19:26] the light Vindicated again God's word
[1:19:28] soul that you can see God manifested in
[1:19:31] his promise of the light of the day
[1:19:33] that's why it did it it Vindicated light
[1:19:35] Vindicated again God's word so that you
[1:19:38] can see God manifested in his promise of
[1:19:41] the light of the day or the word given
[1:19:43] to the sage see these promises that's
[1:19:45] made for this day
[1:19:47] these promises that was said by the
[1:19:49] prophets and by Jesus himself
[1:19:51] in this day God and Sunday Times Hebrews
[1:19:53] one we all know it give me Hebrews
[1:19:55] chapter 1 G Hebrews chapter 1. and verse
[1:19:58] 1.
[1:20:00] this is very familiar reading to us God
[1:20:03] who at sundry times and in divers
[1:20:06] manners spake in times past unto the
[1:20:08] fathers by the prophets all right in
[1:20:11] other words God who at sundry times
[1:20:15] God who at different times the Holman
[1:20:17] reads it God who at different times at
[1:20:21] God's singular
[1:20:23] who at different times and in different
[1:20:26] ways
[1:20:27] spake in time past unto the fathers by
[1:20:31] the prophet so it doesn't matter if it
[1:20:33] was Jehovah talking to Abraham or Jesus
[1:20:36] talking to Matthew
[1:20:38] it didn't matter if it was if it was
[1:20:41] Christ talking to to to the devil in the
[1:20:45] wilderness or he's talking to Paul
[1:20:47] saying Paul Saul Saul why persecute us
[1:20:50] thou me
[1:20:51] and it's the same God when Paul says to
[1:20:54] you let this mind which was in Christ
[1:20:57] the one that's come in me now let it
[1:20:59] come in you it came from him it came to
[1:21:01] me now I'm giving it to you and that's
[1:21:03] what a prophet had happened to him in
[1:21:05] this day under a restoration
[1:21:10] the spiritual pattern is always in that
[1:21:12] kind of a promise see that that's that's
[1:21:15] really you're looking at in Hebrews 1 1
[1:21:17] you're looking at a pattern
[1:21:18] Dr zodiatis uses this word sundry
[1:21:21] meaning many parts
[1:21:23] God who in sundered times
[1:21:26] zodiati says it like this
[1:21:29] Sunday many parts
[1:21:32] incremental and Progressive manner in
[1:21:36] which God disclosed himself up until the
[1:21:40] appearance of the sun it was fragmentor
[1:21:43] fragmentary Peace by peace
[1:21:48] so the one God
[1:21:51] expressed himself through the Old
[1:21:54] Testament in incremental
[1:21:57] in a progressive manner
[1:21:59] all the way up until Jesus was the
[1:22:01] embodiment of all of the progressions
[1:22:04] of all of the increments
[1:22:07] now listen friends the beauty of that is
[1:22:10] there's not one not one in that Old
[1:22:14] Testament who lived their increment
[1:22:17] perfectly
[1:22:20] not one of them Abraham doubted ran off
[1:22:23] to Egypt backslid
[1:22:25] Moses got angry lost his temper and
[1:22:27] smoked Christ twice David lied killed
[1:22:30] and committed adultery
[1:22:32] I mean come on friends look at him don't
[1:22:34] let's not even talk about Solomon or
[1:22:36] Jacob
[1:22:37] my goodness but do you realize that when
[1:22:39] Jesus came the Fulfillment all those
[1:22:41] increments became perfected
[1:22:44] and when he arose there arose
[1:22:48] Hallelujah do you have that same hope
[1:22:50] for yourself coming up to the end time
[1:22:52] so I'm not might not be living my part
[1:22:55] out right but when he comes I'll be like
[1:22:58] him
[1:22:58] [Applause]
[1:23:00] Hallelujah
[1:23:07] so a prophet was sent in our day to
[1:23:08] gather up to do what to do what
[1:23:12] to repair
[1:23:14] all the many parts
[1:23:16] of the word
[1:23:18] that had been skewed
[1:23:20] that had been violated and
[1:23:23] fractured and splitting she shifted and
[1:23:26] torn and reversed and flipped
[1:23:29] all the parts of the of Christ what it
[1:23:33] meant for Christ to be living in you the
[1:23:37] hope of glory
[1:23:39] and for 2 000 years all the parts got
[1:23:43] skewed around by denominational ideas so
[1:23:46] so so so so down Through the Ages listen
[1:23:49] it wasn't it wasn't the scriptures that
[1:23:53] varied
[1:23:54] that was the interpretation varied in
[1:23:57] the lives of the church
[1:24:00] Luther saw to it swingly Knox Calvin a
[1:24:04] huss they saw to it that the word nobody
[1:24:06] could change the word they got a hold of
[1:24:09] it and and sometimes lost their life
[1:24:11] making sure you got an accurate Bible
[1:24:13] it was never the word that got skewed
[1:24:16] but not the scriptures but the
[1:24:18] interpretation of the scriptures in the
[1:24:21] lives of the people and that's what He
[1:24:24] restored a prophet came back to bring
[1:24:26] back the right interpretation
[1:24:29] and the only way that could happen is to
[1:24:32] unlock all the Mysteries and fix all of
[1:24:34] the doctrine and fix all of the
[1:24:35] teachings so that a bride could eat
[1:24:37] Thoroughbred food and become a
[1:24:39] thoroughbred bride
[1:24:41] Hallelujah
[1:24:46] their standards varied
[1:24:49] mostly backsliding
[1:24:51] in the church and that was from the top
[1:24:53] down
[1:24:55] and thus the power of God declined it
[1:24:58] had to
[1:24:59] so a great promise of God
[1:25:02] is that at the end time he would restore
[1:25:04] the original word
[1:25:07] to restore the original interpretation
[1:25:12] he would have
[1:25:14] ladies again
[1:25:17] and right in a time when coming up under
[1:25:21] the fifth trumpet they started to
[1:25:23] decline
[1:25:25] and and and and coming right into the
[1:25:27] turn of the century and the wolves are
[1:25:29] about to start and the the fifth Trump
[1:25:31] and the fifth vial and then it's gonna
[1:25:33] from there it's gonna go to the six to
[1:25:35] bring on World War II and the whole
[1:25:36] thing is is moving in Prophecy
[1:25:39] and and women come in in 1912 for the
[1:25:42] first time and start bobbing their hair
[1:25:45] it was never done in the Christian
[1:25:46] church
[1:25:48] women died because they wouldn't cut
[1:25:51] their hair
[1:25:53] and so and and the Bible says that that
[1:25:56] little scorpions came on the the lid was
[1:25:58] torn from hell and the and and and an
[1:26:01] angel descends from Heaven that that has
[1:26:03] the key to the bottomless pit and
[1:26:04] Brethren ties that right back to Isaiah
[1:26:06] 14 how are they fallen from Heaven oh
[1:26:09] Lucifer son of the morning
[1:26:10] so we can see who was given the key we
[1:26:13] can see who unlocked the bottomless pit
[1:26:15] and Satan is now given some more extra
[1:26:17] power to start bringing on the end time
[1:26:21] Hallelujah it says that they got stings
[1:26:25] and they'll torment the women they got
[1:26:27] long hair brother Brandon said like one
[1:26:30] preacher said to him he was looking at
[1:26:32] these long-haired boys
[1:26:34] and he and he said an old-time preacher
[1:26:36] old Pentecostal preacher where they
[1:26:38] really knew how boy ought to look and
[1:26:40] how a lady ought to look
[1:26:41] and he said an Old Timer stepped up to
[1:26:43] him and said brother Billy said he's got
[1:26:45] hair like women should have
[1:26:51] brother Branham we
[1:26:53] greatly appreciating that statement
[1:26:57] and said those scorpions came out had
[1:26:59] stings in the Tails and they tormented
[1:27:00] the women brother I'm said tormented
[1:27:02] they had hair long like a woman to
[1:27:05] torment the woman who had cut theirs off
[1:27:09] and that started in 1912 and World War
[1:27:11] one starts in 1914 and that's the first
[1:27:14] woe
[1:27:15] and that now you're in Revelation 7. now
[1:27:17] you've got an angel ascending out of the
[1:27:19] East with the Seal of the Living God
[1:27:20] that's Christ of course Holy Ghost is
[1:27:22] the only one that can give you the seal
[1:27:24] and he's saying hold up stop everything
[1:27:26] and they stop World War One mysteriously
[1:27:28] because I've got to seal the rest of my
[1:27:29] servants you can't run ahead this whole
[1:27:31] thing's got to run in sync the politics
[1:27:33] the religion the chaos the Blackness the
[1:27:36] message the messenger the people I've
[1:27:38] got to be able to separate it's got to
[1:27:39] go all down through history and I got to
[1:27:40] keep this thing in a rhythm this is like
[1:27:42] a symphony Hallelujah
[1:27:44] oh man there's going to be a people who
[1:27:47] March to the step of the Gospel
[1:27:52] and it tormented those women
[1:27:54] say how'd it torment them because in
[1:27:56] this two 24 months after they started
[1:27:57] bobbing their hair they're going to lose
[1:27:59] husbands and Sons by the Millions
[1:28:02] they're going to lose husbands and Sons
[1:28:04] it came to torment the women who cut
[1:28:08] theirs off
[1:28:11] and this message come to restore back
[1:28:13] what a real lady is
[1:28:15] and what a real man is and a real
[1:28:17] character is
[1:28:19] Hallelujah friends I'm not ashamed of
[1:28:21] this gospel it's the power of God under
[1:28:24] salvation and we stand for it here
[1:28:27] hallelujah you you you men young and old
[1:28:30] and everything in between don't walk
[1:28:32] around with worldly kind of hairstyles
[1:28:34] look like a decent Son of God
[1:28:37] and you sisters let your hair grow stop
[1:28:40] cutting it off it's your glory God gave
[1:28:42] it to you stop chasing after the
[1:28:44] Fashions of this world it's going to Ash
[1:28:47] and send her
[1:28:48] this is not your destiny me your destiny
[1:28:51] is to ascend
[1:28:53] Hallelujah
[1:28:59] and I started putting on garments that
[1:29:01] pertained to a man and Men started
[1:29:03] carousing and smoking and cursing and
[1:29:05] drinking socially and brother Branham
[1:29:08] was pleading with those Pentecostals he
[1:29:10] said your Founders never did that they
[1:29:13] never they never lived Bosworth never
[1:29:15] did that that Wigglesworth never did
[1:29:17] that Arthur pink never did that these
[1:29:19] people stood for holiness
[1:29:25] and Pentecost had two options
[1:29:27] they had two options
[1:29:29] either be restored or kick him out
[1:29:33] [Music]
[1:29:35] I don't think I need to tell you which
[1:29:36] one they chose
[1:29:40] see this was a restoration
[1:29:43] of the Living Word
[1:29:46] and and it was going to be alive and
[1:29:48] living in Saints with the same power the
[1:29:50] same signs the same overcoming life this
[1:29:53] this is what would restore shalom
[1:29:57] this is what will give you the peace
[1:29:59] that passes understanding is when you
[1:30:02] allow the word of God to dwell in you
[1:30:04] richly
[1:30:06] you want peace
[1:30:08] you want Shalom let the word dwell in
[1:30:12] you richly let it permit it allow it
[1:30:16] God won't force it on you
[1:30:19] see
[1:30:21] it would bring a this this this much
[1:30:24] this restoration of God's family into
[1:30:27] his very image
[1:30:29] that that it was so much in His image
[1:30:32] that a prophet would actually call it
[1:30:34] the bright coming of Christ
[1:30:36] boy that's a mouthful
[1:30:39] it would bring a whole new understanding
[1:30:41] of what the Rapture would even be and
[1:30:44] how it would unfold in stages
[1:30:47] only culminating
[1:30:49] in the Saints resurrecting and bodies
[1:30:52] being changed
[1:30:54] the beautiful secret of the Rapture that
[1:30:56] everybody's waiting for that's only the
[1:30:58] last phase that's the finishing move the
[1:31:01] Rapture gathered a pride it's already on
[1:31:03] right now
[1:31:05] Hallelujah
[1:31:08] this end time word came to do what to
[1:31:11] totally finish and complete Redemption
[1:31:13] for the Gentile Church before they see
[1:31:15] him in Revelation 19 when it's too late
[1:31:21] now
[1:31:24] let me carry on with my theme I'm gonna
[1:31:25] I'm out of time I'm gonna take five or
[1:31:27] seven more minutes
[1:31:32] because as I said to you we
[1:31:36] you know I'm not here today
[1:31:38] just to wow you with theology
[1:31:42] you know we we of course we have some
[1:31:45] new ones here you know Sister Evelyn has
[1:31:48] been so journeying with us for a while
[1:31:49] uh we've had brother Chris St John
[1:31:51] coming back and he's got a lot of
[1:31:52] questions and and and we've got and
[1:31:55] we've got our growing youth who are
[1:31:56] growing who need to know these things
[1:31:58] who need to know these things
[1:32:01] come on let me tell you something
[1:32:02] parents I'm going to need your help for
[1:32:04] sure
[1:32:05] I can't teach them everything they get
[1:32:07] coming here for an hour and a half to
[1:32:09] hear me waving scream and jump
[1:32:11] I'm gonna need your help and it ain't
[1:32:13] gonna do you much good to say it if
[1:32:15] you're not living it
[1:32:20] not to mention we have an internet
[1:32:22] audience and that's our Outreach
[1:32:24] but but but but but that's so that's not
[1:32:27] really my theme today I'm not really
[1:32:28] here I'm only laying foundation for my
[1:32:32] theme but I'm kind of already on it but
[1:32:34] all of the different correlations in
[1:32:36] scripture these are things you know they
[1:32:38] were well taught in these things we
[1:32:40] Rejoice over them
[1:32:42] but as brother Branham said this is the
[1:32:44] cut the time of adoption where this is
[1:32:46] this parable's now got to be in you
[1:32:48] see
[1:32:50] and this is my real first burden of the
[1:32:53] word today brother Branham says here in
[1:32:54] the Patmos vision
[1:32:56] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:32:58] Among Us now the words made flesh in his
[1:33:01] church
[1:33:02] dwelling Among Us
[1:33:04] his angels in his hand ministering God
[1:33:07] you hear me
[1:33:09] God is depending upon his church
[1:33:13] God is relying on us of this age to
[1:33:17] bring this Gospel Light to a dying
[1:33:20] heathen-bound traditional World God is
[1:33:24] laying the burden on me and you
[1:33:28] all I can do is accept for me will you
[1:33:33] accept for you
[1:33:35] how many are here today who will say
[1:33:37] count me in I will take up that burden
[1:33:46] joette says
[1:33:48] Judd makes this statement brilliant
[1:33:50] statement
[1:33:52] he says evil now listen I'm going to
[1:33:55] read you this and I'm going to make a
[1:33:56] few comments and we're going to hit
[1:33:57] pause and I'll finish it next time
[1:34:00] still got you
[1:34:02] yeah it didn't take off and go to
[1:34:03] Walmart on me or anything did you you
[1:34:05] still here
[1:34:07] all right
[1:34:10] evil
[1:34:12] never
[1:34:13] surrenders its hold without a sore fight
[1:34:22] with that soak
[1:34:25] this is a managed thinker brilliant
[1:34:28] brother
[1:34:29] evil here's his years of experience in
[1:34:32] busting heads with devils
[1:34:35] evil never surrenders it's hold without
[1:34:37] a sore fight this is a Warrior come back
[1:34:39] from the battlefield to tell you this
[1:34:42] we never pass
[1:34:44] into any spiritual inheritance
[1:34:47] through the delightful exercises of a
[1:34:49] picnic
[1:34:52] but always not most of the time joette
[1:34:54] says but always
[1:34:57] through the Grim contentions of the
[1:35:00] battlefield
[1:35:03] it is no secret
[1:35:05] it is so
[1:35:07] it is so in the secret Realm of the Soul
[1:35:11] every faculty which wins its spiritual
[1:35:16] freedom I got a bunch of those that I
[1:35:18] need to win spiritual freedom
[1:35:22] oh brother Caleb was talking about you
[1:35:24] know your memory your re or Matthew
[1:35:26] memory reason affection conscious
[1:35:28] imagination your sight your your your
[1:35:31] your your your smell your touch your
[1:35:33] taste your hearing all of these things
[1:35:35] that make up your flesh those ten inlets
[1:35:37] and Outlets
[1:35:39] that's how Satan finds access to you and
[1:35:41] poisons you
[1:35:43] see
[1:35:46] so he says
[1:35:47] this is how the secret Realm of the Soul
[1:35:49] every faculty which wins its spiritual
[1:35:52] Freedom you want to win
[1:35:55] every every faculty which wins its
[1:35:58] spiritual Freedom does so at the price
[1:35:59] of blood
[1:36:02] a pollyon
[1:36:03] it's not put to flight by a courteous
[1:36:05] request
[1:36:07] I thought preach brother oh my goodness
[1:36:11] apollyon is
[1:36:13] by a courteous request he straddles
[1:36:15] across
[1:36:16] a crawl breath of the way
[1:36:18] the way forward
[1:36:19] and our progress has to be registered in
[1:36:24] Blood and Tears this we must remember
[1:36:28] everybody say must
[1:36:30] this we must remember or we shall add to
[1:36:35] all the other burdens of life as if we
[1:36:37] don't already have a bunch
[1:36:39] we shall add to all the other burdens of
[1:36:41] Life the gall of misinterpretation
[1:36:44] we are not born again into soft and
[1:36:48] protected nurseries but in the open
[1:36:51] country where we suck strength from the
[1:36:53] very Terror of the Tempest
[1:36:55] we must through much tribulation enter
[1:36:59] into the kingdom of God
[1:37:03] that brother has summed up the great
[1:37:05] burden of my life
[1:37:07] and the burden that I have in this
[1:37:09] thought
[1:37:11] I thought to myself when I read that I
[1:37:13] thought what great servant of God
[1:37:15] now you just come with me I'm winding
[1:37:18] down all right
[1:37:20] I'm probably finished screaming
[1:37:25] what great servant ask yourself with me
[1:37:29] what great servant of God was ever able
[1:37:31] to do exploits and the power of the Holy
[1:37:35] Ghost who did not first reach that event
[1:37:39] through the rigors required for a
[1:37:42] spiritual life
[1:37:44] and operational
[1:37:46] power
[1:37:48] I'm tired of reading about power I want
[1:37:51] operational power I will operational
[1:37:55] status
[1:37:56] Hallelujah the people of the last day
[1:38:00] who know their God will do great
[1:38:02] exploits I'm not interested in just
[1:38:05] hearing about power I want operational
[1:38:07] status
[1:38:08] Hallelujah
[1:38:11] not one of them you could name in the
[1:38:13] Bible achieve that
[1:38:15] did Jesus
[1:38:18] no one suffered like him did any of the
[1:38:20] Apostles Daddy You Know listen let's
[1:38:22] talk about the big boys Peter James John
[1:38:24] Saint Paul
[1:38:26] do you think they achieved operational
[1:38:29] power do you think they achieved
[1:38:31] overcoming because they went to a picnic
[1:38:34] or because they Blended in with the
[1:38:37] world
[1:38:38] Hallelujah they were hated and killed
[1:38:40] because they wouldn't have anything to
[1:38:41] do with the world
[1:38:43] [Music]
[1:38:45] what about the Lesser vessels what about
[1:38:47] people like Stephen what about people
[1:38:49] like Philip hey you don't read a whole
[1:38:52] lot about them but they were Mighty Men
[1:38:53] of Valor what about the house of
[1:38:55] Cornelius just a gallant man assembling
[1:38:58] of people in his house and while Peter
[1:39:00] yet speak these words the Holy Ghost
[1:39:01] fell what about the corneliuses what
[1:39:04] about Bethel Tabernacle
[1:39:06] Hallelujah we'll never achieve
[1:39:09] operational power if we're friends with
[1:39:12] the world
[1:39:17] friends
[1:39:20] family
[1:39:22] Bethel family
[1:39:28] unless you are willing
[1:39:31] to follow give me second Corinthians 10
[1:39:34] verse 5.
[1:39:36] second Corinthians 10 5.
[1:39:42] amen
[1:39:45] you've got to realize brother Jason will
[1:39:46] jump you
[1:39:47] got to be ready there you go
[1:39:51] second Corinthians 10 unless you're
[1:39:52] willing to do that
[1:39:54] you can forget operational status
[1:39:58] unless you're willing to cast down
[1:39:59] imaginations and
[1:40:01] there has never been a day where there
[1:40:05] were more vain imaginations to cast down
[1:40:09] and every every on every imaginable and
[1:40:12] unimaginable way that the devil tries to
[1:40:15] get at you and infect your mind
[1:40:20] he'll come right in and try to entice
[1:40:22] you sitting in church
[1:40:24] he'll try to entice you playing a tape
[1:40:27] he'll try to entice you reading your
[1:40:29] Bible
[1:40:30] he's not afraid of that he he doesn't
[1:40:32] care if you go to church he doesn't care
[1:40:34] how religious you are brother man said
[1:40:37] he doesn't even care how right you are
[1:40:38] in your Doctrine because he knows a
[1:40:40] great military secret he knows that if
[1:40:42] you miss the new birth you won't come up
[1:40:44] anyway and he'll still win
[1:40:49] unless you're willing to follow second
[1:40:51] Corinthians 10 5 casting down
[1:40:53] imaginations and every High thing that
[1:40:56] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[1:40:58] God
[1:40:59] and bring into captivity every thought
[1:41:01] to The Obedience of Christ let me tell
[1:41:03] you something friends you need to have a
[1:41:04] sure and steadfast Revelation given to
[1:41:06] you by Jesus Christ that this message is
[1:41:08] the rapture message
[1:41:10] and there's no there's no wiggle room in
[1:41:12] that there's no questioning that if you
[1:41:14] want to have rapturing faith you're
[1:41:16] going to have to have a rapturing word
[1:41:19] and if you want a rapturing word you're
[1:41:21] going to have to talk about a prophet
[1:41:22] I'm sorry that that offends the world
[1:41:25] but he only gives that kind of
[1:41:27] Revelation To His prophets
[1:41:29] [Applause]
[1:41:31] it can't be somebody who says they are
[1:41:33] it's got to be Vindicated
[1:41:35] [Applause]
[1:41:38] Colossians 3 17 Josh
[1:41:42] you've got to be willing to do this
[1:41:43] friends if you're not willing to do what
[1:41:45] Paul is saying here you're never going
[1:41:46] to know operational status Colossians 3
[1:41:49] 17.
[1:41:51] amen
[1:41:54] amen told you to be ready
[1:41:56] amen
[1:41:58] Colossians 3 17. and whatsoever you do
[1:42:02] in word or deed it's amazing how many
[1:42:04] deeds and words
[1:42:06] how many Deeds we do that you really
[1:42:08] can't say in the name of Jesus and how
[1:42:10] many words Escape your mouth
[1:42:12] to each other
[1:42:14] to your spouse to your children to your
[1:42:17] neighbor to your boss to your teacher
[1:42:21] if you can't say it in the name of Jesus
[1:42:23] Christ don't say it
[1:42:25] if you can't do it in word or deed if
[1:42:29] you can't do that and pronounce the name
[1:42:31] of Jesus upon it Paul is saying don't do
[1:42:34] that
[1:42:37] how would this even be possible without
[1:42:40] restoration
[1:42:42] in an age of total apostasy
[1:42:46] friends an age of mankind walking in the
[1:42:49] blindness prophesied in Isaiah 60.
[1:42:52] locked down under 2 000 years of failed
[1:42:55] religious traditions
[1:42:58] same pattern Paul warned about in the
[1:43:00] early church wolves coming in after his
[1:43:02] departure devouring the flock we've sure
[1:43:04] seen that in the six decades in a
[1:43:06] prophet since a prophet went home we've
[1:43:09] seen well same pattern wolves coming in
[1:43:10] trying to divide and separate don't have
[1:43:12] anything to do with it stay in love with
[1:43:14] Christ stay in love with his word
[1:43:16] hallelujah
[1:43:18] great movements
[1:43:21] in the ages of the church began we know
[1:43:24] that by history by Gallant Warriors of
[1:43:27] the faith
[1:43:28] only to see them devolve into shameful
[1:43:31] organizations
[1:43:32] build on Creeds and ideas of Fallen
[1:43:35] Angels after the departure of the
[1:43:36] original founder that is historically
[1:43:39] incontrovertible
[1:43:43] I challenge you to point to me a church
[1:43:46] that's that that began that didn't begin
[1:43:49] under Great Men of God down Through the
[1:43:52] Ages all the way up from the Reformation
[1:43:54] of Luther through Wesley through the
[1:43:56] Azusa revivalist
[1:43:59] through that and what they call the
[1:44:00] Pentecostal movement all the way up
[1:44:02] through everything and they started with
[1:44:05] Gallant men who stood for the word of
[1:44:07] God and didn't compromise on nothing and
[1:44:09] today the Bible describes them correctly
[1:44:11] they're full of vomit their tables are
[1:44:14] filled with vomit and their people know
[1:44:17] no more about God than than brother
[1:44:19] Brandon would say in his home spun way
[1:44:21] than a rabbit would know about snowshoes
[1:44:27] God is laying the burden on you and me
[1:44:31] to shine The Illuminating Light of the
[1:44:35] restored pure word and original faith
[1:44:39] of our fathers
[1:44:41] my fathers were the apostles
[1:44:44] the whole church is built on the
[1:44:47] doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets
[1:44:49] Jesus Christ not as not only the
[1:44:51] Cornerstone he's the headstone
[1:44:53] Hallelujah and he's building an
[1:44:55] overcoming Church how many want to be
[1:44:57] part of an overcoming Church
[1:44:59] amen let's stand to our feet friends
[1:45:01] that's as far as I can get today
[1:45:04] amen whole another burden I couldn't
[1:45:07] even scratch

[1:45:13] and

[1:45:32] something as you choose son
[1:45:35] father I thank you first of all that I
[1:45:39] was able to get to this concluding point
[1:45:41] today right at the point of my notes
[1:45:43] where I drew a line and said from here
[1:45:46] on it'll be part three and you hit it
[1:45:48] right on the head I thank you for that
[1:45:50] I thank you Lord God for your word we
[1:45:54] stand by what we've said today

[1:46:07] that everybody under the sound of my

[1:46:12] our Outreach our our our listing on
[1:46:16] archive I don't think any reasonable
[1:46:18] person
[1:46:19] could deny the points that were made
[1:46:22] today it's just too clear
[1:46:24] it's too incontrovertible it's too
[1:46:27] unchallengeable in the scriptures
