========================================

regimes. They routinely practice especially they they practice uh breaking the rules of international war when they feel that no one is watching. Under the third Geneva Convention, prisoners of war are uh are entitled. They must be treated humanely at all times. They must be protected from violence, intimidation, insults, public curiosity, and they must have access to medical care and contact with their families. &gt;&gt; That's actually the third Geneva Convention concerning prisoners of war. But rogue actors who ignore these rules, and history is replete with this, tend to violate the most basic floor of protection anytime there's war. Because the thought is, well, all's fair in war and there's no rules to war. the common article three uh by employing it goes on to say by employing prohibited acts they often employ prohibited acts such as torture cruel treatment hostage taking outrages upon personal dignit dignity in plain terms captives can face beatings electric shock stress positions sexual violence mock executions and deliberate humiliation. They can be denied medical care, adequate food or sleep, held in incommunicado and threatened even with harm to their families &gt;&gt; who are not even captured. Now the world, it's true, the world has gone after and actually have have prosecuted in in world courts and and I and I I remember when the the war was going on there in Serbia and and Herzgoina and those different places and and um and they and there was a very cruel dictator who was guilty of great atrocities of war and they actually captured him and tried him and put him in prison after it was all settled. Bosnia, Herziggoina and uh Serbians and different ones uh going on down in that war there in the Baltic states and and when they commit such acts it's it's really you say wow you know so so they they finally got what's coming to them and I and I will say this that they ought to get what's coming to them &gt;&gt; if justice is to be served and and what I would call righteous justice uh you know I I we realize that that even brother Brandham talks about being against capital punishment. He said even even God did not execute Cain. He put a mark on him. But I'm going to here to tell you something friends uh that desperate times can call for desperate measures. And when you have people who refuse to follow civilized law, very often times more often than we would like to imagine and far more often than than police force and military forces are forced to actually end someone's life, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they have no choice. Many times it's in the defense of their own life or to save and protect the lives of others or to turn back an invading force. We find that Samuel put Aag to death in that very same way when Saul had spared him. And and here was a man that was guilty of horrible genocidal acts against uh against the Jews. And Samuel immediately slaughtered him and told him that he was being killed for all the sons that he had robbed the Jewish mothers of. &gt;&gt; So this is only when justice and righteous judgment are put into effect. Too often unfortunately we don't see equality of action uh when persons um you know if I would say it like this sometimes there are persons and they're somewhat influential or nations that are too influ influential and or businesses that are too big to let them fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 59, brother Josh. Isaiah 59:14-18 the Bible says here and judgment God speaking this was this this was God speaking about you know no justice and no uh equity and and no fair judgment 59 14 to 18 verse 14 and judgment is turned away backwards excuse my voice I'm not sure what's going on but it's All good. I'll preach right through it and blow it out and then it'll work. &gt;&gt; Verse 14. Judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth a far off. For truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter. Yay, truth faileth, and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey. So good people get killed. See, &gt;&gt; and the Lord saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment. And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor. Therefore, his arm brought salvation unto him, and his righteousness it sustained him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head. And he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak. According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies. To the islands he will repay recompense. When we talk about going into a battle unprepared and you're either going to be annihilated or you're going to be taken as a prisoner of war and you can see that in the natural and as I even as I have taken these first 15 minutes just to lay out that very natural picture I've drawn in your mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you all agree with me in the natural. No, I wouldn't I wouldn't go to war against a highly trained, highly skilled, highly conditioned, heavily armed enemy with no weapons and no training and no conditioning. I wouldn't do that because naturally I'd either get killed very quickly or I'd be taken a prisoner of war very quickly and it might be a rogue nation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But why is it that we would imagine that it would be any different in spiritual war? Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll ask you this another question tonight. Got a number of questions I want to put to you and present. Which kind of war would be of greater concern to you that you had to fight in? A natural war where you had to face bullets and tanks and jets and missiles where you had to face drones and could be killed silently by a sniper. Would you would you have greater concern to fight that natural war or a spiritual war? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a good question, don't you think? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Jesus says in Matthew 10:28, "Fear not them which kill the body, &gt;&gt; but are not able to kill the soul." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; you know, we serve at the pleasure of the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's been a king for a long time. He's the king of heaven, the king of earth, and the king of the universe. In fact, he's the king of all men. He's not only the God of good men, he's the God of all men. He leads men at his choosing. And he has a way that he has worked with humanity down through the centuries. You know, if you were part of a natural army and you were able to walk in the ranks of the best army in the world with the best commanding generals and the best under under the generals of command staff uh that are under the generals and men who had winning records in battle, men who had been leading successful assaults and defensive maneuvers for decades. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I present to you tonight in a spiritual war that God had generals. &gt;&gt; And God has a command staff. And he calls his command staff a five-fold ministry. And he called his generals the seven spirits of God that would anoint seven stars in his right hand that would be sent to the earth to receive a message to spread forth the carcass of the word so the eagles could gather. And it causes great spiritual warfare when he does that. &gt;&gt; Amen. this five-fold ministry. I mean, this command staff that you had the privilege to serve under, they had real chops and they'd proven themselves in battle for many years. And their their top priority was to throttle the enemy daily. And their top priority to serve the king was to drive Satan off of kingdoms lands while keeping you alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when I come back full circle and I say it all like that, I come back to my original two of my questions. Why would you imagine for a moment that that natural war would be different than spiritual war or spiritual war might be different than natural war? And the second one was which kind of war would be of greater threat or greater concern? I think I have convinced you by the words of Christ. I don't care about missiles, drones, and all that. I'm not saying they don't matter. I'm just saying all that could do is take your body. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "Don't fear the one who can take your body, but fear the one who can take both body and soul and destroy you in hell." Cuz there's no coming back from that. &gt;&gt; So, let me ask you one last time, natural spiritual warfare, which is the greater threat? Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to put you on edge, but I just want to say from my heart that if you thought that or if you think that natural warfare was the more deadly and the greater concern, then that might just explain why you lose so many spiritual battles. &gt;&gt; Amen. So often might explain how that you are if you think that the natural battle is of greater threat than the spiritual battle then uh you know I would say that you are probably lucky or rather than lucky you're you're blessed to even be still in the game only it's not a game. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's your daily life and you've got a choice in this spiritual warfare and God has control over your life. But I'm here to tell you something, friends. Your daily spiritual life in a spiritual prisoner of war camp of a rogue devil is no way to live a Christian life. you're cut off from home and all the things that you love most. And that's what the devil does. The devil will take families and he'll he'll raise up a a a child in that family and they become a teenager and the next thing you know, hear me well, teenagers. Next thing you know, they're flirting with the world and they're going out. I'm here to tell you, you're marching to a prisoner of war camp. And when the devil puts you in it and slams the door, you'll be cut off from the family, your friends, your health, your money, and you'll you'll live a a miserable life and say, "Why? What happened to those days?" &gt;&gt; When I walked in peace and I had a home and I had a family and I had a church and I had a five-fold ministry that loved me and cared about me. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A lot of times we can argue and it's not just teenagers, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Sometimes that kind of thing happens in marriages. Sometimes that thing happens to dads or husbands or mothers or wives or both or all of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a lot of times they actually still live in their house. You might still live in your house. You might still come to church. and uh you know you you might even have some some some friends and some family that are gathered around you but you're not there really. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not really. Because it's true that even sometimes when you sit in church, you you you sit in church cuz maybe you like church. Maybe that's why you come. But but but you're not here. You're not really here when you're here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, let me let me let me just try to smooth that over with a little bit of honey in the rock. Uh, you know, maybe that last part is not exactly true about you. Perhaps you you actually do come here to get cleaned up and get the washing of the water in the of the word because you like to feel clean spiritually. You like to feel good. You like to feel in contact with God because you know you need it and you want to feel clean. &gt;&gt; But you but you also know you also know and I hope you wouldn't try to deny it to the Holy Spirit. You also know that you're shortch changing God. Your friends and your family and they trust you and they love you and you're shortch changing all of them because of a of a lack of ferveny in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know deep inside that a real ferveny is lacking. Not saying you're not a believer. Not saying you don't want to be at church. You do. You're here. Not trying to judge why you're here. I'm just wanting I just want you to be honest with yourself tonight. God put this burden on my heart and just trying to make the notes of it today. Could not stop weeping. And and I don't even have a particular case that I'm thinking of, but just the whole burden of this friends, God has called us to ferveny. He's called us to zeal. He's called us to care. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; I know. I know that as children of God, you would rather have that, wouldn't you? &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you rather have much more have a life where you know him and the power of his resurrection? Wouldn't you like to know him and all the wonderful freedoms that he offers you? And he offers you quite a bit. &gt;&gt; Where every morning I thought to myself, Lord, I want to wake up every morning in the fresh air of righteousness. &gt;&gt; I want to wake up every morning and feel the love of God sweeping down. And I want to lay my head on my pillow at night and say, "Lord, I love you." And he believes me and he knows it's true and I know it's true and wake up the next morning. Good morning, Lord. How can I serve you today, this beautiful day? Doesn't matter what's happening outside. I'm in a I'm living in a spiritual place &gt;&gt; where we breathe that fresh air &gt;&gt; of righteousness. The United States knows and the United States armed forces and I read an address to Congress. They have something called SEIR. I I guess I'm pronouncing it right. It's it's capital letters s e r e survival evasion resistance and escape. The United States equips its forces with a code of conduct and sear. And it's a training to prepare them in case they are captured by the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To train them for possible isolation and captivity and to re be able to return with honor. And that that training, while necessary, has proven to fall woefully short against a rogue nation that systematically violates the laws of war. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to say to you tonight, friends, Satan is the head of a global rogue nation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the spiritual warfare that he is waging against the planet Earth. And here we live, friends. and he hates the bride worst of all. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You realize that the Bible teaches us that hell was created for the devil and his angels. &gt;&gt; But we also find out that a unique amazing thing happens near the end time, the early part of the 20th century under the fifth trumpet and its corresponding vial. We find that that that a that an angel falls from heaven and and and he has a key to the bottomless pit and brother Brandham ties him back to Isaiah's prophecy, how art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the morning. And brother Brandham would say later in describing that event, he would say it like this, the lids torn from hell &gt;&gt; and demon powers are streaming into the earth. That's the day and hour that you and I live. &gt;&gt; Amen. The earth hadn't had that happening. Sure, Satan had a presence in the world, but it was not Satan's Eden. He couldn't even become Satan's Eden. First, he had to fall from heaven, be given a temporary authority to open the bottomless pit. That's a real thing. &gt;&gt; And the and those demons came up out of there. And brother Brandham said, "The lid is torn from hell. Demon powers are streaming through the earth." I'm here to tell you that the prison of hell and its chains of darkness have come to the surface. the world order from that moment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That time there in the very early part of the 20th century, the world began to devolve into a chaos that has only worsened until finally it has become what a prophet pulling no punches declared it to be Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; Yes. to where pulling no punches. A prophet has made it clear that Lucifer, yes, that guy &gt;&gt; is the one and the same who was the enemy of God, &gt;&gt; who fell, who opened the pit, that same one who met Jesus in Gethsemane and tried to dissuade him from Calvary. That same one who offered him all the kingdoms of the earth and Jesus didn't argue that. Amen. &gt;&gt; That same one according to a prophet is now the god of this evil age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's made a god by popular demand because he had no authority to make himself a god. But he has ma become an object of worship. And the people now worshiping him make him the god the worshiped being of this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. An age Isaiah would describe as darkness covering the whole earth and gross darkness upon the minds of humanity worldwide with the former demon inmates now running the prison. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which has come to earth, the earth we call home. We're amazed, even astonished at times that the Lord has left us here this long. &gt;&gt; Come on, let's be honest. &gt;&gt; As I said to you Sunday, I I already expected to be several decades into the millennium by now. &gt;&gt; Amen. I growing up as a young man, I thought there I mean by now 2025 I expected us to be sitting around a rose garden in young bodies enjoying a millennial world and saying you remember that day back there. Oh, what a bunch of nonsense. We were so worried about it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Those things we chased after so hard &gt;&gt; that we're still here fighting this greatest battle. All I can say is that for sure you cannot lean to your own understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you do, if you try to reason out your life, if you try to reason out your trials, if you try to reason with God, you remember some months ago we preached about Abraham and Abraham did that and God had made him a promise and God came back a second time and promised him. Then God come back a third time and even after three times, Abraham is now still looking at reasoning. But the I don't even have a son and this one board in my house is not my heir and looks like he's going to get everything. And I know what you promised me, but I just don't see any way when I'm looking at it from a reasonable standpoint. I don't see how it can be. I don't see how the promise can come to pass. Yes, I believe it, but my reasoning is battling my mind. Abraham opened up that conversation for a reason. &gt;&gt; Amen. He wasn't just passing the time making this wasn't chitchat. He wasn't just trying to have casual conversation. He's pouring out the burden of his heart. And the Lord after the third time was not going to come back around and say,"Abraham, I told you once. You know, parents say that if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times." He loves He, you know, I'm not going to tell you a second time. I already told you second time. Now I'm telling you a third time. So now I got a challenge for you, Abraham. I need you to do something. And this is this is a command. I want you to walk outside, look up into the night sky, count the stars, and give me the number. &gt;&gt; And that was that was so unfair of God. It was so unreasonable because Abraham had no way to do that. &gt;&gt; Even science today with all of its instruments has no way to do that. So, I made the point to you that when you if you keep trying to reason God's promises, God will put you in an in in an unreasonable situation to get you to stop reasoning his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stop reasoning it, Abraham. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham has told us that God gave us 10 senses. You you have the five that are on your body. You have the five that are in your spirit. And and these 10 senses a prophet talks about were given to you to to contact the world you live in. Now this is your you know your touching, your tasting, your sight, your smell, your hearing. You've got memories, you've got reason, you've got affection, you've got imagination, you've got conscious. These are given to you so that you can contact the world you live in. But brother Brandham said, "But he did not give them to you to lead you." &gt;&gt; Right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Memory, conscience, reason, affection, imagination, what feels good, smells good, looks good here, sounds good, tastes good, that's not that's not what you're supposed to be following. He put a a part of himself down in your soul, and he comes to anoint that life, and that becomes the mind of Christ, and that's to lead you. And it doesn't matter how insensible, how unreasonable, or why we're still here in 2025. All I know is my redeemer liveth. And at the last day, I'll see him in the flesh, and I'll see him myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me give you some prophetic intel on the leader of this rogue nation. You like that? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. I wanted to read it because brother Brandham here in the God of this evil age he says now think let that soak in and when you play this tape back on this point here stop for a while and think. So I did just that. He starts talking about Satan becoming the god of this evil age. It's the people that's done it. He says his works are exalted above God's word and manifested works. The wisdom of Satan which he gave to Eve at the beginning. Now listen, don't miss this. The wisdom of Satan is exalted to the throne of worship in man above the vindicated word of God for the hour. You don't even have to spend an hour on the streets to know that's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our churches prove that by their seminaries, schools of learning. Dr. So and so, teacher so and so, professor so and so has exalted their own knowledge socalled from Satan. Their their knowledge so-called truth above the vindicated promise of God made clear right before them. and man fall for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's a ruse. He got tricked. He got duped. He's fell for something. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "And a man will fall for it." See, and a lot of times, you know, Brother Brandham would just say that and I say that I sometimes I'll catch myself saying I'll go I'll make a point. I go, see, and it's just something we say. And preachers say that. And brother Brandman when he when I read that sea and there's a question mark there and I thought yeah I do I do see that I do I thought about a conversation that I had with a very fine man and I mean that very sincerely very fine man you know not a not a believer of the message a nominal Christian but a very fine fellow honest I've never found him to be dishonest at all he seems to be very noble very sincere here leads Bible studies. I've set in on his Bible studies that he leads there in his home. He doesn't have to do that. He's a very wealthy man. He takes his time to help people. He's he's been a great friend to to members of my family. And you know, I had a a really nice conversation with him the other day, and I say it was a very nice conversation, but it left me a little sad after it was over. um you know because he he he had a really very sincere question that you know he was going on a or had been on a podcast and they wanted him to come back and be be a guest speaker again and they were trying to settle the question what is the gospel very good question that's an excellent question and you know he he had a very good he had a very good answer already prepared he's an intelligent man a Bible student and you know but but but his answer is the little twominute pre packaged almost read from a script explaining if you've only got two minutes with somebody can you tell them what the gospel is quickly &gt;&gt; and he he wanted my take what what would you say I don't know why he was asking me I don't know if he thought I'd memorize some kind of a you know I had that happen to me one time I'm talking to a man and next thing I know he's sitting beside me reading me the sinner's prayer &gt;&gt; and I I know what you you understand I'm What are you doing? You know, I'm in here trying to be a light to you and you're okay, never mind. Whatever. It it it it shocked me. But I appreciated his zeal. He was also a very fine man. Jerry Stokes, who it was, a lot of people know Jerry and uh very very very fine man. And I've done plenty of business at his dealerships. I like the I like Stokes Honda, Stokes Toyota. very fine people we have in this community. And you know when I when I began to to give my my answer I said well you know I said if somebody if you just want my quick short take on what is the gospel? I said to me the gospel is the answer to Job's question. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's the answer. It's the question that plagued mankind for millennia that brother Brandham took up when he and brother Brandham is beginning to preach and takes the first 45 minutes. Oh my goodness. And and and he and he and he and he's talking about how that that you know man had suffered. And it Job said if a if the flowers die, they come back. If the tree dies, if the grass withers, it comes back. But if a man die, can he live again? Is this it? Is there another life? What's what's happening? What's hap? Why am I here? What's life all about? And brother Brandham said that day when Christ rose, he answered the question. And he set mankind free. No, you don't need to fear anymore. The sun has risen. &gt;&gt; It is the rising of the sun. And he said, when that sun went up into the heavens that day, it was the greatest declaration the world had ever had. Yes, there's another life. Yes, you can be forgiven. No, you don't have to die. You don't ever have to die. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And I I just I I went into a 30 60 90 second montage of that I suppose you'd call it. And and he just said, "Well, yeah, that's I've never thought about that." Um, you know, taking it from the angle of Job and that didn't surprise me. We're constantly you say sometimes the most rudimentary elementary things and and you can tell people have never they've never known the Bible could be used like that. I'm here to tell you William Brham taught things out of this Bible that you're guaranteed not to hear in the average Sunday morning pullpit. &gt;&gt; And I don't love it because it's more knowledge or more theology. I love it because it lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I and I and and it's and it's provable not only in chapter and verse, but it's provable in the life that it brings. &gt;&gt; So, you know, and he he said, "Well, you know, I that's great." And it was kind of like, you know, that's really good, but what I was after was, you know, if I've only I I can't preach a sermon to somebody. I said, "Well, I didn't preach you a sermon. I just gave you a little short." He said, "Well, I guess what I'm looking for is just a little, you know," he just wanted X's and O's. ABCD.1 point 2.3 and I I so cuz I really like him a lot and I was trying in my roundabout way to say yeah but what good is that? &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; if if all you give them is the is the X's and O's, the devil knows all of that. All you've done is give them mechanics of it, but you can't really explain anything about the dynamic power of the life that comes in you when you believe it. And I said, I'm not I I said, that's that's great if you're trying to give them information. I'm all for that. &gt;&gt; Put it on a track. Put it on the card. Hand it to somebody. I'm not opposed to that. Brother Brandham talks about that car salesman who just found a little track and it led him to eternal life. Where will you spend eternity? And that's all it took. And it put him put him to thinking. Then the Lord started talking to him. So I'm not against that at all. I'm for that. I But but but I but I found it. I found that that that entry point without what really follows the real thing that can really bring somebody to life that can really show them that he's not just some man-made system. He's a living being. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when brother Brandham is saying, "See man fall for it." I do you see? I said yes. I said to myself, "I do. I see it. I see it and it's heartbreaking when you see it so clearly but you realize that they don't see it or maybe they refused to take it in deeply into their heart and that see he he started speeding up and sounded a little nervous like he was just trying not to have this conversation and I was all too happy to back out cuz it was you know I was starting to feel discombobulated myself. I wanted to go on to greater things. He didn't seem open to that at all. And I wanted to end the call very good and we did and we're great friends and I wish him all the best and I'd help him again at any time. He he talked to me about maybe going on a podcast with him. I'd be happy to do I'd probably recommend JD do it, but I'd be happy to do it. So, you know, we sometimes when you when you have something that you know would help someone. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. and you you you have such strong affection for them. Perhaps maybe there's someone special in your life and they don't really see what you see, but you want them to see it so desperately bad. And I and sometimes, you know, can I just say this without flipping the script and making you tighten up on me? You know, sometimes God's very well-intentioned family members, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; get caught on that slippery slope. They have so much affection for this person, and they want them to see it so bad, and the person doesn't hasn't don't see it, don't want to see it, don't really want to talk about it, but they they get tricked into their mind if I just start to compromise and let down my own bars and I can stay close and kind of hang out with them. And all that happens to you down the road, that person is no more converted than ever. And now you're half &gt;&gt; backslid. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; I can tell you something, friends. Jesus never did that. &gt;&gt; Say, I love sinners. Nobody loves sinners more than Jesus. &gt;&gt; But he never did that. Did he Did he eat with sinners? He did eat with sinners. But when he went into the house of Simon to that great feast, he demonstrated that he never compromised the gospel because they left him over in a corner unwashed, uncked, uncared for, and all alone and and pushed him aside. I'm here to tell you something. There was nothing about him that was accommodating to the sinner. &gt;&gt; He loved them, but he stood clearly on the word of God. And that's what I want to stand. I'm happy to help anybody I can and project the love of God. And I and I know it takes the Holy Spirit. And I know there's going to be foolish virgin and the heathen. And I know not everybody in heaven is going to be a message believer, but excuse me, I am a message believer. &gt;&gt; And excuse me, I have received the whole word. And excuse me, but I want everyone to see it. &gt;&gt; They didn't care about him. They left him in a corner unwashed and unloved. Very much unloved. But there was a broken woman. &gt;&gt; A life so broken. Brother Brandham says she was embarrassed for him to know where she got the money to buy the ointment. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible says she stood behind him weeping. And there he was, Jesus. And brother Brandon, Jesus with dirty feet. &gt;&gt; And it broke the prophet's heart to think. He kept saying, "My Lord." Just to think of it. My lord, sitting there, the king of heaven and earth and the prince of peace and the mighty God and the everlasting father, the one who loved everybody and was giving his life for the sinner. And God was going to trade the innocent for the guilty. And there he sits, unwashed, unloved, uncetpt for, unconcerned. But here was one broken woman that loved him. And I thought to myself, you know, she she brother Brandham said, she went in there. She knew he'll know. He'll know where I got this money. She tells the man, "Here's my money. I want the best you've got. I He'll know where it come from, but I don't care. I got to do something for him." I'm here to tell you, she didn't have anything else she could offer him in life but the results of all of her sin. But she brought that to Jesus. &gt;&gt; She didn't have any she didn't have any water to wash his feet, but she had a river of tears that had been building up her whole life. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And she began to weep and she began to anoint his feet with the ointment. She began to cry. She began to dry his feet with her tears. Oh my. She she here here here is a woman with a lifetime of regrets. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's all pouring out at the feet of the master. I sometimes I get so wrapped up in brother Brandham and he goes there and he says, "Oh wondering star, oh wondering star, sons of God, daughters of God, hurling through the blackness of sin in this life and away from God. Don't you know you came from God? You're part of his creative word. And he says, "Oh, wondering stars, wind your way back home. Come back to the Lord. I thought about I thought about oh sad sinner. I thought about all sad prisoner of war." And maybe you've been a believer and and you love God and you really do and he really knows it and you actually have faith and you've been born again, but you've you've allowed the carnal edges of this world to draw you away. And sometimes you've become a prisoner of war. We might have some here tonight. I want to tell you something that the same God who created heaven and earth can open those prison doors like he did for Peter, like he did for Paul and Silas. He can drop those chains off of you. Come home, prisoner of war. Walk out of that prison. Walk out of those chains that were those were meant for the devil and his angels, not God's family. &gt;&gt; They weren't meant for you. &gt;&gt; Bring a repentant heart to Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you something, friends. We're going to we're I'm out of time and we're going to take up some prayer requests. I want you to know something tonight that you have the beautiful ability to take those chains, whatever they have been that have held you back from zeal and real ferveny before the Lord. and you've allowed the this dark evil day with darkness covering the world and men's minds covered in darkness and and all it's all global and Satan's Eden and sometimes yeah we're coming to church and we love how it cleans us. we we love. But you know something, it it it it it I I I just heard brother Josh Bennett talk about this how that how that you know it it comes back to a a personal choice that you've got to make and that God, you know, when when God comes to raise Lazarus from the grave, Jesus could have moved the stone with the word, but he wouldn't move the stone cuz he didn't put it there. And he tells the people who put it there, move it. I'm here to do the work. I'm here to do the miracle. I'm here to fulfill the vision. But I need you to do the work. Oh, wandering star. Oh, prisoner of war, drop those chains. God, why don't you stand up on your feet with me tonight and say, "I'm raising my hands in freedom and I'm dropping chains and I'm walking out of prison doors. Hallelujah. I want to be completely free. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to have access to all that God has given me. &gt;&gt; Come. Yes. Musicians, please. &gt;&gt; We're going to take up requests tonight. I have a few. You know, I can say to you tonight, I can say, "Bring chains that walk away from those chains that have held back your ferveny. Bring it to the master." You got a chain on your life. You feel like you're a prisoner of war. some some kind of thing, some lifestyle. Remember I said at the beginning, we're talking about transgressions. Sinful lifestyles lead to sins. Failing lifestyles lead to failure. Transgressive lifestyles lead to more transgressions. James made that very clear to us. Oh, I'm here to tell you something, friends. Whether your need tonight is is spiritual, emotional, maybe you've got physical uh problem and the devil has battled you. I'll invite you to come tonight and bring that sickness to the king. Bring those chains to the king. Bring that prison to the king. It doesn't matter. He's here to set you at liberty. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm here to tell you something, friends. Satan has maybe battled you for a sickness for a long time. Well, you know something? If anything at all, you have proven this that you're still a believer and he has failed. And I would invite you tonight to bring that sickness to the king and let let's do away with this devil tormenting you like that. &gt;&gt; How many are on board with that tonight? &gt;&gt; Oh, gather around. We got to go here. It's already uh 25 till. Come on and gather around the front with me. [Music] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what the need might be. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is well able, more than able. He is uh Hey De, he is able more than able to accomplish what concerns me today. You know that song, Bradley? Amen. Help me with that Deb, will you? He is &gt;&gt; He is &gt;&gt; able more than able. Oh yes. to accomplish what concerns me today. He He is aable, more than a oh my, to handle anything that comes my way. Oh, he is aable more. Oh hallelujah. More than able to do much more than I could ever dream. He is able, more than able to make me what he wants me to be. Sing it again. He is able. Let's raise our hands. &gt;&gt; More than able. Yes, Lord to accomplish what concerns me. &gt;&gt; Whatever that need might be, friend, he is aable more than a &gt;&gt; hallelujah. To handle. Do you believe he can handle it? anything that comes my way. Oh, he's able. He's aable. More and able to do what? To do much more than I could ever dream. He is aable. More than able. Yes, he is. [Music] Sister Melissa writes, "Please pray for my daughter Nicole. She's under a heavy load at this time. Not only does she work full-time as a pharmacy tech, the store she works for is currently without a manager, she's had to pick up all the manager responsibilities along with her own." Her fiance's dad has been diagnosed with cancer and now lives with her. She is his caretaker after working 12-hour shifts. My goodness. With 2-hour roundtrip commute, she's on her way to take him to the ER due to a complication from his diagnosis. She's asking prayer for him and I'm asking prayer for her. She carries this burden without complaint, but I know she is exhausted. It doesn't surprise me Coley would carry that without complaint. That's the kind of girl she's always been. How many will I pray for Nicole tonight? We've loved her a long time. Knew her since she was just a little girl. Sister Deborah Lowry needs prayer tonight for pain in her back and her leg. Brother Caleb Campbell has a prayer request. I have a lady that I work with by name of Sher Hinnan that has been diagnosed with liver cancer. Apparently, chemo doesn't work for this type of cancer. So the next step was to do an imunotherapy, but that was also unsuccessful. They now want to try a drug that is supposed to block blood flow to the cancer cells. Apparently, it wouldn't kill the cancer, but it would help it stop growing. She is undergoing a lot of tests this week to see if that drug is something her body can even handle. I've had her heavy on my heart for the last two weeks. And I told her yesterday that I was going to ask our church to pray for her. I told her we're a bibleelving church who has seen miracles take place even in cancer cases. And that we will be believing uh we will be believing for a complete healing. Amen. [Music] I don't seem to have any other prayer requests. Hopefully you've got them all into me by now. He is able. He is able. Let's sing it. Oh, he is aable. More than able to accomplish what concerns me today. He is aable, more than able to handle to handle anything that comes my way. Oh, he is able, more than able. Think about what you're singing to to do much more than I could ever dream. [Music] He is able, more than able to make me what he wants me to be. Take the hand or join with someone standing near you. Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Master, we are before you tonight. We want to thank you, Lord, for your word, for your presence, for your anointing, for helping me to unbburden my heart, Lord, with all that time would allow. And perhaps I'll have another time with more to say, but I feel satisfied in my heart tonight that the word went forth, Lord. And on a Wednesday night, it it found like an arrow of deliverance, Lord. It may even be across the internet, someone listening, it may be someone here tonight that days from now, that arrow of deliverance, Lord, will strike their heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it'll be a freedom. I pray, Lamb of God, that your children near and far realize that they don't have to live as prisoners of war. They don't have to be prisoners to this rogue nation, this rogue leader. They serve the great King of heaven, Lord. And you open prison doors. You you you you break chains and feathers off of people's lives. You forgive sin to the uttermost. You turn to that woman, Lord, weeping. You said to Simon, "I say unto you, her sins, which are many." Oh, he knew of her sins. She wasn't wrong, thinking that he'll know where I got this money. He'll know how I earned it, but I can't help it. I've got to give him Lord, you wanted her to come with that level of honesty. I pray that each and every person will meet you at that same level. If they do, then you have to treat them the way you treated her. And you have to say your sins, child, your transgressions, your carnality, your your your your lack of zeal, your lack of fervent ferveny, which is big, which is huge. Your sins and transgressions are many, but they're all forgiven. &gt;&gt; And I'm ready to restore you. Walk closer to me, child. That's all you have to do. Walk away from the world, the God of this evil age. He loves hanging around your family, Lord. But the the family of God must be the ones to walk away from him cuz he's certainly not going to walk away. He's not going anywhere anytime soon, Lord. But Father, we have an ability to stay clear of him, to take things out of our lives and and our and our homes and our occupations, our relationships, to remove anything that's causing a lack of ferveny toward you and your word. We want to breathe the fresh air of cleanness. We want to breathe in that that deep air of righteousness, that clean feeling of knowing that God is pleased with your life. knowing that he's a word and whisper of away and you can say father and he'll say here am I my son &gt;&gt; hallelujah oh grant it Lord break every chain break every open every prison door break every sickness and disease upon your people meet the need Lord that sister Melissa turns in for Nicole right now Nicole with her own request for this other person and a mother now for her daughter we're joining with our sister Lord to believe for the for what might look impossible, but with God all things are possible. And the Bible says, "Nothing shall be thought impossible with God." The more impossible it is, the better you like it, the greater glory you get out of it. Lord, I pray for Sister Deborah and this pain in her leg and her back and she's did all she can do and let the doctors do what they can do. Father, we're asking for your special touch upon her tonight, this very night, Lord. I pray for this poor woman under the affliction of a cancer demon. Lord, we have another woman, my wife and I met. She's under a under a death sentence from a demon of cancer. We condemn the work of cancer in both of these ladies. We lift prayers. We pray against you, Satan. We pray against you in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord God, may you come with healing in your wings, with mercy. Oh God, your throne is established in mercy. May it be so, Lord God. May it let the light of God's mercy reach. Lord, I pray that you give us courage to face the dark world to face this time where darkness is short to shore and gross darkness in the minds of humanity the world over. the whole the whole all the all the former inmates of hell. Hell created for the devil and his angels now loosed upon the earth. And the inmates are running the whole country, running the whole nation, running the whole world, a whole order of called Satan's Eden, a cosmos, an order that is someday soon going to pass away and give way to a new order. We look forward to that day, Lord. We look forward with great eagerness. We're not in no ways tired, Lord. We're ready to continue fighting. We're ready to keep pressing the battle, Lord God. I pray you'll help us [Music] one for all and all for one together. We commit these things into your hands tonight. I think we've said plenty, Lord. Now, let the Holy Spirit have his way in Jesus' name. One more time. He is aable more than a oh yes to accomplish what concerns me today. He is aable, &gt;&gt; more than able [Music] to handle anything that comes my way. Oh, he is aable more. Hallelujah. more than I &gt;&gt; could ever dream. He is able more than able to make me to make me what he wants me to be. One more time. to make me. Oh, to make me what he wants me to be. One more time. One more time.

So, it's kind of swollen on one side. We had it biopsied and it was clear. And so, we were grateful for that. Um, and then over the last few years, it's grown. So it got a little bigger, a little more noticeable, really bugged her. So we found a thyroid specialist, went to them and had tests done, biopsy, came back yesterday, totally benign, no problem, and a treatment to to shrink it and get it going. So we just want to thank God for that. [Applause] &gt;&gt; All right. So, I was playing football um a couple days ago and I fell and twisted my ankle. At first, it didn't hurt that badly, but um after I had just like after a little while at home, it started actually getting painful.
