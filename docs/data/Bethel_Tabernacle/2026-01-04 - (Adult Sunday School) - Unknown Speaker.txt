TRANSCRIPT
========================================
And with these few foolish words that I have that the people would be able to take something of value from it, be able to hide your word into their hearts, face this dark day. Be with us. We invite you into our service knowing full well that you always come when you're invited. We ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. So, um I want to take a brief reading and let y'all be seated. Um and we'll just and you don't necessarily have to turn. I'll just read it. Um this is from Acts chapter 1. When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? And he said unto them, "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in his own power, but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you, and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth." Y'all could be seated. So, um I want to um take So, last time I was here, which was back in December, I don't remember exactly when um it's been a been a while. Um seems like um the um last time I was here, I I did a a Sunday school and I took the the title Dynamo um and just sort of talking about um putting mechanics with dynamics and things like that. Um, and I wanted to kind of um, kind of take that thought and and spend a little more time on it. Um, it's just been what's burning me up um, the last couple weeks. And, um, I just felt like I didn't kind of rushed it last time because I was trying to do it all in one in one Sunday school. So, if you don't mind if some you hear some repeated things, I'm sorry. Um, but that's just kind of where um, where the Lord feel like the Lord's leading me. So um so anyhow um the um I want to take this this scripture here and where it talks about um but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you. Now um I also read here this is second Peter chapter uh 1 verse 5 and it says and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity. So uh this is from we all are very familiar with this the statue of the perfect man. Um this is the the scriptural basis for I'm sure what I'm sure we're all very familiar with with you know we've all seen the diagram of the pyramid with all the different levels and the church ages and the messengers and everything all kind of stacked up together. And um you know, I just want to take a a minute here and just notice that this is if you're going to have the stature of the perfect man, you cannot leave out any one layer of that, right? You know, you have to have you have to have the faith and then you have to build each step upon the next. If you try to get away, if you try to do things out of order, then you're going to have problems, right? Um, and I'll and this is the analogy that I'm going to keep coming back to, right? Because this is just what I know, right? I'm a mechanic. I'm that's what I I you know, I work on generators every day. I work on engines. And um, [clears throat] you know, every single component, we talk a lot about the the God having a line and order to his word, right? There's a line, right? Meaning that there's there's a a an organization, right? Every every part of the word has a place. Um, but then there's also an order to it. There's it's not it's both, right? Because you can have all the right components, but if they're not ordered, if they're not um set in the right timing, then you also have problems, right? You can take like on an engine, you can take there's a you know big big chain on the front of engine block called a timing chain. If that timing chain is and that's just that timing what its job is, if you can't figure it out from the name is it sets the timing for every cylinder. It says that for every rocker, every push rod, every spark plug, every single part of that engine is the timing of it is set by that timing chain and um and the timing gears. And so if if any if that chain gets out of align, if that if the gears get out of align with and things aren't in in proper order, you're going to get misfires. You're going to get um you know, spark is going to be going off when there's no fuel in the cylinder. Um there's going to be you know, you're going to be venting fuel out before the spark hits. Nothing. and you're going to get misfires in the in the in the in the cylinders. Nothing's going to work right. It's going to be kind of powerless. The engine it you might get some some fire in some of the the the cylinders. It'll make some noise, but it won't be right. And you're it's going to be kind of gutless, right? It'll be it'll be making a lot of noise like it's got power. It, you know, potentially. Um, but it's not it's not going to be working right. And so, it's it's actually important when we look at the statue of the perfect man. There is a line, right? You have to have all the components in there. But there's also an order to this, right? There's also an order to this. And if you try to um get things out of order, you're going to have problems. You know, God, it really does matter to to God the order in which we do things, right? There's a reason why we have a song service before the preaching. There's a reason why um you know that there's a reason why we have, you know, repentance before baptism, right? There's these are things are important and if we try to we try to get um get out of order, we try to do things um out of sequence, you know, timing timing is is timing is everything with God, right? Timing is is is everything with God. You I mean, you take a um a seed, you know, you don't you you there's a lot of planting and watering and waiting before you get fruit, right? There's a there's a lot of there's a process. And so, you know, I just want to, you know, that's a I think that's a key thing to to bear in mind in all of this. Um, but I want to read this is from the the sermon statue of a perfect man 1962. Says, "Then add to your faith virtue." Now, right there knocks a lot of us down. Yes, sir. Yes. Add virtue to your faith. That doesn't just mean living a virgin life, you know, like the woman or a man and so forth. That doesn't have nothing to do with that. The Bible said, we read over here in the book of Luke where it said virtue went out of him. Is that right? If we're going to be like him, we must have virtue. Then we must have it to be like him. And so, you know, I think this is a very very striking um striking quote. I think I heard this when brother Caleb uh read this during Sunday study school and it kind of floored me a little bit um because I had never put that together um that you know in the where it's talking about statue of perfect man it's referring brother Brandham links the virtue in the statue of perfect man to the virtue that went out of out of Christ when the woman got healed. Um and so we'll just kind of to add a little bit of of um context there. This is Luke chapter 8 is the scripture that he's referencing there. Um Luke chapter 8 vers 45 and Jesus said who touched me when all denied Peter um and they that were with him said master the multitude throng theemp and press thee and sayest thou who touched me and Jesus said somebody hath touched me for I perceive that virtue has gone out of me now if you take that you know it obviously doesn't make a whole lot of sense necessarily if if you're equating the word virtue to simply like what brother Brandham said like a virgin life a lot doesn't make any sense. How does how does you know the touching Jesus cause his his holiness lif style to leave him? That doesn't make any sense. But if the reason why it doesn't make any sense is because, you know, with in spite of their best efforts, the folks who translate the King James didn't exactly translate that word exactly one to one to into English. Um the the Greek word there um is actually the that the word virtue is actually translated from the Greek word dynamin is how we would pronounce it. Um and what that word means is uh force specifically miraculous power. Okay. So, so it's not um and so obviously if we if we were to translate it that way and Jesus said, "Somebody had touched me for I perceived that miraculous power is gone out of me." Okay, so we we we follow that. Um now that word dynamon is um I'm sure some of you may be familiar with that. It's where we get the word dynamo. It's also where we get the word dynamite. Um it's or dynamic. anything with dynamism comes from um that word damon or technically um dunami but dynamon is is kind of the more um direct English to that but um so the the point here is that what Jesus is referring to and it's by the way it's the same word in that he used in Acts chapter 1 when he said you will be endued with power from on high what he said was you should be endued with dynam on high and so you know and so for for brother Brandham to pick this up and say, "Listen, if you want to be like Christ, right? In order," which notice how he says this, right? um if we're going to be like him, we must have virtue then, right? So, in other words, if we're going to be like Christ, we have to have power like Christ had. &gt;&gt; We have to have we must have it to be like him. Well, what does the word Christian mean? Right? What does the word Christian mean? It means it was and by the way the Christians did not name themselves Christians. The people named themsel named them Christians, right? The people I believe it was Corinth Corinth was I believe is the is where that was done. I might I got that wrong. Um I'm sure a Sunday school teacher can correct me. Um but either way it was in a Greek city where the where they were first called Christians. And it wasn't they were they were called Christians. Not that they called themselves Christians, but that the people were able to the people around them were rec recognized that whatever was in Christ is in these people. &gt;&gt; Right? That's what you know. And so if you're going to be like Christ, how in the world did the did the people recognize that they were the same thing as Christ? How did they recognize that? you know, it wasn't it wasn't that um you know, it wasn't because you know, yes, Jesus was a was a a a very good man and just he was a he was a a loving person. There were many loving people that did not go before him, right? That did not spread his name far and wide. There's a Greek city far away from Jerusalem had heard of Jesus. And it wasn't because, you know, Jesus cared for people and and ate dinner with the the outcasts. That's not what spread his name far and wide. What spread his name far and wide is that he fed 5,000. He there were there were works that accompanied who he was. There was vindication and power that went with that. Right now, like I said, um my job I'm a generator mechanic. Um, and that word dynam, right? I said it also is where we get the word dynamo. Well, a dynamo is a generator. That's what it is. It's a fancy word for a generator. And anything from a little pole start, you know, 3 and a half kilowatt pull start that you get from a hardware store all the way up to a multi-megawatt nuclear power plant. Those are all of different scale and scope of dynamo. Dynamo is anything that produces electricity and um or any you know generator of some it generates electricity. I guess technically a battery is technically generator but it's that's not really what it's not really a dynamo per se. Um but any kind of generator and that's what I work on every day. Now I also know that the reason why I'm kind of uh making this point about um power is because when you're talking about a generator um notice when I said the scale of it right you can have a 3 and a half kilowatt all the way up to a multimegawatt. Well, the watt rating is the measure of power output. Specifically, it's a scientific word, like the scientific term, the word power, right? There's a there's a scientific definition for that. Um, and what power is scientifically is the ability to convert energy or rather potential into work. There's actually another another the science uses another word work, right? There's a scientific definition for that. It's not just, you know, what um a lot of people don't do. Um the the right so what work is scientifically is the ability to affect change on the world. That's what it is. So realistically to kind of sum all that up. In other words, what we are measuring the the the power output of a generator is how much um capacity that machine has to convert energy into productive output and affect change on the world. &gt;&gt; Right? Another way to another way to phrase this into into you know maybe analogy that a little more familiar if another another measure of hor of uh power is horsepower. We're a little more familiar with this. You can take a big truck and the amount of the fuel capacity. You you don't measure how powerful a truck is by how big the gas tank is, right? You don't measure it by how loud it is. You don't measure it by um you know a lot of things. What you measure you don't measure by the wheelbase. what you measure the truck by is how big of a load it can haul, right? That that's what we're, you know, when you look at a Ford F-150 versus an F-250 versus an F350, all that that number increase is the is the difference and how big of a load you can set in the back of that thing, right? Is how big of a, you know, what's the tow capacity. That's what we that's what we care about if you're buying a truck. Unless you're just in it for the aesthetics, in which case, why are you buying a truck? Um, I always, this always bugs me. And you see all these guys with the the big lift kit and the shiny rims and the lights and all that stuff. And like what? Why did you buy a truck, man? You can't even You can't put a couch in that thing. What are you talking about? Go throw go throw a half a ton of of uh of you know gravel in the back of that truck and go unload it and see how much you like it after that. Um uh anyhow um so so the point is so that's what power is, right? That's what what a what a generator does. It has power output. And that power output is the ability to affect change on the world, right? We're measuring the size of a generator not by, like I said, not by how loud it is, not by how um how much fuel it consumes, not the footprint, not how much horsepower the engine has, but we're we're measuring it by how many light bulbs can this thing turn on, how many air conditioners can it turn on, how big of a machine can run off of this generator. If you're talking about like a uh you know, a lot of job sites will have those big um portables or mobile technically. There's a big mobile generator, you know, um, how many welding rigs can this thing fire up? How many, you know, what's the, you know, how many electric jackhammers can this thing run? This is this is this is what we we care about when we're talking about a generator because the generator, the whole purpose of it is it's going to have productive work that has to come out of it. It's got to produce something. And so likewise, you know, we take this and we talk about with when Jesus is saying, you will be imbued with power from on high. You know, that doesn't mean you will have a big church meeting. You'll have a big jumping up and down move of the spirit. It's not what he's saying. He's saying you will be imbued with something that's going to produce something in the world. It's going to have productive output. It's not just going to be um you know, it's not just going to be a bunch of hype. It's not going to be a bunch of emotional workup. It's not just going to be, you know, and and see that's ultimately that's where brother Brandham had his big break with the Pentecostals in the in the early 1900s because they focused on Acts chapter 2 where they spoke in tongues. They they went out, they were preaching on the streets, they had this big outpouring of the spirit and that's good. That's wonderful. And we I don't have anything against that obviously. Um brother Brand didn't have anything against that. Um, but ultimately if that's as far as it went, if they had had their big church meeting and then and then nothing after that, then what was the point? So what? I mean, you can get an emotional work up at a ball game. You can get an emotional workup. I've been to rock concerts and had emotional workup, right? You can do you can get an emotional workup in a lot of things, right? You go talk to some of the missionaries who have been out to um you know in Africa and in India and some of these places where you got you know you got the witch doctors beating the drums and people do all kinds of stuff. If all we're in it is for emotional workup you know I mean if if if that's what if that's what we want. I mean you you look at even in the in the the secular the secular world or not secular I'm sorry um the nominal Christian world where you have a lot of these you know sort of u nominally nominally Christian they're a lot of them are if not outright Pentecostal have their roots in Pentecostal churches part of the charismatic moves a lot of them are non-denominational but you could watch videos of these people and they'll get the band out there and the you know working the people up get the the the you know the bass guitar bumping and the the the drums pounding and and people will get up on their on their feet and dancing and and waving their arms and you can look at them and it's not it's not um it's not fake. They're not just they're not just putting on they they really mean what they're doing, but you can tell that there's no real power in it. They they all all the women are are are dressed immorally and got their haircut. All the men are are um you know, you talk to them after after the the church is over. You know, you I'm sure we've all met people like this. You you know, they they'll go they'll be all worked up in some emotional workup during church, but as soon as they hit the back door, they'll go back to whatever heistic lifestyle they've got, right? You know, I I um as I said um I think I said this last time, you know, the great um the great world traveling international missionary, Brother Dale Smith once told me that it doesn't matter how, you know, because people will measure the the success of a camp meeting or a church meeting or a youth camp or whatever by how high the people jumped, like were the people jumping. He goes, "I don't care if they jumped." That's good. He goes, "But ultimately what I care about is do they walk straight when they hit the ground?" Right? There has to be some productive output to this. If all you've got is a lot of noise, if all you've got is a lot of of charisma, a lot of emotional release that you're not a Christian, right? Because remember, put it like this. The definition of a Christian is somebody who lives a life that is like under Christ. And if it is like Christ and if it is true Christian, it will follow the same pattern that it did in the Bible, which was the people around you will be able to tell. They will know that you're a Christian, right? You didn't have to, right? They they knew that those people were Christians before the word Christian even was invented, &gt;&gt; right? They in had to invent a whole new word to explain what these people were. And so, you know, if if what we're doing if if our if our religion is not producing that, we got a problem, right? What are we doing here? If we're not being Christians, if it's not producing a lifestyle that the people around you can look at you and say, "Wow, whatever is inside of you has produced a work in you has produced you do things the way Christ did them." Right? you you there is something that's causing you to live and behave in a way that is beyond what just simply some psychology can produce, right? You know, um here's I'll give you another kind of an example. Um you take like the 12step programs like AA or um Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous and these different ones, you know, addiction recovery programs. I don't have anything against them. I know several people who've been greatly helped by those programs. Um but and and frankly there's a and if you look at them um so I'm sure everyone's if you're familiar with these at all um you know the the first step is admitting that you have a problem and I don't remember if it's the second step or third step but it's it's one of the one of the first couple is um submitting yourself to a higher power &gt;&gt; right the even within those programs they recognize and by the way these programs the reason why I'm mentioning them is because the 12step programs are the single best sort of um uh secular psychology mechanism in the world for um addiction recovery. They they have the best success rate of anybody and even they have to admit that you have to submit yourself to a higher power. That's why most of these programs are held in like church basement and things like that. Um because it's directly connected to some sort of uh most of the people who go through those programs end up some form of um nominal Christian or at least um God conscious some kind. you you have to according to the program. But those programs, the best that they can produce, not a single one of them ever claim to cure an addict. Not one of them claim a to cure addiction. Um, in fact, they tell you off the right off the front, you know, right off the front page, you will never be a recovered addict. You will be an addict the rest of your life. That's the best they can offer you. And that and and it's right there. Everybody knows, right? You have to you have you can never quit AA. You're always in it forever because the minute cuz anyone you can you can have kicked a bottle for 15 20 years and you go through one bad spell, a loved one passes, you know, some you know your business blows up, something happens, some event happens and you're right back down the rabbit hole, &gt;&gt; right? You're right. You will go right back and and anybody no matter how long they've been, you know, recovered can always relapse. And that's why they never offered because what happened was they never offered deliverance. All they offered was remission. &gt;&gt; They they that's the and that's the best psychology can offer anybody, you know, because and that's what that's what just psych that's the best psychology can offer. But what what God offers, what the spirit offers is an actual work of deliverance, right? an actual work of deliverance where it's not you don't have to you know you know aa can can can kind of help you uh silence the monkey on your back but only God can get it off your back &gt;&gt; right there there's a different there's a difference between just simply producing some change in your life you know some some hard work you know some work ethic and actual deliverance actual changing what's down on the inside and so that's I guess a good place. So, stop. I'm out of time. And um we'll uh let's stand and have a word of prayer and we'll dismiss. Father, Lord, we come before you this morning. Hopefully, something that was said would be of benefit to the people. Trust that you would uh have have said something to benefit the people. Lord, that we could hold your hand and know that let your spirit move through us. Let your spirit anoint the word in our hearts to produce a work in us. Father, we could not produce it ourselves. That anything we would produce would be of a failure. But Lord, that what you produce would be right every time and would never fail. So we commit the people into your hands. Commit the service into your hands. It would go into the into the worship service, Lord, and into the into the um the preaching. Father, we trust that your spirit would go before us and that it' be a uh your anointing would be guiding the spirit, guiding the people, bringing us into an atmosphere of of unity, bringing us into an atmosphere of of having a of one mind and one accord that we could all be agreed upon your word this morning that your spirit could move. We ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
