couple of quick announcements i want to make and a couple of prayer requests i want to get to and um let me do that right now first thing i want to do out of the right out of the gate is to welcome a member of the tim sister k and their grandson david happy to have them here with us they were with us here at the minister's meeting yesterday brother tim is our chairman of that uh he over he's a facilitator and so we sure appreciate his labor and all of that amen brother ernest and sister doris in the back there minister also in the meeting yesterday and uh want to greet them in the name lord they're up from brother keith brown's church and um okay i'm getting bombed already okay praise the lord hope that helps and um and then uh are you brother jerry god bless you brother jerry williams happy to have him here he's welder working over in charleston and uh brother dutch scott he um has been in that assembly there and uh so brother dutch uh said he would be coming over working in charleston he's a welder i thought about brother allen i thought wow that's what brother allen does so amen we're happy to have brother jerry with us today if you're a visitor and i'm overlooking you you please forgive me i'm bad to do that amen so um but i don't i even asked brother anthony i don't see anybody else visiting amen but we're happy to have all of you here today uh you heard the announcement about uh financial peace university classes coming is that in august mo you are doing that yeah yeah first six weeks okay that starts up middle of august first of august august five okay at your home perfect so we've been doing that for those of you who don't know we uh when brother kevin sarah were here they did a couple of those for us and uh we're coming up now in our third round we've got a lot of different new people and so it is a phenomenal uh biblical biblical based biblically based uh finances class and it works i'm here to tell you it it is quite astonishing some of the testimonies that we have right here in our own assembly so brother michael and sister wanda having completed that went through it are now authorized to teach it so we're looking forward to that amen a quick announcement please about the um sunday school class not the adult one brother matt excellent job today by the way but uh brother travis's class you know we're we're we're in a bad situation we don't really the fellowship hall is small we're trying to expand it that's coming when we do that we'll have proper sunday school classes in the back and uh but for right now that's the only place brother travis can gather and uh we're getting just adults going in there and camping out please don't do that and if you i get sometimes that you bring food because we love our sunday afternoon fellowship and i do it too i'll bring food in on behalf of sister debbie and stick it in i'm always trying to get there early before travis gets started because i know class it's disruptive when people come in and out you're already underway and so uh the rest of you adults please stay out of there don't go in there at all unless you're taking food and if you take food then take it before brother travis gets started sometimes parents have been known to audit that class i have no problem with that whatever but please don't be in there for any other reasons outside of those thank you kindly amen you'd rather hear it from me than brother luther trust me amen so so we we just want to make that uh make that announcement amen well we sister melissa has made him far more adorable and so we so he's doing good amen and so we're we're happy to have brother luther and he's a one-man show he doesn't have any help so he's stretched pretty thin and i'm not easy to work for i'm very demanding and so brother luther has a hard time keeping up with me uh without having to deal with uh problems with you but he will and so uh if you're if you're caught in that class i've asked brother luther and we'll ask him in front of everybody that he'd just tap you on the shoulder and say please leave you know unless you're a parent auditing this class don't be in here and if you're going to get food in there try your best if you can't it's not a capital crime but we're not going to execute you for it but please try to get in there with your food before that class begins amen we'll get it all worked out we'll have a much smoother operation going forward amen i think that was all of my announcements and welcomings we do have two prayer requests that i wanted to give you before we turn to the word uh sister olivia johnson writes i wanted to request prayer for my health the sister over in atlanta and brother winston's daughter and they um consider but i was talking to brother winston just the other day he said make sure you tell bethel we consider that that's our family amen so amen we feel the same way him and sister elizabeth and the girls and he says she says i want to request prayer for my health i suddenly um had big patches of my hair coming out for seemingly no reason so you sisters know what a trauma please you'll be in prayer for her i'm sure doctors are running tests and have said there's inflammation in my scalp but have not been able to determine the cause or any real solution some uh have even said i may continue to lose hair for a woman it has been difficult and it is something i will not accept i am believing god amen amen that whatever is causing this inflammation and hair loss in my body is healed and my hair returns even healthier like that than before thank you she's thanking you for agreeing says thank you for agreeing with me in prayer um also sister sarah sent to me today sister sarah yance good morning i wanted to put in a prayer request for my dad he's very sick in stage three kidney failure the doctors have told him he needs to be put on dialysis before it goes to stage four but he has refused it and says he wants to die he has uh denounced the message says he doesn't believe it anymore and is going to live the way he wants until his last breath and he'll pray a sinner's prayer boy that's wow that's dicey it's a very sad serious situation please pray he sees reality and hasn't gone too far that he can't be saved before his incomes oh my if you got a dad you know the heart of a child you know for their parent how many agree with our sister uh that the lord will move mightily on that situation um okay all right um so let's turn in our scriptures now and we're going to um i i want to by the help of the lord today continue uh in my study and in my series that i've been covering on the seven vials of revelation it's been exceptionally rewarding to me i trust it has for you as well i've just enjoyed it immensely it's hard to um hard to even you know decide how much i enjoyed it has just meant a massive amount to me and i trust it has to you um brother josh go ahead and put my you have my scripture go ahead and put that up and we we will start to look today and we're gonna we're gonna take another step um we've been through four now i just want to say before i get going that you know there's even going to be some things today that that you might hear me repeat and i'm doing it for emphasis because this is the critical material that i think we need to look at and we need to realize and be aware of the day and hour that we live in do you believe that and so you know god gives us his word for a reason it's not it's not an accident and so he gives us his word for reason all right so from 2nd thessalonians we're going to read a couple of a number of verses there let me turn to it myself so second thessalonians you have it say man it's on the screen if you don't have it but now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus now i want you to pay close attention we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him that you be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of christ is at hand verse 3 let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called god or that is worshipped so that he as god sitteth in the temple of god showing himself that he is god that's an amazing accomplishment we're talking about the devil this is what he has managed to pull off remember you not that when i was yet with you i told you these things and and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time so now we're coming down to the end time verse seven for the mystery of iniquity doth already works it was already moving in the early church only he who now letteth will let uh and brother branham talks about now this is christ in the bride only he who now letteth will let until he christ and the bride be taken out of the way she goes in a rapture all right verse 8 and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders we've talked about the working of devils and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved um i think i'm gonna did i say through verse 12 josh do you remember okay verse 11 and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie and and that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness amen let's let's pray father we love you today we thank you for your great grace lord in our lives and we are trusting you now lord for all things master come to your word now and break the bread of life to us i have lord so much on my heart that i want to say but i more than that i want to say only what you want to say so now may you grant it to me lord and give us that portion of the word that we have need of so desperately today bless all of our visitors in the gate lord may they enjoy your presence with us we commit it to you in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated so i you know i there's some things that we we have said and we'll say again and because as i as i've indicated they are so vital to the day and hour that we live in i believe friends that we must see christ in all of his movements you must stay up on it you must understand what he's doing because what he's every time he takes a step he's moving toward a conclusion and he's moving toward perfection and so we we realize that everything that he's doing is vital and and you know when you were following moses in the wilderness you were the instructions if you were part of the tribes of israel was that you stay close that you stay within earshot of the trumpet because when it came time to move no one knew when it was time no one until the pillar of fire started moving or the cloud started moving and then it was blow a trumpet quickly assemble everybody pack up we're moving he's on the move we got to go now that that was that was already um you know um that was already urgent enough but then if you were outside of earshot if you didn't hear the trumpet and you you didn't you weren't concerned enough to stay close to the ministry and close to where the word was going forth and and it became um you know not so important to you and you allowed your life to move in a haphazard way where excuse me where you would where you would not recognize what you say i recognize my day and its message but but we have to always watch where the i am is and he's always going forward and so he he's come in many forms as we said moses saw him as a as a burning bush he's they saw him as a cloud by day they saw him as a fire by night we find that sometimes he appeared as an angel talking to gideon or talking to the parents of samson he appeared to joshua as a soldier he appeared to abraham as a king see from uh from a city whose builder and maker was god he was the king of salem and so he appeared uh to to israel as a man see he appeared in the upper room as licks of fire and when those licks of fire came into the people now the i am was in them see and so we're always watching he would he would send a messenger in each age and now that's where the i am was because it's never i was or i will be it's always i am right now and so wherever the i am is there is where grace and mercy exist there is no grace and mercy in the i was see and and and you you don't sit back and wait on i will be because you'll as brother jack duff says you're never going to hear the words come up if you don't first hear the words come out amen come out of her my people so you can hear come up higher amen amen so we we were looking and i i want to i want to make just a quick correction i was i was trying to see where i finished up last sunday uh and and i had to do that it's hard as it is on me i can't stand to watch myself ministering on video but i i had to do that because i'm i'm also covering this material on the daily uh internet radio show kind of a thing that we do brother tim and i are on that together teaching and uh and so sometimes i can't remember did i say that on the on the broadcast or did i say that in my pulpit and it's all running together at this point and so i'm trying not to have too much duplicity but one thing i i wanted to clear up is i i heard myself talking about we were talking about zechariah 14 and we showed you the destruction of things that were going on that are going to happen in the tribulation period and remember the earth is split open again jerusalem is divided into three parts the mount of olives comes up uh uh is split right there and so so we find that that then afterwards it talks about when is that going to happen it says in the day when it won't be day or night it'd be like a dismal day you can't call it day or night but at the evening time it shall be light now i was using that to indicate to you that that that's another sign among the many that we've shown you and why on the authority of prophecy and the authority of brother branham and his message over and over again we can effectively say that all of the trumpets and vials and seals and they've all been playing in history and but when we come to the end time we find after the bride goes home then those seven vials pour out in their fullness but you you don't want to lose sight of the fact that they're having a partial influence on the earth now but i but i but and i've taught it that way very clearly but at the same time i found myself saying to you to the effect of we see that these these plagues are falling before the rapture and what i meant was that partially we're feeling the effects of it it's not in the fullness until the bride is gone amen amen and then i i think i heard myself excuse me my voice will get good in a minute here i'll blow through it i think i ended up referring to a sorority and calling it a fraternity i didn't mean to do that it's one's what guy's doing one's what we were talking about the bride of christ remember that we talked about the the the things that she went through and you know sometimes as an infant bride she barely could walk even when a prophet went home you know she she was still she was still barely a toddler she's an infant when when the seals are are being opened and and then we talked about going into the 70s and all the different camps you know because now she's grown a little more but then we go into the 70s and got all the different splits all different camps and all different nonsense and i said well that's what junior high school girls do they divide and split and have clicks and and and you know and and then you then when they even when they grow up and go to college then you know they're in this sorority or that sorority and this one against that one and your mascot against my mascot but the point we were making is the bride is done with that and she's not interested in kingdom building of men she's not interested in super sensationalism of of men's ideas now we are very much for the power of the living god and i believe it ought to it ought to be a it ought to be a fire breathing experience in our lives that produces a fire-breathing life amen and so but we but we don't chase sensations as a as a prime target we realize that signs follow the bride she doesn't chase after them so we were talking about that we don't chase after super things like that brother branham taught us better than that and so we find now when we when we start breaking into our into our quotes and today uh we're moving from in the seven vials of revelation and uh i wonder how that got up there already let's see are we okay there's why it was starting right there the seven vials of revelation and then based on my text that i read here is where we're covering today the restraining powers and it's and i've said a little bit about it and i remember saying things about it here and on the air and uh but i wanna i wanna really zero in on it a little bit today and i'm hoping i can get through all this and not uh run myself out of time so i'm gonna try to go studiously and you just stay with me don't drift or you'll get lost in the shuffle and i don't have time to recover you so so we come here now and now remember remember this is brother brennan's series where he's came home from jeffersonville and he's gonna his burden on his heart is the is to teach on the vials he wants a school he wants a building where he can break it down like the seals uh he wanted to do that with the trumpets as well it wasn't it wasn't given to him the lord wouldn't allow it that way so but he what he does do is take eight or nine services and he preaches on things that are relevant to you and me in our daily lives that the that the influence of the seventh vial is trying to hinder and so you remember it was released into the air and that's exactly what brother branham we read it to you last week where he said you know he threw a rock up in the air and and he says the judgments now have begun they're here they're now they're already started and they'll lead all the way to the end all right so so so this is why when we're looking at these quotes we've already well established this is part five if you've missed any of the others go back and get them we've already established the symbolism we've already we've already correlated it with history we've already showed you the connection between seals trumpets and vials and woes so so what i want to really make this more about from here on is what is the impact on our lives if this seventh vial is now influencing the world then what do i need to be on my guard for right so brother branham says here this is the second sermon uh or the first if you count it as i count it as ashamed being the first you you could you could say ashamed was where he announces it that's fine but we had a lot of good quotes and ashamed also so he says here he says now don't this is where we ended last time don't take something new they're flying everywhere and there'll be more than that come but don't take new things the lord your god has declared to you what is truth now here's a point we've made i'm pretty sure i made it to you and i want to emphasize it a little stronger today that we're at a time now that jesus prophesied the day is coming and he says it there at the well the day is coming and now is but it's also coming when they that worship him must worship it won't matter jerusalem or samaria uh but you're gonna have to worship him in spirit and truth and your your location isn't gonna mean a lot to you if you if you if you don't accept the word in its in its fullness in the immediacy of the time you live in and that was his message to that woman she said we know messiah is coming he first had to get her to understand he's not coming he's here i am he we know when messiah cometh he'll tell us these things jesus said i'm i'm the one i'm the messiah and so it's it's a changing of dispensation where excuse me i am so sorry where sixteen hundred years of new of old testament law and sacrifice was about to be was about to be swept aside so swept aside that it not only wouldn't do you any good but it would actually hold you back from going forward see and this is what paul was constantly over the jews because they were always trying to go back and hold on to circumcision and hold on to this and hold on to that and paul said if you hold on to those things you're you're you're making the cross of no effect see it does you no good because the dispensation is moving that god that dwelt over israel is now trying to dwell inside of a people and that is coming again at the end time that's a prophecy all right so he says so now there's a lot to be said about spirit and truth and that's where we are today and that's why we call it that's exactly why we call it a message of the hour amen you see it's people say what is the message of the hour my answer is just god keeping his word it's not a new it's not something different it's not another gospel it's just that prophecy told us that the true gospel once the apostles died would be lost that's in the bible it's all through the bible and then it actually describes the ages and you can go back and overlay history and see it hit right on the money they fell away and went into the dark dark ages but he said i will restore it in stages and he did amen and i'll i'll i'll raise up and and there's and that's why in the book of revelation there's such an emphasis on those last three angels to the church ages because there through lutheran wesley and elijah that we believe to be william branham he's going to bring back the full restoration of the bride tree with fruit in the top of the tree and the sun shining on it ripening it see so so we got no time to be school children anymore we got no time for kingdom building anymore we got no time for this camp or that camp and we got no time for carnality and being indulging in the world it's going home time amen so we have arrived at the hour of the return of spirit and truth so that we could worship god in spirit and truth and it is only the gospel that brings that and that's what the message of this hour is is a restoration of that gospel it's not something different so he says the lord your god has declared to you what truth is the lord your god has vindicated boy and how what truth is by his word and by his spirit and i'm not just talking about the inexplicable miracles in the tens of thousands that went on around the world over 33 years of ministry so much so that you you would if you combined all of the supernatural of all of the faith healers of brother branham's era all of his peers if you combined all the supernatural of their ministry it would hardly fill a thimble compared to the supernatural that occurred on a daily basis in the ministry of william brother but all that aside all that aside our our faith in this word is not about that our faith in this word that we know it's the time of spirit and truth is is that it has called us out of the world and separated us and filled us with a burning desire to be like christ to be like the word and we look at the world systems and we don't want that amen see because the prophecies tell us that people at the end time well heap to themselves teachers with itching ears you're going i can tell you friends this is why the new birth is so important because you're going to believe the gospel that you're going to believe the version that there's a lot of versions of the gospel there's only one true gospel you're going to believe and follow the version that you want to be true and if you want a gospel that allows you to live carnal in the world and still claim to be a christian i promise you there's a gospel for you it's not the original one it's another jesus not the one paul priest paul said i'm afraid you're going to have another jesus and it won't be the one i preached to you to be a different one see and so this is why you have to have a nature change or all you'll do is because people are going to believe what they want to hear that's how con men work they tell people what they want to hear and people who believe it and people who want who want the gospel they want it to be true that i can just live any old way and it doesn't matter and satan will make sure that you get a gospel called that but this is the hour of spirit and truth that's turning men and women into the image of jesus christ in the last days so believe a watered-down version to your own demise believe it at your own peril see you know i i'll just say it plain if you follow a watered-down version of this message you're going to go to hell you hear it hear it on the internet whoever might be listening you're absolutely going to miss a rapture and you're very likely going to end up in a lake of fire because what it what how how you gonna miss it if you spurn the grace and the mercy that's in the word for this hour see i promise you your good works won't save you they're done in iniquity see i get that there's good people who don't know it but if you look at those people those are sanctified they call them the bible calls them saints it means sanctified means they're righteous they have a righteousness uh in their works and the king recognizes that and calls them righteous and calls them saints see but don't don't that's that's the remnant of the woman's seat don't try to attach that to the tommy rod out here that we see in excuses for christianity that that's that's the kind of stuff that's going to put you in the line of atomic fodder for a nuclear age all right so we have no apology for that all right and it's time to say it plain say why do you say it to a church full of believers because i know what especially i know what our young people are hearing out there and there's a group whispering in their ear telling them it's okay you don't have to be all that intense you know we we have a different version of the message there ain't no different version there's only an eternal version and it's the same yesterday today and forever see so thank god for the mercy and the grace of god amen and and so he goes on to say boy just use a quarter of my time and have harley got going so he says here let's go on so the lord your god has declared to you what truth is the lord your god has vindicated what truth is by his word and by his spirit not by power not by might but by my spirit and the spirit god seeks those who worship him in spirit uh and and uh let me catch it here see in spirit and truth thy word is truth and he has thoroughly vindicated that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he has shown the evening seats to you he has revealed it to you in the word he has proven it to you by his spirit so he has shown it to you in the word and you have become privy to the most wonderful truths that the world you're guaranteed to hear things that you'll never hear in the average sunday morning pulpit anywhere in the world but he's not only given it to you in the word he's actually vindicated it in your life by his spirit anointing that word in your life see so so he he has proven it to you by his spirit now brother branham goes on here now watch all right let me let me let me before i go to that i want to make a an entry a an entry statement an introduction to this next quote i've said it i said it minutes ago and i want to really make sure your attention is focused because i've said to you that the reason for brother branham preaching these vile series though he doesn't call him that is to show us what the devil is trying to do so now whatever we read on here is to counter what he's trying to do so you then be will be able to deduce by what you read what he's up to and you've got a prophet about to warn you don't fall for it all right now here's one of the here's a here's a here is a remedy here is a medicine here is an antidote here is a vaccine against the the this airborne uh infection that the seventh seal released into the air it's causing people to do a certain thing and it's bringing disruptions in homes disruptions in churches disruptions in marriages churches split marriages split homes split teenagers split i mean it's terrible and satan is always trying to divide you know you don't don't forget this young people listen young people god bless you you know you who are single just remember brother jason said this that that sometimes if you're found in a situation and as your young men and young women your mom and dad can't always be watching and they they shouldn't need to see and so you've got to be able to stand on your own two feet after a certain age but just remember you can get caught in a certain situation and satan will try to tempt you into doing things that are contrary to god's word boy with a girl girl with a boy you follow what i'm saying i just want you to remember that the very same devil the very same one the very same demon that is trying to drive you together before marriage in a way that shouldn't happen will be the exact same demon who tries to drive you apart after you're married don't you forget it it's exact same demon all right so he says here now watch he says here we go here's a you ready for an antidote to the madness of the world brother branham says live humble that is so important say that's pretty simple he put it in his seven vial series that's how important it is he put that in his seven vial series the burden of his heart is the seven vials and he says this is the second message live humble live loving love one another don't never get nothing among you if you see something coming up in your heart against somebody get it out of there right then don't let and satan will do his best to get among you see don't let that happen we don't want no malice we don't want no strife we want god and he is the word see this this assembly and other different assemblies are growing this needs to be remembered constantly satan won't just try he'll try his best i mean he's coming with the with the with the full package see now so brother branham goes on watch and now he's in a prayer here's what we desire all right i think you'll agree with this heal the sick and the afflicted lord we pray may there not be a feeble person in our midst because of your presence lord now how many want his presence may our hearts continually be set on thee and we know lord that money property things of the world i read this last time have no meanings just so temporal all of them must go see this is this is seven vial medicine this is your antidote to the to the plague that's released into the air and is affecting the whole world and all of your surroundings yes see every every everything you do your job is being affected by the vials your places of recreation don't forget your fashions your entertainments please don't forget there's a there's an infection in the air and it's poisoning everything you contact in this world say i can't go out of the world no you can't go out of the world but you've got to be an overcomer of these things see and you'll never overcome it having doubt in the word see they all must go brother branham goes on our jobs our places our friends everything must go no matter how rich how poor how popular isn't this amazing this is seventh vile antidote see it's to counter what's happening no matter how popular or unpopular we are it all must go but there is only one thing that our being here is centered around and that's jesus christ so god let us lay aside you noticing how many times like paul is using the word let like paul said lay aside brother branham says let us lay aside brother branham says the devil will try his best don't you let that happen let the mind which was in christ be in you see so he says there's only one thing that our being here is centered around and that's jesus christ so god let us lay aside everything as secondarily and hold to him and he is the word do you believe that see so we have we have come to the woes i think this one darkens you so we have come then to the woes and the seals and the trumpets and the vials and we found out from our quotes that they're all happening in a cluster and that's what people are missing and and and they all have their partial work on this side of the tribulation we've demonstrated that in history brother branham tied it very directly on tape to to historical events and and and but they we realize then that they continue on until we reach fullness in the tribulation when the bride is gone and so you've got a cup of iniquity that we talked about being full as it relates at least i'm i'm sure the world can get much more evil before we get out of here but as far as denominations are concerned organized religion that cup of iniquity is done god's already it doesn't matter build as many denominations as you want he don't regard them you don't have anything to do with them he's not in them see people go in there and read they carry your their same bible in there sing the same songs but god is finished completely done with organized religion see that cup of iniquity that ship has sailed all right so we find then that that that that it's time now for the word and the word alone so the sin and the perversion this is because of this plague released in the air this is what's causing the sin and the perversion in the minds of humanity and there's some natural things causing it too going to connect quite a bit to matthew sunday school here in just a few minutes something brother branham said he says now so so we're finding that that wants these things and and this is this is an important point now let me just let me just crystallize all right once these things began to unfold and they did they have already then then then humanity as i said last time would would need to reevaluate its future the woes when the woes began the first whoa of world war one you you find that the woes were actually uh uh they were uh they were actually a harbinger of doom unrecognized by the world see now i'm not of course i'm not talking about you know the awfulness of world war but i'm talking about a sequence of events that had begun uh you know as we start to look at prophecy you have this sequence of events uh you know that had begun to to herald what what we would call you know uh an end of time sequence uh there's a sequence an end of time sequence and you find that that got started it started approaching under the fourth trumpet historically and then by the time you get to the fifth trumpet and we've talked about this there's where satan was cast down and a bottomless pit was opened and brother branham points back to that now and says the lid is torn from hell and demon powers are streaming into the earth that's been going on for a long time see and we've we found out that that that's why he ra started the azusa revival and all and both of those that fifth trumpet and that is who's a revival to because when uh when the enemy raises comes in like a flood god raises a standard but we find that that that when when all of that is happening you know and the and that's right before world war one that's right before world war one see and you you have to you have to know how to connect all the dots between revelation 9 and revelation 7 and different things like that and you've got these angels standing on the four winds and uh and though and the walls are now coming and we realize that that that that in plain language you know the wall the first wall was the beginning of an extinction event that we call armageddon and it would have just carried on the first wall would have went to the second would have went to the third and would have annihilated all living things from the surface of the earth but but god has an angel rising out of the east with the seal of god of course it's christ he's the only one who can give you the seal he rises out of the east having the seal of the living god and he puts a a pause because he's got children down in there but but eventually the second woe is going to come and eventually the bride's going to leave and moses and elijah are going to go forward and they're going to kill them and they're going to lay in the streets of jerusalem dead and we find that the bible says now that marks the end of the second woe and behold the third woe cometh quickly so so so this global event that would sweep mankind and all living things from the face of the earth you know where what what remained of humanity's future was now very very short because now we've had the day star we've had the light of another day there's another day coming that's why it's so dark there's another day pressing on the darkness see that's why the earth is transitioning they want to they want to blame whatever fossil fuel you know for global warming i don't know what's causing global warming i just know the earth is transitioning all nature's groaning because it knows its day of release is coming hallelujah nature's already transitioning it's going to melt off those places that's melting the polar caps it ain't going to need them it ain't going to need on the polar caps keep our temperatures from getting too hot we're not going to need that in the millennium the world's going to write itself and nature's going to be back in harmony again hallelujah and those ice fields will be tropical beautiful lush forest like they were before the ice fields were there not afraid of global warming let it come it's the earth changing i'm changing too hallelujah the earth's headed for a a rest day oh i've already got my rest day now i'm looking for that new body hallelujah so god wraps up you know a rapture cycle which is of course already underway and then the bride is taking a secret catching away and from that point humanity has 42 months and counting it's like a clock like a stopwatch and every day they get a little closer and there's not they they they can't they can't call time out once that happens see because because once god started dealing with israel in the end time sequence of events the clock started again because that's always been his timepiece see and so so we find then that that you know the earth has gone into this effect of the tree of knowledge of good and evil on society and we learned by prophecy that that evil would accelerate very quickly and you can look at at all kinds of data we could put it up here for you today showing you the the precipitous fall of of morals uh that happened right right at right right after right is that fourth and fifth trumpet are sounding and the sun is going dark and the moon won't shine and stars are falling and brother branham is identifying that as christ being rejected and the church going dark and sons of god are falling for it and since that time of the turn of the century and brother branham said we've spent millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars and we've had programs all over the world but it's not getting better it's getting worse and now it's gotten much worse these things are not an accident friend you are the generation that are going to see the coming of the lord you're the generation upon the bible says upon whom the ends of the world have come hallelujah i'm so glad to be a part of that generation oh my and so the whole world as we said last time being led down the primrose path a primrose path is a is a phrase coined and it just means a path of ease but it really goes into a path of ease or a path of pleasure especially sensual pleasure and that's where the world has completely went off the deep end and it couldn't stop with just you know sensual pleasures it it finally got to the point where it was so twisted and now it is so twisted it defies it defies our imagination that it is what it is i mean you say people can't be that insane yet they are you know as we we talked about it last time an eight-year-old boy gets out of bed one day and says i think i'm a girl today and and you've got parents who support him in that you've got a social media who applaud him you've got a government who passed laws to protect him you've got courts who enforce things upon good people who take a stand against that stuff you think that's an accident that wasn't globally like that until this last day until this end time sequence of events begin to transpire let me tell you let me ask you a question once the the the end time events are bracketed in time they have a starting time and an ending time how much time do you think is in there between when they start and when it's over i'm here to tell you we've already came more than a hundred years since it got rolling before the first world war then brother branham talks about i know it could be another hundred years it's already been a hundred years since that time say we've already more than a half a century past the seals being open oh look up your redemption draweth nigh [Applause] there's a time for young people to be serious about their experience with god you're going to have to have that token you're going to have to have a personal experience with christ say i don't think i have that then ask him for it ask him for it i say jesus give me a personal experience with you because i i'm convinced by the preaching of the word that there's not much time left and i don't want to miss it lord i don't want to miss it hallelujah this is a time for parents to be on fire for parents to be zealous for parents to set the right kind of standards in the home amen oh my so now we've arrived at the breaking of these things and we've been emphasizing to you how that acceptance by god and any victory you hope to have in the holy spirit do you hope to have some amen it's all now being housed in true worship in spirit and truth and outside of that you're i mean you know this has broad applications even for grace and mercy which we're going to talk about just a little bit you know where is the mercy seat i'll tell you this much it's not a piece of furniture all right and uh there's the grace of god but who who has access to grace oh we were so blessed yesterday brother stan was here and and giving me a little bit of uh giving our little group we had a breakfast and then we were here in the in the main service uh time and then in the evening there brother brad's house and he was talking about this whole idea of grace and i i dove into that last night by the tim i found all of that material and it all checks out 100 and i i'm gonna get to it just in a minute but but we find out that you know the the bible talks about the grace of god hath appeared to all men because really friends it when it comes to the grace of god now we're not talking about it's the mercy of god say are they different well they are because brother branham said you can exhaust the mercy of god but you can't exhaust the grace of god as a child of god you can keep transgressing and keep transgressing and god will keep warning you and sending preachers to preach to you and convicting you and waking you up and telling you want to do that and finally you'll exhaust his mercy and he'll wear you out for it but but if you're a child of god if you've got a gene of god you can never exhaust his grace i can never make myself not a child of god because i came from god i go back to god so my my my pre my debt my predestined place is where i started it's not where am i going it's where did i begin see and there's where grace because when it comes to the grace of god you're going to find out that it's exclusive god has mercy on the whole world and offers and through his grace and mercy saves the sinner and and and brings people to salvation from destruction but the grace that is is is for redemption is only brother branham said only the predestinated are considered in redemption amen see and so you say but grace appears to all men of course it does now you know be careful because you'll trap yourself because it appears to all men and what is grace what does that grace do it teaches you to deny ungodliness that's the whole reason disgrace is a thing see because the whole reason there's grace and disgrace is that disgrace means you never have come under grace you've never been born again of the spirit of god and so when you live that way you say oh you're turning grace into disgrace no you're not you're a sinner you need you need the holy ghost you need to be born again see and so so when we look at these things we find our lives then through true worship you know in spirit and in truth in our lives that are transformed into the living word and so so that's why we have you know a major part of the mystery of the of the rapture is the word living behind skin the word living inside your flesh all right and we i remember saying to you one time previous that that this this being true then no wonder it calls for a total separation from unbelief that's the age and the hour that we live in see and and and and while grace is god you know grace appeared to all men but the bible teaches us in ephesians 4 that grace is apportioned it's apportioned yeah it goes to all men but it's apportioned it's if you know god god has a has a family and that he's that he's here to find those names on the lamb's book of life and that's what that grace is for see and only when you're born again of the spirit of god by a gene of god then you're under that grace see all right i'm getting ahead of myself and i'm not going to give you a clear picture we'll get to in a minute i hope so so we let me come back to our quotes now so brother branham let me see where did i finish up here so we already looked at live at other times about how that um you know it's it's it's an advantage to you to be in a in a close relationship with god we talked about brother i'm told the story of the man who and his boy was dying and and the brothers they all gathered around to pray and god spared the little boy's life and brother bran talks about now look at what look what would have happened that boy was dying and doctors couldn't save him how big of an advantage was it that he had that kind of relationship with the lord and see this is why brother branham said there's things coming on the earth friends and this was a half century ago there's things coming on the earth why do you why do you preach perfect faith because you're going to need it see and perfect faith comes with fellowship and relation with christ it's all it's it's in it's embedded in relationships see and so that and to prove that i mean just think about the spouse that you love where does your confidence where's your faith in that spouse come from because of the level of relationship that's what did it see and so i i know that that if i can't trust a human in the world i can trust my wife if i couldn't trust anyone because i i have that kind of level of relationship i know she'll never leave me or forsake me that's how it is with christ when he says i'll never leave you nor forsake you and people sometimes can get in such a dark place because they say but he said he would never leave me nor forsake me but that's tied up in relationship see and and that that that's that's directly proportioned to that and you don't have much release of a relationship then you're not you're you don't you don't need to look for the peace that passes understanding it ain't it ain't coming your way you don't need to uh you know think well i you know i got something that's gonna drive fear out of me i got something listen friends it's all tied up in the relationship you have with the word and so so brother branham talks about there and i don't i didn't put it on the overhead you know god had his loyal servants there for brother blair and them to pray for the little boy when he was in that condition when anything happens remember remember when anything happens and you got that kind of relationship just remember you're a child of god you don't have to take that from the devil you're a child of god amen amen when when the devil attacked sister kathy she had really a little chance to live i mean the the things that was happening to our sister in rapid succession but brother jack wouldn't take it he refused to take it he would not accept it and he he he took jurisdiction over the enemy and took jurisdiction over those things and every every doctor kept saying it's bad it's bad until the last doctor said mister uh guess we can't find anything wrong with your wife come get her hallelujah [Applause] see and so when anything happens remember you're the children of god now this comes into uh restraint and i'm if i don't just do it the way i'm about to do it and i promise the lord i would i'd follow his lead i want to take you through and do it methodically but i i'm i'm feeling not urged to not do it that way i'm just going to give you the burden on my heart about it it's the theme of this sermon today that it's about contrast okay now let me just help you with contrast okay couple examples we could think of when when the children of israel were leaving in the exodus there was darkness throughout egypt but there was light in goshen when they went into the wilderness and they're fleeing and and and they got trapped in in the in the in the in the geography and that moses ran them into a boxed in area where they were they were trapped by the red sea and mountains on all sides in israel i mean and egypt thought we got them well good grief every military strategist would say that we got them now we're going to annihilate them we but but god came down in that pillar of fire and stood in the in the way and it was just the same god but on this side to the egyptians he looked like thick darkness and they were afraid on this side of it it was bright light shining light and the children of israel were comforted by that see and so so you're always going to have that contrast we've talked about the contrast of the tower of babel how that god comes in there and they're they're in one mind and one accord and god's going to actually use a trick that satan has used and that is to cause confusion and god takes away their common language and their common uh you know mind they had one mind they were in one mind they had one language and one speech meant one mind and one accord spoke the same language and god confused them and what did it do it scattered them see and so so then you see god bringing that exact thing in the upper room one mind and one accord and then satan seeing that and remembering that said okay i know how to handle that i'll just start bringing confusion among the people and so he brings confusion in your life he hits you with sickness he troubles your children he troubles your finances he does all he has problems in churches and problems in ministry and problems in marriages and what's what's he doing he's trying to counter god's effort to make you of one mind and one accord because in there all things are possible hallelujah so naturally he's going to try to hinder marriages naturally he's going to try to get at you through your kids naturally he's going to try to use preachers and use churches and and he's going to do everything he can because his is the contrast he's they're doing the same thing in opposite directions and it's all about the greatest battle ever fought in your mind it's control of the mind of man see and that's why you're going to need supreme thought control at the end time i don't mean psychology i mean you're going to have to have faith in the word of god and no matter what you see no matter what's happening you're going to control your mind you're going to say whatsoever things are good and what sort of things are lovely and whatsoever things are pure and whatsoever things are of a good report i'm going to think on these things what are you going to do with the bad i'm going to cast down vain imaginations i'm going to throw out anything that exalts itself against the word of god see so so we find it rolling in this way and and so brother branham says i think i have it right here where did i pick up all right i see that let me come to where i need to be i'm gonna i'm gonna lose my place and i'm not gonna get to this point the lord's drilling holes in me i want you to understand that he that letteth christ will let will hold will restrain the antichrist until he the holy ghost and the bride that's son of man ministry son of man ministry see some don't confuse son of man office that's a prophet but the the whole purpose of the holy ghost was to create a son of man ministry that's the word made flesh so god bookends it he sends a prophet in the alpha and that prophet gives them a word in spirit and truth and they become by the baptism of the holy ghost the word made flesh god does the same thing when he's restoring it he sends a prophet in the office of son of man and when that prophet gives us a message of the hour this is why you should never water it down he's bringing you the very thing to make you the living word the whole thing is not to make you a theologian and to fill up your computer you know with all kinds of uh memory verses and memory quotes and satan don't care how religious you are and he don't even care how right and correct and accurate you are in your teaching what he knows is is that if you miss the life you won't come up anyway don't get played by the devil come on young people don't get played by the devil don't fall for that nonsense god has sent the word of deliverance in this hour he sent a word that will bring the baptism of the holy ghost i've had it happen friends i've had it happen on more than a few occasions just like in the book of acts uh while peter yet spake these words i've been preaching and not calling a prayer line not praying for anybody just while i was preaching young people jumping up filled with the holy ghost sinners coming in off the street hear a few words and fall down and repent people sicknesses deliverance depression oppression delivered in a moment wow he yet speak these words you can believe today that while the word is going forth it is able more than able it's anointed of the holy ghost and it's accurate by a prophet hallelujah we have the world the devil's answer hallelujah put your confidence in it put your whole heart in it give your whole life to it it'll get you home it'll put you on my front porch hey man you want to sit on my front porch and talk about they used to be chris uh we'll we'll sit someday on the other side and we'll we'll laugh and shake our heads at all the meanness that went on in there used to be oh hallelujah so so you have to understand god is using that to restrain the antichrist his life living through you puts the word in flesh and restrains the beast amen see but now we found out now that's what we read today but we found out also when we read the book of romans 1 18 i think that that we find that there are men in the world who hold the truth in unrighteousness which not the same word they resist they restrain they restrain the truth from being made manifest and you know how they do it by unrighteousness so now look at this contrast look at the restraint that's why i took a subtitle the restraining powers now you've got a power that is trying to live in you from god that restrains the devil and the devil trying to tease you and entice you into unrighteousness now is trying to use you to restrain god you're talking about a contrast and you're caught in the middle this is the greatest battle ever fought god trying to work through the bride to hold back satan and satan trying to work through that same bride to hold back the plan of god he can't defeat jesus he's already took a weapon every time he tries it he brother ram said he can't stop the word so what does he do he attacks the vessels who carry the word if he can fill up your life with carnality if he can fill up your life with nonsense of the world and laodicea and flu if he can infect you hallelujah friends then he can hold back the power of god from moving in your home and this ain't no time to have the power of god held back in your home there's a time to have a freedom of the holy spirit there's a time to have worship in the home and in the church and in your car and in the schools and everywhere we go this is a time of worship that's a time to operate in spirit and in truth for the hour has arrived for the day is coming and now is i'm here to tell you you're you're in a day that now is that's what satan doesn't want you to realize so he fills up your life and persuades you into unrighteousness and you're playing you're getting played young people you're getting played if you go along with him you're getting played he's trying to use you the bride of christ to hold back the power of god he can't take on god directly see the serpent couldn't come to adam directly adam would have put him in his place immediately so he come to his helpmate so he can't come to christ he's already lost he can't go to the word he's already defeated so what does he do he comes to the vessels that carry it satan knows that you are destined to inherit the throne amen says that important it is for this reason that's the very place he wants to be he said i will ascend i will be like the most high god i will sit like god i will be worshipped like god don't give him your life friends young people don't give him your life don't give in to that married couples don't don't give way to those things bethel tabernacle every church that's out there stay humble stay in love don't let satan's to try his best to come in don't let that happen hallelujah how many say today i'm going to take a stand for the word of god i'll stand for it and let the world go by i'll stand for jesus why don't you stand up with me today say i'll take the way with the lord's despise you i started out with jesus brother jack i'm going through i'm not stopping hallelujah we're too close to home friends these vials are breaking out on the earth they've been breaking out for more than a hundred years these trumpets and vials and viles directly correlated to them giving the antichrist every opportunity to go forward oh but the mighty god has come among us the unveiled the identified christ of all ages do you know him today do you know him do you know him in the fellowship of his sufferings do you know him in the power of his resurrection do you know him in the forgiveness of sins today i begin praying that like a triune prayer i've been saying lord i want to know you in the forgiveness of my sins i want to know you in the power of your resurrection and i want to know you in the fellowship of your sufferings and whatever you got to do and whatever it takes by any means necessary can i get brother andrew to sing a special for me take my houses and lands
