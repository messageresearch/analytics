jesus christ how many feeling good in your spirit hallelujah if you have your bibles amen let's turn to um saint john chapter one saint john chapter 1. i hope you're not reading out of an niv because the scripture won't be in there saint john chapter one verse one let's read in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness in the darkness comprehended it not what a powerful verse the light shineth in darkness in the darkness can't even understand it how many walking in the light the world can't even understand you hallelujah amen let's go to um first john chapter one first john chapter one and we're gonna start at verse six if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin amen may the lord bless reading of his word you can have your seats hallelujah you know by the grace of god i want to use for our topic tonight walk in the light of the word amen walk in the light of the word you know uh we as believers we believe that god is light amen now we're not talking about uh just a physical light like that but we're talking about a light of truth amen when we speak of god being light we speak of truth amen because what light does light gets rid of all the mystery hallelujah you know if we were to cut all the lights off in here tonight we wouldn't be able to see everything plainly but once we cut the lights on there's no more mystery hallelujah and you know i was telling brother jason it was something he said in the bible study it just kind of stuck with me you know and he was talking about the mystery of god and he says if you are looking at this word of your your you're looking at this message and if it's still a mystery to you you're in darkness hallelujah because it hasn't been revealed but once it's revealed hallelujah you can see it hallelujah that's what the light does the light comes to show you hallelujah what's before you amen so you know in the beginning you know uh if we go to genesis chapter one by the grace of god turn with me to genesis chapter one now the bible says in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and the earth was without form and without void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters now god created but what he created darkness had dominion hallelujah but god being god he couldn't let it stay like that hallelujah so you know when you were born darkness had dominion hallelujah darkness had dominion over you but you know what he wasn't willing to let darkness have dominion over you so you know what the bible says and the spirit of the lord began to move hardly how did it move listen he said then god said let there be light and there was light what did he do when god said let there be light and it was light what did he do he gave the earth truth hallelujah that's what he did when he spoke light on the earth the truth of god began to move what was he he was eternal the truth he was elohim the truth he was the lugos the truth and most of all he was god so when he spoke everything about god began to move on the earth and what was he doing he was clearing up every false conception that was laying there thank you darkness looked like it had dominion until god said let there be light and once he spoke light truth hallelujah began to come forward amen because when that light began to shine hallelujah everything that was laying there in darkness began to grow all right wow hallelujah when god said let there be light what did he do he spoke the truth and as the light began to shine every seed laying dormant in the earth began to grow and as you sit here and listen to the truth everything inside of you that's connected to the light it must grow that's what light does light takes away everything that's false light if oh my that's what i love light will reveal everything that's hidden wow that's why god came and he gave us a message with a messenger hallelujah and when that messenger began to speak hallelujah he was speaking under the inspiration of what truth hallelujah and as he spoke the truth the mystery of your earth began to come forth hallelujah the mystery of who you are it began to rise hallelujah why because god said let there be light and as the light shines everything that's connected to it hollywood it begins to be set free are you free tonight you know but listen church the bible says hell yeah and the light shineth in darkness and darkness comprehended it is not hell yeah the world cannot understand your connection to god your unsaved loved ones cannot understand your connection to god because it says the light shineth hallelujah the truth shineth the way you dress the truth silent the way you talk the truth silent the way you worship they'll never be able to understand it the only way you can understand truth is to first accept it listen do you understand that the prophet god said before you can even commit seeing you got to deny truth think about it none of you none of us were created to lie none of us so what we have to do hallelujah we have to bypass hallelujah we have to bypass the original part of us that we were created for hallelujah and tap into darkness because there's no darkness in god so where does the light come from you have to bypass god to get to it that's why the prophet of god will say it's not god's will that any would perish it's not god's will that it should go to hell but we send ourselves how by rejecting the light because of you walking in the light you can see where you're going now i got about two hours to go from here about about 2 15. now it'll be real hard for me to get back home with no headlights i want you to check this out listen to me good now i know the way i know i can jump on 21 hallelujah right 21-95 95-26 get off 26 and then i'm cruising to my house holly but that'll be a very hard journey with no light wow and there's a lot of people that say they're on their way to heaven there's a lot of people that say hallelujah they know god but if you're not walking in this present day light it's going to be very hard for you to get there listen it may take i think about 200 it's about 240 miles i even know the mile count i even know how much gas is going to take i got all that down pack but without the proper light that's going to be a very hard trip holly and i got my daughter with me i know she got my 20 20 vision that won't help us you know how people are doing they're sitting there and reading the bible and they say well god give me understanding is it the only same understanding he gave to a prophet because god gave that prophet light divine light what was it divine truth whoa and if you can't see what he sees hallelujah it's going to be very hard for you to get there now let's understand something if you and i jump out there and start driving we'll be riding by the same light different cars same light are you with me harley so you can say well you got a you got a truck i got a car but when we cut our lights on it's that same light that's directing us hallelujah just a different vehicle hallelujah so church holly do you realize even though the prophet is gone hallelujah we're walking by the same light hell yeah we got the same truth so we should have the same miracles the same anointing the same angel of the lord the same god who in our services i challenge you tonight whatever your prayer request is look for it to be answered while the world is being preached if you're walking in the light he says you will have fellowship he said let there be light and it was whoa let there be truth and it was oh my glory to god you know what before i before i go on a little bit further listen how important the light is this is what the prophet of god says oh my it's very important to make sure as christians that our journey is clean that we don't have past unconfessed sins or unconfessed habits that we are not confessing to god notice i said habits harley a habit is something that you keep going back to but i said unconfess habit holy you can have something in your life that you're struggling with but as long as you're on your knees saying god take this from me you in a good place hallelujah but if you do it repetitiously hallelujah with no thought with no desire to change you in trouble hallelujah i always tell people they come to prayer and they and they say well brother i feel this way and i feel like i'm really letting god down i say that's good you ever felt that way you come to service and you don't give your all you don't sing or you don't worship the word come forth you feel like you miss god and then you walk out of here feeling beat up and you go home and you be like oh god what did i do lord i'm missing your presence and you're like brother diggs pray for me why do i feel that way that's a good thing because as long as you can feel that way hallelujah you are receptive to light hallelujah but if you ever lose that feeling hallelujah if you ever think you got everything all right if you ever can see it and it don't bother you you are in trouble so if you fall and you say lord help me get up praise god but if you fall and you say oh well i did it now who cares what they think you are in trouble the scripture says holy bless is the man who sins of whose iniquities are forgiven whose sins are forgiven hallelujah to give forgiveness you have to have done something wrong look at god now we know that god uh is a forgiver oh let me let me make up my own word he's a forgiver hallelujah do you know him as a forgiver well you know you've done something wrong but the forgiveness still gives you forgiveness you know you might be missing a mark but the forgiver still gives you the proper right hallelujah to come to his throne hallelujah he still makes you feel good sometimes even though you've done wrong see god is a god who's mindful of every mistake that you will do that you've done hell yeah and but he's a forgiver why is he forgive her because that's who he that's one of his attributes so he allows us to make mistakes just so he can give us a portion of him what is that portion forgiveness anybody ever made a mistake hallelujah praise god hallelujah praise god hallelujah you made that mistake so god could show you that he's a forgiver hallelujah the devil doesn't get any credit everything about us is for the good of god even our mistakes is for the good of god why so he can show us the truth when god shows you your mistakes what is he doing he's showing you the true way to do it let me back up a little bit let me back up a little bit listen now for those of you who are hiding you know some people jason they love a big church so they can hide they can come in and get lost pastors don't know their name don't know if they missing service or people love church like that not me not me amen i want to be connected you know i was just preaching at our church a couple weeks ago and the prophet god said how many knows the order of battle he said how many knows the order of battle he says first things first when it comes to battle is worship but we wouldn't know matthew to get it going no you're supposed to be a part of the battle so you're supposed to worship and call me crazy if you can't worship i don't want you on my team because god might look at you and say i'm going to the next team if you connected with that oh yeah i ain't got time for that let me move on hallelujah he says the order of the battle is to worship and when you go into the scriptures you can see that before they even fought holy they anointed their appointed worshipers hallelujah those that could play skillfully amen they didn't go out they hit and missing what did they do they practiced at home [Music] don't get mad at me they got it in their spirit they didn't wait till they come to church and stand up here with a phone in their hand where are the true consecrated worshipers that when they sing is coming out of their soul oh i missed those days when we weren't relying on monitors and and and billboards but people sat home and they meditated over the worship hallelujah and they wasn't getting up the scene to the people but they they knew they would not get any rest until they sent us to god where is that church he said we will appoint worshipers and then you go read chronicles 25 the bible says hallelujah that the worship was so that it prophesied the battle that's what's supposed to be going on i don't know why i'm here i hope i hope it helps somebody listen when we worship harley you ever heard brother jason come out of brother matt or other brother jason demars come out and they said we thank god for that song it goes along with my message prophesied the battle hallelujah that's what your worship is supposed to do your worship is supposed to tap into the word that's about to come why because the worship exalts god the worship tells you that you're in the light the worship will tell you what kind of truth is about to come and we didn't heard it many times we thank god for that song that song goes right along with my message what happened the worshipers prophesied the battle that showed that the devil is defeated holy and when you go back and study it a little bit deeper hallelujah catch this one church this one was real sweet to me that when they worship those that were appointed with the trumpets and the symbols and and all the different pastries and things that they had to worship hallelujah when they came out they gave it their best so when they got to playing they played they made a noise it was so in tune it was so hard it was so miraculous that the bible said the worship was there to set an ambush for the enemy come back and read your bible your worship is here for an ambush to protect the world satan look at you worshiping and you just got your hands lifted you just praising him so he's thinking i got to stop that he don't know that the words coming behind that hallelujah and the word is going to rightly divide the word is going to be so much light is just going to bring everything forward but you know listen listen i want to read this quote to you he says this is for your secrets we're in a time we're in a day where the hour is late and if you don't know god you need to make it your business to know him forget about who leaving who ain't coming make it personal remember here we're walking under a gentile hollywood a gentile step hallelujah we're not going in there as a group hallelujah but we're going in as individuals hallelujah so church don't worry about who's beside you and who's not here and who's home and who's who's wearing a mask and who's not wearing a mask make sure that you have truth make sure you know him you know you hear these people by god's grace you hear these people talking about the message of the hour and you know they say well uh uh they left because of fanaticism and people worship brother brown and i say man please i'm like that's your argument man please the real bride of christ never worshiped brother branham she always knew the purpose of that prophet hallelujah the purpose of that prophet was to bring the light of god here so that it could connect with the seed of god so that we as a bride could come forward [Applause] that was the purpose of william branham god gave him a message why for you behold i seen you elijah the prophet so it was never about brother branham it was always about you and for those who get stuck with hallelujah the seventh angel they're missing it because everything the seventh angel had he got from the mighty angel hallelujah every revelation every gift every anointing hallelujah every service it came from god remember if you're walking in light you hear his voice hallelujah because you're walking in truth hallelujah the truth of the matter is nobody else's blood could redeem us but christ so why would you follow another you'd be walking in darkness remember the light shineth in darkness and darkness comprehended it not it was never about following the man hallelujah it was about following the truth [Music] hallelujah it was about following the truth he said brothers how can you say that because when this message was preached it wasn't preached hallelujah on a message platform it was preached in denominations it was preached in an area where everything was false baptist doctrine partial methodist doctrine partial pentecostal doctrine partial so god had to come and give him a light that we could walk in wow because this is the only light that will get us back to god listen he says and before i condemn a satanic spirit and so forth i want to know first whether that's in god's legal plan my now we think that the prophet just come people getting the prayer line he rebuked the devil and people set free nope didn't happen like that that person had to be worthy of god's grace and if they had something in their lives the prophet couldn't pray for something they were holding on to or some secret he said and it's god he said and brother barbara says jesus died holy for everyone that's right then if you're living in above that reproach and doing right then satan has to turn loose of you oh yeah if you're living above the reproach of sin satan has to turn everything that belongs to you loose i thought by now we'll be shouting anybody got the holy ghost anybody walking in the light the light of truth anybody walking in truth so according to the prophet he said if you're living above the reproach of sin satan has to turn you loose i'ma ask you again does anybody got the holy ghost is anybody living in truth satan has to turn you loose he loses his grip why because there's nothing in your life for him to hold on to [Music] there's nothing he can connect with but if you got a little darkness there he'll fellowship with that darkness but if your body be your spirit be full of light he can't do nothing the darkness comprehended it not and you know what he does he tries to go to god dealing in your past and you go to god and say well they did this and they did that and god will say i don't see it oh oh my how privileged we are to be walking in light because with that testimony god is saying to the devil they never did it that's real justification you never did it and right now you could be thinking well i did this and i did that according to god you never did it so why condemn yourself if god is not condemning you glory else we spent too much time condemning ourselves over the past and god will show you your past just to set you free what a wonderful savior what a great forgiver we got because we'll sit home sometimes we condemn ourselves well i did this and i did that and god is looking at you saying what are you talking about i've already made a way for this don't hold on to your secrets confess them give them to god that's what he's there for he wants to be a forgiver amen and i know y'all can go home y'all gonna be laughing at that word but then you're gonna you're gonna think about it you're gonna say i gotta forgive her i gotta forgive the right god is forgive her i know i know one thing i know about me you know i'm just i whether i'm preaching whether i'm singing or worshiping i give it all i got it and sometimes people can't comprehend that they think it's a workup or they think you know it's a performance it's a show no that's just how i'm built i ain't built to give god fifty percent i ain't built to give him eighty percent i'm built to give him a hundred and ten but it looks like i should quit there's something that gives me another gear hallelujah see i ain't just an ordinary car i'm a maybach whoa hallelujah bro jason my doors don't open the regular way they come up like this so you may be just sitting there in church and my door starts rising holy that means we're about to get into something [Applause] they call them suicide doors yeah the devil see me in there i might as well kill myself cause he ain't gonna stop until he has god's attention hey man you know i was born for i was born to challenge mankind hallelujah come on come get me come on brothers hold me up come get me hallelujah i like brother biscuit one time he was preaching with the with with the uh one of these mics and this was a couple years ago so he's in his 80s he's preaching with one of these mics and he started getting excited he said this thing is hindering me give me the lapel hallelujah so if he can do it at 83 i know i can do that the age i'm at hallelujah let's finish reading i gonna be before you alone you know i'm about to close but listen church that we want to make sure we're in god's plan how do we stay in god's plan by walking in light walking in truth and as long as you are in truth the light of god the devil has no holds on you hallelujah that's why he's trying to stop this message so much hallelujah because he knows if he forgives he can get us to reject us we're rejecting truth think about the church us as believers when we reject hollywood or for those i ain't gonna say we for those who have rejected holy this message of the hour they've rejected the portions of god that's been revealed oh my and you know some people say well i'm just i'm just not going to fellowship but i'ma still believe the doctrine foolishness we don't want you have we want all of you hallelujah listen he says then if you're living above the reproach and and doing right then satan has to turn you loose but if there's anything back behind there maybe something that you ought to have done maybe you're living clean and pure but god told you hallelujah something to do and you neglected to do it oh my that'll give satan a right to put a hand on you he says in god's he's saying god holds that right on you until you get back and make that thing right again whether it's something you should have done of should not have done do you see what i mean just as simple as being obedient to god can cause her the devil to keep his grips in your life you say oh my y'all know that the prophet was always scriptural the best example i can think of it is coming to me right now dealing with this was saul you know garco saul go down and kill uh a gag kill all the ammo crack kill kill baby suckling sheep goat cow ass have killed everything dog cat kangaroo kill it all am i right where did that word come from that word came from god through a prophet to samuel i mean to saul holly so what was god trying to get him to do to see if he is going to walk in truth whoa just believe god walk in truth holy it'll tell whether you bride or not when the word comes do you obey it dare to tell who you are forget about your church building when you hear the word of god what do you do with it are you a hearer or are you a doer because saul he prophesied with the best he walked with the he walked with the people of god but he simply couldn't obey the truth so therefore he could no longer walk in light and god comes he tells him he says hey through the prophet hallelujah see he would have never known what the light of god was without samuel am i right saul would have never known what god wanted without samuel hallelujah so god used samuel hallelujah as a go-to to get the saul to get to the people hallelujah and then he'd come he said well god said go kill go kill a gag and amalekite kill every kill every mama baby everything why did god it seemed like god was vicious hallelujah but he knew earlier that little cute little amalekite baby was gonna grow up to be a gag that's why when god tell us to kill certain things in our lives don't blame it on your friends don't blame it on your parents hallelujah what you got to do is kill it if you kill it god will give you grace to go through it but you know what we got things we love that we don't want to see die we don't want to separate from oh my so he tells me he said go he said go kill everything let's kill it all you know what saul did so i'll say i heard you god i heard you he said i'm gonna go down here i'm gonna wipe out everything i don't like that wasn't the commandment it wasn't what he liked it was what god didn't like and god didn't like nothing that was identified with the amalekites even a little cute little crying babies those pretty those pretty fluffy sheep with that pretty wool gossip kill it holy that nice juicy angus beef that was down the glass and kill it that good old pretty and pink pig that was down to godzilla get it but you know what saul went down there he said man ain't nobody ain't no need to get rid of all some of some of us we can offer up to god man you know these nice sheep and this and that and let's take some of this let's take some of that you know we'll take it back and we'll offer sacrifice hey guys come along of all things he should have killed a gag first because the sheep represented ajax the children representing aka everything about the amalekites represented i challenge you tonight kill your king kill that thing that has authority over your life kill it how do you kill it give it to god say lord i surrender i surrender hallelujah because you know god has it that way when things look so strong that we can't defeat it on our own it takes him to step in and do it why because when you come up against other challenges you won't try to fight it yourself you bring that to god and that way you always stay victorious so anyway he comes and you know he he brings everything back and god god comes and he tells samuel he say look saul has disobeyed me and i'm gonna strip him i'm gonna strip him from fellowship i'm gonna strip him from walking in the light oh my i'mma strip him from hearing my voice i'm stripping from everything just because he didn't do what god told him to do what about us church how many times were god telling us to do something that we don't obey i ain't talking about something that'll make you a celebrity in the church now ain't talking about that i ain't talking about something you want to be seen for everybody to see you doing and you can say oh look at me praise god no i ain't talking about that i'm talking about in your secret place that thing you wrestling with hallelujah the prophet of god said we all have hollywood personal temptations of satan he said but how do you defeat it you're defeated by the word he said that's how jesus defeated he said jesus had his own personal temptations by the devil when satan took him out of his 40 they fast and he said turn this to bread he says get up on his mind and worship me and jesus said it's written it's written he said what was he fighting what was the temptation he said all three of those trials one represented the lust of the eye the other represented the lust of the flesh and the third represented the pride of life and jesus defeated all three how by the word wow walk in the light it'll be the truth that helps you to overcome listen in saint john 17 17 and 17 he says sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth hallelujah amen how many believe we got truth for our clothes let's go to saint john four let's look at this story real quick i believe that we have truth i believe what we have is so bright hallelujah it's changing us into something that the world didn't even know existed oh yeah the world didn't even know what exists on the earth until the light began to shine he said we'll be an invincible army saint john chapter four now we know the story of the woman at the well amen now let's read a little bit i'mma kind of jump around in here for the sake of time but let's just start at um verse seven he said then come with a woman of samaria to draw water jesus says unto her give me to drink for his disciples were going away unto the city to buy meat then said the woman of of samaria unto him how is it that thou being a jew asketh drink of me which am a woman of samaria for the jews have no dealings with the samaritans jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that santa did he give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee living wall listen in this first response jesus stopped talking about water he said if you knew the gift of god you'll be asking for something else the prophet of god saying right here he's trying to contact a spirit what is he doing he's pulling her into the light do y'all know that's the ability of the word hallelujah the bible say the word is quick and powerful before you've noticed then cut something off you holly it's quick and powerful shove it at any two-headed sword hallelujah oh my and we have a sword that's double-bladed it's cutting both ways like a samurai holiday the woman said unto him sir val has nothing to do with see she's still in the corner realm holy he's trying to pull in the light and she's still trying to make this a flesh affair he's trying to get her to see something hardly that he'll natural eyes can't see do you know church we are a people living a revelation that the natural eye can't see hallelujah the light shine is in the darkness comprehended it not see a lifestyle in this moment it can't even comprehend what jesus is talking about but because he's a great forgiver he's going to keep dealing with her god will keep dealing with you until the real you comes out [Applause] oh yeah some of us have been in church for years and years and years and then one day it clicks holy what is it he'll keep dealing with you holy until that word connects i'm going to read you something that's going to shake your boots hallelujah then she says of our grace she says are thou greater than my father jacob which which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle jesus says and saith unto her whosoever drinking of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh the water that that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i that i should give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life you see where he's taking her he's taking her he's taking her beyond what she can physically see and now he's tapping into her face see everybody thought she was a prostitute but jesus knew she was a believer and look what he's doing hallelujah he doesn't have some special uh some soft rock christian music going [Music] he doesn't have some rap gospel going on oh yeah he don't have some christian rock and roll no he's just giving another word holy he has some special uh uh uh uh potluck going on though he's just giving her the word and that word is drawing her into a place where he's trying to get her to see beyond her natural eye beyond her natural understanding hallelujah and she's responding hallelujah and the woman said unto him sir give me this water that i thirst not neither come near to draw hallelujah now that's the sign of a believer they hear truth and they want more come on somebody if you're a real believer you may not understand everything but there's something inside of you that says i want more no i wasn't there in 63 no i wasn't there 65 but there's something inside of me that says i want more look at how hallelujah she's being pulled into the light hallelujah she don't even realize what's going on she's being quickened by just hearing the truth he keeps dealing with and dealing with her listen oh she got tired of hearing him talk about it and she said give me of this water oh before she was like you're a jew i'm a gentile we got no dylan's and now listen to a conversation give me this water church do you know you got the same right see guys hallelujah when you step into the light you can say unto the lord give me of yourself give me of yourself give me my children give me my healing give me my blessing lord i want all of you [Music] forget my nationality forget where i come from forget what kind of house i was raised up in give me this water that i'll never thirst again [Music] what was she saying to jesus i want truth i'm tired of living the way i'm living lord changed my life oh my jesus now listen this is the part i want to get to now she's hungry she's ready she's ready for everything that he is honey the the stove is hot the pots on it is balling all you got to do is drop the substance in there hallelujah sisters know what i'm talking about when you're cooking that meal hallelujah you don't just throw it into a cold pot you start to warm it up how you cut the owl on get the pot ready hallelujah do what you got you put some water in there some grease whatever you cooking let's just say you're boiling something you don't just throw it in the end then wait in the water stop no you want the water to stop balling first let it get hot then you drop it in there once you drop it in there hallelujah it's subject to the atmosphere of the water [Laughter] and you throw it in there and the water is bubbling it can't help but react to the temperature it might be heavier than the water but the gravitational pull inside the pot changes with the temperature and it'll take something that should sink and make it float oh my church we should be seeking with the rest of the world but we're living under a different temperature hallelujah you know i feel like the basketball players you know when they on fire they shooting a shot and they can't be stopped they look at their hand and they say [Applause] you know what i mean that means i'm cooking and you know what church tonight bethel tabernacle is cooking let me see you cook tonight come on somebody let me see you cool [Applause] hallelujah oh my it doesn't matter whatever you drop in there hallelujah it has to succumb to the pressure of the temperature in the pot and there are some things some of us we want to jump out the pot then you have to be cooked slow you don't even know god dealing with you and you've been coming to church and coming to church you think nothing ain't happening but you slowly being cooked you like that lobster you in that pot got your hands tied up you can't jump out until you start feeling yourself something happening to you what is it hallelujah you cooking the world is cooking oh listen oh my he said jesus says go call that husband and come hear that now he's gonna deal with what's hindering her we've already established that she's bright because she's connected to the word now now he's feeling deal with her sin listen he says go get thy husband and come healer the woman answered and said i have no husband jesus saith unto her thou has well said i have no husband for thou has had five husbands and he whom thou now has is not thy husband in that the woman said to satisfaction sir i perceive that thou art a prophet [Music] listen holy you hear what she said she said i'll proceed now she's walking in the light now she said i perceive that thou as a prophet what's happening her seed is connecting with the light because the prophet has the true divine revelation coming from god so now she's listening to christ and she's saying you got to be speaking the truth oh my oh my give me that give me that uh quote out of um um third seal listen to this church you know iron sharpens iron talk to me it's good to have fellowship with one another around the word of god hallelujah and you know me and me and brother burleigh are on the phone fellowshipping honey and he dropped this on me right here we started talking about this and he dropped the scripture on me and you know me once you drop some truth on me you gonna hit it again especially if it's doing something to me holiday you know listen church he says he says what what was it the light struck the seed it had been laying there that was spoke by god yes sir the seed was on the earth when god moved the water away and the sun hit it hallelujah it come up that's right see that's all he needed was sun just needed light yes sir what's he saying all we need is jesus once we get in his presence hallelujah that seed will collect with light and the truth will come forward but this is the part i want to deal with he says and then the holy spirit in him moved away her her past life my now you talk about the woman at the well that whole conversation was about jesus moving her past out of the way you see he dealt with everything that she was he was speaking into her life and what was he doing he was moving her past so that the words he could speak could connect directly with the seed and you think about that church god wants us hallelujah to deal with our sins why because once we can deal with our past the word can connect hollywood straight with the seed oh my he said he moved the whale past life and showed it to him did god do that to you hallelujah if he did not ask you why did you repent first step is to repent then be baptized why do we repent because of our past life hallelujah so what does god do he show you your past life move all that out the way so that the word coming after that can deal directly with your seed hallelujah once he gets your pass out of the way you can only go up from there don't be afraid of it from that because once you confess it holly god is showing it to you once he shows it to you he has to deal with it and once he did church i hope you catching me if god shows you your past you repent he deals with it it's done the only thing you can do then is move forward in truth hallelujah that's how you receive the holy ghost because the devil has no more connection to you by your past your past has been forgiven holy prime example rahab the harlot when god dealt with her he dealt with a past hallelujah because when he destroyed jericho he destroyed her past [Music] so there were no more claims on her as a prostitute because from that point when jericho was destroyed there was no other men that could say they ever slept with rahab now she could just walk in the truth and you know one thing i love about god he knows how to move that scene out of the way and deal right with that seed you know what they did as they talked to ray have rabbis and men's hearts melt we've heard what so god did out there in the wilderness at the red sea and all these things and they began to talk and talk and rahab like this woman she said she said give me others water oh hallelujah what's the real dude ray i said give me a token y'all know that's message language that's believers language hallelujah hurry that's bride language holy rahab say give me a true token and the bible says by that token her father's and her mother her house was saved by that token oh my let god deal with your past stop holding on to it all he's trying to do is move that out of the way so he can deal directly with you and what are you if you get your sins out of the way what are you a god amen i know that was kind of strong for you right there listen he says that when the holy spirit in him moved away her past life and showed it to her the light struck it she said sir i perceive you're a i perceive where i'm at where i'm at where i'm at all right and my lawn set all right he says now we know i know that when the messiah comes that's what he's doing that's what he's going to be and we ain't had a profit for hundreds of years we've had never had a true profit for hundreds of years and she said how you tell me about my husband and told me how many i've had and so forth why said i don't understand this see darkness doesn't comprehend light so that's why god was bringing her into the light so she could understand but what he had to do he had to move away her darkness because the end of the story is she's running down into the city saying come see a man who told me all things listen what happens when the truth comes and you respond differently look at how the true elect of god respond they hear the word they hear the truth and they connect with it and move forward listen what the prophet said this is in christ the mission of god reveal real quick he says when it struck them priests they said this man is a fortune teller see no life in there the same light the same truth hallelujah dealing with the priests and they said this man is a fortune teller why because they wasn't connected to truth they probably said they had no life in there holy a hybrid to come up as a as far as an organization but die from that from their own when jesus came they called him bias above they called the devil and everything and he was truth why they couldn't receive it wasn't no life inside so we don't have to pick each other out and say this is bride that is bride this one brian brought no you know who you are but how you respond to the word of god not just your amens in church but the life you live when you leave here hallelujah because we're born to put on a good show now look i know some people i know some people shout the church down get god praise i mean he looks like a different person it wasn't connecting with the truth but you notice when this woman connected hallelujah her life changed when rahab connected her life changed when peter hallelujah and the rest of the disciples when they connected their life changed when they connected with that truth their life changed so i'm going to tell you church hallelujah hallelujah why am i a message believer not just because i know god seen william branham no because the word that god gave with you brethren change my life hallelujah even though i was never there personally with him hallelujah that word that voice hallelujah changed my life those magnetic tapes oh changed my life hallelujah oh my those mp3s changed my life because i was living in darkness hallelujah raised up in sin but then i heard the word of god through a trial called cancer thank god for cancer because cancer was the thing that brought the light in my room hallelujah so you ought to rejoice when you're going through stuff holy do y'all know god purposely listen uh don't forget this word god purposely allows us to go through things because he's a forgiver come on musicians i'm closing he'll purposely let you go through things so you can experience an attribute that you haven't experienced hallelujah let's walk in the light of the word because if we walk in what's been revealed we walk in truth and anything false will never overcome truth never it'll never overcome truth truth will always outshine something false because truth hallelujah you don't have to pump it you don't have to push it it just manifests itself it just bears hallelujah you tell a sheep he's a sheep by what he bears a apple is an apple about what it just comes the life that just comes forth out of the seed hallelujah and so are we we are children of god hell yeah just by what comes out of us as we're hearing the truth hallelujah let's pray
