too much monitor for me brother mark you can back those down by probably 50 amen praise the lord you love him man we greet you all in the name of the lord today happy to have you all here some most faces i'm familiar with got a few faces uh not familiar with good to see brother aaron and his family over from georgia amen happy to have them with us here today good friend for many years amen praise the lord amen we want to look right into god's word this morning in mark chapter 16. amen praise the lord right because that conveys to you where i'm headed because i don't want you to i want you to get right with me right off the bat so i take pains to give you a title that's suggestive uh but but i just thought this through and i just thought there's no better word or group of words than just one word about what's on my heart opportunity amen and we preached on it last sunday and we want to continue on today the lord has given us some marvelous opportunities hasn't he mark chapter 16 and verse one through eight that's about perfect thanks buddy and when the sabbath was passed mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome had brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulcher and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great and entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were afraid i think i said this one of the time every time i read that verse i think of caleb campbell something about caleb's looks angelic amen i can imagine they saw caleb smiling with that smile he has amen and he's saying to them be not afraid you know and he saith unto them verse 6 be not a frighted you seek jesus of nazareth which was crucified he has risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him but go your way tell his disciples and peter that he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto you and they went quickly and fled from the sepulcher for they trembled and were amazed neither said they anything to any man for they were afraid amen let's pray father we thank you for your word this morning thank you for this wonderful group of people here lord who are gathered here to hear the word of god i pray lord that all those also streaming lord may also receive a great benefit and blessing from the word today we thank you for the teams of brothers and uh lord who make all of this possible lord i am so appreciative of them and the enemy trying this morning you know to lord to cause technical problems but quickly they were able to resolve it and we're going forward and so we're grateful now i thank you for all the visitors here today and lord we're looking now to you for your word of course it's on my heart has been i've thought about it studied over it wept over it rejoiced over it lord and i just i so much want to convey it today exactly as you gave it to me lord so would you grant that lord help us now today bless your word we commit it to you in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated amen we just kind of wait for the transitional traffic here to settle down we learned a lot from last week and i won't really have time to background uh hardly any at all if any at all but um it's i feel that it was an important thought it's helpful for you if you absorb it if you missed it you can go back and get the archive i'd recommend that you do i was very much moved by the opportunities that god has given us in this day one of the things that we in fact is i if i background at all it would just be to touch the last uh note that we had um it in in part one and that was how that you know god has sometimes orchestrated trials for us amen and we find out that he allows challenges often in the first place you remember the point that we made that was bizarre to me when i thought it through i thought wow here is jehoshaphat and either he's saying to the lord here comes an enemy and this is very complex lord it's very convoluted there's a lot of moving parts they're coming basically to kill us all and you wouldn't let joshua wipe them out all those years ago and this is how they repay us and now joshua could have beat them we can't we have no might against them they're much larger than us and we don't really have a fighting force that can meet them in the field and he actually said what we have been forced to say many times in this troubling age we don't know what to do how many have ever been there where the situation you were facing you were just in prayer and you were just saying to the lord i don't know what to do help me tell me what to do and and the lord comes on the scene to basically say you're not even going to have to fight now i want you to go prepared for battle but i'm actually going to do all the fighting i just want you to go watch it and and and then they do and god does and that's it enemy vanquished god's family saved the the history book records it amen and we rejoice over it but it occurred to me i thought to myself i said well you know there's nothing hidden from god he already knows what he's going to do before the foundation of the world amen you believe you have that kind of god well then if god already knew that he was going to do that then and he was just going to go wipe them out then why go through all of that drama why not just why even let it happen lord your lord comes on the scene and gets you out of a jam and helps you and you sit back and go wow lord i i sure am grateful you saved me but boy i could have done to not go through that well actually that's wrong you needed to go through that and so god has designed it even though god already knows you're going to ask him for help he already knows he's going to do it he already knows what the end's going to be but we found out that god when it comes to his offspring you know they had this pre-programmed uh sixth sense from the before the foundation of the world that was put in them by a gene of god and we find that it becomes obvious that sometimes god is taking you to a blessing through a fight and it becomes obvious that he obviously wanted them to go through that because he doesn't do anything without a purpose so you know you're here today now maybe you're not on the other side of a hard trial yet and you're still waiting on god even maybe to tell you what to do or what he's going to do but i'm here to tell you god's in control god's got it don't worry walk on trust the lord are you a christian then you can't lose is he your father then you're going to amen see so so the devil has no say in the life of god's family now the bible says he with his own children he can put move do whatever he wants to do with him whatever he listed but with god's family satan has no jurisdiction over god's family and you need to understand that every movement he makes against you he has to have express permission from god to do it amen and so what does a trial do a trial gives you an opportunity for victory what does your victory do bring him glory he intends at the end of the age to sit in the throne of his glory that's matthew 25 he's intending to sit in the throne of his glory you're his glory he's intending to sit with you in the throne together amen the spirit and the bride say come amen so we find then that sometimes the only way to a blessing is through a fight and sometimes god wants to fight his enemies through his family that can seem counterintuitive but that's the way god has designed it to happen he gives these opportunities he he's offering an opportunity here to these women he's saying you know first don't be afraid here's your opportunity don't be afraid uh you i'm going to comfort you you're seeking jesus well he's not here see he's risen so rejoice he's risen he's not dead now here's another opportunity go quickly tell his disciples and peter that he's alive and and this is an opportunity for them what if those women which they very easily could have done though god knew they wouldn't but with free moral agency they could have they left there afraid and the bible says they spoke to no man what if they if their fear was so great they didn't even go tell the disciples how many times listen friends brother branham taught us that that that you actually can step off into into permissive will and that never ends well now god works it around to get you back to his perfect will and that sometimes is a long road to ho and sometimes i'm just here to tell you the permissive will of god will get you to where god wants to get you but it's not going to be fun and you'd better you'll be better off to just stay in his perfect will so he gives us an opportunity you have an opportunity here today to follow his word or not and that's what we were showing you uh last sunday you can follow it the option's yours he won't force you you can follow it and gain the blessing or not see and so if you're his child then you might be in for some child training he said that we we we we didn't read it last time um micah who's beside you is that g give me uh give me uh acts 1 10. give me acts 1 10. we referred to this last time but we didn't i don't remember reading it but i thought that we would look at it as an example and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men catch it two men stood by them in white apparel next which also said you men of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven so now we find that jesus had given them an opportunity to go and be endued with power from on high we're not talking about any power we're talking about power from on high now i can't imagine a christian wouldn't want that amen and here they're giving a given an opportunity and an instruction by the lord say oh he gave him an instruction he gave them an opportunity to obey an instruction he's saying to them there's going to be a a fulfillment of prophecy and if you're there when it happens you'll get the benefit if you're not you won't or you might not and and that's why paul said there's more than 500 people the bible says above 500 people standing here saw heard what he said saw him go up as if they i mean you're talking about a miracle imagine standing talking to someone and they just lift off the ground and disappear into the clouds i'm pretty sure i'm going to do what they said i'm going to go and wait for this power because wow that was pretty impressive amen and yet by the time that the prophecy came to pass and the prophecy wasn't late it had to wait 10 days that wasn't all exactly explained to them but god doesn't always exactly explain he gives you an opportunity to obey him he already knows the reward waiting on the other side of obedience you can go get it or you can miss it brother branham talks about in a prayer line where he's speaking to him excuse me and he says sir he says stand up you're you're healed jesus christ makes you whole the man was there as a as a sir stand up jesus christ makes you whole and the man never moved and brother branham said it again giving him the benefit of the doubt maybe he didn't hear it right sir you're healed jesus christ makes you whole stand up and the man sit there and then it became apparent he just wasn't going to do it sir jesus christ makes you well stand to your feet and the man wouldn't and brother branham's next line is very well sir jesus christ passes you by. this ain't no joke god is a serious man you understand and he he's serious about his word he had given them a great opportunity to go and receive power from on high this power would give them what every real believer wants and that's overcoming victory in our lives there's nothing to depress a believer more than failure there's i mean that that's that's far worse than losing money or losing something maybe somebody you know boosts your car on you and you come out and it's gone that that that's bad but let me you got insurance for that but listen friends when you're when you're living a life of failure and but yet you know you love god and you believe his word and you believe this message and you know what's possible but you're not living there that's doom and gloom i don't care how bright the day is for you it's not bright i don't care what kind of things are happening in your life your bank account might be swelling you might have more friends than you've ever had but i'm here to tell you at the end of the day when push comes to shove you're going to go to bed at night and you're going to lay in a dark room with your head staring at a dark ceiling and you're gonna hear that voice adam where art thou adam that's not a fun voice to hear no real believer wants to hear that if you and if you don't mind that and then you probably enjoy the siren song of laodicea that probably it dances to your tune but i'm here to tell you it doesn't it doesn't float my boat i don't dance to that i hate the siren song of laodicea and if i find my flesh following it even a little bit i'm like my goodness snap out of it come to your senses what are you doing because i want to live in victory i want to live with the power of god moving and flowing through my life i'm not in this thing this is not organized religion god didn't give you another denomination he gave you an opportunity at the living word and it could live in you and through you or not amen so the opportunity the world misses out on by declining to consider this great message that's brought to us it takes my breath away at times because they decline to hear it it's not it's not for them you know i and i don't want to get ahead of myself but but you know they you you can see history repeating itself constantly you see that mankind is constantly doomed to repeat his failures he never learns from his past history and so he's doomed to always repeat his failures that's a common saying that's actually based on scripture that solomon said there's really actually nothing new under the sun that whatever is going to be has actually already happened and whatever you know whatever is happening has already happened and whatever has happened will happen again and so so we find then that that you say well then what is this life really about well i can tell you what it's not about it's not about this life it's about the next one this life is only a proving grounds it's only a training field getting you ready for life i promise you friends i don't care how well you're doing in this life you're not really living very much there's a place coming where life is going to be perfect and flawless and no more anxieties or stresses or fears or harm or loss or separation there's purpose in life on the other side we're not going to sit on clouds playing a heart that's not what heaven's about heaven is an opportunity to advance the bible speaks of the kingdom of christ that of his kingdom there's the of the increase the perpetual increase of his kingdom there shall be no end i want to be a part of that they say they can't find the borders of of space and they think maybe space is ever expanding i just say good an ever-expanding kingdom is going to need an ever-expanding universe i want to go i want to be there i want to be a part of that that's what i'm aiming at that's what i'm living for i've long ago threw down the pursuit of happiness in this world i'm plenty happy but my only joy comes from the blessing of the lord see because there's nothing satan's going to give you listen young people there's nothing satan's going to give you that's going to give you happiness it can give you pleasure but it's not happiness pleasure doesn't always equal happiness sometimes pleasure leaves you less happy see and so so we find that the world declines this message that god has done something so great brother brother jd was laying that out this morning and we were in the back office just preaching to each other rejoicing over what god has done and my the history is so is so confirmed and and prophecy you can overlay it with history and it matches just like like a hand on a a hand in a glove it dovetails perfectly the ages the trumpets the seals the vials it all just it all hits synchronously and god is doing it all and you're right in the big middle of it and it's all happening you're you're in a convergence friends do you know that you're in a convergence of events that are unparalleled in history wake up and understand that no age has ever experienced the convergence you're in do you know that amos 9 tells us how that at the one of the there's three element three converging elements of that that the the people remember the bible talks about the people upon whom the ends of the world have come they have a trifecta of convergence according to amos 9 14 i believe it is you have the reapers who are in the field remember jesus said the field is the world and they're they're trying to gather the last remnants they're just gleaning the last remnant because this message went global this message because of technology went to all the jungles and everywhere it's all over the world and that's when jesus said the end would come when this gospel this original one not not a not a denominational middle-aged version of it because john wesley's age accomplished a lot of that but when this original gospel goes to all the world then shall the end come and and you realize that that the the revival has been so great so global over so many years it's taken us way longer to gather up all the sheaves and we didn't we never thought we'd still be here in 2021 we thought we'd be long ago gone we you know my wife said my parents never thought their kids would go to school and that was me and then i thought well my kids will certainly never go and they're sitting here with kids who are in school amen and so so so so we find that that god keeps moving in his word and we're gathering trying to because when you gather that last one we're out of here but it talks about a convergence that before the reapers can even clear the field then the plowmen are coming in for sowing for the next event which is the gospel going back to the to moses through moses and elijah to pick up the elected israel and then above all of that tying the two together is the treader of grapes waiting to start a tribulation and no wonder friends do you understand sometimes we look at these things like covet and we look at these pandemics and and call a pandemic call them a pandemic brother branham called it a pandemonic and so whatever you want to call it but you under we and we say my goodness this is almost like pre-tribulation judgments but yeah we go wait a minute we're not supposed to be here for the tribulation that's scripture and and the reason that it seems like that is because there's a triple conversion we're trying to get the last seed moses and elijah that anointing for the jews is coming on it's moving politics and the treasure of grapes is already we're already feeling the effect of that you're living in this convergence right now it's happening in real time and you're right in the big middle of it don't be asleep at the switch don't think it's just life's gonna just keep going on it can't just keep going on do you know why world war one started because it was prophecy to do it do you know why it stopped because it was prophecy that it would stop do you know why the second woe started because it was prophecy that it would do you know when it why it stopped because it accomplished what it was to do you think world war iii is not coming do you think every every event in history is is connected to prophecy and they've hit 100 percent and they've never not hit 100 percent and somehow the world is things well we're just going to go on and on and on and on it's that's impossible you're you're you're you're those upon whom the ends of the world have come and all the political and all the religious and all the demon powers brother branham talked about that triple union of political religious and demon powers converging together to take a world into destruction i'm going to tell you something friends this is this is this is serious this is an hour to be deadly serious with god it's not an hour to be playing church that's always been true but it's never been more true than it is now you've got an opportunity to live above it or not you've got an opportunity to be resistant to its effects or not the opportunity is yours today i can't make you take it the lord won't make you take it but you have an opportunity amen every man i don't every man has an opportunity at eternal life that that that doesn't we're not preaching on election versus a remnant we're not talking about that today election is just origin but every man is given an opportunity but but but by and large men won't choose it just like they won't choose this message though it hits on all cylinders they won't choose it it's provable by history alone it's provable and so so we find that the world is determined to have its sinful way if you look let's go get into isaiah chapter 28. i want to i want to just take a read through this this morning while i've still got enough time to do it otherwise i won't get to it at the end isaiah chapter 28 and i i want to just we might as well just start at one and we're just going to probably read all the way through it i just want you to and i'll comment along as i go now here here is this is the judgment of ephraim now it's interesting because ephraim and dan those two tribes now don't read ahead of me everybody look this way okay ephraim and dan were blotted out from inheritance from under heaven now you and in fact is when you read about it in the old testament when you come to the book of revelation and you you go into uh chapter 7 to read about the 144 000 they're not there because they were blotted out from under heaven and in fact is you you would you would have all hope lost except way back in isaiah i think isaiah 48 if that's from off top my head isaiah 48 shows them in the millennium see has them back in the millennium and brother branham picks that up in the seals and says see brother branham is basically saying and i don't have the quotes here but he's basically saying you know nothing's going to trump election because they were god's family and even paul paul said nothing can separate me from that so if nothing can separate me from being a son of god then even me can't separate me thank god because i would have many times i would have disqualified myself so would you a man you probably did enough disqualification moves this week alone to get kicked to the to the side amen god even sees the thoughts you have see and so that's why the bible says any thought that exalts itself against the word of god needs to be brought to the holy ghost because he'll kill it on the spot if you'll do that if you don't it'll it'll it'll allow it'll grow it'll it'll it'll grow inside you and become a deed every false wrong deed started with a false wrong thought that you entertained and wouldn't let go and give it to god see and a lot of times you put those thoughts in there by the poisons you feed on in this world this ain't rocket science this is just simple easy peasy stuff that makes sense you feed on poison you get sick you don't need a seventh seal to understand that you you drink poison you get sick you eat bad food you get sick amen and so so so we we find then that ephraim you're going to read about their why they got kicked out of inheritance but brother branham says notice they were blotted out from under heaven not in heaven now now you say oh wow okay well then they made it anyway but they were they eliminated their own tribe from even being considered an election because in the 144 000 that's the elect jews at the last day ephraim's not listed there they literally doomed their own self to not even be considered in that list they were blotted out already from under heaven and when the list of elected jews the 144 thousand 12 000 out of each tribe ephraim and dan are missing because they judged themselves unworthy of it and eliminated their own opportunity to receive moses and elijah that's that's what that's what neglecting so greatest salvation can do the apostle says how shall we escape if we neglect so great of salvation you know what the answer is you won't escape you won't escape that you'll pay a toll and satan will exact a heavy toll a terrible price sin pays wages as i said last time it's not wages you can decline sin pays wages and and the and the wages of sin are death so you're going to choose pleasures of sin for a season over the joy of the lord for all eternity you say well when you say it like that wow it sounds pretty dumb it's always been dumb no matter how i describe it that's that's the worst deal in the ever written and yet overwhelming numbers of people take that deal every day i mean we could have people sitting in this service today we'll go right out of here and take that deal see and so so we find that this is what happened to ephraim all right let's go to verse 1. now follow along with me we'll we'll i'll break and comment uh as i go so woe to the crown of pride to the drunkards of ephraim whose glorious beauty is a fading flower see if they're a fading flower then they hadn't always been that they had at one time been a beautiful flower which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine behold the lord hath a mighty and strong one which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm as a flood of mighty waters overflowing shall cast down to the earth with the hand the crown of pride the drunkards of ephraim shall be trodden under feet and the glorious beauty which is on the head of the fat valley shall be a fading flower and as the hasty fruit before the summer which when he that looketh upon it seeth while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up in that day watch this now in that day shall the lord of host be for a crown of glory and for a diadem of beauty unto the residue of his people and for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate verse 7. now watch he's going to begin to bring a warning to jerusalem but they also have aired through wine and through strong drink are out of the way the priest and the prophet have aired through strong drink they're swallowed up of wine they are out of the way through strong drink they air in vision they stumble in judgment for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean now that's that scripture is is in living color today in denominational systems because this they're what you see today is they're making the same mistake israel made the exact same mistake all right for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean whom shall now watch this whom this is a long lengthy question whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast see and because he reasons how how am how am i going to get this next generation to understand how who who how will i even do that how will i teach these babies who are who are weaned from milk and drawn from the breast how am i ever going to teach them knowledge because knowledge must be verse 10 precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon and that's what israel was refusing they were mongrelizing his word and so they they were losing out on precept upon precept line upon line they had their own theories involved in it and god is saying my goodness if that's what they're doing how will i even take these babies born into a new generation how will i ever teach them knowledge there won't be no way to do it there won't be no way to do it see that's that's his point see he goes on to give the to with the qualifications here a little in there a little verse 11 for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith you may cause the weary to rest i'm giving you the opportunity of a lifetime and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear but the word of the lord was unto them precept upon precept precept upon precept line upon line in other words i'm not responsible i gave them thus saith the lord i proved it i vindicated it if they won't take it god is saying it's not on me it's on them they're going to suffer the consequences of the opportunity they passed on god was faithful god gave this age a faithful messenger and a faithful message and vindicated it around the world with more supernatural and and to me the greatest supernatural element of the message is what it's done to my life and what it's done to your life hallelujah and it's an opportunity of a lifetime and people would rather have they'd rather heap to themselves teachers having itching ears to tell them what they want to hear just get a preacher to tell them they're okay when they're not okay see now watch verse 13 but the word of the lord was unto them precept upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here little they're little that they might go and fall backward and be broken and snared and taken in other words god once they understood once it was clear that they were going to go against the word then god doubled down to make sure it was precept upon precept line upon line it was a little bit here it was a little bit there but it was clear and i made it right and you can't accuse me of wrong and therefore you're going to destroy your own self because i brought you such a perfect word and you declined to hear it watch verse 14. wherefore hear the word of the lord you scornful men that rule this people which is in jerusalem because you have said we have made a covenant with death and with hell are we at agreement when the overflowing scourge shall pass through it shall not come unto us for we have made lies our refuge and under falsehood have we hit ourselves now hold right there on verse 15 g now i want you to notice a couple of words i want you to notice covenant i want you to notice agreement i want you to notice uh refuge and i want you to notice hidden it hid hit ourselves so these people who had enough sense about them to know that judgments are coming to know that the world is falling apart everybody can see that that's not new they say that in the headlines of the news the world is falling apart and men's hearts are failing for fear and they're running to and fro and knowledge is increased and the more knowledge they get the more death is associated with it these things are incontrovertible they're undeniable but to deny it brother branham said would be to run down in a basement board up all the windows and start screaming there is no sun there's no such a thing as the sun he said that that man would be labeled insane just because you ran down there and brought up all the windows and client claim there's no sun doesn't mean there's no sun sun's still right there see but madness has taken you to the point where you're going to openly deny it and and literally they they know the judgment is coming and so they so they realize that they need a place to hide for refuge and so they're going to enter into an agreement through a covenant and they're going to say wow danger was coming we got to hire we need to hide boys what kind of place a place of refuge where we'll be okay okay well how do we get that well i know somebody i know a guy and and i can we can enter into a covenant with him and make an agreement and then we can hide in his place of refuge good idea that'll work and then god says because you have said we made a covenant but what they didn't know is they made a covenant with death and with hell imagine that thinking you're going to escape the place that you don't want to be and that's the very covenant you make to be there see they make a covenant with death and hell are we at agreement when the overflowing scourge shall pass through it shall not come to us for we have made here's what they didn't know here's what they didn't know we made lies our refuge and under falsehood have we hid ourselves and god says verse 16 therefore thus saith the lord god behold i lay in zion for a foundation a stone tried a stone a precious cornerstone a sure foundation he that believeth shall not make haste judgment also will i lay to the line in righteousness to the plummet and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies and the water shall overflow the hiding place and your covenant with death shall be disannulled and your agreement with hell shall not stand when the overflowing scourge shall pass through then shall ye be trodden down by it from the time that it goeth forth it shall take it shall take you for morning by morning shall it pass over by day and by night and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report see for the for the bed is shorter than a man can stretch himself on this is describing sin this is the vexation of choosing lies as your shelter now you know you've heard me many years bethel tabernacle tell you what is the worst form of deception there's many kinds but there's one that's particularly grievous and that's self-deception that's the worst kind of deception see and he says now watch here's the grievousness of choosing sin for the bed is shorter than a man can stretch himself on that's that's not a good night's sleep and the covering narrower than he can wrap himself in it that's miserable for the lord shall rise up and mount perism he shall be wrath as in the valley of gibeon that he may do his work his strange work and bring to pass his act his strange act now therefore be not markers lest your bands be made strong for i have heard from the lord god of host a consumption even determined upon the whole earth give you ear hear my voice hearken and hear my speech here's an opportunity to not go in a tribulation take it or leave it here's an opportunity to be counted among the redeemed or not see verse 24 that the plowman plow all date is doth he does he open and break the clods of his ground when he has made plain the face thereof doth does he not cast abroad the fetches and scatter the cumin and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rye in their place in other words do you think god's just doing this for no purpose do you not i mean would a farmer just take a plow into the field and just plow forever why is he plowing to sow seed why is he selling seed to raise a crop and and the prophet is saying to you do you think god is just plowing do you think time's just going to go on do you think this thing will just keep going on and on i'm here to tell you it won't no more than a farmer would do that can you get the farmer can you see that analogy yeah no farmer would do that neither will god he expects a harvest and he's going to get a harvest and whatever doesn't go into the harvest goes into the furnace amen for his god doth instruct him verse 26 to discretion and doth teach him for the fitches are not threshed with the threshing instrument neither is a cartwheel turned about upon the coma but the fitches are beaten out with a staff and the cumin with a rod bread corn is bruised because he will not ever be threshing it see nor break it with the wheel of the cart nor bruise it with the horseman this also cometh forth from the lord of hosts which is wonderful in council and excellent in working in other words god knows how to handle you god's not going to treat corn the same way he would treat cooma he's not going to treat fetches the same way he treats this that or the other god some of it he's going to put under will some of it he's going to do this somebody's going to do that someone but he won't do this that's you that's me we're all different god knows me god knows you he knows what i need he knows what you need all he needs you to do is is give in and say lord harvest me harvest me grow me to a harvest however you need to i'm not going to compare myself to this person because i might not be the same type you might need a different way to deal with me so deal with me the way i need to be dealt with amen verse chapter 29 woe to ariel this is jerusalem woe to ariel to ariel the city where david dwelt add ye year to year let them kill sacrifices yet i will distress ariel and there shall be heaviness and sorrow and it shall be unto me as aerial and in other words i know what i'm doing and i will camp against thee round about and will lay siege against it against thee with the mount and i will raise forts against thee and thou shalt be brought down and shall speak out of the ground and thy speech shall be low out of the dust and the voice shall be as one that hath the familiar spirit out of the ground and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust this is this is what god is saying this is the consequence of the options you chose i gave you an opportunity you go back into into the old testament deeply and god has a covenants of blessing and he has covenants of chastisement and they're they're both love you understand god loves his family he loves israel that's why he won't let him off the hook so you you've got the option listen god is not some evil ogre i'm not here today to tell you that this horrible god who wipes out people you know are you an evil ogre because you correct your children in love what would you do as a parent he's not a he's not a tyrant he's a father he has a family what would you do with a disobedient child you would chastise him in love what do you do with a child that's obedient compliant and does the chores and keeps his word and is honest and helps the family what do you do you pour blessing upon that child what do you do to the child who's arrogant nasty and horrible you you don't poor blessing i hope you're not that stupid that's why children rise up to torment their parents in the last days because they've stopped correcting are you an evil ogre for doing that are you horrible for doing that wouldn't don't you want your family to be obedient fathers mothers come on don't don't go feeling bad at god don't you want your children to be obedient don't you want them to be honest decent productive people in society don't you want them to be a blessing to the home so you know what you do you take steps to ensure that and when they go sideways your love compels you to do things that they're not gonna like and even you might not like doing it you'd rather be giving them a blessing so would god amen but how do you act that that's how he acts don't don't feel bad at him you're the same way see and so so so look what he says here more verse 5 moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust in the multitude of the terrible and shall be as chaff that passes the way yea it shall be as an instant suddenly he goes on and on and on and on he verse nine he picks up the blindness of hypocrisy that's a terrible thing we you can go home and read it verse 15 he finally comes back around and begins to build hope back in them again because they are his family and they are his children and a parent doesn't whip his child all day you know what you did just stand here and i'm just going to wear you out till this time tomorrow there were times i thought sister jean would do that but she didn't actually do that but he he's he's a father so he's going to correct he has chest covenant chastisements and he has covenant blessings and so so the lord is saying here that's all gee thank you so the lord is saying that he's going to bring the city into distress this is what as a father ariel this is what i'm going to have to do to you darling i'm sorry i love you ephraim you'll be i can never lose you you are you are part of me and i'll never lose you but the choices you've made and are making are forcing my hand because i love you too much to leave you like you are and he's saying to jerusalem you know i'm going to have to bring distress i'm going to have to bring lamentation i'm going to have to turn your joy into mourning to to the degree if we keep reading and i'm not i'm not going to keep reading because we just use it all of our time but if you keep going on down through there you find out that it that that that israel becomes like an altar hearth and that it in that it would become a place of death you see here if if if we treat lightly if we treat lightly the sacrifices god has made available then we ourselves become the sacrifice let me say that again if you treat lightly the sacrifices god has made an opportunity for and made sacrifices so you could have joy sacrifices so you could have power sacrifices so you could have peace but if but something had to suffer for you to get that something died we they slew a lamb they slew a bullock jesus died on the cross amen you know but but but if you refuse if you treat lightly all of these sacrifices then you yourself become the sacrifice if we will not one one writer says if we will not accept god's substitute then we must carry the burden of our own sin good luck with that if you will not accept the sacrifice of christ to carry your sins far away then you'll have to carry your sins yourself this is this is actually why the the unwise virgin will have to be the sacrifice themselves giving their own lives in the tribulation because they rejected the sacrifice provided by the bleeding word of this hour so you know what happens to them they become the sacrifice they have to no option now now there's no opportunity because they passed on the opportunity to miss that now they're now their only opportunity is to die in the tribulation period and die and be judged for their sins because they would not allow christ to be judged for their sins because christ is his word and when he brought us his word it's a living word it's a bleeding word and when you refuse his living bleeding word then you've got to be the sacrifice you've got to go yourself if you won't take good counsel if you won't take good preaching then you'll suffer the consequences if you won't take mom and dad's godly instruction then you'll bury yourself see amen so so so then that we find that the days were coming in the millennium of course when god's going to remove all of these cursings and you know these covenant chastenings and he's going to restore uh israel to covenant blessings and so isaiah 29 now i still got you i want 15 more minutes you got me all right so isaiah 28 and 29 really is a sad story about a people who were given ample opportunity to prosper under the wonderful hand of god and you read it with me you read it with me but they spurned the goodness of god and they wasted all of the promises for a better outcome they had many promises to give them a much better outcome than what you just read they made the choice knowing full well god was lined up online precept upon precept here a little there a little he warned them everywhere brought prophets raised them up showed signs and wonders see that's what's happening today the world is truly without excuse their sad end would come suddenly and when it did it wouldn't have any remedy to it so so so i you know i i i i've said many times that that the wailing the weeping and wailing in the tribulation period to me you know it's surely going to be at least in part at least in part that weeping and wailing is going to be the bitterness of missed opportunity and what could have been and what needless suffering that they must face see so so so then then that's why last last week when we read remember we took you're not gonna do it again today i don't have time but we took you to romans eight and paul showed us paul said hey set up good news pay attention to this guess what you pay you're not a debtor to flesh anymore how you like that devil we're not debtors to the flesh anymore we've been set free by the holy spirit the rest of the world they're in debt they can't escape doing evil things thinking evil things but by the blood of the lamb i'm free i'm not a debtor to the flesh i don't have to go that way anymore see there's even no temptation that can take me but god won't make but god will make a way within it that i can escape now he doesn't say you will escape he says you can you could you might not but you could i'll make a way if you'll take it amen so you know you don't have to live after your flesh paul was saying you've been liberated the world of course has no such liberated liberation but you are elected in the genes of god before the foundation of the world and god being a heavenly father is simply not going to let his children misbehave without lovingly correcting them see so so brother branham makes this statement here in in the greater uh greater than solomon is here 1964. he's in a prayer this so moved me yesterday he said our heavenly father there's a prophet praying so you want to pay attention our heavenly father we are deeming this one of the most grandest privileges that we have this side of glory you're like wow i really want to know what the next line is the grandest privilege elijah you're about to tell me the secret of the ages you're about to give me insider trading info the devil's probably not going to want me to hear this hurry quickly tell me before he distracts me the grandest the grandest privilege that we have this side of glory is to meet in the congregation to come into a building and sit with your brothers and sisters and hear the gospel preached and sing the songs and raise up hands and fellowship one another see the of the to meet in the congregation of the people who believe in you that where we can expect your presence because it's according to your promise what an opportunity you have multiple times in a week to do the greatest to exercise your right to the greatest privilege grandest privilege this side of glory and people let careers keep them out of it schedule keep them out of it fear keep them out of it family keep them out of it this keep them out of it entertainment recreation and and you forsake the opportunity that god chose as the greatest tool for your strength there is a strength that you can gain from being here not just in these four walls but anywhere where the word is being preached and believers are gathering you know why because his presence is in our midst and when you're in the can you can you imagine taking lightly to be in the presence of someone who can do anything anything he can fix anything in you for you conquer anything give you anything help you no matter what it is with a with a wave of his hand drive every sickness from your body with a wave of his hand settle your mind and heart on the peace and love of god and you can be around brothers and sisters in christ and yet laodicea has deprioritized that in so many believers it's alarming it's alarming you know you you have choices you can make every young man young women they're they're looking someday i want to find happiness i want to be married i want to have a family you know a boy seeking girl girl seeking boy perfectly normal and and yet you know my advice especially to girls you know is my goodness sister whatever you do find a man don't just find a male a male is one of the most dangerous animals in the planet if he's not a man my by manhood i mean character manhood is an office brothers you don't get to be a man just because you're male 1 you might be a 50 year old male and have never been a man one day in your life manhood speaks of character god said let us make man in our image after our likeness you want a happy home sister find a male who's living according to the image of god you'll have a happy home you'll be taken care of you will never be lied to you you'll you'll you'll have peace and you'll you'll have trust and you can have a family and you can pass along these great things my goodness don't go out here dressing to appease because you're never going to attract the son of god that way hear me sisters dress like the world you're never going to attract a son of god and that's the one you need you get anything less than that and you are looking for a crippled life i'm here to tell you take brother jason's word for it i've been on this planet almost six decades i've seen the good the bad and the ugly i've seen women cry and weep and sob in bitter tears because there's no way to undo it because they they got so desperate that they started letting down their own standards and all that did was put them further and further away from the son of god some god wouldn't give them time of day and so they had to settle for a male who was pretty nice kind of handsome but that don't last brother same way solomon said that a bad woman is like water in your blood you said you'd rather deal in the live in the wilderness than with that you'd rather just live on a house top never come down than to live with a contentious woman that there's nothing there's simultaneously it's it's it's a paradox there is nothing that can be so low down or so glorious to god as a female she has an opportunity to be the lowest creature on the earth and abandon her babies and cheat on her marriage vows other female animals don't do that you understand me they're not they're other female animals are not immoral only a human female can live immorally or she can be the greatest treasure and even even on the other side when brother branham crossed to the other side it wasn't the brothers who were first in line to meet him it was the ladies because they kept themselves and they became a treasure to god and brother branham scored him so high he said it's literally the greatest thing god could give a man outside of his salvation outside of eternal life a good wife is the so brothers you are to honor if you got a good wife honor her because god does so sisters if you're looking for a son of god then act like a daughter of god you'll attract the son of god see and so so you know the the world has come oh i'm gonna just use up all my time i'm not gonna get to my main thought but i don't need long to get it so just hang on brother branham says we're deeming this one of the most grandest privileges i know that's jacked up english kentucky hillbilly-ish but just take it will you it's one of the most grandest privileges that we have this site of glory is to meet in the congregation i don't hear me hear me look me in the eye i don't judge i'm not here today to make you feel bad i don't judge you i don't condemn you if you don't feel this way but i wish you did i wish you did i wish when i read this quote here you'd go yes lord yes lord if you don't feel this way i'm not here to judge or condemn you but i sure wish you did feel this way i sure wish you saw it as the greatest privilege this side of glory i'm sorry that the devil hear me now because i'm getting down this real personal i'm sorry that the devil has been able to get people to re sons and daughters of god to reduce their involvement with the family of god that breaks my heart i'm sorry that that that the devil has been able to reduce your involvement that's satan that's done that to you see the lord would have never done that that's satan that did that but you played a part amen come on be honest the lord would have never allowed him to do that to you because his word actually promises the very opposite but you played a part in that come on churches this shall be called the house of judgment let's be honest i'm in this with you friends i have to say amen to this as well or old me or oh my oh goodness lord help me i said plenty of lord help me when i was studying this see so sometimes we play a part in it god designed the plan for his family to gather together as an opportunity to receive strength from it and people allow satan to manipulate their minds manipulate their emotions draw them away i don't know troubles trials i mean who don't have them come on who don't have them troubles trials fears hurt feelings can i say this to you if you have let troubles and trials and fears and hurt feelings cause you to back away from this grandest of all privileges i'm here to tell you satan will never let you off of that merry-go-round all he'll do is when you start to get a little bit of confidence and ready to defeat it he'll bring another one and another one and another one and there's five more behind that one and ten more behind that one he will never ever let you off of that merry-go-round i say to you today jump off of it yourself just jump off of that today jesus will catch you you don't have to go in that way and so the religious leaders of the day when jesus was there and i'm coming i'm really right now near the bottom of my notes when jesus was in his day the religious leaders called him a devil it's interesting because the day before philip saw the same sign and said you're the messiah you're the king of israel and religious leaders the next day see the same sign and go oh he's be elizabeth okay wait a minute how do i i mean he he said he's the king of israel you said he's a devil and philip was a man studied in the word of god see and so so we find that that the the mystery of that because it doesn't make a lot of sense until you read in the scriptures further and you uncover a little dirty secret that they that they don't want you to know the religious leaders that the bible says for envy even pilate caught it i see what this is i'm a politician pilot thought i know politics nasty politics when i see it this is for envy this is why they hate him he's done nothing wrong he's actually done only only good but they hate him because of envy because they know they'll lose members they'll lose their position they won't have their little honey pot anymore and so it was for envy see and and and and and i see what that looks like today i see what that looks like today so in other words in other words let me make this point before i come to my con consummation i it's no mystery to me today why religious leaders reject this message because i see what it looks like when they did it back there you understand i can look in my bible i can look at the rejection you see today brother jd and i were talking about it today and and i can see why they reject him and call him a false prophet i can see why they do that because i can see why they did it to jesus so in other words i know what i'm seeing i know what i'm seeing i know that when they do it in this day it's going to look just like it did in that day you follow me you get that you you follow that so you you find that that you can these patterns are all you know all in the bible i i see what that looks like because i can see what it looked like when it happened in his life and so so i'm not here today to i'm not in fact his let me just say this i'm not even here to major on that the blind lead the blind it's not my fault i'll preach as hard as i can people have to accept it or reject it that's between them and god it's not up to me all i know is as for me and my house we're gonna serve the lord so i'm not even here to to to to major on that i already know that that has to repeat in this day so i'm not here today to stress over that i'm not here to lash out at people for making the same choice and refusing the opportunity that he gives in his word at the end time but but i but i see another thing i see another thing that that doesn't stress me it actually thrills me because in his day many were sick and afflicted and and and often often times it didn't even take great feats of faith to get healed all they had to do was know that he could do it and walked up and asked him and because he was so full of compassion he just healed them if i know what it looked like then i could know what it looks like now and you might be sick and afflicted in your body you don't gotta jump through fire you don't gotta run to the ends of the earth you don't got to cross the ocean and bring him back or go up to heaven and bring him down he's among you now and he's full of compassion and to say lord heal me today i need healing today in my body i see him in thomas that's important when thomas doubted him that's important to me because i have too often found myself like thomas amen i wanted to believe it was true some promise of god but so many isn't that true so many unexpected circumstances weary our minds because it it doesn't turn out like you thought and you read a promise and you pray a prayer and you have an expectation and then somehow it's almost like either god didn't hear me or he chose to ignore me or i asked for a fish and he gave me a serpent which jesus said he would never do that i asked for bread and he gave me a stone that's only because you think that that's because the circumstance didn't meet your what you thought it should be but god would never do that god answers your prayer god always answers prayer sometimes his answer is no and people don't want to hear that sometimes his answer is um yeah i'll do it but not not right now sometimes his answer is yes i'll do it but not like you think and sometimes if we're honest friends we can stand i'm not here to condemn brother thomas i'm here to say i get thomas especially in laodicea when we can find ourselves so weary in our mind because of a cascade of disappointment after disappointment after disappointment after disappointment and and and we find that it takes a toll on our mind things don't always turn out like we like we're sure they would or we were convinced they we we were convinced we were concerned and we had even taken a stand and then everything still went wrong and that was exactly what happened to thomas even the road to emmaus these brothers are weary and jesus said why are you downcast said well we thought did you not hear about what things have happened about the messiah and jesus of nazareth and we thought it had been he that should be deliver israel and when that happens friends satan rushes in to give you false answers to trouble your mind i want to tell you you need to resist that because when that creates a vacuum when things don't go the way you think they should have and you were convinced you are sure you knew the will of god in it and you went forward and it just doesn't pan out that creates a vacuum of doubt and fear and and and disillusionment and i'm here to tell you satan just looks for those opportunities to come in and say see he doesn't love you you must not be a child of god there's some problem with this and some problem with that oh i'm here to tell you oh i love the fact that jesus cared about thomas jesus cared for thomas jesus cared so much that even though he he didn't have to do it but he actually on purpose says shows up and says thomas come here feel go ahead i know you're weary in your mind you want to believe me i know you love me but circumstances have weared your son go ahead touch me go ahead put your hand right here i'm good with it i want you to be a believer and i'll do whatever i got to do so you can believe me this is the this is the compassionate christ who is here today this is the one who gives you opportunity after opportunity i see simon oh my last example i see simon and i see me i see simon and i see you so what is it you see in simon brother jason i see a man who loved jesus with all his heart all his mind all his body all his soul he loved jesus do you believe it and yet he failed in his flesh one of the most horrible failures one could imagine denied that he not only denied the lord not only delight denied his innocence denied even knew him and even got mad and cussed to try to convince people of his lie so he added drama even to it but jesus loved him and that's why i read that's why i started with mark mark 14 or mark 16 that when those women came and brother caleb said he's not here that smile he's risen go and tell his disciples oh hey and tell peter make sure you tell peter and when you and then you read the other gospels you're going to find that when jesus comes and appears and there's peter and nothing's brought up jesus isn't going to humiliate him or embarrass him but jesus is watching and peter imagine how peter felt there in the in the room when jesus walked in oh it's him and then he says to thomas and gives him that wonderful gift and peter's just standing there dying the death dying the death of embarrassment and guilt and humiliation of what he did and jesus isn't even going to mention the elephant in the room and then another time he appears at the sea of tiberias and they're out there fishing peter says i don't know what to do anymore i'm just going to go fishing you know why because it just seemed like what are we even doing we thought he would be the king that's not gonna happen they're still asking him that on the mount of olives okay now were you finally okay now finally finally now will you restore israel and they're still missing it they're still missing it they don't even understand it's going to be 2 000 years before he does that he's first going to call a gentile bride to their shock and dismay a gentile bride yes peter's going to be one of the first ones in the house of cornelius and have to come back and explain himself to his brothers what can i do the holy ghost fell on them like it did us what was i going to do resist god this was a real man say brother jason why are you why are you dramatizing because i want you to see he was a real person he was just like you and he made a horrible mistake but he loved god but he made a horrible mistake but with all of his mind and with all of his heart and with all of his soul he loved the lord until finally jesus made him say it peter loveth thou me and peter couldn't just go he said he would say no peter i need to hear you say it do you love me yes lord i love you ask him again peter you love me yes i love you because peter needed to hear himself say it and you need to hear yourself say i'm a believer i love god i know i fail i have failed i might fail but i love the lord with all my heart and with all my mind and i'm taking the opportunity that he has offered me today to forgive me to call me back to his side no matter how many times i fail and he said peter i've prayed for you how many want jesus to intercede on your behalf life is often a maze of perplexity friends often as we read last time it's just a few days and full of trouble but there is someone who cares and knows the answers you need won't you stand up with me brother
