========================================

morality is a necessary spring of popular government and human rights can only be assured among a virtuous people right so what's happened is around the mid-1800s is when this really started coming into effect though you didn't really see it really come into full force until 100 years later the culmination of that would you had people operating politically under a framework of liberalism and morally under a framework of Christianity until the mid-1800s in which Christianity starts getting subverted by what I have heard called and I think it's a pretty good name for it of scientism right we believe in science science is the is the way to define truth well no science will tell you what the world is does not tell you what you ought to do with that world right liberal is you know politics can tell you that you are a free moral agent right you have the right to do what you want but it doesn't tell you what you ought to do with that freedom so what people have done is they've they've gotten a whole lot of freedom without any with no no more moral they don't know what to do with it anymore and because there's no there's no restriction on its Society has become the Pervert you know like I said it's a baby with a loaded pistol they don't know what they're doing you don't you know this is how when you when you strip all of the the moral what you ought to do right good Christian values you know uh uh the the law of God from people when you when people have no conscience no no um teaching on what's right and wrong nobody knows what to do this is how you get the same political framework that gave you the founding fathers will give you the people who marched down the street today you know talking about how you know we're here and we're queer and we're coming for your children it's the same liberal it's the same framework and or or I mean there's a whole there's a whole a whole uh you know we could spend a lot of time I don't want to get bogged down on you know how bad things are today and we can talk Ad nauseam on that the point is you all know where what time you're living in there's a lot of evil things that are happening and a lot of it is done under the under the the domain of well I'm a free American and I can do whatever I want fair enough but you should know better right if you were a Christian you'd know better and oh man I gotta so people people today they've developed a political system in which everybody's very free to do whatever they want but in doing so at the same time they've exchanged their morals for bondage for spiritual bondage right because you go to the average American and say ah you know you're a slave and they say we be sons of George Washington we've never been enslaved right it says uh yeah but are you sure about that right I wrote this as kind of like a little I don't know a parable or an allegory maybe says a slave to sin and depravity Works vigorously on the plantation of hedonistic pleasure the owner of the hellish estate has set over him three task Masters Mr eyes Mr flesh and Mr pride of life each drives the slave ever harder to harvest damnation with the lashing whips of lust and should this slave ever make his attempt at freedom and fail then the wrath of these cruel Masters is fierce indeed the blows rained down and burn the Flesh of The Wretched slave with the ever hotter flames of fiery passion to teach him the lesson of hopelessness and so you people like Oh I'm a free American okay Mr free American put down your booze and walk away and don't pick up alcohol ever again put down your pack of cigarettes or your vape and walk away and don't ever pick it up you know how many men are you are willing to say I'm free okay then walk away from porn you know how many how many people are okay I'm free I can do whatever I want okay stop gossiping stop backbiting drop your your hot temper you know don't you know your that bitterness that you won't let go of walk away from it try it once and when that thing comes around and whoops you and beats you into submission tell me how free you are of it right it's people are are are in bondage spiritually everywhere because there's no because because there's there is no there's no spiritual Liberty there is no spiritual freedom and so when when Jesus is saying the truth shall make you free that's what he's talking about right because and I I like the it's an interesting way he says this right Jesus said the truth shall make you free people always say that the truth will set you free and there's a and this might be a little bit you know getting lost in the exact verbiage Maybe but I think that it's important to think about it in the way that the truth will make you free right because if you bear the if you if if you are made free you now bear the burden of responsibility you have a responsibility to do with that freedom the right thing right and if you are if oftentimes people don't actually want freedom right in the book of Exodus um pull up uh if you wouldn't mind uh pull up Exodus 21 verse 1. you know yeah okay it says now these are the judgments which Thou shalt set before in verse two um yeah if they'll buy a Hebrew servant six years He Shall Serve and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing if he came in by himself he shall go out by himself if he were married then his wife shall go out with him if his master have given him a wife and she have borne him Sons or daughters the wife and her children shall be her Masters and he shall go out himself and if a servant shall plainly say I love my master my wife and my children I will not go out free then his master shall bring him unto the judges he shall also bring him to the door or unto the doorpost and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl and he shall serve him forever so here's a situation in which you hear there's a Slave who really enjoys the lifestyle that his master has given him right he's got a family he's got maybe a nice job maybe he's not it's not too rough working here he's got plenty of food you know he's got a good he's got a good setup here he doesn't want to go out and live on his own and have to be the master of his own destiny right doesn't want to have to be the one who has to go out there and and and be responsible for what happens to him because as long as he's a slave something bad happens is really not his fault right it's the guy who was in charge's Fault so people will happily allow them like this is a reason why somebody might not want necessarily want freedom a lot of times people will they'll have some Vice they'll have some thing that they are that they are a slave to spiritually and they don't really want the responsibility that comes with freedom from that thing right they don't really want they don't they kind of like that demon that they've got right it just feels really nice right they like they like it now they might consciously yeah okay I can't you know I it's a bad thing I should do something about it yeah but you're not trying you know you're not you're not you don't really want free of it do you you know but the reality is when you come in contact this is why this is why the truth makes you free right oftentimes it's making you free because I feel like if you say it sets you free well that kind of implies a choice doesn't it but oftentimes the you know when you when you come in in contact with the truth right because if we read that again you know Jesus said that he was the truth the way in the life right you know we've so often said that you know when pilate asks Jesus what is truth and Jesus you know that's the wrong question to ask right it's who is truth because Jesus said in that in in John chapter 8 where we read he says um yeah it says in in verse 32 and he says and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free but then in verse 36 says if the son therefore shall make you free you should be free indeed so here's Jesus in his right there there saying implying that it is him the truth that will make you free is Jesus himself right so there's not a really what where people are um where people are get hung up in their in these situations where you you know people can't get out of it it's showing that really you know the solution so oftentimes people turn to all kinds of different different solutions right you know we want to analyze ourselves and make it oh well this you know maybe maybe I am the way that I am because of this or have some sort of psychological explanation or a medical explanation or whatever and that's not necessarily against that but really when people are are bound on up on things that they can't get rid of that they can't let go of that they can't and again I don't want to just make this as some sort of like addiction or a vice it could be anything I mean it could be bitterness or anger or a grudge that they can't let go of you know I mean this this happens people end up a slave to their own hurts and their own where people did them wrong well the reality is we can try to fix this on some sort of psychological level but but really the the the freedom from that is going to come through close the closer you get to God himself right the closer you get to the Lord Jesus the closer you're going to get to freedom because he is the he is the actual path to Freedom you know whatever whatever that solution may be God can fix it right whatever whatever your problem is God can can resolve that a relationship with the Lord is always going to bring freedom from things and it's going to make you free and it's him doing the make it's him making right it's not it's not you being allowed to be free and walking away it is Christ coming in and breaking that thing away and and making you free right it's his work not yours and um man I gotta I think I'm gonna wrap it up about right there and I don't want to steal too much time from the song leader I am the song leader of uh so we'll we'll stand and I'll wrap it up there and uh I'll try to pick this up at a later date it's about our hearts Lord father thank you for this opportunity to maybe say something that would help the people Laura asked that it would whatever with my my broken speaking would maybe be exactly what somebody would have needed to hear father not through anything that I could have done but because you would take the words and make them fall where they would need to fall so Lord that I ask that you would go with the people father that you would anoint our service going forward be with us throughout the song service be with us father you would hear our praise and our worship that we'd have the opportunity to praise your name and tell you how much we love you that you would be pleased to come down and speak to our hearts in the greatest form of worship which is the hearing of your word we asked these things in the holy and precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
