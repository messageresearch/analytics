[26:32] amen amen amen if you have your Bibles
[26:35] let's turn to math Mark let's turn to
[26:38] Mark the 5th chapter
[26:42] Mark chapter
[26:47] five praise the
[26:50] Lord Happy New Year to Beth of
[26:53] Tabernacle
[26:55] am we're going to say what we always say
[26:58] man I haven't seen y'all since last
[27:02] year
[27:06] amen but it's good to be together again
[27:09] amen Mark chapter 5 let's start reading
[27:12] at verse 24 if you have your
[27:14] bibles if you have it say
[27:16] Amen the Bible says and Jesus went with
[27:19] him and much people followed him and
[27:23] thrown him Mark
[27:26] 5 verse
[27:29] 25 and a certain woman which had an
[27:32] issue of blood 12 years and had suffered
[27:35] many things of many Physicians and had
[27:39] spent all that she had and was nothing
[27:42] better but rather grew
[27:44] worse when she had heard of Jesus came
[27:49] in the press behind and touched His
[27:51] Garment for she said if I may touch but
[27:56] his clothes I Shall
[27:58] Behold and straightway the Fountain of
[28:01] her blood was dried up and she felt in
[28:04] her body that she was healed of that
[28:08] plague and Jesus immediately knowing in
[28:12] himself that virtue had gone out of him
[28:16] turned him about in the press and said
[28:20] who touched my cloes let's go to Hebrews
[28:23] chapter
[28:26] 11
[28:39] Hebrews chapter 11 verse
[28:43] 1 the Bible says now Faith is the
[28:47] substance of things hoped for the
[28:49] evidence of Things Not Seen for by it
[28:53] the elders obtained a good report
[28:56] through faith we we understand that the
[28:58] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[29:03] that the things which are seen were not
[29:05] made of things which do appear by faith
[29:09] Abel offered unto God a more excellent
[29:12] sacrifice than Cain by which he had
[29:15] obtained witness that he was righteous
[29:18] God testifying of his gifts and by it he
[29:22] being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch
[29:26] was trans translated that he should not
[29:29] see death and was not found because God
[29:33] had translated him for before his
[29:36] translation he had this testimony that
[29:40] he pleased God but without faith it is
[29:44] impossible to please him for he is for
[29:49] he that cometh to God must believe that
[29:52] he is and that he is a rewarder of them
[29:56] that diligently
[29:57] seek Him amen may the Lord a bless
[30:00] reading of his word you can have your
[30:05] seat praise the
[30:08] Lord
[30:10] tonight by the grace of God I want
[30:13] to step into a
[30:15] place amen I want to step into a place
[30:19] and call us message tonight moments of
[30:23] inspiration amen
[30:26] amen and and tonight by God's grace
[30:29] we're going to be talking about
[30:33] faith and not just any kind of Faith but
[30:36] perfect Faith right amen and you know
[30:39] even in this message you know I've been
[30:40] listening to this message over and over
[30:42] and over again I'm not necessarily
[30:43] talking about the message in general but
[30:45] I'm talking about this particular
[30:47] message perfect Faith you know and in
[30:50] this you know the prophet he said a lot
[30:52] of things about faith but he really
[30:55] zeroed in on perfect faith
[30:58] and you know uh there were many times in
[31:00] the scripture where Jesus would would
[31:03] would tell the disciples or different
[31:05] ones in the Bible that you can receive
[31:07] this according to your faith and then
[31:10] there was areas in the word where things
[31:12] took place and Jesus rebuked them for
[31:15] not having enough Faith but this is the
[31:19] question did they not have enough or was
[31:22] they not inspired enough all right
[31:26] because when we think about God Amen uh
[31:30] my inspiration for this is sowing and
[31:32] reaping Hallelujah and if I had to say
[31:35] tonight if you sow Faith you reap
[31:38] evidence Hallelujah all right because
[31:41] there's a law in sowing and reaping so
[31:44] tonight if you sow Faith you should reap
[31:46] the evidence of what you believe and you
[31:49] know church as I begin to think about
[31:51] sowing and reaping in faith and giving
[31:53] unto God that which he given to you if
[31:56] you give it back you should get the
[31:57] results amen hallelujah of what God gave
[32:01] you amen and you know God is giving each
[32:04] and every one of us in here faith I
[32:07] don't want to talk about The Measure of
[32:09] Faith right now what I want to talk
[32:11] about is that everybody in this room has
[32:14] Faith but what I want to come to amen
[32:18] that God has come in our day and given a
[32:23] measure of faith that should come to
[32:25] Perfection all right Hallelujah
[32:27] you and I our faith shouldn't be just
[32:30] the faith to open up a bubblegum
[32:34] wrapper Hallelujah just the faith to tie
[32:37] your shoe amen no it's something greater
[32:40] than that Hallelujah but I want to say
[32:43] this that faith is in the building
[32:46] tonight Hallelujah because look the
[32:49] prophet wouldn't preach that message if
[32:51] there wasn't a people on the earth that
[32:53] could fulfill or come to perfect faith
[32:56] and let me say like this if you heard it
[32:59] it might be because you're able to come
[33:01] up to it Hallelujah because God is not a
[33:04] God who wastes his time Hallelujah and
[33:07] one thing I want you to understand
[33:09] Hallelujah God is a god of Seasons
[33:12] Hallelujah and in the right season he
[33:15] said it would make itself known
[33:17] Hallelujah so the faith that you need
[33:20] Hallelujah could it be in you already
[33:23] all right Hallelujah and you might you
[33:25] might say well brother D when you going
[33:27] with it well let's look at sewing and
[33:28] reaping for a second you know when a
[33:31] farmer when you think about sewing you
[33:33] think about planting amen church and you
[33:36] know what a farmer does he goes and
[33:39] plant amen and he has in his mind what
[33:43] he wants to plant so what does he do he
[33:46] goes and get it in seed form
[33:48] first Hallelujah GL and when God planted
[33:53] his word hallelujah he put it down
[33:56] inside of of us in seed form all right
[33:59] and you know what that that that that
[34:01] farmer does when he plants it the
[34:04] prophet God say he can't keep going back
[34:07] digging it up saying where are my apples
[34:10] no once is planted now he has to believe
[34:14] what he sold he sold it in what
[34:18] faith Hallelujah he sold the seed in
[34:22] faith and now he has to trust Hallelujah
[34:26] that whatever situation or whatever it
[34:28] takes for that seed to come forth is
[34:31] going to come forth in its own time
[34:34] Hallelujah but what that what that that
[34:36] that farmer does he has to believe in
[34:40] his
[34:41] product right Glory oh my I feel
[34:45] religious brother vir I feel religious
[34:47] tonight hallelujah praise God you know
[34:51] think about it church that farmer let's
[34:54] just say it's apples cuz you know the
[34:56] prophet talk about apples
[34:57] that farmer he goes and buys Apple Seeds
[35:00] he doesn't get the seed and say I wonder
[35:04] I wonder if I plant this if apples is
[35:07] going to come forth no when he possesses
[35:09] the seed he's confident that everything
[35:12] in that seed will come
[35:15] forth and the thing about a farmer when
[35:18] he plants he doesn't just planted
[35:21] anywhere he planted Hallelujah in a
[35:25] place where he can get a return
[35:28] W Hallelujah he puts it in the ground
[35:32] Hallelujah he also Hallelujah has to
[35:35] believe in that ground by faith because
[35:39] he can't make the ground do something
[35:41] that it cannot do Hallelujah the ground
[35:44] he has to trust in the ground by faith
[35:48] he has to stand back and say I'm going
[35:50] to trust that the seed will come forth
[35:53] I'm going to trust Hallelujah that what
[35:55] I'm planting will come forth so it all
[35:58] becomes a sewing of faith and God has
[36:02] did the same thing Hallelujah God has
[36:05] put his word in us before the foundation
[36:08] of the world but God has to come back
[36:10] and Trust his own
[36:19] planting Oh my he has to come back and
[36:25] trust that that where he planted the
[36:28] seed it will come forth amen you say but
[36:31] he's God listen to Hebrews he said we
[36:36] understand that by faith the worlds were
[36:38] framed amen see so God used his own
[36:42] faith Hallelujah to speak things into
[36:45] existence so it's going if you I any of
[36:48] us bring anything forth concerning God
[36:52] it has to be a measure of what faith
[36:56] amen hly faith is the substance of
[36:59] things what hope
[37:01] for then it
[37:03] becomes the
[37:05] evidence of Things Not Seen Hallelujah
[37:10] and you know what that farmer does he
[37:13] plants it and then he walks away from it
[37:17] and that seed has to go through the
[37:20] motions all by
[37:23] itself but one thing the seed doesn't
[37:25] know the farmer is still watching over
[37:30] it Hallelujah he makes sure H as it
[37:34] begins to grow that the deers or the
[37:37] Cotes or whatever that can eat
[37:39] Hallelujah eat up the crop in his baby
[37:42] stage they are ran away Hallelujah and
[37:45] God has done the same thing for you and
[37:47] I in our baby stage God Jesus Christ the
[37:50] farmer was still there watching over the
[37:53] seed Hallelujah you know Church
[37:56] hallelujah what the farmer does he even
[37:59] watches the forecast Hallelujah and the
[38:02] forecast speaks of
[38:07] Prophecy he watches the forecast brother
[38:10] Jason and sometimes he look because he
[38:12] knows the season change and then what he
[38:15] does he he may watch the forecast and he
[38:17] speaks of a frost at night but that's
[38:20] not the season when the seed should come
[38:22] forth so what does that farmer do he
[38:24] goes out and he covers the
[38:27] Che
[38:28] Amen to keep it from coming forth out of
[38:37] season God is in
[38:40] control thank you just give him your
[38:44] faith he will take care everything else
[38:48] because what God has done God has put
[38:51] Hallelujah a Measure of Faith in each
[38:54] and every one of you but God
[38:57] back what he's given
[39:01] us okay now I love this
[39:05] illustration how the prophet said if you
[39:08] want a oak tree I give you Acorn if you
[39:11] got the acorn you got the oak tree
[39:13] potentially amen do you know that one
[39:16] Hallelujah that's not foreign to you is
[39:18] it what is he saying he's saying if you
[39:21] got the seed listen to me now I'm about
[39:23] to say something heavy Hallelujah don't
[39:25] let this go over your head now make let
[39:28] this be your Super Bowl
[39:31] tonight Hallelujah Glory listen
[39:35] hallelujah what does he do he knows that
[39:37] Hallelujah if he sew it Hallelujah if he
[39:40] planted Hallelujah that that life will
[39:44] come out at a prospective
[39:47] time H he's not worthy about the storm
[39:52] Hallelujah he's not even worried about
[39:54] the
[39:55] darkness
[39:57] W oh my church and as is planted the
[40:01] prophet of God said he said about that
[40:03] seed he said everything in that seed
[40:07] everything that it ever need every
[40:10] bushel Hallelujah even the color of it
[40:13] every characteristic is in it at that
[40:18] stage already what are you saying
[40:20] brother JS the faith you need for every
[40:24] trial the faith you need for every
[40:27] situation the faith you need for every
[40:29] struggle for every bill for every
[40:32] sickness for every tribulation is in you
[40:35] right now
[40:39] amen hallelujah the prophet said we live
[40:43] below our means let's stop going to God
[40:48] rehearsing things that he cannot
[40:53] do we go to God we say Lord
[40:57] increase my face how can
[41:00] he the prophet of God say he's already
[41:03] done
[41:03] it everything that you need has already
[41:06] been done so what are you saying brother
[41:09] de you need to find or catch your moment
[41:13] of
[41:14] inspiration because when you catch your
[41:16] moment of inspiration by faith whatever
[41:19] you need will come forth Hallelujah and
[41:22] that's what that that's what that farmer
[41:24] does hallelujah he knows as he watches
[41:27] it and sometimes he watches it from a
[41:29] far off but he's still watching it
[41:32] Hallelujah and he
[41:34] Hallelujah most Farmers they plant
[41:37] things that they've already planted
[41:39] before so let me say it like this what
[41:42] you going through Hallelujah is nothing
[41:44] new to
[41:46] God somebody's already gone through it
[41:49] and you know what they brought forth
[41:53] fruit Hallelujah so shall we amen
[41:57] somebody's already went through
[41:58] Hallelujah my financial struggles
[42:01] Hallelujah and they are still here
[42:03] bringing forth fruit Hallelujah so if I
[42:05] got the same life in me Hallelujah I
[42:08] should be able to bring forth
[42:12] fruit
[42:14] Hallelujah I ain't going to be long
[42:15] don't get
[42:17] nervous but as we look in the scripture
[42:20] and we think about perfect Faith you
[42:23] know that Faith Hallelujah
[42:27] faith is a
[42:28] realm
[42:30] Hallelujah that a real believer can live
[42:33] in
[42:35] right you know the prophet he would he
[42:38] would come up he stand behind the pull
[42:41] pit and they have he have people out
[42:43] there and everything else and he makes
[42:45] statements like this you know what I'm
[42:47] waiting
[42:49] on you know
[42:52] who what was he
[42:55] doing we are we
[42:58] onise God I lost AIT it to me I like the
[43:03] way it
[43:05] sound I ain't afraid of a little Echo
[43:09] hallelujah look what he would do he come
[43:12] out on the
[43:14] pit knowing full well Hallelujah who God
[43:18] Is Knowing full well and there are
[43:21] people there waiting on a
[43:24] vision Hallelujah
[43:26] and how they wait they be waiting by
[43:29] faith so he had to step into that same
[43:33] room of and P let God use him to pull
[43:37] out what the people
[43:39] need so you got operting faith but let's
[43:43] not forget the people were also
[43:46] operating in FA and for them to get a
[43:49] vision from theet we make the vision so
[43:52] great the
[43:55] vision for that person for the Propet
[43:58] the vision of that person that person
[44:01] had to be in the same
[44:05] real remember he I'm contac Spirit in
[44:09] order for him to contact the spirit they
[44:11] had to be in the
[44:15] same what about
[44:18] Christ in
[44:25] you
[44:28] moments of
[44:29] inspiration and stimulation all of those
[44:32] things work
[44:34] together let's look at it church this
[44:37] woman in the Bible who had a blood
[44:40] issue the Bible say she had an issue for
[44:43] 12
[44:44] years and she went to doctors Physicians
[44:46] and all these people and the Bible say
[44:49] she didn't get better but she got
[44:52] worse how did she get worse why did she
[44:54] get worse because she was
[44:57] concentrating and living in her five
[45:00] senses
[45:01] amen hallelujah and we know that the
[45:05] five senses are only to contact this
[45:09] world right amen but then there's
[45:11] another sense Hallelujah that can call
[45:14] things that are not as though they are
[45:18] and bring them right into your life all
[45:21] right whereever they are supposed to be
[45:23] now let me say this church if you Catch
[45:26] It you call it and you pull it that mean
[45:28] it was always
[45:31] yours you just had to catch the
[45:34] inspiration I knew was something going
[45:36] on praise God where we at am I own you
[45:42] know there was a there we go now we
[45:44] talking I knew something was going
[45:46] on there was a level of inspiration and
[45:50] trust that you got to have concerning
[45:53] spiritual things yeah Hallelujah
[45:56] first of all we put all our hope and
[45:59] trust in who
[46:01] God Amen but before I finish with this
[46:03] woman before I finish with her let's
[46:07] let's let's back up a little bit now say
[46:09] that she had a blood issue for 12 years
[46:11] I want to I want to like my pastor say
[46:13] he'll throw a curve every now and then
[46:15] curve mean uh I the statement ain't GNA
[46:19] come right at you going boom but it's
[46:21] still going to hit
[46:22] you normally he he say I'm throwing a
[46:24] curve when he rebuking people
[46:26] people
[46:28] H but
[46:30] listen it took her 12
[46:32] years just to even get into the place
[46:36] where she would now acknowledge I need
[46:41] Christ and how often we run to this
[46:44] person we run to that person we go get
[46:47] two jobs and three jobs and and all
[46:49] these other things instead of taking it
[46:52] to
[46:54] Christ all of our hope all of our trust
[46:58] and faith should be in him Hallelujah
[47:00] but what happens is brother Chris we're
[47:02] too busy living in our five
[47:06] senses and and the prophet of God said
[47:09] once the senses can declare it it's no
[47:12] longer
[47:18] Faith once you say if I do this I do
[47:21] that everything going to be all right
[47:22] that's no longer
[47:24] faith
[47:28] normally Faith takes over things you
[47:32] cannot control
[47:35] amen
[47:36] hallelujah but
[47:38] church he come to curve it took her 12
[47:43] years just to even acknowledge God and
[47:47] the prophet of God say 12 is the name of
[47:50] what

[49:32] ceiling because of how he's been to me
[49:36] because of what he's done for me
[49:37] Hallelujah my praise Hallelujah might
[49:40] cause me to run around the church
[49:42] Hallelujah because he's Hallelujah I
[49:44] look back over my life and I can see the
[49:47] things that he's destroyed I look back
[49:49] over my life and I can see the things
[49:51] that he's delivered me from Hallelujah

[50:23] we need to put the devil on the Run
[50:25] y'all need to know there's a rumor a
[50:28] rumor is all through the message going
[50:29] around is then the rumor is white folks
[50:31] don't
[50:42] shout is that rumor
[50:45] true Hallelujah they say they you know
[50:49] the prophet of God he said the the
[50:52] farther you go up north the quieter it
[50:54] get we in the South we down here in
[50:58] Buford Hallelujah where the mosquitoes

[51:54] praise because of somebody else doesn't
[51:57] have the same
[52:01] inspiration Hallelujah yeah I know what
[52:04] some of y'all G to do y'all GNA look at
[52:06] brother Jason and see what his response
[52:07] is to what I'm
[52:09] saying well let me tell you right now I
[52:11] didn't seen him shout hallelujah
[52:14] hallelujah I remember one time he came
[52:15] to our church I told Brother Jason I
[52:17] said brother Jason it's going to be good
[52:18] now watch what I tell you he got up in
[52:20] the pull pit he started the preaching
[52:22] and he stopped and he looked at me he
[52:23] said brother digs you all right
[52:25] right and all I saw the rest of the
[52:28] service was you going
[52:33] to
[52:35] Hallelujah where is that church that can
[52:38] catch their moments of inspiration where
[52:41] the chains of of sin and shame will be
[52:44] broken because yourself is a revelation
[52:48] not an
[52:49] emotion Hallelujah see that's what we've
[52:52] done we've mistaken Revelation for
[52:54] emotion
[52:56] no I shout because God has revealed
[52:58] himself to
[53:00] me and if it makes me feel good in the
[53:03] process that's a
[53:07] plus oh my let me move on I believe you
[53:12] caught that
[53:13] one but what we do we get in
[53:16] ruts and we let our five senses take
[53:21] control of things that shouldn't belong
[53:23] to our
[53:24] senses
[53:26] Hallelujah your five senses shouldn't
[53:28] control your
[53:32] worship your faith in Christ should the
[53:36] inspiration of who God is should control
[53:38] that the stimulation oh oh here we go
[53:42] here we go listen this
[53:46] woman she had a blood issue and the
[53:48] issue was getting worse and worse but
[53:51] then one day the Bible says look the
[53:53] scripture where I started with
[53:56] one of the servants was sick and Jesus
[53:58] the Bible saying Jesus went with him
[54:00] Hallelujah see Jesus wasn't even coming
[54:03] to
[54:05] her
[54:07] Hallelujah he wasn't what he wasn't even
[54:09] coming to her but the scripture says she
[54:14] heard Faith come by what hearing hearing
[54:18] what the word of God now we just was
[54:21] talking back in the office and he said
[54:25] he's been pastoring here probably 30
[54:28] years 30 years of what preaching the
[54:31] word in this church Hallelujah preaching
[54:35] the message of the hour the unle bread
[54:38] Hallelujah thus say the Lord the alpha
[54:41] the Omega Hallelujah Jehovah Gyra
[54:44] Jehovah Rafa every revelation of Jesus
[54:47] Christ has been preached oh yeah I
[54:50] shouldn't say every but what's been
[54:52] revealed to him Hallelujah has been
[54:55] preach yes sir so Faith come by
[54:59] what 30 years of you
[55:03] hearing
[55:06] Hallelujah when you come here what do
[55:08] you
[55:13] hear so if you come here and you hear
[55:16] the word notice catch this
[55:19] now H he's not preaching the ministers
[55:24] that come in and preach they're not
[55:26] preaching a word in
[55:30] part it's not a Baptist Doctrine it's
[55:33] not a a Catholic Doctrine it's not a
[55:36] presbyterian Doctrine but it's a
[55:38] prophetic perfect revelation of Jesus
[55:42] Christ being preached to you Hallelujah
[55:44] so if faith comes by hearing and you're
[55:46] hearing the perfect Gospel of Jesus
[55:49] Christ what should that be producing in
[55:51] this
[55:53] church amen if you're hearing a perfect
[55:56] word it should be bringing forth perfect
[55:59] Faith cuz Faith come by hearing hearing
[56:02] what the word of
[56:05] God
[56:08] God oh my
[56:11] Hallelujah Faith come by hearing hearing
[56:15] the word of God but what happens when
[56:19] you hear it and inspiration catches it
[56:24] Hallelujah
[56:26] notice she said let me let me let me
[56:28] read something to you right
[56:30] quick oh
[56:32] my the prophet of God say we want to
[56:34] talk about inspiration for a second
[56:37] moments of inspiration Hallelujah and we

[56:43] inspiration Hallelujah I'll make it real
[56:46] plain to you most of

[56:52] wife and something came to you one day
[56:55] and you said I'm going to marry that
[56:59] woman now you can take that to be the
[57:04] devil or you can take that to be God
[57:06] according to where you are right now
[57:08] Hallelujah and even if it's a struggle
[57:11] it can still be an inspiration giv of
[57:14] God hallelujah and you know Church you
[57:18] think we operate inspiration is always
[57:21] there but how are we hearing amen listen
[57:24] L Hallelujah the prophet of God say he
[57:27] said that's what the Sho ofite woman was
[57:30] going by it was unreasonable to take the
[57:34] dead baby to the preacher bed Hallelujah
[57:37] he said but inspiration spoke and it
[57:41] inspiration speak to you and say to you
[57:44] you've been playing church if
[57:46] inspiration tells you tonight it's time
[57:49] to get rid of your dirty habits listen
[57:51] to inspiration it's the Holy Spirit
[57:54] speaking and making a way Hallelujah he
[57:57] says so when inspiration come
[57:59] inspiration comes to make a
[58:01] way Hallelujah he said no matter what
[58:04] the people think what others say it's
[58:06] the inspiration leading you if it's
[58:09] according to the word and it's according
[58:12] to the word then the inspiration is
[58:14] leading you oh my listen he says now the
[58:19] English word Prophet just means preacher
[58:22] see anybody every preacher is a prophet
[58:26] cuz he is for telling something
[58:28] preaching the word under inspiration is
[58:30] called a
[58:36] prophet he said why are you saying that
[58:39] cuz we believe brother brenon was a
[58:41] prophet and you know a lot of times he
[58:43] will come out he say hey this is nothing
[58:47] premeditated we're just going to get
[58:49] behind the pull pit find something and
[58:51] preach it so as he's preaching it and

[58:57] preaching he's in a realm of
[59:00] Faith H and when we catch it hallelujah
[59:05] hallelujah let me let let me let me let
[59:07] me let me go into this listen remember
[59:10] Jesus was standing in front of his
[59:12] disciples and he says who do men say
[59:15] that I am hallu and somebody say some
[59:19] say you you're John the Baptist some say
[59:21] you're Liars some say you do some say
[59:23] your dad or one of the
[59:25] and then he says who do you say I
[59:28] am he wanted to see if he was really
[59:33] revealed to them if they really
[59:36] understood Hallelujah who they were
[59:38] hearing from Hallelujah and then Peter
[59:40] says listen Peter says Thou Art the
[59:43] Christ the son of the Living God and
[59:46] listen to Christ response he says Peter
[59:49] Flesh and Blood have not revealed this
[59:50] to you he said but my Father which is in
[59:53] heaven and the prophet of God said faith
[59:55] is what a
[1:00:00] revelation that's what we need to live
[1:00:03] we need to live our Revelation that's
[1:00:06] what we're doing now Hallelujah by the
[1:00:08] grace of God we're living our Revelation

[1:00:24] tended into her need right
[1:00:27] amen if I could say it like this he had
[1:00:30] no intentions on dealing with her that
[1:00:33] day but she
[1:00:36] heard that Christ was coming that way
[1:00:39] Hallelujah faith comes by hearing
[1:00:41] hearing the word of God and then
[1:00:43] something inside of her said if you
[1:00:46] could just touch amen the H of His
[1:00:49] Garment now notice she didn't have a
[1:00:52] scripture she didn't have a quot she
[1:00:55] didn't have a friend or a pastor by
[1:00:57] somebody beside her that will push her
[1:01:00] into that it was solely what
[1:01:05] inspiration it was a moment of
[1:01:07] inspiration where God would change her
[1:01:10] life
[1:01:12] forever that's what a moment of
[1:01:14] inspiration can do Hallelujah and notice
[1:01:19] from that
[1:01:21] point something moved on her to say if
[1:01:24] you could just touch the him of His
[1:01:25] Garment you'll be made whole Hallelujah
[1:01:28] and nobody else around could hear what
[1:01:32] God was saying to

[1:09:11] Amen that mean he can hear me Hallelujah
[1:09:14] I know some of y'all hear me but you
[1:09:15] don't respond
[1:09:22] you
[1:09:24] it's just as
[1:09:25] real now these things I'm talking about
[1:09:28] you've already done
[1:09:30] it you drove here in the automobile
[1:09:33] somebody say amen amen hallelujah you
[1:09:36] came and set in
[1:09:38] church and now you're hearing my voice
[1:09:42] Hallelujah can the devil take any of
[1:09:44] that away from you no you really did it
[1:09:48] it's not an imagination it's happening
[1:09:50] to me right
[1:09:52] now
[1:09:57] we are partakers of it right
[1:10:00] now oh my we say oh God increase it oh
[1:10:03] God give me more faith you are partakers
[1:10:06] of it right
[1:10:10] now Oh my he said it's a substance not
[1:10:15] an imagination not an emotion but
[1:10:17] something that you have and it comes to
[1:10:19] you by hearing the word of God
[1:10:22] hallelujah and that only now what are
[1:10:25] you
[1:10:26] hearing the word of
[1:10:29] God so if I'm preaching a
[1:10:34] word and you drove here in
[1:10:37] automobile and now you're sitting in
[1:10:40] church and then you heard my voice
[1:10:43] Hallelujah and the senses declaring that
[1:10:46] is light and all these other things that
[1:10:48] we can say are
[1:10:50] trueu if you are possessors of all these
[1:10:53] other things I've just said hallelujah
[1:10:55] what are you saying brother digs
[1:10:57] somebody say I have
[1:11:04] it not Lord increase it no I have
[1:11:08] it now Lord give me more no I have it
[1:11:13] because if I can declare Hallelujah that
[1:11:15] I've gone through the motions of an
[1:11:16] automobile go through the motions of a
[1:11:18] church go through the motions of hearing
[1:11:20] the voice go through the motions of
[1:11:22] seeing light the motion of Faith should
[1:11:24] be in the
[1:11:26] building Hallelujah for you to get in
[1:11:29] the automobile and drive takes what
[1:11:34] faith oh
[1:11:36] my for you to sit in church and hear the
[1:11:39] word takes what
[1:11:41] faith for you to acknowledge all the
[1:11:44] other things that can be declared takes
[1:11:46] what
[1:11:47] faith so perfect
[1:11:50] faith is among you amen
[1:11:54] amen thing of it is will you allow it to
[1:12:02] operate because clearly if I just use
[1:12:04] what the prophet said it's clear that we
[1:12:06] have
[1:12:08] it I go back I touched the coat it's not
[1:12:12] an imagination I really did it he said
[1:12:14] it's just as real as me touching the
[1:12:17] coat Hallelujah I did it it's not an
[1:12:20] imagination so I Hallelujah I went
[1:12:22] through that Hallelujah I'm in that
[1:12:26] realm oh
[1:12:28] my sew and
[1:12:30] reap and when the inspiration hit what
[1:12:33] happens why do we preach because what
[1:12:37] preaching does Hallelujah the word
[1:12:41] stimulates your
[1:12:43] faith so it's the hearing of the Gospel
[1:12:46] that arouses your faith it's the hearing
[1:12:49] of the Gospel that says amen it's the
[1:12:52] hearing of the gospel that says I
[1:12:54] believe I can do that listen it's not
[1:12:58] your flesh Amen in the
[1:13:02] Worden amen it's your
[1:13:07] theophany
[1:13:09] hallelujah it's your word body
[1:13:12] Hallelujah amening the word it's your
[1:13:16] heavenly representation Amen in the word
[1:13:20] because your flesh is not connected to
[1:13:22] the word what your word body
[1:13:26] is oh my
[1:13:31] listen
[1:13:34] stimulate stimulate means to
[1:13:38] excite to activate amen so what happens
[1:13:42] faith comes by hearing hearing the word
[1:13:44] of God so when the word is being preach
[1:13:48] that word is there to stimulate your
[1:13:51] faith that word is is being preached to
[1:13:54] get a reaction out of the
[1:13:56] seed Hallelujah because it takes
[1:13:59] hallelujah how do you get a reaction out
[1:14:01] of the natural seed it has to come in
[1:14:03] contact with the Su
[1:14:06] n Hallelujah and What Does the Farmer do
[1:14:10] the farmer has to trust by faith that
[1:14:13] the son will do his part because he
[1:14:16] can't control the Sun so he has to trust
[1:14:18] it by faith that as the sun shines that
[1:14:21] seed will get everything it needs
[1:14:24] Hallelujah so when brother Jason preach
[1:14:27] and brother Matt preach and the
[1:14:28] different brothers that here preach
[1:14:29] Hallelujah they have the trust that the
[1:14:32] s o
[1:14:34] n will do his
[1:14:37] part
[1:14:40] Hallelujah
[1:14:42] now before I
[1:14:44] close by the grace of
[1:14:47] God as we look at sewing and giving it
[1:14:50] back in moments of inspiration there are
[1:14:52] moments of inspiration All Through the
[1:14:55] Bible
[1:14:57] Hallelujah Abraham had moments of
[1:15:00] inspiration where it really didn't seem
[1:15:02] like it makes sense he said you know
[1:15:05] what I got 318 or 16 servants they know
[1:15:09] how to cook real good but today we gonna
[1:15:11] go
[1:15:12] fight today we going to go take back one
[1:15:16] of our brothers and we going to whoop up
[1:15:18] on the
[1:15:20] Army what was that that was a moment of
[1:15:22] inspir
[1:15:24] ation that's why he was called the
[1:15:26] father of Faith Hallelujah and listen
[1:15:28] one thing I know about God what God has
[1:15:31] done he's even done this to me God will
[1:15:34] speak a word in your life knowing you
[1:15:36] don't believe it
[1:15:39] yet oh he'll speak a word in his church
[1:15:43] knowing that you don't see it yet am but
[1:15:46] he allow you to hear it knowing you can
[1:15:48] come up to it Hallelujah you said what
[1:15:52] are you talking about he told Abraham
[1:15:54] you're gonna have a son knowing Abraham
[1:15:57] didn't believe
[1:15:59] it but what happened Abraham had to
[1:16:02] catch the inspiration of what was spoken
[1:16:04] into his life and once he caught the
[1:16:06] inspiration of Faith he caught the
[1:16:09] evidence of it which was
[1:16:11] Isaac and that's what God wants us to do
[1:16:14] as you're hearing the word of God catch
[1:16:16] the inspiration behind it cuz there's
[1:16:19] some way God is trying to
[1:16:22] reveal
[1:16:23] amen oh
[1:16:26] my he'll speak things knowing we don't
[1:16:29] believe it or we'll speak things knowing
[1:16:32] we don't believe it and then God will
[1:16:35] make sure we see what we're what we're
[1:16:37] wanting to
[1:16:39] see so what you talking about the
[1:16:42] prophet asked for squirrels and didn't
[1:16:44] believe
[1:16:47] it h and none of us will probably ever
[1:16:51] produce squirrels
[1:16:54] That Ain't My Testimony I I don't hunt I
[1:16:55] don't need no squirrel I want some
[1:16:56] squirrel I go to Tony
[1:17:00] house let him do the hunting I'll be
[1:17:02] there to eat
[1:17:06] Hallelujah really I want some deer hint
[1:17:14] hint but you cannot be what God doesn't
[1:17:17] want you to
[1:17:19] be and look at what the Lord will do
[1:17:21] he'll put you in a situation where the
[1:17:23] Revelation inside of you can get
[1:17:25] quickened Hallelujah and that moment of
[1:17:28] inspiration will come out Hallelujah
[1:17:31] against all ODS Hallelujah listen Joshua
[1:17:34] didn't wake up that morning saying I'm
[1:17:36] going to stop the
[1:17:38] sun oh right he was just living his life
[1:17:43] living his best life serving the lord he
[1:17:47] didn't know in his path that day God had
[1:17:50] a moment of inspiration that would
[1:17:52] change him his life and everybody else
[1:17:54] in his
[1:17:57] church Hallelujah listen he caught the
[1:18:00] inspiration see listen when you cast
[1:18:03] inspiration it'll make you speak things
[1:18:06] that seem unreasonable all
[1:18:08] right son stand still why could he do
[1:18:11] that because God told him be of a good
[1:18:14] courage nothing to be able to stand
[1:18:16] before you see what was it he was living
[1:18:19] by the word that was revealed to him
[1:18:24] yeah that's why he could catch the
[1:18:27] inspiration because he was living by the
[1:18:29] word that was revealed to him there were
[1:18:31] many other people Jacob caught
[1:18:34] inspiration to have his name changed
[1:18:36] from a Shyer to a
[1:18:39] prince Esther caught inspiration Ruth
[1:18:43] caught inspiration on and on people had
[1:18:45] moments of inspiration in their life
[1:18:48] that changed them forever David had
[1:18:51] inspiration he he didn't plan to fight a
[1:18:54] lion he didn't plan to fight a bear but
[1:18:57] that was a moment of inspiration that
[1:18:59] God would use for a bigger
[1:19:06] problem
[1:19:10] okay before we get out of
[1:19:14] here back to this
[1:19:21] woman so
[1:19:23] Faith reap
[1:19:27] evidence
[1:19:29] now bres what do you mean by so
[1:19:34] Faith this
[1:19:38] woman if I can find it right
[1:19:41] quick this woman in her
[1:19:43] mind she
[1:19:45] said if I could just touch the him of
[1:19:48] His Garment I'll be made whole
[1:19:51] amen
[1:19:53] now that was pretty much unheard
[1:19:56] of cuz was no
[1:19:58] virtue in the
[1:20:01] clothing The Virtue was in the
[1:20:06] Revelation Hallelujah The Virtue was in
[1:20:10] her knowing who he was Hallelujah and
[1:20:13] not only Hallelujah him knowing who he
[1:20:17] was but her knowing that she had the
[1:20:19] ability to do it amen that's the part
[1:20:23] Hallelujah
[1:20:26] that only did did she say in her mind
[1:20:29] she caught the inspiration that if you
[1:20:32] touch it Hallelujah you'll be made whole
[1:20:34] but she had to have the faith to go
[1:20:36] through
[1:20:38] it Hallelujah and sometimes we'll say I
[1:20:41] believe with the prophet said I believe
[1:20:42] this I believe that and never go through
[1:20:45] it
[1:20:46] on what good is you say you believe it
[1:20:49] and never put it into action but this
[1:20:52] woman said if I could just touch the him
[1:20:54] of His Garment I'll be made whole and
[1:20:56] Jesus was walking by doing whatever he
[1:20:58] was doing and she start aor people and

[1:21:18] immediately just as real as an
[1:21:21] automobile amen
[1:21:25] just as real as you sitting in
[1:21:27] church just as real as you hearing my
[1:21:30] voice just as real as be touching the
[1:21:32] coater touching the sweater just as real
[1:21:35] Hallelujah as that woman
[1:21:39] saying let me ask you something
[1:21:42] amen what's the difference from her
[1:21:44] touching the coat of Jesus and me
[1:21:47] touching hip
[1:21:49] coat if I got a need and I do it by
[1:21:52] revelation
[1:21:55] hallelujah it's whether you believe it
[1:21:57] or not
[1:22:00] hallelujah oh my
[1:22:02] listen so Faith reap evidence listen I'm
[1:22:06] about I'm about to uh by the grace of
[1:22:08] God what time is oh my
[1:22:11] listen let's talk about this woman for a
[1:22:15] second this wasn't just some ordinary
[1:22:20] day the prophet of God the prophet of
[1:22:22] God say
[1:22:23] Amen every obstacle from human beings
[1:22:27] that they might be connected like the
[1:22:29] Garden of Eden now man I was going to
[1:22:32] choke it but I'm going to say it man is
[1:22:40] omnipotent you know what that
[1:22:42] means it's been preached here several
[1:22:45] times H what I'm saying has already been
[1:22:48] preached to
[1:22:50] you Hallelujah man is omnipotent
[1:22:54] omnipotent means all powerful right amen
[1:22:58] he said a man fully surrendered to God
[1:23:02] is
[1:23:03] omnipotent now I wonder how many of us
[1:23:06] in this church are fully surrendered to
[1:23:10] God if you are fully surrender to God
[1:23:13] God can't help but answer your
[1:23:16] prayers because it's omnipotent
[1:23:19] speaking and the reason why we don't see
[1:23:22] return on our sewing is because we are
[1:23:26] not sowing the right
[1:23:28] thing am you can't s 50-50 God and 50-50
[1:23:35] unbelief Hallelujah we don't plant a
[1:23:38] apple orang
[1:23:41] seed you remember he said it ain't a
[1:23:43] white black bird ain't a dog cat or
[1:23:45] whatever he
[1:23:46] say listen he said you don't believe
[1:23:49] that he is a man fully surrender to of
[1:23:52] God is omnipotent did not he say in Mark
[1:23:55] 11:23 whatsoever things you say and
[1:23:58] don't doubt in your heart it'll come to
[1:24:01] pass you can have what you said what
[1:24:05] happens when two omnipotence meet when
[1:24:07] God and man comes together two
[1:24:10] omnipotence something's got to
[1:24:13] [Music]
[1:24:15] shake I tell you what
[1:24:18] happens there go Jesus walking down it's
[1:24:22] ation comes and says if I could just
[1:24:24] touch the him of His Garment I'll be
[1:24:25] made
[1:24:28] whole remember I said two
[1:24:31] omnipotence now we know God is one
[1:24:33] omnipotent where was the other
[1:24:35] omnipotent that woman with the
[1:24:41] blood wow God put her in position where
[1:24:44] her faith her real Faith could come out
[1:24:47] in that moment H she was always
[1:24:51] omnipotent right but it took that moment
[1:24:55] for her to see who she really was Oh my
[1:24:59] he says whatsoever you said Hallelujah
[1:25:02] the creative power omnipotence of God
[1:25:04] knowing that the pro that he promised it
[1:25:06] and he said in his word is creative
[1:25:09] power that goes out yonder and brings
[1:25:11] things to pass amen creative power is in
[1:25:15] you tonight oh the devil thought I was
[1:25:18] going to choke it no creative power is
[1:25:21] in Beth Tabernacle tonight am
[1:25:25] amen I'm going to read something to you
[1:25:27] most of you probably never heard or you
[1:25:30] never could see yourself
[1:25:32] as but in a moment of inspiration this
[1:25:35] is who you
[1:25:37] are if you're sewing Faith to
[1:25:41] God perfect Faith to God all you can do
[1:25:45] is reap the evidence of that
[1:25:49] faith and that's what she was doing she
[1:25:52] was sowing perfect Faith to God so she
[1:25:56] had to be
[1:25:57] healed what are we sowing church
[1:26:02] amen but it all happened in a moment of
[1:26:06] inspiration oh my I know some of you
[1:26:09] tired and sleepy so I'm about to I'm
[1:26:10] about to I'm about to close it down I
[1:26:12] know them words got power I'm about to
[1:26:15] close listen this blew me away when I
[1:26:18] read this he said that's when two
[1:26:20] positives meet see that's when two
[1:26:23] omnipotent me see when one omnipotent
[1:26:26] she had the prophet of God already put
[1:26:28] her there omnipotent he said one
[1:26:30] omnipotence she had she was all powerful
[1:26:33] but listen he going to take it a step
[1:26:35] further she had perfect omnipotent faith
[1:26:38] in Christ amen where are we
[1:26:42] Church all this word we've been hearing
[1:26:45] 30 plus
[1:26:48] years our church to my pastor been
[1:26:51] preaching 30 40 years is same thing
[1:26:54] listen she had perfect omnipotent faith
[1:26:57] in Christ and Christ was omnipotent see
[1:27:01] she oh my the prophet of God says she
[1:27:05] had perfect infinite Faith
[1:27:13] amen see the reason why that doesn't get
[1:27:17] a response out of some of you is because
[1:27:19] you don't see yourself like that right
[1:27:25] amen the word
[1:27:27] infinite normally only speaks of
[1:27:32] Christ because we are
[1:27:35] finite but then the prophet comes and
[1:27:37] says she had perfect infinite Faith so
[1:27:40] what kind of Faith did she had she had
[1:27:42] the same faith God
[1:27:45] has in that moment she could have
[1:27:48] created a world
[1:27:51] Hallelujah
[1:27:52] she had perfect infinite faith in her
[1:27:55] moment of
[1:27:57] inspiration just like Joshua stopped the
[1:27:59] son what was that perfect infinite
[1:28:04] Faith just like David standing before go
[1:28:08] saying I'm going to cut your head off
[1:28:10] without a
[1:28:13] sword what was it it was perfect
[1:28:16] omnipotent faith and when two
[1:28:18] omnipotence meet the miraculous has to
[1:28:21] take place
[1:28:23] thank you Lord and when you find your
[1:28:25] place in Christ and your moment of
[1:28:27] inspiration the same thing will
[1:28:32] happen come musicians I'm
[1:28:37] closing she had perfect infinite faith
[1:28:41] in Christ that he was Lord and know
[1:28:45] whatever he asked God God would give it
[1:28:47] to him in other words she said you just
[1:28:51] speak the word that's all you have to do
[1:28:54] whatsoever you ask God God will give it
[1:28:57] you amen church it's time for us to
[1:29:01] believe what we
[1:29:04] read in this
[1:29:06] message perfect Faith the prophet of God
[1:29:10] says it's time for
[1:29:12] us to preach it a little
[1:29:16] deeper and get some of us make belief
[1:29:19] out the
[1:29:20] church
[1:29:24] Hallelujah let's get some of them make
[1:29:27] belief out the
[1:29:28] church say brother de what are you
[1:29:30] saying if you got a problem you got a
[1:29:32] need tonight stop wrestling with it
[1:29:35] right amen give it to God say Lord I
[1:29:39] believe that you can take care of
[1:29:41] this give it to the Lord sow Faith back
[1:29:45] to him and reap the evidence of it
[1:29:48] Hallelujah I guarantee you you're going
[1:29:50] to reap what you s Hallelujah just like
[1:29:53] this woman did she sold unto Christ she
[1:29:57] gave him the faith back Hallelujah and
[1:29:59] then she received the evidence of it by
[1:30:01] what having healing in her body
[1:30:05] am
[1:30:07] oh but that was a moment of
[1:30:13] inspiration in a moment of inspiration
[1:30:16] in a real of Faith
[1:30:19] Hallelujah and that happens all the time
[1:30:22] yes amen why doesn't it happen more
[1:30:25] often because we try to do things on our
[1:30:28] own we want to put it in our five senses
[1:30:31] and control it no let's give it to
[1:30:34] God let's say the prophet of God says he
[1:30:37] says what happened with Joshua he said
[1:30:39] Joshua was standing there looking at the
[1:30:41] son and then Joshua begin to realize who
[1:30:44] he
[1:30:46] was W he begin to realize who he was he
[1:30:50] begin to realize what what God spoke
[1:30:52] over him and then he be to move
[1:30:55] according to the Revelation the prophet
[1:30:57] of God say he was saying hallelujah in
[1:30:59] that moment I'm a son and I got a need
[1:31:02] son stand still he said what would it be
[1:31:06] tonight if everybody in this church
[1:31:08] would come Hallelujah approach God
[1:31:10] knowing who they
[1:31:15] are nothing would be able to stand in
[1:31:17] the
[1:31:19] place that's why the whole
[1:31:23] just of the prophet's message was get
[1:31:26] the people to
[1:31:27] believe amen and nothing will be able to
[1:31:30] stand before
[1:31:31] you Church there are more moments of
[1:31:34] inspiration in our
[1:31:35] lives I'm sure all everybody in this
[1:31:38] room can think of something that
[1:31:39] happened in your life where it was
[1:31:42] like amen you knew God did it amen why
[1:31:46] can't that happen all the
[1:31:49] [Music]
[1:31:50] time
[1:31:52] the prophet said Jesus defeated the
[1:31:54] devil simply by knowing who he
[1:31:57] was what about you what about us right
[1:32:02] we'll defeat the enemy the same way
[1:32:05] simply by knowing who you are let's
[1:32:08] catch the moment of inspiration the
[1:32:10] prophets Hallelujah he's in an airplane
[1:32:13] flying Hallelujah and as he's flying
[1:32:16] he's he's he's he has to
[1:32:20] fly and
[1:32:22] she's tapping into real Faith she's
[1:32:25] tapping into a moment of inspiration not
[1:32:27] only for her but for her family
[1:32:29] Hallelujah she's tapping into it how
[1:32:31] does she tap into it strictly by knowing
[1:32:34] who she is she says hallelujah in the
[1:32:36] moment of inspiration I'm just like the
[1:32:42] shite now where's my
[1:32:45] Elijah and in that moment who was
[1:32:48] speaking it was God
[1:32:50] speaking
[1:32:52] because everything that could make what
[1:32:54] she said happen start to happen the
[1:32:56] plane which had no ears came
[1:33:02] down why because the gift Hallelujah to
[1:33:06] confirm her prayer was on that
[1:33:09] plane moment of inspiration brought
[1:33:12] everything she needed for that
[1:33:17] time what about
[1:33:20] you that moment of
[1:33:23] inspiration and what I love about it the
[1:33:27] prophet was caught up in her
[1:33:33] moment and he couldn't do nothing about
[1:33:36] it but
[1:33:37] surrender
[1:33:39] Oh Oh my he could do nothing about it
[1:33:42] but
[1:33:45] surrender because she knew who she was
[1:33:48] she said I'm just like to shoot M now
[1:33:50] where's my Elijah Elijah's on the plane
[1:33:51] Elijah came down Hallelujah son may
[1:33:53] whole everything amen but that's bride's
[1:33:59] food these things are told for
[1:34:03] us to encourage us that we could also
[1:34:08] sow Faith that's what she did she sold
[1:34:11] faith and reaped the evidence of a son
[1:34:13] being made
[1:34:14] whole another moment of inspiration I'm
[1:34:17] trying to quit brother Jason a moment of
[1:34:19] inspiration Lazareth is
[1:34:22] dying they call for Jesus Jesus keeps
[1:34:26] walking but I've been I've been speaking
[1:34:28] on this last last year we have to check
[1:34:32] our
[1:34:33] [Music]
[1:34:35] attitude because sometimes Jesus won't
[1:34:38] come but he'll give you a hint to what's
[1:34:40] going to
[1:34:42] happen you might come to church and hear
[1:34:45] the word and the word is telling you
[1:34:47] what's going to happen even though
[1:34:49] Christ didn't do it right there he told
[1:34:52] Hallelujah they say Lazarus to dying he
[1:34:54] said hey this is for the glory of
[1:34:58] God
[1:35:00] hallelujah then they sit for him and all
[1:35:03] these other things keeps happen he goes
[1:35:05] back and he says hey it was good for you
[1:35:07] that I wasn't
[1:35:09] he see he's trying to get them to see
[1:35:12] something's about to take place but it's
[1:35:15] not going to happen the way you think
[1:35:16] it's going to
[1:35:18] happen that's how inspiration moves
[1:35:22] but if you tap in right Hallelujah you
[1:35:24] can make Jesus show
[1:35:27] himself Hallelujah and church right
[1:35:30] there Hallelujah Jesus amen he comes
[1:35:33] back and Martha Taps into the right
[1:35:38] inspiration she says Lord if you would
[1:35:41] have been here my brother wouldn't have
[1:35:43] died look at her attitude her attitude
[1:35:46] was I know anything is possible once you
[1:35:48] get here that was her attitude she was
[1:35:51] in in what the realm of Faith she was in
[1:35:53] a realm that was making Jesus
[1:35:58] everything and then she kept talking and
[1:36:01] Christ says hey your brother will live
[1:36:04] again and she cut inspiration brother
[1:36:07] Aon she says I know in the day of the
[1:36:09] Resurrection he'll Rise Again Jesus said
[1:36:12] what
[1:36:14] aming he had to respond H to her faith
[1:36:18] she sold it by word now God is going to
[1:36:21] give her the evidence the manifestation
[1:36:23] of it I am the
[1:36:25] [Music]
[1:36:29] resurrection where have you laid
[1:36:34] him oh my oh what what happens when you
[1:36:38] catch the right inspiration when you
[1:36:42] when you catch the right inspiration
[1:36:43] it'll show you things that hadn't even
[1:36:45] taken place
[1:36:46] yet but it's going to
[1:36:49] happen remember Cain and a I'm trying to
[1:36:51] quit Cain and Abel went to worship
[1:36:53] Hallelujah and and Cain he brought out
[1:36:56] flowers and all fruit and all these
[1:36:58] things but Abel caught a different
[1:37:00] Revelation and Abel grabbed the lamb
[1:37:03] brought the lamb over he started hacking
[1:37:05] the lamb up what was he doing look at
[1:37:07] the type the type was a lamb slain
[1:37:10] Hallelujah Jesus hadn't even been to the
[1:37:12] Cross yet but Abel caught the
[1:37:16] [Music]
[1:37:17] inspiration Hallelujah in his moment of
[1:37:21] of insiration he cut Christ on the cross

[1:42:31] partially and um then there was some
[1:42:34] still some motor issues but I asked her
[1:42:37] for an update and her mom is doing good
[1:42:40] her speech is now completely back to
[1:42:41] normal we've been praying amen they've
[1:42:44] been praying up there in North Carolina
[1:42:46] and um and she's still using um
[1:42:50] therapist to get her motor skills with
[1:42:54] walking going again Amen brother Kenny
[1:42:58] also brother
[1:43:00] Kino had a repeat injury uh injured his
[1:43:04] back um I know brother George had had um
[1:43:07] how's your dad is he okay so want to be
[1:43:11] praying for
[1:43:13] that amen and so I didn't have any other
[1:43:17] needs but I know perhaps especially with
[1:43:19] that kind of a sermon tonight you want
[1:43:21] to make a need known to the Lord tonight
[1:43:24] that was so powerful I I had so many
[1:43:27] things I want to say it's getting late
[1:43:29] but
[1:43:30] my you
[1:43:33] know I I just want to say this I want to
[1:43:35] say two things you got enough time to
[1:43:37] hear two
[1:43:38] [Music]
[1:43:41] things you know when brother brandham
[1:43:45] was there in perfect faith and he was he
[1:43:47] made a
[1:43:49] state realiz had set my thinking in a
[1:43:53] certain way for years since a young man
[1:43:58] since I heard that
[1:44:00] statement you know something brother
[1:44:01] Diggs this sermon tonight has completely
[1:44:06] revolutionize my thinking on this
[1:44:09] statement and he's talking about perfect
[1:44:11] faith and he says the reason he's
[1:44:13] bringing this is he says you've had a
[1:44:16] faith he said but now I'm trying to get
[1:44:18] you to perfect faith and the reason
[1:44:20] reason was he said you're going to need
[1:44:22] it down the road and you know something
[1:44:26] I thought about brother Dig's sermon
[1:44:28] tonight proving to us I would say that
[1:44:31] the servant of the Lord has proven
[1:44:33] Beyond doubt certainly no believer
[1:44:35] should be in doubt we have that which is
[1:44:38] perfect amen that perfect faith is here
[1:44:42] and all it takes is a dedicated life and
[1:44:44] and an acceptance of who you
[1:44:47] are amen amen cuz that's exactly what
[1:44:51] that that uh Memphis uh brother Bram
[1:44:54] said like an oldfashioned anima said she
[1:44:58] she caught and I never realized that as
[1:45:01] many times I heard that she identified
[1:45:04] herself in the Bible right she said Lord
[1:45:08] I'm just like that that shite woman but
[1:45:12] where's your Elijah I mean God had to
[1:45:15] reply to that there's no way somebody
[1:45:19] going to catch a Revelation that they're
[1:45:21] just like that person in the Bible yeah
[1:45:24] what's God going to do you know I I I
[1:45:27] remember when the angel said to Mary
[1:45:30] this is what's going to happen and and
[1:45:32] Mary Mary did the only thing that a real
[1:45:34] believer could do she said amen yeah be
[1:45:38] unto me and I I remember preaching one
[1:45:41] time and I said and when a Believer When
[1:45:43] God Says something a real believer can
[1:45:45] only say amen and when a real believer
[1:45:48] says Amen to the word the only thing God
[1:45:50] can do is bring it to
[1:45:52] pass amen oh my goodness and you know I
[1:45:57] thought about brother Bram saying you're
[1:45:59] going to need it down the road and in my
[1:46:02] mind I guess I've always thought you
[1:46:04] know we're going to come to this we're
[1:46:06] going to come to this someday we're
[1:46:06] going to come to this but you know I
[1:46:09] thought I was sitting there tonight I
[1:46:10] was making a note and I was thinking to
[1:46:12] myself you know there's nothing the
[1:46:14] devil would like more than to always
[1:46:18] keep you chasing a carrot on
[1:46:21] stick always just keep it out there in
[1:46:23] front of you
[1:46:25] someday if we're going to get the
[1:46:26] bride's going to get no friends forget
[1:46:28] it we have it right
[1:46:31] now amen right now that perfect faith is
[1:46:35] here yes but you you know what you know
[1:46:38] what the shunamite woman had to do she
[1:46:40] had to act on her faith now you ready to
[1:46:44] act on your faith now here here's the
[1:46:47] one where the devil knocks about 99 9.9%
[1:46:51] of us off the out of the saddle
[1:46:55] well yeah that that shunamite woman she
[1:46:58] was worthy that that Memphis sister she
[1:47:03] was living she must have been living a
[1:47:05] super life I don't know about me brother
[1:47:08] Brown
[1:47:09] says he says I'm fixing to pray for you
[1:47:12] now we're getting ready to pray so is
[1:47:14] this relevant he says I'm fixing to pray
[1:47:17] for you amen and he says I'm not worthy
[1:47:20] of that I think what would I do if Jesus
[1:47:23] was sitting here now and what would he
[1:47:26] do if he was sitting here he'd lay his
[1:47:29] hands upon you and with now catch it and
[1:47:32] with his great faith you'd get well come
[1:47:35] on now that's easy isn't it if he was
[1:47:38] sitting here if he was standing here
[1:47:40] with his great faith he'd lay his hands
[1:47:42] on you and you know you'd get
[1:47:44] well well I think well but I'm a sinner
[1:47:49] Prophet says
[1:47:51] I'm not I'm a sinner I'm not him but I
[1:47:55] come to represent him remember me being
[1:47:58] a sinner before God I'm not a sinner and
[1:48:03] neither are
[1:48:05] you we got a blood sacrifice laying
[1:48:08] there God don't even see us he hears our
[1:48:13] voice but he sees the blood of Christ
[1:48:15] that's it see he sees the blood of his
[1:48:18] own son it's our voice
[1:48:20] but Christ's blood then it's Christ
[1:48:23] that's talking through us to God so
[1:48:25] therefore we're not Sinners no more
[1:48:28] we're Christians amen amen amen so now I
[1:48:32] know who I am now there should be no now
[1:48:35] I know perfect faith is here I know he's
[1:48:38] here I know I'm a
[1:48:40] Believer Hallelujah so then what does
[1:48:43] hinder it friends I just say we ought to
[1:48:45] believe God don't chase a carrot on a
[1:48:48] stick let's take it right now yeah how
[1:48:51] many will agree yes sir you'll act on
[1:48:54] your faith you'll act on it and say
[1:48:56] tonight I believe it I'm accepting it
[1:49:00] and that's it I'm going out of here with
[1:49:02] what I have need
[1:49:04] of Amen praise the Lord take the hand of
[1:49:08] somebody near you put your arm on them
[1:49:11] decently and in
[1:49:13] [Music]
[1:49:14] order Lord God what a word we've heard
[1:49:18] tonight what a faith father I think of
[1:49:21] of brother Ken Lord with his back
[1:49:24] injured brother George with his back
[1:49:26] injured I think of sister Debbie
[1:49:27] holifield's mother you've already done
[1:49:29] such great things I think of sister Jean
[1:49:31] at home right now Lord recovering her
[1:49:33] strength Lord you've been so good to us

[1:49:45] that your servant brother Matt across
[1:49:48] the seas there with Rachel Lord and
[1:49:50] they're they've gone to carry the gospel
[1:49:52] I'm believing that you're going to meet
[1:49:54] every need Lord father for every sick
[1:49:57] person for all of these needs that have
[1:49:59] been written for every hand that went up
[1:50:01] Lord tonight we accept that you're here
[1:50:04] the word is here and we are your
[1:50:06] children and we have perfect Faith Lord
[1:50:09] in operation right now I'm praying for
[1:50:13] these needs Lord God and we have decided
[1:50:15] as a group of people we have decided to
[1:50:18] believe it Mary would say be it unto me
[1:50:22] according to Thy word Lord that's the
[1:50:25] only thing a Believer can say and when a
[1:50:27] Believer says that the only thing God
[1:50:29] can do at that point is keep his word so
[1:50:32] Lord we give it to you tonight with
[1:50:35] perfect faith in our heart every need
[1:50:37] Lord every hand that went up all the
[1:50:39] needs father of your people your
[1:50:41] children your family we are not Lord we
[1:50:44] we don't we don't always feel so
[1:50:47] Victorious but in the presence of God
[1:50:50] because of a blood sacrifice I stand
[1:50:53] perfect before God and now if I stand
[1:50:57] perfect and your word is perfect Lord
[1:50:59] and you're perfect and faith is perfect
[1:51:02] then what does hinder the word to come
[1:51:06] to pass in our lives Lord we've checked
[1:51:09] every box of perfection tonight the word
[1:51:13] the presence of Christ my life under the
[1:51:16] blood the faith that's here now Lord
[1:51:20] what what we're we're we're every
[1:51:23] element is perfect Lord we we've come to
[1:51:26] that which is perfect and there's no
[1:51:28] need to operate on a hope so or a maybe
[1:51:31] so or or a try to be so Lord it is so
[1:51:35] tonight so we commit it to you and we
[1:51:37] confess it and we believe it and we're

[1:51:48] whatever I need and I got a bunch of
[1:51:50] them they're everyone yay and amen

[1:56:06] evening so I've never struggled with any
[1:56:09] kind of skin condition before or
[1:56:10] anything but a couple months ago the
[1:56:12] devil tried to put eczema on me mhm and
[1:56:15] I was like I don't know how to treat
[1:56:17] this or anything I've never dealt with
[1:56:19] it so so I was kind of complaining about
[1:56:21] to M I was like I'm so insecure like
[1:56:23] it's I started getting out of my eyes
[1:56:24] right here and it was on my legs and I
[1:56:27] was like I don't know what to do with
[1:56:28] about it and he was like you don't have
[1:56:31] to to deal with that and I was like
[1:56:34] you're right I don't have to put up with
[1:56:35] this and I told the dad well you're
[1:56:38] trying to give me a skin condition and
[1:56:39] it's but it's not my skin condition
[1:56:41] right you know and so I started rebuking
[1:56:44] it and um it'd go away like within 5 to
[1:56:47] 10 minutes of me like rebuking this
[1:56:49] thing and he tried to give it back and
[1:56:52] so I was like you know you're trying to
[1:56:53] put this on God's Property wow and I'm
[1:56:56] like you're going to go in the Lake of
[1:56:57] Fire and this SK skin condition is going
[1:56:59] with you so don't forget that Hallelujah
[1:57:02] and I'm about to cry but I feel the
[1:57:06] presence of God but um so I went away
[1:57:10] for like a week and I was just talking
[1:57:13] to stepen Emily and with Micah and we
[1:57:15] were just talking about the word and I
[1:57:16] was testifying to them and the next day
[1:57:19] it comes back so bad on my hands and I
[1:57:21] was like in the name of Jesus I bind the
[1:57:24] spirit and I cast it into into hell and
[1:57:27] I haven't struggled with it since
[1:57:29] hallelujah
[1:57:30] [Music]
[1:57:37] hallelujah this is more of a praise
[1:57:39] report than a testimony um as everybody
[1:57:42] in here knows for years I've prayed for
[1:57:44] my children and I know I'll see the
[1:57:47] goodness of the Lord on this side
[1:57:50] them will you will but just the I can
[1:57:53] barely get through this just um I don't
[1:57:56] remember exactly what day it was but
[1:57:58] they were really heavy on my heart
[1:58:00] especially my oldest who has picked up a
[1:58:03] habit that's dangerous to her health and
[1:58:06] I was just
[1:58:08] so

[1:58:22] Lord that woman I'm just like that woman
[1:58:24] who came to you and said my daughter is
[1:58:26] grievously vexed by a devil yeah and I
[1:58:30] feel like this sermon tonight is the
[1:58:33] answer to the Lord was just saying this
[1:58:36] is what happened here's I'm giving you
[1:58:39] more faith to to grab a hold of that and
[1:58:42] I just know that she's going to be
[1:58:45] delivered amen amen
