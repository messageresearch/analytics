[0:00] Let's stand and we'll pray and then
[0:03] we'll go to the scriptures. Zoe, it's
[0:05] going to be uh 1 Peter 1:13 that we
[0:08] start at. Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[0:11] we come before you, Lord, and we just
[0:13] want to commit this time to you. We ask
[0:15] that your Holy Spirit would guide us and
[0:18] lead us, Lord, into all truth, Lord, and
[0:21] that you'd reveal yourself to us, Lord,
[0:24] and that you'd speak something into our
[0:26] lives that would cause us to grow in our
[0:28] walk with you, Lord. We commit ourselves
[0:30] to you. We commit this time to you. We
[0:32] just want to step out of the way that
[0:33] you would have your way in Jesus name.
[0:35] Amen.
[0:36] Amen.
[0:37] So, 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 13 and we'll
[0:41] read through 17. Wherefore g up the
[0:43] loins of your mind, be sober and hope to
[0:46] the end for the grace that is to be
[0:48] brought to you unto you at the
[0:50] revelation of Jesus Christ. As obedient
[0:53] children, not fashioning yourselves
[0:55] according to the former lusts in your
[0:57] ignorance, but as he which has called
[0:59] you as holy, so be holy in all manner of
[1:02] conversation. That means speaks of
[1:04] conduct behavior. Because it is written,
[1:07] be holy, for I am holy. And if you call
[1:10] on the father who without respect p
[1:13] judges according to every man's work,
[1:15] pass the time of your sojouring here in
[1:18] fear. May the Lord add the blessing to
[1:20] the reading of his word. be going into
[1:23] part two of the life of Christ.
[1:26] As we often hear this, we speak about
[1:30] the life of Christ and we want to have
[1:32] the life of Christ manifested in us, but
[1:35] we also need to speak about what the
[1:39] details are. It's very very simplified
[1:41] version to say we just need the Holy
[1:44] Ghost.
[1:45] That's all we need.
[1:47] And when you get there, you've arrived
[1:49] at the end. No, you've arrived at the
[1:52] beginning.
[1:54] And we we're even instructed in the
[1:56] scriptures that we need to be
[1:58] transformed. So, we need to go through a
[2:00] metamorphosis
[2:02] by what?
[2:04] By by having emotions and sensations and
[2:08] feelings, all those come come with life
[2:11] just in general and the life of the Holy
[2:13] Ghost. But that's not what it is. We're
[2:16] transformed by the renewing of our mind.
[2:19] And so there's a word that needs to go
[2:21] forth to be preached. There's a word
[2:23] that's written in the scriptures and it
[2:25] needs to be quickened or revealed in our
[2:28] hearts. It needs to bring correction.
[2:31] Needs to be instruction because at the
[2:33] core of
[2:35] godly living, the modern world has put
[2:38] it this way. God loves you.
[2:42] And that's the gospel that's preached.
[2:43] God loves you. So
[2:46] believe in him. Okay, we can all see
[2:49] there's a core truth of that. But if
[2:51] that's how we're presenting it, like why
[2:53] should I love him? Like I got stuff
[2:56] going on here. I I I don't need to be
[2:58] troubled by just cuz somebody loves us.
[3:02] Like, okay, why does that demand a
[3:04] response? No, you're lost.
[3:08] You're on your way to hell. Why are you
[3:11] lost and on on your way to hell? Because
[3:12] God is holy and because God is just. And
[3:16] there's a day of reckoning that's
[3:17] coming. I mean, that's how Paul preached
[3:19] the gospel.
[3:19] Amen.
[3:20] When he went to the jud he's going to
[3:21] judge the world by one, by the man that
[3:24] he's appointed, Jesus Christ, he didn't
[3:26] go out and say, "God is love, everyone.
[3:29] God loves you. He wants you to have a
[3:31] good life.
[3:32] He wants you to be happy. God is holy."
[3:36] Amen.
[3:36] Right? God is just. And he demands and
[3:39] anyone that's going to live in his home
[3:41] in heaven will also be the same. And so
[3:45] we face a dire circumstance because you
[3:50] and I are not holy. You and I, the
[3:52] condition that we're born in, we have
[3:55] evil there with on the inside of the
[3:59] inside that's corrupting our very nature
[4:02] and is causing us to sin and is leading
[4:06] us on a path to hell. And so we have to
[4:10] understand that God is holy and he tells
[4:12] us to be holy. And this is the very this
[4:14] is the core reason and need actually for
[4:18] the story history and the story of
[4:20] redemption is that God made man good but
[4:25] man was corrupted. And so God was going
[4:28] to make a way for man to return back to
[4:31] his original condition and relationship.
[4:34] Because when you're not good, when
[4:36] you're evil, you cannot fellowship with
[4:40] God. God can't even look
[4:44] at evil. He hates evil. And so when we
[4:48] start the gospel from this other
[4:50] direction that the modern world starts
[4:52] it from, it's really just a a gospel.
[4:56] It might be good news, but it's not the
[4:59] real good news.
[5:01] God does want to heal our spirits. God
[5:03] does
[5:05] want to heal our lives. God does want to
[5:08] uh to deliver us from captivity, from
[5:11] bondage to sin, from from the pain of
[5:15] our uh uh if if we've been hurt or
[5:18] damaged in life, he wants to restore us,
[5:21] but that's the effects of the gospel.
[5:24] People want the effects of the gospel
[5:26] without the gospel,
[5:28] right? Amen. They want to go to a church
[5:31] and be told a psychological message that
[5:33] they can be made made uh whole without
[5:37] sacrifice, without blood, without death.
[5:42] Death is required. Not only the death of
[5:45] Jesus Christ,
[5:47] but actually you have to die also.
[5:50] You have to die to that old life. And
[5:54] that's part of it. That's he calls us to
[5:56] be holy. So we need to be holy.
[6:00] What does it say in all manner of
[6:02] conversation to what does it mean to be
[6:04] holy?
[6:06] It means to be set aside, to be
[6:08] separate, to be different.
[6:11] One way of saying it is to be sacred.
[6:15] You know, the the in the Old Testament,
[6:18] they gathered together all the gold and
[6:20] silver of Egypt and the brass, the
[6:23] bronze, whatever it was. And they took
[6:25] that and they fashioned it into
[6:27] different uh items for the tabernacle.
[6:32] And those were called the ho in the holy
[6:35] things. These were the holy things. Why
[6:38] were they holy? Because gold is holy.
[6:40] Because I mean, I think some people
[6:41] would like us to think that, but that's
[6:43] not why. It was set aside. It was
[6:47] sacred. It wasn't to be used for common
[6:50] things, for normal things, for regular
[6:53] things. It was only to be set aside for
[6:55] the service of God. So when we're called
[6:58] to be holy, that's what it's speaking
[7:00] of. You we are set aside for the service
[7:03] of God. It means more than that. Also,
[7:06] if you think about holiness, holiness is
[7:09] part of God being light. God is a
[7:12] consuming fire, right?
[7:15] God is holy. God is light. God is a
[7:18] consuming fire. So this holiness also
[7:22] speaks of moral perfection.
[7:25] Now we're really sunk.
[7:28] Now we're absolutely sunk because we
[7:31] even even with the Holy Ghost, we cannot
[7:35] achieve moral perfection
[7:38] in this life. I know there's Methodists
[7:41] and holiness doctrines that make you
[7:43] think that a person can achieve moral
[7:46] perfection, but the Bible speaking of
[7:48] the perfection of the saints is not
[7:50] speaking of moral perfection. It's
[7:52] speaking of maturity. As long as we're
[7:55] in this mortal body, we will always be
[7:58] in the process of sinning and repenting.
[8:01] Amen. And so this call to holiness is
[8:07] something that is not merely external.
[8:10] Let's go let's go even a little step
[8:12] further. It's not an external holiness.
[8:16] That's not what God is requiring. He's
[8:19] not merely looking at us and say, "Look,
[8:21] as long as you look like what the Bible
[8:23] says and follow these exact rules,
[8:26] you're going to be okay." We would like
[8:28] it to be that way. It would be so simple
[8:31] for us, but it would be so perverted. It
[8:34] would be so against. We would make an
[8:37] idol out of those laws. We'd make an
[8:40] idol out of those who maintained those
[8:43] laws because if there's laws, somebody's
[8:45] got to maintain the laws.
[8:46] So, you're going to make an idol out of
[8:48] the preachers. Going to make an idol out
[8:49] of the deacon back there,
[8:52] right? it's going to turn in
[8:54] automatically turn into idolatry when
[8:56] we're when it's talking about following
[8:59] specific laws to achieve holiness.
[9:02] That's not what it is. It's an inward
[9:06] work that starts where? In the soul and
[9:11] it comes from the inside pushing out. It
[9:14] is it is not an external force of the
[9:18] church even of mom and dad though that's
[9:21] part of it. The word comes from the
[9:23] external but that word has to go from
[9:25] the external has to go to the inside of
[9:28] the inside to bring a change and that is
[9:31] the kind of holiness that God is looking
[9:34] for. It's a holiness that is in the
[9:37] heart that is uh you look in the Old
[9:40] Testament number of different times.
[9:43] Uh men of God are spoken of and said to
[9:46] have a perfect heart.
[9:48] Well, every one of them we can point out
[9:51] their faults.
[9:52] We can preach sermons on all of their
[9:55] faults. And yet God looked at their
[9:56] hearts and saw a he said, "I see a
[10:00] perfect heart. It isn't a sinless heart,
[10:02] but what is it?" I and I I think I
[10:04] mentioned this the last time I spoke.
[10:08] David David you this king was good
[10:11] because he had a heart in him like
[10:14] David. Yet his heart wasn't perfect like
[10:17] David.
[10:19] So God must be judging by a slightly
[10:21] different standard and vision and
[10:23] viewpoint than we're judging by. Because
[10:26] none of us would look at David's life
[10:27] and say, "Man, he had a perfect heart.
[10:31] That ombre was rough. He killed
[10:35] thousands times tens of thousands of
[10:38] people. He
[10:41] committed adultery
[10:43] and he had the husband murdered and
[10:47] tried to cover it up. So it wasn't even
[10:50] the external behavior that God himself
[10:53] was looking at to declare a man with a
[10:55] perfect heart.
[10:56] Amen.
[10:57] What was he looking at? What was the
[10:59] attitude? Saul.
[11:02] Saul is an incredible story to me and
[11:05] you know we have the blessing of
[11:08] hindsight and what God declares over
[11:10] that. But what if we didn't? What if you
[11:13] just presented what if I told you a
[11:16] story about a man? God told him to go
[11:18] and kill everyone
[11:21] animals and destroy everything. All
[11:24] right? And he went and he did that
[11:27] mostly.
[11:29] Right? He went and he he he obeyed up to
[11:32] a certain point. He killed all the
[11:34] people. Well, he saved the king alive.
[11:37] You know, he's going to make a spect
[11:39] spectacle of him. He was going to mock
[11:40] him. You know, he was going to use him
[11:42] as a spectacle. He and he saved some of
[11:45] the animals cuz you have military men.
[11:47] You got to feed them.
[11:48] So, let's save some of those animals.
[11:51] And let's I mean, in other cases, we
[11:54] could fly upon the spoil. I mean, if you
[11:57] defeat some an enemy, why not take their
[11:59] stuff?
[12:00] Yeah.
[12:00] I mean, it makes sense, right? And then
[12:03] you have another guy we'll tell you
[12:04] about. He cheated on his wife.
[12:09] And then he realized that his he got her
[12:12] pregnant
[12:13] and he's got to cover it up.
[12:15] So, what does he do? He goes and he
[12:17] murders
[12:19] this woman's husband.
[12:22] All right. Now, I want you to judge. Who
[12:24] would you choose
[12:27] out of these two people as a man, as a
[12:29] human being?
[12:32] You definitely, you'd always choose
[12:36] the guy that mostly obeyed God. That's
[12:39] the human judgment. But what did God
[12:41] say? What was God's choice? What was
[12:43] God's? We all know he he told Saul,
[12:48] "You have rejected the word of the Lord.
[12:50] So God has rejected you." But that
[12:53] wasn't the first statement. That was the
[12:56] the first statement was a confrontation.
[12:59] What is the what is the sound of the
[13:01] sheep? Have you obeyed the word of the
[13:04] Lord? Yep. I obeyed the word of the
[13:06] Lord.
[13:08] That's where that is the place where he
[13:10] manifested a messed up heart.
[13:14] That is the very place of failure for
[13:17] Saul.
[13:19] You say, "No, it was when he went and he
[13:22] didn't kill everyone." It started there.
[13:25] Sure.
[13:27] But what was Saul's attitude when
[13:29] confronted by the prophet?
[13:31] Amen.
[13:31] No, I did it.
[13:33] I absolutely did it. What's the What's
[13:36] the bleeding of the sheep?
[13:38] Amen.
[13:38] And the mooing of the cows. Oh, well,
[13:41] the people. What did he do? He didn't
[13:44] blame himself. He didn't take person He
[13:45] didn't take personal responsibility for
[13:48] the sin that he committed. He put it on
[13:50] another person.
[13:51] Yeah.
[13:51] It's their fault. Well, you're the king.
[13:55] You have to take responsibility.
[13:57] You're the dad in the home.
[13:59] Amen.
[14:00] You take responsibility. You're the one
[14:03] that was responsible for them. Don't say
[14:05] your kid was the problem.
[14:07] You failed to lead your home. Saul, you
[14:10] failed to lead over your responsibility.
[14:14] And what did he do at the end when he
[14:17] was finally confronted and told the
[14:19] kingdom has been ripped away from you
[14:22] and been given to someone that's better
[14:23] than you?
[14:26] Harsh words. What did he say? Yeah, I
[14:28] sinned, but only honor me now before the
[14:31] people. So, what was what was it? What
[14:33] was Saul manifesting? His concern wasn't
[14:35] with his relationship with God. his
[14:38] isn't his concern was what the image
[14:41] that he had externally
[14:43] before the people
[14:45] don't let my image be marred in front of
[14:47] the people what was David
[14:50] I mean
[14:52] you can't really can't make up much
[14:54] worse that story about what someone
[14:57] would do he violated everything that is
[14:59] sacred and holy and God came and told us
[15:03] told a parable
[15:05] and David got angry and said, "I'm going
[15:08] to kill that guy."
[15:13] And what what are the next famous words?
[15:15] To me, this is the confrontation of the
[15:18] ages because we're confronted with the
[15:21] same problem and the same issue and the
[15:25] same thing. Different sins, different
[15:28] issues, different things in life. But
[15:30] what is our initial response? I did my
[15:34] best. I mean, you know, look, it's
[15:36] difficult, but I went part of most of
[15:38] the way. If it wasn't for these other
[15:40] people, you know, I tried, but those
[15:42] people are problems.
[15:45] No, David didn't say that.
[15:48] David in instantaneously
[15:52] when he was told he was the man, he was
[15:54] the murderer, he was the thief,
[15:57] instantaneously.
[16:00] It wasn't boy, I mean, I'm the king. I
[16:02] could kill the prophet. There was no
[16:04] hesitation in David. I yay I have sinned
[16:09] against the Lord and the Lord only.
[16:13] And what was God's answer?
[16:15] David took responsibility for his
[16:18] actions
[16:19] immediately. And he admitted his fault
[16:22] instantaneously when he was confronted.
[16:25] And what was God's response? Fear not.
[16:28] You'll not die. I've pardoned your sin,
[16:31] but you're going to pay for it. You're
[16:33] going to reap what you sow.
[16:36] Right? And so what even though David did
[16:39] reap what he sowed through the rest of
[16:41] his life, he had horrible
[16:45] problems within his family.
[16:48] I mean, problem after problem. Even so,
[16:51] even despite all that, God's memoriam of
[16:56] David was he had a perfect heart. Can
[16:59] you think about that for a second? It's
[17:00] not so much the problem of your sin
[17:04] that makes you unholy. Sure, it does.
[17:08] But once you have the Holy Ghost, God
[17:10] settles that. It isn't the problem that
[17:13] you sin. The problem is how do you
[17:15] respond when you do sin?
[17:18] Because we're all going to sin,
[17:20] little ones and big ones. But is number
[17:23] one is is your heart to want to do it.
[17:27] Number two is is how do you respond when
[17:29] you do do it and you're confronted over
[17:31] it? And many times we're not even
[17:33] confronted by people though uh we are
[17:37] sometimes
[17:39] many times we're confronted by the Holy
[17:41] Spirit. And how do we handle it? Well,
[17:43] you know, look, Lord, I uh I did most of
[17:46] it. I came up most of the way. That's
[17:49] not going to work. That that does to
[17:52] God. That is just like rejecting the
[17:55] word of the Lord.
[17:57] That's part and parcel with that. I've
[17:59] come I did my best but Gideon hindered
[18:02] me
[18:04] or whatever whatever any of us you can
[18:06] blame blame your kids blame another
[18:08] person blame the pastor blame this one
[18:10] blame that one. God doesn't want that.
[18:13] He actually hates that. He considers it
[18:16] rejecting the word. He comes and
[18:18] confronts you over your sin. What is
[18:20] that? What is he expressing to you when
[18:23] he confronts you over your sin? He could
[18:25] just leave you completely alone like the
[18:28] rest of the world. He could leave you to
[18:31] your own devices and say, "I leave you
[18:34] to your devices." That's God's wrath.
[18:36] Actually, when he leaves you just to go
[18:39] on sinning and go on sinning and go on
[18:41] sinning, that's that is the departure of
[18:44] the grace of God from you. So, what is
[18:47] it when we're confronted over our sin?
[18:50] That's the love of God.
[18:51] Amen.
[18:52] Expressed to us. The love of God isn't
[18:54] removing all troubles from your life.
[18:59] That's not the love of God. We think
[19:01] that's what the love of God is, but it's
[19:03] not.
[19:05] You know, that's because our minds are
[19:06] so perverted that we think,
[19:09] you know, the Bible says uh God nice and
[19:14] in him is no meanness at all. God is not
[19:17] nice and a fruit of the spirit is not
[19:19] niceness and it never says love is nice.
[19:24] It says love is kind. That's different
[19:26] than being nice.
[19:29] You know, he's he's he's a he's a lamb.
[19:33] Yes. But he's also a lion.
[19:36] Amen.
[19:36] Right. And so God is going to be sure
[19:42] to confront us over our sin. And what is
[19:44] how are we going to respond to him?
[19:49] I think that's man. My goodness, I went
[19:52] nowhere near my notes.
[19:54] All right, so that's the first part that
[19:57] we went through. God is holy, so be holy
[20:01] in all manner of conduct because it is
[20:05] written, be holy, for I am holy. And it
[20:09] says that if if you call on the father
[20:10] who without respects respect of persons
[20:14] judges according to every man's work,
[20:16] pass the time of your souljourning here
[20:18] in fear. God is looking and he's
[20:23] both judging and discerning our works.
[20:27] And of course, for believers, it's not
[20:29] that we're going to be condemned over
[20:30] our works. But what is it? It's we'll
[20:34] receive our reward based upon our work
[20:36] on our works.
[20:38] You know, it says some some are saved
[20:40] though as by fire, right? their works.
[20:44] They built wood, hay, and stubble and
[20:47] their works are burnt up. And then some
[20:50] build gold or some precious stones and
[20:53] the fire will try it and actually purify
[20:56] their works, right?
[21:00] And so when we look at this, I guess I
[21:02] guess there's one thing we can say and
[21:03] this ties in what I'm going to get into
[21:06] start to get into next is is there's one
[21:09] thing that we actually have control over
[21:12] and that's if we forgive other people.
[21:14] Amen.
[21:15] If we don't forgive then God won't
[21:17] forgive us.
[21:19] So you you in that way you control your
[21:21] eternal destination.
[21:23] God won't lose a one that's
[21:26] predestinated seed. But so then we have
[21:30] to flip that on its head is then those
[21:32] who are his predestinated seed will have
[21:35] will forgive.
[21:37] Right?
[21:37] But you can be in a position where you
[21:39] you know you don't forgive and then you
[21:43] get the fruit of a lack of forgiveness
[21:45] in your life.
[21:46] Amen.
[21:47] Hebrews chapter 12
[21:50] 14-1 17. And we'll just get a little bit
[21:52] into this next portion of my notes.
[21:56] Follow peace with all men and holiness
[21:59] without which no man shall see the Lord.
[22:03] Looking diligently, lest any man fail of
[22:05] the grace of God, lest any root of
[22:07] bitterness, springing up trouble you,
[22:09] and thereby many be defiled. Let me let
[22:13] me pause before I go for go back to
[22:14] verse uh 14, Zoe.
[22:18] So again, we're we're talking about
[22:20] holiness and we understand under the
[22:22] under the gospel of Jesus Christ that
[22:25] holiness is something that God is
[22:26] creating within us. It's a condition of
[22:29] the heart,
[22:30] right? That's it's an inward work that
[22:34] he does within us that then permeates to
[22:37] the rest of our being. And and
[22:39] sanctification that sanctification is
[22:41] like the action verb of holiness or
[22:44] holy.
[22:46] And so God, you know, we're the Bible
[22:48] says we're saved through sanctification
[22:51] of the spirit and belief of the truth.
[22:54] So a part of our salvation experience
[22:57] experience is a ongoing process of
[23:02] sanctification. So that is not bringing
[23:05] forth merely external holiness. Anyone
[23:09] can be a parrot and parrot what
[23:12] the outward works of real holiness is.
[23:16] That's not what we're talking about.
[23:18] There's an inward
[23:20] thing that happens that manifests itself
[23:23] outwardly.
[23:24] And so that's that's what God is doing
[23:27] with us. So if you if you're saved,
[23:30] truly saved, scriptural salvation, the
[23:33] the the the result in your life is a
[23:36] process of cleansing and sanctification.
[23:39] And without that, we won't we we're not
[23:42] going to heaven to see the Lord, right?
[23:44] We'll we'll meet him at the great white
[23:46] throne judgment in condemnation,
[23:51] not in salvation. Amen.
[23:53] So a necessary part of the salvation
[23:57] process is him creating
[24:00] uh holiness within us. We have to be
[24:02] made fit in order to see him right
[24:07] without which no man shall see the Lord.
[24:09] So without peace,
[24:13] without living a life of peace,
[24:15] manifesting a life of peace, not
[24:18] manifesting a life of chaos,
[24:20] right? manifesting a life of peace
[24:24] and holiness, we won't see the Lord. So
[24:26] the it's like it's giving us here are
[24:29] the qualifications for you to see the
[24:31] Lord. Would do you wish to see the Lord,
[24:32] brother Chris? Okay. Follow peace with
[24:36] all men and holiness. This is what you
[24:39] must do.
[24:41] We understand it's an inward work.
[24:44] But this is showing the inward work done
[24:47] in your soul is going to produce this.
[24:50] Yeah. Amen.
[24:51] Right?
[24:53] In order to see the Lord, you have to
[24:54] have these things being manifested in
[24:56] your life. Not by your own efforts, not
[24:59] by your own deeds, not an external, but
[25:02] the internal work that God has done will
[25:05] produce this in your life.
[25:08] All right? So then go to 15 again.
[25:11] looking diligently, lest any man fail of
[25:14] the grace of God, lest any root of
[25:16] bitterness springing up trouble you, and
[25:19] thereby many be defiled, lest there be
[25:21] any fornicator or profane person as
[25:24] Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold
[25:26] his birthright. For you know how that
[25:28] afterward, when he would have inherited
[25:30] the blessing, he was rejected, for he
[25:33] found no place of repentance, though he
[25:35] sought it carefully with tears.
[25:39] All right. So, root of bitterness. I
[25:43] guess it's going to be tough to get very
[25:46] far into this, but we'll just lay a
[25:48] little foundation for for next week,
[25:50] Lord willing. So, a root of bitterness,
[25:54] we think about this. There has to be a
[25:56] seed planted.
[25:57] Yeah.
[25:58] You don't just get a random root
[26:00] anywhere. And it depends on what kind of
[26:01] plant you're thinking of. You know, if
[26:03] you if you plant a potato or a sweet
[26:05] potato, you know, the seed looks a lot
[26:08] like a root.
[26:10] So, let's put it that way. But if we're
[26:12] going to look at it in this direction is
[26:14] to have a root of bitterness, there has
[26:16] to be some sort some form of seed
[26:20] planted there. So, there has to be a
[26:23] seed that would produce a root that is
[26:27] bitter. And so, you know, perhaps
[26:31] there's a seed planted and it's laying
[26:33] there dormant, but once the right
[26:35] conditions are met, it's not just a
[26:37] seed. You know, some some of the soil
[26:40] here in Bufort, you plant a seed and it
[26:42] don't do a whole lot. You got to get
[26:44] some you got to get the right conditions
[26:47] there. And when the right conditions are
[26:49] met, that is when you see that seed
[26:52] that's planted begin to take root
[26:56] and begin to grow.
[26:59] And so
[27:01] a bitter
[27:03] fruit
[27:05] uh comes from
[27:07] a seed and a bitter root. So the type of
[27:11] ground affects it. True. But there's
[27:15] there's many different types of bitter
[27:17] plants and bitter roots. We understand
[27:19] that there's good seed and there's bad
[27:21] seed. There's there's wheat and there's
[27:24] weeds. Think of it that way. There's
[27:26] good fruit and there's bitter fruit.
[27:30] And so you're looking at bitter fruit. I
[27:33] mean, we can just simplify it because
[27:35] I'm going to have to close shortly, but
[27:38] looking at a root of bitterness, there
[27:42] there has to be a seed of unforgiveness
[27:47] there in the heart
[27:48] and that will produce
[27:51] a root of bitterness.
[27:54] And it says when that root of bitterness
[27:56] springs up,
[27:59] it not only troubles you, right?
[28:02] But it actually can defile many people
[28:05] around you.
[28:07] So you know it's like it's the same idea
[28:09] that an inward something on the inside,
[28:13] right? If you plant the right thing on
[28:16] the inside, what will happen? The right
[28:18] thing will be manifested on the outside.
[28:20] But if there's a wrong thing planted on
[28:23] the inside, that's going to produce the
[28:26] wrong kind of life. And you know, let's
[28:28] let's just put it this way. We as
[28:30] Christians can find oursel that Paul
[28:32] isn't writing this to heathens. Paul
[28:34] isn't writing this to total unbelievers.
[28:37] He's writing this to the Hebrews. So
[28:40] people that purport to believe the word
[28:42] of God. And so
[28:46] we as believers can get in this
[28:48] condition as well where there's the
[28:50] wrong kind of seed that we've refused to
[28:52] forgive other people or we refuse to own
[28:56] our faults.
[28:57] Yeah.
[28:58] And from from that then springs out all
[29:02] kinds of roots of bitterness and it not
[29:05] only gives you trouble, right? I mean,
[29:08] think of the emotional pain, the mental
[29:11] pain, and the fact that you're literally
[29:13] blocking your own spiritual growth
[29:15] because of it. But then because you're
[29:17] doing that to yourself, if you're a dad,
[29:20] what's happening to your wife?
[29:21] Yeah.
[29:22] Then what's happening to your children?
[29:25] You know what's h then? Then from there,
[29:28] first they're the first impact. Then
[29:29] what's happening to the people you're in
[29:31] fellowship with? It will go out and
[29:34] absolutely
[29:35] bring defilement and hinder spiritual
[29:39] growth for everybody around you. And and
[29:42] uh I have to quit there. Let's pray.
[29:46] Heavenly Father, we thank you so much
[29:48] for your word.
[29:49] We pray Lord that it would uh penetrate
[29:51] deep in our hearts, Lord. that it would
[29:54] it would come to a place that we would
[29:56] realize, Lord, if there's something
[29:58] there that's hindering us, that we would
[30:01] take our own action,
[30:03] that we would take our own steps that
[30:05] the word says to do, Lord. Many times we
[30:07] wait for deliverance when the fact is
[30:09] that deliverance is waiting for us.
[30:12] Amen. because there's just simple steps
[30:14] that we need to take, Lord, that we
[30:17] would humble humble our own pride
[30:20] and just deal with whatever it is that
[30:23] we're
