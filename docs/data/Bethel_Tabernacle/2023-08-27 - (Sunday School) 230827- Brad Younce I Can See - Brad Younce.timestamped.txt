[0:57] overcoming
[0:59] but I ended up just sitting on the title
[1:01] this morning says I can see
[1:03] so blessed are your eyes that you can
[1:06] see you know we're sitting here this
[1:07] morning a privileged people
[1:10] if we see this truth
[1:12] we're a blessed people
[1:13] we should be the happiest people in the
[1:15] face of this Earth
[1:17] of what we what God has allowed us to
[1:19] see because there are some people
[1:21] they don't even have that option
[1:23] there's some people that sits in the
[1:25] church
[1:26] they said I water in the world are they
[1:28] talking about
[1:30] you know we know program said never
[1:32] every uh congregation there's three
[1:34] kinds of believers
[1:36] there's not very many here this morning
[1:37] so which one are you
[1:39] [Laughter]
[1:41] so if you're an unbeliever hopefully
[1:44] your eyes can be open
[1:46] and you can see but blessed are our eyes
[1:51] your people just coming to church they
[1:52] have no clue they'll just sit and listen
[1:54] to the preacher and like what's he even
[1:56] saying
[1:58] some come to church says man I wish to
[2:00] preach a hurry and get over so we get
[2:01] brother Tony back out here boy that guy
[2:03] can sing
[2:05] we like the way it makes us feel
[2:07] but we're but we're rejoicing
[2:10] those that can see I mean when a brother
[2:12] stands up here and says
[2:14] God says I am one God not three we could
[2:18] say amen amen
[2:20] When God says I came down born of a
[2:22] virgin
[2:23] walked on this Earth as humans we could
[2:26] say Amen
[2:28] where God says it wasn't an apple in the
[2:30] Garden of Eden that caused the fall
[2:33] or we could say Amen
[2:35] because our eyes are open blessed are
[2:37] your eyes
[2:38] for they see
[2:40] he said I sent my Prophet to forerun me
[2:42] we could say Amen
[2:45] he opened the Seven Seals all we can do
[2:47] is say Amen
[2:49] everything everything God says
[2:51] we say Amen because bless our our eyes
[2:54] for we see our ears because we can hear
[2:59] it just comes down to one thing
[3:01] if your eyes are open
[3:03] you're predestinated for it
[3:05] your call to this we are ordained to
[3:08] hear
[3:09] there's nothing we can do with it we
[3:10] didn't have a choice
[3:12] we'd have a choice we were called to
[3:14] this thing we are Overcomers
[3:17] we're Overcomers because God said so
[3:21] nothing we could say you heard preachers
[3:23] say we your kid didn't have a choice
[3:25] whether we born or not Jackson didn't
[3:27] have a choice ah no I ain't coming
[3:31] he's coming
[3:34] Hallelujah that's why we should come to
[3:37] church every time the doors are open
[3:41] right now we're waiting on the priest to
[3:43] come out to open up the Scrolls
[3:46] and open up and he'll say turn your
[3:48] Bibles to revelation
[3:50] okay he's going to reveal to us an open
[3:52] Word and we can understand and we can
[3:55] say Amen
[3:58] we could say Amen to over every word
[4:02] all this so we can have overcoming power
[4:05] that's why it's so important important
[4:07] do we try to make it to every service
[4:11] if we miss one service we miss so much
[4:14] remember the story it's happened it
[4:16] happened to Thomas
[4:17] you know after Jesus died
[4:19] you know John 2019 and it says then the
[4:22] same day talk about the resurrection
[4:25] at Eden being the first day of the week
[4:27] when the doors were shut where the
[4:30] disciples were assembled for fear of the
[4:32] Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst
[4:34] and said unto them
[4:35] peace be still
[4:37] can you imagine
[4:39] you're all sitting there y'all crying
[4:41] and sad and
[4:43] your your Leader's dead gone
[4:46] all of a sudden your doors are locked
[4:47] barred nobody can come in
[4:50] then Jesus appears right in your midst
[4:52] yeah
[4:53] yeah he's a ghost
[4:55] scared him to death that's
[4:58] we didn't see Jesus come through those
[4:59] doors this morning
[5:02] he's here
[5:03] he come in and had him a seat
[5:07] yeah
[5:07] we couldn't have a service without him
[5:11] and when he has said so he showed unto
[5:13] them his hands and hands and his side
[5:16] and then the disciples were glad
[5:19] when they saw the Lord
[5:21] then Jesus said to them peace be unto
[5:23] you as my father has sent me so send I
[5:25] you and he breathed on them and said
[5:27] unto you receive ye the Holy Ghost
[5:31] but Thomas
[5:33] one of the twelve
[5:34] was not there
[5:36] Thomas missed service for it
[5:39] for a reason
[5:41] you know ten disciples were there except
[5:43] for Thomas he didn't come to church that
[5:45] service
[5:46] guess what he'd missed
[5:49] he missed the visitation of the Lord
[5:52] he missed Jesus walking into the church
[5:55] through the walls
[5:57] that's what happens when we miss church
[5:59] sometimes we might miss a visitation
[6:02] Hallelujah
[6:04] you know we might even miss that
[6:05] refilling of the spirit
[6:07] you know our brothers we get together
[6:09] here every Thursday night and that's one
[6:11] of our main goals our prayer for
[6:13] refilling of the Holy Ghost to drop
[6:15] Among Us
[6:16] we might miss that service and it have
[6:18] actually happened
[6:19] whew
[6:21] wow
[6:24] you know every time you miss a service
[6:26] there's always somebody to say
[6:28] that was the best service ever
[6:35] I see these texts and I for the
[6:37] ministers chat and I'll be out somewhere
[6:40] wow wow what a service what a man that's

[6:59] what look what you missed Jesus came he
[7:02] breathed on us
[7:04] we received the Holy Ghost
[7:07] Thomas like ah

[7:11] finger in his hand in his hands fill the
[7:13] prince put my hand in his side then I'll
[7:15] know who then I'll know for sure
[7:18] well the next week that's coming back to

[7:36] at 6 50. close enough
[7:39] and after eight days again the disciples
[7:41] were within and Thomas with them then
[7:43] came Jesus the doors being shut
[7:45] again stood in the Mist
[7:48] peace be unto you
[7:50] you know Jesus didn't go or Peter said
[7:52] hey Peter how you been this week John he
[7:54] didn't talk to anything he walked
[7:55] straight to Thomas come here Thomas
[7:58] stick your finger right there in my into
[8:00] my hand let me have your hand and put it
[8:02] in my side
[8:03] what did Thomas say
[8:05] my Lord and my God
[8:10] Jesus just saith unto him Thomas
[8:13] because
[8:14] thou has seen me thou Hast believed
[8:20] blessed
[8:24] this definition for blessed is supremely
[8:26] blessed
[8:28] we're blessed from on high
[8:30] Supreme supremely blessed you're well
[8:33] off
[8:34] happy
[8:36] so we ought to be happy this morning
[8:38] blessed are they that have not seen
[8:42] and yet believe
[8:45] I can save today this scripture has been
[8:47] fulfilled
[8:49] blessed are you that have not seen but
[8:51] you believe
[8:53] we haven't seen Jesus but we believe him
[8:58] we didn't see Jesus walk on the water
[9:00] but we believe it happened
[9:03] we didn't see Jesus take two two loaves
[9:07] of bread and five fishes and feed over 5
[9:09] 000 people
[9:10] but we believe it happened
[9:13] we didn't see Jesus walk up to the tomb
[9:15] of Lazarus say Lazarus come forth
[9:19] and a man have been dead four days come
[9:21] come to life
[9:23] we didn't see it but how many believed
[9:25] it happened
[9:26] we didn't see the stripes put on his
[9:27] back
[9:28] but we believe it happened
[9:32] phew Hallelujah I gotta calm down
[9:36] gotta leave it for the preacher
[9:41] you know I I wrote this down I put it in
[9:44] big bold letters
[9:45] I believed it happened
[9:48] just like if I was there and seen it
[9:52] myself
[9:53] that's how real this is
[9:56] that's how real this message is
[9:59] I wasn't there
[10:01] when it happened
[10:03] but I believe it happened
[10:06] in second Corinthians 5 7 for we walk by
[10:10] faith
[10:11] not by sight
[10:12] what happened to brother Brandon when he
[10:14] was he landed in Memphis and going to
[10:16] the plane
[10:18] keep walking
[10:20] what I got a plane sitting right there
[10:23] keep walking
[10:26] okay
[10:27] so he just walked by faith
[10:29] it don't matter what look what it looked
[10:31] like around him
[10:32] he walked in a rough neighborhood
[10:36] brother Ron Spencer told one time we
[10:39] went to visit that uh
[10:41] that pyramid That Bass Pro Shop down in
[10:43] Memphis
[10:45] and brother Ron says you know this is
[10:47] the very ground where brother Branham
[10:49] come walking down through here walked
[10:50] right across this ground to go into the
[10:52] apartments and sitting still behind the
[10:54] pyramid this day oh my how
[10:56] awesome is that they built a pyramid on
[10:58] this ground
[11:00] but he kept walking
[11:02] no matter what that neighborhood looked
[11:03] like
[11:06] what happened when he walked by faith
[11:08] somebody's son got healed
[11:13] we walk by faith we live by it the just
[11:15] shall live by faith
[11:18] it's not by what we see our eyes can
[11:22] deceive us
[11:24] how dark it is out here all the stuff we
[11:26] see all the chaos all the all the bad
[11:29] things that we're looking at
[11:31] we can't base it on that we base it on
[11:34] on faith not by sight
[11:37] Hebrews 11 1 says now Faith is the
[11:41] substance of things hoped for the
[11:43] evidence of Things Not Seen
[11:47] Hallelujah for by it the elders obtained
[11:51] a good report
[11:53] through faith we understand that the
[11:56] worlds were framed by the word of God
[11:58] so that things which are seen were made
[12:01] not made of things which do appear
[12:04] another version of this I like faith
[12:07] is the confidence
[12:11] that what we hope for
[12:14] and I Look to that word hope there it
[12:16] means expect
[12:19] faith is the concept of that what we
[12:21] expect will actually happen
[12:29] Hallelujah it gives us the Assurance
[12:31] about things we cannot see
[12:35] you know faith is like starting your car
[12:38] how many thought about it when you got
[12:40] in your garage just more and turn the
[12:41] key
[12:43] how many what do you think did you think
[12:45] about what happened when you turn that
[12:46] key what happens behind the steering
[12:48] wheel
[12:50] they got this little wire that runs out
[12:51] of the out of the starter that or the
[12:54] when you turn your key down switch into
[12:55] the behind the steering wheel out to
[12:57] your car to your starter
[12:59] from there to wherever it goes I don't
[13:01] know
[13:03] you can't see what's going on behind
[13:05] that steering wheel
[13:07] but things are happening
[13:12] when you turn the key things are moving
[13:17] it's like faith
[13:19] you don't think about it
[13:21] you just get your car and you put it in
[13:23] reverse back out of your garage put it
[13:24] drive and take off you're not thinking
[13:26] about what what it's doing
[13:28] oh you got one goal in mind you're
[13:30] headed to church
[13:33] that's that kind of faith
[13:35] we have in God
[13:37] we don't even think about it
[13:40] When you pray it just happens
[13:44] things are moving and we can't see you
[13:47] might pray for something forever and
[13:49] ever
[13:51] we pray for stuff for years we're like
[13:53] Lord have mercy why don't you answering
[13:56] and so I said well Abraham
[13:58] waited 25 years for his although it
[14:01] ain't got 25 years
[14:03] but things are working when you're
[14:05] praying things start happening
[14:09] you believe it's going to happen I have
[14:11] a confidence that the Raptors are going
[14:12] to take place
[14:15] and I'm going
[14:17] how many has that confidence the Rapture
[14:19] is taking place and I'm going
[14:22] through their faith the people in the
[14:24] days of old earned a good reputation
[14:28] Abraham had faith
[14:32] like I said he waited 25 years on it
[14:35] him sitting there like an old man on a
[14:37] cane I'm going to have a child
[14:41] what
[14:44] there's no way you can't even stand up
[14:49] things were working Abraham didn't see
[14:51] it Sarah didn't see it but things were
[14:53] changing
[14:54] okay
[14:56] I'll move by faith we understand that
[15:00] the entire universe was formed at God's
[15:04] command
[15:06] that what we now see
[15:09] did not come from anything that can be
[15:12] seen
[15:14] First Peter 1 8.
[15:16] whom have not seen
[15:19] ye love
[15:23] we haven't seen Jesus but we love him
[15:31] we have a city but we sure do love him
[15:34] whom have I not seen ye love
[15:37] in whom though ye now see
[15:39] even whom though though now ye see him
[15:42] not yet believing
[15:45] well we don't see him but we believe him
[15:49] yet Rejoice with joy unspeakable and
[15:52] full of Glory
[15:55] receiving the end of your faith even the
[15:58] salvation of your souls
[16:07] verse 12 unto whom it was revealed that
[16:10] not unto themselves but unto us
[16:15] they did minister to things which are
[16:18] now reported unto you by them that have
[16:21] preached the gospel unto you with the
[16:23] Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which
[16:25] thinks Angels declare Angels desire to
[16:29] look upon
[16:33] Faith cometh by hearing
[16:35] because Jesus says behold I stay at the
[16:37] door and knock are you going to open if
[16:39] you hear the knock open the door let him
[16:42] in
[16:43] you know when Jesus spoke he spoke in
[16:45] parables
[16:48] you know solar went forth to sew some
[16:51] fell on good ground some fell on Stony
[16:52] ground some fell on
[16:54] people like what is he even saying
[16:58] Jesus did that for a reason
[17:03] because disciple says why speakeas thou
[17:05] impair down to the in Parables he
[17:06] answered because it's given to you to
[17:09] know the mysteries of the Kingdom but to
[17:11] them it's not given
[17:15] everybody could read this Bible
[17:19] but there are things only the bride can
[17:21] see
[17:22] only the predestinated special people
[17:26] we're a special people
[17:29] can see what God is saying because
[17:31] blessed are your eyes
[17:35] for they see
[17:41] the Jesus said whosoever hath to him
[17:43] shall be given he shall have more
[17:44] abundance but whosoever hath not from
[17:46] him shall be taken away even that he
[17:49] hath
[17:50] so therefore speak out to them in
[17:52] Parables because they see and see and
[17:53] not and hear and they hear not
[17:55] so neither do they understand
[18:00] but Jesus again says blessed are your
[18:03] eyes or is that blessed word again
[18:04] supremely blessed
[18:07] because blessed are your eyes
[18:10] for they see and your ears for they hear
[18:17] for verily I say unto you that many
[18:20] prophets and righteous men have desired
[18:22] to see those things which you see
[18:26] they've read these same scriptures for
[18:28] years
[18:29] but couldn't understand
[18:32] what's he saying
[18:35] what's he mean he's going to have a
[18:36] church in the last days what is what is
[18:39] it Church ages you go ahead in the world
[18:41] you start talking to them they'll say
[18:42] what's a church hey what do you mean
[18:44] Church ages
[18:46] I think there's seven churches that was
[18:47] in The Book of Revelations
[18:51] they just don't know they just look at
[18:52] you like
[18:54] what is he even saying well like
[18:56] somebody probably doing me this morning
[18:57] what's he even saying
[18:59] where's he getting at
[19:01] I wonder that sometimes myself
[19:05] wow how much time I got who
[19:09] let's hurry through this one
[19:13] their special privilege that we receive
[19:14] because we're able to see and hear
[19:17] because Revelation 2 7 he that hath an
[19:19] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[19:22] unto the churches to him that overcometh
[19:24] will I give
[19:26] to eat of the Tree of Life
[19:29] the tree of life was still in the
[19:30] paradise says Jesus Christ we all know
[19:32] that
[19:32] it never left
[19:34] we all enjoy the benefits of it we're
[19:36] eating from that tree right now oh the
[19:38] word to him that overcometh overcometh
[19:41] means to Prevail to get the victory to
[19:44] carry off in Victory
[19:46] to win the case
[19:49] to him to overcometh you won the case
[19:50] I'll give you the Tree of Life
[19:54] because Jesus says behold the hour
[19:55] cometh yea is now come that ye shall be
[19:57] scattered every man to his own and ye
[19:59] shall leave me alone and yet I am not
[20:01] alone because the father is with me
[20:02] these things have I spoken unto you that
[20:05] in me ye might have peace in the world
[20:08] ye shall have tribulation but be of good
[20:10] cheer
[20:11] I have overcome the world
[20:15] ye are of God little children I have
[20:17] overcome them because greater is he that
[20:20] is in you than he that's in the world
[20:24] that was the Ephesian Church age you eat
[20:27] from the Tree of Life
[20:28] in the Smyrna Church he that hath that
[20:31] ear notice how he starts this every
[20:33] Church age he that hath an ear let him
[20:36] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[20:38] churches
[20:39] and to he that overcometh shall not hurt
[20:42] of the second death
[20:44] God will she we shall Escape hell
[20:50] did you notice that brother said this he
[20:52] said to every Church age they got their
[20:54] their reward
[20:56] but the next Church age got not only got
[20:58] thirds but got the one previous
[21:03] so so smyrnia they're going to escape
[21:05] hell and they get to eat from the Tree
[21:07] of Life
[21:10] pergamus he that hath an ear let him
[21:12] hear what the spirit said to the
[21:15] churches to him that overcometh will I
[21:17] give to eat of the Hidden manna
[21:22] we can keep going a special revelation
[21:25] and will give him a white stone
[21:30] White I love this
[21:34] I'll skip some of it in the ancient
[21:36] courts of Justice
[21:38] the accused were condemned by black
[21:40] Pebbles
[21:41] but the acquitted by white ones
[21:46] as though you never done it here's your
[21:49] white stone
[21:51] Hallelujah
[21:54] thyterra he that overcometh and keepeth
[21:56] my works and to him to the end I will
[21:58] give Power Over All Nations
