TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and write it on our hearts. Lord, I pray that you'd help bring bring it forth clearly and that it would be uh not just uh teaching to our minds, but Lord, revelation to our hearts that it would it would be quickened to us. Lord, we we look to you. We commit ourselves to you. We ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. God bless you. So, this is part four. Obviously, you've missed three parts if you're a visitor, but uh and I'm I just there's no way to go go back and summarize. I'd spend 25 minutes summarizing everything up to this point. So, I'm just going to hit it. And if you're confused, God bless you. So, what is marriage? All right. It's a covenant relationship designed by God himself. God created it. He created the people that were a part of it, right? And he gave them their purposes and functions. So they're two separate people with distinct purposes, distinct functions, but becoming one unit. The the the two separate, the man and the woman, they complete each other. The man does things that the woman can't do and the woman does things that the man can't do. God has designed it that way. He's purposed it that way. He doesn't want us to change that at all. He wants us to stay in the channel uh that he's ordained for us. And again, it marriage is a covenant between three people. A man and a woman and God. Amen. And and this is God's purpose. This is God's function. And this this relationship permeates all of creation. It doesn't matter if you're a pagan. It's it's there and you'll answer for it. Regardless of if you have the Bible or not, you will answer for what God has placed within creation. Even pagan countries and cultures and places that are, you know, they're still in the stone age, they themselves understand that a woman has a certain function and a man has a certain function. It's not until us educated idiots of the west have attacked and perverted the very uh uh functions of nature that God has created that we go contrary to that nature. But it's very obvious. It's very plain and it's and and and we'll just leave it at that. God being the creator of marriage, God being the center of that covenant of marriage and his purpose for marriage. Uh first Corinthians chapter 7 1. Now I just want to say as as we go into it, if you've studied 1 Corinthians 7, Paul says some very interesting and strange things regarding marriage. And when I say that, just go read it. You'll find you'll understand that. But in verse 26 he gives the he gives the explanation of why he's saying what he's saying about singleness and not getting married etc. And it's he says because of the present distress. So the situation that they were facing then in Corinth the Christians were facing in Corinth Paul was encouraging not to get married. Then you turn around in 1 Timothy chapter 5, he writes to Timothy and he says teach the younger women to get married. So understand so that what there's a there's a normal function of life and in the world and then there there is this place where there's a present distress that Paul is advising them just stay as you are because of the present distress. So Paul writes 1 Corinthians 7:1. Now concerning the things whereof you wrote unto me, "It is good for a man not to touch a woman. Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband." And so just to speak plainly, you understand that there is a a covenant oneness that takes place between a husband and wife. At the center of that marriage, Paul is saying, "You do this in order to avoid fornication." However, we also understand at from the very beginning, God created them before the fall. He said, "For them, man and woman, to multiply and fill up the earth." So God's purpose for multiplication stands before the fall. And yet we understand because of the fall, Paul says, "Don't stay single. get married in order to avoid because this is a natural function that every human being has. God has placed it within us so that the human race will continue on that we have this desire and there is a proper place for the desire to be expressed. So what is a covenant marriage? What is the what is functioning as the covenant marriage is at the center of it is a sexual relationship. At the center of a family is a sexual relationship. That's that's part of it. That's part of the function. And if if we try to be so spiritual above above and beyond that, we kind of are missing even what now again in our in our uh post-puritan viewpoint of things to talk plainly like that makes everybody's cheeks turn a little red, including my own. But it's a fact. It's biblical truth. And we don't want to avoid what the word says. We want to face it directly. Paul says to avoid fornication, get married. Why? Because you're going to be tempted. A woman is going to be tempted to receive think she's going to receive love through allowing that act. A man is going to seek after love through that through that act. And so this is just the natural function of of mankind. And God wants us to be able to express it. But the place it is supposed to be expressed is in the center of a covenant relationship between God and a man and a woman. That's the place for it to be expressed. Anything outside of that is perversion. Anything outside of that is sinful and wicked. 1 Corinthians 11:7. For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man. For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man. Neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man. Order, the order of creation. Obviously, Adam was first formed. Then from Adam was taken out a rib and was created Eve. She was made for him for what purpose? To be his helper in the vision that go see God gave Adam a pre-existing vision for his life and direction for his life. But then Adam couldn't fulfill the function on his own. Right? So God took from Adam and made his helper. What is it? What is that helper? That helper completes what he couldn't do. He couldn't multiply himself, right? It took Eve, the mother of all living to be able to multiply. All right. Secondarily is God has a greater purpose which is the expression of himself. I shouldn't say secondarily, primarily, God has a purpose to express himself. And in order to do that, he couldn't make just a man, right? It's not good for a man to be alone, right? The the only thing in all of creation that wasn't good was the man be being alone. Everything else was very good, but the man being alone was not good. And so what did he do? He made for Adam from him a help meat. And what was this to do? The man was the glory of God and the woman the glory of man. So the woman reflects the man, the man reflects God. All of it, both man and woman together completes the image of God. It's the same thing in type. Christ and the bride. Christ is the direct reflection of God himself. When you see Christ, you're seeing God, right? But the picture is not complete with just Christ. Sounds like a strange thing to say, but that's the truth. Otherwise, why would he ma take out from Christ from the elements of Christ to make for Christ a bride? Because that in that the fullness of God is expressed into Christ to the bride. Amen. And so the the the the primary role is expression, but the secondary role becomes what? the multiplication of life, right? And so God's purpose in creating a man and woman is at the center of that, the multiplication of life. And as I said at the beginning, different different you can't take a man and try to make him fulfill the role of a woman, right? Because when you do that, the Bible says that's effeminite, right? And the epheminite can't go to heaven. That's what scripture says. The effeminate will not inherit the kingdom of God. So God wants the man to express a masculine life and he wants the woman to express a feminine life. No matter how much these insane uh alphabet people want to say that a man can have a baby, she could never have a baby. He can never have a baby. It's impossible. I just love it when people walk in right when I say stuff like that. It's just awesome. Come to come to church earlier, y'all. I sound like a a mad man. I guess they already know that. So, but the the the the reality is a man can't become a woman, a woman can't become a man. There's separate expression. There's separate manifestations. God wants it to stay that way. God loves it that way. God delights it that way. And the two complete each other. All right. So now I want to show you that daughters actually in the two different functions daughters actually don't marry. Did you know that? Psalms 78, I'll explain that in a minute. 7863. The fire consumed their young men and their maidens were not given to marriage. All right. So this this is we see this terminology given to marriage. Matthew 22:30 for in the resurrection neither they neither marry nor are they given nor are given in marriage but are as the angels of God in heaven. Matthew 24:38. For as in the days that were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered in the ark. Strange. Why we keep seeing this? Marrying and giving in marriage. Luke 17:27 that did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. 1 Corinthians 7:38. So then, he that giveth her in marriage doeth well, but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better. As we talked about before, verse 26 in 1 Corinthians 7 explains this to us. He's saying this because of the present distress. All right? But my point in showing this verse isn't that isn't that it's once again to say, "He that giveth her in marriage doeth well." So we see that daughters don't marry right sons marry daughters are given in marriage right and so this is an important point to make and we see this actually all through the bible that daughters are given in marriage right so the so sons are the ones that have to take the risk step out make make the statement right and daughters have to be given. So someone is giving the daughter away. Of course, we understand if you think about a marriage uh ceremony, it speaks about this, but that's about all the further thought we give very often that it's just some formality that the preacher says that's based on some bygone era. But I want to suggest to you that it actually isn't. Many things that we do today, we've abandoned simple biblical truth to the point that we don't even know what someone's talking about when they talk about the truth. Even in the message, we've done the same thing. We've departed from simple biblical instruction and biblical knowledge to the point where, you know, I've spoke about this before. When I first started speaking plainly about the roles of men and women and husbands and wives, every church I went to to preach about it, it was like there was a spirit trying to knock my head off. And you could see people are just visibly uncomfortable because feminism has so penetrated into our minds and perverted us. And even the modern system of casual dating, though that hasn't fully uh uh come into the message, we have a slippery slope that we're going on. And again, we we can we can talk about why that is happening or or where that's coming from, but it's the simple truth that we need to be people need to be taught. It's not enough to just say, "Hey, you be led by the Holy Spirit." That's fantastic. The Holy Spirit sets teachers in the church. Amen. To teach the church to help to give them instruction. And you know, older people, you've come to the message. You received the truth. But there's younger people that need to be instructed. They need to be introduced to the message. We can't just assume the message upon our children. We have to we have to teach them. We have to instruct them. That's the that's the job of fathers. You say, "My pastor has to do it." You are the dad. You're the husband. It's your responsibility to do that. That's that should be something we are teaching our sons from the very beginning because you're doing it yourself. So your son knows one day I will lead a family. One day I will teach a family. One day I will instruct a family to understand the message because ultimately we can't lay it off onto the pastor or the ministry at the church. Ultimately, the Bible tells fathers to teach their children, to instruct their children. And so, if if that fails to happen, we c as as men, we can't point the finger at someone else and ask them to do it. We must do it. We must instruct. And we must instruct what we want in within our families. And that's why I say when when I'm when I'm going into this, I'm about to go into Numbers chapter 30. And I want I want I want you to look at this not as maybe it's something new in in in your mind. If you've been through all the Sunday schools before or you listen to my podcast, it wouldn't be new at all. But it might be new in your mind. But the reality is from the time our k our daughters are little, they should understand that they are to be given in marriage. And that doesn't mean just at the altar when the pastor asked you. That's just a formal expression of what should have been happening all along. It's not for our daughters to make up their own minds on their own without the authority and the instruction of their father regarding their love lives and their future. Amen. Numbers chapter 30 verse one. And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, this is the thing which the Lord hath commanded. Now again, this is this is what our modern world and modern society will say. This is just for Israel. This isn't for Christians. This is Old Testament. We're in the New Testament now. There's no greater sign of spiritual idiocy than that statement. that if someone says that to you, you can really bet in immediately that they are not believers in God's word. You can make that assumption very well. So when I say this, I'm saying I'm saying this just to beat the devil to the punch, which is that this is a principle of headship. When we find Paul saying the husband is the head of the wife in America, in American churches, in Western churches, headship means little more than just just a word that exists, but with no authority behind it. So this this what I'm about to read to me as I see this, this is the expression of what headship actually is. This is the thing which the Lord commanded. If a man bow unto the Lord or an oath to his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word, he shall do according all that proceeded out of his mouth. If a woman also bow a vow unto the Lord and bind herself by a bond being in her father's house in her youth and her father hear her vow and her bond wherewith she have bound her soul and her father shall hold his peace at her then all her vows shall stand and every bond where she bound her soul shall stand. So the scriptur is giving the f the father the final authority. If if the daughter makes a promise again this is about a vow unto the Lord. So if a father can break a daughter's vow to the Lord, how much more can he break break her vow natural vow, right? And so if even if he says nothing, that's his that's the decision, right? He's even if he voids himself of his responsibility of deciding, he's decided anyways, right? Numbers 30:5 But if her father disallow her in the day that he not any of her vows or of her bonds where she had bound her soul shall stand and the Lord shall forgive her because her father disallowed her. And if she had an allen husband when she bowed or uttered out of her lips wherewith she bound her soul and her husband heard it and held his peace at her in the day that she that he heard it, then her vow shall stand and her bonds she bound, her soul shall stand. But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it, then he shall make make her vow which he bowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul of none effect, and the Lord shall forgive her. But every vow of a widow and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls shall stand against her. Right? So headship speaks of being a decision maker. Even if you even if you hold your peace, even if you don't lead, even if you refuse to do it, God will actually ultimately hold you responsible and accountable for what goes on in your in your family. And so the point of all of this is fathers are supposed to be involved with all their children. with their wife. They're supposed to understand not none of this should be a shock or surprise because he's involved. He's inspecting his family. He's communicating with his family. He understands it's his responsibility to do good unto them. So again, as we read, a husband and a father can invalidate any decision his wife or daughter makes. And the other part of it is in America, we have some strange intermediate state. My daughter turns 18 now. She's suddenly responsible for herself. She's outside of my headship. She's an adult. She can do what she wants to. Well, that's based on American law. But as Christians, we don't live by American law. We live by the word of God. And and so in the in the biblical way of doing things, there's no intermediate state between a father and a husband. It's under the headship of your father. And then when when the time comes and you've you are given in marriage through the process of courtship, engagement, marriage, once once your father gives you and that you stand before God's people and before God and you're joined together in a covenant, headship passes from the father to the husband. Right? There's a passing There's a passing of the of the torch. there's a passing of of that headship of the daughter. So a woman is to be under headship as we saw in the scripture. The only intermediate state is when she is a widow, right? If she's a widow, she makes her own decisions before the Lord and she's held accountable to them. But outside of that, a daughter or a woman is either under the headship of her father and then passed to being under the headship of her husband. And so when we talk about being given in marriage, that's the process. We haven't gone into detail in the process. We'll do that the next time. And we're just at the time to quit. So let's stand. We'll take a five minute break and then service will start. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for your word. We pray, Lord, that you'd write it on our hearts. As we look at this, Lord, may we each as individual believers, not just hear a word and and pass from one ear out the other, but may we take it if it's something new that we've heard. May we take the scriptures, may we study them, may we study the message, Lord, and and come to the revelation in our own hearts. And I pray Lord the bless of us the service that you be glorified in our midst Lord. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
