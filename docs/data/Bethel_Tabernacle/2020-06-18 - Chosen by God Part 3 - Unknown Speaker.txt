come to you you called us you filled us with your spirit and your working Lord to change us and transform us by the renewing of our mind as we feast upon the word so Lord let it be in us tonight may we lay aside the distractions of life and the things of life and may we enter into the word which is changing us Lord we love you we need not just mic mechanics though we need it but we need the dynamics to come upon the word Lord as we heard such a incredible message on Sunday that if we just even just intellectually believe it that's good but the mic the dynamics need to come Lord and so if any are in that condition we ask the dynamics would come upon them even now that they might have the power to walk in newness of life so Lord we just want to step out of the way and ask you to work tonight we ask these things in Jesus name Amen so our just want to welcome our visitors again brother Tim and sister Kay Calhoun got to spend some time with them this week and sure appreciated it and really really good to know you so don't be strangers come on back so we're gonna look in the scriptures we're gonna continue on the series of chosen by God and we're gonna look at Ephesians 1 verse 11 and tonight we're gonna buckle up everybody we're gonna be going through a ton of scriptures again so in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will may the Lord had the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated so God God doesn't merely make a plan and then the universe just follows in suit without him things - what for the perp for his purpose after the counsel of his own will where it says their work if it's the Greek word energy ale and it means to be active to be efficient so God is actively working he's efficiently working in his creation amongst his children what's the whole universe how abouts every atom amongst every molecule to accomplish his own will he says I'm muted I'm not muted so I'm just gonna turn it off rebooting is always good alright anything fails just reboot it so God is applying his energy his activity into accomplishing his purpose in the universe the word there where it says purpose is prothesis in Greek and it means a setting forth or an intended proposal in other words it speaks of a planned intent God's purpose is not generic there's a specific targeted planned intent that he has in in your life in every circumstance in your life and so he is putting his energy towards his plan which is accomplishing what your will his creations will know his own will and so we have to look at that and see that that God's plan in the earth it isn't based upon what you and I do it is him responding to us it's us responding to him and so it isn't us choosing and then God saying I ordained that choice it's God making a plan an intended plan that he is going to work out an accomplished on the earth so and he's putting his energy his power towards accomplish accomplishing that purpose so election predestination you know we use those words but we get many many times just use them and don't understand what we're talking about the election looks back to his foreknowledge foreknowledge is not just knowing what's going to happen it's planning and accomplishing a specific intended purpose so his foreknowledge is for ordination is really what it's speaking about not merely knowing what could happen we talked about before the difference between Calvinism and Arminianism both of them believe in predestination I know modern-day Baptists and charismatic Pentecostal will tell you they don't believe in predestination any church that believes says something like that pastor says something like that run from them as far as fast as you can because they're confessing they don't even believe the Bible that's dangerous our minion ism says God's choice is based upon your choice only so God sees what you chose and therefore ordains that to be so versus the Calvinist side says God works all things after the counsel of his own will God plans and purposes everything you coming to him is his work drawing you to himself he didn't look forward and say oh you chose me I'm gonna choose you in fact the Bible says the opposite the Bible says you haven't chosen me I have chosen you and ordained you to bring forth fruit so it's got our coming to christ is not based upon our choice it's based upon his choice before the world ever began and we'll look at that more clearly and establish it much more much more than what we have there in the sermon the rapture or the Branham says this now so you were in if you've got eternal life you were in God before there ever was a world you're a part a son of God an attribute of God he knowed the very age you were coming he predestinated you to that age to take that place and no one else can take it don't care how many impersonators and things you've got to be there because he knew you would be there now you are made manifest now you can fellowship with him and that's what he wants so it even really goes far beyond the fact that he chose us scripturally he chose us that's communicating to us in terms that we understand the fact is we are a part of his life a part of his attributes God is God is who he is he never changes he can't have a new thought if God has a new thought he's changed so God never has a new thought he never has a new attribute he is does not change so you were actually in him for eternity you and it was in him to manifest those attributes so you had to be had come come and be predestinated to a new body to a new purpose you it's not as though he said he looked around the world and said you know there's just a following bunch of people that happened and I'm just gonna grab this one that's not what God's plan and purpose was he is manifesting his own life his own attributes so you were in him before there ever was a creation not even just before it eternally if you have eternal life you never had a beginning and you'll never have heavy end the essential you who you are in the soul your flash out of beginning your even your spirit man had a beginning but that that gene of God which is in the soul never had a beginning never has an end it was a part of his thoughts and his thoughts are eternal John 3:16 for God so loved the world and I'm repeating some things and that's because I'm trying to repeat it so you remember it for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life this is what all my armenian and friends and college would argue with me it says whosoever will absolutely whosoever will who is whosoever will acts 13:48 and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed so who believes who is the whosoever will that believes in jesus christ the ones were ordained to eternal life and no one else exodus 33:19 and he said i will make all my goodness pass before thee and i will proclaim the name of the lord before thee and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy isn't it interesting this is Moses saying I want to see I want to see you I want to say I want to see you and God says I will manifest myself to you I will reveal myself to you but I'm gonna do it on my choosing I'm gonna do it in my way I'm not doing it just because you asked I'm doing it because I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy what does that have to do with anything he's gonna manifest himself to those whom he's chosen to manifest himself too and we'll see that more clearly as we look at the words of Jesus in John so we'll look at that right away John 17 verse 6 I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gave us them me and they have kept thy word manifest is named everybody only the ones that he chose to have mercy and to be gracious to and here it says the men which thou gavest me I manifested your name what is what does that mean manifested your name it was the very presence of Almighty God on display before the people that's the name of God God placed his name in his son Jesus Christ but it's more than just a word a name it's a living presence it's it's a living reality they're manifested before the people the same can be applied to the bit to today when the Son of Man is revealed to us he was manifested to the one the men and women that were given to him out of the world it's not manifested it's not for everyone it's only those ones that God said I want mercy on whom I will have mercy Ephesians 2:10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them isn't that astounding even the good works that we do we can't claim that to be the originators of him we can't claim to be the offered author of them God Himself is actually the author of even your good works so the reality is you can't you can't do good works in yourself humanly speaking you can do good but that's not what God is talking about good works is his work his the only thing that he is qualified is the righteousness of God you say I'm a good person got nothing to do with it I know there's many good people has nothing to do with that God does not accept good people because there the fact is there isn't any there's no good there's no one good no not one there's none that seeks after God so it's it's him calling him drawing him even ordaining your good works that we should walk that we should walk in them what are you walking in today what works are you walking in today I hope God's works amen if it's God's works it's his righteousness being revealed through you Genesis 18 verse 19 for I know him that he will command his children in his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him that is God working other according to the purpose of his own will he says I know Abraham how did he know any bruh ham because Abraham was one of his attributes being manifested on this plate and part of that attribute was he's gonna teach he's gonna teach his children I know I know that he's gonna pass the truth on to his children and to his household after him and in doing that God will bring everything that was spoken of Abraham upon him 1st Corinthians 1:26 through 28 for you see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called ouch what are you saying about me Paul can't can't I want him to say some nicer things but if you see after the flesh that's the truth not many mighty not many noble are called the nobility the big rich people you know don't have need for God got everything in this life but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty did you ever think about this verse that probably in their lifetime none of those rich people were really confounded or confused but there's coming a day at the judgment they're gonna be confounded and confused confused why because the very people standing in front of them to judge them are the ones that they considered Retton refuse garbage and filth and here they are gonna be standing in fine linen clean and white judging them according to their works astounding he'll do God is gonna do it he's gonna confound him that promise might not have come to pass in those people's lifetime and it may not come to pass in our own lifetime but it's going to come to pass Abraham did not receive a city or an inheritance in his lifetime but he's going to still hasn't received it in fact but he's going to and base things of the world and things which are despised has God chosen yea and things which are not to bring to nothing things that are isn't God's choosing incredible we look at it and wonder at ourselves and say what what there's nothing about me yeah that's why God chose you because he's gonna use you to confound the mighty and the noble and the wise men so it's not it's not a wonder that we look at ourselves and say we're not a big deal exactly exactly that's what God that's how God works that's what he does he said that's what he chose so don't be confused about it just rejoice Deuteronomy 7 7 and 8 the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for you were the fewest of all people but because the Lord loved you isn't that incredible he doesn't really explain why he loved them he said I didn't chose I didn't choose you based upon who you were what you look like or what position you had I mean if God was gonna do it as man does it he would have chosen the Egyptians and my he would have written could have revealed himself and taken over the whole world and the Millennium would have been right on that's not God's Way God doesn't do work that way he wants to receive glory unto himself that's why he chooses people like you and me to reveal himself through but because the Lord loved you well why did he love me because he did I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy I will love who all I love it's his choice it's his choosing it's his plan it's his purpose but because the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your father's why did God choose you he chose you because of himself isn't that it's astounding so when you think about the the big picture of your life God chose you God gave you his spirit God is working in you for what for what purpose because he's centered on you not really he's centered on himself God is looking to accomplish his own will his own purpose his own glory and because of that he's gonna make sure that you come to the end in holiness and righteousness with a new body because he'd keep the oath which he had sworn unto your father's hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of the bond of a bondman from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt he did it because he chose to do it he wanted to manifest himself even hardened Pharaoh's heart so that he could be sure that he received full glory for what happened James 2 verse 5 hearken my beloved brethren hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he had promised to them that love him you see our thinking many times is so wrong we look at God's blessings and we think about finance cars houses bank accounts stock market but that's not God's value rich in faith not rich and stuff your approval your blessing from God has nothing to do with your financial standing what your position you are in this world whether you get ahead or whether you don't get ahead God's value upon you is because he chose you and he's working in your life and he chose you rich in faith and that matters more than anything else in this world the world tries to tell us something else the world tries to force us into some box based upon what position life we're at where we live what culture were under but we don't have to be limited by that let your faith swing out to the Word of God in the place that he wants to have you in yeah he took chose the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he had promised to them that love him Matthew 2:1 21 and she shall bring forth I was just looking at these verses and I want you to think about especially in this verse is who did Jesus come to save who did he die for and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save who his people from their sins Christ died for his people the Bible says in another place that he died for the sins of the whole world so why do we have the tension between these two verses what world is he talking about you're not of the world so that mean he didn't die for us no he's talking about a different world he's talking about the other another Kingdom another people not that not the whole people of the earth he definitely died for those that were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world familiar verse Matthew 22:14 for many are called but few are chosen the word goes forth to many though the truth is preached to many but few are chosen to hear and receive it John 10 26 through 29 but ye believe not because you are not of my sheep as I said unto you why don't they believe why don't they accept Jesus why can't they hear the truth because they're not of his sheep verse 27 my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me so his sheep hear his voice but the other sheep they don't hear it they can't receive it they're not ordained to receive it verse 28 and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand I and my father are one aren't you glad Jesus and the father are one in what are they one in we usually take this to the doctrine of the Godhead and that's absolutely applicable but this verse actually is speaking about their oneness in the fact that he will keep us to the end will never perish and no one will pluck us out of his hand does that can you pluck yourself out of his hand no one can not even you can pluck yourself out of his hand no one can take you away from Jesus Christ no devil in hell not yourself not your family not false believers not demonic governments which is every government so who who can really separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord no one no one John 17 - as thou has given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many to everyone know to as many as thou has given him so eternal life goes to the ones that God gave to Christ were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world were a part of his life he's given us eternal life those ones that the father gave to him second Timothy to verse 10 therefore I endure all things for the elects sake that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory so Paul there as a minister understands that he can do he can go through everything every trial every difficulty every beating he can take all of that imprisonment for the elects sake because you know there's a there's Pete there's predestinated seed out there that are going to hear what if it was an Arminian gospel Paul would say I you know I'm perfecting my preaching style so that more people will listen we're getting a better worship program so that more people will hear we're me we're putting a coffee shop in the lobby so that we can draw a bigger crowd we're putting our song leader brother Brad we're getting them in a leather jacket leather coat and some skinny jeans so I can appeal to the young people that's what they're different that's what the world is doing that's what they're doing I can do they're saying I'll do all these things because we don't know who's gonna respond anybody could respond and it's based on our efforts you know how well we do it that causes the people to respond to Jesus Christ but Paul was the opposite he said I'll go I'll go to hell itself preaching the gospel because I know on my way on my way there there's people are gonna listen I'll go to the gates of Hell and preach that because people the elect will hear I mean how how terrible would it be you know for her for a missionary to go thinking it was based upon his own efforts its proclaiming the word you can endure the hard things for the sake of lect why because he's chosen them they will hear if he's sending you he scented you for a purpose someone's going to hear so let's look at Romans chapter 9 if you want to I able to pull that up brother Romans chapter 9 verse 10 and we're gonna go through verse by verse verse 10 and not only this but when Rebekah had also conceived by one even by our Father Isaac verse 11 for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth now I want you to I want to look at this verse more deeply because in the Armenian understanding that God is basing his choice upon our choice we look here Paul is emphasizing the children not being yet born they weren't even born not not only they weren't even born but they haven't done any good or evil so God is not choosing them based upon what good or evil he knows that he's planned that Jacob and Esau will do he is choosing them simply according to election he's saying that he's making this choice that the purpose of God according to election might stand and then so that we're not confused he adds it even further and says not of works but of him that calleth so that God the sort says might stand speaks there in the Greek of to stay in a given place state or relationship of expectancy so in other words he wants his purpose of election to be made clear he wants it to be he wants it to be so that we understand you know those things that happened back then it was for that purpose then but it was also as an example to us so Paul could take it and show us the true doctrine of election now it shouldn't be any confusion now we don't have to misunderstand what's being said it's God's purpose of election not so man's free will might stand you hear so much in in theological debates people exalting man's free will we have to have free will we got you know man has free will what about God's free will does anybody care about that does anybody concerned about God accomplishing his purpose now people people make a god after their own imagination that's what they do and they you know they they make God in their own image the God that people are serving is extremely human no that's not how it works the God who declares who he is became human he wasn't a human God created by man in our image he has got alone he is perfect he is wise he's all-wise he's completely holy he's totally different than you and I his free will will stand our free will has to bow in worship before him so in order that God's purpose of election might stand verse 12 it was said unto her Rebekah the elder shall serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated God chose Jacob before he was born before he did anything God chose to hate Esau before he had done any good or any evil verse 14 what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God god forbid for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth mercy I think I mentioned this before but I'll repeat it if God people say it's not fair that God chooses to have mercy on some and chooses not to have mercy on others it's a funny statement in my mind and it's full of human emotion but lacking desperately in any logic whatsoever if God is fair would we be talking about mercy in the first place mercy by definition means that he is overriding justice he's overriding fairness if God was fair all sinners would be sent to the lake of fire God is fair God is just but because of his plan salvation because of the fact that he is a savior he chooses to have mercy on some that that's his choice mercy is by definition not fair mercy He has given as a pardon and saying it would be fair for me to condemn you to hell but because I love you I'm having mercy upon you it's not of him that willeth you know if it was us if it was God's looking and saying you know brother Tim Calhoun he's a great guy I see he's really nice he's really kind to people and therefore I choose him to eternal life that would be a reward right that would be a reward for good behavior but manat it's not a reward it's grace its grace and you know you know it talks about that in Romans chapter 4 with Abraham will evil turn there yeah verse one what shall we say then that Abraham our Father as pertaining to the flesh hath found or if Abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory but not before God for what saith the scripture abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt but to him that worketh not believed but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness it it's not a debt salvation is not a debt that God owes to us salvation is mercy if it was a debt and it was by works then we would have a reason to boast but we don't we don't we all know that we don't have a reason to boast and and very very basic rules of Justice means if a person is a good person but commits a murder you're not trying him for being a good person and murder you're trying him for murder that's it and so when we break God's laws which the fact is we do every day we still do every day we are worthy of the punishment that God set forth which was in the beginning death but God pardons us but God gives us mercy so back to Roman's 916 which we read I'm gonna read a quote before we go to verse 17 from who is this Melchizedek brother branham says and remember you your eyes your stature whatever you was you're in his thinking at the beginning and the only thing that you are is the expression word after he thought he spoke it and here you are if it isn't if he wasn't in his thinking there's no way at all for you to ever be there for he is the one that give its eternal life you remember how we read the scriptures not him that willeth or him that runneth but God and that his predestination might stand true he could choose before any time who God is sovereign in his choosing did you know that God is sovereign alright then on to verse 17 for the scripture saith unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardens so really both sides are predestinated double what they call it double predestination or double the election both sides he's chosen some to receive mercy he's chosen some many most to receive condemnation now we'll say verse 19 now will say unto me wide I think yet find fault for who has resisted his will nay but o man who art thou that repliest against God shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus hath not the Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to discretion destruction and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had a for prepared unto glory so God ordains vessels of Wrath and he ordains vessels of mercy why does he do that because he's willing to do it that's what it says God willing to show his wrath it's God's purpose to reveal the nature the attribute that he has of Wrath it's also God's purpose to reveal the nature that he has of mercy and we have to have we have the to juxtapose against one another because one reveals the other without wrath we don't understand mercy without wrath we don't understand love these both of these things have to be there for us to really know who God is and what he's done for us otherwise his purpose to reveal himself as a savior is almost meaningless it's not understandable we spoke about this earlier but I'm gonna read the quote now the eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God eternal this is from the church ages book if you can see this you will see many things God is unchangeable in both essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his abilities so therefore he must he as God must be omniscient if he's omniscient then he's not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge than he's not omniscient the best we could say that it that is that some time he will be but that is not scriptural he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he's God thus the thoughts of God are eternal they are real they're not simply like a man with the blueprint he has drawn up in which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal and part of God what a beautiful beautiful statement John 6:44 no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day that always amazes me he starts that sentence was such a really a negative thought no man can come to me take that in for a minute we roll that roll over that - unless they drop unless we're drawn but what about the hopelessness of that first statement no man can come to me you in your ability you you and your choosing you and your desires would not come to him you wouldn't desire him you it's it's our nature that were born with - not like God to hate God you say well I was predestinated see that was in his mind the scripture in Romans three read through Romans three is very clear we we don't by nature born in this world love God we by nature reject him turn from him run from him it disobey him at every chance that we possibly can we are born rebels but it takes this what is it what's the exception how can people come to him the father which I sent me draw him said it before but I'll repeat it again this word in the Greek literally means to drag it's not just come here and we say okay it's grab you by the ear and say I'm dragging you I'm opening your heart and your mind so you can do nothing else all you can do is hear and receive this word so if the father doesn't drag us to Christ we won't come to him we won't it has to be him exerting his grace upon us John 15 verse 16 you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name he may give it so beautiful.i we didn't choose him wasn't our choosing wasn't our desire it was his choice of us just look at how Jesus brought his disciples to himself were they running to sign up with him no one was running to sign up with Jesus did he just put a sign up and everyone came he went to them and in one way or another he manifested himself to them and when he said follow me it was like I couldn't do anything else how do something else from what I what you've shown me how can I do how can I do anything other and even when he tried to send him away in John 6 which we read he he told the people unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you everybody was equally confused and when they asked him they tried to clarify that by saying well our fathers ate manna in the wilderness and so we know this is a parable that you're just telling it you know like it's like a spiritual thing and Jesus says very truly truly I say to you unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life into you in other words he's saying no I'm not gonna explain a thing to you and he comes to everybody leaves him he comes to his twelve and he says will you go you want to go to there's the door everybody you're welcome to walk through it and Peter the spokesmen rise up it says who - who would we go he didn't say where would we go isn't that beautiful - whoo it's a person he's a person that we're following it's the same today he's a person that we're following to whom would we go you and you alone have the words of eternal life they didn't have the explanation of it he didn't come and bring him us like other times where he come and explain the parable to him this time he didn't explain it he just said you want to go they said who would we go to why he were the heat they were the ones that he manifested his name unto because the father gave them to him and even one of them was a devil Jesus said let's look at Jude chapter 1 and verse 4 for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ so what did it start with started with the fact that they were ordained to condemnation they were ordained to be condemned so as a result of being ordained to be condemned when they were confront they're confronted with the word what do they do well some people look like they're receiving it because it says that these people crept in unawares they came in they looked like they were fish they looked like they were good fish they weren't good fish remember the parable of the wheat and the tares let them grow together until the harvest so they crept in unawares what are they what do they do with the Word of God they turn it into lasciviousness they turned god's grenade they take God's grace and they make it what a disgrace they take God's grace and they say we can do anything we want to and that's true but what is the anything you want to its live like the world then you don't have the Holy Ghost it's look the whole if you have the Holy Ghost you do whatever you want to and it reflects the righteousness of God and so these people they take the word and they pervert it into a license to do whatever sinful behavior that they want to what hour are we living in Laodicea there's the there's the true church and the false church false church puts him out kicks him out they're rich increased in goods and have need of nothing but don't know they're poor blind and naked and and they don't it says denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ but it says they're a part of the church so ultimately by their lifestyle by the life that they're leading what are they doing denying God denying Jesus Christ it's not that they say Jesus isn't Lord they say that who's the ones that are saved at the end Matthew 7 says he that does the will of my father not all that say to me Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom but he that does the will of my father how do we know the will of his father of his word he that does and keeps the word Jesus says that over and over again if you love me keep my Commandments and thank God we don't have to keep his Commandments in our own power but it's by that Holy Ghost that he gives to us that enables us to keep his word he places that love for him inside of you you know the scripture says blessed are you when you hunger and thirst for righteousness for you shall be filled well scripturally you can't do that as an unregenerate person you can't do that unless God has placed that desire inside of you so if you have a desire for him it shows that he's calling you might not be living the way you should but that desire inside of you is calling you to live the way you should and that desire will lead to the power to live the way you should but there are some there ordained they might hear hear they hear the word they even respond to the word but they're ordained to condemnation they're ordained to be what not wheat but tears the rain falls and they rejoice they're there amongst them amongst amongst the church but they're ordained to condemnation 2nd Peter chapter 3 and verse 9 the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us-ward not willing that any should perish but all should come to repentance oh boy now you got a contradiction brother Jason well let's read it let's read it again the Lord is not slack concerning his promise no problem as some men count slackness but is long-suffering - who what us word who that who's he writing to LeBron James the the Egyptian government maybe it's the American government no he's not writing to them he's writing to Saints so God is he's not slack concerning his promise to us word doesn't have a promise to the world does it have promise to those who are deigned to condemnation he has a promise to his elect and he's not slack he's not late he's always on time he's not willing that any should perish while he's ordained some to condemnation but he sought not ordained any of the elected Bride of Christ to condemnation none of us will perish he's giving us all space to repent but that all should come to repentance who's going to come to repentance the people that are ordained a condemnation know the predestinated seed that were chosen in him before the foundation of the world they will hear they will come to pre penance in in the sermon influenced 1963 where the Branham said God will take his anointed and you cannot impersonate that office God anoints he chooses who he wills he condemns who He wills it's God that does the justifying it's God that does the choosing and he raises it up God condemns who he wills has mercy on whom He wills Ephesians 1:13 through 14 in whom he also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that he believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory and then he feed his 430 and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed until the day of redemption we're sealed until the day of redemption those ones that he's not slack concerning his promise he will see them through he sealed them till the day of eternal redemption what is the day of your redemption so when you get a new body then you could then then you'll never fail never fall because you're a jet you're immortal you can't you can't even die it's not even possible and the fact is if we understood it correctly in this life we cannot die we just passed from one form to another we shouldn't be uncertain about death should we yet somehow we have a fear there but we shouldn't be uncertain if God has called you if you know who you are then there's no possum that you can lose you no one can pluck you out of God's hand no one can take you out of can you find someone more powerful that can overpower God can you find someone more powerful that could take you out of his will not even death death is just a servant for you and I death just passes us from this pest house to my father's house so we shouldn't we shouldn't be afraid let's not be so tied to this world let's not be so tied to the stuff of life to our plans our ideas what we want let's just be let's just get ourselves out of the picture say God I belong to you whatever you want to do through me and in me let it be done I'm not gonna fight anymore I'm not gonna resist anymore because ultimately you aren't you want to do it the hard way or you want to do it the easy way do you want to surrender now or you do do you want God to make you put you to your knees we've all we've all been through that where we listen right away and it was smooth sailing difficulties people spoke against us but it just worked and we've all I have heard from the Lord and it took years for God to break me down until I was saying I have mercy I'll do it brother branham tells the same stories he's subject to the same thing he was subject for the same things that we were God broke him down and broke him down and broke him down Feli was simply just a vessel that God just passed himself through to the people that's what we want to be musicians if you'd come God is always going to and we read it we read it work everything according to the counsel of his own will that means even the smallest detail of your life the smallest thing you're experiencing God is intimately involved and he's working why don't you just a let yourself see it that way why don't you let yourself believe that God is in that control I mean think about I always go back to what I was talking about in Sunday school I look at the life of Jesus and he was there standing before Pilate and it's just astounding to me how aware he was of the father's hand and power in his life and how he stood he stood there and he says don't you Pilate says don't you know I have power over you says you wouldn't have any authority over me unless it was given you from above and I think we we need to remember that in our lives God is in control whatever situation we find ourselves in if you're a Christian if you're a believer God is right there he's he's ordained every fiber of the situation that you're in see him see his purpose see his plan but don't just see it as a fatalist see it as God is working in me God is using and using me in this situation it's not just you're not an active participant the Bible says we're participators together with God he wants to work and you let him do it and then let's stand up let's pray Heavenly Father we love you so much Lord we want we want to see you more we want these truths not just to be words on pages that make us feel good Lord but we want these things to be just ingrained in our very soul so that we understand your sovereignty understand your hand in our life that we see every situation and we can
