[40:59] Lord I could there's lots of things I
[41:02] could say I could put it in such a way
[41:05] Lord using using the tricks of
[41:07] psychology and and and and and speaking
[41:12] and and using it as a craft and tickle
[41:15] the ears Lord and and and even excite
[41:18] the senses but father what good would
[41:20] that do Lord what good would it be what
[41:23] we need the area we need our help in is
[41:26] in the soul and I can't reach that Lord
[41:29] by any by any means at my disposal
[41:32] it takes you all I can do is preach your
[41:35] word and ask you to take it Lord and
[41:37] water that seed let it grow in the
[41:40] hearts and minds of your family we

[42:04] amen amen god bless you first Peter
[42:08] chapter 4 amen verses one looks like
[42:17] we'll go down through at least maybe
[42:22] verse six or seven let's go through
[42:24] verse seven
[42:26] for as much then as Christ hath suffered
[42:29] for us in the flesh arm yourselves
[42:31] likewise with the same mind for he that
[42:36] hath suffered in the flesh has ceased
[42:38] from sin that he no longer should live
[42:42] the rest of his time in the flesh to the
[42:45] lust of men but to the will of God for
[42:49] the time past of our life may suffice us
[42:52] to have wrought the will of the Gentiles
[42:55] when we walked in lasciviousness lust
[42:57] excess of wine revellings banqueting zou
[43:00] Bominable idolatries wherein they think
[43:04] it's strange that you run not with them
[43:07] to the same excess of riot speaking evil
[43:10] of you who shall give account to him
[43:13] that is ready to judge the quick and the
[43:15] dead for for for this cause was the
[43:19] gospel preached also to them that are
[43:21] dead that they might be judged according
[43:24] to men in the flesh but live according
[43:27] to God in the spirit but the end of all
[43:31] things is at hand be you therefore sober
[43:34] and watch unto prayer may the Lord add
[43:37] blessings to the reading of his word as
[43:39] you're seated
[43:54] so much meaning in that sixth verse will
[43:57] come to it shortly let's let's just move
[44:05] in now so we're trying we're gonna take
[44:07] today our third installment of the arm
[44:11] of the Lord this will be the arm of the
[44:13] Lord part three
[44:15] now just want to say that we're
[44:18] monitoring closely governor McMasters
[44:22] announcements we're hoping to be able to
[44:26] be back to regular assembly with some
[44:29] social distancing not sure how that's
[44:31] all going to work so don't bother asking
[44:34] me I don't know so we're just gonna see
[44:37] we'll see we'll see how it goes
[44:39] we'll see what's allowed and there's no
[44:42] way we could have everybody and then
[44:44] everybody stay six feet apart the
[44:46] building's not big enough so we may have
[44:49] to do kind of a phased reentry I'm not
[44:51] sure don't know don't ask me because I
[44:54] don't know but it might be that you know
[44:59] in the in the coming short couple of
[45:01] weeks or so that we might find that this
[45:07] thing is gone and there's no more really
[45:11] legitimate threat and we could all just
[45:13] come back all together I sure do
[45:16] miss everybody being here amen so when
[45:21] we closed out part two we were speaking
[45:25] about the confirmation visit that
[45:28] Abraham received and you just bear with
[45:30] me let me lead back in and recapture our
[45:33] minds get us back to where we were we
[45:37] were talking about the visitation that
[45:39] of Melchizedek when he met Abraham in
[45:42] Genesis chapter 18 Abraham looked and
[45:45] saw three men bowed before them speaking
[45:48] to the one and said my lord and he
[45:51] enticed him to come in and you know
[45:53] Abraham was very zealous over that God
[45:57] was going to be in his presence or that
[46:00] he got to be in the presence of God I
[46:02] hope that we're zealous I hope that you
[46:05] out there I realized that wherever to
[46:07] three are gathered Christ promised to be
[46:09] there but but we miss all being together
[46:12] amen and I hope that you're not sitting
[46:15] at home getting fat and comfortable a
[46:17] man you know in pajamas and cup of
[46:21] coffee you know watching the preaching
[46:23] and I'm just joking around if you're if
[46:27] you're that way fine whatever that's
[46:28] that's you but praise God I don't come
[46:33] to church like that amen amen so we're
[46:35] looking for the time I you know I I I
[46:38] sent out a request to see you know who
[46:42] would like to maybe be included who
[46:43] hasn't got to come and I got maybe a
[46:46] grand total of two maybe three requests
[46:48] and out of the whole church and I
[46:50] thought boy I hope everybody's not
[46:51] getting comfortable not coming to church
[46:53] but then I also know I get it I
[46:56] understand that many of you didn't
[46:58] because you were preferring your brother
[46:59] and waiting to see if somebody else
[47:01] brother Jack sends me the most courteous
[47:04] text you know brother Jason we'd we'd
[47:06] love to be there anytime but not if it's
[47:08] gonna interfere not if it's gonna block
[47:10] somebody but we'd like to be there but
[47:11] it's just up to you ha ha hey man I sure
[47:14] love having brother Jack and sister
[47:16] Cathy here service or two ago amen so
[47:19] we'll get them back on the rotation
[47:21] again if this goes much further amen but
[47:24] you know Abraham was excited to be in
[47:28] the presence of God and you know if it's
[47:32] not really in my notes today I was
[47:34] thinking about it as I was studying but
[47:35] but you know earlier this morning but
[47:39] how that you know if you find and I'm
[47:41] not gonna go back there today and look
[47:43] at it again but Abraham you know he he
[47:46] he says a few things just off top my
[47:48] head you know come in and and refresh
[47:50] yourselves and let me get a morsel of
[47:52] bread and some water and and that's what
[47:56] he promised that that's what I'll do
[47:57] come in you know come come to come in
[48:00] and rest yourselves and let me you know
[48:03] wait on you and I'll get you some bread
[48:04] and some water but you know what he was
[48:07] so excited that he did more than he
[48:10] promised he went you know and and had
[48:12] Sarah quickly make all this bread and
[48:14] then he ran and got a choice kid and
[48:15] then ran and took it to a servant said
[48:17] quickly urgently dress up this kid
[48:20] and he brings back and they have a nice
[48:22] meal with proteins and bread and water
[48:25] and fellowship and you know I thought
[48:28] about how that Abraham you know I that's
[48:30] a good business model
[48:31] I've always recommended that you know
[48:34] all my sons are in business a lot of you
[48:36] men are in business them the majority of
[48:37] our church thank God we haven't suffered
[48:40] a great deal not overwhelmingly from the
[48:43] from the pandemic because most of our
[48:45] brothers are actually working more
[48:48] especially in our mechanical trades and
[48:49] so we're thankful for that but I've
[48:52] always said to them listen guys here's a
[48:55] good business model and let me just say
[48:57] to you church here's a good spiritual
[48:59] model when it comes to your dealings
[49:01] with Christ or you businessmen or ladies
[49:04] when you're dealing with the public
[49:05] never promise more than you can do and
[49:09] always do more than you promised and if
[49:12] you follow that simple rule and don't
[49:14] never promise more than you can do and
[49:17] always do more than you promised and you
[49:20] will have success and this is what
[49:22] Abraham did Abraham promised the Lord if
[49:25] you come in and rest I'll get you some
[49:26] bread and water but he ends up bringing
[49:28] a feast he did it with enthusiasm with
[49:32] excitement and I I would just say today
[49:34] that you know wherever you are you're
[49:37] sitting in your living room or you're
[49:39] here in the sanctuary let us be thrilled
[49:42] to be in the presence of God because
[49:44] there there's you you don't Iams we lose
[49:47] sight of just what this being can do for
[49:50] you this being in your life this being
[49:53] in your home this person of God when he
[49:56] comes something good always happens and
[49:59] and so I I don't know about you friends
[50:02] I think I know that you're like me I
[50:04] want him in my life I want to make my
[50:07] lifestyle conducive to his presence I
[50:11] want to make my activities to where he
[50:14] could come right in and go hey what's
[50:16] going on as if he doesn't know whoa he
[50:18] likes to talk to you like a man and I
[50:20] can say Oh Lord where it weirdest this
[50:23] this this this and you know to see him
[50:25] be pleased I wanted we sing the song
[50:27] pleasing let me be pleased
[50:30] see we those can't be just words friends
[50:33] those that has to be a reality that has
[50:35] to be as brother Kenny sings that song
[50:37] that has to be your heart song your
[50:41] heart should sing praises amen so
[50:46] Abraham was thrilled and we were closing
[50:49] out last time showing how that this
[50:51] visitation was a confirmation to a visit
[50:55] that he had he had been having God had
[50:57] been promising these things all the way
[50:59] back from Genesis 12 and on and in fact
[51:02] his God had just met him in Genesis 17
[51:05] and and made promises to him who I don't
[51:08] want to get ahead of myself but we
[51:11] realized that not that visitation in
[51:14] chapter 18 and it's so significant
[51:16] because the chapter 17 visit only
[51:19] included the Prophet it only included
[51:23] Abraham and he had an instruction that
[51:26] he that his name wouldn't be Abram
[51:28] anymore but it would be Abraham and his
[51:29] wife wouldn't be suraíh it would be
[51:32] Sarah and so so we find that that H
[51:35] meaning deity that God was going to add
[51:38] a representation of deity into his name
[51:41] and that would be necessary because when
[51:44] when Melchizedek came God in a human
[51:47] flesh to give an example to you and I
[51:50] today of the message of the hour when a
[51:53] prophet could duplicate that sign to
[51:55] know the secret in people's heart even
[51:58] people behind him and brother Brandon
[52:00] would even turn his back to the audience
[52:01] and begin to point to people and then
[52:04] turned around and said now receive your
[52:06] sign I'm here to tell you something
[52:08] friends I have received the sign of
[52:10] Melchizedek the Word made flesh and it's
[52:14] not just in a prophet but now but now
[52:16] Sarah is there and H is added to her
[52:20] name because now there had to be God had
[52:23] to have his prophet and there had to be
[52:25] the representation of that there had to
[52:27] be the representation of a bride there
[52:29] had to be the representation of deity
[52:31] infused in our very name and that's why
[52:34] the brother Branham said I don't call
[52:35] you church anymore no no I
[52:37] going to add an agent here we're gonna
[52:39] get Diddy and I'm gonna call you mrs.
[52:41] Jesus Christ the bride I call you bride
[52:47] she's mrs. Jesus Christ and this was an
[52:51] announcement you know we talked about we
[52:54] talked about Sarah and you know and I am
[52:57] getting ahead of myself but I can't I
[52:59] don't get to choose it but but but you
[53:02] know Sarah and brother branham talks
[53:04] about it that she laughed up her sleeve
[53:06] see now you say my what a terrible thing
[53:11] just read the previous chapter Abraham
[53:14] did that did it before she did it God
[53:17] comes to Abraham and says the same thing
[53:19] and the bible says abraham laughed and
[53:22] said just like sarah me being a hundred
[53:27] are you you know my wife is 90 i'm a
[53:30] hundred and he holds up ishmael all that
[53:33] is smell Lord and know no need to make
[53:36] me struggle over the impossible just
[53:39] take his mail and the Lord says look I
[53:41] I've heard your prayer I'm gonna bless
[53:44] Ishmael he is your seed I'm gonna bring
[53:46] 12 princes I'm gonna bring nations from
[53:48] him but my but my covenant is going to
[53:51] be with Isaac who's Sarah shall bear to
[53:54] you at ninety at ninety yes and God said
[53:58] you shall indeed in other words God
[54:00] heard that laughs let me taste some
[54:02] friends the Prophet wasn't the only one
[54:05] in Chapter 17 who had to come to that
[54:08] and get over it and start believing and
[54:10] in chapter 18 it wasn't just a prophet
[54:13] doubting there had to be a bride who
[54:15] heard and saw it and became a believer
[54:18] so that all doubt left her mind as well
[54:21] I'm here to tell you doubt has left my
[54:23] mind doubt left the prophets mind doubt
[54:25] has left my mind has doubt left your
[54:27] mind
[54:29] say what is it I'm believing in that God
[54:32] is going to do the impossible
[54:34] God said what's impossible he's gonna
[54:36] make you perfect quite impossible oh I
[54:45] know believe me I'm the pastor here for
[54:47] more than 25 years God you're gonna make
[54:50] me and these people perfect
[54:54] okay I'm not laughing Oh after 25 years
[55:01] of preaching and and and even I'm not
[55:04] where I need to be and they're not where
[55:06] they need to be because the requirement
[55:09] is perfection it's like oh we're pretty
[55:11] good people it's pretty good people and
[55:13] getting in it takes perfect people
[55:15] there's lots of good people that are
[55:18] gonna miss it it takes perfect jesus
[55:21] said be thou for perfect how perfect as
[55:25] your father in heaven is perfect
[55:27] say that's impossible exactly that's why
[55:30] there has to take faith in the atonement
[55:32] of Christ and what God has done in this
[55:34] last day by returning to us the
[55:38] visitation of confirmation and that's
[55:41] what the seals were and that's what he
[55:43] came down and had a meal with Abraham
[55:45] and he had a seven-course meal with you
[55:47] and I hallelujah and we have had it
[55:52] confirmed to us the world can think what
[55:58] they want the world can choose to call
[56:02] it a cult I call it a confirmation the
[56:06] world can choose to call us nuts I say
[56:08] fine but I'm screwed to the right bolt
[56:11] I'm happy to be and not leave me alone
[56:13] I'm happy this way I wasn't happy when I
[56:17] wasn't a nut when I was normal according
[56:21] to the world
[56:22] I couldn't sleep good I walked in fear
[56:26] and anxiety of what happens if the
[56:28] rapture comes tomorrow I don't have that
[56:30] anxiety anymore if I say what if it
[56:33] comes tomorrow what if it comes in the
[56:35] next five minutes I start jumping up and
[56:37] down saying yeah yeah yeah
[56:39] let it come Lord so we have the climax
[56:45] there in Revelation 10 that was not just
[56:48] some set of sermons the opening of the
[56:50] seven seals was the most monumental
[56:52] event that the church had waited for
[56:55] 2,000 years to have that book reopened
[56:59] to them as it had been in Paul's day and
[57:05] it had been closed because that church
[57:08] back slid and Christ sets back down to
[57:10] intercede for the church but he promised
[57:13] that at the end time he would step
[57:14] forward again and take the book and
[57:16] loose the seals and open it to us and
[57:18] today we're feasting not on a not on a
[57:21] man but on the body word of the Son of
[57:24] Man hallelujah so it was a divine
[57:29] declaration to Abraham and his bride
[57:33] Genesis 18 was a divine declaration to
[57:38] Abraham and his bride of a human humanly
[57:43] impossible birth it was humanly
[57:49] impossible in the natural fray brahim
[57:51] and Sarah not to mention you know how
[57:54] old they were but even when they were
[57:55] young they had not been able the cruelty
[57:58] of sin had kept them childless and and
[58:02] and Melchizedek was coming to say the
[58:05] cruelty of sin shall keep you childless
[58:08] no longer the time had arrived he called
[58:12] it the time of life the mighty angel
[58:14] Melchizedek was descending to confirm
[58:17] that the impossible was going to take
[58:19] place you know it's just like us in the
[58:22] spiritual ranks brother Brandon said
[58:23] denominations had held us denominations
[58:26] had held Christ they had held him for
[58:27] years but a naked thought but those
[58:30] denominational tombs couldn't hold him
[58:32] just like the tomb in Jerusalem couldn't
[58:34] hold him he oh he came out of that tomb
[58:36] and the stone was rolled away and he he
[58:40] was resurrected that's my brother
[58:41] Brandon would say what a resurrection
[58:43] that was right historically but what a
[58:47] resurrection this is
[58:49] is what resurrection out of cold formal
[58:52] denominations out of manmade system and
[58:55] theories of men good men dedicated
[58:58] sincere men but couldn't get the picture
[59:01] right and we had to have the picture
[59:03] right we had to know what it is we're
[59:06] coming to because your faith can't be
[59:09] established on nothing you've got to
[59:11] have something to ground your faith on
[59:13] you've got to have a word brother
[59:15] Branham said that if I said to you go
[59:18] out there and touch that tree and you
[59:19] can be healed
[59:20] brother Branson you can't put faith in
[59:23] that because there's no word for that
[59:26] there's no where the word says go touch
[59:29] a tree and be healed but the word does
[59:32] say they shall lay hands on the sick and
[59:34] they shall recover
[59:35] now I have a basis for my faith and
[59:39] people wanted to take a rapture how were
[59:41] you ever gonna take a rapture with a
[59:43] closed book sealed up under seven seals
[59:45] and you couldn't even fully understand
[59:47] the rapture mystery you'd only
[59:50] understand the bride couldn't even
[59:51] understand her position in Christ and we
[59:55] were trapped but the time of Jubilee
[59:58] that was what Melchizedek was coming to
[1:00:01] announce to Abraham that's what the
[1:00:02] seals were announcing to us that it was
[1:00:05] he had come to two commits a Jubilee
[1:00:08] that the word will be born in the flesh
[1:00:11] of his family and that's what's
[1:00:14] happening to us our lives are being
[1:00:19] transformed into the body of the word
[1:00:22] just like a mother a transformation
[1:00:27] takes place inside her starts out just
[1:00:30] microscopically small but it grows and
[1:00:34] grows and what's it doing it's becoming
[1:00:35] a human see and that's just the
[1:00:38] spiritual side of it that that that he
[1:00:40] was coming to announce he's not saying
[1:00:42] you're gonna have the the baby by this
[1:00:45] time tonight he that Genesis 18 the
[1:00:48] seals weren't saying never were saying
[1:00:50] to us the raptures tomorrow morning that
[1:00:52] could have been but when when we look
[1:00:54] back now in hindsight we see the type in
[1:00:56] the scripture how that how that it was
[1:00:59] that it was the announcement that it's
[1:01:00] begun
[1:01:02] no the catching away of the rapture is
[1:01:05] not yet but the rapture has begun no
[1:01:09] you're not perfect yet you're an infant
[1:01:12] bride you've got to lay in the presence
[1:01:14] of the Sun and ripen but I'm here to
[1:01:16] tell you it's underway the cycle is
[1:01:18] underway and it has an end date and an
[1:01:21] end game and this thing ain't gonna stop
[1:01:23] and I just say I believe that we're
[1:01:25] right on the moment friends we call it
[1:01:28] the time of life he said I'll return
[1:01:29] this time next year according to the
[1:01:31] time of life and I'm not gonna come to
[1:01:33] promise you again you shall embrace a
[1:01:36] son I'm here to taste something friends
[1:01:39] I'm going to embrace a new body I'm
[1:01:41] gonna embrace those loved ones who've
[1:01:43] gone before I'm gonna embrace a whole
[1:01:45] new mind and a whole new spirit
[1:01:49] hallelujah that's what it came to do the
[1:01:54] visitation was to announce it see the
[1:01:57] word will be born in the flesh of his
[1:01:59] family that's what God was coming to
[1:02:01] promise Abraham there would be plenty of
[1:02:04] run-up to that birth see so she wasn't
[1:02:09] even pregnant yet she wasn't even turned
[1:02:12] back to where she could get pretty she's
[1:02:13] still 90 so God literally had to visit
[1:02:16] her with a temporary resurrection a type
[1:02:18] of what's gonna happen to us on a
[1:02:19] permanent basis and he literally turned
[1:02:22] her body back young again and that's
[1:02:25] what's gonna happen to us now she
[1:02:26] started from that point aging again it's
[1:02:28] just and she died an old lady
[1:02:30] so did Abraham died well stricken in
[1:02:32] years but took but for the purposes of
[1:02:34] the word God reversed nature an
[1:02:37] impossibility say it's impossible
[1:02:39] brother Jason I've done too many things
[1:02:41] wrong I can't get right I got too many
[1:02:43] weaknesses I'm here to tell you the
[1:02:45] seals were open for you people with
[1:02:47] impossible problems I mean and I'm not
[1:02:50] here to tell you that it's happy it's
[1:02:52] gonna happen if you're a believer of
[1:02:54] this word today I'm here to tell you
[1:02:56] it's already happening your body is
[1:02:59] already changing from the inside it
[1:03:01] starts in the soul that can believe
[1:03:03] every word
[1:03:05] and say a man and then a daily
[1:03:07] surrendering just like an unexpected
[1:03:09] mother has to daily surrender I'm
[1:03:11] pregnant it's not going to stop now the
[1:03:14] world wants to stop it and that's why
[1:03:16] you have abortion and the denomination
[1:03:18] wants to stop it they don't want brother
[1:03:20] Brennan said they don't want Holy Ghost
[1:03:22] babies but that's the only kind that
[1:03:26] will ever be in heaven hallelujah see so
[1:03:34] the birth itself the long-awaited
[1:03:36] promise to be fulfilled so throughout
[1:03:40] the passage when we read about Abraham
[1:03:46] laughing Sarah laughing throughout the
[1:03:53] passage you know we continue to marvel
[1:03:57] and it's a marvel to me when I read
[1:04:00] Genesis from Genesis 12 and now when I
[1:04:05] go over into the book of Hebrews to the
[1:04:07] Hall of Fame to the to the Hall of faith
[1:04:10] and he pin in the book of Hebrews the
[1:04:13] Bible and and not only there but in in
[1:04:15] so many places as stoles the life of
[1:04:17] Abraham is perfect he never never
[1:04:19] waivered never doubted see now that
[1:04:22] shows you what the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:04:25] when it's finished
[1:04:26] you're perfect because when I go to in
[1:04:28] Genesis I read all kinds of things
[1:04:31] Abraham did Abraham stumbled a lot
[1:04:34] Abraham was dilatory and obeying Abraham
[1:04:38] was slow Abraham didn't always do it the
[1:04:40] right way brother Matt was just
[1:04:42] preaching Wednesday night about how
[1:04:43] Jacob and brother Branham says you know
[1:04:46] you're really gonna have to believe in
[1:04:47] the grace of God to believe for Jacob
[1:04:49] because Jacob was constantly constantly
[1:04:53] doing things that you'd have thought
[1:04:55] he's the last one in the planet to be
[1:04:56] qualified that God's gonna carry a
[1:04:58] covenant through but God did see God did
[1:05:02] and and and you know what you know
[1:05:05] here's what it was friends
[1:05:06] Jacob literally couldn't lie his way out
[1:05:09] of being a child of God Jacob couldn't
[1:05:12] fail his way out of being a child of God
[1:05:15] goodness Jacob couldn't couldn't
[1:05:18] disappoint his family and disappoint his
[1:05:20] self enough to be taken out of the role
[1:05:23] that God had already ordained for him in
[1:05:26] that beautiful hallelujah and Abraham
[1:05:29] couldn't do that either abraham lied and
[1:05:32] got caught lying and did it twice and
[1:05:34] and you know and and rebelled and goes
[1:05:37] to Egypt and his back slid and and then
[1:05:39] and then and and then and I think in
[1:05:41] Chapter off an inch I believe it's
[1:05:44] chapter fourteen I haven't read it in a
[1:05:46] while but Abraham and it may be thirteen
[1:05:49] or fourteen or fifteen somewhere near
[1:05:50] Abraham goes to God after God's made him
[1:05:52] this promise and he says you know I know
[1:05:54] you may I'm paraphrasing scripture I
[1:05:56] know you made me this promise but you
[1:05:58] know there I still don't have any seed
[1:06:01] and I ain't getting younger
[1:06:02] you know the seals were preached all
[1:06:05] those years ago and we're still here you
[1:06:09] know prophets been gone now it's with
[1:06:11] fifty seven years since the opening
[1:06:12] seals and we're still here neighbor him
[1:06:14] said I I know what you promised I but I
[1:06:16] still don't have it and I I got this
[1:06:18] child you know this Eliezer who's a
[1:06:21] servant and it looks like if you don't
[1:06:24] keep your promise he's gonna inherit
[1:06:26] everything I had now you'd think God
[1:06:28] would just say Abraham I am sick of you
[1:06:31] challenging me and doubting me and
[1:06:34] failing I'm glad God didn't throw him
[1:06:37] out because that means he can't throw me
[1:06:39] out when I doubt him and when I fail and
[1:06:44] he would and he could be tempted to
[1:06:45] throw me out I can say remember Abraham
[1:06:47] thy servant hallelujah
[1:06:50] o mine I don't this remind him of
[1:06:52] Abraham I remind him of Jesus I say Lord
[1:06:56] I'm weak but he was strong I'm imperfect
[1:06:58] but he was perfect and you told me it
[1:07:01] would be his life for my life hallelujah
[1:07:03] and my life for his life now I saw him
[1:07:06] go to Calvary and die so I know that the
[1:07:10] first part of it worked my life got put
[1:07:12] on him because I saw him die I saw him
[1:07:15] judge and he had never done anything
[1:07:16] wrong so the only way he could be dying
[1:07:19] your hand is if you judged him and since
[1:07:22] he never did anything wrong the only way
[1:07:23] he could be judged is if he took my sin
[1:07:25] now if I'm gonna believe that then I
[1:07:28] have to believe his life came on me
[1:07:31] hallelujah Oh
[1:07:34] let us not doubted friends let us press
[1:07:36] on and say I'm in that number I'm part
[1:07:38] of that body change I am going to be
[1:07:41] raised up at the end there's no way I
[1:07:43] can miss it one thing I've never been
[1:07:47] able to accomplish in all my sinful
[1:07:49] deeds I've never been able to commit the
[1:07:54] worst sin and that is to disbelieve his
[1:07:58] word I can say to the Lord
[1:08:04] that's perfect faith the devil can't
[1:08:08] even challenge me on it he's it's you
[1:08:13] you say oh brother I'm said perfect
[1:08:15] faith it's getting perfect this right
[1:08:16] now I have this imperfect faith I can
[1:08:20] say before God Lord I never have
[1:08:24] disbelieved your word failed at it yes
[1:08:29] stumble trip iniquity things I knew I
[1:08:32] shouldn't undid anyway and things I knew
[1:08:35] I should do you word wanting me to and I
[1:08:36] wouldn't do it and and and I've been a
[1:08:38] terrible failure but here's one thing
[1:08:40] Lord my heart is open to you today I've
[1:08:42] always said a man to every word that
[1:08:45] proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[1:08:46] hallelujah
[1:08:48] oh what a promise and I can say that in
[1:08:52] perfect unfettered uncolored undefiled
[1:08:57] faith that's why the devil can't knock
[1:09:01] me off of it because it's perfect faith
[1:09:03] see and I know it's true and the devil
[1:09:06] knows it's true and he's even got all
[1:09:08] the replay footage it's inadmissible in
[1:09:11] court but he keeps a record of it but it
[1:09:14] doesn't matter he doesn't have a file
[1:09:16] search my record there's no file don't I
[1:09:19] don't want him to let you search my
[1:09:20] record does there be things that
[1:09:21] embarrass me but you would never find me
[1:09:24] doubting God's Word amen
[1:09:27] come on all you holy people a man Oh
[1:09:31] hallelujah
[1:09:34] and God said to him there this shall not
[1:09:38] be the air miss Eliezer out of thy own
[1:09:42] loins
[1:09:43] in other words Abraham it's going to be
[1:09:47] the seed gene of you that inherits the
[1:09:50] promise not something I'm not a servant
[1:09:54] that came into your house not no matter
[1:09:56] how he got there he's never going to be
[1:09:59] more than your servant now it's a great
[1:10:00] privilege fairly easier to be your
[1:10:02] servant and I've got a place and a
[1:10:04] reward for him but he's not out of your
[1:10:06] loins he's not a gene of your seed out
[1:10:10] of your own loins out of your own seed
[1:10:13] I'm going to bring forth the kingdom of
[1:10:15] God and that's exactly what the Lord has
[1:10:18] done and so through those kinds of
[1:10:22] failures of Abraham through the doubting
[1:10:25] through the back sliding through the
[1:10:27] lying through the in God's face laughing
[1:10:32] go read 1772 chapter 17 God was there
[1:10:38] personally this wasn't even a dream like
[1:10:41] Jacob had God was literally standing
[1:10:44] there talking to him and Abraham is
[1:10:47] laughing at him laughing at the idea of
[1:10:51] what he's saying and in and and then he
[1:10:54] comes to Sarah and then Sarah is
[1:10:57] laughing and then not only is she
[1:10:59] laughing then she tried to lie your way
[1:11:01] out of it you know when you tell a line
[1:11:03] you get caught you get busted you'd have
[1:11:05] to think of three more lies to cover the
[1:11:06] first one and then later on you need
[1:11:09] nine more to cover those three which
[1:11:10] covered the first one that's my brother
[1:11:13] Brendan said always just tell the truth
[1:11:14] and that way you can tell it the same
[1:11:16] way every time
[1:11:17] and so we find that even when she's
[1:11:21] Abraham's doubting and he's sinning and
[1:11:23] she's doubting and she's sinning and
[1:11:24] he's lying and she's lying and and
[1:11:27] throughout all of this story in Genesis
[1:11:29] we continue to marvel at the insistence
[1:11:31] the insistence of God's grace
[1:11:36] against all odds in spite of Abraham's
[1:11:40] laughter in spite of Sara's laughter God
[1:11:43] remains determined to bless Sara
[1:11:46] he said that in Genesis 17 17 and 21
[1:11:52] give me that brother Travis Genesis 17
[1:11:54] sorry to jump you I should've gave you a
[1:11:56] warning Genesis 17 verse 7 chapter 17
[1:12:00] verse 17 and then we'll go from there
[1:12:02] and we'll hit verse 21 Genesis 17 then
[1:12:05] Abraham fell upon his face and laughed
[1:12:07] and said in his heart shall a child be
[1:12:11] born unto him that is a hundred years
[1:12:12] old and shall Sarah that is 90 years old
[1:12:16] verse 21 but my covenant will I
[1:12:19] establish with Isaac which Sarah shall
[1:12:22] bear unto thee at this time in the next
[1:12:26] year hallelujah and and then it comes in
[1:12:30] the next chapter and she's laughing and
[1:12:33] Abraham is laughing but but God is
[1:12:36] determined to bless her that blows fuses
[1:12:41] on this boy God will not take no for an
[1:12:45] answer you're gonna serve me no oh yes
[1:12:48] you are no I'm not we'll see I'm here to
[1:12:53] tell your friends I'm glad he runs
[1:12:55] faster than me jumps higher hallelujah
[1:12:57] I'm plan I hide in a hole he knows how
[1:12:59] to dig me out
[1:13:00] I'm glad if I run into a house he'll
[1:13:02] burn me out smoke me out do what I gotta
[1:13:04] do he's not leaving me here understand
[1:13:08] and I've said it to you before if you're
[1:13:09] the elected child of God you're going in
[1:13:11] the rapture and there's nothing you can
[1:13:13] do to stop it
[1:13:14] hallelujah see so God's purpose of grace
[1:13:21] listen friends this is an amazing
[1:13:23] statement because God is determined to
[1:13:28] bless Sarah and Abraham and you know as
[1:13:32] well as me for you to beyond anything
[1:13:36] they are we ever deserved God's purpose
[1:13:43] and grace his purposes in grace absorb
[1:13:50] this now God's purposes in grace are not
[1:13:54] held captive to human sin or
[1:13:59] circumstances in your life even if you
[1:14:02] created the circumstances many times
[1:14:06] they're thrust on to us I don't know
[1:14:09] I've heard horror stories just beyond
[1:14:12] imagination I'm a world traveler I've
[1:14:16] set and counseled and you don't even
[1:14:18] sometimes the the situation is so bad
[1:14:21] and you know hardly know where to you
[1:14:24] don't you understand the question much
[1:14:25] less the answer and here's a gallant
[1:14:28] person and the situation is so horrible
[1:14:31] of no fault of their own yeah sure the
[1:14:35] atheist uses stuff like that to say see
[1:14:37] there is no God well I got a problem and
[1:14:40] my problem is I got faith and so I look
[1:14:44] at the circumstances and even if I can't
[1:14:46] understand it all I still know he is I
[1:14:50] still know that God is I still know that
[1:14:54] he's a rewarder of them that diligently
[1:14:55] seek Him and many times my only answer
[1:14:59] to a problem it's so convoluted and
[1:15:01] twisted such a Gordian knot there's no
[1:15:03] way that to untie it I just have to take
[1:15:06] say look stand back I'm going to take
[1:15:08] the Word of God and I'm gonna take it as
[1:15:09] a sword on there like Alexander and I'm
[1:15:11] gonna chop this knot in half there's no
[1:15:13] sense trying to untangle it just let the
[1:15:15] word cut it asunder and go free you
[1:15:19] can't go back and fix it just go forward
[1:15:21] and be happy
[1:15:22] amen because none of that I promise you
[1:15:25] I don't care what's happening say but I
[1:15:27] can't get over I can't let it go I
[1:15:29] promise you in 10,000 years it won't
[1:15:33] matter and won't it so won't matter in
[1:15:37] 10,000 years so why go 10,000 years
[1:15:41] worried just let it go let God take
[1:15:44] control of your life I promise you faith
[1:15:47] and happiness and joy are just in front
[1:15:50] of you so he is that he's the God who
[1:15:55] works out his purposes through weak and
[1:15:58] very very very ordinary
[1:16:01] beings that's what he's doing to Abraham
[1:16:04] that's what he's doing to Sarah he's
[1:16:08] working out his purpose through very
[1:16:13] ordinary sometimes weak got a lot of
[1:16:19] hang-ups through weak ordinary
[1:16:23] vulnerable people see so god he needs to
[1:16:36] take Abraham he needs to take his
[1:16:38] prophet beyond human limitations and a
[1:16:42] lot of times friends I'll to say that
[1:16:46] life is really just singularly about
[1:16:49] that sometimes you can come upon a thing
[1:16:52] in your life and you're dealing with it
[1:16:54] and it's so egregious to you or so
[1:16:57] bitter so embarrassing or so you you
[1:17:00] hate it so bad and you you want you want
[1:17:04] freedom you want past it you want over
[1:17:07] it it is so completely impossible that
[1:17:11] that you say well what is God doing in
[1:17:15] my life for crying out loud
[1:17:17] why can't this just get fixed because
[1:17:22] brother branham shows us you know about
[1:17:24] an overcomer that he's not just pushing
[1:17:26] you through a pipe and pulling you out
[1:17:29] the other side and have you molded into
[1:17:30] the I want you to look like a pipe so
[1:17:32] I'm gonna jam you in and pull you out
[1:17:35] and when you come out you look just like
[1:17:36] the pipe you know he doesn't want you
[1:17:39] you know forced by a mold he wants you
[1:17:42] to put on the whole armor of God and
[1:17:44] march forward and gain some victory
[1:17:47] swing your sword get on your knees go to
[1:17:50] church more read your Bible more hear
[1:17:53] tapes more cut off some of the things
[1:17:55] out of your life that you know good and
[1:17:57] well are poisoning you
[1:18:00] this thing works I'm here to tell you
[1:18:02] the gospel works and God knows what he's
[1:18:05] doing and so you know God takes his
[1:18:08] prophet and sometimes he takes us beyond
[1:18:11] our human limitations to believe it he
[1:18:14] did Abraham that way he did Sarah that
[1:18:17] way you know she she couldn't disbelieve
[1:18:20] when the very secrets of her heart were
[1:18:23] being revealed you can't disbelieve when
[1:18:25] that's happening so so we find then that
[1:18:30] you know here no no let me let me change
[1:18:34] gears or go turn a corner all right let
[1:18:37] me hit a practical side of this so we're
[1:18:42] talking about what the seals meant to us
[1:18:45] and what Genesis 18 means to us and
[1:18:47] we're seeing the correlations and say
[1:18:49] wow that's what happened in our day we
[1:18:51] had a we had a 20th century version of
[1:18:54] Genesis 18 okay well Sarah had the real
[1:19:02] event not any less not any greater real
[1:19:05] than ours but she had the natural she
[1:19:08] actually was there she actually saw
[1:19:11] Melchizedek she actually is talking to
[1:19:13] God in a human body she's actually
[1:19:16] laughing on God and God is actually
[1:19:18] giving her the promise and confirming it
[1:19:20] and then you know what she does she
[1:19:22] believes it but you know what comes next
[1:19:25] Monday morning Tuesday Wednesday guess
[1:19:33] what happens next week Monday morning
[1:19:35] guess what happens a month from then
[1:19:37] Monday morning Tuesday morning Wednesday
[1:19:41] morning guess what happens see so so
[1:19:45] what happens when the sign was gone what
[1:19:50] happened when he left you know you saw
[1:19:53] the faith of many who believed that sign
[1:19:56] who don't walk this way anymore
[1:19:58] why a prophet left the sign left and
[1:20:01] people just quit moving Sarah after the
[1:20:05] sign left after it was gone all she had
[1:20:07] was the promise she still had to get up
[1:20:09] the next day and believe it she had to
[1:20:11] get up the next day
[1:20:12] and believe it and the next week and
[1:20:15] believe it she had to wake up and go to
[1:20:17] work the next day you have to wake up
[1:20:19] and go to work she had to get back to
[1:20:21] her life still in progress the seals
[1:20:26] were great I'm here to tell you
[1:20:28] something my mom and dad were in a lot
[1:20:29] of those meetings guess what happened
[1:20:31] when the when that Sunday services were
[1:20:32] over Monday you know how many mondays my
[1:20:36] mom has faced since the day the seals
[1:20:38] were open since the day she was sitting
[1:20:41] there hearing the masterpiece since the
[1:20:42] day she's sitting there seeing that gift
[1:20:44] work you know how many mondays she's had
[1:20:46] hallelujah I'm here to tell you like
[1:20:49] Sarah we got it as keep believing our
[1:20:51] life is still in progress the rapture
[1:20:54] wasn't happening in 1963 but the rapture
[1:20:57] was happening in 1963 it's a process and
[1:21:01] God is interweaving his word in your
[1:21:04] life on an everyday basis I want to say
[1:21:08] press the battle that's what Paul knew
[1:21:11] press the battle lay aside you're on a
[1:21:16] journey you're going somewhere your
[1:21:18] life's in progress let aside things that
[1:21:22] are gonna be sent you you don't want to
[1:21:23] do you don't want to have those things
[1:21:26] because the order is to run the race see
[1:21:32] so she had to get back to her life which
[1:21:35] was still in progress and no way you
[1:21:38] never convinced me she lived and moved
[1:21:39] flawlessly the Bible says even Elijah
[1:21:45] was a man of like passion his brother
[1:21:47] Graham said in Kentucky English brother
[1:21:49] em said that many had his ups and downs
[1:21:52] see the only one who ever got a promise
[1:21:56] and lived flawlessly to the end was
[1:21:57] Jesus so the Bible says of everybody
[1:22:02] except him there's none good no not one
[1:22:05] see and so so she had to get back to her
[1:22:11] life still in progress there's no way
[1:22:14] she lived and moved flawlessly but she
[1:22:19] still got pregnant she still had a child
[1:22:22] why friends because the promise was
[1:22:25] given the
[1:22:26] word was already spoken hallelujah it
[1:22:31] would indeed come to pass though though
[1:22:34] though though on Monday morning it was
[1:22:37] still just as impossible as it had
[1:22:40] always been you're gonna leave this
[1:22:42] service today hopefully this word will
[1:22:44] give you some charge up your batteries
[1:22:46] and you'll be ready to go but tomorrow
[1:22:48] you might round the corner and the devil
[1:22:50] might crack you with a Louisville
[1:22:51] Slugger you didn't see come and hit you
[1:22:53] right between the eyes
[1:22:54] you know what you're gonna have to do
[1:22:55] you got to get up yank it out of his
[1:22:57] hands and bash him in the head with it
[1:22:59] life doesn't stop hallelujah we're not
[1:23:02] at the dock sitting on luggage this is
[1:23:04] life in the in progress this is life in
[1:23:07] HD this is happening right now
[1:23:10] hallelujah
[1:23:11] it comes down to believing and moving
[1:23:14] because the word has already been
[1:23:16] declared and I will be changed in a
[1:23:19] moment in the twinkling of an eye it is
[1:23:24] God's grace it is God's grace it is
[1:23:27] God's grace not human merit it is God's
[1:23:35] Word that determines the course and the
[1:23:37] blessing of our lives the beautiful part
[1:23:42] is that though she woke up the next day
[1:23:46] and it was still just as impossible as
[1:23:48] it always had been now she had a promise
[1:23:51] that God would do the impossible part
[1:23:57] you know what when I read that and I
[1:23:59] look at this story in Genesis I'm
[1:24:02] compelled to believe it because I look
[1:24:06] at my own life and I and I realize which
[1:24:11] you know for me you know has seemed to
[1:24:14] be be pretty much there every kind of
[1:24:18] weakness and failure and shortcoming but
[1:24:21] but somehow I've managed to believe it
[1:24:23] still and Endon and I believe it now
[1:24:26] more than ever I believe it now more
[1:24:29] than ever
[1:24:29] oh my you know the devil what a dingdong
[1:24:34] thought that he would you know raise up
[1:24:37] a movement to discourage us
[1:24:40] and you know because you know oh there's
[1:24:42] something about a bridge I don't
[1:24:44] couldn't care less I'm not being
[1:24:45] raptured by jumping off a bridge I don't
[1:24:47] care about a bridge I don't care about
[1:24:49] what a child saw at five years old in a
[1:24:51] vision that that's not what saved me
[1:24:53] what saved me was I could see Jesus
[1:24:56] Christ come into the ministry and I
[1:24:58] could correlate it back there's so much
[1:25:01] we don't know you don't know they talk
[1:25:03] like they know and and we've talked like
[1:25:05] we know a lot of times I just simply say
[1:25:07] God knows and say what you want to but
[1:25:12] I've been in Washington DC I've seen the
[1:25:14] picture the only one that they declares
[1:25:16] a supernatural photograph I've seen the
[1:25:21] effect of this word on people's lives
[1:25:23] who I love people who I preach to
[1:25:25] parents that I've had I see what this
[1:25:27] message has done you come too late to
[1:25:29] tell me it's wrong I already know it's
[1:25:31] true I already see the changes made in
[1:25:34] me and I'm here to tell you if it can
[1:25:36] take an old Sassafrass boy like me and
[1:25:38] bring me out of the world and then keep
[1:25:40] me out of the world and even when I
[1:25:42] stumble pick me back up just jerk me up
[1:25:44] dust me off and go forward again I'm
[1:25:46] here to tell you something friends I
[1:25:48] know whom I have believed and the devil
[1:25:53] instead of discouraging us has made us
[1:25:55] more encouraged my greatest attempts
[1:26:02] have been feeble at the feeble at the
[1:26:06] very least as I've carved out a life of
[1:26:10] service to him these many years and I've
[1:26:13] already been to I remember one time I
[1:26:15] don't I I at the time I was young I
[1:26:18] didn't fully analyze what it meant years
[1:26:20] have taught me more what it meant now I
[1:26:22] remember years ago we were Oh mom we
[1:26:24] were down in Ansan her scene for Nate
[1:26:26] and Margaret's wedding and my dad was
[1:26:29] taking a picture with with Homer Brown
[1:26:30] and they were buddies from way back in
[1:26:32] the 60s and and they're standing there
[1:26:34] with her arm around each other and
[1:26:36] they're waiting you know and somebody's
[1:26:37] got to get the hell and get the focus
[1:26:38] this was before phones could do it for
[1:26:40] you
[1:26:40] and they're standing there my dad just
[1:26:43] smiling and he says to brother Homer and
[1:26:45] he's looking at the camera he says well
[1:26:47] brother Homer we've been through the
[1:26:48] fire have been through the blood and at
[1:26:51] the time I was young man I thought I
[1:26:52] wonder what that
[1:26:53] even means been through the fire been
[1:26:55] through the blood boy do I know how he's
[1:26:57] here later
[1:26:58] oh we've been through the fire we've
[1:27:01] been through the blood oh my the walk of
[1:27:03] faith listen friends this walk of faith
[1:27:06] sometimes involves you just digging your
[1:27:09] heels in and looking you're difficult
[1:27:11] circumstances in the face and say this
[1:27:15] too shall pass and I too shall have
[1:27:18] victory over this in my life taking the
[1:27:21] promises of the of God defying
[1:27:23] discouragement defying disappointments
[1:27:26] defying frustrations that would pay to
[1:27:28] quit quit nothin doin I'm marching for
[1:27:31] Zion hallelujah is anything as we were
[1:27:36] saying and I don't remember part 1 or
[1:27:37] part 2 we were emphasizing so strong is
[1:27:39] anything too hard for God is anything
[1:27:43] too marvelous brother Branham says and
[1:27:47] seen him discrepancy God gave his
[1:27:49] children his word for their defence that
[1:27:52] is your and must be your defence on a
[1:27:55] daily basis in real time you will
[1:27:58] constantly be beset by circumstances and
[1:28:00] challenges you won't always make the
[1:28:02] grade your only - if you try to defend
[1:28:06] yourself by just saying I'm a pretty
[1:28:08] good guy I'll try to do better next time
[1:28:10] here that'll never get you out of the
[1:28:12] doldrums of doubt and despair what
[1:28:15] you've got to do is say the word is my
[1:28:16] defense and the word has said greater is
[1:28:19] He that is in me than he that is in the
[1:28:21] world the world has said there is laid
[1:28:23] up for me a crown of righteousness all
[1:28:26] those who love his appearing and I sure
[1:28:27] know I've loved his appearing he said we
[1:28:32] have no other defense than the Word of
[1:28:36] God I'm glad it's that way because the
[1:28:39] Word of God is the only thing unchanging
[1:28:43] even the Rock of Gibraltar is not
[1:28:46] unchanging the Word of God is the only
[1:28:50] unchanging thing in the universe the
[1:28:56] Rock of Gibraltar was not always there
[1:28:58] the word was always there
[1:29:03] and so the time of life I shall visit
[1:29:07] thee according to the time of life and
[1:29:10] we don't know you know brother Branham
[1:29:14] talks about it I'm not here to go down
[1:29:16] this this vain to too deeply today just
[1:29:18] want to touch it maybe it seemed like it
[1:29:21] might be cooking for a later sermon but
[1:29:24] you know the time of life because he she
[1:29:28] wasn't pregnant immediately she didn't I
[1:29:29] mean she didn't wasn't it pregnant and
[1:29:31] have a baby immediately but the promise
[1:29:32] was confirmed see and he said I what I
[1:29:36] returned according to the time of life
[1:29:38] you shall embrace his son and you know
[1:29:41] brother Branham gives us these examples
[1:29:44] in the third poll we've we've talked
[1:29:45] about him for years creating squirrels
[1:29:48] actually did that twice saying you know
[1:29:53] to a woman who's burden over her
[1:29:54] children I give you your children see
[1:29:58] and and from that moment those boys fell
[1:30:02] across her knee gave their heart to the
[1:30:04] Lord later back slid then came back
[1:30:06] again see you can't you can't you cannot
[1:30:10] defeat the Word of God it's gonna come
[1:30:12] to pass not nothing can fort his
[1:30:15] purposes God had made a promise ask
[1:30:18] anything
[1:30:18] I don't care what it is just ask it and
[1:30:20] when she asked it God said done signed
[1:30:23] sealed and delivered for all eternity
[1:30:24] that's it case closed were finished you
[1:30:28] understand whatever God would have to do
[1:30:30] you might even have to take him by the
[1:30:31] grave if they had not repented who can
[1:30:33] say but God wouldn't lose them and spoke
[1:30:38] a squirrel
[1:30:39] I'm sorry spoke a storm out of existence
[1:30:42] you know where brother Kevin was sending
[1:30:45] me bulletins today that it's starting up
[1:30:46] now we've got severe storms rolling in
[1:30:49] all the afternoon through the night and
[1:30:50] into tomorrow serious threats as soon as
[1:30:53] church is over we're going to need to
[1:30:55] just disband quickly and and get to our
[1:30:58] places of refuge but there's times that
[1:31:01] that we could say man I if I get to
[1:31:03] speak the storm out of existence there's
[1:31:05] times we've been threatened by
[1:31:06] hurricanes say well why didn't we well
[1:31:08] God didn't but God still protected us

[1:31:19] earnestly sincerely and he and listened

[1:33:32] the family and and then brother Steve
[1:33:34] gets clarity years later and the Lord
[1:33:36] spoke to him you see when you I couldn't

[1:34:01] had been healed under a prophet just
[1:34:02] talking on the phone just just brother
[1:34:06] Brendan said sometimes a call come in on
[1:34:08] the phone
[1:34:09] and he said somebody dying right then
[1:34:11] and he said I go to my knees and he said
[1:34:14] the only thing I can do he said I'm not
[1:34:16] there with him to lay hands on him he
[1:34:17] said so I just start praying and I point
[1:34:19] at that telephone and start praying and
[1:34:22] I don't know you know don't go get go
[1:34:25] get go get some physicist to tell me how

[1:34:33] pointing out a telephone and healing is
[1:34:35] happening thousands of miles away and

[1:34:49] already suffered immeasurably and then
[1:34:52] but God is waiting on a better solution
[1:34:54] and finally one day he's praying and
[1:34:57] he's one more time after he's prayed so
[1:34:59] many times he's right down she's going
[1:35:00] to the doctor she's and and her friend

[1:35:05] the time when she's got a death-defying
[1:35:06] tumour ain't even home he's not even
[1:35:09] with her he's out serving the Lord Jesus
[1:35:12] and he's just committing her to the
[1:35:15] hands of God and the Lord comes says

[1:35:24] doesn't say pray a prayer ask he says
[1:35:27] say what it'll be

[1:35:33] this happened before and he said I say I
[1:35:38] say that before the doctors
[1:35:43] and touches her the I said the hand of
[1:35:48] God will dissolve the tumor before the
[1:35:52] doctors hand can touch it his unfailing
[1:35:56] words of promise
[1:35:57] January 64 I say that before the hand of
[1:36:02] God will dissolve the tumor before the
[1:36:05] doctors hand can touch it and she gets
[1:36:08] up waddles up onto the table and the
[1:36:10] doctor comes in and he moves around and
[1:36:12] he goes - and and there she is can't
[1:36:14] even get on the table it's so bulging
[1:36:16] and he goes to lay his hand and he
[1:36:19] unwraps and feels around miss Branham
[1:36:22] that was on this side wasn't it yes and
[1:36:25] it's not on the other side and it's
[1:36:28] suddenly there and then it's suddenly
[1:36:29] not there
[1:36:30] it suddenly fully formed a demon a tumor
[1:36:34] house for a demon to live in and in an
[1:36:37] instant
[1:36:38] both house and demon are gone now you

[1:36:49] world shaking and falling apart is this
[1:36:52] the time of life that is ready to arrive
[1:36:55] back and say oh we've heard that for
[1:36:57] four years well you're hearing it again

[1:37:08] third pole the third pole is wide open
[1:37:10] the seals the third pole is why shows me
[1:37:12] the message but there's an element of
[1:37:14] the spoken word and I don't know that
[1:37:16] it'll happen all of us or any of us or
[1:37:18] one of us or whoever it will happen to
[1:37:20] but I'm here to tell you that power is
[1:37:22] at your disposal if God should so choose
[1:37:26] your part is not to figure that out your
[1:37:29] part is to serve Him your part is to go
[1:37:32] forward your part is to don't disbelieve
[1:37:34] no matter what the situation is I don't
[1:37:40] care what's happening believe keep

[1:38:16] realized that the heart the arm is the
[1:38:19] bridge between the body and the hand
[1:38:21] it's the hand that does the work but the
[1:38:23] arm has to reach it out there the hand
[1:38:25] can't go crawl and do it itself it needs
[1:38:28] an arm and the arm can't do it it needs
[1:38:29] a body and the body can't do it it needs
[1:38:32] a life inside of it
