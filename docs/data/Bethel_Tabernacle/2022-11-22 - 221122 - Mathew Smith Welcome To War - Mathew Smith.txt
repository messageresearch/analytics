[Music] I desire s [Music] it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight it's always good to be in the house of the Lord um ask that uh Jackson if you could drop my monitors if you wouldn't mind kinda I don't like to hear myself uh but uh yeah it's good it's Thanksgiving week and we're it's always a lot to be thankful for I always it bothers me that it seems like in America we have the holiday season that starts for Halloween and they always have a big Halloween thing and everything's Halloween and then as soon as November first rolls around it's Christmas and Thanksgiving is just not on the calendar somehow and it's almost like it's hard to commercialize a holiday about being thankful for what you have and that's why they don't um so uh yeah it's it's always I always have a soft spot for Thanksgiving because it's always good to be thankful and I guess that's going to be all for the music um we'll we'll have a read our scripture here Ephesians chapter 10. I'm sorry um hang on I don't think it's chapter 10 Ephesians chapter six notes Here there we go foreign chapter 6 and verse 10. finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities means powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places bow our hearts oh gracious and Heavenly Father Lord I come before you this this evening father your servant my heart and mind open to you father that I would bring nothing of of my own but that only that which you would Inspire for these people to hear that they would be able to hear your word tonight and through that word build their faith that in this wicked and dark day that they would be able to stand against the devil and meet him at every turn and would drive him back and would would take that land in their life that you would ordain for them Father that there would be nothing no no stronghold left uncasted down within their life father and we ask these things in your holy and precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you all can be seated so this this verse here um verse 12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world again spiritual wickedness in high places so many times I feel like we read this I mean this is a familiar scripture everyone's heard this we heard it for instance we're in Sunday School and um the way I I feel like many years ago brother Jason did a a thing I think it was might have been Ephesians or Corinthians I don't remember which where he took a chapter and he would put it up on this on the screen and you know he he'd have the what we would think of as you know the the uh our our interpretation of it our our translation of this right and it's you know you have the actual scripture and then our version is like oh well it's this but and we can kind of we can kind of you know skirt the edges here you know it doesn't really mean that well so I would think you know that that the the you know our our in practice interpretation of the scripture would be something like you know um we we wrestle against mental hardships that in some aspect resemble a war it's it's an analogy to war it's a it's a it's a simile of War is it really though right because that's not what the Bible says the Bible says it's a war and it's actually a conflict and because it's a war because it's we we understand that it's a war so it's a real war with real stakes and real risks oh thank you brother kind of need that already um there's there's risk involved in this you know Wars have consequences you know in the olden days when the Mongols are you know riding across the land and burning and pillaging and everything that they come across you know there's there's consequences for losing those battles you know if you're some footmen out there on the fields and and you die and you lose the fight or you you cut and run and abandon the field your home is next and your family and your kids and your wife and everything else and everything that you know and love gets wiped out and taken and enslaved and that's the consequences of War you know and we see this now in in Christian EX in in their spiritual war you know there's there's consequences to losing those spiritual battles those consequences for not being on your game right consequences for not having your sword sharpened ready you know you know we we think oh well it's an analogy to war well you know when your kids are dealing with an addiction and are enslaved to something because there wasn't a strong man in the home to hold the devil back well that's not much of an analogy is it right it's not metaphorical anymore right and so because of this because we don't take it seriously we don't consider the fact that it's an actual War we tend to be Lacks and we don't we're not as diligent we're not on top of things we're not as um you know uh we're not squared away as they say in the military right because you know in the military where there where there's actual you know physical conflict you get that feedback immediately there's no tolerance for being loose right you know I mean literally when when soldiers go in into are going into combat one of the things that Sergeant will do before they go out he'll grab them their chest record and shake them really hard because there's anything rattling around sounds like a cowbell rattling around in your backpack well you can't come with us like that you're they're going to hear you a mile away right you're you know stuff is just you know laying around willy-nilly uh well when artillery starts shaking the ground stuff's gonna fall apart you know it's going to be tight it's going to be strapped down tight squared away organized when bullets are flying you you can't have your stuff just packed in your way it's going to be organized and neat because you don't have time to be figuring it out right well what do we do right we're loose we're loose on security you know they in you know spent 20 years in Afghanistan and Iraq and they'd have to build military outposts in a war zone right they've got House people there for years well when they're there look at their security we're talking concrete walls and barricades and guard towers with searchlights and one way in and out with multiple Gates and redundancies and anybody coming through that gate is going to be is going to be screened and checked if you ain't got papers to be there you get shot right because they're not playing around right right if if the guy's on guard fail their Duty their friends die right well what do we do you know if you're I mean just imagine yourself as some as some guy in charge of security in a in a you know facility in a war zone you know and and you're out out in Afghanistan and there's a you know there's some guy you know he's a I don't know ice cream salesman hanging around your base and he's like hey you know mind if I come in and sell ice cream well who are you so you do a background checking you know he's got no affiliations you know he's he's not involved in anything you know not involved anything uh not a known terrorist or anything but your background checks shows that all his family is all his cousins are all of his friends are everyone he hangs out with is known you know Taliban members will you let that guy in you deserve to be fired probably out of a cannon right because his associations make him suspect but how often will we be like well this particular entertainment isn't bad it's not nothing wrong with it directly but everything associated with it is absolutely poisonous right everything around it every oh you know this well this this sporting is just a sporting event yeah okay but the halftime show is Straight From Hell and you know the the cheerleaders and every ad that you're gonna watch you know while you're watching it is gonna is gonna just completely pollute the minds of everyone involved so everything is associated with it is is toxic but ah well it's just this thing well no it's not right and and we think like oh that's just it's just a sporting thing we just watched the game and it's is it that big of a deal well is it right is it really you know it's like oh you know imagine some guy just hanging out in the battlefield bullets flying around him ah it's just some bullets you know it's just it's just you know oh it's just a martillary it's not a big deal you know it's just as lethal it'll kill you worse than the bullets will you know bullets bullets don't really kill you right they just they just bring you to a a new form of life right uh spiritual corruption will kill you for real kill you in a way that bullets can't and so and part of this is It's because because we end up not training correctly right we don't take it seriously we're not diligent we're not squared away we're not we're not trained properly or we don't allow ourselves to be trained properly and part of that is I I wish I had the picture I tried to send to the booth I just could not make it work so you have to use the power of imagination I'm going to describe it to you it's real simple so imagine this picture right and it's just the ocean blue as far as you can see nice calm glassy sea all the way across under it are the words an epic submarine battle right you can't see it it's there though there's submarines all under you and they're all firing Torpedoes back and forth and it's this crazy epic battle that you can't see now you're standing on a boat it's floating out in the ocean you know on a on your on your you know two-hour Cruise doing your thing but there's a war raging underneath of you now your boat's halfway in and halfway out of that fight yeah right part of you is down there under that surface well we people we're made up of well it's we're Triune being right you have a body this is the thing that everybody sees this is the part sticking up out of the water we're standing on the deck we're seeing what's sticking up out of the water but there's another part of you under that water called your spirit man that has five senses that interacts in that spirit in in that submarine space and you can't really observe that unless you have some special equipment and you have your ears open but doesn't mean the submarine battle isn't there right and it doesn't mean that submarine battle doesn't directly affect your life because if you know enemy sub is there You're Gonna Know It real quick you know it's only a matter of time before suddenly and and you know people who don't have their sonar on don't have their spiritual ears open aren't looking and listening and keeping their eyes open suddenly one day they don't understand why their whole everything just exploded I have no idea is this is a shock well okay it's because there was a there was a war going on that you weren't paying attention to and now you're wondering and you know think think about the in the second world war you have all the um the shipping going across the the ocean to to Europe and the Germans were notorious for running submarines up and down the all through the Atlantic uh hitting unsuspecting cargo ships and they'd be in packs you know just whole fleets of these ships all sailing together and suddenly one of them just explodes and all the other ships because they know what's going you know they know what's going on suddenly they're they weren't paying attention and suddenly one of their friends just explodes so now they now they're all looking for for you know they're now paying attention and so a lot of times you know we're Christians and we're just floating along the Sea of life not paying attention and then when our friends explode we're going what happened well it's because we weren't we weren't looking out for each other we weren't fighting that spiritual battle right we weren't we weren't focused on these things and so it behooves us to really get on our game get squared away and and think about this because again it is not excuse me it is not a metaphorical war that we are in and because it's not a metaphorical it's an actual War it's just fought in a different realm that we're not attuned to we can apply a lot of the same principles and and methodology from physical Warfare into spiritual warfare a lot of the same principles apply right you know we hear that you've heard the phrase the natural types the spiritual which I always thought was interesting that it didn't say the spiritual types the natural right it's it's actually the other way you know you know like I said this mentality of like oh well the spirit war is just a metaphor for this physical War what's actually the other way around right so I want to um because of that you know in taking that that thought I want to kind of take a look at at Warfare in general I'm going to take a big picture of it I'm going to narrow it down ultimately down to sort of the individual and kind of show how how to approach sort of spiritual warfare um through a natural Warfare lens um and so the first thing um I'd like to like to it's a just a sort of a key thing that um anytime you start studying Warfare and especially large scale stuff there's a saying those two sayings I think our um probably key the first one is a is a European Western European military proverb that goes amateurs study strategy or tactics and professionals study Logistics okay what does that mean well Logistics defined by Webster's is the aspect of military science dealing with the procurement maintenance and transportation of military material facilities and personnel and also the handling of the details of an operation okay so in kind of normal people speak that is how do all the stuff get to the battle and how does all the information and how do we communicate right how do the orders move how do the tanks move how do where's all the fuel where's all the bullets where's all the Band-Aids where's all the food how's it getting there okay so going back to this idea that professional study tactics or I'm sorry amateur city tax professional study Logistics you know most people are looking for the outside think oh well learning how to fight a war is all about you know figuring out how to outmaneuver the enemy and our guys are here and their guys are there and how to you know move through this difficult terrain to approach them and all this stuff like nah I mean maybe I mean it's important I'm not saying it's not important but in the grand scheme of things you could have awful tactics and phenomenal Logistics and in the big picture you might lose a lot of battles but you will win the war eventually right I mean again look at the Germans in the second world war they had phenomenal tactics they they were that's the best they completely invented whole doctrines of war that we still use today and that's why they were completely feared especially early on but their logistical infrastructure the the the supply of keeping fuel to the tanks was appalling a lot of people don't realize it was a huge percentage of their supply train was horse and buggy in an age of of trucks right and so they would have these insane offensive pushes where they push hundreds and hundreds of miles in the space of a couple of months and then run out of fuel 30 miles from their objective and then have to sit on their hands for three months waiting for the supply lines to catch up at which point you know it turns winner in Russia and they all freeze to death right and it's all because their tactics were amazing but their Logistics were horrendous okay and so ultimately you look at the other side the Russians they had horrible tactics right Stalin executed all of his generals before the war they had no experience Commanders their tactics were horrific but they're they're Logistics were amazing they had an incredible manufacturing capabilities so they could just lose a lot of battles and they just had more to go right and so spiritually speaking a lot of times we're sitting here thinking about how do we combat the devil in this one particular situation or that particular situation and then we're getting focused on win loss column because we're trying to win all these micro battles but in the reality in the grand scheme of things where you're actually winning the war is logistics is how are you feeding yourself spiritually how are you arming yourself spiritually how are you making sure that the machines of your spiritual warfare are going forward and being fueled because it's it's only a matter of time right now we've completely changed the change the game right you're it's no longer focused on well I lost today well so what we got more there's more where that came from right and the other because the other side of this there's a famous you might have heard of a guy by the name of Sun Tzu literally turned Warfare into an art um Chinese guy ancient Chinese proverb um he has this phenomenal quote and if you get your head around this it applies to so much of life but it goes that um Victorious armies win first and then go to battle and defeated armies go to battle and then seek to win right the idea here being that the wars and battles of your life are one off the battlefield they're one in the months and weeks and days and years of preparation and hard work and diligence and staying on top of things and making sure that you read and prayed and listen to the tapes every single day up until that point right it's it's like a it's like a an athlete I once heard an athlete crazy athletic events all these crazy obstacle courses and he said they asked him you know how do you you know what's it like on race day you know when you're uh you know gonna go out there and perform and he's like you know what the reality is I did not win on race day I won in the months leading up to that when I was in the gym you know doing all these insane exercise routines to prepare myself for that day it's like I won in the months leading up to that race day was just when I got to get the trophy wow right and the reality is most of the time most you know when we're out there trying to fight the devil we've neglected our Logistics and we're wondering why we're getting just murdered why we have no faith got no faith to fight a toothache when was the last time you picked up a Bible right when was the last time you pressed play on a tape and and listened to something edifying when was the last time you chose you know not YouTube like anything else really um you know when was and so this is this is the big picture right this is the big picture of you know if you're gonna win the war this is why we say don't get hung up on win loss column don't get hug on all I lost today well okay today was a was a was a bad day tomorrow's a new one his mercies are new in the morning wake up put on your boots open your Bible pray read turn on the tape do it all over again you know and the thing is and and don't forget everything that you know about logistics so does the devil and he understands that when you're gonna try to break an enemy you're gonna do it by crushing their supply lines so every morning when you go to open your Bible the phone's gonna ring right every morning when you go to do something Something's Gonna Come up the temptation to pick up that phone first thing in the morning is gonna be there right you know the the temptation to distract you he's going to not make it easy but you have to push through right that's why it's a fight so um where am I at here oh goodness time is going um so uh so I want to I want to kind of focus down a little bit farther there's a hopefully not spend too much time on this concept um in you know now that's kind of big picture I want to focus on a little bit farther maybe to something a lot smaller um there is a tool that is used by officers on the battlefield called met TC it's an acronym it's m-e-t-t-t-c okay and it's an acronym that stands for Mission enemy terrain troops and support time and civilian considerations okay these are all the factors of the battle that you need to consider when you are figuring out how to approach this fight okay so let's look at this kind of from top down because you can really apply this spiritually and it'll it's kind of amazing I I was kind of learning about this and I thought to myself you know okay let's try this sort of in a spiritual sense and I was actually very shocked at how how well it helps you kind of approach things um so let's get at the mission right what's your mission and you know you don't you don't want to get too too big and you know uh brought a scale because it's not like well if you're the Infantry man you're not thinking about like what is the mission of the you know entire third Army no it's what is your mission for you right so you know when you're thinking what is my mission well it's not okay we're going in a Rapture okay yeah that is but it's not we're talking about today right what what is your what are you working with today and so the the your mission we might say for for a a a Christian on any given days you know and now maybe you have some specific thing you know specific struggle in your life maybe you're a minister and have some specific spiritual thing that you're approaching maybe you have a mission trip or or something like that or there's a specific need in your life that you're working with you know you can fill that in I'm just saying for the general we can say like a general thing that we would all maybe put here is maybe do your Logistics right it would be nice every day to wake up and read your Bible and pray and spend time with God and listen to tapes and and not be distracted by carnal entertainment and not be distracted by things of the world and just sort of have a nice walk with God today that's our mission for today okay now who's our enemy now I don't know about you but my enemy in this mission is usually the reflection I see in my phone screen when I pick it up right that's usually my biggest enemy in this in this scenario right the guy who's holding the phone the you know and so ultimately you're you're you're fighting against this flesh thing that you're having to drag around right I actually recall um uh uh the um in in in the Bible when it's when it talks about the the man of Flesh that Paul talks about that you're kind of tied to I'm kind of going off the top of my head so I remember exactly what the what the scripture is but um the the uh the the reference that he's making there is actually to an old ancient form of execution where they would shackle a prisoner that would shackle prisoner to another prisoner and then kill the other prisoner and so you have to drag her on a dead body and then as that dead body rots it infects you with the rot and you die horribly it's awful um and so now so this is this is the man of Flesh that we're having to drag around this dead carcass that infects our spirit and our and our soul right and so that's the enemy that you're fighting against and the terrain everybody knows train greatest battle ever fought the battlefield is in your mind right now if I could if I could potentially open your open your field of view a little bit on what exactly that means right because we think well it's you know my feelings and my thoughts and different things and you know we think that the five spiritual senses uh uh things I could do it off my head is a memory affections reasoning conscience and Imagination okay these are five spiritual senses now we think of these as well there's my spirit man over here and then my flesh man over here and there's kind of a line there and they don't cross well hang on a minute memory is one of your five spiritual senses right well imagine a situation where someone's walking along and they get hit on the head and suddenly they have amnesia well they had to damage their physical man but their Spirit man is crippled the spirit man lost a physical or a spiritual sense so there's a there's way more connection there than you think it's all part of the flesh it's all part of the flesh man right it's just an extension of that into like you said it's all part of the same boat just part of it's under the under the surface that you can't see and on the conver the other side of this um I don't have time to really pull them up there's a uh um many scriptures where the brand is dealing with people in in discernment and he talks about oh you know Sister you have you have a heart condition well it's actually a nervous condition right what is it it's a it's a spiritual Affliction that she has it's manifesting through her body and causing her physical damage right so you know when we're when we're um we were talking about the battlefield is in your mind your mind is a lot right your mind is a much bigger thing than just sort of like this ephemeral sort of nebulous concept that kind of floats around your head right it's actually manifests into your body right so also sort of attached to that something to consider especially in this day and age um I just recently was looking into how um recently there was some some new science coming out about how uh the use of antidepressants was actually not as useful as a lot of a lot of the medicine thought they're actually having a hard time replicating the antidepressant effects um now um since after the original studies excuse me um and they said that a lot in a lot of their studies diet and exercise were actually about as on par as an antidepressant pill in terms of of controlling uh depression and in fact a lot of psychiatrists will won't even give you pills until you do some major diet and exercise changes so what this is telling me is that you know we'll be going around having all kinds of depression issues and all kinds of spiritual battles and anxiety and different things think oh man I'm under such a you know spiritual warfare while you're eating what you know it's like um there's a really eye-opening experience if you ever go to Flagstaff there's a big um big grain silo with a Purina dog food logo on it the red and white square checkered thing and if you're driving and you see this thing oh there's the Purina plants where they make dog food and then when you go up to the front gate of that thing on a little bitty sign next to it it says Nabisco Foods and literally the same plant that manufactures uh Purina kibble for your dog is the same place that makes Cheez-Its um so just consider just consider that the next time you're eating a cheese it um no the the reality is you know we'll sit there and stuff our face with stuff that we would be offended by if it was in a different package um that's just the reality and and we're eating this stuff and wondering why do I have all these major mental problems that I'm having those because your body is screaming for some nutrients it doesn't even know how to make the chemicals that make you feel okay right you're so you know have all kinds of chemical imbalance in your head because your nutrition is trash we're in the standard American diet of dog food um you know and so and so again like so we're not considering that your spiritual battles a lot of times we're being fought on your dinner plate yeah so um I mean there's a just consider maybe there's a reason Jehovah took so much care and what the the Israelites ate just saying I don't want to I don't want to spend too much time on that it's just supposed to be a side note um believe me and if anyone feels attacked I am pointing at myself way more than anybody else um so uh uh anyway so um moving down um in our considerations how to approach things you have your civilian considerations at the end of that oh I'm sorry there was time time was the other important thing um typically time your time frame when you're out you're approaching a battle how much time do you have to work with this right really depends what your goals are depending on whether you're attacking or defending if you're defending you want to drag this out as long as possible you want them to spend as much of their fuel as much as their bullets as much as their whatever their resources trying to approach your position as you possibly can that's why you send all kinds of traps and landmines and barbed wire and stuff out there so it slows them down right well if you're on the attack you want to be there like right now right you don't want a bunch of time lingering out in the middle of No Man's Land when you get shot right well think of this spiritually the devil is always defending he's Banning the gates of hell right there's those gates of hell that are keeping you in I'll come back to that case of hell don't keep you out to keep you in right um and he's that's why it's everything's a Time waster you ever notice that those things that always wind you up are time wasters isn't it odd that biggest time waster on Earth is called Tick Tock um right Big D's isn't it interesting that all of these things are done like you know you pick up your phone to and end up on YouTube and then suddenly you go oh wow 45 the 45 minutes of my day that I had to read my Bible and pray are gone right they're time wasters it's it's things that are going to bog you down and slow you down because you're on the attack you're assaulting the gates of hell and he's trying to wind you up in barbed wire in spiritual barbed wire right so don't get caught up in that just go around that stuff don't get caught in it because you need to be on target immediately right when you're on the attack when you're when your goal is logistics right when your goal is okay I'm gonna read my Bible I'm going to pray I'm going to do these things I'm going to have my walk with God I'm going to get out ahead of the devil you got to be on your game from the word go right because you give him a single second he's going to shut you down okay and then you have considering consideration I'm going to try to move past a lot of this uh I just you know consider just consider um you know when you're losing spiritual battles um and you're you've let your attitude become foul to the point where you you know chew out the cashier at the grocery store for shortchange and you 25 cents and completely trash your testimony you've now made that person a collateral damage in your spiritual war crash your testimony with that person right so you know just consider these things be be aware of the way that you're of the way you're handling your Warfare don't be too heavy-handed with things you know there's there's a way to especially with witnessing there's a way to approach people that isn't weak and isn't compromising but isn't so heavy-handed that you just crushed them there's a balance to that you know be careful that you're not you're not just you know mowing people down because you're just really going to let them have it about the you know this this Ultra Revelation that you have okay well hey there's a time and place for everything I'm sure that Ultra Revelation is great at certain points but maybe you know maybe be careful with the way that you're you're blasting people um and so there's a I saw a uh what's the presentation of an army officer describing how to how do you combine the the Met TC principles into an actual real world situation and use the example of a um of a training exercise where some of his guys that he's training um we're assaulting a uh a fortified position and they they got all hung out and out in the wide open we're just getting shot to bits by the simulation rounds and they get all frustrated no this is just a this is a disaster and I've quit and he's like all right well hang on let's let's think about this for a minute you know is what's your you know what's your mission well my mission is to get the bad guys well are you doing that no okay so you know Christians what's your mission well read my Bible and pray have a walk with God have a clean life why are you doing that no okay well maybe we're doing something wrong all right you know and he's like all right well what's your problem well they're over there in in you know and he just he just goes down the line I'm gonna try to skip over some of it but um you know well the terrain they have better terrain well you know I need I need uh you know they're just more fortified than I am okay well where would you be more fortified well over there okay why don't you go for there right you know hey um I'm just getting killed because I'm not you know spiritually wiped out because I'm not in a place that's spiritually conducive right I'm hanging out in areas that have bad spirits we'll move right it's not that hard um it's not that complicated I mean it might be difficult spiritually that's why it's a fight but it's sometimes you got to just grit your teeth and do it um you know you and you know he talks about well I don't have the I don't what's on my side right and he has the uh Soldier what's what kind of troops and support what kind of equipment you have at your disposal it's like what would you need he's like well I would need a bazooka to get those guys out of there well do you have a bazooka no so okay that's plans out find another way to do this well you need you know you're approaching this this obstacle in your life the spiritual stronghold in your life and you keep ramming your head into it you know you've got some difficult thing that you just cannot get over right you know um oh I've got some some uh and I'm not and bear in mind remember the whole context of this is there are people who are legitimately trapped in really difficult situations like addiction and and disease and things that they cannot get rid of and those are real strongholds and sometimes you approach that and you just slam your head into it and go I have this thing that I cannot stop doing and I've butt my head into this over and over and over again I get slaughtered every time well maybe stop doing that just don't back up a minute and this is the solution to this to this poor soldier's problem his office like look just back up you have time you have time those guys over there they're hiding in those rocks they don't have time you can sit right here and you can wait and you can pick up the phone and you can call your platoon commander and say Commander Lieutenant I've got a problem can't get these guys out could you bring up some reinforcements maybe some murders and deal with this and you can sit here all day to wait for it right and so many times Christians will sit there and beat their head against the problem trying to resolve this and they get just beat all the Thunder and instead they need to stop back up sit down and call the commander and say Lord I've got a problem that I can't handle right pick up the phone and call some reinforcements call your pastor there's a novel idea call call your family get some people to join together with you in prayer and team up on this devil right do something that's not just beating your head into it and making yourself feel like a like a failure right do something different call the Lord and then once you do once you call the commander that doesn't mean you go charge it again you wait until the commander shows up and deals with the problem it's almost like the Bible says to wait upon the Lord right you it's not that complicated go forth in faith strike out and when you come to a problem that you just can't overcome call your commander and get some backup and he will show up it might be a while you're you might turn this into a Siege sieges can last years right and I mean that like sometimes you got a real spiritual problem maybe you have a chronic disease that will not go away and that might take some years of waiting which you don't give up don't just abandon the position right you you just hold your ground and you continue to confess you continue to confess your testimony that of healing and it'll happen right and so I I wanted to take all of this and kind of if I could wrap it up and go in a little bit longer than what I had planned I want to hit one one final thing and kind of wrap it up on this and I want to think you know maybe apply this to a spiritual a real thing that I identify with a lot that would be Jonah because a lot of times you know we have all this idea we can think about oh we're going to plan and we're going to you know approach this problem this way and we got to plan to deal with it um Mike Tyson has a great line everyone's got a plan until they get punched in the face right and it's all fine well and good to have this plan oh we're going to organize ourselves in this way and we're going to approach this thing and yeah well okay and then Monday morning you get punched in the face right what is that and then you fall completely flat and then you're laying on your back going oh well that went horribly and you thought you did everything right and you're still wiped out and so now we want to get down into the down into the trench right what does it look like so I'll find well and good to think about what it looks like in the office tent what does it look like in the trench right because a lot of the times in the trench where things are really bad is when you're in a really ugly situation that you put yourself in right there's a um you know we talk about the the whole armor of God and it's you know beautiful and you obviously put on the whole number of God and it's but when you're assaulting gates in medieval times there's a nasty little trick they would do is dump boiling oil or water on the attackers because it goes down under your armor and Cooks you in your armor a lot of the times we have all your salvation got your righteousness your Shield of faith and your sword and your your helmeted truth and all this stuff and you assault that Gate of Hell and it just cooked you in your armor and you're sitting there laying on your back going well I thought I was righteous and there's that devil going oh wow what a what a good Christian you are you know just really grinding it in and that's where I feel like a lot of times we end up like Jonah because Jonah Jonah was a has a special kind of a story um in which um if you could go ahead and pull up Jonah chapter 2 verse 1. um because Jonah was told to do something and then he just didn't do it not only did he not do it he went and did the opposite and then he gets himself into a situation where he has completely rejected God and what God told him to do so badly that the Judgment of God is falling on him and not only falling on him but falling on a bunch of unaffiliated Sailors that had nothing to do with it and they're all going to die now because Jonah didn't want to do what God told him to do and so Jonah recognizes this and says well I can't let these innocent people die because of my stupidity so I'm going to give them the instructions on how to execute me it's not like Jonah knew there was going to be a fish right Jonah wasn't getting tell him to bind his hands and feet and throw him overboard because he was thinking oh well you know there's gonna be a fish down there and I'm going to wind up in Nineveh no Joe 's like no no they need to kill me kill me God can not kill them right Jonah's suicidal right Jonah is like I need to the the right thing for me to do right now is die right yeah and we get there I've been there you know the right thing to do this moment is die which is true you should be dying to yourself every day and the the reality and so they throw Joan overboard and then he you know goes down the water and they he's he's drowning in a great fish swallows him and then he finds himself in the belly of this fish and uh he's got this I mean you want to talk about a tough spot that he put himself in by the way I mean not only did he do all the circumstances that led up to him feeling like he needed to go in the water he then gave them the instructions to how to throw him there right he literally architected this whole thing so if you could pull up that uh I just want to I just want to read because now he's in there he's in the in the in the in the fish's belly and he prays this prayer it says then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly and said I cried by reason of my Affliction unto the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I and thou hurtest my voice for thou has cast me into the deep in the midst of the Seas and the floods compassed me about all thy Billows and thy waves passed over me and then I said I am cast out of thy sight yet will I look again toward thy Holy Temple the waters can pass me about even this even to the soul the depth closed me round about the weeds were wrapped about my head I went down to the bottoms of the mountains the Earth with her bars was about me forever yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption O Lord my God when my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord and my prayer came in unto thee into thine Holy Temple they that observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord and the Lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land the other day I read that that verse where it says um they that observe lying vanities reject their own Mercy and it so struck me because here's a man who I mean of all the audacity right the unmitigated goal of this man to literally throw himself in this situation be eaten by a fish be pitch black blind as a bat with seaweed wrapped around his head I don't know I don't imagine it's very roomy inside of a fish's belly either right it's kind of cramped and he's looking all around him feeling the crushing of the fish's stomach and going lying vanities lying vanities it's not real it's just fake what right and how many times do we get ourselves into a situation right it says that that he was in the belly of hell that we have so failed as Christians just completely just made a hash of it and so badly that hell has manifested around us do exactly what we know is wrong do exactly what we knew God told us not to do and now like Samson having gone and found a a Philistine Harlot has to use the gifts and the Deliverance of God to get himself out and here we are throw ourselves into the belly of hell and go you have the audacity to get yourself out right to pray is that really what you want to do you deserve that you deserve Deliverance after everything that you did answer is no you don't that's why it says they reject their own Mercy because Mercy isn't for people who deserve it right Mercy is when somebody can punish you and they choose not to Mercy is when you deserve everything that you're getting and the creator of the universe says no it's not going to go that way Mercy is for people who get themselves into an absolute meat grinder deserve every inch of it completely I get everything they got coming and delivered anyways because they looked at that situation and said you know it's not about me it's about the fact that the word of God says something the word of God says he's my deliverer and he doesn't say exactly what he's delivering me from the reality is he could have been delivering you from yourself as much as anything else right it doesn't say what you're supposed to be delivered from or what the judgment is it just says that if you reject those lying vanities and say no God said I could be an overcomer the word says I'm an overcomer and even though my actions might be the lying vanities that I am rejecting they're still lying vanities I'm going to reject them right these Temptations in my life these things that seem to oppress me that I can't get away from this this addiction that I fostered that I partook in that's a lying vanity and I'm rejecting it and no matter hey and when he said this the the fish's belly didn't just poof disappear he was in it for a while still right it didn't just go away you know and ultimately all of this is is coming down we can stand to our feet musicians come ultimately this is a type it's all the type the story of Joan is a type going down into the fish's belly is a type Christ going down in the belly of hell right it's not gonna and you think you know the the Bible says that that Jesus had to learn obedience through the things that he suffered that's an interesting thought that here's Jesus you think he you know he's perfect never failed and yet he still had to learn right didn't didn't um just uh whatever comes to your heart um and so ultimately you know when he when he's when he's down going down into hell he has to hold on to the promise the only reason why Christ came back and resurrected is because he had to hold on to the promise there was going to be another Resurrection there was going to be a resurrection the Bible said that he wouldn't leave his soul in hell and so he had to go to hell stand there and look Satan in the eye surrounded by billions of devils screaming in his face and say lying vanities and Christ had to go to hell believing his own word that he'd come back out because if he didn't he wouldn't have just all there is to it right it was and so we because that's our example we we allow these things into our lives but the reality is if Christ had to be learned to be subject to the word then we have to learn to be subject to the word we have to learn that you know it's not about me and my failures I'm still going to subject what I confess to the word even though I don't deserve it and that's um that's that's the battle I wanna I wanna read a quote just leave you with this you know I've gone over I apologize um went a little longer than I intended there's a quote from the greatest battle ever fought it's one of my all-time favorite things I've ever read [Music] um says if you come and you keep their memories and conscience and everything thinking about well I might fail I might not be right don't you do that at all you throw aside everything and open up the channel and say God your word is eternally true and it's for me if the whole church fails if the whole world fails yet I can't fail because I'm taking your word and so whatever need you have in your life whether it's overcoming whether it is just just having that closer walk with God whatever that is you say the promise is there for me God made the promise and his word can't fail and if everything else falls apart even if I fall apart tomorrow that doesn't matter that's a lying vanity and I claim the promise and to the day after tomorrow will be another day another day to to to carry on so thank you all for for listening and uh we'll uh bless that that the word found you uh would Age you going forward and have a word of prayer father I thank you for this opportunity to opened my heart and opened that channel father and I trust that you would have taken something that I would have said tonight and found an open heart in the audience tonight father those who would have heard it would have been able to apply it to some situation father they would be able to take it and stand in this dark and evil day father we as he would Bless the people and and anoint their doings and any traveling that would that would take place father that people would be protected and they would go forth in the in the grace of your word father me ask these things in Jesus name amen foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] if you don't grow the math you made one comment that just stuck with me so much out of it more than anything that what he said and he said he was going to elaborate and he never got back to it so I have to get a get that another time but he said the gates of hell he said we're not something that you would break not not that you're breaking into hell but it's the gates of hell is something that holds you in and boy that transforms the entire your entire thought of what the Bible what Jesus meant when he said I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't hold them in can't keep them in they're gonna come out doesn't matter what Gates the devil's put on you or what prison he's put on you the gates of hell can't hold you in just as they couldn't keep Jesus in the grave and keep Jonah in a belly of a well amen no child of God can stay in that prison his brother Brandon says House of Hell give way in the name of Jesus Christ amen we want to take up the needs uh prayers just before we go and and let you be dismissed from brother Aaron Simmons says Enoch luck uh brother brother Enoch has a double ear infection so we want to remember brother Enoch tonight and also need to put in a prayer request for my dad his back is hurting him quite a bit quite badly and the VA is refusing to give him his

also from brother Mark Carter prayer request for Sarah she has a headache she's dizzy and has a fever my goodness well we know a god who's greater than any of these symptoms amen why don't you just raise a hand if you have an unspoken prayer request something before the Lord hold it up as we join our faith together Lord father we come before you this this evening father of needy people Lord we're standing on that promise that you gave father that that atonement that you made father 2 000 years ago that blood ran down and paid the price for our healings forever for eternity that Eternal sacrifice and because of that promise because of that paid price we can stand here and claim our healing for all of these situations we can stand in the gap for our our our our spiritual family father these these Brothers and Sisters in Christ father Sister Sarah Carter with this headache father you know you walked the Earth as a man and had a headache and know how it is and so in in Your Love

word said it must and follow this this uh brother Aaron's father with his harmed back father I know I've had broken uh or or injured back father and you've healed me I know what it's like to be laid up because you can't move and father I know what it feels like to have that whole healing power come down and raise you up and so I know that if you did that for me then you must do it again if the requirements are met and so we we lay claim to that promise father and our brother dear brother Ken father not feeling well yet again that healing blood flows and and atones for any uh any any illness or or ill effect father and this this woman father who who uh uh had her son with a bicycle accident Lord we ask that your your healing Grace would go forward that would atone in this case father that that perhaps the healing in this poor man's body might open a door the healing for his soul the greater healing might take place father for the Lord you know that this healing in his body may be temporary he he may die in yet still but that if that healing in his soul could go forward father that would be the greater healing for it would heal him for all eternity that it would be an eternal life father so that's what we cling to and Lord our sister Saint John Sister Lisa uh requesting prayer for for Samuel brother or brother Samuel and Judah who are sick with this possible coveted father this this demon Specter that has plagued the Earth father we reject that we reject that any fear that would be associated with that we reject any anxiety associated with that as nothing but anointment of the devil and we pray for deliverance and healing in this situation that all those who would be affected would not be would would be healed and that anyone exposed would not have fear of of of infection father Lord we we we claim these things not not because of anything that we did but because of that great work that you did Father that you said it and and we simply stand on the promise that you made show that your word might be glorified by the by the Fulfillment of your own word so we ask these things before in your in your holy and precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
