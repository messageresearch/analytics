[Music] in [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good good morning everyone God bless you we got the Powerpoint up perfect Let's uh let's stand as we read the word continuing in our subject a word family part four and we'll turn I'll go back to that Ephesians 6:4 and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord let's pray Heavenly Father we just Commit This Time To You Lord and we ask that your Holy Spirit would come and speak to us and and deal with us in a supernatural way Lord help us to lay the word in order here in our hearts and help help us to be open to wisdom and understanding and correction Lord we give ourselves to you in Jesus name amen God bless you I came across this on uh Instagram the other day and uh I had to save it CS Louis says children are not a distraction from more important work they are the most important work amen and that goes for anyone you could say what about what about the preacher what about the pastor again we said it before is you cannot be a qualifi I mean you can preach because a church will take any old person but a true ano true church with a true anointed man of God disqualifies himself when he does not is unable to lead his family properly so you can't put the you can't put the cart before the horse oh he's a minister I mean it doesn't matter what his family is actually it directly matters it directly impacts and if if the movement of the message would have been more serious about qualified ministers with their houses in order there wouldn't be so many false doctrines false teachings and destruction of lives that have taken place because of this mis false understanding a home not in order is a man who's not fit to lead the church period end of story so what is the man's most important work it's to lead his family it's to it's to nurture his family it's do it's to follow Christ and be the leader of the home you know we look at this scripture and and uh many commentators say oh he's implying that that uh mothers should do it too well he is but you you you that's not what he's actually saying he's telling the fathers are responsible so the father cannot shovel it off to Mom it's that's not the that's not the purpose the father must take authority in the home we spoke before about headship you know know yes men and women are equal in value in the sight of God but there is a hierarchy in the home absolutely is a hierarchy and me men are to be leaders it goes so far as commending Sarah for calling Abraham Lord see we we think that's funny in America and in the western world but it it it's the Scripture A man is in a position of authority and God so designs that he is to do good unto those that are under his authority he is to be a means of nurture and admonition to his family he's to be a means of provision and wisdom to his family if you look at this word nurture I said before his brothers say well I'm not a good teacher well too bad you signed up for the job even if you didn't know it because this word nurture is pidea theer's definition is the whole training and education of children which relates to the cultivation of mind and morals and employs for this purpose Now commands and admonitions now reproof and Punishment it's also the training and care of the body so it goes far beyond just like we we use the term nurture and it's more of a feminine attribute really but this word nurture is speaking of training and teaching so the job of a father is to train and teach not only his sons because it doesn't bring it doesn't bring a difference between Sons and Daughters Sons and Daughters he is responsible for both the teaching the education the upbringing but also the admonition admonition speaks of uh when bringing correction within teaching bringing correction upon them and so the Bible makes fathers responsible for this and as we spoke before it's not good for a man to be alone I will make him and help meet for him and so mother is to enter into this Vision to be helper of the father see that's why he says fathers is because it's Father's primary role he cannot Advocate that role to anyone else amen right but mother is the helper in this purpose and vision for the family amen and that's our most important job our number one most important job as fathers is to do this very thing it's it's providing financially absolutely but never at the expense of this if we say I'm the provider and it's it's at the expense of taking Authority in the home home there's a problem same thing with it doesn't matter if it's Ministry doesn't matter if it's a job it doesn't matter what it is you cannot surrender all of that job and that purpose so when you're done with work what's your job you don't lose responsibility it's not time to go home and drink beer and watch the sports it's time to go home and do this amen this is your job this is your purpose this is your life mission this is your vision it's the leg Legacy that you leave behind you as brother Matt preached about before you're going to leave a legacy it just could be garbage and trash Legacy or it can be the life and reality of Christ manifested in the form of a multiplied you and your wife that's God's purpose all right so um I think I'm going to come back to the sacred trusts we've reviewed them before now actually let's go let's go there uh we'll speak of them because it's uh it's connected now we talked about a woman is given these three sacred trusts but we also must remember that the father is the one responsible and we read that in the scripture as we as we cover this though the though though his daughter is given the sacred trust the father is the is the one that is supposed to be the guardian of that sacred trust the edge indicator of that sacred trust in all the details so we ultimately find that in the Bible God lays it at the feet of dad to ensure this is what is passed on doesn't lay it at the feet of mother she's there at the side of her husband but it's her husband to take responsibility so from invisible Union notice now we find her body as the bedding grounds and therefore it's a sacred trust not to defile that that's the first one the second one she has a sacred Trust of virtue committed to her by her Lord a certain virtue nothing else holds it but a woman right that's committed to her by God she must not defile that virtue and the third one now we find out she has been given this sacred trust that she must not break of Womanhood act have her character raise her children be honorable to her husband so three sacred trusts young ladies you should memorize this all all sisters should know this that are following the message of the hour it's your body one your virtue two and your Womanhood three so your body keep your body pure your virtue that's your ability to say yes or no it's your your strength and Womanhood it's the character and conduct before your UH children and husband or your father could say all right and so let's look in the scripture Deuteronomy 22 these are some very plain scriptures but it's the word of God and it's an important point that we need to understand if any man take a wife and go in unto her and hate her and give occasions of speech against her and bring up an evil name upon her and say I took this woman and when I came to her I found her not a maid then shall the father of the damsel and and her mother take and bring forth the tokens of the damsels virginity unto the Elders of the city in the gate and the damsels father shall say unto the elders I gave my daughter unto this man to wife and he hates her and lo he's given occasions of speech against her saying I found not thy daughter a maid and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity and they shall spread the cloth before the Elders of the city and the Elders of that City shall take the man and chastise him do you know what this means they'll take that man seize him and say you're you're lying you're bringing a bad name upon a virgin of Israel and it's not just oh you're a bad guy they will beat him this is what this word is saying he's to be beaten with a rod for bringing a bad name upon a virgin of Israel so this is God's Viewpoint of the character of a woman if if if a man is going to speak against the character of a woman it's responsible for the father and the elders to uphold Purity and speaking correctly about women am right and so the man will first thing we go to the elders we're going to deal with this publicly you're trying to shame my daughter now they shame him not only beat him but he should pay some pay a fine and they shall immerse him in a 100 shekels of silver and give them ah unto the father of the damsel because he brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel and she shall be his wife he may not put her away all his days by saying this God has has so clearly made it clear is be sure about what you're doing be sure about her you're following the leading of the Lord about who you're marrying and be sure that as a father you deliver your daughter as a virgin to the man that she is going to be married to right so this is this is putting it so critical because the next part is if she's not if she's not it's horrible it's a horrible result and it's a horrible thing so here the man is shamed publicly shamed and told to fine but if this thing be true and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house and the many men of her City shall Stone her with stones that she die because she's wrought Folly in Israel to play the in her father's house so shalt thou put evil away among you so we see again it was fraud they they've committed virginal fraud you've said okay I'm delivering this the father is delivering his daughter to a man and lying about it and finds oh she's not a virgin the the penalty is death you say my goodness it's it's a harsh thing yes it is because it's that serious it's a life and death matter God wants to God demands to see the purity of our daughters right and so you know again we've talked about this being a father the headship of a man can be also can be not used and he becomes a or it can turn into something where it's a damaging thing right God is not in either of those sides of things he's not he he condemns an effeminate man that surrenders the leadership of his home to his wife and the leadership of his children to his wife but he also condemns the overbearing man that would say oh my daughter has to be a virgin let's lock her up in the shed let's let's beat her up so that she knows that's a perversion people take demented people take the take the word and pervert it both directions right the bride of Christ is not going to do this amen a man is told to instruct his children and correct them right he's not told to beat them and abuse them he is told to spare the rod and you hate the child right that's in a season of life but teaching is primary beating is the last resort even if it's the scriptural form of corporal punishment in a in a home the first Resort is not yelling and uncontrollable Behavior that's anger and and it's condemned by the scripture a fruit of the spirit is self-control so when we're correcting our children it demands kindness fruit of the spirit self-control fruit of the spirit so when you're angry and flying off the handle that's not showing the fruit of the spirit that's just teaching your children that it's okay to be out of control and to be angry no it's teaching and instruction is the first order of fatherhood amen and so we can understand then the the value and the importance that God places on Purity and so as a father this should be age appropriately the vision that you're putting forth in your family with the help of your wife for the more sensitive issues that go along with this but the reality is it shouldn't be something that's off topic for a father to speak to his daughters about for it's his duty to ensure that she is pure so she has to even know what that means all right Exodus 22:16 and if a man man entice a maid that is not betrothed and lie with her he shall surely endow her to be his wife and if her father utter utterly refus to give her unto him he shall pay money according to the dowy of virgins again it is the Father's authority over his daughter we spoke before we let's let's take a short Side Track into courtship our modern idea of Disney courtship is not anything to do with the Bible following our heart and falling in love and all of these things uh these are not in the scripture now the scripture does not say you must have an arranged marriage or you must not have an arranged marriage but the scripture very clearly puts the authority of daughters into the hands of their father and so therefore as as a guardian of purity the father should not allow any young man to speak to his daughter unless it is first prayerfully decided by the father with along with his daughter see of course he needs to understand where her heart is at in all of this but it's supposed to come through him our modern way of doing this even how it's creeped into the message where we've used social media to bypass the word of God it's wrong it's wrong it's sinful it's against the word of God it's against the authority of the father and these things need to be taught and established by preachers and also fathers in the home there is no such thing as a daughter having a love life apart from her father until she's married because what are daughters daughters don't marry daughters are given in marriage Sons take the risk take the authority go out and find someone's daughter to get married to daughters wait upon the Lord pray make themselves ready right and then under their father's Authority that is when courtship and engagement takes place but it's through the authority of the father and any kind of modern Innovation to that we need to get away from that because it's not scriptural because it's exactly what the word said they're given in marriage and even even to the point as we read before headship headship in modern Christianity of the man is little more than just a word but in the scripture we find that headship means decision making as we read before I believe it was in uh numbers 30 you can read it yourself that any decision a man's wife or daughter would make he can invalidate according to the scripture he can say nope you're not doing that and she if she wants to be an obedient wife she says okay she might she might not agree and she might be able to voice her opinion why she doesn't agree but ultimately by the word it requires a wife to be obedient it requires a daughter to be obedient to what her father says I know it's not popular I know it's not what the denominational world says but we're not going by the denominational World we're not going by feminism this is an attack against God's word we have to go back to the word and follow that right you love me still even if you don't I don't care right brother Luther we're going to go by the word and we're going to go by what's right as for me in my house we will serve the Lord think of a man took the authority to say that he didn't say dear wife could could our house serve the Lord would it be okay with you he said we will serve the Lord and he takes the authority that's necessary to do it and a good obedient wife says I will submit to my husband and I'll reverence my husband amen all right 1 Timothy 2:9 instructions to Women In Worship and in the home in like manner also that women Adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broided hair or gold or pearls or costly array you wouldn't know it by modern Christianity but the Bible commands a woman to dress modestly that means she can't parade herself around in a bikini that means she can't parade herself around in yoga pants in public it's a public perversion if people were right in their mind those women would be covered up and arrested and taken away and put away because they're insane it's an absolute affront to common decency the way women dress today so the Bible says modest apparel the word apparel is the word catasto it's a compound word Kata means letting down and stole was the common Garment of the day for the Greeks in the Greek language so what does it mean catasto means a long dress is is the correct way of looking at this this word so it's a long dress that's character ized by modesty so a long dress that fits your body does not qualify as being modest clothing in the beginning was was to be that which covers the body not that which reveals the body the first clothing designers Adam and Eve made for themselves a bikini just to cover their private parts and God said when the presence of God came they ran and what did they say hey we hit ourselves cuz we were naked so even with their bikini on they realized they were in a state of undress they were in a state of nakedness so what did God do he clothed them with coats of skins coats of skins coat is the Hebrew word coutet and it what did what did it do it always covered from the neck down to below the knees and for dress occasions it always went to the ground for work occasions it went went just below the knees and this is revealing to us that clothes are designed for to cover nakedness amen not revealing nakedness all right then he says also that they adorned themselves in modest apparel modest long dress with shamefacedness and sobriety so shamefacedness speaks of being shy so a a woman's character outward character should be a expressed as in in a way of being sober and shy so that that's the outward expression the outward expression of the inward condition of the heart so shyness and modesty are on the inside should be expressed in the outward then he says not with broided hair or gold or pearls or costly array now he's not saying you can't braid your hair if you look at what brother brandham says he speaks of this as there was a style of hair in fact if you look at the details they took strands of gold and pearls and they braided it into their hair to show their wealth and it was a very immodest and ungodly thing to do and Paul is speaking to that specifically not that hair can't be braided no but that with that the that in there it was it was speaking of something that was very immodest all right but which becometh women professing godliness with good works the way she dresses and the way she acts it should speak outwardly of a woman that professes godliness with good works amen so I want to hold that thought there good works because we're going to come back to that as we get to the last um towards the end of uh 1 Timothy 2 let the woman and learn in Silence with all subjection needs no interpretation this is what the word says you're welcome to say amen hallelujah shout and dance and run up and down the aisles that's that's wonderful you're welcome to when it's the the time is in order speak in tongues interpret tongues and prophesy and so forth but you're not in a position to be a teacher right that's what the scripture says but I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence this is not only speaking of the home it's also speaking of the church and it's also speaking of in society in general a woman is not to be put in a position of authority no matter where it is over the man but to be in silence in another place it says if a woman has questions let him ask at home um at one point in time you know the the the early church when a teacher would get up and preach people would actively ask questions or even say oh but what about this scripture so this was a process that would happen and what what Paul in 1 Timothy 2 and also in 1 Corinthians 14 is saying when the teaching is going on a woman should be quiet and if she has any questions it's she should ask her husband at home that's the scripture that's offensive to this modern world but it's exactly what the word says we don't go by feminism we go by the word amen why Paul why should we do this oh because culture says so culture demands it no creation order Adam was first formed then Eve and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression so Paul takes what was applicable to Adam and Eve and he applies it to EV all men and all women so how does he do that why should woman not preach well he's telling you right now women are more easily deceived than men oh how do you dare you say that women and men are exactly the same they're not God didn't create them the same he created men and women differently with different roles and why is the the it's the spirit of the age is what it is why would we be offended by that it is the absolute it's probably the one of the most clearest and easy to understand doctrines that the Bible puts forward is the position of a man and the position of a woman it's not complicated it's not difficult to understand it is difficult for people to swallow why because they've been under 140 years of f feminism that's why it's difficult to swallow and because all media and all all entertainment and all uh news agencies and every book that you read and every article that you read practically is preaching feminism and it's all a lie from the pit of Hell and it's Satan trying to infiltrate the message of the hour to make young ladies discontent with the place that God has put them in in fact it's the most glorious position for a woman amen notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and Holiness with sobriety now strange scripture everyone reads that and goes what is it talking about so it's not talking about well when she's bearing when she's giving birth she'll be safe because we're still under the curse and there's women that die there's Christian Godly Christian women that die in childbirth it's not speaking about that if you look at the word in it's actually really speaking about the word through so we're not women are not saved from childbearing they're not saved by bearing children they're saved by grace through faith it's by the blood of Christ Alone through faith alone however remember says if they continue how did it how did we read that not not with braided hair gold or cost way but but which becometh women professing godliness with good works so works is Faith Express okay so when when you're speaking about good works there's good works that a woman is ordained to fulfill in her life life and they would be distinct and different than the good works a man would now many of them overlap but there are some specific ones that don't overlap and so when we look at this is you're talking about um show me show me your faith see we're talking about outward expression so there's always has to be good works that accompanies genuine Born Again Faith so when you're filled with the Holy Ghost it's is going to produce Works in you so what are the works that are produced in a woman they're different than a man it's through keeping of the home it's through childbearing right so these are the works that God has designed for a woman to do and they're to be done what in faith and agape love and Holiness with sobriety so these are the works that God has ordained a woman to do and it's not a shameful thing it's not a bad thing it's a glorious thing I I could say for myself as a man there's two people in the world that are more precious to me than anyone and it's first my wife she
