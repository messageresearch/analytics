that it would reach to hearts that it would do something lord that would give strength and healing and deliverance father lord we know that that doesn't lay in us as humans lord but that lays in the power and authority of the word lord you've given us a commission not to preach ourselves but to preach christ to preach the word lord and that word is sent to heal the people lord and us as ministers as well lord we have need of you we're not sufficient of ourselves we ask these things in jesus name amen god bless you all my wife is back home very happy for that i feel like a human being again a complete human being again was was half of one i think for the last couple weeks so thank you to everyone that helped me and and and took care of me appreciate you all and amy's parents are doing much better there's still some way to recovery to go but thank the lord they're out of out of the danger dangerous place and and um just on the road to recovery so pray continue to pray for them amen so i'm going to speak on a subject tonight overcoming depression and the scripture that i'm going to start with is proverbs 12 25. and i'm not sure if you can pull it up back there but i'm going to read from the nkjv if you can't no problem you'll see it there in the kjv and i'll read to you the nkjv anxiety in the heart of man causes depression but a good word makes it glad amen may the lord have the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated so write in that verse if you want to leave that verse up for me brother right in that verse we have the problem the source of the problem and the solution to the problem we read the word we can close and go home it's over with but the reality is the reality is there's there's a lot there's a lot to it and that there's a lot that goes along with that but yeah you see their heaviness in the heart of man makes it stoop it's a it's a beautiful picture or a terrible picture of what depression is really but it's a it's a it's a good picture that's painted their anxiety in the heart so in other words anxiety produces depression and the anxiety that we have can have lots of different sources so what does anxiety mean i think we all know what it means it comes in heaviness doesn't it sometimes you even feel such a heavy feeling in your spirit in your just bodily you feel that heavy feeling inside of you but in webster's dictionary it says concern respecting some event future or uncertain which disturbs the mind and keeps it in a state of painful uneasiness it expresses more than uneasiness or disturbance and even more than trouble or solicitude it usually springs from fear or serious amp apprehension of evil and involves a suspense respecting an event and often a perplexity of mind to know how to shape our conduct i would say it's not just anxiety isn't just something that speaks of something in the future it can also be something that's happened to you in the past and you can take something that's happened to you in the past and and push that forward that's gonna happen again that's going to this is going to take place again and it produces anxiety inside of you and when that anxiety takes root inside of you what does it lead to depression so just a few things here we're living in one we're living in an age that is afflicted with anxiety or as brother branham called it a neurotic age two just because you're a holy ghost filled believer doesn't mean you don't experience anxiety and depression brother branham did it's clear through the message that depression comes via an evil spirit if you go through and read i read many many of the prayer lines and brother branham clearly over and over again calls it a demon of nervousness or a spirit of nervousness or a spirit of depression he says it's a shadow of misty darkness that would hang over a person that's not to say that there isn't there couldn't be a physical aspect to that but even so that demon works through the physical aspect to lead you to anxiety and depression there is a spiritual war taking place we can't forget that earth is the scene of a great cosmic battle that's taking place satan wants to control and operate through man and he works on his mind god seeks to control and operate through man also but he works through changing his heart amen satan once satan has access to the mind he starts to work and he will prevent god from working in your life many times satan can bring a spirit of depression on someone that would prevent them from repenting and making things right leading them to be released from that spirit of depression satan wants control and if you repent what happens he loses control there could be and i'm not trying to put paint a blanket picture that you're depressed because you have sin in your life that could be that could be but that doesn't mean it's the only reason we'll talk we'll look at that so i and i think god's word defines depress and we have to be careful here because in our day everybody's talking about mental health it's in advertisements it's on television it's on facebook that's good but i think they don't understand they don't understand the real source they don't understand the real definition of it they have their own definition so if you look at mayo clinic it says a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression it affects how you feel think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems whether while there can be medical conditions that cause or contribute to depression from the point of view of the bible uh so that that's the end of the definition behave and can lead to a variety variety of emotional physical problems definitely definitely that that can be true but remember we're made up of body soul and spirit amen so depression comes as a result of impacts things on each aspect of you as a person physically spirit in your spirit which is speaking of your attributes of your mind or your soul satan will attack each parts of those places things happen in our life that impact each part of those places and if you don't if you if you treat a human being just as a as a physical brain and a physical body you won't treat the real problem that a person is facing you can treat part of it but you can never get to the root of what the problem is definitely physical maladies can produce depression there's no question about that but again unless we approach that correctly i don't want to get into talking about drugs and they okay you need me to use this oh no that's terrible are we on all right all right so people that are facing depression need help i think we can tend to be not everyone but a lot of people around the message can be super spiritual and if you talk about feeling depressed oh my goodness this person's so weak this person's got real problems in their lives and there's a stigma that goes along with even talking about that at all and that's to me that's terrible because that's what the body of christ is for that's what we're here for is to help each other through what we're going through we're not here to tear people down throw people under the bus or say there's something wrong with you because you're depressed all of us live in a human body depression is not just a medical condition depression is a human condition and it can be on many different levels young kids can experience it elderly people can experience it all of us in between can experience it on different levels some people face it where it's so debilitating they can't even get out of bed all right some people face it where they can live their normal life and you never know you know there's so sad cases where people commit suicide and no one knew anything was wrong not even their spouse it's awful i think i think it's important to say i'll talk about this more later but if you're facing depression you need to find someone you can trust and talk to them sometimes just talking to someone that cares can bring healing so those of us if you're a person that's going to be talked to don't do too much talking mostly do listening you know and it's not it's not a matter of every time someone feels depressed you know you lit in today's day and age you kind of see the the left wing and the right wing political movements the left wing enshrines and almost puts a crown on mental health and mental disorders and sadness and try to find every mental problem that you possibly have and own it we don't want to own that we don't want to crown it we don't want to enshrine it in our lives and then on the right hand it's sort of like oh you guys are a bunch of babies and wimps just toughen up that's not helping anybody either you need indeed there's a balance scripture speaks about men of god the greatest man of god of history feeling deep and terrible depression so if moses was depressed elijah was depressed david jobe jesus brother branham why do we have a sick stigma if someone's depressed there's something wrong with them well yeah there is there's something wrong so help him not something wrong let's kick dirt on them i'm sick of that i'm sick of that and i'm thankful that we're not a church that does that and that we're a place that as best as we can though we may fail many times best as we can we're trying to help people get healing get deliverance and just be there for people depression can come from many many different things it can come from a traumatic event in your life it can come from you having unscriptural expectations of other people it can come from grieving for a loved one that you've you've almost lost hope in life because of your grief fears misplaced shame false guilt unconfessed sin bitterness and hatred that you're suppressing and pushing down all these things can bring depression but there's a cure amen and there's a fountain so let's look at some scriptures i'm going to go through quickly numbers 11 10-16 the prophet that god spoke to lip to ear won't just speak to moses in dreams and visions but he speaks face to face to moses so one of the greatest prophets of all history then moses heard the people weep throughout their families every man in the door of his tent and the anger of the lord was greatly kindled moses also was displeased and moses said unto the lord wherefore has thou afflicted thy servant and wherefore have i not found favor in thy sight that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me have i conceived this all this people have i begotten them that thou should have said unto me carry them in thy bosom as a nursing father beareth the suckling child unto the land which thou swear us unto their fathers when should i have flesh to give unto all this people for they weep unto me saying give us flesh that we may eat i'm not able to bear all this people alone because it's too heavy for me and if thou deal with thus with me kill me i pray thee out of hand if i have found favor in thy sight and let me not see my wretchedness and so you see there that's someone who's facing terrible anxiety over what everybody is complaining about everyone's complaining complaining complaining all the responsibilities on me what is what is moses depression from what is it from it's from a false understanding of the situation moses thinks it's all his responsibility god told him from the beginning that was not true and he reiterated that over and over and over again that that was not true but yet moses as a man had a feeling what was it he felt their complaints and it frustrated him his frustrated frustration led him to feel anxiety how am i going to fix the problem instead of praying and saying lord i cannot fix the problem he got anxious and he got angry and then he got depressed and god doesn't condemn him what does he say okay it's too hard for you to bear verse 16 and the lord said unto moses gather unto me seventy men of the elders of israel whom now know us to be elders of the people and officers over them and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation that they may stand there with thee so that's the grace of god he says okay moses i see you're depressed i see you're anxious i'll have some other people just be able to stand with you but the truth of the matter behind the whole thing is moses has an unscriptural understanding that all the responsibility was on him but it wasn't it never was he was just a tool in god's hand all he had to do was go get on his face and pray that's all he had to do but instead he got angry anxious depressed how many have ever how many have been there psalm 32 1-5 david is the psalm of david blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is the man unto whom the lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose spirit there is no guile now listen okay that's good stuff praise the lord but then let's look at david when i kept silence my bones wax old through my roaring all the day long for day and night thy hand was heavy upon me my moisture is turned into the drought of summer then look the next step i acknowledge my sin unto thee in my iniquity have i not hid i said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin this is a this is a process in this verse okay so he's telling the facts of the character of god and his forgiveness and his mercy but he is what is what is he why does he say that in verse three frank for when i kept silence my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long what in the world does that have to do with the rest of the context well i'll tell you what it has to do with the rest of the con context david was not confessing his sin in the in the context he he kept silence kept silence from what confessing his sin to god so he was he had sin in his life that he refused to confess and what was the result his bones waxed old his bones what does he get arthritis or what are we talking about here i don't think he's talking about arthritis his bones wax old wipe through my roaring roaring what what does that mean through through his tears his crying his weeping so my bones wax old through my weeping all the day long so he kept silent refused to confess his sins and he what did he do he fell into depression through his crying all the day long and then what does he do he confesses i acknowledged my sin that's that so god's hand was heavy upon david praise the lord for the goodness of god amen have you ever experienced it where god's hand was heavy upon you because you were stubborn and you weren't going to confess your sin even if it was just to him and make it right and move on from it no you just kept it i'm going to keep that i'm not going to say anything i'm not going to do anything about it and what happens it leads you to feel depressed why because god's hand becomes heavy upon you why am i why am i feeling this way why am i i don't understand and you get anxious about it and you get depressed god's hand is heavy is not to make you depressed that's your resisting against god moving in your life to bring you to repent so when when god brings his hand heavy immediately lord what have i done am i hiding something am i doing something wrong let me to know what to do how many of you experienced that in your life the holy spirit comes and you feel so heavy and you feel like like something's not right what's not right i'm going to prayer that's what we should do don't don't sit there and let it fester and fester and get depressed immediately stop everything stop your work stop nothing is more important than what god is doing in that moment get on your knees in some place private and say god what is going on something's heavy is on me he might be warning you from something but he also might be telling you to repent amen thank god for that conviction thank god for people on earth that feel conviction and quickly repent but here david he did he didn't do that and it turned into depression because he was resisting that but finally he said i give up i surrender lord this is what i've done forgive me and god forgave him it's as simple as that first king so hidden and unconfessed sin before god can lead to anxiety and it will result in depression so first kings 19 2-5 familiar with the story then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of them the prophets of baal that elijah slew by tomorrow about this time and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to beersheba which belongeth to judah and left his servant there but he himself one a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now oh lord take away my life for i'm not better than my father's and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat that's the grace of god so here we have elijah running for fear from a queen that wanted to kill him even after all the inspiration and the things that he did he was brought low brought low because of a woman that scared him to death and he ran and hid and i think that's that can be the tendency to someone that feels feels depression i'm gonna run and hide thank god for his grace that god will send something to help you you say well i i was alone for a long time people left me alone god's grace was there if you're his child god's grace is there somehow there might be dark nights there might be dark years there might be dark decades but god is going to do something if he did it for elijah that's his god's principle if he did something for elijah if he did something for david if he did something for moses and you're facing depression for some reason or another god will do something for you too what is he going to do good question what is he gonna do ask him what are you gonna do lord i'm depressed what are you gonna do i can't i can't fix myself i can't change myself i need you to change me he'll come he's gracious jonah jonah what a preacher he went and preached and accomplished his mission and he was so depressed and angry the bible says he was exceedingly angry can you imagine brother brad you go and preach a revival meeting and the whole town repents and you say my prophecy is not coming to pass and these people are rotten i hate this city and he has more compassion on a on his vegetable he must be a gardener cares about vegetables more than he does about people and what happens he's depressed and says kill me i want to die what is it anger i don't want to say stupidity but it's pretty close to that sometimes we get depressed because we did something stupid and we're embarrassed and ashamed of ourselves fine fine we've all done that just repent don't go hide yourself don't go get under your vegetable garden and ask for god to kill you i'm not trying to make it i'm trying to make you laugh a little bit but make you smile a little bit it's a heavy topic but the reality is here jonah felt felt false reasons jonah felt like a failure he ever felt like a failure before lord he said lord i'm such a failure i've just messed everything up i'm at this place in my life and this has happened and this has happened and this has happened and you just lay down in bed and you don't ever want to get out of it yep i've been there but but again it starts out with false thinking about yourself and what god says about you and again when you're going through that many times you have you don't even know everything that you think is perfectly logical perfectly reasonable that's why we need good friends that we can talk to and they can slap us upside the head a little bit they can listen first and nicely say brother sister i think you're starting from the beginning from a wrong wrong way of thinking you're looking at it differently than god looks at it psalm 69 verse 20. reproach have broken my heart or insults have broken my heart and i'm full of heaviness again there that word heaviness speaking of sadness sorrow depression and i looked for some to take pity but there was none and for comforters but i found none difficult situation sounds like sounds like jesus doesn't it i believe it's a prophecy of the messiah he was there he was left alone there everybody forsook him and yet what did he do turn and run it was the darkness of night in the garden of gethsemane pretty easy to escape especially when you know exactly what's coming but he walked he he asked them who are you seeking i would have hidden back behind the fence jesus walked directly up to them said who are you seeking yeah we knew the answer to the to the question already and when he said it again i think they fell down another chance to run right instead he patiently waited for them to arrest him and beat him and and so i that's an example to us what are we what should we what should our response be when we're depressed should it be disobedience or should it be obedience it should be obedience matthew 26 38 then saith he and unto them my soul is exceeding sourful listen to this even unto death tear ye here and watch for me he sweat drops of blood that's a medical condition that can happen when a person is facing extreme levels of stress so jesus went through it uh your soul so heavy so sorrowful unto death what is that describing he knows what's coming he's facing what we would call depression now job chapter nine i'm going to read 27-35 this is from the nlt version i i don't know personally i find it in the kjv very hard to understand the book of job so i always find myself turning back to different different translations and and the original the original hebrew to find out what's going on um that's just maybe just me but i read this nlt and i was amazed at this verse he says if i decided to forget my complaints to put away my sad face and be cheerful i would still dread all the pain for i know you will not find me innocent o god whatever happens i will be found guilty so what's the use of trying even if i were to wash myself with soap and clean my hands with lie you would plunge me into a muddy ditch and my own filthy clothing would hate me god is not mortal like me so i cannot argue with him or take him to trial if only there was a mediator between us someone who could who could bring us together hallelujah there is a mediator the mediator could make god stop beating me and i would no longer live in terror of his punishment then i could speak to him without fear but i cannot do that in my own strength so job has gone through a terrible trauma in his life he lost his children property struck with the terrible sickness and he says even if i put a smile on my face and tried to put away the depression i'd still be afraid of the pain that's quite the statement that's quite the statement and there's people that live in that place i'm trying to put away the depression i'm trying to put a smile on my face in front of everybody but even if i did that i'd still be in terror i'd still be afraid of of what happened each of us has had traumatic events happen in their lives some people even were could have been raised in a home that produced trauma that way some people could have been raped or physically abused or lost a spouse or a parent at a young age or even someone hurt in a bad church situation which brings trauma in your life and it creates a situation where you're living in depression and that depression is controlling how you respond to things that are right in front of you right now and all these things they lead to that anxiety they lead to that depression but god doesn't want us to stay there god doesn't want us to enshrine that god doesn't want us to take a crown and place it upon that and say this is me the world wants to say this is me as good as alcoholics anonymous says is is for helping people people have to identify forever with their sin which is not scriptural amen we don't identify with what trauma happened to us i'm of this i'm a that i have i have this you'll hear that it's my depression it's my anxiety don't claim that as ownership words have power as a man thinks in his heart so is he don't claim it as yours don't say it's mine it's it's it's real it's there it's the the depression but it's not my depression it's the depression because it's an enemy that wants to hurt you destroy you ruin your life and you have to fight not only that but isn't this what part of what the gospel is for isn't that part of why jesus came we don't want to make the gospel just about this life and dealing with problems in this life ultimately the gospel doesn't wipe every tear away right now does it doesn't that's the new jerusalem the new heaven and the new earth where every tear is wiped away still we here we have tears we have sorrow jesus said in this world you'll have trouble those troubles will produce dramatic events in your life those traumatic events will be in your mind until we forget everything that god has already forgotten i have a little taste of that when i was in in the hospital for a day and a half i have no idea what happened and brother andrew says that's a really good thing and it is because the real short snippets that i have are not very fun to think about but i don't have to be defined by that and none of us have to be defined by when i was a child this happened to me when this time this happened to me because the gospel came to change lives to not make you limit it yes okay if something happened to you and you lost your arm your god can cr create a whole new arm absolutely but many times he doesn't many times he doesn't and you go through life without that these events make us who we are but we don't have to be controlled in a negative way by them god works everything for our good so in our mind when we're thinking about such and such an event how would god like us to think about it oh i just i went through this and my life is just destroyed and it's terrible no all things work together for for the good for those that love god and that means that god actively works in the midst of terrible and troublesome things in order to accomplish his good purposes and eternal purposes in your life you know part of what amy and i went through with covid god used that to train amy so that she could go help her parents so they wouldn't die and god used what the terrible thing that i went through to save lives isn't that what happened to joseph joseph went through terrible trauma what was his response i'm gonna get even with those guys no what you meant for evil god meant for good and to save lives and and again we have to we have to speak that over our lives it's true whether you speak it or not but it's going to change your attitude if you speak what god has spoken over your life instead of i had this problem i had this trouble i went through this i went through that okay that's fine tell that and then say but god because it's a testimony those things are there to be a testimony that god can take someone from a terrible circumstance through a terrible situation and make them a whole human being again and they still have the hurt there and they still think about it and say oh that was so bad that's the worst thing that ever happened to me but god works everything for my good god takes care of me god use this to help other people the gospel isaiah 61 one through three of course we we familiar with that but i'm going to read verse 3 to appoint unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified amen so again he didn't say we would never have troubles in fact he said we would be in the midst of mourning we would be more we would be mourning but he would replace that with the oil of joy right the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness he doesn't erase your memory right you most of us remember the traumatic things that we went through right in our lives okay but you're not again don't be defined by them and don't be limited by them because with god all things are possible if you're depressed talk to your pastor or someone you trust in the body of christ just just some just some things walk in obedience okay that's where i'm starting here some solutions walk in obedience number one don't ever let i've been so low where i felt like i didn't want to see people i've been so low where i didn't want to go to church or if i went to church i ran out of the church as fast as i could to get in the car and go home because i didn't want to talk to anybody and have somebody say how are you doing don't do that don't do that talk to your pastor talk to someone that loves you in the body of christ someone that has the spirit of god in their lives talking through that what you're going through can lead you to discover what's the source of the problem wrong ways of thinking unrepented sin and if just anything else to help release you from the pain that you're feeling wake up in the morning spend time in prayer read your bible before you go to sleep at night pray read your bible why you say this is so simple because depression will rob you of your senses it will make you act stupidly i've been there it'll make you do things that's the opposite of what's going to help you so what should we do do the opposite of what you feel that's what brother branham said if you think this way then do the opposite listen to sermons of brother branham take time to do that make that be what's on in your car as you're driving attend every church service and bible study and prayer meeting that the church offers talk to and fellowship with like-minded believers and here's here's simple natural things but it's important exercise your body drink water remember brother john andes was saying that about restoration drink water drink water eat healthy these all these things were a tripartite mean resolve conflicts that you have quickly don't let them fester don't let them become deep wounds just go talk about it what's the worst thing they're going to happen lots of bad things could happen right so what your got the word of god says to resolve your conflicts quickly drop your gift don't bring it to the altar go and resolve the problem that your brother has with you then start doing something to serve other people get your eye take the focus off of yourself put it on others if you're if you're a if you're a brother go and give another brother in christ a hug dear sister go give another sister a hug okay wow that's really simple there's physical reasons physical reasons it helps then talk to yourself in your thought life according to the word of god that's the biggest thing that the devil does in the secret place of your mind you begin to talk to yourself and it's not you talking to yourself it's the devil the devil is manipulating your mind and your patterns of thinking and it makes you full of anxiety full of depression check your thoughts by the word matthew 11 27-30 all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knows the son but the father neither knows any man the father save the son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him so he's talking about revelation revelation personally to you and then what does he say come come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for a meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light amen go to jesus if you're depressed if you're full of anxiety go to jesus he'll change he'll he'll change your outlook he'll change your life it might take time might take other circumstances but he will do something to do it you go to him don't run away from him part of coming to jesus is doing the things that i talk to you about because this life here in the body of christ the local church is part of how we come to jesus it's not the only way it's not the only means but it's part of how we meet him and meet with him and see him in the world in the little while in the world sees me no more yet you will see me why for i'll be with you even in you so if you want to see jesus come and look at the believers that are filled with the holy ghost so you know looking at looking at depression okay it can be real easy just to say all right come on up here we'll pray over you and you'll be delivered from depression that's absolutely true and god can heal you miraculously from the way of thinking the patterns of thinking all those different things god can do that miraculously many times many times in my experience that there is a fountain there is a spring there is a well of water that's springing up into eternal life and these things that we face that make us anxious and make us feel depressed it's something where we it it comes and it goes and we have to go to jesus we have to go to him we have to get on our knees we have to do these things we have to listen to worship music he delivers in many different ways he builds our faith in many different ways but it's it's a fountain that we have to go to and it's not just once it's not just twice it's not just three times it's not come and come on let's come forward and and pray over you that's good it'll help you and god can deliver you at the same time with depress that's the spirit of this age it's a neurotic age not fit to live in right neurosis produces a depression so it's something we have to fight against continually it's a spirit in this age that young people old people middle aged people all have to fight in our own unique ways even sometimes there's traumatic things that happen and just time moving on and living by the principles of god's word delivers you from that amen you look back and say man when after it first happened i felt so terrible i had ptsd and you know i would shake because of this or that or the other thing that happened and now i don't do that anymore it wasn't any specific event it was just living by god's word and now i don't feel that way anymore and and you know we all have our own fight and our own battle but be in the fight be in the battle because that's what it is in the sermon letting off the pressure brother branham says see it's just built up pressure it's the age we're living in an erotic age where people don't know what to do where they're going and the doctors don't have the answer for it because the psychiatrist is being doctored by the psychiatrists so they have not the answer but there's some answer surely somewhere we could deal on it for hours but i was just thinking that god has the answer amen he does i love psalm 42 many times i turn and read psalm 42 and i feel down i'm going to read it from the nlt again as the deer longs for streams of water so i long for you o god i thirst for god the living god when can i go and stand before him day and night i have only tears for food while my enemies enemies continually taunt me saying where is this god of yours my heart is breaking as i remember how it used to be i walked among the crowds of worshippers leading a great procession to the house of god singing for joy and giving thanks amid the sound of great celebration why am i discouraged why is my heart so sad i will put my hope in god amen i will praise him again my savior and my god now i'm deeply discouraged but i will remember you even from distant mount hermon the source of the jordan from the land of mount miser i hear the two mold of the raging seas as your waves and surging tides sweep over me but each day the lord pours his unfailing love upon me and through each night i sing his songs praying to god who gives me life oh god my rock i cry why have you forgotten me why must i wander around in grief oppressed by the enemies their taunts break my bones they scoff where is this god of yours why am i discouraged why is my heart so sad i will put my hope in god i will praise him again my savior and my god i love that i love that you know why it's it's so encouraging because when you're feeling down you can go and read the scripture and see oh i'm not alone not the first one that's went through this david's went through it what was his solution praise the lord give thanks to the lord philippians 4 6 through 9. be careful or anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god and the peace of god which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus finally brethren what the whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the god of peace shall be with you all right so the solution to depression is to be free from anxiety so everybody do you want to be freed from depression don't have any anxiety let's go home you can do that right the bible commands it so i bet there's a way that god can make a way for us to live in such a way that anxiety doesn't control us don't be anxious for anything okay so what do i do instead pray make all your requests all your all the feelings all the things that you feel bring it to god the thing that you're fearful about you're worried about bring it to god make it known to him and ask him to work in that situation and then it says with thanksgiving so and then thank him that the answer is coming thank him that he's done it if you do that then what will happen the peace of god which goes beyond understanding in other words you're in the middle of a situation that would make anyone in the world anxious right that's what's going on otherwise he wouldn't say what he's saying you should this is a situation that the human race would be anxious about but he says don't be pray make your request unto god give thanks to him then the peace of god that goes beyond human understanding will keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus then he gives the next bit of advice regarding the peace of god it's what to think about think on positive things that's how brother branham would put it think always positive thoughts of the word of god think how god is going to bring his promises to pass think about the beautiful things that the lord has done supernaturally in your life think about the blessings that he's brought brought in your life the deliverance that he's given think think about worship songs then he goes on he continues again it's about the peace of god ruling the what's there's two things fighting against each other anxiety and the peace of god and we want the peace of god to rule in our hearts so paul is telling us how he's telling us how prayer praise and then thought life keep your mind in in control do not let the the devil will try to pass things through right he can come in but he we can stop him from roosting there right the double barrel shotgun that brother branham says the old and new testament take that double barrel shotgun and blow those birds blows those birds out of your garden so think on positive things of the word of god and then the last thing he says the things that you learned received and heard and seen do it okay i'm gonna cut i'm gonna do it one more time because i want you to i want everyone to memorize this and i want it to be on your heart next time you feel anxious and you're starting to feel depressed i want you to go back to the scripture in your mind okay pray make my request known to god give thanks worship him change my thought life think on positive things think on the positive things of the word of god and the blessings and the testimonies and the supernatural things that you've personally witnessed in your life think on those things and then walk in obedience not disobedience doesn't matter what other people are doing don't worry about what other people are doing worry about what god has commanded to you personally what you've seen what you've heard what you've learned do it if you do if if you follow that pattern then the peace of god shall be with you how many want the peace of god with you amen it's i'm not trying to down talk a prayer line love a prayer line i love god working through prayer lines but that's not what this is talking about anxiety is a the malady that the whole human race faces it is not an anxiety that a christian should be controlled by the word of god commands us not to do it we're not to fester well i'm just an anxious person you don't understand brother jason i'm just an anxious person you're doing it again you're owning it you're owning it i am this way god has set you free from that by the blood of jesus christ and the baptism of the holy ghost you're set free you're not subject to your old nature anymore it's still fighting against you but you're not subject to it it does it doesn't have to rule over you you can fight against it and overcome it first peter 5 7 says cast all your cares upon him because he cares for you cast all your anxieties on him part of casting all our anxieties on him it's not just a prayer and say lord i take this feeling that i have and i put it on you if you love jesus then you keep his commandments you follow his word right and so if you want if you want to see deliverance seek first the kingdom of god so many times overseas people come in the prayer line pray for me for this pray for me for that and everything they're asking for prayer for is very very simple seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you i will pray for you to be obedient to the word of god and god will add the rest to you that's what this is about yes prayer can give you a jump start but you're going to have to fight many of the many of the people that came through the prayer line the young people at the at the camp was about depression or different things in their life and most of it was i pray i'll pray for you but you got to know that you've got to go home and fight let this be the starting place that you're gonna fight because i'm 44 years old i've been walking in the message for a little over 20 years i was facing those things then and i'm still fighting all of that again why because there's a spirit of this age that we have to fight against yes if somebody has let's say just terrible depression where they're just laid low they're sick they've got all kinds of things they need deliverance they need healing but they still need to they're still going to need to fight it's not as though okay you're healed now just go back to thinking and living the way you were before it's not going to work it's not going to work it'll help you for a little bit but you'll just go back to the same problems as you were living in before sometimes deliverance is something that we start and continue to walk in the rest of our lives and we can't just lay like a dead corpse and say i've been delivered you walk in it we walk in newness of life part of being delivered from depression that's a malady that everybody faces everybody has to fight against it's not just a matter of pray and it's over with it's going to come back and you have to fight it and you have to fight it again and you have to fight it again why why is that we're in eleodusa it's a neurotic age it produces everything around us is fighting to produce anxiety to control us god is a great deliverer amen but he's also a a great eternal spirit that's living inside of you to create the character that's a reflection reflection of jesus christ that regardless of what we feel again jesus felt depression jesus felt anxiety right to the point of sweating drops of blood it's not as though a sinless life is going to produce a life free in this sinful world of anxiety and depression but it shouldn't stop you from being obedient it shouldn't stop you from living according to according to the word of god musicians if you'd come again and i don't want to there's a fine balance in that because i do i know god delivers but what i'm trying to the point i'm trying to by by prayer prayer lines and does the supernatural work but i'm afraid that we emphasize so much on the fantastic sometimes that we forget that there's people that are living their life and they've got to supernaturally fight against the enemy on a daily basis amen let's pray let's stand up father we just come before you and we're so thankful for your goodness lord [Music] we're thankful lord that you give us strength to fight and overcome lord and we know as long as we're in this body of flesh we'll still face struggling against sin struggling against anxiety but we don't have to be ruled by it lord i pray for each
