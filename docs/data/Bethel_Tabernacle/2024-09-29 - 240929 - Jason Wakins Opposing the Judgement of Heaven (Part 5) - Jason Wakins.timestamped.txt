[48:24] this
[48:25] morning we want to continue with our

[48:30] heaven today I think should be the fifth
[48:33] installment
[48:36] amen we want to try to turn a corner
[48:39] today on this thought and um I think
[48:43] you'll understand that better as I get
[48:46] going and and I've got some statements
[48:48] I'll make that I really should should
[48:50] clarify it pretty good
[48:53] amen it's one it's one thing to present
[48:56] a problem
[48:57] but it's that's only adds weariness if
[48:59] you don't have a solution amen so I like
[49:03] to be anytime I'm in a situation I like
[49:06] to be part of the solution not part of
[49:07] the problem amen amen praise the Lord so
[49:11] today we want to start looking toward we
[49:13] want to continue to address the
[49:16] situation but we've talked quite a bit
[49:18] about what's hindering the world and
[49:21] today I want to start talking about you
[49:23] know what is hindering us and what is
[49:26] the answer for us and we won't get
[49:28] through it today but I'll go just so far
[49:31] and then we'll amen we'll we'll jump out
[49:34] pop the Shute stand on the brakes get it
[49:37] landed amen praise the Lord Daniel
[49:39] chapter 8 verse 13 and we'll go 13
[49:43] through
[49:47] 19 then I heard one speaking and another
[49:51] Saint said unto that certain Saint which
[49:54] spake how long shall be the vision
[49:57] concerning the daily sacrifice and the
[50:00] transgression of
[50:02] desolation to give both the sanctuary
[50:05] and the host to be trotten
[50:07] underfoot and he said unto me unto
[50:11] 2,300 days then shall the sanctuary be
[50:15] cleansed and it came to pass when I even
[50:19] I Daniel had seen the vision and sought
[50:21] for the meaning then behold there stood
[50:24] before me as the appearance of a man
[50:27] and I heard a man's voice between the
[50:29] banks of Uli which called and said
[50:32] Gabriel make this man to understand the
[50:36] vision so he came near Where I Stood and
[50:40] when he came I was afraid and fell upon
[50:42] my face but he said unto me understand
[50:45] oh son of man for at the time of the end
[50:48] shall the vision be now as he was
[50:51] speaking with me I was in a deep sleep
[50:54] on my face toward the ground but he
[50:57] touched me and set me upright and he
[51:00] said behold I will make thee know what
[51:03] shall be in the last end of the
[51:06] indignation for at the time appointed
[51:09] the end shall be Daniel chapter 10
[51:13] verses
[51:14] 7-2 Daniel 10
[51:19] 7-12 and I Daniel alone saw the vision
[51:23] for the men that were with me saw not
[51:25] the vision but a great quaking fell upon
[51:29] them so that they fled to hide
[51:32] themselves therefore I was left alone
[51:35] and saw this great vision and there
[51:38] remained no strength in me for my caless
[51:41] was turned in me into corruption and I
[51:44] retained no strength yet heard I the
[51:47] voice of his words and when I heard the
[51:49] voice of his words then was I in a deep
[51:52] sleep on my face and my face toward the
[51:56] ground
[51:57] and behold a hand touched me which sat
[52:00] me upon my knees and upon the palms of
[52:03] my hands and he said unto me oh Daniel a
[52:08] man greatly
[52:09] beloved understand the words that I
[52:11] speak unto thee and stand upright For
[52:15] unto thee am I now sent and when he had
[52:18] spoken this word unto me I stood
[52:22] trembling then said he unto me fear not
[52:25] Daniel for from from the first day that
[52:27] thou did US set thine heart to
[52:29] understand and to chasten thyself before
[52:32] thy God thy words were heard and I am
[52:35] come for thy
[52:37] words let's
[52:40] pray father we're asking for your great
[52:43] blessing today upon your word may you
[52:46] break to us the bread of life Lord we
[52:48] realize that we are in a tumultuous time
[52:51] and Lord we know that the that the
[52:55] events that are unfolding around the
[52:57] world cannot be stopped so Lord we want
[53:00] to know what are our orders Lord what is
[53:04] our position that we ought to be in and
[53:06] need to be in Father for this gripping
[53:11] time in human
[53:14] history we commit ourselves into your
[53:17] hands now to study your word and look at
[53:19] these things in Jesus name amen God
[53:22] bless you you can be seated
[53:45] amen Smith Wigglesworth once
[53:50] said to hunger and thirst after
[53:54] righteousness is when nothing nothing in
[53:57] the world can Fascinate us so much as
[54:01] being near
[54:03] God I think that is a profound way to
[54:07] say it want to read it again this is a
[54:10] great champion of the faith great um he
[54:14] was among and you know at the tail end
[54:16] of the isua Revival there and was a
[54:20] powerful voice in that time he preceded
[54:24] um brother Brandon by some years and in
[54:26] fact is as he was fading out and going
[54:29] off the scene uh in and near that time
[54:32] brother Brandon was uh receive a message
[54:36] a commission from an angel to go forward
[54:39] Wigglesworth says again to hunger and
[54:42] thirst after righteousness would you
[54:45] like to know what that is to hunger and
[54:47] thirst after righteousness here's the
[54:50] definition is when nothing in the world
[54:53] can Fascinate us so much as being near
[54:58] God it's like that there are advantages
[55:02] to living in the spiritual world and I
[55:06] have a lot of things that brother
[55:07] brandom said I don't know that I'll get
[55:09] to any of them today my my my job as I
[55:13] see it today is to try to deliver to you
[55:17] the burden of the word that's on my
[55:18] heart not try to press beyond that uh so
[55:21] you just pray for me amen I would like
[55:25] to say that the these things that I'm
[55:27] saying today are very near my own heart
[55:30] and when I say that I don't just mean
[55:32] for you but I mean for me as well I I I
[55:36] it's partly why this this statement so
[55:39] spoke to me uh because with such a great
[55:43] desire as I have to live higher in the
[55:47] Lord I hope you have that desire and I
[55:50] as I see the world ending I coming to a
[55:53] conclusion it's not ending it's not
[55:55] ending but it's coming into a transition
[55:57] and so as we see that happening and we
[56:00] know that it can't be stopped that we
[56:02] know as I've said before that there are
[56:05] uh enormous judgments that are rushing
[56:07] to meet humanity and the only way out is
[56:10] up that is still true that will not
[56:13] change and the only way that you will
[56:16] ever hear the word come up is if you are
[56:19] willing to hear the word come out and so
[56:22] you have to come out of her my people if
[56:24] you want to hear the word come up high
[56:27] amen so I want to hear come out which
[56:30] means I don't just want to hear it I
[56:32] want to do it I want to be it I want to
[56:34] experience what it means to be separated
[56:38] from the world and I say brother Jason
[56:40] but you're a Christian you had you're
[56:42] correct I have been for many years but I
[56:45] find as I see the world falling under
[56:47] the grip of Satan more and more and more
[56:50] as I see the judgments that are
[56:52] burgeoning all around us uh it causes me
[56:56] to want to move up even higher brother
[56:59] brandham said in the message perfect
[57:01] faith and I'm going to be dealing with
[57:03] that a lot today and you're going to
[57:05] understand why momentarily but the
[57:07] prophet warned us that one of the
[57:09] reasons he was bringing the message
[57:12] perfect faith is because you were going
[57:14] to need it down the road and in when in
[57:17] his day you know him thinking that it
[57:20] was imminent and about as bad as it
[57:22] could get oh
[57:24] boy H how any of us would like to go
[57:27] back to the Simplicity of the mid
[57:30] 1960s but I now I don't want to go back
[57:33] I'm this close to home I want to keep
[57:35] going amen I've already come too far to
[57:38] turn back or go back I want to go
[57:41] forward amen and so and so I realize you
[57:45] know and then young people sometimes say
[57:47] well you know I want to before uh this
[57:50] you know before the Rapture I'd like to
[57:52] accomplish this I'd like to accomplish
[57:53] that I'd like to have this or have that
[57:56] just take my word for it I get that I
[57:58] thought that way as a young man but I'm
[58:01] here to tell you I once was young now
[58:03] I'm older and I'm here to tell you that
[58:06] uh when when when we cross over you
[58:09] won't worry about what you didn't get to
[58:11] accomplish in this life amen it's it's
[58:15] that it's it's I heard one man
[58:17] describing it is imagine if you existed
[58:20] as a two-dimensional black and white
[58:22] image on the wall and that's all your
[58:25] existence was you you were just an a
[58:27] picture in black and white
[58:29] two-dimensional and then suddenly
[58:31] somebody came and gave you the breath of
[58:33] life and pulled you out into a
[58:35] three-dimensional world with color and
[58:37] life and then you have to go try to go
[58:39] back into that 2D black and white
[58:43] picture and then try to describe to
[58:45] everybody in that realm what you just
[58:46] experienced brother bam said there are
[58:49] no words I can't describe that feeling
[58:51] there's I don't have enough vocabulary
[58:54] in the English language he said just
[58:56] take my word for it just beyond this
[58:58] breath just beyond this breath just
[59:01] beyond this little thin veil friends is
[59:03] a world waiting that is beyond all
[59:06] imagination your heart has never even
[59:08] entertained what God has for those that
[59:10] love him I want to be part of that see
[59:14] and I don't just want to stumble in I
[59:17] don't want to trip and fall in I don't
[59:18] want to arrive there accidentally I
[59:20] don't want to be trying to rush you know
[59:23] I I I know that the bride was getting
[59:25] out of Step at the end and I'm glad that
[59:28] she was still in an order of ascending
[59:30] even stumbling cuz that gives me hope
[59:33] and I do know you say why because I do
[59:35] know I Stumble and I do know I get out
[59:36] of Step but I do know I'm still
[59:38] ascending but what I want to do is obey
[59:41] a prophet's words he said when I came
[59:43] out of the vision I was standing out the
[59:45] middle of the room with my hands out
[59:47] saying stay in line and that's what I
[59:50] want to do and he said the last thing I
[59:52] saw is those little girls at the end
[59:54] were hurrying trying to get get back in
[59:56] Step I just say Lord God let me get back
[59:59] in Step let my whole life be in
[1:00:03] Step so there's a lot to be said about
[1:00:07] having perfect
[1:00:09] Faith so when we when we talk about
[1:00:12] living in a realm near God you know I I
[1:00:16] cannot stress enough and there's so many
[1:00:20] things from uh Great Men of God that I
[1:00:23] read not just William Brandon but great
[1:00:25] men of God down Through the Ages who
[1:00:28] talked in such detail and if you uh you
[1:00:31] know you you would always do yourself
[1:00:33] good to read some of their writings and
[1:00:35] some of their sermons and you know I
[1:00:37] love my my uh Bible that Rachel got me
[1:00:41] um because uh it's a spurge it's edited
[1:00:44] by Spurgeon and has his own handwritten
[1:00:46] notes in it things like that I love
[1:00:47] reading stuff like that I read from
[1:00:49] people like Wigglesworth from Spurgeon
[1:00:51] from Gil from Henry all the way back to
[1:00:54] the and Wesley and in the different ones
[1:00:57] my library is quite large and so but but
[1:01:00] I can tell you as a as a one who studies
[1:01:04] as a student of History particularly
[1:01:07] church history I can tell you that they
[1:01:09] all these Great Men of God down through
[1:01:12] William brandham all the way down into
[1:01:14] the Great Men of God we have today
[1:01:16] preaching in pulpits around the world
[1:01:19] preaching this glorious messag amen that
[1:01:22] they the common theme among them all if
[1:01:25] there's one common theme they lived in
[1:01:27] different countries they lived in
[1:01:29] different times sometimes they spoke
[1:01:31] different languages sometimes it was
[1:01:32] English and they lived you know when you
[1:01:34] go and you go read The Works of Hudson
[1:01:36] Taylor or you go and you look at David
[1:01:39] Livingston and different ones and I've
[1:01:40] also read their lives and the Memoirs of
[1:01:42] Wesley in his own hand and I can tell
[1:01:45] you that the one common theme they all
[1:01:48] pointed to was there was Grand privilege
[1:01:51] when you were willing to live in the
[1:01:54] upper atmospheres in the presence of God
[1:01:57] there were many you had great access and
[1:01:59] many doors open to you that would not
[1:02:02] otherwise open uh if you don't as the
[1:02:05] Bible says walk in the spirit move in
[1:02:09] the spirit live in the spirit see and so
[1:02:13] when you do when you are willing to do
[1:02:15] that then then there are all kinds of
[1:02:18] places of peace and contentment and
[1:02:21] power that become open and available to
[1:02:25] you how many want
[1:02:29] that that total satisfaction of life
[1:02:33] that are that I let me say it like this
[1:02:35] that are not accessible to you if you
[1:02:38] don't live in this realm of the spirit
[1:02:42] of God's presence you you will you will
[1:02:45] know let me say you will know very
[1:02:48] little of the
[1:02:50] enjoyment even may I say even if you are
[1:02:54] a child of God and even if you have had
[1:02:57] the personal experience of the holy
[1:03:00] ghost in a new birth if if you're not
[1:03:03] willing to press your way daily and live
[1:03:07] and enjoy some time with the Lord in his
[1:03:11] presence then I'm here to tell you
[1:03:13] something friends you are you are really
[1:03:16] missing out on a lot and you are
[1:03:19] suffering a lot of anxiousness worry
[1:03:21] frat fear anxiety uh and let me just say
[1:03:24] it today I know that life is filled with
[1:03:27] that and I'm not denying that we have
[1:03:29] trials and we live by the law of
[1:03:31] contrast I understand that but I can
[1:03:34] also tell you that you are living a
[1:03:36] great portion of that anxiety
[1:03:40] needlessly Hallelujah do you believe
[1:03:42] that today I'm here to tell you that his
[1:03:44] promise is that he would give you a
[1:03:46] peace that passes understanding what
[1:03:48] that means is it's it it's it you have a
[1:03:51] peace that even you can't explain to you
[1:03:54] that everything around you seems bad and
[1:03:56] dull and terrible but somehow you lay
[1:03:59] your pillow on your head at night and
[1:04:01] you love God and God loves you and you
[1:04:04] wake up every morning and you feel him
[1:04:06] near and the trial may not be gone but
[1:04:09] you know you're not in it
[1:04:11] alone
[1:04:16] amen even if you are I want to say it
[1:04:19] again there is great accessibility to
[1:04:23] you if you live in that spirit
[1:04:26] but you will be very limited though you
[1:04:29] be a child of God though you may have
[1:04:31] had a holy ghost experience you will be
[1:04:34] limited with little enjoyment of those
[1:04:37] benefits uh because you invest so much
[1:04:41] of your very oh my wish I had another
[1:04:45] language because you invest so much of
[1:04:48] your very limited time here Amen in
[1:04:53] spiritual things see instead we invest
[1:04:57] so much come on we might as well own it
[1:05:00] we invest when I when I said to myself
[1:05:03] why don't I live higher I had to come to
[1:05:05] terms with this maybe it's because I'm
[1:05:08] spending too much of my very limited
[1:05:11] time with the cares of the world I'm not
[1:05:14] talking about sinful carnal things I'm
[1:05:16] just talking about World stuff and you
[1:05:19] get wrapped up in that and you get
[1:05:21] wrapped up in the technology and where
[1:05:23] is the time spent with the Lord where's
[1:05:26] the time with your Bible open as sister
[1:05:29] Emily sings uh on the back porch with a
[1:05:31] Bible on my knee a cup of coffee I'm
[1:05:33] here to tell you th those words were
[1:05:35] written from somebody who was
[1:05:37] experiencing
[1:05:39] that
[1:05:42] amen there's such a a fountain that you
[1:05:45] can open for yourself you know I I
[1:05:48] looked at a study and I'm don't have it
[1:05:50] in front of me today in fact it is not
[1:05:52] in my notes I'm just remembering it now
[1:05:54] but there was a St study about just
[1:05:56] simple Bible reading when they asked
[1:05:58] brother brandham how can we be closer to
[1:06:00] God and his answer was almost overs
[1:06:02] simplistic and people just say okay yeah
[1:06:04] but what's the real answer and that was
[1:06:06] the real answer read your Bible and
[1:06:08] pray and they they talked about
[1:06:11] Christian people who only read their
[1:06:14] Bible once per week yeah one day a week
[1:06:18] they read in their Bible and the the the
[1:06:21] the effect of that was not measurable
[1:06:25] it was so small it was not measurable
[1:06:29] amen then they started looking at people
[1:06:32] and they and they're having people fill
[1:06:34] out you know questionnaires about you
[1:06:36] know your your mental state and the
[1:06:38] condition of your heart and your you
[1:06:39] know and all it was all it was all it
[1:06:41] was a psychology exam and so they they
[1:06:44] found that you know and and that's
[1:06:47] important because we can't just always
[1:06:49] live up there in the ethereals of great
[1:06:51] revelation we do got to live and your
[1:06:53] feet have to contact the Earth and
[1:06:55] sometimes you just need the old sassr
[1:06:57] rubber meets the road kind of preaching
[1:07:00] that tells you how to be an overcomer
[1:07:02] and how to deal with anxiety there's a
[1:07:04] way to do it and it's a disease that the
[1:07:07] world is dealing with brother brandham
[1:07:10] called it a plague called it a plague
[1:07:13] that we live under see and so so we they
[1:07:17] found out that if a if a Christian read
[1:07:20] their Bible two times in a week that
[1:07:23] finally the needle bumped just a a
[1:07:25] little bit and if they read their Bible
[1:07:28] three times a week three days if they
[1:07:30] read their Bible three days a week see
[1:07:34] not just three times but three days a
[1:07:36] week they spent time in their Bible that
[1:07:39] finally the needle actually got up off
[1:07:41] the the nothing Peg and and actually got
[1:07:44] up into a little bit of low range and
[1:07:47] they found a surprising
[1:07:49] reality that if for those who read their
[1:07:52] Bible four days a week there was an
[1:07:55] exponential explosion and the peg went
[1:07:59] way
[1:07:59] over and all it took was that extra day
[1:08:03] little as much you say it's just one
[1:08:04] more day little as much if God is in it
[1:08:06] I can tell you that reading your Bible
[1:08:08] and praying has a cumulative effect in
[1:08:11] your life as does not reading your Bible
[1:08:14] and praying every day has an
[1:08:16] accumulative drain on our lives and this
[1:08:20] is no time to be drained this is a time
[1:08:23] to be on fire this is time to have power
[1:08:26] this is a time to have peace and
[1:08:28] Tranquility overcoming the anxieties of
[1:08:31] the world settling disputes making homes
[1:08:35] and families and marriages live in
[1:08:37] harmony because everything in the world
[1:08:40] that's falling apart is trying to make
[1:08:42] that fall
[1:08:44] apart absolutely you know this is
[1:08:47] exactly why there should be such Purity
[1:08:50] but you know between men and women
[1:08:53] before marriage because I will promise
[1:08:56] you this young people hear me the same
[1:08:59] devil that is trying to put you two
[1:09:02] together in a way that shouldn't be
[1:09:04] before you're married is the same exact
[1:09:07] devil that will come the day after your
[1:09:09] wedding and try to drive you
[1:09:11] apart the same one who's trying to put
[1:09:14] you together unlawful in God's word will
[1:09:17] be the same guy who shows up the very
[1:09:20] next day trying to start driving you
[1:09:22] apart see amen so so we find then that
[1:09:27] that we can no little enjoyment of these
[1:09:30] great things even even if we are as I
[1:09:34] said true children of God I'm going to
[1:09:36] give you the benefit of the doubt today
[1:09:38] you're a true child of God you've had an
[1:09:40] experience hopefully you've had many
[1:09:42] experiences with the Holy Ghost see but
[1:09:45] if we invest so much uh so much of our
[1:09:49] limited time in the cares of this world
[1:09:51] you do know it's dying right amen amen
[1:09:56] you do know that
[1:09:57] right see it's passing away friends it
[1:10:02] it's being renewed under a new headship
[1:10:05] the Millennium I want to tell you
[1:10:07] something the Millennium is just upon us
[1:10:10] all we are to be glad and rejoice the
[1:10:12] Millennium is just upon
[1:10:14] us what a tragic and sad loss of
[1:10:19] privilege it is for a son or daughter of
[1:10:21] God Called to be children of God called
[1:10:25] to be children of this great king who is
[1:10:28] going to rule and Reign from his throne
[1:10:30] in the Millennium the world won't end
[1:10:32] it's going to come under new headship
[1:10:35] amen and Christ will reign from the
[1:10:37] throne and his royal family will be the
[1:10:39] executiv of his will they will be the
[1:10:41] dispensers of his Justice and his laws
[1:10:44] I'm here to tell you the world this
[1:10:45] Earth is going to be a grand place oh
[1:10:48] Hallelujah think about it no more smut
[1:10:51] and no more gum and no more sin and no
[1:10:54] more nothing to bring alarm or fear all
[1:10:57] weapons of war will be become Farming
[1:11:00] tools and there will be peace and True
[1:11:02] Justice throughout the
[1:11:05] world
[1:11:07] see so it becomes such a tragic loss as
[1:11:11] Sons and Daughters of God when we're
[1:11:14] called to live under this great King's
[1:11:16] Dominion now that you're being trained
[1:11:19] now for your life there then which isn't
[1:11:23] very far away yet yet living here we are
[1:11:27] Sons and Daughters of the great king and
[1:11:30] yet we live so far below our privileges
[1:11:33] you know I I have been speaking and now
[1:11:36] let me try to bring some clarity to my
[1:11:38] thought so you'll see what I'm aiming at
[1:11:40] today I've been speaking on the title of
[1:11:44] this series opposing the Judgment of
[1:11:48] Heaven we've dealt with it in four
[1:11:50] previous installments I was in Louisiana
[1:11:52] preaching a version of it uh
[1:11:55] kind of a mixed bag of of some of the
[1:11:57] things about it still was still burning
[1:11:59] on my heart and I'm I'm coming today
[1:12:03] because I I want to I want to turn a
[1:12:05] corner and I want I want to come with
[1:12:07] this question if if we have the world
[1:12:11] and I think I've proved it by the Bible
[1:12:13] and by world events that they are
[1:12:15] opposing the Judgment of Heaven in every
[1:12:18] way I don't have it in front of me here
[1:12:21] today I was going to get it and I
[1:12:23] thought about playing the clip and then
[1:12:24] I thought about transcribing it and just
[1:12:26] reading it but I'm trying to save some
[1:12:28] time we might get to it later but just a
[1:12:31] synopsis of it the the Secretary General
[1:12:35] of the United Nations just recently a
[1:12:37] few days some days ago gave a speech and
[1:12:42] and I wouldn't have paid a whole lot of
[1:12:43] attention to it if he was just a talking
[1:12:45] head so we got the world's full of them
[1:12:48] and everybody's got an opinion but this
[1:12:50] is the Secretary General of the UN and
[1:12:52] he's speaking globally for the 10 96 or
[1:12:56] two or four eight whatever Nations it
[1:12:59] let just around 200 Nations over the
[1:13:01] world and he's he comes to the podium
[1:13:04] and he begins to address all of these
[1:13:07] national leaders and their and their uh
[1:13:10] representatives and he he says almost
[1:13:13] his opening line is that the world is
[1:13:17] facing multiple crisis that it has never
[1:13:21] before seen amen that caught my
[1:13:24] attention this isn't just this isn't
[1:13:27] just somebody on the street corner
[1:13:28] holding up a sign this is a man who's in
[1:13:31] the know this is a man who's in those
[1:13:33] back rooms behind closed doors this is a
[1:13:36] man who's dealing with all of those
[1:13:37] ambassadors and trying to trying to find
[1:13:40] the middle ground and he's actually
[1:13:42] announcing to the world probably about
[1:13:45] 70 years late but he's announcing to the
[1:13:48] world we're facing times and threats the
[1:13:51] world has never known and he goes on to
[1:13:54] say that is not
[1:13:56] sustainable and he's not wrong it is not
[1:14:00] sustainable and it won't be sustained he
[1:14:04] he he he comes with a a faint hope that
[1:14:07] if we act now and if we act decisively
[1:14:11] and if we come together as one then we
[1:14:14] can Stave off the the coming uh
[1:14:17] catastrophe the problem that I felt pity
[1:14:21] for that man he seemed like a very nice
[1:14:23] man if I ever got an opportunity to tell
[1:14:25] him I wouldn't want to take hope away
[1:14:27] don't take Hope from people but I would
[1:14:30] like to point out that the problem with
[1:14:32] that is a problem that William bradam
[1:14:34] saw all the way back in the League of
[1:14:37] Nations and in the United Nations and it
[1:14:39] can't work it's a good idea they have
[1:14:42] well many of them have good motives and
[1:14:45] objectives but it can't work because
[1:14:47] it's a it's a 2 nations of unregenerate
[1:14:51] people and it's represented by
[1:14:53] leadership that do not have the new
[1:14:56] birth are under a sin nature and there's
[1:14:58] no way they can have the peace and
[1:15:01] Harmony that they believe they would
[1:15:03] like to
[1:15:06] have I'm glad that the Lord sent us a
[1:15:09] knowing trusting voice friends where
[1:15:12] would you go I you don't know how many
[1:15:16] mornings in my 5:30 chair that I raised
[1:15:20] my hands and thank God for this truth oh
[1:15:24] my goodness I I've heard my my boys you
[1:15:27] know speak favorably of me recently even
[1:15:30] talking about how grateful they were
[1:15:32] that a dad that and I I could say also
[1:15:34] I'm grateful I had a dad that kept me in
[1:15:36] the way and I'm here to tell you I have
[1:15:38] thought many times and I've said Lord
[1:15:40] what would I have told them how would I
[1:15:42] have directed my family who I love and
[1:15:44] my children what would I have said the
[1:15:46] world is in a hopeless situation and
[1:15:48] 33,000 different denominational ideas of
[1:15:52] the Gospel aren't working what would we
[1:15:54] do if God had not come down amen and
[1:15:58] brought a truth in this hour and the and
[1:16:01] the son of man Ministry to tell us how
[1:16:03] to get home and I'm here to tell you
[1:16:06] good news I have good news today I have
[1:16:08] the way
[1:16:12] home
[1:16:15] Hallelujah I don't want to live below my
[1:16:18] privilege amen and so I I thought about
[1:16:22] you know if I am have been preaching on
[1:16:25] opposing the Judgment of
[1:16:27] heaven and here's my question for you
[1:16:30] today that turns a corner do you think
[1:16:34] don't you think maybe this is a leading
[1:16:36] question but if the world has opposed
[1:16:39] the Judgment of Heaven
[1:16:42] globally don't you think there should be
[1:16:45] an opposition to the opposition amen
[1:16:50] amen and don't you think if no one will
[1:16:52] do it I should do it
[1:16:55] and if there's no voice in the world
[1:16:57] that will stand up and say Amen to every
[1:17:00] word I plan to stand up and say Amen to
[1:17:05] every word what do you plan to do bethl
[1:17:08] Tabernacle what do you plan to do Dad's
[1:17:10] and moms and young people what's your
[1:17:13] decision today teenagers I hope you'll
[1:17:16] arrive at our youth camp with a
[1:17:18] determination I pledge allegiance to the
[1:17:20] lamb to the Lamb of God I'm here to be a
[1:17:25] voice for his
[1:17:27] word amen I think that there should be
[1:17:31] an opposition to the
[1:17:34] opposition and I'm here to tell you that
[1:17:36] I have the answer on how to do that
[1:17:41] that's part of the corner turning today
[1:17:44] the answer is the operation in your life
[1:17:49] the operation of perfect Faith amen
[1:17:55] This Global opposing of God's
[1:17:58] words and everybody my goodness
[1:18:02] demonstrations we're no we're not short
[1:18:04] on demonstrations are
[1:18:07] we amen can I um can I go can I be
[1:18:13] politically incorrect
[1:18:15] today be
[1:18:19] okay so much opposition and marching and
[1:18:23] signs and everybody demonstrating to
[1:18:27] have the rights to everything that God
[1:18:29] is against
[1:18:31] yeah and I could just start right there
[1:18:33] and go down a long laundry laundry list
[1:18:35] you already know what I'm talking about
[1:18:36] many many things we could
[1:18:39] name
[1:18:40] marching holding up signs violently
[1:18:44] marching to obtain their rights listen
[1:18:47] friends do you understand that leoa
[1:18:49] means people's rights you understand
[1:18:52] that's the anointing of the God of this
[1:18:54] even age you understand that a real
[1:18:57] sheep a real lamb forfeits their rights
[1:19:00] that's why God is attracted to them
[1:19:04] that's why Jesus was called the Lamb of
[1:19:06] God because he had the right to live he
[1:19:10] had the right to everything he didn't
[1:19:12] want he was a human being brother
[1:19:14] Brandon said he didn't want to
[1:19:16] die he loved life he he had his Brethren
[1:19:20] he was young he had rights to these
[1:19:22] things but he but a lamb lays down its
[1:19:26] rights and that's why the dove canot
[1:19:29] fellowship with the
[1:19:31] lamb that's why when you get a wolflike
[1:19:34] attitude then the dove just takes his
[1:19:37] flight you don't become unborn again
[1:19:39] because that's impossible but the dove
[1:19:42] takes his flight and waits for you to
[1:19:44] get yourself right right sided and
[1:19:47] sometimes we find ourselves like Daniel
[1:19:50] on our hands and knees with our face
[1:19:52] down and but Daniel had to be stirred
[1:19:55] because he was at a time where he
[1:19:57] couldn't be sleeping he couldn't let
[1:20:00] human weakness put him face down and the
[1:20:02] angel kept saying Daniel Get Up Stand Up
[1:20:06] right now like Daniel you and I live in
[1:20:10] a world and very often time it's true
[1:20:13] that I find myself face down and I can't
[1:20:16] get up I want to get up I know I should
[1:20:19] get up I know I need to take a stand but
[1:20:21] the sometimes I need a presence to come
[1:20:24] among me sometimes I need that presence
[1:20:27] to come down and put his hand on me and
[1:20:30] get me up on my up get me up on my knees
[1:20:33] get me on my hands and knees and then
[1:20:35] say now stand upright I need to reveal
[1:20:39] the end time secrets to
[1:20:42] you amen and that's truly where we stand
[1:20:46] today friends we stand at a time just
[1:20:49] like Daniel he saw these things he said
[1:20:51] when will they be and the message was go
[1:20:53] your way Daniel this will not be this is
[1:20:55] for the end time there's going to be a
[1:20:58] people in the earth and this is who this
[1:20:59] is for and you're just going to write it
[1:21:02] in a book so that when they read it
[1:21:03] they'll take courage that there's one
[1:21:05] who can stand them up also that there's
[1:21:08] one that no matter how bad it gets and
[1:21:10] how terrible and how awful it seems
[1:21:13] there is a power there is a presence
[1:21:16] there is a place where you can go and
[1:21:19] you can live and you can dwell in the
[1:21:21] shikina
[1:21:23] glory oh you talking about strength
[1:21:25] you're talking about having the ability
[1:21:27] to prophesy for thou must
[1:21:31] prophesy
[1:21:35] amen everybody's demonstrating for
[1:21:37] rights that to everything that God is
[1:21:42] against and there and the other crowd is
[1:21:45] demonstrating against everything God is
[1:21:48] for that's right demonstrating against
[1:21:51] his chosen people yeah demonstr in
[1:21:55] against their right to live in peace and
[1:21:56] defend their lives yeah and the
[1:21:59] demonstrations are all over the world
[1:22:01] demonstrating against Common Sense
[1:22:04] people in nations are demonstrating
[1:22:06] against the Jews who would never be
[1:22:08] demonstrating against their own
[1:22:10] government had they been so savagely
[1:22:12] attacked by another country it is
[1:22:15] ridiculous and everybody with common
[1:22:17] sense knows it's ridiculous but God is
[1:22:20] for them and that's why Satan is against
[1:22:23] them amen and Satan is for the rights of
[1:22:26] people to do things that are ungodly in
[1:22:29] God's word and and that's why Satan is
[1:22:32] for it that's why Satan is for those
[1:22:35] rights because God is against those
[1:22:37] things and I hope that you are aware
[1:22:40] today young and old alike that God and
[1:22:44] Satan do not
[1:22:46] agree and God's family does not agree
[1:22:49] with this world I do not agree with
[1:22:52] what's going on in this world and I know
[1:22:55] that I've got to be a voice and I need
[1:22:57] somebody to lift me up into a
[1:23:00] presence Hallelujah something that can
[1:23:02] speak through me and it won't be my
[1:23:04] words
[1:23:08] anymore and it's not just words talk is
[1:23:10] cheap if there's no life action behind
[1:23:14] it that's you
[1:23:17] know that's that's where brother Brandon
[1:23:19] would say it like this and I thought
[1:23:20] this makes a lot of sense if you're not
[1:23:23] going to be a Christian please stop
[1:23:25] calling yourself one because that only
[1:23:26] brings a disgrace you see do you agree
[1:23:29] with that and that sensible makes sense
[1:23:31] to me see I and and so so if if I'm
[1:23:36] going to be a real Christian but that's
[1:23:39] why brother Brandon would say you know
[1:23:41] when he was dealing with as I was saying
[1:23:43] here last time when he was dealing with
[1:23:46] that uh the um the SBC that southern B
[1:23:50] Baptist convention there in the end of
[1:23:53] 1953 when they kicked off a program and
[1:23:57] the Billy Graham Evangelistic
[1:23:59] Association would become indirectly
[1:24:01] helpful to it a million more and 54 and
[1:24:05] I told you how brother Brandon you know
[1:24:06] he he first said it like that first
[1:24:08] couple of times what's all this a
[1:24:09] million more and 54 he started saying it
[1:24:11] in the early spring around March of 54
[1:24:14] and uh and and and then and then he
[1:24:17] thought and then he lost track is it 44
[1:24:19] and and then one place he said a million
[1:24:21] more what's this million more and 34 I I
[1:24:23] mean 44 I mean whatever it is you know
[1:24:27] and then later he'd call it 44 and he
[1:24:29] ran with that for a long time and and
[1:24:32] and and what what we found that it was
[1:24:34] just get numbers at all cost it doesn't
[1:24:37] matter what we bring in and not that
[1:24:39] we're going to change anybody but just
[1:24:41] fill up the
[1:24:42] pews and that's what they call success
[1:24:45] and that's what God calls
[1:24:48] distress and that's why a prophet would
[1:24:50] say shockingly shockingly he would say
[1:24:53] listen
[1:24:54] I mean it does and it is scriptural we
[1:24:57] are Lively Stones right so the we're
[1:24:59] supposed to be shaped by the
[1:25:01] word amen that's the whole purpose
[1:25:03] that's what the Holy Ghost is given for
[1:25:06] is to cut and shape you into living
[1:25:08] stones for the living God's presence and
[1:25:11] so brother Brandon would just say in his
[1:25:12] Homespun Kentucky way if you're going to
[1:25:15] bring rocks in from the world and just
[1:25:18] set them in a church and you're not
[1:25:19] going to cut them and shape them and
[1:25:21] groom them he said you'd have been
[1:25:22] better to leave them out there because
[1:25:25] out there they know they're Sinners and
[1:25:27] they know they need God but you bring
[1:25:29] them inside a church and tell them
[1:25:30] they're a Christian just because they
[1:25:32] sit in a church and believe the man on
[1:25:34] Calvary and that and and they're not
[1:25:37] converted he said then they're worse off
[1:25:39] cuz now God can't tell them they they
[1:25:42] don't you can't get a man to repent if
[1:25:44] he doesn't if he thinks he's already
[1:25:46] born again see so I just say if we're
[1:25:49] going to bring them in here let's shape
[1:25:51] them let's mold them let's cut the St
[1:25:54] ownes I want to be that I want you to be
[1:25:57] that that ought to be in our marriages
[1:26:00] and our homes and our young people and
[1:26:02] I'm here to tell you that's what the
[1:26:04] Holy Ghost is given for and you are to
[1:26:06] seek it every day and you are to say
[1:26:08] every day Lord God let the Holy Ghost
[1:26:11] and Fire shape cut mold my
[1:26:15] life to whatever he wants it to
[1:26:19] be see and so if they're demonstrating
[1:26:23] for right to everything God is against
[1:26:26] and they're demonstrating against
[1:26:27] everything God is for then I think there
[1:26:30] should be a demonstration for his word
[1:26:33] amen and if he can't rely on his family
[1:26:38] right to demonstrate that who does he
[1:26:41] have amen amen he's not coming back
[1:26:46] corporately until Revelation
[1:26:49] 19 he doesn't sit his feet don't touch
[1:26:52] this Earth even in the rapture right we
[1:26:55] meet him in the air His Feet Don't Touch
[1:26:57] the Earth again when he when his feet
[1:27:00] lifted off from the earth at the Mount
[1:27:02] of Olives and he ascended up in a cloud
[1:27:04] and they stood there watching him and
[1:27:06] two men dressed in white said why stand
[1:27:09] you here gazing this same Jesus shall
[1:27:11] come again as you've seen him go he will
[1:27:14] come down he'll descend on the Mount of
[1:27:15] Olives it'll divide left and right and
[1:27:18] there's where he'll set up his
[1:27:19] headquarters see and that's an
[1:27:21] Extinction event for humanities coming
[1:27:23] down at the end to rescue his people and
[1:27:27] to set the world up under different
[1:27:28] Administration I want to be a part of
[1:27:31] that oh my and I want you to be a part
[1:27:34] of that see so so if he can't if he's
[1:27:38] not setting his feet corporately back on
[1:27:41] the earth until Revelation 19 then all
[1:27:43] he's got is his family and if he can't
[1:27:45] rely on his family to be a demonstration
[1:27:48] for God's word then who can he rely on
[1:27:51] I'm here to tell you something friends
[1:27:53] it's based on that thinking that I just
[1:27:55] said to you that I say this at the end
[1:27:57] of it it goes from being a privilege to
[1:28:00] being an
[1:28:02] obligation I want to say it again it's
[1:28:04] not just a privilege that you have the
[1:28:06] privilege to be the final voice to the
[1:28:08] final age we're so happy to say oh
[1:28:11] praise God I'm the final voice to the
[1:28:13] final age are
[1:28:15] you do you amen so well maybe not what
[1:28:20] will you will you start in this service
[1:28:23] today today and say Lord I never thought
[1:28:26] about it like that and I want to
[1:28:28] volunteer today I want to be a
[1:28:30] demonstration of the word of God and I'm
[1:28:32] here to tell you the only way that's
[1:28:34] going to operate is by Perfect faith and
[1:28:36] the only way you're going to operate
[1:28:37] perfect faith is to live in a perfect
[1:28:41] realm that's controlled by perfect
[1:28:45] love for God for his word and for one
[1:28:52] another without
[1:28:55] daily
[1:28:57] Fellowship
[1:29:00] you you you fall from
[1:29:04] something much like Adam you remember
[1:29:08] brother Brandon breaks that down and he
[1:29:09] says you know Adam he could you know he
[1:29:13] could say to a tree you I don't want you
[1:29:16] there I want you to come up by the roots
[1:29:18] and be planted over here and the tree
[1:29:19] under because Adam was an amateur God he
[1:29:22] had the power of creation and the tree
[1:29:24] would uproot itself and migrate over
[1:29:25] here and replant itself amen and if the
[1:29:29] wind wasn't blowing in the right
[1:29:30] direction and Eve wanted it changed Adam
[1:29:32] would just change it wind stop that
[1:29:33] direction blow in this direction it's a
[1:29:35] little chilly okay wind warm up two or
[1:29:37] three
[1:29:38] degrees and that's that's the power of
[1:29:41] God yeah he was an amateur God he had
[1:29:44] that kind of power but brother Bram
[1:29:47] explains and I don't have the quote here
[1:29:48] in front of me today but he explains how
[1:29:51] that when Adam after the
[1:29:54] fall Adam lost the sense that he had
[1:29:58] ever had that kind of power amen he lost
[1:30:03] Consciousness I think is brother bram's
[1:30:05] wording of it he lost that conscious he
[1:30:07] lost the understanding he lost the
[1:30:09] memory that he had ever had that kind of
[1:30:12] power and so I'm here to tell you
[1:30:14] something friends the Holy Ghost what do
[1:30:17] you think the Holy Ghost does it
[1:30:20] restores back that Fellowship that Adam
[1:30:24] lost in the garden see and so this is
[1:30:27] why Jesus could say not
[1:30:30] factiously Jesus wasn't joking when he
[1:30:34] said if you say to this mountain be
[1:30:37] moved and cast into the sea he wasn't
[1:30:40] joking but what he attached to it and he
[1:30:43] said and don't doubt in your heart amen
[1:30:46] but believe that what you've said will
[1:30:48] come to pass you shall have
[1:30:51] it and brother brandham even struggled
[1:30:53] with that and now it wasn't that brother
[1:30:55] brandham
[1:30:56] struggled with the fact that God could
[1:30:59] do that what brother brandham struggled
[1:31:02] with was the Bible he said but Jesus
[1:31:05] said if you say and that was his problem
[1:31:08] that's what he couldn't man if I say see
[1:31:11] and it took him a long time and he he
[1:31:16] had to go into the woods and you I've
[1:31:17] heard preached on it before and he he
[1:31:20] kept hearing that voice and it almost
[1:31:21] drove him insane how many squirrels
[1:31:23] three where should they be and then it
[1:31:25] happens a second time and brother
[1:31:27] brandham he he just gets so beside
[1:31:29] himself he said you don't know it feels
[1:31:31] like a Razor's Edge from Insanity you
[1:31:33] you hear something talking to you and he
[1:31:35] said I looked around I kept looking for
[1:31:37] that light that light you say that was
[1:31:39] that light real they took a photograph
[1:31:41] of it am it is in Washington DC I've
[1:31:44] seen it I went there and saw it it is in
[1:31:46] their they won't even let you take it
[1:31:48] they'll just hold it up to you to look
[1:31:49] at it it is scientifically proven to be
[1:31:52] a a snapshot of a supernatural being
[1:31:55] they have no explanation for amen he
[1:31:57] said so I'm looking for that light and
[1:31:59] what's always amazing to me is he told
[1:32:01] everybody years before that happened
[1:32:03] what it was and describe what it looked
[1:32:04] like and how it moved and and he said
[1:32:06] it' be over here and over here they
[1:32:07] wouldn't even allow people to take flash
[1:32:09] photography he said because it'll
[1:32:10] distract me I'll think oh there's the
[1:32:11] light oh no wait that's a flash
[1:32:13] bulb and and he would he would be
[1:32:15] talking to somebody in the audience I
[1:32:17] mean here on the platform then he would
[1:32:19] stop and you go man that's awfully Rude
[1:32:21] why is he he's like left this person and
[1:32:24] he's out here over the audience and he
[1:32:25] said I'm just following that light he
[1:32:26] said oh there it is it's over a colored
[1:32:28] woman over here sister right there and
[1:32:30] tell her her whole life oh it's back
[1:32:32] over here on a man yes sir you you've
[1:32:34] got this that and the other oh sir you
[1:32:35] didn't know you had that kind of Faith
[1:32:37] did you see and Jesus Christ stand on
[1:32:40] your feet Jesus Christ makes you whole
[1:32:42] and it happened tens of thousands of
[1:32:45] times see and so he he's there in the
[1:32:49] woods I mean looking for that light why
[1:32:52] would why wouldn't he yeah that's what
[1:32:54] it always guided him that's what it
[1:32:56] always depended on and he's he's so
[1:32:58] beside himself he starts crying out and
[1:33:01] I and and I just went back to the tape
[1:33:03] and heard it recently and he's crying
[1:33:04] out who are you yeah what do you want
[1:33:08] yeah I mean you you sometimes we get
[1:33:10] that way in life friends where life just
[1:33:12] comes and you're not aware that it's God
[1:33:15] moving in your life and you think oh
[1:33:18] it's a trial i' done something wrong or
[1:33:20] this is some kind of punishment and it's
[1:33:22] none of that it's God trying to draw you
[1:33:25] to somewhere let me encourage you today
[1:33:28] we're at the end of the Earth's history
[1:33:30] and God is looking for people to be a
[1:33:33] demonstration of his
[1:33:35] word hallelujah I just I just would say
[1:33:37] to you today throw up your hands and
[1:33:39] surrender and say me Lord me me
[1:33:43] me
[1:33:45] Hallelujah give me some clarity of why
[1:33:47] I'm here what I'm to
[1:33:49] do and I'm here to tell you that's only
[1:33:53] no able in the Realms of perfect faith
[1:33:57] and that realm is only accessible when
[1:34:00] the spirit of God is in your life and
[1:34:02] that's only happens when you're reading
[1:34:04] your Bible and every day and you're
[1:34:06] praying and you're in church and you're
[1:34:09] in fellowship with the Saints and you
[1:34:11] move trash out of your life out of your
[1:34:14] home out of your
[1:34:16] entertainments
[1:34:18] amen this is ABCs but this works yes
[1:34:23] amen see
[1:34:25] without daily Fellowship you you fall
[1:34:28] from something yes see and so God has
[1:34:32] ordained a chosen
[1:34:34] bride at the end time and I'm I I'm
[1:34:37] going to purposely close in the next 10
[1:34:40] 10 15 minutes max on
[1:34:43] purpose make these statements I'm just
[1:34:46] getting started
[1:34:49] truly God has ordained a chosen bride
[1:34:54] at the end time to operate at maximum
[1:35:01] potential Rejoice yeah that's his
[1:35:05] plan that's his desire say what is God's
[1:35:07] desire for me I just just told
[1:35:10] you now whatever that looks like God
[1:35:13] knows but I'm here to tell you
[1:35:16] everything that's happening in your life
[1:35:17] we're so close to the Finish Line we're
[1:35:21] so close to the change we're so close to
[1:35:23] that changing over friends you're going
[1:35:26] to cross over and and I know we worry
[1:35:28] about our bills and we worry about taxes
[1:35:31] and we worry about friends and we worry
[1:35:33] about school and we worry about a job
[1:35:35] and we and that's fine you need to be
[1:35:37] studious you need to plan you need those
[1:35:40] who who who who fail to plan plan to
[1:35:42] fail I uh that I learned that that's all
[1:35:45] true I've experienced that and and it
[1:35:48] and and I'm not saying we don't dot our
[1:35:49] eyes and cross our te's and check our
[1:35:51] p's and q's I get all of that we should
[1:35:54] do that but I'm here to tell you a
[1:35:55] prophet said that when you cross over
[1:35:57] the first thing that's going to go
[1:35:58] through your mind I'm glad a prophet
[1:36:00] knew the first thing would go through my
[1:36:02] mind he said the first thing that'll go
[1:36:04] through your mind is why was I ever
[1:36:07] worried amen amen where sometimes we sit
[1:36:11] and we grieve so bad over our life and
[1:36:13] he said one of these days you'll cross
[1:36:15] over you'll sit down under a tree and
[1:36:17] just laugh about
[1:36:19] it Hallelujah I like laughing Hallelujah
[1:36:24] I like laughing at the Devil I like
[1:36:26] laughing at my troubles I like saying no
[1:36:28] trouble's
[1:36:30] over hallelujah oh the devil's Bound for
[1:36:33] a thousand years trouble's
[1:36:37] over everything the devil took from me I
[1:36:39] got it back anyway Everything Jesus
[1:36:42] promised me that I lose nothing he said
[1:36:45] everything God ordained for me that even
[1:36:47] even if I lost it and even if I was
[1:36:49] complicit in its loss this message today
[1:36:52] comes to give it back to
[1:36:55] you all that God ordained for you to
[1:37:00] be so since it was
[1:37:04] purposed by God here's here's something
[1:37:07] to give you a little lighter
[1:37:10] step because I I I don't know what all
[1:37:14] you might be facing and even if you tell
[1:37:16] me I might not have all the answers you
[1:37:18] need oh I can always go back this at
[1:37:21] this stage of the game I've lived long
[1:37:22] enough I've been around the world have
[1:37:23] preached long enough that just about any
[1:37:26] problem you show up with I'll have an
[1:37:27] answer there's plenty of knowledge in
[1:37:29] the Bible and my experiences and I've
[1:37:31] seen what works and what doesn't work uh
[1:37:33] so no worries there but but sometimes
[1:37:36] friends you know as well as me you get
[1:37:39] in a
[1:37:41] situation and you need an answer that
[1:37:44] only God can give
[1:37:48] you you you get like job you get like
[1:37:51] Daniel you're on your hands and knees
[1:37:53] you're like job he said if I could just
[1:37:56] find where he lives he said I'd crawl up
[1:37:59] on his porch oh my said I'd knock at his
[1:38:03] door oh God help me and he said he
[1:38:06] wouldn't turn me away oh my the
[1:38:09] government might turn you away friends
[1:38:11] you thought you had might turn you away
[1:38:13] people who really love you might say I'm
[1:38:15] sorry I can't help you but this one can
[1:38:17] help you this one won't turn you away he
[1:38:21] said he won't turn me away he'll open
[1:38:23] the door and he'll put strength in me
[1:38:26] why because he's determined that I
[1:38:28] finish this thing and I'm depending on
[1:38:31] him for that I want to finish this thing
[1:38:34] and I want to finish it in Victory and I
[1:38:36] don't want to just stay down like Daniel
[1:38:38] a face down unconscious can't take it
[1:38:42] Daniel stand on your feet it's the end
[1:38:46] time and I need a demonstration of my
[1:38:49] word Shake It Off stand on your feet
[1:38:53] Hallelujah

[1:39:01] I'm going to tell you something that's
[1:39:02] going to
[1:39:03] disqualify any need to worry about
[1:39:07] anything now you better know I got
[1:39:10] confidence in saying that I got
[1:39:11] something to say and I wouldn't say that
[1:39:14] lightly I'm here to tell I'm going to
[1:39:16] say it again I've got an answer for you
[1:39:19] that will that will render no matter
[1:39:22] what you're dealing with with it will
[1:39:24] render it as as of no effect on you amen
[1:39:28] amen just this simple little piece of
[1:39:31] knowledge that will be a super weapon
[1:39:34] for you to beat the devil over the head
[1:39:37] with that everything you've ever been
[1:39:40] through and going through and will go
[1:39:42] through because you will they were known
[1:39:45] of God ordained of God LED of God
[1:39:49] planned for by God equipped by God and
[1:39:53] he has every strength every peace every
[1:39:57] Power everything you need he already

[1:42:27] next time stand up with
[1:42:32] me
[1:42:36] amen this is where we'll get into next
[1:42:40] time brother
[1:42:41] brandham I boy I I thought all morning
[1:42:45] how to say
[1:42:47] this I still don't know
[1:42:50] quite so let me just try to say it as
[1:42:52] best I
[1:42:54] can without you giving you the wrong
[1:42:59] thought the message perfect
[1:43:02] Faith the brother Brandon preached there
[1:43:05] in
[1:43:07] 65 it has been a
[1:43:10] um wow I can't use that
[1:43:13] word it has been a glorious sermon to me
[1:43:18] all my life and simultaneously a very
[1:43:22] Grievious sermon
[1:43:27] I mean that I love it so much and it
[1:43:31] paints a picture in front of me that I
[1:43:33] want so bad but I I guess I'm like Paul
[1:43:38] how to perform it how to do it how to
[1:43:41] get there I hear Brother brandham
[1:43:43] talking about what it can do what it
[1:43:45] will do what it and what and and this
[1:43:48] has to be in place and this has to be in
[1:43:49] place and this has to be in place okay
[1:43:51] thank you sir but how do I get that and
[1:43:54] this has to be in place okay thank you
[1:43:56] now how do I get that and this has to be
[1:43:58] in place thank you but please tell me
[1:44:01] how to get
[1:44:03] that and I the Lord put it on my heart
[1:44:05] and I just listened to it again and I
[1:44:07] had to take a deep breath because it
[1:44:08] always leaves me in that condition
[1:44:10] yeah it just seems like that it's
[1:44:14] something that's still must be out there
[1:44:16] and we're going to need some
[1:44:17] Supernatural thing to come along I'm
[1:44:19] here to tell you I found out that's not
[1:44:21] true right right I found out that all
[1:44:24] along I had the answer right under my
[1:44:26] nose and brother brandham tied it to
[1:44:29] this principle like a husband to His
[1:44:32] companion and a husband and wife and
[1:44:35] brother brandham says faith and love are
[1:44:37] kin folk and in other places he talks
[1:44:40] about how that they're how that these
[1:44:42] kinds of things are married to one
[1:44:44] another amen see and that God there it's
[1:44:48] not hard to get into this realm that
[1:44:53] I've spent an hour telling you about or
[1:44:55] 50 some minutes right G that I've spent
[1:44:58] this time telling you about it's not
[1:45:01] hard to get there it's not way off in
[1:45:04] the misty blue somewhere over a
[1:45:07] rainbow all it
[1:45:09] takes is your love affair with
[1:45:15] Christ coming
[1:45:18] together and I don't know how it never
[1:45:21] occurred to me and just explains the
[1:45:24] confidence that a husband has to a wife
[1:45:26] he loves and she has a confidence that
[1:45:29] because he loves and there's just and
[1:45:31] we're not just we're not just talking
[1:45:32] about Fidelity to one another we're
[1:45:34] we're talking about somebody that I know
[1:45:37] will be my friend somebody that I know
[1:45:40] cares about me and somebody that'll find
[1:45:43] something to do for me that I won't even
[1:45:45] have to tell her what to do she'll know
[1:45:47] what I like and I'll come across through
[1:45:50] the house and find it done and exactly
[1:45:52] like liked it and she knew that and
[1:45:55] she'll go to a certain place and
[1:45:57] something will happen and she'll see and
[1:45:59] it'll be a little surprise and she'll
[1:46:01] know somebody loves her I'm here to tell
[1:46:04] you something friends and that is what
[1:46:06] operates perfect Faith so I would say to
[1:46:09] you today don't struggle for perfect
[1:46:11] Faith check on your love affair with
[1:46:14] christl do that will you bow your heads
[1:46:18] all over the
[1:46:20] building I'm here to tell you I want to
[1:46:22] say it again again and
[1:46:23] again what is your heart toward God and
[1:46:27] His
[1:46:27] word we're not just talking about a love
[1:46:30] for God I a lot of people have that it's
[1:46:34] genuine it's absolutely genuine they
[1:46:37] have a great love for God but that's
[1:46:40] different than having the love of God
[1:46:43] the love of God comes by the baptism of
[1:46:45] the Holy Spirit and the baptism of the
[1:46:48] holy spirit is not hard to get it's just
[1:46:50] a complete surrender of your whole heart
[1:46:52] and Life to God that's all it is and you
[1:46:55] repent that was only that was always the
[1:46:57] requirement and people try for years to
[1:47:00] get to that level and they never get
[1:47:02] there because they hold on to something
[1:47:05] that they won't repent and surrender and
[1:47:08] they try to come to God and try to get
[1:47:10] that seal of the holy spirit all heads
[1:47:12] bowed please I know I'm still preaching
[1:47:14] but all heads
[1:47:15] bowed and and it's not hard all it takes
[1:47:20] is a complete total
[1:47:23] absolute surrender where you say Lord
[1:47:27] you're like Jacob when Jacob got to that
[1:47:29] angel you've heard brother Jason say
[1:47:31] this so many times I've said it so many
[1:47:34] times when Jacob got to that point Jacob
[1:47:38] was so done with being
[1:47:41] Jacob when I found Christ I'll tell you
[1:47:44] something friends from my own experience
[1:47:46] when I found the Lord Jesus I didn't
[1:47:50] want to be me anymore
[1:47:53] and whenever I find me that one of that
[1:47:55] part of me that's still alive whenever I
[1:47:58] find him alive and he's a little too
[1:48:00] alive I like to take the word of God and
[1:48:03] conch him in the head and knock him back
[1:48:05] out I want to be a demonstration I want
[1:48:08] to be a walking demonstration of the
[1:48:12] love of God the faith of God the peace
[1:48:15] of God that the the the the
[1:48:21] everything of every potential that God
[1:48:24] has for me
[1:48:27] father thank you for this sermon
