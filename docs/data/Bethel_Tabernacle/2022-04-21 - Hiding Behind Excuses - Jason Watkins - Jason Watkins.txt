to have you here happy to have sister amy's family and different ones and we've got a number of prayer requests uh we'll get to just shortly we're going to go immediately to the scripture and into the book of joshua and we're going to start at chapter 10 and i just covet your prayers i've you know every time you you think you have the lord's whole mind on it and he just keeps adding and adding and so i've been working on this thought now for some number of days started up um early monday and uh right off the bat so just trusting the lord for it you come ready to hear the word really now ready to hear the word amen god bless you greet you and we're going to look right into joshua chapter 10. we'll get to our prayer request just in a few minutes want to read from verse 6 joshua chapter 10 and we will begin at verse 6. and the men of gibeon sent unto joshua to the camp to gilgal saying slack not thy hand from thy servants come up to us quickly and save us and help all the kings of the amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us so joshua ascended from gilgal he and all the people of war with him and all the mighty men of valor and the lord said unto joshua fear them not for i have delivered them into thine hand there shall not a man of them stand before thee joshua therefore came unto them suddenly i like that when you get a word from god like that no they're not there won't be one man stand against you joshua didn't wait he went to him suddenly man there's no no doubt here and joshua therefore came unto them suddenly and went up from gilgal all night and the lord discomforted them before israel and slew them with a great slaughter at gibeon and chased them along the way that goeth up to beth iran and smote them uh to asaka and to makeda and it came to pass as they fled from before israel and were in the going down to beth heron that the lord cast great cast down great stones from heaven upon them in asga and they died there were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of israel slew with the sword then spake joshua to the lord in the day when the lord delivered up the amorites before the children of israel and he set in the sight of israel's son stand thou still upon gibeon and thou moon in the valley of agilent and the sun stood still in the moon state until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies is not this written in the book of jasher so the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and hastened not to go down about a whole day and there was no day like that before it or after it that the lord hearkened unto the voice of a man for the lord fought for israel and joshua returned and all israel with him unto the camp to gilgal but these five kings fled and hid themselves in the caves of makita and it was told joshua's saying the five kings are found hid in the cave of makeda and joshua said roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave and set men by it for to keep them and stay ye not but pursue after your enemies and smite behind most of them suffer them not to enter into their cities for the lord your god hath delivered them into your hand and it came to pass when joshua and the children of israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter till they were consumed that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities and all the people returned to the camp to joshua at makeda in peace none moved his tongue against any of the children of israel then said joshua open the mouth of the cave and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave and they did so and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave and the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jarmoth the king of lakish and the king of eglon and it came to pass when they brought out those kings unto joshua that joshua called for all the men of israel and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him come near and put your feet upon the necks of these kings and they came near and put their feet upon the necks of them and joshua said unto them fear not nor be dismayed be strong and of a good courage for thus shall the lord do to all your enemies against whom you fight and afterward joshua smote them and slew them and hang them on five trees and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening and it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun that joshua commanded and they took them down off the trees cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid and laid great stones in the cave's mouth which remain unto this very day let's pray father we commit ourselves into your hands for service just now and i pray you will help me lord with the burden of the word that's on my heart for the people and lord i stand here lord with them waiting in your presence for what you have to say to us and to us all you shall say it lord i'm no exception you have lord taken me through great pondering as i've thought about this sermon and father i have found all throughout this thought lord i found myself lord needing to needing to say father help me help me also lord pass me not old gender savior why on others thou art calling do not pass me by lord may that be on the heart of every person we pray in jesus name amen god bless your friends you can be seated amen praise the lord just uh making sure i have all my prayer requests and i don't want to miss any all right praise the lord i want to by the help of the lord speak to you this evening on a title that i'm going to take hiding behind excuses hiding behind excuses it was quite a challenge that the lord gave to joshua and it required joshua to believe it i i don't think that there was any notion in god's mind that when he said to joshua i'm going to give you a complete victory and go take off go get them don't be afraid not at all don't have any fear for i have delivered them into your hand thank you sir and there shall not even a man stand before you you know why you don't read in the text anywhere where joshua begins to say well you know lord thank you but now you know could i have a a sign from heaven or could i have this or could i have that and are you sure maybe we should go forth a little more carefully the bible says joshua went quickly he rapidly closed on him he didn't he didn't he didn't play around you can tell that joshua was not interested in waiting he was not interested in reasoning he was not interested in you know military tactics it didn't say well you know we'll we'll do this we'll do that we'll do this with that and then we'll we'll get an upper hand on them you know joshua had already done some fighting joshua had already met the captain of the lord's souls joshua already knew what would cause failure he had already cleansed the camp of that failure when joshua goes into this battle you know he's he had learned a hard lesson of why they were here because it was the gibeonites who had who had deceived him and come like as if they'd come from a far country you remember the story and we become from a far country and you know we want a treaty with you and joshua made it and then suddenly when all the other five kings of the amorites heard about that you know if we'd have backed up and started from the beginning of the chapter you read how that they had a war council of these you know this league of nations and they said you know gibeon is in is in cahoots with them let's go let's go smash them and so now gibeon sends to joshua and says now we made a deal and uh yeah we kind of deceived you but you made the deal because joshua didn't really consult the lord and so you know joshua learned i i'm glad i like to think that i learn from my mistakes i i like to think that when i strip up and stumble then i say lord i'm not going to do that again and i'll be i'll be on the lookout next time for the enemy you know i i've said many years that mistakes you know are are are okay we learn by mistakes there were times when even in raising children and and i i would allow sometimes one of my children even if i knew it was making a mistake as long as i knew i could recover him and bail him out and i'd let him i'd let him go into that knowing it was gonna blow up and it would just my experience not that i was smarter than any of them but my experience told me that's that's going to that's not going to end well and then it would it get in a situation i'd come and say now son here's a teachable moment now just remember next time when you see that you see mistakes aren't so bad as long as you learn from them and don't repeat them but it was you know it's constantly israel was constantly and not just israel you know the old saying is that mankind is is constantly he never learns from history he's doomed to repeat it and repeat it and repeat it because he never learns from it and i i you know god gave us this bible as examples and paul said it's for our examples these people made mistakes so you don't have to you can actually learn how to run a family how to run a business how to run your life how to keep a testimony above above above ridicule how to how to be an honorable person my wife and i were commenting the other day in a little discussion i said you know it just goes to show you that that the bible really does it really is an instruction book for living and if people would just live by the standards of the bible the bible knows how you should run your life the bible is filled with knowledge and and and and people who who don't study it and don't read it and don't memorize it and don't practice what it what it preaches to you well then you know you're you're just going to be up against it that's all i can tell you but you know i'm not saying that that you know the christian life is a life of ease and fact is you make yourself a target but i've told you again and again i've said it and so say i again we don't live by the mercies of lucifer we know we shouldn't worry about that you should just say i'm going to fearlessly keep the word of god and when the enemy comes i'm going to advance upon him quickly i'm not going to when i see something uh a seat of discrepancy in my life or in my home you should be ready to take the sword of the word you should be ready just to cut it out of your life it ought not to be that god has to beat us to death to get us to learn a lesson and ought not to be a heavenly father will continue to chastise you until you learn the lesson but it but that's not that's never his desire his desire is that you learn it his desire is that you put it into practice and that you you you you you organize your life according to the word of god there is nothing like the word of god for organizing your life i wonder how joshua and you know the the the name joshua is the same as jesus and so you know when you're when you're seeing joshua here you can just think of the lord yourself and of christ but because that's the that's the uh the type the shadow that's the um that's the imagery the bible imagery it's showing and i i wonder how joshua would have reacted if those leaders would have shrank from the challenge of the moment joshua said now i want you captains of war you you've had a great victory today and the lord fought for you and in fact he killed more enemy than you did but now i want you to i want i want you to fully maximize what it is that happened here today this was more than just a fight this was more than god's showing you you know i i i'll save you you know when you're in a burning house i'll come in and pull you out don't worry no this was going to be more than that god was wanting to make this a teachable moment to say what you've seen today i can do that every time if you will obey me and you'll believe me and you'll put my commandments into practice then then this result you saw today will be the same result tomorrow and next year and it won't matter whether it's five kings or fifty kings or five hundred kings you'll not lose a man the son will even stand still and the heavens will back you so i wonder how it would have made him feel at such a monumental moment in jewish history to say come out here i want you to i want we're going to complete some imagery here we're going to show the devil something we're going to put fear in the enemy i want you to put your feet on the necks of these five kings these men who set on thrones and wielded scepters and thought they were better than you these people who would have slain you and your wife and your little ones and now today they're they're they were hiding from you and they're in they were in a cave we brought them out they're laying on the ground i want you to come and put your foot on their neck see i mean when we you know i had some notes i wasn't sure i'd get to them i think i'll jump ahead and just because just for the sake of you understanding uh the meaning in the verse because it's relevant when you when you look at joshua saying therefore you know uh those kings on uh he says here and it came to pass verse 24 when they brought out those kings unto joshua the joshua called for all the men of israel and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him come near don't stay back come near put your feet on the necks of these kings and they came near and put their feet upon the necks of them because now this is exactly you know what what was going to become the standard in fact as david would write about it in psalms 110 the lord said unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool and that's exactly what these kings had become they had become the footstool of these mighty men of war put your foot on the necks is literally making them your footstool joshua you notice that joshua actually joshua didn't do it it was his subjects that did it see joshua's christ just like our lord jesus he's already bruised the head of satan he's already made him his footstool i'm here to tell you but he wants you to make the enemy your footstool he goes on in psalms 110 it's one through five the lord said unto my lord set out my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool verse 2 the lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of zion rule thou in the midst of thine enemies what a statement you're to rule not at distance in the midst of your enemies thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning thou hast the dew of thy youth the lord now this is what's so beautiful this is what paul picks up the lord hath sworn and will not repent thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek the lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath i'm here to tell you that that is a that is a sign to us because a greater than than solomon is here and even uh we had melchizedek but now there's a greater than melchizedek and you're living in the time when the bride has become the full image of the word of god and you're to have your feet on the neck the is to be under your feet if there was ever a time when god was going to prove his supremacy of his word it's in you and it's happening right now so then it begs the question i'm sure you would agree i wonder how joshua then would have reacted if those leaders had shrank from such a challenge because of challenge it was you know i have found too many times and i know you won't disagree with this because we're all human beings and we know the tendencies of human nature i found too many times a tendency in people and when i say people please just remember this sermon burned holes in me before i'm using it to burn holes in you will you go with me i found too many times a tendency let's just say in us to offer very convincing excuses for failing to meet expectations divine opportunities achievements that we could achieve in christ you know when potential and a noble purpose runs high but performance runs very low people tend to shield themselves quickly they will shield themselves with every kind of excuse reasons why we couldn't meet the challenge of the hour you know even even when fully provisioned amen yeah i mean you know even when fully equipped to do so i'm here to tell you we're not unprovisioned god has given us a word in this hour there is no excuse i know we offer them but they don't hold water there is a challenge of this hour in the time of melchizedek to put your feet upon the neck of the enemy and put him under your feet god's not interested in your excuses what excuse would you give to god to hold unforgiveness an unpardonable sin one of two unpardonable sins to blaspheme the holy ghost and to refuse to forgive they're both unpardonable you can't get past that jesus said if you will not forgive someone their trespasses your heavenly father will not forgive your trespasses how is it that that we would think to hold you know feelings against a brother or a sister or even even feelings against anybody anybody brother branham talks about how that we know we're not even from here we're we're aliens one of the citizens of here that the people who are citizens here uh of here and this is the only life they'll they'll ever have brother branham said let them cut in front of you in line go ahead and take the back go ahead get at the back of the line let people ahead of you it's the rights i i don't have citizen rights here i'm not from here i'm a citizen of another world amen and and and we're always sometimes we we get in that same vein of of people's rights that's laodicea and you know nobody's gonna you know take my rights away from me what rights uh brother bannon says you've got all kinds of rights but a sheep surrenders its rights you know what would we how would we hold since we forgive in christ i mean how would you not forgive if you're a christian considering what christ forgave you of considering that god god swapped the completely guilty for the he said he swapped the the the the innocent the completely innocent for the totally guilty jesus was completely innocent and the bible says the bible says consider him who endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest you be weird in your mind and faint you haven't yet suffered unto blood my goodness i'm sorry somebody stepped you know in front of you i'm sorry you broke a fingernail and that's about that you're you're your worst your worst uh thing con considering what you're headed to considering the world that's so wonderful that no trial here will even be thought of it's nothing more than a broken finger now goodness see so when a noble purpose when a very high purpose a very great challenge is put forth but you know performance is low we we tend to shield ourselves with excuses reasons why we couldn't meet the challenge even when fully provisioned to do so right away we give ourselves a pass amen it's the truth it's the truth i had to stand in the mirror for for today's wednesday i've had to stand in the mirror for three days and go amen we tend friends what we end up doing is we insulate ourselves from blame we tend and here's here's how it generally goes we we diminish responsibility you know that that we're facing or a responsibility that we're charged with by god we tell ourselves that it's okay it's not really that big of a deal we really don't need to worry too much about it you know this happens that tendency is bad enough just in and of itself but it becomes very bad when this this happens to be you know when when we face the challenges of the word of god that challenge us to excel and the word of god calls on you in this day and this hour to excel to be spiritually minded to cast down vain imaginations and this is the age where we got a lot to cast down it tells you to be strong in faith be vigilant be ready for a fight beast be spiritual pray read your bible attend the house of god and people have diminished that i'll tell you something friends i'm i i i love the the you know i love the brothers and all the efforts they're doing and the equipment to you know to give the audience streaming and uh a very good high quality i believe in professionalism don't get me wrong but you know we're not we're not after a marketing campaign not after a marketing campaign i i don't want to make it too comfortable i don't want to make it too good i you know i i i don't want to make it to where people can just be comfortable no believer should be comfortable never attending the house of god [Music] in some cases it's impossible i understand that i'm just saying that there should never be a comfortableness in your heart you should always be asking the lord help me to be part of a live assembly if i got it if i gotta change a job then change it if i gotta lose a career then lose it and let god give you the career you need let's let god add to the church daily such as he will not interested in marketing trying to gain members here i love the vision of everything i'm part of it i push it as hard as anybody but let's just remember that's my message to my brethren to just remember brothers it's not we're not a denomination see and so we we find ourselves to where when we receive challenges in the word of god challenges in this dark day challenges to be a light challenge is to shine with holiness we minimalize it it's not that big of a deal well brother branham said well okay but brother ham said a lot of things you know i mean he's just a man right you do know he made a few mistakes right well since i don't know but only one man who didn't yeah see thank god i that doesn't hinder me that helps me because then i say man i've got a chance then amen see and so we we tell ourselves it's okay we we diminish the responsibility in our own minds that we're facing or something that we're charged with i mean even when the cost of failing is high even when the cost of failing can have long lasting far-reaching consequences harmful neglects to our own selves and or even harmful neglects to those who we love most or claim to or should it's in human nature friends and you need to know the enemy see and you're more you're more of an enemy to you than lucifer is amen because lucifer can't keep you out of the glories of god but you can limit your glories see you can hinder the holy spirit's work that satan can't hinder the holy spirit but you can satan's never been able to stop the lord but you actually can see you're his children bill that's why the bible says let the mind which was in christ be in you you have to allow that you have to permit that thing he's not a he doesn't want a robot he's not going to force himself on you we've been given a great challenge in this uh in this hour and i'm here to tell you friends you know it as well as i know it we are in a day where everybody has an excuse and nobody takes blame and nobody takes responsibility and it's always somebody else's fault it doesn't even matter what happens nobody goes to jail nobody gets fined nobody uh you know the banks do this and the mortgages do this and the government does this and everybody rants and raves and social media lights up and people beat on the desk something's got to be done at the end of the day nothing gets done remember brother branham had to in his in in that spiritual dream about herding cattle and remember he's with um brother welch evans i believe if memory serves and they're driving cattle up one side of a river and it's very rough on this side the other side's very very smooth and brother branham says do i believe it's brother evans he says now brother evans you keep pushing you keep pushing them but i'm going to spur my horse and i'm going to ride i'm going to gallop ahead at a hard and a hard ride because up the way there's a crossing and if i don't get there to block these cattle they'll immediately cross over to that smooth side and that's not what we want we will never reach the destination if we go up the left side you can't get all the way there you've got to stay on the right side but because the right side was rough and hard it was a harder way and the cattle wouldn't naturally choose it see and so i'm not saying you're a horrible person i'm saying you're a human being but know thy enemy and understand that these principles in god's word are written here for a reason and we need to have courage today to say enough excuses i'm going to be a spiritual person i'm not going to be carnal why because i said so because god doesn't want me to be i'm going to bring my home under the guidance of the holy spirit i want my marriage i want my children i want the church i want the atmosphere to be charged to be a place where god can move it's not hindered we can know it would be a good thing but we also know there's a cost and when cost is involved where the excuses fly excuse as a noun is a reason or explanation put forward to defend or justify a fault or an offense there are a lot of excuses we use when we give ourselves a pass for not living strong spiritual lifestyles we offer ourselves and we offer god a lot of explanation to defend or justify that fault and i'm you know i'm not sure i thought about this i thought you know i i'm not sure who we offer uh the the most excuses to when we fail to uh to attain the victories that christ secured for us he secured a lot of victories i'm not i'm not really sure at times you know who it is we're trying to convince more do we do we try to convince god more or ourselves i i certainly know who who accepts uh our explanations more uh between you know between me and the lord and i'll give you a clue it ain't the lord okay i give myself excuses i give him excuses and i'm not sure who i give the most excuses to but i i for sure know which one accepts them the most and it ain't the lord an excuse excuses and and and passes you know that we give ourselves to to have carnality in our lives i want to tell you something friends carnality in your lives is a big ticket item it's not a small thing you can't imagine what a hindrance what what victories you could have and what achievements you could achieve for the kingdom of god i know it might be at a cost but i'm here to tell you the reward is out of this world hallelujah there's nothing so satisfying when you lay your head on your pillow at night and try to drift off to sleep and you can close your eyes and know that you are walking pleasing to the lord walking in his will walking in his statutes raise up in the morning open your eyes to a sunlit room and say good morning father what do you have on the tap for me today and know that your feet are going to hit the ground in the name of jesus christ and you're going to go forward conquering it in victory you're going to put your foot and people are going to see it on the neck of the enemy in fact friends i'm here to tell you that you know we almost always unfortunately we almost always accept our own excuses for carnality we come on on it come on holy people own it we accept our own excuses for carnality so easy see who's who's more you know i know which one is the easiest to persuade in it and again it ain't the lord in fact i don't think god accepts our feeble excuses at all not even a little bit you know brother branham tells a story and i i had some quotes i was going to read but i'm just trying to save time tonight brother branham starts telling a story about a man who was very sick and he was dying and laying on his deathbed and brother branham was there in the home and trying to offer some comfort and the wife was sitting there in the children and you know and and and and the lady was you know pleading brother branham isn't there there's something you can do well sister you know we've we've prayed we we're asking the lord let's just let's just you know let's just keep keep calm and and and you know and she's just this is her husband this is i mean if he dies this is catastrophic for their family this isn't a small thing i mean life is on the line and it's going to have a reverberating trickle-down effect to the wife and to the children for decades this isn't little and brother branham is just you know trying to give her a few words of comfort trying to encourage her faith and and she's pressing god's prophet pressing him you know i need more than i need more of an answer isn't there something that can be done and brother branham just he kind of says now you know sister look he says i you know i know where i know where this is going and he said now you see i mean i could do more but he would need to show me a vision now see if god would just show me a vision well then oh buddy let me tell you every devil would give way on that remember brother branham says if god told me george washington was going to raise from the dead tomorrow he said i'd invite the entire world to come see it because he'd never seen one of those visions fail but he got comfortable you're not going to throw something at me are you brother i'm not comfortable in that he's he's admitting he's owning it in this story you can go read it yourself and he says but you know if he would just show me a vision uh then then you know it could mean a lot more then we could go in there in the name of the lord and that be the end of it and brother branham you know well sister we'll keep praying god bless you have a nice wonderful day god be god richly bless you god be with you till we meet again and out the door he goes and he goes home and he's sitting there and he's in his study and he's thinking about that and the holy spirit starts turning screws on him and says what about my word why why are you waiting on a vision for why do you not have the exact same faith just because i said it just because many times as you've seen me move and keep these words and you've never seen me lose a battle and i've stood with you all these years and the best thing you can tell this woman is you need a vision amen what about the fact that by his stripes you are healed already what about the fact that if you say to this mountain what about the fact that if you ask anything in my name and don't doubt it in your heart and brother branham he realized it oh he'd been rebuked by the holy spirit the holy spirit didn't come and say billy you did a really nice job i want to pat you and commend you for comforting that sister lord send him back down the road go back stop giving excuses that was nothing but an excuse because you are afraid to believe my word and brother branham had to repent for it and then god come on the scene and healed the man no vision just based on the word see so a lot of times friends i i tell you that story not to ridicule our dear prophet but but to but to get you to understand that this thing can happen even to god's most faithful servants i'm glad it never happened to the lord jesus i love that quote brother matt read here i think he read it here in church read it in the men's breakfast and how that you know satan had been used to used to defeating god's champions and how he defeated you know defeated abraham got him lying and defeated moses and got him with a temper and defeated david he got him into this said but when he jumped on jesus that was a 5 000 watt vote and said it singed his wings and he jumped back and he realized this ain't moses this is more than moses and so that didn't hold up in the in the face of god's complaint saying a prophet saying well lord if you'd have just given me a vision that didn't hold water god did not accept that excuse he he absolutely rejected that as worthless you should have believed my word and went back and prayed for that man based on faith in the word where's your faith see god wanted to know why he didn't just go based on the promise in his word brother branham comes to this story of standing in the gap and it's interesting and i'm running a little bit of risk to to read too much and i won't read too much but it's a familiar story to you brother branham says so i'm he's driving down the road and and he's he's he's he's hatched a plan he's burned out on people he developed a complex and wearied himself and you know let took rejection too personally and you know he he just finally he just wants to go be a trapper in the wilderness and he's literally going to give god every kind of logical sensible reason why he should be able to do it and he says you know and and god has warned him you know he says coming down home to arizona i was coming now into utah and as i got there coming down from the mountains about 20 miles out of the city said said as i've told you about the morning about the squirrels and all these things how somebody went to talking to me a voice just the same as you hear mine i know it sounds neurotically but as i've got through expressing have i ever told you anything that wasn't right a voice got to talking to me i was talking to him and it said carry out your plans and you'll be like that and he was he had seen a bum and he said carry out your plans you'll be like that bum and brother branham had seen a had seen a man that reminded him he and then he saw a vision of and and there was this there was this certain man in a dream he'd been an alcoholic and he was a bomb himself and and now brother branham said in the dream he said i was standing there in the cold and it was dark and he said oh brother branham i'll find a place for you to sleep and he's down in a ravine and he's trying to get a slick place and they're trying to build a fire to get warm and brother branham says i stood there and that and that dark icy air hit me in the face and he said i thought just i used to preach to thousands tens of thousands came to my meetings people flew from all over the world for five minutes of my time he said i've seen the dead raised and i've seen the lame walk in the blind sea and i've seen sinners million souls one to christ and he said think now i'm just a bum nobody wants me and god had told him carry out your plans you'll be like that bum and i said lord i don't want to be like that said your wife will go too she won't live up there in them hills like that now for those of you who never knew sister mita branham you're never going to find this is i can't even get my mind wrapped around this knowing sister mita and my you asked my sister gene this is this like what says to me to leave brother bill yeah the lord was prophesying said she won't stay with you up there see said she'll go too she won't live up there in them hills like that and you'll become a bomb just as the dream showed you you would i said i don't want to be that but i don't want to have to live like that i i want to do something different i you called me to be a prophet and i want to live in the wilderness like a prophet hear these excuses brother branham says but i was using my own excuse so i could hunt my own good see and he said but and the lord said but that was the prophets of the old testament you've been called to be there in a much higher office than that he said you have more gifts besides that he was called to pray for the sick and preach the gospel in the apostolic form and and have greater things and many great gifts he said why why do you wait for me to move you every time you move why do you wait here's god taking his prophet to task why do you wait for me to move you every time you move where is your reward he says then i seen it then said he said now do you remember you remember that brother roberson told you in the dream in his dream or vision that you had done like moses you forgot the feeling of the people you forgot the call that i called you to i let the sick lay i wanted the lord to give me where to go and what and and not what to do and what not to do that's wrong i built myself a complex because the people didn't hear my message god forbid that i'll try to compare my life to like moses but it's exactly what moses did and and so brother branham he he goes on you know telling this story and and i don't just want to linger there but my you he's just giving god every kind of excuse but you said they said you know you told me on the river i mean you told me in a cave you told me on the river i i'm i'm supposed to be a prophet well then i i want to go and live like a prophet you know and i i want you i'm i'm wounded i'm hurt and i don't want to be around people anymore and i just want you to accept it and god wouldn't have anything to do with it and said carry out your plans and you'll be like that bum you saw in the dream see carry out your plans god reply and god god's replies why do you always wait for me to move you why do i always got to drive you to it i've called you to this office i've called you to be a christian i've uh come on bethel's tabernacle he's called you to be a son or daughter of god he's he's called you to be full of the holy ghost he's called you he's called you to raise your children in the admonition of god he's called you to be in the house of god he's called you to love him and serve him and be a light in the in the community what what is our excuses for our carnality and just holding back and holding back and holding back and minimalizing it minimalizing it i don't want to pay the price be honest you don't want to pay the price i think of elijah in the cave in elijah's defense and answers of why he was hiding in the cave you know the story we're not going to take time to read it very discouraged by the people everybody had forsaken him and now he's i mean if he's in the cave he's off the field if he's off the field he's not at war he's he's left the field of battle a mighty prophet like elijah see he's running from a woman he's hiding in a cave he's all down and depressed hiding in the dark and god comes to him what are you doing here elijah now you go back in the text god never sent him there god knew he was going to go fed him fed him and fed him a lot because he knew the journey he was going to go but there's no command for god and god comes there to finally brother branham says he says as a runaway prophet just like moses a runaway prophet and he said when moses said when god finally found him was back on the backside of arabia you know married to an ethiopian woman raising sheep when god found elijah when god found his prophet he was he was you know huddled up in the back of a cave sitting in the dark crying pleading to die amen with work left to do with souls that needed saved with the jehovah to be glorified amen elijah what are you doing here well nobody likes me and the queen's trying to kill me and everybody has forsaken your word in fact as i'm the only christian left nobody else is even believers except me and they all hate me and and and i've been rejected by everybody and the government's against me and and and i've i've run and i've worked and i'm tired and i want to go home and i just want to die now what do you say to that lord you know what the lord did okay elijah anyway what are you doing here just repeated the question like as if he just [Music] okay you done you done little baby why are you here and elijah because he's too much like us as the bible said he's a man of like passions just like us just like you and me brother branham said it man he he he had his ups and downs and as if as elijah's so thick he's still not getting it he just repeats the same thing when god asks the question again he gives him the same answer and finally god says elisha elijah you're not going to die first of all i got more work for you to do there's another prophet got to be anointed in your office there's has held got to be found you you got three tasks you got to go do elijah now get up out of this cave stop crying get back in the field of battle and god comes in a and a fire and a wind but elijah you know he he's learned a lesson that that that when you're going to serve god you don't just go on some emotionalism this has got to be something real it's got to hit at a deeper level and he ignored the fire and ignored the wind he knew god wasn't in that but then a still small voice came and he covers his face and comes out to hear the comes out to hear the commission i want to tell you something friends i hope you're i know i'm up here yelling but i hope you're hearing a still small voice down inside you today to say this ain't the time for carnality this ain't the kind stop giving me excuses you need to pray more you need to read your bible more you need to testify more you need to raise your family different you need a different job you need a different priorities in your life where where are you at rearrange things stop giving me excuses brother branham tells the story of arthur mccoy the evangelist and you know the story i'm not going to take the time to read it we got a prayer list to get to but arthur mccoy the evangelist he he comes and he has a dream that he crosses over and comes into the receiving area at heaven and there's an angel sir how can we help you i'm i'm arthur mccoy evangelist and uh i'm here i i've preached the gospel for years and the man searches he says i'm sorry sir um i don't seem to see your name mccoy you say yes arthur mccoy evangelist well sir there's there's there's you're not here it's not here in the records of life and arthur mccoy says there's got to be some mistake i've preached for years i my goodness are you kidding me what can be done well is there any chance do i have any chance at all and the angel said well you might appeal your case to the great white throne judgment and arthur mccoy says well if that's if that's all there is i guess i'll do that all right sir proceed and he goes in and he says he stands there and he comes into this place and it's just it's just the the awesomeness of it and this great shining light and this great presence sitting on the throne high and he says who are you who has entered my court of judgment and he says sir i'm arthur mccoy evangelist and he says did you not go to the first area yes did they not find your name in my book no so you've come to my judgment for you've come to my judgment bar to be judged yes sir you will receive justice arthur mccoy did you ever tell a lie and arthur mccoy gives a testimony he said you know he said up until that time i thought i had been a pretty good fella you know i'd i'd preach the gospel he said but i you know i knew there were some little white lies that i told and little little deceptive little practices and i hadn't always just been exactly a completely honest and he said yes sir i've lied hmm arthur mccoy did you ever steal and he said i thought to myself i i don't no i i've never stolen act you know not exactly but i i do remember you know i'm thinking he's thinking but i do kind of remember some of those business deals i pulled and pulled a few little strings and kind of you know wasn't exactly right and he said let me tell you in that presence you don't even want to offer an excuse arthur mccoy doesn't even he doesn't even offer that verbally to the lord he's just thinking it in his own mind and he says yes lord the bottom line is i have stolen i have lied and he said the king his voice grew stern and he said i find you guilty you have been found guilty in my court and i sentence you and he says he was just about ready to hear him say depart from me you worker of iniquity into everlasting flames and he said right as he's getting ready to say it he said the sweetest voice i ever heard said father and he said i turned around and he said it was the sweetest voice i'd ever heard and the sweetest face i'd ever heard and he said he stepped up beside me and put his arm around me and says father it's true that he did lying he did steal and he hasn't exactly done everything right but lord in the earth he was stood for me and now i'm gonna stand for him i'm so glad god i'm so glad christ stands for you and i friends but there's it's not about getting there and trying to come up with an excuse i want to tell you something don't find yourself on the other side of exposure or the other side of guilt and and and think that you're going to have some excuse as to why you got caught in this or caught in that or you couldn't overcome this you couldn't overcome that no you wouldn't overcome it there has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but within the temptation god will make a way of escape he doesn't say you'll take it he just says you can take it it's up to you i i tell you something friends i'm not here to offer god change excuses he's called on me to be a spiritual man and i'm going to be a spiritual man hallelujah there's no i'm here to tell you friends none of the excuses you give yourself for under achieving will hold water in his presence you hear that friends you hear that young people none of the excuses you give yourselves for underachieving spiritually will hold water in his presence none of the carnal passes that we give ourselves none of the shortcuts we take none of the slackness that we allow in our lives no provision i want to say to you tonight no provision that you have employed to accommodate your spiritual laziness will stand on that day he even had to tell brother branham you must be more sincere don't find yourself on the other side of guilt and being exposed and see if you feel like offering your feeble excuses then if even brother branham carried out his plan and would have been a bum and god wasn't mincing words he wasn't bluffing that was not an idle threat god wasn't being facetious god wasn't trying to scare him god was not mincing words he was very serious so i say to you tonight friends find your way forward find your way forward and for some of us i know in certain elements of my life i first had to go back to the starting gate and do some repenting and come back to the starting block and say lord now i'm going to go forward but i need to come back to this starting spot right here because i can't just go forward i got to fix some things in arrears and i had to come back to my knees and say father god help me today from this hour i'm rededicating my life to spirituality i'm throwing out carnality out of my life out of my home out of my occupation i'm making changes to my career i'm changing my priorities i'm done offering excuses i want to have the living god moving in my life i want to be an achiever i want to have satan under my feet i want to make all of god's enemies how many want to make god's enemies his footstool that's your part of it friends whatever it takes we have to go forward whatever it takes to take the land whatever it takes to take the land sometimes i wonder how is it that we seek deliverance from the very thing you keep feeding on how how does that make sense to us to try to take victory and you're you're even sitting here tonight and maybe the impact of this word and the and the the dynamic approach that the lord has inspired me to take and maybe you're sitting here with all kinds of zeal and burning and you can't wait for church to be over so you can go make you can you can uh my goodness i'm pledging my allegiance i'm i'm going forward again and yet tomorrow finds you tomorrow finds you once more feeding on the very things that are the fuel for the thing that has you trapped and you're hoping for deliverance from the thing while feeding on the fuel that feeds it this thing can't just be excitement this can't just be you know me whipping you up into a frenzy and i'm going to conquer i'm going to conquer i'm going to go forward you won't do nothing but fall flat on your face i'm here to tell you you're going to have to be more sincere this is an age where sincerity is going to have to eclipse every other age that we've ever lived in you're not going to have the kind of victories it's impossible god can't get behind that kind of life we've got to cast down all vain imaginations we've got to cast down all complexes get rid of them get rid of carnality and say lord today i'm not just purposing in my mind but i'm actually going to put footsteps to this thing we live in an age i'm just going to make these comments to you as i get ready to close we live in an age so fast-paced moving towards destruction and total insanity that we're constantly encountering one seat of discrepancy after another you can hardly overcome five and there's nine more behind it get get trip tip toe over those nine and there's 15 waiting for you tomorrow that's the age we're living in it's rapid it's fast paced it's headed for destruction it's headed over the cliff seeds of discrepancy are everywhere and my fear is that too many parents and even too many pastors and too many preachers are getting outpaced and out flanked by the enemy don't get out flanked by the enemy don't get outpaced by the enemy i'm here to tell you god has given us too much provision to allow that to happen he's done too much for us he's conquered every foe and he offers you that kind of victory if you'll accept it if you'll take it brother branham says in possessing the gate of the enemy after trial when a preacher stand and lets you women bob your hair and wear paint and stuff and don't correct you there's no genuine love there and won't call it out and let every men marry three to four times and all these other things and get by with it there's no genuine love there let you join a church and pat you on the back and smother you with some creed saying that's all you have to do has joined the holy church there's no love there or either the man has so totally lost himself he don't see it genuine love is corrective and brings you back to the word of god here tonight friends i'm preaching on love it's corrective it brings us back to the word it brings me back it brings you back and i'm i'm so thrilled to tell you tonight and i hope you will join me i've never been more happy to be on my way back i i want to be back i want to come back to fellowship i want to come back to the realities of the living god oh my you say oh i i need deliverance to come to me brother jason i'm i'm waiting on the holy ghost why why are you waiting on something already promised to you go get it go get it don't wait for victory go get it don't don't wait to inherit the land go take it hallelujah don't think satan friends doesn't sense and feel the same winds of revival we feel don't you think for a minute that he don't feel the same thing don't think that he doesn't see the the rising of the sun lighting up the horizon don't think he doesn't know that we're getting close to home don't think he's unaware i'm here to tell you satan knows it can't just keep going on and on and on and on the bible says he knows his days are numbered and he knows by prophecy he has reached his end he's like a roaring lion he's like a wounded animal he's trying everywhere to devour everything oh i'm here to tell you friends it's it's all it's all hands on deck it's it's it's a it's let's pick up our weapons and go forward let's fight the fight of faith eagerly oh my i'm here to tell you as much as you're pressing for it and i i believe tonight that you're pressing for it don't be naive as as equally and and most times satan's advantage over us as he has more zeal amen oh yeah satan is the best church attendant i have satan has more zeal than any of us and don't you imagine for one second that that for every bit of purpose that you feel in your heart to go forward he feels that or more to stop you to derail you to throw you off track oh i'm here to tell you something friends you're going to have to put your foot on his neck and keep it there he's got to become under the feet of this bride once and for all how many tonight say lord once since for all oh god once and for all in this in these closing scenes of history once and for all i want him under my feet i want i want him in my i want him i want him i want my authority over his authority i want the presence of god in my life and in my home and in my family and everywhere i go in the church i attend and the actions that i take i want god to be glorified at all times let's stand friend stand with me that's what we've got to desire more than even even our even in the next drink of water you take you need to you need to have a desire to drink from the fountain that never runs dry if he can't block you then he'll at least severely hinder you if he can and cause you to miss every benefit he can brother branham says you believe every word then you are sealed after the test when we believe every promise in the word we are sealed by the spirit to confirm the promise that's what it's what abraham the way he did it then and then only have we the right to possess the gate of our enemy you have a right to possess it and the only way it's like a it's like an all or none you don't even have a right to possess it without the spirit of god being first in your life and then when the spirit of god is first in your life you have full rights to possess the gate of the enemy after trial after trial bow your heads with me friends with every head bowed now i'm going to read you some lines that the lord put in my notes and i really forgot they were here and i just scrolled down to it and there it is the lord's message to you i remember writing that now the lord's message to you the lord's message to me every head bowed every eye closed here's the lord's message to you friends stop pleading with me as if i haven't already given you every provision already every provision to accomplish everything i've called for in this age it's high time we man up lady up and take god at his word quit crying over your circumstances because god has allowed you to lay aside every weight and sin which doth so easily beset you stop fearing things he's already conquered and whatever you do friends stop hiding behind excuses to keep from the work of possessing the gates of the enemy say but i'm in a deep trial perfect because you possess them after trial victories over trials are one not bestowed they are one brother branham says now we are more than conquerors we're just walk right into it as an inheritance more than conquerors now we are dealing with a defeated enemy sickness is defeated death is defeated hell is defeated everything is defeated oh my wish i was twice my size now maybe i feel twice as good we are disputing we're disputing with a conquered enemy i want to tell you something friends it doesn't it it doesn't matter whether your sickness is in your body or in your mind or in your soul or in your spirit put your foot on the neck of that enemy it doesn't matter where it's at if it's a physical sickness if it's a spiritual sickness if it's a mental strain if it's a financial if it's in your soul i don't care where it's at you're dealing with a defeated enemy god has already given you and provisioned you with every way to defeat him and i just say lord god help me help me lord oh i want to raise up both my hands tonight say help me father help me o god help me lord whether it's body mind body or soul doesn't matter i'm tired of giving you excuses i'm tired of giving myself a pass tired of diminishing it and lord making it somehow small so i don't have to feel so bad this age calls for great sincerity the people who know their god will do great exploits this is the hour we've come to lord i pray for the people i pray for myself lord this word has gone forth tonight and and if it's affected everyone as it affected me there were times lord when i felt such shame times when i felt such joy times when i feel such warning and times when i i feel such challenge and times when i feel such victory and lord it's been a it's been a up and down it's been a hodgepodge as it were it's been a it's been all over the place but i believe it's found the mark i
