TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Jesus, the greatness of his mercy and love. At the feet of Jesus we cry holy, holy, holy. We cry holy, holy, holy. We cry holy, holy, holy is the lamb. Let's sing it again. Oh hallelujah. Oh we fall down. We raise our crowns at the feet of Jesus. [Music] The greatness of his mercy and love. At the feet of Jesus we cry holy, holy, holy. We cry holy, holy, holy. We cry holy, holy, holy is our lamb. We cry holy, holy, holy. We cry holy, holy, holy. We cry holy, holy, holy is the lamb. Lord, you are more precious [Music] than silver. [Music] And Lord, [Music] you are more costly than gold. Oh Lord, you are more beautiful than diamonds. [Music] And nothing I desire compares with you. Let's sing it again to him now. Raise your hands. Oh Lord, you are more precious than silver. [Music] And Lord, you are more costly than even gold. Oh Lord, you are [Music] more beautiful than diamonds and nothing I desire. &gt;&gt; Oh, it sounds so beautiful. Can we sing it one more time as brother Luther comes? Oh, and Lord, you are [Music] more precious than silver. [Music] Lord, you are more costly than even gold. My Lord, you are more beautiful [Music] than I mind. [Music] And nothing I desire compares with you. &gt;&gt; You say amen to that. &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise God. How grateful we are. We have a living father that loves us and keeps us. Uh brother Joe couldn't make it today. He wasn't feeling well. I want to remember him. Sister Angie Heath is uh it's a family friend in Montana. It's actually the in-laws on the other side of my oldest daughter's marriage. And so she's she's dealing with a second bout of cancer going through chemo and um she really doesn't have a support group up there or church that she goes to. She counts this as her church. I just I just ask that you would just remember her in prayer as we pray and just continue. She um she had breast cancer. She had been removed and then um you know they said it came back in her lungs and stuff. So we just want to remember her. She's probably I'm thinking 50 years old. So we want to remember her. if you have a request upon your heart this morning um that you want the Lord to just speak to you specifically about what you've got on your heart. Amen. Let's pray. Father, I love you this morning. Lord, if I didn't have you as a as my father, if I didn't have you as my confidant, my friend, my brother, Lord, I would be groping in darkness. I'll be so lost. But I'm so thankful, Father, that you reach down your hand, Lord, where you said, "No man can come to you unless the Father draws us." I'm thank you for that drawing, Lord, this morning. I pray for Joe, father, not feeling well the last few days. And Father, we are praying for a complete victory, complete healing for our brother. Lord, doesn't matter what the symptoms say or what's going on. We know that you are more than able. And we're claiming that promise in the name of Jesus Christ for our brother. As we remember Sister Angie today, Lord, Father, sometimes life, you get down low and you just need a God with skin on it. As our brother spoke, I pray for her this morning. Father, I'm asking that you would touch her and help her. Father, it doesn't matter what stage even cancer cannot stand before you in our prayer of faith this morning. I love you, Father. I pray that you'll bless your people this morning. Lord, we are asking it's a Father earnest of our salvation. The children's bread is healing of the body, Father. And Lord, you are the one that keeps your word and we believe it, Father. We love and worship you this morning. We pray that you just have your way, Father, throughout this whole day, especially in the greatest form of worship. when the word comes forth, may we just step aside and allow you to have your way. Father, touch our hearts, strengthen us that we may leave this place better, Father, than when we came in. As we collect the tithes and offerings, Lord, I pray that you would bless the cheerful giver. We thank you for the blessings you give us and the bounty you provide. Father, we are grateful in every way. In Jesus Christ's name we pray this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you greet one another in the name of the Lord this morning?

Oh, &gt;&gt; one more time. Let's raise up those hands and sing it. &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord, right now. Right now, &gt;&gt; oh, this dark age, Lord. We need you. &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We need you. &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord. We need bright. &gt;&gt; Oh, hear our prayer today. We lift our hands and bow our knees and worship at your throne. [Music] We need you, Lord. We need you, Lord, right now. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. God bless you, friends. Greet in the name of the Lord. Happy to have you in the house of God today. Amen. Turn around and greet somebody with a good hearty handshake. Say, "God bless you, pilgrim." Amen. That's what we are on a pilgrim journey. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, we're going to invite you right away to Isaiah chapter 14. Happy to have you in the house of God today. Rainy day. Amen. Maybe the Lord will rain down with his presence. Amen. Praise God. We not maybe he promised he would. Amen. We gather in his name, proclaim his word, and if you believe it, then that's and he will uh he'll absolutely do that. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to um after service, you've been seeing the announcements we're having try to figure out what the weather's going to do. So, I told Brother Brad, he's uh going to have to be the meteorologist today and make the call. And so we're trying to figure out what all we can do uh this afternoon and if we can get everybody helping. Um we had the question of do we let them go to lunch, come back, but I don't think we'll need to do that. I think it'll go very quickly if everybody will pitch in. We'll have to be careful because if it's even a light drizzle, that ramp, that loading ramp will be slick. So uh just be careful. Amen. They'll try to organize it. I think they're going to try to uh maybe have some food um at least on the side. Won't be your ideal lunch food, but it'll be good enough. Praise the Lord. You love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Um so that that'll just be we'll figure that out as we get right to the end. And then if we have some left over, if we can't load up the m the the instruments today and a lot of the AV equipment because you can't really do that in the rain, uh then tomorrow that's a holiday and maybe some people could uh be willing to come back. But hopefully we can get it today. We might get a little bit of a break. I've been praying. Amen. You have not because you asking a lot. So I put it in order. I said, "Lord, we we we could really use some no rain." Amen. And I've I've had that happen, friends, back in the day, so many times where I had a job and I had to finish it and there was no option. I had hungry children to feed and it was raining and if I don't finish it today, I don't get paid. And then then it's the weekend and I would just say, "Lord, I don't care if it rains o over this entire city. I don't care if it rains in this neighborhood. Just don't let it rain on this house." And you cannot imagine how many times, brother Mark, how many times I literally would be painting. This is a true story. I have been painting before and it raining in the street in front of the place and the side street that went this way, raining on that one, and not raining on what I'm painting. Raining behind it, raining around it, raining everywhere. And uh I I've had eyewitnesses of that who were astonished at that. And I said, "Well, I've just learned how to pray." Amen. Praise God. Amen. So, we're just looking for that. If it if it is, we'll figure it out. But it's up to the Lord. I just figure that uh hey, you're nothing if you don't try. So, pray ask. Brother Brandham said, "Ask big." &gt;&gt; Yeah. I just heard him just yesterday. You can't people he said people are worried about, you know, bothering him. He said, "You can't bother him. Oh, I don't want to ask too much." You can't ask too much. You'll never ask as much as he wants to do. So just go ahead and and and swing for the fences as they say. Amen. Praise the Lord. I remember back in the day, brother brother Dale told me that the way the first time he ever met Sister Joanne, the first time he ever laid eyes on her, she was on a high school softball team and he said she stepped up to the plate and cracked one and they never caught it. It would cleared the fence and brother Dale said, "That's my kind of woman." Amen. So, uh, Amen. So, I I just think that we've seen God do too much to doubt him. Amen. And I've seen him do too much, uh, to question him whether, however he decides to answer it. I'm not going to doubt him. And however he answers it, I'm not going to question him. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Isaiah chapter 14. Amen. We um, happy to have uh, everybody here today. I think uh, Sister Vicki was here somewhere. Here she is. Sister Vicki, God bless you. Happy to have you here today. Amen. Praise the Lord. And any other visitors, amen, that are here with us. God bless you. Amen. Isaiah, Isaiah 14. We're continuing on today uh with Satan's competing claim from uh last last time. Isaiah 14:13 and 14. We have two verses. We'll let you be seated. This is Satan. Speaking of Satan, this is when the prophet outed him. A That's right. Amen. Nathaniel, good to have you here today, too. Amen. For the Lord has said in thine heart, I'm so glad I got people who won't let me forget stuff. Amen. For the Lord has said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. I will be like the most high. Quite a bold statement. My I will be like the most high. My goodness. Amen. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your word today and we ask for your blessing upon it now. Lord, you see the burden of the word that's upon my heart. And and today, Lord, we just want to be able to take our time and and go very methodically. I don't want to miss anything. I think these points are so relevant to the hour we live and so vitally important that we wouldn't want to miss what is your people need to receive today. So, help me not to feel hurried, Lord. uh we don't want to wear the people out as you know as I am as I preach. I don't not a long preacher but I want to be concise. So I ask for your mercy today in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you friends. You can be seated. Now if you will turn with me in your Bibles. We're going to go to Ephesians chapter 5. And uh if you'll give me that uh brother Kevin, Ephesians chapter 5. We're going to u read these. I let you be seated for that because it's a lengthy reading. And I um you know I I want to just remind you that in our text where we read from Isaiah as you're turning to to Ephesians 5 that Satan is making these are counter claims to the ones that Jesus made in the book of Revelation that you know that he will be their God and he will dwell with them in the earth and they will be his his family and his children. And so Jesus has a claim that he's figuring how it's going to end up. But Satan has a polar opposite claim that he actually intends to be above the stars of God, which are the sons of God, the family of God. So you can imagine that in the book of Revelation how that it declared a position that you you can't get higher then you you there's no way to be higher than for God to be your father and you to be his son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that in the new heavens and the new earth, God himself will dwell with you. &gt;&gt; There's no accomplishment. Uh brother George, good to see you, too. I see you here still with us today and some visitors in the back. God bless you. Amen. Sister Sister Brother John's family. Amen. Praise the Lord. Happy to have them today. Um and so I'm sure I'm missing somebody. So, Amen. But that should hopefully cover everybody. Um so these are these are Satan is now counterclaiming, no, I'm actually going to be higher than the sons of God. Well, how do you how's that going to work, Lucifer? because I'm I'm going to be a son of God dwelling with God. &gt;&gt; So, but Lucifer is not saying Lucifer is not saying that, you know, I'm going to create another position above that. What he's simply saying is is that the claim that the Lord has made about himself and you is not happening. &gt;&gt; Full stop. That's his claim. I'm going to be above the sons of God. I'm actually going to be the one sitting at the head of the congregation and the sides of the north. I'm actually going to ascend above the heights of the cloud of witnesses. I will be like the most high. So, this is Satan desiring worship. Now, here is a here's a turn. And if you you're really going to want to get my turn because I'm going to just you know when when you're when you're teaching which is trying what I'm going to try to do today. Uh you you you tell them what you're going to tell them. You tell them and then you tell them what you've told them. That's that I'm serious. That's that's a that's a that's a motif. That's a that's a saying. That's a that they they train you for that. When you're when you're teaching a lesson, tell them what you're going to tell them. Tell them then tell them what you've told them and that way when you leave here you've got it. So I'm about to really tell you where I'm headed because Satan is not making this claim merely hoping at the finish line. He's somehow miraculously going to pull it off. &gt;&gt; He's actually staging to accomplish it now in your life because your life is a worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So this is a here and now. I'm not preaching about somewhere over a rainbow. I'm here to tell you Satan believes he can get there then because of what he can do here now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's how the Holy Spirit is working as well. Jesus has made a tremendous claim and he's not waiting to get there then to do it. He's working to get there then here and now. So this is the battle. This is the epic tugofwar that is going on. And Christ is attempting to gain worship from your life. And Lucifer is attempting to gain worship from your life. &gt;&gt; Choose you this day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Bradis preached the power of decision. So such a wonderful uh wonderful quote. And uh brother Caleb actually posted a quote so tremendous and I I wanted to get to it today. I don't think I'll have the time, but I'll put it in the next next installment. All right. So now So now we come to Ephesians 5. And here is a here is an overcomer 101. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is training 101 how to be an overcomer &gt;&gt; because we're in a battle &gt;&gt; and God is getting worship and Lucifer is getting worship and they're both getting plenty &gt;&gt; and the worship could not be different could not be more different. Yeah. I'm here to tell you something friends when you're a Christian you're when you're really Christian and your your life is a worship you're nothing like the world. at all. &gt;&gt; Every facet, every aspect of your daily walking around talking, breathing life is to the beat of a different drum, &gt;&gt; to a to a symphony that it's playing a different melody, a different harmony, a different rhythm. And and and Brother Brandham talks about that so much that that, you know, you've got to start with the composer. He composed music that he once played. Your listen, your life is a life song. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; That song's not just a song. That's a That's a true teaching. See? All right. So, let's look at Ephesians 5:1-17. Be therefore followers of God as dear children, and walk in love as Christ also hath loved us. Now, how did he love us? How is it that you're supposed to walk like he did? He did always that which pleased the father. He said, "It's written of in of me in the scrolls concerning me. uh in sacrifices and offerings thou hast no pleasure, but a body thou hast prepared me. It's written about me. It's written concerning me in the scrolls. I here's my declaration. I have come to do thy will, oh God. &gt;&gt; So, first of all, if we're going to walk in the same love toward God that Jesus did, then you need to admit today, I don't own my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was purchased. That's right. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, let's carry on. Walk in love as Christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savor. So, his life was a sweet smelling savor. It was an offering. See, it's a worship. Verse three. Now, watch. You can get right to the nitty-gritty, right to the where the rubber meets the road. But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not be once named among you as becometh saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor justesting, which are not convenient, but rather giving of thanks. There is there is one of the leading money making forms of entertainment is vulgaresting. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. They they have late shows that millions of people watch. They YouTube and Facebook are full of reals where people are making vulgar comedy. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; it's not it's not about, you know, Jesus, you know, said that old fox. It's not Jesus had a sense of humor. It's not don't ever tell something funny or something like a joke or you play something on somebody. I was just I was in the car yesterday with Travis and and my and Nathaniel calls brother Travis and I saw it was Nathaniel and I answered I said, "Hey bud, how's it going?" He said, and I could hear the confusion in his voice. Said, "Yeah, it's brother Jason. What what's up? Why'd you call me?" Uh, and then I I let him off easy. He was, "Man, this is so weird. I thought I was" And so he was he he he had the right person, but I was playing a gag on him. But one of the leading things that we have today, one of the most quickest ways to make money is be vulgar and funny. &gt;&gt; See? Right. So for this you know are neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor justesting which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks. For this you know in other words your life should be a thanksgiving to God. for this. You know that no whoreonger nor unclean person I I wish that at some of these Hollywood funerals they would read this verse &gt;&gt; because it doesn't seem to matter how vulgar, how low class, how low down, how filthy, how nasty that the entertainer who has now died suddenly they died on a drug overdose or they died and passed out and drowned or or they died in a gang fight or whatever and somehow Now everybody says, "Oh, they're up there looking down." That's not true. &gt;&gt; They're if if they're looking at all, they're down there looking up screaming. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; for this for this you know that no hormonger nor unclean person, nor covetous man who is an idoltor hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no man deceive you. Don't let this this deceitful age deceive you. Let no man deceive you with vain words. For because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. They wonder why God is going to let the tribulation come. And they actually try to turn blame back on God. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; be ye not therefore partakers with them? Amen. &gt;&gt; Choice is yours. But if you're going to be a Christian, don't be a partaker with the ungodliness of this world. For ye were sometimes darkness. This is before you were born again. But now are you light in the Lord. Here's a good piece of advice. Walk as children of the light. Are you born again of the spirit of God? Then walk like that. See, for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth, proving, see, the life we live, proving what is acceptable unto the Lord, and have no fellowship with the un the unfruitful works of darkness, with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather let your life testify against it. &gt;&gt; Not you get out on the street holding up signs, you know, telling people, you know, you're you're repent or go to hell, you know, um and and I'm not against fire and brimstone preaching, and that's uh shocked to plenty of people, but what good would it do me to get on the street corner and yell that out if when I walk away, my life doesn't agree with my sermon? See, so for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret, but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light. For whatsoever doth make manifest is light. Wherefore he saith, awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Wherefore be you not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. You know, there's a there's a great movement today for what is termed by the movers and shakers of society, the the we're you know, we're talking about the super rich, the billionaires. Uh, and you know, I I I I have a podcast that I listen to that's all MIT grads and sometime some of them are double and triple majors in science and math and and business and different things like that. And I do it just to just to stay on the cutting edge of technology uh and and what's moving. And I constantly hear them talking about we're headed toward super abundance. And they've titled that. They've labeled it like that where we're literally coming to where we can we can solve the problem of everything. We can solve every problem. We can answer every question. We're going to get to the point where there will be no need for a monetary system. There will be nobody in want, nobody in need. everything will everybody will have it'll be super abundance and and you know and and and I and I realize that that there have been I I I realize like brother Brandham said they're trying to build a false millennium &gt;&gt; because the element that they're leaving out is the fallen nature of a fallen man and power apart from character is satanic. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not like there hasn't been super abundance down through history, societal abundance. I mean, you know, the the the Moguls taking over India, uh the Romans taking over Europe and uh but you always ended up in B and this is their own testimony, but you basically ended up uh you know in four activities that human beings do whenever you get to complete control and super abundance, which is food, art, music and sex. not necessarily in that same order, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And it doesn't matter what empire ever rose up and had super abundance, it all they they couldn't answer the sin question and the whole thing imploded because of filth and vulgarity. I want to make a statement to you today, and you're going to have to give me some time to explain it because it's going to sound bizarre. Satan is not my greatest enemy. &gt;&gt; I am &gt;&gt; my greatest enemy. &gt;&gt; Satan is a fallen angel. &gt;&gt; He is no threat to me. That's right. &gt;&gt; You see, brother Brandham said, "A demon spirit is almost powerless unless he can get someone to work through." &gt;&gt; You see, so he's already been stripped of his power. And the Bible says, and we didn't read it, we could go on down in our in our text from Isaiah, the world will narrowly look upon him &gt;&gt; and they'll be shocked that they ended up and the whole world imploded upon itself and destroyed itself all because of this one person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, and he's a person. &gt;&gt; They'll even say, "Is this the man?" Now, he's not a man. He's a fallen angel. But but when they realize that he's actually a person, brother Brandham said, "People say the devil's not real." He said, "Don't you believe that he's very much real. He's very much active. And he has a vision and he has a counter claim for how he sees it ending up. I don't want to end up in his in his world because every time I've ever seen men who were under his control rise up with control, it went bad for the people." &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. So, he's a fallen angel. He's already been stripped of power. The world will narrowly look upon him. So, he's not a threat. I am. You are the threat. I am the son of God. I'm the one made in his image to be an amateur god. I'm the one in the image of God with a living soul and free moral agency. I'm the one that I should fear and be careful to keep very close to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, I'm afraid of this person. I'm afraid of the devil." You need to take a look at that man in the mirror. That's the person that can hurt you. That's the one I I I'm not going to be able to control the devil, but I can control his access to me. &gt;&gt; I'm the son of God. I'm the one supposed to be an amateur god. I'm the one that I and not all of me is converted. &gt;&gt; Only a third of me. &gt;&gt; The other two parts of me, body and spirit, are not converted. I still have to keep my memory, affection, reason, conscience, imagination. That's a bad one. &gt;&gt; I have to watch what I look at, listen to, touch, taste, go, have, hold. See, that that's that's where Satan is trying to get access to. That's the one. It's those it's those other two parts of me that I need to be fearful enough to be very careful to keep him close to the Lord. because not all of me is converted yet. Only my soul is in heavenly places with Christ Jesus. Now, now that's quite a that's quite a lot and it's certainly the main part. Amen. But it's not all. So this is this is where you know brother Brandham would teach us that when you take a stand on the word of God that's when you go that's when you do when you as brother Brandham um coined it I you know you grow faith muscles you remember he tells the story of the man and the devil big devil come and the devil said boo and the man jumped back and he got little and the devil got bigger and the devil just walked him across the floor he got littleer smaller and smaller and smaller every time the devil jumped until finally when he had nowhere else to turn, he just said, "Boo back." And when he did, the devil got small. He grew. And then he did it again. And he did it again. And he did it again till finally he booed the devil out of existence. That's what I want to do, friends. I I want to have this man under the subjection of the Holy Spirit so that I'm not afraid of the devil. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham talks about in certain places that it's when the son or son and daughter of God, that born again person that's part of God's godhead, that's the one that walks down the street and demons that see him coming or her coming howl and faint. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so when I take a stand, I grow faith muscles. I become large and Satan becomes small. So, but in other words, let me say it like this. Christ the word, Christ is his word. Christ the word is what becomes large and brings what? What's getting smaller? What's what's being put under control? My fallen parts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My fallen nature. And that's being put under. Please pay attention to me. Don't be sleeping. I've spent many hours studying this. Don't be distracted. Please pay attention. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. It's when it's when it's when his word becomes large because I allow it to become large. And when that happens, then that brings my fallen nature in subjection to the word of God. Trust me, your young people need to hear what I'm preaching today. My soul, my soul lives in perfect faith to God's word every minute of every hour of every day. That's that's a done deal. That's that's not in question. That's not what we're talking about. That's in fact that's what the new birth seals into me. Says you're sealed until the day of your redemption. That's what's sealed into me. a perfect faith in the revealed word and a true worship to the true God. &gt;&gt; John Jesus said in John 4, "But the hour cometh, and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth. For the father seeketh such to worship him." God is a spirit. Catch it. And they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so we're studying, you know, we're studying today about this fallen being, this one called Lucifer, who started out as an archangel who started at the right hand of the throne. I don't have time to go in that today. That's for another installment. Oh, and and and and but but we're but we're studying today about a being a being who's very real and who is vying &gt;&gt; for your worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's fighting God over your worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's trying to file a competing claim against the claim of the Holy Ghost that lives in you. The Holy Ghost that lives in me says I believe God. Satan is filing a competing claim. Said, "Oh, if I can just get you to do this and I can get you to do that, then I will invalidate your claim." &gt;&gt; And the world because you claim you're a Christian. You claim you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But if I can affect the other two guys that make you up, then I can get the world to doubt what the promise of the word is cuz they see that you're not what it said you would be. &gt;&gt; Is this all right? &gt;&gt; So the unconverted parts of me are the ones that are vulnerable to him. What kind of worship is my life? Brother Ben Brandham said it like this in his homespun way. You're somebody's fool. &gt;&gt; You're either a fool for Christ or you're a fool for the devil. &gt;&gt; But that was that was his last closing sermon. His last full text sermon was leadership in Kabina. He preached communion there uh in Tucson. But but that was just a short communion service. But his last text sermon was leadership. Who's leading you now? Cuz somebody always has been and somebody is right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's the it's the greatest battle ever fought. And I'm I'm just I I'm here to tell you something, friends. We're all in this thing together. And I know you'll rejoice with me. I I realize this my my body and my spirit are not converted. I'm just glad I got a competing voice down on the inside of the inside &gt;&gt; that desires every day when my feet when my unconverted feet hit the floor, there's a man inside on the deep inside saying, "Walk in the grace of God today." Every time my eyes or my ears or Satan tries to pull this or that way, there's a voice down on the inside and says, "Uh, live in subjection to the Holy Spirit. Bring every thought captive to the Holy Ghost." Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's up to me whether I'll do it or not. &gt;&gt; It's the greatest battle ever fought. The part of me that exercises faith to stand on the word when everything is in peril or threat or temptation. I want you to know today, I want to leave you encouraged, not discouraged. I want you to know that Satan can't force you to do these things. You have the Holy Ghost and you have the power and you have the ability. No matter when everything is in peril or everything might seem like a threat or there might be temptations all around you, you can be an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Real power, friends, hear me now. Real power is not conquering Satan. Jesus already did that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Real power is conquering myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; To stop allowing Satan refuge from God's delivering power because I worship it and won't let it go. when the maniac jumped on the platform there to to to knock brother Brandham out into the audience and brother Brandham said he was well able to do it &gt;&gt; and when the security detail and the police rushed to get him brother Brandham waved him off because he he just knew and this man you know this man is just coming and brother Brandham said he said I'll break every bone in your body and he and he said you know I I turned and I and I said because you have challenged the servant of the most high God, you'll fall at my feet." And brother Brandham said, he said, "I'll show you." He said, "He spit in my face." That's a thing now. It wasn't It was terrible back then. He said, "He spit in my face." And he said, "Uh, it's terrible anytime, but he said he did that to to break my concentration." But the devil caused him to do that. See, a lot of times you can be sitting right here in the house of God and Satan will do something and break your concentration. I mean it it can be anything for this this is why we have church order. This is why we don't allow a lot of commotion where the Holy Spirit is very timid. Even even even a even a a child crossing from one side to the other can distract somebody and break the concentration of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; So this is why we have deacons and order and nursery for crying babies. That's part of nature. Nothing you can do about that. But we have ways uh to remedy that. We don't have a lot of commotion or talking when we come in here in the pre-ervice. So, so brother Brandham said he spit in my face and he said, "I'll show you whose feet I'll fall at." And brother Brandham said, "Come out of him, Satan." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the man spun around, whirled around. His eyes rolled back. He spun around and collapsed and fell over brother Brandham's feet. And Bill, brother Billy Paul told later said that the policeman walked up and said, "Is he dead?" And brother Brandham said, "No." And he said, "Is he delivered?" And he said, "No, he worships that spirit and he won't let it go." &gt;&gt; This is for real. There's a realm, friends, a world that you don't even realize going on in in realms you can't see. Angels moving, evil spirits moving. Sometimes, Brother Brandham said, "If he ever takes his hand away from me, Satan would slay me in a second." I'm here to tell you, you arrived here today by the grace of God. You're hearing the word by the grace of God. You'll leave here and be given an opportunity to go live it by the grace of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So a lot of times we have to make the decision to allow to stop, let me say it that way, we have to decide to stop allowing Satan refuge from God's deliverance. Because if if you don't want to let it go, a prophet said, then Satan has a divine right to stay right there. And even the Holy Spirit will not command him to leave because you are the free moral agent. You're the image of God. You've made a decision. I love it. I enjoy it. I'm not going to give it up. And I could pour a gallon of oil and every minister here could pray for you. And the Holy Spirit could come down to deliver you and you'd leave here bound &gt;&gt; because you will not make the decision to become free. I'm here to decide today. I want to be completely free of every obstacle, anything that could keep my life from being a testimony of true worship to the world. &gt;&gt; Satan has a God-given right to stay there. And God's word can't be taken back. See, just it's it's the same thing you see in Romans 7 where Paul says, you know, the the law was not bad. The problem wasn't the law. The problem was with me that in my flesh I couldn't keep the law perfectly. &gt;&gt; See, because Paul hadn't been born again. And so he says, so Satan, he he says it like this. Satan took advantage. Don't think Satan you we're talking about claims and counter claims. Don't think he's not very savvy on manipulating the word of God, which was for your good to be for your your doom. &gt;&gt; Amen. The same word that'll give you eternal life is the same word that will judge you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, so Paul said, I I I he took advantage of the word and the the law which was actually sent for my life ended up being for my death. He says, "So, was that which was good made evil?" No, the law's not evil. The problem was me and Satan knew that. And so, he took advantage of it. You can't keep the law. So you're condemned. And that was that and that held up. That held up in God's court. &gt;&gt; That's exactly why paradise every doesn't matter what prophet, priest or king they were, how righteous they were. Joseph, Moses, Abraham, David, Isaiah, Ezekiel, all of them without fail could not go into the presence of God when they died. They didn't go up. They went down &gt;&gt; into the lower parts of the earth. And God had a paradise divided off with a gulf fixed in between. And in this side you had hell and in this side you had a paradise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then you say, "Well, they couldn't go back and forth." Good. That's great. But neither could they escape. That's why on resurrection morning that the graves of them which slept arose and went with the Lord to meet to go into the air because he that ascended first descended into the lower parts of the earth and led captivity captive. I want to be captured by him today. I want to be his captive. I don't want to be Satan's captive anymore. &gt;&gt; So, so you know, Paul's showing that this is this is what Satan has done. He's taken advantage of of God's word and and and and of course, God couldn't change his word. He can't do that. Uh and so so so what does Paul do? Paul is showing the church it was hopeless for me to be able to fix it. There was nothing I could do it uh do about it and and and God can't change his word. And so he came and he satisfied the requirement himself and suffered the penalty of his own word of judgment on my behalf or in mystead. I love how brother Dale says it. He didn't just die for me. He died instead of me. &gt;&gt; God traded the innocent for the guilty. &gt;&gt; What love is this? &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; so this is then the only way. I mean, if you think about it, that's the only way free moral agency even has legitimacy. He could not, as brother Brandham said, to be an overcomer. He said, "He cannot push me through a pipe and hold me up as a great overcomer." Meaning like a mold, like a cast. You know, you can you have a die cast. You pour it full and you close it. You wait for it to dry and you pull it out. And this is an overcomer diecast. And when I pour when I get poured in, I come out. No. Or I get pushed through a forming pipe that forms me into a shape. Mechanics use that, you know, and different things. But he said, "That's not that's not an overcomer. I if I'm going to overcome then I am given the choice to either grant Satan refuge or accept God's deliverance. That is me today. That is you today. You can either uh allow Satan refuge to keep influencing you and he'll keep tripping you and he'll keep stumbling you and that weakness and that besetting sin will keep knocking you out and knocking you out and knocking you out all the way till it's time to go home. I want to be free of it. I want to live in the full liberty of the Holy Ghost. I want my life to be a true worship. &gt;&gt; I'm given that choice to either grant Satan continued space that he's not entitled to within me or accept God's deliverance. born in sin. God knowing that a fallen mortal could not choose him, God offers him grace. &gt;&gt; See, so you're saved by grace through faith. See? And so, so it's grace through faith. So, so the Holy Spirit doesn't just give you the grace of revealing himself to you, but he actually gives you the faith to believe it. So, you're saved by grace through faith, and it all comes from him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the fallen man receives that revelation of Jesus Christ into his heart, then here's the beauty of it. When that happens, you're talking about a supernatural thing. It's supernatural cuz it's not natural. It's not something you could have done. The human mind, the fallen mind is enmity against God. Could never agree with God. You were born on your road to hell and no way to stop it. It's the grace of God that came to you and revealed himself to you and then gave you not only the word to believe, but the faith to believe it. And it's not just believe it intellectually. He's given you the Holy Ghost so you can live it. So you can be it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so when that happens, then God credits that believer with the perfect with the perfect life that Jesus lived. Not just at that moment when you repent, but but but for all moments going forward all the way to the coming of the Lord. If I do sin, I have an advocate constantly with the father that that the blood speaks for me constantly. Hallelujah. I'm so glad for that atonement in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We find that when that happens, then no failure can be charged against the redeemed man. He's already perfected in Christ. He's not becoming perfect. He is perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the mind of God. &gt;&gt; This is exactly what we see in the Old Testament shadow in Abraham. The Bible said Abraham believed God's word and God counted it to him. God accredited his account with righteousness that Abraham had never lived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, Abraham had times where he stumbled. He never doubted. He never staggered at the promise of God. But he staggered in his flesh. David staggered in his flesh. Moses staggered in his flesh. Elijah was a man of like passions. Brother Brandon said that many had his ups and downs. But I'm here to tell you something, friends. That day on Calvary changed it all. Hallelujah. And today, you can rise above this sin cursed world. You do not have to live in the bondage of repetitive sin and failure. You're making a choice to do that. And I'm here to tell you, Satan can't force you to do that. &gt;&gt; You are free in Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Numbers 22, Kev, your Sarah. Numbers 22 is the story of King Bailo of Moab going out to hire a a false prophet. Now, he was a real prophet because you can be a real prophet but not be a true prophet, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. So, Balam is the best example of that. He was a true prophet from birth, but he I mean he was a real one. He was a real actual prophet, but he didn't remain as a true prophet of God because he sold out his gift for gain. See, and he and he adulterated the word of God. He God forced him to bless Israel anyway. But then when he couldn't curse Israel, he went around behind the scenes and whispered into Bailo's ear and said, "Listen, you don't need me to curse them. You, they can curse themselves. God will curse them. All you got to do is get them to transgress." See, well, how do I do about that? Throw a big feast and invite them. And it was called the feast of Bale Pure. And when you get here, let's just have a big party. And oh, they're believers. But they're believers. Oh, it's okay. If we can get them to come to the party, that's just phase one. And then we can get them to sit down, phase two. And then we can tell them a few jokes, phase three. And then we can kind of begin to serve food and a little bit of wine and maybe a little bit more wine. And the next thing you know, we get them a little tipsy. And the next thing you know, our women start uh acting in a lewd way and and the men get all inflamed over watching it. And the next thing you know, you'll even have their princes taking prostitutes back all trying to take them back to to the camp of Israel. &gt;&gt; It is shocking to me what people who are supposed to be Christians and believers actually come to the house of God and hear the word and even wave and praise the Lord and and allow ungodliness to exist in their lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're all in this together. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; 30 years. You've heard me say that we're all in this together. This isn't big I and little you. &gt;&gt; Numbers 22. So, we'll catch it. I'll give you the verse in a second, Kev. So, Balum Balo comes. He sends some princes to to Balum. says, "Go take some money and some gifts and tell him, I need him to come see me. I need to curse these people." Verse seven, "And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand. And they came to Balam and spoke unto him the words of Bao." That was the king. And he said unto them, Ba Balam said this to these men, lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the Lord shall speak unto me, and the princes of Moab abode with Balum. And God came unto Balam. Doesn't even say Balum prayed or Balam went to church or Balam built an altar. Balam sacrificed. It just simply says he allowed these people, these Moabites to sleep in his house to come in. He opened the door, invited them in, and they came in. And verse nine, and God came unto Balam and said, "What men are these with thee?" as if God didn't know. Is it funny when God asked a question, you're like, "Really? &gt;&gt; You're asking me a question? Remember friends, it ain't that God needs to know. It's that you need to know. &gt;&gt; You need to answer the question. &gt;&gt; Balam, God already knew who these men were. God already knew the nefarious plot that they were planning. And he says he wants Balam to come to terms with it. What men are these with thee? You know, they were there to offer him fortune and glory. They actually he rejects them the first time. They he sends even higher princes. You can take that down, Kev. Higher people with even more gifts. And Balam does the same thing again. Invites them in. Come on in. Spend the night. Uh Matthew Henry com in his commentary he says it's easy. It is easy for us to say, "Come see our zeal for the Lord." And to think we are very faithful in his cause when we are seeking our own objects and even doing harm instead of good to others. We have all kinds of things that ventures that we do and say, "Oh, I'm going to go serve the Lord in this." And the whole time it's a trap of the devil to lure you into a less than fruitful lifestyle that doesn't truly represent uh almighty God. See, and that and and and listen, that goes beyond those doors. You come here out of respect. You dress decently morally, men and women. &gt;&gt; You speak decently. You speak morally. You act decently. You act morally because if you don't, the deacons will excuse you. And we've had to do that before. And and but what about when you go beyond those doors? You're still a Christian, aren't you? You're still a believer, &gt;&gt; aren't you? &gt;&gt; Does your testimony change in your place of business or out recreationally or when you're shopping in the market or when you're on a ball team, is your testimony different? That should not be. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. See, and you you testify we're going to do good for God and actually you're harming them. &gt;&gt; You see, here's what I want you to catch. Now, I'm going to give you another quick turn. I'm going to run for the finish line. Satan wanted in on Balam's worship. It's what that's what the whole ploy is about. Satan wanted in on it. He knew there was going to be a worship. The king had already said, "I want you to ble curse them." So now you're going to have to get get an altar. You're gonna have to build it. Seven altars. You're going to have to have seven lambs. You're going to have to offer to Jehovah. And Balam wasn't offering to false gods. He was offering to Jehovah. He was supposed to be a a kind of like a believer. See, we got the world full of today kind of like Christians. &gt;&gt; And they meet in churches and they sing songs and they're very sincere. Those tears aren't crocodile. Many of those tears are real. But Jesus said the day is coming and now is. And I'm here to tell you and it is right now when the worshippers must worship in spirit and in truth. The the church age God is done dealing with the age of the church. This is a time of the bride to become the full word to be married to the son of God to take a flight in the skies. That's never happened in the 2,000 years &gt;&gt; of the church. It could have happened in the first age, but the seed had to go into the ground and they backslid. See, so Satan wanted in on Balum's worship service. Can I say it to you in in in no uncertain terms? Satan wants in on your worship service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This guy, he wants in on that. &gt;&gt; He wants to have a say. He wants to have an influence in how your life is a life song &gt;&gt; of true worship to God. Satan desires this in our lives and and in our daily service and our worship to the true God. First Peter, give me that, brother Kevin. 1 Peter uh chapter 2 verse 5. 1 Peter 2 and five. I want you to read it with me. Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God uh by Jesus Christ. So as in the very true story of Balum, then then we need to think about things that that we bring into our house of lively stones. You're you're as lively stones, you're a spiritual house. See? And so I think that God could ask us, and I maybe I should say all too often, God could ask us very legitimately and sadly all too often concerning the things that we give our time to that have little to no eternal value at all. &gt;&gt; It affects your worship. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know he's had to confront me in this way too many times and I don't like that. &gt;&gt; Just a lot of times it's things, you know, little things that that that they have no no eternal value yet they seem to find their way. They worm their way into our worship, into our lives of service to him. Or or my goodness, even worse, dare we even say, uh, you know what? If we open up our senses, remember that unconverted guy? What if we open up our senses to the darkness of this world? The things that we watch, the things that we hear, the things that we partake of that that are that are spiritually toxic, &gt;&gt; completely counterproductive to a life of spiritual richness in Christ. I wonder if like Balam we hear the voice of the Lord asking &gt;&gt; who who's that in your house? &gt;&gt; Who Who is this in your house? &gt;&gt; I didn't put I didn't put this here. This is where I live. Who Who's in your house? &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 3 and then we'll go to 1 Corinthians 6. But 1 Corinthians 3:16, "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God?" Did you know that? &gt;&gt; Know ye not that you're the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you? Paul's asking a question to these Corinthians. 1 Corinthians 6 19 and 20. What know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and ye are not your own. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For ye are bought with a price. Therefore, everybody say therefore. &gt;&gt; Therefore, &gt;&gt; glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are gods. &gt;&gt; So now the question becomes even closer. It's God asking you, "Who is this in my house? &gt;&gt; You thought it was your house. &gt;&gt; But actually, I bought it. I own it. You were on your way to hell. You were on a death sentence. I saved you. I redeemed you. I live here. &gt;&gt; What do I see in my house that's not supposed to be there?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You still with me? Oh, &gt;&gt; yeah. It might be well saying that to you this morning, friends. Who is this that you have in my house? What could we say? What what could we say given that just as Balum we opened the door? We actually let them in. We actually invited them in. We actually bedded them down, &gt;&gt; tucked them in. &gt;&gt; I I I just feel like just leaving my notes and just preaching. I'm just trying to stay right to my notes today. I I love that song that Sister Esther sang. Uh, let today be the day. I get she's singing about the coming of the Lord, but the coming of the Lord is now. Let today be the day that you leave here free. Let today be the day that you say I'm done. I'm kicking them out of his house. I am a house that's supposed to be a tabernacle. I'm to be a temple of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; How many want to say, "Today is the day. Come, Lord Jesus. Come. &gt;&gt; I'm gonna go too fast. Kevin, don't try to follow me. I'm going to just go quickly. I'm going to have to hurry. But you mark you mark this down. Solomon tells us in the fourth chapter of Proverbs, above all else, guard your heart for everything you do flows from it. Listen, friends, you realize that the heart is so much our inner life. It's so the core being of our uh and and and and it's literally where it's literally where long-term health or long-term damage proceeds from. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you should guard your heart. You shouldn't be allowing these these these Moabites inside your house. &gt;&gt; It's God's house. He's given it to you to live for him and to be an example of the word of God. The Bible warns us, and I I didn't read it. Well, I think we did read it today. Yes, we did in our text where we were in Ephesians 5, have nothing to do with the fruitful fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them. Paul goes on to tell the Philippian church in the fourth chapter. encourages us to focus on things that are true, things that are noble, things that are right, things that are pure, things that are lovely, things that are admirable, things that are excellent, things that are praiseworthy. Are the elements sleeping in my house praiseworthy? Have I opened the door and now there's a part of me that's manifesting something that the the life song of my praise is contaminated? There's accountability when you're a Christian. You believe that? Let me leave you with some good news today. I needed this so bad when I came across it. Let's just be honest. Let's just be honest. If you'll be honest with me, real honest, then I'll stop right here. If I if I detect that you're not being honest and you're just trying to get out of church, I'm gonna keep going. Amen. I got lots more I can say. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, maybe sometimes we'd have to admit that we've been careless or distracted, inviting things in that that don't honor him. &gt;&gt; Amen. things that do not build us up &gt;&gt; spiritually. But the beautiful part is that God is merciful and ready to help and ready to forgive and ready to cleanse. And I had forgotten of all my years, I guess, because I only quoted it so far and never quoted the tail end of it, which for me was such a personal moment. And you know, you have those going down through life. You get those great times in the Lord and then sometimes you get something you see in the word and it's been there all along, but suddenly it just means everything to you. And when we read from the apostle John, he says, "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us and purify." Your King James says, "Cleanse, purify us from all unrighteousness." Amen. &gt;&gt; And I when I I said, "Lord, I forgot that it said that. How although I I I knew it since a child reading my Bible, but it suddenly came off the page and it meant so much to me." And I said, ' Not only do I have an advocate with the father, if I do commit a transgression, if I do sin, if I do stumble, if today you're you're here and you're sitting here right now and you realize you got Moabites living inside of your house, or more perfectly his house, and you want to say, "Lord, forgive me." He will. And here's the here's actually the thing that makes it all worth it. He'll purify you of all unrighteousness. I just raised up my hands. Maybe you'd like to raise up your hands with me and say, "Lord God, forgive us, Lord God. We want to have a life song that worships you in purity. Oh, forgive us Lord God when we've allowed the non essential things in our lives and or God forbid that today there'd be young people, old people, married people, single people who feel who find themselves constantly bound, constantly a repeating sin, constantly stumbling. How can I ever be free? Am I possessed by a devil? Am I really a Christian? Do I have the Holy Ghost? Lord God, they couldn't even seek you in that way if they didn't have an interchange inside their heart. And so we raise up our hands today to say, "Forgive me and purify me, oh God. Purify me with righteousness. Purify me. Cleanse me of all unrighteousness." Oh, stand to your feet with me this morning, friends. Why don't you raise up those hands to God and just say, "Purify me, Lord. Purify my heart. Purify my mind. I'm repenting. I'm asking for your pardoning grace. I'm going to get rid of that moabitete. I don't want that in my life anymore, Lord. I want to be a vessel. I want to be a vessel that sings your grace to the world. Purify my heart. Purify my life. May you grant it to us today, Lord. Father, a sermon like this is penetrating and I sure didn't expect it. It seemed to come out of left field on me. I didn't expect it when you when I had the first concept of this little miniseries, Satan's Lucifer's complete competing claim. I didn't imagine. Oh, last time Lord, we had a shout in Jubilee and we ran all over the place rejoicing. Well, today was a little different. But I know these are your people. And I know the same ones who were rejoicing at the word last week were being penetrated today. And it's created a a desire. And I have a desire. Even as I preach it and I've studied it and I've put the notes together. I've been living off of it for days. But today, as I preach it under your anointing, I want a fresh cleansing. Oh God. I want a fresh purging. I want a fresh purifying. I want to be purified of all unrighteousness. Let today be the day. Let today come Lord Jesus. Come purify my heart, oh God. May you grant it, master. We love you. We pause right here, Lord. There's so much more to say, but I feel by your permission we can just stop right here. Give you some time to deal with hearts. I commit it to you, Lord. But I commit myself to you, these people, to you. All those who are streaming or catch this service at a later time. Many will. Lord, I hear from them. We're all in this thing together. I'm so glad of that. I'm so glad, Lord God, that we have a word that's true. that we not only have these challenging questions, but we have the answer to the devil's challenge. If we confess our sins, you are faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Amen. Amen. Let's sing that, brother Kenny. Purify. Purify my heart. Let me be as gold [Music] and preious silver, purified by my heart. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's beautiful. &gt;&gt; Let me be as gold. [Music] Pure gold. Refiner's fire. &gt;&gt; Refiner's fire. &gt;&gt; Oh, why don't you reach out and touch him today? &gt;&gt; Let this song be your prayer to him. &gt;&gt; Say it like this. &gt;&gt; Is to be. &gt;&gt; My life is to be holy. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Set aart for you, Lord. I choose to be. I choose holy. &gt;&gt; Does anybody want prayer today? &gt;&gt; You want to come forward and let me pray with you and say, &gt;&gt; "Brother Jason, I need more of this God in my life." &gt;&gt; Sometimes I I feel like being the one at the front of the line. Friends, we're all in this thing together. &gt;&gt; Why don't you lift up that voice today? Say, "Purify, Lord God. Hallelujah. Some are coming for prayer. You're welcome to come. &gt;&gt; Young people, don't miss your day of visitation. &gt;&gt; Parents, don't miss your day to recalibrate your home. &gt;&gt; Set a new standard &gt;&gt; that your children can see. &gt;&gt; I came to church with this parent. I went home with a different one. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Maybe a parent can say, "I brought this child to church today, but I took a different one home." Oh, granted, oh God. How many can want that kind of movement of the Holy Spirit? Pur &gt;&gt; purify. Purify. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Me from within. [Music] deep within reers.

There's nothing I can do but surrender. &gt;&gt; All I can do is stand here today and surrender. Raise up my hands and say, "I surrender it, Lord. &gt;&gt; I will not I will not ever again take this flow of light back into my life. I'll change and I'll do what's what needs to be done. &gt;&gt; Speak what is true." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I am found. Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; I am yours.
