[0:30] Fantastic.
[0:46] [Music]
[0:53] Praise the Lord.
[0:56] We just stand. I wanted to read um
[0:59] Psalms 125.
[1:02] So,
[1:04] I'm real close to being healed. And uh
[1:06] hopefully I don't get riled up and start
[1:08] dancing around. My wife will come and
[1:11] she'll pull me off stage.
[1:15] Are you happy to be in the house of the
[1:16] Lord? God is good, isn't he? Amen. Are
[1:21] we here under expectation tonight from
[1:24] the Lord? Cuz if you're not, just change
[1:28] your thoughts a little bit and just put
[1:31] yourself under expectation. Just ask him
[1:33] right now in your heart, Lord, will you
[1:35] just answer some questions I have or
[1:38] will you just help me in my life and
[1:40] just be with me and touch me? And that's
[1:44] the kind of expectation that we need to
[1:46] have. Amen.
[1:47] Psalms 12:5 it says, "They that trust in
[1:50] the Lord shall be his mount Zion, which
[1:53] cannot be removed, but abideth forever.
[1:57] As the mountains are round about
[1:59] Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about
[2:02] his people from henceforth even forever.
[2:07] For the rod of the wicked shall not rest
[2:09] upon the lot of the righteous, lest the
[2:12] righteous put forth their hands into
[2:14] iniquity." Do good, O Lord, unto those
[2:18] that be good, and to them that are
[2:20] upright in their hearts. How many want
[2:23] to be upright in your heart? Amen.
[2:26] Amen.
[2:28] As for such as turn aside unto their
[2:31] crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them
[2:35] forth with the workers of iniquity, but
[2:38] peace shall be upon Israel.
[2:43] Amen. And let's just sing some songs of
[2:45] praise tonight.
[2:48] And as the deer panteth for the water,
[2:54] so my soul
[2:57] longeth out.
[3:04] And you alone
[3:08] are my heart
[3:11] desire
[3:13] and I long
[3:16] to worship
[3:18] thee.
[3:23] You alone
[3:26] are my strength,
[3:29] my shield.
[3:32] To you alone
[3:36] does my spirit
[3:39] yield.
[3:43] And you alone
[3:47] are my heart's
[3:50] desire
[3:51] and I long
[3:54] to worship
[3:56] thee.
[4:00] Is he your friend? You're my friend
[4:05] and you are
[4:07] my brother
[4:09] even though
[4:12] you are
[4:14] a king.
[4:16] Think about those words.
[4:19] And I want you more than any
[4:25] other so much more
[4:29] than anything.
[4:31] [Music]
[4:36] And you
[4:38] alone
[4:40] are my strength and my shield.
[4:45] To you alone
[4:49] does my spirit
[4:52] yield.
[4:53] [Music]
[4:56] And you alone
[5:00] are my heart's
[5:02] desire and I long
[5:07] to worship
[5:09] thee.
[5:14] Will I want you more than gold?
[5:20] Oh, silver. Only you
[5:24] can satisfy.
[5:31] Cuz you alone
[5:35] are the real
[5:37] joy giver and the apple
[5:42] of
[5:44] my eye.
[5:48] And you
[5:50] alone
[5:52] are my strength,
[5:55] my shield.
[5:57] To you alone
[6:01] does my spirit
[6:04] yield.
[6:05] [Music]
[6:08] And you alone
[6:12] are my heart's
[6:15] desire
[6:16] and I long
[6:19] to worship
[6:22] thee.
[6:24] [Music]
[6:25] Let's just bow our heads in our heads.
[6:29] Almighty God, it's a privilege to be in
[6:31] your house tonight. Lord,
[6:34] Father, you see the young man and the
[6:36] young sister going to be getting married
[6:38] in the next couple of days. Lord, I pray
[6:41] a blessing upon Gideon, Lord, and his
[6:44] wife to be. I pray a blessing upon each
[6:48] one, Father, that goes on that trip. May
[6:51] their flights go well and may the
[6:53] weather be good, Lord.
[6:54] Amen.
[6:55] Just give our pastor rest, Lord, and his
[6:58] wife. And give them strength, Father. We
[7:01] love you, Lord. We truly in the depths
[7:05] of our heart just want you and we want
[7:07] more of you, Lord, and less of
[7:10] ourselves.
[7:12] Lord, I remember a little young man.
[7:13] man. He was only 5 years old and he just
[7:16] asked me how he got closer to God and
[7:18] how he's supposed to talk to God. The
[7:21] answer was so simple. Get your Bible
[7:24] out, young man, and pray and read your
[7:27] Bible and he will talk back to you.
[7:30] I'll never forget that. And I just pray
[7:32] that sinks down into the depths of his
[7:34] heart.
[7:36] Lord, we love you now. In the name of
[7:38] Jesus Christ, we pray and ask that you
[7:40] bless this service, Lord. Thank you,
[7:42] dear God.
[7:44] Amen.
[7:46] Amen.
[7:49] God is good. Amen.
[7:52] Is it because he lives? Is that why you
[7:55] can face tomorrow? Amen. In the key of
[7:57] F.
[8:02] [Music]
[8:06] [Applause]
[8:06] [Music]
[8:09] I can face
[8:11] tomorrow
[8:14] [Music]
[8:17] because
[8:19] he lives.
[8:23] [Music]
[8:25] All fear
[8:28] is gone.
[8:31] You know who holds your future?
[8:34] Because
[8:36] I know
[8:39] [Music]
[8:42] that he holds my future.
[8:45] [Music]
[8:49] And this life
[8:52] is worth
[8:54] the living
[8:55] [Music]
[8:56] just
[8:58] because
[9:00] he live.
[9:02] Let's just close our eyes and sing it
[9:04] with all of our heart because
[9:08] he lives
[9:11] [Music]
[9:13] and I can face
[9:17] tomorrow
[9:19] [Music]
[9:22] because
[9:25] he lives
[9:27] [Music]
[9:30] all Fear
[9:33] is gone
[9:35] [Applause]
[9:39] because
[9:41] I know
[9:45] yes I know that he holds my future
[9:52] [Music]
[9:54] and my life
[9:57] it is worth
[9:59] living
[10:01] just
[10:03] because
[10:05] he lives.
[10:10] Oh, because
[10:13] you live.
[10:16] Oh, we thank you, Lord. I can face oh
[10:21] tomorrow
[10:26] because
[10:28] you live here.
[10:31] [Music]
[10:33] Oh my fear
[10:36] is gone.
[10:41] Oh, because
[10:43] I know
[10:46] [Music]
[10:49] that you hold my future
[10:54] [Music]
[10:57] and my life. Yes, it's worth
[11:01] the living
[11:04] just because
[11:07] you live. Let's just sing it real soft
[11:10] to him now.
[11:13] Oh, because
[11:14] you live
[11:16] [Music]
[11:20] I can face

[11:31] you live.
[11:34] [Music]
[11:36] All fear
[11:39] gone.

[11:44] Oh, recall.
[11:46] I know
[11:52] that you hold
[11:54] my future.
[11:57] [Music]
[12:00] Oh, and my life.
[12:03] It is worth
[12:05] the living
[12:07] just
[12:09] because
[12:11] you live.
[12:15] Amen. Can we give the Lord a hand clap
[12:17] of praise tonight? Little Luther, come
[12:20] on up and let's pray over the tithes and
[12:22] on the offering. And Amen. We got a
[12:25] couple of specials.
[12:26] [Music]
[12:28] God is good. You think about the words
[12:30] to that song, because he lives. Just
[12:33] imagine if he didn't live, right? How
[12:36] vain would this life be? Couldn't close
[12:39] your eyes. You couldn't pray to nobody.
[12:42] I mean, you'd just be wandering to and
[12:44] fro. The wind would be blowing you every
[12:46] direction.
[12:48] Oh man, I can't imagine life without the
[12:50] Lord. Come on, brother.
[12:55] Bless you. Bless you.
[12:57] And I don't want to imagine that either.
[13:00] Amen. Let's pray.
[13:03] Father, I love you. I thank you for this
[13:06] opportunity this evening, Lord, that I'd
[13:09] open my heart and Father, listen for you
[13:12] to speak to me.
[13:15] Father, I pray that you forgive me for
[13:16] my shortcomings in this life, my faults,
[13:19] my failures. Father,
[13:23] we long to draw closer to you.
[13:27] And I pray, Father, that as you said,
[13:30] two or three are gathered in your name.
[13:32] You're here. Help us to be sensitive to
[13:34] your presence, dear God. As we collect
[13:37] the tithes and offerings, Father, I pray
[13:39] that you bless the cheer forgiver.
[13:42] Lord, I have friends that stream these
[13:44] services
[13:46] and I pray for them this evening.
[13:49] and all those that I may not even know
[13:51] that would be streaming. May there be
[13:53] something said that will be an
[13:55] encouragement to them as well as us this
[13:58] evening. Father, I love you, Lord. I
[14:01] worship you, Father, in Jesus Christ's
[14:03] name. Amen.
[14:07] [Music]
[14:10] You may be seated.
[14:12] [Music]
[14:25] [Music]
[14:54] [Music]
[15:08] Mountains high,
[15:13] valleys low,
[15:18] I will not fear.
[15:20] [Music]
[15:22] What lay before me?
[15:27] Oions wide,
[15:31] storms rage on,
[15:36] I will not fear.
[15:40] You go before me.
[15:45] Yay. Though I walk through the valley of
[15:48] the shadow of death,

[16:03] You're always beside me
[16:07] to lead me and guide me
[16:12] through all of my days.
[16:17] Though the arrows may fly
[16:20] [Applause]
[16:21] through the terror of night,
[16:25] I will not fear.
[16:34] Heart may fail.
[16:39] Darkest night
[16:43] I will not fear.
[16:48] You'll be my light.
[16:52] Flesh may fail.
[16:57] Trials arise.
[17:01] I will not fear.
[17:06] You'll be my guide.
[17:10] Yay. Though I walk through the valley of
[17:13] the shadow of death,
[17:16] [Music]
[17:19] I will not fear. You go before me.
[17:28] always beside me.
[17:32] Lead me and guide me
[17:36] through all of my days.

[17:50] I will not fear.
[17:55] [Applause]
[17:59] You have been my guide
[18:04] through all of my life.
[18:06] [Applause]
[18:08] You've been by my side.
[18:12] Through the darkest of nights,
[18:17] though the enemy comes
[18:22] in like a flood,
[18:25] I will not fear. You go before me.
[18:34] You're always beside me.
[18:38] Lead me and guide me. Through
[18:43] all of my days,
[18:47] though the arrow may fly
[18:52] through the terror of night,
[18:56] I will not fear.
[19:05] I will not fear.
[19:09] [Music]
[19:16] [Applause]
[19:36] [Music]
[19:49] [Music]
[19:57] [Music]
[20:05] [Music]
[20:12] Well, I stood in
[20:14] the courtroom.
[20:17] The judge turned
[20:20] my way.
[20:22] It looks like
[20:25] you're guilty.
[20:28] Well, now what do you say?
[20:36] I spoke of
[20:38] your honor. Oh, I have no
[20:44] defense.
[20:46] But that's when
[20:49] God's mercy
[20:51] walked in.
[20:55] Oh,
[20:57] mercy
[20:59] walked in
[21:02] and he pleaded
[21:05] my case.
[21:07] He called to the stand.
[21:12] It was God's saving
[21:16] grace.
[21:18] The blood was
[21:21] presented
[21:23] and it covered
[21:26] my sin.
[21:28] I was forgiven.
[21:32] When mercy
[21:34] walked in,
[21:39] I stood there
[21:42] and wondered,
[21:44] "Oh, how could
[21:47] this be?
[21:50] That someone
[21:53] so guilty
[21:55] had just been set free.
[22:03] My chains were
[22:06] all broken.
[22:07] Oh, and I felt born
[22:11] again.
[22:13] Well, that moment.
[22:16] Oh, when mercy
[22:18] walked in. Sing it with me. Oh
[22:24] mercy
[22:26] walked in and he pleaded
[22:31] my case.
[22:34] He called to the stand.
[22:39] It was God's saving
[22:42] grace.
[22:45] The blood was
[22:47] presented
[22:50] and it covered
[22:52] my sin.
[22:54] I was forgiven
[22:58] when mercy
[23:00] walking.
[23:03] Mercy
[23:05] walking.

[23:22] lamps?"
[23:23] Amen.
[23:24] Amen.

[23:25] Remember the Bible said there's two
[23:27] people, two types, right? One with oil
[23:30] in their lamps and one not. I want to be
[23:33] one with oil in my lamp. Amen.
[23:36] Well, give me oil in my lamp. Keep me

[28:42] in the light

[28:48] and grace.
[28:50] Let's sing that chorus again.

[29:33] [Music]
[29:34] and grace.
[29:39] [Music]
[29:41] Amen. Can we give the Lord a hand clap
[29:43] of praise again? Lord, you're worthy to
[29:46] be praised.
[29:49] I don't know why. I don't know what's
[29:51] being preached tonight, but for some
[29:52] reason, I feel led to sing this. It's a
[29:54] key sea, the wings of a dove.
[29:58] Amen. Can you imagine being Noah out on
[30:01] that boat? All those years you lived and
[30:04] you you built this magnificent boat and
[30:07] now all of a sudden you're floating and
[30:09] you're just wondering, right? What do
[30:11] you do? Where do you go next? Let's sing
[30:14] this good oldfashioned song.
[30:18] Well, Noah had drifted
[30:24] on the floods many days.
[30:27] [Music]
[30:30] He searched for land
[30:36] when in various ways.
[30:39] [Music]
[30:42] troubles he had some
[30:47] well but not from above.
[30:53] God gave us his sign.
[30:59] On the wings of a dove.
[31:03] [Music]
[31:05] On the wings of a snow
[31:09] white dove.
[31:12] God sends his pure
[31:14] sweet
[31:16] love. A sign from above
[31:23] on the wings of a dove.
[31:29] Well, Jesus our savior
[31:33] [Music]
[31:35] came to earth one day.
[31:39] Oh, thank you Lord. He was born in a
[31:43] stable.
[31:47] Well, in a manger of hes.
[31:50] [Music]
[31:53] And though he rejected
[31:59] well but not from above.
[32:05] God gave us his sign.
[32:11] On the wings of a dove.
[32:15] [Music]
[32:17] On the wings of a snow
[32:20] white dove,
[32:23] God sends his pure
[32:26] sweet
[32:28] love a sign from above
[32:35] on the wings of a dove.
[32:39] Have you ever suffered?
[32:41] And though I have suffered
[32:47] when a
[32:49] way
[32:53] I have cried for my healing,
[32:59] both night and day,
[33:02] [Music]
[33:05] but faith was not forgotten
[33:11] By the father above,
[33:17] he gave me his time.
[33:23] On the wings of a dove,
[33:29] on the wings of a snow
[33:32] white
[33:34] dove,
[33:35] God send his pure sweet love.
[33:41] A sign from above
[33:47] on the wings of li.
[33:53] Amen.
[33:55] I like singing those old songs. Some of
[33:58] you real young people need to learn
[34:00] those old songs, man. Or some real
[34:03] anointing on them. And the words, you
[34:05] think about the words to some of those
[34:07] songs, it's like, wow, man. Oh, man. You
[34:12] want to reach out and touch the Lord? Is
[34:14] that the desire of your heart? Amen.
[34:17] Tonight,
[34:19] says the key of F.
[34:23] Reach out
[34:26] and touch the Lord.
[34:30] As he
[34:33] goes by,
[34:36] you will find
[34:39] he's not too busy
[34:43] to hear your heart's cry.
[34:49] He is passing
[34:52] by this moment.
[34:55] Your needs to
[34:59] sublime.
[35:01] Reach out
[35:04] and touch the Lord

[35:28] he's not too busy
[35:32] to hear your heart's cry.

[36:08] As he
[36:11] goes by,
[36:14] you will find
[36:16] he's not too busy.
[36:21] Oh, thank you, Lord.
[36:24] Right.
[36:26] He is passing
[36:29] by this moment.
[36:32] your needs to
[36:36] supply.
[36:38] Reach out
[36:40] and touch the Lord
[36:44] as he
[36:47] goes by.
[36:52] Amen.
[36:54] God is good.
[36:57] Let's sing Amazing Grace.
[37:00] [Music]
[37:03] Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[37:07] Oh, amazing
[37:11] grace,
[37:14] how sweet.
[37:18] Oh, the sound
[37:21] that had saved
[37:25] a wretch.
[37:28] Oh, like me
[37:37] was lost.
[37:40] Oh, but now,
[37:43] now I am found.
[37:46] I was blind.
[37:50] But now
[37:52] I see.
[37:58] Oh, amazing
[38:02] grace,
[38:04] how sweet
[38:08] will the sound
[38:10] that save
[38:13] a miserable wretch.
[38:16] Oh, like me.
[38:22] I once
[38:25] was lost.
[38:28] Oh, but now,
[38:31] now I am found.
[38:34] I was blind,
[38:37] but now
[38:40] I see.
[38:43] It was grace. Amen.
[38:46] was grace
[38:49] that taught
[38:52] my heart.
[38:55] Oh to fear
[38:58] and grace.
[39:01] Oh my fear.
[39:10] How preious
[39:12] [Music]
[39:14] did
[39:16] that grace
[39:19] appear.
[39:20] [Music]
[39:22] Holy
[39:25] that I first
[39:28] believe.
[39:31] Now just sing praise God. Praise God.
[39:36] Praise God.
[39:40] Praise God.
[39:43] Oh, praise God.
[39:45] Praise God.
[39:49] Praise God.
[39:52] Praise God.
[39:57] Praise God.
[40:00] Praise God.
[40:03] Praise God.
[40:06] Praise God.
[40:09] Praise God.
[40:12] Praise God.
[40:15] Praise God.
[40:17] We've been there for 10,000 years.
[40:21] when we
[40:24] been there
[40:27] 10,000
[40:30] years
[40:33] bright shineing
[40:36] as
[40:39] the sun.
[40:44] We have no
[40:47] less days
[40:49] [Music]
[40:50] to sing
[40:53] our God's praise
[40:56] than when
[40:59] we have first
[41:02] begun.
[41:07] I'll be thankful for the grace of God.
[41:11] I know I am.
[41:14] I'm thankful to be here tonight.
[41:19] Falls my lot to stand here. I'm nervous
[41:22] for some reason.
[41:26] I think I'm nervous every time though.
[41:29] Once I get up here and get going, I'm
[41:31] okay. But
[41:32] Amen.
[41:33] How many has a need on your heart
[41:34] tonight?
[41:36] Amen.
[41:37] Let's all go before the author.
[41:40] Heavenly Father,
[41:43] Lord, we always first want to thank you
[41:45] for the opportunity to come into church,
[41:47] Lord.
[41:49] Father, I pray may your spirit just be
[41:51] welcome here tonight, God.
[41:54] May your anointing just come down upon
[41:56] the speaker and the hearer, Lord. You
[41:59] see the hands that was raised, many
[42:00] needs. Lordise,
[42:02] those that's on the internet. Father,
[42:03] you see their needs as well. Lord, I
[42:05] pray may you just move for each one of
[42:07] us. Father, help me to step aside to get
[42:10] out of my own way, Lord, and let you
[42:12] take over, Father. Lord, anoint my lips,
[42:15] anoint their ears.
[42:16] Amen.
[42:17] Father, we'll give this service into
[42:18] your hands in Jesus name. Amen. If you
[42:22] have your Bibles, let's turn to the book
[42:24] of Psalms,
[42:26] chapter 139.
[42:29] We'll read verse 7 down through verses
[42:31] 12.
[42:37] Psalms 139
[42:40] verse 7.
[42:43] Whether shall I go from thy spirit or
[42:46] whether shall I flee from thy presence?
[42:49] If I ascend up into heaven, thou art
[42:52] there. If I make my bed in hell, behold,
[42:56] thou art there. If I take the wings of
[42:59] the morning and dwell in the uttermost
[43:01] parts of the sea, even there shall thy
[43:04] hand lead me, and thy right hand shall
[43:06] hold me. And if I say, Surely the
[43:09] darkness shall cover me, even the even
[43:12] the night shall be light about me.
[43:15] Yay, the darkness hideth not from thee,
[43:18] but the night shineth as a day, and the
[43:20] darkness and the light are both alike to
[43:22] thee.
[43:24] May God added blessings to the dream. of
[43:25] your seats for a title this evening.
[43:28] Little simple little thought
[43:31] I want to speak on. It was there all the
[43:35] time.
[43:36] You'll say, "What was there?" Say, "What
[43:39] are you even talking about?" Something
[43:42] had to be there. I'm going go ahead and
[43:43] give a punchline to my sermon. Something
[43:46] you need is here right now.
[43:48] Amen. You know, when you were born, the
[43:50] doctor took you and smacked your bottom
[43:53] and you you let out a big scream and the
[43:56] breath of life went inside of you. The
[43:59] seed of life was placed in you before
[44:00] the foundation of the world. Something
[44:03] was always with you. It don't matter
[44:05] where you went. It don't matter what
[44:07] kind of life you lived and where you it
[44:11] it don't matter if your family was a
[44:12] bunch of bunch of drunkards or drug
[44:15] addicts or murderers. Something was on
[44:17] the inside of you that kept you.
[44:19] Amen.
[44:20] That followed you around. You know, you
[44:21] remember when you was getting ready to
[44:23] do something wrong and you'd have
[44:25] something to say, don't do that.
[44:27] How many how many members having that?
[44:29] There's something all the way around
[44:30] you. Because we know, brother Ram says
[44:31] when you were born, an angel was
[44:33] dispatched to you.
[44:35] So, you have something with you tonight.
[44:37] That angel has not gone back to heaven.
[44:39] He's been with you every step of the
[44:41] way.
[44:42] Wherever you go, something has been
[44:44] there with you. So this something is
[44:47] with so but you started searching for
[44:49] churches. You might have started out in
[44:51] a Catholic church and didn't seem you
[44:53] know I'm not happy here. So you started
[44:56] get went to a Baptist church and that
[44:58] wasn't didn't didn't feel right. And so
[45:01] you started going to different kind of
[45:02] churches. But one day you was driving
[45:03] down the road and you seen a a sign
[45:06] Bethl Tabernacle, House of God's Bread.
[45:10] I'm going to pull in there for a
[45:11] service. And the preacher was preaching
[45:13] and something struck that seed that was
[45:16] on the inside of you that laid dormant
[45:18] for years. It might have been 12 years
[45:21] old. You might have been 30, 50, 70.
[45:25] But that seed laid dormant inside of
[45:27] you. All of a sudden, something
[45:30] happened. That thing had been with you
[45:33] this entire time came to life.
[45:37] We'll search for something that we
[45:39] already have. Yeah.
[45:41] You heard the saying the grass is
[45:42] greener on the other side of the fence.
[45:48] Once you get over there and you realize
[45:50] it's not
[45:53] Did I lose myself?
[45:58] What happened?
[46:00] Okay.
[46:03] You get over there, the grass is not as
[46:04] green as you thought it was. You look
[46:07] back where you were and say, "What? The
[46:09] grass was greener over there, but you
[46:11] couldn't make up your mind. But you'll
[46:13] keep searching for something. You'll
[46:14] keep searching for happiness. You'll
[46:17] want to find it somewhere else. But we
[46:18] often fail to see what God has already
[46:21] provided. The problem is not the lack of
[46:24] provision.
[46:26] It's a lack of recognition.
[46:27] That's right.
[46:28] We don't recognize what we have. If you
[46:31] have the Holy Ghost, you have the power
[46:33] of God, but we'll sit like we don't have
[46:35] it. Come on.
[46:37] What we need tonight is recognition of
[46:40] what we already
[46:43] possess.
[46:44] Amen.
[46:46] Second Kings 4:1.
[46:50] Sure. She'll put it up there. Don't try
[46:53] to keep up with me. I'll say scripture,
[46:55] but I'll be moving. But this one I won't
[46:58] be read. 2 Kings 4:1.
[47:01] Now there cried a certain woman of the
[47:03] wives of the sons of the prophets unto
[47:05] Elisha.
[47:07] I'm preaching on it was it was there all
[47:09] the time.
[47:09] Yeah.
[47:10] Saying, "Thy servant,
[47:13] thy servant, my husband is dead.
[47:17] And thou knowest that thy servant did
[47:19] fear the Lord, but the creditors have
[47:23] come to take him, my two sons, to
[47:26] bondage."
[47:28] That was a law back in those days. If
[47:29] you couldn't pay your debt, they was
[47:30] going to take your kids.
[47:33] So she comes, this widow had lost her
[47:35] husband. Now she faced losing her sons
[47:36] to slavery. So in her distress, she
[47:40] cried out
[47:42] to the prophet.
[47:44] God always has a way of escape for his
[47:48] people. If you'll just trust him and
[47:51] believe him, he'll make a way when there
[47:55] is no way. Amen.
[47:57] It may seem all hope is lost.
[48:00] It don't mean God has abandoned you.
[48:03] Amen.
[48:03] It don't mean he's left you off by
[48:05] yourself. It's set up for a miracle.
[48:09] God never fails to provide for his
[48:12] children.
[48:14] Even when a time of hopelessness,
[48:17] so Elisha just says unto her, "What
[48:20] shall I do for thee?
[48:23] I don't have no money. What are you
[48:25] asking me for?
[48:30] But what have you in your house? She
[48:32] says, "Well, I don't have anything." So,
[48:36] she must have already got rid of her
[48:38] furniture, got rid of her refrigerator,
[48:40] got rid of her recliner. So, she said,
[48:42] "I have nothing but a small, save a pot
[48:46] of oil." Which that oil was real small.
[48:50] What a big jar. Small.
[48:54] It's
[48:55] They used this pot of oil. It's
[48:57] described as a small jar. Indicate it
[48:59] was a very small container, not a large
[49:02] pot.
[49:05] This was the only thing she left in her
[49:07] house, had it in her house of value.
[49:10] But she didn't know what she possessed.
[49:13] Sometimes we sit in church services and
[49:15] we don't know what we possess. We'll
[49:17] come in here, we'll be sick, but we
[49:19] don't know what we got.
[49:22] That oil was called the anointing oil.
[49:25] It was used for special occasions for
[49:27] anointing for birthdays and and weddings
[49:29] and for anointing prophets, anointing
[49:31] the dead.
[49:33] Anointing oil. We know a scripture the
[49:36] woman used it come to wash the feet of
[49:38] Jesus. Got that little bottle of
[49:40] ointment and anointed his feet.
[49:43] Her answer was already in the house.
[49:48] Many times we'll cry out for help.
[49:51] Amen.
[49:52] Not realizing that God has already
[49:54] provided what you have need of.
[49:57] He's already provided the solution. He
[49:59] just wants us to recognize it.
[50:02] To recognize it and use it.
[50:06] Then he says, "Go borrow these vessels
[50:09] abroad of all thy neighbors, even empty
[50:12] vessels, and borrow not a few.
[50:18] Go get all you can get.
[50:23] And when thou art come in, thou shalt
[50:25] shut the door upon thee.
[50:28] He said, I want you to get behind the
[50:30] veil and close the door. You want a
[50:33] miracle? Get behind the veil with a
[50:35] shina of glory tonight where it's just
[50:37] you and God.
[50:38] Where you can recognize his presence.
[50:42] Get in there and shut the door upon thee
[50:44] and upon thy sons. Shut the world out.
[50:48] Amen.
[50:48] Close the door that they are alone. That
[50:51] nobody can come in the door. Lock it.
[50:54] Don't let nobody come in and see what's
[50:56] going on.
[50:58] Just her and God. Her and God. And then
[51:01] thou shalt pour out into all these
[51:04] vessels.
[51:06] What if she had just said,
[51:08] "How is this going to fill up all of
[51:11] that?"
[51:14] She wouldn't have got nothing. Amen.
[51:16] She would have poured that out and it
[51:18] been empty just like that.
[51:20] But what happened?
[51:24] And it came to pass when the vessels
[51:26] were full that she said unto her son,
[51:28] "Bring yet another vessel,
[51:31] and he said unto her, there is no more."
[51:34] And the oil stayed.
[51:37] So she got one vessel. She's washing it.
[51:40] How's this even going to work? Washed it
[51:42] fill up. Give me another one. Hurry.
[51:44] Give me another one. Hurry. Give me
[51:46] another. I don't know how many she had,
[51:48] but she had a lot of vessels.
[51:51] She filled up every one of them. The oil
[51:53] stayed. It ran no longer. Her miracle
[51:56] was over.
[52:00] If you have the Holy Ghost tonight, it
[52:02] won't run dry.
[52:03] It'll just overflow.
[52:06] The Holy Spirit is the oil that never
[52:09] runs dry. Amen.
[52:12] If you just keep bringing your empty
[52:14] vessels, God will just keep pouring
[52:15] himself out. Here's my cup, Lord. I lift
[52:19] it up, Lord.
[52:21] Come and fill it up.
[52:24] Then she came and told the man of God,
[52:25] he says, "Well, go sell it.
[52:29] Pay thy debt."
[52:31] Amen.
[52:32] And live thou and thy children on the
[52:36] rest. She didn't have anything else to
[52:39] worry about.
[52:40] Amen.
[52:41] Nothing to worry about. Many times we'll
[52:43] just struggle. We'll cry out for help
[52:46] thinking that what we need is so far
[52:50] away.
[52:51] Amen.
[52:52] But God has already provided. This widow
[52:54] thought she had nothing,
[52:58] yet she had everything.
[53:00] Amen.
[53:01] Everything in a little jar of oil.
[53:07] It was there all the time.
[53:11] She didn't need to sell her furniture.
[53:13] She didn't need to sell everything in
[53:14] her house. All she had was that little
[53:17] pot of oil. All she needed, you know, a
[53:21] man I used to work with, speaking of it
[53:23] was there all the time. Simple little
[53:25] thought.
[53:27] I was working with a man one day. We're
[53:29] building stuff and I said, "Hey, cut me
[53:32] this board." And I gave him a
[53:33] measurement and I go over, he pulls his
[53:35] tape and he's looking everywhere for a
[53:38] pencil. I wasn't paying any attention,
[53:42] but after a little bit, I'm like, "Why
[53:43] is taking you so long?
[53:46] I'm looking for my pencil."
[53:48] But he didn't know he had it the whole
[53:50] time.
[53:50] Yeah.
[53:51] It was right on his ear.
[53:53] I said, "Look on your ear. What you need
[53:56] is with you right now." Amen.
[53:58] Just a little carnal thing there, but
[54:02] that's the way we are.
[54:04] We need something from God, but not
[54:06] realizing what we need is already here.
[54:11] You say, you're repeating yourself. So,
[54:16] it's not off in some far away place. God
[54:18] didn't place you in this day without
[54:21] giving you what you needed.
[54:24] That's right.
[54:25] God never places his people somewhere
[54:27] without providing everything that you
[54:29] need. But the problem is we fail to
[54:31] recognize it.
[54:33] Amen.
[54:35] We fail to recognize what God has
[54:37] already provided has been with us the
[54:40] entire time.
[54:43] You're like, "Where are you going?
[54:46] Just hang on.
[54:50] There's enough here for a miracle."
[54:52] But you must believe. We must have
[54:55] faith.
[54:57] Bren says this. The greatest thing I
[54:59] find wrong with a church today is a sin
[55:01] of unbelief. We're scared to take God at
[55:05] his word.
[55:06] We're scared to believe him.
[55:10] Healing and deliverance is yours. It's
[55:12] here.
[55:13] Because Isaiah 53:5 says, "With his
[55:16] stripes, we are healed."
[55:20] Your healing is not some future event.
[55:22] say, "Well,
[55:24] I'll get healed maybe tomorrow. Maybe
[55:26] when brother Jason gets back and he can
[55:28] lay hands on me, I'll be healed." Your
[55:30] healing is not some future event. Your
[55:32] healing can be right now.
[55:37] That same faith that saved you is the
[55:40] same faith that'll heal you.
[55:43] It's already done. We just got to
[55:45] believe it. We got to accept it. Healing
[55:48] is not something we have to beg for. Oh
[55:51] God, please.
[55:53] Please heal me. Please, Lord, I need
[55:57] $100 right now.
[56:00] We don't have to beg him for it. He
[56:02] knows what you have need of.
[56:04] Amen.
[56:05] We don't have to beg him cuz brother,
[56:07] you know, brother, I says, when you
[56:09] receive the Holy Ghost, everything you
[56:11] need is in you. Then
[56:15] we just need to activate it.
[56:18] You got to activate what's inside of
[56:20] you. Activate means to make active or
[56:24] put an individual or unit on active
[56:27] duty. We know what active duty is. When
[56:30] you're in the army, you get called up.
[56:31] Say, "Hey, you're going overseas. You're
[56:33] on active duty." We need to do our faith
[56:35] like that. We need to put our faith on
[56:37] active duty tonight. Put your faith in
[56:40] action. Activate your faith,
[56:43] not our faith. Because my faith won't
[56:46] heal a headache.
[56:49] You sit here and try all you want to. My
[56:51] faith is going to heal this thing.
[56:55] Not our faith. It's not our faith. Our
[56:58] faith can heal a headache. We need the
[57:00] faith of Almighty God.
[57:04] Hebrews 11:1 says, "Faith is the
[57:06] substance of things hoped for and the
[57:08] evidence of things not seen. Activate
[57:11] it. Blessed are they that have not seen,
[57:13] but believe. Cuz faith cometh by
[57:17] hearing.
[57:20] So if you're hearing tonight,
[57:22] faith cometh by hearing. What are you
[57:24] hearing? You're hearing the word.
[57:27] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[57:29] the word of Brad Y.
[57:33] No, no, no. Ain't what said that hearing
[57:36] by the word of God.
[57:38] We're not here to hear some man.
[57:41] If you came to hear me now, you're
[57:43] disappointed. I'm disappointed if you
[57:46] come to hear me. But we come to hear
[57:48] what God has want to speak to us. We
[57:50] come to hear the voice of God. So
[57:52] hearing the word will activate your
[57:55] faith.
[57:56] Hallelujah.
[57:57] What happened with the woman of the
[57:58] issue of blood?
[58:01] There's a big crowd around Jesus. She
[58:03] couldn't get to him.
[58:04] Yeah.
[58:06] But she said, I if I can just touch the
[58:09] hem of his garment, I'll be made whole.
[58:15] Notice she crawls down, goes between the
[58:17] people's legs and around this and just
[58:19] gets up there where she can just barely
[58:22] touch Jesus. He couldn't even see her.
[58:25] And she backs up, backs into the crowd.
[58:28] Jesus stops. Who touched me?
[58:31] Peter says, "Are you crazy?
[58:34] Look at all these people. Everybody's
[58:37] touching you."
[58:39] No, this was different.
[58:42] virtue left me.
[58:44] What she needed, she just reached out
[58:46] and touched the Lord as he passed by.
[58:51] That's what you got to do. Just reach
[58:53] out and touch the Lord. He's passing by
[58:55] you tonight.
[59:01] If healing is what you need, reach out.
[59:05] If overcoming power is what you need,
[59:07] reach out.
[59:08] Amen.
[59:12] You want to overcome anxiety or
[59:13] depression, just reach out while he
[59:16] passes by you. You already have the
[59:19] faith in you
[59:20] to overcome.
[59:22] Amen.
[59:23] Because Romans 12:3 says, "God hath
[59:25] dealt to every man the measure of
[59:28] faith." He's given each one of us the
[59:30] measure of faith.
[59:32] We don't need no more.
[59:35] We don't need no more faith.
[59:38] We don't need more faith. We just need
[59:40] to use the faith we already have
[59:43] cuz Jesus said even faith the size of a
[59:45] mustard seed can move a mountain.
[59:49] Verses, oh, you say, "Oh, if I could
[59:51] just get more faith." You don't need
[59:53] more faith. You just need to recognize
[59:55] what you already have.
[59:59] You got to activate your faith. Stop
[1:00:01] waiting for more faith. Start using what
[1:00:04] you already have.
[1:00:06] Amen.
[1:00:06] Take action. step into what God has
[1:00:10] promised.
[1:00:11] Because Mark 11:24 says, "Therefore I
[1:00:13] say unto you, what things soever you
[1:00:15] desire when you pray, believe that you
[1:00:19] receive them, and you shall have them."
[1:00:24] You already have in the spiritual realm.
[1:00:27] Just believe it and receive it. It's
[1:00:29] already here.
[1:00:31] But we often fail to see that God has
[1:00:34] placed everything we need within our
[1:00:37] reach.
[1:00:39] We pick this thing up every day.
[1:00:44] If it's just to move it because you're
[1:00:45] wanting the dust,
[1:00:49] but we pick up that Bible every day and
[1:00:52] everything you need is right here in the
[1:00:54] word of God.
[1:01:00] Hope this is all right.
[1:01:02] What God has provided is already with
[1:01:05] you.
[1:01:07] What little simple story of Moses.
[1:01:10] Very familiar. We know what Moses Moses
[1:01:13] was on the back side of the desert.
[1:01:15] Had a stick in his hand. 40 years. He
[1:01:18] might have carried that stick around.
[1:01:20] Helped him walk around. Help him hit a
[1:01:22] sheep or whatever he want to do with it.
[1:01:25] He walked around with that stick. But
[1:01:27] one day he seen a fire.
[1:01:31] He said, "Why is that bush on fire, but
[1:01:33] it's not just being destroyed?" So he
[1:01:35] walks over
[1:01:37] and God says, "Hey, I've come down to
[1:01:40] deliver my people and I'm going to send
[1:01:41] you, Moses,
[1:01:44] me. I'm 80 years old. What am I going to
[1:01:48] do?"
[1:01:50] He says, "What's in your hand?" Just a
[1:01:53] rod,
[1:01:55] a dead stick.
[1:01:57] will throw it on the ground. And we know
[1:01:59] what happened. Turned into a snake and
[1:02:00] he reached down, pick it back up, turn
[1:02:01] back into a rod. That same thing that
[1:02:04] Moses walked around with for 40 years
[1:02:09] was on the way to Egypt
[1:02:12] to take over.
[1:02:14] Where you going, old man? I'm going to
[1:02:17] Egypt.
[1:02:19] What are you going to do down there? I'm
[1:02:21] going to take over
[1:02:23] you. It's you and your wife and your
[1:02:25] kids. How are you going to take over
[1:02:28] Egypt? Because I got a stick.
[1:02:38] God thought he was nothing.
[1:02:41] But God showed him that what he had, a
[1:02:44] simple rod, was enough
[1:02:46] to lead Israel out of Egypt.
[1:02:51] He thought he was inadequate. I can't
[1:02:54] speak plain. I don't have good speak
[1:02:57] speech. Don't worry what you're going to
[1:02:58] say, Moses, because I'll put the words
[1:03:00] in your mouth.
[1:03:03] Everything Moses needed was right there
[1:03:05] with him.
[1:03:06] Amen.
[1:03:07] Something he carried around for 40
[1:03:08] years, didn't even know it.
[1:03:12] He just looked at that stick and said,
[1:03:15] "How are you going to take over Egypt?"
[1:03:21] It's like me when it When I started
[1:03:23] getting a call to preach,
[1:03:25] I told I told my wife when I was a
[1:03:28] teenager, we started dating that I I
[1:03:29] felt a call, but I ignored it.
[1:03:33] You preachers know what I'm talking
[1:03:35] about. Anybody wants to preach, they're
[1:03:37] out of their mind.
[1:03:42] But when I turned 40,
[1:03:45] it came back. I'm like, I'm too old now.
[1:03:49] I'm 40 years old. How in the world am I
[1:03:52] going to preach? I'm too old.
[1:03:54] I got listened to a message just a
[1:03:56] couple days ago. I was working listen
[1:03:58] brother Ram say God will call a man when
[1:04:01] he's 40. He called Moses out of Egypt
[1:04:03] when he was 40. He called King David to
[1:04:05] the throne when he was 40. I like well
[1:04:09] who am I?
[1:04:13] Use me.
[1:04:15] I want to be used.
[1:04:18] The same rod that Moses led the sheep
[1:04:20] would later part the Red Sea and defeat
[1:04:22] Pharaoh's army.
[1:04:26] Brother said, "It's not how big you are
[1:04:28] or how educated you are. It's how
[1:04:30] willing you are to let God use what's in
[1:04:34] your hand."
[1:04:35] You I don't have nothing.
[1:04:39] I can't even sing. I can't even whistle.
[1:04:46] But you can pray for us.
[1:04:47] Amen.
[1:04:48] You can go outside and tell somebody
[1:04:50] about Jesus. You've got something to do.
[1:04:53] We all have a job.
[1:04:59] I better not say it, but I'm going to
[1:05:01] anyway. If you're if you got a talent
[1:05:06] and you can sing and don't
[1:05:08] Yeah.
[1:05:09] Shame on us.
[1:05:10] Amen.
[1:05:11] I say us.
[1:05:12] Amen.
[1:05:13] Shame on us for not doing it. Yeah.
[1:05:16] So, expect everybody be up here singing
[1:05:17] Sunday morning. You know who you are.
[1:05:21] I've heard you sing. I know you can do
[1:05:23] it. That was free.
[1:05:26] It's not how big you are, how educated
[1:05:28] you are. It's how willing you are to let
[1:05:30] God use what's in your hand.
[1:05:32] Amen.
[1:05:33] So, what's in your hand? What has God
[1:05:36] given you that you've been overlooking?
[1:05:40] God will never judge you how big you
[1:05:42] are, how little you are, or how much
[1:05:45] education you got, or how much you
[1:05:47] haven't got. He judges you by what's in
[1:05:50] your hand and how you use it.
[1:05:55] What's in your hand?
[1:05:57] What's in your hand? You know what's in
[1:05:59] your hand. We have a word right here
[1:06:02] that's in our hand because we know right
[1:06:04] here can defeat the devil anytime.
[1:06:07] Amen. Right.
[1:06:09] Not just when you're feeling good.
[1:06:11] Come on.
[1:06:12] Not just after you come out of church
[1:06:13] service. Where's the devil at?
[1:06:17] It's Monday morning. When you get up,
[1:06:21] oh God, it's 6:00.
[1:06:24] I'm going to lay here just a little bit
[1:06:25] longer.
[1:06:27] If I get out of bed, the devil's going
[1:06:28] to be there.
[1:06:33] You have the word.
[1:06:35] You have the word. What's in your hand?
[1:06:38] I like this story of Shamgar.
[1:06:41] I'm going to give I heard brother Matt.
[1:06:43] We listen to brother Matt's preach just
[1:06:45] a couple months ago at brother Joe
[1:06:47] howishells
[1:06:49] and he was preaching. He he me he
[1:06:51] mentioned something about Shamgar. I
[1:06:52] can't remember all what he said about
[1:06:53] it.
[1:06:55] But when he was talking about Shamgar, I
[1:06:57] spoke out loud in the sermon. It was
[1:07:00] there all the time.
[1:07:03] Wife turned around looked at me. Sh.
[1:07:05] you're that was loud. I was like, so I
[1:07:09] started I went back home. I started
[1:07:11] that's weird. I'm gonna start studying
[1:07:12] on that. It was there. That's a simple
[1:07:14] little thought.
[1:07:15] But but you know the story of Shamgar.
[1:07:19] Shamgar every year, year after year
[1:07:22] after year
[1:07:24] planted his crops, reaped them, put them
[1:07:27] in the barns. Here comes the devil. Take
[1:07:29] it away from him. Year after year after
[1:07:32] year. You would think he would get tired
[1:07:34] of that.
[1:07:36] seeing his wife and children crying
[1:07:38] because they have no clothes, nothing to
[1:07:40] eat.
[1:07:42] But one year, he finally had enough.
[1:07:46] Amen.
[1:07:47] Shamgard finally had enough. When we
[1:07:49] going to have get enough of the devil,
[1:07:51] he comes every day and tries to steal
[1:07:53] your joy. He'll come every day to try to
[1:07:55] steal you peace, but we let him have it.
[1:07:58] Come on, devil.
[1:08:01] Come on in. Have my joy. I'll plan I'll
[1:08:05] I'll have some more for you next year.
[1:08:12] Year after year, the Philistines came
[1:08:14] and stole all his food, took it from
[1:08:17] because they knew Shamgar wasn't going
[1:08:18] to do anything. But they finally came a
[1:08:20] time.
[1:08:23] He said, "I can't take it no more. God,
[1:08:26] what am I going to do? It's just me."
[1:08:30] Him no doubt sitting there praying cuz
[1:08:32] he knew it was done. And he said, "This
[1:08:33] is about the time they came."
[1:08:36] He kept praying. All of a sudden, he
[1:08:38] heard something.
[1:08:42] Pretend I got 600 people
[1:08:46] marching.
[1:08:48] Oh no, here they come again.
[1:08:51] What am I going to do now?
[1:08:56] Lord, if you don't help me,
[1:08:59] they're going to take everything I got
[1:09:01] again.
[1:09:03] He looks over there and sees an ox goat.
[1:09:07] Something he used every day.
[1:09:10] An ox goat was 8 foot long. Had a little
[1:09:13] sharp point on it that they prod the
[1:09:15] cattle with trying to keep them moving.
[1:09:18] That's all he had.
[1:09:21] He grabs that ox goat.
[1:09:24] His wife said, "Shabgar, where you
[1:09:26] going?"
[1:09:28] I'm going to fight. No, please don't.
[1:09:31] You haven't updated your life insurance
[1:09:33] policy yet.
[1:09:39] At least if you were to die, I'll have
[1:09:41] money.
[1:09:45] Lord, where that came from?
[1:09:49] But what Shamgard needed was there all
[1:09:52] the time.
[1:09:53] Amen.
[1:09:54] He used it every day for a tool.
[1:09:59] His wife's husband, what do you think
[1:10:01] you're doing? You can't go fight them.
[1:10:05] He says, "Watch me." He said, "I can't
[1:10:07] take no more." He says, "God, this is in
[1:10:11] my hand.
[1:10:13] You better use it."
[1:10:16] Baressa, he jumps out the window.
[1:10:20] And before he knew it, 600 Philistines
[1:10:22] were dead.
[1:10:25] What in the world?
[1:10:28] One man killed 600 people all because of
[1:10:32] what was in his hand.
[1:10:35] Just think of every devil you could
[1:10:38] defeat tonight.
[1:10:40] If you take the word and put it in your
[1:10:43] hand,
[1:10:47] what Shamgard needed was there all the
[1:10:49] time.
[1:10:53] Jesus is always present
[1:10:55] in your storms.
[1:10:57] Amen.
[1:10:58] Because Mark 4:39 and he arose and
[1:11:00] rebuked the wind
[1:11:03] and said of the sea, "Peace be still."
[1:11:04] The wind ceased. There was a great calm.
[1:11:08] What brought him to this place?
[1:11:12] Jesus was tired.
[1:11:14] Went took him a nap in the boat. And the
[1:11:18] devil says,
[1:11:20] "All right, it's time to kill somebody.
[1:11:22] I'm going to take him down and all his
[1:11:25] followers.
[1:11:26] They're out there with buckets getting
[1:11:28] the water out of their boat.
[1:11:31] Lord,
[1:11:33] what are we going to do? Peter, get
[1:11:35] another bucket.
[1:11:37] Not knowing that what they needed was
[1:11:40] taking a nap.
[1:11:44] What they needed was taking a nap.
[1:11:50] They feared the storm. They thought they
[1:11:52] were alone.
[1:11:56] They didn't hear the scripture. Matthew
[1:11:57] 28:20 says, "Lo, I'm with you always,
[1:12:01] even until the end of the world."
[1:12:05] They feared it. Yet Jesus, it was in the
[1:12:08] boat and they were all alone.
[1:12:11] Wow. Had Jesus with him. He's still
[1:12:12] alone.
[1:12:15] Many times we'll cry out thinking God
[1:12:17] has forsaken us. God, where you at? Come
[1:12:21] on.
[1:12:22] I'm over here.
[1:12:24] I'm over here.
[1:12:26] You got to get through the storms and
[1:12:28] stuff. I'm right here.
[1:12:31] What do you need?
[1:12:33] Wake me up.
[1:12:36] They They feared for their lives
[1:12:38] thinking that Jesus didn't care.
[1:12:42] But Jesus was in that boat all along.
[1:12:45] Amen.
[1:12:48] Thank God. That same voice that spoke,
[1:12:50] "Let there be light." was that same one
[1:12:53] that said, "Peace be still."
[1:12:56] Where I said, "The storm that you think
[1:12:57] will destroy you is the very thing will
[1:12:59] bring you closer to Christ." That's
[1:13:01] what's the matter tonight. Christ is in
[1:13:03] our ship, but we're afraid of the storm.
[1:13:06] The very thing that's got you scared to
[1:13:09] death is a thing that God's going to use
[1:13:11] to bring you closer to him. Amen.
[1:13:14] You're going through a storm. Just say,
[1:13:17] "Thank God.
[1:13:19] I'm getting closer to Jesus."
[1:13:22] Amen.
[1:13:26] Jesus was there all the time, but their
[1:13:28] fear blinded them from seeing that the
[1:13:31] answer was right there.
[1:13:33] Your answer is right here.
[1:13:36] Yes. Amen.
[1:13:37] God's power is already in you. Amen.
[1:13:42] You receive the Holy Ghost, that power
[1:13:45] has been there
[1:13:47] because Ephesians 3:20, now unto him
[1:13:50] that is able to do exceeding abundant
[1:13:53] above all that we ask or think according
[1:13:56] to the power that workketh in us
[1:14:01] unto him that is able to do exceeding
[1:14:04] abundant.
[1:14:05] Amen.
[1:14:06] Beyond measure.
[1:14:08] That's what abundantly means. Beyond
[1:14:11] measure,
[1:14:13] exceeding some number or measure, over
[1:14:16] and above,
[1:14:18] extraordinary.
[1:14:22] That power in you is extraordinary,
[1:14:26] super abundant.
[1:14:29] He's just not simply able to do it what
[1:14:32] we have need of, but he is more than
[1:14:35] able to do it.
[1:14:38] more than able.
[1:14:41] He is able to go above our even our
[1:14:44] highest expectations
[1:14:47] if we pray in faith in his will.
[1:14:51] Yielded to his power that works in
[1:14:54] brother JD.
[1:14:56] That power that works in you. Can I have
[1:14:58] some of it?
[1:15:02] No. That power that works in you.
[1:15:04] Amen. Each one of you has that power
[1:15:07] that works in you.
[1:15:12] He wants you to ask big.
[1:15:14] Ask him. Ask him for big things.
[1:15:19] He is able to do exceedingly above all
[1:15:23] that we ask or even think.
[1:15:28] You don't even have to ask him. Just
[1:15:30] think about it and he's able to answer
[1:15:32] your need.
[1:15:34] Amen.
[1:15:35] Hallelujah.
[1:15:37] Before you think it, he's already
[1:15:39] answered.
[1:15:42] Uh oh, I forgot to start my timer.
[1:15:46] I learned that from brother Matt.
[1:15:49] So if I start now, I still have an hour,
[1:15:50] right?
[1:15:54] Before you think he's already answered
[1:15:57] it.
[1:16:00] According to what?
[1:16:03] according to the power that workketh in
[1:16:06] us.
[1:16:07] Amen.
[1:16:08] So something you've had with you all the
[1:16:10] time,
[1:16:11] that power working in you.
[1:16:15] Power, strength, ability, the power for
[1:16:20] performing miracles
[1:16:22] lives inside of you.
[1:16:26] Gosh,
[1:16:28] they shall lay their hands on the sick
[1:16:29] and they shall recover.
[1:16:32] That ain't just for preachers.
[1:16:34] A mother can go and lay hands on her
[1:16:36] little child
[1:16:37] and pray for that baby healed. That same
[1:16:39] power, they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:16:41] and they shall recover.
[1:16:46] He is able to do so much more than we
[1:16:48] ask or imagine. But it's all according
[1:16:51] to his power that workketh in us.
[1:16:55] Amen.
[1:16:56] It's him in us.
[1:16:59] It's God in you.
[1:17:01] Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:17:06] What is that power?
[1:17:09] It's the power of the Holy Ghost. It's
[1:17:12] God living in your heart.
[1:17:16] The power of God is already working in
[1:17:18] you.
[1:17:23] That same power that raised Jesus from
[1:17:24] the dead lives in you. Yeah,
[1:17:29] that's a real I like that song.
[1:17:32] I can't sing it, but the same power that
[1:17:34] raised Jesus from the dead lives in us,
[1:17:37] lives in me.
[1:17:40] Same power.
[1:17:41] We'll get to we'll catch that revelation
[1:17:43] one day.
[1:17:44] That that same power that raised Jesus
[1:17:47] Christ lives in me.
[1:17:49] So is that when brother R says you'll
[1:17:51] call your own body from the dust of the
[1:17:53] earth? Is that power that lives inside
[1:17:56] of you
[1:17:58] God's power live? That's better any
[1:18:01] dominion energy has.
[1:18:07] The power of God is already working in
[1:18:10] you.
[1:18:13] Luke 17:21 says, "Neither shall they
[1:18:15] say, lo here, lo there, for behold,"
[1:18:19] here's something that's been with you
[1:18:20] the entire time. Behold, the kingdom of
[1:18:23] God is within you.
[1:18:26] Oh gosh. The kingdom of God is within
[1:18:29] me.
[1:18:30] Stop looking elsewhere for it.
[1:18:33] Stop going to another church and say,
[1:18:35] "Where's the kingdom of heaven?" I'm
[1:18:38] looking for the kingdom of heaven.
[1:18:43] It's living inside of you.
[1:18:46] The kingdom of heaven is inside of you.
[1:18:49] Romans 8:11 says, "But if the spirit of
[1:18:51] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[1:18:54] dwell in you, he that raised up Christ
[1:18:57] from the dead shall also quicken your
[1:19:01] mortal bodies."
[1:19:03] Amen.
[1:19:05] By his spirit that dwells in you.
[1:19:10] Again, that same resurrected power that
[1:19:13] raised Jesus up is already in you.
[1:19:17] We're going to activate it one day.
[1:19:20] We're going to activate that power one
[1:19:22] day.
[1:19:27] Lord, let it be tomorrow.
[1:19:30] Let it be tomorrow.
[1:19:32] I don't want to face another day in this
[1:19:34] world. If you do, come on up here. Let's
[1:19:37] lay our hands on you and get you filled
[1:19:39] with the Holy Ghost. You'll be ready to
[1:19:40] get out of this place.
[1:19:44] The church doesn't need a new Pentecost.
[1:19:48] We just need to recognize what God has
[1:19:51] already placed inside of us.
[1:19:53] So go ahead and say it.
[1:19:56] God's power is in me.
[1:19:58] Amen.
[1:20:03] My brother said, "Brother Luther,
[1:20:08] you don't need to look elsewhere. You
[1:20:10] don't need look nowhere else. You don't
[1:20:12] need to go to the internet, start
[1:20:14] searching for it.
[1:20:18] It's already here.
[1:20:22] You don't need to receive anything else.
[1:20:24] You just need to recognize what you
[1:20:25] already have.
[1:20:27] Amen.
[1:20:27] I could have titled this sermon
[1:20:28] recognizing what you got. Been the same
[1:20:31] thing, wouldn't it? That will's oil
[1:20:34] multiplied when she acted on what she
[1:20:37] had. She took God at his word.
[1:20:42] When we gonna start taking God at his
[1:20:44] word tonight,
[1:20:46] let it be tonight.
[1:20:47] I'll take you at your word.
[1:20:49] Amen.
[1:20:51] Step out on faith.
[1:20:54] Second Peter 1:3 says, "According as he
[1:20:56] is divine power has given unto us all
[1:21:00] things that pertain unto life and
[1:21:02] godliness."
[1:21:04] So everything you need is already given.
[1:21:06] Amen.
[1:21:07] Doesn't he say it again?
[1:21:10] Everything you need is already given.
[1:21:14] We don't have to wait on it. We don't
[1:21:16] have to get the piano, the drums, and
[1:21:18] everything. Get it all worked up.
[1:21:21] It's already here.
[1:21:24] You're not waiting on God.
[1:21:26] God's just waiting on us.
[1:21:30] You know, that prodical son had
[1:21:31] everything.
[1:21:33] He had everything.
[1:21:36] But he thought he needed to leave.
[1:21:40] Give me some of my money. I'm going I
[1:21:41] need to get out of this house. You're
[1:21:43] too strict. I'm 18. It's time for me to
[1:21:46] move out.
[1:21:50] How many times have we heard that?
[1:21:56] But what happened to him? He lost all of
[1:21:58] his money.
[1:22:01] Lost all his friends and come to himself
[1:22:05] in a pig lot
[1:22:08] eating pig slop.
[1:22:12] He said he said, "I've got there's stuff
[1:22:14] better than this.
[1:22:16] There's got to be a life better than
[1:22:17] this."
[1:22:19] Or he thought home wasn't a good life.
[1:22:22] He started thinking about it.
[1:22:24] Man, even the servants are wellfed.
[1:22:27] Yeah.
[1:22:29] What am I doing out here walling around
[1:22:30] with a bunch of hogs?
[1:22:34] He realized what he had back at home.
[1:22:36] Amen.
[1:22:38] He realized what he had back at home.
[1:22:40] How many people today are chasing after
[1:22:43] things
[1:22:44] that they already have?
[1:22:47] They're out looking for things that they
[1:22:49] already have.
[1:22:52] So, what you need was always there.
[1:22:56] the power, the provision, the healing,
[1:22:59] the victory.
[1:23:01] Yeah.
[1:23:01] It was never missing. You didn't lose
[1:23:04] it. It was there. You just let somebody
[1:23:08] steal it from you.
[1:23:13] Again, he says, "Lord, I'm with you
[1:23:14] always, even until the end of the
[1:23:16] world."
[1:23:18] We don't need to ask for his presence
[1:23:21] because he's already here.
[1:23:25] Hebrews 13:5 says, "For he hath said, I
[1:23:27] will never leave thee nor forsake thee."
[1:23:30] Thank God. So whatever you face,
[1:23:35] you already have the presence of God
[1:23:36] with you. So God's power is not coming
[1:23:39] down from heaven. It's already working
[1:23:43] in you.
[1:23:44] Amen.
[1:23:45] So that same spirit, the scripture
[1:23:47] again, that raised Jesus from the dead
[1:23:49] is already inside you.
[1:23:54] The greatest power in all the universe
[1:23:57] is right inside of you.
[1:24:02] But the reason we don't see it working
[1:24:03] is because we don't recognize it.
[1:24:08] We have enough power in us to go create
[1:24:11] a universe and go live on it.
[1:24:14] How many times have we,
[1:24:17] Lord, I I'm going to live by myself. I'm
[1:24:20] going to speak a world that exists and
[1:24:22] go live on it. I'm tired of these
[1:24:23] people. I'm people out.
[1:24:29] How many gets people out?
[1:24:34] And I love people.
[1:24:37] Whatever you face,
[1:24:39] you already have his presence.
[1:24:42] You have enough power in you to create a
[1:24:44] universe to go live on it. But says, "If
[1:24:46] there wasn't a law to that, sons and
[1:24:48] daughters of God would create them a
[1:24:50] world out here and go live a private
[1:24:52] life."
[1:24:55] You have the power in you to do it.
[1:24:59] If you got a shadow of the power of God
[1:25:03] in you, you got power to do it.
[1:25:07] That the power that's in you will make
[1:25:11] you could speak a world in exist and go
[1:25:13] live on it. That's what power is in the
[1:25:15] church now. But it's controlled by a
[1:25:18] law.
[1:25:19] Thank God.
[1:25:20] Amen.
[1:25:20] There'll be about 30 different worlds
[1:25:22] right now. We would even have church.
[1:25:23] We'll be streaming Zoom Zoom videos
[1:25:25] having church tonight.
[1:25:30] God will lead your soul to believe
[1:25:34] that is yours. Every place the souls of
[1:25:37] your feet can set up on by faith,
[1:25:39] Amen.
[1:25:40] God gives it to you.
[1:25:41] That's right.
[1:25:42] Amen. And he says, "It's yours to
[1:25:44] possess it. If you can find the key to
[1:25:46] this law of faith if you can just
[1:25:49] activate it, get that key and open it
[1:25:51] up." Philippians 4:19 says, "But my God
[1:25:54] shall supply all the need." All your
[1:25:59] needs, not your wants.
[1:26:01] God, I want a million dollars. Sorry,
[1:26:04] you're only getting 20.
[1:26:09] 20 million.
[1:26:13] But God shall supply all the need
[1:26:16] according to his riches in glory by
[1:26:19] Christ Jesus
[1:26:23] again. So everything you need is already
[1:26:26] in you
[1:26:28] when you receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:26:32] The problem is we don't know what we
[1:26:34] got.
[1:26:35] Yeah.
[1:26:36] We don't know what we got on the inside
[1:26:38] of us. We don't know what kind of power
[1:26:40] lives inside of us. Stop asking for what
[1:26:44] you already have.
[1:26:46] Just start believing it. It's yours.
[1:26:49] Quit looking for something new.
[1:26:52] Just recognize what God has already
[1:26:55] given you.
[1:26:56] Hallelujah.
[1:26:57] We have the anointing.
[1:27:00] Thank God we have the anointing. Because
[1:27:02] 1 John 2:20 said, "But the anointing
[1:27:04] which you have received of him abideth
[1:27:07] in you." Amen.
[1:27:11] And ye need not that any man teach you,
[1:27:13] but as the same anointed anointing
[1:27:15] teaches you all things
[1:27:17] and is truth.
[1:27:19] I'm about finished. The anointing is
[1:27:22] already in you. You just need to walk in
[1:27:24] it. It's not coming.
[1:27:27] That anointing is not coming.
[1:27:31] It's already here. It's already in you.
[1:27:34] Amen. Amen.
[1:27:37] We'll go to these special camp meetings
[1:27:40] which I enjoy them. I go to everyone I
[1:27:42] can.
[1:27:44] We'll go to these spe and it's the it's
[1:27:46] built up. The anticipation is so high.
[1:27:49] Anything can happen.
[1:27:52] We can have a camp meeting tonight.
[1:27:53] Brother JD,
[1:27:56] who's preaching? That's Brad. Oh, come
[1:27:59] on. Got to hear him again.
[1:28:08] You weren't anticipating.
[1:28:10] Amen.
[1:28:12] We all want that special touch.
[1:28:16] Don't we?
[1:28:17] I do.
[1:28:18] I like to have a special touch tonight.
[1:28:20] Amen.
[1:28:20] Lord, here's my cup. Give me a
[1:28:22] refilling.
[1:28:22] Fill me back up, Lord. I need it. I want
[1:28:24] a special touch.
[1:28:26] Amen.
[1:28:27] That special touch abides in you.
[1:28:29] Praise God.
[1:28:31] Hallelujah. It's like that widow's oil.
[1:28:33] She already had it.
[1:28:35] She just need to recognize and act on
[1:28:37] it.
[1:28:38] So when she poured it out in faith,
[1:28:41] the oil multiplied.
[1:28:43] Amen.
[1:28:44] I can do all things.
[1:28:47] That's right.
[1:28:48] Through Christ,
[1:28:49] which strengthens me.
[1:28:53] We don't have to wait on a new blessing.
[1:28:55] Amen.
[1:28:55] I don't have a new blessing. I don't
[1:28:56] have to wait on it. Again, just
[1:29:00] recognize what God has already done for
[1:29:02] you.
[1:29:03] Change the title of that.
[1:29:08] It was there the whole time.
[1:29:11] So, are you searching for something that
[1:29:13] you already have?
[1:29:15] Come on.
[1:29:16] What do you have need of tonight?
[1:29:19] We're going to gather around this front
[1:29:20] here in a few minutes.
[1:29:22] Every one of us had needs because I seen
[1:29:24] your hands raised up before service. We
[1:29:26] started preaching.
[1:29:29] Whatever you have need of, all you got
[1:29:30] to do is ask him.
[1:29:33] All you got to do is ask.
[1:29:35] Have you been crying out for for power,
[1:29:38] for healing, for deliverance?
[1:29:40] It's time to recognize.
[1:29:43] It's time to recognize what you've
[1:29:44] already have.
[1:29:45] Amen.
[1:29:46] Let's stand. You got to recognize what
[1:29:48] you already have and act on it.
[1:29:53] So, it's something that's with you all
[1:29:57] the time.
[1:30:00] You love him.
[1:30:01] Amen.
[1:30:02] What do you have need of tonight?
[1:30:08] Sing us a song, somebody.
[1:30:13] Let's bow our heads.
[1:30:17] [Music]
[1:30:30] He's here.
[1:30:33] He's here to meet any need.
[1:30:36] I just mentioned a couple.
[1:30:40] Healing.
[1:30:42] You lost your joy. You need it back. You
[1:30:44] lost your peace. You need it back.
[1:30:47] [Music]
[1:30:49] You need victory over over the devil. We
[1:30:52] told you how you can do that as well.
[1:30:57] If you have a need tonight, you just
[1:30:59] want to slip up your hands to God and
[1:31:01] say, "Lord,
[1:31:03] I come to you.
[1:31:06] I've heard the word.
[1:31:08] Lord, let me activate my faith
[1:31:11] to believe you'll do what you said
[1:31:14] you'll do.
[1:31:18] Father, you see those hands that was
[1:31:19] raised,
[1:31:21] all over the building,
[1:31:25] Father, knowing that you're standing
[1:31:28] right by them right now, Father.
[1:31:33] Lord, if they're sick, God, may you heal
[1:31:34] them,
[1:31:36] Lord. Whatever their need may be, may
[1:31:37] you just come down,
[1:31:40] Father. May they reach out and touch the
[1:31:43] hem of your garment as you pass by.
[1:31:45] Amen.
[1:31:49] Follow those on the internet as well,
[1:31:50] Father. Lord, may your spirit just go to
[1:31:53] them.
[1:31:55] Father, may your spirit just move upon
[1:31:57] their request, upon their heart, Father.
[1:32:02] Lord, we ask these things and we believe
[1:32:04] it. We're activating our faith tonight,
[1:32:07] Father, to recognize what we already
[1:32:10] have in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:32:13] [Music]
[1:32:17] Right now
[1:32:19] [Music]
[1:32:22] where we lift our hands
[1:32:29] to worship
[1:32:31] at your throne.
[1:32:36] We need you Lord.
[1:32:39] We need you, Lord, right now.
[1:32:44] Raise your hands and tell him. Say,
[1:32:46] "Lord, we need you right now." We need
[1:32:49] you, Lord.
[1:32:51] We need you, Lord. Right now, right now.
[1:33:00] We need you, Lord.
[1:33:03] We need you, Lord,
[1:33:06] right now.
[1:33:11] We lift our hands,
[1:33:14] bow our knees,
[1:33:17] and worship
[1:33:19] at the door.
[1:33:24] Oh, we need you, Lord.
[1:33:28] We need you, Lord, right now.
[1:33:33] Let's sing it again as we gather around.
[1:33:36] We need you, Lord.
[1:33:39] We need you, Lord.
[1:33:43] Right now. Make it personal to me.
[1:33:46] [Music]
[1:33:48] I need you, Lord.
[1:33:51] I need you, Lord.
[1:33:54] Right now.
[1:33:59] We lift our hands.
[1:34:02] I'll bow our knees.
[1:34:05] and worship
[1:34:07] at your throne.
[1:34:12] But I need you, Lord.
[1:34:15] I need you, Lord, right? Right now.
[1:34:23] Looks like we got three prayer requests.
[1:34:26] I remember Sister Jean. She said she had
[1:34:29] a dental procedure. Please pray for
[1:34:32] rapid healing that all the infection
[1:34:34] will clear up quickly.
[1:34:37] Brother Luther turns this in. Prayer
[1:34:39] request for Sister Melissa. She is sick
[1:34:41] and she has a special unspoken request.
[1:34:43] Also, Sister Haley turned this in. There
[1:34:46] was a shooting near where her near her
[1:34:47] work. Please be praying for their safety
[1:34:52] and and for the victims and the
[1:34:53] families.
[1:34:56] Once again, how many has a need?
[1:34:59] You already told him you had it. We're
[1:35:01] going to believe what God's going to do.
[1:35:03] Let's pray for these requests. Heavenly
[1:35:05] Father, Lord, these requests that was
[1:35:08] written in, Lord, Father, I would pray
[1:35:10] for first for Sister Jean.
[1:35:12] Yes, Lord.
[1:35:13] Lord, have this dental procedure.
[1:35:14] Father, Lord, I just pray may no harm be
[1:35:17] done to this little procedure. Father,
[1:35:20] may there be a quick healing and quick
[1:35:22] deliverance for our sister. Father, just
[1:35:24] go to she's in any pain, Lord, may you
[1:35:26] relieve it from her, Lord Jesus. Father,
[1:35:29] Sister Melissa homes sick tonight.
[1:35:31] Father, we send the blood of Jesus to
[1:35:33] her. Father, you because you said by
[1:35:36] your stripes, we are healed. Father, we
[1:35:39] want to activate the faith with our
[1:35:40] sister tonight, God.
[1:35:43] Even now, Father, if she's even probably
[1:35:45] listening to the service, Father, as
[1:35:46] we're praying, Lord, she may have her
[1:35:49] hands lifted up to you,
[1:35:51] but God, may the power, the healing
[1:35:53] power of Jehovah go into our sister,
[1:35:55] Father, and may you heal her. and for
[1:35:58] this unspoken request. Lord, may you
[1:35:59] move for her, Lord. You know what it is,
[1:36:02] Father. May your will be done. Sister
[1:36:05] Hay, the shooting, Father. Lord, you
[1:36:07] know the situation there. Father, we
[1:36:08] pray no harm be done there, Lord.
[1:36:10] Amen.
[1:36:11] May you be with the families and the
[1:36:12] victims, Father.
[1:36:14] Give them grace, Father. I pray, Lord.
[1:36:17] Father, this service coming to a close,
[1:36:19] Father.
[1:36:21] Lord, another one to go down into the
[1:36:22] history books.
[1:36:25] Father, I hope I I' done what you wanted
[1:36:27] me to do tonight, Father.
[1:36:30] Lord, it's so simple, Lord, but God,
[1:36:32] this is what you placed on my heart for
[1:36:34] tonight.
[1:36:35] Lord, I pray, Lord, may you move among
[1:36:37] your people, whatever their need may be,
[1:36:39] God. Lord, may you move forward in the
[1:36:42] name of Jesus Christ.
[1:36:44] Amen.
[1:36:44] Amen.
[1:36:46] Hallelujah.
[1:36:50] Anybody got any testimonies?
[1:36:57] [Music]
[1:37:02] push up.
[1:37:05] My uh Amy's brother um Peter uh on
[1:37:10] Sunday night had a quite an accident. He
[1:37:13] was working on his boat and the on the
[1:37:16] hydraulic lift and it's a it's a 90
[1:37:20] horsepower. So, uh, probably like 400
[1:37:23] lb, something like that. And, uh, it the
[1:37:26] hydraulic failed and, uh, they have a
[1:37:30] spot where there's a little like a
[1:37:32] scissor that comes out that holds it in
[1:37:36] and his arm was there. It fell on his
[1:37:38] arm and he broke he broke his broke his
[1:37:41] arm and uh, he was there working alone,
[1:37:44] yelling for help and I don't even know
[1:37:47] how he did it. that 400 pounds he moved,
[1:37:50] picked the thing up with one hand to get
[1:37:53] it off of his arm. And so it's a it's a
[1:37:55] pretty bad break that he had, but we're
[1:37:59] so thankful. Um the other part was uh
[1:38:03] Amy, our our niece was there who's a
[1:38:06] emergency room nurse, so he it kind of
[1:38:11] went right between both bones. And so
[1:38:14] that knifeike thing cut him. So he's
[1:38:19] bleeding very badly and it's it's uh he
[1:38:23] had surgery on uh on Monday and I think
[1:38:28] five bolts and and a plate in his arm.
[1:38:31] But thank the Lord that he was able to
[1:38:33] get that off his arm and that there was
[1:38:35] a nurse there to put a tourniquet on.
[1:38:37] And I I don't know if I I think she set
[1:38:40] it set the bone as well and was there
[1:38:42] with him on the way to the hospital. So,
[1:38:44] we're just we're thankful for that and
[1:38:45] just also remembering in prayer for a
[1:38:47] good recovery.

[1:38:58] [Music]
[1:39:01] I want to thank the Lord um
[1:39:04] about three weeks ago. I usually take my
[1:39:06] dogs out in the evening to run in the
[1:39:09] yard and uh I took them out that evening
[1:39:12] and I'm I'm normally aware of everything
[1:39:14] around me. I know to watch for snakes
[1:39:16] and different little critters around
[1:39:17] here. And uh that particular evening I
[1:39:21] was um researching something on my
[1:39:23] phone. So I was reading something as I
[1:39:24] was walking with the dogs and they had
[1:39:26] all three of them had shot out and ran
[1:39:28] way ahead of me. And um I noticed one of
[1:39:32] them had come back and she was around my
[1:39:35] leg and she was kind of like in a a bent
[1:39:37] sort of I don't know shape and in my
[1:39:42] mind I was thinking why is she getting
[1:39:43] on my leg? I was it was kind of
[1:39:45] irritating me, but I was ignoring it
[1:39:46] because I was reading. And I heard this
[1:39:49] odd noise and I looked down and
[1:39:53] literally one more step I would have
[1:39:55] stepped on a cotton mouth. And my dog
[1:39:58] was trying to warn me to stay away from
[1:40:01] it. She can't hardly see. She can't
[1:40:02] hardly hear very well. She's very old.
[1:40:05] And um the other dogs had ran back and
[1:40:07] forth two or three times. And he he
[1:40:11] didn't bite them. He didn't bite me. He
[1:40:14] was up in a like a striking position,
[1:40:16] but he never I just very slowly walked
[1:40:19] backwards and took off flying back to
[1:40:23] the camp. I was screaming for Brad and
[1:40:26] uh I the dogs followed me all the way
[1:40:28] back and that it never bit any of us and
[1:40:32] I'm very grateful. Amen.
[1:40:35] [Applause]
[1:40:39] Anybody else?
[1:40:43] I've got this testimony that Jackson,
[1:40:46] she just sent this in.
[1:40:49] She said, "I was out on a
[1:40:53] I was out on a jog
[1:40:56] Monday night and stepped off the main
[1:40:58] road to avoid an oncoming car and she
[1:41:01] accidentally stepped into a pothole.
[1:41:03] Instantly twisting her ankle and fallen
[1:41:05] to the ground. The car never slowed down
[1:41:08] and before I could even stand, it had
[1:41:10] passed her. It was only a few feet away
[1:41:12] and it was close enough that I could
[1:41:14] feel feel it passing.
[1:41:17] If I had only fallen to the side instead
[1:41:19] of forward, I would have fallen right
[1:41:22] into the car's path. She said, "I know
[1:41:24] that God preserved my life." She says,
[1:41:26] "Please keep me in prayer, though,
[1:41:28] because I've I've rolled my ankle when
[1:41:30] she fell and she is still in a lot of
[1:41:32] pain from that."
[1:41:34] I just got a text just now from my
[1:41:37] sister. I wasn't being rude. My wife's
[1:41:39] got a testimony. My sister sent me a
[1:41:40] text. They just her and my dad had to
[1:41:42] leave church early to take my mom to the
[1:41:44] ER.
[1:41:46] She said high blood pressure and a
[1:41:47] headache for a couple of days and
[1:41:49] shortness of breath. When we were
[1:41:51] leaving, she said she has chest pain
[1:41:53] that radiated to her left arm. They're
[1:41:56] there now checking. She'll keep me
[1:41:57] posted. So, if y'all don't mind,
[1:41:59] remember my mom in prayer and and sister
[1:42:02] Deb is as well for a complete complete
[1:42:06] healing.
[1:42:09] Are you happy?
[1:42:10] Amen.
[1:42:12] Are you are you in love with Jesus?
[1:42:14] Anybody
[1:42:16] else got any testimonies before we
[1:42:18] dismiss?
[1:42:22] Sing another song there and just worship
[1:42:24] him right before we leave.
[1:42:30] I
[1:42:32] surrender
[1:42:34] all.
[1:42:36] Do you
[1:42:39] I surrender all.
[1:42:40] I surrender
[1:42:43] all. I surrender all to you.
[1:42:48] All
[1:42:49] to thee,

[1:43:01] all.

[1:43:13] And I
[1:43:16] surrender
[1:43:18] all
[1:43:22] and all
[1:43:24] to thee,
[1:43:26] my blessed
[1:43:29] savior.
[1:43:31] I
[1:43:33] surrender
[1:43:35] all.
[1:43:37] Shake hands with one another.
[1:43:39] and all to Jesus.
[1:43:43] And I
[1:43:45] surrender
[1:43:47] and all
[1:43:49] to him

[1:44:00] love
[1:44:01] and trust him. and in
[1:44:06] his presence
[1:44:08] daily
[1:44:10] live.
