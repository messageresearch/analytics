========================================

Yes, sorry I was on the wrong part. So, second Peter chapter 1 and verse the first uh eight verses. It says, "Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our savior Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue, whereby we are given whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And besides this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, charity. For if these things be in you and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. Let's just pray. Heavenly Father, we just thank you for the word, Lord, this morning. Just a little lesson that we have on our hearts. We just pray that you'd just come and speak to our hearts this morning. Open us up to hear your word. We love you. We just commit all these things to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God bless you. You can be seated this morning. I'm just taking a a a second part or part two the to a thought I took a few weeks ago on the maturing of sons and daughters. And just to catch a few highlights from the last time to help with some foundation, we started talking about the maturing process that takes place in a believer's life when they're born again. And I was just typing some natural examples of how babies or children um as they grow and develop, they don't have the capability to handle objects the way that maybe someone is older can. Um very simple tasks like basic hand eye coordination, um dexterity in their fingers and in their their control, their their fine motor skills because those muscles just haven't developed yet. And I was typing that in scripture to Hebrews where Paul describes being able to um get past the the milk of the word and and getting to a maturity level where we can begin to eat the strong meats. Amen. Of of revelation in our life. And I had made the example because um you know it's it's vital to to to discern the stage that that you're in and that people are in. and with proper discernment and prayer, you know, we we ought to be able to help each other out on the walk that we're on. Amen. Um, and I have some natural examples I want to look at and type them to some spiritual things. This is a very natural example. A few days ago, um, you know, I was just spending some time with with Joy and Lana, and Lana's in this stage right now. She's so excited to learn about everything. And so Joy was teaching her how to write an uppercase A and then a lowercase A. And so she watched, we talked about that last time, she mimicked. So she watched Joy draw the uppercase A and then she did it and she did a really good job and she followed suit. She did, she wrote it just like Joy did. But then she got to the lowercase A. And if I should have put an example up basically [music] what it looked like and it was a circle and a line but it looked like a queue. It looked a little different and you know she watched the correct way to do it and then she tried to do it herself. And the cool thing was is that she was she was so proud of herself. And you know, kind of an important point is is that even though it didn't exactly resemble what it was supposed to, she did try her very best and she made steps towards learning. She she watched the right way to do it, right? And then she tried and it wasn't exact. And I I talked to Joy because, you know, as a dad, you're like, "Well, no, you want to do it this way." And Joy uh the teacher in her, she was like, "You know, actually a lot of kids her age do an upper or a lowercase A like that. It looks like a Q. So that's just normal the stage of development that she's actually in. And even though it wasn't exact um you know uh something I just I thought at this point you know eventually she will be able to write the lowercase a properly. It's just important that she's looking at the right thing. Amen. It's important that she's being shown the right way to do that. The more she practices the better it'll be. Um, and I had taken some time on on kind of that note last time and I mentioned how important it is for believers to have, you know, good examples of other believers in our life. People that people that really manifest the fruit of the word, you know, and and we ought to always lean more towards the word than the world. Amen. And uh the more the more we lean in our lives towards the world and worldly behaviors and worldly atmospheres, the more we can be influenced by that type of thing. I want to go through this quote here because I talked on it last time um about virtues, but I want to start. So we talked about the sermon brother takes this text that I wrote uh read this morning. He takes that in the stature of a perfect man. And we um talked a little bit about that last time. I'm going to we're going to go through some quotes this morning, but we'll start with that foundational element because we kind of mentioned it last time and it's kind of small, but it's all right. Uh that's my fault. First, he says, "First, you must be born again, and then when you're born again, you have faith. You believe the word. Until you're born again, you'll argue against it. If you're just religiously inclined and you got a little human knowledge that you should do right, you'll never be able to agree upon the word of God. You'll never do it. You've got to be born again. And born again, it produces faith. All right? Then after you get faith, this right here, f a t, faith, then you're just in position of growing. Amen. And he goes on to say in the next one, he says, "Now a lot of people go up to the altar and pray and say, Lord, forgive me." and a great experience of sanctification comes upon them and things then you have a great time get up to the altar shouting you go back and say bless God I got it no you just started to a place now where you can grow you ain't done nothing yet see the only thing you done is just laid the foundation so he begins to to bring this foundation out he says now you're going to build a house and you pour the foundation say boy I got her see you got the foundation to build your house on. Now, you got to build a house. Now, there's where the thing comes in this morning. We're going to talk about now. All right, a house. The foundation is first. What is the foundation of Christianity? Faith in the word of God. That's your foundation. Then you can begin to grow. Then you start to begin to add to this foundation. And he says, "Now, building a house, you put your uh you put your uprights and everything else." Brother Wood and some of these carpenters and contractors could tell us how you build your house. But I'm going to tell you how to build your spiritual house where God can dwell. He wants to dwell in you. He wants to make you like himself. He wants you to be reflected reflecting rather his being. He wants his being to be reflected in your life. So he he's going to type out and this is kind of a a really good teaching on that. He says that's where you begin to grow. You can put that down for just a minute. [snorts] That's where you begin to grow. He he wants to make us like himself. And I, you know, that's just a really important point. He wants to make us like himself. He wants to reflect his being. &gt;&gt; And you know, what does that entail? You we look at the life of Christ and the fruits he bore. You know, we look at the prayer life that that Jesus had. He even had, you know, he was a busy guy, but he still Jesus God in flesh still had to separate himself from the world. He had to go up in a mountain. He had to get to himself because he he knew that there was such a an atmosphere in the world that you have to withdraw yourself from to be able to get into that place. And then you look at his ability, Jesus's ability to overcome with the word. And he wants us to possess those very very same things. The [snorts] very next thing the prophet talks about here, and I think it's on the next slide, is virtue. And I thought this was really powerful. He says um then after we lay the foundation secondly you add to your foundation. You add to your faith. First you have faith then you add you add virtue to your faith. This is the next column. Pour your foundation then to your faith add virtue. Now right there knocks a lot of us down. Yes sir. Yes. Add virtue to your faith. Now that doesn't mean living a virgin life you know like the woman or a man or so forth. That doesn't have anything to do with it. The Bible said, we read over there in the book of Luke where it said, "Virtue went out of him." That's right. If we're going to be like him, we must have virtue, then we must have it to be like him. Is the first song that I ever loved in the hymns, one of the greatest was to be like Jesus. Well, if I'm going to be like Jesus, I've got to have virtue and a pass that it can pass forward from me to the people. Because virtue went out of him to the people. Virtue. And before you can let it out, you've got to have it first. You haven't got it. It won't come out. There's nothing for it to come out of. Amen. And the next slide I think it is he says what if someone tried to draw virtue out of us and the check would return insufficient funds. See no none there to draw from that the check is bounce. And then he catch this here. He says somebody looking at and I spoke on this last time and this is kind of some of the notes that I that I wanted to get back to. He says somebody looking at you as a Christian and tomorrow seeing you out there carrying on like a sinner. There's not much virtue that can be drawn from that. See? Right. So, you know, we talked last time about the bear being bearers of fruit and how your life preaches a sermon and and your life is on display to the world. And if we're a uh if we're the type of people that are always trying to, you know, make excuses maybe to live life closer to the edge, you know, it can really show where we are spiritually. Um, you know, I don't I don't want to be like that. I want to live as close to the Lord as I can. And I want to have an excuse to do that. Amen. And just another simple analogy this morning, first Peter, he says, "Wherefore laying aside all malice and guile and hypocrisies and envys and evil speakings." So in that scripture, because the theme is is the maturing of sons and daughters this morning, right? So, but I wanted to stop and make a note on this verse cuz sometimes we don't even realize that we're stuck in a place because well, let me just read this. I wanted to It says laying aside all envys, you know. So, we're talking about growing and sometimes I think it's it's important to stop and appreciate where you are right now. I if you ever watch a baby that's drinking its milk, they are completely satisfied in what they're doing. You ever just see a baby, they want the milk and then once they have it, they're so content. They don't care about anything else. They don't care about any they don't care about tomorrow. They they don't have any uh anything else in their mind. They've got the milk. And sometimes I think we can get in these unhealthy habits of envying. You know, envying maybe where other people are. You know, envy is just being discontent with with yourself, being discontent with what we have. And you know, if you remember, you know, those that are married, you remember the honey honeymoon stage of marriage. Everything is fun, right? It's exciting. It's new. It's an adventure. And it's the same thing with our spiritual walk. There's this phase where we're drinking the pure milk of the word, right? Where everything is fresh and new and exciting. And [snorts] we have to remember to stop and enjoy the word that God is giving you in the season that you're in because we're all in different seasons. Amen. We're all in this. We're all growing into the fullness into the maturity that God wants us to be in. Amen. And we all may be in different stages. And that's okay. As long as you know you are where God wants you to be. Amen. So we have to always come back to that and say God are am I where you want me to be spiritually? Do I need maturity in my life? And whatever you want for me, Lord, help me to drink in that. Sometimes we're in a place where he's giving us the the the meat of revelation in our lives. But sometimes you're you need to be in a place where you're you need some simple things. The Lord is going to give you some milk because we're not going to be able to get these depths of revelation in our life if we're stumbling at simple areas, right? We're not going to be able to you want to have you want to soar into the depths of revelation, but what about the simple areas where God maybe is wanting to get you to get rid of this stumbling block in our in our lives or in our hearts? He wants to you can't you can't forget to enjoy the season that you're in and have discernment to know where you are spirit spiritually. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I used to think that it was um that that it would be some kind of a feeling of achievement when I would reach certain milestones. You know, maybe um when I would get to preach a certain number of years or or maybe being married a certain number of of years or, you know, h having my own home for a certain amount of time. And I think those things are well and good, but if you really dive into it, it's almost a form of envy if you're always looking to what's next &gt;&gt; because you're not ever enjoying where you are right now. If you're always if you're always looking down the road, what about right here right now? God is doing something in your life right here and right now. He wants to give you revelation in where you are at currently. And he will do that. But if you're always looking to the down the road now, we always, you know, there's you make sure that you're you're uh you have to have spiritual foresight. That's an important thing. You need to make sure that you are continuing to grow and continuing to mature. But if you're always looking down the road, you need to make sure to Lord, what are you doing in my life right now? Where where can I grow right now? I I I maybe I'm in a place where I need some some milk and I need you to feed it to me, Lord, because I don't even know where I'm at or what I'm doing. You know, I have this note here in in a few minutes, but Joy and I were talking about and there's this babies have this this uh reflex that if you give them too much food up to a certain age, if you give them a big too big of a bite or if you give them too much food, they actually have a natural reflex God gave them that where they'll spit that food out, right? Because they know that their bodies can't they don't know, but it's just a natural reflex. They'll spit it out. And the same thing happens in our life is, you know, maybe God is trying to give you a little bit of food and he knows you can't spiritually digest certain things yet. So, he's going to give you a little bit at a time. Amen. And so, enjoy what he's giving you and take in what he's giving you and then continue to progress and continue to move on. Amen. Um, and spiritually, you know, speaking, you can't can't skip the milk, [clears throat] right, and go right to the meat. [music] There's important nutrients. Um [music] the next verse in that in that verse that we read second Peter I believe it's the second chapter it says as newborn babies desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God does want us to grow into mature believers. He want he does want to unveil more of himself to us. But if you think about a little child, you know, you wouldn't want to give um I had just thought about this yesterday. You wouldn't want to give a, you know, a little child, especially that's one or, you know, one and a half, you wouldn't want to give them something sharp, right? Because they wouldn't know how to handle it. You give a baby knife because of what stage they're in, they're going to want to put it in their mouth and that you can't do that. They're going to they're going to harm themselves with the sharpness of that blade, right? But the wonderful thing about maturing is th those sharp objects. Once they can be handled properly, they serve a wonderful purpose, right? It's what we use to open things with packages and gifts. And as that little child develops, you begin to teach them how to handle sharp objects. And eventually, they'll be able to use it for themselves naturally, spiritually, when we're nurtured by the milk of God's word. And we can lay aside some of those immature behaviors. So there he talked about four or five specific things in that last verse. Um he's trying to rid us of those immature behaviors and maybe it's a little bit of envy towards our brother or our sister or you know envy is a form of discontent. Maybe discontent with where you are. Paul says being content finding myself to be content in whatever I have whether it's plenty or whether it's none. So making sure that we can lay aside that envy. Um or guile. Guile is another one that they mentioned which is when you try maybe try to deceive people or even maybe deceive yourself into thinking that you're further along than you really are. Maybe you need to step, you know, step back a little bit and say, "Lord, you know, I feel like I'm not progressing. Lord, is there something in my life that's displeasing to you because I want to continue to progress?" Now, that's an important question. Amen. Um the serpent, just for an example, the serpent used guile to deceive Eve, right? because there was a lot of truth in what he was saying but the intent was negative. Right? So that's another one. Or another one it would be these immature behaviors. Hypocrisy. And that's a big one. The practice of pretending to have moral standards, beliefs or principles that one does not actually possess. So someone who says one thing but then does another. Right? someone who says they love the Lord but maybe their their actions aren't proving that or maybe there's something you know there we don't want to be hypocrites nobody wants that right but sometimes you know we have to really search out our heart and if there is some form of that in your heart you know you're you're saying one thing but then your life is not lining up then what's missing here Lord help me to know what's missing so that I can continue to progress right amen see because God God looks at our and and he knows he knows we have a sinful nature, right? He knows that we're predisposed to immature things like that. But the point is &gt;&gt; because he knows that he has made a way to get past those things, right? Sometimes it just takes a little bit of humility, stepping down from our pride and saying, "Lord, well, I did I messed up or I said this or I did this. Lord, help me to to to move past that." Amen. Um, he knows what stage we're at and he knows what we can spiritually digest. Um, and and as he begins to as he begins to reveal things to us and as as we begin to to get more revelation in our lives, um, you know, something that maybe at one point in our spiritual walk, we couldn't exactly handle it like like that baby that couldn't handle the knife. Maybe we couldn't handle it or or we couldn't appreciate its full value. That's that's a better way to look at it. We couldn't appreciate the full value of a revelation that God is trying to give you in your life. But as you begin to progress and mature in your life, you begin to put value. Wow. Lord, thank you for showing me that. Lord, thank you for bringing me from this place that I saw that I had this maybe behavior or I saw that I had this guile or I saw that I had this hypocrisy. Thank you for showing that to me, Lord, and then correcting me of it. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Um, and God begins to see, just like you can't give the new baby strong meat, God begins to see that we're able to handle the word with more maturity, right? That we're able to yield our members a little bit more than we used to. And then God begins to give you more of his word. He begins to show you how to handle it properly and unwrap the word in your life. Amen. Um, so that begins to help us develop to this next stage that Peter talks about, brother Brandham talks about in the stature of a perfect man, which is godly knowledge, which I think this is probably I'm going to stop here in just a minute here, but um, this quote is so good. He says um, it might be on the slide. I'm not sure if I put this one up. Now there will be another thing on this knowledge that we might speak of godly knowledge. He has the Bible in the in this day lost its meaning. See a lot of people tell you that that the Bible doesn't exactly mean that. If God watches over me and corrects me in my life and if I'm a son of God he does that. He does you that way. Sons and daughters when you do anything wrong he corrects you right? Then if God is so particular about you and that he watches over you and corrects you, how much more has he his word which is your example which is himself. Amen. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God. He says and then made flesh and dwelt among us. The word is the revelation of Jesus Christ. Uh the Bible said so Christ being revealed in his word. And if he has watched over you when you transgress these laws, he condemns you for it. How much more has he watched over his law that condemns you? Amen. And he says, he says, I believe in genuine Holy Ghost knowledge. Holy Ghost knowledge will punctuate the word with amen. When you get these things that seem to contradict themselves in the Bible, you sit down and study it out and prayerfully like that. And the first thing you know, the Holy Spirit begins to move in. And after a while, you see it ties together. There you got it. See the knowledge. So that going into now this knowledge, this next this next spiritual building block. What does it mean to punctuate the word? That's the end of the slides. Thanks, brother. Uh what does it mean to punctuate the word with with an amen? It means that as the Lord reveals himself to you and he takes you through these seasons of growth and maturity, sometimes that means that he brings you into a place in your life or in your heart where maybe you've been doing or saying something wrong or maybe it's people that you've been associating with and the Holy Spirit begins to move and show you that it's time to leave those things behind, right? Because God wants to take you further. Amen. There's this quote and I don't have it here, but he said it says if there's a thirst for more of God, then there's got to be more of God to fulfill that thirst. Right? So, if there's a thirst for more of God in your life, he's an ever ex brother Jason says, he's an ever expounding God. You know, there's no way we could ever fully grasp him. So, there's always going to be more of God for you in your life. Amen. Um, [snorts] and he wants to take you further, but he'll never do that. He'll never he'll never he'll never continue to progress you if we're too stubborn to give up these things. Amen. So So punctuating the word with an amen happens when the Lord shows you the right steps to take, the right path to go down and you listen and you heed the word and then your life begins to slowly measure up to the word, right? Amen. We begin to start reflecting him. Like brother Benham said, we begin to start reflecting his life in our life. Um let's see. I just have another minute or two here. I'll just finish with this. He says, um, "Will you take that? Will you take us that's nothing but a wild gourd?" He says, "An notthead." See, there's nothing to us for we're dead in sin and trespasses. We're in all these kinds of condition. And then we oursel can prostrate ourselves, give ourselves up until God takes his transfusion tube, the name of Jesus Christ. And you actually there's a part of you that actually takes you you take part in this because prostrating means that we lay ourselves out on the ground face up and and in reverence or in submission. So we lay our we lay down those habits. We lay down our desires and then he says that the life of Christ transfers into us. Then we can have this kind of faith that Christ had. And he he makes this comment, Christ's faith was not based in those Pharisees or Sadducees or in their kettles and pots and pans and washings. And this contrast that he makes with the Pharisees, the faith that the Pharisees had was not a genuine faith because they didn't prostrate themselves. They had pride mingled in, right? They they knew everything. They they they had the law, but they couldn't be taught. And when when you prostrate yourselves, it's a sincere act of humility, an act of submission. But for them, it was a show. And Jesus discerned their heart in that. He discerned the the reality that was living in their hearts. It was works. It was the law of God, but it didn't have the spirit of God. And that's the vital thing is the spirit of God then makes the law manifest in your life. It lives in your members and then it's lived out through our lives. Because what happened with them is is they had the law and they tried to live it themselves without the spirit bringing forth the law. And if you do it that way, and a lot of times people can get in that way, they get they live it as a church member and they they see the message and they they can say it intellectually, oh, that makes sense. But unless they get that person living on the inside of their soul that can actually live out of them, then then they're doing it the way of a Pharisee would do it. And we'd never want to live like a Pharisee would. Amen. All right, let's pray. Heavenly Father, we just want to thank you for the uh just this little lesson this morning. We just pray that you just be with the musicians as they come out. Lord, may your spirit just come and speak to our hearts and Lord, just uh help us today. We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
