[32:50] trying to get my mind around the thought
[32:52] for this evening and and walking the
[32:55] floors literally because I I I walk and
[32:57] preach to myself and and I do a lot of
[33:00] thinking while I'm walking. Sister
[33:01] Debbie sees me just going in circles.
[33:03] she knows, okay, he's preaching.
[33:05] And so, um, we're I I just, uh, have
[33:09] just been thrilled with it. I got up
[33:10] this evening and just when it was time,
[33:12] I finally had to go get ready and I
[33:15] said, "My goodness, it's just so big.
[33:16] It's so It's so vast. You just can
[33:19] hardly take it all in." But we're going
[33:21] to do a fly over today at about 50,000
[33:24] ft. Amen. So, you can get a good view of
[33:26] it. Amen. Lot a lot of times you have to
[33:28] do that. You if you're if you're on the
[33:30] ground, you can't really see everything.
[33:32] You got to get some high altitude where
[33:34] eagles soar and then you you begin to
[33:36] bring it into perspective. So the whole
[33:39] purpose of it is is not to fill our head
[33:41] full of mystery knowledge, but it's so
[33:44] that we see our part in it. So that we
[33:46] recognize our day and its message, so
[33:49] that we recognize modern events made
[33:51] clear.
[33:52] So that you know what's going on. Hey,
[33:54] you know, you know what that's a an
[33:56] elixir for? You know what that's a
[33:57] remedy for? That's a remedy. That's a uh
[34:01] that's an actual working vaccination
[34:04] that actually works and won't kill you
[34:07] and harm you. Uh and it'll keep your
[34:10] heart from failing for fear. Because at
[34:12] the end time, part of the plague under
[34:14] the seventh vial is that men's hearts
[34:17] fail for fear for the things coming on
[34:19] the earth because they don't know what's
[34:20] happening. And it looks very scary and
[34:22] very ominous. But uh when you can when
[34:25] you can see all the moving parts and
[34:27] know what connects to what and know why,
[34:30] not just know the what, but know the why
[34:32] behind it and what it's going to come
[34:34] to. Boy, it is it is joy unspeakable and
[34:37] full of glory. Cuz it all ends great for
[34:39] us.
[34:40] Amen.
[34:41] I just tell you friends, I've said it
[34:43] before, your future is so bright.
[34:47] Oh, it's bright. It's bright. My
[34:49] goodness. Amen. So let's begin in
[34:52] Revelation uh chapter 6 and verse 5.
[34:58] And when he had opened the third seal,
[35:01] I heard the third beast say, "Come and
[35:04] see.
[35:05] And I beheld, and lo, a black horse, and
[35:07] he that sat on him had a pair of
[35:09] balances in his hand. And I heard the
[35:12] voice in the midst of the fourth of the
[35:14] four beasts say, "A measure of wheat for
[35:18] a penny, and three measures of barley
[35:20] for a penny, and see thou hurt not the
[35:23] oil and the wine."
[35:26] Verse seven. And when he had opened the
[35:28] fourth seal, I heard the voice of the
[35:31] fourth beast say, "Come and see." And I
[35:35] looked, and behold, a pale horse, and
[35:38] his name that sat on him was death, and
[35:40] hell followed with him. And power was
[35:43] given unto him uh was given unto them
[35:47] over the fourth part of the earth to
[35:50] kill with sword, and with hunger, and
[35:53] with death, and with the beast of the
[35:56] earth. Um, I think I'm going to jump you
[36:00] over to chapter nine.
[36:08] Uh we'll begin in chapter 8 verse 12.
[36:13] And the fourth angel sounded
[36:15] and the third this is the the trumpet
[36:18] trumpets. And the fourth angel sounded
[36:21] and the third part of the sun was
[36:23] smitten. Now let me just stop and say
[36:25] this.
[36:27] The reason I'm reading I read the third
[36:30] and the fourth seal is because that
[36:35] encapsulates what was happening in the
[36:37] seals of the history we've been talking
[36:40] about. All right. And then if we would
[36:43] go into the church ages, which I'm not
[36:46] I'm trying to not not read you to death
[36:48] tonight. We'll get that on Sunday. Um,
[36:50] but you're going to see that we're we're
[36:54] that third and fourth seal are
[36:56] operational
[36:58] during as the sixth church age is coming
[37:02] to a close getting ready to move into
[37:04] the seventh church age. And as the sixth
[37:06] is handing to the seventh, that se th
[37:09] those seals are beginning to move toward
[37:13] from a black horse to a pale horse.
[37:17] Amen. All right. and the the living
[37:20] creature is going from a man age to an
[37:22] eagle age. Now, while all of that is
[37:26] happening in the gentile world, trumpets
[37:30] are sounding and corresponding vials are
[37:33] partially opening around the world and
[37:36] it's controlling history. And it's all
[37:39] happening synchronously, simultaneously,
[37:42] in concert. And brother Brandham said
[37:45] it's all it all happens in a cluster.
[37:49] So you're going to hear me say just in a
[37:51] minute in a few minutes how that all of
[37:54] these moving parts start coming together
[37:57] and prophecy which is driving history
[38:01] starts ramping up and things get really
[38:03] fast.
[38:04] Amen.
[38:04] Amen. So tonight, I'm here to tell you
[38:08] that the midnight cry has already went
[38:10] forward
[38:12] and the rapture cycle has already begun.
[38:15] Amen.
[38:16] And we're not waiting on the we're not
[38:19] we're where
[38:21] boy
[38:23] the I'm going to show you that we've had
[38:26] the ministry of the morning star and the
[38:29] ministry of the capstone.
[38:30] Yeah.
[38:31] All right. Now we're it's still
[38:32] unfolding. So, when we say we're waiting
[38:35] on it, we're already in it. It's like
[38:37] the rapture. We're waiting on it, but
[38:38] we're already in it because it's a
[38:40] cycle. I'm already preaching. I haven't
[38:42] even read my You see where I've been all
[38:44] day.
[38:45] Oh, Lord, help me. All right. Now, so I
[38:48] just wanted to say that so that you
[38:50] know, we got a lot of moving parts. And
[38:53] I'm going to try to draw you out some
[38:55] word pictures tonight rather than use
[38:56] diagrams. Uh because I that's kind of
[38:59] how my gift works. I can explain things
[39:01] to where you catch a picture of it. All
[39:03] right. So, let's let's look at the
[39:05] fourth trumpet again because this fourth
[39:08] trumpet with its corresponding vial
[39:12] is is the the trumpet part is happening
[39:15] in history
[39:17] long around the end of the 1900s, the
[39:21] 19th century getting ready to cross into
[39:23] the 20th century and the corresponding
[39:25] vial partially breaks because a vial
[39:28] broke in every age partially.
[39:30] All right. All right. So, so now the
[39:33] fourth trumpet. Now, you're starting
[39:34] back in the late uh 1800s of that's the
[39:39] latter part of the 19th century, the
[39:40] late 1800s, and you're getting ready.
[39:42] You're headed toward uh the year um
[39:46] you're you're leaving the 1800s going
[39:48] into the 1900s. And that's why Isuza was
[39:50] 1906. All right. All right. Let me just
[39:53] keep reading.
[39:55] And the fourth angel sounded, and the
[39:57] third part of the sun was smitten, and
[39:59] the third part of the moon, and the
[40:02] third part of the stars, so as the third
[40:05] part of them was darkened, and the day
[40:07] shone not for a third part of it, and
[40:10] the night likewise. Let me give you a
[40:12] little tidbit. This whole business of a
[40:14] third part, a third part, a third part
[40:15] just simply means it's temporary, right?
[40:18] All right. And I beheld and heard an
[40:21] angel flying through the midst of heaven
[40:23] saying with a loud voice, "Wo, wo, wo to
[40:27] the inhabitors of the earth by reason of
[40:30] the other voices of the trumpet of the
[40:32] three angels," this is 5, six, and 7,
[40:35] which are yet to sound. Chapter nine.
[40:38] And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a
[40:41] star fall from heaven unto the earth.
[40:44] And to him was given the key of the
[40:46] bottomless pit. And he opened the
[40:48] bottomless pit. And there arose a smoke
[40:49] out of the pit as the smoke of a great
[40:52] furnace. And the sun and the air were
[40:54] darkened by reason of the smoke of the
[40:56] pit. And there came out of the smoke
[40:58] locust upon the earth. And unto them was
[41:01] given power as the scorpions of the
[41:03] earth have power. And it was commanded
[41:05] that they should not hurt the grass of
[41:07] the earth, neither any green thing,
[41:09] neither any tree, but only those men
[41:10] which have not the seal of God in their
[41:12] foreheads. And to them it was given that
[41:14] they should not kill them, but that they
[41:16] should be tormented five months. And
[41:18] their torment was as the torment of the
[41:20] scorpion when he striketh a man. And in
[41:23] those days shall men seek death, and
[41:26] shall not find it, and shall desire to
[41:28] die, and death shall flee from them. And
[41:30] the shapes of the locust were like unto
[41:33] horses, prepared unto battle. And on
[41:35] their heads were as it were crowns like
[41:38] gold, and their faces were as the faces
[41:40] of men. And they had hair as the hair of
[41:43] women, and their teeth were as the teeth
[41:46] of lions, and they had breastplates as
[41:48] it were ble breastplates of iron. And
[41:50] the sound of their wings was as the
[41:52] sound of chariots, of many horses
[41:55] running to battle.
[41:57] Wow. Wow. Wow. So, we're starting to
[41:59] ramp up the woes. And World War I is is
[42:01] is is beginning to it's beginning to
[42:04] move toward World War I under the first
[42:06] woe. And they had tails like unto
[42:09] scorpions, and their stings were in
[42:10] their tails. And their power was to hurt
[42:12] men five months. And they had a king
[42:14] over them, which is the angel of the
[42:16] bottomless pit, whose name in the in the
[42:18] Hebrew tongue is a bad, but in the Greek
[42:21] tongue hath his name Apolon. One woe is
[42:24] passed, and behold, there come two woes
[42:27] more hereafter.
[42:29] Man, we just we just we just shot over
[42:32] about the last 50 years of the 1800s,
[42:34] jumped into the 1900s, into the 20th
[42:37] century, and went all the way to World
[42:39] War I and through World War I and out
[42:41] the other side of it.
[42:42] And you did that in a matter of verses.
[42:44] All right, we better pray.
[42:47] Lord, I thank you for your word. I thank
[42:51] you for the vision that we have in this
[42:53] day. And Lord, it's just a it's nothing.
[42:56] We would have nothing to say. We would
[42:58] be just as confused as the rest of the
[43:00] world were it not for a vindicated voice
[43:03] that came and you spoke through that
[43:06] voice and put all the pieces together
[43:08] and they fit. My goodness, they fit like
[43:11] a mosaic. They fit so beautiful, Lord.
[43:14] And I get swept away by it and I just
[43:16] ask for your help now as we look at
[43:19] these things because we're not you're
[43:20] not here just to entertain us or fill us
[43:22] with facts. We want to see the
[43:25] application of what does this mean to
[43:27] me? What should I be looking for? Uh how
[43:31] should what should my perspective? What
[43:33] should my world view be knowing these
[43:36] things? I pray that you will help us to
[43:38] see the urgency of the hour. We've only
[43:40] got a short amount of time here on a
[43:42] Wednesday night. We can't take too much
[43:44] on. So Lord, I'm praying for your your
[43:47] mind that I can be efficient to get out
[43:50] what we need and position ourselves for
[43:52] the weekend. and we commit it to you in
[43:54] Jesus name. Amen. God bless you,
[43:56] friends. You can be seated. And I won't
[43:58] wear you tonight. Um we're we're going
[44:01] to go for just a little bit of time and
[44:04] I I really um if the Lord the Lord being
[44:08] my helper, I probably just have
[44:12] I'm going to take you through the
[44:13] sequence of things, but I I really only
[44:16] have one major point that I wish to
[44:19] make. All right.
[44:24] Thank you, sir.
[44:26] All right. Now, intentionally,
[44:30] I again, I didn't put up any quotes. Uh,
[44:33] I'm going to read I'm going to read slow
[44:35] and I'm going to stop and catch you up
[44:38] to my thinking as we go along because I
[44:40] want to keep you in the mix. All right?
[44:41] Is that good?
[44:43] All right. So, brother Brandham comes to
[44:45] the first seal and now he's he says now
[44:49] the lamb in the time of intercessory
[44:52] back there he knew that there were names
[44:56] in there that was put in there from the
[44:59] foundation of the world and as long as
[45:02] them names had never been manifested on
[45:05] earth as yet he had to stay there as
[45:08] intercessor. Do you get it? Perfectly
[45:11] predestination. See? All right. Now,
[45:13] that that's the first point that I want
[45:16] to really get etched in your mind. Don't
[45:18] let anyone ever change it. The lamb has
[45:21] to stay in his intercessory role until
[45:23] he fills up the role.
[45:25] Amen. until all the names uh that were
[45:28] in the in that in that section of
[45:31] election in the lamb's book of life
[45:34] until all of those names are redeemed
[45:37] back to God in Christ then he he will
[45:40] always stay in heaven as that
[45:44] interceding lamb
[45:46] all right
[45:47] now that now let me say this because
[45:50] you're going to need this that does not
[45:52] at all stop him from working in the the
[45:55] earth,
[45:56] right? Amen.
[45:57] As long as you know how he's working. Is
[45:59] he here corporally? He is not.
[46:03] The lamb is in heaven interceding.
[46:05] He's not here in his corporal body. And
[46:08] in fact is even in the rapture, his feet
[46:11] don't actually touch the earth. He
[46:13] descends down and we move up and we meet
[46:16] in the air.
[46:17] Amen.
[46:17] The correlation of that is seen in type
[46:20] uh with Isaac and Rebecca. She came from
[46:23] her home. He left his home and they met
[46:26] in the field. All right.
[46:28] So then he actually doesn't put his feet
[46:30] on the earth until after he's taken a
[46:33] bride up. We go for three and a half
[46:35] years to a wedding supper, a table
[46:37] thousands of miles long. I told your
[46:39] future was bright. You don't have to
[46:41] worry about calories. You don't have to
[46:43] worry about carbs. You can just eat
[46:44] whatever you want, as much as you want,
[46:47] because your glorified, perfect body
[46:48] will will just do it.
[46:51] Hallelujah.
[46:54] So, even chocolate will be be good for
[46:56] you.
[46:58] Amen. Praise the Lord. I don't know if
[47:01] they'll have chocolate, but I hope so.
[47:04] So, so, so we I don't know why they
[47:07] wouldn't. It's made from elements of the
[47:09] earth. So, let's hope let's hope for the
[47:11] best. Let's hope for a smorgus board of
[47:14] a whole section of the table that's
[47:16] various chocolates.
[47:19] I can hear brother Donnie saying, "Amen,
[47:21] brother."
[47:22] Amen. and he's a choahholic.
[47:24] And so, um, he admits to that publicly.
[47:27] So, so we realize then that while we're
[47:31] there, uh, 42 months, the earth is going
[47:34] through what the Bible refers to as
[47:36] Jacob's trouble. It's a tribulation
[47:39] period like the world has never seen.
[47:41] It's had a lot of tribulation, but it's
[47:43] never seen a tribulation like that. And
[47:45] so then when we come back on the back
[47:48] side of that, and I'm not going into
[47:49] that this evening, but that's when
[47:52] Christ rides out, the armies of heaven
[47:54] follow with him, which is his bride. And
[47:56] that's when the scripture is fulfilled.
[47:58] All the eyes of them see him. See,
[48:01] that's people think, theologians think
[48:03] that's the rapture. But the rapture is a
[48:06] secret catching away. He comes like a
[48:09] thief in the night and he takes her and
[48:10] steals away. See, but when that happens,
[48:14] all eyes will see him. And when they see
[48:17] him, no, no one's really happy.
[48:22] And you can imagine why. Because they've
[48:24] they've martyed the foolish virgin.
[48:27] And they've put to death Moses and
[48:30] Elijah. And the 144,000 are slain.
[48:33] And now here comes God.
[48:36] Nobody's happy.
[48:38] And the Bible says that they cry out and
[48:40] woe and it's and it's and it's alarm
[48:43] because they, you know, brother Brandham
[48:45] talks about how that when Jesus came
[48:50] actually stepped out that that validated
[48:53] that John was in fact Elijah,
[48:57] right? Amen.
[48:58] They thought he was Elijah. Now he
[49:00] denied that. He said, "No, are you are
[49:03] you that prophet or are you this
[49:04] prophet?" No, no, no. Who are you? the
[49:06] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[49:08] which was a veiled way of saying because
[49:10] that's the ministry that Elijah would
[49:12] have part of his ministry would be that
[49:14] crying in the wilderness preparing
[49:16] preparing the way for the Lord but but
[49:19] no one could prove that he was no one
[49:23] was re absolutely required to believe it
[49:26] until Jesus actually came and there he
[49:30] was and behold the lamb of God and
[49:33] John's ministry was validated ated by
[49:36] the first coming of Christ onto the
[49:38] scene.
[49:39] Amen. Amen.
[49:40] All right. And so, Brother Brandham says
[49:42] the exact same way in the church age
[49:44] book, the exact same way, the Elijah of
[49:47] this day will be proven to the world at
[49:50] the coming of the Lord. Now, they the
[49:53] rapture won't necessarily do it except
[49:55] for the people who know about it.
[49:58] people who are taught that this have
[50:02] been taught but have rejected that this
[50:04] message is the message of the hour when
[50:06] we leave. I imagine they'll know but the
[50:10] whole world won't know. They the whole
[50:12] world won't even know we're gone.
[50:15] And and I I just I I I
[50:19] dread to imagine what must be happening
[50:22] in the earth that they don't know a
[50:25] global bride has left the scene.
[50:27] Amen. and what chaos must be happening,
[50:30] what mayhem and death must be going on
[50:32] for for somebody to say, "Hey, there's
[50:35] there's there's this many, you know,
[50:37] people missing." And they're going to
[50:38] go, "Yeah, no kidding."
[50:40] And so you say, "Do is it going to be
[50:42] California? Is it going to be this? Is
[50:43] it going to be that?" Well, uh, I would
[50:45] like to say we'll see. And we will, but
[50:47] I won't be here to see it.
[50:50] I'll be in another dimension.
[50:52] Thank God.
[50:53] Amen.
[50:55] But it will when when God when Christ
[50:57] comes back and the bride comes back with
[51:00] him which will include all the seven
[51:03] messengers
[51:04] then the world that denied they were the
[51:07] seven messengers because all me seven
[51:09] messengers were denied that they were
[51:10] the seven
[51:11] by the people of their age. They didn't
[51:13] believe them in mass. They didn't
[51:14] believe them. Only a very few elected
[51:17] actually believe the messengers. And so
[51:20] it's going to become very clear because
[51:23] they're they're they're with the king.
[51:25] Wow, these guys really were the real
[51:28] deal.
[51:29] And we've missed it and it's too late
[51:32] for us and they won't be wrong.
[51:35] Amen.
[51:36] So, so we realize then that that that
[51:41] you want you've got to realize that
[51:42] until that last name on the role is
[51:46] called. Now, I just I I want to
[51:50] underline this. I really want you to
[51:52] absorb it because I'm about to read some
[51:54] quotes that'll make you going to you're
[51:55] almost going to go, "Wait, what? I
[51:57] thought you uh that seems
[51:59] contradictory." Hang on. Brother Brandon
[52:01] makes it clear as he goes along.
[52:04] So the the lamb must stay as an
[52:08] intercessor until he says all those
[52:11] names from the foundation of the world
[52:13] as long as them names has never been
[52:14] manifested on earth as yet uh he has to
[52:17] stay there as intercessor until he until
[52:21] the Holy Spirit draws them reveals
[52:24] himself. They are they're come to the
[52:27] atonement of Christ and they are lifted
[52:30] up from sin and filled with the Holy
[52:33] Ghost. I mean, I I it would not surprise
[52:36] me and I would even I would even almost
[52:38] go as far as to say that we might I
[52:42] mean, it's altogether possible that the
[52:44] that the last seed that's going to go is
[52:48] already walking the earth.
[52:50] Amen.
[52:50] See, you say, well, what about, you
[52:52] know, hey, hold on. We got sisters that
[52:54] might have some babies. All babies go to
[52:56] heaven regardless.
[52:57] So, we're not even we're not even
[52:58] worried about that. We're talking about
[53:00] those who who are going to come to the
[53:02] age of accountability and uh and God is
[53:05] going to deal with them. I believe that
[53:06] they I you know, are Moses and Elijah on
[53:08] the earth? Maybe.
[53:11] Are they the literal? Uh well, if they
[53:13] are, then they're probably not on the
[53:14] earth, but if they're not, if they're
[53:16] men with that spirit, they might be.
[53:19] Could it be that they wouldn't know it?
[53:21] It could be. Brother Brandham didn't
[53:23] know
[53:23] that he was Malachi 4.
[53:26] Amen. See, he knew what he was told on
[53:29] the river.
[53:31] But that's as far as it went because
[53:33] that ministry had not come upon him
[53:35] until the opening of the seals.
[53:38] All right. So, we go on now. We We're
[53:40] going to move a little a little further.
[53:41] I'm going to really watch my time
[53:43] carefully.
[53:45] So, he has to stay there as intercessor.
[53:47] Do you get it? And he says, "Perfectly
[53:49] predestination." See? All right. First
[53:52] seal. Now he had to stay there
[53:57] because he came to die for those that
[54:00] God had ordained to life. Say well so so
[54:05] there only only
[54:08] the ordained
[54:10] are going to receive life. Of course
[54:14] only the ordained are going to believe
[54:16] the word.
[54:17] Amen.
[54:18] We're talking about redemption now. That
[54:20] doesn't that doesn't do away with the
[54:21] fact that God's going to grant a whole
[54:23] lot of people eternal life.
[54:25] The foolish virgin are going to be
[54:26] granted people who just for kindness to
[54:28] the bride will be granted eternal life.
[54:30] God's going to judge them by their heart
[54:32] response to the word at whatever level
[54:34] uh whatever level. I mean, he might have
[54:35] just revealed himself to him and it
[54:37] might have been some Native American 200
[54:40] years ago and God just revealed himself
[54:42] in nature and the and the native didn't
[54:45] really understand who God had never
[54:46] heard about Jesus, but he knew there was
[54:48] a great spirit and he worshiped him
[54:51] and he he cooperated with nature because
[54:54] nature was built by the word of God. So
[54:57] when you cooperate with nature and
[54:59] you're you're
[55:00] remember he's going to destroy those who
[55:02] destroy the earth. Yeah.
[55:04] And see, brother Brandham goes back and
[55:06] talks about how that it was the rascal
[55:08] of the white man who come in with his
[55:10] sharp sharps rifle, his buffalo rifle.
[55:13] And he said, "But the the Native
[55:15] American, he ate used the hide, the
[55:17] hooves, the inards, the guts, the meat,
[55:20] the everything. Nothing was wasted." I'm
[55:22] going to tell you something. God honors
[55:24] that.
[55:26] See?
[55:27] Amen. So all and all heathens will be
[55:30] raised up in the millennium who never
[55:32] had a chance at the gospel. So listen
[55:35] friends, we're not here to we're not
[55:37] here to put all that together. I may get
[55:39] to that when we get further down the
[55:41] road because we want to look at future
[55:43] events made clear in prophecy.
[55:45] So So he So now we're we're talking
[55:48] bring oursel back to those who are
[55:51] ordained, those whose names are in the
[55:52] lamb's book of life in the section of
[55:54] election. And and you say, "Well," and
[55:57] you've heard me use this analogy. If you
[55:59] ever get pinned with this and somebody
[56:01] says, "Well, John 3:16 says, "Whosoever
[56:05] will." Just go ahead and say, "Amen."
[56:08] Amen.
[56:09] Because John 3:16 doesn't say that
[56:11] anyone will.
[56:14] It doesn't say who will or even that
[56:16] anyone will.
[56:17] It just says whosoever will.
[56:20] So, the only way to answer, well, then
[56:23] are there is there going to be people
[56:24] who will? Yes. Who will believe? You go
[56:28] to the book of Acts and the Bible says
[56:30] as many as were ordained believed.
[56:34] Amen.
[56:35] See, so you can try all you want. You
[56:38] can't trip up the scripture. Not once
[56:39] you have not once the word is open to
[56:41] you.
[56:42] Amen.
[56:43] So he says he came to die for those that
[56:46] God had ordained to eternal life. By his
[56:48] fornowledge he saw them. Now watch this
[56:51] and I and I gotta I gotta read it all
[56:54] and then explain it. He saw them. Okay,
[56:57] by his fornowledge he saw them not and
[57:00] he makes this point not by his own will.
[57:05] Now what he's doing is he's eliminating
[57:08] God showing favoritism.
[57:10] It's not that God stood at the beginning
[57:13] of time and said, "I like you and you,
[57:15] but I don't like you." Yeah, you're
[57:16] okay. Come on, you can go. Uh, no. Uh,
[57:18] no. No, no. Uh, yes. Uh yeah. Okay. Uh
[57:21] no it it's not like that. It's not it's
[57:24] not about that. Brother Brandham
[57:25] clarifies it. He says his will
[57:29] was that none should perish.
[57:32] He his fornowledge he knows they will
[57:35] perish but his will was that none should
[57:37] perish. He doesn't take de pleasure in
[57:40] the death of even the sinner. See, and
[57:43] so brother Brandham says, "So it's not
[57:45] by his own will, but by his fornowledge
[57:48] he knew who would and and who would
[57:52] not." So it's more uh let let me say it
[57:56] like this. It's it's more
[57:59] than that God won't let them perish.
[58:03] Those names on the Lamb's book of life
[58:07] in the section of election. It's not
[58:10] about God's will saying he won't let me
[58:13] perish. You can't perish.
[58:17] Amen.
[58:18] You understand? It's not because because
[58:21] if it's God's will, then maybe you might
[58:23] make him mad by your constant failures
[58:25] and it won't be his will anymore.
[58:28] It was never his will. His will is that
[58:31] everybody makes it. But election is
[58:34] something beyond that. because I can no
[58:37] more perish than God can perish because
[58:40] I'm a part of God. And that's how we
[58:43] understand election is by origin. So I
[58:46] came from God. I can say like Jesus, I
[58:50] came from God and I go back to God. Oh,
[58:53] hear me friends. There simply are not
[58:56] enough devils in all the world to stop
[59:00] that.
[59:01] Hallelujah.
[59:02] That burns Satan. My that burns him cuz
[59:06] he's never been able to stop that seed
[59:10] line of Christ.
[59:11] Amen.
[59:12] Amen.
[59:16] So he says, "Therefore,
[59:18] as long as there was one name that had
[59:21] never been declared in earth, Christ had
[59:24] to stay there as an intercessor
[59:28] to take care of that name." Even Even
[59:31] one, he's just it's singular. that name,
[59:33] that last name. All right.
[59:36] But as soon as that final name has been
[59:40] splashed in the Clorox or bleach, the
[59:43] blood of Christ, right?
[59:45] Um, I keep losing my place here. All
[59:48] right, then.
[59:50] Boy, this contraption.
[59:53] All right. Thank you. Some kind of a
[59:55] glitch. Don't know what it is, but we
[59:58] ain't going to worry about it.
[1:00:01] Amen. I will close it down and preach it
[1:00:03] from my heart anyway if I need to.
[1:00:07] So he says, "Therefore,
[1:00:09] as long as there was one name that had
[1:00:11] never been declared in the earth, Christ
[1:00:13] has to stay there as an intercessor to
[1:00:15] take care of that name. But as soon as
[1:00:17] that final name has been splashed in the
[1:00:19] Clorox or bleached, then his
[1:00:20] intercessory days was over. Let him
[1:00:22] that's filthy be filthy still. Let him
[1:00:24] that's holy be holy still." And he
[1:00:27] leaves the sanctuary. And then it
[1:00:29] becomes a judgment seat. Woe to those
[1:00:32] outside of Christ then. So that's why
[1:00:35] that was where the con the the problem
[1:00:37] when they asked brother Brandon because
[1:00:39] it sound like he was saying that the
[1:00:40] foolish virgin are saved in the in the
[1:00:43] tribulation but yet he was but they knew
[1:00:45] the Bible said that when the bride goes
[1:00:47] up let him that's filthy be filthy
[1:00:49] still. And brother Brandamus told them
[1:00:51] see no one can be saved when the bride
[1:00:53] is gone. So they write him a question.
[1:00:55] Brother Bill, we thought you taught that
[1:00:57] in the tribulation no one could be
[1:00:58] saved, but it seems like you were saying
[1:01:00] that that the foolish virgin are saved.
[1:01:02] And brother Brandham answers the
[1:01:03] question very honestly and he says, "Now
[1:01:06] the confusion comes from what I've
[1:01:08] taught about the foolish virgin being
[1:01:10] saved in the tribulation." He says,
[1:01:12] "They're not saved. They're already
[1:01:16] saved
[1:01:17] from destruction."
[1:01:19] See, they're but they're not born again.
[1:01:23] And the proof of that is that they go
[1:01:25] into the tribulation
[1:01:27] and they have to give their lives. They
[1:01:29] have to give their own blood because
[1:01:31] they rejected the blood, the atonement
[1:01:33] blood of Christ that bled and died for
[1:01:35] them. And they did that by rejecting the
[1:01:38] word of the hour which was a bleeding
[1:01:40] word
[1:01:41] because no one has access to the actual
[1:01:43] blood. And it's irrelevant anyway.
[1:01:45] The the chemistry ran down the cross and
[1:01:48] did its last job. It claimed the earth.
[1:01:50] But it's not the chemistry of the blood
[1:01:52] that comes upon you. No one's got a
[1:01:54] charger of it. No one's If you did find
[1:01:57] a charger full of the blood of Christ,
[1:01:59] you would have more value than the blood
[1:02:02] because he gave that blood to save you.
[1:02:04] You just one person. It would be more
[1:02:06] value to God than a whole charger full
[1:02:08] of the blood of Jesus.
[1:02:10] Amen.
[1:02:11] Because it's the life that was in the
[1:02:13] blood that came back on the church. He
[1:02:15] didn't sprinkle anybody with blood. Yes,
[1:02:17] we're saved by the blood. We're saved by
[1:02:19] faith. it by grace through through
[1:02:22] faith.
[1:02:23] And it and it's the blood that keeps us
[1:02:25] because why? How does the blood keep
[1:02:27] you? Because it's a bleeding word that
[1:02:29] washes you constantly. Washes your mind
[1:02:32] and washes your spirit. And we are kept
[1:02:35] by the bleeding word.
[1:02:37] No wonder. Be you a gene of God. Be you
[1:02:40] a Christian. Be born again of the Holy
[1:02:42] Spirit. But feed on the world and don't
[1:02:44] feed on the word and you'll get become a
[1:02:46] very sticky Christian. Amen.
[1:02:50] Amen.
[1:02:51] You'll deal with pride and unforgiveness
[1:02:53] and anger and temper and malice and
[1:02:55] jealousy. Satan will get you with
[1:02:57] fleshly lust and temptations because
[1:03:00] why? You eat and drink the poisons of
[1:03:02] Leodysa and you don't constantly get in
[1:03:04] the antidote.
[1:03:06] You're already going to contact the
[1:03:08] world unavoidably. It's already going to
[1:03:10] contaminate you. It's a good thing
[1:03:12] you're here tonight. Everybody should be
[1:03:14] here to hear the preaching of the word.
[1:03:18] Amen.
[1:03:19] See?
[1:03:21] So, all right.
[1:03:26] So, so he says they're already saved.
[1:03:29] They're not saved in tribulation.
[1:03:30] They're already saved, but they're not
[1:03:32] born again. They go through the
[1:03:33] tribulation to be purged of their sin of
[1:03:35] unbelief and rejecting the message. But
[1:03:38] they're good people. The king calls them
[1:03:39] righteous people. The Bible calls them
[1:03:42] in the book of Revelation saints. Saints
[1:03:43] means sanctified one.
[1:03:45] So we so we realize then that that many
[1:03:49] are saved from from eternal destruction.
[1:03:52] They have accepted the atonement of
[1:03:53] Christ in in every way they knew. Uh but
[1:03:56] that's that's not election. That's not
[1:03:58] the redeemed. That's next level. The
[1:04:00] redeemed are next level. They're in the
[1:04:02] election. They're part of the offspring
[1:04:04] of almighty God.
[1:04:05] Amen.
[1:04:07] So So he says now he leaves the
[1:04:10] sanctuary and then it becomes a judgment
[1:04:12] seat. Woe to those outside of Christ.
[1:04:14] Now notice, but it's to be revealed when
[1:04:18] the lamb leaves his intercessory place
[1:04:22] from the father. Now, brother Ram says,
[1:04:25] "No, that's revelation five."
[1:04:28] Okay, now I'm jammed because
[1:04:32] that means if the seals have been
[1:04:34] opened, then there's no more mercy
[1:04:37] because it's to be revealed when the
[1:04:39] lamb leaves. The seals are to be
[1:04:42] revealed when the lamb leaves his
[1:04:44] intercessory place.
[1:04:46] And the lamb revealed the seals to us in
[1:04:50] 1963.
[1:04:52] So, you can see why certain camps ran
[1:04:55] forward saying there's no more mercy.
[1:04:57] I'm glad they were wrong.
[1:05:01] I'm glad they were wrong. I was born in
[1:05:03] ' 63, but I didn't give my heart to the
[1:05:05] Lord for many years afterward. I don't
[1:05:07] know if any of us in here except maybe
[1:05:09] some of the the eldest among us, Sister
[1:05:11] Jean, by by 1963 was already a believer.
[1:05:15] But I'm here to tell you, I'd like to go
[1:05:16] in the rapture with her.
[1:05:23] So now we're going to come down
[1:05:26] and we're going to
[1:05:29] show you
[1:05:31] how how is this working? Is there mercy
[1:05:34] or is there not mercy? Because if the if
[1:05:37] the seals are open, then he's left the
[1:05:39] intercessory, the the the it goes smoky.
[1:05:43] He's walked forward from the eternities.
[1:05:45] He was back there interceding. He
[1:05:46] stepped forward, took the book, loose
[1:05:48] the seals. And here is where you've got
[1:05:52] to understand brother Brandham's
[1:05:54] language. And he makes it so very clear.
[1:05:58] All right? And we'll get to it in a
[1:06:00] moment. Let me keep reading.
[1:06:02] So now he takes the books sealed with
[1:06:04] seven seals, breaks them and shows them.
[1:06:06] Look at the end of the age. Now after
[1:06:09] the intercessory is over, the church
[1:06:11] ages has done finished up. He come in
[1:06:13] the first age, Ephesian age, revealed,
[1:06:15] sent the messenger. Notice what happened
[1:06:17] as we go along. Now he's he's projecting
[1:06:20] forward to the bride is gone and the
[1:06:22] whole thing is done. All right. Now he's
[1:06:24] going to backpedal and go back and and
[1:06:26] walk it through and show you how it all
[1:06:28] unfolded in the ages. So he says,
[1:06:30] "Here's the plan of it." All right. This
[1:06:32] is what happened in every age with a
[1:06:35] messenger and a message. All right? And
[1:06:37] I ordained people to believe it. All
[1:06:39] right?
[1:06:41] Here's the Now notice what happens as we
[1:06:43] go along. Here's the plan of it. The
[1:06:45] first thing happens. There is an
[1:06:47] announcement in the heavens. First, what
[1:06:49] happens? A seal is open. What is it? A
[1:06:52] mystery is unfolded. See? And when a
[1:06:54] mystery unfolds, then a trumpet sounds.
[1:06:56] It declares a war. a plague falls which
[1:06:59] is that vial. Now
[1:07:02] understand this friends that just
[1:07:05] because at the end when the seal the
[1:07:09] when the when the mysteries of God were
[1:07:11] unsealed to us and we looked back and
[1:07:14] knew what the first we know what the
[1:07:17] first seal was. It's already history.
[1:07:20] That church lived through it. Only they
[1:07:22] didn't know what they didn't know it
[1:07:24] all. You understand? But they were
[1:07:26] already living. And so, Brother Brandham
[1:07:27] talks about how that that that mystery
[1:07:31] that a that a seal partially breaks
[1:07:34] open. A mystery drops down. A messenger
[1:07:37] catches it, runs with it, people rally
[1:07:40] around it, and then that age is laid
[1:07:43] away asleep. And then once the
[1:07:45] messengergers's gone and all the bride
[1:07:46] of that are on the book that are were on
[1:07:48] the role for that age or died away, now
[1:07:51] the the the the next generation who are
[1:07:53] not born again take a hold of that
[1:07:55] message and denominate it.
[1:07:57] And then and then God's done with it and
[1:07:59] he moves on to the next one and and
[1:08:01] another mystery and another messenger
[1:08:03] and another whole group of people. And
[1:08:05] every time that that there's a rejection
[1:08:08] of that original message, then one of
[1:08:10] those vials cracks open and drops a
[1:08:13] temporary plague on the earth. See, all
[1:08:16] of that is going to unfold in the
[1:08:19] tribulation. Because today, we don't,
[1:08:22] you have to understand, you say, "Oh,
[1:08:24] well, but we've got the pale horse
[1:08:26] rider." The pale horse rider is a
[1:08:29] conglomerate
[1:08:31] of the first, second, and third. You
[1:08:34] understand? So everything they dealt
[1:08:36] with partially under that partial
[1:08:38] breaking under the first age it that
[1:08:41] we've got that plus the second one plus
[1:08:43] the third one. And now and now we
[1:08:46] realize that that under under the vial
[1:08:49] and under the corresponding trumpet that
[1:08:51] the sun is going dark, the sun won't
[1:08:54] shine and the moon is going dark. And
[1:08:55] brother Brandham says, "See, they're
[1:08:57] they're they're starting to turn away
[1:08:59] from the word. The church is like the
[1:09:01] moon and the sun is like the word. And
[1:09:04] and what's going to follow that? Then a
[1:09:06] star is going to fall from heaven, which
[1:09:08] is Lucifer.
[1:09:09] The bottomless pit's going to be open
[1:09:11] because he's given a key and demon
[1:09:14] powers. And now you're coming into 1880,
[1:09:16] 1890, 1900, 1905, 1906.
[1:09:21] And then and then that bottomless pit,
[1:09:24] those scor those those those creatures
[1:09:26] are going to go out there with scorpions
[1:09:28] and hair like a woman and and they and
[1:09:31] they look like they look like scorpions
[1:09:32] and they sting a man. Now when you look
[1:09:34] at that in history, it's interesting
[1:09:37] because that the elements of that fifth
[1:09:40] vial that partially broke, remember it
[1:09:42] all breaks full in the tribulation.
[1:09:44] Amen. Even even when we go back to the
[1:09:47] to the seals and we say, "Well, we're
[1:09:50] under the under the pale horse." True.
[1:09:53] Yes. But
[1:09:55] he's not on his full- mounted ride
[1:09:57] because he can't
[1:09:59] because you're here
[1:10:01] and your presence hinders him
[1:10:03] and he can't get a full mount ride. So
[1:10:06] the world thinks it's bad now.
[1:10:09] They ain't got a clue.
[1:10:11] When the last thing holding him back is
[1:10:13] the bride is gone.
[1:10:15] Then the first then the we find that the
[1:10:18] white horse, the red horse, the black
[1:10:20] horse is all now the full power of the
[1:10:21] pale horse and he starts riding through
[1:10:23] the tribulation. The world is a fairy
[1:10:25] land right now compared to what it's
[1:10:27] about to be.
[1:10:29] Amen.
[1:10:30] So, so and then and then the cluster is
[1:10:33] all happening together. And then you've
[1:10:35] got the the church cooling off under
[1:10:37] that fourth trumpet, fourth vial. You've
[1:10:39] got then the Satan is loose, drops down,
[1:10:42] the the bottomless pit is open, demon
[1:10:44] powers, brother Brandham calls it the
[1:10:45] lid torn from hell. We covered this last
[1:10:47] Sunday and starts streaming through the
[1:10:49] earth. And that's how it ramps the world
[1:10:51] up to go to world war that had never
[1:10:53] happened. That's
[1:10:54] right.
[1:10:55] Because you had had wars and rumors of
[1:10:56] wars. Jesus said, "You'll have that.
[1:10:58] It's not the end. These things have to
[1:10:59] be. It's just the beginning of sorrows."
[1:11:01] But the world had never had a World War.
[1:11:04] See, because the World War I and World
[1:11:08] War II and World War II, the first,
[1:11:11] second, and third woe are the judgments
[1:11:14] to sweep the earth of sinful man. And it
[1:11:18] would have went 1 2 3 gone had not an
[1:11:21] angel rose from the east and put a stop
[1:11:23] on it after the end of World War I and
[1:11:26] paused it
[1:11:27] because there still had to the church
[1:11:29] ages were still moving and the seals
[1:11:31] were still in play and the trumpets and
[1:11:34] and and and it hadn't even the the the
[1:11:36] theund the 200 million chargers under
[1:11:40] the sixth trumpet
[1:11:42] corresponding vial sixth corresponding
[1:11:44] vial hadn't even been released yet.
[1:11:46] Amen. to to anoint Hitler and Ikeman and
[1:11:49] Mussolini and Stalin to slaughter the
[1:11:51] Jews. Oh friend, do you see how this is
[1:11:53] all in a cluster? It's all working
[1:11:55] together.
[1:11:56] And while all of that is happening and
[1:11:58] it's breaking into the 20th century and
[1:12:01] you're going to the first woe now, it's
[1:12:03] interesting because brother Brandham
[1:12:04] said, now this is just Brother Jason.
[1:12:07] I'll give you what he said and then I'll
[1:12:10] give you what it looks like to me beyond
[1:12:11] what he said. Is that okay? It's you're
[1:12:14] you you're definitely going to want to
[1:12:15] take what he said, what I say. You can
[1:12:18] you can you can chew on it and it just
[1:12:21] it just helps me to understand it. It's
[1:12:23] not anything to affect us. It's just the
[1:12:25] way it looks to me. So when I when I
[1:12:28] look at that fifth trumpet and the
[1:12:29] corresponding vial because the trumpets
[1:12:32] and vials run together, if you read
[1:12:34] their description, they're almost
[1:12:35] identical. Yeah. Amen.
[1:12:36] So, so you find out that they they
[1:12:38] involve the same thing. Just like the
[1:12:40] the the sixth vial and the sixth trumpet
[1:12:43] all deal with the river and it's
[1:12:44] Euphrates and it's water and it's
[1:12:45] demons.
[1:12:46] All right. The you go back to the fifth
[1:12:48] trumpet, the fifth vial, go back to the
[1:12:50] fourth one and trumpet and the fourth
[1:12:51] vial and you'll see that they
[1:12:52] correspond. All right?
[1:12:55] So, brother Brandham said these locusts
[1:12:57] that come up
[1:12:59] had long hair
[1:13:02] like women. Now, bear in mind, we're at
[1:13:04] the first part of the 20th century.
[1:13:07] The lid's torn from hell
[1:13:09] somewhere. It's just somewhere short of
[1:13:12] World War I. So, somewhere at the end of
[1:13:15] the 1890s going into the 1900s,
[1:13:19] somewhere in there, it's a little
[1:13:21] ambiguous. We don't know exactly, but at
[1:13:23] some point, the star falls from heaven.
[1:13:25] He's given a key, opens the bottomless
[1:13:27] pit, and out they come.
[1:13:29] Now, Brother Brandham said they had hair
[1:13:33] like women
[1:13:35] to torment the women who had cut theirs
[1:13:39] off.
[1:13:40] Amen.
[1:13:42] Amen.
[1:13:43] Now, it's notable to me, and it's not
[1:13:45] lost on me as a matter of observation
[1:13:48] that the hair bob came in 1912.
[1:13:52] It was called the Bob and it came out of
[1:13:54] Hollywood. And if you go back and look
[1:13:57] at old pictures, women had long hair. It
[1:13:59] fell all the way down. And and even when
[1:14:01] they were still dressing very decently,
[1:14:04] they started Hollywood started
[1:14:05] influencing them. And in 1912, the hair
[1:14:08] bob came and it was all the rage. And
[1:14:11] you're going I mean, you're you're
[1:14:12] you're you're going right there and in a
[1:14:14] little while you're going to be in the
[1:14:15] roaring 20s.
[1:14:16] And brother Bram talks about how the
[1:14:17] chorus girls became flappers and then
[1:14:19] the flappers in every generation just
[1:14:20] got completely worse. And so now I can
[1:14:24] see that the bottomless pit is opened
[1:14:28] and I can see scorpions with hairike
[1:14:30] women to torment women who cut theirs
[1:14:32] off. You say, "What was their torment?"
[1:14:38] World War I took 25 million of their
[1:14:42] husbands and sons.
[1:14:43] Amen. Amen.
[1:14:45] And that's a conservative estimate. Some
[1:14:48] estimates are 40 million.
[1:14:50] And just as a as a student of history,
[1:14:53] that's not lost on me when I look at
[1:14:55] that and go, "Wow, brother Brandham
[1:14:58] never never t never connected that dot."
[1:15:00] So it's it's free. But when I what he
[1:15:04] did make clear was he tracked that
[1:15:06] fourth trumpet, fifth trumpet, and sixth
[1:15:08] trumpet, and he told us what they were.
[1:15:10] Now, the first three, we have almost no
[1:15:12] clue at all. It was to the Jews. It was
[1:15:14] happening in history. Some of it looks
[1:15:16] like the bubanic plague back back there.
[1:15:18] I don't know. It's it's ominous when you
[1:15:21] read it. That that's that's the history
[1:15:23] Moses and Elijah will make clear to the
[1:15:25] Jews, to the 144,000 like brother
[1:15:27] Brandon made the history to us clear
[1:15:29] when he preached the church ages and the
[1:15:31] seals and told us what was all happening
[1:15:33] and why. see that. And so that'll be
[1:15:36] their message because what the Jews have
[1:15:39] a have a notion when they think about
[1:15:41] the Holocaust and they think about the
[1:15:43] pograms and everything they went through
[1:15:45] through the dark ages and and under
[1:15:47] Isabel and all the different things and
[1:15:49] and and and the whole uh uh persecution
[1:15:52] of the Jews for 2,000 years. They have
[1:15:55] felt like God has abandoned them. And
[1:15:57] it'll be Moses and Elijah who will say,
[1:15:59] "No,
[1:16:01] he didn't abandon you." Actually, while
[1:16:03] all that was happening, he kept
[1:16:05] preserving you.
[1:16:07] And you've come to this day and he
[1:16:08] wouldn't even let the World War I 2 and
[1:16:10] three go because he had to send us to
[1:16:12] you first.
[1:16:14] And they're going to realize, oh my
[1:16:16] goodness, he loves us. Yeah, of course
[1:16:18] he loves you. He's always loved you.
[1:16:22] See, I'm so happy for him. I don't know
[1:16:24] who they are, but I'm happy for them
[1:16:26] already.
[1:16:27] Oh, what a what a jubilee. is going to
[1:16:28] be like the bride in 1963 when the seals
[1:16:31] are open and it was a jubilee.
[1:16:33] Hallelujah.
[1:16:35] Amen.
[1:16:37] And so, so we so it's not lost on me
[1:16:40] that they're going to lose and then the
[1:16:43] second woe is going to begin and then
[1:16:45] they're going to lose 60 to 75 million
[1:16:48] of sons and daughters, sons and fathers,
[1:16:52] husbands and sons
[1:16:54] are going to be killed around the world.
[1:16:57] Amen.
[1:16:58] So when I see these things tormenting
[1:17:01] women because they bobbed off their hair
[1:17:03] and they and it but they still hadn't
[1:17:05] fallen from grace yet till around the
[1:17:07] beginning of the second woe and the
[1:17:09] second world war. And brother Brandham
[1:17:11] identifies that as when women fell from
[1:17:13] grace and the nation the backbone of the
[1:17:15] nation was broke. It takes a prophet to
[1:17:17] pinpoint those times.
[1:17:19] Takes a prophet to show what's
[1:17:20] happening. It takes a prophet to show
[1:17:22] 1956 is the last year for America.
[1:17:25] Yeah. Amen.
[1:17:26] You don't catch it here. You're not.
[1:17:27] You're not ever going to catch it. They
[1:17:28] didn't. 57. He says, "Okay, you missed
[1:17:30] it. That's it. Do what you want. Pour
[1:17:33] all the resources in it you want. Have
[1:17:34] satellite TV. Have big choirs. Have big
[1:17:36] churches. Go around the world. It's
[1:17:38] you're not going to bring it back. It's
[1:17:40] doomed."
[1:17:42] See? So, so you've heard me say this
[1:17:45] before. So, while that's happening under
[1:17:48] the trumpets and vows throughout Europe,
[1:17:50] throughout the Ottoman Empire, and it's
[1:17:52] all about God moving the Jews, getting
[1:17:53] them ready to go back to the homeland,
[1:17:54] however, the Gentiles are involved in
[1:17:56] it,
[1:17:57] because it's gentile women bobbing their
[1:17:59] hair, it's gentile men dying in war,
[1:18:02] you see. So, we're all in this thing
[1:18:03] together,
[1:18:04] right? And so, so when you when you go
[1:18:07] like that and you you see how it's
[1:18:10] tracking through history and you
[1:18:12] understand the cause of all of of of the
[1:18:14] fourth, the sun is darkened, the moon is
[1:18:17] darkened, and the bottomless pit is
[1:18:19] open, and world wars are starting to
[1:18:22] move, and women are bobbing their hair,
[1:18:24] and the bottomless pit is open. And
[1:18:26] while that's happening across the ocean,
[1:18:31] God is talking to a small boy under a
[1:18:34] tree saying, "Don't ever drink or smoke
[1:18:37] or defile your body. I have a work for
[1:18:39] you to do when you get older."
[1:18:42] He grew up and he went to work and I'm
[1:18:44] the beneficiary of it.
[1:18:47] Not only am I now, but I can look back
[1:18:49] at that history and say, "Jesus followed
[1:18:51] me. He was following me. He led me all
[1:18:54] the way." Surely goodness and mercy
[1:18:58] shall follow me all the days of my life.
[1:19:01] Hallelujah.
[1:19:04] And of all the the 40 million that died
[1:19:07] in the bubanic plague and all of the 25
[1:19:10] to 40 million that died in World War I
[1:19:12] and the 75 million that died in World
[1:19:15] War II, my seed line was unkillable cuz
[1:19:18] I had to get here. Amen.
[1:19:20] And I am here to tell you something,
[1:19:21] friends. Brother Brandham, and I read
[1:19:22] this in history when they were when that
[1:19:25] war chief had his he said I read his own
[1:19:28] memoirs. He said, "I had my best
[1:19:31] marksman trying to kill General
[1:19:33] Washington
[1:19:35] and we had him dead to rights and my
[1:19:38] best marksman took five shots at range
[1:19:41] and and he said we could see the bullets
[1:19:43] hitting him and nothing was happening."
[1:19:46] And he said after and they just kept
[1:19:48] passing through his coat and not going I
[1:19:51] don't know they go in his coat and go
[1:19:52] around his biting go out the backside I
[1:19:53] don't know he stayed in the saddle he
[1:19:55] wasn't hit and the chief said I told my
[1:19:59] braves stop shooting at him the great
[1:20:02] spirit is protecting him I don't know
[1:20:05] why but stop shooting at him I read that
[1:20:08] myself I'm here to tell you something
[1:20:10] friends said there was an old
[1:20:11] Pentecostal sister and the Holy Spirit
[1:20:13] broke out and she was dancing around her
[1:20:15] living room and People rode by and shot
[1:20:17] into the house and bullets came through
[1:20:19] and went right through her clothing and
[1:20:21] she just kept right on shouting and
[1:20:23] praising the Lord.
[1:20:25] Hallelujah.
[1:20:26] Sure, I know that some of them died. I
[1:20:28] know that some of them have lived in
[1:20:30] dens and caves. I know the world wasn't
[1:20:32] worthy of any of them. I know some of
[1:20:34] them refused deliverance because they
[1:20:36] they wanted like Moses. They chose the
[1:20:38] harder way. They did like brother
[1:20:39] Brandham and chose the harder way. And
[1:20:42] I'm here to say tonight, I'm choosing
[1:20:44] the harder way. It's not the way of the
[1:20:46] world, but I got a bright future ahead.
[1:20:56] I promised myself I'd stop at 8:30. So,
[1:20:58] I got three minutes. I'm going to say
[1:21:00] this.
[1:21:02] When we come back Sunday,
[1:21:04] unless we're in the rapture,
[1:21:08] if we're not, if we're the rapture comes
[1:21:10] before Sunday, I won't be here. I hope
[1:21:13] none of you are here.
[1:21:14] Right. Amen.
[1:21:15] I hope none of y'all are at church
[1:21:17] on Sunday if the rapture comes
[1:21:24] and I feel sorry for the ones who missed
[1:21:25] their last opportunity tonight.
[1:21:29] Now, Brother JD, they got family.
[1:21:31] They're over in Charleston. Brother
[1:21:32] Brad, they're over there preaching. So,
[1:21:33] don't I know I know there's some
[1:21:35] different people been sick. I had a
[1:21:36] number of prayer requests that come in
[1:21:38] and we're going to cut catch those in a
[1:21:39] moment.
[1:21:41] So, I I want to and I'm not going to
[1:21:44] have time to get to any of them tonight,
[1:21:46] but I've got an entire stack of quotes
[1:21:50] where Brother Brandham is going to give
[1:21:52] us the key to understanding
[1:21:54] how is he still the interceding lamb,
[1:21:59] but yet the seals are open and the
[1:22:00] sanctuary smoking. He stepped from
[1:22:02] eternity to intercede and he's opened
[1:22:04] the book. Yeah,
[1:22:05] because you have you're going to be
[1:22:07] given to understand the difference
[1:22:09] between the appearing of Christ and the
[1:22:12] coming of Christ.
[1:22:13] Amen.
[1:22:14] And brother Brandham goes over he goes
[1:22:16] out of his way. I probably have at least
[1:22:19] a dozen at least. uh where brother
[1:22:22] Brandham uh is beginning to say he said
[1:22:25] now you've got to see the difference
[1:22:27] between the appearing the epiphania of
[1:22:30] God and words are synonymous whether
[1:22:32] it's it's actually pronounced paracia
[1:22:34] brother David Ml used to laugh he said
[1:22:36] people don't know how to pronounce it
[1:22:38] said well brother David you're you're in
[1:22:39] the Greek you got an advantage and so
[1:22:42] whether it's paracia whether it's
[1:22:43] epiphania no matter what it is the
[1:22:46] coming the presence the appearing
[1:22:48] they're all synonymous words, but they
[1:22:52] apply at different times.
[1:22:54] The appearing of Christ is happening
[1:22:58] with the with right now
[1:23:00] with the message of the hour brought the
[1:23:02] appearing of Christ, but that's not his
[1:23:04] coming. It is his coming because the
[1:23:06] words are synonymous.
[1:23:08] So, he has come and he's in our midst.
[1:23:11] But I thought you said he wasn't here
[1:23:13] corporally. He's not. He's in heaven as
[1:23:15] a lamb.
[1:23:16] Then where is he? He's in you. He's in
[1:23:18] me. That's what the ministry of the son
[1:23:20] of man is all about.
[1:23:24] Let's stand.
[1:23:30] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:23:33] Lord, I'm sorry. I didn't hardly get
[1:23:34] anything and it's your fault.
[1:23:42] Oh, wow. Boy, I should set y'all back
[1:23:44] down and cover all of this. No, let's
[1:23:47] not. Let's not.
[1:23:51] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:23:53] Praise the Lord. Let's have uh our
[1:23:57] musicians come. Oh, here we go. And
[1:23:59] let's play something. Uh let's see who
[1:24:02] we missing. We are missing our piano
[1:24:04] player and our beautiful black man.
[1:24:06] Okay, come on, brother.
[1:24:08] You gonna play the piano?
[1:24:10] Okay, you're just going to sing a
[1:24:11] capella? Well, you got the band.
[1:24:13] Okay, cool. All right. Praise the Lord.
[1:24:17] Amen. And I caught him, a beautiful
[1:24:18] black man. One time I got outside and I
[1:24:20] said asked Sister Amber, "You agree with
[1:24:22] me?" She said, "Oh, yes.
[1:24:27] Praise the Lord." Whatever you're going
[1:24:29] to I know Andrew is short, but he's not
[1:24:31] over there, is he? Okay. Just making
[1:24:32] sure. All right. So, sing something for
[1:24:35] us, Brother Tony, while I get these
[1:24:36] prayer requests. Here I am shutting
[1:24:37] everything down. I got to get these
[1:24:38] prayer requests. Y'all come on and
[1:24:40] gather around. Come on up here while we
[1:24:42] while we get these requests uh and taken
[1:24:45] up.
[1:24:49] Is that the doctor behind me?
[1:24:51] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:56] Ah. Oh my. So, we got a number of
[1:24:58] requests here. If you've if you've still
[1:25:00] got one and haven't turned it in. I am

[1:26:51] [Applause]
[1:26:53] grace

[1:27:00] soul.
[1:27:01] Aren't you glad he
[1:27:04] He loved beyond
[1:27:10] my fault
[1:27:12] and all
[1:27:14] my need.
[1:27:17] Amen. Just keep playing that for me
[1:27:18] softly, Brother Andrew. We might come
[1:27:21] back to it in a minute.
[1:27:24] Sister Meredith says, "I wanted to send
[1:27:26] in a prayer request for Wednesday night.
[1:27:29] My 49year-old brother Michael
[1:27:32] just found out that he has to have open
[1:27:34] heart surgery to replace his aortic
[1:27:38] valve. The doctor says that his heart is
[1:27:41] operating at 25% of its normal capacity
[1:27:45] right now. We do not have a date for the
[1:27:48] surgery but it is expected within a
[1:27:50] month. This is going to be a very long
[1:27:52] recovery for him and he's very active
[1:27:55] person in his business and life. Most of
[1:27:57] all, he's not currently serving the
[1:27:59] Lord, but we believe the Lord is at work
[1:28:01] in several ways to draw his attention.
[1:28:03] Please be praying. Perfect will for my
[1:28:06] brother. I told her, Sister Meredith, I
[1:28:10] said, um, I think the Lord is pursuing
[1:28:14] him and I do not think he'll get away.
[1:28:18] Sister Hope writes, prayer requests for
[1:28:20] Wednesday's service. Please continue to
[1:28:21] remember Denise Sers in prayer. The Lord
[1:28:24] recently healed her of stage four cancer
[1:28:28] after visiting the ER with kidney issues
[1:28:30] a few weeks ago. You remember she was
[1:28:33] the one that had had that brain tumor
[1:28:35] and the Lord healed her. Uh after
[1:28:37] visiting the ER with kidney issues a few
[1:28:39] weeks ago, she has been diagnosed with a
[1:28:42] new tumor blocking her ur urtors. Her
[1:28:46] and her daughter June Brock are asking
[1:28:49] for special prayer for clarity and
[1:28:51] wisdom to make the best decisions for
[1:28:54] her care. An increased appetite to fuel
[1:28:57] her strength. Um,
[1:29:01] and June needs patience and a softer
[1:29:03] attitude in dealing with all of the
[1:29:05] responsibilities associated caring for
[1:29:08] her mom and family.
[1:29:11] All right. Brother Caleb Campbell
[1:29:13] writes, "Prayer request for Lana
[1:29:15] tonight. She's got a sore throat and not
[1:29:17] feeling well. Prayer request from Sister
[1:29:20] Phyllis. Brother Jason, I have a prayer
[1:29:21] request for my sister Susie.
[1:29:25] She has recently been diagnosed with
[1:29:27] stage 2 breast cancer. It's been caught
[1:29:30] early, but she had a genetic testing
[1:29:32] done and has tested positive for the
[1:29:34] BERSA gene, which means she has a high
[1:29:37] probability of cancer reoccurring in the
[1:29:40] future. Therefore, she is looking at
[1:29:42] rather than having a lump lumpctomy,
[1:29:45] rather than that having a double
[1:29:47] mastctomy, we are waiting for a surgery
[1:29:50] schedule date. Please pray for her
[1:29:52] healing. She recently had her last MRI
[1:29:55] from her. This is the one who had brain
[1:29:58] uh brain surgery. I was confusing that
[1:30:00] with the person for sister hope uh and
[1:30:02] was given the allclear. So, praise the
[1:30:04] Lord. I know the Lord was with her
[1:30:06] throughout and he healed her. I see
[1:30:09] signs of his grace and intervention in
[1:30:11] the circumstances already. I know that
[1:30:14] she and I and our family would really
[1:30:17] appreciate everyone's prayers. Thank
[1:30:19] you. Brother John Lichek writes,
[1:30:21] "Brother Jason, we are requesting prayer
[1:30:23] for us. Elliot was having trouble
[1:30:25] sleeping and napping and congested. I am
[1:30:28] congested and achy, although mostly
[1:30:30] okay. Thank the Lord. Meredith has to
[1:30:32] work and praying for strength for her
[1:30:35] over the next few days. Thank the Lord.
[1:30:37] Hazel and Meredith has have been fine.
[1:30:40] Amen. Praise the Lord. Um, we'll sing
[1:30:44] that through again, Brother Tony. Amen.
[1:30:46] Then we'll go to prayer.

[1:31:03] to

[1:31:09] where Jesus
[1:31:11] died

[1:31:15] [Music]
[1:31:19] [Applause]
[1:31:25] praise
[1:31:26] that God
[1:31:28] my
[1:31:30] [Music]
[1:31:34] He looked
[1:31:36] He looks beyond
[1:31:42] my thoughts
[1:31:44] and all.
[1:31:45] [Music]
[1:31:48] Amen. Join with someone standing near
[1:31:50] you. Sister uh Princess also sent in a
[1:31:53] request wanting to be remembered in
[1:31:54] prayer. Brother Jason remembered me in
[1:31:56] prayer. Brother Dale wanted me to tell
[1:31:59] you all. He said, "Tell them we we love
[1:32:03] y'all." Amen. Tell them we love y'all.
[1:32:05] Amen. Sure. Love Brother Dale as well.
[1:32:08] And um let me make sure I had that
[1:32:11] correct. Yeah. Sister Princess just
[1:32:13] says, "Hey, pastor, remember me." Amen.
[1:32:16] Father God,
[1:32:18] Lord, we look into your word tonight and
[1:32:22] we just hardly have time to get very
[1:32:25] deeply into it. We just wanted to bring
[1:32:28] the people along and kind of give them a
[1:32:30] little refresher to catch them up in
[1:32:32] this series. We've had a little bit of a
[1:32:34] break from it. So tonight, Lord, we
[1:32:36] wanted to look into the word and find
[1:32:39] our footing and find our place. And
[1:32:41] these things give us courage, Lord.
[1:32:42] really they give us such courage because
[1:32:45] we can see my goodness you're really you
[1:32:48] really are in control of it all. History
[1:32:52] really is under the control of prophecy
[1:32:55] for real. Lord that gives us such peace
[1:32:58] and confidence. When we hear a prophet
[1:33:01] say that he that he you must intercede
[1:33:03] until that last name is called. Lord, we
[1:33:07] we want to look deeply into the into the
[1:33:10] whole meaning of the ministry of the son
[1:33:12] of man because that's the real key to
[1:33:14] understanding the appearing from the
[1:33:16] coming Lord. That's the understanding of
[1:33:19] peru paracia that they so misunderstood
[1:33:22] in the 80s. It's wonderful truths there,
[1:33:25] but it's got to be lined out. We've got
[1:33:27] to be able to say it exactly like a
[1:33:29] prophet said it and make it fit. Lord,
[1:33:31] I'm grateful to you for this day and
[1:33:33] hour and the revelation of the spirit,
[1:33:36] Lord, that we have to see these things
[1:33:38] clearly and teach it to the people. I
[1:33:40] pray tonight, Lord God, for all of our
[1:33:42] needs. We're thinking about Brother
[1:33:44] Jason and his family with family in town
[1:33:47] visiting. May they have a blessed time,
[1:33:49] Lord. May you just bless them
[1:33:50] abundantly. Brother Brad laboring pro
[1:33:53] perhaps at this very minute there in
[1:33:55] Green Pond. May you just bless them
[1:33:57] mightily, Lord Jesus. We're thanking uh
[1:34:00] and and we return the love back to our
[1:34:02] dear brother Dale who we never go a day
[1:34:05] without missing terribly. Lord, we thank
[1:34:08] sister Princess who if we had our way,
[1:34:10] she'd be sitting right here with us
[1:34:12] every service. Lord, I pray for her,
[1:34:14] Lord. We love her. We ask you to
[1:34:15] strengthen her, Lord, that in the day
[1:34:18] and hour that we live in. It's a
[1:34:19] terrible day, Lord. So may Lord if she
[1:34:22] took the time to send in a request for
[1:34:25] prayer and she put a an emoji of of
[1:34:28] hands uplifted. Brother Brandham said
[1:34:30] one day you say does it matter to raise
[1:34:32] my hand? He said it could be the
[1:34:34] difference between life and death. Lord
[1:34:36] she couldn't raise her hands here
[1:34:38] physically but she sent hands raised.
[1:34:40] And I pray you'll honor her prayer right
[1:34:42] now. Lord, we think of our our request
[1:34:45] that came in, Lord, from Sister Meredith
[1:34:47] and her brother only 49 years old. Lord,
[1:34:51] may you cause this to be so beautiful.
[1:34:53] May it have such an outcome. We pray for
[1:34:56] that man right now. No doubt running
[1:34:58] from the presence of the Lord. Catch
[1:35:00] him, Jesus. Catch him. Catch him, Lord.
[1:35:03] Catch him for the kingdom. Bring him to
[1:35:05] thee, oh God. uh tear tear the sinful
[1:35:08] nature from his soul and fill him full
[1:35:11] of the Holy Spirit and heal his heart,
[1:35:13] Lord God, and do it all in one big big
[1:35:16] package that would astonish the doctors
[1:35:18] and shut the devil up. Lord, may you
[1:35:20] grant these beautiful requests that we
[1:35:22] have for our sister Meredith's brother.
[1:35:25] Father, for this friend, this Denise
[1:35:27] Sers sister hope sends him. And Lord
[1:35:30] God, we see that the enemy fighting and
[1:35:33] we see the needs that are both physical,
[1:35:35] emotional, mental. Lord God, we're just
[1:35:39] asking for your the only one who can
[1:35:42] look at the whole case, start to finish,
[1:35:45] head to toe, inside and out. You know
[1:35:48] how to fix everything, everybody in
[1:35:51] every way, and you can put it all back
[1:35:54] together in perfect harmony. Lord, we
[1:35:56] ask this grace of thee, this mercy upon
[1:35:59] these people that Sister Hopein informs
[1:36:01] us of. Lord, we're thinking of our
[1:36:03] little sister Lana tonight. Lord God,
[1:36:06] Father, you lay your hands upon her
[1:36:08] right now and condemn the work of the
[1:36:10] enemy. May our little sister be made
[1:36:12] well. May Lord Uriah and Joy, may none
[1:36:16] of them and brother Caleb, may they all
[1:36:18] be shielded from the attack of the
[1:36:19] enemy. Father, I pray that you will
[1:36:22] bring healing to that home tonight.
[1:36:24] Lord, for this need for for Susie, uh
[1:36:27] the dear sister, Lord, how you've healed
[1:36:29] her, how you've come on the scene, our
[1:36:32] the sister of our sister Phyllis, you've
[1:36:34] already done great things, Lord God. So,
[1:36:36] why shouldn't we ask you for more and
[1:36:38] believe for more and believe for even
[1:36:40] bigger things, oh God? May you grant it
[1:36:42] to her, Lord. I pray in the name of
[1:36:45] Jesus that you'll bring all of these
[1:36:47] things, Lord. And and uh and we pray for
[1:36:51] Elliot, Father, and having trouble
[1:36:53] sleeping. and napping and congested and
[1:36:55] Lord and and and brother John also
[1:36:58] congested and achy. But Lord, we're

[1:37:03] well. Shield Sister Meredith, Sister
[1:37:05] Hazel, recover her her men, Lord, uh the
[1:37:09] men of the home. I pray quickly, may it

[1:37:14] into your hands in Jesus lovely name.
[1:37:18] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:37:21] [Music]
[1:37:23] Huh? Amen. Sister Meredith, brother Dale
[1:37:26] says, "That's the same surgery I had as
[1:37:28] sister Meredith's brother. Tell her it
[1:37:30] changed my life. Surely it will change
[1:37:33] his." I'll say, "A amen to that." Amen
