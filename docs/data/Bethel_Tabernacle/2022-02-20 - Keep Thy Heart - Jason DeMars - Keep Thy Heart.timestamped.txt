[3:03] works lord we thank you for that
[3:06] we we pray that you'd visit us in a
[3:08] special way today we ask in jesus name
[3:10] amen
[3:12] i want to speak on the
[3:13] topic keeping the heart
[3:15] and first scripture i'm going to look at
[3:17] is in proverbs chapter 4 verse 23 i'm
[3:21] just going to read it
[3:22] now and then we'll comment more on it
[3:26] later on
[3:27] in the sunday school so keep thy heart
[3:30] with all diligence for out of it are the
[3:33] issues of life
[3:35] amen may the lord add the blessing to
[3:37] the reading of his word you can be
[3:38] seated
[3:41] amen keep your heart with all diligence
[3:44] that's what we're going to talk about
[3:46] keeping
[3:47] the heart that's a that's a commandment
[3:50] from the lord to us
[3:52] by the word is that
[3:54] out of it are the issues of life in
[3:56] other words
[3:57] our life
[3:58] how we live how we act what we do
[4:01] starts from our heart
[4:03] jesus expounds upon that in the sermon
[4:06] on the mount and various other places in
[4:08] his rebukes to the pharisees and so
[4:10] forth um
[4:14] that
[4:15] is where our nature is that's the kind
[4:17] of person we are if we don't keep or
[4:19] guard our heart
[4:21] what happens is the enemy
[4:23] comes in
[4:24] the enemy works his deceit
[4:27] jeremiah 17 verse nine
[4:32] not just the enemy
[4:34] sometimes we are our own worst enemy
[4:37] many times where our own own worst enemy
[4:40] jeremiah 17 9 says the heart is
[4:42] deceitful above all things
[4:44] and desperately wicked who can know it
[4:48] so
[4:49] our heart is
[4:50] wicked that's the nature that we're born
[4:52] with
[4:54] it's
[4:55] it's so bad that the word of god says
[4:58] who can even know the depths
[5:00] of the depravity and the wickedness
[5:02] that's in
[5:03] the heart of man so how do we go from
[5:06] there
[5:07] to keep your heart
[5:10] i know it's a simple
[5:12] answer is you have to be you must be
[5:14] born again
[5:15] you have to have the holy spirit
[5:16] dwelling inside of you to change your
[5:18] heart and yet we still have that nature
[5:20] we're never going to get rid of
[5:23] a sinful nature that's dwelling inside
[5:25] of us until we have a body change
[5:28] but
[5:29] that's that's part of what we're here
[5:31] for is god is changing us because he
[5:34] doesn't want us to be under the dominion
[5:36] of that sinful nature anymore the heart
[5:39] is desperately wicked who can know it
[5:41] and that continues
[5:43] that continues on even when the holy
[5:44] ghost is there but thank god there's
[5:46] power that we don't have to surrender
[5:50] to that wickedness that dwells inside of
[5:52] us we can overcome it
[5:54] we can fight against it we don't have to
[5:56] live under
[5:58] the authority of sin and the devil
[6:00] anymore we're set free from that
[6:04] so
[6:05] uh god
[6:07] god chose
[6:10] to work on man's heart
[6:12] right
[6:14] the devil chose to work in his
[6:18] mind so god works on man's heart why
[6:21] does he work on the heart because he
[6:23] knows if he changes the heart
[6:25] the rest of the man or woman is going to
[6:28] change
[6:29] transformation follows when god works in
[6:31] the heart
[6:32] the devil works on the mind why why does
[6:35] he work on the mind
[6:36] because he's trying to block what god
[6:39] is doing in the heart and out so there's
[6:41] a war coming on god from the inside out
[6:44] the devil from the outside in
[6:47] i wish i had a uh uh illustration
[6:50] oops i don't know what happened there
[6:52] but get me back up
[6:53] brother josh
[6:55] um
[6:57] you know you have the the three the the
[6:59] soul the spirit and the body
[7:03] so
[7:04] if you if you look further brother
[7:06] branham tells us that
[7:08] that's not just heart it's the soul that
[7:10] is the control tower god wants to work
[7:13] from the soul
[7:15] as the control tower
[7:17] so you have the soul
[7:18] it's either faith or unbelief from the
[7:21] soul then you have the spirit which is
[7:23] memory conscience reason affection
[7:26] imagination
[7:28] okay so those are inlets
[7:31] those are inlets actually they go both
[7:33] directions you contact through your
[7:36] flesh you contact the earth
[7:39] from your from your mind your mind
[7:41] contacts the earth through your flesh
[7:44] your
[7:45] your soul is contacted through those
[7:48] inlets as well
[7:51] so it goes both directions so you see
[7:53] what i'm saying with god is working
[7:55] from a transformed soul to change those
[7:59] other inlets so that he is manifested
[8:02] out
[8:03] through your mind
[8:05] to your body into the world
[8:07] the devil wants to stop that he doesn't
[8:09] want that to happen so what does he do
[8:11] he those are also inlets going down so
[8:14] he works on memory conscience reason
[8:16] affection imagination
[8:18] so there's there's that battle taking
[8:20] place
[8:21] right there so what are you governed by
[8:24] what what is governing you the outside
[8:27] in or the inside out because you can be
[8:30] you can be a christian and go to church
[8:32] and still be governed from the outside
[8:36] going in and you're living and operating
[8:38] in unbelief
[8:41] because that's what's ultimately what
[8:42] satan wants to get the soul condition to
[8:44] be is
[8:46] unbelief
[8:47] god's purpose of the soul condition is
[8:49] faith because faith changes everything
[8:52] faith changes how we interact with this
[8:54] in this earth
[8:59] so
[9:00] as believers of course we're sealed by
[9:02] the holy ghost the devil can't get in to
[9:05] reside in our hearts but he certainly
[9:08] can come through those inlets to impact
[9:11] our faith
[9:13] uh he wants to he wants to go from
[9:17] a fully operational faith to a faith
[9:19] that's like
[9:21] down
[9:22] in
[9:23] some
[9:24] crevice of the soul
[9:26] that's not even hardly operating
[9:28] it's just operating enough to go to
[9:30] church maybe and say that you believe
[9:32] that's that's wonderful that's a great
[9:34] start but god wants the whole your whole
[9:37] body soul and spirit to be cleansed and
[9:40] operating under faith he doesn't just
[9:42] want faith in your soul he wants faith
[9:44] in your mind he wants faith operating
[9:47] through your body
[9:48] the devil wants to put that in a corner
[9:50] that he can't take that away from you
[9:52] once you're sealed he can never take
[9:54] faith away from you but he can make it
[9:57] in opera in inoperable
[10:00] and that's the great danger and that's
[10:01] why we have to keep our heart
[10:07] let's just look at a few scriptures go
[10:09] quickly through them and god god saw
[10:11] that the wickedness is a genesis 6 5
[10:14] and god saw that the wickedness of man
[10:16] was great in the earth and that every
[10:18] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[10:21] was only evil continually
[10:24] again god goes directly to the problem
[10:26] the thoughts of their heart
[10:27] the thoughts of their heart are evil
[10:29] continually they're under the dominion
[10:32] of evil and what is happening on the
[10:34] earth because of the hearts of man
[10:36] evil
[10:38] evil is passing passing around
[10:40] everywhere
[10:41] psalm 119 34 give me understanding
[10:45] and i shall keep thy law yea
[10:47] i shall observe it with my whole heart
[10:49] now you're seeing a little bit of a
[10:50] different
[10:51] meaning here whole heart is is you're
[10:54] speaking of your strength of your you're
[10:56] gonna dedicate yourself from the very
[10:58] inmost of your being
[11:00] to observe the law the law of god
[11:04] numbers 15 39 and it shall be unto you
[11:06] for a fringe
[11:07] that you may look upon it and remember
[11:09] all the commandments of the lord and do
[11:11] them and that you seek not after your
[11:13] own heart
[11:15] and your own eyes after which you used
[11:17] to go a whoring
[11:20] seek not after your own heart
[11:22] what do we hear all the time today on
[11:24] social media follow your just if you
[11:26] just follow your heart everything will
[11:27] be all right
[11:31] everything will be all right for the
[11:32] devil
[11:34] if you follow your heart
[11:36] it's absolutely true
[11:38] we were speaking in the men's breakfast
[11:40] yesterday what is what does satan do
[11:43] does he come and say i want to be your
[11:44] master
[11:46] i would like to be your master will you
[11:48] surrender to me uh
[11:51] no thanks no he says
[11:53] i i would like for you to have
[11:55] self-autonomy
[11:57] i would like for you to have freedom to
[12:00] do as you'd like to do
[12:02] and to exalt yourself what did he do
[12:04] what did he do he deceived his own heart
[12:06] in the beginning right what did he do he
[12:08] said i will ascend i will be like the
[12:11] most high
[12:12] what did he do he did the same thing to
[12:14] eve
[12:16] he said if you eat this fruit you'll be
[12:18] like god
[12:20] knowing good and evil so he deceived
[12:23] himself
[12:24] and then he deceived
[12:26] eve
[12:27] doing what
[12:28] not he
[12:29] he didn't offer
[12:32] himself as a master what did he do he
[12:34] offered himself he offered freedom
[12:37] you have freedom to choose you have self
[12:40] you have self-deciding governance i
[12:42] think that's the greatest thing that
[12:44] young people are going through in their
[12:45] minds is i want to decide for myself
[12:48] i want self-autonomy do you know that
[12:50] here's a fact there's no such thing
[12:54] there's no such thing as self-autonomy
[12:56] you're either under the the lordship of
[12:59] satan
[13:00] or the lordship of jesus christ
[13:02] there's not in between
[13:05] the freedom that satan is offering is
[13:07] under his mastership
[13:09] his lordship he is under control
[13:12] a person that say i i want freedom i
[13:14] want to live any way i want to i want to
[13:16] make my own choices
[13:18] oh my the devil has been talking in your
[13:20] ear
[13:23] what are you thinking why would a
[13:25] christian think like that
[13:27] if you're a christian you don't ne you
[13:29] don't ever
[13:31] and you don't never
[13:32] want to make your own choices
[13:34] you don't want to make your own
[13:36] decisions you don't want to establish
[13:37] your own will you want to follow the
[13:39] leadership of the holy spirit
[13:43] we don't seek after our own heart and
[13:45] our own eyes
[13:47] because when we do that what are we
[13:48] doing following the way of the devil
[13:52] following our own way is not following
[13:54] our own way
[13:56] it's following satanic leadership
[13:59] and it brings destruction it might bring
[14:01] you prosperity it might make you rich
[14:04] but it brings soul
[14:06] crushing destruction your own way
[14:10] don't don't ever
[14:11] get young people that are in here don't
[14:13] ever think choosing your own way is your
[14:16] own way
[14:17] that's that's false doctrine
[14:22] there's god's way or there's the devil's
[14:23] way oh it's not it's
[14:25] it's more complicated than that brother
[14:27] jason no it's not more complicated than
[14:29] that
[14:31] it's a it's an absolute scriptural fact
[14:35] all right
[14:37] deuteronomy 4 9 only take heed to
[14:39] thyself and keep thy soul diligently
[14:42] lest thou forget the things which thine
[14:43] eyes have seen
[14:45] unless they depart from thy heart all
[14:47] the days of thy life but teach them
[14:50] thy sons and thy sons
[14:52] sons don't let the word
[14:55] don't let the word manifested depart
[14:58] from your heart
[14:59] and from your mind
[15:01] another take heed to yourself keep your
[15:02] soul diligently in other words there's
[15:04] an effort that goes into this
[15:07] there's diligence that goes into this
[15:09] there's a process that goes into this it
[15:12] doesn't just
[15:13] happen
[15:14] just like the snap of a finger
[15:16] there's something that we
[15:18] have to do as empowered sons and
[15:20] daughters of god
[15:22] that have the holy ghost that have a
[15:24] changed nature there's something that we
[15:27] have to do to keep us in the right
[15:30] position before god
[15:32] there's proverbs 4 23 once again
[15:36] keep thy heart with all diligence for
[15:40] out of it are the issues of life
[15:43] so
[15:44] looking at this
[15:46] that word keep means to guard protect
[15:49] or maintain
[15:51] diligence the word diligence is actually
[15:54] a different word
[15:56] for guard
[15:57] but it's actually speaking of a prison
[16:01] or a garrison
[16:02] a place of protection keep your
[16:05] it's guard your heart with all guarding
[16:09] it's like doubling up in a different
[16:11] uh tense of the word
[16:13] so in other words do you really have to
[16:16] do this you have to put effort you have
[16:18] to put strength you have to put focus
[16:21] on keeping your ho your heart
[16:24] guard your heart your eyes your mind
[16:27] be careful what you look at what you
[16:29] listen to
[16:30] what you consider to be true
[16:33] keep your conscience free from guilt do
[16:34] you know that you can do that
[16:37] you can keep your conscience free from
[16:38] guilt
[16:40] i didn't say free from sin
[16:42] i said free from guilt why because
[16:44] there's a cleansing blood all you have
[16:46] to do is go all you have to do is ask
[16:48] all you have to do says lord forgive me
[16:50] i repent
[16:52] you don't have to hold you don't have to
[16:53] take pride
[16:55] in your sin and hold on to it and say i
[16:58] need this and i need to protect this
[17:00] who gave you that thinking
[17:02] that you have to protect yourself
[17:06] because there's sin in your life no you
[17:07] don't it's not about an image it's about
[17:09] being right with god
[17:14] make sure
[17:15] you know where your affections are set
[17:18] are they set on
[17:19] things of the earth
[17:21] or are they set on things above
[17:25] are we seeking the will of god
[17:27] constantly are we just kind of
[17:30] going forward however we want to go
[17:32] forward whatever we think is best
[17:35] again that's not the heart of a child of
[17:37] god
[17:39] we're we should always be in a position
[17:41] of desperation seeking to know the mind
[17:44] of the lord
[17:45] always should be in that position
[17:49] so again our heart is naturally
[17:52] deceitful
[17:55] so we have to keep our eyes out
[17:57] you know you think of
[17:59] the old days when people were settling
[18:02] across america
[18:03] and they would come and settle in a
[18:05] place and they knew there was danger all
[18:06] around so what did they do they built
[18:08] they built up walls but not only they
[18:10] built up walls then they put a little
[18:12] place for people to watch out watch out
[18:14] and keep and that's really what this is
[18:16] basically saying here
[18:18] is
[18:20] build a guard around you build a
[18:22] garrison around you and then keep watch
[18:24] keep keep watch keep looking the enemy's
[18:27] coming the enemy's coming here he's
[18:29] coming from this direction you have to
[18:31] set up a guard you have to you have to
[18:32] protect him don't let him come in don't
[18:34] even let him get close
[18:36] push him back
[18:38] satan is
[18:39] the bible says he's a mighty hunter
[18:42] right
[18:43] seeking whom he may devour so how
[18:45] necessary it is is it for us to keep a
[18:47] guard keep a watch and be on the lookout
[18:51] for him to come in
[18:53] unfortunately too many times
[18:55] we're looking out and say oh look at
[18:57] that handsome fellow why didn't you come
[18:59] in
[19:01] we do that to ourselves
[19:03] oh yeah
[19:05] we we many times deceive ourselves and
[19:07] say okay that's fine this is no problem
[19:09] i can allow this in my life
[19:11] i can act this way it's not it doesn't
[19:14] hurt anything
[19:15] no that's going to be your destruction
[19:23] all right
[19:28] so then i guess the question comes is
[19:31] how do we do that
[19:33] that's real nice that you're saying we
[19:34] have to do that
[19:36] but how do i go about doing that
[19:38] what's the process what does it look
[19:40] like
[19:41] for me
[19:43] on a daily basis
[19:45] to begin to keep my keep my heart
[19:49] well
[19:50] the way it's the way that scripture is
[19:52] saying it's telling us to keep
[19:55] our heart like it's
[19:56] only up to us is it only up to us
[20:00] thank the lord it's not only up to us
[20:04] it isn't the lord the lord promises to
[20:06] keep us
[20:08] he's he's a shepherd
[20:09] he's our shepherd and he will keep us
[20:12] and there's no one that can pluck us out
[20:13] of his hands
[20:15] there's no one that has the power
[20:17] to do that
[20:19] and yet there still is that commandment
[20:21] to us we have to exert our will
[20:24] our energies
[20:25] our own our power all that we are
[20:28] into this we are supposed to do what
[20:30] love the lord with all our heart all our
[20:32] soul all our mind and all our strength
[20:35] so in keeping our heart we have to do
[20:37] the same exact thing
[20:41] all right brother branham says i think
[20:44] okay yeah
[20:46] he says and it won't work no selfish
[20:49] thing will work
[20:50] your motives and objectives have to be
[20:53] exactly perfectly right
[20:55] then you have faith to ask if our hearts
[20:57] condemn us not then we have confidence
[21:00] see see we've got to have confidence
[21:03] i want this
[21:04] to the honor and glory of god then have
[21:06] faith a channel to move into if it
[21:09] doesn't then you've got mental
[21:11] intellectual faith and not genuine
[21:14] faith from god so here what is he saying
[21:16] he's what i'm and what how is this
[21:17] connect to what i'm talking about it's
[21:19] your motive in your objective
[21:21] many times we want to do the right thing
[21:24] but for the wrong reasons
[21:26] we are our heart motive is different
[21:29] than what god wants our heart motive
[21:31] to be and that we have to go into that
[21:34] place
[21:35] where we
[21:36] are in prayer
[21:38] saying lord search my heart
[21:40] look at what my motive is
[21:43] it's not just well i want to do the
[21:45] right thing because mom and dad will be
[21:46] disappointed
[21:47] no we got to go way beyond that
[21:50] we got to go way beyond that when you're
[21:52] little that might be fine
[21:54] but if you're in this uh sunday school
[21:57] you got to be
[21:58] a little advent more advanced right
[22:01] where you're not thinking well mom you
[22:03] know mom will
[22:05] look at me and be upset or the pastor
[22:08] will be upset
[22:09] no it's
[22:10] you truly who you are
[22:13] in christ who are you
[22:16] who has god made you to be
[22:18] and what is my motive
[22:20] what is my purpose what is my objective
[22:23] in life because if your motive is wrong
[22:25] your heart is wrong
[22:36] psalm 4 3 and 4 but know
[22:38] that the lord has set apart him that is
[22:41] godly for himself
[22:43] the lord will hear when you call unto
[22:46] him stand in awe
[22:48] and sin not commune with your own heart
[22:51] upon your bed
[22:53] and be still
[22:55] i think
[22:56] every time i read this it's so
[22:57] interesting
[22:59] we always talk about communing with the
[23:01] lord
[23:02] but this scripture is telling to commune
[23:04] with your own
[23:06] heart
[23:07] i think i think that's what we're
[23:09] talking about is you're seeking the lord
[23:11] your motive
[23:12] your objective
[23:14] your purpose
[23:15] you're consid you're you're taking time
[23:18] to sit
[23:19] to be still
[23:21] to to feel the greatness of the lord i
[23:23] mean that's what it says the lord will
[23:25] hear when i call unto him stand in awe
[23:28] stand in us so there there is a a place
[23:32] in your quiet place in your secret place
[23:34] where you come and say lord i just want
[23:36] to be in your presence i want to be in
[23:38] awe of you
[23:39] and then when you come to that place
[23:42] don't don't he says sin not
[23:44] but then he says commune with your own
[23:46] heart
[23:48] so what does that mean
[23:51] consider
[23:52] your own life
[23:54] how many times take time just be quiet
[23:56] consider your own life consider your own
[23:58] actions
[23:59] am i speaking the right thing do i have
[24:01] the right attitude
[24:03] do i have the right approach
[24:05] is my heart full of pride or am i am i
[24:08] am i being humble am i walking in
[24:12] in godliness am i praying enough
[24:14] consider your own life
[24:16] i think this is what we're talking about
[24:17] here commune with your own heart upon
[24:19] your bed
[24:20] but thank god it's you're not alone
[24:22] because the presence of god is there and
[24:24] you can say lord search my heart
[24:27] and reveal to me
[24:29] the things that i'm missing what's
[24:31] what's so amazing
[24:33] is how
[24:34] blind we can be
[24:36] to our own faults
[24:38] to our own weaknesses oh my goodness we
[24:40] see
[24:41] so easily
[24:42] the pride of other people we were
[24:43] talking about yesterday brothers you you
[24:45] easily see the pride of others
[24:48] well that's a dangerous thing because
[24:50] if you easily recognize the pride of
[24:52] others it means you
[24:53] and you're upset by it it means you've
[24:56] got pride inside of you
[24:59] the faster you're offended by someone
[25:01] who has who's a prideful person is
[25:03] means that you're
[25:05] in a condition of having pride in your
[25:06] own heart
[25:08] and so that's a that's a danger
[25:11] and we and we don't do that we just we
[25:13] go a long life and we don't think about
[25:16] what's wrong in my heart
[25:18] what's wrong what's
[25:20] what do i have in my life that isn't
[25:22] right with the lord
[25:23] instead of just going on and living and
[25:25] saying well i'm fine i'm doing good i'm
[25:27] doing my best no that's
[25:30] not what we're talking about
[25:31] we're talking about searching your own
[25:33] heart and spending time with god
[25:36] and asking him
[25:38] to show you
[25:39] i mean
[25:40] do any of us want to be
[25:42] walking in
[25:43] a wrong heart in disobedience
[25:47] in rebellion against god
[25:50] i hope not i hope you don't want to
[25:53] so
[25:54] let's take time you know when we pray
[25:57] just to be still
[25:59] and ask the holy spirit to search our
[26:00] hearts and search our lives for
[26:03] ourselves
[26:04] i mean i've i've had to do that a lot
[26:06] lately
[26:08] seeing seeing wrong motives wrong
[26:11] objectives in my own in my own heart and
[26:13] having to repent and saying
[26:16] i'm i'm not right
[26:18] i haven't been right
[26:27] all right
[26:31] this is from 1955 the faith that was
[26:34] once delivered to the saints
[26:37] brother branham says now we wish to turn
[26:39] into the scriptures just for a few
[26:41] moments of meditations on the bible i
[26:43] love the word oh i just wished i could
[26:45] express it you know where i preach my
[26:47] best sermons
[26:49] in my prayer room at home or somewhere
[26:51] in the bed
[26:53] i lay at night time and get anointed
[26:54] with the holy spirit i preach a half a
[26:56] night to myself oh if i could just do it
[26:58] like that in the pulpit but i get too
[27:00] quick too fast
[27:02] and a little bit i run ahead of
[27:04] myself oh if i could just do it like
[27:07] that in the pulpit but i get too quick
[27:08] uh
[27:09] too fast
[27:10] i guess that's because of being nervous
[27:13] and kind of lose my thought but excuse
[27:15] me it'd be too close that it's a good
[27:17] voice
[27:18] i don't you like to get alone with the
[27:20] lord
[27:22] my my just be alone
[27:24] there's sometimes we used to sing a
[27:25] little song
[27:27] sometimes i like to be
[27:29] all alone with christ my lord do you
[27:31] ever hear it i can tell him all my
[27:33] troubles all alone and that's the way he
[27:35] wants to get you alone to himself
[27:38] your prayers not so much as when you're
[27:40] all maybe coming you know for instance
[27:42] be well out in the public when you're
[27:43] praying like in church or on the altar
[27:45] get alone
[27:47] you'll pray a different prayer when
[27:49] you're by yourself than you do when
[27:50] you're in the public slip alone all of
[27:52] you go out
[27:53] and just have a real secret meeting
[27:55] place where you and the lord meet
[27:57] several times a day and pray
[28:00] amen this is where this is where living
[28:03] a victorious life starts
[28:06] you know i think of how brother branham
[28:08] you know he'd go he'd go out into the
[28:10] wilderness and go out into the woods and
[28:13] and go and pray but it was his constant
[28:17] thing in life was he was finding a place
[28:20] to be alone with the lord
[28:22] he would go to this place
[28:24] and go for a nice hike in the woods or
[28:26] in the mountains but what was his real
[28:28] purpose not the hike not the woods it
[28:31] was to be with the lord
[28:32] and i i think we should be in that in
[28:35] that condition in our hearts that we're
[28:36] constantly thinking okay when can i get
[28:38] alone with god when can i go pray we
[28:41] want we want to see god's power in our
[28:43] life we want to see him more manifested
[28:45] i believe it starts right there
[28:51] you know i i'm as i'm saying this it's
[28:53] coming to my mind well i don't even have
[28:55] a desire for that
[28:56] not i'm not saying for myself but maybe
[28:59] somebody's i don't even desire for that
[29:01] i just want to be with my friends i just
[29:03] want to hang out i just want to do this
[29:06] that's great i know i was in that
[29:08] condition one time too
[29:11] but god can change your heart
[29:14] to desire the right things
[29:17] you you want to have
[29:19] a good life
[29:20] you want to have a powerful life you
[29:22] want to have a meaningful life
[29:24] this is where it starts
[29:27] is being a person that spends time alone
[29:30] with god
[29:32] to meet several times a day and pray
[29:34] whenever that's one of the things that i
[29:36] think stands out to me whenever i go
[29:37] through the supernatural
[29:39] series about brother branham's life
[29:43] over and over again he's constantly
[29:45] finding oh okay where is brother branham
[29:47] i don't know he's gone
[29:50] find out later he was off praying
[29:51] somewhere
[29:53] and lord that's what i want to have i
[29:55] want that drive
[29:57] in my heart
[29:59] that it drives me to that place where
[30:02] i'm going i'm wanting to go to pray
[30:05] not not wanting to go and watch the next
[30:07] movie not wanting to go watch the next
[30:09] television show not wanting to just oh i
[30:11] got to just check out in my mind and do
[30:14] do the infinite scroll on facebook but
[30:16] that i set that all aside and say i have
[30:19] a passion
[30:20] a desire to pray
[30:26] matthew 6 5 and 6
[30:29] this should be our main prayer and when
[30:31] thou prayest thou shall not be as the
[30:33] hypocrites are
[30:34] for they love to pray standing in the
[30:36] synagogues and in the corners of the
[30:38] streets that they may be seen of men
[30:41] verily i say unto you they have their
[30:43] reward
[30:44] but thou when thou prayest enter into
[30:46] thy closet when thou has shut thy door
[30:48] pray to thy father which is in secret
[30:51] and thy father which seeth in secret
[30:53] shall reward thee
[30:54] openly jesus goes through that several
[30:57] this same
[30:59] thought with different subjects
[31:02] in the sermon on the mount
[31:05] what do we do what are we what are what
[31:06] is the motive of our heart
[31:08] is it to be seen by people
[31:11] is it to be
[31:12] seen in a certain position in a certain
[31:14] place and people will look at this is
[31:16] religious motives right here
[31:19] what is your motive of your heart
[31:21] if your motive of your heart is to be
[31:23] seen by people and you're seen by people
[31:25] what do you have you have the reward
[31:27] that you wanted
[31:29] but the motive in the heart should to be
[31:32] see god moving
[31:33] in your life in other people's life and
[31:36] if that's the reward that you're looking
[31:38] for god moving in people's lives
[31:40] then don't do things to be seen by
[31:42] people
[31:43] do it
[31:44] to get a lot to go and go in secret
[31:47] do what god wants you to do in secret
[31:50] and let him work openly
[31:52] in front of the people
[31:53] you know that that should be our main
[31:56] all of us as christians not just the
[31:58] preacher
[31:59] not just someone who's never preaches
[32:01] and never does anything in the church
[32:04] that shouldn't matter
[32:06] the best thing you can do for the
[32:08] believers around you
[32:10] is to pray for them
[32:12] and to really have that burden of heart
[32:14] to pray for them if you never preach a
[32:16] sermon
[32:18] if you never lead anything in the church
[32:22] ever
[32:23] if you never reach
[32:24] become a deacon if you if you don't do a
[32:27] thing all you do is come to church if
[32:29] you if you pray
[32:30] for people you're doing the best thing
[32:33] that any of us could do
[32:35] because when when a real believer prays
[32:39] god enters into those prayers and he
[32:41] begins to work in people's lives
[32:44] we know this we know this this is
[32:46] nothing new
[32:47] to any of us this is a reminder
[32:49] for me when i when i went and picked
[32:51] this topic it's something that i've
[32:53] spoken about in the past other places
[32:56] and
[32:57] put together a little differently this
[32:58] time but
