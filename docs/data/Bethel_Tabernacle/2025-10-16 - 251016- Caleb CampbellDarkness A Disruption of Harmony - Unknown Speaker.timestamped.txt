[4:15] [Music]
[4:47] God bless you this morning.
[4:50] Good to be back in church, back in the
[4:52] house of the Lord.
[4:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Gather gathered together. Been
[4:56] missing. love what we did with the camp,
[4:59] but just been missing being in church.
[5:00] Amen. All right, if you just stand with
[5:02] me, we're gonna go ahead and turn into
[5:05] our Bibles. We're going to catch two
[5:06] portions of scripture this morning.
[5:08] We're going to start in Genesis 3. We're
[5:10] going to just catch one verse and then
[5:12] we're going to go all the way to the
[5:14] other side in 1 John.
[5:17] Genesis chapter 3
[5:21] and verses 8.
[5:27] And they heard the voice of the Lord God
[5:30] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[5:32] day. And Adam and his wife hid
[5:35] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[5:37] God amongst the trees of the garden.
[5:41] And then if you turn to First John
[5:43] chapter 1,
[5:48] 1 John chapter 1 and then verses 5
[5:51] through7, we're going to just catch
[5:53] this. Then is the message which we have
[5:55] heard of him and declare unto you that
[5:57] God is light and in him is no darkness
[6:01] at all.
[6:03] If we say that we have fellowship with
[6:05] him and walk in darkness, we lie and we
[6:09] do not the truth. But if we walk in the
[6:12] light as he is in the light, we have
[6:14] fellowship one with another and the
[6:16] blood of Jesus Christ, his son, cleanses
[6:19] us from all sins.
[6:22] Let's just go to the Lord in prayer. Our
[6:23] heavenly father, we just thank you for
[6:24] this opportunity to be in the house of
[6:26] the Lord this morning. Father, we just
[6:28] pray that you just open up the word to
[6:30] us in this little lesson this morning.
[6:31] Father, speak to our hearts. Lord,
[6:33] prepare our hearts this morning for the
[6:36] ministering of the word. Lord God, help
[6:37] us just to worship, Father God, the way
[6:39] that you've intended it to be, Father,
[6:41] in spirit and in truth. We love you. We
[6:43] just commit all these things to you in
[6:44] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And
[6:47] amen. God bless you this morning. Take
[6:49] your seats. Um, this little thought this
[6:52] morning is just uh I'm going to title it
[6:54] darkness with a subtitle of a disruption
[6:57] of harmony. Amen. Darkness with a
[6:59] disruption of harmony.
[7:02] I was looking at that passage there in
[7:03] Genesis and one thing that you can
[7:05] really begin to recognize is that you
[7:08] know of course that in the garden there
[7:10] there was a complete heart a harmony
[7:13] between God, between Adam, between Adam,
[7:16] between Eve. There was a perfect order
[7:18] before this event took place. There was
[7:20] just a harmony between everything. And
[7:22] then there was this disruption that
[7:24] occurred. There was a disruption in
[7:26] harmony. And the Lord's just been
[7:28] dealing with me on this subject,
[7:30] harmony, lately that, you know, there
[7:32] was a harmony with the word. There was a
[7:35] harmony with each other. And uh and the
[7:38] idea that he wants us to get back into
[7:41] is he wants us to get back into that
[7:43] harmony. Amen. Brother Benham said in
[7:45] the church age book that there was a
[7:47] harmony between
[7:49] God and the son. There was a harmony
[7:51] between Jesus and the father. And that
[7:53] same harmony is now is supposed to now
[7:57] exist between the bride and her groom.
[8:00] Right? Amen. And so when I'm talking
[8:02] this morning about darkness, don't let
[8:05] your minds trail off a into thinking
[8:08] that it's some kind of great sin or or
[8:10] great some big big thing in your life.
[8:12] Darkness is anything that keeps you out
[8:15] of harmony with our father. Anything
[8:18] that has the potential to disrupt that
[8:20] harmony that we're supposed to have with
[8:22] our bridegroom. That's what I'm talking
[8:24] about this morning.
[8:26] The Bible says it like this. Search me,
[8:28] oh God. Know my heart and know my
[8:30] thoughts and see if there be any wicked
[8:32] way in me. Any wicked way. Something in
[8:36] the garden had come in between these
[8:39] intimate relationships. The word calls
[8:41] it the tree of knowledge. Amen. And when
[8:44] Eve parttook of that first sin, God
[8:47] referred to it as a tree or the tree of
[8:48] knowledge. Uh because or the tree of
[8:50] life, the other side because it was it
[8:52] wasn't just one act of sin. It wasn't
[8:55] just one isolated incident. It was um
[8:58] you know was the act of idolatry uh
[9:01] adultery and it was that. But it was a
[9:04] fruitbearing tree because it wasn't just
[9:07] that. It was something that produced
[9:10] havoc in the garden that produced havoc
[9:12] in their lives, right? And that's what
[9:15] sin is. Brother Brandham always says
[9:17] that smoking and drinking and all those
[9:18] things, those are attributes of sin. But
[9:21] it's not necessarily sin. Those are just
[9:23] the attributes of sin. The devil isn't
[9:25] necessarily going to try to get you to
[9:27] commit adultery like he did with Eve.
[9:29] But what he will do is he's going to
[9:31] implant thoughts in your mind that are
[9:34] designed to disrupt disrupt your
[9:37] fellowship and your harmony with God.
[9:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; And that's an important point. I want to
[9:41] repeat that. He isn't going to implant
[9:43] thoughts in your mind that are designed
[9:46] he he is going to implant thoughts in
[9:47] your mind that are designed to disrupt
[9:49] your fellowship and your harmony with
[9:50] God. He he tries to impregnate those
[9:53] things in your mind. And then what
[9:54] happens is eventually those thoughts
[9:57] manifest into your actions. Eve lost
[10:00] that battle in her mind, in her thoughts
[10:02] before it ever became an act of
[10:04] adultery. Amen. And by the time that it
[10:06] was actually acted out in her life, it
[10:09] it wre havoc in the garden. It wre havoc
[10:12] in their life. It wre havoc. And I was
[10:14] reading this book and you know there's
[10:16] so many things that you know that that
[10:18] they had to deal with after that fall
[10:20] that they never even had they didn't
[10:22] have an understanding of. You know there
[10:24] was a there was envy that that came in.
[10:26] There was a shame that came in. There
[10:28] were these thoughts of of possible
[10:30] jealousy that came in. They didn't have
[10:31] to deal with those things before. And
[10:34] all of that was because of the action
[10:36] the fruit bearing uh the the the bearing
[10:39] of the fruit of that sin. Amen.
[10:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Those thoughts that he tries to
[10:45] implant in your mind, they become idols
[10:47] that you begin serving. You can serve
[10:49] him in your time. You can serve him in
[10:51] your entertainment, in your lack, and it
[10:53] becomes a lack of fellowship with God.
[10:55] Idols are just anything that you put in
[10:58] the place of serving God.
[11:00] &gt;&gt; You know, people can actually be serving
[11:02] idols in their mind and they may not
[11:04] even be realizing it because what
[11:05] happens is is those thoughts that come
[11:07] from the enemy, they come from Satan.
[11:09] thoughts of enemy, envy, thoughts
[11:11] against people, thoughts of discontent.
[11:13] We feed those thoughts and by the time
[11:15] that it actually manifests in your
[11:17] actions, then you've already lost the
[11:19] battle because you lost it in your mind.
[11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; I was reading this book I was reading
[11:24] from. I'm going to quote it several
[11:25] times. And it was talking about on the
[11:27] long lines of this subject. It talked
[11:29] about the effects of that first sin. And
[11:31] one of the first effects of that sin
[11:34] that we read here was that it made Adam
[11:36] and Eve hide behind the trees. You know,
[11:39] they were hiding in these dark places.
[11:42] There had always been a transparency
[11:46] and a harmony with God and one another.
[11:48] There was never any reason to hide,
[11:51] right? But see, when darkness had crept
[11:53] in, something had changed. And there was
[11:56] this feeling in them that they wanted to
[11:58] hide. They were ashamed. They recognized
[12:00] their nakedness. And the Bible says it
[12:02] in a distinct way. It says that they
[12:03] were hiding themselves from the presence
[12:06] of the Lord God because
[12:10] you know and one of the things that it
[12:11] still does today and it did then is once
[12:15] that darkness crept into their heart, it
[12:18] tried to get them to cover themselves to
[12:21] somehow cover the sin that they
[12:22] committed or to cover the wrongdoing.
[12:24] And that's what human nature God is. God
[12:27] is showing us the human nature side of
[12:29] things is if when we're fall when we're
[12:32] in of a fallen nature, we follow after
[12:35] that pattern of our parents. We follow
[12:37] after that pattern. We try to hide
[12:39] ourselves. We try to cover that thing.
[12:41] We have things that happen in our lives.
[12:43] And God wants transparency in our life.
[12:46] He wants you to be transparent with him.
[12:48] He already knows what you're going
[12:50] through. He already knows the things
[12:51] that you're dealing with. He wants you
[12:53] to be transparent with him so that light
[12:55] can shine in that darkness. Amen.
[12:57] Because anything that keeps you out of
[12:59] harmony with your father is darkness. So
[13:02] if there's anything in your heart,
[13:04] anything in your mind that you haven't
[13:06] allowed the light of the Lord to shine
[13:07] on in your life, it's a disruption in
[13:10] your life with the Lord. And we
[13:12] shouldn't want anything. Amen. We
[13:13] shouldn't want anything to disrupt that.
[13:16] And there was a there was a pattern that
[13:18] Adam and Eve had set and they tried to
[13:20] cover themselves. And I just I thought
[13:22] it was important to realize that that
[13:24] when something does happen in your life,
[13:26] you make a mistake. You probably made
[13:28] some today. I know I probably made some
[13:30] today. You made some yesterday. You slip
[13:32] up. You do some kind of wrong. Those
[13:33] things are going to happen. Amen. We do
[13:35] have the flesh that we're supposed to
[13:36] bring into subjection to the Holy Ghost
[13:39] that lives in our souls, right? We're
[13:40] supposed to bring that thing into
[13:41] subjection, but it does slip up.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; And what we've got to do is we've got to
[13:46] fight against our own human nature in
[13:48] that. Amen. And it's the battle that
[13:49] happens within to not keep that thing
[13:52] hidden in your heart.
[13:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; To not keep that thing hidden in your
[13:57] heart. We have to fight against that
[13:59] nature. Transparency just by definition
[14:03] this morning, it it's the quality of
[14:05] allowing light to pass through so that
[14:08] objects behind can be distinctly seen.
[14:13] So again, God wants us to be transparent
[14:15] so that darkness can be exposed. And the
[14:18] only way to expel darkness and get rid
[14:20] of it is to expose light to it. And um
[14:23] I'm we're going to read a couple
[14:25] passages of scripture here this morning.
[14:28] Um let's see, let's go to First John.
[14:30] We're going to actually start at verse
[14:31] three and then read all of those. First
[14:33] John chapter 1 and it and we'll start at
[14:36] verse three. And if you read the heading
[14:38] in my Bible, uh uh in the my King James
[14:41] study Bible, you'll read above the verse
[14:44] and it actually says in parenthesis, it
[14:47] says the conditions of fellowship. And
[14:49] then underneath that, it says the walk
[14:52] in the light. So we're talking about the
[14:54] disruption of harmony.
[14:56] And verse three, it says that which we
[14:59] have seen and declare unto you, that ye
[15:02] also may have fellowship with us. and
[15:04] truly our fellowship is with the father
[15:06] and his son Jesus Christ.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; And these things we write unto you that
[15:11] your joy may be full. This then is the
[15:14] message which we have heard of him and
[15:16] declare unto you that God is light and
[15:20] in him is no darkness at all.
[15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we say that we have fellowship
[15:27] with him and walk in darkness, we lie
[15:31] and we do not the truth. So verse six,
[15:35] if we say that we're in fellowship with
[15:37] the father,
[15:41] lie, we do not the truth. Lying isn't
[15:44] always as surface level as people make
[15:46] it out to be. You can lie to yourself.
[15:49] You can, and we're going to get that
[15:50] into this next verse. You can actually
[15:52] deceive yourself into thinking that
[15:54] you're in right standing with the Lord
[15:55] somehow and you're lying to yourself
[15:57] because there's something in your heart
[15:59] that still hasn't the light still hasn't
[16:01] shined in on that place. And we don't
[16:03] want to lie to ourselves. We don't want
[16:05] to have a disruption in our harmony with
[16:07] the father. Amen. And we'll catch that
[16:09] in verse eight. says, "If we say that we
[16:14] um if we say that we have no sin, we
[16:17] deceive ourselves and the truth is not
[16:20] in us." Now, there's there's a
[16:24] there's a a balance here because, you
[16:26] know, we have to make sure to know that
[16:28] in order for the light to be living in
[16:30] us, we've got to have the the Holy Ghost
[16:32] living in our soul. But then what
[16:34] happens is sometimes darkness can creep
[16:36] into our flesh or into our spirit. And
[16:38] so we have to allow the light of the
[16:40] Lord, God is light, it says, right? So
[16:42] God lives in our soul to allow that
[16:44] light to shine into those dark places to
[16:47] shine into those places in our life, to
[16:49] shine into areas of our spirit and our
[16:52] flesh that may not be under complete
[16:54] subjection yet to the Holy Ghost.
[16:56] Because the idea is that we need to get
[16:58] into complete subjection to the Holy
[17:00] Ghost. Amen. That's what I want in my
[17:02] life. Amen.
[17:04] And so in reality, there might be some
[17:07] darkness that that is residing in us
[17:09] that that we're that we're keeping that
[17:11] area in our height our hearts away from
[17:13] the light, away from exposure to the
[17:16] light. Amen. Um verse 9, it says, "If we
[17:21] confess our sins, he is faithful and
[17:23] just to forgive us and to cleanse us
[17:26] from all unrighteousness. If we say that
[17:28] we have not sinned, we make him a liar
[17:30] and his word is not in us.
[17:33] I I had see read this statement the
[17:35] other day. I thought it was just
[17:36] powerful. It says, "What is meant by
[17:39] light and darkness is that light reveals
[17:43] and darkness hides."
[17:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; And there in that uh we're going to
[17:48] catch Ephesians a couple verses in
[17:50] Ephesians and it says that when anything
[17:54] reproves us, King James uses the word
[17:56] reprove which means convicts and exposes
[17:59] fault. So when anything reproves us or
[18:03] convicts us or exposes fault in our
[18:06] life, it shows us what we really are and
[18:10] that is light. Does that make sense?
[18:13] When anything reproves us, so when the
[18:15] Lord brings conviction in our life and
[18:17] it doesn't matter if it's a big thing or
[18:19] a small thing, whatever he brings
[18:21] conviction, it's supposed to expose
[18:23] fault in our life and it shows us what
[18:26] we really are and it's supposed to not
[18:28] keep us there. We we don't want to stay
[18:30] in that place when he exposes that
[18:31] thing. We want to move further. We I
[18:33] want to I want to grow. He talked about
[18:35] the mountain of God. We want to continue
[18:37] to ascend to the place that the Lord
[18:39] wants us to be in. Amen.
[18:41] &gt;&gt; We're going to um it quotes Ephesians 5,
[18:44] this excerpt that I read. So, we're
[18:45] going to go let's turn in our Bibles to
[18:47] Ephesians. We're doing a Bible study
[18:48] this morning. So, gonna do some verses.
[18:51] Ephesians chapter 5
[18:55] and um catch this in a second. It says
[18:58] in this in this we're going to start at
[19:01] verses 8
[19:06] and before we start reading that just a
[19:08] comment that it makes it whatsoever doth
[19:10] make manifest as light which is what
[19:12] we're going to read in there but
[19:13] whenever we say or do anything or in
[19:17] contrast to that whenever we don't say
[19:20] or don't do something and the objective
[19:23] behind that is to hide what we've done
[19:26] or what we haven't done to correct that
[19:29] error. That is darkness. So that brings
[19:31] it down to us today in the the the flesh
[19:34] man that we live in. If we say or do
[19:36] something that covers us like it did
[19:39] Eve, that it that it exposes that nature
[19:41] and we don't want it to, then that is
[19:44] darkness. Or if in in contra distinction
[19:48] to that in the opposite if we don't say
[19:51] or we don't do something that is going
[19:54] to keep that thing hidden in your heart
[19:56] that is darkness. So these are just
[19:58] applicable points this morning. If we
[20:00] look at verses um verses 8 in Ephesians
[20:03] 5
[20:05] for ye were sometimes darkness
[20:08] but now ye are light in the Lord. Walk
[20:11] as children of the light, for the fruit
[20:14] of the spirit is in all goodness and
[20:17] righteousness and truth, proving what is
[20:20] acceptable unto the Lord. And we have no
[20:24] fellowship with the unfruitful works of
[20:28] darkness, but rather we do what? We
[20:32] rather reprove them. So, we're not
[20:35] supposed to have fellowship with the
[20:37] unfruitful works of darkness, but what
[20:40] what are we supposed to do? We're
[20:41] supposed to expose those areas in our
[20:44] life. We're supposed to expose those
[20:46] areas that may be uncomfortable to
[20:49] expose. It may not feel good to say,
[20:52] "Lord, I'm wrong." It may not feel good
[20:54] to say, "Lord, I did have that thought,
[20:56] but I want to bring that thing into
[20:57] subjection." Because a lot of times the
[20:59] enemy brings implants thoughts into your
[21:02] mind. They're not your thoughts. They're
[21:03] the enemy's thoughts. So, it's our job
[21:06] as believers to take that thing,
[21:07] recognize that it's not the word, that's
[21:09] not you, that's the enemy. You put that
[21:12] thing into subjection. But sometimes
[21:14] what happens is if you keep feeding that
[21:16] thought, Lord, I that's not me, right?
[21:18] No, that is not you. You put that thing
[21:21] into subjection. Amen. But sometimes
[21:23] what the devil will do is then he'll
[21:24] bring another thought and say, "Well, I
[21:26] can't believe you'd think like that. I
[21:27] can't believe you do that. I I can't I
[21:29] thought you were a believer. I thought
[21:30] you were a Christian." And you're saying
[21:32] that and you're doing that. That is the
[21:34] enemy in your mind. You bring that
[21:35] thing. You expose that darkness. You
[21:38] say, "Devil, that wasn't me. That was
[21:40] you. Lord, I know you know that that
[21:42] wasn't me. If it was me, Lord, forgive
[21:45] me. Forgive me of that thing and help me
[21:47] move on. Expose that darkness in your
[21:52] heart." Amen.
[21:55] &gt;&gt; Reproving something. What does that
[21:57] mean? H how do how do we go about doing
[21:59] that? It it's it's a it's a repentant
[22:03] heart. Repentant heart. The the the I
[22:06] mean the the the start of salvation is
[22:09] repentance. You have to have a repentant
[22:11] heart. You know, you have to be able to
[22:13] come to the Lord and say that I Lord, I
[22:16] forgive me of these things. I I I know
[22:18] I've been wrong. And then the Lord is
[22:20] faithful and just to cleanse you of that
[22:24] unrighteousness. Aren't you glad for
[22:25] that?
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:28] So, so being in right standing with God
[22:32] is a heart that and I had done this. I I
[22:35] always go back to this because I I love
[22:37] this when when I did the Sunday school
[22:39] on angles and that story that that
[22:42] brother Random tells about that that man
[22:45] that uh there's this sculpture and you
[22:47] look at the sculpture headon or when
[22:49] you're looking at it and Jesus is in
[22:51] front of you, you don't always see the
[22:53] fullness of the picture. You don't
[22:55] always see what he's done for you. You
[22:56] don't always see it, but the sculptor
[22:58] knew that. And so he put a little
[23:00] kneeling uh uh uh table right in front
[23:04] of it. And so when you kneel down and
[23:06] you look up at Jesus, you're able to see
[23:09] the blood that he shed for you. You're
[23:11] able to see the scars. It it it you
[23:14] couldn't but come to tears because it
[23:17] was the angle at which you're looking at
[23:19] it. And when you come to the Lord with a
[23:21] humble heart and you and you expose
[23:23] yourself and you recognize that you're
[23:25] down here, God's up here, and you look
[23:27] up to him, that is what true repentance
[23:29] looks like. That is what humility looks
[23:32] like.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; Is recognizing my faults, repenting of
[23:36] those things, and then exposing the
[23:39] darkness in my heart and allowing the
[23:42] light to be made manifest. And this is a
[23:44] continual process that has to happen in
[23:46] our lives. It's not just you do it one
[23:48] time. You know, repentance is is an
[23:51] everyday act that we have to come into.
[23:53] We bring our bodies and our spirit into
[23:56] subjection to the Lord. Amen.
[24:00] Spurgeon defines it as defines walking
[24:04] in the light as and this is powerful the
[24:06] willingness to know and to be known. So
[24:11] think of that for a minute. the
[24:12] willingness. Walking in the light is the
[24:14] willingness to know who I am, the
[24:17] thoughts that I've thought, and to be
[24:20] known to be able to expose yourself to
[24:24] to the Lord. And if you have a wrong
[24:26] that you've done against a brother or
[24:28] sister, expose that thing to them as
[24:30] well because walking in the light, I
[24:32] mean, the first John, you know, it talks
[24:35] about having fellowship not only with
[24:37] God, but having fellowship with one
[24:39] another. I I've been this is a kind of a
[24:41] sermon I'm working on, but talking about
[24:42] the harmony that the Lord has. He has it
[24:45] with with us. We're supposed to be in
[24:47] harmony with the Lord, right? We're
[24:49] supposed to be in harmony with our
[24:50] groom. And that also is a harmony that
[24:52] we're supposed to have with with the
[24:54] bride because Christ is in you. Christ
[24:57] is in you. Christ is in you. Christ is
[24:58] in me. So, as we get closer to Christ,
[25:02] we should be able to have a harmony with
[25:04] one another.
[25:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:08] And it means that we are to open uh to
[25:12] we are open to know the whole truth
[25:13] about ourselves
[25:15] because because God knows the whole
[25:18] truth about us.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? He knows the whole
[25:22] truth about you. He knows the mistake
[25:24] you made yesterday. He knows the wrongs
[25:26] that you've done. He knows the thoughts.
[25:27] I mean, he knows all of it. He knows
[25:29] that. Now, he's waiting for you to
[25:33] reprove those things. He's waiting for
[25:35] you to expose those things. He won't
[25:37] press you. He won't make you do it, but
[25:38] he he'll convict you. He He He'll do
[25:41] that. And then the more that still small
[25:43] voice in your heart, the more you do
[25:44] that thing, and I'm going to hopefully I
[25:46] can get to this. Um sorry, I keep
[25:49] trailing off. Let me just stick to my
[25:50] notes here.
[25:52] Um
[25:56] sometimes we can get into a state like
[25:59] Eve was in where we would rather have
[26:02] that thing hidden and maybe justify it
[26:05] somehow. you know, try to try to produce
[26:07] a covering, try to try to because it,
[26:10] you know, it seems easier that way
[26:12] sometimes or or you know, we're
[26:13] sometimes we're we're we're nervous,
[26:15] we're afraid, we're whatever the case
[26:17] is, it's just easier in our human nature
[26:20] to do that. But what God wants is he
[26:23] wants that thing to be exposed. Um, and
[26:26] just think of think of your just put
[26:28] these some of these notes I wrote. Think
[26:30] of your heart as the garden this
[26:32] morning. He knows that there are things
[26:33] that are hidden and he calls out to you.
[26:35] You know that next verse, he's calling
[26:37] out to them. And it's not that he didn't
[26:38] know, pastor was saying this, brother
[26:41] Matt was saying this um in his Sunday
[26:43] school. It's not that he didn't know
[26:44] where they were. It's it's that he
[26:47] wanted he he didn't he didn't know how
[26:49] they got to where they were. Why Why did
[26:51] you How did you get to this place? How
[26:53] did you get We were in such harmony with
[26:55] one another. We were we were in there
[26:57] was such a cohesion. There was such a
[26:59] There was What? How did this disruption
[27:02] occur? He was calling out. So, there's
[27:06] got to be exposure and transparency so
[27:09] his light can expose those things. Um,
[27:12] and remember, I had said this at the
[27:13] beginning. Don't think of darkness as
[27:14] just being the evil things, you know,
[27:16] just terrible evil things. It is that,
[27:19] but it can also be more subtle than
[27:21] that. It's just anything that or
[27:23] anywhere that the light is not shining
[27:25] on in your life. Anything that's causing
[27:27] that disruption. And some of these
[27:29] statements, I wanted to try to read
[27:30] these statements because I thought they
[27:32] were so powerful
[27:34] from this excerpt of this book. It's
[27:36] called the Calvary Road. The first
[27:37] effect of sin in our lives is always to
[27:40] try is always to make us try and hide
[27:42] what we are. Sin made our fir first
[27:46] parents hide behind the trees of the
[27:48] garden and it has the same effect on us
[27:50] ever since.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; Catch this. He says, "Sin always
[27:54] involves us in being unreal, pretending,
[28:00] duplicity." I wanted to speak on that
[28:02] word for just a minute. Duplicity means
[28:04] deceitfulness or being twofaced. Acting
[28:08] one way when you're at church and
[28:10] another way when you're at work, acting
[28:12] one way when you're at church and
[28:13] another way when you're at home. What
[28:15] What does your life look like behind
[28:17] closed doors? I I see it when you're at
[28:19] church, but what about when you get
[28:21] behind the door? What What about in your
[28:23] private life? What does your life look
[28:24] like
[28:25] &gt;&gt; to the Lord there? What is there a
[28:27] harmony that you have with the Lord in
[28:29] your private life? Amen. I know that
[28:32] really that that really cuts home today.
[28:34] But that's where the Lord wants to get
[28:36] to. He wants to get into that secret
[28:37] compartment in your heart and fellowship
[28:40] with you there. Of course, he's going to
[28:41] fellowship with you there. He's going to
[28:42] bring conviction of the word here. He's
[28:44] going to do those things here. But what
[28:46] are you doing? Are you two-faced? Is
[28:47] there duplicity in your life? Or are you
[28:50] being unreal? I mean, because coming to
[28:52] church and have putting on a show,
[28:54] that's unreal. I mean, it, you know, it
[28:56] doesn't affect me. It may it may affect
[28:58] your brother. I mean, it may. It may,
[29:00] but it doesn't have a monumental effect
[29:02] on me. It has a monumental effect on you
[29:04] and your harmony to the Lord. Amen.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; It involves excusing ourselves and
[29:12] blaming others. That's a big one. And we
[29:15] can all do that as much by our silence
[29:19] as by saying or doing something.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; It involves excusing ourselves and
[29:24] blaming others. There is always I think
[29:26] I put this statement. I hope I did.
[29:30] There is always going to be I guess I I
[29:33] I didn't put it in there. There is
[29:34] always going to be someone to blame for
[29:37] what you've done wrong.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's always you can always
[29:40] justify it. There's always going to be
[29:42] but what about putting your finger back
[29:44] and Lord you know maybe they did say
[29:46] this but the introspection that happens
[29:48] in yourself in your life how can I grow
[29:51] from this you know pointing your finger
[29:54] back at this guy right
[29:59] the willingness to know and be known and
[30:01] as far as as far as God is concerned
[30:04] this means that we are willing to know
[30:07] the whole truth about ourselves
[30:10] &gt;&gt; we are open to conviction. And catch
[30:13] this, this is powerful. Everything that
[30:16] he shows us to be sin, we will deal with
[30:20] as sin, we will hide or excuse nothing.
[30:25] You know, I there's a balance there. You
[30:27] can't, you know, it's not a legalism,
[30:30] okay? It's not it's not it's not a
[30:32] legalistic view of things. But when the
[30:35] Lord is exposing things in your life,
[30:38] maybe from the outside someone might
[30:40] say, "Well, whoa, they're making a lot
[30:41] of changes." But look, you're in harmony
[30:44] with the father and he is trying to get
[30:46] you to the place that you need to be.
[30:48] Amen. He's trying to convict you in your
[30:50] heart. And what happens the closer you
[30:52] get to that fire, I talked about this in
[30:54] the service, the closer you get to that
[30:55] pillar of fire, the more things that are
[30:57] burned away from you that you don't
[30:59] want. Brother uh Paul talks about that
[31:01] all things are expedient. That has meant
[31:03] so much more to me lately because all
[31:05] things can be expedient. You can have
[31:07] things in your life that are harmless,
[31:09] but if there's a disruption in your
[31:11] harmony with the father because of that
[31:12] thing, then I don't want it in my life
[31:14] anymore.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; I thought that part was just so good.
[31:19] Such a walk in the light cannot but
[31:22] disclose sin increasingly in our lives.
[31:26] And we shall see things to be sin which
[31:29] we never thought to be such before.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; Right? because it's a disruption in
[31:33] harmony.
[31:35] And for this reason, this is my last
[31:38] last statement here. And for this
[31:39] reason, we might shrink from this walk
[31:42] and be tempted to make for cover.
[31:46] I don't want to shrink from that walk. I
[31:48] don't want to Are we willing to have
[31:51] that kind of walk with the Lord? Amen.
[31:53] But the first goes on to say, "And the
[31:55] blood of Jesus Christ, his son, cleanses
[31:57] us from all sin." And it goes on to say
[32:00] that everything that the light of God
[32:02] shows us of as sin, we confess and carry
[32:05] it to the fountain of blood and it's
[32:08] gone. Gone from God's sight and gone
[32:11] from our hearts. Once that light can
[32:14] expose that thing, it's gone from God's
[32:17] sight. It's gone from our hearts
[32:19] forever. Amen. Amen. Let's pray.
[32:23] Heavenly Father, we just thank you for
[32:24] this morning. We thank you for the word,
[32:26] Lord. We just ask that you just come and
[32:27] minister to our our hearts through the
[32:29] uh the ministry of uh of worship this
[32:31] morning as we just prepare our hearts to
[32:34] receive your word. May you just be with
[32:36] uh pastor as he just brings forth the
[32:38] word. Lord God, may you just be with us,
[32:39] Lord. Give us uh ears to hear, eyes to
[32:41] see. Father, we love you. We commit
[32:43] everything to you now in the name of
[32:44] Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you. Amen.
