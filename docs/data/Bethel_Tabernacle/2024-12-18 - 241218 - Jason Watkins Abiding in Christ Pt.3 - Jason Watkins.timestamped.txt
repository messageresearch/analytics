[36:23] a little bit it's for context I have one
[36:26] quote that is quite lengthy and so I've
[36:29] put that on the overhead we won't pull
[36:31] that up just yet uh we'll get to that
[36:34] just in a little bit amen I'll have this
[36:36] ready to go and we'll catch that just in
[36:39] a little bit all right so now our our
[36:42] our title tonight or I'm sorry our text
[36:44] our opening text was Proverbs 18:10 the
[36:47] name of the Lord is a strong tower the
[36:50] righteous runneth into it and is safe
[36:54] now I either I some somehow had not ever
[36:58] caught it and maybe because it wasn't so
[37:01] burning in my heart concerning abiding
[37:04] in Christ either I either I never caught
[37:07] it or I had forgotten until I read this
[37:10] quote that brother brandham is actually
[37:14] actually links Proverbs 18 verse 10 this
[37:19] Strong Tower and he links it to where
[37:22] we've been reading in St John 15 where
[37:25] Jesus said abide in me and you're going
[37:28] to hear brother brandham say he's that
[37:30] strong tower abide that's the Strong
[37:32] Tower that you run into and are safe he
[37:35] says from 1962 letting off the pressure
[37:39] what a consolation it is this hour when
[37:43] the people of the world church members
[37:48] running from place to place trying to
[37:51] find a refuge and they say now here's
[37:54] what here's what is commonly said one
[37:56] will say well you have to recite our
[37:59] Creed the other one will say you have to
[38:02] join our church but but for that
[38:06] believer who comes now catch this
[38:08] language for that believer who just
[38:12] comes calmly and receives the Holy Ghost
[38:17] and watch every promise of God made
[38:20] manifest among them they don't have to
[38:22] run from here to there they can just let
[38:26] off the steam
[38:28] see they don't have to run from here to
[38:30] there they that's right sit down catch
[38:34] this language set down it's all over God
[38:38] got it made then letting off the
[38:41] pressure is that amazing in this hour
[38:44] where men's hearts are failing for fear
[38:48] there's a place where you can just
[38:50] calmly come to the holy spirit let off
[38:52] the pressure just
[38:56] oh he loves me I am my beloveds and he
[39:00] is mine what does it matter anyway and
[39:02] the brother brandham said you can just
[39:04] calmly come to the Holy Ghost and and
[39:06] take every promise and Christ will make
[39:08] it manifest you don't have to run good
[39:11] news good news you don't have to run
[39:13] from here to there you don't have to
[39:14] recite a Creed you don't have to belong
[39:16] to a certain church you can just sit
[39:18] down and relax in
[39:22] Christ so here's where he makes the
[39:24] connection he goes on the name of the
[39:26] Lord this this is our text the name of
[39:29] the Lord is a mighty tower when the
[39:33] righteous run into it are safe what kind
[39:37] of a tower did you ever know brother
[39:39] Brandon's going to identify the tower
[39:41] what kind of a tower it's a tower of
[39:44] Refuge we can go in there and he says
[39:47] his in the very next paragraph if ye
[39:51] abide in me the
[39:55] Tower if you abide in me the Tower when
[40:00] the righteous run into it they're safe
[40:03] what kind of a tower see so he he's
[40:06] going on my if you abide in me the Tower
[40:09] my words abide in you now that's when
[40:13] you're on the
[40:16] inside abide in see not when you're out
[40:21] there looking in but when you're in here
[40:24] looking
[40:25] out when if you abide in me my words
[40:30] abide in you you can ask what you
[40:35] will we are living in a day where you're
[40:38] going to need access to that kind of
[40:41] power where you're going to have to find
[40:44] yourself in situations it's in Prophecy
[40:47] we're not going to escape at all we are
[40:49] going into a Rapture the tribulation
[40:51] can't come until uh this bride is gone
[40:54] brother brandom's seventh vision of
[40:56] annihilation cannot happen till we're
[40:58] gone but there are things that you're
[41:00] going to need to be able to go to God
[41:02] and say I need this and and and because
[41:05] you're abiding in Christ you're safe
[41:09] you're calm you're relaxed when the
[41:11] world is falling apart you're
[41:17] not I
[41:19] remember reading to you and I gave you
[41:21] the the math and the statistics from
[41:24] Annie Jacobson on nuclear Deton and we
[41:27] did we we went through her her material
[41:30] on what a just a one Megaton nuclear
[41:33] detonation falling on Washington DC
[41:35] would would the effect that would have
[41:37] and it left us a gas and we I remember
[41:41] we we sat here and I knew it was coming
[41:43] cuz I had already listened to it I knew
[41:45] you didn't know and I watched the shock
[41:48] hit your face and some of you even
[41:50] commented to me after the most shocking
[41:52] part is after she takes probably 10
[41:55] minutes and starts talking about about
[41:57] the almost unimaginable destruction and
[42:01] death and the Heat and the annihilation
[42:03] and the buildings and the atmosphere and
[42:05] millions of people are dying and the and
[42:07] the and the and the energy is is moving
[42:10] out and it's crossing the Beltway it's
[42:12] moving on out into Virginia up into
[42:14] Maryland and it's still going and after
[42:16] about 10 minutes of death in Mayhem she
[42:18] says we're now three
[42:21] seconds after detonation amen and that
[42:25] blew my mind 3 seconds
[42:27] in brother brandham
[42:30] says because he was living in an age
[42:33] where there was a big nuclear scare and
[42:35] everybody was wanting to build you know
[42:38] cellers and build bomb shelters down
[42:40] into the ground and brother brandham
[42:43] said an atomic bomb would ever blast
[42:45] this place it would go so deep into the
[42:47] ground it would break every bone in your
[42:49] body there would be no safety in a bomb
[42:52] shelter there'd be no there's going to
[42:55] be no safety in Mount Shasta I'm sorry
[42:58] but everything is going to Ash and
[43:00] Cinder I'm glad there's a tower of
[43:03] safety that's nuke proof bomb proof
[43:06] destruction proof penetration proof I
[43:09] can go in there and I can look out on
[43:12] the Mayhem of the world and I can rest
[43:15] in peace and
[43:18] safety this is actually the sermon where
[43:21] you've heard me say many times that
[43:26] tremendous judgments are rushing to meet
[43:29] us and the only way out is up you've
[43:32] heard me say that that's actually
[43:34] brother Bram say says that here in this
[43:36] sermon There's No Escape only
[43:40] up there's no Escape only up get away
[43:44] from me yes sir how how do you get up
[43:48] that's what I need to know okay you've
[43:50] convinced me the only way out is to go
[43:53] up how do I go up he says go down first
[43:58] amen that's right go down confess your
[44:01] sins believe on the Lord Jesus Christ be
[44:04] buried with him in baptism rise in his
[44:08] resurrection with the Holy Spirit lifts
[44:10] you up above the cares above the worries
[44:14] above the unbelief of the world it
[44:16] doesn't just Lift Me Up Above the sin
[44:18] and the unbelief it lifts me up above
[44:20] the cares and above the worries and
[44:22] above the stresses and above the
[44:24] problems I'm lifted up above the shadows
[44:26] of this broken
[44:28] world the name of the Lord the spirit
[44:31] lifts you up above it yes that's it the
[44:34] name of the Lord is a mighty
[44:37] tower a mighty rock in a weary land amen

[44:47] yeah the righteous run into
[44:50] it and are saved we thank God for that
[44:54] what a contrast what what contrast and
[44:57] how very different it is from having to
[45:01] recite a Creed or having to join a
[45:06] church brother venom goes on here in the
[45:08] message God keeps his word part one in
[45:12] 1957 he says listen brother now catch

[46:50] saved because you feel like you're
[46:55] saved I'm not saved here it is you ready
[46:59] to relax in the Holy Spirit brother

[47:10] way I just said what did he say I ran it
[47:14] back and he said you're not I'm not I'm

[51:48] test testifying to us hey come up
[51:49] through the religious Mary got around
[51:51] and he was an alter boy and a Catholic
[51:52] and then he was a Baptist and then he
[51:54] was a UPC and then he was you know he
[51:56] was with PTL and then he came to the
[51:58] message and and and he said when he
[52:00] first came into Catholicism he come in
[52:03] he said he said man he said I was about
[52:05] as runchy as you could possibly get and
[52:07] he said I heard the priest up there
[52:09] talking about how that I could have all
[52:12] my sins and and and done away with in
[52:16] Christ and he said I I'd never heard
[52:17] anything like that in my life he said I
[52:19] would he said I walked up there as
[52:21] brother Ernie wood he said now let me
[52:23] make sure I got this
[52:25] straight you're telling me that if I'll
[52:28] accept Christ all my sins everything
[52:32] I've ever done is gone and the priest

[52:53] he my heart is signed with his signature
[52:56] and it's signed in blood hallelujah
[52:59] thank you Lord It's a truth that unlocks
[53:03] this great mystery of abiding in Christ
[53:06] this this mystery this truth that
[53:09] unlocks this mystery I want to say to
[53:11] you tonight
[53:12] friends that abiding in Christ is often
[53:15] simpler than we think amen and if I if
[53:19] there's one thing that I have desired to
[53:22] accomplish is to let you know the access
[53:25] that you have to to it by faith in
[53:28] Christ by faith in the word that he's
[53:29] sent in this hour that he has unfolded
[53:32] his mystery to us he had to do that it
[53:36] was it was it was the mysteries of
[53:38] Christ it was the revelation of Jesus
[53:40] Christ that was going to perfect the
[53:42] bride that was going to dress her in the
[53:44] garments of the word this is the very
[53:47] thing that the 10 virgins awoke to arise
[53:51] the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet
[53:53] him and and that of course connects
[53:55] right to because that's the message come
[53:57] out of her my people the Midnight Cry
[54:00] has come come out of the church go into
[54:03] Christ see so he's going to have to
[54:07] dress Us in the garments of his word
[54:10] you're your the garments of your
[54:12] opinions are worth almost
[54:15] nothing and we know that it's worth less
[54:17] than nothing to the age because they're
[54:19] found naked miserable poor blind and
[54:23] naked
[54:24] see but there is a Tru truth that
[54:26] unlocks this mystery of abiding in
[54:29] Christ and it's often simpler than we
[54:31] think it's it's very natural for a
[54:34] Believer H at least it has been with me
[54:37] I'm sure it is with you very natural for
[54:40] a Believer to long for that closeness
[54:42] and that richness of his presence
[54:44] friends I to me I once was young and now
[54:48] I'm old and I can tell you there's
[54:50] nothing so satisfying as living in that
[54:53] presence with Christ there's nothing so
[54:56] refeshing nothing so safe nothing so
[54:59] comforting nothing so so and
[55:02] strengthening and empowering and helping
[55:04] you Face Tomorrow When the world has to
[55:07] face it with drugs and alcohol and fast
[55:09] living and every kind of distraction and
[55:11] every kind of thing to numb their senses
[55:13] I don't have to have mine numbed my I I
[55:16] have the Holy Spirit it renews me it
[55:19] refreshes me say are you glad you got it
[55:22] I'm so glad I got it I want more of it
[55:25] and and if he gives you more more of it
[55:26] will he yes he is tonight giving you
[55:28] more of it right now and I'm going to
[55:30] want more of it tomorrow and the next
[55:32] day and the next day and I I I I
[55:36] constantly want to move into abiding in
[55:40] Christ that's the
[55:42] truth sure it is that's how we feel
[55:46] genuinely
[55:48] yes but the busyness of life life being
[55:51] what it
[55:53] is too often in our busy lives we find
[55:57] ourselves strayed from him amen
[56:02] we
[56:04] amen look at your neighbor and say
[56:07] we we are all in this
[56:10] together the business of life is a
[56:13] plague upon all of us the distractions
[56:17] of
[56:18] leoda are a plague upon all of us and
[56:22] I'm here to tell you it's filled with
[56:24] fears and anxiety and you and and I
[56:27] could start down a list and I could
[56:28] start down a list of this that you'd say
[56:30] I'm not afraid of that and I'd hit
[56:32] another I'm not afraid of that I I'd get
[56:34] to one eventually I promise you we'd get
[56:36] down the list far enough I'd hit
[56:38] something you're afraid of I'd hit
[56:40] something that might not bother me but
[56:42] bothers you and something that bothers
[56:44] might not bother you but bothers me and
[56:47] and and and and I know that that's the
[56:49] enemy doing that in fact is he he his
[56:54] whole the Satan eats sleeps drinks
[56:58] thinks constantly his every waking
[57:00] moment is how can I distract the bride
[57:04] of Christ he doesn't not worried about
[57:06] the rest of the world he already has
[57:08] them how do I distract the bride she's
[57:11] the only one who can defeat
[57:18] meall this is not abiding in him like he
[57:21] told us to do we get too busy we find
[57:24] Our Lives straight from him see that's
[57:26] not abiding in
[57:27] him now I'm not saying you and and I
[57:31] dealt with this a little bit in Parts
[57:33] one and part two because we and I don't
[57:35] want to jump ahead of myself for tonight
[57:37] but but we we know that he he died to
[57:42] save Sinners he died for the sins of the
[57:44] whole world he said come unto me all you
[57:46] that are weary and heavy laden I give
[57:47] you rest Jesus offers salvation a legit
[57:52] it's it's a nonous offer he offers a
[57:55] legitimate opportunity
[57:56] for every human to save himself from
[57:59] this destructing this world that's
[58:01] falling apart amen but but and that's
[58:04] something that they have to choose to do
[58:06] but we have taught and shown and proven
[58:09] in the Bible year after year that let me
[58:12] tell you something friends Jesus said to
[58:14] his own you have actually not chosen me
[58:17] I have chosen you and I chose you before
[58:20] the foundation of the world Hallelujah
[58:23] my job my what what is upon me I do have
[58:26] to be born again but my life's goal is
[58:29] to is to relax into the vision and begin
[58:33] cooperating in the vision that he
[58:35] already knows is a vision of me
[58:38] amen and that is the and the and so the
[58:41] only one that can abide many can come
[58:45] many are called few are chosen many of
[58:49] the world can come to Christ and and
[58:52] actually the unwise Virgin they come to
[58:55] Christ and they they encounter a
[58:57] Salvation experience now it's not a new
[58:59] birth because they have to go through
[59:01] the tribulation it's obvious that
[59:02] they're not born again because Jesus had
[59:05] promised whoever is in St John 5:24
[59:07] would not go through the tribulation and
[59:09] they would not come to the judgment and
[59:10] since the foolish virgin do both they're
[59:12] in the tribulation and they stand before
[59:14] the Judgment where he divides them as a
[59:16] Shepherd would divide sheep from goats
[59:18] they're in Matthew 25 so we know that's
[59:21] not the bride because the bride is
[59:22] Seated on the throne with him amen so
[59:25] the world has an invitation to come to
[59:28] Christ and save themselves from this
[59:29] unto generation but I'm here to tell you
[59:31] something friends you can't not choose
[59:33] the word because you're a part of the
[59:35] word and it's a part of you and God
[59:37] comes and reveals himself to you and it
[59:39] it fits it's you it's him it's the word
[59:43] no wonder we say Amen to every word no
[59:46] wonder we're the ones who can abide in
[59:50] him see the only way you can abide in
[59:53] him is you have to be in him
[59:56] and the only ones who actually get in
[59:58] him are the ones he gets into and the
[1:00:01] only ones he gets into are the redeemed
[1:00:04] of the lord they're not just Sav from
[1:00:07] destruction they are redeemed they are
[1:00:10] born again by the spirit of God Amen so
[1:00:14] the whole message of abide is just to
[1:00:16] the the predestinated elect that's right
[1:00:20] it's the only ones who are considered in
[1:00:21] Redemption amen only the predestinated
[1:00:24] are considered in Redemption right
[1:00:26] see cuz that's beyond just common
[1:00:30] salvation so it's to us as I said to you
[1:00:33] and I I so I so you know as the old term
[1:00:37] is cabbage down on that hard because I
[1:00:39] wanted you to understand I'm speaking to
[1:00:42] Born Again people and I'm saying Jesus
[1:00:45] said to you you born again people you
[1:00:48] redeemed you see Gene of my loins you
[1:00:51] need to abide in me if you don't if you
[1:00:54] let the busyness of life get you at
[1:00:56] distance from me then then then you're
[1:00:59] you're you're limiting what I can do
[1:01:01] through you you're not losing your
[1:01:04] Redemption you've been redeemed by the
[1:01:06] blood of the lamb but you need to abide
[1:01:08] in me because only by abiding in me you
[1:01:10] I am the vine you are the
[1:01:13] branches amen without me you can do
[1:01:17] nothing you who you redeemed amen you
[1:01:21] genes of God that's right you can do
[1:01:23] nothing unless you abide in the
[1:01:28] fine we know there are some who don't
[1:01:30] abide because they've never been born
[1:01:32] again we talked about that brother
[1:01:34] Bradon made that clear he said you've
[1:01:35] never come far enough that's right
[1:01:38] amen but we're talking about the the
[1:01:40] other side of that as we as we showed
[1:01:43] you on part
[1:01:45] one and so so it is to us friends we do
[1:01:49] have to take ownership of the fact and
[1:01:51] realize that sometimes the busyness of
[1:01:54] Our Lives can pull us away
[1:01:56] and and I my heart breaks with Agony to
[1:02:02] see people of my flock people who I've
[1:02:05] dedicated my life to people who I've
[1:02:08] tried to preach to and tried to live it
[1:02:10] and I see the busyness of Life carrying
[1:02:13] them away at distance are are they lost
[1:02:16] I don't believe they're lost but they're
[1:02:17] carried away and God cannot work through
[1:02:20] them like he needs to work through them
[1:02:23] and it's heartbreaking because I I see
[1:02:26] it you I mean you look look at look at
[1:02:29] how many times people allow Career
[1:02:32] School yeah money the pursuit of worldly
[1:02:37] pleasures social uh acceptance and that
[1:02:42] is prioritized even over the most
[1:02:45] fundamental thing of a Christian is
[1:02:47] being at church yeah amen am assembling
[1:02:51] yourselves at the house of God they're
[1:02:52] not here their families aren't here
[1:02:54] their children it teenagers facing an
[1:02:57] impossible situation and parents have no
[1:03:00] more care than to let the cares of the
[1:03:03] world draw them at
[1:03:05] distance amen amen as we said to you
[1:03:08] before applying the token is not a
[1:03:11] cliche applying the token is bringing
[1:03:14] your family into contact with the token
[1:03:17] that's what you do when you apply you
[1:03:19] apply something you bring it into
[1:03:21] contact a prophet the Holy Spirit was
[1:03:24] warning him when it was Kindergarten
[1:03:27] days of the 1960s the nation the world
[1:03:30] was Kindergarten compared to now and he
[1:03:33] was saying you're going to have to apply
[1:03:35] the
[1:03:36] [Music]
[1:03:37] token
[1:03:38] [Music]
[1:03:40] amen so this is this is the burden of my
[1:03:43] heart this is not a time to be at
[1:03:45] distance you Brothers and Sisters You
[1:03:48] teenagers this is not a time to be at
[1:03:50] distance the world is ending the bride
[1:03:52] is going home this is a time to be on
[1:03:55] fire this a time to be abiding in
[1:04:04] Christ it happens to us too often I
[1:04:09] appreciated brother Paul using Peter I I
[1:04:12] I actually had that in my notes for
[1:04:14] weeks because you know perhaps like
[1:04:17] Peter sometimes we we take our eyes off
[1:04:21] of him yeah we get our eyes on the on
[1:04:25] the cares of the world and that's what
[1:04:28] happened to Peter as long as he kept his
[1:04:30] eyes on Jesus those waves meant nothing
[1:04:33] amen I mean and that's what brother Paul
[1:04:36] was talking about how that you know
[1:04:38] they're they're all worried about these
[1:04:39] waves we're going to die don't you care
[1:04:41] we're about to drown and when Jesus
[1:04:44] wakes up and looks around he completely
[1:04:46] ignored their
[1:04:48] question because the the the problem was
[1:04:51] not the waves the problem was not the
[1:04:54] lifethreatening
[1:04:55] situation the problem was Their
[1:04:58] Fear how is it that you're so afraid why
[1:05:01] would they be afraid for goodness sake
[1:05:03] Jesus is in the boat the creator of the
[1:05:06] Winds and the waves the creator of the
[1:05:08] whole world you've got the word of God
[1:05:10] in your life in your heart you believe
[1:05:12] him what would you be afraid of the
[1:05:14] world and the cares of the world the
[1:05:17] problem is a lack of faith the problem
[1:05:19] is too much fear and that's a
[1:05:21] consequence of living at distance Amen
[1:05:25] on yeah instead of
[1:05:28] Abiding and it starts small and Satan
[1:05:31] takes you just a little bit away a
[1:05:33] little bit away the next thing you know
[1:05:35] you're way off away and you're
[1:05:38] sinking oh you know something friends I
[1:05:42] I I remember saying to you in part one
[1:05:44] how that that that I wanted you to
[1:05:46] understand and I and I remember saying
[1:05:49] to you you know we have these things in
[1:05:51] our lives and if we're honest we know
[1:05:53] that they're true but I wanted you to
[1:05:55] understand I said if you don't remember
[1:05:57] anything I want to put this indelibly in
[1:05:59] your heart that that this is what's so
[1:06:01] important to understand is that you're
[1:06:03] failures and we have them but that is
[1:06:06] that is not a reflection of your Worth
[1:06:08] to him it's not a reflection of your
[1:06:11] faith in the word of God you remember
[1:06:13] that well I want to say to you tonight
[1:06:15] can I Lodge this this this thought in
[1:06:18] your mind indelibly place it in your
[1:06:20] heart is that he is always inviting you
[1:06:24] back to a deeper
[1:06:27] relationship Hallelujah where you can
[1:06:29] find renewed joy and renewed strength
[1:06:33] he'll never stop drawing you into
[1:06:36] that
[1:06:40] Hallelujah that feeling you have even
[1:06:43] right
[1:06:44] now where the Lord is speaking to you
[1:06:46] that's
[1:06:48] him that's him right while I'm preaching
[1:06:51] that's him inviting you back to that
[1:06:54] refreshing time
[1:06:56] oh I love that song as as sister Brenda
[1:06:58] wrote the more that I Surrender
[1:07:00] Hallelujah the lighter my load the more
[1:07:03] that I release my cares the more he
[1:07:06] takes control amen hallelujah amen
[1:07:09] friends that's what you're feeling even
[1:07:11] right now amen I remind you that brother
[1:07:15] brandham had and I gave you this as as
[1:07:17] part of the foundation of
[1:07:20] why everything that I've been preaching
[1:07:22] on is true why is everything
[1:07:26] that I've been in this series on why is
[1:07:28] it
[1:07:30] true what's driving it why does God care
[1:07:35] that I abide amen why such a big deal
[1:07:41] that I don't live at
[1:07:43] distance because he had a three-fold
[1:07:46] plan to to express himself completely
[1:07:50] God in Christ second to have the
[1:07:53] preeminence by his by this his church
[1:07:56] which is his body the bride till he
[1:07:58] could have preeminence to express
[1:07:59] himself through them again and thirdly
[1:08:02] to restore the kingdom to its rightly
[1:08:05] position that fell by sin by the first
[1:08:08] adom here it is to where he walked in
[1:08:11] the cool of the evening with his people
[1:08:14] with them fellowshipped with them you
[1:08:17] understand I know you want to go to
[1:08:18] heaven I know you want to Fellowship God
[1:08:20] can I say to you he wanted to Fellowship
[1:08:23] you before there was startup he had the
[1:08:26] whole plan of a kingdom why won't he
[1:08:28] leave me alone because he desires to
[1:08:31] restore you back to the rightly position
[1:08:35] where he had fellowship with
[1:08:37] you and he walked with you in the cool
[1:08:40] of the day this is why he said to his
[1:08:44] family
[1:08:46] abide in
[1:08:53] me so we when we when we think of this
[1:08:57] as I jumped ahead of myself a few
[1:08:59] minutes
[1:09:00] ago this abiding is the level that God's
[1:09:05] redeemed
[1:09:06] family and only God's redeemed family
[1:09:10] can enjoy or let me say it like this
[1:09:14] this is you are the only people in the
[1:09:18] earth who are given the opportunity to
[1:09:22] choose to abide
[1:09:25] amen that being true then that makes
[1:09:29] then that gives you the ability to
[1:09:33] choose how close you will
[1:09:35] abide how much Fellowship you would like
[1:09:39] I'm here to tell you something friends
[1:09:41] my whole heart's burden that if I could
[1:09:43] p take my heart and put it into you we'd
[1:09:46] have a whole church that wants him Night
[1:09:48] and Day Day and Night every moment I
[1:09:51] want him more and more and more and more
[1:09:54] and however much room brother brandham
[1:09:56] said however much room you'll empty out
[1:09:58] and make room for him he'll fill that
[1:10:01] place I say Lord Empty Me Empty Me Oh
[1:10:05] God come in fill up all of those places
[1:10:08] in my
[1:10:09] life however much you will empty out he
[1:10:12] will fill
[1:10:15] it give me my PowerPoint
[1:10:21] Z it's about 17 minutes after I think I
[1:10:24] can get through this in about 13 minutes
[1:10:27] I'm just going to read this quote
[1:10:29] abiding in Christ
[1:10:30] and and for our subtitle of course this
[1:10:33] doesn't surprise you the continuing
[1:10:36] Journey now I I want you to pay close
[1:10:40] attention this is a lengthy quote it has
[1:10:43] a lot of frames not as many as it needs
[1:10:45] to have but I like putting the letters
[1:10:47] big so everybody in the back can read
[1:10:48] them it it hurts my feelings when I'm
[1:10:51] sitting at the back and the rewards are
[1:10:52] too small in I camera like what is it
[1:10:53] saying and so I I because of that I get
[1:10:56] a lot of extra frames so don't don't
[1:10:58] don't don't panic I'm fixing the
[1:11:01] clothes don't get nervous that's what it
[1:11:03] is don't get nervous I'm fixing the
[1:11:05] clothes with brother digs that means
[1:11:07] nothing but with me I really
[1:11:14] am this this
[1:11:17] quote I I can't improve on
[1:11:19] it when you see this tonight it's from
[1:11:23] 1955 Fellowship by
[1:11:26] Redemption you're going to understand
[1:11:29] from a prophet's
[1:11:31] language everything that I'm trying to
[1:11:33] get across to you all right this is this
[1:11:39] represents the
[1:11:41] process of coming from sin to Christ the
[1:11:46] door Christ is the door to coming
[1:11:49] through the blood coming into Christ
[1:11:52] being born again and abiding in the
[1:11:56] whole process amen all right now Feast
[1:12:00] your eyes this is
[1:12:02] beautiful brother brandham
[1:12:04] says now the next thing he's speaking
[1:12:07] about the Tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:12:10] that Moses built all right the next
[1:12:12] thing the
[1:12:14] blood off of this innocent
[1:12:17] substitute was struck seven times like
[1:12:21] that as a public testimony that that
[1:12:23] screen went out if somebody can get that
[1:12:25] for me so I can look that
[1:12:27] way excuse me like that as a public
[1:12:31] testimony seven is God's complete
[1:12:34] number seven Church ages the seven last
[1:12:37] Church ages Church of Philadelphia the
[1:12:40] Church of Lea the church every Church
[1:12:41] age must come through that same
[1:12:45] blood now the man's come he sets in the
[1:12:49] congregation he's heard the word now
[1:12:51] watch he wants Fellowship that building
[1:12:55] is the only place of Fellowship the only
[1:12:58] place they could come was in this
[1:13:01] building to have fellowship with God
[1:13:04] cause God only met them in there now
[1:13:07] watch close now what a type of
[1:13:11] Christ today God hasn't promised to
[1:13:15] Fellowship through the Methodist Baptist
[1:13:18] or Pentecostal he has promised to
[1:13:22] Fellowship he has promised to Fellowship
[1:13:24] amen but not in a Creed or denomination
[1:13:27] but he has promised to Fellowship in
[1:13:31] Christ Jesus here he is see you see why
[1:13:37] we had to have a message that restored
[1:13:39] this because he wanted Fellowship I
[1:13:42] wanted Fellowship see that's where your
[1:13:46] fellowship is it's amazing how many
[1:13:51] people who actually believe what God has
[1:13:54] done in the this
[1:13:56] day and absolutely have had an
[1:14:00] experience of the Holy Ghost but who
[1:14:03] have very limited to almost no
[1:14:07] fellowship with
[1:14:11] this because we live at
[1:14:13] distance and the devil has pulled us
[1:14:15] aside and distracted us so bad come on
[1:14:18] come on
[1:14:21] people you can have fellowship with your
[1:14:24] men of mankind to join the Moose the elk
[1:14:27] the odd fellas I don't know what that is
[1:14:29] those
[1:14:32] lodges that's right they're fine that's
[1:14:35] not what I'm talking about this morning
[1:14:37] I'm talking about the fellowship with
[1:14:40] Christ the Eternal one
[1:14:44] amen now then when the blood has been
[1:14:47] sprinkled the waters the washing of the
[1:14:49] Water by the word the word went forth
[1:14:52] you say well look I've joined Church
[1:14:55] I've done this but really I haven't had
[1:14:57] that experience what is it it's the
[1:15:00] Waters of
[1:15:02] Separation well I thought I was all
[1:15:04] right if I joined mother's church that
[1:15:07] isn't it brother no sir someone died for
[1:15:10] you that was Christ Jesus you must
[1:15:14] accept him then you receive
[1:15:17] that then the next thing you start
[1:15:19] toward the fellowship here you go well

[1:15:41] word I believe it remember friends that
[1:15:44] you we've got to get
[1:15:46] past this anomaly at the end time it's
[1:15:50] been in every age but it's pronounced
[1:15:52] particularly pronounced at the end time
[1:15:55] where people because they uh they admire
[1:15:59] the fine qualities of Jesus they emulate
[1:16:04] certain parts of the gospel and they
[1:16:06] talk about that day on Calvary and they
[1:16:09] talk about the love of God nothing
[1:16:11] really changes in their lives amen but
[1:16:15] they brother BR said but they are a
[1:16:17] Christian because they espouse the
[1:16:19] Christian teaching but he says that's a
[1:16:22] mental conception that's not a real
[1:16:25] Spirit born Christian this is this is
[1:16:28] where they stop at right here see he
[1:16:30] said you've heard the word then you walk
[1:16:32] to the door you've got a mental Faith

[1:19:41] come down to the fellowship yet with him
[1:19:45] coming and only way you'll do it is
[1:19:48] through the blood of his suffering then
[1:19:51] you come to the place and hear the word
[1:19:54] and say yes Jesus died in my stead it's
[1:19:59] not just Jesus died for me it's Jesus

[1:20:44] tomorrow and the next day at work in
[1:20:46] your home you you can't the only way to

[1:40:51] now amen praise the Lord anybody got a

[1:40:55] opportunity cut us on here brother Brad
[1:40:58] and brother Caleb is going to start us
[1:41:00] off
[1:41:01] [Music]
[1:41:11] amen for the last few weeks I've been in
[1:41:15] a certain kind of mood where I feel like
[1:41:17] I'm not living up to the way the Lord
[1:41:20] wants me to as I'm sure everyone does
[1:41:24] and got that right and the sermon
[1:41:27] today before brother Jason spoke on his
[1:41:31] um
[1:41:32] verse I opened up directly into it same
[1:41:36] as him and I was just like okay that's
[1:41:39] pretty cool and then brother Jason had
[1:41:42] the same thing happen I was like that's
[1:41:44] double cool so I know the Lord's going
[1:41:47] to speak through me or speak to me
[1:41:50] through this sermon and if it was for
[1:41:53] anybody else it was for me I definitely
[1:41:57] needed that exact verse I have a strong
[1:41:59] tower to go to and the Satan I will not
[1:42:03] admit that he has victory in any part of
[1:42:06] my life and he's been trying to give me
[1:42:09] the spirit of depression and I'm not
[1:42:11] accepting that Amen brother I'm just
[1:42:13] claiming Victory that's right that's
[1:42:16] [Applause]
[1:42:19] right the reason the reason that brother
[1:42:22] Caleb
[1:42:24] is claiming that kind of Victory is
[1:42:28] because he
[1:42:30] can you have the right to be free that's
[1:42:34] what that day on Calvary means to the
[1:42:38] believer I have a right to be free I
[1:42:41] have a right to any Redemptive blessing
[1:42:44] that that day on Calvary purchased I
[1:42:47] have a right to it and the devil listen
[1:42:49] friends it becomes an inalienable right
[1:42:52] when you're born again of the spirit God
[1:42:54] an inalienable right means that you
[1:42:55] don't need anyone's permission to have
[1:42:57] it it's yours it can't even no one needs
[1:42:59] to tell you it's yours it's yours inalia
[1:43:02] it's in it's intrinsic to you it comes
[1:43:05] with the new birth whatever Christ
[1:43:07] purchased he now lives inside you
[1:43:10] Hallelujah you've got the purchase price
[1:43:12] and the purchaser living inside you amen
[1:43:15] anybody else got a testimony tonight
[1:43:17] before we go praise the Lord all right
[1:43:20] who is it I see a hand
[1:43:23] [Music]
[1:43:25] well every time I give a testimony it's
[1:43:27] usually about a
[1:43:28] vehicle so I got another one okay um a
[1:43:33] couple months ago I gave a testimony
[1:43:35] about the Lord giving me a truck it was
[1:43:38] that white you know the first Ford I
[1:43:42] bought um well I drove it for a day
[1:43:46] after I fixed it and the motor blew up
[1:43:48] so I won't buy another Ford but it was
[1:43:52] just kind of a
[1:43:54] really really hard time to kind of go
[1:43:57] through Vehicles would get fixed go down
[1:44:00] get fixed go down and I was just kind of
[1:44:03] felt like I was beating my head against
[1:44:04] the
[1:44:05] wall
[1:44:07] but the last couple weeks couple month
[1:44:10] or to a month it was just like okay Lord
[1:44:12] I will do I'll keep fixing it I I'll
[1:44:16] keep doing whatever you want me to do
[1:44:18] but I have to have a vehicle I have to
[1:44:20] have a truck to work to pull my trailers
[1:44:23] to do everything that I'm doing that he
[1:44:28] gives me the work to do you know so I
[1:44:31] was just praying hard for not
[1:44:35] just a specific truck or anything like
[1:44:38] that just a
[1:44:40] truck and I kind of knew what I liked
[1:44:43] but he gave me another
[1:44:45] truck kind of just beyond what I could
[1:44:49] ever have asked for I mean I wasn't
[1:44:51] looking for the nice and shiny thing but
[1:44:55] he gave it to me and I'm really really
[1:44:57] really happy about it soise the
[1:44:59] [Applause]
