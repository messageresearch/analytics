your hands use each one of us as you see fit For Your Glory we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you all good to be here with you and uh so thankful for the wonderful meetings we had this last weekend thankful for the work of the Holy Spirit and our hearts to do such wonderful things for us it would be uh be impossible even in one service to speak about what the Lord did just for one person but you know for for all of us the Lord is doing a thousand things and even a thousand things that we don't even know about through what was preached this weekend and and the worship and man it was marvelous wasn't it amen so I want to speak on the subject the fullness of him that feels all in all and I was just praying and studying this afternoon waiting on the Lord for Clarity on what subject to speak on I think sometimes I come into it and I know you know this is exactly what the Lord wants me to speak on other times you come and you just sit and you you wait and you wait and you wait and you wonder my goodness it's uh three hours before service Lord what am I going to do and then something uh just came to me it was it like uh what are you thankful for in this day and age amen what makes what makes you excited what grounds you okay I'll talk about that so you know you think about the different situations that you know you have in Ministry Brother Brad knows this the different ones that minister is you're putting your trust in the Lord you don't know what's going on in people's lives and I you know you're always praying that the Lord would give you insight and help you to know and sometimes you come to this pulpit and you have notes that you've had for a long time and you've preached overseas in this country in this country and you say well Lord take it and use it and you think I got nothing and I feel nothing about this I'm just going forward and all of a sudden the text messages come in you the Lord did this the Lord did this this opened up for me this was revealed to me well it shows it's not the person doing the work it's it's the Lord Jesus Christ working for his his church and for his people and if you come with expectations yeah you get what you expect amen so let's look at the scripture Revelation chapter 3 and verse 19 through 21 as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and we'll sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne amen may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word he can be seated just want to say to everyone thank you so much for your prayers and for standing with us during the difficult time that we've had as a family of losing my mother and I always say that losing my mother and then I catch myself I didn't lose her I know exactly where she's at know just where she's at and I know what just what she's experiencing and feeling only it's a lot better than what I'm even imagining so um so thankful for for standing with us through that through that time appreciate each one of you praying for us and continue to pray for my dad by God's grace he's doing well and the Lord is with him so just remember him uh in your prayers so the fullness of him that fills all in all amen that is from Ephesians we're going to read that later that's where I drew my title from um but we started with revelation 3. and and what brings that on my heart is we have we have a present Christ a present tense Christ in Revelation 3 20. he says I stand at the door and not he's there in the midst of the candlesticks right he's always there through all seven ages but in the seventh age he comes personally in spirit form to his church to the bride he's calling a bride this is part of him calling a bride he's standing at the door and knocking so what does that show us it shows us he's outside of this church and it's it's even worse than that is they've kicked him on the outside they believe they're right they believe that they're the church they're rich and increased in goods and they don't know their naked miserable wretched you know that's the condition of the church in our day laodicea people's rights I mean my land's sakes is it people's rights in today's day and age they make they make up so many rights you don't even can't even keep track of it and they're new and there ain't rights in the first place and my goodness it's it's uh you almost can't even speak about what's happening in our age it's so filthy it's so disgusting and so perverted it's in our hopeless we didn't just get kicked off YouTube but oh well this transgender nonsense it's complete garbage there's no such a thing as transgender and they're pushing this in the schools and they're grooming and they're doing stripteases of men dressed up as women in front of little uh little children and they're grooming them for homosexuality and pedophilia and perversion and these are their rights to do that it's not not a right forgiven by God might be given by our government but that shows our governments of the devil and you know that's the filth of the whole thing that's not even the church though you see even a movement inside the charismatic church is starting to try to say well we accept everyone we're open to everyone homosexuality is okay and we can't you know we can't best base our faith on the Bible the Bible's unreliable you know that's the Andy Stanley over mega church in in Atlanta saying we don't base our faith on the Bible we base it on the resurrection well Brother Andy where do we get in a reliable account of the Resurrection in the Bible that's where we get that's where we get it so you have without the Bible you have no Resurrection you have no God you have you have no you have nothing you know and then then you have Pentecostals and charismatics and you know many many people with good hearts and good people yeah lovely people but they're caught up in prosperity and you see in the very best of them are the likes of Joel Osteen who doesn't really even preach the gospel doesn't preach repentance the the Jesus that the the modern church is preaching us some are preaching this but as many of them are not preaching the one that says as many as I love I rebuke and chasten you know you see people saying well I'm welcoming and loving everyone certainly but what is love what is love Jesus says I love you so I'm going to rebuke you and chasten you if you're wrong you're going to get a rebuke if he loves you and you're wrong you're going to get a rebuke and you're going to say Thank You Lord is that why we come to church judgment starts at the house of God we want to be encouraged but if that's all that's happening is encourage encourage and there's no conviction the word isn't being preached there's not a balance there has to be convicting things spoken over the pulpit otherwise we are an audit balance people what's the Zeal of the age to say I'm right and I accept everybody I give in to people's all people's rights it's repentance there's an absolute that absolute is being delivered to us we hear it and we say oh I've been waiting for this thank you Lord Jesus this is what I this is my this is this hurts but this is the desire of my heart because I want to be right with your word amen and so you know you again in the Pentecostals charismatics they get they have that or they have the word faith people with Kenneth Copeland who's so focused on money and prosperity they've almost corrupted everything they stand for and it's it's almost disgusting to see the version of you know the power of God that they believe in it's very strange and no doubt miracles happen and and there is good things that are done there but at the same time it's a great falling away from the word then you see people who are even they're preaching many truths of the gospel and they're preaching about predestination and the authority of the word of God and you listen to him on the radio and you say my or you see the memes or the different things that they say it there's really good things from Paul Washer John McArthur R.C Sproul but dig down each one of them denies that the gifts of the Spirit are in operation and the Supernatural is in effect in the church in every age each one of them and so where can you go to find a balanced message what denomination what group you can't it's all walked away from the word good people nice people but we're not following nice people we're not trying to be just nice people we're trying to be word people we're trying to be transformed by the renewing of our mind it's what the word preaches that we seek to conform ourselves to not the world we don't come to church to try to preach a message that really you know the unbelievers could Pat us on the back for that's many churches that's what they're they're catering the message to unbelievers and the churches are emptying out because they want to find the word somewhere but they can't and where is that desire for the truth where is that passion for being right with God they want God to be right with them he stands at the door and knocks you hear my voice I'm calling that's not you that's not God surely God would agree with my theology surely God would agree with my Doctrine he's still he's calling hello will anyone hear my voice individuals hear his voice to him that I overcomes there's a reward he that has it here let him hear what the spirit saith to the church is what is overcoming power he that has it here let him hear what the spirit is saying to the church is if you truly hear by spiritual Revelation it will produce an overcoming life that overcoming is a a heart of repentance and getting right with God that Spirit of this age is crept into this message and we want to make it just let's smooth some of these things out a little bit well you know a little bit of this is okay A little bit of that no we're trying to we're trying to compromise to make our Spirits feel better in the age that we live in let's be careful that could that hello that hits home right here it's not about smoothing the message over it's not smoothing things over for ourselves so that we can feel better about where we stand in the message it's standing with the message standing with the truth we have such a feminist perverted Spirit going forth in this age and it wants to get on the message wants to get around the message and that will rise up that will rise up and it brings a perversion I mean if I started listing off the things that brother Brandon said right now I I don't need to beside the point you know what I'm saying if I started lifting it off man I mean it's like hey these guys are insane totally insane no we're perfectly sane these are the right things these are the right and true things that the prophet brought to us it sounds crazy to a perverted age but to the bride of Christ it's it's the truth that we rejoice in shave back what the devil has tried to push over on you push him back in the very practical things in your life the very basic things ABCs of the message the devil is attacking that don't kid yourself he's attacking modesties attacking not wearing makeup he's attacking not cutting the hair he's attacking the basic things of modesty for men and women he's doing it and we're letting him not all of us but in some ways all of us and we've got to push back we want to put the devil under our foot well that those are the things that you're going to put the devil under your foot on right it's not just talking about it it's doing it by putting the word into practice in your life not just saying I believe the message devil believes it too yeah it's lit it's bringing the message and saying Lord I know I'm not right correct me convict me and give me strength to come and Conformity to this message Hebrews 1 1 if you want to control the PowerPoint for me I'm just going to read and you you follow along God who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he is appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high and then the next verse is Hebrews 2. verses three and four how shall we escape if we need so great Ovation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his will amen so let's look at the pattern that comes Through the Ages God speaks to the fathers to to the Jewish ancestors in the prophets you know it says says by the prophets it literally means in the prophets God veiled himself in those prophets you want to go back brother Caleb to to a couple screens to verse 1 1. so God veiled himself in the prophets and spoke through those prophets to the Jewish ancestors all right then he says hath in these last days spoken to us same thing in his son so God veiled himself through the prophets they were a part of the word then he avails himself through his son he's the fullness of the word and the Sun is more than a prophet because he appointed this son heir of all things and through him or in the sun he also made the worlds the word worlds there is the Aeons it could it could be speaking of he is appointed or designed the ages in the Sun or through the Sun and he goes even further he's even more than that he is the brightness of God's glory in other words easy if you have the son and then you have the Rays shining out from the Sun so this that English is a horrible language to tell this in if I wish I knew Spanish I could tell it to you and but sun and Sun you know right what I'm saying the Sun it works better in other languages but not for translators I'll tell you that much they're looking at me like so the son of God is the brightness he's the outring he's the he is the sunlight shining forth from the source which is the Father the great eternal and he is the express image of his person it literally means he's the exact imprint of God's nature and even further he's so much higher than the than the prophets he upholds all things by the word of his power and we had by himself purged our sins even more than the prophets he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high all right so we see there God spoke to the fathers and the prophets he spoke to us in the son the son is so far beyond the prophet sees the he's the outring of God's glory the exact imprint of a substance he's the heir of everything and next we see in the next uh yeah you got it up perfect salvation is purchased by the Sun and then it's proclaimed by Witnesses but not just proclaimed it shows us that God Bears witness with it with signs and wonders the supernatural oh always follows the word when the word is proclaimed the power of God comes forth and testifies to the fact this is God moving through this word now many take these verses uh it's astounding they take these verses in Hebrews especially chapter one and they say now we don't have any Prophets no such thing as prophets under the New Testament we have the Holy Ghost we don't need men of God to speak to us because the holy ghost is now our teacher well the book of Acts book of Ephesians Romans First Corinthians speak differently than that yeah it speaks of the gift of Prophecy it also speaks of prophets speaks of Apostles and even people say well Apostles is limited to Paul and the the the the eleven no the many other people Paul himself calls apostles and so we we see this clearly he speaks through they say well that that's where they go is in in Hebrews one he spoke in Us in his last days in his son so he's speaking to us through Jesus Christ so we don't need prophets we don't need Apostles what in the world kind of crazy thought thought is that the very time that this person is writing it he spoke to us in the last days in the sun is Apostles are proclaiming the message and the this this writer is saying God's doing Miracles now he's doing Supernatural things now to Bear witness of this message that he's re he's not dead he's resurrected he's alive all right next next screen it wasn't so from the beginning brother Branham says this now we take our Lord when he was here he did not claim to do Miracles he said it was the father God that dwelt in him and he was he expressed God through himself God and otherwise built himself a body that he lived in himself God came down was manifest In the Flesh in Christ and it was not Jesus the body the Son of God it was the god of Glory in the Son of God showing the glory of God you see through himself the god of Glory manifesting the glory of God Amen and in him God dwelt in him and he reflected God now that's the way each of we ministers do we reflect God as God is in us and then that's the only way that God can move is and people can see God is through we his servants that's how people won't read a Bible but they'll read you see and so you reflect Christ your walks your talks your actions all reflect Christ that's the perfectly expressing Hebrews one and two God revealed in the form of this Prophets The Holy Ghost speaks through the prophets right I mean that that's what uh second Peter tells us God revealed perfectly and completely and fully in his son to accomplish Redemption what is it the holy ghost manifested in the fullness in the Sun then it's Christ proclaimed through his witness what Christ in you the hope of glory the Holy Ghost through the fivefold ministry and the body of believers that's God's purpose that's what God's doing and it always consists of Supernatural any time the word is preached anywhere anyplace God will follow with signs to Bear record of that that's through all ages all seven Church ages it's never different there's no such thing as ceasing of the gifts or cessation of the gifts that's a false Doctrine invented by dispensationalists because they they couldn't produce the supernatural in their Ministry amen sure they had some good things to say and brother Branham even Bears witness of some of the things that dispensationalists teach about but that was one of the worst scourges they brought on the 20th and 21st century Ephesians chapter one verse 22 and 23. this is God's purpose this is during the first church age Paul writing it's not just the last Church age it's the first church age and it's put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church verse 23 which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all who is the fullness of him that fills all in all the bride the bride is to be the fullness manifested Paul delivered his message they had the full word but the church fell away from that now the church through the church ages they had it in part but in Malachi 4 were promised and we've received that promise to be restored back to the fullness of the word now this this scripture that's written in Ephesians 1 23 and was fulfilled in the first church age were restored back to that we are to be the fullness of him that filleth all in all now God is a spirit right God is invisible he can't be seen with the naked eye he hasn't been seen he never will be seen he covers all space and time so we're not we're not filled with his whole Spirit right he he exists apart from and separate from us but that's not what fullness is really speaking about that's speaking of the manifestation of his attributes the fullness of the godhead bodily was Jesus yet Jesus himself when he's praying he lifts his eyes up to Heaven's father The Hours come well couldn't he just looked in a mirror well I suppose he could have but he did look up and so God covers all space and time but the fullness of the attributes were manifested in Christ the fullness of the attributes what Christ purchased for us is so that the fullness of those attributes could be manifested in a body of Believers not you as an individual but the whole body yeah it's that fullness is to be manifested and that was lost that was lost to the ages as the church fellow if you fall away from the word what are you doing you're falling away from the fullness and so that's why there had to be a restoration in the seventh Church age it's not a restoration of mere Doctrine it's a restoration of the Life of Christ in a body of Believers amen next screen and sirs we would see Jesus says God knowing the end from the beginning therefore he had lauded to his world a certain part of the word for each generation as they come along he sent prophets in the Old Testament we are taught in Hebrews one God in Sundry times and diverse manners speak to the fathers to the prophets in this last day through his son Christ Jesus now if we'll examine that scripture real well when Jesus was on Earth and he said he was the son of God they condemned him he said why would you condemn me when I say I'm the Son of God when you call those who the word came to gods Abraham was considered a god Elijah was considered a god Isaiah was a God because the word of God came to them and they were in portion Gods Jesus said they were he said you call them Gods now you see when the man was anointed like Joseph he portrayed Christ when Moses was anointed he portrayed Christ when David was anointed he portrayed Christ all leading up to Christ and he was the fullness of the word the word was made manifest in him he was the complete anointed one they had it by portions we as individuals I'm adding that part as individuals we have it by portions he was the anointed one the entire plan of God laid in him amen God's plan before the foundation of the world to redeem a lost world was in him he was the word and he still he is still the word the same yesterday today and forever remember he came to the fathers through the prophets made himself known through the prophets and then in this this last day through his son Christ Jesus he was God made manifest notice the word always comes to the prophet God never did work through a group of people it's an individual he works through he worked in the days of Noah through Noah he worked in the days of Moses through Moses worked in the Days of Elijah through Elijah through Elijah and Elijah through Isaiah and those prophets as they come down through the age now I'm going to pause there for a minute people will take that and they'll study out the Old Testament and say there was two prophets at one time so brother Branham is a liar what are you talking about you're missing the important entirely you never listen to what he said what is he saying God works through one prophet he didn't say he couldn't work through two prophets at the same time I mean what do you think is going on what do you think has gone on Through the Ages no that's not saying there has to be only one man you can go through the scriptures God's program he works through one individual to reveal his word now you come to the church ages yes it's one individual that the word of the Lord comes to there's many men anointed to preach that same word just like there is in this age but there's one man who receives a specific message to bring to specific people but secondarily people that say well brother Brandon made a mistake do you not know that there's two Nations that God was dealing with there was Judah and there was Israel so some of those prophets were sent to Judah at the very same time another Prophet was sent to Israel so yes there's two prophets at the same time but God didn't work through them as a committee he didn't call him together and say hey let's agree on it what's the point of what brother Brandon's saying is he's trying to show you God does not work through the Nicene Council God doesn't work through the Assemblies of God Elders at their headquarters or the UPC elders and president at their headquarters that's not how God works he anoints a man he sends them he preaches the message and he goes off the scene and it's up to the people whether they receive it or not and God will judge the people by that word that's delivered continue and then when he was here he was manifested fully not in Pharisees Sadducees but in Jesus Christ he was the word that's why he could say what he said that's the statements that he could make now these Greeks knew of this sea through each age God has allotted so much word and the churches get it all confused up then he sends a prophet among them and vindicates that word it's just like any other time we speak today and say the Methodist Lutheran said well when you believe that's all you have to do you're justified by faith believe many said they believed and didn't have it we know that long come Wesley with what with what called second work of Grace sanctification all that shouts and are Sanctified has got it many shouted didn't have it long came the Pentecost said all that speaks with tongues has got it many spoke with tongues and didn't have it so again we we have God allotting his word to each age to each time period to each people you know the word that God is go is revealed to us is not the same word that was revealed through Luther it's a building thing the word that was revealed to Moses is not the same word that was revealed to Noah God that's what he's saying there's a allotted word for each day now you go through the prophets all the prophets the purpose of their Ministry was to prop foretell the coming of Christ also was to call the call them all the repentance and say return back to what Moses taught walk in obedience to the law right that's that's the Old Testament prophets now you're gonna you get John the Baptist comes and says Christ is coming then you get the apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers and they're pointing back and saying Christ came right then the church starts falling away so what do you think message God is going to send to us return back to the word he sends a man in the spirit and power of Elijah what did Elijah do he says repent and return back to Jehovah God you turned away from him you're not walking with him you're not worshiping him right you're not obeying him what do you think the spirit of Elijah is going to do again in this hour same thing you say brother Brandon made mistakes have you read the Bible which prophet didn't make a mistake Jesus Christ that's why he's the Savior and the Redeemer he's perfect he never sinned he's the heir of all things he's sitting at the right hand of the Majesty on high none of the other prophets are doing that not brother Branham nobody why because they're Sinners saved by God's grace they make mistakes you say brother Anna made mistakes you are correct you you understand now but but this was a Vindicated prophet just as Isaiah who made mistakes Elijah who made mistakes Elisha who made mistakes all of these men that's the story of the Bible God working through Earthen vessels we have this treasure in Earthen vessels he didn't say perfect vessels he didn't say golden vessels some of you might be you think your spouse is a golden vessel but they're Earth and vessels or you might think you're a golden vessel but you're not you're an earth and vessel just like all the rest of the prophets the Apostle Paul was not perfect he made mistakes but the word of the Lord came to the Apostle Paul and God used him as a pat used him as a pattern imperfect people pointing us to a perfect word I just wonder what people think was happening in brother branham's life when they say he made mistakes what was all that what was all that Supernatural that was taking place oh no Supernatural is taking place you are a lunatic if you think that no Supernatural is taking place in the life of William Branham you are certifiable you need to be checked into somewhere sure amen what was happening you answer that brother Branham said that in his meetings it will depend on what you what source you think this is coming from some people think it's from the Devil some people think that's God everybody in that meeting knew something was happening none of them said it didn't happen they said something happened well it depends on who you think the source is then that'll be where your reward is from isn't that what brother Branham said it'll your reward will be from hell or it'll be from heaven receive a prophet in the name of the Prophet you'll receive a prophet's reward we're not following cunningly devised fables not something done in a corner we're not saying hey let's go out to the desert somewhere into some secret place and find it this was done around the world it was Vindicated proven time and time and time again and we're not a cult we're not interested in following a man we're simply saying God did something incredible here he used a man from Kentucky named William Branham we submit to what God has sent you know it you could you could be proud of yourself and say hey I I have a higher degree than brother Branham I do and I had to say lay that aside God is moving God is doing something here that I can't explain with human reasoning it has to be but it has to be a revelation to you personally is God leading your life that's why I've said to people time and time again when they say there's mistakes and brother Branham did this and over here he did this I just say wait a minute okay you're going we're not to lean to our own understanding as Christians I don't care what you believe but you know as a Christian if you believe the Bible you know you're not supposed to lean towards reason so are you praying did you pray about this line of reasoning this line of thought did you seek the Lord is the Lord guiding you in this that's the question to ask yourself if you're having a if you're having doubts or struggles with the message is the holy spirit leading you in this struggle and doubt ask yourself that question I think that's important that's good I think that's biblical Christian advice we go we use come brother bear says come with a sameness I'm not asking you to follow Omens signs in the skies we come with the scripture I mean I don't know about you but when I heard about the message I I went after my Bible like crazy what's this now I mean I was asking my now father-in-law so many questions that drove him crazy and asking my friend the same and and we're searching things out and going by scripture and but then a long God came because I was praying Lord what is this I don't want to follow a cult I don't want to follow some nonsense I only I want to follow your word this is what I want to live by that's my desire not some cult not some Fanatics I want to follow your word and as I was praying a mighty rushing wind came in my room I was laying there and my my door was almost shut and I was praying Lord reveal yourself to me make this clear help me to understand as I was on my knees I could I I heard a H come into my bedroom 21 years old look over at my window think what is that my left muscle left my window open no it was completely still the curtains and everything and then I felt something come across my back and it was the most reverent feeling I've ever had to this day in my life I just put my head down straight down into my bed and said Thank You Lord and the Lord wrote his word on my heart this was his holy spirit leading me supernaturally we each need that we need to be led supernaturally by the Holy Spirit that's what scripture said as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God and we know the spirit of God will never lead us separate from this word and now I have no idea where I'm at in my notes yeah things that are to be I love this quote and I do not think that heaven I had to just read this to because I just enjoy it so much some of it doesn't have to do with this only a small portion but I do not think that heaven is a place that my mother used to tell me about I believe that the church has growed from that to think it used to be a hundred years ago or two I think the old-timers used to think that everyone that died went up to heaven and had a harp and sit there on the clouds and played a harp now they know there was a place called heaven but they if that be so all the musicians would have it on us you see but it isn't that kind of a place it isn't playing Harps at all I believe don't believe the Bible teaches that but that was a conception that they had before the fullness that's the portion that I wanted to get to before the fullness of the word come into existence or the opening of The Seven Seals that's promised to us in this age that we then understand I believe that heaven is a real place someday I want to preach on heaven just the same as this is a real place see for God started us in our spiritual growth in this place and I believe that heaven is a place just as real as this where we don't set up there for eternity and just sit there on a cloud we don't just strum our harp for all from here ever but we're going to a real place where we're going to do things where we're going to live we're going to work we're going to enjoy we're going to live we're going to life to a real eternal life we're going to heaven a paradise just like Adam and Eve worked and lived and eat and enjoyed in the Garden of Eden before sin came in we're on our road right back there again just right back the first Adam through sin taking us out the second Adam through righteousness bring us back in again justifies us and brings us back in I thought that was astounding that even brother banham said the true Revelation and understanding of what heaven is like came into existence through the opening of The Seven Seals certainly they had it before but it was lost to the ages and spiritualized I mean sometimes you picture heaven or you see people put it forward in their their shows and it's like the sterile place with a white background and there's Misty clouds and my goodness what nonsense if you can picture what heaven is picture this Earth with no sin no sickness no sorrow no pain and no death but the fullness of the word that's the portion I wanted to draw from this the fullness of the word has come into existence through the opening of The Seven Seals amen see how important the opening of the seventh seals are yeah we don't want to we don't want to minimize that what a thing you see brother Branham speaking over and over and over again almost every sermon he preached after the seals were open he mentioned the seals in one way or another what a Monumental thing that was that fullness of the word coming back to us you know they probed at it through Seven Ages but now it's been manifested in the seventh we are restored back to the fullness of the word that was delivered through the apostles and the power of the Holy Ghost in the my PowerPoint left Ethan in the Feast of the trumpets says now the hidden mysteries of Christ was fully revealed in the Seven Seals also in the Feast of the trumpets he says the first chapter of the Bible in the beginning Genesis one woman didn't miss believe it but she just misinterpreted let Satan misinterpret to her one word surely and then from that caused all this trouble and that was God speaking God's word and in the last chapter of Revelation Jesus himself the same God said whosoever shall take one word out or add one word to it this he's speaking of the Bible this is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ and the Seven Seals had the Mysteries hid of what it all was and is supposed to open it in the last days at the laodicean age at the end of time thanks be to God that finishes the message to the church that finishes it when they look back and see what has been and see where it's all brought up to that finishes it the A's age of the church amen now in in seed is not here with the shuck now notice but at the opening of The Seven Seals Revelation 10 the full word is to be born into manifestation again and Vindicated by the spirit of God Amen and it has been this is history this is history is in the full strength as it was when he was here on Earth manifested in the same way doing the same things that it did when it was here on Earth amen Hebrews 13 8 said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever in Saint Luke 17 30 Jesus said in the last days as it was in the days of Sodom when the son of man will be revealing himself again it'll be the same thing amen amen amen you know I I seen somebody say the other day a prominent Christian person said God never gives a word to one person to give it to somebody else can you can you imagine can you imagine that thought he never gives a word through someone he'll only give it to you directly have you ever read the scripture where it says you're Simon the son of Jonas well that was a word have you ever read the scripture where it says before Philip called you when you were under the tree I saw you I mean isn't the whole Bible a word from one person given to us the modern religious world is blind they have gone to such extremes to try to prove their false Doctrine they can't see reality and and the sad part is message Believers will read these things and be oh gee I'm hot under the collar I just don't know how to answer that read your Bible grow up let's grow up we're called to mature manhood you know I'm not trying to down uh to speak down and I'm sorry if I said that with the wrong attitude but we do need to grow up we need to grow into the scripture says that we will in this age grow into a mature manhood we need to have spiritual discernment each one of us should have discernment to be in a situation and we see someone says oh there's a revival going on over there okay is there it don't take a long debate to know the quest answer the question don't take many minutes searching the table app to find an answer to the question and this one's saying this and where is the spiritual gumption to have discernment to look at a situation and go go to the scriptures and go to prayer and go forward with the Lord we need to come up higher we need to grow into this place where we can look at a situation with Grace with love but be able to see through we don't swallow down every the wind of doctrine that comes by our way that's part of growing into the fullness I mean look at that quote if the full word is to be born into manifestation again and it's this is not talking merely about something it's it was it started out as outside of us right started out outside of us through the prophet God Vindicated his ministry you're not Vindicated you're not bringing Malachi 4 God selected a man to do that through he proved that through he did Miracles through him none of us will ever be on that level okay but it wasn't supposed to just stay in that man and for us oh look at that man otherwise God would have kept him here and until the rapture no we're not supposed to just do that we're supposed to actually take what kind of Fellowship that that man had okay again not this on the same level not talking to the angel of the Lord but the same relationship with Christ that we are to have the full word is to be manifested then through us and so in the if it's going to be in full strength then it needs to be in full maturity as well which scripture clearly Bears record of that we're gonna I'm gonna pull up something just to remind you Ephesians 4. in verse we'll just start at verse 11 and he gave some Apostles and some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting or the equipping of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so there's that's where maturity comes in for what purpose that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of man and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplyeth according to the effectual working and the measure of every part makes increase of the body under the edifying of itself in love there's a body Ministry every part of the body is working to build up other parts you're you're here not to just sit here and say Amen you're here to build up one another help one another grow in Christ and the purpose is is this body grows into maturity we call it Perfection that's the word that you hear often but that simply speaks of maturity we're growing to maturity when we grow to that full maturity what happens we're gone the bride is gone and so Revelation 10 the mighty Angel comes down with an open book the seven the seven Thunders under their voices the seventh angel reveals what the seven Thunder spoke to us that finishes the mystery of God then we take then that deliver that book is delivered to John who represents the bride and that bride takes the book and she eats the book and prophesies again so she takes the book and what is it it's the full word and that full word that she digests is then prophesied forth is manifested forth both in her words what she speaks and the life that she lives Matthew 24 37 back to the PowerPoint but it has the days of Noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be it speaks of the presence of the son of man he's come down in spirit form to reveal himself through the opening of the word to restore the bride back to that fullness so that what the son of man is manifested what in Bride form what is the son of man it's the prophetic it's the fullness of the word that's what that's who Christ was it's the fullness of the word back in a people on the Earth from it is the rising of the sun he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was opened what is the opening of the seals then revealing Christ and the Very seven angels which represented the seven Church Aid churches all completed and we couldn't even see it they did they took the picture not us and here there he is standing there Supreme judge showing that he is Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end what identification quickening power did that to us amen I I I'm going to say something so that people don't people don't like the cloud they don't want to talk about the cloud anymore they maybe they get embarrassed about it I'm not embarrassed of the cloud and I'm going to tell you why I'm not embarrassed of the cloud because exactly what brother Branham spoke about it and exactly what is spoken of in as a missed great mystery in that magazine that's exactly what it is have you ever seen the launch of a uh uh what do they call it this like the Challenger the spacecraft those Rockets have you ever seen that what does the cloud look like straight line no it goes like this but then as it goes through levels of the atmosphere what happens it's not a line it's like this why is it like that because every layer of atmosphere is blowing in a different direction and then certain areas there's not even any any blowing at all so when you see that kind of thing happen you say okay that's the that's what the launch of a rocket looks like so instead we have this pyramid-shaped thing which was exactly prophesied brother Branham said it would be pyramid shape before it ever came and there it was pyramid shape on its side and it's up where there's not moisture and there's way more details there's a brother in uh in Georgia that that works at a nuclear plant and all he does is calculate moisture and he's he he spoke about this at length and studied it and said uh the the amount of moisture that comes from a rocket a ship is so small compared to the size of the cloud that that appeared in 1963. that it it literally is a joke to think that it was anything but an act of God the amount of moisture there's not there's not a no the amount of moisture that's in the cloud and I don't have the exact figures I can get them but the amount of moisture that's in that cloud that appeared is it literally dwarfs the the the the biggest rocket that we have in the world I mean it's it's one the biggest Rockets have one one thousandth of the moisture in in them that the mysterious cloud in 1963 had it was absolutely an act of God unexplainable by science still to this day what what was it it was showing Supreme judge oh brother Branham you're just pulling nonsense out of magazines okay you can think that but but to me what is it doing it's testifying in Scripture he's standing there the Supreme judge he's Alpha and Omega the beginning in the end amen amen trying to do God a service 1965. but now is the bride calling now is when the Seven Seals has been opened now when the complete things that the reformers left has to be opened and only Malachi 4 can do that because it takes the Revelation straight from God to an individual to do so yeah amen amen that's a two-fold thing takes a revelation straight from God to a prophet but then that Revelation has to go from being in the prophet's lips to being inside of you you have to get that Revelation not by scientific learning but but God taking his word by the Holy Spirit and writing that word on his heart how do how do I enter into this fullness of the word neither hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying unto the churches we're not saved by faith and then somehow we come into the fullness of the word by our good works it's by faith it's by a spiritual revelation God gives it to you and then what word are you feeding on it's by faith do you receive it do you believe it musicians come brother Branham came with thus saith the Lord to restore us back to the full word at the opening of the seals so that you and I can become that full word on us on display and you don't enter into it by being a good person you don't enter to it by being nice you enter into it by saying I hear what you're saying I heard I receive and now I'm living that word amen Heavenly Father we just come before you Lord and we're so thankful for your mercy Lord for your grace Lord you've given us eyes to see

predestinated seed when that light would come by the word would strike that seed it would come to life Lord and we're just saying amen to every word and saying Lord I've seen that seed come to life in
