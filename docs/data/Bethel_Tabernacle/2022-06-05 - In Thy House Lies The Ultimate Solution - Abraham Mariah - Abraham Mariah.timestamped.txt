[0:00] to her school
[0:01] and passed it amongst the teachers and
[0:03] um
[0:04] so
[0:05] in total the sales for the clothing and
[0:07] the shoes we raised 778 dollars
[0:11] so that was pretty awesome and then
[0:15] sister emily kolb
[0:16] made her
[0:18] delicious tamales i don't know if she's
[0:20] here right now but
[0:22] she's maybe out in the parking area
[0:24] still but she
[0:26] she alone made 152 dollars with the
[0:29] raising of sales from the sale of her
[0:31] tamales i think she's got back orders
[0:34] she's still working trying to fulfill
[0:37] that's a lot of work to make those
[0:39] things if you've never made them
[0:41] but
[0:42] uh we're going to continue to move
[0:45] forward with those type of events
[0:48] like to say praise the lord because he's
[0:51] been moving on the hearts of the
[0:52] individuals to give towards our cause to
[0:56] date
[0:57] we've had a lot of
[1:00] smaller contributions from our
[1:02] congregation for those on some of those
[1:04] online but we've had two
[1:07] very large
[1:09] offerings
[1:10] love offerings given towards our
[1:13] our
[1:14] building fund and we're at a total of
[1:17] thirty two thousand dollars as of today
[1:20] um maybe a little bit over brother jason
[1:22] said a little bit over thirty two
[1:24] thousand dollars
[1:26] um
[1:28] that being said i'd just like to thank
[1:31] all those that gave and um
[1:34] you know just pray a blessing upon those
[1:37] that gave and those that will give in
[1:38] the future
[1:40] if you've caught this vision
[1:42] for our church
[1:44] you know the need and the desire of our
[1:46] hearts is to
[1:48] to just grow as a church as lord has we
[1:51] don't want to
[1:53] build this church ourselves we want the
[1:55] lord to move on the hearts of the people
[1:58] and to bring them here as they feel that
[2:00] of the lord
[2:02] we've got two families here that have
[2:04] recently joined us in the last couple
[2:07] services brother ken johnson there in
[2:10] the back
[2:11] and um
[2:13] i'm gonna have to i wrote down how to
[2:15] pronounce um brother joe howdyshell
[2:18] is that did i say it right sister
[2:20] amen and his family so if if both you
[2:23] two families would wouldn't mind
[2:24] standing just so that people can
[2:27] recognize who you are because
[2:29] i don't even know myself
[2:31] [Applause]
[2:34] amen
[2:36] what a beautiful addition to bethel
[2:38] tabernacle and we're so happy to have
[2:40] you here with us sojourning
[2:42] joining us in worship as we
[2:46] progress in this great grandeur thing we
[2:49] call the rapture
[2:51] we're in progress
[2:52] of that catching away right now
[2:56] um
[2:57] so i just also want to
[2:59] you know i was the lord put on my heart
[3:02] last night something that
[3:04] something that was said by brother
[3:06] abraham i don't know what he said and i
[3:08] was trying to
[3:10] think about what he said that
[3:12] made me think about it but
[3:16] when he was preaching last night he
[3:18] mentioned something that made struck my
[3:20] heart about
[3:22] being a liberal
[3:24] giver
[3:25] and you know most of us as christians
[3:27] don't look at ourselves viewing life as
[3:29] liberals
[3:31] but we're more we're we're conservative
[3:34] christians for the most part not not
[3:36] being political just in our views
[3:40] and
[3:41] something he said last night
[3:43] made me think about the liberal
[3:48] in the context of being liberal in the
[3:50] context of giving
[3:52] and i looked up the scripture
[3:55] and
[3:57] i i wrote it down this morning and it's
[4:00] in uh proverbs 11 25
[4:03] and you know this is the the new uh
[4:07] i think it's the new living translation
[4:10] but it says
[4:11] a generous person will prosper and
[4:14] whoever refreshes others will be
[4:16] refreshed
[4:18] and
[4:19] if i would have read the the um king
[4:22] james version probably about 90 percent
[4:24] of us wouldn't have got it including me
[4:27] um so i had to look up the
[4:29] a different translation but that puts it
[4:32] very clearly
[4:33] that and prosperity doesn't mean being
[4:36] wealthy prosperity means god's blessing
[4:39] us spiritually first and foremost
[4:43] he blesses us with our health he best
[4:45] blesses us with
[4:47] a congregation that loves us and and
[4:50] and a pastor and a ministry team that
[4:53] are servants
[4:55] so i just want you to think of all that
[4:57] when you're praying that
[5:00] this here is not a is not a
[5:04] our goal isn't to necessarily seek a
[5:06] blessing
[5:08] but it's if you remember back brother
[5:10] jason he preached a sermon on cause and
[5:12] effect
[5:13] and um so it's it's near it's
[5:17] in simple words it's a reaction
[5:19] god's reaction to our action
[5:22] and it's it's the cause and effect of
[5:24] god's word
[5:25] that if we are givers and we give
[5:27] liberally
[5:29] liberally even to the point of hurt
[5:31] sometimes
[5:32] that we will be prosperous
[5:35] so with that being said the 32 000 in
[5:38] the building fund um
[5:40] talking with brother mark and brother
[5:42] jason it looks like we have enough money
[5:44] to actually break ground and start the
[5:46] project if we so feel led
[5:49] um to start in the with the fellowship
[5:51] hall that's phase two
[5:53] excuse me isn't that phase two i think
[5:57] i talking to brother mark this morning i
[5:59] think the brothers maybe need to sit
[6:01] down and talk about that more my initial
[6:04] thought and talking to brother mark this
[6:05] morning was
[6:07] if we did start the fellowship hall
[6:09] first that we could actually move into
[6:13] the fellowship hall when we were doing
[6:16] the sanctuary so i may have that
[6:18] backwards but in the next um
[6:21] in the next
[6:23] update i'll definitely have that
[6:25] straight
[6:26] i think a lot of that depends on
[6:29] the costs that are associated with each
[6:31] phase of the project
[6:36] so our next event we're trying to plan
[6:38] will be the yard sale bake sale slash
[6:41] car wash and
[6:43] we're looking at hopefully getting that
[6:46] started sometime this summer and we
[6:47] don't want to get too late into the
[6:49] summer because we'll be starting our
[6:51] plans for the upcoming youth camp
[6:54] and we don't want those two to collide
[6:56] and either one get shortchanged so we
[6:58] want to try to try to maybe get started
[7:01] with some planning for sometime in july
[7:03] i know it'll be hot
[7:06] but uh if we do it early enough in the
[7:08] morning get started early enough in the
[7:09] morning hopefully the lord will bring
[7:11] all the buyers to us and
[7:14] and
[7:15] sell everything out before the heat
[7:16] really gets bad and we're thinking about
[7:18] maybe um brother jason is going to talk
[7:21] to the
[7:22] owner of the building of yama's japanese
[7:25] steakhouse it used to be over there on
[7:26] the corner by urban nest and they're
[7:29] basically adjacent to one another so we
[7:31] could have the car wash in one lot in
[7:33] the bake sale in the
[7:35] yard sale in the lot of urban nest
[7:40] i think i feel like because they're
[7:42] adjacent to one another um a lot of
[7:45] people would get
[7:46] uh they would get the benefit of doing
[7:48] both brother jason made the he made the
[7:51] um
[7:52] put the idea together for if we sold
[7:55] like some some kind of food people could
[7:57] eat the food while their car was being
[7:59] washed and they could sell or
[8:01] you know browse through the um
[8:04] the yard sale items while their cars are
[8:06] being washed so young people get your
[8:08] sponges ready
[8:11] and um
[8:13] so that would be part of the plan and it
[8:14] looks like with our two new families we
[8:16] got plenty of more help
[8:18] from the young people
[8:20] so praise the lord god knew right
[8:23] and these two new families are they're
[8:26] actually they may not have caught what
[8:28] i'm talking about um in the first
[8:30] initial launch of this but
[8:33] you all are walking in god's vision
[8:36] for this tabernacle here
[8:38] and um you may not even have known
[8:41] exactly but your children and you are
[8:43] going to reap the benefits of that
[8:45] walking by faith and being here because
[8:48] we're going to put you to work
[8:50] you're not visitors anymore
[8:53] amen
[8:55] the honeymoon's over we're going to put
[8:56] you to work here in july
[8:59] um
[8:59] [Music]
[9:01] let's see
[9:04] yeah
[9:05] and i really don't have anything else to
[9:08] announce but if if anyone that is has
[9:11] any ideas of any other
[9:13] um
[9:14] building fund events that we could do
[9:18] please bring it to my attention or even
[9:20] brother matt's brother jd's
[9:23] brother jason
[9:24] doesn't really need to be bothered but
[9:26] if it's something that you feel like you
[9:28] want to talk to him about then fine
[9:30] bring it to him too
[9:34] and we're just looking forward to seeing
[9:35] what god will do yes because this is
[9:37] really all him and we're just being
[9:40] vessels
[9:41] surrendered to him and and however he
[9:43] wants to use us right
[9:46] all right praise the lord are you ready

[54:23] and that god in your house you have
[54:25] gathered

[54:28] and i'm praying that god will come
[54:31] and invade yourself unto us in a special
[54:33] way
[54:36] dealing with all your children
[54:38] according to their respective needs
[54:42] because you are that same high priest

[54:49] [Music]
[54:50] and we come to you sure
[54:54] knowing the lord you love us
[54:56] and you care for our welfare
[55:00] more better than we would do ourselves

[55:08] than we ever can ever understand
[55:13] lord i'm praying that you'll come

[55:18] and lord help us
[55:20] strengthen us
[55:22] heal every sick person

[55:35] and unbelief from our midis
[55:38] bringing us to the unit of faith
[55:40] the ultimate goal goal of our calling in
[55:44] such a time
[55:46] lord i thank you because you've always
[55:48] answered our prayers
[55:50] and i believe you'll do it this time
[55:52] again
[55:54] because we have vested believing
[55:56] in the unequaled and immature name of
[55:59] our lord jesus christ amen and amen
[56:04] well maybe before we see it i wanted
[56:06] just to read some scripture
[56:08] if you can open your bibles together
[56:10] with me
[56:14] we want to turn our bibles the book of
[56:16] second kings
[56:21] chapter four
[56:27] just some
[56:28] common scripture reading of course i
[56:31] know
[56:32] this must have been read and
[56:35] preached here many times
[56:39] second kings chapter 4 from verse 1 to
[56:42] verse 7 it says
[56:44] now they are cried a certain woman of
[56:47] the wives of the sons of the prophets
[56:49] and to elijah
[56:52] saying
[56:53] thy husband i mean sorry thy
[56:56] servant my husband is dead
[56:59] thou knowest that thy servant did fear
[57:02] the lord
[57:03] and the creditor
[57:05] is come
[57:06] to take unto him my two sons
[57:10] to be born men
[57:14] elijah said unto her what shall i do for
[57:17] thee
[57:18] tell me
[57:19] what has thou in the house
[57:22] and she said the dying handmaid has not
[57:26] anything in the house
[57:28] save a pot of oil
[57:34] then he said go and borrow the vessels
[57:36] abroad of all thy neighbors
[57:39] empty even empty vessels borrow not a
[57:43] few
[57:44] and when thou art come in thou shalt
[57:47] shut the door upon
[57:48] thee and upon thy sons
[57:51] and shall pour
[57:52] out into
[57:53] all those vessels
[57:56] and thou shalt set aside that which is
[57:58] food
[58:00] so she went from him and shut down and
[58:02] put her upon her sons
[58:04] who brought the vessels to her and she
[58:07] poured out
[58:09] came to pass
[58:10] when the vessels were full that he said
[58:13] unto her son bring me here a vessel
[58:16] and he said unto her there is not a
[58:18] vessel
[58:20] and the oil stayed
[58:24] then he came and told the man of god and
[58:27] say and he said go sell
[58:30] the oil and pay thy debt and live thou
[58:34] and thy children of the rest
[58:39] and i wanted to read also in the book of
[58:41] exodus chapter 4
[58:44] exodus chapter 4 the first four verses
[58:50] moses answered and said
[58:54] but behold they will not believe me
[58:57] nor hacking unto my voice
[59:00] for they will they will say
[59:02] the lord has not appeared unto thee
[59:06] and the lord said unto him what is that
[59:09] in thine hand
[59:11] and he said the road
[59:13] and he said he cast it on the ground
[59:16] and he cast it on the ground
[59:18] and he became a serpent
[59:20] and moses
[59:22] fled from before it
[59:24] and the lord said and moses put further
[59:27] in hand and take it by the tail
[59:30] and he put forth his hand and called it
[59:32] and became a road
[59:35] in his hand
[59:38] may god bless his word and bless you may
[59:41] be seated
[59:46] i salute you friends in the name of lord
[59:48] jesus christ this morning and
[59:50] i believe
[59:53] you've already been enjoying the
[59:55] princess of the lord
[59:57] such wonderful singing
[1:00:00] yeah
[1:00:01] i always tell the church i love singing
[1:00:03] more than preaching
[1:00:07] because preaching is something you know
[1:00:08] you'll have to answer for but singing
[1:00:11] you have nothing to answer for singing
[1:00:15] so i said i made a statement here one
[1:00:17] time i said i just preach because i like
[1:00:20] what i preach
[1:00:22] and because god told me to preach
[1:00:25] otherwise i don't like preaching but i
[1:00:27] like singing
[1:00:29] and i
[1:00:30] i've always told them if you can pray
[1:00:32] that god gives you a pastor i would just
[1:00:35] be comfortable being a songwriter
[1:00:38] because that is more comfortable for me
[1:00:42] so
[1:00:46] it has been a wonderful time having you
[1:00:48] i mean being with your friends and
[1:00:51] you know just fellowshipping around his
[1:00:53] word
[1:00:55] and of course you know we have been
[1:00:57] following something
[1:00:59] to do with bringing the bridegroom
[1:01:05] right into
[1:01:08] thy mother's chamber
[1:01:11] the final resting place
[1:01:15] and what a wonderful thought
[1:01:17] you know
[1:01:19] that like as we were talking about it
[1:01:20] with brother yesterday yesterday it's
[1:01:23] not time to flat around he was he was
[1:01:25] tired with flatting that's why he went
[1:01:28] away
[1:01:29] so he says this time if i'm coming
[1:01:32] i'm coming when you are ready to settle
[1:01:33] down and you are going to settle down as
[1:01:36] good as a dead body because i'm coming
[1:01:38] with anointing for the dead
[1:01:41] so that you don't have to you know i'm
[1:01:43] tired of the friendship you know
[1:01:45] boyfriend girlfriend kind of affair i
[1:01:48] want to settle down
[1:01:50] so this time he comes and he you know
[1:01:53] just like isaac took rebecca and placed
[1:01:55] her into the mother's house
[1:01:59] you know there's something about it
[1:02:01] here he she also brings him to the
[1:02:04] mothers house
[1:02:06] and now we found out that the mother's
[1:02:08] house is exactly you because that is the
[1:02:11] body because the mother is the holy
[1:02:13] spirit
[1:02:15] and the mother's house therefore is the
[1:02:16] temper of the holy spirit which is your
[1:02:18] body and that's the final resting place
[1:02:22] so that to me is is really wonderful
[1:02:26] i don't know about you
[1:02:27] so by maybe if i was not preaching to
[1:02:29] you then i was preaching to myself
[1:02:32] because this was the first time i was
[1:02:33] preaching that sermon so i was very
[1:02:35] happy i was very happy that
[1:02:38] i i i brought him to the final resting
[1:02:41] place
[1:02:42] glory oh god
[1:02:44] so now today
[1:02:48] i'm just wanting us to look at this
[1:02:50] story which is very common in the bible
[1:02:56] that there is a lady
[1:02:58] who has got a debt
[1:03:02] and the debt is demanding
[1:03:05] like the two sons will be taken maybe
[1:03:07] the man
[1:03:09] put them forth as some kind of
[1:03:10] collateral surety
[1:03:13] that if i fail to pay
[1:03:15] then you'll take my sons
[1:03:19] and here he has died
[1:03:21] and the debt has remained
[1:03:23] and the creditor has come
[1:03:25] and is taking these two sons
[1:03:28] and the woman goes to consult the
[1:03:30] prophet of course today we may not have
[1:03:32] the prophet physically percy to go and
[1:03:35] console him but you may go and consult
[1:03:37] him by way of listening to a temple
[1:03:40] reading the message book
[1:03:42] or even going to pray about what do i do
[1:03:47] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:03:50] and
[1:03:50] [Music]
[1:03:51] there's something interesting here
[1:03:57] because you realize that elijah doesn't
[1:04:01] say
[1:04:02] let me go and speak for you to the king
[1:04:05] you remember the other woman
[1:04:07] if we have to go back this one was a
[1:04:09] rich human
[1:04:11] in the book of second kings i think you
[1:04:14] know this woman was a rich one and but
[1:04:17] elijah promised was willing in second
[1:04:21] kings i think chapter 4 verse 13 if you
[1:04:24] look at that
[1:04:28] he says and he said unto him say now
[1:04:30] unto her behold thou has been careful
[1:04:33] for us with all his care
[1:04:35] what is to be done for thee
[1:04:38] would this thou be spoken for to the
[1:04:40] king
[1:04:41] or to the captain of the host and she
[1:04:44] asked that i dwell among my only people
[1:04:46] so elisha wanted to speak for this woman
[1:04:49] who had a husband
[1:04:51] only that she was buried and elijah knew
[1:04:55] that the problem of buriedness could not
[1:04:57] be solved by the king
[1:05:00] so you see it's a little bit
[1:05:03] different
[1:05:04] he wants to speak for a rich human i
[1:05:06] mean you would only speak to the king
[1:05:08] for a ricky person
[1:05:10] i mean for a person who is poor
[1:05:13] that maybe the king would intervene and
[1:05:15] give her some money but this was a rich
[1:05:18] human this shulamite woman was rich she
[1:05:21] even offered to build for elijah a house
[1:05:24] a room and he put everything there
[1:05:28] now elisha is feeling so comfortable and
[1:05:30] he feels like he's he always deserving
[1:05:33] something and then he says what do you
[1:05:35] want he knows
[1:05:37] there is a need but he doesn't mention
[1:05:39] the need of that woman he doesn't talk
[1:05:41] about barriness he says who do you want
[1:05:44] me to speak for you to the king
[1:05:46] and the woman says i don't need anything
[1:05:48] from the king because i you know
[1:05:50] physically speaking she was well off she
[1:05:52] was a well to do my woman together with
[1:05:54] her husband she was no widow
[1:05:56] she was no refugee
[1:05:59] why would he want to speak up for her to
[1:06:01] the king
[1:06:03] and now here comes someone who'd
[1:06:05] actually fit that
[1:06:10] but he doesn't mention anything about
[1:06:12] speaking for her to the king
[1:06:17] because these are two different people
[1:06:19] but although both of them were believers
[1:06:22] if you can know
[1:06:25] but this one was the wife of a prophet
[1:06:27] this one was just a believer
[1:06:30] they are two different and you will
[1:06:32] realize that this tuna might woman was
[1:06:34] living in laodicea because he says i
[1:06:36] have no need of nothing
[1:06:39] so it was going to take the minister of
[1:06:41] elisha when it brings desperation one
[1:06:44] day when that child dies and things like
[1:06:46] that when he has he points out that this
[1:06:49] woman is barren
[1:06:51] and then the woman is given a child by
[1:06:54] the spoken word and eventually that
[1:06:56] child dies and eventually like that the
[1:06:58] story goes on until one day by the
[1:07:00] prophet's message he tells her to
[1:07:03] migrate god the land of the philistines
[1:07:05] and be there for seven years because
[1:07:07] there's going to be farming and then
[1:07:08] when she comes back she's needed
[1:07:12] because hala and her garden her her
[1:07:15] crops have been taken over and then
[1:07:18] she wants to be spoken for to the king
[1:07:20] but she doesn't know somebody because
[1:07:23] she turned it down in
[1:07:26] that elisha wanted to introduce her to
[1:07:29] the king
[1:07:31] but she by the laodicean anointing says
[1:07:35] i have no need of anything
[1:07:38] i don't need
[1:07:40] any support so she missed the golden
[1:07:44] chance of being introduced to the king
[1:07:46] before she could go to the philistines
[1:07:49] land and migrate and be there seven
[1:07:52] years a type of the seven church ages
[1:07:57] and then there was going to be a holy
[1:07:59] convocation of returning back
[1:08:02] to her promise
[1:08:04] and then that's when she
[1:08:06] remembered i wish
[1:08:08] i had been spoken for to the king
[1:08:11] because the king would have known me now
[1:08:13] i would have just gone and told the king
[1:08:16] this is my land but she had no
[1:08:18] connection so she went there she was
[1:08:20] waiting until the right time the
[1:08:23] opportunity came when the king was
[1:08:25] asking gehazi to relate to him all the
[1:08:29] miracles that
[1:08:31] he had witnessed in the ministry of
[1:08:33] elisha
[1:08:36] and
[1:08:37] when
[1:08:38] he has started talking about the a
[1:08:40] certain woman who was barren and then
[1:08:43] she she was spoken for i mean prayed for
[1:08:46] and she got a child and the child died
[1:08:49] and then eventually he was brought back
[1:08:51] to life that human springs up in that
[1:08:54] he says i am that woman
[1:08:59] i think i preached something about that
[1:09:01] the bride is mentioned ever positioned
[1:09:03] within the elijah ministry it's one of
[1:09:06] the summer the same way i preached
[1:09:08] now
[1:09:09] here we come
[1:09:11] we look at this human
[1:09:14] who actually needs to be spoken for to
[1:09:16] the king because she's poor she's in
[1:09:18] that she's a widow and elijah doesn't
[1:09:22] mention that
[1:09:28] glory be oh god
[1:09:30] because this woman is actually
[1:09:33] typing
[1:09:35] a need a church
[1:09:39] church in need
[1:09:41] and you know we are not going to be
[1:09:44] looking elsewhere because our help comes
[1:09:46] from above
[1:09:51] and i mean i want to tell you something
[1:09:53] today
[1:09:54] there is no problem there is no trial
[1:09:57] there is no sickness there is no you
[1:10:00] know complication in your health that
[1:10:02] takes you
[1:10:04] that comes upon you like it is
[1:10:06] surprising god
[1:10:08] god doesn't wake up from sleep and only
[1:10:10] to realize you have got cancer you have
[1:10:12] got diabetes you have got this you have
[1:10:14] got that there is this complication he
[1:10:17] is not surprised
[1:10:18] in other words in any case he puts into
[1:10:22] place a solution before he allows a
[1:10:24] problem to come the only difference that
[1:10:27] we have is we always look at the problem
[1:10:30] while god looks at the solution
[1:10:33] for according to god your problem is
[1:10:35] already solved according to you your
[1:10:38] problem is there and it's too much
[1:10:43] so god knows that you your problems are
[1:10:45] already catered for otherwise you would
[1:10:48] have called you and secondly that one
[1:10:50] would make him an a god who is not
[1:10:52] infinite in finite he's infinite
[1:10:55] he knows the end from the beginning and
[1:10:57] he's a provider and he cares for you and
[1:11:00] he knows you by name and the bible says
[1:11:02] your name is written on the palm of his
[1:11:04] hands every time he stretches for his
[1:11:06] hand your name is there and the bible
[1:11:08] says unto whom is the arm of the lord
[1:11:10] revealed it is revealed to you and is
[1:11:13] revealed to you every time he stretches
[1:11:15] forth his hand your name is there
[1:11:17] he knows you by name
[1:11:19] so how could he know you by name and he
[1:11:21] doesn't know and if the prophet says
[1:11:23] that even a little ba a little what he
[1:11:26] does is call it
[1:11:28] the smallest thing on earth
[1:11:31] he cannot die without him knowing
[1:11:36] now this widow
[1:11:38] goes to the prophet
[1:11:40] and he has she has a debt
[1:11:43] and a collateral to her sons
[1:11:47] and it is not her
[1:11:49] she is not the one who went to borrow
[1:11:51] the money
[1:11:53] it is just a car over
[1:11:56] and some of us are here suffering by
[1:11:58] things that we didn't actually do
[1:12:02] we are just being haunted
[1:12:04] by the past
[1:12:07] the sins of your father your mother your
[1:12:09] grandmother your grandfather all those
[1:12:11] things that he did they did
[1:12:13] haunting you
[1:12:15] spirits characters
[1:12:18] complexes
[1:12:19] that follow you
[1:12:21] and you are just a victim
[1:12:24] you have a debt to pay that you never
[1:12:28] encounter directly
[1:12:30] it's a debt
[1:12:31] but it's been carried over to you
[1:12:37] and then you are wondering how am i
[1:12:39] going to do this how am i going to solve
[1:12:42] this
[1:12:43] but now today i'm talking about
[1:12:46] something that i've titled in thy house
[1:12:50] lies the ultimate solution
[1:12:53] in thy house
[1:12:57] lies the ultimate solution to all your
[1:13:00] problems
[1:13:04] so what you have to do is just my
[1:13:05] subject is highlighting the little but
[1:13:08] also loving reality that lies within you
[1:13:13] so time has come for just to highlight
[1:13:16] it
[1:13:18] and that's what the preaching of the
[1:13:19] word does that's why god put here
[1:13:22] preachers
[1:13:23] to highlight
[1:13:25] what is new to highlight what is faith
[1:13:27] to highlight god's power to highlight
[1:13:30] his capabilities to highlight his love
[1:13:32] for you he's care for you to make it
[1:13:34] plain
[1:13:37] and if you have if you have eyes to see
[1:13:40] and if you have faith to grasp
[1:13:44] and if you know if i am a child of god
[1:13:46] and i know i'm a child of god and all
[1:13:47] that god god has his mind then you know
[1:13:50] that this is mine
[1:13:52] then you'll go and take it by faith come
[1:13:55] on let me hope i'm going to speak freely
[1:13:57] today and i'm speaking to god's children
[1:13:59] and somebody will help me and say amen
[1:14:04] if you don't i will say it myself
[1:14:08] because i'm not preaching only to you
[1:14:10] i'm preaching to myself
[1:14:14] glory be to god maybe the problem i have
[1:14:17] is not i'm not a good preacher that is
[1:14:20] the only problem
[1:14:22] glory be to god
[1:14:25] so now
[1:14:27] this particular widow
[1:14:29] is going to the prophet and you know
[1:14:31] what the bible says
[1:14:33] before we go that
[1:14:34] you know the prophet says you know the
[1:14:37] ministry that we have is dealing with a
[1:14:39] sickest body sickest
[1:14:46] the sickest and most needed body in the
[1:14:48] world is the church the blood of christ
[1:14:50] this is what he says in the message i
[1:14:52] think
[1:14:53] go awake jesus he says but there is
[1:14:56] more to the ministry than divine healing
[1:15:00] there's more to the ministry than just
[1:15:02] divine healing see
[1:15:04] and yet he comes down and says the
[1:15:06] sickest but i know of tonight
[1:15:08] is the so-called body of jesus christ it
[1:15:11] needs the spiritual healing
[1:15:14] ah spiritual healing will automatically
[1:15:16] bring physical healing not the other way
[1:15:18] around
[1:15:20] because i have seen people whom god has
[1:15:22] healed terrible terrible diseases
[1:15:26] but they are not even in the church
[1:15:28] i have seen and i know a man who was
[1:15:30] completing the lame you have had my
[1:15:32] testimony until his legs were twisted
[1:15:34] and were facing this part was facing his
[1:15:36] face dangling like this the hands could
[1:15:38] not hold anything and then i prayed for
[1:15:40] the man and the man was able to raise up
[1:15:42] as god told me and he rode the bicycle
[1:15:45] in three weeks and came to church and
[1:15:47] now he's not in the church he's out of
[1:15:48] church for more than 15 years
[1:15:50] he's there
[1:15:53] so it's not a physical healing that
[1:15:56] brings the spiritual healing it's the
[1:15:57] spiritual healing that brings the
[1:15:59] physical that settles everything
[1:16:03] that's why the greatest miracle is that
[1:16:06] miracle of the salvation of your soul as
[1:16:08] the prophet says so he says there is
[1:16:11] only one balm that i know that will heal
[1:16:15] and that is the word
[1:16:20] and that is this
[1:16:21] that is the sick body that we want to
[1:16:24] stand up in the strength and the vitamin
[1:16:28] power of the gospel and that's why i use
[1:16:31] much of the time now in trying to
[1:16:34] strengthen the church by the word
[1:16:38] so the sickest body
[1:16:41] the most in the body
[1:16:42] is the god of christ the church
[1:16:47] now this woman was in debt
[1:16:49] not exactly because she borrowed the
[1:16:51] money and gave the signs as collateral
[1:16:52] we have said that or security for the
[1:16:54] loan but it was inherited the debt
[1:16:57] and most of us are here suffering it's
[1:16:59] not what you do mostly it's what you
[1:17:02] inherited our father adam
[1:17:04] broke the word
[1:17:06] but we thank god the second adam
[1:17:09] second adam came
[1:17:11] to give us the victory over that
[1:17:15] blessed be the name of the lord and you
[1:17:16] know the scripture there is this
[1:17:18] interesting verse in romans chapter 13
[1:17:20] verse 8
[1:17:21] what does he say oh we no man anything
[1:17:26] or we know man anything
[1:17:31] but
[1:17:31] to love one another
[1:17:34] for he that loves another has fulfilled
[1:17:37] the law
[1:17:39] no
[1:17:41] so this woman had a debt
[1:17:45] and it had to be paid
[1:17:48] and she goes to the prophet
[1:17:51] and she didn't know that what you pay
[1:17:54] the debt
[1:17:55] is already in the house
[1:18:01] the prophet gave her nothing
[1:18:03] never gave her even a coin of money
[1:18:07] never even prayed for her
[1:18:10] come on come here i lay hands on you
[1:18:12] cast out the demon of poverty
[1:18:18] oh
[1:18:19] glory be to god
[1:18:24] you have a little pot of oil and a pot
[1:18:27] of oil of course stands for the holy
[1:18:28] ghost and the holy ghost is jesus christ
[1:18:31] and the holy ghost is the word the word
[1:18:33] is that spirit you have the word in you
[1:18:36] in your home
[1:18:38] that solves it
[1:18:40] and you are coming to me because you
[1:18:42] don't know the mystery the potentials
[1:18:44] that is within the world that you
[1:18:46] already have
[1:18:48] the man you took to your mother's house
[1:18:52] why is he there
[1:18:56] why would you run around looking for
[1:18:58] solutions from elsewhere when you have
[1:19:01] got that oil
[1:19:04] you've got the holy
[1:19:06] spirit and the other day i read you i
[1:19:09] think a quote where the prophet says
[1:19:10] when you have got the holy spirit you
[1:19:12] don't need the faith because the holy
[1:19:14] spirit is that faith the only thing that
[1:19:16] you need is to know how to operate the
[1:19:19] faith
[1:19:21] that's all
[1:19:23] so you brought him now in the house
[1:19:26] and he's in the house
[1:19:28] so the prophet says
[1:19:30] so what do you have in your house
[1:19:35] that's the question friends
[1:19:37] you have a problem you have this you
[1:19:39] have that i have stress i have
[1:19:41] depression i have this financial crisis
[1:19:43] i have this one i'm sick of this i'm i'm
[1:19:45] harming this pain i have this one this
[1:19:46] one is against me my neighbors my
[1:19:48] parents my wife my husband my children
[1:19:51] my this my dad okay what do you have in
[1:19:54] your house
[1:19:59] i'm not surprised that you have that
[1:20:00] problem
[1:20:01] there's something that i put in your
[1:20:03] house
[1:20:05] there is something that is in your house
[1:20:09] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:20:14] and and and you know the other day i was
[1:20:16] you know
[1:20:17] maybe let me wait a little bit let me
[1:20:19] not go into that
[1:20:21] let's go back to exodus chapter 4.
[1:20:25] moses wanted a sign
[1:20:28] and god didn't say go to the bush and
[1:20:31] cut some particular stick
[1:20:35] he says what is that already in your
[1:20:38] hand
[1:20:42] that which you already have
[1:20:44] is what i'm going to use
[1:20:51] not go and cut this get this go attend a
[1:20:54] certain revival somewhere go here and
[1:20:56] that no
[1:20:58] what is that in your hand moses
[1:21:01] my little old walking road glory to god
[1:21:04] can you throw it down man
[1:21:07] put down
[1:21:10] and when he throws it down what came out
[1:21:13] of it shocked him
[1:21:16] did you know when brother branham wanted
[1:21:18] some squirrel and god says speak it yes
[1:21:23] he spoke and the squirrels appeared but
[1:21:26] he could not even believe that he has
[1:21:28] created the squirrels by his mouth he
[1:21:31] could rub his face and say come on
[1:21:34] am i seeing a vision or reality
[1:21:40] he didn't know that he could create
[1:21:45] god didn't tell him to go and fast some
[1:21:47] three days some two days
[1:21:51] you have it already
[1:21:53] it's already in you
[1:21:55] as long as the need arises and is a
[1:21:58] genuinely need and you want it done you
[1:22:01] have what it takes you have the
[1:22:03] wherewithal the only thing is you have
[1:22:05] to be in constant connection with the
[1:22:08] one the offer the off of that and then
[1:22:12] when he just inspires you and tells you
[1:22:14] to speak it to do it it's gonna happen
[1:22:17] so the solution to all your problems you
[1:22:19] are not going to look for some kind of
[1:22:23] superman somewhere
[1:22:27] not some super preacher not some
[1:22:29] superman special man
[1:22:32] from europe from america from africa no

[1:22:46] book a little book that i took from the
[1:22:49] angels and no you just take the book and
[1:22:51] eat it when you have eaten the book you
[1:22:54] become the book you become the final
[1:22:56] resting place of the book and then what
[1:22:58] happens whatever the book was
[1:23:01] all the full redemption rights and
[1:23:03] benefits you are able to get them by
[1:23:05] faith throw it down
[1:23:08] and
[1:23:10] oh i wish i would be powerful brother
[1:23:12] you are already powerful
[1:23:18] are we no man anything you have many
[1:23:20] debts

[1:23:35] this they died how could you pay that
[1:23:39] he that is in you is the one who came
[1:23:41] and paid it all
[1:23:43] jesus paid it all
[1:23:47] oh
[1:23:49] to him my oh
[1:23:51] glory to god so he came and paid all
[1:23:54] that i owed and then now i owe it all to
[1:23:58] him
[1:23:59] i am here for him he bought me by paying
[1:24:02] what i couldn't pay
[1:24:04] and now if i paid i'm free
[1:24:07] i am not demanded i mean certain you can
[1:24:10] now stand on that ground and say devil
[1:24:14] i owe you nothing
[1:24:17] glory to god i owe you nothing
[1:24:23] i have the receipt
[1:24:25] it's already paid
[1:24:27] i demand it
[1:24:29] it's mine
[1:24:31] jesus paid it
[1:24:34] and who wrote
[1:24:36] who wrote
[1:24:38] the receipt for you
[1:24:40] do you know that if the devil knew that
[1:24:43] by killing jesus he was giving you
[1:24:46] healing redemption and salvation he
[1:24:48] wouldn't have done it
[1:24:50] because he was shooting his own ugly
[1:24:53] foot
[1:24:56] he was maiming himself
[1:24:59] he didn't know that he's written by his
[1:25:02] stripes you are healed so he came and he
[1:25:05] was the one busy whipping jesus
[1:25:09] whipping jesus and there were stripes
[1:25:11] all over their body
[1:25:12] and he didn't know that he was writing
[1:25:15] the writing that sets you free he was
[1:25:18] writing the receipt on the blood of
[1:25:20] christ
[1:25:22] and those stripes on the blood of christ
[1:25:24] set you free
[1:25:26] and the devil cannot only do what he did
[1:25:28] because that jesus actually died and was
[1:25:31] buried
[1:25:32] he cannot and do it it's already done
[1:25:35] who wrote the receipt the devil himself
[1:25:37] using his people
[1:25:39] he wrote it
[1:25:40] on the word of christ by his stripes you
[1:25:43] are healed so he wrote there is
[1:25:46] the stripes himself he whipped jesus and
[1:25:48] the stripes ripped through all his body
[1:25:51] and he cannot deny it
[1:25:57] devil you cannot deny it you did it
[1:25:59] there is a receipt you are the one who
[1:26:01] wrote it
[1:26:04] i'm quoting what you did
[1:26:06] and you did it yourself sorry for you
[1:26:09] but i'm free for what you did
[1:26:16] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:26:18] i am not guilty devil you are guilty you
[1:26:21] are guilty because you are the one who
[1:26:23] wrote it
[1:26:25] and you signed it
[1:26:30] so i'm just here claiming my liberty let
[1:26:32] me he paid it what i couldn't pay
[1:26:36] lord oh god
[1:26:37] so he says
[1:26:39] i want to just go a little bit here
[1:26:43] this woman here coming to the prophet
[1:26:47] of course i said elijah didn't give her
[1:26:48] holy money
[1:26:50] he didn't speak for her to the king
[1:26:54] or even offer a prayer for her
[1:26:56] sometimes you don't even need prayer
[1:27:03] where where where
[1:27:07] that one is
[1:27:08] a new one
[1:27:11] you may not even need a prayer
[1:27:13] you just have to change your attitude
[1:27:15] to that which is in you
[1:27:20] some demons don't go by prayer by the
[1:27:21] way
[1:27:22] you just have to change your face from a
[1:27:24] gloomy one and you start smiling and
[1:27:26] that that funny spirit around your
[1:27:28] husband goes
[1:27:34] yes
[1:27:37] some people many people are dying
[1:27:39] because of lack of love just show him
[1:27:41] love show how love and those funny
[1:27:44] spirits will those you know and he
[1:27:46] called the four tantrums and
[1:27:48] you know you know chorus psalms just
[1:27:54] he doesn't even need sometimes prayer
[1:27:57] glory to god
[1:27:59] so now he didn't pray for her he just
[1:28:01] pointed back to what she has now let us
[1:28:05] ask ourselves a question
[1:28:07] what if she had decided i have nothing
[1:28:10] completely
[1:28:16] it may be so little but you have it
[1:28:21] don't always say me i have nothing
[1:28:24] how can you be here a believer you say i
[1:28:26] have nothing
[1:28:29] how could you come here and even be
[1:28:31] baptized in jesus name and you have
[1:28:33] nothing
[1:28:35] how can you sit here and listen to this
[1:28:37] one preacher and you say amen and you
[1:28:39] say i have nothing
[1:28:41] you have something
[1:28:43] there's something in you
[1:28:45] that's what brings you here
[1:28:47] that's why that's what makes you thirsty
[1:28:49] hungry and you love him and you are
[1:28:51] there's something there otherwise you
[1:28:54] don't be here
[1:28:55] no matter how little it is
[1:28:57] it's there
[1:28:59] but the devil wants to tell you you have
[1:29:01] nothing
[1:29:02] you are nothing you are going nuts you
[1:29:04] are nowhere you will achieve nothing but
[1:29:06] there is something there already
[1:29:10] oh i wish i could be a good preacher he
[1:29:12] would start preaching now on that one
[1:29:16] what if he had to say that i have
[1:29:17] nothing
[1:29:19] but she said well i only have a little
[1:29:22] borrow
[1:29:23] a little port of oil
[1:29:25] that's all it takes
[1:29:27] this little light of mine
[1:29:30] i'm gonna let it shine
[1:29:34] this little light of mine this little
[1:29:36] faith of mine this little purchase of my
[1:29:39] this little and the urs of mine this
[1:29:41] little vat of mine glory oh god i'm
[1:29:44] going to let it spread its wings i'm
[1:29:46] going to let it shine i'm let go and set
[1:29:49] it free
[1:29:51] it was as long as it is in the pot
[1:29:54] it will do nothing
[1:30:00] little
[1:30:01] yes
[1:30:01] but that's where god wants to work
[1:30:06] the solution is in your house
[1:30:09] and you are crying
[1:30:11] you are running everywhere
[1:30:13] i need this i need somebody help me
[1:30:16] somebody pray for me somebody support me
[1:30:19] somebody cared for me somebody showed me
[1:30:21] love somebody the comforter is there
[1:30:25] the holy ghost is the comforter
[1:30:32] i think it's somewhere in the book of
[1:30:33] psalms that he says i communed with
[1:30:35] myself upon my bed
[1:30:39] you can commune with yourself have you
[1:30:41] found someone talking with himself
[1:30:45] and that's what we are believers you
[1:30:47] know you can look like you you are
[1:30:49] neurotic like you're complicated i mean
[1:30:51] you know you're confused
[1:30:53] like you are running crazy because you
[1:30:55] can even sometimes talk with yourself
[1:30:57] and i'm not crazy because i am 21. there
[1:31:00] is the bridegroom and there is the bride
[1:31:01] part of it so the two are communicating
[1:31:03] maybe sometimes it slips out and it's a
[1:31:05] bit louder than it's supposed to be
[1:31:12] but i'm not crazy the two are
[1:31:13] communicating
[1:31:15] so when this one is complaining the
[1:31:16] other one says but you're a believer
[1:31:18] you're a child of god you believe in god
[1:31:19] all is well he said yes lord i believe
[1:31:21] i'm i now repent you are talking to
[1:31:24] yourself this one is complaining this
[1:31:26] one is answering back this one is asking
[1:31:28] a question this one is giving a solution
[1:31:30] this one is crying this one is soothing
[1:31:32] this one is comforting there are two in
[1:31:34] one there is you and there is him
[1:31:40] he that is in you
[1:31:45] glory be to god
[1:31:48] blessed be the name of that i told
[1:31:49] brother yes and i just come here to
[1:31:51] chase the moves out of the forest so
[1:31:53] that he shoots
[1:31:54] now i think he can he better comes and
[1:31:56] shoot
[1:32:00] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:32:03] so
[1:32:04] he says what is that in your house
[1:32:09] and you know this puts me back
[1:32:13] to something that is very critical
[1:32:17] back then you can i think there is a
[1:32:19] minister who by now this week will be
[1:32:21] losing his house
[1:32:23] because they go
[1:32:24] and borrow the money from the banks from
[1:32:27] the learning groups
[1:32:29] and you don't have any way you think
[1:32:32] you're going to pay that money maybe for
[1:32:34] your employee then you have a salary
[1:32:37] coming
[1:32:40] but now you go
[1:32:42] and borrow money
[1:32:45] and you put your house or land whatever
[1:32:48] as a surety
[1:32:51] and you can imagine someone is ba is
[1:32:53] borrowing
[1:32:54] let's say the equivalent of
[1:32:58] four hundred dollars
[1:33:00] or five hundred dollars
[1:33:02] and it's posting as a surety land which
[1:33:05] is more than
[1:33:06] maybe two thousand dollars
[1:33:13] and i want us to go back and look at
[1:33:16] this scripture critically
[1:33:19] because there is a scripture which
[1:33:21] really rang so
[1:33:23] clearly to me
[1:33:26] when you go to matthew chapter 13
[1:33:30] matthew chapter 13 i think verse 12.
[1:33:38] he says
[1:33:40] for whosoever hath
[1:33:43] to him shall be given
[1:33:47] and he shall have more abundance
[1:33:52] but whosoever has not
[1:33:55] from him shall be taken away even that
[1:33:59] which he has
[1:34:01] now how do you look at that verse
[1:34:07] he has
[1:34:10] he that he has shall be added
[1:34:12] he that has not even that which he has
[1:34:15] shall be taken away from him
[1:34:17] it means it depends on the confession of
[1:34:20] the two
[1:34:24] because how is it that he that has not
[1:34:28] he has something that is going to be
[1:34:29] taken away from him
[1:34:34] he had but he said or overlooked that
[1:34:38] what he had and he said i don't have
[1:34:44] so he went to look for that which he
[1:34:47] thinks he doesn't have
[1:34:50] like you go for a loan
[1:34:53] and you put what you have as a
[1:34:55] collateral
[1:34:57] and then the devil uses the loan to
[1:35:00] snatch what you have
[1:35:04] and then when you lose a land or a house
[1:35:06] that is more than three thousand dollars
[1:35:08] like in our place not here
[1:35:14] because of 400
[1:35:17] then you begin to realize i had
[1:35:19] something after all
[1:35:22] which was better than what i went for
[1:35:27] why would i put my home as a collateral
[1:35:33] for two for hand for four hundred five
[1:35:35] hundred dollars when my home is five
[1:35:38] thousand dollars
[1:35:40] and then when i begin to fail to pay
[1:35:43] the bank now comes and sells my home
[1:35:48] why didn't i pick a piece of my land and
[1:35:51] sell a part of it and solve my problem
[1:35:53] and remain with my home
[1:35:59] now i overlooked the greta that i have
[1:36:02] and said i have nothing that's why i
[1:36:04] want to borrow
[1:36:06] [Music]
[1:36:08] and then the devil uses what i ha i
[1:36:11] what he has given me
[1:36:13] to hook
[1:36:15] what i have
[1:36:20] blessed be the name of the lord and this
[1:36:22] is what is you know everywhere brother
[1:36:24] my house is being taken rather my hou i
[1:36:26] always tell them brother
[1:36:30] why didn't you first of all look at what
[1:36:32] you have
[1:36:36] god is always able to use that wick you
[1:36:39] have
[1:36:41] but we always overlook what we already
[1:36:43] have
[1:36:45] and we go for what we don't have
[1:36:49] we overlook the healing you vacuuming us
[1:36:52] and you opt for some expensive
[1:36:56] treatment somewhere
[1:37:00] did you try what you have
[1:37:03] did you seek the interfere in
[1:37:06] intervention of that which is in you
[1:37:08] did you wait upon god
[1:37:10] no
[1:37:14] you went for some substitute
[1:37:18] glory be to god and that's why as we
[1:37:20] stay along on this time i mean on this
[1:37:23] earth we begin to overlook the
[1:37:25] importance the value the potentials the
[1:37:27] power of the world that is in us
[1:37:30] and we begin to look as if the world has
[1:37:32] better things to offer to us
[1:37:35] if the world had better things to offer
[1:37:37] to us why did god send his son
[1:37:40] all right
[1:37:43] and why are you saved
[1:37:45] why are you a believer why do you come
[1:37:47] to church
[1:37:49] why would you go
[1:37:52] to be on a certain expensive like you
[1:37:55] know
[1:37:55] natural hubs and so forth chinese made
[1:37:58] south african made
[1:38:00] american made european made you know
[1:38:02] they call them products natural products
[1:38:04] you have to take this product plus this
[1:38:07] product times this time with that and
[1:38:09] you become an expert in this and that to
[1:38:12] in order to deal with this problem have
[1:38:14] you tried that which is in you
[1:38:21] have you given it a try
[1:38:23] have you tried to deal with this one you
[1:38:25] have problem by he that is in you
[1:38:28] have you sold him have you tried to wake
[1:38:30] up your jesus said jesus i have this
[1:38:32] problem
[1:38:34] why do you believe in him why do you
[1:38:36] believe in him why do you say i'm a
[1:38:38] believer i believe of what
[1:38:41] what do you believe
[1:38:44] a believer does what
[1:38:47] what is the benefits of a believer
[1:38:50] okay now that you're a believer what are
[1:38:51] your benefits
[1:38:54] what did he what receipt did jesus give
[1:38:56] you what do you have
[1:39:00] faith is the substance yes okay what is
[1:39:02] something where is your substance
[1:39:05] faith is not a theory
[1:39:09] it's a fact but it's also an act
[1:39:15] so jesus i mean this prophet puts us
[1:39:18] puts the woman back to that which is in
[1:39:21] her
[1:39:22] that which is in her house
[1:39:25] to the man that is in your house
[1:39:28] the man you brought
[1:39:31] in the house the whole the oil that is
[1:39:34] in you
[1:39:35] can solve all your problems
[1:39:38] and even move not only your problems you
[1:39:41] can even bring your neighbors and fill
[1:39:44] the airports
[1:39:45] you can feel all
[1:39:48] the pots the vessels of the neighbors as
[1:39:50] long as they come with empathy
[1:39:52] that which is in you you remember the
[1:39:54] holy spirit that moved from moses and
[1:39:57] filled the 70 until they all prophesied
[1:40:02] and moses was not you know weakened they
[1:40:04] all listened because this his spirit has
[1:40:07] gone on these ones
[1:40:09] no
[1:40:11] so there is something going on
[1:40:13] blessed be the name of the lord so i'm
[1:40:16] not here to castigate you
[1:40:18] or to make you look like you are not
[1:40:20] believers
[1:40:23] but i'm just trying to shake our
[1:40:24] conscience
[1:40:26] to come to understand who we who are we
[1:40:29] so if jesus is in us what are the
[1:40:31] benefits what are we what are we getting
[1:40:33] from him what is he getting from us
[1:40:36] how are you how are we showing his glory
[1:40:40] why do we want to live on the same level
[1:40:42] like those who don't have him
[1:40:45] huh
[1:40:46] what is the difference we are putting
[1:40:48] between ourselves and them
[1:40:50] what is the difference between the word
[1:40:52] bride
[1:40:53] and the foolish virgins and their own
[1:40:54] denominations where is my difference in
[1:40:57] character in life in testimony power and
[1:40:59] anointing and revelation where is the
[1:41:02] difference
[1:41:04] time has come for the crying poor woman
[1:41:08] to unleash by revelation what has been
[1:41:11] lying dormant in her until the neighbors
[1:41:13] will come to know
[1:41:15] my pot my vessel was also filled by the
[1:41:18] little oil by the little pot in the
[1:41:21] woman's house
[1:41:23] go and burn the neighbors
[1:41:25] your body your vessels will not be
[1:41:27] enough
[1:41:30] amen
[1:41:31] blessed be the name i hope you are
[1:41:33] catching with me what i'm trying to talk
[1:41:35] about
[1:41:40] glory be to god the prophet says we have
[1:41:43] enough power let me come back here
[1:41:46] where i was you know
[1:41:48] when you come to this
[1:41:50] the prophet says
[1:41:58] one had just a vessel
[1:42:00] with a little oil in it
[1:42:03] she had nothing else
[1:42:05] apart from her her two sons
[1:42:07] was going to be solely for born men
[1:42:10] bodies men
[1:42:11] she had nothing else
[1:42:13] she could do
[1:42:15] with
[1:42:16] this little vest of oil wasn't very much
[1:42:19] she was at the end
[1:42:22] and elijah said raha
[1:42:25] said what have you got in your house
[1:42:29] she said
[1:42:30] just a little oil in a vessel
[1:42:33] said go to your neighbors and borrow
[1:42:35] plenty of them
[1:42:37] there
[1:42:38] look getting ready before it even
[1:42:41] happens
[1:42:42] getting ready before it even
[1:42:44] happens
[1:42:46] get ready david had the sound in the
[1:42:49] boundary mulberry bushes
[1:42:51] and i just saw a cloud just like this
[1:42:54] the size of a hand and he says i hear
[1:42:57] the sound of abundance of rain if god
[1:43:00] can only get some empty vessels right
[1:43:03] that's right he said fill the house full
[1:43:06] of them full of what empty vessels
[1:43:09] now glory be to god are we going to be
[1:43:11] afraid of people coming here empty
[1:43:16] this should be something here to fill
[1:43:18] them
[1:43:19] are we going to be afraid when they seek
[1:43:21] come here they let them come here
[1:43:22] they're paralyzed
[1:43:25] no there should be something here to
[1:43:26] help with him
[1:43:28] so we are here to invite
[1:43:32] glory to god but you know you are only
[1:43:34] very comfortable inviting your neighbor
[1:43:36] to dinner when you have something your
[1:43:38] table is spread isn't it
[1:43:39] you are sure of yourself that i look at
[1:43:41] her
[1:43:42] so you should first of all be sure is
[1:43:44] that some little oil
[1:43:46] in the house
[1:43:47] we shouldn't be presumptuous sure i mean
[1:43:50] for that reason
[1:43:51] so he says see what god wants
[1:43:54] elijah saw a little cloud
[1:43:57] like a man's hand
[1:44:00] i see a cloud like a manuscript and i
[1:44:02] know it's gonna rain this sound of
[1:44:04] abundance of rain a little cloud
[1:44:07] and that was the omega dynamics rain
[1:44:10] coming
[1:44:14] what am i talking about
[1:44:15] the omega dynamics rain coming
[1:44:21] five-fingered cloud
[1:44:25] talks about the five-fold ministry but
[1:44:27] it also talks about the five
[1:44:29] manifestations of the third pool
[1:44:34] little fish i give you a life that is
[1:44:36] resurrective
[1:44:38] sister had here
[1:44:40] that is redemptive
[1:44:41] storm wind that is authoritative
[1:44:46] speaking the squirrels into existence
[1:44:48] that was creative
[1:44:50] and then speaking the tumor out of his
[1:44:53] wife that was curative
[1:44:56] five fingers i see a cloud
[1:44:59] and he even tells this one he tells the
[1:45:00] nan unbeliever i make believe i say
[1:45:02] prepare her quickly rain is coming
[1:45:05] where are the clouds man
[1:45:10] i've seen a little cloud
[1:45:13] it never came from a big cloud
[1:45:18] to give you confidence canary that this
[1:45:20] big cloud is going to bring a lot of
[1:45:23] rain
[1:45:25] it was a little
[1:45:26] cloud
[1:45:27] like a man's hand
[1:45:34] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:45:36] so what he says he says god
[1:45:39] has got
[1:45:40] to have empty vessels listen we've had
[1:45:43] so much doctrine so much ecclesiastical
[1:45:46] nonsense until we are down at the end of
[1:45:48] the battle
[1:45:49] there's only one thing left turn to god
[1:45:51] and his word that is only one thing left
[1:45:55] did you see what happened recently when
[1:45:57] this
[1:45:58] this pandemic called
[1:46:00] corona came
[1:46:08] you were left with the god
[1:46:12] nurses themselves were scared to death
[1:46:14] doctors were scared
[1:46:20] like i was saying the other day
[1:46:22] you were not even supposed to your wife
[1:46:24] to come to you your children to come to
[1:46:26] you your pastor to come to you everybody
[1:46:28] to come
[1:46:29] cut off
[1:46:31] and you are being treated by people who
[1:46:33] are dressed up to kill
[1:46:36] you don't even look in their faces
[1:46:38] whether they are smiling or grinning
[1:46:43] you were there with only god
[1:46:47] that's where we are now
[1:46:49] we've had a lot of doctrines
[1:46:53] they are taking the church nowhere
[1:46:55] a classical nonsense until we are now
[1:46:58] coming at the end of the battle there's
[1:47:00] only one thing left turn to god and his
[1:47:03] what
[1:47:06] and if you do that get some empty
[1:47:09] vessels
[1:47:11] take out all the methods out of them and
[1:47:13] all a pentecostal out of them and all
[1:47:16] the baptism that is baptist doctrine out
[1:47:18] of them and just let them be vessels and
[1:47:21] set them into up in the house and then
[1:47:24] take this vessel
[1:47:26] he brings this vessel with a capital v
[1:47:30] which is now meaning that the vessel in
[1:47:33] the little woman's home was none other
[1:47:36] but jesus christ himself
[1:47:40] take up
[1:47:42] then take from this vessel and begin to
[1:47:44] power
[1:47:46] a man just to pour
[1:47:48] and he says she had enough to take care
[1:47:50] of her and her kids and everything else
[1:47:53] and pay off all the debts why why
[1:47:56] just what little she had consecrated to
[1:47:59] god and and following the word of this
[1:48:02] prophet
[1:48:03] she came out right
[1:48:05] you know what the devil is doing now
[1:48:09] making people uncomfortable with the
[1:48:11] word of the prophet
[1:48:14] so they don't follow the word
[1:48:17] the word instruction by the prophet
[1:48:20] [Music]
[1:48:21] you will only come out right
[1:48:25] when you follow the word instruction
[1:48:28] by the prophetic message
[1:48:32] and that's why the devil is targeting
[1:48:34] that now
[1:48:36] to destroy it from your life because who
[1:48:39] brought the revelation to solve the
[1:48:41] womanis the church's problem it was a
[1:48:44] prophet

[1:48:47] to what he was in her house
[1:48:50] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:48:53] okay
[1:48:54] he says
[1:48:57] god send us a prophet that he will take
[1:48:59] the word of god that will not take some
[1:49:01] something else but just get empty
[1:49:04] vessels if god can just get empty
[1:49:06] vessels and take then take the word of
[1:49:09] god and pour in into the person
[1:49:13] not like some say oh i shook
[1:49:15] when i received it i spoke in drugs when
[1:49:17] i received i danced to the spirit forget
[1:49:19] it forget it see
[1:49:21] just stay there until it becomes
[1:49:26] that is all
[1:49:27] till the vessels are full that is it
[1:49:30] that's the way you do it yes sir
[1:49:33] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:49:36] now i'm just going to to be very fast
[1:49:39] today i'm not going to take a lot of
[1:49:40] time
[1:49:42] in other words you already have
[1:49:45] you already have
[1:49:47] whatever you will ever need between now
[1:49:51] and eternity
[1:49:56] you already have it
[1:49:57] let me read again this support for you
[1:49:59] if you didn't hear it
[1:50:01] he says here
[1:50:03] he says when you receive the holy ghost
[1:50:05] everything you've got need of between
[1:50:08] here and glory is right in you then
[1:50:13] it ain't faith that you need you've got
[1:50:16] faith
[1:50:17] if you've got the holy spirit
[1:50:20] for he is your faith
[1:50:24] but the thing you have to know
[1:50:27] is
[1:50:27] how to use that face see what i mean and
[1:50:31] if you just understand how to use it
[1:50:33] which we will try
[1:50:35] come this coming week to explain it
[1:50:37] that's the prophet saying
[1:50:39] just to see how to use the faith
[1:50:45] taking the prophetic instruction
[1:50:48] will pull you out
[1:50:50] through any problem
[1:50:52] we don't need any other remedy
[1:50:55] but the remedy that you need is already
[1:50:57] in you can you relax
[1:51:01] can you take your rest
[1:51:03] because it's resting
[1:51:06] like we were saying yesterday
[1:51:08] the daughters of jerusalem you tell them
[1:51:12] let him rest
[1:51:14] i'm not in a hurry
[1:51:16] i'm not going to allow the demon of
[1:51:17] anxiety they cover me
[1:51:21] i'm going to be still because i'm
[1:51:24] listening to this still small
[1:51:26] voice
[1:51:28] and a still small voice
[1:51:31] will unravel every mystery that i need
[1:51:33] anytime
[1:51:35] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:51:38] so
[1:51:39] he that hath but overlooked it will lose
[1:51:43] it
[1:51:44] to the one who values
[1:51:46] it moses what is that in your hand
[1:51:50] a stick
[1:51:52] throw it down
[1:51:53] let me give you an example
[1:51:56] one time i think around in matthew and
[1:51:58] mark also even look they talk about that
[1:52:01] story
[1:52:04] whereby
[1:52:07] i don't know whether you can get that
[1:52:09] verse
[1:52:10] but
[1:52:12] it is somewhere here
[1:52:14] if you come
[1:52:16] in the book of
[1:52:18] i think matthew
[1:52:21] chapter 15 let me read it because i have
[1:52:23] some time here matthew chapter 15
[1:52:28] sorry chapter 14 from verse 15. sorry it
[1:52:31] is matthew chapter 14.
[1:52:33] matthew chapter 14 from verse 15.
[1:52:38] and when it was evening his disciples
[1:52:40] came to him saying this is a desert
[1:52:42] place
[1:52:43] and the time is now passed send them out
[1:52:45] away and they may go into the villages
[1:52:47] and buy themselves victors
[1:52:51] this was a
[1:52:52] reasoning out of common sense isn't it
[1:52:55] disciples were spot on master it is
[1:52:59] evening time
[1:53:00] and this is a desert place you know it
[1:53:02] there's no water there's no lodging
[1:53:04] there's no food there's nothing
[1:53:06] so send them out to the way that they
[1:53:08] may go into the villages and buy
[1:53:09] themselves food
[1:53:12] and verse 16 what does jesus say
[1:53:15] jesus said unto them
[1:53:16] they need not depart
[1:53:20] give them to it
[1:53:25] you give them
[1:53:27] you have what it takes to feed them
[1:53:33] they don't need to go
[1:53:38] you
[1:53:38] have the solution
[1:53:40] and they looked i think
[1:53:42] at one another like wondering
[1:53:45] we
[1:53:46] give them to it
[1:53:50] past god me i'm a weakling i'm limited

[1:54:17] man yes i'm the one who has told you
[1:54:19] have i not sent you have i not told you
[1:54:22] that is the horror thing
[1:54:26] jesus is telling you
[1:54:28] you give them
[1:54:30] jesus
[1:54:31] the prophet is telling that woman borrow
[1:54:33] even the neighbors whatever
[1:54:35] versus you don't have even enough
[1:54:38] problems to deal with
[1:54:40] to deal with what is in you
[1:54:42] you don't even have enough space
[1:54:47] do you know that even he promised that
[1:54:49] when we pay our tithes when we pay our
[1:54:51] tithes and offerings
[1:54:54] what did he say
[1:54:56] he said
[1:54:57] that i'll even bless you and you lack a
[1:54:59] space
[1:55:02] yes
[1:55:03] he said son
[1:55:08] sorry he's telling the disciples
[1:55:10] they don't need to go you give them
[1:55:12] something to eat
[1:55:15] now listen and they say that to him
[1:55:17] we have here but five loaves and two
[1:55:20] fishes
[1:55:22] come on master
[1:55:24] you are not understanding
[1:55:27] properly
[1:55:28] our problem
[1:55:32] we have so little
[1:55:36] these are thousands of people if there
[1:55:38] are five thousand men what about women
[1:55:40] and children
[1:55:42] perhaps over fifteen thousand put
[1:55:44] together
[1:55:45] now we have only five
[1:55:47] pieces of bread
[1:55:49] and two little
[1:55:52] two fishes
[1:55:55] please understand
[1:55:58] us that's how sometimes we say lord
[1:56:03] i am not able lord
[1:56:06] you are giving me a task that i cannot
[1:56:08] handle
[1:56:17] and we want it you know always solved
[1:56:20] that's why she went to the prophet she
[1:56:21] wants someone to solve it
[1:56:27] that's why so many people have always
[1:56:28] asked me brother abraham you have a gift
[1:56:30] why don't you point people to yourself
[1:56:32] and and tell them you are a prophet you
[1:56:34] i said have you ever heard me say i'm a
[1:56:36] prophet
[1:56:38] i'm not a prophet
[1:56:39] i will never ever put myself as a solve
[1:56:43] of people's problems
[1:56:45] i can't
[1:56:47] i can't even solve the problem problem
[1:56:49] of me
[1:56:54] i can't solve my own problems
[1:56:57] why should i put another person to think
[1:57:00] i can solve
[1:57:04] that would be terrible
[1:57:06] and that's why these men with a little
[1:57:08] gift rising up and then they try to show
[1:57:10] as if they are powerful man look to me
[1:57:12] everybody look to me everybody look to
[1:57:14] me look to you and you can die tomorrow
[1:57:23] i don't point you to if i ever point you
[1:57:26] to myself then i will point you to that
[1:57:27] which is in me
[1:57:29] amen not me
[1:57:33] and then i'll tell you that which is in
[1:57:35] me can also be in you can be powered
[1:57:39] into your empty vessel
[1:57:43] so
[1:57:44] jesus
[1:57:46] is bringing the disciples to say you
[1:57:48] know
[1:57:49] we just have
[1:57:51] five loaves
[1:57:53] and two fishes
[1:58:00] and what does he say
[1:58:02] bring them here to me
[1:58:04] jesus did not ever say
[1:58:08] he is
[1:58:09] oh our treasurer judas can you give us
[1:58:11] some more
[1:58:12] shekels
[1:58:14] we go and buy some more
[1:58:16] oh bring here the man i multiply the man
[1:58:18] and you go and dive more food no
[1:58:21] bring that which you already have here
[1:58:28] that which you already have with you
[1:58:32] by default as i speak
[1:58:37] is what is going to feed these thousands
[1:58:39] of people
[1:58:42] so it will actually be you who would
[1:58:44] have given them the what the food
[1:58:47] because my work is i'm going to just
[1:58:49] multiply
[1:58:52] what you have
[1:58:55] i'm not going to give them you are the
[1:58:57] ones who is giving them me i'm just
[1:58:59] multiplying like you know the prophetic
[1:59:02] message to the church to that widow
[1:59:05] didn't create the oil it only multiplied
[1:59:08] the oil
[1:59:15] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:59:18] so this is where we are now friends
[1:59:22] you have in your house
[1:59:26] you have brought into your mother's
[1:59:28] house
[1:59:29] that bridegroom that pot of oil
[1:59:32] that can solve all your problems he's
[1:59:35] right in you
[1:59:37] and you don't have to look elsewhere
[1:59:43] you don't have to look elsewhere you
[1:59:46] are
[1:59:46] that bright
[1:59:48] just convince yourself that i am that
[1:59:51] bright
[1:59:52] start preaching to yourself now
[1:59:55] i am that bride
[1:59:57] i am that word bride i am that
[1:59:59] tabernacle
[2:00:01] that vessel that temple that body
[2:00:06] of him
[2:00:09] and no matter how little it appears like
[2:00:12] i mean let me tell you it is actually
[2:00:14] not the that jesus who is in his little
[2:00:17] it is you are thinking and feeling
[2:00:19] attitude about him that makes him appear
[2:00:22] like he's little
[2:00:26] but let there become a right atmosphere
[2:00:30] a right attitude a right thought
[2:00:34] a right face
[2:00:36] and you see him running emotion
[2:00:38] you'll see him begin to go into action
[2:00:42] blessed be the name of the lord this is
[2:00:44] the jesus i'm talking about
[2:00:46] and i've seen him many times
[2:00:49] sometimes in the weakest of the moments
[2:00:52] sometimes when i'm sick myself weak
[2:00:55] myself and you pray for someone and
[2:00:57] someone is instantly healed and you
[2:00:58] wonder i was thinking i was i'm very
[2:01:00] weak i was thinking i'm very sick why am
[2:01:03] i why is this person getting because
[2:01:05] greta is he that is in you but these
[2:01:08] sicknesses sometimes just come as trials
[2:01:11] every child of god has to be tested so
[2:01:14] when you are tested there is no evidence
[2:01:16] that he has left you
[2:01:19] when you are going through a trial that
[2:01:20] is not proof that you are now
[2:01:22] backslidden
[2:01:23] there is no proof that god has left you
[2:01:26] that is no proof that he has become a
[2:01:28] little
[2:01:29] so small no
[2:01:31] the bible says greater
[2:01:33] is he that is in you then he that is the
[2:01:36] whole world put together he that is
[2:01:40] greater than
[2:01:42] all the atomic bombs the nuclear bombs
[2:01:44] and so forth these ones that they are
[2:01:46] scaring one another with
[2:01:48] russia is speaking america speaking
[2:01:50] britain is speaking nuclear new korean
[2:01:52] nuclear we have something more powerful
[2:01:55] than ukraine
[2:01:59] can a nuclear create anything
[2:02:01] can you create a bomb just destroys so
[2:02:04] which is easier it is more easier to
[2:02:06] destroy than to do something to create
[2:02:09] something is always more hard
[2:02:11] but to destroy it even this house if you
[2:02:13] want to dis demolish it in a matter of
[2:02:16] 30 minutes if
[2:02:17] you bring here
[2:02:20] what what is that machine they call it
[2:02:21] what it will just roll it down
[2:02:24] but to build it you can't build it in
[2:02:26] one hour
[2:02:29] so the devil is a destroyer
[2:02:34] but for us ours is a creator
[2:02:37] he builds
[2:02:40] glory to god
[2:02:42] so greater is he that is so here he says
[2:02:45] bring here to me what you have
[2:02:48] and he commanded the maori to sit down
[2:02:50] on the grass
[2:02:52] and he took the five loaves and the two
[2:02:54] fishes and looking up to heaven and
[2:02:57] blessed and broke and gave the loves to
[2:02:59] his disciples and the disciples to the
[2:03:01] multitude and they did all it
[2:03:05] all and they were filled and they took
[2:03:08] up the fragments and remained in 12
[2:03:10] baskets now the fragments were more than
[2:03:14] what the original fish and bread was
[2:03:20] five thousand men with the women whom we
[2:03:23] don't know the number the children have
[2:03:25] eaten and now they have gathered
[2:03:26] fragments
[2:03:28] you know 12 baskets
[2:03:31] come on the original pieces of bread and
[2:03:35] fish could not even fill one basket but
[2:03:37] now the remainder is 12 baskets because
[2:03:40] he's giving the twelve tribes of israel
[2:03:42] a testimony he's also giving the twelve
[2:03:44] disciples a testimony and the next
[2:03:46] miracle he feeds seven thousand and what
[2:03:50] happens i mean four thousand out of
[2:03:52] seven pieces of bread what happens
[2:03:55] they pick seven baskets
[2:03:57] which is a type of a testimony for the
[2:03:59] seven church ages
[2:04:05] and eventually all that you see you get
[2:04:08] seven plus five those are twelve pieces
[2:04:09] of bread and that represented the number
[2:04:11] of the disciples
[2:04:13] each one and then the last time when
[2:04:15] jesus warns them about the living of the
[2:04:18] pharisees they just remember that they
[2:04:20] have one bread
[2:04:22] from
[2:04:23] five
[2:04:24] to seven to one
[2:04:27] so jesus himself becomes the bread of
[2:04:29] life
[2:04:30] so it's no longer seven it's no longer
[2:04:32] five this one in the boat
[2:04:36] blessed be the name of the lord so what
[2:04:38] are we looking at here he picks what
[2:04:41] they had
[2:04:44] not buying one extra
[2:04:47] that which you already have
[2:04:49] and what is god going to use to shake
[2:04:51] this community
[2:04:52] what is god god to use to heal your
[2:04:55] neighbors to open your neighbors their
[2:04:58] eyes to save them to deliver them
[2:05:02] that week is in your house
[2:05:06] that is which is already in your house
[2:05:09] that man that you brought from the
[2:05:11] wilderness
[2:05:13] [Laughter]
[2:05:15] it's just he's just wait you know that
[2:05:18] little woman she now came to a point
[2:05:20] that her mind stopped
[2:05:23] she could no longer think normally
[2:05:25] because
[2:05:26] she has to build believe that i have to
[2:05:29] borrow the
[2:05:30] vessels
[2:05:31] and she went around borrowing vessels
[2:05:33] borrowing borrowing borrowing borrowing
[2:05:35] borrowing borrowing and filled the house
[2:05:37] until there was no space
[2:05:40] and then
[2:05:41] that is point number one step number one
[2:05:43] taken step number two i was supposed to
[2:05:47] shut the door okay now it's not supposed
[2:05:50] to be a public show off come and see me
[2:05:53] i am the man of the hour i am the woman
[2:05:55] of the hour i have got faith you see
[2:05:58] there's going to be a miracle here today
[2:06:01] no
[2:06:02] okay shut your doors
[2:06:05] with you and your children no man no
[2:06:07] show off
[2:06:11] he's going to do it and then what
[2:06:13] happens
[2:06:15] she starts i think she must have closed
[2:06:17] their eyes and she held the pot and she
[2:06:20] was pouring
[2:06:22] a little pot pouring
[2:06:25] into the big one
[2:06:28] this is a vessel this is a little boat
[2:06:30] and then she's pouring and the children
[2:06:33] must have rubbed their eyes
[2:06:36] and then it goes
[2:06:37] [Laughter]
[2:06:41] it's full
[2:06:42] take it bring another one and it goes
[2:06:50] mama what is
[2:06:56] happening the children
[2:06:59] when they realize
[2:07:01] what their mother's faith is doing
[2:07:05] the faith in the prophetic message
[2:07:08] they will be converted because they they
[2:07:11] were redeemed from the they were already
[2:07:14] taken but now they are being redeemed by
[2:07:17] the faith
[2:07:19] of the mother amen
[2:07:22] the faith of the mother standing with
[2:07:24] the word of the prophet he's redeeming
[2:07:26] her children back
[2:07:28] like you see sister hattie she had
[2:07:30] nothing you remember sister
[2:07:32] she was so poor she was washing i mean
[2:07:35] for people
[2:07:36] you know cleaning homes and so forth
[2:07:38] like the prophecy until the prophet
[2:07:40] didn't even want to take her offering
[2:07:42] when he was taking offerings and
[2:07:43] conditioning for the church
[2:07:45] and then he wanted to take back the
[2:07:47] money discretely and god rebuked him
[2:07:50] said she is not doing that for you it's
[2:07:53] me she has got a reward waiting for her
[2:07:57] at the end of the day
[2:07:58] what was the reward the redemption of
[2:08:01] her sons
[2:08:03] so poor so limited maybe a widow another
[2:08:07] one
[2:08:10] with the two rowdy renegades
[2:08:14] in the form of sons
[2:08:16] taken already they are already taken by
[2:08:19] the dead
[2:08:22] are already bonus men
[2:08:25] of the devil and the devil said ah you
[2:08:27] came to serve god to serve god to you
[2:08:30] you are a dedicated believer you believe
[2:08:31] the message of the prophet why doesn't
[2:08:34] the prophet pray for your children to be
[2:08:36] saved i think she had prayed and prayed
[2:08:39] and prayed
[2:08:42] but all she had to do is say the right
[2:08:46] word
[2:08:49] and then she enters into the same
[2:08:52] anointing speak the word
[2:08:55] speak the word
[2:08:57] not go and fast
[2:09:00] go and bring all the man in your drawer
[2:09:04] go and join this church go and do this
[2:09:06] speak the word here it is going to be
[2:09:09] done spoken what is the original seed
[2:09:12] and it's going to be the final seed
[2:09:14] manifested now what happens
[2:09:16] she says lo brother branham
[2:09:19] they desire she was now a believer
[2:09:22] speaking with a prophet
[2:09:24] the the first desire of my heart is the
[2:09:26] salvation of my children
[2:09:29] and they were they were given blessed be
[2:09:32] the name of the lord
[2:09:33] she was limited
[2:09:35] she couldn't even train them she
[2:09:37] couldn't even spank them she couldn't do
[2:09:40] nothing
[2:09:41] it was beyond her like the other widow
[2:09:44] in the bible it was beyond her
[2:09:47] and maybe today you are in a situation
[2:09:48] that apparently is beyond you
[2:09:52] your husband his condition is beyond you
[2:09:54] your wife his condition is beyond you
[2:09:57] your parents condition is beyond you
[2:10:01] your sister your brother your children
[2:10:04] are beyond you you they can't listen
[2:10:06] they have gone beyond
[2:10:09] but you have a relationship with a
[2:10:10] prophetic message
[2:10:13] the little oil is there
[2:10:16] glory be to god
[2:10:18] your faith in the word will bring a
[2:10:20] difference and i'm not going to argue
[2:10:23] with the dev over that
[2:10:25] i think i remember one day i was praying
[2:10:27] for someone and then when i prayed and
[2:10:30] she says i'm not going i've refused to i
[2:10:33] said god never commanded me to go into
[2:10:36] the world
[2:10:37] and argue with the demons
[2:10:42] like
[2:10:43] you know what do you want like spend the
[2:10:44] cost to say what is your name what do
[2:10:46] you want what do you want what i said
[2:10:49] i don't even speak with davos
[2:10:53] i i just said one thing devil i know one
[2:10:55] thing
[2:10:56] that first of all you are a liar
[2:10:59] so you are telling me lies that you are
[2:11:01] going nowhere when you have already gone
[2:11:03] you have no ground to stand here
[2:11:06] two i cannot ask you what you want
[2:11:08] because you were saying tell let me tell
[2:11:10] you what i want i said stop
[2:11:12] i don't want to ask to hear even what
[2:11:14] you want
[2:11:16] jesus already paid
[2:11:18] the price
[2:11:20] and that was the end of the problem that
[2:11:22] that woman was healed
[2:11:24] i prayed for another one reason i think
[2:11:26] three months ago a crazy woman you know
[2:11:28] and and the demons
[2:11:30] you know they they managed to bring her
[2:11:32] but her father was also running mad and
[2:11:34] and then the demon says we are killing
[2:11:36] both of them
[2:11:38] so when they brought her it was a
[2:11:39] wednesday i just came and
[2:11:41] i prayed for her and then she said today
[2:11:43] we are going to kill
[2:11:45] today we are going to kill her i said me
[2:11:47] have already prayed
[2:11:49] and therefore you have no power to kill
[2:11:52] her
[2:11:53] and i have no time to argue
[2:11:56] neither do i even have time to pray for
[2:11:58] her again
[2:12:00] i've prayed
[2:12:02] it's enough
[2:12:03] i can't make myself repetitive just
[2:12:06] because the devil is saying enco
[2:12:09] anco
[2:12:11] anco so that i keep repeating after what
[2:12:15] the devil wants me to repeat no
[2:12:19] and that was the end the devil killed
[2:12:20] the father of the girl
[2:12:22] the man died
[2:12:24] because he was not here he was not a
[2:12:26] believer but i prayed for this one and
[2:12:28] she was she's still not in the church
[2:12:30] she's normal so what am i saying
[2:12:32] there's some situations that you feel
[2:12:34] like i have prayed but i think it's not
[2:12:36] enough i don't have enough faith i don't
[2:12:38] have enough this i think i'm not a real
[2:12:40] good believer you are just hearing
[2:12:42] voices from your own realm you have your
[2:12:45] mind and faith is a super sense
[2:12:50] super sense of the super rest by the
[2:12:52] super seed
[2:12:56] so you got beyond the five senses you
[2:12:58] got the sixth sense which is super super
[2:13:01] sense faith and when that one speaks
[2:13:04] everything else keeps quiet
[2:13:07] and you have to tell even yourself
[2:13:10] it's already done
[2:13:12] take your hands from me take your mind
[2:13:14] from it
[2:13:16] you have nothing to do with it you
[2:13:18] already committed it to the one who to
[2:13:20] handle it
[2:13:22] you have nothing whether it takes a day
[2:13:24] or two days or five days just leave it
[2:13:27] it's done
[2:13:28] that's faith
[2:13:32] blessed be the name of the lord so shut
[2:13:34] the door
[2:13:36] until it's done
[2:13:38] and then the next thing will be a
[2:13:40] testimony who gave the testimony not the
[2:13:44] woman not the children
[2:13:47] the one whose debt was paid
[2:13:52] the one whose debt was paid
[2:13:55] he's the one who gave the testimony the
[2:13:57] testimony was i wonder how that old weak
[2:14:02] poor limited
[2:14:04] widow
[2:14:05] managed to get the money to pay me
[2:14:10] i went there
[2:14:12] to grab her children
[2:14:15] but he says look here's your cheque
[2:14:24] check
[2:14:25] okay if you don't want to check here's
[2:14:26] cash
[2:14:28] if you think i'm giving you a bouncing
[2:14:31] check
[2:14:31] take the cash
[2:14:38] what is happening
[2:14:41] am i seeing stars am i seeing reality
[2:14:44] this widow
[2:14:45] is paying all the that that was that she
[2:14:49] had as a dead plus all the interests
[2:14:51] everything is there
[2:14:54] where did she get the solution from
[2:14:59] who
[2:15:02] which man
[2:15:03] can you tell me neighbors
[2:15:06] has she brought here certainly man is
[2:15:08] there a man a tycoon that he has already
[2:15:10] what who is staying here
[2:15:14] [Laughter]
[2:15:16] some business mogul
[2:15:19] came here and he's giving her the
[2:15:21] dollars
[2:15:22] no
[2:15:25] she has never had that
[2:15:26] we have never seen anything but there's
[2:15:29] only one thing for sure that we are
[2:15:30] wondering
[2:15:32] she borrowed our empty vessels
[2:15:37] she bought all the empty vessels
[2:15:42] and we saw her selling some of the
[2:15:44] things
[2:15:45] she called the dealers of oil
[2:15:48] and they came here and they were buying
[2:15:50] oil
[2:15:52] the only thing is we don't know where
[2:15:53] the oil comes from
[2:15:55] but she saw the oil in the plenty
[2:16:03] where did the oil come from
[2:16:05] from the house
[2:16:08] was it already there no she borrowed our
[2:16:12] vessels it is the vessels that were
[2:16:13] carrying the oil but where did the oil
[2:16:15] come from we don't know
[2:16:22] oh
[2:16:23] glory be to god
[2:16:25] the oil came
[2:16:27] it was something that god had put in
[2:16:29] this widow's room house to solve our
[2:16:33] problems so friend aren't we happy
[2:16:36] aren't we a blessed people to see that
[2:16:39] in our houses there is a little port of
[2:16:41] oil
[2:16:44] you've brought him to your mother's
[2:16:47] house he's there
[2:16:49] he's the pot of oil and he's the one
[2:16:51] that will solve all your problems
[2:16:54] all
[2:16:56] spiritual mental psychological financial
[2:17:00] physical
[2:17:02] all social problems
[2:17:04] all demons or spirits
[2:17:06] he is the one he's the elsa died
[2:17:11] he's the one that can take care of all
[2:17:13] of them
[2:17:16] glory be to god
[2:17:18] this is the god i'm serving i don't know
[2:17:20] about you but as the god that i'm
[2:17:22] talking about blessed be the name of the
[2:17:25] lord
[2:17:26] and that's why i was saying yesterday
[2:17:28] those men said we have found him
[2:17:32] we have phoned him him of
[2:17:34] of whom spoke all the prophets and the
[2:17:36] law and all referred to him for us we
[2:17:39] have found him
[2:17:40] and when they phoned him what did they
[2:17:43] say you remember the disciples that came
[2:17:44] from john he said master where do you
[2:17:46] dwell
[2:17:48] we want to go to your home
[2:17:51] we want to go home we want to go into
[2:17:54] heavenly places to be together with you
[2:17:57] to have more fellowship with you and
[2:17:59] jesus took them to where he dwells
[2:18:02] the two disciples who broke away from
[2:18:05] john the baptist when he introduced
[2:18:06] reality to them
[2:18:08] so today when we saw we have phoned him
[2:18:11] where is he we didn't leave him in the
[2:18:13] streets we didn't leave him in the
[2:18:14] wilderness he came and we were ready to
[2:18:17] die with him you know so that he leaves
[2:18:21] like paul says in the garage galatians
[2:18:23] 20 i'm crucified i'm i'm dead but i'm
[2:18:25] not the one living it's christ living in
[2:18:27] me although i'm living it's not me
[2:18:29] living it's christ living in me
[2:18:31] blessed be the name of that soul that's
[2:18:33] why in the seals he says don't hurt the
[2:18:37] little oil
[2:18:39] and wine
[2:18:43] that little oil
[2:18:46] don't hurt it
[2:18:48] don't frustrate it
[2:18:50] don't impede it don't limit it
[2:18:54] don't bog it down its capabilities
[2:18:58] let it do its work
[2:19:00] don't deny it a chance to solve your
[2:19:03] problems
[2:19:04] don't overlook it to go for another
[2:19:07] solution elsewhere when you have that
[2:19:09] little oil there
[2:19:11] don't hurt it because when you hurt it
[2:19:14] what happens when you hurt the holy
[2:19:15] ghost the dove he flies away
[2:19:19] he goes back to the wilderness
[2:19:25] the only way you can avoid hurting him
[2:19:27] is when you are feeling his emotions and
[2:19:29] so forth dies and that means you have to
[2:19:31] die that's why he came with the
[2:19:32] anointing
[2:19:33] of francis and mark an anointing for the
[2:19:36] dead
[2:19:37] because this time he gets married to
[2:19:39] someone who is dying who is dead
[2:19:42] then you are remaining a dead one as he
[2:19:44] lives in you
[2:19:47] so he takes care of you who takes care
[2:19:50] of a dead body it's not anybody taking
[2:19:51] care about itself
[2:19:54] [Laughter]
[2:19:57] glory be to god
[2:19:59] okay okay let me finish
[2:20:07] let me come to this
[2:20:15] the prophet says so when the devil was
[2:20:17] gone from the boy the disciple says why
[2:20:19] couldn't we do it
[2:20:22] jesus said because of your animal
[2:20:27] not lack of power
[2:20:33] excuse me
[2:20:34] not lack of
[2:20:36] power
[2:20:38] the church
[2:20:39] has got
[2:20:40] power enough tonight right in this here
[2:20:44] in this group of people to do anything
[2:20:48] can you say amen to that
[2:20:50] oh are you sleeping
[2:20:53] somebody help me say amen to that
[2:20:58] the church
[2:21:00] has
[2:21:01] power enough
[2:21:03] tonight not tomorrow not after fasting
[2:21:06] not after you know you know doing this
[2:21:08] doing that
[2:21:11] tonight
[2:21:14] right here in here this group of people
[2:21:16] to do anything
[2:21:18] but you haven't got faith enough to do
[2:21:21] it
[2:21:24] listen
[2:21:25] you have faith enough to walk sir he now
[2:21:28] points to his other man
[2:21:32] now can you imagine you have enough
[2:21:35] faith if you are learned to walk
[2:21:37] you have enough faith if you have cancer
[2:21:40] here to be healed you have enough faith
[2:21:43] but the only thing is to
[2:21:46] you know remove the lead of it
[2:21:49] pop it off
[2:21:50] and let the faith flow freely
[2:21:54] you are restraining it
[2:21:57] you are controlling faith you don't want
[2:21:59] faith to exercise
[2:22:02] its ability
[2:22:07] so he says you've got you have faith
[2:22:09] enough to walk sir
[2:22:11] you have power enough
[2:22:14] if you have faith you've got power
[2:22:16] enough too ready you who is seated in
[2:22:19] the court
[2:22:20] if you would believe but that's up to
[2:22:22] you
[2:22:25] so we see where the prophet leaves you
[2:22:28] up to you
[2:22:30] that little pot of oil in your house is
[2:22:32] all able to solve all your problems but
[2:22:34] it's up to you
[2:22:37] i'm not going to do it for you
[2:22:40] it is a diy
[2:22:45] [Music]
[2:22:47] do it yourself
[2:22:52] it's up to you
[2:22:55] rather if you want to remain sick until
[2:22:56] jesus takes you home it is up to you
[2:23:01] if you want that cancer to eat you up
[2:23:03] until you go and die with it no problem
[2:23:07] what will i do
[2:23:10] jesus always asked do you believe
[2:23:13] do you believe that i can do this do you
[2:23:15] believe this can be done do you believe
[2:23:17] that you can i can make you have it
[2:23:19] according let's be a according to you uh
[2:23:25] so he says
[2:23:26] you have power enough lady
[2:23:28] two in the court if you would believe
[2:23:31] but it's up to you see they finish the
[2:23:34] work i couldn't do nothing
[2:23:37] and in other words i am here i'm the
[2:23:39] prophet you are they need a person you
[2:23:41] have debts you have problems you have
[2:23:42] issues
[2:23:44] i wish i could help you i wish i could
[2:23:45] do i could do something for but i can't
[2:23:49] and that's the problem of us preachers
[2:23:51] you are a pastor you are looking at a
[2:23:53] sheep it is suffering she's in trouble
[2:23:55] he's in trouble you he's sick he's but
[2:23:58] you cannot believe for him
[2:24:01] you cannot exercise that faith for him
[2:24:03] he has to do it because he's here as a
[2:24:05] believer and let me tell you it's much
[2:24:08] more easier for me to pray for a
[2:24:10] non-believer and he gets healed and pray
[2:24:12] for a believer
[2:24:14] sorry is much easier
[2:24:16] because my faith god will just honor it
[2:24:19] straight and heals that person that
[2:24:21] personally cannot believe but for you
[2:24:23] it's not a miracle for you it's divine
[2:24:26] healing
[2:24:27] you have to exercise your own faith i
[2:24:30] cannot do religion for you
[2:24:32] and i cannot even pray for you no this
[2:24:35] is what is going on in the world today
[2:24:37] we want a church where they do
[2:24:39] everything for us
[2:24:41] they sing for us
[2:24:43] they clap for us while we are there just
[2:24:45] soothing our thighs
[2:24:49] while let others clap me i'm just
[2:24:54] others let them lift their hands up and
[2:24:56] worship the lord for me me i will never
[2:24:58] lift up my hands
[2:24:59] let others pray
[2:25:01] and you know you come to church and you
[2:25:03] go back home you have not said the word
[2:25:05] to god
[2:25:07] what did you come to do
[2:25:09] just to hear god speak did you speak
[2:25:11] back
[2:25:12] is that a communion communion is when
[2:25:15] the two commune
[2:25:17] what have you done you came to church
[2:25:18] god spoke did you answer back did you
[2:25:21] pray nothing
[2:25:25] we are in a religion where they want
[2:25:27] like back to catholicism you know they
[2:25:30] pray for you mary mother god of mother
[2:25:33] of god pray for us sinners joseph pray
[2:25:35] for us sinners so and so pray for us
[2:25:38] sinners
[2:25:40] so you don't pray they pray for you
[2:25:44] that's the problem if i was to even tell
[2:25:46] you now after this service let everyone
[2:25:48] talk to god not even two minutes
[2:25:50] everybody will be quiet they want the
[2:25:52] pastor to come and pray for them
[2:25:55] something's wrong
[2:25:58] why are you fearing to talk to your god
[2:26:01] who will pray for you
[2:26:02] why don't you pray why can't you even
[2:26:05] pray to god five minutes
[2:26:08] he is your god he is not just my god for
[2:26:11] you
[2:26:12] i mean i'm not a booster that you
[2:26:14] connect god through
[2:26:18] you have to have a connection direct
[2:26:21] because you are the bride
[2:26:23] which bride hires another person to
[2:26:25] speak for on her behalf to her husband
[2:26:28] which one
[2:26:32] hey i see you sitting with your husbands
[2:26:34] next i see
[2:26:36] very close okay if you want to speak to
[2:26:38] him you hire somebody no
[2:26:43] somebody come and speak for me to my
[2:26:45] husband
[2:26:48] i'm gonna come and tell him i need this
[2:26:50] i need to eat a candy i want who hires
[2:26:56] and if jesus is your husband is your
[2:26:58] bridegroom you come to church and what
[2:27:01] it is my house shall be called the house
[2:27:04] of prayer did you come in this house and
[2:27:07] pray
[2:27:15] can you deal with that question today
[2:27:17] you came to this house did you pray
[2:27:21] oh they prayed for you
[2:27:24] they prayed the opening prayer they
[2:27:26] prayed for prayer requests they prayed
[2:27:28] before they preached they prayed after
[2:27:31] preaching
[2:27:32] and then
[2:27:33] did you pray
[2:27:37] oh brother yesterday excuse me i'm not
[2:27:39] teaching here church order
[2:27:43] i hope i'm not breaking order here
[2:27:46] but i'm just simply reminding
[2:27:48] ourselves
[2:27:50] what did jesus say my house shall be
[2:27:52] called of all nations the house of
[2:27:55] prayer so who prays
[2:28:00] only pastors only song leaders
[2:28:04] oh you pray and when did you pray
[2:28:08] oh i am going to judge to pray okay have
[2:28:11] you prayed
[2:28:15] so
[2:28:16] no one is going to do a religion for you
[2:28:21] amen
[2:28:22] if you want everything to be done for
[2:28:25] you
[2:28:28] then you are denying him
[2:28:31] he is not yours
[2:28:36] so how do you now relate with him when
[2:28:38] there is a meeting
[2:28:40] that's why you are in frantic search for
[2:28:42] somebody somebody somebody can't handle
[2:28:44] the situation somebody they
[2:28:46] have tried the pastor's numbers off i've
[2:28:48] tried brothers and so i've tried my
[2:28:50] husband's name
[2:28:52] why are you frantic
[2:28:58] why don't you have a direct connection
[2:29:01] to your savior
[2:29:03] to your god
[2:29:05] god doesn't have grandchildren at least
[2:29:07] brother branham told us that
[2:29:10] he has children
[2:29:13] who prays for you
[2:29:15] who should
[2:29:17] and what should you do
[2:29:20] that's why the prophet is he's putting a
[2:29:22] disclaimer
[2:29:25] he's saying
[2:29:27] you have enough faith
[2:29:29] you have got the word you believed the
[2:29:31] word your god is children you are here
[2:29:34] but if you have trouble
[2:29:38] it's up to you
[2:29:42] what to do about that
[2:29:45] even if you came here the lady has hands
[2:29:47] upon you but if your faith is not
[2:29:49] activated to receive it it's actually
[2:29:52] you to move the gift not the gift to
[2:29:54] move you
[2:29:58] that's what the prophet said
[2:30:00] uh-huh so that's why i told you it's
[2:30:02] much more more easier for me i've prayed
[2:30:05] for thousands of people but it's always
[2:30:07] much easier for me to pray for an
[2:30:09] unbeliever
[2:30:11] and they get their instant healing
[2:30:13] but it's always very hard when you're
[2:30:15] dealing with a believer
[2:30:17] because they know the word
[2:30:21] and if they have issues in their lives
[2:30:23] that they were supposed to put it right
[2:30:24] and they have not put it right
[2:30:27] it's a problem
[2:30:29] if they come to be prayed for as a
[2:30:31] second option but
[2:30:34] reluctantly it's not something that they
[2:30:36] are desperate that god should intervene
[2:30:39] then god will also take them in the same
[2:30:42] angle
[2:30:43] they have come but god is not the first
[2:30:45] option it's a reluctant going to be
[2:30:48] prayed for
[2:30:50] but i have my good doctor
[2:30:53] no problem have you a good doctor
[2:30:58] until the day when your doctor says it's
[2:31:00] beyond me now
[2:31:04] now what will you do then
[2:31:11] brother maher abraham i think you are
[2:31:13] becoming too tough
[2:31:16] well if you are tough you get going
[2:31:20] we shall keep going together with you
[2:31:23] it's not a mistake i'm just simply you
[2:31:25] know paraphrasing on what a prophet is
[2:31:27] saying
[2:31:29] he says
[2:31:30] it's up to you
[2:31:32] see because it's a finished work i
[2:31:34] couldn't do nothing now listen to this
[2:31:37] statement if christ was standing right
[2:31:40] here
[2:31:42] with his suit on
[2:31:45] if jesus was to be here with his suit
[2:31:47] all he couldn't do nothing for you
[2:31:51] think about it
[2:31:53] he could not do anything better than
[2:31:56] brother just on what he's doing now and
[2:31:58] what i'm doing now
[2:32:00] he can't do anything for you
[2:32:02] because
[2:32:03] he has already done it
[2:32:06] he's already finished his calvary so it
[2:32:09] is you to activate it it's you to borrow
[2:32:13] the empty vessels it is you to take the
[2:32:16] effort to pour the oil into the empty
[2:32:18] vessels it is you
[2:32:20] to go back and say now i have oil field
[2:32:23] everywhere what do i do go and sell and
[2:32:26] it's you to look for the market to sell
[2:32:29] the oil it's to you to get a man and
[2:32:31] take it back and pay
[2:32:35] not a profit
[2:32:37] not a god
[2:32:39] you
[2:32:41] aha
[2:32:47] some good food for thought isn't it
[2:32:52] he says what we need today
[2:32:54] is not to pray for more power you got
[2:32:57] enough power to make a new earth
[2:32:59] eh
[2:33:01] i need more power brother more anointing
[2:33:04] i needed this i needed this you don't
[2:33:06] need to pray for my power
[2:33:12] we you got enough power to make a new
[2:33:15] earth
[2:33:17] to create another one
[2:33:19] even if you had
[2:33:20] a trillions of goddess power in you
[2:33:27] what you need is the faith to use that
[2:33:30] power what you need
[2:33:32] is control that life
[2:33:36] control that life with life the life of
[2:33:39] the world control that life and live
[2:33:41] such a godly life
[2:33:44] live such a godly life so that when you
[2:33:47] ask god anything
[2:33:50] when you ask god anything
[2:33:53] you know
[2:33:55] he's going to do it unite
[2:33:58] because you live such a godly life you
[2:34:02] are like god to be godless to be like a
[2:34:04] god and how do you live like god living
[2:34:07] the life of the word of god
[2:34:10] when you live the life of the world
[2:34:12] because god is the word then you are
[2:34:14] godly
[2:34:17] so you what you need to do is control
[2:34:20] that life and live such a good life that
[2:34:23] when you ask god anything you know
[2:34:26] you know we have confidence in god of
[2:34:29] that we know if we keep his commandments
[2:34:32] he will withhold no good things from us
[2:34:35] if we will walk with him god
[2:34:38] walking
[2:34:39] with us oh my
[2:34:45] they had but one thing to do they had
[2:34:48] but one thing to do that is stay
[2:34:50] straight on the course
[2:34:53] be steady
[2:34:55] you know english is not my language so i
[2:34:57] don't have enough vocabulary to bring
[2:35:00] this very clear
[2:35:02] be steady i wish i was back in uganda i
[2:35:04] would be now bringing it in my language
[2:35:07] please steady
[2:35:10] don't be wandering meandering be focused
[2:35:16] not wander off here over here and wander
[2:35:18] off over there but stay on the course
[2:35:21] the church has got but one thing today
[2:35:24] to do stay on the course
[2:35:27] they had a pit of fire they had to keep
[2:35:29] themselves in the course by following
[2:35:31] that pill of fire that's what led them
[2:35:33] the objective they could see was that
[2:35:35] pill of fire
[2:35:37] they seen it walking through moses and
[2:35:39] they know it it was he was the leader
[2:35:43] and today we got the word we follow the
[2:35:46] word and this we see the word working in
[2:35:49] the believers and we know that is so
[2:35:51] then god working with us confirming the
[2:35:55] word with a sign is following we stay
[2:35:58] with the word and when we stay with the
[2:36:00] word the word produces the results
[2:36:06] she stayed with the word
[2:36:09] followed the word
[2:36:11] was led by the word the peer of fire she
[2:36:14] had respect to the prophet
[2:36:16] and she could take what the prophet says
[2:36:20] verbatim and believes it
[2:36:23] without question
[2:36:24] and it brought solution to her home
[2:36:28] and all her debts
[2:36:30] were paid
[2:36:32] and she had a surplus
[2:36:36] i want to tell you friends
[2:36:38] we have to pay all the debts
[2:36:42] and we shall have surplus
[2:36:44] before we go home
[2:36:47] all day
[2:36:48] all diseases all afflictions all
[2:36:50] torments all forces
[2:36:53] all those demons you inherited from your
[2:36:56] parents your the other characters she's
[2:36:59] like her mother she's gross i'm like how
[2:37:02] daddy was she's this she's very
[2:37:04] agitating she's this he's
[2:37:07] you know he is this
[2:37:09] he he looks like those you know look he
[2:37:12] has them squirrel eyes and he will
[2:37:14] always look down narrow on you and
[2:37:16] overlook you know all those kind of
[2:37:18] traits
[2:37:20] that you have inherited
[2:37:22] pay those debts
[2:37:25] let them all be paid away
[2:37:29] and then manifest the life of the word
[2:37:32] of jesus and when you manifest the life
[2:37:34] of the world you know what is going to
[2:37:36] happen
[2:37:37] he is going to produce the results
[2:37:39] would you now go back and tell that
[2:37:41] woman look
[2:37:42] you have been following a false prophet
[2:37:49] this message that you have believed is
[2:37:51] wrong i see a lot of errors in the
[2:37:53] elisha ministry i see a lot of errors
[2:37:56] could you convince her
[2:37:59] she knew where she was standing you know
[2:38:01] why some people are being convinced away
[2:38:03] because they have never had their hand
[2:38:06] on first-hand experience with the god of
[2:38:09] this message
[2:38:15] and why because they have not brought
[2:38:17] him in the house
[2:38:18] because when he comes in the house
[2:38:21] he's there in the airport and he's going
[2:38:23] to solve all your problems
[2:38:24] may god bless you
[2:38:26] let's stand up
[2:38:34] there is a song which says i can
[2:38:37] i will
[2:38:38] i do believe
[2:38:40] why shouldn't you believe
[2:38:42] when you're a believer
[2:38:46] why shouldn't you believe that your
[2:38:47] problems are going to be solved
[2:38:50] why shouldn't you believe that the
[2:38:51] little pot
[2:38:53] in your house
[2:38:55] will solve all your problems
[2:38:57] you can
[2:38:59] because you're already a believer
[2:39:03] you can
[2:39:04] because it's not even you it's him in
[2:39:06] you believing in his own word
[2:39:09] taking care of his own promises
[2:39:12] he cannot permit that his glory shares
[2:39:14] with anybody
[2:39:16] he cannot see you suffering and he just
[2:39:19] sits by and concerned but he wants you
[2:39:22] to be a believer to be a perfect
[2:39:24] perfected in that faith that's why he
[2:39:27] lets you take that step
[2:39:29] he's a diplomat he's a gentleman
[2:39:33] he honors his word
[2:39:35] the order that he gave that these things
[2:39:39] must be done like when he told this lady
[2:39:41] go and
[2:39:43] borrow she had to go and borrow and then
[2:39:45] feel she had to do it
[2:39:49] so do it they are certain there are
[2:39:51] certain things that are diys that you
[2:39:53] have to do
[2:39:55] he respects your part
[2:39:58] so when you do your part i want to
[2:40:00] assure you brother sister
[2:40:02] he's going to do his part
[2:40:07] [Music]
[2:40:25] [Music]
[2:40:31] i can
[2:40:32] [Music]
[2:40:43] i
[2:40:46] [Music]
[2:40:55] i'm trusting only in the lord
[2:41:01] trying
[2:41:15] me down
[2:41:18] well i'm trusting
[2:41:20] only in the lord
[2:41:24] trusting allah
[2:41:29] [Music]
[2:41:45] [Music]
[2:41:55] i do
[2:41:56] believe that jesus
[2:42:00] heals me
[2:42:02] now
[2:42:03] he heals you now
[2:42:06] not tomorrow
[2:42:08] don't you ever give yourself a tomorrow
[2:42:11] because when you say tomorrow next month
[2:42:14] this year you have put yourself out of
[2:42:17] it because one day with the lord means a
[2:42:19] thousand years so if you put yourself
[2:42:21] tomorrow that means you'll never get the
[2:42:23] promise
[2:42:26] you have to speak bible language
[2:42:29] bible language is now
[2:42:31] so even if it takes one year from now
[2:42:33] that's still now that's now that's today
[2:42:37] tomorrow is not yours tomorrow is a
[2:42:40] thousand years from now
[2:42:43] now is your time
[2:42:46] once more i can
[2:42:48] i will
[2:42:56] [Applause]
[2:43:04] that jesus
[2:43:09] we are going to pray now
[2:43:11] maybe you can speak to him in your heart
[2:43:14] tell him what you want tell him

[2:51:00] priest that he had been a priest and he
[2:51:02] had passed away
[2:51:04] i thought how thankful he must have been
[2:51:07] how you know that
[2:51:08] he may have not left him with a lot of
[2:51:10] wealth
[2:51:12] but he left them with oil
[2:51:15] he made sure oils and then oh i taste
[2:51:17] some i may leave my family tomorrow i
[2:51:19] may leave this church i may not leave
[2:51:21] you with a lot of wealth i may not leave
[2:51:23] my family with a lot of property but
[2:51:25] i'll leave him with the token
[2:51:28] i'll leave him with faith in god's
[2:51:30] presence in our lives and homes
[2:51:32] oh i think what a what a joyous what a
[2:51:35] happy feeling that father if he could
[2:51:38] have looked over the banister and said i
[2:51:40] left him with the most valuable thing
[2:51:43] hallelujah and you can tell they they
[2:51:45] saw that as the la as the most valuable
[2:51:47] thing the oil
[2:51:48] they'd already that was that that was
[2:51:50] the last thing they held on to they'd
[2:51:51] already lost everything else but they
[2:51:53] held on to the last thing
[2:51:55] held on to that oil because you know why
[2:51:57] that was the most valuable thing she
[2:51:59] doesn't mention what do you have she
[2:52:01] doesn't talk about furniture she doesn't
[2:52:03] talk about property she doesn't even
[2:52:04] talk about a garden or food or anything
[2:52:07] we could do she says well we have some
[2:52:08] oil
[2:52:11] oh hallelujah say i got this problem i
[2:52:13] got that problem i got this problem you

[2:52:16] empty vessel just get the oil poured
[2:52:19] into it and that problem will go away
[2:52:23] oh i think about satan because that's
[2:52:26] who that that creditor represented you
[2:52:28] know that
[2:52:29] you can see it in the scripture because
[2:52:31] he tried to make the boys a bond servant
[2:52:33] and that's illegal
[2:52:35] the law of moses that's strictly legal
[2:52:38] you can't make you can't make your
[2:52:40] fellow israelites bonds servants you
[2:52:42] could only make them hired servants
[2:52:45] that's the law of moses only allowed
[2:52:46] them to be hired servants they could not
[2:52:48] be a fellow jew couldn't be a bond
[2:52:50] servant so it proved it was the devil
[2:52:52] trying to break the word of god trying
[2:52:54] to make him bond servants but the devil
[2:52:56] came to a house that had oil in it the
[2:52:59] devil came to a house who had a daughter
[2:53:01] of zion who believed jehovah and had
[2:53:04] respect to his prophet oh glory to god

[2:54:37] and his servant a round of applause amen
[2:54:45] oh my god
[2:54:49] oh you just identify the devil friends
[2:54:52] the word will identify him don't worry
[2:54:54] word will identify him see it identified
[2:54:56] that creditor that was that was a type
[2:54:58] of satan coming because he was trying to
[2:54:59] break the word
[2:55:01] what he was even suggesting was
[2:55:02] completely against god's law
[2:55:05] and so that identified him but you know
[2:55:07] he came to the wrong house
[2:55:09] [Music]
[2:55:11] you know what he came to he came to a
[2:55:13] house that valued the token
[2:55:16] above all
[2:55:18] other earthly things
[2:55:20] there was nothing more valuable in that
[2:55:23] home the last thing they held onto was
[2:55:27] the
[2:55:28] token and he come to a house that that
[2:55:32] that a father
[2:55:34] had taught them to value the most
[2:55:37] valuable commodity they own
[2:55:39] i just say fathers
[2:55:42] husbands preachers make sure you teach
[2:55:45] your congregations teach your families
[2:55:47] teach your wives teach your children to
[2:55:49] value the token above all other earthly
[2:55:53] considerations even all of them combined
[2:55:59] it wouldn't matter what she had ever had
[2:56:00] if she'd had everything she'd ever had
[2:56:02] none of it would have saved her but the
[2:56:04] oil saved her
[2:56:06] i have i you know i i i say now i know
[2:56:10] the lord's answer we have the devil's
[2:56:13] answer from the lord before he even
[2:56:16] showed up with the problem amen before
[2:56:18] that devil creditor showed up with a
[2:56:20] problem god already had the answer right
[2:56:22] now she just had to be made aware of it
[2:56:24] see and how did she get made aware of it
[2:56:26] because she had confidence in god's
[2:56:27] messenger
[2:56:29] so i don't know if i got confidence in
[2:56:31] god's messenger okay well
[2:56:33] go ahead and try that see what happens
[2:56:36] yeah and try that yeah see how that
[2:56:38] works out for you it ain't going to end
[2:56:39] well
[2:56:40] amen but here was a daughter of zion who
[2:56:43] had faith in god's word and confidence
[2:56:45] in his messenger she didn't argue she
[2:56:47] didn't second guess she didn't question
[2:56:49] she just went barred at all close the
[2:56:51] door and away and did and did the work
[2:56:53] and then she she had to go borrow it she
[2:56:55] had to fill it then she had to go sell
[2:56:57] it and she had to pay it and and at the
[2:56:59] end of the day the lord got all the
[2:57:01] glory because she allowed him to work
[2:57:03] through
[2:57:04] my my goodness my goodness
[2:57:07] so now we know
[2:57:10] now we know what it means
[2:57:12] to have
[2:57:13] to to for for her to have said i brought
[2:57:16] him back to my mother's chamber or for
[2:57:19] isaac to take uh the his rebecca and
[2:57:21] take it into his mother's tent because
[2:57:24] this is the invisible union friends
[2:57:26] that's whether it's whether it's him to
[2:57:27] her or her to him it's it's an invisible
[2:57:30] union and in there all things are
[2:57:32] possible that's that's that little room
[2:57:34] that's the third pool my that's where
[2:57:36] satan is already he already was already
[2:57:38] too late
[2:57:39] you know
[2:57:40] when that creditor showed up when satan
[2:57:43] shows up
[2:57:44] it's already too late
[2:57:46] he tells you he's going to take your
[2:57:48] children and make bond servants out of
[2:57:49] them so they can never go free don't you
[2:57:51] believe it
[2:57:53] don't you believe it they might have
[2:57:55] been born in sin they might be a hired
[2:57:57] servant well they might have to do
[2:57:58] whatever until until the master sets
[2:58:00] them free but don't you think don't ever
[2:58:03] let that devil tell you he can hang on
[2:58:05] to him because they're the heritage of
[2:58:06] the lord and they were given to you on
[2:58:09] purpose
[2:58:10] hallelujah
