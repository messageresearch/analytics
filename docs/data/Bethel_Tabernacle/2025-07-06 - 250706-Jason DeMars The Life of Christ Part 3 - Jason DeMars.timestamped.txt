[0:15] We're going to turn to Hebrews chapter
[0:18] 12 and we'll read verse 14 and 15.
[0:25] Follow peace with all men and holiness
[0:29] without which no man shall see the Lord.
[0:33] Looking diligently lest any man fail of
[0:36] the grace of God, lest any root of
[0:39] bitterness springing up trouble you, and
[0:41] thereby many be defiled. May the Lord
[0:44] add the blessing to the reading of his
[0:46] word. You can be seated.
[0:50] So,
[0:52] as we were speaking before, just to
[0:55] replant that seed in your mind, is that
[0:59] we're looking at the life of Christ not
[1:02] so much as just a generic term that we
[1:05] want the life of Christ manifested in
[1:06] our life. But we want to look and see
[1:09] what how is the life of Christ actually
[1:12] manifested.
[1:14] You know, we speak about the love of
[1:15] God. We want to talk about that. We
[1:17] speak about holiness which we spoke
[1:20] about last time uh and we'll speak about
[1:23] some this time as well but we want to go
[1:26] go through this and look at it and
[1:29] hopefully we'll challenge ourselves a
[1:31] little bit by it to draw nearer to the
[1:33] Lord
[1:35] and that he'll help us be able to deal
[1:36] with maybe some things that are are
[1:39] blocking or hindering us in our growth
[1:42] in Christ.
[1:44] And so as we finished last time, we were
[1:46] talking about much about bitterness.
[1:50] And so if you think about bitterness,
[1:52] it's spoken of as a root of bitterness.
[1:55] Can never have a root without first
[1:57] having a seed.
[1:59] So a root really is a secondary issue.
[2:02] So the first issue is the seed that's
[2:05] been planted. Amen.
[2:08] So there's a seed that's planted and
[2:10] whatever that is, whatever that seed is,
[2:13] it grows then it produces a bitter root
[2:17] and then that bitter root will
[2:19] ultimately grow and produce a bitter
[2:22] fruit. Right? So if the root is
[2:26] secondary to the seed, we understand
[2:28] that actually we need to prevent the
[2:30] seeds from being planted or if the seeds
[2:33] get planted, we have to deal with it
[2:34] right away. If you don't deal with the
[2:37] seed that's been planted, it will
[2:39] produce a root.
[2:41] And so think thinking about that,
[2:45] you know what what could be some of the
[2:50] seeds
[2:51] that are planted? You think about that.
[2:54] um uh by no means an exhaustive list but
[3:00] you know it could be something where
[3:01] someone you feel you feel someone
[3:03] treated you unfairly
[3:05] or you could say somebody treated me
[3:07] wrong or spoke to me wrong or or snubbed
[3:10] me or whatever it might be someone spoke
[3:14] badly of me or someone spoke behind my
[3:16] back about me the list goes on you can
[3:20] get the idea something something happens
[3:23] whether true who are not misinterpreted
[3:30] and so a misinterpreted snub or someone
[3:34] speaking against you in some way and
[3:37] what ends up happening is that seed gets
[3:40] planted down in our heart.
[3:43] And so there's two choices to do. You
[3:46] can just let it sit there, right? And if
[3:50] you let it sit there, what will it do?
[3:52] secondary things will happen.
[3:54] Amen.
[3:55] The root of bit you'll start begin to
[3:57] feel bitter towards that person.
[4:01] Amen.
[4:02] Or towards the situation or towards a
[4:03] group of people. And so if you if you
[4:06] refuse to communicate, if you refuse to
[4:09] if you stuff it and say, "I'll just deal
[4:12] with it. I'll just deal with it." But
[4:14] actually you're not dealing with it.
[4:16] Then what ends up happening is a root
[4:18] begins to grow. And the root of course
[4:20] is the foundation of bad fruit. And bad
[4:23] fruit of course speaks of the type of
[4:25] life that you're living what what you're
[4:28] manifesting outwardly. And the fact is
[4:31] as Christians we can allow roots of
[4:34] bitterness. And if you haven't here
[4:37] allowed a root of bitterness to grow in
[4:39] your life, you are a perfect one. And I
[4:42] want to be your best friend.
[4:45] But the rest of us who are imperfect
[4:48] have allowed seeds to be planted. And we
[4:51] we've just we've allowed, you know, for
[4:55] a seed to grow, it needs to be in the
[4:57] right kind of ground with it needs to be
[4:59] fertilized. It needs to be watered. So
[5:01] what what do we do? We begin to meditate
[5:05] on that. We begin to think on this
[5:07] person did this. They meant this. They
[5:09] they said this.
[5:11] I'm always treated this way. People
[5:13] always say this, I'm always this. And
[5:15] this this is watering and fertilizing
[5:19] the seed that's been planted. And when
[5:21] you do that, every time it produces a
[5:23] root, then a chute, then a fruit. I
[5:26] didn't mean to be a poet,
[5:30] but that's what it that's what that's
[5:32] what it ultimately does. And so you can
[5:36] judge
[5:38] what kind of seed is there, what kind of
[5:40] root is there by looking at the fruit
[5:43] that it produces. And so if it produces
[5:46] um isolation,
[5:49] uh anger, outbursts of anger,
[5:52] um depression,
[5:55] and the list goes on. Um those things
[5:58] are are uh results of a seed not
[6:03] actually being dealt with. A problem in
[6:05] your life or something someone said or
[6:08] some something someone didn't say or
[6:12] what some something that someone did.
[6:14] When we don't deal with that that's and
[6:17] that ends up producing the wrong kind of
[6:20] fruit. And so there's not a person I
[6:24] think on the earth that doesn't deal
[6:28] with this kind of thing. It's normal.
[6:30] And as life goes on and as you get
[6:31] older, you deal with it more and more.
[6:34] And the problem is is that you see
[6:36] you'll see older people and they're
[6:38] isolated and all they can do is complain
[6:41] and be angry. That's the result of a
[6:44] process that began
[6:47] in their youth and wound up here. And so
[6:50] it's a great warning to all of us is
[6:52] that actually we need to deal with the
[6:55] things that we come across. And number
[6:57] one, we got to surrender these things to
[6:59] the Lord.
[7:01] Number two is we got to pray over it.
[7:04] And number three is we got to take the
[7:05] action that the Lord prescribes to us to
[7:08] prescribes to us both in the word but
[7:11] also as he deals with our heart of how
[7:13] we're supposed to to handle it. And it's
[7:15] a it's a very tricky thing because these
[7:17] things can build up to the point where
[7:20] we are so damaging ourselves,
[7:23] so injuring ourselves in this process.
[7:26] And as the Bible says, not only does the
[7:30] bit root of bitterness spring up and
[7:32] trouble you, but then the next part is
[7:35] says thereby many be defiled.
[7:39] And so there's a defilement that takes
[7:42] place of those around you because
[7:44] they're going to have to taste of the
[7:46] bitter fruit that your life is
[7:48] producing. And so that has a negative
[7:50] impact on everyone around you. And so
[7:54] it's very important when we understand
[7:56] holiness. A person can be holy and think
[7:58] that they're think that they're so holy
[8:00] and they're treasuring up so many hurts
[8:03] and so many pains and so many
[8:05] frustrations that actually they're just
[8:07] isolating themselves into what they
[8:09] refer to as holiness. But it's only a
[8:12] man-made holiness. It's only a human set
[8:15] aartedness because you have created that
[8:18] isolation of yourself into your very own
[8:22] little world.
[8:23] Amen. And so that defiles you, that
[8:25] defiles your family, that defiles the
[8:27] people all around you. And so true, true
[8:32] and genuine holiness is not darkness
[8:36] surrounding you and kept away from
[8:39] everything, but it's actually the light
[8:42] which is God himself shining down upon
[8:45] you and reflecting himself through you.
[8:48] And part of that shining upon you is he
[8:50] he comes into those dark places in your
[8:52] heart where there's evil and he shines
[8:56] the light there so that you deal with
[8:59] the issues and the problems that you
[9:02] have in your own life. Running from them
[9:04] is only going to
[9:07] fertilize
[9:09] the seed.
[9:11] And so it's not a matter of running from
[9:13] them. You have to you have to be able to
[9:15] deal with them and then commit it to the
[9:18] Lord
[9:19] because then the temptation is to pick
[9:21] it up and pick it up and pick it up and
[9:24] pick it up. People don't understand me,
[9:26] people this, people that. And again,
[9:29] you're meditating on that.
[9:31] When you're you're you're you're
[9:33] meditating on a thought. As a man thinks
[9:35] in his heart, so is he. So you're
[9:37] meditating bitter thoughts and you
[9:39] produce a bitter life. And so it's so
[9:41] critical
[9:42] to fight the battle. If you don't if you
[9:46] don't actually fight the battle, you'll
[9:48] end up in a situation where that
[9:50] bitterness that you thought you dealt
[9:51] with keeps coming and keeps coming. You
[9:54] have to hand it to the Lord. Leave it to
[9:57] the Lord. Let let him deal with it. I
[10:00] mean, I think that's I think that's so
[10:02] key. How can a person go through this
[10:04] life with all the difficulties, all the
[10:07] trials, all the things that people say,
[10:09] all the misunderstandings that they have
[10:12] without Christ? I I I just some people
[10:15] have a disposition and stuff just rolls
[10:17] off of them. But other pe most people
[10:19] aren't like that.
[10:21] Most people are in a situation my we
[10:23] need we really we need Christ to deal
[10:26] with our hearts so that we're our hearts
[10:28] don't become hardened.
[10:30] Amen. So we don't have that place where
[10:33] this bitter root is on the inside of us.
[10:36] We're focusing on it, meditating on it.
[10:39] And again, out of that root of
[10:41] bitterness is where defilement comes.
[10:44] Out of that root of bitterness is where
[10:45] trouble comes. Hebrews 12:16.
[10:51] Again, context matters. We're talking
[10:54] about a root of bitterness. We're
[10:56] talking about first a call to holiness
[10:58] and then a root of bitterness coming and
[11:01] hindering that call unto peace and
[11:04] holiness. Right? So then he goes into
[11:07] okay when when that happens, what will
[11:10] the results be? Lest there be any
[11:11] fornicator or profane person as Esau who
[11:16] for one morsel of meat sold his
[11:18] birthright. Again, we go back right to
[11:22] what we were speaking about last time
[11:25] between David and Saul. Outwardly
[11:28] speaking, you have Jacob and Esau.
[11:32] We would all choose Esau. But God's
[11:36] value and vision was different. Esau, we
[11:40] we say, "My goodness, Esau was a
[11:42] terrible guy." I mean ultimately
[11:46] sure he was but why was he evil is
[11:50] because he disregarded what God valued.
[11:54] Amen.
[11:55] Jacob was as rotten as can be. But yet
[12:00] he regarded with high value what God
[12:03] regarded with high value. And God's
[12:05] grace covered a multitude of sins in
[12:07] Jacob. And so
[12:11] this is the problem that we have is you
[12:13] you might have all kinds of of sin in
[12:16] your life, problems in your life, but
[12:19] the reality is if you can simply take
[12:21] God at his word and walk in it, love
[12:26] covers a multitude of sins. The problem
[12:28] comes in is where we let this root of
[12:30] bitterness come in. What is ultimately
[12:33] what is this root of bitterness? Is it
[12:35] has actually become it's actually like
[12:37] distrust
[12:39] distrust to the point where you just
[12:42] remove yourself.
[12:43] Yeah.
[12:44] And ultimately what is the root of
[12:46] bitterness doing? Fine. It might cause
[12:49] you to distrust the people around you.
[12:51] That's a part that's part of life that
[12:54] happens. But ultimately the problem ends
[12:57] up being is instead of pointing this way
[13:00] to the people you don't trust, you end
[13:02] up pointing this way
[13:05] to the person you don't trust anymore.
[13:08] And and many times you see people, they
[13:12] go through a bad church experience.
[13:15] they've been hurt and damaged in a
[13:17] church and instead of going like I'm
[13:19] just going to deal with this and I know
[13:21] it's on this level it immediately turns
[13:23] into God you would have total control
[13:27] over every single person here to prevent
[13:30] them from giving me making my life
[13:32] miserable so God actually it's your
[13:34] fault
[13:36] and so this is the problem and
[13:38] ultimately this is part of the issue
[13:40] with Esau is Esau went through a trial
[13:44] and instead of trusting God, he he took
[13:47] matters into his own hands and he tried
[13:50] to solve the problem without faith in
[13:53] God. And that is ultimately what a root
[13:56] of bitterness is going to lead to is
[13:57] you're going to try to solve everything
[13:59] with human thinking with human ways with
[14:02] human appeals and what ends up when what
[14:05] and and you'll actually go continue to
[14:07] go along thinking that you're walking
[14:09] with and pleasing God. And we all can
[14:12] get in this situation. And it doesn't
[14:13] mean you're lost.
[14:14] Doesn't mean you're in Esau. We all can
[14:17] go down a bad road like this.
[14:20] Amen. Amen.
[14:21] And so it's so important for us to
[14:23] realize that
[14:25] many times we choose our own undoing.
[14:28] Oh yes. Amen. Instead of actually
[14:31] dealing with with our problems, facing
[14:33] them, we choose our own undoing and we
[14:36] walk down the path of undoing instead of
[14:39] the path of healing, of strength, and of
[14:42] deliverance. Verse 17,
[14:45] for you know how that afterward when he
[14:47] would have inherited the blessing, he
[14:50] was rejected. For he found no place of
[14:52] repentance, though he sought it
[14:54] carefully with tears, he already undid
[14:56] everything. He already called the
[14:59] birthright useless and worthless. So God
[15:02] simply gave him exactly what he felt
[15:04] about it
[15:05] and transferred it to someone who felt
[15:07] it was of course we understand that was
[15:09] because of God's plan of election.
[15:12] Amen.
[15:13] But yet it worked out in the lives of
[15:15] men.
[15:21] Interesting to look at this scripture
[15:23] because you have a similar one back in
[15:24] Deuteronomy chapter 29. Verse
[15:28] 18- 20.
[15:31] I find this very very fascinating. Says,
[15:34] "Lest there should be among you man or
[15:36] woman or family or tribe whose heart
[15:40] turneth away this day from the Lord your
[15:42] God." Lord our God to go and serve the
[15:45] gods of these nations, lest there should
[15:47] be among you a root that beareth gall
[15:50] and wormwood.
[15:52] And it come to pass when he heareth the
[15:55] words of this curse, that he bless
[15:56] himself in his heart, saying, I shall
[15:59] have peace, though I walk in the
[16:02] imagination of mine heart to add
[16:04] drunkenness to thirst.
[16:07] The Lord will not spare him. But then
[16:09] the anger of the Lord and his jealous
[16:11] jealousy shall smoke against that man,
[16:14] and all the curses that are written in
[16:15] this book book shall lie upon him, and
[16:17] the Lord shall blot out his name from
[16:22] under heaven.
[16:23] So notice how
[16:26] the root this root of bitterness that's
[16:28] spoken of is actually founded out is its
[16:31] foundation is in the self assured
[16:33] attitude
[16:34] and in fact the false revelation of what
[16:38] eternal security is. If you think about
[16:41] that he's saying I'll have peace
[16:44] even though I've chosen my own way
[16:47] instead of God's way. I've ch has chosen
[16:49] my own path. I'm walking in the
[16:51] imagination of my heart. Yet because I'm
[16:54] a part of the covenant. Yet because I go
[16:56] to a message church.
[16:58] Come on.
[16:58] Yes. Yet because I have an anointed
[17:00] pastor,
[17:02] everything will be fine. Even though I
[17:04] choose to walk in the imagination of my
[17:07] own heart, that is actually
[17:10] amazingly a false understanding of how
[17:15] eternal security works out.
[17:17] Amen.
[17:19] Right.
[17:20] Because if if you actually are a
[17:22] possessor
[17:24] of the if you're sealed with the spirit
[17:26] of promise,
[17:28] you will not it will it will work within
[17:30] you and cause you to not walk in the
[17:34] imagination of your own heart.
[17:36] God will work things out. If you've
[17:38] allowed that bitterness, the seed to be
[17:41] planted and the root to form, God is
[17:44] going to deal with it.
[17:46] Amen.
[17:47] Right.
[17:47] Amen. Either we can deal with it,
[17:50] that's the easy way.
[17:53] Or we can leave it there and God will
[17:56] eventually deal with that. And boy will
[17:58] it hurt and boy will it be painful and
[18:01] boy will it bring a lot of changes that
[18:04] you never want expected or thought would
[18:06] happen in your life.
[18:09] And so this attitude of I'm under God's
[18:12] covenant. I'm a part of this. I'm a part
[18:14] of that. I've fulfilled all the outward
[18:16] signs of obedient, religious obedience,
[18:20] but actually I've I'm committing
[18:23] adultery and wickedness. I'm committing
[18:26] adultery against him. I'm I'm actually
[18:28] I'm h holding things in my life that are
[18:31] have become idols.
[18:33] Amen.
[18:34] Things that I'm actually committing
[18:36] idolatry. Idolatry isn't just bowing
[18:38] down to a little statue.
[18:41] Idolatry also isn't merely worshiping a
[18:45] trinity of gods.
[18:48] That's that's not the root cause of
[18:51] idolatry. It's putting something in your
[18:54] heart before Christ.
[18:56] Amen.
[18:57] And we take those those hurts and those
[19:00] pains and those things that we talked
[19:01] about earlier and we actually begin to
[19:03] treasure them more than Christ.
[19:06] It becomes an idol. hurts and pains of
[19:10] the past become an idol.
[19:12] Amen.
[19:13] Pastors can become an idol. Churches can
[19:15] become an idol.
[19:17] Nothing is supposed to stand before
[19:20] Christ in our hearts and in our lives
[19:23] and in our homes. And what it ends up
[19:25] doing when we when we begin to make
[19:28] idols out of things, you'll you'll see
[19:31] that this is the fruit of bitterness.
[19:36] It's idolatry.
[19:37] Amen.
[19:39] So when we when we really look at the
[19:42] root of bitterness,
[19:44] we really have it's it's very necessary
[19:48] for us to understand the fear of the
[19:51] Lord,
[19:53] right? The fear of the Lord is the
[19:55] beginning of wisdom. So you can actually
[19:57] never have spiritual wisdom which comes
[20:00] by revelation unless it starts with a
[20:03] proper understanding of the fear of the
[20:05] Lord. If everything is just flippant and
[20:09] easy and we make a joke out of things so
[20:13] easily, we don't have the fear of the
[20:14] Lord. And so we need to come back to
[20:17] that foundation of having the fear of
[20:20] the Lord in our lives.
[20:25] That's that is a huge issue when it
[20:27] comes to understanding what eternal
[20:29] security is. Because without with the
[20:32] outward teaching of eternal security,
[20:34] the human soul, the human heart
[20:37] being so deceitful will assure himself
[20:41] based on a few different outward
[20:44] signs that he's done. I take communion.
[20:47] I've been baptized. I go to this church.
[20:50] Yeah, I know I don't really live a very
[20:52] good life, but I've done all that I can
[20:54] do.
[20:57] the the fear of the Lord is on its face
[21:00] before him saying,"Lord, there's
[21:02] something in me that's not right. Take
[21:04] it out of me." That's eternal security
[21:07] manifested.
[21:11] And so again, bitter fruit, that's the
[21:13] result of the wrong kind of seed being
[21:15] planted. Amen.
[21:19] To go even further, we talked about the
[21:21] the fruit is what people will that
[21:24] that's what's produced by the seed. So a
[21:27] bitter seed produces a bitter root
[21:30] produces a bitter fruit. Another way of
[21:34] speaking about that the fruit is the
[21:36] atmosphere that you create
[21:39] around yourself. the kind of atmosphere.
[21:42] If it's an atmosphere of love or if it's
[21:45] an atmosphere that's repelling people,
[21:48] you could see if you have an atmosphere
[21:50] that you're repelling people from you,
[21:52] there's something wrong. And you should
[21:53] seek you should seek the Lord to find
[21:56] what what have I what have I done? What
[22:00] thought what bitterness, what root have
[22:02] I allowed to grow inside of me that
[22:04] would produce this this kind of
[22:07] atmosphere that's repelling people away
[22:09] from me? Because the atmosphere of
[22:11] Christ is is love.
[22:22] You know, it's possible for us to really
[22:25] actually outwardly confess Christ. This
[22:27] is this is actually message 101. When
[22:30] you think about it, it's we can
[22:31] outwardly confess Christ but then have
[22:36] the produce the kind of life that
[22:39] ultimately defi defiles others because
[22:43] what kind of example is your life
[22:45] producing?
[22:47] Is it producing a life that makes other
[22:49] people around you want to get closer to
[22:51] Christ? Is it producing the kind of life
[22:54] that makes other people thirsty for more
[22:57] of Christ? or is it producing the kind
[23:00] of life that is an atmosphere that's
[23:02] taking people actually taking people
[23:04] away from Christ?
[23:08] That's very that's important for us to
[23:10] understand and to examine and to look at
[23:13] because again it'll trouble you.
[23:16] Yeah,
[23:17] that's bad enough, but then it'll defile
[23:19] many
[23:20] as the scripture said.
[23:23] So ask yourself,
[23:27] this goes both ways.
[23:29] Do you cause your friends to draw nearer
[23:32] to God?
[23:35] Or are you producing the wrong kind of
[23:37] atmosphere and then defiling and
[23:40] deforming them and conforming them to
[23:43] the world?
[23:44] It's one thing to say, you know, don't
[23:46] be conformed to the world, but be
[23:48] transformed by the renewing of your
[23:49] mind. But what about you?
[23:52] What about the atmosphere that you're
[23:53] producing? What what about the life that
[23:55] you're living?
[23:57] Is it causing other to to be conformed
[23:59] to the world or to be transformed by the
[24:02] renewing of their of of their mind? You
[24:05] God wants to use you and I
[24:08] to change others.
[24:10] Amen.
[24:11] To transform others. That's actually how
[24:13] that's how he does it. We're not to be a
[24:16] neutral
[24:18] uh impact have a neutral impact on the
[24:21] world. We're have to have a positive
[24:23] impact. We're to be a transforming
[24:26] impact to we're supposed to both
[24:28] challenge people to come up higher. Not
[24:31] by being angry and mean, but by li
[24:34] living and speaking of the Lord Jesus
[24:37] in such a way that it helps others.
[24:40] First their desire would grow for Christ
[24:42] and second their their they would desire
[24:45] to take the steps to grow into Christ.
[24:48] The second part of that
[24:50] I would say is ask yourself do your
[24:53] friends cause you to draw nearer to God
[24:57] or are they producing the wrong kind of
[24:59] atmosphere and thereby defiling or
[25:02] deforming the life of Christ in you.
[25:07] So that goes both ways. are you and are
[25:10] they?
[25:10] If they're not, then you need to learn
[25:13] to have good boundaries.
[25:16] This is a very difficult thing for
[25:18] people to have because they think one of
[25:19] the fruits of the spirit is being nice.
[25:22] And this ties closely into what we we're
[25:24] going to talk about in the future about
[25:26] the four different kinds of love. But
[25:29] being nice is not one of the fruits of
[25:32] the spirit. Neither is it one of the
[25:33] descriptors of love. Um, you need to
[25:38] have good healthy boundaries in your
[25:42] life.
[25:43] And if you if you don't, what actually
[25:45] ends up happening is you don't protect
[25:47] the things that are valuable. You don't
[25:50] protect the things that are good. And
[25:52] this is especially hard for young
[25:54] people. They they don't want to be in a
[25:57] position where the crowd says, "Oh,
[26:02] they're not going along with the crowd.
[26:03] They're weird." Amen.
[26:05] And so that that takes us into to
[26:08] fundamental things that are not directly
[26:12] connected to this subject. But as
[26:14] parents, we should be raising our kids
[26:16] to be first attached to us as parents,
[26:20] not to the peer group. If we raise them
[26:22] in such a way that they're attached to
[26:23] the peer group, they will always devolve
[26:26] to the level of the peer group. They
[26:28] will not s stand apart because they'll
[26:30] be looking for what they need the
[26:32] affirmation that they need in their
[26:33] heart from their peer group
[26:35] and their peer group affirming comparing
[26:38] themselves with with themselves are not
[26:41] wise. And not only that is it will leave
[26:44] them eternally looking for
[26:47] uh uh for affirmation that they actually
[26:51] can't find and that only is actually
[26:54] meant to be find found
[26:57] in Christ through the parents. And so
[27:00] when they're so oriented towards their
[27:02] peers, it's just it's going to wreak
[27:04] havoc because they don't understand
[27:07] boundaries. Because as soon as a kid has
[27:09] boundaries in pure oriented kids, what
[27:12] ends up happening is they're weird.
[27:16] Amen.
[27:17] They're weird. Why don't they Why don't
[27:18] they march to the beat of the drum that
[27:20] we're playing?
[27:21] And they're going, I don't need that.
[27:24] Mom and dad love me. Mom and dad affirm
[27:27] me.
[27:28] Amen.
[27:28] They strengthen me. They they spend time
[27:31] with me. in instead in especially in
[27:34] America we raise them to be oriented
[27:37] with their peers and that always
[27:39] produces kids with no boundaries kids
[27:42] that are bitter towards their parents
[27:45] and and if if there's a love connection
[27:49] between the heart of kids and and their
[27:53] parents and their parents are really
[27:55] connecting with them. What ends up
[27:57] happening is the other kids could say
[27:59] what they want about him. they're
[28:01] getting strengthened by the relationship
[28:03] that's supposed to strengthen them.
[28:07] And so very critical in raising our
[28:10] children is to you to have good
[28:12] boundaries as an example. And again,
[28:14] what is boundaries? It's not just saying
[28:16] no to everybody.
[28:18] It's not being mean to people. It's
[28:20] saying there's something valuable.
[28:22] There's a family. There's Christ.
[28:25] There's the reality of the word in this
[28:27] day. And you can't cross that boundary.
