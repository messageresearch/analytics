by the time i went to work and uh i got home and um katie was just wiped out she said man someone must really hate you and because they came after me today and i said well that means we're going to have a good time at church so um i'm uh i'm excited to be here um so i can poke the devil in the eye um so i want to turn right to isaiah chapter 53 i'll just read the first three verses there all right it says i'm still here turning all right who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he hath grown up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath out of jerusalem dry ground he hath no form or communists and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not let's pray lord we come before you this evening to invite you to to to welcome you into our midst father ask that you would allow me to help me to step out of the way father that i would not put my arm to this that i would put not my hand to this or my words or my thoughts but that would be you speaking through me father that these people would hear your words and not mine father we know that anything that i would say wouldn't be able to edify them but anything that you would say would give them eternal life father we ask that you would you would speak through me father and that you would anoint their ears to hear it anoint their hearts to be open to hear your word and be receptive father and we ask these things in your precious wonderful name the lord jesus christ amen y'all can be seated um so this is a very uh well-known scripture i'm sure we're all very familiar with it and um knowing that this is a a prophecy you know several hundred years before um you know the actual christ coming in flesh um that is identifying that when he would come the people that he would come to wouldn't see him as anything special that they would completely miss who he was almost entirely based on his appearance right there's no he's no you know where it says um uh he has no form nor comelyness that we should see him um uh hang on nor formerly companies and when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire of him right he's there's nothing beautiful or special there's no there's no big light show that comes when christ shows up except for those who know what it is right that those who knew that what the star was they saw it but for the vast majority of the world thank you um the vast majority of the world they completely missed who he was because they were entirely wrapped up on the exterior they got completely blinded by what was on the outside um and so i wanna i wanna turn to john chapter seven um st john chapter seven um and uh pull my notes up here while we're turning and uh we'll start at verse one um it says uh after these things jesus walked in galilee for he would not walk in jewry because the jews sought to kill him now the jews feast of tabernacles was at hand his brethren therefore said unto him depart hence and go into judea for the disciples may may also may see the works that thou doest for there is no man that doeth anything in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly if thou do these things show thyself to the world um for neither did his brethren believe in him then jesus said unto them my time has not yet come but your time is always ready the world cannot hate you but me it hadeth because i testify of it that the works thereof are evil you go up unto this feast i go not up yet unto this feast for my time is not yet full come when he had said these words unto them he bode still in galilee now again this is this is yet another example of how even the people in his hometown he couldn't there's nothing he could have said to convince them who he was they were com because they knew him like oh this is just jesus from around the corner right this is our cousin this is our brother this is somebody that we've grown up with they could not get past what was on the outside the flesh that they knew the flesh that they grew up with the the humanity that was right in front of them completely blinded them to the actual deity that was standing there right and so then um it the the chapter goes on and it talks about how you went up to the the feast after they had gone up um and uh i want to skip down to um uh where was that um down to ch verse um go down to verse 15. um and it says um and the jews marveled saying how knoweth this man letters having never learned right because it was because jesus went up to the feast but he to jerusalem but he was teaching in the temple right and so all these people are marveling like well we know this guy we know his educational background he never went to school how does he know how to read how does he know how to how to you know knows all this doctrine where did he learn it he never i mean he didn't even go to school right again they're they're completely stunned by this exterior um jesus answered them and said my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he that seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him did not moses give you the law and yet none of you keepeth the law why go ye about to kill me and the people answered and said thou has the devil who goes to go with about to kill thee jesus answered and said unto them i have done one work and you all marvel moses therefore gave unto you circumcision not because it is of moses but of the fathers and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man if a man on the sabbath day receives circumcision that the law of moses should not be broken are ye angry at me because i have made a man every wit whole on the sabbath day judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment then said some of them of jerusalem is not this he whom they seek to kill but lo he speaketh boldly and they say nothing unto him do the rulers know indeed that this is the very christ how be it we know this man uh whence he is but when christ cometh no man knoweth whence he is then cried jesus in the temple as he taught saying you both know me and you know whence i am and i am not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom you know not but i know him for i am from him and he has sent me and so here's he you know so here he is he goes to teach and again the people are so hung on his appearance his lack of education um and and they're like well he could be the christ he's teaching boldly and and the and the rulers aren't saying anything even though we know they want to kill him maybe they're being convinced that he's the christ but man if he is the christ he can't be the christ because we know when the christ appears he'll just sort of appear and we won't know where he came from and we know jesus we know is where he comes from we're from his hometown this can't be him we know too much about his past and you know everything about him and we kind of look at this you know and it's it's so baffling to us looking back on it you know especially um like in from the sunday school um you know the last time you know when i took sunday school last we mentioned that um when he uh fed 5000 right how he had he had um which which actually let me just look at my notes here because i have this scripture here this is john 6 26-34 jesus answered them and said verily verily i say unto you you seek me not because you saw the miracles but because you did eat of the loaves and were filled now this is this is the day after um he had fed the 5000 and they came to the other side of the ocean to or other side of the sea of galilee to find him so he's talking to the same people um and this is this is how he greets the crowd that came came looking for him um you know you're not looking for me because of the miracles you just got a full belly and you're you're looking for some some handout you know um uh and he says labor not for the meat which peri perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed which is an interesting statement the fact that he's recognizing that he is sealed which i mean you could almost take a whole thing on the seven seals right off of that um that he he is the bread of life sealed with seven seals that would be open at the end at the last day um then saying uh said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god jesus answered and said to them this is the work of god that you believe on him whom he hath sent they said therefore unto him what signs show us thou then that we may see and believe thee what doest thou what doest thou work our fathers that eat man in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat then jesus said to them verily barely say unto you moses gave you not the bread from heaven but my father gave you the true bread from heaven for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world then said they unto him lord evermore give us this bread so here again here it is them completely failing to recognize who's sitting in front of them because they're looking at his flesh and going well this can't be who's this guy prove yourself give us some work to show that you're of god failing completely failing to recognize that they literally ate the very work that they were asking for the previous day right he broke the bread and if anything it's it's a greater more profound thing because in moses day they went to bed and the bread fell out of the sky right the old gods in heaven and it falls out of the heavens well here he is it's coming directly out of his hands how much more of an indication do you want that it was jehovah sitting in front of them right and they completely miss it because again they're hung up on what he looks like on that he's a flesh person and a flesh person couldn't possibly be jehovah right and and again we look at this and are and are so like man they how could they have missed it and we're thinking yeah i mean after all you know christ has made flesh in our day and we see it you know with brother branham and the ministry and that's about it you know like really you know um the we're so hung up on our flesh and what we see and we know our past and where we came from and all the mistakes and the the catastrophe of our history that we completely fail to see christ manifested in our lives and who we are and this reminds me of um i want to i want to go to um uh esther chapter one um keep an eye on the clock here um and i'll just have you all just pull it up on the screen if you could um oh sorry uh uh verse one oh i'm sorry um verse 10. yeah we'll start with verse 10. all right so um just to give a little bit of of lead up to what's happening uh in the story here at this point in the story um if i'm sure you all are familiar um king of hazaris he's kind of king of persia historically he had just taken conquered babel uh babylon unified this massive empire from india to india to egypt and this is a giant event that he's throwing kind of post-coronation to get all the like a hundred and it says in there i don't forget exactly what it is but it's like 160 provinces each one of these has a lord over it he's bringing all these people in and has this massive six month long demonstration of all of his treasure right it talks about how you went through all this treasure house went through all of his wealth all of his horses and his army and just showed off his massive empire to all these people under him and he's doing this to establish himself as like this supreme ruler right he's he's he's demons because he's got to make sure all of his people are loyal right they got to have a reason to follow him so he's making sure that they understand just how unbelievably powerful he is and at the end of it he has the seven day long feast in like the hanging gardens of of babylon with and it goes into a lot of detail um about like how decadent this feast was all about the hangings and all the marble inlay and mosaic on the floor and it specifically talks about how everyone in his house in his palace it's actually a different translation called a fortress this massive fortress in this capital city that everyone from the lowest servant to the highest noble was invited to this feast and everyone was given a golden chalice that was fit for a king and each one was a handcrafted specially diverse from all the others drinking vessel right which historically that's a sign that like that's what the king would have to identify himself at the feast as like the head honcho and he's indicating to all these people that even in when i'm king even my stable hands party like a king right even my the even the the servants are royalty in my house right and he has this massive thing and at the end of it this is where we pick up this is on the seventh day when the heart of the king was married with wine he commanded muhuman and i not gonna try to pronounce all those um the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of hazaris the king and uh come on uh next one um to bring vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal to show the people and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look on but the queen vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains therefore was the king very roth and his anger burned in him then the king said to the wise men which knew excuse me which knew the times for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment um and the next unto him uh some more names that i'm not gonna try to pronounce the seven princes of persia and media which saw the king's face and which sat uh the first in the kingdom um uh and i will actually stop there um so we know the story um obviously she he sends a message out to her she rejects it and and fails to show up which you know a lot of people kind of read this as like well man that's kind of kind of rough that he would just depose this woman because he didn't she didn't want to show up to a party right but again if you really look at this backstory that's not it wasn't just a party right it is the king establishing himself as as this unchallengeable unquestionable ruler and then his own wife doesn't even respect him enough to show up right this is a massive political disaster on for him because his all these nobles that he's got to keep loyal are going okay what kind of like weak dude is this that his own wife doesn't respect him right so he can't have this but more importantly what what struck me is that he asked her specifically because it wasn't just a beauty pageant what he was doing one of the things that he told her specifically was to put the crown on her head the royal crown that he gave her and walk into this room well that's there's there's a lot to that because number one the crown that he told her to wear nobody just wears a crown right only a king or somebody very important to the king wears a crown if you do they remove the head that put the crown on it right you just don't do that because it's a challenge to his authority so for him to tell her to wear this crown it's him telling her you are going to embody my authority to these people he's presenting his wife as the ultimate embodiment of all of his wealth she's the grand finale of six month long treasure demonstration right and she's not and crown jewels are not just a crown it's actually like if you actually look up the crown jewels of england there's like a gown that goes with it and a cloak that's all decked out in jewels she's like supposed to be like the living embodiment of bling when she walks into the room and like from head to toe just this magnificent opulent being who's symbolizing what like the king's projection of power into another human being and she says no right and more importantly not only does she reject the king's attempt to embody his authority in her but this is what got me he sends seven chamberlains which also translates to seven eunuchs to go send her the message to call her out to be this embodiment of authority so here we have this woman who types a church who by the way was at another feast she had thrown another feast for a bunch of other women because all the all the women of the palace right so she wants here's the church who wants to stay with all the other churches and instead of instead of stepping into the position of absolute royal authority that the king is giving her it completely ignores the message that the seven church age messengers gave to her and just decides no and the funny thing is it's not like she wasn't bride material she she she number one she heard the message of all seven chamberlain's right she was exposed to all of their message she was bride material she i mean he married her after all and yet when it came time for her to step up and take authority and position she said no and that's what got her put away right and so now we delineate this um with esther right which i want to uh look at this at um esther chapter five um just a quick quick little uh um reading here uh sorry um chapter verse one um uh now it came to pass on the third day um that esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the king's house over against the king's house and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the house and that's that's good so leading up to this as we know um there you know heyman sends out the gets the king to sign an order gonna kill all the jews mordecai is mourning in the gates she goes back and forth with him asks him what's going on he says you have to go before the king and i don't know i i like i like when i read bible stories i like kind of playing it out in my head a little bit kind of dramatizing it more than yeah it's uh i don't know brother branham does that a lot and so i figured that i can too um so and so in my mind it's like here's esther coming before mordecai and morocco is like esther you gotta do this you gotta do this there's not another option we're all gonna die and she's like but i can't i can't do it like this is i'm gonna die and besides who like i don't even know how i got here like like i'm like an orphan girl and like they named me like her because their hebrew name was hedesa which translated it's means myrtle which is like a shrub she's like they named me after a shrub like i'm just i'm an orphan girl named after a shrub and i'm supposed to do this and and he's like esther get over yourself it doesn't matter where you came from or who you are or what shrub you're named after you're still the queen right you're still the queen and god put you here for a reason he didn't make you queen so you could have a fancy hat and a jacuzzi he made you queen because there was something you were gonna have to do right there's something important that you're gonna have to do and what is she and so this is where she has the opportunity to put on the same crown that vashti had to put on the same gown that vashti had to step into her royal authority and she did it and that was the defining moment of esther that was it it wasn't it wasn't all the build up it wasn't her winning the king's heart and all that that was all beautiful and wonderful and it's all part of who she was but what defined her was the because vashti did all the same things right what made esther not vashti was her willingness to put on her authority and and identify herself as the royal authority made flesh so you know and this is where you know we we talk about you know esther claiming her position right you know brother bran would would say you know positionally placed that here's esther recognizing um you know what her position was that this was her her calling in life was to save the jews and you know we talked we know that we are supposed to be positionally placed and i don't know growing up in the message i always kind of like this terminology like positional place what does that mean exactly like it's some sort of like grand mystical moment like one day i'm gonna be like i'm gonna fast and pray all night long and i'm gonna i'm gonna the sun rises a beam of sun like sunbeam's gonna hit me in the head and i'm gonna know my position and i'm just gonna like you know i don't know like have some you know healing ministry or or build 17 churches in sub-saharan africa or have a theology podcast or something i don't know um and like this is this is going to be this is what i have to be to be this is my position and this is what it means or maybe i'll start speaking with a british accent like jesus and all the bible movies i don't know um but it just seems like it's it's supposed to be like some sort of big magical thing and that was the impression that i had growing up and most of that because the honest secret is most message kids don't actually read the message the way they're supposed to um or listen to the message the way they're supposed to and the end result and what what actually so struck me was that one day i actually decided to look into this i'm like yeah actually what does this actually mean and to be adopted or to be positionally placed and all this stuff and so shockingly enough you can find the answer to this in a message called adoption um it's stunning i know um and so i have this quote it's cause there's actually four messages one two three four um they're numbered actually um and so this is actually from the last one this is a little excerpt and this sums it all up in one happy little package and says and if each one of you in here now has not been positionally placed you might not be nothing but a housewife well you say brother branham i've never done a thing in my life i'm not a preacher well maybe god brought you here to raise a family of children out of that family of children may come another family of children that'll be a preacher that'll send a million souls to christ you had to be here you're here for a purpose did you know that well just like esther but we think oh well esther was a queen so she's important but you're not right um another this is actually from adoption number one um it says that's what he taught his church the church position uh positionally before the foundation of the world when god in his labor pain was bringing forth bringing forth you knowing what you would do he positionally placed you in his own body to be a housewife to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a prophet to be this or to be that he placed you positionally and then knowing like this changes a lot of things doesn't it right because it's no longer what we're waiting for some big moment your moment is monday morning when you gotta go to work [Music] right that's your moment and you know i think of you know in my mind so the other day me and katie have been going through um the um the gospels and um when i read john chapter six and we get to the part where um jesus feeds five thousand right and you know brother graham tells a story about how his little boy's lunch that he he had you know fish couple fish sandwiches in his in his little bag right he says you played hooky from school right to go to jesus meetings and i thought of himself and i looked at katie said hey okay so when he breaks the fishing loaves he's replicating the cooking right so somewhere not in this story there's another story of a mom who woke up that day and made sure her kids had lunch to go to school and that was her job that day and it wasn't anything special she did it just like she did every day it wasn't magic it wasn't a sunbeam hitter in the head she got up and cooked lunch and she gave it to her little boy and sent him off to school and then he came back with dirt on his face and said mom you'll never believe what happened she said you're right you're home two hours early from school i'm not gonna believe it um and he says no no you don't understand let me tell you the story and then it was through that that a mom doing mom things ended up providing jesus with the material that would identify him as jehovah on the earth right so the funny thing is he's jehovah he could have snapped his fingers and just poofed all the food into existence he didn't need the lunch but he still put a mom in the world to let her have an opportunity to be part of the plan he still let the mom be part of the plan and it doesn't matter who you are it doesn't matter what you do it doesn't matter if you're a plumber or an ac guy or a mom or whatever you've got an opportunity you don't necessarily know when you just go to work every day doing the ex doing what god called you to do because you never know when you because this is the thing right the posit the whole point of positionally placement is that it is you being a plumber as if god himself was the plumber right it is you doing with the character and and the the um the humility and the the ethics and the the the charity and all these things as if jesus was the one fixing the pipes or you know if jesus the one painting the walls or jesus the one cooking lunch whatever it was it is jesus doing it you have the character of christ and that's manifesting through you and you just do that because that's your position it's allowing jesus to operate isaiah 53 to whom is the arm of the lord revealed it's the arm of the lord to do things and we why does we do this because we want the opportunity to manifest christ to people and we're going to do this over and over and over again and it's not going to be special it's not going to be pyrotechnics every day it's going to be boring but we're going to get up and do it anyways as if christ was doing it because we are christ doing it and it's going to we do this because you never know when you're going to have the opportunity to manifest jehovah in the flesh to somebody and you don't it might not even be somebody that you meet it might be one of your grandkids or your great grandkids you don't know or just some twice removed person that you've never met but you affected them somehow you don't know but god does and that's why he needs you in that position he's setting up all the pieces on the chessboard and the individual piece doesn't know what's happening he just knows to stand on this square and fix the pipes and so that's what he does and suddenly one day he gets to the other side and all these people show up and said this is our precious brother that caused us to come to the lord and goes what i just fixed pipes and then yeah but you don't understand let me tell you how you doing that led me to the lord and you didn't even know it and the whole point is if you manifest jehovah in what you're doing day to day eventually the two things are gonna come in line the spiritual and the natural and you're just gonna manifest jesus in the flesh the actual why did brother branham talk about if he was a potato farmer when the lord came he wanted to find him planting potatoes because that's that is the that is the that is how you manifest christ right and so um the the the struggle then becomes to actually believe it because nobody the whole the whole difficulty when christ was on the earth is that nobody believed it they no matter what he did no matter what he did he could have done everything they asked him to do that he literally did it and they still didn't catch it so what are you going to do right who has believed our report i want to pull up isaiah 53 those first three verses again and um but can you pull it up in the nlt actually can you do that i can if you can't you see because this is ultimately what the message of the hour is the whole point remember esther esther knew the gown and the crown and the royal regalia that she was to wear she knew how to take that royal authority because she was taught how to do it by a chamberlain there was there was a messenger that came to her a unit that came to her and taught her how to do that taught her how to enter the king's presence because she had to recognize it wasn't her authority right not here to make something out of ourselves we're here to reckon we're here to manifest something that's not us right and the um the message of the hour in this day here you have our chamberlain who's teaching us who's clothing us in the word and the glory and the authority of god this was his whole point right it was this is the whole purpose he said he came to make the bride ready and so here we have who has believed our message to whom has the lord revealed his powerful arm and so that is the question that we have who's believed the message have you believed the message have you do you right do do you do you step out of bed on monday morning and manifest christ in everything that you do right do you win when the devil comes after your family do you put on your crown like esther and go before the king right or or are you vastly well that's not for me and besides i mean who am i i'm just some nobody and look at all these faults and failures that i have and i can't do it right um because because that's what the jews did in that day they failed to recognize where christ was in the flesh and so the message to believe the message actually to believe the message the whole purpose and we can stand up i i went through this pretty quick actually um but it's been it's been 45 minutes um so we can we can stand the musicians come um [Applause] and so i guess if i could say anything to to close it off that going forward to recognize who you are to recognize your authority to to truly believe the message that you are christ come again right that's who you're supposed to be and to to not be afraid to identify yourself as that and to go before the lord and claim what you have a right to esther had a right to enter that into that throne room she might not have felt like it at the time but the reality is that the king was never going to take her head off he couldn't right he loved that girl and i mean look if you paid me a million dollars to beat up my wife i couldn't do it right i mean technically yeah she's this tall and not even 100 pounds it's not a matter of ability it's a matter of i couldn't do it and that king yes he had the ability to take her head off as soon as she step in the door he's not going to do it because he loves her it's a it's a romance he's looking at her and going wow she's wearing the crown that i gave her she liked it that much wow like doesn't he feel amazing when you reflect everything that he poured out on you you reflect it back to him and identify him in you and say look at what you've done for me look at look give glory to god because that's what she was wearing she was wearing his glory all that the jewels and the crown and the royal regalia it was a reflection of the glory of his glory poured out upon her it was identifying his magnificence on her and that's what our lives are to be a reflection of his glory not ours but when we do that when we reflect his glory in everything that we do then we have we're pleasing to god then we can enter his presence and claim whatever we have need of and so i would say if you've believed the message then what do you have need of what do you need to enter the presence of god for what do you need what do you need deliverance from because it's there do you believe that he's in the flesh do you believe that you can just enter that presence and claim what you need and uh if you do then do it amen that's what we're we'll end it [Applause] [Music] [Music] he would pray not i will die [Music] will go [Music] should bleed and die for [Music] who am i that he should bring not [Music] [Music] he'd go [Music]
