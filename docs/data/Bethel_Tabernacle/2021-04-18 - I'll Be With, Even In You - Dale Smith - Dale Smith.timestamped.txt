[49:23] to thy riches
[49:24] in glory we pray in jesus name
[49:28] amen god bless you friends this morning
[49:30] if you have your bibles
[49:32] would like for you to go with me into
[49:34] saint john's gospel chapter 15
[49:38] and we'll also uh cross over into
[49:42] chapter 17 as well just to make a couple
[49:46] of points before we go into our text
[49:48] i've had
[49:49] quite a bit of
[49:53] lengthy material and so i don't want to
[49:56] be
[49:57] lengthy but very studious with our time
[50:00] this morning in saint john chapter 15
[50:03] and we want to read
[50:05] there verse 4. saint john 15
[50:08] and verse 4 abide in me and i
[50:12] in you as the branch cannot bear fruit
[50:16] of itself
[50:17] except it abide in the vine
[50:21] no more than can ye except ye
[50:24] abide in me amen god bless the word
[50:28] this morning as you have your seats i'd
[50:30] like to look over
[50:32] also into 7 chapter 17
[50:37] and there in verse 10
[50:40] and jesus here in this is uh
[50:44] called the uh the the the
[50:48] intercessory prayer of the lord jesus
[50:51] he uh here is in this in the midst of
[50:54] this prayer
[50:55] one of our most
[51:00] cherished chapters of the bible
[51:04] because of the things that the lord
[51:06] references here
[51:10] do you believe that that the father
[51:12] heard the lord jesus's prayers
[51:15] do you believe that he answered those
[51:17] prayers
[51:19] well i have my bible says that he always
[51:23] amen hears him and so uh
[51:26] so we know that this prayer is god's own
[51:30] prayer for his church
[51:33] concerning the relationship between
[51:37] the son of god relationship as that he
[51:40] would have
[51:41] with his church and this was to sanctify
[51:45] all that would believe upon his name and
[51:47] that would hear the gospel of those that
[51:50] had preached it from the
[51:53] from the time of the disciples because
[51:55] he spoke he was praying there for the
[51:57] disciples
[51:58] and then he told them uh and so
[52:01] may this be the benefit
[52:04] of all the hearers of what these that
[52:08] i'm sanctified
[52:09] that when they go out and preach and
[52:11] when they preach the message
[52:13] to the people that they they also these
[52:16] hearers of the gospel that they also
[52:20] would be sanctified and so
[52:24] so these are scriptures that apply to
[52:27] you and i
[52:28] today in a very real way because we have
[52:31] believed the true report is that right
[52:34] in chapter 17 and verse 10 it says
[52:37] and all mine are thine
[52:42] and thine are mine
[52:45] and i am glorified
[52:48] when they come to church
[52:52] hello i'm glorified in them
[52:55] in them let's cross the page there in
[52:59] verse
[53:00] 20.
[53:03] it says neither pray i for these alone
[53:05] but for them
[53:06] also which shall believe on me
[53:09] through their word
[53:14] that they all may be one as thou
[53:17] father art in me and i in thee
[53:20] that they also may be one in
[53:24] us that the world may believe that thou
[53:28] has sent me and the glory
[53:31] which thou gavest me i have given them
[53:36] that they may be one even as we are
[53:40] one
[53:42] i want to title this this morning from a
[53:46] quote uh that is quoted many times by
[53:49] the prophet of god you won't find this
[53:51] in the king james bible
[53:52] but uh brother branham says i'll be with
[53:55] you even in you
[53:56] until the end of the world and so
[54:00] these are the scriptures that support
[54:03] that statement
[54:05] that brother branham makes even as paul
[54:08] made reference to melchizedek and
[54:11] different
[54:11] places in the bible concerning women's
[54:14] hair and things like this that these
[54:16] were
[54:17] not necessarily places you could go
[54:20] in the old testament to verify these
[54:23] things you just had to believe that god
[54:25] had sent a prophet in the form of paul
[54:27] and that what he said was of the lord
[54:31] and so
[54:32] peter then actually referred to the
[54:35] the teachings of paul as scripture
[54:38] and so we can also in this day refer to
[54:42] the thus saith the lord prophet of our
[54:44] day
[54:45] as not to add to the world but to
[54:48] amplify
[54:50] to to amplify the word of god that was
[54:52] already preached
[54:54] i want to uh start with a message
[54:58] in the token i thought that was striking
[55:00] that brother brad would say that it came
[55:01] up
[55:02] three times one to sing that song and it
[55:04] was the first quote that i had
[55:06] on my my uh my page so i think that's
[55:09] uh you know we just appreciate the lord
[55:11] leading us
[55:12] uh today now um
[55:16] first of all brother branham in
[55:18] throughout the message
[55:20] he begins to uh he takes this line of
[55:23] thought that says
[55:24] that that we cannot uh uh that we
[55:28] live by dead substance you remember the
[55:30] quote
[55:32] he said something uh has to die
[55:35] in order for you to live uh
[55:38] in a natural way something had to die
[55:41] whether
[55:42] it be uh you know the greens he said the
[55:44] greens had to die in order for
[55:46] you know if you eat the chicken the
[55:47] chicken had to die you eat the drink the
[55:49] milk the bacteria had to die something
[55:52] in order for you to live naturally
[55:54] something had to die naturally
[55:57] he said how much more is it that if
[55:59] something
[56:00] for us to live uh spiritually then there
[56:04] had to be
[56:05] something that would die for us
[56:08] spiritually
[56:09] not that jesus died in a spiritual sense
[56:11] but that
[56:12] when he died in a a as a
[56:16] human that his spirit was released and
[56:18] when that spirit was released
[56:21] when the blood cell broke brother brown
[56:23] said that when that blood cell
[56:24] broke when that spear pierced that
[56:26] original blood cell
[56:28] it released the power it released the
[56:31] power that contained christ
[56:33] into humanity and it released that power
[56:36] to come back upon the church on the day
[56:39] of pentecost
[56:40] and so brother branham from the message
[56:42] the token he makes this statement
[56:44] i thought this was just striking to me
[56:46] he said and if something
[56:48] has to die so you can live physically
[56:51] how much more is it something had to die
[56:54] so that we could live eternally and it's
[56:57] listen to this quote and it's by the
[57:00] substance
[57:01] of this death that i'm speaking on
[57:04] tonight
[57:05] that we are alive tonight he uses
[57:08] the phrase the substance of death
[57:12] and as for our subtitle this morning
[57:14] we'll speak on the substance
[57:17] of death and so if i were to have this
[57:20] morning
[57:20] a a corpse laying here in a coffin we've
[57:24] we've had a few here with us in the form
[57:27] of ashes or
[57:28] or in you know coffin form or whatever
[57:32] but we realize brother that says that
[57:33] that's not that person
[57:36] but that is just the body that they
[57:39] lived in
[57:40] and so i can i can i can assure you
[57:43] today that a
[57:44] a corpse is not the substance of
[57:48] death you see it is the it was the
[57:51] substance
[57:52] of a life but the substance that made
[57:56] that
[57:56] death alive was the spirit that was in
[57:59] that corpse
[58:01] and so when that spirit leaves that
[58:04] body it becomes a corpse but the
[58:07] substance of
[58:08] death what made that alive before
[58:11] was the spirit that was in it and so we
[58:14] realize that in the blood is what keeps
[58:17] your
[58:17] body alive but yet there's a spirit
[58:20] inside of that blood without that
[58:23] spirit you no longer exist
[58:28] and so we're looking at the substance
[58:31] of this death that i'm speaking on
[58:34] now uh brother brown tells us here
[58:38] he says now our sacrifice today
[58:41] not only an ordinary human being
[58:45] but it was god himself that was
[58:48] identified in
[58:49] flesh here upon the earth and when that
[58:51] blood cell
[58:53] broke not only did the soul of a man or
[58:56] a spirit of a man
[58:58] but god himself who was identified in
[59:02] that man returns back upon the believer
[59:04] in the baptism of the holy ghost or the
[59:07] holy spirit he says here
[59:09] that's the token that god requires today
[59:13] the token of today
[59:14] that we have today must be the holy
[59:17] spirit
[59:18] that's god's required token will prove
[59:21] it to you
[59:22] by the scriptures he goes on without the
[59:25] holy spirit
[59:27] you do you do not display the token
[59:30] that is the token shows that you have
[59:33] been identified yourself
[59:35] with the sacrifice and god has sent
[59:39] you back the token to show that you have
[59:42] been accepted
[59:44] until that is done no matter how good
[59:47] you are
[59:49] how much you know how a college
[59:52] professor
[59:53] a good person a preacher whatever it
[59:56] might be you are
[59:57] absolutely not recognized until you
[1:00:01] show that token amen and this
[1:00:05] token is what separated the children of
[1:00:09] god
[1:00:09] from the from the children of egypt this
[1:00:12] is what was the deciding
[1:00:14] factor it was it so drew
[1:00:17] a line of demarcation that that token
[1:00:21] had to be applied or they died like
[1:00:24] egypt died it didn't matter brother
[1:00:27] branham said if they could go in the
[1:00:29] back and prove that they were
[1:00:30] circumcised that they they could prove
[1:00:33] that they had the bitter herbs they
[1:00:35] could prove that they
[1:00:36] had the the lamb slain and it was
[1:00:38] roasted with fire
[1:00:40] they could cover all the bases all the
[1:00:42] way around
[1:00:43] they could have the blood in the bucket
[1:00:46] but if it was
[1:00:47] not on displayed they were not
[1:00:49] identified
[1:00:50] to the slaying angel that was coming
[1:00:54] through the land
[1:00:55] and they would have died like egypt died
[1:00:57] and may i
[1:00:58] say this morning amen that this morning
[1:01:01] if the blood is not on display in your
[1:01:04] life
[1:01:05] if the holy ghost is not amen emanating
[1:01:08] from you in every aspect
[1:01:10] of your life you'll die like atomic
[1:01:12] fodder
[1:01:13] in the united states when she's bombed
[1:01:16] you say oh brother dale you're trying to
[1:01:18] scare it no i'm trying to tell you the
[1:01:20] truth
[1:01:21] amen there's a token that is available
[1:01:24] today
[1:01:24] it was not available until the evening
[1:01:28] lights began to shine
[1:01:29] but those lights are shining here this
[1:01:32] morning and we can receive the baptism
[1:01:35] of the holy ghost which is the person of
[1:01:38] god
[1:01:38] himself coming down and dwelling in you
[1:01:41] and making you a new creature in christ
[1:01:44] jesus
[1:01:45] and if you're not new today then friend
[1:01:48] you'll perish with the world
[1:01:50] that's what the bible says
[1:01:53] amen well you help me i'll preach a
[1:01:57] little this morning by the way
[1:02:00] now uh he said this was going to
[1:02:07] separate and make a difference between
[1:02:08] those who were going
[1:02:09] out of egypt and those who were going to
[1:02:12] stay in egypt
[1:02:14] and perish with egypt it
[1:02:19] made the difference let me here to tell
[1:02:22] you this morning friends
[1:02:24] it's the holy ghost that makes the
[1:02:26] difference
[1:02:28] you say what makes you different today
[1:02:30] is it my religion
[1:02:32] it's the suit i wear
[1:02:35] you know is it the amount of money i
[1:02:37] have in my pocket
[1:02:39] so does that make the difference today
[1:02:40] is that is that what sets me apart the
[1:02:42] size of the
[1:02:43] square footage of my home the acreage of
[1:02:46] my property
[1:02:47] is that going to set me apart is that
[1:02:49] going to make me different
[1:02:51] it can't it can't
[1:02:55] i praise the new mexico just uh you know
[1:02:58] it's a little
[1:02:59] run down a little place anybody that's
[1:03:00] ever seen it knows it ain't nothing to
[1:03:02] you know he said well he's got land i
[1:03:05] got a junk pile
[1:03:08] you know it's just out there it's just
[1:03:10] somebody give it to me and i don't know
[1:03:11] what to do with it
[1:03:13] if anybody got little money wants to
[1:03:15] spend i'll make you a deal
[1:03:16] he can't refuse
[1:03:20] but but but from my back porch or from
[1:03:22] my
[1:03:23] side of my house there on the north side
[1:03:24] of my house i can look out on a clear
[1:03:26] day
[1:03:28] and i can see 18 miles i know that
[1:03:29] sounds like a long ways to y'all out
[1:03:31] here but
[1:03:32] out west we can see a ways that's why i
[1:03:34] like it out there
[1:03:36] but i can see 18 miles in one direction
[1:03:40] and on this top of the hill
[1:03:41] 18 miles away i can see the late
[1:03:44] jeffrey epstein's mansion
[1:03:48] now what makes a difference he's gone to
[1:03:52] his
[1:03:52] reward whatever that is i don't know he
[1:03:56] had more money he was a fortune 500
[1:03:58] member i worked for him i knew him
[1:03:59] personally he had more money than you
[1:04:01] could shake a stick at
[1:04:03] two sticks he he could he could he had
[1:04:07] he had he had women he had homes in
[1:04:10] florida

[1:04:22] he had money that he didn't even know
[1:04:24] where it was
[1:04:29] and i had two nickels to rub together
[1:04:32] but let me tell you i would much rather
[1:04:34] have my two nickels
[1:04:36] amen than to be where he's at today
[1:04:40] what made the difference
[1:04:44] the token made the difference
[1:04:53] brother brand makes this statement he
[1:04:54] said did you ever stop
[1:04:56] to think this morning
[1:05:00] i put that in all caps
[1:05:03] this morning when you got up when you
[1:05:06] started your day tomorrow when you start
[1:05:07] your day yesterday
[1:05:09] when you started your day did you get up
[1:05:12] and
[1:05:12] stop to think
[1:05:16] what did you think about oh i gotta you
[1:05:19] know i gotta get i got
[1:05:21] 45 emails here i got to take care of
[1:05:23] i've got two or three texts i got to
[1:05:25] respond to oh my i got five missed calls
[1:05:27] i didn't get last night
[1:05:29] and i've got this and i've got that and
[1:05:31] i've got this and you stopped to think
[1:05:32] but what did you think about
[1:05:36] brother braham said did you ever stop to
[1:05:38] think this morning
[1:05:39] as far as returning that is it had to
[1:05:43] become visible he already
[1:05:45] he is already here with us now
[1:05:49] he someday now today
[1:05:52] just re imagine that his presence
[1:05:55] being here today did you ever stop to
[1:05:58] think that his presence is here
[1:06:01] that everything that you do in every
[1:06:03] aspect of your life that you are walking
[1:06:06] that you're believing that you're
[1:06:09] accepting
[1:06:09] the fact that you have to face his
[1:06:12] presence
[1:06:14] my bible says that every tongue shall
[1:06:17] confess and every knee
[1:06:18] shall bow and every tongue shall confess
[1:06:20] that jesus christ is lord
[1:06:22] that his presence is here among us
[1:06:25] and we'll confess it someday or we'll
[1:06:28] confess it today
[1:06:32] lord jesus is in another world or
[1:06:34] another dimension
[1:06:37] watch what he says right here today in
[1:06:40] form of
[1:06:40] spirit his spirit is blending
[1:06:45] with our spirit isn't that a comfort to
[1:06:49] you today
[1:06:49] isn't that a wonderful wonderful
[1:06:52] outstanding
[1:06:53] amen monumental thought today that if i
[1:06:56] stop and think this morning that
[1:06:58] that i'm just not here believing in a
[1:07:00] god that lives in an ethereal realm in
[1:07:02] another dimension but that that
[1:07:04] dimension
[1:07:04] is coming into this dimension and that
[1:07:07] his spirit is blending with my spirit
[1:07:09] brother donald to make me what i'm
[1:07:11] supposed to be
[1:07:12] because i can't be anything
[1:07:16] unless he makes me that because
[1:07:18] otherwise i just go by the way
[1:07:20] of my natural human
[1:07:23] nature animal it's been hybrid with
[1:07:27] with with the beast system all the way
[1:07:30] back in the garden of eden
[1:07:31] and so our our humanity has been
[1:07:34] polluted
[1:07:35] and so we'll go the way of the animal
[1:07:37] job said you'll die
[1:07:39] and you will be no different than a dog
[1:07:41] when he dies
[1:07:43] unless amen your spirit has
[1:07:47] blended with his spirit
[1:07:53] his spirit is blending in our spirit our
[1:07:56] eyes can't see him because
[1:07:58] they are physical yet unless there would
[1:08:01] something happen that we could see a
[1:08:04] vision
[1:08:05] but he is here just as
[1:08:08] visible just as real as he was the day
[1:08:13] that he spoke to mary at the grave
[1:08:16] mary mary mary magdalene or
[1:08:20] when he met cleopas on the road to
[1:08:22] emmaus
[1:08:23] his presence is here
[1:08:28] for you uh librarians and
[1:08:31] grammarly correct individuals this will
[1:08:33] be a little bit of a
[1:08:35] grind on you but
[1:08:39] it's from the the
[1:08:43] kentucky amplified bible
[1:08:50] brother brown says it can be filled with
[1:08:52] that
[1:08:54] amen have you ever feeled it i'd much
[1:08:57] rather have something i could
[1:08:58] field amen
[1:09:01] than some of this dry eyed
[1:09:05] starchy old dead religion i want
[1:09:08] something i can feel to brother aaron i
[1:09:10] i really do he said it can be filled
[1:09:12] with that
[1:09:13] felt with that inner charge
[1:09:17] brother jack if he got that inner charge
[1:09:19] this morning amen
[1:09:20] the inner charge that's on the inside of
[1:09:23] the human body
[1:09:24] called the new birth the soul
[1:09:28] has been magnetized into him and
[1:09:31] once in a while when you let your minds
[1:09:34] concentrate on him believing on him
[1:09:37] after a while something a real
[1:09:41] a reality that you can feel something
[1:09:44] sweep
[1:09:45] over your being that
[1:09:48] is the vindication of the resurrection

[1:10:57] you'll set your affections on things
[1:10:59] that are above hallelujah
[1:11:08] there is a requirement for
[1:11:11] identification
[1:11:13] we live in a day of identification
[1:11:16] you can't do anything you can't check
[1:11:19] your email
[1:11:22] you can't go to the bank
[1:11:26] you can't spend your plastic
[1:11:29] without some form of identification
[1:11:33] it has to verify that you
[1:11:36] are who you say that you are and why is
[1:11:39] that how can they just take my word for
[1:11:41] it
[1:11:42] well they could take my word for it i
[1:11:45] could handle my credit card or my
[1:11:47] visa debit i could say i want to
[1:11:50] withdraw

[1:11:59] dale smith that's who's on the credit
[1:12:01] card well
[1:12:02] uh how do we know well because i said
[1:12:09] why would i lie to you i'm telling you
[1:12:11] the truth i am who i am
[1:12:14] just take a look at me and they say no
[1:12:16] no
[1:12:17] no no we've got to have
[1:12:20] something to certify something to verify
[1:12:24] that you are who you say you are
[1:12:27] and i ask you today are you a christian
[1:12:31] well absolutely well how do i know
[1:12:35] you've got to be
[1:12:37] certified you've got to be verified how
[1:12:40] are we going to do that
[1:12:41] well because i have the i took a lamb
[1:12:42] and i killed it and i put blood over the
[1:12:44] doorpost of my house
[1:12:45] that won't work for this day
[1:12:48] but there has to be a life on the inside
[1:12:50] of you and jesus said if the works that
[1:12:52] i do
[1:12:53] shall you do also why because he lives
[1:12:55] in there
[1:12:57] his spirit has blended with your spirit
[1:12:59] so now that when you've got a temper
[1:13:01] that wants to fight a buzzsaw
[1:13:03] when you can't do nothing but let your
[1:13:05] tongue flap on both ends and
[1:13:07] uh loose on both ends and flapping in
[1:13:09] the middle all the time and can't say
[1:13:10] nothing good about nobody
[1:13:12] well then i wonder you're going to need
[1:13:15] some more verification we're gonna need
[1:13:17] a birth certificate
[1:13:20] hello we're gonna we need to go back a
[1:13:22] little
[1:13:23] further than just your driver's license
[1:13:25] that can be forged you know we gotta
[1:13:27] we need to go back and we need to test
[1:13:29] your blood with your
[1:13:30] with your father to make sure that
[1:13:32] you're not some
[1:13:34] you know squatter that you're not just
[1:13:37] come in and
[1:13:37] and slipped in and have some form of of
[1:13:40] a fake identity
[1:13:43] maybe maybe this is some sort of a an
[1:13:46] identity
[1:13:47] uh forgery that we've got here are you a
[1:13:50] son amen of the father that you say that
[1:13:53] you
[1:13:53] are so there's a requirement for
[1:13:57] identification
[1:13:59] but the baby says that this blood being
[1:14:00] applied and identified
[1:14:04] worshiper identified him with the blood
[1:14:06] by applying it
[1:14:08] in his own house over the door where he
[1:14:11] could
[1:14:11] could not go out or come in without
[1:14:14] being
[1:14:15] recognized by the blood
[1:14:18] a very perfect type of today of the
[1:14:21] blood of jesus
[1:14:23] then the blood was the token of
[1:14:25] identification
[1:14:26] and christ is the token of
[1:14:29] identification to a believer today
[1:14:31] so we realize that christ now that is a
[1:14:36] misappropriated terminology
[1:14:39] it becomes just semantics to a lot of
[1:14:41] people
[1:14:42] oh that's christ and christ is you know
[1:14:45] jesus well let me
[1:14:46] who is jesus you see because
[1:14:50] jesus won't work for today the body of
[1:14:54] christ the body of the
[1:14:56] person of jesus christ because that body
[1:14:59] shed its blood the life went out of it
[1:15:02] the blood went
[1:15:02] back into the chemical elements of the
[1:15:05] earth
[1:15:06] but now there has to come that spirit
[1:15:09] that raised up
[1:15:10] christ from the dead if the biggest word
[1:15:12] in the bible
[1:15:13] it dwells in you then it now
[1:15:16] quickens you or gives life to or
[1:15:19] makes you identified with christ which
[1:15:23] the bible
[1:15:24] tells us that the the word was made
[1:15:27] flesh and dwelt among us so now we
[1:15:29] understand that christ
[1:15:31] is the revealed word of this day so if
[1:15:34] your life does not line up with the
[1:15:37] revealed word
[1:15:38] of this day a vindicated prophet that
[1:15:40] came in this day
[1:15:41] then you can you it doesn't matter what
[1:15:45] you
[1:15:45] say it doesn't matter what kind of
[1:15:49] documentation
[1:15:50] or church affiliation that you can
[1:15:53] produce you are
[1:15:54] lost friend you're you're you're you're
[1:15:58] you're deceived in your own
[1:16:00] uh your own imagination but when you can
[1:16:04] identify
[1:16:05] with the word that has been anointed
[1:16:09] and vindicated and backed up by thus
[1:16:12] saith the lord prophet
[1:16:14] in this last days oh then friends you
[1:16:16] can your life can stand there it doesn't
[1:16:18] matter
[1:16:18] what tides come against you what floods
[1:16:21] come against you
[1:16:23] amen what fire comes against you amen
[1:16:26] summed through the
[1:16:28] water amen amen summed through the
[1:16:31] floods some through the fire sun through
[1:16:33] great sorrow
[1:16:34] some through sickness death whatever it
[1:16:37] might be but all
[1:16:39] must come through the blood
[1:16:45] i want to quote from d.l moody this
[1:16:47] morning
[1:16:49] tremendous statement he says so moses
[1:16:54] finished the work
[1:16:58] we find in the scripture this bible says
[1:17:01] that after
[1:17:02] having done all to stand
[1:17:05] stand what does that say
[1:17:08] brother chris that says that when you've
[1:17:10] done everything that you can do to live
[1:17:11] for god
[1:17:13] then just stand and live for god
[1:17:16] you may stumble you may fail
[1:17:20] you may fail miserably
[1:17:23] but just build the temple do what you
[1:17:26] can do
[1:17:28] put your coat on tie your shoes
[1:17:32] huh come to church pay your tithes
[1:17:37] read the word that's something you can
[1:17:39] do
[1:17:40] that's all moses could do moses got
[1:17:44] a plan he stuck to the plan
[1:17:47] what's the plan this morning repent
[1:17:49] every one of you
[1:17:50] and be baptized every one of you
[1:17:54] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:17:57] you can do that and you
[1:18:00] shall be able to manufacture
[1:18:04] the holy ghost in your life and live for
[1:18:07] god from then on
[1:18:10] like brother brown said you might have
[1:18:12] got that from the old 80s farmer's
[1:18:13] almanac
[1:18:15] but you did not get that from the bible
[1:18:18] watch what moody says here he says so
[1:18:20] moses finished the work
[1:18:22] and then a cloud covered the tent
[1:18:27] of the congregation and the glory of the
[1:18:30] lord filled the
[1:18:31] tabernacle moses was not able to enter
[1:18:34] into the tent of the congregation
[1:18:35] because the cloud abode thereon
[1:18:38] and the glory of the lord filled the
[1:18:40] tabernacle
[1:18:42] the moment that moses finished the work
[1:18:45] the moment that the tabernacle was ready
[1:18:48] the cloud came the shekinah glory came
[1:18:51] and filled it so that moses was not able
[1:18:54] to stand before the presence of the lord
[1:18:56] and i and i am echoing this morning
[1:19:00] the words of d.l moody he said i believe
[1:19:02] firmly
[1:19:03] that the moment that our hearts are
[1:19:06] emptied of
[1:19:07] pride and selfishness and ambition
[1:19:10] and self-seeking and everything that is
[1:19:12] contrary to god's law
[1:19:14] that the holy ghost will come and fill
[1:19:17] every corner of our hearts
[1:19:20] but if we are full of pride and conceit
[1:19:23] and ambition and self-seeking
[1:19:25] and pleasures of the world there is no
[1:19:27] room for the spirit of god
[1:19:29] and i believe many a man is praying to
[1:19:32] god
[1:19:33] to fill him when he is already filled
[1:19:36] with something else
[1:19:39] before we pray that god would fill us i
[1:19:42] believe we ought to pray that god would
[1:19:44] empty us
[1:19:45] out
[1:19:49] we find that the bible shows us that
[1:19:51] joshua
[1:19:54] the man tells us that he was a perfect
[1:19:56] type of the holy ghost
[1:19:59] and so here we have moses the revealed
[1:20:01] word of the day
[1:20:03] and as the reveal word of the day the
[1:20:04] bible says that moses was dead
[1:20:07] and that that commission then was handed
[1:20:10] over to
[1:20:11] joshua and so that joshua brother brahm
[1:20:14] tells us
[1:20:15] is a type of jesus which joshua means
[1:20:19] jehovah's savior
[1:20:20] and so does jesus mean jehovah's savior
[1:20:24] and joshua was true
[1:20:28] to the token sign that his messengers
[1:20:32] had preached under the first exodus
[1:20:36] as they come out and we're going into
[1:20:38] canaanland
[1:20:39] which is a type of the holy ghost it's
[1:20:42] not a type of heaven
[1:20:44] brother brown plainly tells us that
[1:20:45] canaan was not a type of heaven
[1:20:48] he said because there was killing and
[1:20:50] there was wars
[1:20:53] and so but it is a type of the holy
[1:20:55] ghost
[1:20:56] why because the holy ghost amen what
[1:20:59] happens when the holy ghost comes on is
[1:21:01] the killing
[1:21:03] amen and there's wars your wars don't
[1:21:06] even start
[1:21:08] until you get the holy ghost when the
[1:21:10] holy ghost comes then now then the devil
[1:21:13] it becomes your arch enemy and he wants
[1:21:16] to destroy
[1:21:17] anything and everything that you have
[1:21:19] anything to do with and so
[1:21:21] that becomes and then so then who is
[1:21:23] your number one
[1:21:24] enemy at that point is the carnal man
[1:21:28] and so now the carnal man becomes your
[1:21:30] greatest enemy and so that the holy
[1:21:32] ghost now the war is going on here
[1:21:34] in canaan land and so joshua is here to
[1:21:38] help us
[1:21:39] to come in and partake of the new corn
[1:21:42] of the land that's growing up in the new
[1:21:43] land there's
[1:21:44] the fresh messages that are coming forth
[1:21:46] and so that's what
[1:21:48] joshua is trying to get us to do to go
[1:21:51] on into the land to what to place us
[1:21:54] positionally within the land
[1:21:57] where that we are supposed to be now
[1:21:59] that was under the first
[1:22:00] exodus and brother brahm tells us that
[1:22:03] joshua
[1:22:04] was true to the token sign that his
[1:22:07] messengers had preached
[1:22:10] there's a lot a lot a lot of a lot of
[1:22:13] quotation of a place where brother ram
[1:22:14] said that those that those uh
[1:22:16] those uh messengers that joshua sent to
[1:22:19] jericho that there were a couple of tape
[1:22:21] boys
[1:22:22] well okay maybe there was but here
[1:22:25] brother evan said they was preachers
[1:22:27] so uh i'll go i'll i'll i could take it
[1:22:30] either way
[1:22:30] i play a tape or i can preach how do you
[1:22:32] want it
[1:22:36] but he said that he was true to the
[1:22:38] token sign
[1:22:40] that his messengers had preached in
[1:22:42] other words
[1:22:43] these two uh witnesses or these
[1:22:45] witnesses i don't know if it was two or
[1:22:46] more but
[1:22:47] whoever they were that they went into
[1:22:49] jericho to spy out the land
[1:22:51] they got there and nobody would hear
[1:22:53] what they had to say but this little
[1:22:54] harlot woman
[1:22:55] rahab and what did they do but they came
[1:22:59] preaching a true sign they came
[1:23:02] preaching a token message they began
[1:23:05] preaching that look we were brought out
[1:23:07] of egypt all of
[1:23:08] egypt died their firstborn was
[1:23:12] annihilated
[1:23:13] their armies died in the red sea and
[1:23:15] we're here to tell you
[1:23:17] this is what's going to happen to
[1:23:19] jericho
[1:23:20] here and not too many days and so you
[1:23:22] need to get ready and get the token
[1:23:24] applied to your life
[1:23:26] because destruction is coming run for
[1:23:29] your lives
[1:23:30] and so when when they preach this this
[1:23:33] one little harlot lady
[1:23:34] she she now embraces this teaching
[1:23:38] and so she goes give me a true token
[1:23:42] give me something that i can save my
[1:23:45] house with
[1:23:46] give me something that my old tired
[1:23:49] daddy can
[1:23:50] hold on to my my dear old decrepit
[1:23:52] mother
[1:23:53] that they can believe amen and be saved
[1:23:55] my children
[1:23:56] my grandchildren amen my sons and my
[1:23:59] daughters
[1:23:59] whoever it might be it was in my house
[1:24:02] there's got to be
[1:24:03] some way that we can apply a true token
[1:24:07] oh my think about it this morning
[1:24:10] friends
[1:24:11] amen and so the the the brother brown
[1:24:14] tells us he said but that
[1:24:16] that joshua was true
[1:24:21] to the token sign that these messengers
[1:24:24] had preached
[1:24:26] oh my think about it that the holy ghost
[1:24:29] of today
[1:24:30] will be true to the same gospel amen the
[1:24:33] token preachers are preaching this
[1:24:35] morning
[1:24:37] amen
[1:24:41] and so he said what is the token he said
[1:24:44] this cord that you're going to let us
[1:24:45] down with
[1:24:47] you just make sure this is hanging out
[1:24:49] the window
[1:24:51] you make sure this is on display because
[1:24:53] this is going to be your
[1:24:56] identification this is going to be your
[1:24:59] biometric signature hallelujah this is
[1:25:03] what is going to be
[1:25:04] amen that we're going to be we're going
[1:25:06] to identify this
[1:25:07] token with you and you are identified
[1:25:11] with us
[1:25:13] and so when this all takes place amen
[1:25:16] we're not going to know that this this
[1:25:18] is a a a
[1:25:19] direct uh uh identification
[1:25:23] this is your passport
[1:25:26] this is your passport
[1:25:30] to get a u.s passport the first thing
[1:25:33] you have to have i have a list of this i
[1:25:34] can put it up over there over the head
[1:25:36] but the first thing that you have to
[1:25:38] have is a
[1:25:40] a document let's see if i can do this
[1:25:43] without
[1:25:45] completely losing my notes this morning
[1:25:52] let's see
[1:25:57] yes requirements for a us passport
[1:26:01] first thing you have to have is a ds-11
[1:26:03] application

[1:26:28] all this thing it has all this
[1:26:30] pertinent information that's about you
[1:26:32] the second thing that you have to have
[1:26:34] is that you have to have proof of your
[1:26:37] u.s citizenship
[1:26:40] such as a birth or
[1:26:43] naturalization certificate so you
[1:26:46] so so now then you've been given this by
[1:26:48] the us government whether it be at the
[1:26:50] hospital that you were born on or if you
[1:26:52] came through
[1:26:53] you know back in the day if you came

[1:27:03] a government
[1:27:04] issued photo id such as driver's license
[1:27:07] or military id

[1:28:07] right down to washington
[1:28:10] d.c while go right in the u.s embassy
[1:28:12] you could go right up to the
[1:28:14] consulate of the united states of
[1:28:16] america and you could hand him this
[1:28:18] fully intact packet
[1:28:22] and he would look at you like a mule
[1:28:24] looking at a new gate
[1:28:27] and he'd say you're still missing

[1:28:30] brother jack i've got it here
[1:28:32] it's there i got the photos i got the i
[1:28:34] got the documentation i've got the
[1:28:36] the ds-11 i've got i got everything
[1:28:40] there and i got every piece of it now
[1:28:43] come on give me my passport i'm going to
[1:28:45] get out of here
[1:28:46] i got to travel i'm going to leave in
[1:28:48] this world
[1:28:49] you said no you're missing something
[1:28:51] what
[1:28:53] 60 bucks
[1:28:59] there's got to be payment hallelujah you
[1:29:02] can have everything this morning but
[1:29:05] until there's
[1:29:05] payment there's proof that the price has
[1:29:09] been paid
[1:29:10] amen there's only one price that god
[1:29:13] will accept
[1:29:14] and that's the blood that is shed on
[1:29:16] calvary
[1:29:17] that's the purchase price that's a
[1:29:19] ransom for your soul
[1:29:21] the only way you're getting out of here
[1:29:24] amen is if somebody paid the price for
[1:29:26] you
[1:29:27] because you can't pay it yourself god
[1:29:30] don't accept your currency he only
[1:29:33] accepts a currency from heaven
[1:29:35] amen god he said i come from god and i
[1:29:39] go
[1:29:39] back to god
[1:29:44] under the second exodus this is my
[1:29:47] thought i just extrapolated this from
[1:29:48] the first quote
[1:29:50] that that that joshua was true to the
[1:29:53] token
[1:29:55] that the messengers had preached well
[1:29:58] then we have a second exodus
[1:30:00] so i injected this in the middle of the
[1:30:02] quote jesus preached
[1:30:03] a token message of i'll be with you
[1:30:08] even in you that was the token
[1:30:11] we read it there we could go on and read
[1:30:12] many other places about the comforter
[1:30:14] and i'll send the comforter in my name
[1:30:16] he'll lead god and reprove the world
[1:30:19] and he'll lead guide and direct you into
[1:30:20] all truth and bring into your
[1:30:21] remembrance of things that i have taught
[1:30:23] you
[1:30:23] this is what the holy ghost would do
[1:30:25] that he would identify
[1:30:27] himself with you and you with the father
[1:30:30] and
[1:30:30] you would be one in the word
[1:30:35] and so jesus preached the token message
[1:30:37] of i'll be with you even in you
[1:30:38] and he was true to the token message
[1:30:42] that his apostles
[1:30:43] preached on the day of pentecost from
[1:30:45] our text
[1:30:47] where he said there he says and neither
[1:30:49] pray
[1:30:50] i for these alone but for them also
[1:30:53] which shall believe on me through their
[1:30:56] word
[1:30:59] so jesus now had to be true to the token
[1:31:02] messengers
[1:31:05] or the token message that the apostles
[1:31:07] preached because he had already
[1:31:08] sanctified them
[1:31:09] and commissioned them to go into all the
[1:31:12] world and preach the gospel
[1:31:13] he had already sent them out to preach
[1:31:17] the word and to cast out devils
[1:31:19] and to lay hands on the sick he had
[1:31:21] already done these things
[1:31:22] and so jesus had to come back and
[1:31:25] back up or be true to the message that
[1:31:29] these messengers
[1:31:30] preached they went out and they went to
[1:31:32] the gate beautiful
[1:31:33] they said silver and gold have i none
[1:31:36] but such as i have give i thee
[1:31:38] in the name of jesus christ of nazareth
[1:31:41] rise up and walk
[1:31:43] now if he had not got up and walked then
[1:31:45] we would have a problem here
[1:31:47] because jesus said anything that you add
[1:31:50] are you with me this morning
[1:31:52] anything that you ask in my name i
[1:31:55] shall do it the father will back up
[1:31:58] whatever you
[1:31:59] say in my name they commanded the man to
[1:32:03] walk and he walked
[1:32:05] with peter laid hands on them and and
[1:32:09] and prayed for them and they received
[1:32:11] the holy ghost
[1:32:14] the the very works of christ were done
[1:32:17] in these disciples
[1:32:18] and so therefore jesus jehovah
[1:32:22] joshua of of of that second exodus
[1:32:25] that he stood behind the word that then
[1:32:27] men preached
[1:32:29] and brother madam goes on to say here in
[1:32:32] this
[1:32:33] this message so will jesus
[1:32:36] be true to the token sign that his
[1:32:39] messengers preached
[1:32:41] when he comes
[1:32:44] all under it was saved in egypt
[1:32:47] all under it was saved in jericho
[1:32:52] what about today
[1:32:55] so if i preach to you a true token today
[1:32:58] amen that if you repent and are baptized
[1:33:01] amen and receive that you
[1:33:02] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:33:05] that is a promise to you
[1:33:06] and to your children as many as as far
[1:33:09] off as our lord god shall ever call
[1:33:11] if i preach that to you and it happens
[1:33:14] and it
[1:33:14] has happened hallelujah
[1:33:18] when we when we can look around the
[1:33:20] world and see where
[1:33:22] god's gospel preachers have gone out and
[1:33:24] preached in the lands of far
[1:33:26] they've preached them here on the soil
[1:33:28] of north america we've gone into the
[1:33:30] south america
[1:33:31] we've been in the isles of the south
[1:33:33] pacific amen we've preached the same
[1:33:36] gospel and it's got the results amen the
[1:33:39] sick have been healed
[1:33:40] the lame have walked and the poor heard
[1:33:43] the gospel gladly
[1:33:44] amen what about today
[1:33:50] god will stand behind
[1:33:53] the truth now then if i came and
[1:33:56] preached to you that you could be
[1:33:58] baptized any old way
[1:34:00] we can sprinkle you if you didn't want
[1:34:01] to get cold
[1:34:03] you know we could you know we could
[1:34:06] splash a little water in your children's
[1:34:08] face and they wouldn't have to worry
[1:34:10] about the rest of their life and live
[1:34:11] like devils
[1:34:12] we could we could take you into a nice
[1:34:14] warm heated baptismal
[1:34:17] and get down there with you and baptize
[1:34:19] you in the father and the son and the
[1:34:21] holy ghost and
[1:34:22] we could go all these things and we
[1:34:24] could shake your hands up here at the
[1:34:25] altar and
[1:34:26] we could get you a book to sign
[1:34:29] well jesus don't stand behind that
[1:34:34] billy graham said i get i get uh
[1:34:36] confessions
[1:34:37] or uh commitments
[1:34:41] decisions or robert scott you know
[1:34:45] point of contact for thousands and
[1:34:49] thousands every time that he came into a
[1:34:50] city
[1:34:52] he said he'd come back the next year
[1:34:53] couldn't find thirty
[1:34:56] what was it brother the man said it's
[1:34:57] because they didn't take them on
[1:34:59] to the birth oh my
[1:35:08] from the easter seal brother says and
[1:35:11] it's so quick in their body till they
[1:35:14] couldn't even
[1:35:15] speak in an earthly language anymore
[1:35:21] it quickened their body to a heavenly
[1:35:24] language
[1:35:25] the place they're going to quickening
[1:35:29] power of god
[1:35:30] shook their mortals their mortal bodies
[1:35:33] so till their in
[1:35:36] entire mortal language was transfigured
[1:35:41] transformed into an immortal language
[1:35:44] what a quickening power something
[1:35:47] that belongs and so
[1:35:51] today many will hear me quote that quote
[1:35:53] and they will say
[1:35:56] well brother dale you're just trying to
[1:35:58] get us back
[1:35:59] to pentecostalism
[1:36:02] would to god that i could get some of
[1:36:05] you to live like
[1:36:06] old times is a street pentecostals
[1:36:10] because i've known a few and there's a
[1:36:14] there's a vast difference of what we see
[1:36:17] today and what was then
[1:36:20] i think god was more pleased with them
[1:36:26] but may i
[1:36:30] bring you to the 21st century
[1:36:33] could we come to 2021
[1:36:38] what is today april 18. could we could
[1:36:41] we come
[1:36:42] to today because i can paint you a fire
[1:36:45] of
[1:36:45] a day gone by and well you just freeze
[1:36:48] to death
[1:36:50] it it won't do you a bit of good i can
[1:36:53] tell you about a heaven that's
[1:36:55] way in the future and you would die with
[1:36:58] hope
[1:37:02] but you would still die and probably go
[1:37:04] to hell
[1:37:06] so that's not going to help i got to
[1:37:08] tell you about today
[1:37:10] and so there's a quickening power
[1:37:13] and i'm not reading into this quote i'm
[1:37:16] not trying to make it
[1:37:17] say something that it's not because i
[1:37:19] believe that what brother brown was
[1:37:20] talking about was what happened on the
[1:37:21] day of pentecost
[1:37:23] that they came out of there where they
[1:37:24] were speaking every man in their own
[1:37:25] language
[1:37:27] and they heard them in their language
[1:37:28] from their nativity
[1:37:30] so they were all speaking galilean and
[1:37:32] they were hearing them in the grecian
[1:37:34] and the
[1:37:34] this and that and the other they heard
[1:37:36] them in the language from where they
[1:37:37] were from
[1:37:38] that was one form of this what brother
[1:37:41] brown was talking about here the
[1:37:42] quickening power
[1:37:44] paul later comes and says do we all
[1:37:46] speak in tongues
[1:37:48] well the answer was no we don't all but
[1:37:51] paul says but i do speak in tongues more
[1:37:53] than
[1:37:54] ye all so now then you said well brother
[1:37:56] dale you know
[1:37:57] tongues is such a controversial issue
[1:38:03] and that's why you're hearing me speak
[1:38:04] in tongues
[1:38:06] you need an interpreter
[1:38:10] when paul was
[1:38:14] with this he said but paul was a learned
[1:38:16] scholar
[1:38:18] we know in one point that he spoke to
[1:38:20] him in roman in another place he spoke
[1:38:21] to him in hebrew so we know for sure
[1:38:23] that he was actually bilingual
[1:38:25] and because he was traveled all through
[1:38:28] greece
[1:38:29] he probably spoke greek aramaic
[1:38:33] and maybe a couple others we don't know
[1:38:37] but he was a very learned scholar and
[1:38:39] there's no doubt that he could speak
[1:38:41] multiple language so
[1:38:42] he was by tri whatever lingual now
[1:38:46] but paul went on to say but there was
[1:38:48] tongues of men
[1:38:50] and tongues of angels and so
[1:38:55] according to the quote here brother
[1:38:57] braham says it quicken their language
[1:39:01] they're they say they're they're quick
[1:39:02] in their body to a heavenly language
[1:39:05] the place they're going to
[1:39:08] wow i thought my what what language was
[1:39:12] going to speak in heaven brother jason
[1:39:14] well i know the the brothers up in
[1:39:16] quebec they'll they'll argue with you
[1:39:18] right now it's french
[1:39:21] because the lord spoke to brother
[1:39:24] branham in french and interpreted it by
[1:39:26] two
[1:39:26] interpreters and that's they're they're
[1:39:28] done it's well it's a love language
[1:39:31] i'll go along with that you know french
[1:39:34] it is
[1:39:35] we we
[1:39:38] bonjour i'm trying to get there
[1:39:42] i'm trying to get there
[1:39:45] you know
[1:39:49] but he goes on to say here
[1:39:52] he says the place they're going to
[1:39:54] quickening power of god
[1:39:56] shook their mortal bodies till their
[1:39:58] entire
[1:40:00] mortal language was transfigured
[1:40:05] i just have to believe brother jason
[1:40:09] it means more than just pentecostal
[1:40:12] tongue talking
[1:40:14] i have to believe that it's it's a
[1:40:16] transfiguring
[1:40:18] of my entire mortal
[1:40:22] being well i know the language i used to
[1:40:25] speak
[1:40:27] and would none of you want to be around
[1:40:28] it
[1:40:30] but something happened when the
[1:40:32] quickening power came
[1:40:34] amen it began to wash my mouth it began
[1:40:38] to wash my mind
[1:40:39] it washed my heart amen things of the
[1:40:42] world they changed i started talking
[1:40:44] about
[1:40:45] thinking about amen looking forward to
[1:40:47] something
[1:40:48] of a world that i've never been to but
[1:40:51] sister
[1:40:51] deborah amen i'm home sick for a place
[1:40:54] where i've never been
[1:40:57] i want to go home i've got this desire
[1:41:00] ain't meant to be out of here and so i'm
[1:41:02] learning a language of the
[1:41:04] token i'm learning the language of
[1:41:06] melchizedek
[1:41:07] i'm learning the language amen of shalom
[1:41:11] i'm learning the language of the bride
[1:41:13] and the bridegroom
[1:41:16] hallelujah there's a language that you
[1:41:18] have with a man
[1:41:19] and his wife that can't be repeated in
[1:41:22] public
[1:41:24] hallelujah oh i call her things and i
[1:41:27] would not call her
[1:41:29] amen in public it would be a little bit
[1:41:31] embarrassing for a big
[1:41:33] former marine big tough you know redneck
[1:41:36] to
[1:41:36] you know to say some of the things that
[1:41:38] i say
[1:41:39] oh but she understands it and it moves
[1:41:42] her in imagine in her spirit
[1:41:45] oh and when i pray to my god and when he
[1:41:48] speaks his love language
[1:41:50] down into my soul amen it can't be
[1:41:53] repeated
[1:41:53] in this world it's going to take another
[1:41:56] one
[1:41:57] to translate it can you believe it this
[1:42:00] morning can you stand to your feet
[1:42:02] amen maybe god would speak to you this
[1:42:05] morning in that love language
[1:42:07] that says i love you with an everlasting
[1:42:10] love

[1:42:21] and change you amen and give you such a
[1:42:24] man a fantastic
[1:42:26] amen realization of his presence he said
[1:42:29] i'll be with you
[1:42:30] even in you can he speak to you this
[1:42:33] morning
[1:42:34] oh can he speak to your soul in such a
[1:42:38] way
[1:42:39] that will he change but really i'm a
[1:42:42] pretty good person
[1:42:44] you know i i do good i'm not talking
[1:42:47] about being a good person
[1:42:50] i'm talking about being jesus

[1:42:56] i want you to just be good oh be good
[1:43:00] be as best as you can and stand
[1:43:03] and then let the cloud come that one
[1:43:06] that came
[1:43:08] amen that day and it filled oh
[1:43:11] after solomon had prayed he did all he
[1:43:14] could he built the timber
[1:43:15] the tamara it was a sight that was
[1:43:17] beyond our wildest
[1:43:19] imaginations he built it he overlaid it
[1:43:23] all with gold and jewels and
[1:43:26] and brass and oh it was just it was
[1:43:29] fantastic
[1:43:32] but it was just a monument
[1:43:37] and it was a testament to a rich man's
[1:43:41] desire
[1:43:45] but after he prayed and said if we'll
[1:43:47] just turn our hearts
[1:43:49] from our sins and look to god
[1:43:52] and pray the bible says that he'll hear
[1:43:56] from heaven
[1:43:58] don't you want him to hear from heaven
[1:44:01] today
[1:44:02] that if he could hear from heaven and
[1:44:06] send the cloud
[1:44:08] what if that that same cloud
[1:44:12] came down that came down when solomon
[1:44:15] prayed
[1:44:17] the bible says that the priests the
[1:44:19] priests could no longer minister

[1:48:31] weeks ago
[1:48:33] and he just begins testifying to me
[1:48:36] about how that the lord had begun to
[1:48:39] inspire him
[1:48:40] to take some bible study lessons in his
[1:48:42] home
[1:48:43] uh with his family and you know
[1:48:47] and i don't i don't know what the
[1:48:48] schedule was and how how it went or how
[1:48:51] often it went or what the regularity
[1:48:53] or the schedule was in all of it
[1:48:56] but today you're going to witness the
[1:48:59] effect
[1:49:00] of a dad doing just that and that was it
[1:49:04] you know no angel showed up no thunder
[1:49:07] crack no lightning flashed this is just
[1:49:09] a dad
[1:49:10] saying i'm going to sit my kids down i'm
[1:49:13] going to tell them some stories out of
[1:49:14] the bible
[1:49:16] and just begin to witness to them from
[1:49:18] the scriptures
[1:49:19] and here is his family
[1:49:22] you know and they're listening and and
[1:49:25] god
[1:49:26] beginning to do wonderful things of
[1:49:28] restoration and healing
[1:49:30] and uh and so uh and i just
[1:49:34] i just want to say i don't i don't know
[1:49:36] i'm not here i'm not a doctor
[1:49:38] i'm not here to defy medical science but
[1:49:41] i don't know who told hannah she was
[1:49:43] dying i mean she looks like
[1:49:45] perfect health to me and i just said
[1:49:47] god's obviously doing something in this
[1:49:49] sister
[1:49:50] amen and and and just and i'm just
[1:49:52] believing
[1:49:53] that the word of god is healing to all
[1:49:56] her flesh
[1:49:58] is that what the bible says the word of
[1:50:00] god is health
[1:50:01] to all your flesh think about that there
[1:50:04] is did you know that the bible says
[1:50:06] there's a blessing just in
[1:50:08] reading it there's a blessing just
[1:50:11] hearing it read
[1:50:13] just hearing it read and
[1:50:17] so he he's just telling me all these
[1:50:19] testimonies and say wow that's awesome
[1:50:21] chase and then i i get a text you know
[1:50:24] some
[1:50:25] i don't know days or a week later
[1:50:29] and he says bella wants to be baptized i
[1:50:32] was like wait what
[1:50:33] what who what whoa timeout back up
[1:50:36] what are you saying yeah yeah he said
[1:50:38] i've been telling
[1:50:40] these bible studies in my home and said
[1:50:42] bella wants to be baptized
[1:50:44] and i said i almost have no words i mean
[1:50:48] to hear something like that if you were
[1:50:50] ever a pastor you'd realize
[1:50:52] that makes you want to blow through the
[1:50:53] roof and land out in the road
[1:50:56] so anytime you hear that regardless of
[1:50:58] of how it comes
[1:51:00] one soul is worth a thou ten thousand
[1:51:03] worlds and so so we
[1:51:06] we've been talking back and forth and
[1:51:10] you know she just wanted to continue to
[1:51:12] have her heart
[1:51:13] you know short up and and really
[1:51:16] determined in in in the progression of
[1:51:19] god dealing with her and we've been
[1:51:21] these number of weeks now and
[1:51:23] that one little thing would come up here
[1:51:24] there but i just believe god has things
[1:51:27] in perfect
[1:51:28] timing and so uh today
[1:51:32] is the day and i you know i wasn't i
[1:51:35] wasn't
[1:51:35] uh gonna be the minister and i thought
[1:51:38] and so i said hey you know
[1:51:39] so i'm not gonna be the minister but
[1:51:40] i'll do the baptism and oh it doesn't
[1:51:42] matter
[1:51:43] you know uh and so and i thought wow
[1:51:46] and then brother dale comes and preaches
[1:51:47] a sermon like that and i said i'm glad i
[1:51:49] wasn't the preacher
[1:51:50] i'm glad it was brother dale preaching
[1:51:52] today because i thought what a better
[1:51:54] way
[1:51:55] to make the word of god sure and true
[1:51:59] he didn't know what was going on until i
[1:52:00] told him right in the back right before
[1:52:02] he'd come out
[1:52:04] and so so i got a chance to
[1:52:08] uh talk to sister bella in the back
[1:52:11] and i said i haven't even hardly seen
[1:52:13] her here there at
[1:52:14] an event or whatever got to see a little
[1:52:16] bit yesterday at the wedding
[1:52:17] and uh so i wanted to talk to her and i
[1:52:19] sent him a text this morning i said now
[1:52:21] listen
[1:52:22] i want you to have her get up and read
[1:52:26] it's not long it's only four chapters
[1:52:28] and read the entire book of ruth
[1:52:31] he said okay i'll do it so she gets up
[1:52:34] and she comes to my back all this
[1:52:35] morning i said did you do your assigned
[1:52:37] reading yep
[1:52:39] and so said now let me tell you a story
[1:52:42] and
[1:52:42] we began reminiscing about uh i said you
[1:52:45] know bella it's interesting
[1:52:46] that you'd come uh to feel this way
[1:52:49] toward the lord because
[1:52:50] you in the in your own home you heard
[1:52:53] your dad telling you
[1:52:54] story and lessons and stories out of the
[1:52:56] bible i said
[1:52:58] i'm almost a carbon copy of that i said
[1:53:00] i grew up in my home
[1:53:02] and my mom was the bible storyteller and
[1:53:05] she was the bible teacher you know
[1:53:07] mothers are pastors and so
[1:53:10] and i said i mean i attended the branham
[1:53:12] tabernacle and we heard tapes all the
[1:53:13] time but you know as 9 10 11 12 year old
[1:53:16] kid
[1:53:17] a tape is is only going to have so much
[1:53:19] effect it has way more effect on me now
[1:53:22] but as a child the word and this message
[1:53:26] came alive by my mom telling me
[1:53:30] she'd tell he's amazing i'd be like that
[1:53:32] really happened
[1:53:33] and she's like yeah it's right in the
[1:53:34] bible right here it is
[1:53:36] and i i was blown away in my mind
[1:53:40] as a child and that's where i began to
[1:53:44] love the lord and desired to
[1:53:47] give away my life and take his life
[1:53:49] because that's really
[1:53:51] what the new birth is you know brother
[1:53:53] branham says
[1:53:54] he says you say well brother branham
[1:53:56] what is the new birth
[1:53:58] he said it is a revelation of jesus
[1:54:01] christ
[1:54:02] personally to you it's not about
[1:54:05] thunder and lightning and even speaking
[1:54:07] in tongues it's it's not about baptism
[1:54:09] it's about it's a revelation sovereignly
[1:54:12] given to you
[1:54:13] by a supernatural god and it's a
[1:54:16] revelation of himself
[1:54:18] in the which when you catch that
[1:54:20] revelation
[1:54:21] you look at yourself in the mirror of
[1:54:23] god's word and you decide very quickly
[1:54:26] and very easily
[1:54:27] now that i have a revelation of who he
[1:54:29] is i don't want to be me anymore i want
[1:54:31] to be him
[1:54:32] see that's what that is that's a new
[1:54:34] breath how new birth comes
[1:54:36] you get a revelation of him and you
[1:54:38] decide i like him better than me
[1:54:39] so i'm going to die and let him live see
[1:54:42] and so
[1:54:43] and but now can you imagine that the
[1:54:45] overwhelming majority of the
[1:54:47] of the world who get that revelation and
[1:54:49] god shows them for a moment
[1:54:51] who he really is and they look at christ
[1:54:54] and they go
[1:54:55] uh i'll pass i know i like my life
[1:54:59] i don't want to get i don't want it
[1:55:01] messed with and and and yet
[1:55:03] yet millions do that every day but then
[1:55:06] there's those times those
[1:55:08] as jesus said you know few there be that
[1:55:11] find it
[1:55:12] find that narrow way where they see a
[1:55:14] revelation and i was saying all this to
[1:55:16] the
[1:55:16] to the sister this morning everything
[1:55:18] i'm saying i was saying to her
[1:55:20] and you know what i could see it
[1:55:21] clicking i could see it was making sense
[1:55:23] to her
[1:55:23] i said bella that's what a new birth is
[1:55:25] i said it is a revelation and when you
[1:55:27] have seen christ in the word
[1:55:29] you don't want to be you and because
[1:55:32] that was her own testimony to me
[1:55:33] she said i don't want to be the person
[1:55:36] i've been
[1:55:37] i realize i'm not who i want to be and i
[1:55:39] realize i want to be like him
[1:55:41] not amazing and that is from a dad
[1:55:44] telling
[1:55:45] bible lessons in his home and
[1:55:49] and she says i don't want to be me
[1:55:51] anymore i said see bella that is a
[1:55:53] revelation of christ to you personally
[1:55:55] he's revealed who he is and you decide
[1:55:57] you want to be that more than you want
[1:55:59] to stay you
[1:56:00] you don't you're not one of those who
[1:56:03] loves the loves the pleasures of the
[1:56:06] world
[1:56:06] you're you're you're lovers of the world
[1:56:08] more than lovers of god
[1:56:10] see when god reveals himself but you
[1:56:12] love the world more
[1:56:13] you love yourself more you want to stay
[1:56:15] you you don't want to die and become him
[1:56:17] and i said see you're the exact opposite
[1:56:20] you've decided
[1:56:21] now that you've seen who he is you don't
[1:56:23] want to be you anymore she goes that's
[1:56:24] right
[1:56:26] and i said and i said now you read you
[1:56:29] read the book of ruth yep read it i said
[1:56:31] okay
[1:56:33] i said now here's the first thing you
[1:56:36] need to know bella
[1:56:37] you're ruth and i think she liked that
[1:56:40] that made her smile
[1:56:41] every time i'd say that she'd light up
[1:56:43] say you're ruth in the bible and she'd
[1:56:45] light up and smile
[1:56:46] and i said because i said ruth if you go
[1:56:49] back and you look
[1:56:50] and brother branham he pulled up
[1:56:53] old dr schofield out of his schofield
[1:56:55] bible brother brown pulled up dr
[1:56:57] schofield's
[1:56:58] four those four chapters and if you look
[1:57:00] in a school field bible if you've got
[1:57:02] one an old one
[1:57:02] at least under chapter one dr schofield
[1:57:06] calls that ruth deciding
[1:57:09] and then under chapter two it's it's got
[1:57:12] ruth serving
[1:57:13] and then under chapter three it's got
[1:57:15] ruth resting
[1:57:16] and under chapter four it's got ruth
[1:57:18] rewarded and so brother branham
[1:57:20] brings us out as a beautiful thought he
[1:57:22] says watch this now
[1:57:24] and he begins to say how that ruth you
[1:57:26] know she come the first thing she had to
[1:57:28] do was make a decision his brother dale
[1:57:29] was talking about today
[1:57:31] you know it's it's a sad reality that
[1:57:34] people only get half the picture they
[1:57:35] get a true picture
[1:57:37] but it's only half the story the the
[1:57:39] part they get that's real
[1:57:41] and necessary is
[1:57:44] that you have to decide and you have to
[1:57:48] say i believe jesus christ was the son
[1:57:51] of god
[1:57:52] who died for my sins and that's true
[1:57:55] you have to believe that and that should
[1:57:57] be your confession
[1:57:58] but that's not the whole story as
[1:58:00] brother branham brings out from dr
[1:58:02] schofield
[1:58:03] notice that what ruth when ruth decided
[1:58:06] i want that god to be my god
[1:58:11] but that meant that she had to turn away
[1:58:15] and say i no longer want and brother
[1:58:17] branham said she had to decide
[1:58:20] to abandon her old haunts
[1:58:23] abandon her old life abandon her old way
[1:58:26] see the the sad the sad truth that in
[1:58:29] modern 21st century christianity is
[1:58:31] all i need to do is make a mental
[1:58:33] decision about a historical occurrence
[1:58:36] and i believe he was the son of god and
[1:58:37] he was and i believe he died and he did
[1:58:39] and i believe he did it for me that's
[1:58:41] true but that's just a history lesson
[1:58:44] if you're not willing to decide to leave
[1:58:47] and so people don't
[1:58:48] don't have to change anything they can
[1:58:49] still keep their old haunts and old
[1:58:51] habits and old ways of life
[1:58:52] but i decided that he died for my sins
[1:58:55] and now i'm going to heaven
[1:58:56] and you're not no that's wrong
[1:59:00] that's not true that's not true
[1:59:03] you have to decide to leave the world
[1:59:06] behind
[1:59:07] like ruth did you have to leave your old
[1:59:10] be willing to leave your old life and i
[1:59:12] said then you see ruth what is she doing
[1:59:14] she's
[1:59:15] she begins serving she begins working in
[1:59:16] the field what is she doing she's
[1:59:18] proving her life worthy of the gospel
[1:59:20] and boaz because she's trying to attract
[1:59:21] boaz she needs marriage she can't save
[1:59:24] herself
[1:59:24] she can't redeem herself but she's got a
[1:59:26] kinsmen who can redeem her
[1:59:28] amen and that's what she's needing in
[1:59:31] life and bella's taking all this in
[1:59:33] and she's because she's just read it and
[1:59:35] she's seeing i said see bella that's
[1:59:36] where you are
[1:59:37] you're coming today to be baptized
[1:59:39] baptism's not going to save you the
[1:59:40] water doesn't do anything for you it's
[1:59:41] just a public testimony
[1:59:43] that you've made a decision that that
[1:59:46] jesus christ is for you
[1:59:47] and you're going to leave your old life
[1:59:49] behind and you're forsaking
[1:59:51] everything that was you and you want to
[1:59:53] become him she said
[1:59:55] that's correct that's exactly what she
[1:59:57] wants to do
[1:59:58] and i said now you can't change yourself
[2:00:00] but he can change you
[2:00:02] i said and then ruth had to go in and
[2:00:04] and and then she goes into the
[2:00:06] into the threshing floor in the middle
[2:00:08] of the night because you know to uncover
[2:00:10] his feet because that's a that's a
[2:00:12] an eastern way of of she's asking for
[2:00:14] marriage because she can't save herself
[2:00:16] but he can
[2:00:18] and so when he wakes up i mean that
[2:00:20] would normally be an alarming thing here
[2:00:22] in the middle of the night as a woman at
[2:00:23] my feet and but you'll notice what he
[2:00:26] said about her immediately he wasn't
[2:00:27] alarmed
[2:00:28] he said no no i know i know you're not
[2:00:32] that kind of a woman i know that
[2:00:34] everybody knows
[2:00:35] you're a virtuous woman you have proven
[2:00:38] that
[2:00:39] i've been watching you and he was and he
[2:00:42] was watching her and comes to the chief
[2:00:43] servant
[2:00:44] who's whose damsel is this this is the
[2:00:45] moabitess came back with naomi
[2:00:48] see just just like he needed a chief
[2:00:50] servant to identify ruth to the master
[2:00:52] in the days of in the days of uh of
[2:00:55] rebecca
[2:00:56] she comes off she says to eliezer who is
[2:00:59] this and he says oh that's my master.
[2:01:01] so god needed a chief servant to
[2:01:02] identify christ to the bride and the
[2:01:04] bride to christ
[2:01:06] and i said see she was a gentile bella
[2:01:08] that's you
[2:01:09] you're ruth and she smiled again
[2:01:13] and and i said now look what happened
[2:01:16] she goes back home and i said
[2:01:20] now what is she doing naomi says to her
[2:01:22] all right daughter
[2:01:23] you can rest i said see that's the holy
[2:01:26] ghost you're resting you've got the
[2:01:27] earnest he's already promised you
[2:01:29] i'm going to redeem you i'm going to go
[2:01:31] do it immediately and that's what he did
[2:01:33] on calvary he went
[2:01:34] according to his promise and redeemed us
[2:01:36] amen
[2:01:37] and so so i said so that is the rest
[2:01:40] bella
[2:01:41] of the holy ghost that you have
[2:01:45] you made a decision to leave the world
[2:01:47] behind
[2:01:48] you went to have him be your god you
[2:01:51] showed your life you showed your heart
[2:01:53] was sincere before god you
[2:01:54] you proved that you were ready to be a
[2:01:56] virtuous woman i said now with ruth this
[2:01:58] this took days and weeks and months and
[2:02:00] months all the way to harvest
[2:02:01] i said but but that's just the type you
[2:02:03] don't have to wait
[2:02:05] days and weeks and months i said bella
[2:02:07] for you
[2:02:08] all it is is your heart has made that
[2:02:10] decision
[2:02:11] and you can't change yourself but you're
[2:02:13] asking him to change you and you want to
[2:02:15] be changed and you want to be a new
[2:02:16] person
[2:02:17] i said now when he sees that in your
[2:02:18] heart don't worry
[2:02:20] you'll get the rest i said you have the
[2:02:23] holy spirit you need and it'll take over
[2:02:25] your life and today
[2:02:27] will be your baptism your very first act
[2:02:30] as a believer very first act of
[2:02:32] obedience that we are
[2:02:33] commanded to be baptized in the name of
[2:02:35] the lord jesus christ for the remission
[2:02:37] of your sins
[2:02:38] and you shall receive the gift of the
[2:02:40] holy ghost i said it's not hard to get
[2:02:42] bella the holy ghost is not hard to get
[2:02:44] the new birth is not hard to achieve
[2:02:46] they're one in the same thing i said all
[2:02:48] it takes is a completely
[2:02:50] honest sincere heart who holds nothing
[2:02:53] back and
[2:02:54] and wants none of herself and wants all
[2:02:56] of god and i said
[2:02:57] don't worry he'll come in and when he
[2:02:59] comes in he'll take care of all your
[2:03:01] life
[2:03:01] from that way from that day forward you
[2:03:03] won't have to struggle
[2:03:04] i said where people struggle for years
[2:03:07] sometimes
[2:03:08] is they come to an altar and repent but
[2:03:10] they don't give up everything
[2:03:12] they don't really repent of everything
[2:03:13] they like there's certain things in
[2:03:15] their life they want to hang on to
[2:03:16] and the lord simply won't seal that car
[2:03:18] there ain't no way he's not going to
[2:03:20] grant the holy ghost to that kind of a
[2:03:21] person
[2:03:22] and they're going to have to go months
[2:03:23] and sometimes years be put through the
[2:03:25] ringer
[2:03:26] until they're finally ready to fully
[2:03:28] surrender then god says all right
[2:03:29] now now we'll now we'll bring him to
[2:03:33] this position
[2:03:33] so i said then then bella look what
[2:03:36] happened then she got rewarded
[2:03:38] she got married she got redeemed she had
[2:03:41] a child and that
[2:03:42] child was obed who then had jesse who
[2:03:43] then had david who then
[2:03:45] 14 generations to jesus christ i said
[2:03:48] literally she had no inheritance she
[2:03:50] started with zero and gained everything
[2:03:53] see and i said i said now you remember
[2:03:56] the old the other
[2:03:57] guy who who boaz said now he's closer to
[2:04:00] me
[2:04:01] so i got to give him he's got first
[2:04:02] rider refusal she said yeah i remember
[2:04:04] that i said see that was the devil
[2:04:06] because he's closer because you were
[2:04:07] born in sin two-thirds of you is still
[2:04:10] still this body and this spirit are
[2:04:12] still unredeemed
[2:04:14] the new birth is only in my soul it's
[2:04:17] changed my nature
[2:04:18] and the resurrection will give me the
[2:04:20] new body
[2:04:21] that i need amen but my heart has
[2:04:24] forced this body to live according to
[2:04:26] god's standards
[2:04:27] because the soul will cannot be
[2:04:29] comfortable in the world anymore
[2:04:31] that's the new birth your heart
[2:04:34] has been changed and that begins to
[2:04:37] manifest
[2:04:38] in your body that's how you know you've
[2:04:40] passed from death unto life
[2:04:42] see and and so i and so i said you
[2:04:45] remember that guy
[2:04:46] and he first said excuse me he first
[2:04:49] said okay
[2:04:50] i'll i'll buy i'll redeem naomi
[2:04:54] and boy says okay well you need to know
[2:04:58] that if you redeem naomi because that's
[2:05:00] the old testament church
[2:05:01] you've also got to take the new
[2:05:03] testament and that's ruth
[2:05:05] and you've got to raise up children to
[2:05:07] her dead husband
[2:05:08] and he he said i can't do that because
[2:05:11] it'll mar my own inheritance which is a
[2:05:13] sensible thing to say
[2:05:15] if you've got limited resources but so
[2:05:18] so he didn't have the money because if
[2:05:19] he
[2:05:20] raised up children to her then now
[2:05:22] they're saturating his inheritance and
[2:05:24] then they're going to have children then
[2:05:25] they're going to have children and
[2:05:26] they're going to have children
[2:05:27] and by the time and he can't afford to
[2:05:29] pay for all that
[2:05:30] so a man with limited resources it's a
[2:05:33] sensible thing to say
[2:05:34] no i can't do it i can't afford it but
[2:05:36] but but boaz had money to burn
[2:05:40] boaz was filthy rich boaz could pay for
[2:05:43] naomi and ruth and the kids and the
[2:05:45] grandkids and the great grandkids
[2:05:46] and he he he would never he was the only
[2:05:50] one rich enough to
[2:05:51] afford a never-ending kingdom amen
[2:05:55] the only one who could who could say of
[2:05:57] the
[2:05:58] of the increase of this kingdom there
[2:06:00] shall be no
[2:06:01] end christ i said see that's christ
[2:06:04] christ is the only one i said the other
[2:06:05] the other guy what could he give you
[2:06:09] listen young people what can the other
[2:06:11] guy give you
[2:06:13] you know he can give you fortune and
[2:06:16] glory
[2:06:16] wealth and fame put you on a red carpet
[2:06:19] make you a youtube sensation
[2:06:21] but you know what happens he can't give
[2:06:24] you eternal life
[2:06:25] when you die that's all for naught it's
[2:06:27] all gone you got
[2:06:29] nothing see he can't give you eternal
[2:06:32] life he can't give you
[2:06:33] a body not made with hands eternal in
[2:06:35] the heavens
[2:06:36] he can't do that only boaz can do that
[2:06:39] see this guy doesn't have enough funds
[2:06:40] to do that
[2:06:42] and i said i said he i said you know so
[2:06:45] he
[2:06:45] so the best he can do is kind of give
[2:06:47] you a little bit of an insulated life
[2:06:48] with wealth and riches and kind of
[2:06:50] insulate
[2:06:51] but it's still going to be true that a
[2:06:54] man that's born of a woman is a few days
[2:06:55] and full of trouble
[2:06:57] so all he can do is give you a little
[2:06:58] bit of insulation and then you're still
[2:07:00] then what then what are you going to
[2:07:01] have
[2:07:01] what are you going to have see i said
[2:07:04] but christ
[2:07:04] can give you a body not made with hands
[2:07:06] eternal in the heavens give you eternal
[2:07:08] life eternal joy eternal happiness
[2:07:10] and all and all he says is serve me in
[2:07:13] this life
[2:07:14] and you'll inherit the one coming amen
[2:07:17] and i said and that's the decision
[2:07:20] that ruth made and i said bella and i
[2:07:23] told her for the third time i said your
[2:07:25] ruth when you go out here today and you
[2:07:26] sit in the church and hear brother dale
[2:07:28] preaching
[2:07:29] i said you disremember your ruth in the
[2:07:31] bible
[2:07:32] and uh that took a smile that we
[2:07:35] couldn't get to go away
[2:07:36] so amen i want you to pray for her as we
[2:07:39] baptize and we're going to believe that
[2:07:41] the lord
[2:07:42] is beginning in her from her sincere
[2:07:45] heart
[2:07:46] the lord is beginning a whole new life
[2:07:49] amen matt i don't i'm not wired up so
[2:07:51] i'm going to take this one and i promise
[2:07:52] not to drop it in the tank
[2:07:58] amen praise the lord this one's working
[2:08:04] so it's uh keep me right here also so
[2:08:06] it's a it's a great privilege to me
[2:08:09] um i've known bella since the day she
[2:08:12] was born
[2:08:13] amen and dedicated to the lord and so
[2:08:17] it's fitting to see
[2:08:20] god bring this full circle amen
[2:08:23] praise the lord you're going to help me
[2:08:26] come on man
[2:08:27] i just wanted to oh you want to say
[2:08:29] something well just a little
[2:08:30] clarification
[2:08:31] i wish that was the case uh that bella
[2:08:34] chose to get baptized because
[2:08:36] i was given bible studies but you were
[2:08:38] given bible studies
[2:08:39] no no no the reason why i started those
[2:08:42] bible studies
[2:08:43] is because bella came to me wanting to
[2:08:45] be baptized
[2:08:46] nothing like that about that big you
[2:08:48] know so that's why that started
[2:08:50] wow praise the lord amen
[2:08:55] amen
[2:08:59] here here here's what i know that was
[2:09:02] then this is now and here we are
[2:09:06] amen so amen oh i see
[2:09:09] i still don't have a handle here to save
[2:09:12] my life in case i fall
[2:09:14] amen all right fella
[2:09:17] you come stand right here honey and um
[2:09:20] it should be a little bit warm i think
[2:09:21] brother john's going to put a little
[2:09:22] warm water in it for you step downtown
[2:09:24] is it okay yeah oh you're good yeah now
[2:09:27] so go another step in and i asked her
[2:09:32] how old she was when she i said you're
[2:09:33] like what nine or ten she's not 14.
[2:09:36] i said my goodness how is this even
[2:09:39] possible
[2:09:40] and i just guess time is flying and uh
[2:09:43] we must be having fun right
[2:09:46] and so we're happy here today i see a
[2:09:49] whole
[2:09:49] tribe of her cousins back there who
[2:09:51] wanted to be here
[2:09:53] today for this happy occasion and uh
[2:09:55] come on man you're going to come down
[2:09:56] here and help me
[2:09:57] yeah yeah yeah yeah
[2:10:01] yeah this is going to be awesome and um
[2:10:04] and so bella what we're going to do is
[2:10:06] we know
[2:10:07] in the bible that
[2:10:11] when when those men on the day
[2:10:14] of pentecost they were concerned
[2:10:17] that they had because they had crucified
[2:10:20] the christ and
[2:10:21] that's pretty concerning and they really
[2:10:24] had no remedy
[2:10:26] for it because they couldn't bring him
[2:10:28] back out of the tomb what they didn't
[2:10:29] know he was already out of the tomb and
[2:10:31] peter told them he says now listen
[2:10:34] what you did yeah you really did it but
[2:10:37] you did it by determinant counsel in
[2:10:38] other words there was preachers you were
[2:10:40] under misinterpreted theology they told
[2:10:42] you to kill him and you did
[2:10:44] but don't worry because the grave
[2:10:46] couldn't hold him
[2:10:47] that god has raised him up and has made
[2:10:50] that same jesus who you crucified both
[2:10:52] lord and christ
[2:10:53] so it's okay he he's still willing to
[2:10:56] love you and save you and
[2:10:59] now you're going to make me cry and dad
[2:11:01] crying when i was all crying villa
[2:11:03] and so so so when they said well
[2:11:07] well what what can we do peter said
[2:11:10] here's all you need to do
[2:11:12] repent and be baptized in the name of
[2:11:15] jesus christ
[2:11:17] for the remission of your sins and you
[2:11:19] will be filled with the holy ghost
[2:11:22] amen amen i better stop talking because
[2:11:25] we're all going to fall apart here
[2:11:27] so that's what we're here to do today
[2:11:29] bella we're going to put you
[2:11:30] this is just symbolism because remember
[2:11:32] jesus got buried
[2:11:34] and then he rose so we put you down we
[2:11:36] bring you straight out
[2:11:38] and we do it in his name because you
[2:11:40] know
[2:11:41] when a wife marries a husband she takes
[2:11:44] his name
[2:11:45] so you're becoming the bride of christ
[2:11:47] you're going to take the name of jesus
[2:11:49] in baptism you're identifying yourself
[2:11:51] with his death
[2:11:52] and burial and resurrection see
[2:11:56] amen so you'll come turn around and just
[2:11:59] sit down just sit down right there
[2:12:02] and you can just sit right down and all
[2:12:03] we're going to do is put you straight
[2:12:05] back and i'll take
[2:12:06] your head back here and dad can hold
[2:12:07] your arm you can put one hand over your
[2:12:09] nose if you want to
[2:12:10] uh so you'll be good and we'll put you
[2:12:12] all the way under
[2:12:14] and then we'll bring you all the way
[2:12:15] back up all right let's pray friends

[2:12:22] hearing the story
