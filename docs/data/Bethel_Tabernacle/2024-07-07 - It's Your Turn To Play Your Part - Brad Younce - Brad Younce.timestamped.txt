[28:44] quotes I know there's some people around

[28:50] quotes but when I go to those churches I
[28:53] read quotes I just don't say brother
[28:54] brandom said and it's
[28:56] okay so if you don't hear me say brother
[28:58] BR said you know I'm reading a quote you
[29:00] know you know the message Joshua 1
[29:02] chapter 1 now after the death of Moses
[29:05] the servant of the Lord it came to pass
[29:07] that the Lord spake unto Joshua the
[29:11] son brother I mean my Ser Moses my
[29:15] servant is dead now therefore arise and
[29:18] go over this Jordan thou and all this
[29:20] people unto the land which I do give
[29:22] them even to the children of Israel and
[29:25] every place that the soul of your foot
[29:27] shall th tread upon that have I given
[29:30] you as I said unto Moses verse 5 they
[29:34] there shall not any man be able to stand
[29:35] before thee all the days of thy life as
[29:38] I was with Moses so will I be with thee
[29:40] I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be
[29:44] strong and a good and of good courage
[29:46] For unto this people shalt thou divide
[29:48] inheritance in the land only be thou
[29:51] strong and very courageous that thou
[29:53] mayest observe to do according to the
[29:55] law which Moses my servant commanded
[29:58] thee turn not from it to the right hand
[30:00] or left that thou mayest Prosper
[30:02] wheresoever thou goest and then the book
[30:05] of law shall not depart out of thy mouth
[30:07] Thou shalt meditate therein day and
[30:09] night that thou May observe to do
[30:11] according to this written for Thou shalt
[30:14] make thy way prosperous then shalt have
[30:16] good success so God's telling Joshua
[30:20] three times be strong and a good courage
[30:23] cuz Joshua you've got something to do
[30:26] it's your turn he says if you do it
[30:28] going to
[30:29] prosper but Joshua command Joshua
[30:31] commanded the offer saying pass through

[32:50] would the bride of Christ have a
[32:52] Ministry before the Rapture sure that's

[33:01] the hour the bride of Christ she
[33:04] consists of Apostles prophets teachers
[33:07] evangelists and pastors is that
[33:10] right that's the bride of Christ she's
[33:13] got a Ministry and he calls it a great
[33:17] ministry it's the ministry of the hour

[33:25] a lot of that we've seen a lot of
[33:26] so-called Great Men R up and so many

[33:48] message it's not about him it's not
[33:50] about you it's not about me but it's
[33:53] about Jesus

[38:50] and say I and my father are
[38:54] one look Beyond this flesh look beyond
[38:57] what you're looking at and say I and my
[39:00] father are one but this message is Jesus
[39:03] Christ the ministry of Jesus Christ is
[39:06] in the body of the Bride the ministry of
[39:09] Christ himself impersonated among his
[39:13] people that definition impersonated
[39:16] means to assume or act the character of
[39:20] you're doing the very same things he did
[39:24] because know brother Bram said if I was
[39:26] John Dillinger the things that the acts
[39:28] that John Diller did I would do if I was
[39:31] bethoven I would play just like
[39:34] Beethoven if I was Jesus Christ I would
[39:37] do exactly what he did doing the very
[39:40] same things he did when he was here on
[39:43] Earth in his body the bride which is
[39:46] part of him doing the same
[39:49] things when Jesus was crucii brother
[39:52] said he took the spirit off of him and
[39:54] put his body in the grave his soul in
[39:57] Hell raised him up on the third day
[40:00] raised up his body and brought it up
[40:03] into Glory there sent the spirit back
[40:06] down and kept that body on the right
[40:09] hand get it sent the spirit back down to
[40:13] live in the church to make a church just
[40:16] as much with the Life of Christ that
[40:19] that was in the Resurrection The Two
[40:22] come together bride and bridegroom the
[40:25] church and Christ will be exactly alike
[40:28] with the same kind of
[40:31] ministry same kind of
[40:34] power wo Hallelujah same kind of spirit
[40:38] he raised up the body of Jesus Christ
[40:40] and set him on his right side his right
[40:43] hand and then poured his Spirit down on
[40:45] the church on the day of
[40:47] Pentecost the first Ministry and the
[40:51] last Ministry is the
[40:54] same the ministry of Jesus Christ chist
[40:57] on Earth has to be the same as the
[40:59] ministry he had or he can't come to
[41:02] it so if if our so-called message
[41:06] churches don't line up with the the
[41:08] message he ain't
[41:11] coming we know he ain't coming for these
[41:13] people out
[41:16] here it's just like the head to the
[41:19] feet the feet is not the
[41:22] head it looked kind of funny wouldn't it
[41:25] you trying to walk on your head
[41:28] get your body out of order how many here
[41:30] can walk on their head not their hands
[41:32] just their head no you're not made for
[41:34] that these things were made for
[41:39] that your head just controls your feet
[41:42] so how many gets up in the
[41:45] morning you're getting out of
[41:48] bed you go feet get over and you move
[41:53] your feet over all out leg stand up
[41:57] all right right foot Left Foot Right
[42:00] Foot left foot how many does
[42:04] that I hope nobody has to do that it's
[42:07] automatic your alarm clock goes off your
[42:09] M says I got to get up I got to go to
[42:11] the bathroom Wash Me brush my teeth you
[42:13] don't tell your feet to go it's
[42:16] automatic you'll see where I'm
[42:18] going the head picks the feet makes the
[42:22] feet tells it where to go it has to be
[42:26] because a woman at husband become one
[42:28] they become one and so does the bride of
[42:31] Christ become one the ministry of the
[42:34] Bride the ministry of Christ is the
[42:38] same have you got it Jesus Christ the
[42:42] same yesterday today and
[42:47] forever father son Holy Ghost he's the
[42:52] same God hallelujah no different it's
[42:55] not three different people Jesus the
[42:57] same as he was in the beginning Jesus
[42:59] was the same when he's on Earth Jesus is
[43:01] the same today walking among you living
[43:04] among
[43:05] you the same Ministry so what happened
[43:08] when Peter and John walked by the gate
[43:10] called Beautiful they seen this man
[43:12] laying
[43:13] there want
[43:16] money Peter poured like the rest of
[43:18] those
[43:18] preachers Silver and Gold Have I None
[43:21] but what I have I give to thee in the
[43:24] name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk
[43:27] how did how did Peter do that because
[43:31] Jesus says in John
[43:33] 14:11 believe me that I'm in the father
[43:37] and the father in me or else believe me
[43:39] just for the work's sake if you don't
[43:42] believe me just believe the works I
[43:43] perform for verily verily I say unto you
[43:47] he that believeth on me the works that I
[43:50] do shall he do
[43:52] also Greater Works than these shall he
[43:56] do because I go to to my father so how
[43:59] would we do the Greater Works cuz Jesus
[44:02] says down in verse 20 at that day ye
[44:05] shall know that I'm in the
[44:08] father and ye are in me and I am in you
[44:13] that's how you could know you can walk
[44:15] up and say you say to this mountain be
[44:17] thou moved ask anything in my name and I
[44:21] will do
[44:22] it that's what Peter said when he walked
[44:24] up there in the name of Jesus Christ
[44:27] rise up and
[44:30] walk whatsoever you ask in my
[44:33] name he says in my name you shall cast
[44:36] out
[44:37] devils not I
[44:40] will Jesus said in my name I will cast
[44:42] out the Devils he says no you will he
[44:45] says you will cast out Devils I'm
[44:47] talking about playing our part you will
[44:50] cast out Devils you'll do the Greater
[44:52] Works you can say to this mountain if
[44:55] you say to this mountain so God is
[44:57] saying you go ahead and speak it it's me
[45:01] saying
[45:04] it
[45:06] Hallelujah now I believe did something
[45:09] that Jesus didn't
[45:12] do you know they laid the sick in the
[45:16] streets and just the shadow of Peter
[45:18] overshadowed them and they were
[45:22] healed we should be able to do the same
[45:25] thing I could walk right by you this
[45:28] morning if you're sick just my shadow
[45:31] should be able to heal you not
[45:36] me the message inside of
[45:39] me Hallelujah the ministry of the Bride
[45:43] will do what he
[45:45] did what is brother says what is the
[45:48] true Church's Ministry the ministry at
[45:50] that church will be the ministry of the
[45:52] sun because it's reflecting the same sun
[45:55] power not Su n but s o n the same
[46:00] sunlight that the world will know when
[46:02] the Sun rises what it will look
[46:09] like that's why John
[46:11] says he's got to increase so I'm going
[46:14] to decrease both of them could stay on
[46:17] the earth at the same
[46:18] time hold on when brother Bram was here
[46:22] a lot of people kept brother Bram up
[46:24] here with
[46:24] Christ both of them couldn't be here at
[46:27] the same time brother Bram says I've got
[46:29] to
[46:30] decrease but a lot of us has left
[46:32] brother brandham up here and has brought
[46:34] God
[46:36] down we left brother brandom as our
[46:41] God he's got a decrease so that Christ
[46:45] in us can increase that we can do the
[46:48] Greater
[46:51] Works the voice that spoke people don't
[46:54] get it brother bram's God so when the
[46:57] voice spoke at the river when he was
[47:00] baptized in
[47:01] that M went blank baptizing that person
[47:04] in the voice of God spoke and says as
[47:06] John the Baptist will sent the forun my
[47:08] first coming you will be sent the forun
[47:10] my second coming if those people had any
[47:12] Revelation they'll say hold on what
[47:14] happened to
[47:16] John as soon as John baptized Jesus and
[47:19] the spirit of God ascended on Jesus like
[47:21] a dove he went to the
[47:23] Wilderness you didn't hear no more of
[47:25] John except
[47:27] are you the one or should we look for
[47:31] another that's when he said I've got a
[47:34] decrease he recognized it brother
[47:36] brandom recognized he's got to decrease
[47:38] because Joshua's got to take
[47:43] over we have a part to play in this
[47:45] brother brandom's done his part and he
[47:48] done it
[47:50] well we need to do ours it's our turn we
[47:53] need to do our part
[47:55] well we're we're not waiting on another
[47:57] man to come and pick this thing up where
[48:00] brother bam left
[48:01] off they said but but he's got to come
[48:04] back he wants to preach the trail of the
[48:06] serpent he even had notes ready to do it
[48:08] he was headed back to Jeffersonville to
[48:10] preach the trail of the
[48:11] serpent anybody that knows the message
[48:14] knows he's already preached the trail of
[48:16] the
[48:17] serpent he started with a with a serpent
[48:20] up in heaven went all way down through
[48:22] the Bible through Jesus Christ when
[48:24] Jesus Christ stomped on his head into
[48:26] the end of the book of Revelation where
[48:27] he's destroyed there's his Trail so we
[48:29] don't need brother R to come back and
[48:30] preach that to
[48:33] us
[48:37] wow he says these young men will take
[48:40] this message on will take this bride
[48:42] onto a
[48:43] Rapture that light that was with brother
[48:45] brandham is that light that's with us
[48:48] today you know they took the picture
[48:50] that Pillar of Fire it's it's in this
[48:52] building this morning
[49:00] two men could be on the earth at the
[49:01] same time what happened to Elijah and
[49:04] Elisha Elijah know he was fixing to die
[49:07] he says my time to
[49:09] go so he went around saying goodbyes to
[49:12] all the people in the countryside is
[49:13] telling Elisha you stay here you stay
[49:16] here and you take care of these people
[49:18] they know you're next in line you're
[49:20] second in command you take over Elisha
[49:23] says no where you go I'll go
[49:27] where you dwell I'll dwell your people
[49:29] will be my people your God will be my
[49:30] God has the he said as the Lord God
[49:32] liveth I'll not leave thee so he gets
[49:35] across the river Jordan and sees Elijah
[49:37] put his mantle down the we know the
[49:39] story The Water opened up they walked
[49:41] across Elijah says what do you want from
[49:45] me Elisha says I want a double portion
[49:48] of your
[49:52] spirit could we say that Lord give me a
[49:55] double portion of your spirit because
[49:57] you promise the Greater Works we'll
[50:01] do Hallelujah here come a fire Chariot
[50:06] Out of Heaven sweep down and picked
[50:08] Elijah up Elisha says I see
[50:12] you then drops down that
[50:16] mantle Elisha goes takes off his old
[50:18] code of his
[50:20] religion lets it fall to the ground and
[50:22] picks up that
[50:23] mantle and walks up to the River Jordan
[50:27] he didn't walk up to the River Jordan
[50:29] brother Matthew and
[50:30] says no I asked for double
[50:34] portion can I really
[50:37] speak and see somebody healed can I
[50:40] really speak and see my son and daughter
[50:44] saved he didn't do that it was automatic
[50:47] to Elisha he walks right up there and
[50:49] takes that mantle off and says where is
[50:51] the god of Elisha and smoked the river
[50:53] that opened up and there he went walking
[50:55] out on dry land
[50:59] and you got the
[51:01] mantle we've got the
[51:03] mantle we can do Greater Works it's our
[51:07] turn to do our
[51:10] part the torch has been passed to
[51:14] us you know this is the time of the
[51:17] Olympics coming up later on this month
[51:20] and what they do a couple of months
[51:21] before they light this torch and so
[51:24] they'll go to Olympia in Greece
[51:27] that's the original place where the the
[51:29] Olympics started they I I what I've read
[51:32] they keep that fire burning all the
[51:35] time so what they do they take this
[51:37] torch and they light it and then they
[51:40] carry it around and go to the host
[51:42] country like this time it's France and
[51:45] they'll take it to every town they'll go
[51:47] up through mountains up through
[51:49] valleys until they'll get to where the
[51:51] games are actually going to take
[51:54] place we got a great torch
[51:58] that was lit before the foundation of
[51:59] the world and it's passed on down
[52:02] through time it's come out through Adam
[52:04] it went through Abel went through Seth
[52:06] it went through Noah it went through
[52:08] Moses it went through David through
[52:10] Solomon through Jesus Through Paul
[52:12] through
[52:13] Peter through all the church ages Martin
[52:16] Luther Wesley up through brother
[52:18] brandham when the torch got the brother
[52:20] branon when he went off the scene he
[52:21] handed to somebody we're carrying the
[52:24] torch
[52:27] that light has been passed to us it's
[52:29] our time it's our
[52:32] turn the Bible says AR Rise and Shine
[52:34] for thy light has
[52:36] come and the glory of the Lord is risen
[52:39] upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall
[52:42] cover the Earth and gross Darkness the
[52:46] people but the Lord shall rise upon thee
[52:49] and the glory shall be seen upon
[52:52] thee what happens when that light has
[52:54] come I like this scripture this is for
[52:57] us moms and
[52:58] dads lift up thine eyes round about and
[53:01] see all they gather themselves they come
[53:04] to thee thy sons and thy
[53:08] daughters shall be back by thy side
[53:12] Hallelujah R says oh you morning Stars
[53:15] you rise and shine it's your time to
[53:17] shine the coming of the Lord is at hand
[53:21] reflecting the presence reflecting the
[53:23] oncoming
[53:25] son give given the same signs Jesus said
[53:28] it was as it was in the days of
[53:31] Sodom for real it'll be the same thing
[53:33] in the coming of the son of man the same
[53:36] Ministry that the sun went
[53:39] down is the same light that went down is
[53:42] coming again in resurrection power and
[53:44] The Morning Star is reflecting that
[53:48] light then God's light will be reflected
[53:52] in his church more powerful than ever
[53:58] just before the coming of the Lord Jesus
[54:01] Christ that coming is right at hand this
[54:04] is going to be a powerful light brother
[54:05] says we're living in the last days it's
[54:08] a big Pillar of Fire what Pillar of Fire
[54:11] the one that led the children of Israel
[54:12] from the Wilderness everything's got a
[54:14] nature it'll bear its nature in that
[54:18] person now when this Pillar of Fire was
[54:21] made flesh and dwelt Among Us God was
[54:24] made flesh in his son Christ Jesus we
[54:28] are all aware that he was
[54:33] God are do
[54:35] we there's no two God people in here is
[54:41] there notice when he was here on Earth
[54:43] look at the ministry he
[54:45] had when he went around and you mean to
[54:48] tell he so you mean to tell me you're
[54:50] with
[54:51] Abraham you're only 50 years old well
[54:55] before Abraham was I am
[54:59] The Works he
[55:00] did a little while the world won't see
[55:02] me no more but you shall see
[55:05] me for I'll be with you even in
[55:10] you skipping a little bit don't get
[55:14] scared the world the church the
[55:17] so-called Church the outside world they
[55:19] won't see it how about this light
[55:22] there's nothing to it don't believe that
[55:25] kind of stuff they'll say
[55:27] there's no such thing as a baptism of
[55:28] the Holy Ghost there's no such thing as
[55:30] speaking in tongues no such things as
[55:32] gifts of Prophecy all these are Divine
[55:35] healings that's
[55:36] nonsense but God promised in the last
[55:39] days that he'll pour out both former and
[55:43] latter rain at the same time upon his
[55:47] church the days of the prophets the days
[55:49] of the Apostles he'd pour out both
[55:52] former and latter Reigns in the last
[55:54] days
[55:56] and we've got it the Lord is here
[55:59] showing just exactly what Jesus says
[56:02] would take place before his coming in
[56:05] the last days these things take place we
[56:08] are aware of that we're living in that
[56:10] hour of the approaching of the Lord
[56:12] we'll see his signs everywhere this
[56:15] voice of God is in
[56:17] you cuz brother Bram said the final
[56:21] voice will be in the
[56:24] bride so whatever you you say will take
[56:27] place what happened when brother bran
[56:29] was was was in that room with Haddie
[56:30] Wright and brother bran was speaking he
[56:34] was telling the story about the Three
[56:38] Squirrels he was telling the story about
[56:40] the three how he just spoke them and
[56:42] here they
[56:43] come people thought he was crazy but
[56:46] that little sister hadie R spoke up and
[56:49] said that's nothing but the
[56:52] truth and when she said that we know she
[56:55] said the right thing brother Bram spoke
[56:58] to her and God cuz God said tell her to
[57:00] speak whatever she
[57:04] wants brother Bram had done his part he
[57:06] told the story her faith was so great
[57:09] that ain't nothing but the
[57:11] truth it was her turn it was her turn to
[57:14] use the spoken
[57:16] word what did she do she could ask for
[57:20] anything she could ask for her mom and
[57:23] dad to be young again she could ask for
[57:25] her sister to be here
[57:26] she could have asked for a million
[57:29] dollars but she asked for the most
[57:31] important thing so she spoke that my
[57:34] sons will have eternal
[57:37] life that spirit of God dropped down
[57:39] into that
[57:41] room I like to been
[57:45] there them two boys over the corner
[57:47] making fun of
[57:49] everything all all of a sudden the
[57:52] spirit of God drop down on
[57:54] them they giving their heart to Jesus
[57:57] Christ you may say yeah but they're not
[57:58] living for the Lord right now it don't
[58:02] matter because God gave them eternal
[58:04] life right
[58:08] there had he right used her part she was
[58:13] her turn say will it work for him it
[58:16] ought to worked for
[58:18] me if it work for brother brandom and
[58:21] hady right it'll work for you whatever
[58:24] you have need of speak to this mountain
[58:27] and it will
[58:31] move the bride's Ministry is not going
[58:33] to be some dead
[58:34] religion it's going to be
[58:37] something that has life to
[58:42] it but we got to play our
[58:45] part It's like a
[58:48] symphony everybody has a part to play
[58:52] the last time I heard a symphony
[58:54] preached on
[58:56] talk about a part to play I was up in
[58:58] North Carolina a few years ago and
[58:59] brother Ron Spencer was preaching and he
[59:02] was preaching on the
[59:03] symphony and we were sitting right here
[59:06] in the front row very front row right in
[59:07] front of him and he had preached a good
[59:11] 20 minutes or more not even look he
[59:14] didn't even look at me he was just
[59:16] preaching away on the symphony when it's
[59:19] time to play you part when it's time to
[59:20] do you you'll get what I'm meaning here
[59:23] in a minute all of a sudden he was on
[59:25] this side I was sitting probably where
[59:26] this sister in the pink dress is and I
[59:29] walked and he walked he said I'm going
[59:30] to stop right here just for a
[59:32] minute but at that time I was sitting
[59:34] here praying about preaching didn't want
[59:38] to I was wondering is this really right
[59:40] I'm so old I'm too old for
[59:42] this people always remind me Moses
[59:44] didn't start till he was
[59:47] 80 but Ron Spencer walked on the
[59:49] platform I'm I'm going to stop my
[59:50] thought right now and he point his
[59:52] finger right at my face he said when
[59:55] it's your turn You'll Play Your
[59:58] Part he turns around and kept preaching
[1:00:01] back where he left off and never did
[1:00:02] look at me the rest of the
[1:00:04] service I kind of looked over it Sarah
[1:00:08] said did he do just did he just do what
[1:00:09] I thought he
[1:00:11] did he did so when it's my turn I'm
[1:00:15] going to play my part so I'm going to
[1:00:17] point my finger at each one of you all
[1:00:18] this
[1:00:19] morning when it's your turn You'll Play
[1:00:21] Your Part some of you boys might be
[1:00:24] preachers

[1:00:32] spot somebody might be a pastor this
[1:00:34] church one
[1:00:35] day when it's your turn You'll Play Your

[1:00:40] you sisters
[1:00:42] too everybody has a part to play you
[1:00:45] might you might feel in your heart this
[1:00:46] morning I want to be a Sunday school
[1:00:49] teacher oh by the way we need
[1:00:54] one that was brother Jason didn't tell
[1:00:56] me to say
[1:00:57] that but we must play our part It's like
[1:01:00] a symphony everybody has a part to play
[1:01:03] in this drama a symphony tells a story
[1:01:07] in
[1:01:08] music all different types of instruments
[1:01:10] are there in this Orchestra it's kind of
[1:01:14] funny this morning I sent a text to
[1:01:17] musicians about
[1:01:19] something and then I asked brother John
[1:01:21] if he has a violin and of course I got
[1:01:24] corrected it's not a violin it's a
[1:01:27] viola a viola sorry see I still don't
[1:01:30] know what it
[1:01:32] is so evident it's different than the
[1:01:36] violin well I got looking later I said
[1:01:38] my phone's going crazy what's going on
[1:01:40] and then brother Brad camell puts what a
[1:01:42] what it is and did a whole
[1:01:45] text I didn't have time to read it all
[1:01:47] but I got in in parts and I kept seeing
[1:01:51] different violins in an
[1:01:53] orchestra like oh I better I close that
[1:01:56] cuz they're getting over on what I'm
[1:01:57] going to do this
[1:01:58] morning but there's different kinds of
[1:02:01] instruments in this thing there's a
[1:02:04] violin you wonder why these brothers
[1:02:06] come in here
[1:02:07] sisters Micah goes at this chair Steve
[1:02:10] will go to this
[1:02:12] one brother Aaron almost forgot your
[1:02:14] name brother
[1:02:16] Chris sister Ruth brother Andrew why do
[1:02:19] they go to them
[1:02:22] instruments that's what they're that's
[1:02:24] what they're called to play some of them
[1:02:26] can play all of
[1:02:29] them but I don't think you could take
[1:02:31] Micah say hey
[1:02:33] Micah where's
[1:02:36] Micah go over and play me Amazing
[1:02:40] Grace what if they come in here they all
[1:02:42] on different
[1:02:43] instruments they're out of order they're
[1:02:46] not in their part that they sound so
[1:02:47] good don't they I think we have the best
[1:02:52] musicians second I better go ahead and
[1:02:54] say it is Brother Don
[1:02:59] church but they all have a part to play
[1:03:06] right you should have preached I tried
[1:03:08] to get you
[1:03:09] to in this syy of God we have
[1:03:14] Apostles prophets preachers teachers
[1:03:18] pastors husbands
[1:03:22] wives get my point we have all these
[1:03:25] people in this great big Symphony Of
[1:03:27] God there's one you know in the
[1:03:30] symphony people will come in they ain't
[1:03:32] got a clue what's going on back here
[1:03:35] they don't have a
[1:03:37] clue have you ever been to a symphony
[1:03:39] how many been to a
[1:03:40] symphony I've never been to
[1:03:43] one but don't they right before they
[1:03:45] start playing everybody's playing
[1:03:47] something totally different it sounds
[1:03:50] like a mess don't it you're like what in
[1:03:52] the world is going
[1:03:54] on I've paid 80 bucks to come in here
[1:03:57] and watch the list these people play and
[1:03:59] they sound
[1:04:00] awful and all of a sudden the the
[1:04:03] conductor walks up there grabs a little
[1:04:06] stick Taps it silence and then he starts
[1:04:11] doing this and here comes the little
[1:04:12] violins they come playing in beautiful
[1:04:18] sound and then the V The Villa whever
[1:04:21] you say it comes in next and here comes
[1:04:23] the percussions and and and well it's
[1:04:24] like our church you come in here all
[1:04:27] these guys right here are waiting on
[1:04:28] this piano player to start playing and
[1:04:31] they're over hurry up brother
[1:04:34] Andrew he's over getting everything
[1:04:37] perfect fixing the screen getting the
[1:04:40] sound
[1:04:41] right that's back there and Pops his
[1:04:43] finger looks back at us and
[1:04:45] nods it's his time and he starts
[1:04:50] playing
[1:04:54] beautiful brother Micah doesn't start
[1:04:58] first the drums doesn't start
[1:05:01] first but when brother Andrew starts
[1:05:04] playing then here comes all these
[1:05:05] instruments in and makes a beautiful
[1:05:09] sound you see what point I'm getting
[1:05:12] at we all have a part to play we've got
[1:05:15] to play our own
[1:05:18] part if you're a
[1:05:20] housewife God didn't call you to be a
[1:05:22] preacher
[1:05:26] even though I've heard some women that
[1:05:27] can
[1:05:28] preach my wife was playing me somebody
[1:05:30] not too long ago and this woman was
[1:05:32] abolutely tearing it
[1:05:34] up I said Lord I wish I could preach
[1:05:36] like
[1:05:40] that so if your housewife you can't be a
[1:05:43] preacher if you're a trustee you can't
[1:05:45] be a deacon if you're a deacon you can't
[1:05:48] be a trustee if you're a preacher you
[1:05:50] can't be a deacon I would rather be a
[1:05:54] deacon but you got every one of us has
[1:05:56] our part to play we can't do our own
[1:06:00] thing it's like a well old machine you
[1:06:02] know we are the body of
[1:06:05] Christ you know it's kind of
[1:06:07] funny not really funny but last Friday
[1:06:09] we was up at Ron's and I was before
[1:06:11] service I was
[1:06:12] praying cuz I had a I had a a feeling
[1:06:15] that I'd be here this
[1:06:16] morning I was supposed to been in
[1:06:18] Columbia with brother
[1:06:21] Jason but I had a feeling I was going to
[1:06:22] be here this morning I said' Lord what
[1:06:23] do you want me to preach on
[1:06:26] and it come across playing your
[1:06:30] part the bride's got a
[1:06:32] Ministry it's your turn and so all all
[1:06:36] the things that goes with it had a lot
[1:06:37] of stuff wrote
[1:06:38] down brother M gets up there and
[1:06:41] preaches and he comes out his title is
[1:06:44] passing the Baton where he talks it left
[1:06:47] Elijah and went to Elisha that this
[1:06:50] message has left brother brandham has
[1:06:51] come to the bride I'm like what in the
[1:06:54] world
[1:06:57] so I just kind of pushed off the side
[1:06:58] and I kind of text I thought it would
[1:06:59] get the next morning I was up looking at
[1:07:01] a few things I text Brother mat that but
[1:07:04] come in here Wednesday night and the
[1:07:07] weapon was
[1:07:09] preaching and I'm sitting here looking
[1:07:10] at him like dude you got to be
[1:07:13] quiet cuz he started hitting on the body
[1:07:15] of Christ we're one
[1:07:17] body we're one God one people so we're
[1:07:21] all a body of Christ we're part of this
[1:07:22] body and he just kep like quit
[1:07:29] we we're a member
[1:07:31] many body of Jesus Christ we all have a
[1:07:34] different
[1:07:36] part we'll skip here I wna go down to uh
[1:07:39] 1 Corinthians 12:12 for as the body is
[1:07:42] one and hath many members all the
[1:07:45] members of that one body being many are
[1:07:48] one
[1:07:49] body also in
[1:07:52] Christ for by one Spirit are we all
[1:07:54] baptized into one body whether we be
[1:07:57] Jews or Gentiles it don't matter who you
[1:07:59] are whether we be Bond or free all have
[1:08:02] been made to drink into one spirit for
[1:08:06] the body is not one member but
[1:08:11] many if the foot shall say I don't want
[1:08:15] to be a foot I want to be the
[1:08:18] hand you look kind of
[1:08:21] funny your feet up here and your hands
[1:08:24] down here
[1:08:31] what if the foot shall say because I'm
[1:08:32] not the hand I'm not the body bless God
[1:08:36] if I can't preach I ain't going to be
[1:08:42] nothing and if the ear shall say because
[1:08:45] I'm not the eye I'm not of the
[1:08:48] body is it therefore not of the
[1:08:52] body is it the eye part of the body the
[1:08:54] ear part of the
[1:08:57] body if the whole body were an i boy
[1:09:00] that would look funny wouldn't it walk
[1:09:02] around just one big eyeball walking
[1:09:04] around
[1:09:07] everywhere eyeballs getting hungry well
[1:09:09] how you going to
[1:09:15] eat if the whole body were an eye were
[1:09:18] were the
[1:09:19] hearing if the hole were a hearing
[1:09:21] where's a
[1:09:22] smelling but now hath God set the
[1:09:25] remembers every one of them in the body
[1:09:28] as it pleased
[1:09:30] him I don't want to be a preacher but it
[1:09:33] pleased God to place me
[1:09:35] here you my I don't want to come up here
[1:09:38] and sing songs but God placed you
[1:09:44] here why because it pleased
[1:09:48] him I want to please
[1:09:51] him sometimes it's
[1:09:53] hard and if they were all one member
[1:09:57] then what were the
[1:09:59] body but now are they many
[1:10:02] members yet one body and the ey cannot
[1:10:06] say into the hand I have no need of thee
[1:10:09] nor the head to the feet I have no need
[1:10:10] of thee they the head needs the feet the
[1:10:13] feet needs the head the hands need the
[1:10:15] mouth or the mouth needs the hand
[1:10:17] whatever you know what I'm
[1:10:22] saying and the I cannot say into the
[1:10:25] hand I have no need of thee nor again
[1:10:27] the head to the feet I have no need of
[1:10:29] thee nay much more than those members of
[1:10:31] the body which seem to be more feeble as
[1:10:33] necessary and those members of the body
[1:10:37] which we think to be less
[1:10:39] honorable upon these we bestow more
[1:10:42] abundant honor and aely parts or more
[1:10:44] abundant
[1:10:48] comess verse 26 and whether one member
[1:10:51] suffer we all suffer and one member be
[1:10:54] honored all of us rejoice with it now ye
[1:10:58] are the body of Christ and members in
[1:11:04] particular so no matter what we say or
[1:11:06] do we can't help it we're a
[1:11:11] member it's your turn it's time to play
[1:11:14] your
[1:11:17] part oh no I forgot to set my
[1:11:22] timer we are like a well oiled
[1:11:27] machine I'm part of a body so we just
[1:11:30] work

[1:11:33] you go turn your key in your car your
[1:11:35] motor is just doing everything you don't
[1:11:36] know what it's doing but it's all
[1:11:37] working together it's all work you just
[1:11:40] get in putting Drive you're down the
[1:11:41] road it's all everything working
[1:11:43] together that's what a body does my body
[1:11:46] right now is working together my head is
[1:11:48] not even have to tell my feet what to do
[1:11:50] it's doing it
[1:11:51] anyway it's automatic it's like when the
[1:11:54] preacher is up here preaching it's
[1:11:55] automatic
[1:11:59] amen some we don't have to sit up here
[1:12:02] and say get us pumped up Prime hey let's

[1:12:21] turn I'm a part of little of of of Jesus
[1:12:24] Christ
[1:12:26] I might be the little toe but I'm a part
[1:12:29] of him I have a
[1:12:31] purpose if I'm just there for
[1:12:34] balance that's all I want to
[1:12:37] be I don't want to be I don't want to be
[1:12:39] the big toe I don't want to be the
[1:12:43] head Lord just let me be the little toe
[1:12:45] in your body and do what you want me to
[1:12:51] be we're back in this great drama
[1:12:55] in a symphony only a composer the
[1:12:58] director and these people behind here
[1:13:00] knows what's going
[1:13:02] on they know what's in the Sheep
[1:13:05] music the people in the atist has no
[1:13:08] clue but when they start when they start
[1:13:10] the
[1:13:12] music a symphony tells a story and if
[1:13:15] you know the story you know what they're
[1:13:17] doing like brown would say like that
[1:13:20] Russian thing they Peter and the Wolf
[1:13:23] that they know exactly what's going on
[1:13:25] by the beating of the
[1:13:27] drums by the rise and fall of
[1:13:33] Music These instruments here on this
[1:13:35] platform they all sound
[1:13:37] good but you just can't play the bass by
[1:13:41] itself brother Aaron's
[1:13:43] good probably the
[1:13:50] best sorry
[1:13:53] y'all but a base can't play by itself
[1:13:56] it's got to have something
[1:13:58] else a preacher can't get up here and
[1:14:00] preach by itself he's got to have
[1:14:02] somebody
[1:14:03] else this building's empty I could be up
[1:14:06] here
[1:14:10] preaching by themselves this thing does
[1:14:13] not sound good that that drum that bass
[1:14:17] that manin needs that
[1:14:21] piano right I know you say oh but that
[1:14:24] piano get could play by
[1:14:26] itself that's not my
[1:14:30] point we'll use that
[1:14:33] later but add the piano in add the organ
[1:14:36] into you got a great sound coming forth
[1:14:40] they get back here in this room before
[1:14:41] service they practice and the song Lead
[1:14:43] said this is my song and they're
[1:14:45] practicing they're getting it down
[1:14:46] they've got practice so when it come out
[1:14:48] here it's
[1:14:51] automatic brother Ken turn around and
[1:14:53] say I'm going to sing this song b
[1:14:55] already know what key that's
[1:14:56] in unless you're too old you can't
[1:14:58] remember he yet to be
[1:15:00] told but they automatically know what
[1:15:03] key it's
[1:15:06] in this scripture is God's Symphony only
[1:15:10] the composer knows what it really means
[1:15:13] and reveals it to those who are
[1:15:16] listening are you listening who are
[1:15:19] interested in
[1:15:21] knowing wow you got to be interested in
[1:15:23] knowing this know knowing what the drama
[1:15:26] is but you have to know about a symphony
[1:15:29] first it's not just something you see
[1:15:32] it's the changing it's the junction the
[1:15:35] Junctions of the word of the
[1:15:37] music sometimes it's going that way for
[1:15:39] a while this way for a while a certain
[1:15:42] beat and after a while it changes around
[1:15:45] to you who would understand it and don't
[1:15:48] know nothing about it and you're not
[1:15:49] even interested in it it's just a bunch
[1:15:51] of Racket it's a fuss
[1:15:55] but to those who knows about it they're
[1:15:57] watching for it they know what's coming
[1:16:00] if you're in this drama are you watching
[1:16:03] for the next part the beating of the
[1:16:06] music you hear it getting louder and
[1:16:08] louder something's fixing to happen you
[1:16:10] got a man standing back here with these
[1:16:12] two big symbols he only has one part to
[1:16:15] play and the music is building up and
[1:16:18] building up and and all a sudden the
[1:16:20] director points at him and he clashes it
[1:16:23] and Martin Luther comes out says the
[1:16:24] just shall live by
[1:16:27] faith and he backs
[1:16:31] off and he composure calms everybody
[1:16:33] down it starts directing
[1:16:36] again the music starts playing all of a
[1:16:39] sudden it starts rising up again it
[1:16:41] might took a hundred years or more it
[1:16:42] starts rising up all of a sudden it
[1:16:45] starts getting faster and faster
[1:16:46] director points at the symbols again and
[1:16:48] he clashes and here comes Wesley the
[1:16:51] great big drama of God unfolding in his
[1:16:55] church all the way down through the
[1:16:57] church ages everybody had their part to
[1:16:59] play when it come down the music fading
[1:17:03] again calming
[1:17:05] down here comes the buildup and we're
[1:17:08] ready cuz we
[1:17:09] know something's fixing to happen
[1:17:11] because we recognize the
[1:17:14] music we know what's fixing to happen
[1:17:17] Luther didn't know what was fixing to
[1:17:18] happened when the music started getting
[1:17:20] louder Wesley didn't know what happened
[1:17:23] Pentecost didn't know what happened but
[1:17:25] we know what's getting ready to happen
[1:17:27] the music is building it's building it's
[1:17:29] getting faster rising up you know how it
[1:17:32] is sometimes these guys get so anointed
[1:17:35] you feel the spirit just rising up in
[1:17:37] here you feel the anointing getting
[1:17:39] ready to drop
[1:17:41] down something's fixing to
[1:17:44] happen it ain't about these brothers
[1:17:46] it's about what's anointing is on them
[1:17:49] because anointing fixed to come out here
[1:17:51] and preach the
[1:17:53] gospel I'm feeling
[1:17:59] good we're waiting for that one
[1:18:02] person that might be your
[1:18:05] job you've heard of all these people are
[1:18:07] one hit
[1:18:09] wonders they do one song and you don't
[1:18:12] hear nothing from them you call them one
[1:18:13] hit
[1:18:14] wonders that's what you might
[1:18:16] be just a one hit wonder that's what I
[1:18:20] want to be Lord if you could just use me
[1:18:22] for one thing I played my
[1:18:26] part but I want to be willing to play my
[1:18:29] part BR says so we had these times of
[1:18:33] Symphonies of God's word that the whole
[1:18:35] drama
[1:18:36] changes you who are interested are
[1:18:38] listening for that change you know it's
[1:18:40] getting close you hear the way the drums
[1:18:42] are
[1:18:46] beating something's getting ready to
[1:18:48] happen you know this is a change it's
[1:18:51] going to break out into burst into a few
[1:18:53] minutes
[1:18:55] I like the way he said that it's going
[1:18:56] to break out into a burst in a few
[1:18:58] minutes you're watching for it you can
[1:19:00] tell the way the drums are timing oh God
[1:19:04] if you could hear the drums of the
[1:19:05] Finish now if you could hear the echo of
[1:19:07] the music of the Heavenly word singing
[1:19:10] itself out it shall come to pass in the
[1:19:12] last days the Symphony of God's Great
[1:19:15] drama that he's played it changes him
[1:19:18] his Symphony at the junction the
[1:19:20] composer and those who are interested
[1:19:22] are listening for the change that's what
[1:19:24] all this stuff is to us we're listening
[1:19:27] we're
[1:19:29] watching every time he appears something
[1:19:32] happens we see the time getting close we
[1:19:35] see back Yonder not long ago when the
[1:19:37] church age were being drawn out we were
[1:19:39] listening we seen it was right with the
[1:19:41] word beating with the word after a while
[1:19:44] what happened here he come himself and
[1:19:46] vindicate
[1:19:52] it one time he said about the third
[1:19:56] pull how it would come by this way
[1:19:59] knowing by then by knowing the heart and
[1:20:01] then by the spoken word Jesus says
[1:20:03] greater things than this shall you do
[1:20:05] because I go to the
[1:20:08] father when we hear the symphony beating
[1:20:10] and
[1:20:11] changing fixing the change it's a
[1:20:14] junction of
[1:20:16] time we notice has he begin to beat we
[1:20:19] seen the works that I
[1:20:21] do I've said that a lot this morning the
[1:20:24] works that I do which you shall do also
[1:20:26] greater shall you do greater he promised
[1:20:29] we wondered how that could
[1:20:31] be but did you notice when he first
[1:20:33] performed his first
[1:20:35] miracle he took water and turned it to
[1:20:39] Wine he took water which potentially
[1:20:42] someday might have been
[1:20:45] wine but it was water first and when he
[1:20:48] had fed 5,000 what did he do he took
[1:20:51] something that had been been like water
[1:20:53] he took a fish that was once swam and
[1:20:56] was bornn from an egg he broke it and
[1:20:58] another fish growed into the
[1:21:00] creation that was the original creation
[1:21:03] he took bread that was once wheat which
[1:21:05] was a seed become bread he spoke from
[1:21:07] his bread and the creation only
[1:21:09] multiplied it but in the woods back
[1:21:12] Yonder it were was
[1:21:15] nothing there to make a squirrel with
[1:21:17] all I said was let there be and there it
[1:21:21] was the same Jesus Christ said the
[1:21:24] Greater Works shall you
[1:21:27] do because he said we've got enough
[1:21:29] power in us to go speak another world
[1:21:32] into existence and go live on
[1:21:38] it the world don't understand this drama
[1:21:42] they don't understand it because it's a
[1:21:43] bunch of
[1:21:47] nonsense he says because they're not
[1:21:49] Methodist the methods don't understand
[1:21:50] it because they're not Baptist the
[1:21:52] Baptist don't understand it because it's
[1:21:54] not C cic the Catholic don't understand
[1:21:56] it it's just because it's not what they
[1:21:57] believe in the Pentecostals don't
[1:22:00] believe it because they don't understand
[1:22:01] it those who wait on the Lord those who
[1:22:04] are looking are you looking and
[1:22:06] listening you got your spiritual ears
[1:22:09] open this morning and you hear the r the
[1:22:12] the rising of the drama it's building
[1:22:15] the composer knows the end from the
[1:22:17] beginning he knows all about it that's
[1:22:20] the reason he could write it there
[1:22:23] correctly now you must begin with him
[1:22:27] you must begin with him if you want to
[1:22:30] hear a symphony you begin with
[1:22:35] him like the music out of symphony
[1:22:37] you'll listen you know what it says it's
[1:22:39] going to be about what the symphony is
[1:22:41] then you begin to listen at the
[1:22:44] music I've heard a lot of
[1:22:46] Racket I've been in churches well the
[1:22:49] the
[1:22:51] musicians is awful
[1:22:56] they're not on
[1:22:57] key everybody is doing their own thing
[1:23:00] on the
[1:23:03] platform we was in church not too long
[1:23:05] ago it was that
[1:23:08] way the poor song
[1:23:10] leader he was having a fit brother Ken
[1:23:14] you would have
[1:23:17] died You' have turned around and walked
[1:23:20] off kind of hard to sing to somebody
[1:23:22] who's doing their own thing
[1:23:25] Bunch
[1:23:29] racket about
[1:23:33] finished you know what it is you know
[1:23:36] what it's about it's where certain
[1:23:37] certain things take place it's going to
[1:23:40] change it's the beat of the bass it's
[1:23:42] the sounding of the trumpets it's the
[1:23:44] beat on the drums it's the whole thing
[1:23:46] together in
[1:23:48] Rhythm it makes the drama till you could
[1:23:51] close your eyes and live it
[1:23:55] I'm sure brother Andrew if you're
[1:23:56] listening to something like that you
[1:23:57] will just close your eyes and anybody
[1:23:59] who does who likes good music will close
[1:24:01] your eyes and you just feel like you're
[1:24:03] there you feel like you can see the guy
[1:24:05] conducting it you can hear all kinds of
[1:24:08] different instruments coming in at
[1:24:09] different times playing in Rhythm man
[1:24:13] could close his mortal eyes to Earthly
[1:24:15] sight and live in the presence of Jesus
[1:24:18] Christ where he sees the word being beat
[1:24:22] out in the great Symphony that we are
[1:24:23] living in now
[1:24:26] you don't stand off and look at
[1:24:29] it the guy playing the viola or whatever

[1:29:31] time you're watching for it the works
[1:29:34] that I
[1:29:36] do shall you do
[1:29:39] also oh mighty says a great changing of
[1:29:42] time we get into the beat the beat of
[1:29:45] the word if you get into the word you'll
[1:29:48] find out how he did it at the
[1:29:52] beginning how how did Peter say in the
[1:29:55] name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk
[1:29:58] how did the shadow of Peter walk by and
[1:30:02] people were healed because he got into
[1:30:04] the
[1:30:06] music he got into the rhythm of
[1:30:13] it they had a sheet in their hand what
[1:30:17] they would do they were trying to look
[1:30:18] back to a beat they all had a portion
[1:30:21] had already played out they'd seen it
[1:30:23] happen before
[1:30:25] that's what the churches do today they
[1:30:27] look back and see what part Luther
[1:30:29] played the lutherans do they don't know
[1:30:32] the change in the music they didn't know
[1:30:34] it happened they're stuck back there in
[1:30:36] just the just shall live by faith and it
[1:30:39] booed back up into Wesley same thing the
[1:30:42] Pentecostal are
[1:30:44] stuck some of his message people are
[1:30:46] stuck on God's sent a prophet that's all
[1:30:50] they could
[1:30:51] see that's sad I know some people like
[1:30:54] that that all they could see was God
[1:30:56] sent a prophet they can't see what he
[1:30:59] said they lost the Rhythm they're not
[1:31:03] into the
[1:31:06] Rhythm they don't know the beat but we
[1:31:09] know the beat we know the time we know
[1:31:12] how it's supposed to
[1:31:15] go Brothers musicians
[1:31:19] come the real word of God falls upon the
[1:31:22] Vindicated
[1:31:24] seed and when they see that Vindication
[1:31:27] of the word they recognize it they're
[1:31:29] looking at the word they know the
[1:31:31] junction they know the timing they know
[1:31:34] the changes they know the Beats that's
[1:31:37] supposed to be in that
[1:31:39] hour they know that beat they know how
[1:31:43] it's supposed to go do you know how it's
