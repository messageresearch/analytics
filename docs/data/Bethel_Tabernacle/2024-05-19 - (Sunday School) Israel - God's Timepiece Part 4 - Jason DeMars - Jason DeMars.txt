e e a [Music] for for for [Music] for [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] h [Music] for [Music] morning everyone God bless you let's stand and pray Heavenly Father we just come before you Lord and we just want to commit this time into your hands Lord For Your Glory I pray that you would take your word and make it alive in our hearts father bring it to us as a supernatural Revelation father help each one of us to just get ourselves out of the way put the cares of this life to the side and focus on your word Lord come forth and move mightily amongst the people through your word we ask in Jesus name amen Amen brother Mark if you go ahead and bring up the PowerPoint we're going to start uh we're going to continue looking at Israel God's time piece this is part four and we're looking at verse 11 to start actually we're going to look at verse 13 Romans 11 verse 13 and I'll start reading for I speak to you Gentiles in as much as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles I magnify mine office if by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are of are my flesh and might save some of them for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world what shall be the receiving what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead for if the first fruits be holy the lump is also holy and if the root be holy so are the branches and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild Olive Tree were Graft in among them and with them partake us of the root and fatness of the Olive Tree both not against the branches but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root thee thou Willl say then the branches were broken off that I might be grafted Graft in well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith be high not high-m minded but fear for if God spared not the natural branches take heed lest he spared not thee behold therefore the goodness and severity of God on them which fell severity but toward the goodness if thou continue in his goodness other otherwise thou also shalt be cut off and they also if they abide not in still in unbelief shall be grafted in if God for God is able to graft them in again for if thou W cut off out of the Olive Tree which is Wild by nature and were grafted contrary to Nature into a good Olive Tree how much more shall these which be the natural branches be grafted into their own Olive Tree may the Lord add the blessing to the the reading of his word you can be seated so as we're looking at this and we've we were we've been talking over the last few times and comparing it back to some of the uh uh false teaching that has gone in the history of the church that's seems to be getting a Revival and I think much of that false teaching of what we call postmillennialism or a millennialism that views the church as the replacement for Israel um is is coming because people people see a conspiracy under every Rock and many times that has been proven true so therefore they see world powers working together Israel is one of these world powers they begin to think well if if all these nations are evil then this nation must also be evil and part of a conspiracy and so forth and it's not the place to get into all the details of that uh I think if you if you've seen much much uh chatter in the Christian World there is becoming somewhat of a small but growing anti- Zionist uh idea and movement to to despise Israel and again as we talked about in the past it's it's a it just as much as it's a mistake to look at Israel and say everything they do must be of God that's a mistake it's also a mistake to divorce Israel from the promises of God in the Bible that is an error the message goes right down the line brother brandom acknowledges that there is a wall treat Jew which in itself is lend lending it to the idea of these atheists who have have their hands in the stock market and in banking and are seeking to control everything behind the scenes and certainly they are at the same time there is his chosen they are his chosen people they've always been a rebellious people and and they're their their progenitor his name is Jacob so when we see that and understand that he's a supplanter and a deceiver so we see that's going to be the nation's natural tendencies going forward we shouldn't be shocked to see an element within Israel that is as brother Brandon put it a real Shyer yes that's his terminology and but that that doesn't eliminate the fact that within that core there is a seed there is a kernel within within or within that big picture of Israel it's as though it be as the sand of the sea only a Remnant will be saved got he's looking for that 144,000 all that he's doing to restore Israel is for that 144,000 and in order to restore this very Earth because it's his promises to who to the fathers it's not because Israel's good it's not because they're better than any Nation though they may think that though they may act like that has nothing to do with go the fact God did promise to them amen Paul is giving us the same warning don't be high-m minded I'm I'm the I'm the bride I'm the church I'm the Gentile God's dealing with Gentiles he not dealing with Jews we're the we're the ones that replace God's chosen people be careful be not high-minded he cut Israel off because of this idea you you don't think that you can't go off into air don't think that you can't go off into unbelief he will cut you off now again we're not talking about uh individual predestination God never if he saves someone he never turns away from that person he saves them to Christ came to save them to the uttermost amen as individuals but when we're looking at the church world as a whole and we're looking at Israel as a whole it's the the same rule applies is what we're talking about is the movement of the church the Jesus calls it in um Matthew 13 the Kingdom of Heaven shall be likened unto and there's all kinds of rotten things going on in the kingdom of heaven right what is it it's Christendom it's Christianity it's amongst the people that identify themselves by the name of Jesus though though they have not the name of Jesus upon them that's only the elected bride but they name themselves by the name of Jesus so he addresses himself to them all all the each one of the seven churches in Asia my goodness what failure what horrible failure he addresses himself first to the angel and that message goes to the angel and that angel is to deliver that message to the church and it always there's always two things going on right it's to the churches he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirits say to the churches not everybody hears not everybody listens who hears and who listens the Overcomer to him that overcometh every by by the grace of God the utter failure of the seven Church ages through that there's some that are ordained to over come the failure in in each age you know as as the post-millennial Viewpoint is that Christianity is going to take over the world and create a worldwide government that controls everything through Christianity and then after that happens Christ will return and this is the idea that they have that goes along with replacing Israel they take the scriptures that say not all Israel is Israel and true Israel is the ones who are circumcised in what where the heart not just the flesh they take that and they dismiss everything else that is spoken and that's that's why I feel like it's important to see this in the scripture because the Devil is a deceiver yeah amen and his favorite thing to use is to deceive is not news media though he does use it what does he used to deceive people with mis understanding misuse of the Bible amen so he says Paul is speaking still in Romans 11 of this distinction between Gentiles Israel Gentiles Israel why does he do that we spoke about that before even in uh probably part one he says in First Corinthians 10 31 and 32 where wherefore whether therefore you eat or drink or whatsoever you do do all to the glory of God give none offense neither to the Jews nor to the Gentiles nor to the Church of God so he makes three distinctions we look in the world and we have lots of different distinctions we can we can break things down by Nations we can break things down by quote unquote skin color we can break things down by what party you're a part of in politics we can but in the Bible we break down three things Jews Gentiles and the church and the church means the called ones from the Jews and the Gentiles right we can read EP you can go ahead and read Ephesians 2 Gentiles through faith are made partakers of all the promises of God all the promises of God now this is another thing that they'll you that that uh these modern anti- Zionist will use to show see the the church is a new thing and Israel has done away with again why why is Paul continually speaking in these three different ways he's he's always bringing this distinction even within the church he's making the distinction between Israel and Gentiles Jews and Greeks and it's very important for us not to miss that fact the church is the called out ones from Jews and Gentiles and yet they still maintain in the church in the standing of the church there's no first class and second class citizens am the Jew is not above the Gentile you say but Paul said to the Jew first and also to the Greek no the preaching of the Gospel goes to the Jew first and also goes to the Greek amen but remember in Acts what does he say because the Jewish people considered themselves Unworthy of the grace of God we will turn and go unto the Gentiles they rejected and turned away from the word and therefore God rejected and turned away from them and this is what we're getting at and getting to this point here in Romans 11 graph graphing in grafting in the Wild Olive gets grafted in to the nurtured and cared for Olive we were Gentiles were were wild they're olives but they're wild and so God cut off the Israeli Olive Branch right why because they weren't bearing fruit we can go back and look at the different Parables that Jesus brought but they were cut off because of unbelief their their unbelief produced a lack of fruit and so the danger then again and that Paul Paul is mentioning to the Gentiles in general is you per peradventure you fall in unbelief God will cut you off and graph in the natural Branch again all right so there's going to come a time I believe this is this this is a prophecy Paul is saying there's going to come a time where the Gentile masses of people will be concluded in unbelief yes amen they have taken and rejected the message that God sent to them am they've they've turned away from it and because they've turned away from it God says I'm concluding you in unbelief I'm cutting you off and I'm grafting in the natural branches for I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery th you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to Israel all right blindness in part has happened to Israel so what is Israel again going back to this anti- Zionist mindset what is Israel what is he talking about the church we're so confused by by this terminology I thought the Gentiles were the church or is it Israel's the church who's the what is he see it brings a confusion blindness in part has happened to Israel that's the people of the 12 tribes that lived in the land when Jesus came when the apostles preached the gospel and people that were not even in the land were out in the diaspora that Paul went to wherever he went to what did he do where did he go to First not the Pagan Temple Am he went to the synagogue to preach the gospel they rejected did yeah so that's what PA Paul is right in the midst of this he's not talking about something that happened somewhere else he's in the midst of this and he says blindness everywhere I preach they're blind they can't see it they can't see that Messiah has come and become a sacrifice for our sins it's right in the scripture but they're totally blind to it but it's only that blindness has happened only until the fullness of of the Gentiles be come in amen so there there is an expiration date on the blindness Saints they're still in blindness I don't know if we'll get to that scripture but they're restored back to the land in unbelief and sin and it's not back till they're restored back to the land that he pours upon them the spirit of Grace and supplications they're still in blindness what is the fullness of the Gentiles become in what is that mean well we have a very good uh statement that brother brandham uses and takes from actually irenaeus says when the last predestinated seed comes in then he turns and deals with Israel so when that last predestinated Gentile believer comes in and receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the time that he will come in and start dealing that's the fullness of the Gentiles when the last number of the predestinated seed comes in that is when the fullness of the Gentiles comes that's when blindness will be done away with amen and so all Israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob amen so all Israel shall be saved every single person in Israel millions of people no no because in Revelation Jerusalem is called the city that is spiritually Sodom and gomorah and Tel Aviv is one of the capitals of the world of homosexuality and gay pride movement um and even Jerusalem every June has a pride parade so the PO the politics of Israel is perverted and corrupted yet God has his Sovereign hand over all of it but will all Israel be saved no not all Israel will be saved well scripture says all Israel shall be saved there's many scriptures that we can go into that can describe to you that just means many Jews will be saved but if if you look at one in particular uh we won't bring it up I'll just refer to it is uh in the gospels and multiple times it says that all of Judea and Samaria went out to be baptized of John so what what what does all mean many did this is the language of the Bible many of them did no not every single one did cuz why did Jesus rebuke the Pharisees for not believing in John's baptism they weren't baptized by John and yet it says all Judea and Samaria went out to be baptized masses of people went out to be baptized by him a great Revival is coming it's not coming to the Gentiles this is the great Revival that's coming you'll see 144,000 saved from from the tribes of Israel for this is my Covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins this is speaking of uh J Jeremiah the New Covenant as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as concerning the election they are beloved for the father's sakes I think this perfectly describes what our attitude and our vision for Israel should be this scripture we understand they are enemies there are our enemies because of the Gospel that's a fact that's a fact on the ground in Israel if if if you were to go and start preaching to Jews openly in Israel it would be the last time you ever went to the country if you have a church and go preach at the church no problem but if you try to start evangelizing Jews big problem many missionaries have been turned out that have tried to operate openly and baptize Jews they've been turned out and and their visas canceled deported and never allowed back in the country am they are enemies they hate the gospel they still hate their Messiah call him names blaspheme him but as in the election they are beloved for the father's sake even as enemies just like us just like us before we were saved we were enemies with God and yet because of election you were beloved that's the same thing with Israel we can look at those Jewish people who reject our our our Lord and savior we can look at them and say you are beloved because not because you're good you're not not because you have some uh uh something better than anyone else it's because he made the promises to your ancestors and he will never turn away from his promises he will always fulfill his promises for his elect for the gifts of and calling of God are without repentance we always uh sort of diverse separate this verse from its context and that's fine it's true separated from the context mostly but the context is Israel and he's saying God has given them gifts he's call has a calling for them to obtain that the world would receive salvation through them that they would have a king over them ruling and reigning forever he has a promise for them amen and so God doesn't change his mind doesn't turn back from that it is his perfect promise to them and he will fulfill it as impossible as it might seem With God all all things are possible for as ye in times past have not believed God yet have now obtained Mercy through their unbelief amen it's because of their unbelief that God turned and began to deal with the Gentiles and Paul speaks of that as a great mystery the the the the Jews always looked and saw that salvation that they were to be the Light of the Nations and that salvation would come to the Nations through them and Paul takes the verse that applies to the nation of Israel applies it to him and Barnabas says we're the light of the Gentiles God did use two Jews to go out and bring the gospel to the Gentiles yes amen and it's through their unbelief that Paul by the spirit turned and began to deal with the Gentiles that was God doing that as we spoke about last time the Jews had their idea in their process of how salvation would come as in the past they felt that in order to in order to obtain salvation you have to get circumcised and start following the law of Moses and even many of them became Believers in Christ and still held this Viewpoint and went out from Jerusalem behind Paul and Barnabas and said you guys are mixed up you got to be circumcised and follow the law of Moses a and it became such a problem that they called for Paul and Barnabas to come Antioch said Paul and Barnabas you go to Jerusalem we we believe your message we believe God sent you but you got to go solve this cuz guys are coming from Jerusalem and saying hey you got to follow the law of Moses and so they go there and they write the Jerusalem Council gathers and what happens don't eat meat sacrifice to Idols don't eat meat with blood in it or things strangled avoid sexual immorality etc etc this was to be the law of the Gospel that went forth only is that what Paul did Paul even obey this if you read the the Epistles certainly did not what did Paul write to the Galatians this only would I learn of you receive ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith amen the the question is obvious the answer is obvious and he mentions that several times they they didn't receive the Holy Ghost they didn't receive they didn't come and be partakers of the New Covenant by the baptism of the Holy Ghost by working themselves into it or becoming worthy of it no they simply heard the word and believed and the spirit fell on them just like Cornelius and Peter made that me message clear I didn't go to Cornelius and say hey Cornelius you got to make sure to avoid eating meat with blood in it and um uh not eat things strangled and so on and so forth no no he he he never God didn't do that God already decided how he was going to save the Gentiles God had Vindicated how he was going to save the Gentiles then again through Paul and Barnabas and here man is trying to get his hands and say it must be this way where God is doing it this way God had had decided to send Paul God was working through Paul God sent Paul even to the Gentiles that were in throughout the Roman Empire to preach the gospel to them and what did they do he God wanted to make sure that Israel had one last chance to repent what did they do we don't want that Paul says you you counted yourselves Unworthy of the grace of God because of that we shake the dust from our feet and we'd go to the Gentiles amen that doesn't eradicate the promises of God right that doesn't change anything for the future promises however it is the revelation of the mystery which was hidden in God how that he was going to save Gentiles he was going to give them the Holy Ghost is he's going to Israel was going to reject the Messiah right and now the Gentiles could receive the promises made to the ancestors the fathers now we can be fellow citizens and partakers of the promises of God not by The Works of the law but by faith amen and so for Israel to be reso restored it's not going to be because they have a temple they will but that's not what restoration means it's not going to because they sacrifice a red heer everybody's oh red he first coming this sure that will be there and it'll be taken over by the Antichrist that'll be there but that's not what restores them what restores them is that God sends two two Messengers to preach the message of the hour to them they hear it by faith and they're sealed with the Holy Ghost and their father the father's name is written in their foreheads in other words they receive a revelation of the name of almighty God the Lord Jesus Christ and they're baptized in his name and they receive the Holy Ghost that's how Israel will obtain restoration not by getting faithful to Moses not by making a temple that'll be there for the Antichrist amen well by the grace of God time is getting short both for me and spiritually when when when the Rapture takes place that's when he turns to deal with the Jews the bride has to be taken out of the way right pulled aside so Joseph can reveal himself to his Brethren and so that that that is coming close and when that happens Satan comes down incarnates a man goes on a rampage against the the people of God
