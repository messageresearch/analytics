TRANSCRIPT
========================================
welcome out on this rainy, gloomy day. We pray that it's uh maybe gloomy outside, but it wouldn't be gloomy in our hearts. It's easy for the for the outside to come in, but let's let the light shine out from us instead of all this uh lack of sunshine and rain that's coming. Let's uh let's focus on Christ. Amen. Let's pray. Let's let's stand and we'll pray. Brother Mark, if you want to bring the PowerPoint up, that'd be great. Heavenly Father, we just want to commit this time to you, Lord. We ask that by your Holy Spirit, you'd come and take your word and write it upon our hearts, Father, because we know that's that's the place where change and transformation comes. It's it's not by emotions. It's not by our feelings. It's not it's not by the word of some man, Lord, but it's your word being taken and written in our hearts, Lord. That's what changes us and transforms us and makes us into Jesus Christ, Lord. And it's you coming to confront us over our uh sinfulness, over our selfishness, Lord, over things, Lord, that have been controlling us. And you bringing revelation that would deliver us from uh the things that are hindering us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, and it can be simple things and it can be big things, Lord. But you're the great deliverer. And we look to you, commit ourselves to you in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I guess I'm not even starting with the scripture this morning. So, thanks for standing up. It's good to exercise. You can sit down again. So, we're continuing on the life of Christ part six. And just want to quickly review the definition of love that we talked about last time. Before that, want to remind you of the four loves that we talked about. Agape love, which is is divine love. That's the love of God. Comes from a source outside of ourselves. It's not from internal to us, but it's from external to us into us because it's the love the agape of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us. So him in us loving out to others. Then there's filelio love which speaks of friendship. Stoay love which speaks of affection. Aeros which is sexual love. And as long as everything is ordered correctly, human love is just fine. But without God in the middle of it, human love will never be ordered correctly. It'll all be disordered and perverted. And I think that's really the main kind of the main focus of what I want to talk about this time is when love gets disordered. So defining love, love is a power or force. Brother Brandham tells us that it's the most powerful force in the world is love. That's what ch that's what brings change. That's what brings transformation is when God's love is extended to us. So when it's God's love in us, it's a a power or force to extend yourself for the highest good of others. What is the highest good of others? &gt;&gt; That they're comfortable. No, that they grow spiritually. &gt;&gt; That's what we spoke about before. God's love is his election. And how is he his election expressed? He allows us to go through very difficult things and hard things in order to cause us to grow up into the head which is Christ. And so if that love expressed in and through us will be expressed in the same way which is causing us causing others ourselves included even in this to grow spiritually and in turn help others to grow spiritually. So it's when you can extend yourself for the other person to help them to grow in Christ. That's what love is. And that's probably the the if we look at love, it is like the greatest uh deception that the world has today. And they use love more so as a club to beat over the heads of other people to control them than they do for what it really is. What what is what love is is not controlling other people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Love sets free God God we love God because we choose to love God. Now we can talk about the process of salvation the inner working of that etc. That's another story. But love is only love when we freely give it. If we are forced externally to love a person then it isn't love actually it's fear or something else. &gt;&gt; So love is only love when it's freely given. So like we spoke about last time at at the same time you know it's it's love is done expressed automatically like the people in Matthew 25. When did we visit you? When were you sick and imprisoning? When did we do we didn't even know we did this. It just happened out of the abundance of their heart. They love was expressed to visit and to provide and to help to do something. So we can also gather that love is not a feeling but love is an action. Love is also hard work and effort. Because part of being able to love others is you have to examine yourself and your motives. Because it comes down to if you don't understand the motives and objectives of your own heart, you might be doing something out of uh coercion. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Or force or fear. Or you're doing something you have no clue that you're doing it that's damaging a person, that's hurting a person, that's hindering their growth. And you think you're loving them. What you're doing is you're damaging them. You're hurting them. And that is actually if you look at what evil is. Really examine what what is evil, you'll understand that evil people don't know that they're evil. They think usually they think they are the best. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; They usually think they're the most loving, the most caring. That's their impression of themselves. and they never take the time to examine the fruit of their life. Hey, there's chaos all around me. People are uncomfortable. They're fearful. That's their problem. &gt;&gt; That's what the evil person says. That is their problem. I'm just a normal person doing normal things. I've done my best to do this. So, they always see the goodness in themselves, but can never recognize the evil. Truly loving people recognize their own capabilities for selfishness and evil. Truly evil people always find a scapegoat. We'll talk about that a little bit more. Genuine agape love requires self-examination, searching our motives and considering why we do what we do and working to order love correctly according to the word. Right? Love is not love if it's disordered. Love must be ordered properly according to the word. If you love people more than God, you say, "Oh, I'm I'm a very loving person." No, you're not. &gt;&gt; You have to love God first. &gt;&gt; You know, you have a preacher and he says, "I I love this church with all my heart and I've put all my effort and all my strength into it." Meanwhile, his wife is miserable. his children are falling by the wayside. His his family is destroyed. They're they're very uncomfortable and very happy. That's not love. You don't love your congregation because you'd love your family first if you had real love. Because God says to order it this way, not another way. Evil can never recognize the evil that it's doing. It always blames it on it's somebody else's fault and problem. I'm getting way ahead of myself. I don't know why I keep emphasizing that. Stick to the notes. Genuine agape love requires self-examination. What do I mean by that? It's hard work because we are all fall we're in fallen flesh. &gt;&gt; There is a part of us that just wants to serve yourself. And so we'll create elaborate schemes of religion &gt;&gt; to show forth that we are doing it right, that we're okay, that we're that we don't need to change. Rule 101. Someone that has love is always realizing and he just needs to change and grow. Amen. &gt;&gt; If I were to raise my children exactly the same way my parents raised children, I would be evil because the the the age that we're living in right now is so drastically different &gt;&gt; than how I was raised, how my parents were raised. If we just stuck with that exact same model and mode, we would lose all our children. They would all they would hate us and we would have no relationship with them. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're living in a different age and a different hour. We have to adjust oursel and who knows we may be on the precipice of another time and we have to adjust oursel again. So you have to always you're always examining your motives and objectives. You're examining how am I interacting with other people? How am I speaking to other people? Am I helping them to grow or am I hindering them? Am I holding them back from growing? That's the danger because evil so how do what is what is evil backwards live. So that is that is the it's it's what is the most disadvantageous to life. That's what evil is. So if you think about love, if love is a power force that extends itself for the purpose of spiritual growth, what is evil? It's anything that hinders or stops or blocks spiritual growth in others. Think about it this way. I'm raising I'm raising children and by the time they're 18, they can't cook. They don't know how to do the laundry. They don't know how to operate a bank account. They don't know how to save money and they don't know anything about the message at all. They just been dragged to church. They don't know the reason behind anything. Am I loving them? No. I'm creating people that are dependent on me to function. That isn't love. That's evil. Because we're supposed to grow spiritually. And if we're not creating spiritual growth, especially in oursel and in our family, we're not operating according to love. We're operate operating according to evil. And as I said, what so what's the purpose of hindering spiritual growth in others? It's to protect their own sick selves. That's what evil does. They protect their own skin at all costs. They can never seem to be seen as the one that's mistaken. That's one the one that's in error. The one that needs to be corrected. It always has to have the upper hand and be right. And because of that, it always has to have a scapegoat. &gt;&gt; We can find this through the Bible. And if we get there, we'll talk about it. Now, next thing is it's easy to point at others and say, "You've done evil. You've done evil. You've done evil." But what about me? Because if I've I've absolutely done things that have hindered my children's spiritual growth, I've done evil. The Lord's helped me to repent and I might still be doing it doing evil and I might still have need of repentance. I believe that I do. And we have to understand that and be be humble enough to admit it to ourselves is that we do things to hinder other people. &gt;&gt; But don't just let it continue. &gt;&gt; Amen. The love of God would cause you to repent so that you're not hindering other people from growing spiritually. And again, I'll I'll repeat what I said before. Evil people usually are not aware that they're evil. They think they're normal, average, or probably above average, and that everything they're doing is for the greater good. But they'll never evaluate the fruit of their lives. All around them is confusion, hurt, anger, and pain. But they'll tell you clearly that's their fault. That's their problem. I don't know why they did that. It's always someone else's problem. They can never own their own faults. &gt;&gt; Amen. Another illustration would be a pastor that creates reliance on himself. We've all heard the stories. We all we all we've all perhaps even uh lived through it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And I've come out on the other side to tell the story. &gt;&gt; They won't allow anybody to make decisions on their own. You can't you couldn't make a life decision. and you have to ask the pastor for approval for your for all your life decisions. And it's it's all over the place. And it's h it's happened time and time again. There's people sitting here that have been victims of this kind of spiritual abuse &gt;&gt; and they can't make their own decision. Pastor has to give them permission. Why is it evil? It's good to get the opinion of others before you make a decision, right? But this is not that. This is that turned into something evil because true love would help you grow so that you in maturity can make your own decisions following the leadership of the Holy Spirit. Evil, this e this kind of evil hinders spiritual growth. And what does it do? It creates dependency. Love is not dependency. Love always points other people to the source of spiritual growth. And it's not me, it's Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Love is not dependency. If I if I raise my kids in such a way that they can't function without me, that is evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is hindering their spiritual growth. The function of parents is for the spiritual growth of their children. It's not merely to create relationships. That's part of it. It's to grow them into adults. &gt;&gt; If we can put it in biblical terms, it's to adopt them. &gt;&gt; Bring them to full adoption. Bring them to maturity. So they then can walk in their own spiritual life on their own two feet. &gt;&gt; Love is not dependency. Instead of teaching our sons about finances and working hard, we allow them just to skate along life doing what's easy because otherwise they get angry and frustrated at you and give you trouble. So, let's just let them do the easy thing. That's evil. That's absolutely evil because the love says, "No, you're going the wrong way. You have to be a man. You have to take care of a home. You have to take care of a family. You have to take responsibility." But instead of adopting our sons, we let them be in perpetual boyhood. And that's flatout evil. &gt;&gt; It's our job as parents to establish what it means to live as mature in Christ in their hearts. And that work starts from the time they're little. Doesn't start when they're 13. It has to start long before that. In Eastern culture, you're an adult by the time you're 13. and and evil always blames someone else for what it did. I know I'm repeating these points, but I I want to get it through &gt;&gt; very clear. It will always pass the buck on to someone else. I think I skipped a bunch of screens. Okay. Defining evil. Evil is anything that hinders or stops spiritual growth in order to protect our own sick selves, and it always has a scapegoat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Genesis 3:9. And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked and hid myself. And he said, Who told thee thou was naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee thou that thou shouldest not eat? And the man said, the woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree and I did eat. Here in this case, there's two scapegoats, the woman and God. Adam instead of taking personal responsibility for his sin passed the buck off to his wife and then ultimately to God himself. It's a flaw in design by the maker. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What about Eve? Did she take personal responsibility? And the Lord God said unto the woman, "What is this that thouast done?" Woman said, "Serpent did it. &gt;&gt; The devil made me do it. serpent beguiled me and I did eat. So let's walk through what is personal responsibility. Who is responsible here? God went to the person responsible first, right? Adam responsibility isn't say saying let's bring this down to our own home. responsibility is saying you know all these years I tried to do my best to raise my kids but you know they turned out like they didn't they had not serving the Lord my wife has always been a problem she's she's never taken the time to teach the girls anything you know see that's that's not true in my home but that would be that would be the picture here bringing it down to our our age is we're going to always blame somebody else. Why did your wife not do it, buddy? Were you teaching your wife? Well, that was the pastor's job. Uh-oh. No, it was your job. You are the head of the home. The only one under above you is Christ. So, you're the king in that home. And you can't just blame someone else for something that happened. You have full responsibility. And when you're called to account for what's happened in your family, God is not going to ask. You might ask your wife second, as in this case, but he ain't going to ask your wife first. You are the one that will be held personally responsible for what is happening in your home. And so live that way. Part of us being part of us being restored back to what everything that Adam lost by the opening of the seven seals is us being able to take responsibility for what's happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We we we're wanting to speak and our word is backed, but then if something goes wrong, we want someone else to be responsible. No, that's not how it works. We have to take personal responsibility for the things that happen in our life. If we don't, God looks upon us as being evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I won't go through the details. I've referred to the story a number of times. But you see in 1st Samuel 15, Saul is given a command and Samuel is told, "This man has refused to fulfill the word of the Lord. I've because he's rejected me. I've rejected him from being king. So this is the word that Samuel's going to. Samuel comes to Saul. Saul says, "I've com I've performed the commandment of the Lord." Samuel says, "What what in the world is this uh farm animal noise that's going on here that we got?" Well, they've been brought from the Amalachites. The people spared the best of the sheep and of the ox oxen to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God. Oh my, what a religious man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Using religion as a cloak for his evil. Then Samuel said unto Saul, "I will tell thee what the Lord has said to me this night." And he said unto him, "Say on." And so he goes through that and he tells him, "You didn't obey and you did evil in the sight of the Lord." Saul again argues with the prophet. Yay, I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and I did go and do the way that the Lord sent me and I brought the king back and I destroyed the Amalachites and we're going to offer sacrifices. It's going to be it's going to be a great meeting. We're going to have a great special meetings here. God will be so pleased. &gt;&gt; And and Samuel says, "Does the Lord have a great delight in special meetings as he does in obeying the Lord your God?" Does he? I want to ask everyone that. &gt;&gt; Is that the answer to everything? Or is obeying the word of the Lord the answer to everything? Obeying the word of the Lord is the answer to everything. So what is it? We take personal responsibility for what goes right and goes wrong. As men &gt;&gt; and as women, as dads and as moms, we take responsibility. And then once we take responsibility, we go forward and do what we must do to teach and instruct and lead in our homes and in our families. And if our wife must be corrected, we must correct her. And if our children must be corrected, we have the difficult conversations and we make the stands and we bring the consequences and we do what we have to do to restore order in our homes and families. &gt;&gt; And the first thing that you have to do to restore order in homes and families is restore the heart connection between you and your family. It's not with rules and with with might and with power. Yes, there's times where you have to do that. But without the heart connection between you and your family, what will it be? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; A fight. &gt;&gt; It will be very difficult. It'll be difficult even with a heart connection. &gt;&gt; To reestablish order in the home, it will be. But without a heart connection, you might as well forget it. We go about it the wrong way. We We start it the wrong way. We try to try to fix it the wrong way. and we try to maintain it the wrong way &gt;&gt; without really being connected to the hearts of our family. We can't that's the that's rule 101 in teaching. If you're not connected to the people's hearts and there's not a respect and an honor between you in your lives, they can't learn anything. &gt;&gt; And it starts with how you treat one another. If you're not going to hon be be honorable towards your family, towards your wife, they're not going to honor you back. Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And your wife, if you're not sisters, if you're not going to honor your daughters and treat them with honor and respect, if you're going to yell at them and scream at them, guess what you're going to get when they're teenagers? Yelling and screaming teenagers. And so it's it to to fix it, it's it's hard. It's difficult. But we have to remember it's a relationship. &gt;&gt; Amen. rules without relationship brings rebellion. &gt;&gt; I have no idea where I am. Nowhere near my notes. &gt;&gt; But we have to understand this is there's many problems. I have problems. I've made horrible mistakes that have caused disasters in my family. But the grace of God has woken me up in the middle of the night to correct me sometimes. &gt;&gt; And then what do I have to do? I have to take action. But we also have to remember you can take action uh like a fanatic. We've all met people that are like that and you talk to them for 10 minutes and you know there's a whole lot of crazy going on &gt;&gt; and they're so zealous for the word of God. They'll let you know that you're an unbeliever and everyone else in the entire planet is an unbeliever besides them and whoever agrees with them. No, we're not talking about being fanatical about it. We're talking about loving well. We're talking about understanding that that part of spiritual love is a heart connection that the person has felt that you actually care about them. Now, of course, we understand that can all be perverted. We're not suggesting that it's all sunshine and rainbows in this connection of hearts because it's like sometimes you have to say hard things. Sometimes you have to say difficult things. In fact, love demands it. If we don't say the difficult things and hard things, it's we're not aiming for their spiritual growth. We might be aiming for a good feeling, but we're not aiming for spiritual growth. Again, as Christians, we're not aiming for felio love, sto experience. We're aiming for agape. This is the love that's called, God has called us to. My goodness. I'm just going to close there because I'm so far off my notes and to get back it's going to take about 15 minutes. So, let's pray. Heavenly Father, we just come before you, Lord, and we want to commit this word into your hands. Father, I I was all mixed up with it and all over the place and repeating myself, Lord, but believe it was even through my uh leaving my notes so badly, I believe that you're you were directing things and you were speaking things into people's lives, Father. Maybe speaking things into my own life, Father. So, we thank you for that. We commit ourselves to you for your glory. We ask in Jesus name. Amen.
