let's pray Lord Jesus father as the song said touching you Lord is all that matters what good is our songs what good is the preaching and all the religious things we could do if you're not the center of it Lord and not only being the center of it but Lord being able to respond back to us Lord Lord we we're we're glad to say that our God is not some totem pole withdrawed on the eyes or or some figment of our imagination but you're a real God lord and we know that we're in the land of the living Lord and there's no doubt that Jesus is the true and Only Living God and Lord we pray and confess that unto you today Lord that you would just continue to show yourself real to your people Lord Lord you even say approve me Lord and Lord God we we want to prove you this morning that's taking you at your word today Lord God not our thoughts on any other man's thoughts but your thoughts and your ways Lord which are always higher than ours Lord and Lord God we pray the blessing of the Kingdom upon each and every hero that would hear Lord whether it be present or streaming the service Lord we'll just pray you'd have your way Lord Lord continue Lord to let the holy spirit guide and lead us and pour out Lord but before we get there Lord we just want to make our slates clean Lord we want to say father forgive us Lord for anything that's not like you Lord forgive us for our sins and trespasses Lord shortcomings however we want to Define it Lord we want to be in your sight Lord blameless Lord covered by that precious blood so we plead the blood of the Lamb today Lord Lord just as if we've never done it justifies afresh in the name of Jesus Christ we pray the church say amen amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to Numbers Chapter 13. numbers 13. Numbers Chapter 13. let's um let's start reading that verse 26. number 13 and 26. if you ever say man and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to call the congregation of the children of Israel unto the Wilderness of Paran and kadish and brought back word unto them and unto the congregation and show them the fruit of the land and they told them and said we came unto the land whether thou sentence us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it oh my let's go to uh Romans chapter four chapter four Romans 4 let's start reading that um verse 17. as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believes even God who quickeneth the dead and call it those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being that weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform amen may the Lord blessed reading of his word you can have your seats praise God let's give the Lord a hand clap of praise [Applause] amen by the grace of God today I desire your prayers but we want to use for a subject amen faith has its own reality faith has its own reality now we we've heard so many messages about faith and I just want to declare in my own Christian Life that it never gets old amen because God is always dealing with us on a level of Faith because we can't see everything that God has for us so that's why we're called Believers amen God wants us to believe in what God has for us but you know when when I think of uh faith and reality it's it's let's just look at it faith is looking to the Unseen but reality is what's true Hallelujah so how can your faith look to the Unseen of what's really true amen that's when you believing comes in the hand Hallelujah and you know as we look in the scriptures right here this morning and we take the children of Israel before we get there let's just back up a little bit now the whole reason why the children of Israel were were looking for a land flowing with milk and Honeys because God gave Abraham a promise God gave Abraham a promise that you know your seed is going to be like the stars and so forth like saying you're going to be the father of Nations amen is that what God told Abraham he also told Abraham see that you're going to possess the Gate of your enemy Hallelujah so God is in the business of throwing out a lot of promises hallelujah hallelujah and one thing about a promise when it comes from God it can't be taken back Hallelujah if God said it I want you to catch this now if God said it it has to be a reality Hallelujah if God said it somehow someway it has to come into tuition Hallelujah it has to become real to you as a Believer if God's had it if you're a Believer if you're walking in faith amen and we know that the Bible says faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things what not seen so faith has the ability to make it real faith has the ability to create the substance of what you're hoping for Hallelujah but we're not in this place today hoping amen we're in this place today as Believers amen when we look at the word of God and say that's my reality we look at the word of God and we say that's my truth hallelujah we look at the word of God and say God you said it I believe it and that settles it that's where God wants us to walk Hallelujah but how do we get there Hallelujah it's a walk of Faith amen he told Abraham walk before me and be thou perfect amen those are some strong words God telling a man who's uh almost 100 years old walked before me and be thou perfect a man living and seeing a man Hallelujah born in failure now God comes and says Abraham I'm going to give you something to look forward to Abraham I'm going to speak your reality walk before me and be thou perfect that was Abraham's reality but he had to walk into it amen hallelujah what do you have to get through first he had to conquer his own doubts he had to conquer the greatest thing that's hindering the church today brother Matt is our imagination that's the greatest thing hindering us it's your imagination When You Reach opposition what do you think about first what God Said or what's before you and most of the time hallelujah our reality is being controlled by what our eyes see when your reality should be controlled by what truth hallelujah oh my let's look at the word reality reality means the states or quality of being real how many believe in God so God should be your reality this morning everything about him should be real to you this morning Hallelujah Jesus going in the grave and dying and raising again that's a reality to the believer Hallelujah because if he did do that like the Bible says that means that everything he meant for that death to be Hallelujah stands true in a believer's life this morning Hallelujah but you know as us as as children of God you and I as people the thing we have to deal with the most is our own self getting in our own way we become our own hindrances let's start with Abraham Hallelujah and I don't plan being alone today y'all know I'm about to close Hallelujah but George let's look at Abraham Hallelujah God called him what the father of faith God's telling him his reality and the first thing Abraham does he tries to believe God with his five senses oh my how often God gives us a word from heaven and we try to believe it without five senses your Five Sisters oh boy you're gonna say something heavy now your five senses Hallelujah are not connected to your reality [Applause] how can you make a statement like that because the prophet of God said your five senses are connected so you can live on this side Hallelujah but Faith which is my reality is for what where I come from and where I'm going back to so My Five Senses will always deny where I come from because my Five Sisters say you're a body of Flesh your Five Sisters say you don't have 20 20 Vision your five senses say you're hard of hearing your Five Sisters say you got the sickness of that sickness but ask yourself what is my reality according to the word of God oh see the thing about your Five Sisters is your Five Sisters Hallelujah will get you to believe in a lie and strip you away from your reality anybody ever Hallelujah I I know this to be true because it happens to me someone as I get up cause I'm I'm past 25 someone as I get up and I feel a little tightness sometimes in my junks Hallelujah that's what I've been dealing with you a long time you changed the pronunciation of it it's in my Jones is in my bones you know when I get up sometimes and it's like oh it's like ah and you know indeed a voice will come and say you have this or you have that but the reality of it is by his stripes I'm already healed so if I walk in my truth my truth will control early in my next step my truth will control earlier my next step my next step my next step if I can walk in my tooth and my truth will become what my reality Hallelujah I love how the prophet of God said Hallelujah you are your thoughts what you're thinking right now that's who you are if you're thinking about Krispy Kreme Donuts you are a donut let's change it I know what some of you thinking about you thinking about that chicken it's barely and it starts to control your thoughts oh my but let's make it spiritual church you are what's your thoughts say you are the greatest battle ever fought is wearing the mind but let's bring it brother Jason if we can't can we bring it to the proper perspective we we we love to use that when we're going through a battle well brother I'm trying to believe but you know the prophet says the greatest battle ever fall is in the mind I'm trying to believe the greatest battle of a fall yes brother I know what the prophet said but I'm going through a battle we shouldn't use quotes to succumb to the pressure but we should stand on what we believe and walk into our reality the king the prophet of God wasn't saying the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind for us hallelujah to give over to the devil he wasn't saying that for us to surrender our mind our thoughts to the devil no he said it's a battle that means God wants your mind too Hallelujah that's what makes it a battle not only the devil's trying to get that ground but God also wants that ground Hallelujah but we succumb to depression so many times and we say okay I'm fighting about it in my mind just give it over to God Hallelujah and don't let your me up your imagination take you into areas that are not even true oh my a lot of times your imagination can work Hallelujah against your reality and we're going to get there but look Hallelujah good to see brother Smith praise God hallelujah hey man but you think about it Church you look at Abraham first thing God says to him is you're going to have a son because God already told him you're going to be the father of Nations and this is not going to happen you're going to have a son now he has to get through get past his imagination then the first thing he does he laughs at his reality church I don't know about you if God has ever told me anything I want to believe it sister smell Hallelujah I want to believe it I want to walk in and Hallelujah I don't want to wave her with it but I want to take a step like God told Abraham walk before me and be thou perfect see faith is walking through that word that's been pronounced over your life Hallelujah faith is not just sit back saying I believe Hallelujah Abraham didn't believe he didn't become a Believer until he started walking with God but he was already the father of faith brother Diggs you're contradicting yourself no God made him a believer of his own reality by faith Hallelujah because Abraham couldn't see himself as the father of Faith because he laughed at God Chris he says me the father of faith man I'm 90 years old and then Sarah comes in and hears the same thing now he has to deal with an unbelieving wife boy we're gonna leave that one alone is hard enough believing something on your own but then you have someone else connected to it that don't believe also boy you in trouble trouble trouble and Abraham he started it off because he laughed and all Sarah did was picked up his anointing fathers husbands Hallelujah a lot of times you see things going on in the house because it starts with you first and you it may be a mild form but then your kids will watch it your spouse will watch it different people watch it and the devil used them to take it to the extreme it may have been just a simple Netflix movie Hallelujah but then it turned into Hulu Yoo-hoo sport you Hooters Olu knew who by who every kind of who Yahoo because it started really really simple that's why we had to catch things amen we have to catch with Satan is trying to pull us away from our reality in my reality Hallelujah what's our reality Church our reality as a man is Genesis 1 26. oh we was created to be gods we was created to have dominion over everything Church somebody say everything that means whatever you're going through right now you're supposed to have dominion over it you say everybody how can you say that because the prophet of God said everything Adam lost was restored in Jesus Christ because when Jesus Christ came he walked in his reality oh my what I love about the church he stepped down from being Hallelujah the god of glory and became a man stepped into your reality stepped into our reality how we were going to be born if I could say Jesus did it first Hallelujah anything you can think about I'll bring it back to the scriptures and say Jesus did it first Hallelujah but now Church Abraham God tells him and Sarah you're gonna have a child Hallelujah in your age by Sarah at the appointed time and then Sarah gets anointed and says can't be me having pleasure with my Lord at this old age or whatever the case may be no he must mean Hagar she got in the way of the Walk of faith which changed the reality or produce something that God didn't intend to produce sure they produced in Ishmael which was something wild something untameable something that would later on rise up against what God had for them and that's what happens when we let our imagination get in the way our imagination will create something that will later on stand in the way of what God has for us and we know the story so he takes hey God has the baby this and that blah blah blah all that get out the way but he's still walking by faith and now he goes we know the patterns of his life and you know he has lot with him and all these different things and him a lot begin to clash and and you know and now he has to fight for lot now he has to go down and plead the blood Hallelujah the spiritual blood for lot all these things he's fighting because he's trying to maintain the promise of God walk before me and be thou perfect and he don't even understand how he's going to walk and be perfect because every step he meets Hallelujah seems like a battle every step he takes seems like he's losing but that's a part of his reality every step is making him Hallelujah the father of faith I hope you're catching the church Hallelujah so there are things you'll go through holy that you might not want to go through but it's producing your reality in our church Oh my he gets there and and and and he tells Sarah Hallelujah he says hey you're beautiful you're looking good grandma Hallelujah you're looking real good granny nobody can look like you look granny but you know what I want you to understand this they gonna kill me oh he's creating in his own reality by his imagination told him somebody gonna take your wife and I'm gonna have to fight for you God never told him that no worries but church God never told him that if we could look at it if we could dive into it what caused that King to take Sarah ham Abraham's what caused that King to take Sarah Abraham's imagination thank you brother he comes he says you're very beautiful the king want to kill me because they gonna want you so hey let's just change this for a second you're not my wife you're my sister and he tries to change what God made him but let me tell you something you ain't gonna mess it up God ain't gonna let you mess it up because if you could change God's word God would never speak it Hallelujah so God allowed you to go through something and look like you failed just so he could come on a scene and say prove me just so he could come on the scene and say I got this just so he could come on the scene and say I told you so just so he can come on and see he say if you only believe all things are possible so God will let us meet things that we can't control just so he can show you how I'm in control of it and that's the hardest part getting past our five senses because your five sixes are connected to What Fear now God to get Abraham to his reality he has to conquer his fears first in his own fears lies within who he is see Church he looks at the king and the whole Army of the king and everything the King has to offer and he says you know what I'm not able to come against us see his fears as in a way I can't beat this Army I can't do this and I can't that you know how we do when it comes to believing God first thing we say I don't make enough money I don't do this my prayer life ain't together I can't pray long enough I can't I can't I can and you're creating resistance you know what God want to do to us most of the time Matthew when we start going I can't just I can't just I'll tell you let's flash back the first time a person came to God and said I can't you know what God said shut up Moses who made your mouth now God's gonna tell him his reality who made your mouth who did this who did that he said you know what Moses do who you are you be God see God always elevates us higher than our imagination Moses is looking at himself in his five senses saying I'm not doesn't I'm not dead I can't talk and I did this and I did that God said shut up you are a god that's why Moses could stand before a raging seek and then he could create and speak Hallelujah things into existence that was not even there what was that that's God he says the Egyptians who've you've seen you shall see them no more forever now he's creating Hallelujah listen he didn't even speak to the Sea to see what the problem the problem was that the Egyptians who were chasing them Hallelujah so Moses speaks to his problem Hallelujah and by speaking to his problem the sea opens up and they walk to their reality maybe if you speak to the problem Hallelujah God will open up the way and then you can step into your reality Hallelujah glory to God but let's go back to Abraham Hallelujah now the king takes Sarah and he wants to wife her he wants to do the things that a husband does with his wife and then God steps in don't you love it when God step in you say oh god I've been praying for my bags leading the job for so long just keep praying don't accept what your eyes see church I'll be a witness if my mom accepted what her eyes saw in me I wouldn't be here but what she did she accepted the promise of God in Isaiah 55 or 54 one of the two Hallelujah God gave her a scripture and said to her all your children are going to come back to these borders Hallelujah and we were all doing different things Hallelujah but that promise became a reality all of us are in the kingdom of God now why because she didn't let Her Imagination overtake what God's word said don't let the the images your imaginations of your thoughts and your minds Hallelujah and your five senses go above what God has already said about you hey you know what helps me when it comes to these things like this God comes into Jeremiah 29 and he says for I know the thoughts I have towards you oh can somebody say Amen I ain't worried about what you think God says I know the thoughts I have concerning you Hallelujah God said he knows what he thinks about my journey but he thinks about my life what he thinks about my trial he said I got thoughts of peace and not of evil and you know what Diggs hallelujah what I'm thinking is going to bring you to an expected end God is looking for something out of you he's expecting it he's looking for what something real and you look at the whole journey of Abraham and Abraham see her Abraham battled to get to that walk of Faith to be the father fan all the way to the point to where he wouldn't deny anymore no matter what he was going through then God comes down and God confirms it God makes it and seals it a reality and he says now I know God cause Abraham he says now I know you love me now I know you fear me he said you know what Abraham I'ma never hide anything from you again we're gonna have a one-on-one and I'm gonna tell you the truth but then Abraham's seed Hallelujah starts off the same way he does oh my God Isaac picks up Hallelujah the same traits as Abraham line doing the same thing but that wasn't his reality his reality Hallelujah was Samina Rebecca Hallelujah who was chosen by the Eliza who was a servant of Abraham glory to God holy and all of that was carry on what the reality of the promise from Abraham and then you go from Isaac Hallelujah Isaac to Jacob looks like he picked up the same traits Jacob was a deceiver lying and cheating and lying to his daddy lying to everybody but that wasn't his reality don't look at your failures that's a part of it God's trying to get you to make steps of perfection and the only way you could be perfect first you have to have error you say brother these I got to have error yeah you didn't have ever how you know it's right I'd like to say to the young people that are sitting here you know what maybe you're excited about church today because it's a fellowship afterwards you're gonna eat good you're gonna drink good but there's a bigger picture I always say to the young people that most of us your parents and your adults here we've already been your crash dummies I've said this before you can take the finest car the the the most expensive car before they put it out there on the road they had to go through a crash test first three hundred thousand dollar Mercedes boom wreck up Smash Up but they didn't just smash it they put a body in it that would resemble you so that crash wasn't just a crash that crash had a purpose behind you that grass was to save some lives eventually that crash Hallelujah would prevent somebody from missing their reality so what God did Hallelujah just like that test he put some of us dummies Hallelujah and let us crash to prevent you from running into the same walls and it's amazing to me how the children think we don't know what we talking about look at me I got the scars of the accident we have the scars of the accident but we take some of our sons who are uh most of our kids grow up to be our boys grew up to be taller than us no thank you something special you just got more pesticides than you it's causing you to grow a little bit extra you just got more steroids in you be careful with this stuff because Church even now Holly you know that steroids is considered in the in the in the the the performance the performance era to be illegal but when you go to the doctor and you have a pain where they give you steroids if it's illegal for them why should it be okay for me sisters you come and say honey how do I look I feel like I'm gaining weight you just say honey stop taking them steroids and you won't feel like that that's what it's doing is pushing out in areas that don't need to be seen and that's normally what the devil does he tries to get you to push out in areas that don't need to be seen hold on let me get off of that but church if you take it and you look at the examples of the scriptures you get to Jacob and Jacob Hurley look like his life was a mess but that was a part of his reality remember the Seed of Abraham has to walk before God and be thou perfect so there may be a lot of trial and error in that walk but the end of it is the reality of perfection that's why all the other Brides all the other churches had to fail so we could get in position Hallelujah why because this church is going to walk into perfection this church is going to walk into a body take oh yeah and then we got scriptures that speaks of our reality and it says ye shall not all sleep some of us are going to be well aware of what's taking place we're going to be well aware looking at this message and all these things that are prophesied coming to pass Church what are we we're walking by perfection how many of you feel this way it doesn't matter who the president is whatever God says is going to happen it's going to happen if I can hit this real quick don't get caught up in Democrats and Republicans and all that nonsense well well you don't vote you can't make a change the changes in the word of God now you can do what you want to do you know I ain't tell nobody not to vote but I didn't already cast my vote and it's the same every year hallelujah it's the same every year because I know earlier his legislation is not going to change Holly I know what he stands for what he believes earlier is not going to change when he's under pressure he's not going to succumb to the pressure of the people trying to put on but Jesus Christ Remains the same yesterday today and forever that's my reality and no matter how many laws they changed how many laws they create how many things they make up Hallelujah the reality of the Believers stays the same but if your hope isn't biting I feel sorry for you if your hope is in Trump I feel even more sorry for you let me let me move on oh my God cause I know people get caught up in this what's happening your imagination because the word of God has already told us hallelujah who's going to take over everything we have a word hallelujah that shows us our reality that the United States is going to fail and everything they're going to fall under debt like they are right now trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars behind and they're trying to negotiate what they should do with the debt when we already know what's going to happen see we're living in a reality of faith this thing is so real to us we can walk right up to the pope and say I Know Who You Are you can call yourself Francis Benedict Arnold whatever you want to call yourself but I call you the mark of the beast I know who you are I know what you're gonna do you I know what you're gonna do before you do it and if you don't do it I know what your success is gonna just yeah why because the word of God tells me so that's my reality Church what he told Abraham I will hide nothing from you Hallelujah there's not anything going on church that we don't know about that's who we are that's our reality well let's look at it a little bit more there was a prophet in Israel who knew what was going on in the other parts of the land Hallelujah sold it to a prophet already and if you say well brother brother D that was just a prophet well who pointed him to the prophet it was a hands made it was a little made down there who say I know there's a man down there who can tell you what you stand in need of Hallelujah let's keep moving I'm about to close don't get nervous reality also means resemblance to what is real resemblance to what is real that word resemblance can be kind of tricky because we have a word of resemblance where it says the two will be so close that it can deceive the very elected if possible so that means that there's something out there that resembles my reality what's the difference between them and me I have to live it you have to live it and as you live it it becomes more and more real see you're not really a wife when you say I do you say what you mean I said I do I'm a wife I didn't sign a certificate no there's a definition behind wife there's certain characteristics that come along with that Hallelujah all right well you're not really a husband just because that paper says you're the husband of what makes your husband your characteristics Hallelujah cause you can say your husband and your character says you're a bum grass need to be cut wife tire flat all kind of stuff that a husband is supposed to be taking care of but you say honey I work I work I'll take care of them let's look at this because look at the reality of it what's the reality of it Sarah called Abraham Lord why because that's what she saw earlier that's what he manifest I know a sister brother was preaching I ain't gonna say the name he was preaching and he started yeah what he's called Abraham Sarah call Abraham Lord he said honey you heard that when we got out of church he said no I'm gonna call you by your first name let's just say his name was Patrick your name Patrick bro ain't no lawyer going on up in here you say oh brother D's you cutting up no the only way that men can be Lord is if she makes you Lord you say oh my that's that's kind of heavy brother Dix Hallelujah well how did Jesus Christ become Lord we made him Lord Hallelujah because there were people who saw him and called him bl's above holy so it's a revelation of him that makes him who he is and my reality is he's my Lord my reality is He's My Savior My reality is He's My All In All That's My Reality I'll see you back there Auntie praise God Church but if we look at the seat of Abraham it looked like it was getting away from his reality but no he was walking to it every form of that seed had trial and tribulation now we start with Jacob at the end of his battle Jacob got to a place of panel where he had to wrestle with God so you mean all at trial all them lies all the stuff he ever did all those babies was just to get him to that point the reality of being called a prince the reality with everyone would know that he's no longer a Jacob but he's a prince called of God God even changed his name we're not calling you Israel no more I mean we're not calling you Jacob anymore your name now is Israel that was his reality when he was mixing up the the cattle and and when he was putting Harley a fur on his arms boy that boy went to the extreme to get what his heart desired I wonder what you would do to see the Promise fulfilled in your life because remember all the trickery and all the things Jacob did in that moment was just to receive the blessing yes but in church if we go past Jacob and we go to Joseph more what era more trial more tribulation only to get him where to he was lied on his brothers was envious of them they hated his guts they hated his guts see the law of contrast and I say this all the time you say we don't hear much about saying Lord please give me perfect love you be careful perfect love is the only thing gonna be there right Lord please give me perfect Lord I need perfectly oh Lord please I need perfect love be careful because the only way you're gonna get this you experience perfect hatred and that ain't gonna happen that hatred ain't gonna come from a stranger because it wouldn't affect you Your Love wouldn't be tested it may have to be if we look at the Bible it may have to come from a family member it may come from somebody out of your same household out of the same church somebody that you worship with somebody who's supposed to know what you believe and now they hate your gut so much the way they ready to get rid of you they hate you so much Hallelujah so they're willing to lie on you so they're willing to allow you to be put in jail those are all the things Jacob went through just to get to his reality oh my and when he got there hallelujah what was it it was to run the whole country it was to show his brothers everything you did was just to get me here and that's a man who's appreciative of his reality and then he could look back at his brothers with No Malice no hurt no pain and say hey what y'all thought y'all meant for evil God worked it out for my good and he said look y'all don't have to tell me lies that Daddy said you know don't hurt y'all he's I ain't worried about none of that what y'all did y'all were supposed to do and then he comes and he said to them and I love to say this to people in the action hey brother how you doing everything good I said am I not in the place of God that's what Joseph said his brothers they're worried about their life and all the things that have taken place Joseph says to them am I not in the place of God is this not what God had for me even in all the wrong y'all did let's be careful who we give the credit to too often we go through things and God is making us walk before him and be thou perfect first little trial this ain't nothing but the devil you the devil we give the devil too much credit only thing he can do is what God allows only Power he has is what we confess to him by your imagination and your five senses you give the devil control of situations that don't belong to him I feel like I'm coming down with a Y2K flu be making up stuff and I ain't got nothing against doctors and and nurses and everything but why can't never be a simple name got to be something never heard of something never thought of because it has to look like something that you can't control you have herbal Simplex 97 by eight tenths huh I got what and because you've never heard it before your imagination takes over oh my God I have that oh Lord oh Father please let me oh I need prayer no you just need to say that's not my reality you might see something under your scope but my words see something else it says by your stripes I'm Healed but God is God is so great church this is what I want you to understand God is so great he'll even allow the doctor to see the bruise cells the cedar Bruce cells just to let your confession vanish in a way Hallelujah I believe and know it to be true but church if we wind this on down everybody all right I got about two more I'm about to close church if we look if we go back to the text scriptures of the Chisholm of Israel in the land now let's understand this when they came and saw those grapes they were in the land of the promise they were in their reality but they let the thoughts of their imagination take them out of the land and not want to go back in the land when God gave them the promise of the evidence and look Church they said the grace was so big it took two of them to take them back you know why because they were giants eating Those Grapes and when you go back and read the church the Bible said after 40 days they returned so they were already in the land for 40 days and the Giants didn't do nothing to them then so what made them think that they could live in the land there say it with me they were already in the land they already came and tasted up the land had the evidence of the land walked out of the land came back to Moses and said Moses this is the promise of what God Said what kind of sense that me you're confirming what God Said and then you're going to say I don't believe it foreign that's crazy that's somebody who who needs a 5150 session y'all may not know what that mean that means psychiatric help they need a classic Kanye West section somebody who got so much to offer but don't know what to do with it Church they have the evidence they come back to Moses and say hey they say they come back to Joshua and say look this this is it right here we got it this is it right here everything God surely the land is their words the land is Flowing with milk and honey like God said like God promised now I don't know about y'all but that would that would have charged me up for war they would have stopped calling me brother D's and start calling me Rambo because whatever weapons I had to my uh uh it was in my reach I would have started loading up no matter how big the giant look and they say and the sons of anak were there who cares if God allowed me to taste of the fruit that mean it was mine that's my reality they were holding their reality they were tasting their reality and let their imagination walk them away from me don't let your own desires of unbelief get in the way of your truth so Church they say we don't want to go and then Moses I mean Joshua tries to get the people Joshua Caleb as if God delighted us we're more than able instead of giant in their land we don't want to go and this and that and they complain and complain and complain and God got to the place don't worry I I give somebody else your blessing but it didn't change two people's reality no matter how many peoples walked away from this truth don't let it change your reality because there is a bride Hallelujah that's being washed By the Waters of separation there is a bride who knows she has thus said the Lord there is a bride Hallelujah that believes in Revelations 10 Hallelujah Hallelujah you think I'm talking about seven no I'm talking about one Revelation 10 1 another Mighty angel came down Hallelujah he started the whole thing God came down and started the whole thing Hallelujah he dealt with the prophet and he also dealt with the bride starting at the eighth verse Hallelujah so we're all a part of the reality of God coming down because when he came down he dealt with us as one Hallelujah because he didn't change books the book that he gave the prophet Hallelujah he passed over to us so we have the same reality as Malachi 4. Hallelujah I'll give you another scripture for that one how do you say they that receive a prophet in the name of a prophet have a prophets what Rewards did God comes Hallelujah to the prophet it says because you chose this way which is the harder way there's a large portion of what happened that awaits you Hallelujah so if I chose the same way he chose that means there's a large portion of Heaven that awaits me also Hallelujah don't try to change my reality by putting it on a man no we saw God because if you put it back on a man you're still living in your five senses Hallelujah but Church in closing Abraham the Bible says who believed in Hope he believed in things that he couldn't see as though they were that's who we are everything you stand in need of your eyes may not declare it your ears may not declare it your sins of touch may not declare it but the prophet of God says your faith can go get it make it happen grab a hold of it bring it back to you and make it a reality Hallelujah and that's what it did for Abraham Harley and the Bible says he staggered not oh that means that all the things he was going through King elimelech trying to get his wife he stagger not fighting for lot all those kings he staggered not and we can go on and on and on and on but that Seed of Abraham staggered not at the promises of God you say Brothers I'm going through something real tough you're not staggering you're believing Hallelujah because if you wouldn't believe in you if you didn't gave up by now because I don't know if you really realize the trials in our day and how how are a lot more tougher a lot more harder to believe that God is on our side people have decided to come against the very thing that you believe they know how you worship they know what you worship who you worship where it came from and all that and come back and say I did it with you once upon a time so I know it ain't real don't let that change your reality damn that because when it all boils down to Hallelujah if we look at the reality of the Saints and different things that took place in that moment it didn't look like God was doing something but there was a reality coming forth remember Lazarus died but before he died the Bible says God loved him Hallelujah so you think death was going to change God's love no death Hollywood was going to bring the love of God to him so Dev Hallelujah was the reality of bringing love down whoa oh Hallelujah so Lazarus Hallelujah real reality of death was what proving the resurrection then God called he says Lazarus come forth God allowed death to show The Resurrection oh my and as we look at other things and we say God brought Moses on the scene what was his reality Deliverance and all that walk with Moses experienced the reality of Deliverance if we take Abraham his reality was Jehovah Jireh holy God shall provides for himself let me tell you a story real quick before I get out the way friend of mine he's been here in Arizona brother Robson Steve Robson I was speaking for him and before I spoke for him that weekend before he went deer hunting and you know he loved a good hunt he said he was out there hunting he had to crossbows on about four doors but in his heart he said I want a buck I didn't come out here to shoot no dose he said but they were standing there and it was a tree not a big tree but it was a tree he said they kept going back and forth past the tree back and forth he's sitting there in the grass watching and in his heart he said I want a buck I want a buck Church there may be something in your heart hallelujah it's just marinade I won't I won't I won't but what you gonna do about it you're gonna leave it there oh you're gonna speak it and that's what Steve did he say he said the bus was walking back and forth by the tree and he said he said I know a bucket somewhere so you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna speak it out so while he was laying there oh he could see was four bucks and he said he stood up you know when you stand up they run he said he stood up and yelled hey buck as long as he said that as long as he kept the scope there there never was a book but as soon as he called it by name it appeared as soon as he said hey Buck the buck came from out of nowhere and now it's in his scope so you know what it wasn't a vision he shot and if I would have stayed around a little bit longer I would have had some of that meat I love spoken word meat Hallelujah that's some of the best meat earlier that mean they ain't got no heartburn to it Hallelujah that meat ain't got no pesticides connected to it it's fresh it came fresh out of the mouth of a believer so all they could do is produce Joy and all of a sudden a big a big buck came out where was it it was always there he just had to speak it just like Father Abraham you tell a testimony like that and and most of all you're like church if it happened for Steve it can happen for you you just need to call it out in faith don't let your imagination say it's not there you put it there the prophet of God is a real faith will put it there remember you talking about the knife in his pocket he said if I leave it on the dresser if I need it I'll put it in my pocket and we didn't heard all these stories about communion and they ran out of wine and he prayed Hallelujah in a wine appear I know a brother Hallelujah named Floyd Jenkins I don't know if Floyd's still alive but he was in the tabernacle during those days of older brother he said the anointing was so strong in Church Holy when the anointing came down and everybody stood up he said the first three rows of chairs were levitable now some of y'all are like really if the devil could make a pumpkin float you don't think God can make floating the presence of faith or make a gas float witchcraft can make a death float see the things when it comes to God we let this get in the way the woman with the blood issue her reality was healing rahab's reality was what not prostitution it was salvation Hallelujah oh my you look at you say she had a bad life and all these things it was just to get her to the place where she could meet salvation oh my you say Brothers I'm going through a tough time God's trying to bring you to your reality and once she met up with that her life was changed forever she didn't even know that she was in the lineage of the most high God she didn't even know that she was going to produce a type of Christ and Boaz but that was her reality her reality wasn't Jericho because when God destroyed Jericho he destroyed all of the past in my closing remember that woman in Memphis Tennessee her son was sick come on musicians her son was sick and she raised him in a Christian environment now what is God doing he's testing her faith not only is he testing her faith he's showing her that she's really scripturally placed he's showing her that these characters in the Bible is exactly who you are and her son is singer she said Lord I can't let my baby die like this I can't not the daughters can't not medicine I can't let my baby die see she's speaking with authority now she's back to Genesis 1 26. she's speaking with authority having dominion over everything I can't let my boy die like this so she goes into prayer Hallelujah God gives us a dream and she before she started praying she says Lord I'm just like that shooting Mike and if I'm the pseudomite the reality of that scripture is there has to be an Elijah on this Earth let me ask you something who are you if you find yourself in the scripture where's the rest of it all right it has to be here if God gave you a promise the rest of that promise has to be here and the suit of my says she said the Auntie she says if I'm Hallelujah the shooter might do where's my Elijah Elijah was on the plane didn't even know what was going on but he was connected to what her face faith has its own reality in her faith Hallelujah changed the travels of a prophet just like it did in the Bible Hallelujah remember Jesus was going down to the service house Hallelujah he was going down there to to help the servant of the Centurion Hallelujah but then there was a woman believing and Jesus had to deal with her faith on his way down there and the prophet was going some way Hallelujah but God needed that gift holy to stop off in Memphis Tennessee and the only way he could stop there was through the reality of faith he's still the same God he's still here today her reality was salvation for her son life can seem tough but Lord let the devil dictate your end or your outcome Hallelujah you've been going through it ain't been 25 years yet keep pressing you ain't got no reason to complain yet because Abraham was 25 years Hallelujah and even if he hit 26 that don't mean God's promises change maybe you are going to be the one to rewrite history Hallelujah let's pray let's pray Hallelujah y'all playing touching Jesus let's go let's pray Lord Jesus father we love you we thank you Lord for all your grace and your mercy Lord and all the things that you've done for us Lord and even right now we want to live in the reality of Faith Lord Faith controlling everything in our life Faith being the CEO of the body of the company Lord Lord to bring our eyes Under subjection bring out taste our hearing our touch all these senses that connect us to this world Lord allow our faith to produce the real reality of Who We Are and Lord someone may be going through something in their body but the real reality is to believe in Isaiah 53. they buy Stripes you're already healed you may be got pressures on your mind but we even have a word we say let this thought be in you let this mind be in you help us to think on good things Lord things that are for sure things that are honest Lord you have a word for everything that we may be coming up against Lord we love you so much for that Lord we pray the blessings of the Kingdom upon this church Upon Our

one way [Music] when you call his name did you appreciate the word of the Lord amen this morning you know faith is a I thought about brother Diggs as he was just speaking there and I thought about Jesus when he was touched by that woman who had that blood issue and the prophet of God says that the father had shown him everything but that little woman the Lord he said the father didn't show Jesus that but he said actually that woman by her need operated the gift inside of the Son of God and she reached out with faith and Drew out from the Lord what she needed now I believe that if that little woman could have an issue how many here would say Lord I've got something I need to reach out and touch the Lord Jesus you know faith is beyond human reasoning you heard brother Diggs Preach Today and you might say well that just sounds unreasonable you know brother Brandon says in 1962 in the countdown he's talking about that astronaut now it's easy for us now we've had astronauts John Glenn starting with John Glenn we've had astronauts and NASA missions go to outer space we've got a telescope that'll send us back images but put yourself in the shoes of a person before and prior to any of that Discovery and for someone to say you know what there's something beyond what we see there's something beyond what were our five senses can touch brother Brandon said to that that and that first astronaut and he said he had to have he had to look Beyond his own space to look to what's out of his space and brother Brandon says faith doesn't lay within this space Faith looks beyond into an outer space into something that's beyond what you see you might have a need in your body and I know we got needs here amongst us today and we got brother Diggs here and we're not just going to rush to close this service out I believe the Lord inspired brother Diggs and put a thought upon his heart amen and maybe if you had a need maybe something upon your heart you just want to uh brother Jack
