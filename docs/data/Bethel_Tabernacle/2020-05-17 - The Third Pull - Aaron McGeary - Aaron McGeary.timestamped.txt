[30:58] God you are faithful and true nobody

[31:11] I standing over your lazy

[31:24] God you are faithful and nobody loves me
[31:30] like you hey man praise the Lord we
[31:36] could say man to that
[31:37] nobody loves us like Jesus and I think
[31:40] God has given us the capacity to
[31:42] understand his love though the love of
[31:44] God has misinterpreted misunderstood a
[31:47] lot of people see things God says and
[31:49] things he does and they they have a lot
[31:50] of labels for it but the Bride of Christ
[31:52] she recognizes the love of God is so
[31:54] beautiful if you could turn in your
[31:56] Bibles to Luke chapter 14 I'm gonna
[31:59] begin reading in verse 16 Luke chapter
[32:02] 14 verses 16 to 24 very grateful to be
[32:10] gathered together with you in the house
[32:12] the Lord and I'm sure some of you if
[32:14] this is your first opportunity back in
[32:17] the house the Lord you might feel just
[32:18] as good as I do maybe not as nervous as
[32:21] I am but as good as I do just to be
[32:24] gathered together with believers of
[32:26] precious like faith and we're definitely
[32:28] trusting in we many men of God have been
[32:31] using wisdom and prudence and great you
[32:35] know humility just to follow the
[32:37] leadership of the Lord during times like
[32:38] this asking for his leadership not just
[32:40] guidance from the Department of Health
[32:42] and not just guidance from governments
[32:45] but guidance from the Holy Spirit and I
[32:47] think even though we may be following
[32:49] certain guidelines or certain parameters
[32:51] and we're using wisdom and the way we do
[32:52] things we are at the end of the day
[32:54] trusting in God because except he watch
[32:57] everything we do we're doing it in vain
[32:59] so we just completely trust in the Lord
[33:01] that he's keeping us protecting us
[33:02] guiding us and I believe you're in the
[33:04] place where God wants you to be today so
[33:06] I think there's a protection in that and
[33:07] that God will be with us and bless us
[33:09] and encourage us I thank brother Jason
[33:12] for the opportunity to be here
[33:14] and the invitation and coming and being
[33:16] able to bring my family we love you all
[33:18] very very much and consider ourselves
[33:19] just to be in real tight-knit fellowship
[33:21] with you and your pastor brother Jason
[33:23] and brother Matthew is a real dear
[33:25] friend of mine and we enjoy I enjoy
[33:27] being a put on hold whenever i'm
[33:28] whenever i call him and and just waiting
[33:32] waiting for him to click back over and
[33:34] I've waited dozens of minutes at times
[33:37] because I'm just driving he's like oh
[33:38] you're still there yep I'm still here
[33:40] and says so you'll always have that on
[33:42] me say I get brother Aaron will wait
[33:44] hours for me on hold but but and I'm not
[33:48] I'll I nod and but we love brother
[33:50] Matthew and his family and really really
[33:52] appreciate the opportunity to get to
[33:53] know brother Jason to Mars as he's moved
[33:56] here and it's a great blessing to have
[33:58] such tremendously gifted ministry and
[34:00] teaching and the different gifts you
[34:02] have in your miss God really loves you
[34:04] and has gifted you all very much with
[34:06] the tremendous ministries you have so I
[34:08] have a greater edge of nervousness on me
[34:10] knowing the the men of God that stand
[34:12] behind this desk and are able to rightly
[34:15] divide the word of truth and then
[34:16] finding out where the Kaji was here on
[34:17] Wednesday I'm like I'm set up for
[34:19] failure because the the greats have been
[34:21] through here already so we appreciate
[34:23] the opportunity to be here Luke chapter
[34:25] 14 and verse 16 it says then said he
[34:29] unto Him
[34:30] a certain man made a great supper in
[34:33] bade many and sent his servant at supper
[34:36] time to say to them that were bidden
[34:37] come for all things are now ready and
[34:40] they all with one consent begin to make
[34:43] excuse the first sent unto Him I've
[34:45] bought a piece of ground and I must need
[34:46] to go and see it I pray thee have me
[34:49] excused and there's a lot of just in the
[34:53] excuse there's a lot of things that begs
[34:54] the question why did you why did you buy
[34:56] a piece of ground you never saw before
[34:57] and so there's these are things that
[34:59] just it shows that they really weren't
[35:01] interested in the feast and it says and
[35:04] another said I've bought five yoke of
[35:06] oxen and I go to prove them I pray thee
[35:09] have me excused and again there's a
[35:11] weakness in the excuse because it's
[35:14] almost as if this isn't really true this
[35:15] isn't a real-world scenario the
[35:17] invitation didn't really matter to them
[35:19] and another said I have married a wife
[35:23] and therefore I cannot come now that
[35:25] might sound plausible and so that
[35:28] servant
[35:28] came and showed his Lord these things in
[35:30] the master of the house being angry said
[35:32] to servant go out quickly into the
[35:34] streets and lanes of the city and bring
[35:36] in hither the poor and the main and the
[35:38] halt in the blind and the servant said
[35:41] Lord it is done as thou has commanded
[35:43] and yet there is room and the Lord said
[35:46] to the servant go out into the highways
[35:48] and hedges and compel them to come in
[35:50] that my house may be filled for I say
[35:54] unto you that none of those men which
[35:57] were bidden shall taste of my supper
[35:59] none of those that were bidden and
[36:00] refused the invitation will taste of my
[36:03] supper we could bow our heads in a word
[36:05] of Prayer
[36:06] Heavenly Father were so happy to be
[36:08] gathered together today and this a
[36:10] beautiful part of the country Lord and
[36:12] you know and with beautiful people Lord
[36:15] and with a great character even within
[36:16] these four walls and knowing that
[36:19] there's a people that are faithfully
[36:20] taught even just as many as are here
[36:22] this more this morning in this church
[36:25] there's maybe two to three times
[36:27] streaming online right now and Lord we
[36:29] pray that your Holy Spirit would just
[36:31] come and minister to each heart to those
[36:34] who are streaming with their families
[36:35] those who are in different circumstances
[36:37] viewing the service or listening may the
[36:40] Holy Spirit be their portion and may you
[36:42] take this Bread of Life father and
[36:44] impart it to us that it might draws
[36:46] closer to you and do as only you can
[36:48] Father bring it make it alive to them by
[36:51] revelation and make quicken something
[36:53] inside of them to a further deeper walk
[36:55] with you we committed to you in the name
[36:57] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen he may be
[37:00] seated my title is many came and few
[37:05] stayed and I could have titled it many
[37:09] came but few stayed but I didn't I
[37:11] didn't even want there to be a negative
[37:13] in that it's just the reality of it it's
[37:16] many came and a few stayed and my I've
[37:21] been pondering just quite a bit lately
[37:25] on the third pull and I know that's a
[37:28] terminology that's very familiar with
[37:30] message believers and if you're if
[37:32] you're not familiar with it and that
[37:35] you've been in the message a long time
[37:36] maybe you're just not reading enough or
[37:38] listening enough but if you knew if
[37:41] you're new
[37:41] to the message that even the terminology
[37:43] third pool might sound a little bit
[37:45] different I've even had some people
[37:47] testify that when they first heard about
[37:49] the seven seals they weren't sure where
[37:51] the RAM was talking about you know an
[37:52] animal or talking about somebody who's a
[37:54] you know a Navy SEAL and there's like
[37:57] what what are the seven seals and so
[37:59] there's some terminology that escaped us
[38:01] some time but I think this terminology
[38:03] is familiar with this third Pole and it
[38:06] is it is connected with brother
[38:07] branham's ministry and you cannot
[38:09] separate it it's something that's so
[38:11] connected with his ministry and I've
[38:13] been pondering it studying it thinking
[38:14] about it from different perspectives and
[38:16] I just want to make a few statements in
[38:18] the beginning maybe just a lay a
[38:19] foundation for what's in my heart to
[38:22] impress or what's been impressed upon my
[38:24] heart I believe it's in 1956 but at the
[38:28] very very beginning of the year January
[38:29] first preaches why are people still
[38:31] tossed about and that's where the even
[38:32] the terminology of the 1st 2nd and 3rd
[38:35] pull is introduced or three pulls are
[38:37] introduced and it stood out to me
[38:39] recently when I was looking at it that
[38:40] it was actually the language of the aims
[38:42] of the Lord that introduces the the 1st
[38:45] 3rd 2nd and 3rd pulls it's not something
[38:47] brother Branham gleaned from it or used
[38:50] himself but it's actually the angel of
[38:52] the Lord it that gives that this meaning
[38:55] or this language to us the angel the
[38:57] Lord gave brother Branham about these
[38:58] pulls in his ministry and there it's
[39:01] mentioned by brother Branham quite often
[39:03] is in the sermon is this the sign of the
[39:06] end serve seven thunders that are going
[39:09] to bring back the headstone and he
[39:11] connects he makes the statement the
[39:13] mystery that would open up that would
[39:15] bring Christ bring a power to the church
[39:18] and he talks about how it's for these
[39:20] people gathered that it'll bring them to
[39:22] a rapture in faith and so he's making a
[39:25] connection with the third pole with the
[39:27] revelation of the seven thunders which
[39:28] would be that and he's ending the year
[39:30] with a lot of questions about the third
[39:33] pole about revelations 10 even about his
[39:35] own ministry and then the third pole
[39:37] comes into greater focus when brother
[39:39] Brandon preaches the seven seals and he
[39:42] starts to connect things a little bit
[39:43] more tightly and bring it into
[39:45] present-day manifestation in question
[39:48] and answers on the seals he says if you
[39:49] can understand it this is that third
[39:52] Pole and
[39:53] and that brings us to we're no longer
[39:55] questioning whether it will be and we're
[39:57] no longer thinking that its future but
[40:00] he's saying what's taking place right
[40:01] now if you can understand it this is
[40:04] that third pull and then he says you
[40:06] should have caught that the other day
[40:08] and so then you start feeling a little
[40:09] bit guilty wow I didn't really catch
[40:12] that the other day so he says if you can
[40:13] understand it this is that third pull
[40:16] you should have caught that the other
[40:17] day he says you remember and then he
[40:19] gives us some more a characteristics of
[40:21] the third Pole he says they'll be no
[40:23] impersonation like there was of the
[40:25] other two and in that regional original
[40:28] vision that brother Branham had that he
[40:29] expresses and why are people so tossed
[40:31] about how he's fishing and then he's
[40:34] lacing that bootie and the angel Lord
[40:36] says you've tried to explain it and you
[40:39] and you've gave him too much try to
[40:40] explanation to it and he's caused carnal
[40:42] impersonations of even the first pool in
[40:44] the second pool and and brother Branham
[40:47] is telling us that now he's being told
[40:48] that this one you can't fail in this one
[40:50] there'll be no impersonations of it like
[40:53] there were the other two so you cannot
[40:55] impersonate the third pool like you can
[40:57] the first and the second then when he's
[41:00] preaching the Seventh Seal he says this
[41:01] is one thing he cannot in person he's
[41:03] talking about Satan like there was and
[41:06] he says they'll be known mimics to this
[41:08] because he don't know it so if you don't
[41:10] know it you can't impersonate him
[41:11] there's no way for him to know it
[41:13] it's the third pull he just knows
[41:16] nothing about it he doesn't understand
[41:19] it now is he
[41:21] Amen to the head as he come and as he
[41:23] comes to this place in his team
[41:25] preaching on the seventh seal if you're
[41:28] reading it in the table and at least the
[41:30] version that I utilized it worthy and
[41:32] they published this the the editor
[41:35] writes brother Branham originally had
[41:36] the tape stopped here he put in a
[41:39] different ending which he recorded on
[41:41] Monday morning so after he preaches the
[41:43] seventh seal he feels as if he said too
[41:46] much now he feels that way because the
[41:49] third pull is basically connected with
[41:52] the seventh seal and he's been told
[41:54] don't say too much about the third pull
[41:56] you've made this mistake in the past so
[41:59] now when he's preaching the seventh seal
[42:00] after he preaches that he thinks oh my
[42:03] goodness have I gone and done with the
[42:05] first and the third what I did with the
[42:06] first
[42:07] second and he actually goes I believe it
[42:09] was in a hotel room and he records and I
[42:11] may be mistaken about that but he
[42:13] records a different ending to the tape
[42:16] so when they published the tape or
[42:17] released the tape it's a different
[42:19] recording and then what he's actually
[42:21] preached when he preaches the Seventh
[42:23] Seal but this is what he begins to say
[42:25] right after he says that he doesn't
[42:27] understand it he says but there's a
[42:29] secret lays beneath that so there's
[42:32] something on the surface that maybe
[42:34] people can see and there's things that
[42:35] people can describe and maybe there's a
[42:37] language that people could use but it's
[42:39] the secret that lays beneath that so if
[42:41] you're if you're looking at something to
[42:42] say oh oh I see this and I see that
[42:44] you're describing a mountain and you're
[42:46] describing the peak and you're
[42:47] describing everything but then on the
[42:48] inside of that underneath that there's a
[42:50] secret that he can't see that he doesn't
[42:52] know he said there's a secret that lays
[42:54] beneath that glory to God in the highest
[42:56] I can never think the same the rest of
[42:59] my life when I sing and then he stops
[43:01] and I'd had it in in the notes here and
[43:05] I just began to just take things out
[43:06] because I realized I'm trying to get two
[43:08] months of preaching and in one service
[43:10] and and so I took a whole lot out I'll
[43:13] just save it for some other time but
[43:14] even when he's preaching there in
[43:16] question and answers I believe on the
[43:18] seals or maybe the Seventh Seal
[43:19] he said he's wanting to express he goes
[43:21] well it's just but it son well you just
[43:25] live simple why because he's wanting
[43:27] just to say it there's something inside
[43:28] him that wants to express it and tell it
[43:30] he says I could never be the same the
[43:32] rest of my life when I seen he goes I
[43:33] know the next step there but I don't
[43:35] know what how to interpret that it won't
[43:37] be long I've got wrote down here when it
[43:39] happened if you can see here stop go no
[43:43] further than this right here so brother
[43:46] Branham actually has written in his
[43:47] notes top go no further than this right
[43:50] here and he talks about how there's this
[43:53] third part that hasn't been revealed or
[43:55] made known yet he says but I believe
[43:56] it's moving into that cycle and I
[43:59] believe that we would be doing the
[44:00] message of disservice if we just stayed
[44:02] within the context of that language that
[44:04] it's unknown but realized brother
[44:06] Branham felt it was so imminent that it
[44:09] was moving into a particular cycle where
[44:11] that mystery would be revealed but he's
[44:14] constrained because he can't just say
[44:16] now remember that unwritten thing that
[44:18] unknown thing that language we couldn't
[44:19] interpret here
[44:20] the interpretation of it so I could tell
[44:22] you brother man is going to be careful
[44:24] so as to not explain something that is
[44:27] supposed to be a mystery that Satan
[44:29] doesn't know about it's better man even
[44:31] says if Satan God got a hold of this he
[44:33] could cause great damage say well how is
[44:35] that that doesn't make sense
[44:36] Paul even says that had the princes of
[44:38] this world knew what that Jesus was a
[44:41] sacrifice then they wouldn't have
[44:43] crucified him so it's it's not a mystery
[44:46] to us that there could be something that
[44:47] God has to protect because the Satan got
[44:50] ahold of it he could do great damage
[44:51] because he's actually saying had they
[44:53] fully recognized the office of a lamb in
[44:55] his first coming then they would not
[44:57] have crucified the Lord of glory so he
[44:59] says stop go no further than this right
[45:02] here and then he refers specifically to
[45:05] he calls it what time is it sirs and he
[45:08] says do you remember that and it begins
[45:10] to bring back into view the vision that
[45:11] he had of the constellation of angels
[45:13] and then he begins to tell the tenth
[45:15] vision of this very vision that brings
[45:17] into view the the first pull the second
[45:19] pull in the third pull and he talks
[45:21] about how the the first point is even
[45:23] contacting with the flesh you take a
[45:25] hold of their hand there'd be certain
[45:26] vibrations and I've been in joy as a
[45:29] family we're going through the
[45:30] supernatural series and reading it
[45:31] together my wife with the children and
[45:33] and and I'm able to her to take part in
[45:35] it and hear it it's nice just to hear
[45:38] these things told in a way where you can
[45:39] create this picture of what was
[45:41] transpiring but then the second pull he
[45:42] would could discern things in their
[45:43] spirit and experiences that he had but
[45:46] then this third pole was something
[45:47] completely different
[45:49] symbolized in a completely different way
[45:50] wouldn't be a public show all these
[45:53] things that brother Branham says about
[45:54] it and he tells the tenth vision and
[45:56] then he makes this statement and that in
[45:59] that vision where I'll meet you there
[46:01] this will be the third pull and you
[46:03] won't tell it to nobody so he has this
[46:05] thing as Mike don't tell it to anybody
[46:07] whatever you do don't tell it to anybody
[46:09] but he wanted he has to say something
[46:11] because the the third pole it speaks for
[46:14] itself so it does speak it's got to
[46:17] express something but he's very careful
[46:19] not to explain it or over explain it so
[46:22] he says this will be the third pole and
[46:23] you won't tell to nobody brother missus
[46:25] and in Sabina Kenyon he said this is the
[46:28] third pole so we do not use the language
[46:31] that keeps the third pole in some sort
[46:33] of
[46:34] in state where we're not sure what it is
[46:36] and what will come of it but we know
[46:38] that the angel Lord said in 1956 it was
[46:41] this will be the third pool but now when
[46:44] he's preaching the Seventh Seal and
[46:45] these events that have transpired it is
[46:47] now this is the third pool and we should
[46:50] have enough there as brother Branham
[46:52] said if you can understand it this is
[46:53] that third pool you should have caught
[46:55] that the other day we've now have enough
[46:57] - we can say with the surety that the
[47:00] third pool is we contained within the
[47:02] revelation of these seven seals and
[47:04] connected specifically with the seventh
[47:06] seal and we'd say this is the third
[47:09] point so we'll explain it to me diagram
[47:11] it for me tell me all about it you might
[47:13] be able to say well I can't explain it
[47:14] to you I'm not quite sure exactly all
[47:16] that it means but it's connected with
[47:18] that and he says basically the language
[47:21] of it is basically the seventh seal is
[47:22] everything talks about it's a revelation
[47:25] that unfolds like a roman candle he said
[47:27] it's the end of all things
[47:28] so things that unfold into that seventh
[47:31] seal we just don't pin down it well
[47:32] right there March 1963 is the end of the
[47:34] seventh seal no this is the opening of
[47:36] it and things begin to unfold and just
[47:38] cascade forward from there
[47:40] so with those little things maybe kind
[47:43] of scattered out there they might be
[47:45] just puzzle pieces laying around and and
[47:48] you might need to put them together the
[47:49] Holy Spirit do it for you
[47:51] in in those things I realized that I've
[47:53] been under such a pull from your prayers
[47:56] and your expectation and your desire for
[47:59] the Word of God I found myself putting
[48:01] pieces of the puzzle together and
[48:02] wanting to do the whole puzzle today and
[48:04] I was you know I'll just put some pieces
[48:06] together for him and let the let the
[48:08] Holy Spirit come behind it as long as
[48:10] we're still carrying here before the
[48:12] meeting there and I won't try to put
[48:13] together the whole puzzle for the
[48:14] rapture in just one afternoon and
[48:16] there's your clue that I'm gonna go at
[48:18] least another five minutes and get into
[48:19] the afternoon now so to understand we
[48:23] use third Pole third Pole were using
[48:24] this terminology this language out to
[48:27] kind of understand what is meant by
[48:28] third Pole I felt directed to use Luke
[48:32] chapter 14 verses 16 to 24 and so I want
[48:36] to do this very quickly and not read it
[48:38] again necessarily because what's
[48:40] described here gives us insight into
[48:41] what a pull means and now with the
[48:45] things I've mentioned thus far and then
[48:47] also the
[48:47] understanding that you have on the
[48:49] teachings that you've received before
[48:50] think about all the things that brother
[48:52] Bannerman associates with the third pole
[48:54] this is the third pool now think about I
[48:58] want you to think about what a pull is
[49:00] and when he says this is what it is
[49:02] think about what a pool is and this
[49:04] scripture helps us to understand what a
[49:06] what a pull is and in verse 16 as we
[49:09] read in Luke chapter 14 verse 60 says
[49:11] then he said unto him a certain man he
[49:14] said unto him a certain man a great made
[49:16] a great supper and bade many and bade he
[49:20] bade it means he invited or called many
[49:22] so many have been invited many have
[49:24] called to a great supper and brother
[49:27] Branham uses the scripture reading that
[49:29] we read to you in our text and he says
[49:31] this in the message is your life worthy
[49:33] of the gospel this is June 30th 1963 so
[49:36] he has this vocabulary he has this
[49:39] language that the aims of the Lord has
[49:41] given him about first pull second pull
[49:43] this will be the first pull of your
[49:44] ministry and then third pull this is a
[49:46] language that he's familiar with so when
[49:48] he uses this terminology in June of 1963
[49:51] it gives us he's gonna give us
[49:53] understanding to even what the age of
[49:56] the Lord meant when it used this phrase
[49:58] he says and did you notice Luke reading
[50:00] in Luke chapter 14
[50:01] there was three pulls or three turns of
[50:05] it so there was three different turns
[50:06] and he calls them pulls he says when
[50:09] they went out first and called to them
[50:11] that were forbidden to come and they
[50:13] didn't do it there's your first turn or
[50:15] your first pull what was the first pull
[50:17] it was actually a bidding it was a means
[50:20] of welcoming or inviting people getting
[50:22] their attention and and it was a way of
[50:24] inviting because there was something you
[50:26] needed to come to there was something
[50:28] significant that was going to be
[50:29] transpiring and happening he says and
[50:31] they didn't do it so their win a healing
[50:33] campaign and went out to get the blind
[50:35] and halt and still there was room so II
[50:39] now it enters into a different phase he
[50:42] says now there's another bidding or
[50:44] another calling another turn and it's in
[50:46] the form of a healing campaign that's to
[50:48] draw people or call people to the
[50:51] wedding supper to this marriage supper
[50:54] and I know that we use the terminology
[50:56] wedding supper referring to a meeting in
[50:59] the air and a future supper but there's
[51:00] also an application um even spiritually
[51:04] to us now and to brother branham's
[51:06] ministry and the feast that he is
[51:07] spreading for the bride
[51:09] just as then there was room so he went
[51:11] out and compelled the good bad and
[51:13] indifferent that they should come in and
[51:15] so program says there there are three
[51:17] pulls in this scripture and I'm using
[51:20] this not to try to get real rigid on
[51:22] first second and third pull of brother
[51:23] branham's ministry but rather the
[51:24] language that he's using to say that
[51:28] there is a draw or there's an invitation
[51:30] or a bidding that the third pull is so
[51:33] the first pull is a an initial welcome
[51:35] an initial invite an initial pull
[51:37] something to get your attention and a
[51:39] sign oh my what what is this I'm
[51:41] attracted to something and then the
[51:43] second pole it has another bidding
[51:45] another drawing even it may be a
[51:46] different way to call people together he
[51:49] says now when he says this is the third
[51:51] pull there's an aspect to that third
[51:53] pull where it's inviting and it's
[51:55] drawing and it's pulling that's what it
[51:57] is it's a third pull its tugging on
[51:59] something so he says this is the third
[52:02] pull he's saying these things that are
[52:03] happening this is the draw this is the
[52:07] attraction this is what this is where
[52:10] God is now inviting he's not necessarily
[52:12] inviting through first please not
[52:13] necessarily inviting through second
[52:15] after the second pull this is now this
[52:17] final in full and complete drawing and
[52:20] attraction and so the first pull let me
[52:25] just I read it in the scripture down
[52:28] because a full of pull is a means of
[52:30] getting attention or drawing people a
[52:31] turn a call a bidding he's saying it's
[52:33] invitation and in verse 23 says in the
[52:36] Lord said unto the servant go out into
[52:38] the highways and hedges and it stood out
[52:40] to me to her now it's not so much
[52:42] bidding you who were invited comments
[52:45] now time because that's the kind of the
[52:46] language of it you remember you were
[52:48] invited now it's time to come and then
[52:50] we'll go find the Hult the people who
[52:51] would really be happy to be sitting at a
[52:52] table go find them
[52:54] but now it's different he goes to the
[52:55] highways and hedges and says and compel
[52:58] them to come that my house may be filled
[53:00] so now it's a compelling it's not just
[53:03] an invitation you who were invited would
[53:04] you now come those who are sick and
[53:06] needy would you now come now it so this
[53:08] this this move that goes throughout
[53:10] highways and hedges and go out
[53:12] everywhere brimmer's
[53:13] the good the bad the indifferent and
[53:14] compel which means to necessitate them
[53:17] got to drive to whether by force or any
[53:20] other means but compel them drum it be a
[53:23] strong drawing power upon him and compel
[53:26] them to come and the reason for this
[53:29] strong drawl this strong compelling he
[53:31] says that my house may be filled and
[53:33] it's because he has a certain number of
[53:36] this just inspires me he has a table set
[53:40] and he knows who's gonna be seated in
[53:42] those seats and so now he's compelling
[53:45] you've got a place at this table now is
[53:48] your time to come because my table will
[53:51] be for I have a number in mind I have a
[53:55] predestinated gathering I have an elect
[53:58] it's gonna sit at this table and feast
[54:00] and now I'm compelling you this is my
[54:02] compelling so that my table will be
[54:05] satisfied it will be completed it will
[54:08] be furnished and then he says for I say
[54:13] verse 24 for I say unto you that none of
[54:15] those men which were bidden which had
[54:17] been invited that were asked to come
[54:19] which didn't shall taste of my supper
[54:23] now III want to lay this in and this was
[54:27] going to be maybe the direction that I
[54:29] found myself just opening up to where I
[54:32] realized well there's just no way in the
[54:33] world you can preach that in three hours
[54:35] so I had to I had to tell it turn it
[54:37] kind of scaled it back a little bit and
[54:40] I mean maybe if they're worried and
[54:43] nervous they'll just start pulling
[54:44] harder the harder you pull the faster I
[54:46] preach and the quicker we'll be eating
[54:47] chicken I this is how when he says this
[54:53] that none of these men which were
[54:55] finished out taste of my supper notice
[54:57] this judgment that comes this cutting
[54:59] off that this declaration that just
[55:02] divides now I asked you to come you
[55:03] didn't say now you're condemned this is
[55:06] how the third pull in one census to the
[55:08] eternally lost because they reject the
[55:11] word and once they reject the word it
[55:12] becomes judgment the very thing that was
[55:15] your mercy because he's asking you to
[55:17] come if you refuse that the very same
[55:19] invitation becomes judgment so it's not
[55:22] it's not for lack of mercy it's the lack
[55:25] of a call in
[55:26] the heart of the person to receive it
[55:28] when it's offered because if you reject
[55:30] the pardon if you reject the offer you
[55:33] reject the invitation it becomes
[55:34] judgment and so it cannot be mercy it
[55:38] cannot remain mercy if it's spurned or
[55:40] if it's rejected then it becomes
[55:42] judgment and so rather we can look at
[55:44] this in this sense the first pool even
[55:46] in brother Brennan's ministry attracts
[55:47] many different people and through the
[55:50] hearing the sign and the great campaigns
[55:52] that followed the second pool attracts
[55:54] meaning and now with the momentum of the
[55:57] first pool and now with the second pool
[55:58] not only does it attract many but it
[56:00] also attracts the sceptics it attracts
[56:03] the critics and that's why brother BAM
[56:04] says there was a rebuke in that second
[56:06] pool and and he talks about how that
[56:08] there was a he condemned their
[56:10] organizations and that what's really
[56:12] begin to rile some of them up so there's
[56:13] a rebuke and a correction that comes
[56:15] with that second Pole
[56:17] but the third pool is in part to the
[56:20] eternally lost because it is rejected by
[56:23] those who go into the tribulation and so
[56:26] there's a there's a call that goes out
[56:28] to everyone to highways and hedges and
[56:30] the good the bad then different and
[56:32] there's a compelling that goes on and
[56:33] I'm saying this because installs in
[56:35] prison now brother branham saying could
[56:37] it be that this third pulls to the
[56:38] eternally lost and he identifies him
[56:41] brother breton in jesus's ministry that
[56:43] his third pull was when he went to the
[56:44] souls in hell and preached to the
[56:45] eternal loss those who couldn't be saved
[56:48] now we're brother branham's standing
[56:49] he's going my goodness with what's
[56:51] happened could it be now the third pull
[56:55] is to the eternally lost and it is
[56:57] because there's those that will be here
[56:59] in it he's preaching it preached in
[57:01] christ as the mystery of God revealed
[57:03] preaching all these different things
[57:04] here's your life worthy of the gospel
[57:05] and these different sermons and and
[57:07] there's a not a drawing power there's
[57:10] not people being attracted to that he's
[57:11] getting more criticism criticism just
[57:13] thousands of my friends will leave me
[57:15] when I say this and so he's wondering
[57:18] now what's being manifested what's being
[57:20] preached is it to people who can never
[57:21] come in and he says this though in souls
[57:25] that are in prison now it's the
[57:27] predestinated Church I'm talking to not
[57:31] those out there no sir out of every
[57:33] group he's pulled his predestinated so
[57:36] he said I'm not preaching to the
[57:38] and I preached into the church even
[57:40] though the third pull is to the lost the
[57:42] church and the bride that's not who I'm
[57:44] preaching to what but he's recognizing
[57:46] that his message to the elect
[57:48] has consequences for everyone else
[57:51] because it's no longer in an ecumenical
[57:53] sense we're just you know it just stay
[57:56] where you are remain as you are we just
[57:58] love Jesus isn't he a good God but now
[58:00] he's realized that this has become a
[58:02] razor's edge this has become a
[58:04] difference I'm going to I'm preaching
[58:06] the indictment I'm in dining this
[58:08] generation for the second crucifixion of
[58:10] Lord Jesus Christ could it be now that
[58:12] this generation in this age has been
[58:14] indicted for crucifying the word again
[58:17] could it be that they're all condemned
[58:19] and lost says but my message isn't
[58:21] necessarily to them it's to the
[58:23] predestinated he's pulled his he's
[58:26] pulled he has predestinated so the third
[58:29] poll has a different meaning for the
[58:31] elect the third poll has a a different a
[58:34] different ramification if I could save
[58:36] that for the bride it has a different
[58:38] effect for the bride the effect of the
[58:41] third poem the bride is different than
[58:42] the effect it has on everyone else that
[58:44] the purpose of the third poll the
[58:46] purpose of the compelling the purpose of
[58:48] the drawing is different for the bride
[58:50] than it is everyone else because think
[58:53] about the tone of souls in prison now
[58:56] it's a lot of could it be brother Rams
[59:01] he's looking at things that are
[59:03] happening and I'll say this and this is
[59:05] weren't to me it just oh it just blows
[59:06] up and I want to be very careful just
[59:09] how much I say here cuz it was at this
[59:11] point I realize I've got to leave that
[59:12] aside to stay focused on I'm what the
[59:14] Lord's really burdened me with here when
[59:16] brother Brandon preaches souls in prison
[59:18] now you can see that it has a connection
[59:21] with is this the sign of the in sir
[59:23] because when brother Graham preaches is
[59:25] this the sign of the end sir he brings
[59:28] up all these different things that he's
[59:29] wondering if it could be revelations
[59:31] Qian and a third Pole and the seventh
[59:32] seal and all these different things and
[59:33] he's like this is the end it's over
[59:36] after that we're going to be going home
[59:38] we're out of here
[59:40] and there's an excitement and
[59:42] anticipation about what's going to
[59:43] happen now when he preaches the seals he
[59:46] connects it with us as it's been what I
[59:48] saw and is this the side of the insert'
[59:50] when I was preaching
[59:51] these questions I had about the thunders
[59:53] it's now revealed in the seals we have
[59:55] now preached what this was foreshadowing
[59:57] and telling us to look for this is it
[1:00:00] then as the days unfold in the weeks
[1:00:02] unfold in the months unfold he's
[1:00:04] thinking we're still here so if this is
[1:00:07] the fulfillment of that which was the
[1:00:09] end and we're still here could it be fit
[1:00:12] now what's happening is judgment to
[1:00:15] those who can never be saved and he saw
[1:00:18] he's now he's now preaching souls in
[1:00:20] prison now from the standpoint of not
[1:00:23] could it be the seven seals could it be
[1:00:25] the third Pole but now he's preaching
[1:00:27] from the standpoint since we know it is
[1:00:29] the seventh seal that's open since we
[1:00:32] know the mighty angel himself has
[1:00:33] descended since we know this is the
[1:00:35] third pull in all these ideas and
[1:00:38] understands we have in these perceptions
[1:00:39] we had of what would take place when it
[1:00:41] happened could it be that now that we're
[1:00:43] still here and this has in fact happened
[1:00:46] the lamb has in fact taken the book
[1:00:48] could it be that this is the consequence
[1:00:51] so he's preaching more from the
[1:00:53] standpoint of questions what are the
[1:00:55] ramifications now what's the fallout
[1:00:58] from this happening and he and he's
[1:01:00] connecting it with that is this the sign
[1:01:02] of the in sir and in my you listen how
[1:01:05] brother bear agonizes I still have loved
[1:01:07] ones out there I just have children that
[1:01:10] needed to come in and the the altar call
[1:01:13] I remember when I first listened to this
[1:01:15] sermon when I was in college after I had
[1:01:17] been begin to serve the Lord and spilt
[1:01:18] the Holy Ghost I would listen to the
[1:01:20] message on my way to school and I
[1:01:22] remember I had to listen to souls in
[1:01:24] prison now three four or five times
[1:01:26] before I could come to a peace with it
[1:01:29] because if you listen to you just listen
[1:01:30] in to that you'd be troubled you'd be at
[1:01:32] the altar like they were wailing and
[1:01:34] crying and screaming oh my god where are
[1:01:36] we at what's the time we're living in
[1:01:38] his the door shot is there no more mercy
[1:01:40] because it was very very very heavy
[1:01:42] though to tone of what he was preaching
[1:01:44] could it be the third pulls being
[1:01:46] preached to the eternally lost and we're
[1:01:48] sitting here well what does that say
[1:01:49] about me but listen to what brother
[1:01:52] Branham says at the end of this this is
[1:01:53] paragraph 404 I'm souls in prison now
[1:01:55] what if it's over what if it is over
[1:02:00] what if the third pole coming up now is
[1:02:03] to preach to the Lost
[1:02:05] what if all the types are going to show
[1:02:07] forth now and then he says and we're in
[1:02:10] and we're in wouldn't that be wonderful
[1:02:13] what a fellowship hallelujah see to
[1:02:17] those who are lost to those who are
[1:02:19] eternally lost it is a very careful
[1:02:22] thing but now brother Browns looking at
[1:02:23] it from a different perspective he says
[1:02:25] oh my goodness what if this third pulls
[1:02:27] the two the eternally lost and he goes
[1:02:29] and we're in we're here we're under it
[1:02:33] we're hearing it weren't believing he
[1:02:35] says isn't that wonderful - he says
[1:02:38] we're in what are we in we're in Christ
[1:02:40] we're in the open of the word we've seen
[1:02:43] him fulfilling his word in this last day
[1:02:45] we caught the revelation we're
[1:02:47] fellowship and in these mysteries we're
[1:02:49] in isn't that wonderful
[1:02:52] praise the Lord right because this third
[1:02:55] pool has a different meaning to the
[1:02:56] elect so the bride is drawn by some
[1:03:00] other force than what draws the church
[1:03:02] the bride has draw a drawn by some of
[1:03:05] the force than what draws the world
[1:03:06] because our drawing power is not natural
[1:03:09] or national the force that works upon
[1:03:14] the bride is neither natural nor
[1:03:15] national the force that works upon the
[1:03:18] bride is the Spirit of God which is his
[1:03:20] word that's pushing the bride up and
[1:03:23] will force her into a new body to a
[1:03:25] meeting in the air brother Branham said
[1:03:27] it's national force that put the Jews
[1:03:29] back in their homeland it's national
[1:03:31] ecumenical force that puts those
[1:03:32] churches in the world council of
[1:03:34] churches the world forces this way the
[1:03:35] world forces that way but God by His
[1:03:37] Word is moving us upward and it's the
[1:03:40] spirit that puts the person in the bride
[1:03:42] it's the spirit that places the bride of
[1:03:44] Jesus Christ
[1:03:45] so the third pull is the power upon the
[1:03:47] bride to produce in her what God sees in
[1:03:50] her and I want to say this was just an
[1:03:54] absolute Nastasia lect you are attracted
[1:04:02] to the word and distracted by the world
[1:04:05] when the world seems to draw on you and
[1:04:08] I say this to the young men the young
[1:04:09] ladies and and whoever would be
[1:04:11] listening when you're drawn to
[1:04:13] things of the world when you're drawn to
[1:04:14] tick-tock videos when you're drawn to
[1:04:17] things on the web when you're drawn to
[1:04:18] sports and you're drawn to all these
[1:04:20] other things when you're drawn to
[1:04:21] something you're starting to do the
[1:04:22] dance moves right now in your head when
[1:04:24] you and you're drawn to it and you say
[1:04:26] well I really like it and I find this
[1:04:28] really really neat and I want to do
[1:04:30] something fun like that and you feel
[1:04:32] like it's something that compels you
[1:04:33] it's something that you're tied to or
[1:04:35] attracted to I want to say to our young
[1:04:37] sisters our young brothers and anyone
[1:04:39] that would be listening to this that's
[1:04:41] not what you're attracted to that's what
[1:04:43] you're struck distracted by because you
[1:04:46] are attracted to the word your
[1:04:48] attraction is Christ you're only
[1:04:50] distracted by that yeah it hasn't drawn
[1:04:53] you but as a distraction but this
[1:04:55] message is your first and true love your
[1:04:57] first attraction and I want to say this
[1:05:01] regardless of the older there are
[1:05:03] intermediate distractions ultimately the
[1:05:05] bride will not be distracted from where
[1:05:08] she is attracted to
[1:05:10] she will not ultimately be distracted
[1:05:13] from her mate the revealed word because
[1:05:16] there's a greater pull upon her than of
[1:05:19] the first ball which is on the flesh
[1:05:21] alone there is a greater pull upon her
[1:05:24] than that of the second pull which is in
[1:05:25] the spirit realm there is a draw upon
[1:05:28] her in her soul where there is a
[1:05:30] connection and an invisible union with
[1:05:32] Christ in Matthew chapter 22 verses 2 to
[1:05:38] 14 the kingdom of heaven is likened unto
[1:05:40] a certain King we're looking at this as
[1:05:43] an example of a bidding and a rejection
[1:05:46] of the bidding and how that there's many
[1:05:50] that can be invited many that get the
[1:05:51] attention is is gained initially so as
[1:05:55] the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a
[1:05:56] certain King remember brother BAM says
[1:05:57] that way he had oh he's there somebody
[1:05:59] came to lift his hands up her sword came
[1:06:01] into his hand and he said a sword and
[1:06:04] the Lord was like no not a sword the
[1:06:06] Kings sword and he was afraid of it but
[1:06:10] when he had that that sword in his hand
[1:06:12] he said the King sword don't be afraid
[1:06:14] it's the third Pole don't fear it's the
[1:06:17] vindication of your ministry and so
[1:06:20] here's a certain King which made him
[1:06:22] marriage for his son we know that we're
[1:06:23] living in the
[1:06:25] the message the revelation of the Son of
[1:06:26] man is an invisible union of a bride to
[1:06:28] Christ this the marriage takes place
[1:06:30] here now and sent forth his servants to
[1:06:33] call them that were bidden to the
[1:06:35] wedding so now there's another calling
[1:06:36] and they would not come come to this
[1:06:39] union come to this invisible union come
[1:06:40] gather now for the marriage of my son
[1:06:43] and their Ben but they don't come and he
[1:06:45] said forth other servants saying tell
[1:06:46] them which were bidden behold I've
[1:06:47] prepared my dinner my auction and my
[1:06:50] fatlings are killed and all things
[1:06:52] already come unto the marriage now there
[1:06:55] is a and it's important for us to
[1:06:59] realize you don't want to spiritualize
[1:07:01] everything to where there's never
[1:07:02] anything literal like there's never a
[1:07:03] literal change of our body we've
[1:07:04] spiritually been resurrected we've
[1:07:05] spiritually been raptured we're
[1:07:06] spiritually spiritually and we never
[1:07:08] realized there actually will be a
[1:07:09] literal translation of the Saints
[1:07:11] defeating of death there will be a
[1:07:13] meeting in the air there will be a
[1:07:14] wedding supper now we only use the
[1:07:16] language that were given to understand
[1:07:18] those things but the interpretation will
[1:07:20] be when he brings it to pass and there
[1:07:22] has been in type and in one in a
[1:07:25] spiritual sense a spiritual marriage
[1:07:27] supper taking place now and brother BAM
[1:07:30] talks about it from the standpoint that
[1:07:31] we're eating the hidden manna that the
[1:07:33] world knows nothing of that the way they
[1:07:35] eat or the carcass is there will the
[1:07:37] eagle's be gathered together your
[1:07:38] feasting not on a man but on the
[1:07:40] unfailing body word of the Son of Man
[1:07:42] and he's showing that there is a
[1:07:44] spiritual feast a bride spiritual feast
[1:07:46] taking place right now that he's
[1:07:48] prepared for us in the presence of our
[1:07:50] enemies so there has to be a fulfillment
[1:07:53] of us feast it in the end time prior to
[1:07:56] the change of our bodies where he's
[1:07:58] prepared a table bring us as a full
[1:07:59] seven-course meal for all seven skills
[1:08:02] are revealed and the words ready for
[1:08:05] those who can receive it so we have a
[1:08:08] feast right now that we've been called
[1:08:10] to invited to and I trust you're
[1:08:12] enjoying it and he says now but they
[1:08:16] made light of it and went their ways
[1:08:18] wonders farm windows merchandise you
[1:08:19] could see the parallel to Luke chapter
[1:08:20] 14 and the remnant took your servants
[1:08:23] and entreated them spitefully and slew
[1:08:25] them but when the king heard thereof he
[1:08:27] was wroth and he sent forth his armies
[1:08:29] and destroyed those murderers and burned
[1:08:30] their city then saith he to his servants
[1:08:33] the wedding is ready but they which were
[1:08:34] bidden were not worthy going in
[1:08:36] therefore into the highways and his me
[1:08:38] she shall find bid to the marriage so
[1:08:40] those servants went out into the
[1:08:43] highways and gathered together all as
[1:08:46] many as they found both bad and good so
[1:08:49] here's brother Bam's language again as
[1:08:50] he had read to Luke 14 now it's Matthew
[1:08:53] chapter 22 in Matthew chapter 20 Luke 14
[1:08:55] connected together both bad and good and
[1:08:57] the wedding was furnished with guests
[1:09:00] the wedding the marriage the union was
[1:09:02] furnished with guests and when the king
[1:09:04] came to see the guests he saw a man
[1:09:06] which had not a wedding garment now this
[1:09:09] is a parable to make the point not to
[1:09:13] make the point that you could make it to
[1:09:14] it without a wedding garment but that if
[1:09:17] you don't have the baptism of the holy
[1:09:19] ghost you you cannot participate in the
[1:09:21] feast and it does not imply that there's
[1:09:24] anybody who's actually in it and there
[1:09:26] in reality without it he's using the
[1:09:29] parable to teach the point that you
[1:09:31] cannot come into this without the
[1:09:33] baptism of Holy Ghost the dirt dressed
[1:09:35] in the garments of his word he said unto
[1:09:37] Him friend how camest thou in thither
[1:09:39] and not have a wedding garment it says
[1:09:40] and he was speechless why he has no
[1:09:43] understanding he doesn't have a language
[1:09:45] of the message you don't have the
[1:09:47] language of the token and have a
[1:09:48] language of the third Pole he doesn't
[1:09:49] have a revelation so he can't answer he
[1:09:51] might even be like wedding garment what
[1:09:53] he referring to
[1:09:53] he doesn't know these things because he
[1:09:56] can't know it then said the King to the
[1:09:58] servants bind him hand and foot and cast
[1:10:00] him away and cast him into outer
[1:10:01] darkness there shall be weeping and
[1:10:03] gnashing of teeth what is that
[1:10:04] representative of tribulation so there
[1:10:06] is a feast that takes place wherein
[1:10:09] those were gathered together and then
[1:10:11] there's a separation between those who
[1:10:13] are in the Union and drawn and bidden by
[1:10:16] the word to this invisible Union and
[1:10:17] those who cannot participate in it and
[1:10:19] they're cast into tribulation they says
[1:10:23] for many are called but few are chosen
[1:10:26] many are called what does that mean many
[1:10:29] will hear in external invitation
[1:10:31] many will be stirred up by the moving of
[1:10:33] the bride even in the first Exodus
[1:10:35] there's a lot of people that got caught
[1:10:37] up in the supernatural got caught up in
[1:10:39] the move and there was millions that
[1:10:40] were left but only two that entered and
[1:10:43] there's a lot of people that get caught
[1:10:44] up in the dynamics of the ministry the
[1:10:46] dynamics of the church the dynamics of
[1:10:48] the open of the word
[1:10:49] but they're hearing the world when
[1:10:51] they're here they're seeing the fire
[1:10:52] they're seeing all these earthquakes in
[1:10:54] these great sounds but they haven't
[1:10:56] caught the still small voice they
[1:10:58] haven't responded to the voice and the
[1:11:00] knock upon the door but they're caught
[1:11:02] up in something many are called but few
[1:11:05] are chosen
[1:11:07] many are caught up in it and moved and
[1:11:11] motivated many seemingly are at this
[1:11:14] wedding supper but very very few are
[1:11:17] chosen
[1:11:18] very few are elected so how does Matthew
[1:11:23] chapter 22 actually unfold and so it's a
[1:11:28] parable which is representative it's
[1:11:29] symbolic it's not entirely literal till
[1:11:32] we read it said well there's going to be
[1:11:33] this happened and that happened there's
[1:11:35] got to be murders and there's got to be
[1:11:36] all sorts of things burned up and say
[1:11:38] well that's that's been fulfilled here
[1:11:40] this is a parable so it's symbolic to
[1:11:42] tell a story and we can actually see the
[1:11:47] very things that Jesus is talking about
[1:11:49] in this parable we can see it unfold in
[1:11:52] John chapter 6 because in John chapter 6
[1:11:56] we know that Jesus has just prior to
[1:11:59] John chapter 6 he has multiplied the
[1:12:01] loaves and fishes and boy was that
[1:12:03] impressive and so people are like I'll
[1:12:06] hang out with a guy who can always feed
[1:12:09] me no matter how much we got he can make
[1:12:12] five of this and five of that and have
[1:12:14] bushels leftover after you fed thousands
[1:12:16] this is a ministry I'm not ashamed of
[1:12:18] and there's multitudes that would have
[1:12:21] no problem all you're going to see Jesus
[1:12:23] of Nazareth Jesus and as it were ever
[1:12:24] heard that name before he's the guy that
[1:12:25] took five loaves of bread and five fish
[1:12:27] multiplied it fed 5,000 had bushels
[1:12:30] leftover like I'm coming I want to do
[1:12:33] that I want to participate in that and
[1:12:35] everybody's looking for a handout right
[1:12:37] and so in John chapter 6 verse 26 when
[1:12:41] the multitudes found him and gathered to
[1:12:43] him jesus answered them and said verily
[1:12:45] verily I send to you you see you seek me
[1:12:47] so oh yes they sought him they wanted
[1:12:50] him they desired him not because you saw
[1:12:53] the miracles but because you did eat of
[1:12:56] the loaves and were filled he says you
[1:12:59] sought me not because you understood the
[1:13:01] purpose and
[1:13:03] of the sign you sought me not because
[1:13:05] you really caught what the drawing power
[1:13:07] was all along you didn't really got get
[1:13:10] with it was taking place
[1:13:11] you only sought me because you did eat
[1:13:13] of the loaves and were filled they
[1:13:15] didn't catch the purpose of the draw
[1:13:17] they didn't catch the purpose of the
[1:13:18] miracles they were only satisfied with
[1:13:21] the natural benefit and who wouldn't be
[1:13:23] satisfied with a physical healing would
[1:13:26] who wouldn't be satisfied I lost my job
[1:13:27] I prayed and I got it back who wouldn't
[1:13:29] be satisfied with all the natural
[1:13:31] benefits of what the word can bring and
[1:13:34] but yet he's saying you only wanted me
[1:13:36] because of the natural benefit and not
[1:13:38] because of the spiritual draw that was
[1:13:41] taking place not because you don't seek
[1:13:43] me because you see i the son of man him
[1:13:46] in your myths but you like the benefit
[1:13:48] of being near me real Ram says in the
[1:13:51] message investments but one day God
[1:13:53] changed that ministry in him from
[1:13:56] miracles to the teaching of the word he
[1:13:59] says surely you could read between the
[1:14:00] lines
[1:14:01] you're not that blind I said so blind
[1:14:05] you can put a pencil in front of your
[1:14:06] eyes and not be able to see he's saying
[1:14:08] surely you're not that blind surely the
[1:14:10] pencil of the word of God isn't going to
[1:14:12] blind you where you can't understand
[1:14:14] where we are today my new ministry the
[1:14:17] present stage of a ministry the very
[1:14:19] things that we're looking to happen and
[1:14:20] unfold coming up in the open of the
[1:14:22] seven seals surely you're not blind that
[1:14:26] my ministry is going to change from
[1:14:28] miracles and signs and wonders to the
[1:14:30] teaching of the word he says notice as
[1:14:32] soon as God changed his ministry from
[1:14:34] his miracles his miracles went on but
[1:14:37] not like that
[1:14:39] so his emphasis isn't in the miracles
[1:14:41] but people seek them not because they
[1:14:43] understand the miracles but because they
[1:14:45] like the benefit of it
[1:14:47] so miracles can't continue and people
[1:14:49] can continue to get the benefit of the
[1:14:51] miracle but they're not really there for
[1:14:52] the teaching he says he began to tell
[1:14:56] them the straight scripture truth and
[1:14:59] where they were standing the crowd
[1:15:00] walked away from him and said this is a
[1:15:03] hard saying what happened the seventy
[1:15:05] that was following him so now the crowd
[1:15:06] walks away now it's his disciples that
[1:15:08] he ordained he says they walked away to
[1:15:10] said who can understand the thing like
[1:15:13] this
[1:15:13] that's all against everything we were
[1:15:16] ever taught and so the scripture then
[1:15:19] comes into view John chapter six verse
[1:15:21] 66 from that time many of his disciples
[1:15:24] went back and walked no more with him
[1:15:28] many came and a few stayed many came and
[1:15:34] now here there there there therefore the
[1:15:36] loaves and the fishes there therefore
[1:15:37] signs and wonders and miracles but now
[1:15:39] there's going to be another element
[1:15:40] unfold there's gonna be a third pull a
[1:15:42] teaching of the word and over to the
[1:15:44] word and they're like well just keep
[1:15:45] doing the first and second this stuff's
[1:15:47] getting kind of funny wait a minute he's
[1:15:49] not backing off this he's not changing
[1:15:50] he's aggravating it we can't stick
[1:15:52] around for this even if we could get
[1:15:54] some kind of benefit from it even if it
[1:15:56] is the best way to live I don't want to
[1:15:58] have anything to do it this is to sweer
[1:15:59] this is too different I'm gonna walk
[1:16:02] away from it because I can't be around
[1:16:04] and then the very ones who are gained
[1:16:05] and had a ministry with them it starts
[1:16:07] getting really really tight for them
[1:16:08] they start getting really really
[1:16:10] squeezed they start feeling like oh my
[1:16:12] this is too much pressure and whether do
[1:16:14] they leave too and they walked many
[1:16:17] walked no more with him brother Bev says
[1:16:20] and go away Jesus November of 63 when
[1:16:22] the light of Life is shining to bring
[1:16:24] that seed what could it do upon a rock
[1:16:26] it will do nothing what can it do upon
[1:16:29] dead substance it's not sent for dead
[1:16:31] substance the Sun shines for a seed
[1:16:34] that's German ties to life in the Bible
[1:16:37] and His Word in the hour that we live is
[1:16:39] shining upon those to catch the eternal
[1:16:42] life those who are predestinated to see
[1:16:44] it and it won't do one bit of good upon
[1:16:47] the rest of them there is no life there
[1:16:50] to come forth by the Sun or by the light
[1:16:53] then we find out that they turned their
[1:16:56] backs and walk with him no more so now
[1:16:59] we see the dynamics of what's taking
[1:17:02] place in John chapter six it's not so
[1:17:04] much a personal choice but God's
[1:17:06] choosing and his forward a nation that
[1:17:08] there's an intellect there who can be
[1:17:10] quickened by that pool and there's the
[1:17:12] rest that can walk in the first and
[1:17:14] second but they're unable to enter into
[1:17:16] that place of fellowship of the third
[1:17:18] pole because they're not ordained to it
[1:17:20] because when the light of the third pole
[1:17:22] begins to shine it chases them away but
[1:17:25] it actually draws the rest you can even
[1:17:27] use the analogy of a barn light you turn
[1:17:29] the barn light on in the country and it
[1:17:31] attracts a lot of bugs and a lot of
[1:17:33] insects and a lot of creatures created
[1:17:35] creatures and critters that gather
[1:17:36] around it but the light's not there for
[1:17:38] them the light's not there to bring bugs
[1:17:41] the light's not there to bring critters
[1:17:42] the lights there to guide a person to a
[1:17:44] doorway to an entrance so that they can
[1:17:46] enter safely so it brings up a lot it
[1:17:49] brings up a lot of attractions a lot of
[1:17:50] fanaticism and a lot of critics but the
[1:17:52] light will only have purpose for those
[1:17:54] who know the way to walk in so he says
[1:17:59] that they are I try to find my place
[1:18:05] they turn back their backs and walk
[1:18:07] nowhere with them now skip live a he
[1:18:09] give them some sound doctrine
[1:18:11] his healing days were just about over he
[1:18:14] didn't care wasn't going to heal too
[1:18:15] much more think about that there's been
[1:18:19] this face and he said earlier he still
[1:18:21] would do it but not like that and he
[1:18:24] said he wouldn't heal too much more this
[1:18:26] is the partner I think it's import for
[1:18:28] us to catch he was going to tell them
[1:18:29] about something that was better this is
[1:18:33] brother branham's language something
[1:18:34] that was better i says he began to tell
[1:18:38] them that he was there revealed to them
[1:18:41] who he actually was he come to tell them
[1:18:45] he there revealed to them who he
[1:18:47] actually was that's the part that's
[1:18:50] better when he reveals who he actually
[1:18:52] is what did Jesus even say to fill up in
[1:18:56] them because I said I saw you under the
[1:18:58] tree you believe he says if you believe
[1:19:02] this you'll see greater things
[1:19:04] I know it's if you really see what that
[1:19:07] miracle represents if you really catch
[1:19:09] with that sign signifies you'll see
[1:19:11] greater things not just because you
[1:19:13] believe this was neat this was great
[1:19:14] this was a wonderful sign but if you
[1:19:16] really catch the draw in what was there
[1:19:18] then you'll see greater because there's
[1:19:20] something greater than the sign there's
[1:19:23] something even greater hearing better
[1:19:24] he's saying than the miracles and don't
[1:19:28] don't get dug don't please whatever you
[1:19:30] do don't walk away from here so a
[1:19:32] brother Aaron was preaching against
[1:19:33] miracles and brother and was preaching
[1:19:35] and it's amazing how you can quote
[1:19:37] brother Branham on his right knee trying
[1:19:39] to position in place prayer line
[1:19:41] and miracles and altar calls and all
[1:19:42] those things and he's wanting the bride
[1:19:44] to come up to a higher faith and you try
[1:19:46] to use that to bring the bride to a
[1:19:48] higher level and then your own brothers
[1:19:51] will turn around and criticize you and
[1:19:52] say you're preaching against prayer
[1:19:54] lines you're preaching against healings
[1:19:55] you're preaching against miracles and
[1:19:57] you're only saying what brother Branham
[1:19:59] said and trying to emphasize what he
[1:20:01] tried to emphasize because what you're
[1:20:03] teaching is that is God that is God that
[1:20:06] is his promise it's in his word look at
[1:20:09] how he's met you there every single time
[1:20:11] if he'll do it there can you not believe
[1:20:13] you can take a step higher can we not
[1:20:17] come into the Gentiles faith of taking
[1:20:20] him at his word because he's kept his
[1:20:22] word at the altar he kept his word in
[1:20:24] the prayer line he kept his word in
[1:20:25] laying on of hands can we come to a
[1:20:27] place to say I am a witness I was saved
[1:20:30] at the altar I was healed in the line
[1:20:32] I'm taking him at his word to be changed
[1:20:34] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:20:38] God is not going to order did all of a
[1:20:41] sudden move upon brother Jason tonight
[1:20:43] we're gonna call a prayer line this is
[1:20:45] the third pull as I pray for you you'll
[1:20:47] be changed in your atoms it's gonna be a
[1:20:50] bride who's walking through each one of
[1:20:52] these steps of his promises walking
[1:20:54] through these experience God keeps his
[1:20:55] word God keeps his word
[1:20:57] God keeps his word and will one day be
[1:20:59] able to take him at his word that I
[1:21:01] don't have to die for that sin he's
[1:21:06] revealing who he actually was makes
[1:21:10] himself known see him as he is he says
[1:21:17] so away they went
[1:21:19] if it's like they could pay lip service
[1:21:21] to wanting to Messiah they can pay lip
[1:21:25] service to Jesus Christ but when he
[1:21:27] really shows you who he is they don't
[1:21:28] want him anymore
[1:21:29] why because he's not 900 foot tall
[1:21:32] because he's not the big glorious king
[1:21:35] and the person with the mile long spear
[1:21:37] that's taken Romans and throwing him all
[1:21:38] over the place it's not what their minds
[1:21:40] expected him to be so they went away and
[1:21:43] the message influenced who says Jesus
[1:21:45] with great crowds of thousands following
[1:21:47] now stay with me and this and and are
[1:21:53] you here are you with me
[1:21:54] I don't know if I mentioned this before
[1:21:56] but I was preaching in church and I said
[1:21:58] is everybody with me and not one person
[1:22:01] said a thing is everybody followed me
[1:22:03] and I realize I'm preaching to a pretty
[1:22:05] sharp crowd nobody could answer for
[1:22:08] everybody so nobody answered I'm with
[1:22:12] you but I don't know about these guys so
[1:22:14] then I said are you with me - Amen
[1:22:16] everybody so like okay well now we can
[1:22:18] answer collectively so I asked you
[1:22:20] individually if you're with me now
[1:22:21] listen now brother Rams about to make
[1:22:23] some statements that are very very
[1:22:24] significant influence 1964 March 15th
[1:22:27] Jesus with great crowds of thousands
[1:22:29] following said that's too many he said
[1:22:33] look something strange here many are
[1:22:35] called few are chosen so so then he's
[1:22:38] seen the great congregations he said
[1:22:40] except you eat the flesh of the Son of
[1:22:42] Man drink his blood you have no life in
[1:22:43] you he never explained it now what if he
[1:22:46] said that in Beaumont today he's down
[1:22:48] there preaching in Texas preaching in
[1:22:50] Beaumont Texas what if he would say that
[1:22:51] in Buford today says no matter how
[1:22:55] popular he was what do you think the
[1:22:56] doctors and fine cultured people and
[1:22:58] scientists would say that man's a
[1:23:00] vampire that man's a misogynist that
[1:23:02] man's a racist that man's this that
[1:23:04] man's that that's what they would say
[1:23:05] that man's a vampire why he wants you to
[1:23:08] drink his blood you're going off on a
[1:23:10] tantrum Jesus never explained it why you
[1:23:14] don't explain the third Pole he didn't
[1:23:17] try to water it down well listen I mean
[1:23:19] I say that but you don't literally need
[1:23:22] to eat my body and drink blood hey hey
[1:23:25] you make your own choice you you part
[1:23:29] you process this yourself you digest
[1:23:30] this yourself you find out whether or
[1:23:32] not I could say a hard saying and
[1:23:34] without you willing to accept it be done
[1:23:35] to me according to thy word because
[1:23:38] that's how it's gonna have to be in the
[1:23:39] bride as it wasn't Mary she had to
[1:23:41] believe the impossible well be it unto
[1:23:42] me according to thy word and so he says
[1:23:45] he never explained it he wanted to shake
[1:23:47] them parasites off of him right then
[1:23:51] they all got up and left
[1:23:53] so what shakes off the parasites the
[1:23:55] third pull what shakes off the parasites
[1:23:58] the preaching of the word the teaching
[1:24:00] of the word the hard sayings then in God
[1:24:04] identified by his characteristics this
[1:24:06] is just a few days before the
[1:24:08] Jesus when he was on earth he had too
[1:24:11] many with him he looked around and seen
[1:24:13] the congregation he wanted to get rid of
[1:24:15] them this is the language brother
[1:24:17] branham's using about Jesus lady that's
[1:24:20] too many and now he's saying he had too
[1:24:23] many he wanted to get rid of him he said
[1:24:25] except you eat the flesh of the Son of
[1:24:26] Man and drink his blood you have no life
[1:24:27] in you could you imagine a doctor
[1:24:29] sitting out there why this man wants to
[1:24:31] be a human vampire drink his blood
[1:24:32] nonsense all you people walk away and
[1:24:35] lead that crazy man alone near that
[1:24:37] neurotic alone leave this crazy nonsense
[1:24:39] alone they walked away he never
[1:24:41] explained it he didn't have to explain
[1:24:44] it matter of fact he's probably told by
[1:24:48] the Father don't explain it just say
[1:24:51] what I said do what I told you to do
[1:24:53] don't try to explain it because if you
[1:24:55] do you're going to cause confusion
[1:24:57] you can't teach Pentecostal baby
[1:24:59] supernatural things they come up with
[1:25:02] those supernatural things were then and
[1:25:06] he says he shakes your faith some time
[1:25:10] to see what you'll do and he's doing the
[1:25:13] same thing in this day see let it seem
[1:25:15] spooky to you a little bit to see where
[1:25:18] you stand whether you really believe now
[1:25:22] let's just put this in context I want my
[1:25:24] show of hands since there's only about
[1:25:25] half of us here today how many believe
[1:25:28] that the seven seals are open raise your
[1:25:30] hand now you can put your hands down I
[1:25:33] think almost everybody's even my
[1:25:35] five-year-old Jack believes that now
[1:25:38] what you believe is that revelation is
[1:25:41] five has transpired and what you believe
[1:25:44] is this book of the Bible and these
[1:25:47] chapters in this Bible that everyone in
[1:25:49] the world's probed that and thought
[1:25:51] about and commentaries and all this you
[1:25:53] believe that happened now you believe
[1:25:55] that happened because a man named
[1:25:57] William Branham was caught up in a
[1:25:58] constellation of seven angels out in
[1:26:00] Arizona and was given a message and he
[1:26:03] come back to a little bitty old shack
[1:26:05] out in Jeffersonville and preached the
[1:26:07] seven seals to just hundreds of people
[1:26:10] and preaches from a Sunday with a Sunday
[1:26:13] and preaches the revelation of the seven
[1:26:15] seals and when you begin to describe it
[1:26:17] to people and you want it we believe the
[1:26:18] seals are open
[1:26:19] oh my goodness gracious where did that
[1:26:21] happen tell me about it you begin to
[1:26:23] describe it
[1:26:24] you know what you start hitting the
[1:26:25] since it's a little spooky and he said
[1:26:29] well you know I I know it was just made
[1:26:30] 120 that was gathered in the upper room
[1:26:31] at the climax of Jesus's ministry so I
[1:26:33] mean it doesn't stumble me that only
[1:26:35] hundreds would be gathered when the
[1:26:36] seals are open but it sounds a little
[1:26:38] spooky when you begin to think about
[1:26:40] really what we believe
[1:26:41] he says T's he says it makes us Pookie
[1:26:44] little bit to see where you stand
[1:26:45] whether you really believe brother man
[1:26:49] when he's preaching the seal says you
[1:26:50] know you'd think that this would be
[1:26:51] revealed in the Vatican you'd think
[1:26:53] something like this would be something
[1:26:54] big something fantastic he says let it
[1:26:57] seem spooky just to see if you really be
[1:26:59] remember them disciples forward and by
[1:27:00] God never moved they couldn't explain it
[1:27:02] either but they didn't want to move all
[1:27:05] that congregation walked away thousands
[1:27:08] walked away why because they didn't
[1:27:11] believe he says they didn't want the
[1:27:13] disciples didn't want to move even
[1:27:15] without explanation they didn't want to
[1:27:17] move and then and then brother Branham
[1:27:20] excuse me Jesus says in verse 64 just
[1:27:22] back it up a little bit but there are
[1:27:23] some of you that believe not he knew
[1:27:26] that what he was preaching some didn't
[1:27:28] believe and because they didn't believe
[1:27:30] that would shake him away they would
[1:27:31] fall away for jesus knew from the
[1:27:32] beginning who they were that believed
[1:27:34] not and who should betray him who would
[1:27:39] not see him for what he is in the hour
[1:27:41] that he was living some speculate it may
[1:27:44] be Josephus speculates that Judas
[1:27:46] actually believed that he was the
[1:27:47] Messiah
[1:27:48] who'd restored the kingdom to Israel and
[1:27:50] betrayed him thinking it would force
[1:27:52] Jesus into his Messiah koffice than if i
[1:27:56] betray him and he's in bonds and he's
[1:27:58] gonna be threatened with death then he
[1:28:00] would show his great power and manifest
[1:28:02] his great power why because he didn't
[1:28:04] see him in the expression that he was in
[1:28:07] and that day as a lamb and as a
[1:28:09] sacrifice and they can't see him today
[1:28:12] in his expression he said but there were
[1:28:16] some of you who believed not all right
[1:28:19] so he opens the word that pushes crowds
[1:28:21] away what's supposed to be a pool
[1:28:23] becomes a push and brother branham says
[1:28:27] an unveiling of God and what did you
[1:28:28] he said that's too many he had too many
[1:28:30] he wanted to get rid of him he won
[1:28:32] to shake the parasites off so he used
[1:28:34] strong doctrine he revealed who he was
[1:28:36] and when he really showed his colors
[1:28:38] that's what caused people to run away
[1:28:40] and now brother BAM says this an
[1:28:43] unveiling of God I hope and trust that
[1:28:45] you have a had a spiritual understanding
[1:28:47] of what God has been trying to get over
[1:28:49] to the church without saying it right
[1:28:51] out because I believe it this is Aaron
[1:28:55] talking now I believe it's connected
[1:28:56] with the third pole and he's very
[1:28:57] careful with his language from that
[1:28:59] moment on it from the time he opens our
[1:29:01] seals it's a thing sometime we have to
[1:29:04] say things in such a way that it might
[1:29:06] thin down he's referring to the crowds
[1:29:08] mice and now it might bring some to go
[1:29:11] out some to leave in some de pon da fur
[1:29:13] but that's done purposely Jesus did it
[1:29:17] purposely
[1:29:18] now bream said I have to say things
[1:29:21] sometimes that I know will thin down the
[1:29:23] crowd and cause some to leave but it's
[1:29:25] done purposely it must be done that way
[1:29:28] then it might be some would say you mean
[1:29:30] God would purposely do a thing like that
[1:29:33] he certainly did he does yet actually
[1:29:38] say things why listen that's why the
[1:29:40] explanation sometimes can take away the
[1:29:42] spook the explanation can resolve all
[1:29:45] the paradoxes the explanation in law if
[1:29:47] that's really what it is that doesn't
[1:29:48] sound so bad but God wants it to be raw
[1:29:51] God wants it to be in the original God
[1:29:53] doesn't want it with explanation God
[1:29:55] wants you to see it in there by
[1:29:57] revelation and accept it with even the
[1:30:00] stigma associated with it God would
[1:30:04] purposely say things to shake parasites
[1:30:06] off yes God would purposely say things
[1:30:09] to cost thousands to walk away yes
[1:30:12] Matthew 7 verses 13 14 into yet the
[1:30:15] strait gate for wide is the gate and
[1:30:17] broad is the way that leadeth to
[1:30:18] destruction and many there be which go
[1:30:20] in thereat the broad easy the welcoming
[1:30:24] the well furnished the one that
[1:30:26] everybody else is going in could you
[1:30:28] imagine if you diagram the the exodus
[1:30:30] two million going that way and two going
[1:30:32] the opposite way pushing through 2
[1:30:34] million people get me the other side get
[1:30:36] me the other side this is our promise
[1:30:37] and you'd say um you two seem like
[1:30:40] you're lost I'll follow the crowd
[1:30:43] because that's what would seem logical
[1:30:46] that's why we'd see why how can two
[1:30:47] people have this figured out well God
[1:30:49] doesn't want us to rely upon mathematics
[1:30:51] and online polls and everything else in
[1:30:54] the and these different things we we
[1:30:56] look at the revealed Word of God find
[1:30:58] that channel and we stay in it many will
[1:31:00] go in thereat
[1:31:01] because Strait is the gate and narrow is
[1:31:03] the way which leadeth unto life and few
[1:31:06] there be that find it
[1:31:09] but the RAM says and is this the side of
[1:31:11] the INSERM a lock I for speaks that
[1:31:13] he'll be here and we believe that he
[1:31:15] will we're looking for him we're looking
[1:31:17] for his manifestation and we'll see the
[1:31:20] vindicated Word of God there will be
[1:31:22] just a few understand it as it was in
[1:31:25] the days of Noah so shall it be at the
[1:31:27] coming of the Son of Man what was saved
[1:31:29] Peter told us in 1st Peter chapter 3
[1:31:31] verse 20 wearing few that is eight souls
[1:31:33] were saved and the language he's using
[1:31:36] of saved it's not while I accept Jesus
[1:31:37] Christ in my heart and there's some kind
[1:31:39] of sustaining of judgment until white
[1:31:42] throne but it's actually the salvation
[1:31:44] of that time that age he says in the
[1:31:47] days of law there was actually three
[1:31:48] saved what is it referring to the
[1:31:49] revealing of the Son of Man Luke 17 the
[1:31:51] wife started out in lost so shall it be
[1:31:53] in the day in the coming of the Son of
[1:31:55] Man there will be very few saved
[1:31:57] translated in that time so the work of
[1:32:01] God in this hour is not just a salvation
[1:32:04] that leads us to a grave but the
[1:32:06] ultimate salvation of the body from
[1:32:08] death now with that as my foundation I
[1:32:12] want to bring you to the just the
[1:32:15] homestretch here and I wish I still
[1:32:17] lived further west because the home
[1:32:18] stretch is longer now it's only four
[1:32:20] hours because I live in Newton and
[1:32:22] greetings to the churches of Newton but
[1:32:25] it says is this the sign of the insert
[1:32:28] now just to kind of tie all these things
[1:32:30] together in just one other viewpoint
[1:32:32] here as we want to come to this
[1:32:33] homestretch brother man brother Branham
[1:32:35] talks about brother Jackson dreaming a
[1:32:37] dream and he shares six different dreams
[1:32:39] and then his vision when he's preaching
[1:32:41] is this the sign of the insert and he
[1:32:43] said all these things have happened to
[1:32:45] bring us to this place where we know
[1:32:46] this is where we're at right now this is
[1:32:48] what we ought to expect to be happening
[1:32:49] and I'm just had I kind of put this
[1:32:51] together to share it like brother jr.
[1:32:53] was sharing the drink cuz but I said he
[1:32:55] said he said said all of us brethren
[1:32:57] from Georgian from all around
[1:32:58] standing together listening do you
[1:32:59] interpret that mysterious riding on
[1:33:01] those stone that mountain then you
[1:33:03] picked up something like from the air
[1:33:04] something like a wrecking bar or crowbar
[1:33:07] something like that a real sharp this is
[1:33:10] how he sees it I don't know could it be
[1:33:12] that that's that sword says how you done
[1:33:14] it I don't know you struck the top of
[1:33:17] that mountain
[1:33:18] ripped it around lifted the cap up off
[1:33:20] it it was in the shape of a pyramid and
[1:33:22] you ripped the top of it top of it off
[1:33:25] beneath that was a white stone granite
[1:33:27] and you said the Sun the light has never
[1:33:30] shined on this before look in on this
[1:33:33] watch this and brother man says this is
[1:33:36] true from the beginning of time light
[1:33:38] has never shone on this before and he
[1:33:41] said look upon this light has never come
[1:33:43] upon it before and when all of them got
[1:33:46] up and I told them to watch that and all
[1:33:50] of them come up to look in so here's
[1:33:53] this dream by brother jr. Jackson and
[1:33:56] within it there's something that opens
[1:33:59] up that brother and says this is what
[1:34:01] you need to look at and our brother
[1:34:03] branham reaffirms this in the contest
[1:34:05] he's preaches the next day after is this
[1:34:07] the sign of the inserter he says open
[1:34:09] this year Lord the hidden man of the
[1:34:10] rock beneath the rock that we might see
[1:34:13] the promo program of God he says just a
[1:34:15] moment before that we may say Jesus and
[1:34:17] his program cap off the pyramids of our
[1:34:19] life Lord put the cap stone Christ Jesus
[1:34:21] upon each and every one of us so now
[1:34:23] he's looking for this dream to be
[1:34:25] fulfilled then he preaches the Seventh
[1:34:27] Seal he says now the third came from the
[1:34:28] West sweeping forward with great
[1:34:30] terrific speed and they picked me up
[1:34:31] that was coming back east so now the
[1:34:34] fulfillment of even the three different
[1:34:36] movies West and the Angels in the
[1:34:38] constellation the shape of a pyramid
[1:34:40] which he identifies it in the in the
[1:34:42] cloud and he now says that was coming
[1:34:45] back east with the mystery of these
[1:34:46] seven seals just like it said in junior
[1:34:48] Jackson's dream that the Lord let me
[1:34:50] interpret for him there on the inside of
[1:34:52] that pyramid there was a white stone
[1:34:54] that wasn't written on that's the reason
[1:34:56] I had to go west to connect with these
[1:34:58] angels message to come back here to
[1:35:00] reveal it to the church
[1:35:02] are you following I know this is very
[1:35:06] very dense well I'm also very dense
[1:35:07] myself so you just bear with me it takes
[1:35:10] me longer to get this kind of stuff
[1:35:12] so now he says he's connecting now we're
[1:35:15] realizing that what he preaches in this
[1:35:16] the sign of the insert' is fulfilled in
[1:35:18] the open of these seals and he brings
[1:35:20] this vision back up this dream back up
[1:35:22] and this is what brother jr. was telling
[1:35:24] us about
[1:35:24] so he says understanding in the gap and
[1:35:26] the rock is Christ that was in the
[1:35:28] brothers dream she's open at the top of
[1:35:30] the pyramid like rock but however it is
[1:35:32] a shape of a pyramid but the cap on the
[1:35:34] pyramid was never put on so now he's
[1:35:36] talking about the breach between the
[1:35:38] pyramid body and the capstone and we
[1:35:41] know in Christ as the mystery got
[1:35:43] revealed that this is the revelation of
[1:35:44] the capstone is the vindication that the
[1:35:46] raptures at hand and there's a revealing
[1:35:49] of this capstone now uniting with the
[1:35:50] body he says in the full church it was
[1:35:53] the headstone so it never did come it
[1:35:55] was rejected Christ was rejected the
[1:35:58] headstone in the full church in the
[1:36:00] Gentile Church ages he says and it will
[1:36:02] come we find out that during that time I
[1:36:05] saw seven angels in a form of a pyramid
[1:36:07] that swept down and picked me up and I
[1:36:09] brought each to open the seven seals for
[1:36:12] God that will be the eternal truth of
[1:36:14] the Living God that was to find out that
[1:36:16] it was sealed inside this mountain so
[1:36:18] now he connects it with the stream again
[1:36:20] there wasn't wrote it had to be
[1:36:21] interpreted and when I come back the
[1:36:23] first angel and learn that first night
[1:36:25] opened the seal contracting anything we
[1:36:28] ever heard in our life because what
[1:36:31] happens after the seals are opened the
[1:36:33] Bible becomes a new book what does he
[1:36:36] have he says a new message it opened up
[1:36:38] to us a new land think contracting
[1:36:41] anything ever heard before in our life
[1:36:43] open up week it's gone the light's gone
[1:36:44] further up the road a brand new field
[1:36:47] this is the language that brother
[1:36:49] Branham is using now once these dreams
[1:36:51] and visions and all these questions are
[1:36:53] satisfied that are brought up it is this
[1:36:54] the sign of the answer brother says new
[1:36:57] book new land new message
[1:36:59] new life new covenant new bride all
[1:37:02] these things now being made manifest and
[1:37:06] he says in the third Exodus he's
[1:37:10] referring to the dream again the seven
[1:37:12] seals reveal the mysteries and then he
[1:37:13] opened this thing up at the top and
[1:37:15] found a rock and they're white but never
[1:37:16] been wrote on before it was the mystery
[1:37:18] go to Tucson for tell it before it
[1:37:20] happened stand north of Tucson witnesses
[1:37:22] standing there with it when a blast come
[1:37:24] and then shook the mountains
[1:37:25] off the ground almost and at the same
[1:37:27] time a circle of light hanging on in the
[1:37:29] air when the science took the pictures
[1:37:30] of it now now I'm not reading that for
[1:37:32] brother Matthew go to Tucson just to
[1:37:35] give him a drop with a breadcrumb
[1:37:36] because then he could say well brother
[1:37:37] Brad came back eventually but listen to
[1:37:40] what he's trying to point us to the
[1:37:42] seven seals reveal the mysteries it's
[1:37:44] the cap coming off that mountain brother
[1:37:46] junior Jackson's dreams he's saying he
[1:37:48] says and then there's brothers present
[1:37:49] when the blast goes forth that he saw in
[1:37:52] his own vision and dreams and he thought
[1:37:54] was the end of him but don't fear it's
[1:37:56] the vindication of your ministry so now
[1:37:58] all these things are fulfilled they're
[1:37:59] not future they're not we're not waiting
[1:38:01] for them God's interpreting these things
[1:38:03] by bringing to pass and now he points to
[1:38:05] the picture in the air a circle of light
[1:38:07] a cloud high cloud ring of mystery
[1:38:10] hanging yonder the air and science took
[1:38:12] the picture of it not us they took the
[1:38:15] picture he goes in West that's our Lord
[1:38:17] up there that's God fulfilling his
[1:38:21] promise word of Revelations 10 1 2 7 and
[1:38:25] what do you say you see a pyramid you
[1:38:27] see a constellation a capstone of 7
[1:38:30] angels being symbolically represented in
[1:38:32] the sky and it shows the supreme one the
[1:38:34] the the the the judge and his wig so now
[1:38:42] in the Norton ones at the end time I'll
[1:38:45] say this just to try to sum this up the
[1:38:48] first pole healing second pole
[1:38:49] prophesying third pulled the open of the
[1:38:51] word the mysteries reveal the third pole
[1:38:54] was brother man's words the third pole
[1:38:56] was the open of them seven seals to
[1:38:58] reveal the hidden truth that's been
[1:38:59] sealed in the word and you could study
[1:39:02] the message on the third pole and you
[1:39:04] could come up with a lot of questions
[1:39:05] could it be could it be and I'm looking
[1:39:06] for this I'm looking for that and I'm
[1:39:07] wondering about this but once brother
[1:39:09] Branham comes to the end of 1963 there's
[1:39:11] a man here who could turn on the light
[1:39:13] and look away to Jesus he never
[1:39:17] questions the third pull again we now
[1:39:20] know what it is and what it does
[1:39:22] thoroughly vindicated thoroughly
[1:39:23] identified and he goes I'm sure you
[1:39:25] understand and we're like
[1:39:28] I'm sure you caught that yeah absolutely
[1:39:31] we did Lord let me catch it let me see
[1:39:32] it but now he knows he never backs up
[1:39:36] and questions it again every time he
[1:39:38] speaks about the third pull from that
[1:39:39] point on he knows exactly what he's
[1:39:41] talking about
[1:39:42] doesn't try to explain it he just
[1:39:43] preaches it the third pole is the open
[1:39:46] of the seals to reveal the hidden truth
[1:39:47] that's been sealed in the word and let
[1:39:49] me say this this is what we must watch
[1:39:52] that's why he says in that dream look on
[1:39:55] this because he had a vision of those
[1:40:00] angels in that pyramid and he says oh
[1:40:02] it's coming with my message when he saw
[1:40:04] it he says oh it's coming with my
[1:40:06] message he says that's my second climax
[1:40:09] this is what he says I reproach for the
[1:40:12] word which he preaches the weekend
[1:40:13] before is this the sign of the answer I
[1:40:15] know I go fast I know there's a lot here
[1:40:17] you can always listen on point five
[1:40:19] speed later but then listen he says
[1:40:22] that's my second climax there's another
[1:40:25] climax to the message did you know that
[1:40:27] if we just ended in 62 then we've got a
[1:40:30] great climax there's a lot of signs and
[1:40:32] wonders and miracles and healings a lot
[1:40:34] of great teaching but all of that was
[1:40:35] leading to something if it only stopped
[1:40:37] in 63 it would be partial 62 it would be
[1:40:41] in part but now he says is this the sign
[1:40:44] of the answer is this that second climax
[1:40:46] that I talked about the other day
[1:40:48] so he's recognizing there's a second
[1:40:51] climax I'll come to where he describes
[1:40:52] it here in a moment but brother Branham
[1:40:54] preaches a power of transformation
[1:40:55] October 31st 1965 he says this is the
[1:40:59] climax age this is the age beyond
[1:41:01] denominations he said this is the end I
[1:41:04] talked about this is it this is out of
[1:41:05] Reformation this is the termination of
[1:41:07] systems this is the termination of
[1:41:09] denominations they've been indicted now
[1:41:11] it's the word and the word only this is
[1:41:15] the climax age this is the eagle age
[1:41:17] this is the astronaut age climax is the
[1:41:21] decisive moment the highest point of
[1:41:23] intensity or development
[1:41:25] you've reached two clerics means you've
[1:41:28] reached the highest point this and you
[1:41:30] cannot go beyond this if you try you
[1:41:32] start walking down the mountain this is
[1:41:36] the highest point the second climax he
[1:41:39] says even know when brother men talked
[1:41:42] about
[1:41:42] those Peaks those three peaks and the
[1:41:43] seven peaks the Branden Peaks he
[1:41:45] recognized the three pulls in there now
[1:41:48] Braille Rams used in this second climb
[1:41:50] matches but there's a climaxes to the
[1:41:51] ministry to the message when all of it I
[1:41:54] was laying the background from my first
[1:41:55] climax when all of a sudden I noticed
[1:41:56] that was getting late near the noon hour
[1:41:58] and my congregation begin to get
[1:42:00] physically hungry here's the Prophet
[1:42:03] imparting words of life and you know I'm
[1:42:05] kind of getting hungry here says and
[1:42:07] they started getting up and walking out
[1:42:09] with the intention of returning but they
[1:42:12] must have physical food according to
[1:42:13] their thinking and some are just getting
[1:42:15] tired of listening I hope I'm reading
[1:42:18] that this is just the right time to get
[1:42:19] your attention I noticed to my right
[1:42:22] side some young married people were
[1:42:23] leaving and I screamed out to them don't
[1:42:25] go for all these wonderful things that
[1:42:27] I've showed you you don't know where
[1:42:29] they come from or where you can find
[1:42:31] them then that was to be my first climax
[1:42:34] I grabbed my Bible and screamed making
[1:42:37] the climax they're found in the Bible
[1:42:39] Crime Commission to preach only the
[1:42:41] Bible but the congregation walked on I
[1:42:43] look towards the forest church and none
[1:42:45] no one was there then I turned and I
[1:42:47] said that that was the first shake
[1:42:49] Chicago so he's looking for something to
[1:42:51] happen real big and shake the whole
[1:42:52] world in Branson brother Bo hey you
[1:42:54] shook the church the people that you
[1:42:56] were called to shake don't look for it
[1:42:58] to happen some other way he said the
[1:43:00] church has seen the revelation of Jesus
[1:43:01] Christ made manifest and they recognized
[1:43:03] it so this is 62 now November 62 but the
[1:43:06] church itself has received the shaking
[1:43:08] they've recognized it they knowed the
[1:43:10] word they seen the word when it was
[1:43:11] materialized and they caught it now look
[1:43:13] at that for a minute because he said
[1:43:16] there's been some draw there's been some
[1:43:18] attraction there's people catching it
[1:43:19] says now and this first message when
[1:43:21] they seen it everybody rallied for it
[1:43:24] said all glory to God or if I could see
[1:43:26] this that on the other and they go right
[1:43:28] away in the same way they come in and
[1:43:31] now they think well I don't know where
[1:43:33] we would you join and if you don't come
[1:43:35] at this or be this way I'll be kicked
[1:43:36] out over here and I won't have nothing
[1:43:37] to do with here she says they've seen it
[1:43:39] they've seen the manifestation but
[1:43:41] eventually they turn around and walk
[1:43:43] away so it's not like they never came
[1:43:45] they came around for a little bit they
[1:43:46] were called to it they interacted but
[1:43:48] ultimately yeah let's just let's just
[1:43:50] walk out over here she's them brother
[1:43:52] and sit down and say well what if I do
[1:43:54] if I they won't
[1:43:55] stop long enough to recognize it's the
[1:43:58] Word of God promise being manifested and
[1:44:00] they walk away but they says but don't
[1:44:03] worry the shadows are close at hand then
[1:44:06] he says you remember the other night of
[1:44:07] the message that he give me back yonder
[1:44:09] when I was laying the cornerstone just
[1:44:10] exactly when you come out of this vision
[1:44:12] read 2nd Timothy 4 and he only quotes
[1:44:15] this part of 2nd Timothy 4 do the work
[1:44:17] in evangelist make full proof of your
[1:44:19] ministry for the time of calm although
[1:44:21] not endure sound doctrine but after
[1:44:22] their own lusts shall heap teachers
[1:44:24] having itching ears turn from truth unto
[1:44:27] fables so when he reads it reads a
[1:44:29] little bit out of order there he's
[1:44:31] recognizing now it wasn't just do the
[1:44:33] work of an evangelist and make foolproof
[1:44:35] your ministry but there'd be a fallout
[1:44:37] and a consequence of it that there'd be
[1:44:39] those that would walk away he says if
[1:44:41] that hasn't been just word by word but
[1:44:43] remember the other night when I never
[1:44:45] did read the rest of it 30-something
[1:44:47] years I've preached this Tabernacle
[1:44:49] never one time did I ever go further
[1:44:51] than that
[1:44:52] and I don't know why but now he's
[1:44:56] directed to the rest of it and he reads
[1:44:58] from 2nd Timothy 4 refers to verses 10
[1:45:00] 11 for demas hath forsaken me having
[1:45:03] loved this present world and is departed
[1:45:06] into Thessalonica
[1:45:06] Krisha stood Galatia Titus in a Dalmatia
[1:45:09] and only Luke is with me this is God's
[1:45:13] mighty man of the hour this is the first
[1:45:15] church age messenger this is the one
[1:45:17] that's a light to the Gentiles this is
[1:45:19] Saul who's now named Paul this is the
[1:45:21] one that shook off the serpent into the
[1:45:22] the fire this is the one with dreams and
[1:45:24] visions and having gone into a third
[1:45:26] heaven this is the one who both said
[1:45:28] have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord
[1:45:29] and now he's only gotten one that'll
[1:45:31] stick with him and his main man Dimas
[1:45:34] has departed having loved this present
[1:45:36] world more than the present truth and
[1:45:39] that's what brother brems pointed to now
[1:45:41] this is what he all said and sees I've
[1:45:42] never read this in 30-something years of
[1:45:44] preaching from this tyrannical I never
[1:45:46] read the rest of it I never caught that
[1:45:48] there'd be a people that would walk away
[1:45:51] then he preaches 21 days later convinced
[1:45:54] and convened concerned I had two
[1:45:56] climaxes to make I was showing them
[1:45:58] about divine healing now just two just
[1:46:01] to make you feel better
[1:46:02] I've already preached three the easy I
[1:46:03] usually have two I brought four but now
[1:46:07] I'm like right about here
[1:46:09] and I don't have anything left then that
[1:46:12] get you excited then your blood start to
[1:46:14] move a little bit you think I can make
[1:46:16] it I think I can I think I can be that
[1:46:20] little engine that could we can make it
[1:46:22] we can make it to the top tonight wait a
[1:46:25] minute
[1:46:25] this afternoon alright so I said I got
[1:46:29] two climaxes I was shown them about
[1:46:31] divine healing about visions and how God
[1:46:32] had promised everything and they were
[1:46:33] rejoicing my first climax was to tell
[1:46:36] him that all these things were the word
[1:46:37] what to get him to the real meat of it
[1:46:40] he were purpose of it and then I got to
[1:46:42] say that everybody got hungry I do
[1:46:44] preach awful long but they got hungry
[1:46:46] and they wanted to get something to eat
[1:46:48] and they started going away I said wait
[1:46:50] a minute you haven't heard it's the word
[1:46:52] and when I started to take talking back
[1:46:54] about the word and how it's done by the
[1:46:56] word everybody left
[1:46:57] it's Luke chapter 14 it's Matthew 22 you
[1:47:00] see brother branham paralleling this in
[1:47:02] every we said the people walked away the
[1:47:04] 70 left him and then he turned and said
[1:47:06] to 12 we'll use that's right
[1:47:08] I got another climax a great climax I've
[1:47:11] got to make but the sun shining bright
[1:47:13] now the evening shadows will be falling
[1:47:15] after a while they'll all be coming back
[1:47:16] again then I'll make this other climax
[1:47:19] and I raised up my hand and said glory
[1:47:21] to God I won't have to study no more
[1:47:23] because my commission in the beginning
[1:47:25] was stay with the word I'll stay with
[1:47:26] that and then when I start again I'll
[1:47:29] just background what I said and then
[1:47:30] wait for this climax he didn't have to
[1:47:33] study the preach the seals he tried that
[1:47:36] he said I would have made an awful
[1:47:37] mistake but in a time this great climax
[1:47:40] the angel comes himself so and I thought
[1:47:43] I mustn't forget and I come out of the
[1:47:45] vision and I don't know what text I had
[1:47:46] but there's another here he says it now
[1:47:48] November 25th 1962 but there's another
[1:47:52] climax coming just to sure I win any
[1:47:55] sister so that that's right here there
[1:47:56] is another climax coming at this point
[1:47:59] in his ministry he says I want to say
[1:48:01] you too you all here when the word
[1:48:04] begins to come forth you know what Peter
[1:48:06] said Lord where would we go he says stay
[1:48:09] with the word there was a few stayed I
[1:48:15] wonder if we're sufficiently impressed
[1:48:17] with the third pool
[1:48:18] he says stay with the word there was few
[1:48:21] stayed just a few more statements here
[1:48:25] he says it now just five days later
[1:48:27] excuse me a month later and the absolute
[1:48:29] as john the baptist was sent to forerun
[1:48:30] the first coming to christ i send you
[1:48:32] with a message to the world before on
[1:48:34] the second coming of christ and around
[1:48:35] the world she's went when revival fires
[1:48:37] have been built for 15 years on nearly
[1:48:39] every mountain divine healing across the
[1:48:41] nations and power and restoration and
[1:48:43] now that's great that's tremendous and
[1:48:46] now she's ready to strike that final
[1:48:49] climax yonder to bring a forth a faith
[1:48:52] that a rapture the church into glory
[1:48:53] where does it come from the opener of
[1:48:55] those seals because those seals reveal
[1:48:57] Christ he has the one that opened those
[1:48:59] selves he is those seals and rapturing
[1:49:01] faith was in the opening of that the
[1:49:03] rapture faith is in the third pool he
[1:49:05] says I believe this is coming to that
[1:49:06] this is it it's been identified as been
[1:49:08] vindicated but his caution was there's a
[1:49:12] climax they saying stay with the word
[1:49:15] don't miss that climax don't miss the
[1:49:17] point of that climax he says there was
[1:49:18] fear that stayed so what are we gonna
[1:49:22] what are we gathered around what's got
[1:49:25] our attention if the message in it is
[1:49:28] sixty two as I mentioned a moment ago
[1:49:29] we'd be left with something incomplete
[1:49:32] we would we would fellowship together in
[1:49:35] the questions of is this the sign of the
[1:49:37] answer we'd have a lot of could it be
[1:49:40] ease and I'm wondering if and my look at
[1:49:43] these and we'd still have some great
[1:49:44] things to fellowship on original sin
[1:49:46] baptism logos and Godhead all those
[1:49:49] think about all those things he mentions
[1:49:50] they're the mysteries that he mentions
[1:49:51] that we could understand had been taught
[1:49:53] and we were coming to an understanding
[1:49:54] even in those sermons we'd still have a
[1:49:56] lot to preach we still ought to say but
[1:49:58] we'd come to a place where was
[1:49:59] incomplete we'd be like Paul saying now
[1:50:01] I prophesy in part now I don't know in
[1:50:03] part but there comes a point when that
[1:50:07] which is perfect is come then that which
[1:50:09] is in part shall be done away with and
[1:50:11] what a lot of us do is we think this way
[1:50:13] well if this is if this is that which is
[1:50:16] perfect is come then whatever was in
[1:50:17] part I'll just do away with it so I say
[1:50:21] well we've got this now we've got this
[1:50:23] now now that we've got that we got this
[1:50:24] but there's a purpose come we just say
[1:50:26] well then that which is part is done
[1:50:27] away with and we just want to throw it
[1:50:29] away but no then this is assumed in the
[1:50:32] the whole this now makes sense the other
[1:50:35] part that which was in part now has
[1:50:37] place it has purpose it has meaning i
[1:50:38] when that which is perfect is come
[1:50:40] everything's absorb of us as we do have
[1:50:42] today the perfect interpretation of the
[1:50:46] word by divine vindication we have it so
[1:50:50] we don't have we don't have to be less
[1:50:52] left unsatisfied we don't have to be
[1:50:54] left hungry we don't have to be left run
[1:50:56] this what this isn't what I want this
[1:50:57] isn't what we should have
[1:50:58] nobody has laid it out for you if you're
[1:51:01] dissatisfied then come to this come to
[1:51:05] this word without reservation come to
[1:51:08] this word without qualification just
[1:51:10] come to him say Christ Here I am being
[1:51:13] on the meal talking to thy word with
[1:51:15] that one sumption without preconceived
[1:51:17] ideas Christ I come to you now and I
[1:51:20] come with the Commission give me the
[1:51:22] book I come with a voice reading in my
[1:51:27] heart give me the book and it's only
[1:51:31] when you've come to him and asked for it
[1:51:33] that he can tell you to take it need it
[1:51:35] nobody else can tell you to eat it and
[1:51:37] you can't eat it until he tells you to
[1:51:40] take it and eat it and you've got to
[1:51:41] come to him here they say give me the
[1:51:44] book it says my daughter take it and eat
[1:51:47] it so brother Branham says we'll invite
[1:51:53] the musicians to come I stopped reading
[1:51:57] and in that portion of is this the sign
[1:52:00] of the Insur brother Branham says the
[1:52:07] sunlight is never the light is never
[1:52:09] shined on us before look on this watch
[1:52:12] this I told him to watch that what was
[1:52:16] it I don't want to reap reach this it's
[1:52:19] that opening of the word the Seventh
[1:52:22] Seal has been revealed the third pool
[1:52:23] there's revelation of the seven thunders
[1:52:25] all these things now take it all the he
[1:52:27] says now look at that that's what I want
[1:52:30] you to look at look at the third pool
[1:52:31] watch the third pull then what we're
[1:52:34] doing is we're watching for squeeze and
[1:52:35] persecution and pressure and tightening
[1:52:37] and all that he says watch the third
[1:52:39] pull you watch that you'll be fine
[1:52:42] but if you try to figure out everything
[1:52:43] else that's happened in the world today
[1:52:45] could
[1:52:45] this could be that could be this be good
[1:52:47] no no no be certain watch this so that's
[1:52:50] what he pointed him to keep your eyes on
[1:52:52] this watch this and brother branham
[1:52:54] keeps telling it but he said while they
[1:52:56] were looking in he looked out of his
[1:52:58] corner of his eye and watched me and I
[1:53:01] slipped off to one side and started
[1:53:03] going towards the west towards the
[1:53:06] setting of the Sun coming up a hill
[1:53:09] going down a hill coming up a hill going
[1:53:13] down a hill getting smaller and smaller
[1:53:14] and went all the way out of sight here
[1:53:20] here the messenger goes off the same but
[1:53:24] he had a message before he left look on
[1:53:27] this don't watch me look on this and
[1:53:33] just as Elijah told Elijah don't take
[1:53:35] your eyes off me - you see me going
[1:53:37] aural I just said look on this watch
[1:53:41] this and then brother BAM goes off the
[1:53:43] scene and I realize maybe it's it's me
[1:53:45] adding a little bit of that flavor and
[1:53:46] color to it the brother BAM is going off
[1:53:48] the scene but Bertram's departed from
[1:53:50] our midst but he pointed to this and
[1:53:53] this is what it said and he said when I
[1:53:56] did that then the Brethren turned around
[1:53:59] after a while did he vanish where did he
[1:54:02] go because now they're starting to
[1:54:04] wonder well what does brother Brown I'm
[1:54:06] coming back where is he is there more to
[1:54:08] be fulfilled is there something else
[1:54:10] that needs to be happen and they're more
[1:54:11] concerned about him who left than what
[1:54:13] he left them they said where did he go
[1:54:16] and said some took out that way some
[1:54:19] took one way and some another
[1:54:22] he says a very few stayed and looked on
[1:54:26] what I had told them Oh hallelujah many
[1:54:31] were cold
[1:54:32] many were told look on this and I could
[1:54:34] say many have left and a few hallelujah
[1:54:39] a few have stayed oh god bless you for
[1:54:43] staying god bless you for being here in
[1:54:46] 2022 everything you've been through
[1:54:48] through every up and down and in and out
[1:54:50] you are still feeding on this hallelujah
[1:54:56] many were cold and a few stayed God
[1:54:59] bless the few god bless those that have
[1:55:02] stayed stay with the word everything
[1:55:06] from 1947 and if they discover a tape
[1:55:09] from 43 I'll throw it in there too
[1:55:11] everything is complete from 47 to 65
[1:55:16] it's complete because it's the fullness
[1:55:19] it's complete because it was that which
[1:55:21] was promised to come it's that which was
[1:55:23] perfect
[1:55:25] family the church age book says talks
[1:55:28] about how everyone turned on Moses he
[1:55:31] said but not all the people turned on
[1:55:32] Moses and left the Word of God the elect
[1:55:35] stayed with them the same thing has
[1:55:37] happened again today many are leaving
[1:55:41] the word but some are staying with it
[1:55:45] I'm so glad we've stayed it that
[1:55:48] wonderful we're in we're in isn't it
[1:55:52] wonderful oh I thank God that I'm part
[1:55:55] of the few that have stayed let's let
[1:55:58] these words where a may have been a long
[1:55:59] way to get to it
[1:56:00] but what my burden isn't a time like
[1:56:02] this it's so uncertain out there it's so
[1:56:04] up and down and we don't even know if
[1:56:06] things will turn around will though tell
[1:56:07] us we can't have Church again and
[1:56:09] they'll be great things happen in the
[1:56:10] world and great calamities and deaths
[1:56:12] and governments changing and ministers
[1:56:14] not only able to travel overseas and
[1:56:16] churches split I think about a
[1:56:18] Cloverdale by the way their congregation
[1:56:20] is even unable to meet even if they
[1:56:21] tried to be creative because there's a
[1:56:23] border between them I'm so glad that no
[1:56:26] matter what's going on out there I have
[1:56:28] a voice behind me saying stay online get
[1:56:32] back and step there's a voice behind me
[1:56:34] say this is the way walk in it Oh
[1:56:38] hallelujah I'm gonna stay and look on
[1:56:41] this I'm gonna keep my eyes on this
[1:56:44] message I don't need to this world
[1:56:46] interpreting my word today I want to
[1:56:49] keep my eyes on this let's stand to our
[1:56:52] feet
[1:56:53] let the few stand and say hey man let
[1:56:56] the few rejoice in his presence let the
[1:56:59] few say I think God I'm looking at the
[1:57:01] right thing
[1:57:04] hallelujah yes our prophet may be off
[1:57:08] the scene yes there may be a lot of up
[1:57:10] and down ups and downs and some took out
[1:57:13] that way and some took out the other way
[1:57:15] but a very few stayed let's bow our
[1:57:19] heads a gracious Heavenly Father no
[1:57:23] matter what I've gone through Lord I
[1:57:26] could say I'm still looking at you I've
[1:57:33] got my eyes on you through hurts and
[1:57:36] disappointments and rippings and just
[1:57:41] the gut-wrenching ripping a part of
[1:57:45] things Lord to come to place what I felt
[1:57:49] it when I was reading a brother branham
[1:57:51] the agony of late 62 is this the end of
[1:57:55] it all is this how it winds up my
[1:57:59] ministry ending with campaign managers
[1:58:02] leaving and criticisms is everything I
[1:58:05] preached is this how it ends something
[1:58:10] began to turn the Lord he had another
[1:58:14] climax Lord through all our
[1:58:17] disappointments and all our
[1:58:19] discouragements and hurts may the bride
[1:58:20] keep her eyes on that meeting in the air
[1:58:23] for as we're walking in this great
[1:58:26] climax in this climax age it has a
[1:58:29] promise that you'll never leave us nor
[1:58:33] forsake us has a promise that you'll be
[1:58:36] with us even innocent to the very end
[1:58:38] and lord I pray that you could just
[1:58:41] encourage us today to take a look at
[1:58:43] these steps in the Word of God and know
[1:58:45] through it all I'm still standing Lord I
[1:58:49] want to place myself as it were at the
[1:58:51] top of that mountain
[1:58:54] Lord we may not be brethren from Georgia

[1:59:16] this no matter how many leave I'm gonna
[1:59:19] be one of the few that stays I pray you
[1:59:22] bless the people for their stamina even
[1:59:24] today to endure the length of this
[1:59:26] sermon the Lord I believe it's
[1:59:28] indicative of this endurance they have
[1:59:30] in your word that they're staying with
[1:59:32] it to the very end I'm gonna keep on
[1:59:34] running I'm gonna keep on pressing I'm

[2:00:29] sure
[2:00:31] oh sure
[2:00:35] my singing they said good morning I got
[2:00:40] me some throne we are
[2:00:56] the second show
[2:01:06] he said good morning he is on his phone
[2:01:19] we are
[2:01:24] [Music]
[2:01:27] almost home almost home what an hour to
[2:01:34] be almost home
[2:01:35] [Music]
[2:01:37] you know I something swept over me as
[2:01:41] brother Aaron was it just seemed to put
[2:01:45] me into a different mindset and I just
[2:01:48] seemed still zooming in my mind as he
[2:01:51] began to break down that invitation to
[2:01:54] the supper hey you know I thought about
[2:01:56] all the odds I mean if you read in the
[2:02:00] Bible its ominous because all these
[2:02:03] thousands that followed him in he fed
[2:02:06] him and then they followed him no more
[2:02:08] and all of these that he sent these
[2:02:10] invitations to and none of them common
[2:02:12] it went in the hedge in the highways and
[2:02:14] found him good and bad I'm glad they
[2:02:16] found some bad ones hey man it gave me
[2:02:20] some hope compelled him to come because
[2:02:24] there was a supper ready you look at the
[2:02:28] 70 who walked away and and then he turns
[2:02:31] to 12 and says will you go also and I I
[2:02:33] got thinking I thought you know I and
[2:02:36] I'm not changing the the scripture of
[2:02:38] the crib the scripture says they went
[2:02:40] away from him and I sit there thinking
[2:02:41] with what he did but he said I'm
[2:02:45] wondering did they go away or did they
[2:02:48] get sent away you know and I'm thinking
[2:02:52] about all of this in combination and
[2:02:54] it's just building in my mind I'm
[2:02:56] thinking my goodness and even the 12
[2:02:58] even one of them was a devil and then he
[2:03:02] comes to Paul and you come there where
[2:03:05] demas has forsaken me and this one has
[2:03:07] gone here and this one is here and this
[2:03:09] one is there and only Luke is with me
[2:03:11] and you know and Anna and you just you
[2:03:14] just think about this whittling down
[2:03:15] rolling down and then I come to think
[2:03:17] about this there really is a marriage
[2:03:21] supper
[2:03:22] that's prepared Jesus truly does have a
[2:03:26] tablespread and I'm not just talking
[2:03:29] about a feast in the word I mean friends
[2:03:31] in a very real place in a very real
[2:03:35] dimension there is going to be a very
[2:03:39] real table real miles thousands of miles
[2:03:42] long with real chairs and real people
[2:03:45] that lived historically in the Old
[2:03:47] Testament the New Testament and
[2:03:48] thousands of years and you're really
[2:03:50] gonna sit in a chair across from and
[2:03:52] reach across and shake their hand
[2:03:54] well that's worry about social
[2:03:56] distancing because there won't be no
[2:03:57] viruses there and that is a real event
[2:04:02] and when I when that begin to set down
[2:04:04] upon me I almost felt ah hard to
[2:04:08] describe almost like a knot in my
[2:04:11] stomach to think what if I didn't see it
[2:04:14] what if I what if I couldn't see this of
[2:04:17] all of these all these that were there
[2:04:20] and saw it and walked away and all these
[2:04:22] that were there and predict of it and
[2:04:23] were sent away and all these that were
[2:04:25] there and missed out on it and only a
[2:04:26] very few state how did I end up getting
[2:04:29] to be a few say some people say how am I
[2:04:35] going to make it to the end well I just
[2:04:37] say I don't know how I got here all I
[2:04:41] know is God rich and mercy love me open
[2:04:45] my eyes I see it I can't help it
[2:04:48] so I'm not too worried about him getting
[2:04:51] me the rest of the way hallelujah the
[2:04:54] God who found me and bring me home Oh
[2:04:58] friends you know I if you're if you're
[2:05:02] here today and you're gonna try to so
[2:05:08] now qualify all that in your mind to say
[2:05:10] or here's why I believe it here's why
[2:05:13] well I saw that wel maeín saw and don't
[2:05:16] believe well God did that well God did
[2:05:18] millions of things for millions of
[2:05:19] people who don't yet follow it you know
[2:05:21] well but it makes sense if it made sense
[2:05:23] to them to make sense to the devil the
[2:05:26] message makes sense to the devil he
[2:05:28] knows it's true
[2:05:29] when I just want to let me just cut to
[2:05:32] the chase for you if you're trying to
[2:05:34] figure out how you earned it
[2:05:36] just listen you didn't you figure out
[2:05:39] how trying to figure out how you deserve
[2:05:40] this you don't so you know what you do
[2:05:43] you just lean back and just say grace
[2:05:47] God's grace and you know what if I
[2:05:51] really am if I if we really are and I
[2:05:56] believe we really are at the at the end
[2:06:00] of the end time for man's history and we
[2:06:03] are almost home and the world is falling
[2:06:08] apart in an unprecedented way that's not
[2:06:10] my language that's politicians language
[2:06:13] scientists language business owners
[2:06:15] language Wall Street's language they
[2:06:17] said it's unprecedented we're an
[2:06:20] uncharted territory you know it should
[2:06:22] be that if you're that close to home we
[2:06:25] should the world should be at what you
[2:06:27] see happening is should be happening if
[2:06:29] we're that close to that table in the
[2:06:31] sky and that being the case I won't say
[2:06:35] if that's the case I'll say that being
[2:06:37] the case because it's evidently so then
[2:06:40] yeah I get it
[2:06:42] i get how brother branham thought mine
[2:06:44] is this the signing I still got loved
[2:06:47] ones I still got people I care about who
[2:06:50] aren't who aren't who aren't in the fold
[2:06:51] yet then I just say what a greater time
[2:06:54] to fall back on the grace of God and say
[2:06:58] Lord I'm I'm gonna start speaking the
[2:07:00] word I'm gonna claim all my loved ones
[2:07:02] all my family all my children all my
[2:07:05] parents oh my can all of you love me all
[2:07:08] those who I love I'm here today some
[2:07:09] friends you know you're not to limit the
[2:07:12] God of Israel so I just say if I'm in
[2:07:15] this kind of an hour that I'm gonna go
[2:07:17] big and I'm gonna say Lord I want to
[2:07:20] become a perfect man I want to have all
[2:07:22] my family with me I want to be at the
[2:07:24] table I want to get on with this thing
[2:07:26] and I'm just gonna say in the name of
[2:07:28] Jesus Christ let it be so you have
[2:07:31] arrived at such an hour as this
[2:07:36] my goodness well it has been a great day
[2:07:41] to be in the house of God are you happy

[2:07:59] spiritual gastro Jubilee amen so we're
[2:08:04] happy in the Lord happy to have had
[2:08:05] brother Aaron here I I hate that it just
[2:08:09] the one-stop shopping today but amen
[2:08:11] amen
[2:08:12] you can bring those four again and bring
[2:08:15] four more next time we're gonna try to
[2:08:17] get him back again next month would be
[2:08:19] hosting ministers meeting here so he he
[2:08:22] and his family and I told him such
[2:08:24] Elizabeth makes sure brings y'all to
[2:08:25] amen stay another week a man praise the
[2:08:28] Lord that just be good or and good
[2:08:30] that's how you go from good to gooder so
[2:08:33] we're happy in the Lord I sure thank all
[2:08:35] of y'all for coming out today
[2:08:37] amen we're gonna sing it again and we'll
[2:08:39] let you go and be dismissed and I just
[2:08:42] want to say God bless you just to the
[2:08:43] whole church to you here to the audience
[2:08:46] streaming
[2:08:47] say brother Jason when are we gonna be
[2:08:49] back to normal I wish I had an answer
[2:08:51] for that we're just having to play it by
[2:08:53] ear we don't know even the authorities
[2:08:56] and scientists the best minds in the
[2:08:58] world don't know how this is going to go
[2:09:01] they're only speculating they're
[2:09:02] estimating they're thinking well maybe
[2:09:04] and so I can just tell you if it if it
[2:09:07] keeps releasing and the government keeps
[2:09:09] relaxing and I'm what I'm having to
[2:09:11] watch the attitude remember friends we
[2:09:13] we've come this far protecting our
[2:09:16] testimony it was the only reason we did
[2:09:17] it because we're protecting their
[2:09:20] testimony in the community so I've got
[2:09:22] to know it's not just based on while the
[2:09:24] governor said okay you know no holds
[2:09:26] barred well I've got to gauge the the
[2:09:29] mindset of the community because we
[2:09:32] wouldn't want to bring a disgrace after
[2:09:34] we've already spent this much time being
[2:09:37] careful you know we don't want to cross
[2:09:39] the finish line too quick on that
[2:09:41] so we'll see say when we be back to
[2:09:43] normal we'll see I'll let you know I'll
[2:09:45] keep you posted I send out those letters
[2:09:47] to you periodically to try to
[2:09:49] be posted so we're figuring it out as we
[2:09:51] go as far as I know next week end now
[2:09:55] this coming Wednesday this crowd here
[2:09:57] you'll be invited back K through Z and
[2:10:00] any of our special distance drivers or
[2:10:03] anything that are coming in and able to
[2:10:06] come in even though they're named letter
[2:10:08] doesn't fall within that parameter but
[2:10:10] you're able to come you're still welcome
[2:10:12] to come this Wednesday and then as far
[2:10:14] as I know the following Sunday we'll be
[2:10:16] back to a through J and we'll just have
[2:10:19] to keep doing that until we feel that we
[2:10:21] can just go A to Z amen amen and then
[2:10:25] we'll get everybody back all at once
[2:10:27] praise the name of the Lord
[2:10:29] y'all such a beautiful bunch of people
[2:10:30] you're probably sitting near family
[2:10:33] members so it's kind of how we purposed

[2:10:39] least with your family smile at
