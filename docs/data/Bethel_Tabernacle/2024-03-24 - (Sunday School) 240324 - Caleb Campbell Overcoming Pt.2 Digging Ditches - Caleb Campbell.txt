========================================

ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just come before you this morning Lord we just pray that father we can come into your presence father we pray that you would anoint the word Lord and just open it up to us father we love you now and we just give you our hearts and Minds now in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you as you take your seats this morning we're going to take a a part two this morning from the last time we spoke our subject was overcoming um I may have a few things that sound familiar from last time but most of it is new material I I uh I'm hoping to get get to all my notes but I I don't want to rush through things so it's hard having a burden and trying to put it in 30 minutes Amen brother Benham says this in how can I overcome he says overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks a lot of people said there is no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil then the same time that you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one that's in you has already overcome him amen and by his grace you are more than a match for him the devil amen that's real overcoming when you recognize you look back and say I'm doing this I'm doing that then no you're defeated but there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit then you realize you overcome and you know that he is a devil and a little bit further down he says You must realize that the Holy Spirit that's in you has already overcome this thing and he's in you and you overcome by him that's exactly sensible it's exactly the way the scripture is written overcoming so and we talked a little bit last time on the key to overcoming it's it's Jesus Christ Living in you living out of you and that's the badge that you show the devil when he comes against you the holy ghost amen you know brother Matt did a a great job of breaking this down Wednesday night Christ in you the hope of glory he's already overcome everything you're just walking in the footsteps he's laid out for you in your life and you know we touched on overcoming when it comes to our thought life specifically thoughts towards our brothers or our sisters in the Lord and how the devil can sneak into our life and grab a hold of the flaws and the failures of our brothers and our sisters and then start magnifying those things and if we're not careful we begin start to start tolerating those thoughts and eventually that leads to embracing those thoughts and then that leads to strife and disunity if you begin to tolerate and embrace I had this scripture last time on my heart I didn't get to it 1 Thessalonians 51 says wherefore Comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also so ye do and we beseech you Brethren to know them which labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you and to esteem them very highly in love for their work sake and be at peace among yourselves verse 14 says now we exhort you Brethren warn them warn them that are unruly Comfort the feeble-minded support the weak and be patient towards all men I wanted to capitalize on that scripture be patient towards all men I heard brother Chris Kathy speak about it in his sermon several weeks ago I thought it was worth repeating don't discredit someone in their walk if they're not where you're at in your Christian walk amen we be patient towards all men we're all coming into our position in Jesus Christ and we're all now you know we're all moving into that place we're all coming into our maturity amen and some may be further along or have more experience but we're all believers and we're all working towards the same common goal and that scripture says to be patient towards all men so if a brother or a sister maybe isn't where they need to be pray for them amen spiritual maturity doesn't just happen overnight amen of course the Holy Ghost will set in order things in people's life but every war is B is is one one battle at a time amen we can't think lowly of our brothers or our Sisters in Christ if they do something wrong forgive them care about them love them and think about it the way that God thinks about you forgive them the way God forgave you amen the brothers were uh going through this sermon we've been they've been going through this sermon on Thursday nights and I heard this quote this past Thursday and it struck me he says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed paragraph 866 says if the brother if you think he's a little wrong or the sister say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up CU it'll affect him and it'll take the Christ right out of your life that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it'll run him from the Tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of God or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything see don't do that amen we have to be so conscious of how we speak towards one another brother bom says if we're not careful it'll take Christ right out of our Lives I don't want Christ out of my life amen and all of those things those things that he mentioned there malice and jealousy and hatred and bitterness all of those things begin they spring up in your mind as a simple thought maybe against an individual whether they did something wrong or not and it takes an active decision in your life to Captivate that thing you give it to the Holy Ghost and then he puts it down amen you take those thoughts captive in the name of God otherwise it grows and it becomes Strife amen because I believe the Lord wants to do more in our life I believe he wants to do more wants to do more in my life I believe he wants to do more in your life amen but our thought process is still in this Earthly realm so often times and if we can just start putting on the goggles of the Lord Jesus Christ and start looking through those goggles at everybody in our life look I look at you and I look at you I look at all my brothers and sisters through the goggles that Jesus Christ looks through because brother renom says that he looks at you through the blood so all he sees is the perfected work amen so if we start looking at each other through that same perfected work because we are written Epistles read of all men amen we are Sons and Daughters of Christ so if we put on those lenses and start looking at your brother maybe they're not where they need to be but pray them there pray them where they need to be and God will be faithful to get them where they need to be amen you remember um I heard I heard a brother talking about this uh uh about Peter several several months ago and those Believers there in the upper room how they were in one mind and one Accord you know that means they weren't thinking about the person's flaws or about their past failures or about what that person did or that person did or what this person said or what this preacher may have said you know they were they had reached a point in that upper room it took them a long time but they reached a point in that upper room where they were in a real Unity among each other and they had finally reached that point where they weren't thinking about each other anymore they were thinking about Christ they had Christ's lenses on in that upper room that day amen and you know they had a whole lot of failures to look past especially because they were talking about Peter especially Peter I mean he this guy he failed a lot he he denied Christ he cursed I mean on the last day that Christ was was alive or the last couple of days imagine you you look at someone and you say why you you know you denied Christ how many times in our life we go through those things and we look at somebody you denied Christ look we need to start looking at the finished product amen they had to take that thought into captivity because Peter became the spokesperson of Pentecost and they had to get past that thought process amen and in this evil day that we live in we have to actively apply apply those scriptures every day in our life to the to those mind battles we face not not just hearing the word but applying it and being active in the principles we hear read over the pulpit or read in our homes or listen to it to a tape and and really step into it um my subject this morning was overcoming and then my um my subtitle was digging ditches uh I was listening to the prophet the other day brother brandom takes a text out of 2 Kings chapter 3 where the king of Edom the king of Judah and the king of Israel were all at a time and they were together and they were seeking help against their common Enemy at the time and they were afraid that their enemy the king of Moab were going to overtake all three of their armies so they inquired of the prophet in the land at the time which was Elisha and then Elisha inquired of the Lord and how Elisha inquired of the lord it's really a cool Story 2 Kings chapter 3 I recommend you go and read it but he had a minstral playing and the presence of the Lord came into the into that place and spoke to Elisha and the word that came from the Lord was make this Valley full of ditches so he inquired of the Lord about this battle that was going to take place and about this this storm that was going on in their life and he said the Lord said make this Valley full of ditches and the Lord said in that scripture he said it's not going to come by rain there's not going to be any any wi so in other words he wasn't going to do anything in the natural way that we think it's going to take place it was going to be a supernatural means that he was going to H it was going to take place in and he says you will defeat the entire Army but there is a work for you to do they had a task at hand and I I want to paraphrase the quote brother random says just for time sake but brother random said that the main principle was to prepare for the water to come amen and to get the ditches dug out in the land at that time amen so if you think about this you see God is going to move in our lives he's going to overcome every enemy that you will ever Face bottom line period he will over he's already done it so you will overcome that thing but sometimes it takes actively digging your ditches in your life and what that means is is he's going to provide the water he's going to provide the word he's going to provide the weapons all of it but we've got to make ready for that water to come we've got to make ready for the Holy Ghost to pour out into our lives so there's something young people old people there's something for you to do as well in your life you got to start digging those ditches in your home spiritually speaking you know the we've always we're always talking about how we've got to empty out so he can come and fill us and once we've once we've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost he wants to give us more you more you receive that now you're placed into that position and you you'll never be able to be separated from the love of God Amen but you're always stepping higher into the maturity of Christ amen you're always coming into a a furtherance of God and so you've got to dig ditches what that means you got to dig out those thoughts against your brothers or your sisters you got to dig out those indifferences that you feel towards one another you know you see cuz it's a two-fold process that takes place you see when you when you get a shovel just physically speaking you go get a shovel and you start digging into the ground you start running into things amen that a shovel eventually cannot get out of the ground you start running into Roots you start running into trees but what you've done now is you've exposed that thing so something greater can come into that place and extract that so sometimes we've got things in our life we've got trials we've got mind battles we've got weaknesses we've got doubts you got to expose that thing to the Holy Ghost and you got to dig that ditch and say God I can't do this by myself but I'm going to expose this thing to God right now I want to expose this I'm going to be vulnerable for you so that you can come in and take the Holy Ghost Machinery that you have and extract that thing out of my life and then not leave it that way because God doesn't want to leave you an empty hole in the ground he wants to fill you he wants to pour out his Spirit he wants to give you without measure his spirit amen so when you start running into those things you're going to run into roots in your life where you cannot get out of it by yourself you're going to run into trials you're going to run into anxiety you're going to run into doubts that you cannot extract by yourself but what you do is you start digging that thing out and you say God I can't do this by myself but I know that greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world so you start extracting it you start being vulnerable Lord I know I'm too weak but I know that you're strong and you're living in me so father I give it to you and then he starts pulling that thing out and it's just as easy as that for him to do but he needs you to expose that thing to him amen he's not going to come in and he's not going to push you through a pipe like brother Jason always says quoting brother brand he's not going to do that he's got to have you do something too amen yes amen but God will do the rest young people don't get caught up in your mind that you're a failure in life because you're struggling with something don't let the devil keep that thing hidden in your heart don't let that happen you give that thing over to God and he will do his part he will do his part amen but he needs you to open up to him he needs you to be vulnerable so that he can come in and he can get rid of that thing amen you just start digging you expose that thing and then even better he'll pour His Spirit out in that place in that thing in your in the anger in your life in the resentment in your life and those things you're going to just start expressing God you're going to start expressing love you're going to start expressing the attributes of Christ because you are written Epistles read of all men in and God wants to work through you that's how he works on this world he works through his sons and his daughters so you can take something like a root of bitterness you can take those things anger that you used to struggle with you can take the anxiety you can take those things and say I know I want struggle with that and maybe sometimes they come in because roots are buried deep down inside but and sometimes they feel like they still got hold but you can say God I know you delivered me here you can do it again again I need you here amen wow you got to empty out so that that that gusher brother bom calls it a gusher of the Holy Ghost can pour into our lives have prayer meetings in your home with your family start digging those ditches take the time to pray with your kids confess your wrongs to your wife to your husband confess those things give it out there put it out there so that God can come in and and do something listen to tapes in your home get rid of the distractions and the carnalities because the prophet says it like this there's coming a gusher if you'll get ready for it but if you don't make ready for it you'll never see it I want to see it don't you he says lay aside everything every sin that so easily besets you he says acting as if someone he was talking just he says brother random I don't do nothing and he's just asking if meaning as if someone's talking to him brother random I don't do nothing and he's answering himself and he says maybe that's what's the matter that's the trouble of it it's more sin not to do than it is to do good and know better that's right he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it sin you've got to make ready doing nothing is the worst you can do if you don't if you come to church and you sit on a Pew every Sunday and every Wednesday but you don't dig those ditches in your life every other day of the week then it just becomes a seat and a Pew on a church You' got to dig those things in your life you got to be willing to expose the flaws you got to be willing to expose your failures to God so that he can extract those things from you amen we ought to dig those overcoming ditches you know we know that the water is going to come and I love that story second Kings chapter 3 go read it this week I love that story there in the Old Testament because God uses a supernatural means that creating the water to gush in in a dry and a desolate desert and he used that water to deceive the enemy listen he says because when the mo when the moabites when that enemy started to come it it said it was in the morning time so the sun rose and the sun just as the sun was Rising it was it was pointing at that water and as it was pointing at that water it was almost like a mirage and it says that it looked like that it was blood so he was deceiving the enemy because now the enemy thought that those three armies had fought each other so they went down to take the spoils of that of those three it was the Israelites and uh the kingdom of Judah they went down to take the spoils because they thought they fought each other so they were completely unprepared for that fight and they went down there unprepared and the Israelites ran defeated them ran them into their armies so sometimes the very thing that God is wanting you to do it's it's to use it to defeat the enemy with and a lot of s and I just to just to be so transparent a lot of times you've got to dig those things so the water can flow in because they were given a word now listen here they were given a word and it wasn't something that they understood you know at the T we can look at scriptures and we can see at that time now now we've got a full picture of it this is why God did this he did this because he needed to deceive the enemy and then he was going to use that to have the Israelites drive it but we we look at that now but sometimes God imagine being in their position you want me to dig ditches I need you to fight that enemy what do you mean I we're going to dig some ditches God needs you to do something in your life maybe that we don't understand amen we don't always understand they weren't given a full picture of understanding it wasn't something for them to understand they needed to trust God's plan in it amen sometimes you need to trust God's plan in the situation and stay right with it and sometimes we're given things in our life trials that you just don't understand tests instructions and we don't understand them but God's ways are higher than our ways and sometimes it's not a time of understanding it's a time of trusting because God is going to use that thing to defeat the enemy Hallelujah prise God the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 10: 4-5 it says for the weapons of our are not carnal But Mighty through the god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imagination and every High thing that it exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ every single thought sometimes you've got to take your own thoughts captives because God's ways are past finding out so sometimes he's got something for you to do that seems absolutely ridiculous but he's looking for you not to to not understand it he's looking at you to obey him because down the road it's going to be Mighty it's going to be powerful it's going to be something amen it's going to be powerful amen he just looking for you to dig that ditch another translation puts it like this we use God's Mighty weapons not worldly weapons to knock down the strongholds of human reasoning and to destroy false arguments and I read the message translation of the scripture and I thought it was so powerful in uh from from 2 Corinthians 10 it says the world is unprincipled it's a dog eat dog world out there the world doesn't fight fair but we don't live or fight our battles that way never have excuse me and never will the tools of our trade aren't for marketing or for manipulation they are for the or for demolishing that entirely massively corrupt culture we use our powerful God tools for smashing warped FL philosophies tearing down barriers erected against the truth of God fitting every loose thought and emotion and impulse into the structure of Life shaped by Christ Our tools are ready at hand for clearing the ground for every obstruction and building lives of obedience into maturity so our tools our our shovels are in our hand clearing the ground of every obstruction and building lives of obedience into maturity obedience into maturity amen so the the tools of our trade are they're for demolishing the entire corrupt culture it says you know you know I I was thinking about this you know culture changes over time it does I was thinking about the other day just the degradation of society in in something as simple as as the way people dress not just women men just the same what began as something completely abnormal and unaccepted eventually became tolerated in society and John Wesley pins it perfectly tolerate when one generation tolerates another generation Embraces that's why we are as Believers are never to tolerate the culture of this world because the culture changes of the world but God's culture never changes you know the word tolerate means it means to allow the existence of or it means willing to accept behavior and beliefs that are different from your own although you might not agree with them or approve of them I thought it was important to Define that because our practice is to be completely intolerant of the devil and his tactics amen when the enemy places thoughts in your mind recognize those thoughts to be not your thoughts recognize those thoughts to be not godly thoughts and put them into captivity reject the very appearance of it shun the appearance of evil the Bible says don't give him any place because what happens is is if you let that thought linger you begin to tolerate it amen when you tolerate it then you begin to embrace it amen once you've embraced it then you've lost the battle because a a word is a thought expressed amen and we always use that in the positive connotation but it has a negative connotation as well when a word is a thought expressed that means that thought has taken captivity in your mind and now you've allowed yourself to express that thought and it's become a negative action in your life wow amen that's what happened to the the Israelites there in the Old Testament they began to tolerate evil in their land when God deliberately told them not to give their land they don't even don't even pay tribute to them don't allow them to stay on your land even as your even as your slaves do not do it and they did because their thinking they thought their thinking was highly elevated amen but you know and we're all familiar with that with that with that scripture it led to destruction and what happens is the longer you tolerate a certain thing the more comfortable that you become with it I don't know about you but I don't ever want to be comfortable with anything the devil has to offer look at what look at what the Toleration has led to in the world it wasn't just a a Christian practice to dress modestly until the late 1800s it was inappropriate for women to even show their ankles in public in one article I read it saw it said in the 1800s women dressed in dresses in a way that emphasize modesty and femininity and and I'm not getting bogged down on just the way we dress but I'm just showing it because the natural types the spiritual and the lines are blurred to what is right and what isn't but thanks be to God it's not for believers amen we've got our standard amen and we live by the standard that's the word of God Amen you know brother Jason he's been emphasizing the set aart ones amen these past few Services the set apart ones have one culture and that is the Bible whatever the Bible says anything out of those boundaries we don't entertain or else we risk getting sucked into the modern culture and by embracing the way maybe the world dresses or the way the world Acts or the way the world talks you know or even worse you start embracing the way modern Christianity talks or the modern Christianity Acts or modern Christianity dresses and if we begin tolerating it in our lives we're risking our kids embracing it and more than just our kids because we're living in such a dark time and a mind boggling age that even in our own lives if we tolerate something it doesn't take an entire generation anymore that to become an embrace it it just takes a little bit of time and that and that Toleration leads to embracing that embracing leads to a thought that thought leads to an expression that expression leads to something that is ungodly amen so young young people everybody be intolerant of this world be intolerant of the devil and his tactics live with a higher standard take action in your walk dig ditches in your spiritual life that will allow the Lord Jesus to come in and to expose those things and be vulnerable to the Lord open up open so that he can open up him himself more to you and those things that hinder you in your walk you know if there's no room for him to come come in then he won't come in amen you know th those that maybe AR aren't concerned about maybe attendance or or concerned about listening to the prophet every day or you know maybe it's time for a change in our life maybe it's time for a fresh outpouring of God if youve and if you've never been concerned with it maybe it's time for an acts to experience in your life dig that ditch of Allowing God to come in say God if I I don't know if I've got the Holy Ghost dig that ditch expose that to God and say God I want that so bad and he will be faithful and just there is one way it's acts two repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen amen you know you'll always be at war with your flesh man and and you're doing the wrong thing Romans Paul makes that clear in Romans 7 he says I'm it seems that I'm always at war with myself amen I'm Waring against my own members but we've got the tools to overcome keep digging those ditches in your life amen and it'll make way for more of God to flow into you amen I just a couple of closing comments this morning I I I've been I was just reading yesterday studying for this Romans four or uh I'm sorry numbers 14 the Lord just put my put this scripture on my heart as I was studying and I thought it was just an incredible point to end on for overcoming for an overcoming Topic in numbers 13 and 14 when it came time to spy out for their Pro Promised Land This was when they went to Kadesh Baria there was several spies Joshua and Caleb being among them they they they went there and you remember the spies gave their testimony that their the the enemy is too great the land is Joshua said Joshua Caleb they Steed the people and said we are well able to overcome the land you know the Israelites actually got afraid and angry at that they started picking up stones and murmuring against Aaron and Moses and as they did that the glory of the Lord appeared in the Tabernacle and he actually came on the scene and spoke to Moses and I thought this was so awesome I'm almost finished he says this wasn't and this so this this scripture uh numbers 14:24 this isn't this isn't Moses's testimony of Caleb this was God's testimony of him he says but my servant Caleb because he had another spirit with him hath followed me fully land where he and his seed shall possess it God said that that was God's testimony about Caleb God God said that he has a different spirit and that he followed him fully imagine God's testimony of you being that you're different from the rest of the world and that you followed him fully that you're that you want to follow his words wholeheartedly not begrudgingly because you have to this is the life of an overcomer you hearken unto the to the word of the Lord and when the rest of the world is doing what they want or maybe your friends are doing what they want you've taken the pledge to follow him fully amen You' you to follow the teachings of God's Prophet fully and entirely you know the difference in Caleb and those other spies that went out is Caleb didn't let fear overcome him no doubt he saw the exact same thing that they saw you go through things in your life and sometimes it can be overwhelming but Caleb brought
