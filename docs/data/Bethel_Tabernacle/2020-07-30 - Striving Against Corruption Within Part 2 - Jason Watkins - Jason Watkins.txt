get him amen so you pray sister rosa has been praying a man like crazy for this hour and we've there's been times where he suggested he would and then when i call him and talk to him it seems like he's not sure but this time he was very very certain so we want to just pray that the lord make a way for that i haven't been able to reach his family just yet so don't know what kind of reaction they're going to give us but hey can we put it on the prayer list tonight amen to disbelieve that brother richard he wants to be back here among us so we're just going to believe and the lord will bless that amen all right second corinthians chapter four i want to uh you may have gotten the notice i sent out to just let you know we want to continue with striving against corruption within this will be part two we're continuing from sunday second corinthians chapter 4 and want to begin right at verse 1. second corinthians 4 and 1. therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not but have renounced to the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh in our mortal flesh isn't that wonderful so it's not just i'm i think i'm a christian i live like one amen and let's go a few chapters over to chapter seven second corinthians chapter seven and uh and we'll catch two verses here second corinthians seven verse five for when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without were fightings with let me start again for when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without where fightings within were fears nevertheless god that comforteth those that are cast down comforted us by the coming of titus and not by his coming only but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you when he told us your earnest desire your mourning your fervent mind toward me so that i rejoice the more let's pray father we thank you for your word i ask that you take over now lord and bring forth this thought that you have on my heart i give it completely into your hands in jesus name amen god bless your friends you can be seated you know paul drawing some conclusions that we want to look at this evening you know we're we're taking this subject striving against corruption within we started on that sunday because we had as you remember before that preached on striving against corruption and that was the corruption that we see in the world around us and you know we don't want to just uh ignore that even tonight there's madness on the streets and it's chaotic in the world that we live in it makes no sense the things that we see it proves that demon power is driving the agenda of mankind around the world because what we see defies logic it defies common sense and it defies everything and every standard i mean if you think about it there's there's there's really no moral or scruple or standard uh that that the world used to enjoy just 50 or 100 years ago that are in place still today every one of them have been upended uh the the the sacredness of marriage the sacredness of getting married if you're going to live together the sacredness of staying married and to to banish the idea of that it's anything less than death do us part the the nuclear family of a husband and a wife and you know how that children ought to be raised up in the fear of god and how that we ought to you know our lives ought to be a worship to the lord how we should attend church how we should have a testimony how we should be godly and escu evil and and the vices of the world of uh you know have always been thought of in those times as as as evil vices of alcohol and things like that and you know we we find that that the world has just completely flipped prayer in school is gone you know uh the the the very foundation that our nation was established on of christianity now nobody wants to try to assume anymore you know they they don't like the idea of anything to do with religion they want the government to be free of all religion yet this government was founded on the principles of the christian religion that's undeniable in history and so we realized friends that that that everything you know from the workplace to the uh schools of learning to homes and the families and children and and marriage and everything you know identity and gender identity and it used to be that how you were born is what you knew you were and and so today people people don't even they can't even figure out you know i i i know this that 23 chromosomes came from my mother and 23 came from my father and my mother i think uh delivered all the x and my dad delivered the why so i turned out to be a man and and had it been the other way around i'd have been a female but you know what i was born a man and i am a man and no amount of brainwashing or demon power can get me to think i'm not amen but that's literally the world that we live in today everything of value has been upended and reversed and it's not surprising to us when brother branham would say that paul's prophecy has been fulfilled in our day satan is now the god of this evil age jesus knew that the age would be evil he told us about it he warned us about it he warned that the days of noah would return they have the bible pro that when you look at the days of noah that they were married and given in marriage and and men of renown and you know or were doing these things and you know right before that you had sons of god looked upon the daughters of man took unto them wives intermingled god's uh family tree from coming from seth and and so we realized brother branham interpreted that to us that that the the sons of seth took unto them the daughters of cain and married them and began to intermingle uh the race like that and so you know it got to a point where the whole world in the days of noah and every man's mind was evil continually and jesus said that time will return at the end time and you'll know it's the end time when you see that he's talk talks about the days of lot when when uh um you know sodom was there and the um the uh the lb g q t z x y whatever they want to call it that was there that lived there that lives now that was prominent there that's prominent now that was accepted there you were criticized if you didn't and it's now here it's all the same well i'm here to tell you you know they can they can they cannot like it if they want but homosexuality is a mortal sin that you'll go to hell for it's contrary to the bible and it's contrary to the teachings from genesis to revelation it's a demon spirit amen that people have given over to and you know it's uh the word is still the word it doesn't matter that the age has become what it's become the word is still the word and therefore believers should still be believers sons of god today should look just like sons of god in in the first church sons of god today should act just like they did in the first church say well but the world is more evil yeah but the mighty god's unveiled amen we have a we have a more sure word of prophecy do you realize that when peter talks about in his day you go back 2000 years and peter making his statement the context of peter's statement when he said we have a more sure word of prophecy then that's the same as saying we now have the word of the prophets made more sure because we s we're in the day when it got fulfilled so back there when isaiah prophesied it the old testament saints believed it but to us it's a more sure word because we've lived it we saw it and so now you bring that context today i'm here to tell you the church knew what jesus prophesied but today we have a more sure word of prophecy because we're living in the day he said would be here when paul said perilous times we get it today we have a more sure word of prophecy he promised that he would reveal his word he promised that he would come with an open book today we have a more sure word of prophecy he promised that there would be a bride in the end time who would not be deceived we have a more sure word of prophecy amen you can bank your soul on that the word of god is the safety the place of safety where you can bank your soul the souls of everything and everyone you love don't worry put them on the word you won't go wrong you won't be left holding the bag you won't get the short end of the stick the bible says if you if trust the lord you won't be ashamed you're never going to blush you're never going to get embarrassed oh wow the lord failed me that's never going to happen amen so paul is saying you know i i live the right kind of life and i'm it's it's it's you know i commend myself to every man's conscience in the sight of god and so he's making the case that we have this ministry we've received it we faint not we renounce the hidden things of dishonesty and so he comes down to say so if the gospel is hid then it's hid watch it but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost see in other words it's not because i'm falling down on the job that they don't see it i am projecting the life of christ and if they don't see it it's because they're lost see so you say why does the world so disagree with this message because they're lost amen anytime you disagree with the truth of god's word it's because you're lost it doesn't mean you're a horrible person it means you're lost it means you need to be born again it means you need to surrender to the holy ghost and let him reveal himself to you because if you're going to make it to heaven you have to come god's provided way we have arrived at such a time at a junction of time where you know the the the church has had times where there were junctions and you know azusa revival was a a junction the opening of the seals is a junction when satan became the god of the evil age when the days of noah and lot had returned that was a junction i'm here to tell you something friends a prophet went away that was a junction because now the word is going to be hidden in these earthen vessels you understand so he talks about that so we have this treasure for god who commanded the light now this was god he commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ so he's saying look that same god that created heavens and earth hid himself in christ now that's wonderful but guess what that wasn't it that he wasn't finished because when he comes to the book of revelation it's now going to be his life in the church and so paul says now we have that same treasure what treasure the treasure that created the world the treasure that lived in jesus we have it in earth and vessels it's in me it's in you but remember the power that it's that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us because you could not make you into the christian that you are it had to be god and i think every one of us would be honest enough to admit that and therefore when we go forward we're not surprised when we find ourselves oh you know bearing in our bodies the dying of the lord jesus we we shouldn't be surprised when we're troubled on every side and distressed see we're troubled on every side but not distressed in that amazing statement to be troubled on every side and not be distressed to be troubled on every side means you're surrounded it means you can't avoid the trouble you can't you can't parry or step left or right you'll run into trouble so you literally have to the christian has the ability when when the light of god's glory is hidden inside you you have the ability to stand in the center of honest of inescapable darkness and be a light and suffer no distress in other words it the the devil has no ability to shut you down so we're persecuted but we're not forsaken we are cast down we are yeah we are cast down it happens but we're not destroyed that that rankles the devil that he knocks you down and he don't end up destroying you and you know what you do you get back up and he comes and knocks you down again thinks he's got it turns to walk away and you're already getting back up dusting yourself off again i am cast down but i'm not destroyed well i'm gonna bring trouble on you fine surround me in it but it's not gonna distress me because i have a treasure hidden inside of me [Music] we've reached a junction of time friends that junction of time that we've reached is now the transition the last transition of our earthly bodies into a new realm and you know this is when we talk about divine healing let's just take that for an example do you realize that divine healing is part of the resurrection amen that that that what god does is he gives you when he heals your body you get a little temporary resurrection and he takes cells that are wrong and disease and affliction inside the blood or inside the body or inside some organ and he literally takes it and just fixes it now how did he do that the same power that's created the world it's creative power he just simply will take a diseased heart and say be whole and suddenly it's whole he'll take a cancer and say the lord rebuke thee and the life is gone and the cancer shrivels that is resurrection power that is a little dip of what will eventually not just heal an organ or heal your blood or heal your skin or heal your head it'll heal your whole body and change you into a glorified condition it'll literally change you at the molecular level and you will have a glorious body a glorified body like unto his glorious body so so god he always and this is an important point god always uses his word and so whether or not it's god delivering you of a physical affliction maybe your affliction's not physical maybe you've got some physical afflictions but they're brought on by things like stress and worry and mental anxiety and those things will give you physical situations they will cause physical conditions brother brown talks about worry he said don't worry because that will put i i don't fully understand this maybe dr meredith would understand a little better but he said don't worry because that'll put acid in your blood and give you arthritis so the inflammation somehow comes from that he talks about you know uh fear and worry and these kind of things they'll actually cause cancer so so the devil knows brotherhood says every disease is a fourth dimension disease when it starts out see so we live in three dimensions and satan is in that fifth dimension and the fourth dimension is the is the ethereal waves the we call them we'd say microwaves radio waves or signals like that but but it's that it's that ethereal realm that satan comes from that dimension of the of the lost into this dimension and afflicts your body and therefore you have a right to go to the lord and say i got a trespasser hanging on me and by your stripes that calvary i have the right to be healed and so you claim it and the devil has to go right back where he came from see and so whether god is delivering you of a physical disease or an emotional illness some mental illness some something like that that's in your spirit realm remember that your body is made up of ten senses you have ten inlet five inlets and five outlets you have your your sight and your smell and your your taste and your hearing and your touch but inside of that you have memory and conscience and reason and affection and imagination and those are all ten of them in a fallen state the only thing about you that's converted is your heart now the nature of the spirit is christ because a seed gene came to life and an old nature was annihilated so the greatest battle ever fought begins and now the inside of the inside that soul realm that word realm that god realm has got to begin to have dominion over the memories and over the conscience and over the affection and over the flesh and over what i see and look at and touch and taste and handle hallelujah and so we have this excellency in earth and vessels but it's supposed to live through us and conquer this fallen man bring him into put a thus listen friends the holy ghost gives you the ability to put the same chain on satan that the angel will take lucifer and with a chain and cast a memory in the book of revelation because it's not a physical chain it's a chain of circumstance that he don't have anybody to work through i i'd like to use that chain tonight i don't need to wait for a millennium and an angel to do it i'm a son of god and i'll take that same chain of circumstance and say you're not having any any rainy result in me oh boy i am dedicated to almighty god put him in a chain of circumstances in your life that he don't have no part of you that he can work through amen amen we're in that junction of time we're in that time of our departure friends we're in that time of the consummation of the gentile ages we're in that time when when when the next junction is going to be christ going to the 144 thousand and so the junction before that is to take a bride and a body change and i believe we are right upon it amen and if and if that's true and i believe it is then there you then then you need to wake up tonight and understand that you that that that it's not like we go from zero to a hundred we go from 99 to a hundred that same power that's going to change your body ought to be operating in your mind and your body and your life in your home right now we're not waiting on a revival the revival of the bride is here the word is open and you have full not partial full access to it amen and here's the beautiful thing it is you're inalienable right the archaic version is unalienable that jefferson used it inalienable unalienable means the same thing it means that that there it's a right that no one you don't have to wait for somebody to give it to you it is your inalienable right and no one can take it from you people can hinder you from exercising it but it doesn't change the fact that it is your inalienable right i have an inalienable right by the holy ghost to live a life above sin i have an inalienable right in the holy ghost to command the devil to leave me and he has to i have an inalienable right to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover i have an inalienable right to go to god and say we need your word and we have a right to expect that's why you you ought to be expecting god to speak to you in these services because he wants to do that he promised he would do that in a junction of time brother branham in speaking of one particular junction of time in january of 1956 quite a while ago this is a principle concerning junctions of time he says when all here's a principle during a junction when all hell turns loose all heaven turns loose also say it again when all hell turns loose because that's what happens in a junction it's it's satan these these biblical junctions at the end time are satan taking a bigger grip a tighter grip on the world taking a bigger bite you know wrapping more in and he's he's just grabbed more and grabbed more at every junction he grabs more until now he's got the whole world he's the god of the age he's completely turned upside down everything that we've ever thought was right and wrong and stood for amen but but you you don't want to be you are you are as the bible said troubled on every side but we're not distressed you know why because when he does that just know that when he does that heaven is also turning loose in other words when he says when all hell turns loose in other words when satan just goes all out understand when you feel like the devil is going all out to destroy you don't be troubled rejoice because heaven is going all out to save you and i'm here to tell you something friends god will never lose that fight if you will take your position in his word and say go ahead satan it's actually good news because i know if you're pulling out all the stops heaven's pulling out all the stops and i'm just gonna reach up into that atmosphere and pull it down around my life and you might surround me with trouble but i'm not distressed he says when the enemy comes in like a flood this is what happens in junctions because a junction is a fight for control amen god's not interested in stopping the trouble god's interested in coming into the trouble and preserving his family to show how great he is how is he ever going to show how great he is if you're never in trouble if you're never under attack how's he going to be your captain you understand if you're never under assault how's he if you're never in a time of confusion then why you know why would you need a banner why would you need god to raise a banner and wave a flag and say over here son here's the word come over here and stand you'll be fine oh i love it in times of trouble i've got direction i know where to go to find my help hallelujah said when he when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god raises a standard against it now you know how brother branham interprets that verse that when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god raises a standard against it he said that's you're the standard that god wants to raise and you raise yourself up in prayer and become the standard god needs god looks down and sees the enemy coming in and he knows the enemy's trying to undo his plan so he looks around and says i need some standards oh there's a church full in bethel tabernacle let me get them over here and put them in the way now say now let's see you get to my plan i got my family in your way and they've raised themselves up in prayer and you know what happens when when you do that you become an invincible army you become a standard that stops him he can't go over you can't go around you can't go under you because you are the living representation of god in the earth this is what the bible is teaching us and brother branham says now so when all hell turns loose all heaven turns loose also when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god raises up a standard against it and these two forces is always showed at the junction these two forces god and the devil good and evil light and darkness satan with his family god with his family the word and the anti-word faith and doubt all of these opposites are there light and darkness good versus evil you get it and these two forces is always showed at the junction so when we talk about how that satan has filled the the whole world with sin and ungodliness by every possible tool every possible venue come on y'all live here with me you know that's true every possible outlet every possible way every natural way electronic way uh in a person-to-person interaction way on the job in the schools in the market in the neighborhood in your home in church trying to come to church i mean friends it's everywhere he he literally has covered the earth in sin and ungodliness you know he's filled the world oh that we live in with fear amen with stress with anxieties untold anxieties untold stress brother ram talks about that in the 1960s which was child's play compared to now how that he said you know you'd think in a nation like america with such excess and and everybody i mean we have everything we're first world country richest nation in the world enjoy the most freedoms we got everything at our fingertips anything you want you can pretty well get and he said you'd think in a world with such an amount of that that we would americans would just be able to sleep at night and be at peace and be happy and be be peaceful and he said but instead he said what are we doing he said we're having to take tranquilizers yes nerve pills he said the psychiatrists don't have the answer they prescribe nerve pills to each other back and forth psychiatrists go to other psychiatrists to get drugs that you know my mom and i were talking about it recently and and she was just making the comment she said you know i don't see how the world survives without this word i said mom the answer is they don't they're not that's why we have a drug epidemic that's why we have such chaos in the streets that's why we have anarchy that's why we have such people are just going crazy because the bottom line is they're not coping even with a drug epidemic even with alcoholism even with every every every way to satisfy the flesh is out there and the more man satisfies himself with the sinful things the more it poisons him the worse he becomes it's a vicious cycle there is no hope for this world i'm glad for christ who's coming to take me out of this world amen so whether it's mental anxieties fears pressures whether it's sensualities of the flesh and the bible talks about the pride of life the the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye things that can entice us things that bother us in our flesh and bother us in our mind and then satan as if he as if he's not low down enough you know like brother donnie he said one time said satan is the guy who will tempt you to rob the bank and while you're robbing it he'll call the cops on you but now i want you to think about something here for a minute because it's all a single enemy yes amen so what i mean by that is that satan is the same enemy in all instances he only changes his tactic depending on what he's trying to accomplish so by that in other words whether he's going to lure you into some pride of life lust of the eye lust of the flesh some sinful transgression and tempt you and get you to stumble in it whether it's that or whether it's a mental oppression or an anxiety or a stress on your mind understand this it's all the exact same devil he's just attacking different parts of you depending on what he's trying to do and so you realize then that that his his it's the same enemy using the same attack doing the same things just in different channels to get a different result and he begins the attack in either way whether it's your flesh or your mind he begins the with the same approach and he begins to attack the attack with a compromise in your mind yes amen against the word amen see a word is a thought expressed and that's why and then and then an action becomes a further expression of that so people when people end up committing a transgression it's because they thought about it that is that's something that you harbored and let fester until it led that's why the bible says that we are to bring every thought subject to the word of god because if you would bring a sinful thought subject to the word of god the holy ghost would kill it immediately and you'd go away you'd go away whistling victory but what we don't do a lot of times is the enemy puts a thought in our mind and a lot of times we're the one that that had the venue that he used to do it and and we're willing participants come on i ain't the only center in here surely amen sometimes we find ourselves willing participants and then we wonder you know why didn't the lord protect me well the lord tried every way in the world to get you to get that thing out of your life the lord warned you that would take you aside the lord warned you against that making that decision i don't know what what decisions we all face sometimes it's a job sometimes it's the wrong kind of friend sometimes it's an education sometimes it's a it's it's choosing what to recreate in it's choosing your entertainment these are choices you don't blame god and don't blame the devil brother branham uh uses he says speaking you know in the third person says you say oh brother branham the devil made me do it he said no he never he said how the devil get to you you're sealed into christ he can't get in there he said you walked out to him is what happened you stepped out and walked out to him and then you left yourself wide open that's what eve did she stepped out from behind the word right so he begins an attack with a compromise in your mind and you know something friends the the bible says the bride hath made herself ready i'm here to tell you you can you can blame god you can blame the devil you can ask god why let it happen but i'm here to tell you you have to be the officer god is looking to you to be the the treasure in an earthen vessel to say uh-uh devil uh-uh my mind ain't your garbage pile my life ain't designed for you i'm not interested in your ways i'm interested in the ways of the word i'm going to digest the word i'm going to feed on the word i'm going to live the word i'm going to make my body a living sacrifice for the word of god amen so you know we have to be the one to rise up and make ourselves ready that that the bride hath made herself ready to him that overcomes not to him who i overcame for him jesus did overcome the sin you couldn't overcome in other words he you couldn't get yourself back no matter how good you lived you'd have still went to hell you still could have never come in god's presence because you're born in sin that's the part you couldn't do so he did it for you he said well i i'm glad i got the holy ghost well fine you got the holiest now let me ask you the continuing question how much victory do you want in your life i'm not talking about have you had an experience and have you been born again i'm talking about the holy ghost feeds on the word of god and if you want to be an overcomer and you've got to decide you've got to either say i'm just happy to be a mediocre half lukewarm christian i'm here to tell you me and you aren't going to be very much friends because i'm not interested in that for my life i want to be fervent i want to be on fire i want to see the power and the authority of god's word moving in my life i'm not in this thing to be mediocre and half cold not in it that's not why he saved me that's not why he's revealed itself to me i want to i want to have all of jesus amen it was his grace alone an election that allowed you to overcome the deception of the age you'd have been fooled just like everybody else don't don't pat yourself on the back with pride that i'm a smart person and i understand that the teachings of the word i understand all the mysteries that's why i couldn't be deceived a lot of times the more you understand the more easy satan can deceive you especially if you if it's nothing but but just a tool of pride and and it becomes arrogance and you become overconfident and think more highly of yourself than as you ought to and those are the kind that take the hardest falls i want to come and say lord nothing in my arms i bring simply to thy cross i cling hallelujah my only worth my only value is in you lord hallelujah can you say that to the lord my only worth lord is in you my only value i my life has no value i have no intrinsic purpose if i'm a living evil as we learned last sunday and the service prior the world and its beauty had no intrinsic value without man to to admire it and human life has no purpose if it lives evilly that's why god was going to destroy it in chapter 6 of genesis so it is his grace alone in election that's how we overcome the deception of the age see but now to overcome in this junction to overcome all of these elements that we're talking about that have happened in this world that we've just spent time talking about and you all agreed they're here to overcome in this evil age i'm here to tell you first of all without the holy ghost it's impossible and without this message you would never get the holy ghost because the the message of the hour is not a man if it was a man-made theory then it would never give you the holy ghost it would just fill you up with with theology and you could do that by going to a seminary see and it because correct teaching isn't isn't isn't how that that you get the holy ghost it's your saying amen to every word it's your complete heart sold out to the word of the hour and then god comes down and looks in that heart and sees you mean business and you're done with the world and you want him you don't you don't want to know about him you want to know him you know it doesn't matter if you can't even read the book do you know the author of the book that is the important all-important element god helps us to overcome the deception but to overcome all the things in this modern world that are contrary to the word and there's a lot of them we have a part to play in that brother branham deals with that and how can i overcome and various other messages that he says overcoming isn't god you know pushing you through a pipe and pulling you out the other side in other words like think of like a mold like you see people with a mold and it's open and they pour hot liquid in there and close the mold and when it cools it solidifies they open the mold and it's in the shape of the mold that's that's the point he's making it's not god taking you and he needs you to look like a pipe you know with perfectly round rounded and this long and this diameter and so he just crammed you and shoves you into this molder and then pulls you out out the other side oh look at this perfect overcomer what a beautiful christian and he said you didn't overcome anything you didn't overcome anything all he did was shove you in and pull you out and brother luther luther getting a kick out of my examples amen but i you know when brother branham starts telling these stories i visualize these things and so i don't want to be that i i want to be that that i looked at the blueprint and that i said okay if i want to be this then i need to make this change in my life okay i need to be this right here so this sorry friend yeah you're gonna have to go you know because you're pulling me away from this so i'm gonna go over here and get a new friend sorry this job is no good for me sir i'm gonna have to change career sorry this educational pursuit isn't going to work for me because it's taking me away from you i'm going to change my major and go into something that doesn't pull me into the world sorry sorry you know a handsome young man or beautiful young woman but you're not a christian and i am and therefore i'm having nothing there's no future for you and i because i'm only going to join myself to the word if you're a young girl you're going to want a word man and if you're a young man you're going to want a word woman trust me you're going to want a word person hallelujah the worst mistake you will ever make in your life is to choose a non-word person to be your companion in life so we have to overcome when you want to overcome the mental anxieties and the fears and the anxieties you got to do it god provides you the way he he not only gives you the blueprint and the instruction manual but if you'll believe it put it on your lips and start speaking it then an anointing will come down from heaven and start anointing that word that you're putting in your heart and you know what'll happen magic suddenly your anxiety will leave and your fears will go and your body will be healed that's exactly how it works but you've got to do it you've got to decide that say i will take the way with the lord's despised view i will choose to believe his word i will choose to confess it i will only let my mind confess what his word says whatever i see in in circumstances or symptoms has nothing to do with his word his word doesn't recognize it his word only recognizes what he accomplished at calvary what the holy ghost is given for and all you have to do is plug in as a believer and and it will begin to flow through you amen brother branham says he says concerning this junctions of time where we have such evil days i'm trying to hurry says today we need divine healing worse than we ever needed it and as the days go on and on and they have and on and on and they have so will it be more needed what divine healing i'm here today something friends we've got things brother branham prophesied about it way back in the early days and said there's coming diseases on the earth that'll make cancer like a toothache amen now here we are in a global pandemic and everybody running in fear and we're being prudent and we're being wise because we got enough common sense to be any christian is prudent any a christian is not a christian is not you know reckless in the sense of you know just throwing god expects you to exercise the wisdom of the holy ghost you understand so you know brother branham's ability to put that bull to sleep when when he's ready to kill him is because brother branham happened into that by accident he didn't go out there to challenge that boy brother branham talks about a sickness and he says he says now he says don't jump up there and try to say satan i rebuke your arabic i repeat arabic he said that's like kicking out a rattlesnake he said you don't kick at him he will bite you he said you know how you what do you do when you come up on a snake turn around walk away don't got a kick at him he can't hurt me he can only hurt me if i kick at him see and and so i mean you know if i if i need to back up and get a rock and bash his brains in but in other words he's no threat to me so i just turn around and walk away and go the other direction and we're we're facing things in this life now listen friends we should not be we do use prudence and wisdom but we're not to operate in fear you're not given the spirit of fear i'm not afraid of cove but i'm not afraid of cancer i'm not afraid of anything say you might get sick tomorrow i might but i'm not afraid of it i'm not afraid that i might and if i do i'm not going to be afraid of it then let me tell you something friend you can't threaten a man who ain't afraid to die a man satan can't threaten me with death for to me to live is christ and to die is gain fine but while i'm here i'm gonna serve the lord and i'm gonna take down the kingdom of the devil every chance i get i'm not here to compromise i'm offering him no quarter no truce no treaty i'm here to blow him up with the word of god at every chance i can he's going to take his shots on you even if you don't never touch him he'll still beat you in the head why don't you pick up the word of god and take a sword and cut that guy down come on friends we're the bride of christ we're at a junction time and god needs warriors and champions who aren't afraid to draw their sword and say it's thus saith the lord bring it as a badge of courage brother branham says apply the token with confidence talks about that policeman you know two-bit cop wouldn't hardly couldn't fight his way out of a wet paper bag not big enough to stop a bicycle much less a 400 horsepower car and he said but but he's got a big old badge almost as big as he is and he got a whistle said well let him walk out there in the street with that badge blow the whistle throw up the hand he said cars hit the brakes why he can't stop him but he's got a badge of authority that's your holy ghost birth it's a badge of authority to show the devil who you are say he knows who i am it's not about your identity who you are it's about who you are in him hallelujah it's that i am the body of the lord jesus christ so brother branham says watch this now we we're going to need it more and more it'll come to pass after a while this is a prophecy it'll come to pass after a while that unless a man is sealed in the holy ghost he says it's hard to tell he's laid itself open to all kinds of things see so the promise is come not nigh any of those who has the seal of god in their forehead see when them tremendous plagues begin to fall he said we're at the junction we're at the crossroads now that's 50 years ago more than well over 50 years ago nearly 70 years ago and here we are friends we're at that junction to where these prophecies are coming to pass this is a time to be fearless now you can't be fearless on your own i'm not talking about bravado and gusto and machismo i'm talking about faith in the word of god it doesn't matter it's not about muscles it's about faith see and so so we realized then that that we're at an age that without the holy ghost because of why he says because he's laid his self open to all kinds of things mankind has opened his mind to such a degree that he's allowed the poisons of satan to so take over the world that the 21st century the late great planet earth in the 21st century is nearing a complete global collapse of humanity amen that's how serious this is a complete we're talking about an extinction event friends that mankind is facing a soon-coming extinction event of his own making because why he's opened himself up he's been doing it since this age and even before this age and that's that it should explain to you the madness that you see today and once you understand what it's all about that should inform your thinking as to how you conduct yourself that should inform your thinking about how you approach the word of god how you approach church how you approach fellowship how you approach prayer your your consideration of partaking of the word of god if you're only coming to this building you know every other week twice a week every other week and you don't have any intake of the word when it comes to monday and tuesday and thursday and friday and saturday of not every other week but every every week every day of every week i'm here to tell you you can't live like that back then you could have not now we're in the final junction he says those who they laugh and make fun of today because you desire to live a full surrendered life to the lord jesus i think that's such a beautiful statement they don't realize that you're tucked away under his everlasting arms that's what the world can't get they can't get you the devil can't get you how is it i torment you and you still wear a smile how is it that i make you sick and you still trust the lord how is it that i call you in affliction and you still are a wonderful christian i can't get you to leave christ i can't get you to deny the word what is wrong with you people find many people who who can't understand why i am so happy and free i've crossed over jordan to canaan's fair land and that's what's the matter with me that's the way brother branham sung it amen so he says they don't understand we're tucked away under these everlasting arms he starts talking about how moses down in egypt he took his stick and he cast it down you remember that and then janice and jamery's come on the scene and every time the miraculous was done satan is always there to counterfeit it and you know i think if any word would almost completely epitomize this day and hour that we live in is the word counterfeit everything is a counterfeit nobody you don't get the real version of anybody everybody's got on a veneer everybody's got on the front everybody you know everybody's out to really get everybody but everybody smiles at everybody and all you've got to do is turn your back and if they can lift themselves up by stepping on you get ready for it get your head crushed because that's the world we live in it is dog-eat-dog i'm glad i'm not part of this world i'm glad friends that i can turn my back on you and know that if an enemy comes up behind me you'll whack him for me hallelujah i'm glad i got the family of god i'm glad that you're not trying to trick me or i'm not trying to trick you i'm glad that if i ask you a question you'll tell me the truth i'm glad that when i'm down you'll lift me up i'm glad if i'm sick you'll pray and you mean it when you pray amen i'm glad to be in the last bastion of where it's won all for one and one for all because that's gone from the world friend every time and i love this now even his counterfeits what a statement even his counterfeits only point to the end time at the junction so all of the counterfeit facade of humanity that you see and all of hollywood pretending like they're happy amen and but they find them hanging their selves in their closets and they find them oding on drugs and they find them divorced and married and divorced five and six and seven times and they find them shooting their brains out you know what all of that glitzy look like i'm happy red carpet smiles when what you don't see is the torment that they have see amen men with men literally literally men who had 50 million dollars and lost every bit of it down to a million dollars and they jumped out of a 50-story window because they said i'm down to just a million dollars and they killed themselves that's history they've done that because the the loss of 49 million is so overwhelming and they don't even think well god goodness i've got gallet a million dollars and people jump out of windows with a million dollars in the bank this is the crazy world that we live in it happens all the time amen he says believers rest in him let the judgment sweep just like in noah's ark let the judgment sweep what difference does that make wouldn't you love how many tonight would like to say brother branham i agree i i my name is jason watkins and i endorse uh this message what message is it believers rest in him uh like noah and the ark let the judgment sweep what difference does it make even death itself has no barriers no pains old death come on death where's thy sting grave where's your victory never scares me to pass a graveyard i can shout and praise god for i know and be alive in him forevermore what does a graveyard matter to me what is a death sentence why do i care and no one can kill me until he's done with me until god is finished with you you are immortal you can't die you can't be killed you can't be stopped hallelujah this is the heritage of being in god's family he said omnipotence has spoke spoke to my heart as it spoke to your heart friends it spoke to my heart the miraculous was done now watch him start talking about the miraculous i'm going to wind down here once a little cowardly sinner maybe maybe like you did he said a drunkard or a cigarette smoker or a runner to dances and carrying on like that say william branham how'd you get out of that omnipotent spoke he said i received it you received it and the miraculous was done amen you changed from death and to life and forsaken your sins what did it omnipotence spoke and the miraculous was done amen you ever run into people who knew you when you were sinner and they say man what in the world happened to you say just just say that omnipotence spoke and the miraculous was done how are you still a christian omnipotence spoke and the miraculous is done i thought you had cancer and was dying yeah but omnipotent smoke i spoke and and and and and the miraculous was done right i thought that you know you were they they said you were depressed and we thought you were going to commit suicide what happened to you the omnipotence spoke the miraculous was done now brother sister what's taking place now we're at the end time we are going into the millennium every hand pointing that way you know when i read that and i thought about brother branham making this statement here in 1956 we're at the end time now i could say to you tonight friends we are really at the end time and we're going into the millennium and i could say every hand is pointing every sign is pointing to it and you you could legitimately say to me well brother jason brother brown was saying that in 1956 see but you know you know so what why should i believe it now well here's something that i would point out to you i just thought about this today at the time in 1956 you know there were still other things that gave mankind hope that it might still go the other way i mean in 1956 america was still under the blessing of god if they had accepted the message you wouldn't have what we have today you understand we have what we have today because they rejected it just like they always did as the lightning was coming from the east to the west every nation rejected it and every time they rejected it judgment was poured out upon them but during this time to you know to today today mankind has descended into complete darkness there's madness on men's minds it's on the streets everywhere all the exits are blocked amen there's no other way but the end of the world in 1956 there was still a chance that's gone that time has passed that ship has sailed it can't be turned around it can't be saved all the exits are blocked there's no way out now friends he says the the old clock is ticking away yes brother charles point of no return the old clock is ticking away about two minutes to midnight but watch what he says omnipotence is speaking see now there's another difference say but omnipotence was speaking in his day right but you know you know what omnipotence is speaking today a mature bride there wasn't even the last day word born bride wasn't even on the scene when he's saying this the last remnants of the of the azusa revivalist and 1956 they were about to cross the line and that would and god would be done with that with that pentecostal movement forever and he would go on uh to open the seven seals and a word-born bride would come on the scene and yet we didn't go in the rapture in the 1960s you know why because she's still an infant we couldn't see that then we see it now and what because he was never coming back to marry a little girl he was coming back to marry a queen so i'm here to tell you something friends what is a common denominator at a junction of time omnipotence speaks what's the difference between this omnipotence and that omnipotence they're the same omnipotence but we're at the last junction there's not another junction there's nothing else that can happen oh he says he says here here's another one angels are appearing amen angels are appearing you know i just i just was reading headlines now you'd think this would be in and you know what what do they call those magazines that you see on on the grocery store where they show you a picture and tell you a lie for your tabloids you know where they show you a picture and tell you a lie you'd think that it'd be something like that you've seen those kind of things for years but no now this is official government released footage this is official government recognized this is headlines where the government is finally now acknowledging look friends no more mystery to it we have unidentified flying objects that we cannot we don't know where they come from but we can what we can tell and i just saw this headline recently one of the clarifying remarks they made is is that what one thing that we can see is that they're made out of off-world material and that was their word said we can see that the material that these aircraft are made of was clearly made off world and we don't understand that because nobody's off world making stuff angels appearing brother branham said the world looks at them they think they're flying saucers in 1960s the government tried to hide it they're not hiding it anymore they can't hide it it's it's 21st century too many people got cell phone cameras there's too much evidence they got high ranking officials and army people and people flying jets flew right up to these things this is recent this is recent listen friends brother branham said those are investigating they're not space men they're investigating angels that's why they can suddenly be there and a supersonic jet wide open trying to stay with them and all of a sudden they're gone and they said we've never seen anything that could i read i read the testimony of one air force colonel was chasing it down in an f22 raptor and they they said what can you tell us what was it he said i don't know but i sure want to fly it he said i don't know what it was but i want to fly it oh and here we are with this secret knowledge the world's got headlines we've had those headlines forever we already had a prophet friends we're at a junction time it's going home time this is the hour that we've arrived at he said what's happening prophets are prophesying and visions are being poured out in this day the gospel is being preached the full original gospel that jesus foreseen that would go over all the world it's here amen when this gospel this original gospel is preached in all the world then the end will come oh hallelujah happy day happy day i'm here to tell you friends forget your sickness throw away your anxiety it's a happy day we're almost out of here the world's crazy brother jason's fearful things i'm not afraid of any of it and and i don't care that it's crazy because i'm not part of the crazy i've got the mind of christ hallelujah i can't even be deceived oh the sick are being raised up the blind see the deaf here the devils are raging boy is that an understatement the devils are raging there's never been a time where devils have reached this level of rage come on friends there's never been a time where devils have reached this level of rage he talks about impersonators these are things that are that show up at a junction impersonators i thought about boy do we have that impersonators of happiness impersonators of joy and it's all a bunch of lies those these people impersonators of happiness end up killing themselves these people are impersonating happiness they they they they've got all kinds of success and they say oh we've climbed the corporate ladder i got i got a bank account with more zeros than i can even tell you about and they're not happy they're not happy they have no peace at night think friends you might only have one zero behind one digit in your bank account but you go to sleep every night and you raise up every morning with his mercy's brand new hallelujah what does it matter what i have or don't have sink or swim i'm a christian i can't lose i'm going to heaven hallelujah omnipotence speaking that is one of the best signs that we're in the last day that we're at the last junction omnipotence is speaking miracles are taking place divine healing is taking place you know we we we've got a situation you know sister karen pruitt i don't know if y'all been monitoring it sister karen wakes up in the middle of the night and she's got the most serious brain bleed brother joe was telling us about it you remember last wednesday what was it he said cover this whole side of her head was nothing but blood from here all the way back and and it's pushing there was so much pressure it was pushing her gray matter to the other side of her skull amen now you you husbands imagine you're standing there in the hospital and here's your wife of all these years and the doctor comes and gives you curtin a and curtain b curtain a is she's probably gonna die don't expect her to live prepare for her death that's the curtain that's my choice yeah prepare for death well what's the outside chance well she might live but she'll be a vegetable wow so she's either for sure gonna die or she's gonna for sure if she lives she'll be a vegetable you know what she didn't die and she's totally normal and she come dancing down her driveway for any of y'all that saw it on facebook their whole church turned out and she didn't walk down the driveway she hopped she went running down that driveway we talked to her sister debbie now on the way here uh brother tim was praying for her for sister debbie's illness and him and sister karen we're in the in their vehicle and here we are in our vehicle and we're holding hands and they're holding hands and he's praying for my wife and sister karen is speaking a woman i shouldn't be hearing her voice this woman should be on the other side i should be attending a funeral this week but i'm not why because that junction of time has produced miracles among us what has happened friends oh we we hear these where there's a number of stories you take brother ron spencer i don't know if y'all been keeping up with it brother ron spencer was supposed to have three months to live and that was over a year ago and today he's got more victory and more determination and is still in his pulpit right now preaching the unsearchable riches of god hallelujah brother mike walls his wife with breast cancer and it looked like a hopeless situation and brother we all started praying and ministers started praying and i got a report back from brother mike today brother jason they've said my wife is cancer-free hallelujah brother nathan bryan and his age mother with cancer and no hope and they said it's it it's also your body it's in your lymph nodes it's when everywhere it's in your lungs your liver your kid it's everywhere all through her body and we started praying and the other day she went back to the doctor they couldn't find it hallelujah friends i'm here to tell you this is not happening we got our own case here with sister brenda and our own sister brennan the doctor said it's in your body and it's here and it's there and you got to take this medicine and then and then she started to take a little medicine and then they said well you got to have the radiation you got to have the chemo but she didn't want to do that sister brenda said i'd just rather trust the lord said brother jason i'm not going to take it they're saying i'm going to die but i'm not going to take it i'm going to believe god and today cancer is gone from her body hallelujah friends god is moving in our midst our own brother charles who the devil tried to take him over a cliff the devil tried to kill him brother charles stood here numerous times in our men's meeting and we pray brother charles feeling like brother charles i hope this is okay this is things he confessed openly to us that he just he what purpose does he have the lord should just take him he's got no more purpose and how many times us brothers we'd put our arms around him and say brother charles if you only knew if you only knew what it does to me to see you come in and sit there and pull on the word of god i can be in a bad mood and get around brother charles and i live in a happy mood and the devil trying to take his life and he got right to the edge but this church started praying and god started moving and we said satan you cannot have him hallelujah and he sits among us tonight friends i'm here to tell you we're at a junction of time say oh well brother jason people my people could still die listen friends we're all going to die unless the rapture comes so what so what you could be healed tonight and die tomorrow that has nothing to do with it the supernatural that i'm talking about took a life like mine and a life like yours and it made a man out of me and it made a christian out of me and you can't undo that i'll never go back to being what i used to be why because omnipotent spoke and the miraculous happened i'm here to tell you friends you cannot convince me that i can't be an overcomer you cannot convince me that this word doesn't have every element to change my mortal body because why i'm at a junction of time and i know whom i have believed and i know what this word is capable of you can't tell me my children will be lost i've claimed them you can't tell me my grandchildren be lost i've claimed them they're mine there's no power on heaven and earth oh friends whatever is your need tonight why don't you stand on your feet with me tonight and say lord in this junction of time i'm here i'm ready to make a claim and whatever it's mental it's emotional it's physical it's financial i don't care what it is the same god is here among

your junction need at this hour this word has every thing in it i need to get me ready you know why it's going to work because i believe it i feed on it i think on it i talk to him i'm in a relationship with the author it's changing me it changes my body it changes my mind i don't care what your situation is friend give it to the word of god pull out your badge a lot of times that's what believers need to do they need to pull out their badge of authority and say hold on i don't have to put up with this i might be surrounded in trouble but i'm not just i'm not in despair you're not about to take me out satan you have no rights on my life amen we were coming to the end of the prayer there brother tim was praying i was driving i was having to pray with my eyes open but hey god knows when your heart's talking and i had my wife's hand and he had his wife's hand and the four of us is calling on the lord and he was just interceding on behalf of sister debbie who he loves and he loves my whole family we call him uncle tim around our house and his son his son calls me uncle jason is my nephew so it's just uh it's just been that kind of a closeness we've had with him over the years he's been a great benefit to matt and that does my heart all so good and that's why i was so happy to have brother joe and brother aaron here and wow i said come on guys i got to come back and do this again and and and you know when he was praying sister debbie he come down to the end of his prayer and i thought okay you know you're kind of anticipating you hear it leading up to it he's going to conclude a prayer lord we ask us in the name of jesus christ and there was that pause and that's what i was expecting to hear but ain't what i heard and he says now i want to talk to the devil and buddy i was saying man i wouldn't want to be the devil right now i mean you talk about somebody who took a beat down he let the devil know who was in charge and who wasn't in charge and he didn't pull no punches in telling the devil where to get off and to take his hands off of god's property he said i satan i happen to know this lady sister debbie and i happen to know her to be a daughter of god and that means i know you are a trespasser and you will take your hands off of god's property right now and then he concludes it lord because it's the way brother branham taught us he said then he says lord i ask that you make it to be so in the name of the lord jesus christ see satan ain't afraid of me but he's afraid of my daddy he's afraid of my papa and he doesn't want me to believe he doesn't want me to recognize who i am a son of god and that i have access to god and that i can pray and the king of the universe hears me oh friends can you take that kind of confidence tonight why don't we raise up our hands all over the building say lord jesus tonight father i raise up my hands in in allegiance to you lord i i know that omnipotence is here omnipotence is speaking the supernatural can take place lord the miraculous can take place we're believing it tonight lord god we're believing that you still heal cancer you still bring those who are almost gone back lord i

but you held on to him and brought him back to us he gets in my truck lord and as i'm pulling out i said now brother charles don't ever again say you don't have a purpose because god could have let
