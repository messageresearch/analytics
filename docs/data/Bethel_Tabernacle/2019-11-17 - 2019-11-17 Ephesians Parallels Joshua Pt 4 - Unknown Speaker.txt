========================================

it's claiming that they sincerely aimed at it and it's claiming that they faithfully performed their duties see so it can't just be a pleasant thought you understand it can't just be brother Brad and said God God's Word comes and into your mind and the whole purpose is for you to say it because when you say it you claim it and you set magical forces to manifest it but brother Branham says when when he puts that in your mind it's still only a thought until you say it see until you say it because when you say it that's the very first manifestation saying it is a manifestation of a thinking you say what you thought you thought it because God put it there and when and when God puts it in my mind that you are justified before the foundation of the world as though you never did I start to say it because as I say it that's the very first manifestation that I believe it and when I say it in that manifestation then you know what happens that manifestation just continues and continues to the next step the next step and I'm here to tell you I start living like that I start believing like that I start conducting myself like that and when the enemy comes in I say not for me I'm a son of God God has completely cleansed my life and that has nothing to do with my life so they stood firm they were faithfully performing their duty and they were sincerely aiming at the glory of God because that's what the Christian life is for you know when when you are aiming when you when you put together in your mind away a certain way to act a certain way to talk makes you look like a super Christian that's I've seen many many people who become very religious but they never really become more spiritual they just get more religious and they talk a very big religious talk and-and-and I mean can sit right in in the ranks of of message believers and and and you realize that that everything they're doing in Christian activity is and everything they're saying in Christian conversation is really glorifying their selves that's just religiosity that's not what Joshua and Caleb were doing Joshua and Caleb are striving to bring him glory you understand that they understood that to accomplish God's Word would bring him glory that's why when the 10 spies said we can't do it there's Giants they said we're more than able we can do it let's go do it because it wasn't that then they wanted oh I gotta have those grapes again I gotta go to now I want that land I want the best choice no it had nothing to do that it was that God had said it and they said we've got to bring him glory let us go about because if we take the land that it's his glory because we have proven his word to be true I want a something friends I'm not a interested one iota in bringing me glory but I wake up every day I want to prove to this world that his word is true that he's real and that he cares about his family and about his word I want to demonstrate that in my actions I want people to hear that I want that to be the message behind my words that when people come around me when they hear my conversation when they're around me and they're they're not born again they can see there's something more than this person that I'm talking to there's something more than this person behind this person that ought to be our striving friends always stumble I know we don't always get it right but I want to go every day as hard as I can to convince the world that this word is true there's no way hear me there's no way that you're going to convince the world of that if you're acting like them and I don't mean just be a better neighbor and have a little bit of a cleaner diet you know language okay you know so so you wear the right outfit pretty close and you don't cuss and drink and all that and that people know that about you but but you know there's Karris Mattox that do that I mean where we're trying to get them to something to say hey I'm not here to give you I'm not here to introduce you to a form of godliness there's there's movements and sects and people and cults that have a greater form of godliness than we do so I'm not here to present a form of godliness I'm here to present a reality of God then that people and and you you can't you can't you can't just do that by simply wearing the right clothes having the right hair and having the right conversation here's why that that won't work by itself they might think you're a nice person and a decent person and yes he or she's pretty moral but that's not gonna that's not really going to get the get get did the goal of converting them because here's the principle you can't forget you can't give out what you don't have you can only I don't care how you dress or what your conversation is or what you look like if you don't have that Shekinah inside you can't give it to somebody simply by showing up in a form of godliness they might appreciate that but that's not going to save their lives you've got to have a surrendered heart that the glory of God I'm talking not I'm not talking about something natural I'm not talking about how you can naturally have a form of godless I'm talking about another being that supernaturally emanate through you to them that they can't even quite put their finger on but they're affected by it they're not just impressed with you they're smitten they're pricked in their hearts they're something they realize that it's it's fine if if you impress people and and if people admire you because of the way you look or dress or go or don't go but we're not here just for that and you're never gonna convert anybody like that you've got to have the living presence of the Living God burning down inside you and then he will operate through you in a supernatural realm that will be way beyond how you think dress talk speak walk however a man you understand friends the Gospels of reality the gospel is not a list of do's and don'ts the gospel is not a legal code the gospel is not a not a a dress code we don't you know I don't I don't dress the right way and talk the right way because it's my obligation I dress and talk that way because it's natural my Christianity comes natural my faith comes natural my enthusiasm comes natural my desire for righteousness comes natural see and this is this is the evidence of the Holy Ghost not a form of godliness that's not an evidence of the Holy Ghost you understand that and and works Christian works brother Branham said a hybrid a mule can outwork a thoroughbred horse any day of the week when the when the horse is done for the day um you can just keep right on going said he and works he can outshine anybody but he's still a hybrid you understand can't reproduce anything see all right so so he they had stood firm they had not wavered Caleb and Joshua had stood firm and this is an important point they stood firm and they stood fearless in a day of of prevailing unbelief a day of of absolute general apostasy I mean we're talking about there was 12 spies 10 of them that's more than 2/3 of them 10 of them are are are denying God's promise but in a day of of prevailing unbelief that's where they stood fearless and that's where we have to stand in a day of prevailing unbelief and we were talking about in the men's meeting on Saturday the men's Bible study you know if we we have such a unique hour that we live in because in the early church every church was a messege church today we're not even 1% of the churches globally but here we are in a world of prevailing unbelief and general apostasy that's an understatement the whole world is in apostasy Ichabod has wrote over all their doors God is not in their churches listen friends that's the say the Lord God is not in those churches I don't care that they read the Bible and sing songs and cry real tears God is not there they're worshipping Lucifer and the end and in the tribulation the only ones who will who will have a chance in the tribulations are those who come to their senses and realize this is the mark of the beast and don't and won't take his mark and they'll die in the tribulation and there will be no doubt many there I don't discredit that I know there'll be a remnant and I know there will be those who are granted eternal life but don't be mistaken today there is no presence of God in any church except where his divine full revealed word is being ministered and believed by people that doesn't mean Bethel Tabernacle that only includes Bethel Tabernacle if we're preaching the full revealed Divine Word and people are believing it and the word is going from ink on paper and living behind him that's what makes us a true church not because we have better theology having better theology only makes us more responsible see makes us more responsible they had stood firm Moses had had had commanded the people and he reminded them and we won't read it today we won't even go there but Deuteronomy 3 you can read it at home where Moses is preaching to the people he says I commanded Joshua at that time you know uh you know when during the time where they overthrew those 2 kings of bhishan and OGG and and he says to Joshua thine eyes have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto these 2 kings so shall the Lord do unto all the kingdoms that you pass so Moses is reminding Joshua listen Joshua you saw what God did here's the point you need to realize God finishes what he starts when God starts something God finishes it and and you know he doesn't he doesn't finish it in a different way then he started it he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday in forever brother Henry green way back in the day gone on to be with the Lord now one of the one of the heroes of faith that I grew up under as a child he used to always say God started his church exactly like he wanted it and now he wants his church exactly like he started it God he listened friends you ought to rejoice because he who begun a good work in you will see it through he is going to complete he didn't save me to lose me he hasn't revealed all of his word to me for me to somehow get lost in this wilderness of unbelief no I'm more secure now than I was yesterday hallelujah every passing day that I believe his word so we find then that that this principle applies to us today because you know Israel lost their prophet yeah they lost their prophet but when they did did that stop him from crossing over see did that stop him from taking Jericho no see so instead of settling the land no but Jason was reading the scripture this morning showing how that Paul come into the church because they were obedient in his presence he says but now I'm also positive that you're more obedient in my absence I'm here to take some friends there were there were people when the Prophet was here present who fished with him and who camped with him and who hunted with him and whom who were neighbours to him and they went to his meetings in winters church and after the Prophet left the scene they became less obedient but there was some who and since the Prophet has been gone the principal is now we're to be even more obedient and I think about myself and about the majority of you here today almost all of you who were not privileged to be in those province meetings and you never saw those things done but today I am more obedient than many of those who walked with him who walked no longer so they didn't need Moses to come back they had Joshua the Holy Ghost to take them over and so we find then that that same evidence and power of the word and the spirit that operated in the life of brother Branham you know something friends you have this guarantee that if we follow closely in observance and dedication and sincerity then I can tell you surely that your life will produce the same things now under Joshua under this third pole you'll be to produce the same things in power and demonstration in your life that a prophet demonstrated said but I'm not a prophet you don't it wasn't it wasn't just brother Brandon being a prophet it was how he was such a Christian he was such a Christian because he was dedicated to God and and and even the Lord told him as a Christian when he showed him the the Mamba and he says in that third pole and he says now you have to be more sincere than you have been in order to do this and we are living in the aged friends uh uh you know and and I guess therein lies the rub that that whole level of sincerity as sincere children of God that to maintain our sincerity in a world that everyday seeks to rob you of just that to try to stay spiritual in a world that everyday seeks to drain you of your spirituality and most of it you can't even not contact most of it is you you have to contact this fallen world just to live just to get by just to exist in business and and in education you're going to constantly contact the tree of knowledge of good and evil you can't avoid it that's the age God put us in and so maintaining our sincerity and maintaining our spiritual strength is so vital and I know that we have human weaknesses but I want you to know this friends that if you if you can keep your sincerity before God and keep and do those things which create spirituality in your life I can give you this assurance your human weakness won't stop you from inheriting the prize God's never going to let your human weakness stop you from inheriting the prize because he's not grading you on the outside he's grading you on the inside he's looking at that heart of sincerity that you're striving daily you're pressing down you're on the move so your weakness you see lays in the laws of nature it's in your following flesh you understand that watch it now it's a law of nature just like the Sun comes up and goes down and the the solar system moves brother ham said with such synchronized accuracy that they can they can predict things just by the Stars many years in advance they know exactly where everything will be they can track it to where it's been and it all makes sense it bits because God made a grand design of it all and these are laws of nature they're why the world functions in spite of man trying to destroy it man's best effort won't destroy God's creation man will only destroy himself and God will let him do it and then God's going to set it all back to work properly but we realize friends that that that our weakness lays in the in the inner an inner in the nature of our flesh see and and that flesh is governed by the laws of nature but the advantage that we have is that the law within me remember Paul says that he says I see that in that you know that there's a law that in me you know in my flesh there's no good thing but he said but I I'm aware there's another law there's one that's working on the inside of me and that law is the word and listen friends do you realize that they if it's the word you believe that because that's the gene of God that's a part of the word that's why you believe the word cuz it's a part of you a man the seed of God the gene of God isn't some thing that God went and created it's a part of God God in the beginning was the word a man and God took a piece of the word a piece of himself and put it in you and so that which is in you is the word and if it's the word then it's prophetic if it's prophetic then it's a prophecy I'm here to tell you I realize that I have laws that govern the nature of my fallen flesh but I have a stronger law on the inside of me that's the law of the word hallelujah and that law you know what what does that prophecy what is the prophecy of the word within me that there's going to be a kingdom and I'm gonna be a part of it and it's my inheritance hallelujah that the dead in Christ shall rise and we which are alive shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye this is the law of the word that operates within me this is the law that governs my life that you say well what about my flesh I mean that's the law within me says prophetically he's going to change my flesh because jesus said flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven I'm so glad for that I'm so glad I don't got to take this sorry stinking pest house I don't know I wouldn't even want to do it and live eternity and live in heaven say well you get to be young I don't care then that just means I got to fight this guy forever I know I want the law on the inside that can rise up and say I'm gonna change this man on the outside and when he changes that man on the outside then the inside and the outside will all be under one law and that's the law of righteousness that's the law of Christ no wonder I love the word so much it is my earnest that I've got a new life coming in a new world coming and a whole new existence so don't worry friends God will all God's God will alter the laws of nature when needed you can see that in the crossing of the Jordan sea you know God God doesn't suspend the established order of nature without a good reason but he will God sets laws in motion here's a law of nature you-you-you can't walk on water I'm sorry that's contrary to the laws of nature but a man did to men did for a little bit a man the Son of God did it and a follower of the Son of God did it until he doubted you see God God when you're operating from that law on the inside you're not subject necessarily to the laws on the outside you find that that that that that he God would you know here here's a law of nature here's here some of the laws Israel dealt with here's some of the problems that they dealt with we're at the Jordan there's no way to Ford it it's running over its banks even if men could do it we're going to lose half our livestock and probably half the women and maybe all the children there's no way to Ford this river we I suppose we could camp here and build rafts and boats that would take a long time who knows we even who even knows then what would be happening the Jordans already overflowing I mean God put them in that position God puts you in these kind of positions God puts you in positions to where the only way you can succeed is if the power of God comes down and helps you and God is wanting you to understand that that you're never going to overcome the laws of nature by your own effort it's going to take God you're gonna have to be dependent on him it's not gonna be your education or your prowess or your or your concrete you're not even going to be able to conquer the land those 10 spies by the laws of nature they were correct you're outnumbered the men over there Giants they have walled cities you've got nothing you don't have catapult a lot of ladders you don't have hardly anything all you got is everything you could carry out of Egypt you're gonna have no way to face the the Giants and the professional armies and Jericho are you kidding how you going to get past the walls they race chariots on they're so dead so God is simply showing them that yes this land of promise is a gift yes it's your inheritance but you're gonna need me hallelujah you're gonna need me at times to come in there's times when I'll face the temptation or you'll face the temptation and you know as well as I know you wouldn't make it but God will come on the scene and help you to get over and it wasn't you you give all glory to him is that I couldn't stand I would have surely collapsed but somebody came on the scene hallelujah he not only would stop the water like he did the Red Sea I mean that's impossible you you you can't you can't get the Red Sea or the Jordan to just open its waters and let you go across you understand it's not like there's somebody down there that you can talk them into it this is water this is uncrossable it son fortable and yet God is literally going to raise up the earth and suspend the water and they're gonna walk across just like they did in the Red Sea and it's not even good you know I heard a preacher years ago talk about you know they sliced right through mud and though the Bible says that it walked home to high ground hallelujah hallelujah listen friends not only not only did he suspend the laws of nature to open the Red Sea he suspended the laws of nature to open the Jordan later on he would suspend time itself when Joshua needed more sunlight he said a man a man said to the Sun stand still said to the moon stay over the valley of a Jalan and it you know what that Sun and Moon never moved say what was the circulation and this was what I don't care what it was all I know is for a whole extra day the Sun never went down until Joshua was finished and the battle was won I'm here to tell you God will suspend nature whenever you need it hallelujah oh my suspended time in fact is one time late after this not only later when he's to spend time later God would actually move time backwards take a sundial and literally move it backward you're going back in time later on God would literally float an iron axe head you can't do that that's against the laws of nature physics don't allow iron to float on water you understand so not only did he not only did he cause an axe head to float he caused all inanimate object to swim an inanimate object a piece of iron that's out in the middle of a river floats to the surface and swims back to the shore and a man reached out and picked it up this wasn't a fantasy this wasn't an illusion oh my goodness friends he he another man says Lord here's what I need you to do I know the laws of nature are that do Falls everywhere indiscriminately but I'm gonna lay a fleece out here and I don't want to do anywhere around it I just want all the dew that would be everywhere else to fall on that fleece and God did it in the next day he wrung it out a bowl full and there was nowhere else and he said okay God don't be angry I'm asking one more time now I'm gonna put the fleece back out there now I won't do everywhere but the fleece Oh hallelujah friends I'm here to tell ya don't worry little children it's the father's pleasure to give you the kingdom he'll suspend nature whatever he needs to if he can suspend that nature he can suspend this nature he can get me overcoming power and victory in my life oh my we won't even start on the supernatural life of Jesus or the Apostles see he he he suspends the the best laid plans of mice and men in history you know you you you read the history books I've and I'm read them for years and when you read about the conquest of the Babylonian Empire historians don't mention God in there nowhere and yet it was God who said I'm given this power and you're gonna use it this is what you're gonna do and there's the power and they use it and that's exactly what they did and he said now it'll work until another beast power rises up and then he'll come and crush you and then he'll be he'll be the one in charge and you know historians write about you know how that the Babylonian Empire ruled and reigned until the Persians arise and when the Persians come they're gonna crush down the Babylonians and they write about those strengths of the Persians and the feats that they how they defeated the Babylonians there's not one mention in there about God doing it and yet 100 percent of it was because God said it there's no record that you know when Alexander rises up and crushes the Persians and the Bible said that nothing could stand in front of him that that the RAM that would rise up would be strong until the goat rose up with a notable horn and when the goat would come him his feet wouldn't even be touching the ground he's coming with such a fury slams into the RAM and the RAM is defeated historians write about Alexander conquering the Persians they they even discuss in my new details the impossible odds that Alexander faces 30 to 50 thousand men never had more than that miles and miles hundreds of miles away from home into the interior of the Persian Empire facing a million man standing army and the Persians are powerless to stop it not farmers professional soldiers who had crushed the Babylonians now can't beat an army of fifth of their size you think that's an accident and historians right Oh Alexander such a great military tactician oh it was was the Bible God had wrote that and Alexander with all of his strength would never be able to withstand the beast that that the Prophet couldn't even describe there was no I've never seen the beast like that you know the first ones like a bear and then there's like a lion there's like a ram there's a leopard and there's a goat and all these different things but now this this animal I can't quite it there's no equivalent he's just very fierce and very angry and he's got teeth like iron and he's very fierce and nurse anything like him and when he comes and he attacks the goat and he stomps the goat there's no with the goat that gets his horn broke he can't survive and that's the Roman Empire and the Bible the Bible tells about it all hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years before it happened historians write it today no mention of prophecy no mention of God it's all about the military prowess of Nebuchadnezzar them in the military prowess of the Persians in the military prowess of Alexander the Great he was the great it was nothing but a drunk and died in it and there's early 30s I'm tasting friends God's prophecy is ruling the world do you realize that's why you are in control don't let the devil make you think he's in control you have the word in you and the word has already prophesied that there would be a bride standing at the last days and she would be undefeatable she would be an invincible army she could not be deceived she's predestinated not to fall hallelujah and they you know they they come down and they here comes here comes the first woe and I mean you know what God does God comes down on the scene and he comes with an angel said he ascended out of the East having the Living Seal having the seal of the Living God and he says to the Angels holding the four winds of war here's world war one wide open I mean you know armies are committed Kings czars you know here here's Kaiser Wilhelm with his plan here's the King of England with his plan the King of England here's the Czar of Russia here's all the Western powers and they got their armies and they got their plans and they got their maneuvers and they got this battle and we want this land and we're gonna conquer this and we're gonna have that and really divide it all up and God this comes up and says stop and everybody just stops and nobody even knows why oh the best laid plans of men the best laid plans of history to try to write history how they wanted I'm here to tell you God is writing history in the future and God has got a bride here today who believed his word and you are you are you're not just a human being who's been converted you're a human being with a divine nature on the inside and that divine nature is controlling history it's controlling your history there's nowhere you go and nothing you encounter that God is not in control of your life we ought to rejoice in that friends not to be such a that the bible says i saw another angel of sin doubt of from the east having the seal of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea it commands them you know hold up stop the fighting stop all the armies stop all the tanks I mean you're talking about armies you're talking about weapons of warfare that that I mean poisonous gas that burns the inside of the lungs of men and you you literally suffocate you can't get oxygen your mouth is wide open you're trying to breathe but your lungs are crisp inside and then and with power weapons of mass destruction you know the the the the allies they build these great forts and they build these trenches deep down into the ground cover with concrete and cover the concrete with earth and and the Germans just invent a 16-inch howitzer called Big Bertha that'll blow you up out of the ground I don't care how far down you are bro you up right in your bunk or blow you up right in your fort it doesn't matter we're talking about armies we're talking about mass destruction we're talking about chemical warfare and kings and kaisers and czars and presidents who are determined to to to say to have their say and the only one has is say is the mighty angel little sins out of these and says stop the whole thing because I got people here who need the seal of the Living God I'm here to tell you something friends don't ever underestimate the grace of God the grace of God has more power than armies it has more power than kaisers it has worked than czars and presidents and kings the grace of God is the all-powerful power God said I would be saved the devil can't stop it God said I'm going in a rapture the world can't block it hallelujah hallelujah friends I got a fallen nature on the outside but I got a stronger nature on the inside I got something in me that causes me to believe the word to the degree that I can't refuse it when God's word comes how many can can cannot relate to that today when I'm confronted by God's Word I just have to raise up my hands and say I surrender all Lord I I believe but help out my unbelief I want to be every bit of your word there's no resistance to the word and a child of God you know why that's true because grace is stronger than you grace is stronger than armies grace is stronger than kings grace is stronger than canons grace is stronger than nuclear bombs grace is stronger than the mark of the beast grace is stronger than false talk document teaching grace is stronger than the fallen nature of my flesh grace is stronger grace is stronger than me grace is stronger than the devil grace is stronger than you oh I just want to say today Lord give me thy amazing grace let your grace overshadow my whole life God was constantly bringing them in the situation after situation that they could not extricate themselves from getting that God does you that way but the Jason was talking about that this morning when trials and tribulations seemed to come wave after wave after wave he said that's not something is wrong that something is right there's something right going on because we're here to overcome we're here to press forward we need to learn friends we need to learn just that we do that it was the Lord just as they had to learn that it was the Lord who delivered them and it is the Lord who delivers us it is the the right hand the mighty arm of Jehovah how many have ever experienced that mighty arm of Jehovah you know you're in a situation you could stand up here in front of this church I guess every one of you could probably come up here and tell a story and say I faced an impossible situation and somehow God was my helper somehow it got turned around I how did it happen I don't even know fully how it happened all I know is I once was this and now I'm this I once had that problem now I don't have that problem here's a situation and it's just gone that's what that was what happened in that little wooden room when they went through there in the third Pole and they came out on the other side and missing limbs were restored and people were delivered and set free and healed and they said people on the in session what happened and they said I don't know I don't know I can't explain it I can't explain to you how that I can come into the presence of an invisible God and yet I can feel him more inside of me then I can feel anything on the outside I can have an effect in my life that's real and tangible and causes me to do things contrary to the fallen nature of my flesh on purpose I serve God on purpose I'm quite intentional I you know you know why because I'm gonna do what I want to do ain't nobody gonna stop me amen now since I know that I'm that way and all humans are that way what you've got to have happen is you've got to have that nature changed on the inside and then you know what you'll say right to the devil I'm gonna be a Christian I don't care what you say I'm gonna be a Christian I don't care what happens I'm gonna serve God say why are you gonna serve God look at all this trouble look at all these trials look at this heartache look at all this hardship why are you gonna serve God you know if he loved he would let that happen say I'm gonna serve God Satan in spite of all of those things I'm gonna prove to you that he's so much greater than you I'm gonna prove to the world that God is true and the devil is a liar oh I'm looking forward to the day friends when when the bride will be able to stand as a redeemed body on the throne that stretches the heavens wide and be able to stand and testify all you people who thought God was wrong guess what you were wrong all you people who thought he was false guess what he was true all you people who thought his word didn't matter well guess what it did by the way I don't matter oh it matters trust me the Word of God matters and the whole world will all of their lies and deceit and all other politics and all other nonsense and all their education and all their defiance and all their their ungodliness they're gonna find out one day that the word mattered a man it's interesting the word created the world they live on and they think it don't matter the word gave them the breath that's in their lungs and they think the word doesn't matter see so they had to learn it that it was Jehovah who would do it you see the land of the land of Canaan how would I describe it the land of Canaan was not it was not ever going to be theirs by conquest it was theirs by inheritance you understand it was already theirs by inheritance God had given it to him had promised Abraham and and and and and you know you get unbelievers rising up say all those poor those poor Canaanites you know those poor people there you know God went in and slaughtered them all out they had the opportunity to leave they knew the word to Abraham they knew the word the way wasn't no secret what the Jews were they're claiming this is our land and we were in captivity for four hundred years but you guys have to leave now because we're here and they wouldn't leave so they know what happened they perished they perished trying to resist the Word of God and why did God you know why would God take the land from them that they had settled because the Bible makes it clear because of their sin they were living in God's land sinfully listen friends whole world is doing that today they're living in God's earth sinfully and God is justified to let them be destroyed God is justified to give it to Israel and even warn Israel if you go in there sinning I'll take it from you too here to tell you something friends it was there's my inheritance but they still had to be sincere they still had to fight there still had to be conquest as brother Jason was teaching this morning that yes we're saved but God is all once you're saved God is pouring his energy into you because you're already perfect but you still have to be perfected see so we find then that there was a prophecy when God opened the Jordan he literally opened the door to the land that he had promised Abraham I'm gonna stop right there for today there's a lot more I could cover but it's a lesson and I want to stop give you some chance to digest what you've heard won't you stand up with me this morning this afternoon probably so yep Amen come brother Anthony bring your your crew I want to sing that song because he lives I can face tomorrow because he lives all fear all fear is gone say do you have any concern or apprehension these these were dropped you say okay somebody drop some glasses I'll leave them right here if you have any apprehension today that your eternal destination is not as secure as you'd like it to be you know what you don't have to leave this building good news you're at the right place you're at the right place to find and make your calling and your election sure amen bow your heads all over the building with me we'll sing just in a minute but bow your heads everywhere lord I didn't planned I'll knowest I didn't plan to stop at this point I see notes ahead of me that I wanted to cover but I felt led just to stop now it's not in my notes and was not in my plan and was not in my mind until just this very moment to offer anyone Lord who has not who cannot say I am free of all fear of my eternal destination I know I'm not sure I don't know for sure I hope I like to believe it I feel like I'm safe but brother Jason that absolute knowing that absolute peace that you talk about I want that in my life but I I can't as I stand here and live and breathe right now and I consider my heart not not my form of godliness but consider my heart when I look inward and I consider my heart and I know my heart and I'm not sure that that absolute perfect peace is there you want to raise your hand up to the Lord right now there's a few hands there's a few more god bless you brothers sisters young people teenagers husbands fathers all eyes closed now that's real honesty before God god bless you for that I'm gonna pray for you and I want you to believe what you've heard today I preach this word for a reason and we preach the word every time for a reason and that is that you'll believe it don't leave here wanting to believe it's true about you leave here today knowing that it's true you're gonna make up your mind right now and all those hands that went up say I am making up mine I heard the word today I heard the challenge the preacher put it out there and I am getting in line I want that in my life Lord and you're gonna say right now Lord Jesus today whatever area of shadow of doubt that was in my heart today I renounce it and I'm trusting in your word and I'm committing myself to you right now how many don't believe it that way let's pray Lord Jesus strangely moved Lord to to make this kind of a challenge in this kind of a call and I offer it now Lord and I hands went up and you saw it Lord it didn't it's not all that much value that I see the hands that went up but you saw them Lord all I do is stand here and acknowledge and thank the people but it's you Lord who sees the heart under that hand Lord you know that young man that young woman that older man older woman married man single man married woman single woman and Lord it was it was all over it was just a complete mixed bag of people that raised their hands I'm praying for them right now I pray Lord Jesus that this word that the urgency of the our Lord will become so real to us not just not just the people that raised their hand but all the people and not just all these people but me included Lord let the urgency of the hour consume our thinking let the urgency of the hour press upon us the need of greater sincere dedication before God to have our hearts because Lord that's what you're looking at I'm I'm grateful I'm so glad that you're not scoring me by the failures and the nature of my flesh I suppose if you would I'd pretty much be finished that's just honest confession Lord I'm sure probably a birth person in here would say Lord if you're gonna judge me by though by the failures from my fallen flesh when I'm just finished I might as well go home but Lord I have the promise in your word that I can give these people that's not what you're counting you're not scoring them that way you're looking at the heart the Holy Ghost was never just to be upon a person you had a desire from the old times of the Old Testament to be in them to live inside them to change their heart of stone into a heart of flesh give them a new nature which is a new creation in Christ Jesus grant that to them today Lord I offer this prayer as sincerely as I know how of course it'll take you I can't give it to him if I could I surely would all I could give them today was the word you gave me and you gave it to me and I've given it to them they have responded they've raised up their hands in sincerity Lord saw I just now give it to you in the lives of the young and older like male and female alike may you do a wonder work father in their lives may the fruit may there be a great harvest of fruit come from this service today and they'll say on that day when brother Jason was preaching the Ephesians parallel Joshua part 4 I wanted my part I wanted to be in that part I realized that what I'm reading in the Old Testament parallels my life and I want to be a partaker of this glorious promise may you grant it Lord I give it to you in Jesus wonderful name let's sing it friends because he lives all together now Healy lift your voices I can face tomorrow [Music] Oh [Music] I know [Music] [Music] [Music] because he lives [Music] because he lives [Music] I know raise up your hands and because we what a privilege never fear me
