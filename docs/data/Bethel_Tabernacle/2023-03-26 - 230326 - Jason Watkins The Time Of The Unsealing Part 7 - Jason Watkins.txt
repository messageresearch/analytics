happy to be here preaching amen wasn't sure it was going to get to pull it off and brother Matt was loaded for bear and he was locked and loaded and ready but I I just felt like I wanted to carry on in my Series today I hope that'd be all right I hope I get through it it's been a strange this Affliction has been a strange bed fellow as it were mine but I'm just trusting the Lord feeling better today I can't push it too hard so I'm going to try and and my church for all you visitors my church knows I'm not good at that but I'm going to try to keep it throttled back just a little bit today so that I don't send this Affliction and the spasming and then that gets pretty uncomfortable amen but I I my I really have a real feeling on my heart today for the word so I want to invite you right to Genesis chapter 28 we're going to have to move rapidly through some of the foundation I've got a number of quotes to read and I don't want to go too long because even if I stay calm going too long

couple of prayer requests that I'll get to right when we let me get them ready here right when we get ready to pray please this is not the time for an update okay amen Matt and Katie welcome back God bless you man happy to have you all back home safe and sound see that big affirmative from Brother Matt praise the Lord amen all right Genesis chapter 28. and verse 10 to 15. just five quick verses and Jacob went out from from Beersheba and toward haran and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the sun was set and he took up the and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillow and lay down in that place to sleep and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of God descending ascending and descending on it and the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the god of Jacob I'm sorry the god of Isaac the land whereon thou liest to thee will I give it and to thy seed and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the West love this Thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the East and to the north and to the South and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed and behold I am with thee and will keep thee in all places whether thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of we had a request I can't get to it here but sister Elizabeth sent in a request for a friend we want to pray over that and then we had an internet request prayers for a family I apologize if you're listening um not set up to get it here I was and I can't don't have the time to get it back but let's bow our heads father we first want to ask you this special favors for the prayer Lord you know right well what they were that were sent in Via our website Lord and I'm praying for this family I remember it somewhat Lord and the need was great and I'm asking for your mercy in that case for our dear sister Elizabeth Lord the request that she has sent in how you've answered so many of her prayers Lord she sends in with confidence that you'll move again for this friend Father I commit it now to you and Lord bless the word today to the hearers Blessed speaker and hearer let your anointing be upon me Lord and let it be upon speaker and hearer may we all come into the unity of the faith of this thought today we commit ourselves into your hands bodily Lord in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated so Ethan I emailed the PowerPoint I imagine you've got it oh you're the man all right amen like having Dependable people praise the Lord and you just uh forgive me if I'm just compelled to move as quickly as I possibly can but I do want to get to everything this will be part seven there'll definitely be a part eight because that's more of a high octane version and I didn't have the the the gears for that today so uh this just came to me almost I I told Brother Matt I said I could almost call this part 6B because it really is still very close to my heart and whenever that happens when things get real close to my heart I know it's the Lord wanting me to come back and re-emphasize it and re-emphasize it and re-emphasize it in fact is it's uh it's been the most I would say the most profound point that I've made in this series and I've read to you uh it's not on this PowerPoint we'll get to that in a moment Ethan am I controlling I will see we'll we'll give it a try okay perfect okay excellent but I don't have this up here because I'm only going to make a few one or two lines out of this lengthy quote where we have been speaking about the desire in our heart to see the things that brother Branham talked about in our in our day that should be fulfilled the power of the spoken word the third pull we put all of these things in kind of pull them together the opening of the word the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost that we've operated in a small way that when we've seen we've seen things in a in a in a limited way but when as the squeeze begins to tighten we'll see them uh in their fullness and where and and what one thing that I've really desired to do and I've labored at quite extensively I hope you uh have have have retained this is one of the big things I want you to retain one of the big ones we're not chasing something we're not chasing something we don't chase those things we don't we're not our our Wednesday night our Thursday night men's prayer meeting we're not in here praying for gifts we're praying for the Dynamics of the Holy Spirit to fall Upon Us amen because we're 60 years in friends that first perfect bright age church under Paul only had about 20 years in their perfection and then they slipped they began to decline and then they slip off into the ages and Christ has to begin interceding for ignorance but at the end time he promised he would restore it all back and now here we are 60 years and I don't want to I don't just want to think oh it's just someday somewhere down the road I'm here to tell you you're down the road and we see that the signs are moving everywhere and I am looking for God to keep his word he has he is and he shall so we're not absent of God's power we've already seen Dynamics we've already seen cancerous tumors disappear multiple times we've already seen great Deliverance take place we're having people come under the power of the Holy Spirit young people getting the getting the token giving their life to the Lord I'm here to tell you something we are not without the the authority of Heaven behind us saved healed to deliver where we will we know that the word of God is a is more than a match for Satan any time anywhere and under any condition amen we challenge him right readily we don't back up we're not looking for a treaty I don't need an armist I hate that dude I want him dead and I want him out of your life and out of your homes and I want him I want his tentacles off of me I told you I'm not very good at staying calm now here's the second big point remember first one we're not chasing something we're humbling ourselves and letting God do what he does so well his way say all right what's the requirement we have emphasized to you and I would have to say that this tops all points I have made now in this seventh part of this series it comes from here that that when brother Branham could not understand how that in Mark 11 Jesus said if you say because brother Brandon said that puts it on me and he said I I just said everything's got to be in the atonement it has to be Christ how can that be me saying it like as if I got to go out here and figure out in my jumbled up head how when what where how to say what to say when to say who to say what do I say and yet and yet the Lord had tormented him I think we we went through that you saw brother Branham exasperated who are you what do you want I'm out here I don't even know our voice is talking to me where's the light I don't see it and it's God training his Prophet for for our training because brother Branham came to realize that when the Holy Spirit gave him the key and said it's not you you know when you when you hey you know when when you go and you're telling people who they are where they're from what's wrong with them you're going into their secret life you're telling them a conversation they had in their doctor's office you're describing their doctor even his glasses even his weight you're even trying to pronounce a medical term he said you can't pronounce and the woman says it for him yeah that's a guy I heard him say that it was the exact word and and and and God just said him to you really think that's you doing that and brother Branham caught it instantly in a moment an epiphany no Lord that's always been you he said do you think that it was in those prophets in the Old Testament you think that was them you think that was them you think that was Elijah deciding what to say or do and he said no Lord it was the Holy Spirit in them crying out then whatsoever you say if if if if everybody say if if your anointed wouldn't be you saying it it would be the Holy Spirit saying it I want that kind of anointing say what do I have to do to get there well I I would just say before I give you the answer can I ask you are you willing to give whatever it takes here's what it takes well I thought if that be that's right if the person through the atonement see it is to be the atonement because it's Christ if the person through the atonement of Christ Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ can live into a sphere with God so close and he can be wrapped so completely in God by the blood of Jesus that it wouldn't be him talking it would be the Holy Spirit speaking these things if he can live if I can live if you can live in the Spheres of God if I can be so wrapped in God if you can be so wrapped in God I'm here to tell you it won't be you speaking it'll be christ-speaking and there's never ever been a devil able to resist Christ speaking we talked to you and we preach the whole sermon on it and I don't want to go into it today for first of all I don't want time but we live I made a statement to you that we live the reality between Acts 2 and 2 Timothy 4 8 and you remember of course that you know second that acts 2 was the was The Upper Room experience but we have taught you that you know now now the church had to go on in growth and Paul had to come in and lay the order of the word and and and you find that you know we we you you're born again by the Holy Spirit that's that's just the beginning of your climb that by the time you come over into second Timothy 4 8 you're going to find that Paul has grown and the church has grown and he's come to tremendous accomplishments and this is where we're coming to friends this has always been the plan that that a church that was the plan in the alpha age that they take a body change they were on their way to it they had every element they needed only they fell away now in the larger sense I get it because it the seed had to go into the ground that's absolutely true it had to go into the ground you know uh it it because Jesus said except this corn of wheat die divideth alone but if it died comes back into many remembered form so that church had to follow the pattern of Christ and but now here we are with the grand privilege you're the that's the greatest age that's ever been you have the grandest privilege that's ever been had by the church that you're going to be the people to actually finish this thing to take a body change to pick up where they began to decline and carry it on to the coming of the Lord and it's going to take the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost and it's going to be a people who's going in the Rapture those people who are already living in a sphere of God already surrendered to God and that is my my entire heart today in this sermon is that we've got to be completely surrendered to God so we you know we identify ourselves with the Acts 2 people and because of that we seem odd to the world I'm happy to be to be odd we like those in the book of Acts are a people that are more than merely convinced and in our in our minds like the clothes in the book of Acts they were more than merely convinced in their minds we are morally more than merely convinced in Our Minds when we heard like them when we heard the word made clear under Divine interpretation it didn't prick our minds it pricked our hearts there's a lot of things that I don't understand about God in my mind but I know he lives in my heart and that's what I wanted all my life since a boy I only wanted to be a servant of the Lord from the youngest age I can remember I said Lord someday let me be a servant to you and and I had my time just like any one of you where I'm walking you know and maybe varying degrees of sanctification without a real trans real New Birth experience and a lot of things I'd be ashamed of today but I'm here to tell you he found me one day he tracked me down he knocked me down and when he picked me up I was a new man we like they follow the command of the word and we repented we took his name in baptism and from there we from there like those people we have continued in the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets that's what they did that's the very first thing that you see that's the very first proof no wonder Prophet could say the evidence said the angel told him the evidence of the Holy Ghost is to say Amen to the word not mental assent but actually your life becomes a living voice see it's not just saying amen means I agree with it I understand it the devil agrees with it but he's not born again he knows the will of God he refuses to do it see but he you the Apostle said you believe in God good for you the devil does too oh guess what the devil does too see so brother Brandon said he's not born again he believes they sail for you just believe you're born again well the devil believes he's certainly not born again he'd be my brother so so we realize it's got to go more from the head into the heart saying amen is saying Lord so be it unto me according to Thy word whatever your word commands me to do amen whatever it tells me to go forward amen whatever I got to separate from amen what is your life my life is an amen if I make a mistake the word says repent I say Amen then the word says get back up and go forward I say Amen [Applause] Hallelujah so we follow that's the very first thing they did after they were baptized the Bible said and they continue daily with the apostles that continued was the evidence of the new birth it was their saying of Amen to all the words they heard like John when he wrote in chapter 1 verses 4 and 5 we found that speaking of Christ in him was life and the life was the light of men I tell you something friends once I found this source of life I never have been able to let go once I found the source of life I've never wanted to let go I can't relate to wanting to go back to the world I can't even get my mind around that I can't believe how long I stayed out there oh my brother Brandon makes a statement also not on the overhead I don't believe I have it um let me did my screen go dark on me if I put this one oh I did praise the Lord God said let there be light now what if he just said it and no light come then we don't know whether it's true or not okay now I I hope you're Gathering something you've got a I've indicated Prophet saying that you could you could be excused if if God made you a promise and didn't keep it you'd almost be ready to say well now I don't even know if it's true because he can't keep his word that's how vital you think God isn't careful to keep his word you think he's going to give the devil one grain of evidence to bring an accusation against Christ see so he said if he if he'd have said it no light come then we don't know whether it's true or not we don't know whether he is all right we don't know whether he is God or not he just said let there be and there wasn't I can't believe how many people give their allegiance to words that are lies and they follow the allegiance to laodicea to the God of this evil age who promises everything and gives nothing promises you all the pleasures of sin but lends you up in a devil's hell destroyed and not just waiting for that hell but many people have had their lives brought to Hell on Earth because they follow the lies as if the liar had the authority and they followed it so he says so when God speaks and we see it then that's light that shines forth the truth of the word now you're looking at a principle you can cross-reference that and apply it to every situation when when God speaks that's number one and you see it come to pass then that is light that shines forth all right that's the truth of the word see so there is light and life all right so when you when you think about it that way I'll just leave it right there so now we know that we have say brother Jason how do you know how can you assure me that what we have today and we call it the message of this hour how do you know that it's an authentic message from God because a cloud appeared over Arizona no no because they took a picture of it in Houston and that's actually in Washington and you have to go in and ask and get an appointment they'll bring it out and show it to you and it has been scientifically proven and it's right there in their Halls yeah I've seen it been right there so is that why you know it's authentic no that's not why I know those things are wonderful I love those kinds of things I because of all because of all the different things that came to pass in the prophet's life miraculously that's wonderful we're rejoice in those things I would expect those things those appeared in lives of prophets it's not uncommon it shouldn't shock you see what should what what is shocking is when people will follow after the world that has none of that operating in it say but then what is it how do you know what do you what do you put on it because I know it's true life because I know I know it's true light because of the life it produces in my soul I have seen too many cases around the world 35 years on six continents and whenever I bring this message this light it changes people from the ground up and they are forever born again in the spirit of God their lives emulate the scripture they their whole desires are changed that's how I know it's the truth because that's the principle when it's light it will produce Life John said that of Jesus in him was life and the life was the light of men so you know you have True light when it brings life it's not so easy so everything let me further say they further say it this way not only what I've seen it do in me but I can say everything that the message was to produce it is doing it has and it is continuing still even in these unprecedented times when it's too impossible there's no way you should be a Survivor but you're gonna stand on the other side as laodicea and when you when the brown the brother Brown says when the when the rewards are handed out and every age stands because every message has got to come forward with his age and when they when the call goes out now Let the Church of laodicea arise there will be a hush go over the people oh this is the layout of sins how did you ever make it it was so dark we thought nobody could survive it and here we are surviving it and I'm not only surviving it I'm thriving in it I'm more of a Believer today hallelujah hallelujah I'm more of a Believer today than I've ever been in my life oh my more more the more that I Surrender the lighter my load Hallelujah with every day every day becoming more deceptive perverted and Evil with sin becoming easier and easier to sin in modern day access to the tree of knowledge pulling more and more God's children closer and closer to their poisonous influences so you excuse me if if I want to stand and be on this pulpit and I want my Ministry team to stand and beat on this pulpit and say repent come back to God don't play around with the world get rid of those Devils get them out of your life you see something in your life get rid of it right quick don't allow that guy any influence into your life you go to school you get contaminated young people don't think you don't don't think those evil spirits don't have your number they've got a Playbook with your name on it they know where your buttons are they know how to get you yo I I say parents how how dare you send children out the door without Gathering them under your arms and pleading the blood of Jesus and say God go with my children into the sinful world today oh my God I remember Sister Debbie put that in practice when the boys were in public school she would never back out of the driveway without prayer we don't do it to this day we don't back out of the driveway without prayer it's an evil world and of course you know you have the challenge and people can say what they want not here to get onto that but you know the challenge is well after hey yeah you're right after 60 years the bride ain't perfect yet well the Rapture ain't happened yet that's my answer he's still working on me this thing ain't over yet and I'm glad because I still got loved ones I want to see in [Applause] the bottom line is that I can see it moving in that direction very distinctly more so than any other thing out there it promises this message promises it doesn't promise you a Bed of Roses far from it Jesus never said it would be easy he only said it would be worth it it promises to turn Hearts back to the original faith of the early church has it done it and reproduce that perfect expression again living yet through imperfect people has he done it is he doing it amen say it's a perfect message running to imperfect people yeah how do you know because I know I'm imperfect and I know I want to be perfect so there's something driving me there's an Artesian well from the inside that Jesus described as Living Waters flowing out of your insides and I want to have a clean stream Hallelujah we have a limited view Enoch had a limited view we where they all had a limited view we can only you know when we look at Enoch there's a lot we don't know the Bible references a whole book of Doctrine from Enoch that we don't have that God didn't allow us to have and preserve they have books of Enoch but they're not uh endorsed by the Holy Spirit at least certainly not never uh under the prophet's Ministry but but you know what what we can do is we can see some Clues we can here's what we can see and I guess here's the real important thing is that we can see by the what we are told in the Bible that he walked with God and God took him I'll take that I'll take that I don't have to know what happens tomorrow I'm not worried about what happens in the world all I know is he not walk with God and God took him how many want to walk with God see one day he was there next day was gone that church of Paul's day was well on its way to that body change likened to his glorious one with each new era where the gospel spread they could see it trending towards something they could see that church could see it moving Paul could see it moving in a Direction it backslid God knew it would as we said the seed had to go into the ground then then something you know it's it's running along and it's even the shadow of the Apostles people are being healed and and the Holy Ghost is falling on the Gentiles and everywhere and there's great signs and wonders and persecution is starting and the these are Everyday People you understand like you they had everyday lives and lived in countries and Nations and had jobs and paid bills understand they were just like you and me they got up every day and fought the devil and went to bed every night and thanked God they're your brothers and sisters of that of that Alpha Church we're the Omega Church we're here to finish it see they laid out the foundation they gave us a road map we know how to go we know what the Holy Ghost is like because we can read it it dissolves the mystery that's what that's what we find that God is he's a dissolver of doubts and then something happened so something so devastating we see after 20 years or so the church began to cool the cry goes out from all the apostles they start beating on pulpits and writing letters and and the word starts calling for correction get back on track you need to earnestly contend for the faith once delivered you're starting to slip you're starting to go sideways James is killed Paul leaves the scene this one goes this one dies this one goes Thomas is is murdered and and it's happening and people are saying my goodness what's going on we thought the Lord would be here tomorrow and God didn't let him know it would be 20 centuries he didn't let them know it would discourage them brother Adam said he he wouldn't tell him that John come back and wrote it in a book locked up in mystery and no one knew what it meant see so we can't know through them you say it this way we can't know through them what the bride just before the catching away will just exactly look like and we got Clues we can see the way here's the biggest here's your biggest helper Hebrews 13 8. I'll promise you whatever happens it'll be the same Jesus Christ that it's ever been and that's how you'll know I don't know what exactly it's going to look like when when the Dynamics of this church are refilling of the Holy Ghost when we've operated things in a small way but when the squeeze comes it'll be in its fullness we read all of these things we don't know I don't know what all that's going to look like I don't know exactly what's going to happen to to the Kremlin I don't know I know eventually they're destroyed in a tribulation I don't know who what when how or where that the Vatican is going to burn under atomic fire but it will I don't know when our Western Seaboard will be lost but it's doomed we don't know will we be here we won't will that be the resurrection morning well not I don't know how's it going to go down I don't know but I do know this it'll be Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] they had Clues we have Clues they knew that your day would be filled with perilous times Paul writes about it in the spirit he knew there would be a there had to be a revealing of the man of sin the church knew that they would have to return they never saw this a lot of this they never saw never saw the man of sin revealed like we have now they had the work of the Antichrist it was already working in the church see but it was it was they were starting to drift under that and it would be a message at the end time that would call us back and smack us around and go pay attention there there there's a fine line between it Christ and Antichrist they say how fine so close it's a Razor's Edge what's the effect it would actually deceive the very elected if that were possible that's how tricky it is no wonder we need to live in the Spheres of God no wonder we need a surrendered life every day I'm here to tell you you've never been this way before you better stay close to the word of God Hallelujah that's what Joshua told the children of Israel you've never been this way stay close to the priesthood they're carrying the ark they're following the pillar of fire Hallelujah oh my they never had to face the days of Lord and Noah as a double barrel threat they never had to face Satan's Eden they were only four thousand years deep in this building they never had to see the time Satan fulfilled his prophecy that he would have sinned and become like God and be the god of the evil age they never had to they never had to work through that like we do they could see it coming Jesus prophesied of it Paul told about it that men would give give that at the end time mankind will lose the ability to deserve between right and wrong it'd be let aside by enticing Spirits you're there you're here that day is this day see you've got the double barrel threat of lot and Noah no age ever had to face that double threat except the last stage but they also knew that at that time there you would receive power from on high because the Bible tells us about it how that there would come a power there would come an anointing there would come a presence at the revelation of Jesus Christ and you have the revelation of Jesus Christ they knew they later they figured out you know that what happened they were able to see what happened in the upper room they they were able to go back in Prophecy and say this is what's happening is what Joel said would happen so you know we don't know how what or how the evolution to a body change would have looked like had they kept going but neither does the devil he's guessing at it he don't even have your level of revelation Hallelujah he has a nervous breakdown every day you've got the peace that passes understanding Hallelujah so he has to figure it out on the Fly he won't succeed he'll be too he's already too late this bread is already called out she's already impregnated she's already growing to Mount Zion Hallelujah 60 years have taught us quite a bit now I can only see it trending towards something again and I say what is it we're writing another book of Acts every chapter describes every chapter can I can I read from you from the book of Acts that we're writing someday they'll read it on the other side we get to read this one here that family over there I'll get to read our book over there and they'll turn to chapter after chapter and after chapter and chapter and verse will show unprecedented and the unprecedented impossibility for anyone to have ever survived it they'll read in every chapter that it'll describe an unparalleled sin condition in the world but then they'll read the next verse and it'll say but the Saints kept pressing on and it was impossible but they would not stop ongoing Hallelujah it looks hopeless when they read it until they read the next verse the Saints pressed on harder it got harder so they pressed harder it got worse so they became more determined it got impossible so they believed for the impossible they would not be denied they would not be pushed off they would not be held back I'm going in a Rapture and there's not enough devils in hell to stop me Hallelujah [Applause] how did you make it read the next chapter okay oh I see you kept coming to the house of God I see you kept raising up holy hands I see that you kept singing no matter how dark it got you kept singing no matter how difficult you kept worshiping no matter what how many lies you stuck to Jesus you stayed close to him the preachers kept preaching families kept praying what happened in the next chapter well it was the next day what did they do they pushed a little harder what about the day after that they pushed some more they pushed to the West like he like he said to Jacob yo he told Abraham after after he separated from lot and then you find in Genesis the first time God says to Abraham now lift up your eyes and the Bible says Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked first time you see it look Northeast West South everything you see I'm giving you now he's confirming it in Jacob where we read in our text and it'll go Westward and it'll go Southward and Eastward and northward and and and and that's what our book of Acts is going to say how did you keep going how did you get it around the world I don't know we just pressed Westward we pressed Eastward we pressed northward we pressed Southward and this revealed word we knew that all the families of the Earth would be blessed in this word [Applause] and with every new chapter of the book of Acts we see it getting closer do you you see it getting closer friends do you feel the atmosphere do you wake every day and say Lord is this the day Hallelujah oh it consumes me night and day that's why I keep coming back to this point again and again and again we're not chasing something we're surrendering our way into something this is God's doing and it is glorious in our sight now I want to take this next turn making ready anybody got a spoken word to make that clock slow down Revelation 19 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready amen so so you find in the book of Acts where Peter's speaking to those men those devout Jews said you know you crucified him with Wicked hands however the Lord knew that you did it under determinate counsel you listened to bad leadership misinterpreted theology preachers steered you wrong you killed the Prince of Life and you know now all of your devotion is you're doomed well what men what can we do oh my goodness we're here I just traveled all the way from Arabia to come into the feast and you're telling me I'm doomed and even if I take my lamp it's no good right what can we do men and Brethren that's the that's the response of a Believer when he realizes he needs God what do I got to do just tell me what I got to do whatever you say I'm gonna do Hallelujah repent see don't despair God like Joseph God did it to save life the great couldn't hold him don't worry calm down breathe breathe the grave couldn't hold him he'd said in David don't work don't worry the word won't fail the word it didn't matter that they killed him it didn't matter that they ripped him and beat him and put him in a tomb and throw him in our dead the word of God would overcome death Hallelujah there's no power that can resist the word of God and on that Resurrection morning that same anointing shook that cold dead body and brought it back to life thrown away a stone stepped out ascended on high said all power is given unto me in heaven and earth Hallelujah go and tell my disciples I'll meet them in Galilee is exactly what he did we find that that that the word has this impossible power to it that nothing can withstand it and Peter said to them David had said he won't leave his soul in hell do you hear that for you today do you realize under the fifth trumpet that the lid was torn from Hell and Hell has come to the surface all right don't be asleep at the switch Bethel Tabernacle your children's lives are on the line hell has come to the surface but he won't leave my soul in Hell neither will he suffer his family to seek corruption Hallelujah and he raised him and then then Peter says it makes an amazing statement you know this same Jesus whom you crucified God hath made him God hath made him he learned obedience by the things he's toughered the child grew in wisdom and understanding the child humbled himself under the teaching of his parents God hath made him built him into his perfect State he learned obedience by the things he suffered now that Melchizedek high priest lives in you now you can make yourself ready you understand that it'll work just as magically for you as it did for him you put the word of God on your lips and speak it in faith that's the same as God speaking Hallelujah the bride hath made herself ready I want to look at a number of examples we'll look first we'll take a look and I just want to read through these here's a short one on the wise virgins of Matthew 25. the Bible brother Branham says the ten virgins and the hundred and forty four thousand 1960 the wise virgin with oil in her lamp what did she do she made ready brother Jason how do I make ready what do I need to do how do I overcome you see it that's how the wise virgins made herself ready she had oil in her lamp she made sure to she didn't just keep coming to church every week she made her calling and her election sure Hallelujah Rahab of Jericho let's see how she makes herself ready just exactly says here Rahab the Harlot James said was justified by works but why her faith see it's it's that's works of righteousness you remember the remember when the unwise Virgin are being judged and they get in but the other one's with works and maybe even more Works don't get in because they're exceeding Works where iniquitous works the righteous had works of righteousness that came from their heart they believed God at whatever level God revealed himself in they weren't predestinated to to be part of the Bride but they are part of the remnant of the woman's seed see all right so now was justified by works but why her faith see faith is a revelation that's a new birth all right watch see it was a holy ghost on rehab it's it's that what happened to Rahab and how she saved her life her home and her family you know what you know how that happened the Holy Ghost anointed her that same Holy Ghost to help you save your life your home and your family is living inside you she need to be delivered from Death that same holy spirit is here can deliver you from death see it's faith just exactly says here all right but hurt by her faith she said I hear that God is with you she's talking to the spies she didn't want to see how Joshua wore his hair or how he wore his clothes she said I understand that God's with you that all was necessary she made ready do you know what she did she heard recognized and acted on the word of God when Israel came and she knew that God had promised to give them her land and she heard about it she recognized these prophets these Messengers she recognized those Messengers under Joshua and they get because they're the ones who gave her the true token see so that it's all representing Christ all in symbology and so she she said I I understand that God's with you friends I hope you don't undervalue the fact that you are able to understand God when you see him I hope you don't take it lightly the whole world is groping in darkness and they have no chance to see it except God opens their eyes and he's opened your eyes oh my Hallelujah he didn't have to open my eyes he could have easily passed me by for the age I was living in was wretched poor and blind but then I heard recognizing your day serpent seed and perfect Faith the bridge and the message of Grace and Lord I Thank thee Hallelujah I'm sorry doc Meredith I just can't hold it back I know you're going to get on me I apologize to my wife oh my I understood that God I understand that God's with you that was all necessary she made ready here's the Queen of Sheba these are people who made ready I'm teaching you how they got ready so I want to make it a Rapture all right this is training this is rapture 101. Queen of Sheba and I want you to notice what that little woman had to go to get to him now she didn't come across the desert in an air-conditioned Cadillac she had to come on camels to to get to Christ is no flower bed of ease I want you to read that line with me to get to Christ is no flower bed of ease it isn't just going up and sign your name to a book and say well I'm a member of this church from now on you don't come that way it costs something that is a surrendered heart to the will of God sometimes listen listen sometimes it'll cost you your friends I hope that every person in here young and old has enough wherewithal in you to say if following this cost me all my friends I'll lose all my friends and follow this if following this cost me my family I'll lose them and follow this because Jesus said on the other side he'll give me fathers and mothers and brothers and brothers and sisters Hallelujah if you want forsake all and follow him you're not even worthy of him God came and died for you God became a man and for you the offended the guilty and died for the offenders oh my it's not a cheap gospel friends I never have allowed it to be a cheap gospel this Pulpit doesn't allow it to be a chief gospel this this word that you hold today costs the blood of Millions Martyrs laid down their lives for it Hallelujah [Music] sometimes it costs you your friends if they it will if they're worldly friends but he that will not forsake even his own and follow after me is not worthy to be called mine it costs something oh my Lord so she made ready Queen of Sheba and with the Journey of camels it taken her at least three months to come from Sheba across that burning desert to find out whether that gift was right or not no wonder she's coming to see Solomon no wonder no wonder no wonder Jesus said she'll raise up at the day of judgment and condemn this generation he told that to his own countrymen said you self-righteous hypocrites on the day of judgment the Queen of Sheba she's not even a Jew the Queen of Sheba will rise and condemn this this wicked generation because she crossed the desert service [Applause] there's nothing like it in all the world it was up things that happened and things I heard and saw were impossible see Rebecca being prepared for Isaac Eliezer goes to get her here's another one making herself ready the end time evangelism so she made ready oh let's see I've got a that's not supposed to be there and when he found out here we go and then when alizar found the character that was right in the woman Rebecca I remember he's sitting there by The Well of life that's where William Brandon was didn't matter if he was preaching in New York Tacoma Shreveport didn't matter if he was preaching in Houston didn't matter where he was at it was in Jeffersonville he was at the well of water The Well of life trying to find a bride for Isaac when he found out and then when Eliezer found the character that was in the woman all that character Rebecca the beautiful bride of Isaac he told her about Isaac and she never questioned one thing she believed the word of the messenger and she made ready to go that now she believed the word of the messenger and made she never questioned she believed the word of the messenger she made ready to go all three of those are a direct result of the character see once and see Abraham I mean Eliezer Eliezer is praying notice in his prayer he's got conditions saying Lord let it be the one that does this and what is my camels but what is he looking for what is his mission not a woman that can water camels he's not just looking for a damsel someone who just come and give me a drink of water that wasn't it he was sent on a mission to find character and his prayer Lord let it be that I find character and this is how I'll know and then I'll tell her and she'll believe it Hallelujah watch and they went and asked the father and he said just ask her the damsels of age ask her let her decision be oh that's the kind of independent listen I don't care who the person is trying to lead you away from Christ Christ is your king Christ I don't care if it might be mama papa husband wife brother sister friend companion business career opportunity money I don't care what it is trying to lead you away from Christ you owe your allegiance to the word of God Hallelujah you're in a better position to pray for that loved one if you are see she said I will go to what to what it sounds ridiculous a man she'd never seen knowing nothing about but yet she was ready because she was predestinated and foreordained to that I have a feeling that when she observed the character of Eliezer she knew something about his master I think we could safely say when I can look at the character of our Eliezer I know quite a bit about his master amen Hallelujah so he says here she was for ordained to that we had some time we're good prostitute at Jesus feet end time evangelism carrying on same sermon he says here I'm just okay here we go don't Advance did you notice this woman washing Jesus's feet she never asked for a blessing she wasn't washing Santa Claus feet she never asked for a blessing she just looked there and there that hypocrite trying to make fun of him the greatest character that's what they were always trying to do make him look little some people you know they followed him just to do that but some poor little degraded prostitute with a few nickels that she had earned out there in her ill Fame of living she seen him sitting there and the big tears rolled down her cheeks and she went down there and got an alabaster box with all the money she had and brother Brandon tells it another story when she went into the store she knew she said oh he'll know where I got this money he'll know he's a prophet of God but she didn't care she had that she had to do something and she gave she said here's all my money I want your best she said I don't want your second best she said she didn't want second best for Jesus she wanted the best she gave all of her money he said Jesus doesn't deserve second best he deserves first in our lives where is he today in your life ask yourself that question is he first be honest you don't have a chance if you won't be honest if you just said in your theology you don't have a chance but if you'll be honest today and say Lord God I I know you need to be first and I haven't actually made you first you've kind of been second third or tenth or 11th but today today I'm turning around I'm turning northward today I'm going to make you first Hallelujah she gave all the money that she had she slipped in some way and got back there she fell down at his feet I'll make it some way I'll make it some way ain't nobody gonna keep me out she got in back there some way she way got back there and she fell down at his feet and she began to cry her hair falling down oh my brother Brandon said if some of you Pentecostal women would try to do this you'd have to stand on your head to do it because your hair is all whacked off in in complete Disobedience to God's word and she would cry and take her hair they had no towels to wash his feet and she had taken this hair and wiping his feet off what beautiful water for his feet tears of a repentant Sinner and if he'd just have moved his foot she'd have jumped she wasn't asking nothing she just seen it needed to be done why are you preaching today brother Jason why is your heart so heavy because I see it needs to be done he's worthy of your tears he's worthy of your light he's worthy of Your Allegiance brother Branham goes on I know I'm burning time but you still with me I'll suffer a lot more for this than you are right now so just carry on the ranch girl brother Brown said she's a perfect type of the Bride the fact is the sermon that he takes is the sudden secret going away the church and he's talking about the Rapture and he says this this Ranch girl is a type of the Rapture bride right so if you want to know we were saying earlier we don't know exactly what it'll look like here's some really good Clues all right you're going to hear a story and and the Holy Spirit is going to draw the inference and draw the meaning out to you I'll tell you I'll share with you what it drew to me you let it draw to you so the story is of course the you know the great Ranch there and and the great Rancher with all of his money and he's got a son and the son is looking for a wife but it's a secret he's going to come to the ranch and they're the sun's coming so all the girls in everywhere for miles are going to Vamp him and and they're gonna they're gonna doll up and pretty up and you know like like they're gonna have a Hollywood red carpet but they didn't know he was sick of those kind of girls they didn't know that a Son of God don't want that kind of girl they didn't re that they didn't realize that a real Son of God wants character he don't want her half dressed out in public he don't want her mingling around with the world there's no chance for you sister if you want to have a son of God and you better want a Son of God he's the only one who'll take care of you he's the only one who'll be honest and true and work to support you and help you in your life and be a companion to you see don't don't try to Allure a Son of God with beauty he's he avoids that stuff he's looking for character so he comes on a secret mission all right Story begins so he looked around they had a big party you know big shindig that's a southern term y'all know what that is so he looked around after a while he was so discouraged all he's seen was a bunch of Hollywood movie stars he wasn't looking for that he's looking for a wife he was tired of the world he was so discouraged he walked out the door as he looked around after a while he's out in the darkness he was so discouraged he walked out the door and going back Walking In The Moonlight towards the bunk house he heard somebody kind of humming and looked around and here went this little girl with a great big pan of dishwater way in the night barefooted to throw the dishwater out and as soon as he saw her something another said that's her that's the one see this was an orphaned cousin who her parents had died and so the uncle took her in and it's perfectly Cinderella all this evil stepsisters treat her terrible but this is a true story it's a true story and and uh uh uh of the armor uh meat packing uh the the ownership in his son and literally it became a true story I think God ordained it so we could read it today and have a prophet say this is a type of a raptured bride so they the the the cousin she's a little cousin she's got the same last name but they're they're making her do all the work see watch he saw her something said that's her that's the one so he I like that he put himself in the way he ain't getting past me I've been looking for you my whole life oh my goodness I cornered sister Debbie she had nowhere to turn so he put himself in the way and when she that's when she come back along the Corral Fence why he was standing there she almost fainted remember that honey foreign he said how do you do what's your name and she told him her name and it was the same name as the boss of the ranch said I can't understand how is that this is that your father said no I'm just a cousin you see my father and he were brothers I I got that same name but that's the boss make sure I stay up with me watch What analogy here's here's an analogy brother Brandon makes you might have the name of a church might have the name of Branham Tabernacle you might have the name Bethel Tabernacle Methodist or whatever Church you go that isn't it friends see it's something different it's your character that's what God is looking at the Branham I didn't put it up on purpose because it was just too much I was trying to weed down them already in overtime brother Brian I'm in the prisoner in 1963 he just makes these points I just want to make he says God he's referring to Paul who said I'm a prisoner and brother Branham says God make us prisoners like that how do you say how do I how can I be a prisoner like Paul God make us prisoners from our own selfish ambition there's never been an age with more opportunity for ambition he says if you're a prisoner to the word no denomination can sway you from it it's the word you're a prisoner to it that's all you must act the way it acts Paul was a prisoner says was he a prisoner is a prisoner to Jesus Christ harness to his word by the spirit he was bound he was bound by a chain that's that's a prisoner but but here it is by Fetters of love the chain is fatters of love that's the beauty of it I am a prisoner to My Darling by Setters of love it's nothing to do with with a law or a piece of paper or a vow I made it's Fetters of love I can't not love I I'm I'm a prisoner to it the longer it goes like a snowball rolling finally it got so big going down the hill I couldn't stop and I married her see it's Fetters of love he was bound to do the will of God and only that he was a prisoner oh tonight if if we and I'm gonna say it like this as brown as Bethel Tabernacle could only become prisoners to our own selfish being do I have enough honest people in here that Christ could see a show of hands and say if all tonight today if I could only become a prisoner to my own selfish being to our own ambition that we could completely say how far how much do I got to surrender till you could completely surrender ourselves and be yoke to him no matter what the rest of the world thinks what the rest of the world does we're Yokes with headers of love as prisoners say Amen to that you see friends God has planted a seed in you and you know God planted a city he even called The Gospel a seed and the you know I I want to say this to you that when the flower blooms it's so much more than the seed when it was planted you don't realize what beauty is within you don't realize what you have the ability to ascend to under this under this dynamics that are the Holy Ghost falling on the church you have the ability to be more than you've ever dreamed possible what fulfillment do you imagine does the does the word seed for this day when it's planted into your bosom what what do you imagine it could be when we read the scripture in Isaiah that the people of the last day who know their God will do great exploits what do you imagine that'll be think about all that the my The Messengers displayed I mean just a just a a we just start brother badam often starts right at Luther because that was look at what it accomplished my goodness you're talking about a Luther blew a hole and he breached a wall that had the entire world surrounded and steeped in darkness and Catholicism and Luther blew a hole right through it put C4 on it amen put Christ 4 on it and blow it up amen amen Fourth Man in the fire amen thank you Lord fix that quick amen my Wesley he starts off an age of missionary work literally shattered all the Norms of all that ever been done before or since in missionary work the Azusa Revival of power coming among you know and expressing through through the poorest and the most illiterate uh type of people but it brought faith in their lives and and and they and they they met in squalor they didn't meet in nice churches like this they met beside a railroad tracks and brush armor meetings and they were beaten and jailed right here in the United States amen and they became the outcast of the church yet it swept the world you couldn't stop it so what do you think this word is going to do in the hour I tell you it's going to push East it's going to push West it's going to push north and south and it's going to take a global Pride off the Earth Hallelujah a people called out of a church to become the bride his little house servant was chosen by the son to be his bride among all those High Society sisters where'd she get her wedding garments brother Branham says that she saved her money all year she only made a dollar and 75 cent a week now I'm probably in today's dollars that's I guess a low week's pay but she saved her money all years all year you know I thought about when he said that I thought about the coins that that woman the coin she lost out of her crown there and Jesus tells the story and she swept and searched carefully all over her house she wouldn't stop searching till she found it because it represented her virtue and she couldn't be seen without that coin it was a drachma it's like a a whole day's in worth it was only a day's wage but to her it was everything and she carefully Jesus said carefully she went through she had to find that lost coin the world didn't think of it as very valuable but to her it was valuable do you know what the you know what the parable I mean the the parable before was the lost sheep and Jesus leaving the 90 and nine and going after one don't think you're not valuable Hallelujah he's got 99 but he wants you Hallelujah the very following Parable is The Prodigal Son you gotta lost sheep you got a coin of value you got a lost sign here I think I could convince you today that God is determined to have you he loves you you Hallelujah he's got a plan for you oh my other than saving your money I don't know where a little cousin came up with at all I know where I got mine I got it at the foot of Calvary one day how did I get mine for this day in this hour this wicked day this impossible day I heard I recognized and I acted upon the word of God oh my making his word what did you do brother Jason I made his word the most valuable thing in my life what more manifestation lays in the seed yet friends what do you think lays just ahead of us what other manifestation is in the seed that's yet to come out and say I don't know but I do know there is more to come out how because

favorite version I read you from several different versions where he tells the story a couple different times and he comes to the Sixth Seal and he's going to to tell you about it and I just want it's probably not even five minutes long I just want you to hear it in the prophet's own words and then we'll have brother Andrew and brother Anthony play for us and sing amen all right just listen now we're gonna go back to yesteryear a carry-on for this boy when he he come out and each one of them assure this go to get this boy there's a little cousin there on the ranch and she was an orphan and so she just done all the the work for these because they had to have the fingernails fixed you know and they couldn't wash the dishes for the hands and things that she'd done all the real hard work and then finally when the boy came they went out and got into the old western style the buck board they come in shooting their guns and carrying on and on and acting up and that night they had a great big dance out there on a on an old-fashioned dance and all the ranchers around about and coming in with her dancing and so forth and first thing you know why this went off it was Jubilee for two or three days then one night this boy stepped out to other place just to rest a while from the dance and got away from these girls and yeah look going down towards the crowd then I want a little girl kind of ragged looking and shed a dish pan full of water she washed the dishes and you thought I never seen her before I wonder where she come from so he just puts in his way to go around the side of the the bunk house go down there come back side of the crowd and met her she's barefooted she stopped she held her head down she'd seen who it was and she was very shine she knew this great person and she was just a cousin to these other girls her father was forming on this big armor outfit so they kept a she kept looking down she's ashamed of being barefooted he said what's your name she told him said why ain't you out there to the where the rest of them is she kind of made excuses and so the next night he watched far again finally is sitting out there they all got to carrying on everything he he said on the crowd fence and watched her come through the dishwater out and he watched her and he said to her he said you know my real purpose of being here she said no sir I don't said my purpose of being yours hunting a wine he said I find a character you that they don't have oh God I think of the church is that will you marry me oh my she said me me I mean I can't think of such a thing but me or see that's the main boss's son he owned all the companies and races throughout the country and everything see said he said yes and I I couldn't find one in Chicago I I want a real wife I want a wife with character and the thing that I'm looking for I see it in you so will you marry me she said well it startled her and she said yes and he said well totally be back today you just make yourself

arrived certain hour he has to be there so she dressed in her garment and she hadn't even heard from him but she know he'd be there so she dressed up in her wedding clothes got things ready well then
