[3:39] IW Lord have your way in
[3:47] me sounds like a
[3:50] prayer amen had a good Sunday school
[3:53] lesson always thinking always looking
[3:56] towards the Lord looking under Jesus the
[3:58] author and finisher of of our faith
[4:00] every moment of every
[4:02] day amen I really enjoy that I just
[4:07] there's times you get away from it but
[4:09] there's times he knows your thoughts and
[4:12] what you're thinking brother brandom
[4:15] used to talk about his wife and she'd be
[4:17] ironing clothes and she'd be praying as
[4:20] she was doing that amen we want
[4:23] to the holy spirit's going to make you
[4:25] do something amen so the main thing is
[4:28] get the Holy Spirit cuz he's the only
[4:30] one that can please
[4:32] God Amen I have a couple of requests of
[4:36] prayer I had a a man that I worked with
[4:39] at Buford County over a year ago uh his
[4:43] name was Bruce he came to um the wedding
[4:46] and everything his wife went in for a
[4:48] surgery on a she had a growth on her
[4:50] back and he just wanted us to pray for
[4:52] her her name is Patty so that um it
[4:55] would be benign and there was nothing
[4:58] and then he text me to a l later he has
[5:00] a friend of his in Wisconsin that was
[5:01] actually going through the exact same
[5:03] thing so we want to remember them to
[5:05] this morning the man in Wisconson his
[5:07] name is Keith Bruce Noak his wife's name
[5:12] is
[5:13] Patty um just a little update on my
[5:17] son so he texts me this morning and just
[5:20] says that um the way he put I raised my
[5:24] hand about some issues at
[5:26] work and they let me go
[5:30] that's what all this that I got there's
[5:32] so much more that goes behind the scenes
[5:34] and you know in his eyes he told me the
[5:37] truth because that's that's just the way
[5:40] that he sees it um you know we just want
[5:44] to pray for him you know as a dad you
[5:47] just I just want so much to help him but
[5:52] the thing is he just doesn't want to
[5:53] help
[5:54] himself and it's a
[5:57] decision I mean you know when I came to
[6:01] the Lord I just made a decision and I
[6:05] was not in a message church I was raised
[6:07] a Catholic was out in the world in the
[6:10] Marine Corps
[6:13] um and I went to a church four weeks in
[6:16] a row and I made a
[6:19] decision and I really didn't know what I
[6:22] was doing and you said well what are you
[6:24] talking
[6:24] about but that
[6:27] decision brought me to where I I
[6:30] am I think I drank one more time didn't
[6:34] get drunk because it wasn't having
[6:37] effect but I just knew at that moment it
[6:40] was called the Eagle's Nest it was a
[6:42] charismatic
[6:44] church and all he did was ask
[6:47] you if you want to we had our heads
[6:49] bowed if you want to give your heart to
[6:51] the Lord but I it was like the Lord was
[6:54] sitting at ceiling height to
[6:56] me and uh I raised my hand of course
[7:00] then everybody sitting up says you that
[7:01] raised your hand come up front I know
[7:04] who I raised my hand to I was the first
[7:06] one with up front not to but I knew what
[7:09] I had
[7:10] done and he honored that to the point to
[7:14] where I grew up like a calf in a stall
[7:16] for the first two or three years and
[7:18] then after
[7:20] that troubles came but the decision if
[7:25] it's a true and honest sincere decision
[7:27] in the
[7:28] heart God will honor it and you won't
[7:31] know what's going on while you're
[7:33] serving God all your life and everything
[7:35] it's because he honored it and he he's
[7:38] the one that sought you out I'm sorry
[7:40] I'm getting worried but praise the Lord
[7:42] we're here to collect the tithes and
[7:43] offerings if you have a request upon
[7:45] your heart this morning you know he sees
[7:49] that he sees that we are so captivated
[7:53] in this carnal body but he sees that
[7:57] where two or three are gathered do you
[7:59] do you see him in his Corporal body no
[8:02] but he's
[8:03] here let's pray father I love you this
[8:08] morning we come to you father as
[8:11] thirsting in our hearts because you put
[8:13] something in there to thirst after you
[8:17] and we just pray that you would meet
[8:18] that thirst in each and every heart this
[8:21] morning Lord we remember Patty Noak and
[8:24] my friend's friend Keith that had
[8:26] growths
[8:28] removed Lord Lord in the name of Jesus
[8:30] Christ we pray that they would both be
[8:33] benign Lord for my son and the request
[8:36] upon the hearts here I've committed him
[8:39] to you father I won't take him back he's
[8:42] in your hands and that's where I stand
[8:44] by faith father I love him with all my
[8:48] heart and I just pray that you would

[25:08] God bless you
[25:10] Amen brother Jason had requested this
[25:13] song a couple weeks ago and I had
[25:16] listened to it and promptly forgot about
[25:19] it until I was praying before bed last
[25:21] night and came to my mind oh Lord help
[25:24] me
[25:25] so might be a little a little
[25:49] rough from a distance he' been watching
[25:54] me and I guess somehow he
[26:00] knew that in my heart I long to be like
[26:10] he in time the closer we
[26:15] became the more it seemed I
[26:20] grew I'd
[26:22] fall he'd pick me up and I'd try again
[26:31] again he loves me even when I do the
[26:37] things I should
[26:40] [Music]
[26:41] do and when I fall to do the things I
[26:48] [Music]
[26:52] should I heard it say that love is blind
[26:58] and I've come to know it's
[27:02] true he forgets the bad and remembers
[27:07] all the
[27:09] [Music]
[27:12] good in my
[27:15] father's
[27:18] eyes there's no wrong I've
[27:22] Done In My
[27:25] Father's Eyes
[27:29] I am the perfect
[27:33] son he must see what I can see and it
[27:40] makes me want to
[27:43] try to be like the son that's in my
[27:49] father's
[27:52] [Music]
[27:54] eyes and when this life is
[27:59] over my last trial I've gone
[28:04] through will be worth it all to hear him
[28:09] say Well
[28:12] [Music]
[28:15] done maybe then
[28:18] I'll understand just what he sees in
[28:24] me but I'm sure I'll find
[28:28] he was blinded
[28:30] by a
[28:34] son in My
[28:37] Father's
[28:39] Eyes oh there's no wrong of
[28:44] done in My
[28:47] Father's
[28:49] Eyes I am the perfect
[28:53] [Music]

[29:01] makes me want to
[29:04] try to be like the sun that's in My
[29:10] Father's
[29:15] Eyes must see someone I can't see and it
[29:21] makes me want to
[29:24] try to be like the sun
[29:28] that's in My Father's
[29:32] [Music]

[36:30] Lord I wasn't going to send a hit squad
[36:33] I knew you'd get to it
[36:35] eventually amen you love the
[36:39] Lord I want to make just a quick
[36:42] announcement that uh next Sunday brother
[36:45] George Smith will be with us so looking
[36:48] forward to that haven't had brother
[36:49] George through in a long time amen I
[36:53] honestly not sure it was me I think it
[36:55] was the draw to come see my mom and
[36:57] greet her that's probably what did it
[36:59] but amen he's gonna come through talk to
[37:02] him he was in Arizona the other day and
[37:04] so we got it planned out for next
[37:06] weekend I'm looking forward to that amen
[37:10] praise the
[37:13] Lord weeks ago we had brother Joe last
[37:17] weekend the week prior we were preached
[37:18] on to start a fire we're preaching part
[37:20] two of that today to start a fire part
[37:23] two we're going to read this opening
[37:24] text we'll let you be seated and then we
[37:27] have another followup text Luke
[37:31] 12: 49 through
[37:36] 53 amen amen all
[37:39] right I am come to send fire on the
[37:44] earth and what will I if it be already
[37:48] kindled but I have a baptism to be
[37:51] baptized with and how am I straightened
[37:54] till it be accomplished suppose ye that
[37:57] I am come to give peace on Earth I tell
[38:00] you nay but rather division for from
[38:03] henceforth there shall be five in one
[38:05] house divided three against two and two
[38:08] against three the father shall be
[38:11] divided against the Son and the son
[38:12] against the father the mother against
[38:15] the daughter-in-law and the daughter
[38:17] against the
[38:18] mother and the Mother-in-law against her
[38:21] daughter-in-law and the daughter-in-law
[38:23] against her mother-in-law I think I read
[38:25] that correctly
[38:27] amen let's
[38:29] pray Lord when we read your words in
[38:34] this
[38:35] passage it can feel at times Lord
[38:38] uncomfortable to us to read it because
[38:41] it's not how we like to think of the
[38:44] Gospel but Lord we can't deny that this
[38:46] is what you said and so what you said is
[38:49] not in question it's in your Bible Lord
[38:52] but we want to understand it so I pray
[38:55] for your help today today that we can
[38:58] understand now you made a promise Lord
[39:00] that when he the Holy Ghost come that he
[39:03] would lead us and guide us and so father
[39:06] we are relying upon that promise today
[39:09] and I pray you'll be my helper Lord as
[39:11] we try to go through this material in a
[39:15] studious way I don't want to skip any o
[39:18] over any of it I hope to get to all of
[39:21] it but Lord I just I'll need your help
[39:23] for that so we commit it to you in Jesus
[39:26] name amen God bless you friends you can
[39:29] be
[39:31] seated we're going to invite you now to
[39:34] Acts chapter
[39:37] 2 we'll just take a reading a very
[39:41] familiar reading to us in Acts chapter
[39:46] 2 and we'll begin at verse
[39:53] one and when the day of Pentecost was
[39:56] fully come they were all filled with one
[40:00] Accord in one place and suddenly there
[40:05] came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing
[40:08] Mighty Wind I don't think this was a
[40:12] figment of Luke's imagination amen I
[40:16] think they actually heard
[40:18] something it was sounded like a rushing
[40:21] Mighty
[40:22] Wind and it filled all the house where
[40:25] they were sitting
[40:28] now a storm could rage
[40:31] outside and a tornado could touch down
[40:34] near you and people say it sounds like a
[40:38] locomotive so there could come a a a
[40:42] rushing Mighty Wind that could sound
[40:45] quite ominous and actually the wind of
[40:48] it fill all the house where you're
[40:50] sitting amen amen but that's not likely
[40:54] to bring this next verse to pass
[40:57] catch it and there appeared unto them
[41:00] cloven tongues like as of fire and it
[41:04] sat upon each of theml now I read to you
[41:07] a very ominous reading from Luke 40 uh
[41:11] Luke
[41:12] 12 about a fire coming into the Earth
[41:16] and um I hope today to be able to
[41:20] connect that fire to this fire amen amen
[41:25] all right
[41:27] and there appeared unto them clothing
[41:29] tongues like as of fire and it sat upon
[41:31] each of them and here's the result and
[41:35] they were all filled with the Holy Ghost
[41:39] and began to speak with other tongues if
[41:42] a tornado fills your house full of wind
[41:45] you might wish you had the Holy
[41:47] Ghost you probably really call on the
[41:50] Lord and call on the holy ghost at that
[41:53] moment but these people were filled with
[41:55] it
[41:57] amen and began to speak with other
[42:01] tongues as the spirit gave them
[42:03] utterance amen now watch
[42:07] this this goes to show you
[42:10] that you getting the Holy Ghost is not a
[42:14] selfish thing to hoard but it's actually
[42:17] comes with the purpose to make you an an
[42:20] ambassador amen you understand that so
[42:25] so there's a great ripple effect or
[42:29] collateral effect of you getting the
[42:33] Holy Ghost I will promise you as a man
[42:36] who raised children and have now feel
[42:39] like I half raised my grandkids to my
[42:41] that was just my doing amen um it's not
[42:44] their parents needed it but I I bued in
[42:47] a lot of times but I enjoyed it I don't
[42:49] regret it no apologies no apologies Matt
[42:51] no apologies
[42:53] sorry amen don't apologize for that one
[42:56] second not going to apologize to
[42:57] Jonathan not going to apologize for that
[42:59] at all amen whenever they didn't do the
[43:02] right job I'll let them know the and if
[43:04] I didn't sister Debbie
[43:07] did so I spent half my time raising them
[43:10] calming her
[43:15] down
[43:16] amen but I promise you that the Holy
[43:21] Ghost in you is what you're going to
[43:24] need if you want to it to have a
[43:27] collateral effect on your children now
[43:30] maybe you don't want that but I hope you
[43:32] do amen a lot of times people don't want
[43:35] the Holy Ghost in their home because it
[43:37] disrupts things Jesus said that see the
[43:41] reason it the reason it starts a
[43:44] fire what we might call destruction is
[43:48] because people resist the truth so as I
[43:52] said to you last time it's not on God
[43:54] it's on you if you're resisting the Holy
[43:57] Ghost and the fire of God comes in and
[44:00] burns up you know uh burns up you know
[44:03] you built as as the Bible says you built
[44:06] on a lot of wood hay and stubble and the
[44:09] Holy Ghost comes in and burns it all up
[44:11] and you got nothing left well you should
[44:14] still thank God because that's what
[44:16] needed to happen the idea of the Fire
[44:20] and Fire is not fun the idea of the fire
[44:24] is to purge yeah Amen to
[44:27] cleanse Amen to
[44:30] transform the fire of the Holy Ghost is
[44:33] a transformative fire that when it comes
[44:36] down inside you will change
[44:40] everything am it will change
[44:43] everything now watch this verse five
[44:47] there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews
[44:48] devout men out of every nation under
[44:50] heaven now when this was noised abroad
[44:53] the multitude came together and were
[44:54] confounded
[44:56] astonished they stupified
[44:59] because that every man heard them speak
[45:01] in his own languag amen and they were
[45:04] all amazed and marveled saying to one
[45:05] another behold are not all these which
[45:07] speak galileans and how hear we every
[45:10] man in our own tongue wherein we were
[45:12] born I've experienced that I heard a man
[45:14] speak to me and ask me a question in in
[45:17] Arabic and I understood it flawlessly in
[45:19] English amen I don't speak a word of
[45:21] Arabic and I understood his question so
[45:24] much that I started to try to answer it
[45:27] without waiting on the translator to
[45:28] tell me what the question was and the
[45:30] translator interrupted me and said hey I
[45:32] haven't even told you what he said and
[45:34] that was at that moment I realized the
[45:36] Holy Spirit was so present I heard him
[45:38] in my own language you say did you hear
[45:41] English it's hard to explain I don't I
[45:44] don't know if I heard English like in
[45:46] this ear but I heard English on an
[45:49] inside ear that's as close as I can come
[45:51] to telling you my I'm only telling you
[45:53] that to tell you this is real
[45:56] amen this isn't hyperbole this isn't a
[45:59] parable this
[46:01] happened amen and I want more of
[46:04] it that's what I want friends that's
[46:07] what I want in my life I want it in your
[46:09] life I want every detail of what I read
[46:12] here in in the book of Acts that
[46:15] happened to them in the upper room if we
[46:16] are restored back to them then we ought
[46:19] to have every
[46:22] detail amen now look what it did verse 4
[46:27] 42 this was this proved that it was of
[46:30] God and all I'm sorry and they continued
[46:34] this is after they believed and were
[46:35] baptized in verse 41 they gladly
[46:38] received his word baptized verse 42 they
[46:40] continued steadfastly in the apostles
[46:43] Doctrine and fellowship and in Breaking
[46:45] of bread and prayers so they became real
[46:48] Christians yes now they were already
[46:51] devout
[46:52] people you understand they all already
[46:56] lived a very religious holy Sanctified
[47:02] life the unwise Virgin live a Sanctified
[47:07] holy life but they're not yet born again
[47:10] they they have the Holy Ghost they've
[47:12] had an experience of the Holy Ghost on
[47:15] their flesh and on their spirit and they
[47:18] have believed un Christ to a to a Saving
[47:20] Grace save from destruction but they
[47:23] clearly are not born again because in
[47:26] Matthew 25 we see them being judged amen
[47:29] and that's certainly not the bride who's
[47:31] Seated on the throne Hallelujah but yet
[47:34] and I'm I'm not saying these devout men
[47:36] are unwise virgin I'm only using that as
[47:38] an example to show you that these were
[47:41] devout men also yet they were not born
[47:44] again of the spirit of God and when they
[47:46] were born again of the spirit of God
[47:48] they didn't become more devout what they
[47:51] did was keep saying Amen to every
[47:54] word amen no wonder that's the evidence
[47:59] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost not
[48:02] that it makes you devout brother
[48:04] brandham said sanctification which is a
[48:06] work of the Holy Ghost will make you
[48:08] stop lying and start going to church
[48:10] it'll clean your life up that's what the
[48:13] UN unwise virgin has happened the king
[48:16] called them righteous people Revelation
[48:18] Book of Revelation calls them saints
[48:20] Saints means Sanctified amen so the
[48:24] point that I want to make again again is
[48:26] that this fire changes you from not just
[48:30] being devout but it actually causes you
[48:34] to say to continue to not only say Amen
[48:37] to the word they asked Peter what must
[48:39] we do he told them okay let's do it and
[48:41] then after that they kept believing and
[48:43] they kept believing and they kept
[48:44] praying and they started breaking bread
[48:46] and they stayed in The Fellowship of the
[48:48] Saints I'm here to tell you this fire
[48:51] that Jesus talked about that seems
[48:53] ominous is is the most wonderful thing
[48:57] that if you ever accept it it'll come
[48:59] down in your life and make you a child
[49:01] of God like he envisioned you to be amen
[49:07] long before you were ever born that's
[49:10] right I don't want to recap too much I
[49:12] don't have time I have so much to get to
[49:15] today but but and that so that that's
[49:18] enough on that what one of the things
[49:20] that that we concluded last time
[49:26] was that when we came to Ruth which was
[49:28] a type of the Bride we found that when
[49:32] Boaz
[49:33] enumerated her life she couldn't
[49:37] understand why why would you take notice
[49:40] of me I'm a I'm not even of this nation
[49:44] I'm a I'm of the of a heathen nation of
[49:47] the moabites that came by an
[49:50] incestual uh Affair between lot and his
[49:53] daughters and and I and I and we we have
[49:55] a semblance of Jehovah but by no means I
[49:59] mean just because you're say well let's
[50:02] like people would say all brother say
[50:03] are you're a Christian they say I'm an
[50:04] American well just because America
[50:06] started on Christian Foundation that
[50:08] doesn't mean because you're an American
[50:09] you're a Christian far from
[50:12] it so just because they might have had
[50:15] some understanding of of the god of
[50:17] Moses that didn't make they were
[50:19] anything outside of of of Israel was a
[50:22] heathen Nation amen understand
[50:26] so it's just like you no matter what the
[50:29] gene of God might be in you you were
[50:32] born in sin you were born as an alien
[50:35] you were born and and we showed you in
[50:38] the in the in the letter uh that sister
[50:41] Rebecca Smith published in only believe
[50:42] magazine how brother brandham explained
[50:44] we're all bastard
[50:46] children that we're all born
[50:48] illegitimately this is this is this is
[50:51] the beauty of adoption in the Holy Ghost
[50:54] because you're born as an illegitimate
[50:56] child and you're adopted into the family
[50:59] of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:02] and brother brandham taught made
[51:05] legitimate amen see so so in in that
[51:10] respect it's it's not always in every
[51:13] respect the spirit of adoption is not
[51:14] exactly like we would talk about
[51:16] adopting a a baby but in that regard
[51:19] it's very
[51:20] similar and so so we realize he brother
[51:23] Brenham puts it there in his own and do
[51:25] not fear sister your new birth or
[51:29] anybody's New Birth uh uh corrects it
[51:34] all I just say thank God thank God thank
[51:37] God corrects it all and we we finished
[51:40] up by showing you that under the order
[51:42] of MDC that in the spirit of adoption
[51:45] which is the Holy Ghost it brings you
[51:47] under the order of MDC who had no
[51:49] beginning of days or ending of life
[51:50] therefore it didn't matter how you were
[51:52] born or how you die or whatever was in
[51:54] the middle you're in the order of MDC
[51:56] nothing of this Fallen life counts
[51:58] against
[52:01] me so it's a powerful image that he he
[52:06] in fact is when she asked him why would
[52:08] you be mindful of me and we we finished
[52:12] by pointing out that the only things he
[52:15] named were her good
[52:18] things and he didn't talk about her bad
[52:21] things say well how do we know she had
[52:23] them because we're all born in sin and
[52:25] there's none good no not one I could
[52:28] read it today there's none good no not
[52:30] Ruth there's none good no no not Abraham
[52:34] Abraham lied and cheated and coni but
[52:37] when Paul told his story it was
[52:40] perfect why because he is he never
[52:44] staggered at the promise I'm here to
[52:46] tell you something friends it should not
[52:48] Shock you that when I say to you that
[52:50] you have believed the word of this hour
[52:53] and you have said amen and the Holy
[52:55] Ghost has acknowledged that by giving
[52:57] sealing you in it doesn't matter
[52:59] whatever you have done it's all
[53:01] eliminated and nothing you ever do will
[53:04] count against you you are now perfect in
[53:07] Christ amen amen
[53:14] amen so it's a powerful image it conveys
[53:18] this
[53:20] fire a transformative
[53:23] power the sacrif of Christ was designed
[53:27] to do nothing less so he's only
[53:31] regarding once I'm in Christ that he's
[53:34] only regarding the remaining good in you
[53:37] is there good in me after I'm born again
[53:39] there's this one good I'm like Mary be
[53:43] it unto me according to Thy word amen
[53:47] see so it's it's and we we we we were
[53:52] showing you how that the Rapture like
[53:55] Ruth was gleaning the Rapture is the
[53:57] final
[53:58] gleaning it's uh it's gleaning of 2,000
[54:01] years and taking God's choice family out
[54:05] of the church a bride called out of the
[54:07] church in the resurrection he gives you
[54:10] this final calling and I'm so glad
[54:13] because when that final oh my when that
[54:17] final calling comes and I'm standing on
[54:21] the other side in a glorified condition
[54:25] there won't be any part of me that I
[54:27] hated any part of me that I was ashamed
[54:30] of any part of me that failed any part
[54:33] of me that's dirty any part of me that
[54:36] there's none of that it's all gone I'm
[54:38] completely
[54:41] transformed I he's only taken the good
[54:45] in me that come from a gene that was
[54:48] actually come from him amen turns me
[54:50] into the real me that had the real me
[54:53] that had really been the real me all
[54:54] along long it connects what it does
[54:57] friends in that final calling it it
[55:01] finishes the process of the new birth
[55:03] because it finally changes your body I'm
[55:06] glad the new birth isn't going to leave
[55:08] me in this
[55:09] one I'm glad I don't have to face a
[55:11] Thousand-Year Millennium in this one you
[55:14] say well what if he restored your health
[55:16] and restored your youth I'd still know
[55:18] that this body had failed him and I want
[55:21] to be in a body that's never failed
[55:24] him
[55:27] Hallelujah it it literally I want to be
[55:33] flawlessly
[55:35] connected from my
[55:37] origin and our and my destination
[55:40] connected back to God that Fountain back
[55:44] in eternity I don't just want to say I
[55:46] am right here today the best I can do is
[55:50] preach and say it is spiritually that
[55:54] and you're New Birth has connected your
[55:56] origin to your destiny and put you back
[55:58] across the chasm and we Rejoice over
[56:02] that but but but this is partial
[56:05] realization I'm coming to perfect
[56:09] realization see so I can I can say that
[56:13] there is now therefore no condemnation
[56:16] possible for me and that's right now
[56:18] that's not coming that's right now but I
[56:21] but you know friends that's it I I that
[56:24] I'm still here are struggling along and
[56:27] I just want to be Beyond The Struggle
[56:30] Hallelujah so I say whatever that fire
[56:33] has to do in my life let it change
[56:37] [Applause]
[56:40] me I don't have it on my PowerPoint I I
[56:43] missed it and I probably it's good
[56:45] because I just want to read through it
[56:47] let me c give you this from Life 1957
[56:52] brother Mark go ahead and get my
[56:53] PowerPoint ready you can put up thep
[56:54] title
[56:57] slide let me catch this one I'll Advance
[57:01] one frame to
[57:04] there brother Brandon now just
[57:07] listen he says in the message life is
[57:09] that a beautiful title or
[57:11] what the great now I just want you
[57:13] you're gonna this is poetry friends
[57:15] you're just going to almost want to
[57:17] close your eyes and just Envision this
[57:19] as a
[57:20] prophet don't go to sleep on me
[57:23] though brother J J said I could close my
[57:25] eyes Mom I fell
[57:28] asleep the great Fountain of all
[57:31] eternity was that Spirit of love joy
[57:35] that Spirit of honesty that Spirit of
[57:37] tress in this Perfection and then out of
[57:40] the existence of the father went the
[57:43] logos which was the son which was a
[57:45] theophany which was the body of the
[57:47] great Jehovah God went forth in a
[57:49] Celestial body that's the logos the word
[57:53] spoke out of them great fountain
[57:54] mountains of life and went forth and
[57:56] there was the theophany which was God
[57:58] made into word then that theophany was
[58:01] made flesh in the person Jes Christ
[58:04] Jesus and then all the fullness of the
[58:05] trinity dwelt in him both Father Son and
[58:08] Holy Spirit all in that not easy to
[58:11] understand
[58:13] amen and that's now watch now that's
[58:17] Christ all right now watch watch he how
[58:19] as he goes
[58:20] on and that's the very way we go Plum
[58:24] back to the original beginning of God
[58:27] there we are born again not of Flesh
[58:30] born again not of blood Born Again by
[58:33] the spirit and in that eternal spirit of
[58:36] love and honesty comes down to make its
[58:39] place in us and then when we die from
[58:42] this life we go into the body which if
[58:45] this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved we
[58:47] have a theophany to go into a Celestial
[58:51] a body Celestial
[58:53] amen then at the coming of the Lord
[58:56] Jesus this body is picked up from the
[58:58] Earth again he's talking about if you go
[58:59] by the way of the Grave this body is
[59:01] picked up from the Earth again and made
[59:04] in a glorified state to live in his
[59:06] presence forever you understand why at
[59:09] at funerals I'm I'm always reminding the
[59:12] family I reminded my family when we put
[59:16] brother Eddie and buried his Temple and
[59:19] I said now this is not brother Eddie
[59:21] this is just the temple he lived in
[59:23] where only sto in it that's all we're
[59:26] doing we're not burying brother Eddie
[59:28] he's alive and well we're only storing
[59:31] the temple he lived in when he comes
[59:34] back on Resurrection morning he'll come
[59:36] right back here and pick this body up
[59:38] and it'll be changed in a moment
[59:40] Hallelujah friend you haven't lost your
[59:43] loved ones oh I'm here to tell you
[59:46] they're more alive than you will ever be
[59:47] alive in this
[59:52] world so he says in
[59:55] so if this which if this Earthly
[59:57] Tabernacle is
[59:59] dissolved we have a theophany to go to a
[1:00:01] body Celestial then at the coming of the
[1:00:03] Lord Jesus his body is picked up from
[1:00:06] the Earth again and made in a glorified
[1:00:08] state to live in his presence
[1:00:10] forever then all the perversion all the
[1:00:13] things oh listen to
[1:00:16] this then all the perversion all the
[1:00:20] things that was in the perversion all
[1:00:23] goes out of
[1:00:27] existence faith f flesh goes to its
[1:00:32] punishment hell opens up her mouth and
[1:00:34] swallows it all swallows in all the evil
[1:00:37] and the perversion and God and his
[1:00:40] beloved Church his bride takes their
[1:00:43] stand for the eternities to roll on
[1:00:47] that's the great hope of the Christian
[1:00:48] church as David screamed out oh thy
[1:00:51] loving kindness is better to me
[1:00:55] than life so I'll ask you the question
[1:00:57] today in light of what you just heard is
[1:01:00] Walking In The Fire worth it I just say
[1:01:04] yes whatever the fire has to burn and
[1:01:07] consume now however hot however trial
[1:01:10] whatever division it might cause and I
[1:01:14] the whole world say my family might
[1:01:15] leave me the whole world might leave you
[1:01:18] but Christ won't leave you I'm here to
[1:01:21] tell you take your stand with the Lord
[1:01:23] Jesus and on that day he'll stand with
[1:01:27] you it's worth it is it worth it
[1:01:36] Church Revelation and and I I I probably
[1:01:40] should read it but I won't because it
[1:01:42] would just take too much
[1:01:43] [Music]
[1:01:44] time so let me just let me just give you
[1:01:48] a break down you can study it when you
[1:01:49] go back home cuz Revelation chapter 1
[1:01:53] let me say it like this Revelation chap
[1:01:56] 1 is the early church before the hybrid
[1:02:02] hybridization started in in Chapter 2 by
[1:02:06] the that's why chapter 2 starts at 853
[1:02:09] not ad33 because brother said that first
[1:02:11] couple of decades church was perfect
[1:02:13] amen so brother and I've got a quote for
[1:02:15] you here brother brandham take and he
[1:02:17] starts from Revelation 21 and he says
[1:02:19] now from right here and he goes on to
[1:02:21] show how from that point you're dealing
[1:02:24] with a a hybrid church it's already
[1:02:25] starting to lose its first love but
[1:02:29] prior to chapter 2 you have the complete
[1:02:36] revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ
[1:02:40] so the unsealing today the unsealing of
[1:02:45] the seventh seal
[1:02:46] today restores us back to the Revelation
[1:02:51] One
[1:02:52] Church it absolutely does does you go
[1:02:55] home today you read the first five
[1:02:57] verses because that's all about the
[1:02:59] deity of Jesus Christ that this
[1:03:01] mysterious God who was a fountain and
[1:03:03] then he was a theophany and then he was
[1:03:05] a flesh and then he ascended and you
[1:03:07] know and then then this whole this whole
[1:03:09] Trinity of God what's the balance I I
[1:03:12] I've said this before I say it again I
[1:03:14] don't see how any trinitarian can read
[1:03:17] Revelation 1 1:5 and stay a
[1:03:22] trinitarian because it's so so clearly
[1:03:25] that that that that God who fills all
[1:03:28] time space and Eternity is Jesus
[1:03:32] Christ
[1:03:34] unmistakably Jesus Christ in those first
[1:03:37] five verses now that's the Revelation
[1:03:40] the deity of Jesus Christ that then when
[1:03:44] you come to verse six we find that it
[1:03:47] says and this same one that I just got
[1:03:50] through telling you about hath now made
[1:03:53] us now it switches to his church it hath
[1:03:56] made us Kings and
[1:03:58] Priests unto God Amen understand all
[1:04:02] right so so when we when we think about
[1:04:07] re being restored to the Revelation One
[1:04:10] Church you'll look down from verse 6 to
[1:04:14] 18 and we are made first of all in verse
[1:04:17] six we're made priest unto God uh who
[1:04:20] had been who had been so clearly
[1:04:23] identified ases Jesus Christ in all of
[1:04:25] his glory and it's described in those
[1:04:27] previous five taken as a whole then now
[1:04:30] just pay close attention to me because
[1:04:32] I'm I'm going to you know really make
[1:04:35] some statements and you're going to want
[1:04:36] to keep
[1:04:38] up taken as a whole
[1:04:42] Revelation 1 veres
[1:04:45] 1-8 show this glorious church as I've
[1:04:49] said prior to the fall all right let me
[1:04:52] let me let me prove that to you you
[1:04:54] because by the time you get to chapter
[1:04:57] two you've got what brother brandham
[1:04:59] calls an ad mixture of true and false
[1:05:03] now you can read it when you go into
[1:05:05] chapter two he commends the true church
[1:05:07] but he's also got a problem with the ni
[1:05:09] Deeds of the
[1:05:10] nickan and he comes back and commends
[1:05:12] the church and then he says but you've
[1:05:14] left your first love and then he comes
[1:05:16] back he says but you've had patience and
[1:05:17] have not denied my name but you got the
[1:05:19] issue so you understand that that's why
[1:05:23] the the the the church ages when brother
[1:05:25] Brandon begins with the Ephesian Church
[1:05:27] ages he's he's starting from the moment
[1:05:31] when when instead of Christ being able
[1:05:34] to come and get a bride she's already
[1:05:36] starting to backslide and that and and
[1:05:39] instead of instead of getting her turned
[1:05:41] around he warns her don't keep going
[1:05:43] because if you do I'll remove your
[1:05:45] Candlestick well she did and he did and
[1:05:49] it went on to the second one and it was
[1:05:50] worse amen and after the second
[1:05:53] messenger Irene IUS they don't even
[1:05:55] understand Revelation 1 1:5 clearly
[1:05:57] anymore they've lost the meaning of the
[1:05:58] godhead irenius was the last one time
[1:06:01] he's gone the church don't even have a
[1:06:02] clear understanding and if you can't
[1:06:05] understand the relationship between
[1:06:06] Christ and the father you'll never
[1:06:07] understand the relationship between you
[1:06:09] and the father cuz you're only a
[1:06:11] continuation of what he
[1:06:13] was you see why that had to be restored
[1:06:16] in this last
[1:06:18] day and so so so you you'll find then
[1:06:22] that it's already come and AD mixture
[1:06:26] brother brandham says in a resume of the
[1:06:27] ages look where he starts Revelation 2:1
[1:06:31] describes the Lord Jesus as in the midst
[1:06:33] of his church and holding the messengers
[1:06:35] in his right hand because this bride has
[1:06:38] fallen because the church corporate is
[1:06:41] now an ad mixture of true and false amen
[1:06:44] not got to read that so you don't think
[1:06:46] I made that up all right you with
[1:06:48] me all right now let me darken that
[1:06:53] perect
[1:06:54] perfect so just as there was an
[1:07:00] unmistakable bride age or a bride
[1:07:05] time uh a time of the full word on the
[1:07:10] front end of the Ephesian Church age so
[1:07:13] now in the restoration there is a
[1:07:16] restoration on the on the latter End of
[1:07:19] the leoan Age back to the full bride
[1:07:23] time amen so it's a bright age to start
[1:07:26] with and a bright age to end with what
[1:07:28] does a bright age entail it means the
[1:07:31] ministry of the son of man which is that
[1:07:34] same Jesus living in his
[1:07:36] church undefiled and and and
[1:07:39] unobstructed he's he's the full word and
[1:07:42] that brings the Jubilee and that brings
[1:07:44] the token and that brings the abstract
[1:07:47] title
[1:07:50] deed see so you can see that in your
[1:07:53] mind I'm sure no that's why he's the
[1:07:55] Alpha and the Omega and brother brandham
[1:07:57] says you don't say a whole lot about the
[1:07:58] middle because he's in the middle he's
[1:08:01] walking in the midst of the seven
[1:08:03] lampstands but not everything in the
[1:08:05] middle is purely him anymore it's a
[1:08:08] hybridization as we read all right it's
[1:08:12] a
[1:08:13] hybridization an ad mixture it's not
[1:08:15] purely him but he comes back to purely
[1:08:19] him when do you
[1:08:21] have je when do you have
[1:08:24] Jesus as purely
[1:08:27] him when a Doctrine is revealed no amen
[1:08:33] when a people have received it eaten it
[1:08:37] and become it amen see and and so that's
[1:08:41] why you know brother Bram even makes
[1:08:43] some illustrations that I I can feel
[1:08:44] myself trying to get sidetracked and I'm
[1:08:46] not going to do that I'm going to keep
[1:08:48] moving so so we find out then that that
[1:08:53] it turns the original full token this is
[1:08:57] why brother Brandon would say the ages
[1:08:58] only had a dip because the token is
[1:09:01] proportionate to the level of word you
[1:09:04] have always amen all right so it's not
[1:09:07] that it wasn't the Holy Ghost it's just
[1:09:09] that their word their misunderstanding
[1:09:11] of the word blocked part of their uh uh
[1:09:17] part of the allotment or ra I think more
[1:09:20] perfectly I could say Christ was HD Ed
[1:09:24] from being his full self because you
[1:09:27] can't diminish him I don't want to give
[1:09:28] the language that a dip meant he was
[1:09:30] something diminished he was still who he
[1:09:32] was but brother brand you remember
[1:09:35] brother brandham said that the church
[1:09:37] had him Bound for two almost 2,000 years
[1:09:41] that he couldn't work in the church but
[1:09:44] in the opening of the seals it loosed
[1:09:46] him he's now Unbound because why he's
[1:09:50] got a people who say Amen once again to
[1:09:55] every
[1:09:56] word and that entitles them to the Token
[1:10:00] obedience to the word entitles you to
[1:10:02] the Token amen you with me amen all
[1:10:07] right so this is so this then we find
[1:10:10] that just as Israel is restored under
[1:10:13] the trumpets to their rightful land the
[1:10:16] Omega bride is restored to her position
[1:10:19] in the word of full Authority Under the
[1:10:22] seal she seated together in Heavenly
[1:10:26] places with God in Christ we are made
[1:10:30] brother brandham emphasizes that we are
[1:10:32] made Kings and Priests to God because
[1:10:36] we're extending he is now able to extend
[1:10:39] his word through our lives
[1:10:43] amen now you remember when I started the
[1:10:46] great advantage of this fire don't
[1:10:48] Lament The Fire amen because it makes
[1:10:51] you available to be for that fire fire
[1:10:53] to have a ripple effect for that fire to
[1:10:56] have a a collateral effect on people you
[1:11:00] love amen and I'm here to tell
[1:11:03] you parents and grandparents sometimes
[1:11:06] have to pray you know broken hearted
[1:11:10] tears because they see the fire of God
[1:11:13] burning up their children and they have
[1:11:15] to keep praying Lord pour it
[1:11:18] on and that's not easy see your child or
[1:11:21] grandchild suffering but you know that
[1:11:24] he knows what he's doing you can trust
[1:11:27] him M daddies grandparents you can trust
[1:11:32] him
[1:11:34] Hallelujah
[1:11:36] see so so we find then that it's it
[1:11:40] we're made Kings and Priests because
[1:11:42] he's now able to extend his word through
[1:11:44] our lives that's what he was that's what
[1:11:46] he was always after in Genesis 1 128 be
[1:11:50] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[1:11:53] plan was always what it is brother
[1:11:57] brandham didn't make that up that's what
[1:11:58] it was in Genesis but sin and the fall
[1:12:02] interrupted his program brother brandham
[1:12:03] said but you come anyway but you were
[1:12:05] lost and so he sent Christ in the form
[1:12:08] of a human being to die for you and
[1:12:10] redeems his family back to him and then
[1:12:14] the eternities roll on my never to be
[1:12:16] broken again in that wonderful as this
[1:12:19] bride is predestinated not to fall so we
[1:12:22] go forth in power and demonstration from
[1:12:24] now into the ceaseless ages and from
[1:12:28] there all the way into the future
[1:12:30] outpouring of the Hidden Mana which is a
[1:12:33] Eternal revelation of Jesus Christ oh my
[1:12:35] friends what lays in front of us I said
[1:12:38] it before I say it a thousand times
[1:12:39] again our future is
[1:12:42] bright so so the current
[1:12:46] stage the current stage of this ministry
[1:12:51] today brother Jason what's it all about
[1:12:53] what is the message all about is it just
[1:12:55] God sent a prophet it's much more than
[1:12:57] that what is the current stage of this
[1:13:00] ministry it is it is Christ moving
[1:13:05] through his family uh who who are
[1:13:09] literally an expression of that original
[1:13:12] Fountain I don't know if you can grasp
[1:13:15] this today but you are a continued
[1:13:18] expression of that fountain in eternity
[1:13:21] that we read about in life from 19
[1:13:24] 57 from that time in that Fountain you
[1:13:29] existed you were an attribute in that in
[1:13:32] that great Fountain and he said out of
[1:13:34] there poured forth love and poured forth
[1:13:36] mercy and poured forth healing and
[1:13:38] poured forth Grace and I'll say this and
[1:13:40] it poured forth family yeah amen
[1:13:44] see and so we find that that it's it's
[1:13:48] Christ moving through his family an
[1:13:51] expression of that original found
[1:13:53] Mountain she's part of the continuation
[1:13:55] of creation she's now taking her place
[1:13:58] and this is a strong statement you
[1:13:59] buckled in she's taking her place now in
[1:14:03] the new birth as part of God's
[1:14:08] godhead
[1:14:11] amen let's
[1:14:15] see 1965 God's provided place of worship
[1:14:19] in him dwells the fullness of the
[1:14:21] godhead bodily where we we by say we in
[1:14:26] there our sons and daughters to God in
[1:14:29] God's godhead yes as Sons and Daughters
[1:14:33] we're in the family if you're in
[1:14:36] there so you know if if you're going to
[1:14:40] use a trinitarian 2+ 2 equals 4 then
[1:14:44] then he's not three he's like a couple
[1:14:46] of
[1:14:48] million but that's not how you think of
[1:14:50] him amen see it's not it's not thought
[1:14:53] of linearly like that it and the reason
[1:14:56] they think of it linearly like that is
[1:14:57] because they don't understand brother
[1:14:59] bram's explanation on expression it's
[1:15:02] just him continuing to express himself
[1:15:05] in a further part he explained it so
[1:15:07] good there in life how that Jesus how
[1:15:10] that the fountain went to uh the logos
[1:15:13] and the logos went to a body and the
[1:15:15] body went into his church and the church
[1:15:17] fell away and now it's restored back and
[1:15:19] now that's picking back up again we're
[1:15:21] headed for a new world I'm here to tell
[1:15:24] you you're not going to go down in the
[1:15:25] destruction of the fire that's going to
[1:15:28] destroy this world not you and not any
[1:15:31] of your loved ones that you've claimed
[1:15:32] in faith under the token I'm here to
[1:15:35] tell you I don't know how it'll happen
[1:15:37] but God cannot break his word he cannot
[1:15:39] break his promise
[1:15:43] Hallelujah see and so so we find then
[1:15:47] that that we are part of his godhead to
[1:15:51] participate in Recon ilation for the
[1:15:54] sins of the people and we're partners
[1:15:57] with Christ to finish redemption's
[1:16:01] claims to seek and to find that's our
[1:16:04] mission to seek and to find the last
[1:16:07] name that's on the book that through the
[1:16:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost you know
[1:16:13] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:16] according to John 20 you're even
[1:16:18] invested with power to to to uh forgive
[1:16:23] give and remit sin
[1:16:26] amen that's blasphemy I I'm only reading
[1:16:29] John 20 22 to 20 uh 22 to 23 that Jesus
[1:16:34] said he said he breathed on them and and
[1:16:37] and and potential the Holy Ghost he
[1:16:39] didn't come to the upper room he
[1:16:40] breathed on them and said receive ye the
[1:16:42] Holy Ghost now whosoever sins you remit
[1:16:44] they are remitted amen now we know it
[1:16:47] that the Catholic took the mental
[1:16:50] understanding and put a a black robed
[1:16:52] man who needed converting himself in a
[1:16:54] booth and another unconverted and they
[1:16:57] they tell each other their faults and
[1:16:58] failures and somehow they're going to
[1:17:00] heaven well that's ridiculous because
[1:17:03] the man comes out with the same sin he
[1:17:05] went in only now all he's got to do is
[1:17:08] say the rosary so many times or a few
[1:17:11] good deeds and that's all he needs to
[1:17:13] worry
[1:17:17] about he's
[1:17:19] he's he has failed before he started
[1:17:23] started before he went into the booth
[1:17:26] he's already failed because the only way
[1:17:30] to get a new birth excuse
[1:17:36] me is saying Amen to every
[1:17:40] word somebody brother Luther in my bag
[1:17:43] uh the back of my black black bag is
[1:17:46] throat loses bring me one hurry run jump
[1:17:51] flip you back yet
[1:17:56] excuse
[1:17:57] me
[1:18:00] so devil ain't gonna it ain't going to
[1:18:02] work devil you're wasting your time if I
[1:18:04] have to just talk the rest of this
[1:18:06] sermon I'm going
[1:18:08] to so we find then
[1:18:11] that that the the Alpha and Omega of
[1:18:15] Revelation
[1:18:17] 118 he's the Alpha and the Omega he is
[1:18:21] moving in the Earth again today you
[1:18:26] believe it you got something for me yeah
[1:18:29] don't throw it bring it up here I'll
[1:18:33] miss Mom could one hand grab it but I'll
[1:18:36] miss oh I don't know if that's the one I
[1:18:39] want no that's oh man I'll want five of
[1:18:42] them if I eat that that's a worther now
[1:18:44] I'll wait on the good
[1:18:46] one I'll just go man bring me another
[1:18:49] one amen be nice fuel for preaching but
[1:18:52] we'd be here all day if I start eating
[1:18:56] wors so we find that he's walking again
[1:19:00] in the midst of his true church that's
[1:19:02] the ministry of the son of man and so we
[1:19:05] find that in Revelation
[1:19:06] 113 that he's operating through an
[1:19:09] obedient
[1:19:11] bride now that you we're not reading one
[1:19:13] we're not reading it right now but
[1:19:15] that's that's when you go home and read
[1:19:17] it that's what you're going to find in
[1:19:19] verse 13 that this Alpha and Omega is
[1:19:23] working he's alive working through an
[1:19:25] obedient bride who has GED about the
[1:19:28] paths with a golden girdle brother
[1:19:30] brandham said notice that that's an
[1:19:33] image of the Son of God in the form of
[1:19:35] his
[1:19:36] bride amen see so so so I'm I'm saying
[1:19:40] all this to make these points so then
[1:19:42] the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ that
[1:19:46] we see on display in verses 14 and 15 is
[1:19:51] now abiding verse 14 and 15 thank you
[1:19:55] sir he's now oh wow I can preach a while
[1:19:58] now he's now
[1:20:01] abiding may not need it he's now
[1:20:05] abiding uh in a voice of many
[1:20:08] Waters amen he's now that's verse 14 and
[1:20:13] 15 he's now he's a voice of many Waters
[1:20:16] it's this same Jesus Christ and he's got
[1:20:19] seven stars in his right hand to give
[1:20:22] Authority to the to the voice of the
[1:20:25] ministers oh Hallelujah there's my
[1:20:28] authority today friends I got a prophet
[1:20:30] a star in his right hand I don't have to
[1:20:32] guess at it I don't have to wonder can I
[1:20:35] get you home I already know I
[1:20:38] can if you'll just accept it see that's
[1:20:42] what say oh well I'm a king but but
[1:20:46] remember that your kingship is is only
[1:20:50] legitimized in your priesthood
[1:20:53] amen don't just go God's not going to
[1:20:55] invest a kingly Authority in you if you
[1:20:57] don't have any character so you say well
[1:21:00] how do I become a priest by surrendering
[1:21:02] your life and let Let Him Live his
[1:21:04] through you that's that's a priesthood
[1:21:07] that's where brother bradam said and I
[1:21:09] don't have it here he talks about how
[1:21:11] that you know if
[1:21:13] you something this simple now here's a
[1:21:16] real simple one you can't even
[1:21:18] stumble it'll do us all good to be
[1:21:21] reminded of it he said
[1:21:23] if something happens and somebody does
[1:21:26] you some way in the church and does you
[1:21:29] wrong and hurts your feelings and you go
[1:21:33] sit over in a corner and pout he said
[1:21:36] you're no
[1:21:38] priest because you're to bring forth
[1:21:41] spiritual
[1:21:42] Praises unto God you you should be more
[1:21:45] bulletproof than that you should not
[1:21:47] wear your feeling on your sleeve like
[1:21:49] that we're all in this thing together
[1:21:51] y'all we all have our ups and downs but
[1:21:54] we cover for one another we love one
[1:21:57] another Hallelujah see so so it's your
[1:22:00] priesthood are you willing to live your
[1:22:03] life so that your life in action in real
[1:22:07] time is a living a life of Living
[1:22:10] Sacrifice the the Christian Life brother
[1:22:13] brandham said is a life of self
[1:22:16] crucifixion and living for others you're
[1:22:19] certainly not living for others if
[1:22:22] you're if you're trying to get all you
[1:22:25] can and be all that you want to be and
[1:22:28] it's harming others around you including
[1:22:31] those you say you love the most right
[1:22:34] and yet your your refusal to be a real
[1:22:37] priest is hindering them you're not a
[1:22:39] priest at all you're
[1:22:41] selfish see so so again I will say that
[1:22:45] your Authority as kings is is
[1:22:50] legitimized by your priesthood
[1:22:53] see you can't get you can't get the that
[1:22:55] turned around because then you you run
[1:22:58] off trying to do something for God and
[1:22:59] you yourself need
[1:23:01] converted that was Calvin's problem he
[1:23:04] was you know they said to brother bradam
[1:23:06] you know Calvin you know why do you say
[1:23:08] you know brother brandham knew very much
[1:23:10] and and they said well Calvin did this
[1:23:12] and Calvin did that and historically you
[1:23:14] can't deny it and brother brandham said
[1:23:16] yeah said see Calvin needed converting
[1:23:20] himself I'd never I read his history
[1:23:22] have the courage to say that but a
[1:23:24] prophet knew that that life was a life
[1:23:27] that that operated in justification and
[1:23:29] sanctification but had never been born
[1:23:31] again of the Holy Spirit you see why
[1:23:33] Calvin couldn't be the
[1:23:35] messenger see so Luther had false
[1:23:38] Doctrine but he was born again Wesley
[1:23:41] didn't have all the correct teaching he
[1:23:43] taught a trinity doctrine of which is
[1:23:45] three unclean spirits like frogs the
[1:23:48] doctrine that I'm glad Wesley was in the
[1:23:51] sixth age but because if if brother
[1:23:53] Brandon would have been preaching that
[1:23:54] in the seventh age the Bible tells us in
[1:23:57] Revelation 16 that that Trinity Doctrine
[1:24:00] will lead people to
[1:24:02] Armageddon I ain't wanting to go
[1:24:04] there and so I'm not that the Trinity
[1:24:07] Doctrine will lead you to the mark of
[1:24:09] the beast that's right that's why my
[1:24:12] personal belief and this is just brother
[1:24:13] Jason I think that the unwise Virgin are
[1:24:16] are Oneness at least I don't I don't see
[1:24:18] how they could at least if they are
[1:24:20] Trinity trinitarian now the
[1:24:23] misunderstanding I think somehow in the
[1:24:25] in the tribulation God will get it to
[1:24:26] them and they'll they'll come clear to
[1:24:28] not they'll they'll it'll somehow to be
[1:24:30] exposed and because the Bible tells me
[1:24:33] that everyone shall worship the Beast
[1:24:36] whose name is not written in the Book of
[1:24:38] Life of the
[1:24:39] Lamb see so even the unwise Virgin have
[1:24:43] their names in The Book of Life but it's
[1:24:46] not that's not the what brother brandham
[1:24:48] called The Bride book you'll read you'll
[1:24:50] see it here in a minute amen see
[1:24:53] so so then we find that as I said as I
[1:24:56] said verse 14 and
[1:24:58] 15 have the voice of many Waters Christ
[1:25:01] working through his church verse 16
[1:25:04] where you'll find when you go read it at
[1:25:05] home verse 16 brings back the razor
[1:25:08] sharp two-edged s sword in the mouth of
[1:25:11] the church that's how she's the final
[1:25:14] voice to the final age do you know why
[1:25:17] we're the final voice to the final age
[1:25:20] because under our Prophet who only
[1:25:25] taught what Paul taught amen and Paul
[1:25:29] describes his ministry and you can
[1:25:32] fairly conclude that Paul was the final
[1:25:36] voice to all the
[1:25:37] ages that his teaching could not be
[1:25:40] countermanded by anybody and everybody
[1:25:44] that came after him had to build on his
[1:25:46] foundation and he said be careful
[1:25:49] because no other Foundation can be laid
[1:25:52] than what I and on the Judgment Day God
[1:25:55] will judge the World by what I preached
[1:25:57] I'm glad a prophet said I only preach
[1:26:00] what Paul preached and millions and here
[1:26:03] we are today we're ready to join the
[1:26:05] millions and say we know that and we are
[1:26:07] resting on
[1:26:11] that Paul's teaching couldn't be
[1:26:13] countermanded even by God because he had
[1:26:17] gotten it from God and God can't change
[1:26:20] his mind about his word
[1:26:24] hallelujah oh my friends you see why
[1:26:27] that this that at the end of Leo sea
[1:26:30] there's a complete restoration now with
[1:26:33] that restoration ought to come that same
[1:26:35] fire amen don't forget that because I'm
[1:26:38] coming to that again I'm going to circle
[1:26:41] back to
[1:26:41] that so verse 16 of Revelation 1 I've
[1:26:45] told you that we're restored back to the
[1:26:47] Revelation One
[1:26:49] Church verse 16 brings back the razor
[1:26:52] her sharp two-edged sword in the mouth
[1:26:54] of his church who's the final voice to
[1:26:56] the final Age and and she is as it
[1:27:00] describes of Christ shining in its
[1:27:03] strength ready for a Rapture I don't
[1:27:05] know what the devil has badgered you
[1:27:07] with all week long but I'm here to tell
[1:27:09] you when God looks at you his word and
[1:27:11] his Bible about you is you're shining in
[1:27:14] your strength Hallelujah and the devil
[1:27:17] cannot stop that and that's why he hates
[1:27:19] it so
[1:27:20] bad amen so the time then of course
[1:27:24] we've also come to the time of the
[1:27:26] fullness of all the
[1:27:28] sevens so you have SE various sets of
[1:27:31] seven brother Brenham discusses it uh
[1:27:34] this is this is all for the completion
[1:27:36] of redemption the unfolding time uh of
[1:27:40] the seventh seal is for the Redemption
[1:27:42] of the Gentiles the seventh trumpet is
[1:27:45] to redeem Israel and then the pouring
[1:27:48] out of seven vials in its fullness which
[1:27:51] happens under the seventh seal uh
[1:27:54] because the seventh seal even when we're
[1:27:57] gone the seventh seal is still
[1:28:00] unwinding it unwinds all the way through
[1:28:02] the tribulation and it unwinds all the
[1:28:04] way through the Millennium because the
[1:28:05] millennium's still in time see and so
[1:28:08] the seventh seal everything ends up when
[1:28:10] the seventh seal is done we find that
[1:28:13] it's ready for a new heavens and a new
[1:28:15] Earth so when we're gone the seventh
[1:28:17] seal continues to unfold in judgments
[1:28:20] upon the unbelieving world through the
[1:28:22] seven
[1:28:23] vials so brother brandham says this oops
[1:28:29] see uh yeah that's what I
[1:28:33] want and now as we study this we are
[1:28:36] comparing it now the first three books
[1:28:39] of the Bible of Revelation which we have
[1:28:42] pretty thoroughly cover combed that in
[1:28:44] the church ages now catch this statement
[1:28:47] because it it augments what I just said
[1:28:49] the seven Church ages now there is seven
[1:28:53] Church ages Seven Seals seven trumpets
[1:28:57] and vials and unclean spirits like frogs
[1:29:01] this is all Revelation 16 and all this
[1:29:05] goes together amen so you understand
[1:29:09] that that as I've explained it to you
[1:29:11] before you know when when when he's in
[1:29:15] Europe and the sixth trumpet is now
[1:29:20] sounding and 200 million demon special
[1:29:25] Chargers are being released to go after
[1:29:28] the Jews to chase them back into the
[1:29:31] Homeland back across this side of the
[1:29:34] pond he's in a tree speaking to a small
[1:29:37] boy saying don't ever drink or smoke or
[1:29:40] defile your body cuz I got a work for
[1:29:43] you to do when you get older and he's
[1:29:44] working both sides at the same time oh
[1:29:48] you're part of something so unimaginable
[1:29:51] to the world and here you are friends
[1:29:54] and this is Elementary to us oh I feel
[1:29:56] so privileged today I never wanted to
[1:29:59] say Amen to the word more than I do
[1:30:01] right
[1:30:02] now
[1:30:04] Hallelujah see so when you know even
[1:30:08] even before that if you go back under
[1:30:09] the fifth trumpet before the sixth
[1:30:11] trumpet back before World War I and a
[1:30:14] star falls from heaven under the fifth
[1:30:16] trumpet and you find that it's brother
[1:30:19] brandom identifies that as Lucifer how
[1:30:21] are are fallen from the heaven Lucifer's
[1:30:23] son of the morning and he's given keys
[1:30:26] to the bottomless pit keys he hadn't had
[1:30:27] in his hand in 2,000 years and he's
[1:30:30] given a temporary power to open the the
[1:30:32] lid of hell and brother brandham says
[1:30:34] the lids been torn from hell and demon
[1:30:37] powers are streaming into the Earth
[1:30:40] because now he's got to bring on the
[1:30:42] first and second and third woe the
[1:30:44] world's never had to experience that
[1:30:46] she's never had global war she's had
[1:30:48] wars and rumors of wars and Nations
[1:30:50] shall rise against Nations but the end
[1:30:52] is not yet but when the woes begin and
[1:30:55] how are they going to begin because
[1:30:57] Satan comes down and takes the lid and
[1:30:59] demon powers and now everybody's ready
[1:31:02] for a global war you say oh my goodness
[1:31:05] what is God going to do about it right
[1:31:07] at that time in the turn of the 20th
[1:31:09] century right while that is happening
[1:31:11] it's already happened under the fifth
[1:31:13] trumpet and back across the pond in in
[1:31:16] in Los Angeles he's coming to ausa
[1:31:19] street because when the enemy comes in
[1:31:21] like a flood he'll raise up a
[1:31:24] standard I'm here to tell you no matter
[1:31:26] what happens to this world and it'll
[1:31:28] rock out there in the Judgment I'll be
[1:31:30] safe under the wings of Jehovah we'll be
[1:31:34] gathered around the throne
[1:31:37] Hallelujah don't think he hasn't got a
[1:31:39] plan don't think he already knows what's
[1:31:42] going to happen and all y say Lord bring
[1:31:45] the fire on whatever it takes I want
[1:31:48] what happened in that upper room I want
[1:31:50] it to permeate my life
[1:31:52] [Applause]
[1:31:54] life you understand you with
[1:31:58] me
[1:32:00] see so these these events
[1:32:05] conclude the the these seals and
[1:32:09] trumpets and vials and woes and they
[1:32:13] they literally
[1:32:14] conclude the age of man living in a
[1:32:17] fallen
[1:32:19] condition they they the seals and the
[1:32:23] trumpets and the vials are to to to to
[1:32:27] bring about Everlasting
[1:32:30] righteousness to seal the vision and
[1:32:33] prophecy to anoint the most holy and to
[1:32:36] usher in the millennial reign of Mr and
[1:32:39] Mrs Jesus Christ
[1:32:42] amen so I just want you to know today
[1:32:46] he's got it all in
[1:32:48] control amen this king and queen rain
[1:32:52] together in the Earth from a palacial
[1:32:55] grounds of a restored brother brandham
[1:32:57] called it a restored Garden of Eden now
[1:33:00] this all being true friends then we can
[1:33:04] identify ourselves in
[1:33:07] time I can place it with history I can
[1:33:10] overlay the fifth and sixth trumpet and
[1:33:13] I can point you to the turn of the 20th
[1:33:15] century prior to World War I I can point
[1:33:18] you to the the beating of War drums
[1:33:20] again in World War II
[1:33:22] we can see that the seventh seal was the
[1:33:25] unveiling of all the seals cuz they're
[1:33:27] wrapped up in Scrolls brother B say it's
[1:33:30] not like a book like this so the the the
[1:33:33] Christ had to do that because the church
[1:33:35] fell away remember where we read and
[1:33:37] instead of Jesus being able to come and
[1:33:39] get a bride he he must now sit down in
[1:33:42] the eternities intercede for ignorance
[1:33:45] for 2,000 years seal up the word in
[1:33:48] Seven Seals and then it can't it can't
[1:33:50] be unlocked into till the end time amen
[1:33:53] and so he takes the first seals like
[1:33:55] he's got seven it's seven Scrolls
[1:33:57] imagine seven pieces of paper stacked
[1:33:59] seven
[1:34:00] High one all right you've got you've got
[1:34:03] all this stacked here and so you you
[1:34:05] take the first one and you roll it up in
[1:34:08] a scroll and you put a tie and you seal
[1:34:10] it you lay it on the second one and you
[1:34:12] roll it up again and then you tie and
[1:34:14] seal that one then you lay it on the
[1:34:15] third one and roll it up again so the
[1:34:17] first one is rolled inside the second
[1:34:19] one and the second one's rolled inside
[1:34:20] the third one MH you follow me and
[1:34:23] that's the way he does it fourth fifth
[1:34:25] seal it up six seal it up seven seal it
[1:34:28] up so people who say the seventh seal is
[1:34:31] not open if it's not open none of them
[1:34:34] are because you can't get to any of them
[1:34:36] until you open the outer
[1:34:38] ones Hallelujah say what is it a a a a a
[1:34:43] big Treasure Trove of Doctrine no it's
[1:34:46] the unveiling of Christ the unveiling of
[1:34:49] the word like he was in Revelation one
[1:34:52] when the church was a a voice of many
[1:34:55] Waters when the church was full of power
[1:34:57] and believing when the church had the
[1:35:00] fire of the Holy
[1:35:02] Ghost
[1:35:03] Hallelujah see so it places Us in time
[1:35:08] it it it identifies ourselves in time it
[1:35:11] places Us in Prophecy it declares with
[1:35:15] authority that the time of the final
[1:35:18] voice to the final age has arrived and
[1:35:23] we go forward in this age and I want to
[1:35:26] tell you something what that fire of the
[1:35:27] Holy Ghost is sent to do you say oh it's
[1:35:30] going to make me the final voice to the
[1:35:32] final age what does that even mean I can
[1:35:35] tell you this it's not a cliche I can
[1:35:38] tell you what the final voice to the
[1:35:40] final age is in an age when the lid is
[1:35:42] torn from hell in an age where Satan's
[1:35:44] eating is here in an age where he's
[1:35:46] reached his Zenith and he's the God of
[1:35:48] this evil age a final voice of authority
[1:35:51] means that I can come in any situation
[1:35:53] and take every devil under my control
[1:35:56] for the glory of God come into our home
[1:35:59] speak to our children speak to our
[1:36:01] neighbors no matter what it is you have
[1:36:04] the authority of the word of God that's
[1:36:07] what the fire
[1:36:10] does that's what the Holy Ghost is given
[1:36:15] forl that's why you're a
[1:36:18] king you say well how do I how do I
[1:36:20] activate be a priest you won't have to
[1:36:24] activate it it activates
[1:36:26] itself but you got to be a priest just
[1:36:29] like just like Brother Brad was quoting
[1:36:31] and brother Caleb had quoted there are
[1:36:32] certain things God won't do you've got
[1:36:35] to be willing to be a priest and when
[1:36:38] you're a priest then the heaven comes
[1:36:40] behind you and now your word is a
[1:36:42] king Oh Glory to God what is your need
[1:36:46] today this isn't a charismatic meeting
[1:36:48] where I just nothing name it claim it
[1:36:50] nothing do it what what is your need
[1:36:52] today I find that my need is not a
[1:36:54] bigger house and a better car but I want
[1:36:56] to be an
[1:36:57] overcomer I want to be an overcomer I
[1:37:00] want to see this flesh put under the
[1:37:03] control of the holy
[1:37:07] spirit this is what the Holy Ghost is
[1:37:10] given
[1:37:11] for this is why he came to start a
[1:37:16] fire not a nefarious reason not an evil
[1:37:20] reason
[1:37:22] just like the SI the six trumpet demon
[1:37:25] powers
[1:37:26] released brings about a holocaust and
[1:37:30] brother Bram could actually call that
[1:37:32] the tender hand of
[1:37:36] Jehovah my wife and I talking about it
[1:37:38] this morning he literally
[1:37:41] allowed a demon Spirit to go down and
[1:37:44] deceive King Ahab because they're having
[1:37:47] a conference how can we trick him how
[1:37:50] can we bring Elijah words to pass
[1:37:52] because Elijah said he's got to be
[1:37:53] killed and he's got to die this a
[1:37:55] certain exact kind of death so what's
[1:37:57] the best way to do it you say I mean
[1:38:01] couldn't God just like already have the
[1:38:02] best idea yeah but it's just like Jesus
[1:38:06] standing there said the Harvest is ripe
[1:38:09] the labors are few pray to the Lord of
[1:38:12] the Harvest that he sent forth labors
[1:38:14] and brother M said he himself was the
[1:38:16] lord of the Harvest and he's saying to
[1:38:17] them I want to do this but I want you to
[1:38:20] be involved I want you to prayed to me I
[1:38:22] want you to ask me I want my family's
[1:38:25] involvement Hallelujah that's the Old
[1:38:27] Testament order there's nothing like a
[1:38:29] family all working together and pulling
[1:38:31] together and loving together and
[1:38:32] worshiping together Hallelujah friends
[1:38:36] that's what that's the kind of home the
[1:38:37] Holy Ghost can get behind amen
[1:38:42] amen amen yes sir so so we we we find
[1:38:47] that you know the the Lord's an evil
[1:38:50] spirit from from the Lord went to
[1:38:53] torment Saul Now brother BR said God
[1:38:56] don't put sickness on his children the
[1:38:57] devil does that so an evil spirit from
[1:39:00] the Lord just simply means like he did
[1:39:02] to to King Ahab he he permitted he
[1:39:05] authorized an evil spirit to go and
[1:39:07] torment Saul say why because Saul was in
[1:39:10] the way he was rejecting the word he
[1:39:13] would not accept David David had already
[1:39:14] been anointed king and Saul wouldn't
[1:39:16] have it and got mad and tried to kill
[1:39:18] him so God punished him was he lost no
[1:39:22] he was saved why because he was a Son of
[1:39:25] God and he took a weapon and it took his
[1:39:28] life but Isaiah I me but Samuel said
[1:39:32] tomorrow you'll be with me in Paradise
[1:39:35] amen see
[1:39:37] amen so we find that we can now identify
[1:39:41] ourselves in time I got to pause with
[1:39:43] this last set of
[1:39:45] quotes we can identify ourselves in time
[1:39:48] we can place
[1:39:50] ourselves in Prophecy we can declare
[1:39:53] with
[1:39:54] authority that this is the time of the
[1:39:56] final voice to the final
[1:39:58] age we can go forward taking every
[1:40:01] Spirit of this Dark Age under our
[1:40:03] control through the Holy
[1:40:06] Ghost brother brandham says it like this
[1:40:10] the Mighty God unveiled before us
[1:40:12] 1964 but now as
[1:40:14] ever the skin
[1:40:17] Veil is what catches the traditions
[1:40:21] amen they just can't
[1:40:24] believe that that is god making them
[1:40:26] people act like that see it's
[1:40:31] because here's why God is veiled in his
[1:40:34] church in skin skin on
[1:40:39] it 64 the Mighty God look at the title
[1:40:44] who's God he's going to unveil himself
[1:40:46] well when he did who was it his
[1:40:48] church you you're you're part of the
[1:40:53] Mighty God
[1:40:55] unveiled that the world thinks you're
[1:40:58] cult because they can't see it see so
[1:41:03] because God has veiled in his church in
[1:41:05] skin skin on it that's right he is hid
[1:41:08] from the
[1:41:09] unbeliever and revealed to the believer
[1:41:12] yes
[1:41:14] sir amen whoa thank you I don't know
[1:41:18] what happened
[1:41:19] there oh no devil a playing there Matt
[1:41:23] bring me
[1:41:24] back there's always an override button
[1:41:28] hey man you once you bring it back
[1:41:30] brother Mark uh uh go go back one let me
[1:41:33] make sure we had
[1:41:36] that one
[1:41:38] more one
[1:41:40] more keep it going don't read keep it
[1:41:44] going brother Mark keep going we'll go
[1:41:46] looking for
[1:41:47] 1964 right there um go back one more to
[1:41:51] the one we read there's the one we read
[1:41:53] all right he is hid from the unbeliever
[1:41:56] and revealed to the believer yes sir
[1:41:58] next same quote one one
[1:42:02] slide now when their tradition veil of
[1:42:06] traditions of the elders and the word is
[1:42:08] broke through oh of course today then
[1:42:11] comes in plain view we see him look at
[1:42:15] it with me deity again veiled in human
[1:42:19] flesh I love how he says that Hebrews 1
[1:42:22] says so see he's he's he's loing back to
[1:42:27] the final voice of all the ages go home
[1:42:29] read Hebrews one you'll find that that's
[1:42:31] what he's saying now let's go to 65 and
[1:42:34] this is where we're
[1:42:36] finishing notice now then you are a son
[1:42:39] of God I want to give you this and we'll
[1:42:40] send you home or send you to the
[1:42:41] fellowship
[1:42:43] hall notice now then you are a son of
[1:42:47] God in the house of God you are a part
[1:42:50] of God's economy you love that Romans 81
[1:42:54] there then there is no condemnation to
[1:42:57] them which are in Christ Jesus for they
[1:42:59] are dead to the world alive in him and
[1:43:02] living in his present in this present
[1:43:04] day making the word that God has used
[1:43:08] them or foreordained them placing their
[1:43:11] name there it is in this bride book
[1:43:14] that's see that's a different section of
[1:43:16] the Book of Life
[1:43:18] Next and when the Waters comes upon that
[1:43:22] seed that's in the heart raises it up to
[1:43:27] the bride of Christ oh my just perfect
[1:43:30] as it can be in every age it's been that
[1:43:33] way the Lutheran under justification the
[1:43:37] feet raised it like that Wesley under
[1:43:41] sanctification the Pentecostals under
[1:43:44] the arms the works and deeds and so
[1:43:46] forth had to be calvinist he corrects
[1:43:49] himself or had to be Armenian had to be
[1:43:51] legalist but now we come to the Head the
[1:43:56] Capstone Grace Grace the Capstone
[1:44:00] cried next The Headstone crying what
[1:44:04] Grace Grace pass from death and Creed
[1:44:08] into a Living Word of the Living God
[1:44:11] God's only provided plan for his age his
[1:44:15] sons in the word age quickened by the
[1:44:18] spirit like a spark that's lit off
[1:44:21] something to make it alive and seated
[1:44:23] now in Heavenly places in present tense
[1:44:27] already alive and subject to every
[1:44:30] promise in the word
[1:44:33] finally then what does that do looks
[1:44:36] like we might have one more what does
[1:44:37] that do you being a part of God's Gene a
[1:44:42] part of the word other men a part of
[1:44:45] God's word seated together manifested
[1:44:47] the entire body of Christ because
[1:44:50] there's I love that there's no leaven
[1:44:52] among you see what he's talking about
[1:44:55] brother Brown no leaven among you just
[1:44:57] the word only seated in Heavenly places
[1:45:00] not suggesting we don't have struggles
[1:45:03] and faults and failures but you have
[1:45:05] believed the report you have received
[1:45:08] the word of this hour and the word of
[1:45:10] this hour was not Doctrine or teaching
[1:45:12] it was a person and it's changed your
[1:45:14] life that's how I know it's not Doctrine
[1:45:16] it's changed your life legalism forces
[1:45:19] you to live a certain way

[1:45:24] actually force myself to live this way
[1:45:27] cuz I love it and I don't want to live
[1:45:29] any other way no thanks oh you can go do
[1:45:32] whatever you want I already
[1:45:34] am I already am doing everything I want
[1:45:38] I love him he first loved me something
[1:45:41] came into my life and made that change
[1:45:44] friends what was it the fire that fell
[1:45:46] on
[1:45:48] Pentacles no l among on you just the
[1:45:51] word only seated in Heavenly places in
[1:45:55] the door where he puts his name Christ

[1:46:05] brings the entire fullness of the
[1:46:08] godhead bodily among you couldn't do it
[1:46:12] in Luther's age couldn't do it in
[1:46:14] Wesley's age couldn't do it in
[1:46:17] Pentecostal age but in the day when the
[1:46:20] Sun of man will be manifested revealed
[1:46:22] brought back the church together with
[1:46:25] the entire deity of God amongst his
[1:46:28] people showing the same visible
[1:46:32] signs lastly manifesting himself like he
[1:46:36] did at the beginning when he manifested
[1:46:39] on Earth in the form of a prophet God Oh
[1:46:42] Glory promised by Malachi 4 promised by
[1:46:46] the rest of the scriptures when you
[1:46:48] where you worship at the House of God
[1:46:51] seated in present tense amen that's it

[1:47:25] fire that fell in the upper room in
[1:47:28] every detail of scripture I have the
[1:47:32] right to say to the Lord Lord I want to
[1:47:35] come to verse 42 like they came to verse
[1:47:38] 42 and they continued steadfastly in the
[1:47:42] apostles Doctrine and the fellowship and
[1:47:45] the breaking of
[1:47:47] bread I say Lord bring the fire on Amen
