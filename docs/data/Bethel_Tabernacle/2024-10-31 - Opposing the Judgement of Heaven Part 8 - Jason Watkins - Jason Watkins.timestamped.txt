[43:46] here amen God bless you let's pray let's
[43:48] pray father we thank you for your word
[43:51] tonight and Lord I'm just I I all day
[43:55] I've thought about Lord the verses and
[43:58] and you woke me up very early Lord
[44:01] thinking about this verse it came on my
[44:04] mind and I wondered how it would fit oh
[44:08] my what a wonderful way the Holy Spirit
[44:10] has weaved it into this thought so now
[44:13] I'm giving it into your complete control
[44:15] because it came from you anyway Lord all
[44:18] good things come down from above from
[44:20] the Father of Lights in whom is no
[44:22] Shadow no variableness no shadow of
[44:25] turning he's always consistently the
[44:28] same yesterday today and forever he's
[44:30] always good he's always full of love and
[44:33] always full of compassion so father it's
[44:36] your desire to help us may we desire to
[44:39] be helped tonight I commit it to you in
[44:42] Jesus name amen God bless you friends
[44:44] you can be
[44:49] seated now in a moment I'm going to have
[44:52] the um Brothers take take us to two
[44:56] connecting verses or two connecting
[44:59] places in the New Testament but before I
[45:01] do I want you to think about the
[45:05] Commandment here uh in verse two as
[45:09] newborn babes desire the sincere milk
[45:12] the the sincere milk of the word that
[45:15] you may grow thereby so babies grow on
[45:20] milk all through the animal kingdom uh
[45:23] babies grow and and milk from the mother
[45:27] or you know milk even that Ma that is
[45:30] man-made in formula and different things
[45:32] like that those help the baby to grow
[45:35] it's not just given them that because
[45:37] maybe they like it a lot of times they
[45:39] don't like it but especially if it's
[45:41] man-made but God uses that to help us
[45:45] grow spiritually so I would say that
[45:48] tonight it's something to be desired oh
[45:50] yeah would you agree but now I want you
[45:53] to notice that it is the precursor to
[45:56] verse two is verse one that you need to
[45:59] lay aside all malice and all guile and
[46:01] all hypocrisies and all envies and all
[46:03] evil speakings so I would I would say
[46:06] that if that
[46:08] precedes uh getting milk to grow then it
[46:13] precedes that because those are the
[46:15] effective things that would stop you
[46:17] from growing amen amen is that fair see
[46:21] if so be that ye have tasted that the
[46:24] Lord is gracious now I want to show you
[46:26] something in 1 Corinthians chapter 3
[46:29] we're going to catch these first three
[46:30] verses 1 Corinthians 3
[46:32] 1:3 and I Brethren now this is Paul our
[46:36] first one was Simon Peter this is St
[46:37] Paul and I Brethren could not speak unto
[46:41] you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal
[46:46] even as unto babes in Christ I have fed
[46:49] you with milk and not with meat for
[46:51] hither to ye were not able to Bear it
[46:54] neither yet now are you able
[46:57] for ye are yet carnal for whereas there
[47:01] is among you envying and strife and
[47:03] divisions are you not carnal and walk as
[47:06] men so now Paul is agreeing with Peter
[47:11] to say things like envying and things
[47:13] like strife and things like divisions or
[47:16] as Peter said things like malice and
[47:18] things like guile things like hypocrisy
[47:21] things like evil speakings these things
[47:24] will prevent you not only of the growth
[47:28] you need as a babe in Christ but they
[47:30] will they are an effective hindrance to
[47:33] you moving on in Christ amen see and so
[47:36] Paul is not contradicting Simon Peter
[47:40] but I think that the key to it because
[47:42] it almost sounds like Peter is saying
[47:45] hey you should desire the sincere milk
[47:49] and Paul is saying goodness gracious you
[47:51] guys it seem like all I can do is give
[47:53] you sincere milk yeah and it's almost
[47:56] like like wait a minute Peter kind of
[47:58] thought it was a good thing Paul you
[47:59] sound upset Paul is trying to get you to
[48:03] understand that you're not supposed to
[48:04] stay back there as babes in Christ the
[48:07] whole design of the Gospel is to mature
[48:09] you and move you on higher into into the
[48:13] things of God listen we're trying to get
[48:16] to brother brandham said not a faith he
[48:19] said you've had that he said I'm trying
[48:21] to get you to see perfect Faith amen
[48:25] amen good to have brother George sister
[48:27] Dorothy here also I see them sitting
[48:28] there glad to have them and so we're
[48:31] going to look then at Hebrews 5 and I
[48:33] think we're going to see the key to all
[48:35] of this Hebrews 5:12 is this all right I
[48:39] want to I'm I'm determined to take um
[48:42] the this first part of the sermon I've
[48:44] desired to take this part to deal with
[48:47] nuts and bolts of perfect Faith to
[48:50] really get us to understand we've talked
[48:52] a lot about what it is we've talked a
[48:54] lot about you know that you can't
[48:57] something you can't go get what you have
[48:59] to do is prepare yourself to receive am
[49:02] have we said that over and over again
[49:04] we've showed you that it's a very
[49:06] ancient power it's not something brand
[49:08] new and Paul is actually trying to get
[49:11] that early church up to that level and
[49:13] he's saying I really need to move on
[49:16] into deeper things because we're we
[49:19] we're looking for the coming of the Lord
[49:20] and you need to get ready for a Rapture
[49:23] see but but if you're just if you if
[49:25] you've got all of this ality among you
[49:28] we we've got a problem see now watch
[49:31] Hebrews 5:12 to14 for when the time you
[49:35] ought to be teachers you have need that
[49:38] one teach you again which be the first
[49:41] principles of the Oracles of God the
[49:44] milk the first principles of the Oracles
[49:48] of God this is the milk you feed newborn
[49:50] babes in
[49:52] Christ when you should be you know uh
[49:55] when you should be teachers by now you
[49:58] have need that one teach you again it's
[50:00] almost like we got to go back again and
[50:02] learn the basic fundamentals about what
[50:04] it means to be a Christian yeah see to
[50:07] be a Christian means you got a new life
[50:11] and there's no need trying to press on
[50:13] in deeper Revelations of God if you
[50:16] don't have your
[50:17] ABCs they said brother Brandon why don't
[50:19] you teach them great spiritual gifts
[50:21] brother brandom says how can I teach
[50:23] them great spiritual gifts if they won't
[50:25] learn their ABC
[50:28] see so he says you are become such as
[50:31] have need of milk and not strong meat
[50:34] now it's I I almost inverted these
[50:38] verses just for clarity's sake sometimes
[50:41] I will do that because Paul writes in a
[50:43] very abstract way and sometimes it's
[50:45] hard to grasp his meaning even Peter
[50:47] admits that but but here's what I want
[50:50] you to see now in this next verse
[50:52] because Paul is about to give you a
[50:55] principle
[50:57] all right and what he's just said is a
[51:02] complaint that you're you're not moving
[51:05] on in this principle what's the
[51:07] principle Paul everyone that useth milk
[51:10] is unskillful in the word of
[51:13] righteousness for he is a babe but
[51:16] strong meat belongeth to them that are
[51:19] of full age even to those who by reason
[51:22] of use have their senses exercised to
[51:26] discern both good and evil now you're
[51:28] becoming a mature child of God now
[51:31] you're you're understanding the deeper
[51:33] things of God now you're moving on
[51:35] beyond the fundamentals of Faith see and
[51:39] and and so what's interesting that we
[51:42] didn't read go back up uh brother Caleb
[51:45] I didn't I'm sorry to jump you I didn't
[51:46] give you this one but back up to verse
[51:48] seven Hebrews
[51:50] 5:7 because I want you to look what he's
[51:52] trying to teach them he's trying to show
[51:55] them watch this who in the days of his
[51:57] flesh this is Jesus when he had offered
[51:59] up prayers and supplications with strong
[52:02] crying and tears unto him that was able
[52:04] to save him from death and was Hur in
[52:07] that he feared now wait hold it he's
[52:09] talking about Jesus in his human
[52:11] Incarnation yeah that he was a a man
[52:14] like we were he was a human being that
[52:16] was that had fears and that didn't want
[52:18] to die and that had a will that he
[52:20] wanted to live and had to come and
[52:22] surrender that will just like you do he
[52:26] was sh showing us the way a lot of times
[52:28] when we just deal with his divinity we
[52:31] just say oh my he's the Divine God he's
[52:33] Flawless and perfect and all of that
[52:35] stuff is true but he was a man who had
[52:38] to learn obedience by the things he
[52:42] suffered amen am I quoting scripture yes
[52:46] see and so Paul is so
[52:50] now why is Paul talking about his
[52:54] Humanity because he's talking to humans
[52:57] and he's trying to get the people to
[52:58] understand now watch and he cried with
[53:01] tears unto him that was able to save him
[53:03] from death and was heard in that he
[53:04] feared now look at verse eight though he
[53:06] were a son yet learned he obedience by
[53:10] the things which he suffered and being
[53:12] made perfect catch it he became the
[53:16] author of Eternal salvation so you're
[53:18] salvation's something that's Eternal you
[53:20] didn't become a son or daughter of God
[53:22] you cooperated in the vision of God
[53:25] found out you always are a son and
[53:27] daughter of God so it's all about
[53:29] growing into your position see the
[53:32] Eternal salvation unto all them that do
[53:34] what obey him called of God a high
[53:38] priest after the order of MDC so he was
[53:41] trying to show that age who Jesus was as
[53:46] the Eternal Father living in human flesh
[53:50] amen see and and this is so that they
[53:54] could that the the reason that and this
[53:57] is so important to Paul is so that when
[54:01] you can understand how the Eternal
[54:04] Father lived as a human being he and and
[54:08] in that human being the Son of God had a
[54:10] Flawless perfect Faith
[54:13] relationship with the spirit of God as a
[54:16] man he's trying to show you this is how
[54:19] you do it this means you're also
[54:22] assigned to be a son and daughter of God
[54:25] a continu ation of that same Ministry
[54:28] and you're going to need to do it just
[54:30] like he did
[54:31] it you're going to have to learn
[54:34] obedience see amen so he's trying to get
[54:38] them to see where perfect faith lies and
[54:42] perfect faith lies in a revelation of
[54:44] Jesus Christ in you and the revelation
[54:48] of not just who he was but who you are
[54:52] making you a continuation of the Lord's
[54:56] min
[54:57] Ministry amen you understand why perfect
[55:00] faith is so important you weren't
[55:02] supposed to just have merely a faith in
[55:06] the Son of God the the design of the
[55:09] scripture is that you would have the
[55:13] faith of the Son of God see amen so this
[55:18] is what we need to understand today so
[55:20] so this is why brother Brandon would
[55:23] come and he would preach how can I
[55:25] overcome and then he would follow that
[55:28] evening with perfect faith and say now
[55:30] you've had a faith but I'm trying to get
[55:32] you to understand a perfect Faith Paul
[55:35] this is what Paul is doing this is what
[55:37] Peter is doing there there is a sincere
[55:39] milk and that's how you're a babe and
[55:42] that's how you get started but the
[55:44] problem is you're supposed to move on
[55:46] into perfect Faith you've had a faith
[55:48] but it's Rapture
[55:50] time this is time for the church to
[55:52] recognize who she is and I'm going to
[55:54] tell you I'm trying to tell you M kzdc
[55:57] but the problem is I can't get it across
[56:00] to you because you're still like a
[56:02] babe oh why am I still like a babe I've
[56:05] been a Christian all these years because
[56:07] you never did Away With Envy and strife
[56:09] and Malice and evil speaking you see and
[56:12] this is why perfect faith is preceded by
[56:15] how can I
[56:17] overcome amen so working perfect faith
[56:21] has never been up to
[56:23] you yours was always a surrendered
[56:27] life and it was always God's prerogative
[56:31] to operate perfect faith in you not you
[56:34] deciding who what where when and how
[56:37] even Jesus didn't do
[56:40] that he said I only do that which I see
[56:44] the father
[56:46] doing brother brandham admits in the
[56:49] early part of his ministry that he
[56:52] really you know he these aren't his
[56:54] words but he talks about how that he
[56:56] made mistakes now no that is his word he
[56:58] talks about making mistakes that's a
[57:00] direct word he
[57:01] uses and the and and the effect of his
[57:04] mistake is is that he's not doing it
[57:06] like Jesus did it he said you know
[57:09] everybody that came through the prayer
[57:10] line he said I just knew the strength of
[57:13] that promise that if you get him to
[57:15] believe nothing will stand in front of
[57:16] your prayers not even cancer and brother
[57:19] brandom said I knew the strength of that
[57:21] and so he would he wouldn't let anybody
[57:23] pass by him and remain sick he was
[57:25] healing get make making sure he'd stop
[57:26] the line if a devil got resistant he'd
[57:29] stop the line and sometimes these lines
[57:32] extended city
[57:36] blocks it was the only Ministry that had
[57:38] that kind of an effect in the world and
[57:41] so he's sometimes he would camp out at
[57:44] the pull pit for several days and he'd
[57:47] pray for people and get tired and he'd
[57:50] eat a sandwich and drink some milk and
[57:51] sit down at the pull pit and lean back
[57:53] and con out and take a little power nap
[57:55] while everybody just stood there waiting
[57:56] for the prophet to get some rest he wake
[57:58] back up and start the prayer line again
[58:00] we're talking about a Ministry that
[58:02] emptied hospitals yes amen amen where
[58:05] the doctors and nurses were reported in
[58:07] the news that they couldn't keep the
[58:09] patients in the bed because the people
[58:11] were streaming running to get to these
[58:13] meetings oh this wasn't done in a corner
[58:16] friends God did something great for us
[58:18] in this
[58:19] hour it's beyond it's beyond reproach
[58:21] it's beyond question questions are
[58:23] ridiculous see and so so so we find that
[58:28] that he that he was stopping and healing
[58:31] everybody and the angel of the Lord took
[58:32] him aside brother Brandon tells it's on
[58:34] tape and he said he pointed out to me
[58:37] that you are doing something that even
[58:39] Jesus didn't do in his Earthly Ministry
[58:42] he said I only do that which I see the
[58:44] father he come he gives the example he
[58:46] comes to the pool of Betha he steps over
[58:49] the top of sick people yeah and goes to
[58:51] one man who's not even really all that
[58:53] sick and heals him says would you be
[58:55] made whole yes okay he's healed and he
[58:57] walks right back out and steps back over
[58:59] sick people and leaves and heals one
[59:02] person amen who's not even the worst
[59:04] case and when they questioned him he
[59:06] just said I only operate by Vision I
[59:07] only do what I the father shows me to do
[59:10] and brother brandham says I made up my
[59:12] mind right then and there that I would
[59:14] pray for everybody but I'm going to let
[59:17] Jesus decide who he's going to
[59:19] heal see because Jesus is the one who
[59:22] knows who really has got a clean heart
[59:26] who really has real Faith who isn't just
[59:28] taking advantage of a gift see and and
[59:32] that you believe me you're going to want
[59:33] to let Jesus operate perfect faith in
[59:36] you you're not because it's superp
[59:38] powerful it can create whole worlds
[59:40] you're not going to want to this is not
[59:42] something you're going to want to try to
[59:43] manipulate all kinds of charlatans have
[59:46] tried to do that I'm glad for a humble
[59:49] Prophet who said it's not me it's him
[59:51] I'm I'm as helpless as a baby until he
[59:54] comes Hallelujah friends and and that
[59:56] needs to be our attitude I'm not
[59:58] anything but he's everything my whole my
[1:00:01] whole existence is just humility before
[1:00:04] God and get rid of envy and strife and
[1:00:06] Malice and backbiting and talking and
[1:00:08] whispering and all the get rid of
[1:00:10] carnality out of my life because this is
[1:00:13] the age when God wants to operate
[1:00:16] perfect
[1:00:18] Faith Amen brother Joe good to see you
[1:00:20] man you should come over here and take
[1:00:21] my notes and carry on
[1:00:23] [Laughter]
[1:00:26] God Amen praise the Lord amen I I came
[1:00:30] from churches in North Carolina where
[1:00:31] they would do this that Minister walk in
[1:00:33] the back come on up here brother I'm
[1:00:34] right here just pick it up right here
[1:00:36] that's a true story and okay I got it go
[1:00:39] sit down and way he would go that was
[1:00:43] not
[1:00:44] uncommon that's really what's called
[1:00:46] preferring your
[1:00:49] brother amen okay brother Joe is going
[1:00:51] to prefer me praise the Lord so we're
[1:00:54] just we're we're covering perfect faith
[1:00:56] Joe so so we find then that that those
[1:01:00] things that Paul is not contradicting
[1:01:03] Simon Paul is not Simon Peter is saying
[1:01:06] the sincere milk is a great thing Paul's
[1:01:07] not saying no he's wrong it's a terrible
[1:01:09] thing Paul is simply trying to show the
[1:01:12] people that you never you're here you
[1:01:15] are trying to have advancement you're
[1:01:18] trying to operate amazing gifts and
[1:01:20] amazing power and do you not know that
[1:01:23] God is never going to let that work like
[1:01:26] that he he will not allow P power apart
[1:01:29] from character see he's too good of a
[1:01:32] heavenly father to do that he's not
[1:01:35] going to give you supreme power because
[1:01:37] you can't keep it under perfect control
[1:01:40] see because you still haven't learned
[1:01:42] the fundamentals of what it means to be
[1:01:44] a Christian the whole world of
[1:01:46] Christianity has gone after that they
[1:01:48] don't even care how they live they just
[1:01:50] want to operate gifts and and jingle and
[1:01:53] songs and and and and and you know and
[1:01:56] all of the nonsense that goes on in
[1:01:58] their meetings I want the sincere milk
[1:02:00] of God's word I want it to make my heart
[1:02:03] like his heart so that then I can
[1:02:05] understand about who mzc was and if I
[1:02:08] understand who he was then I can
[1:02:09] understand who I am and if I can
[1:02:11] understand the ministry of Jesus to the
[1:02:12] father I can understand my Ministry to
[1:02:15] the father
[1:02:17] see so it's the mind of Christ we found
[1:02:20] that the mind of Christ is Flowing is is
[1:02:25] the perfect faith is the mind of Christ
[1:02:27] I've said this a dozen times I'm going
[1:02:29] to say it again tonight on this maybe
[1:02:31] this last part of the series The M
[1:02:33] perfect faith is the mind of Christ
[1:02:36] flowing through you unhindered amen
[1:02:42] unobstructed why because you've cast
[1:02:44] down vain
[1:02:45] imaginations you've cleaned up your life
[1:02:48] from carnality and sin you and and and
[1:02:51] I'm going to go down I'm going to go
[1:02:52] down the list here tonight because the
[1:02:54] application of perfect faith what is it
[1:02:56] it's the mind of Christ flowing through
[1:02:58] you unhindered and unobstructed how do
[1:03:01] you get it you can't get it you can only
[1:03:03] prepare yourself to receive it you
[1:03:05] become a a a a a receptor you become a a
[1:03:09] clean vessel that God can say God can
[1:03:12] work through me it's more than that yeah
[1:03:15] God can trust
[1:03:18] youen that means so much to me yeah I
[1:03:21] don't care about operating speaking
[1:03:24] storms out of existence and squirrels
[1:03:26] into existence if that's what he wants
[1:03:27] me to do fine but I want to know he
[1:03:30] trusts me I want to know that if he
[1:03:33] never tells me to speak a squirrel into
[1:03:35] existence he can look and say there's a
[1:03:37] young man I trust Hallelujah that's what
[1:03:40] I want in my life friends I don't want
[1:03:43] to pass the sincere milk and try to rush
[1:03:45] on into great things to get me into a
[1:03:48] body change that'll you'll never operate
[1:03:50] perfect Faith like that
[1:03:53] see brother brandham dealt with it so
[1:03:55] much and and I I I actually had a ton of
[1:04:00] quotes from the message perfect faith I
[1:04:02] had them all laid out and I decided I
[1:04:04] just I wanted to read them I was going
[1:04:06] to put them on the overhead but then I
[1:04:07] thought to myself you know I'm just
[1:04:09] going to tell you go listen to that
[1:04:13] message amen and if you started
[1:04:15] listening to it when I preached part one
[1:04:17] go back and listen to it again but start
[1:04:19] with the Sunday morning sermon how can I
[1:04:23] overcome amen because when you you when
[1:04:26] you see what that entire Sunday was
[1:04:29] about it's how can I overcome all fear
[1:04:33] and doubt to operate perfect Faith
[1:04:37] that's what that whole Sunday was
[1:04:39] dedicated to in that message of perfect
[1:04:43] faith brother brandham one of the here's
[1:04:45] a just a a few things that he so
[1:04:48] stressed and one of them because that
[1:04:51] the strength of Jesus was that two
[1:04:54] things he recognized who he was amen now
[1:04:58] brother brandom says that again in
[1:05:00] Israelite worthy of the Gospel remember
[1:05:02] that he says Jesus knew his words
[1:05:04] couldn't fail because he knew who he was
[1:05:06] see so he recognized his position as a
[1:05:10] Believer and that's what you've got to
[1:05:11] do the second thing Jesus had is he had
[1:05:14] no condemnation in his heart and he said
[1:05:17] Satan cometh but he findeth nothing in
[1:05:20] me yeah he hath nothing in me different
[1:05:23] translations say it different ways the
[1:05:26] basic meaning is that he's got nothing
[1:05:28] he can accuse me of he's got nothing he
[1:05:31] can point his bony finger at I do always
[1:05:35] that which pleased the father Hallelujah
[1:05:38] see you say well then brother Jason I'm
[1:05:40] just out cuz I I never can hardly get
[1:05:43] through 24 hours doing that but that's
[1:05:46] why Jesus had to die that's why we have
[1:05:49] a propitiation for our sins I'm here to
[1:05:52] tell you something friends you're not
[1:05:54] perfect but he is but that Perfection
[1:05:57] should re should Rule and reign in your
[1:05:59] life and you should say Lord God help me
[1:06:01] to overcome every obstacle help me to
[1:06:04] empty myself of every carnality help me
[1:06:06] to move
[1:06:09] forward
[1:06:10] see Jesus doesn't need you to re to do
[1:06:14] exactly what he did he was a perfect
[1:06:16] sacrifice on the cross he's not asking
[1:06:18] you to go die on the cross as a perfect
[1:06:20] lamb he was that for you but his his
[1:06:24] desire is that let me live inside you
[1:06:28] let me live my life through you cast
[1:06:30] down anything that's contrary to my word
[1:06:33] don't have that in your life see so it's
[1:06:37] all about acknowledging our identity as
[1:06:39] a Believer and and understanding that
[1:06:43] the that the blessing is is is is for
[1:06:46] you brother brandom goes that over that
[1:06:49] over again and again it's one of the
[1:06:50] very first things he wants to cover
[1:06:52] you've got to know who you are and
[1:06:54] believe it amen amen and then he goes
[1:06:58] back to the example of Jesus that's what
[1:06:59] he did see and so Jesus recognized his
[1:07:03] position as a Son of God and you've got
[1:07:06] to recognize your position as a child of
[1:07:08] God I'm want to say it like this you've
[1:07:11] got to recognize yourself say well as a
[1:07:14] child of God like he was a child of God
[1:07:16] I'm G give it to you a little bit
[1:07:17] stronger you got to recognize yourself
[1:07:20] as his brother amen from the same Daddy
[1:07:24] yeah amen in the same family that's
[1:07:27] right in the same seed line in the same
[1:07:29] Jean Pool are you getting it he's the
[1:07:32] firstborn among
[1:07:35] many Brethren
[1:07:38] see and so he was the first born and so
[1:07:41] you are now you the the the the the
[1:07:44] beauty of the of the message of the hour
[1:07:47] was to come at the end time to take the
[1:07:52] the the true bride of Christ call her
[1:07:54] out of a fallen church and prove to her
[1:07:57] who she is and prove to her and this is
[1:08:01] strong I hope you I hope you're ready
[1:08:03] for strong meat to prove to her that she
[1:08:07] is now the vessel of the word made
[1:08:11] flesh that's what a prophet taught us he
[1:08:14] was the word made flesh now you're the
[1:08:16] word made flesh that was his turn now
[1:08:18] it's your turn Hallelujah
[1:08:22] see and and and and that's and brother
[1:08:24] Brenham emphasize that over and over
[1:08:27] again go back and hear perfect Faith
[1:08:29] again you've got to realize that's your
[1:08:32] position in order to operate perfect
[1:08:35] Faith because we're not just talking
[1:08:37] about a faith we're talking about a
[1:08:39] faith that's going to raise and
[1:08:41] Resurrect The Sleeping Saints for
[1:08:43] hundreds of years and change you at the
[1:08:47] molecular level I'm here to tell you
[1:08:49] that's going to take some perfect Faith
[1:08:51] that's going to take a people who are
[1:08:54] trained how to get themselves out of the
[1:08:57] way yeah amen can't do it with
[1:09:00] condemnation in your life that's the
[1:09:02] next thing brother brandom covered if
[1:09:03] you're living in sin if you're not only
[1:09:06] if you're living in sin because if
[1:09:07] you're living in sin you're harboring
[1:09:08] guilt yeah right and you'll never you
[1:09:13] you can't even operate standard faith if
[1:09:16] you're harboring guilt amen I'm here to
[1:09:18] tell you something friends let me say
[1:09:19] tonight because I believe I'm speaking
[1:09:21] to a group of Believers and if you are a
[1:09:24] Believer and you have PL yourself in the
[1:09:26] blood of the Lamb of God and you have
[1:09:28] committed your whole life to the Lord
[1:09:30] Jesus Christ you have no guilt Let It Go
[1:09:35] Let It Go Let It Go refuse to accept
[1:09:39] guilt because you have believed on him
[1:09:42] whom God ha
[1:09:44] sent Hallelujah and there's a bleeding
[1:09:47] sacrifice for you Satan cometh but he
[1:09:49] findeth nothing in me I got all kinds of
[1:09:53] weaknesses but my faith in him is
[1:09:57] perfect
[1:09:59] Hallelujah see so you can't be harboring
[1:10:03] guil you you you you you you if you do
[1:10:06] that you're never going to be a conduit
[1:10:07] for perfect Faith it's always going to
[1:10:09] be short circuited and you're going to
[1:10:11] be the short circuit yeah see and let me
[1:10:14] just
[1:10:16] say hey
[1:10:18] dads hey moms your children really need
[1:10:22] you to not be the short circuit amen
[1:10:26] amen amen I'm aware of that as a
[1:10:30] Shepherd this church needs me to not be
[1:10:32] the short circuit it's well I'm tell you
[1:10:35] something friends we got to cast down
[1:10:36] all vain imaginations we got to get rid
[1:10:38] of strife we got to get rid of Envy we
[1:10:40] got to get rid of evil speaking we got
[1:10:42] to get rid of carnality we got to get
[1:10:44] rid of guilt out of our life we're going
[1:10:46] home we're so close now Hallelujah and
[1:10:50] the world is so crazy you've got to
[1:10:53] embrace the entirety of God's word
[1:10:55] you've got to accept and believe every
[1:10:57] word of God in this day you can't
[1:11:00] whatever you do don't pick and
[1:11:05] choose you'll you'll you just might as
[1:11:07] well hang up your Spurs if you're going
[1:11:09] to pick and choose you'll never ride
[1:11:12] that this hor you'll never ride this
[1:11:14] Trail again see if you're going to pick
[1:11:17] and choose what to believe you're never
[1:11:20] going to ride this Trail again I'm here
[1:11:21] to tell you something friends I'm
[1:11:23] marching to Zion I'm not here to pick
[1:11:26] and choose it doesn't matter whether I
[1:11:28] like it or even understand it or even
[1:11:29] can figure it all out I just know it's
[1:11:31] true and I just say Y and amen and I
[1:11:34] just say Lord whatever it takes make my
[1:11:36] life look like that word hallelujah
[1:11:39] that's the recipe for perfect Faith
[1:11:42] friends we walk in faith we walk in love
[1:11:46] you you you you and you can't do that if
[1:11:48] you're walking in deceit right see so
[1:11:52] these are the things I mean come on
[1:11:54] could you do that in a
[1:11:56] marriage could you walk in love if
[1:11:58] you're walking in deceit in your
[1:12:00] marriage there's no way see so we walk
[1:12:05] in faith we walk in love we walk in
[1:12:08] Grace we here's another thing that
[1:12:10] brother brandham emphasized over and
[1:12:12] over I I I almost feel like I wish I
[1:12:15] would have kept the quotes but then the
[1:12:16] other side of me says No tell them to go
[1:12:19] hear the message go back and read it
[1:12:21] again because here is a big one this is
[1:12:24] a this might this might be as big as
[1:12:27] brother brandham starting out with the
[1:12:29] fundamentals of knowing who you are and
[1:12:32] you only know who you are because you
[1:12:33] know who he is and you understand that
[1:12:35] he is his word and you understand that
[1:12:37] you love it and you're eating on it
[1:12:38] therefore you are
[1:12:39] it and second only to that is that you
[1:12:44] have to resist fear and doubt
[1:12:47] amen you've got to get rid of it friends
[1:12:50] fear is such an effective block of God's
[1:12:53] promises in your life
[1:12:57] amen I thought Lord how can I say that
[1:13:01] so plain and that's what I wrote Fear is
[1:13:05] such an effective
[1:13:08] block it is so effective it will keep
[1:13:12] you from realizing any promise of God
[1:13:16] Amen if you let fear and doubt because
[1:13:20] of the circumstance or but you say well
[1:13:23] but i' I've got guilt with then get rid
[1:13:25] of
[1:13:26] it well but i' I've got this carnality
[1:13:29] well then get rid of it so well I got a
[1:13:32] problem then stop get rid of the problem
[1:13:36] see like they say don't do
[1:13:39] that amen oh friends when when when fear
[1:13:44] Rises brother I brother brandham talks
[1:13:46] about complexes and he said the only way
[1:13:48] to defeat a complex fortunately the only
[1:13:51] way happens to be the best way so I'm
[1:13:52] glad it's if you say we only got one way
[1:13:55] yeah but it happens to be the best take
[1:13:56] the opposite amen
[1:14:00] take take the opposite amen it listen if
[1:14:05] if you've got something you're offering
[1:14:07] me that I'd like to have it's no good if
[1:14:09] unless I take
[1:14:10] it and and and and if you're holding
[1:14:13] something of mine that belongs to me and
[1:14:15] you won't give it to me I'm taking it
[1:14:18] and the devil would love to hold back
[1:14:20] the promises of God but brother brandham
[1:14:23] shows how Jesus took all of his weapons
[1:14:26] and the only weapon he has if he can get
[1:14:28] you to doubt your weapon I'm not
[1:14:30] doubting anymore my weapons I'm going to
[1:14:33] claim the promise of God and I'm going
[1:14:35] to change my confession to reflect my
[1:14:40] faith see you're walking conundrum if
[1:14:42] your if your confession doesn't match
[1:14:44] your your your faith you're you're
[1:14:47] trying to you're you're basically living
[1:14:49] a lie I just say this when fear arises
[1:14:52] take the opposite say what's the
[1:14:54] opposite of of fear uh take the take the
[1:14:58] opposite by replacing that fear with
[1:15:00] faith amen well how do I even do that
[1:15:04] well it starts right here yes amen of
[1:15:08] the abundance of the heart doth the
[1:15:10] mouth Speak oh yeah amen amen Amen
[1:15:14] brother Joe and I were fellowshipping on
[1:15:16] that the other day brother Joe sent me
[1:15:18] an article I haven't gotten to read it
[1:15:20] yet brother Joe but I was testifying to
[1:15:22] some of the brothers here just a couple
[1:15:24] of the ministers the other day
[1:15:26] and and it's it's done by Richard
[1:15:28] Dawkins who's the famous atheist and
[1:15:31] he's actually talking about you know DNA
[1:15:33] and genes your genes human genes and he
[1:15:36] says it's amazing even science knows
[1:15:38] that genes are almost like almost like
[1:15:41] Eternal almost like Immortal and he says
[1:15:44] you know all the way back generation
[1:15:45] after generation and that same
[1:15:47] characteristic of those genes just go
[1:15:49] from generation to generation to
[1:15:51] generation to generation I began to
[1:15:53] realize why it was so important for
[1:15:56] Matthew to to track Jesus through both
[1:15:58] Joseph and Mary although he was not the
[1:16:01] blood of either one of them but but
[1:16:03] humanly speaking he tracked both sides
[1:16:06] of Joseph and Mary all the way back and
[1:16:08] he goes 14 Generations all the way back
[1:16:10] to catches David Goes 14 more all the
[1:16:12] way back to Abraham I mean listen
[1:16:14] friends it was important that the people
[1:16:17] understand this Messiah is going to act
[1:16:20] like he's always acted all the way down
[1:16:22] since Genesis I'm here to tell I didn't
[1:16:25] start here I came from God and I'm going
[1:16:28] to act now like I acted then and
[1:16:31] Hallelujah because it's my privilege to
[1:16:33] act like that see and so I'm going to
[1:16:36] replace fear with
[1:16:38] faith and the reason I'm going to do
[1:16:41] that is because I can
[1:16:44] yes change your testimony cast down
[1:16:47] negative thoughts cast them down see
[1:16:51] brother brandom there's a quote I didn't
[1:16:53] pull it up tonight I thought about it
[1:16:54] stuck this in my notes in the back
[1:16:56] office there's a quote where I where uh
[1:16:59] brother uh the pastor in in Paris France
[1:17:02] and I was there at the meetings in
[1:17:04] Swansea preaching with him and uh he
[1:17:07] read a quote where brother brandham said
[1:17:09] you should never have a negative thought
[1:17:14] about
[1:17:17] anything don't let negative thoughts be
[1:17:20] in your mind you came from above he's
[1:17:23] the father of life in whom is no
[1:17:27] Shadow we're not here to have a negative
[1:17:30] thought I'm here to say I can do all
[1:17:32] things through Christ who strengthens me
[1:17:36] I don't need the devil's permission to
[1:17:37] get the Holy Ghost I don't need the
[1:17:39] devil's permission I don't need
[1:17:40] anybody's permission to be a Son of God
[1:17:43] I am entitled to be a Son of God I'm
[1:17:46] entitled I don't have to ask permission
[1:17:47] for perfect faith I don't have to beg
[1:17:49] God already has it and wants to operate
[1:17:52] it through me all I got to do is cast
[1:17:54] down imagination cast down carnality out
[1:17:57] of my life I'm already a Son of
[1:18:01] God that that's the part he
[1:18:04] did I'm already Born Again by the Holy
[1:18:07] Ghost that's the part he did I got one
[1:18:10] thing to do just one thing to do believe
[1:18:14] it and confess it and walk forward
[1:18:19] hallelujah oh my surely we can do our
[1:18:22] one thing friends got to act on your
[1:18:25] belief you believe
[1:18:26] it CU perfect Faith's not passive I said
[1:18:29] that to you very early on it's not
[1:18:31] passive it's perfect Faith compels
[1:18:33] action I I I was so inspired some weeks
[1:18:37] ago brother Caleb was preaching uh I
[1:18:39] think it was a Sunday school class I
[1:18:40] don't remember might have been on
[1:18:41] Wednesday night and he was talking about
[1:18:43] there that when you know when at the at
[1:18:46] the well when Rebecca comes out and
[1:18:49] there's eler and Rebecca didn't even
[1:18:52] realize there was there was an unseen
[1:18:55] realm in a world she couldn't see Angels
[1:18:59] moving and interdicting and she thought
[1:19:01] I'm just going to go out but it just so
[1:19:02] happened she went out at just the right
[1:19:04] time and it just so happened that she
[1:19:06] said the very words he had prayed and it
[1:19:08] just so happened that she she she was
[1:19:10] willing to be everything that that
[1:19:13] Abraham was looking for in a bride for
[1:19:15] his son I'm here to tell you something
[1:19:17] friends I I don't let the devil put you
[1:19:20] down you're everything that God is
[1:19:22] looking for in a to have a pred for his
[1:19:26] son if if that wasn't true he wouldn't
[1:19:29] have sent the message to
[1:19:31] you and and there's the point brother
[1:19:34] Caleb was making that Rebecca didn't
[1:19:35] even understand she was compelled to go
[1:19:39] out there some hidden Force compelled
[1:19:42] her it compelled her to walk up it
[1:19:45] compelled her to speak to him she was
[1:19:48] compelled she couldn't not do it and I'm
[1:19:50] here to tell you it's the way I want to
[1:19:52] be I want to say Lord God let there
[1:19:54] nothing in me I want to be compelled by
[1:19:57] the Living God I want it to move through
[1:20:00] my
[1:20:01] life see so when you have perfect Faith
[1:20:05] you act on it see you act on what you
[1:20:08] believe it's not it's not confident
[1:20:13] that that in yourself that you can do
[1:20:15] anything but you're perfectly satisfied
[1:20:19] that God will work through you
[1:20:21] amen perfect Faith isn't a pepper
[1:20:26] perfect Faith isn't me walking up to an
[1:20:28] immovable Mountain that I really need
[1:20:30] out of my way something going on in my
[1:20:33] home or my children or my family or my
[1:20:34] life or my body or my finances or
[1:20:36] whatever it is it isn't me going oh I'll
[1:20:39] tell you what bless God I'm I'm gonna
[1:20:41] take that Devil by the horns it has
[1:20:43] nothing to do with that Jesus never said
[1:20:45] bless God I'm gonna take that Devil by
[1:20:47] the
[1:20:48] horns Jesus just spoke brother Brown
[1:20:51] said he knew his words couldn't fail he
[1:20:54] knew who he was he said he never
[1:20:56] screamed at Devils he didn't have to
[1:20:59] said he just spoke come out of him see
[1:21:02] and and and and and so so we find then
[1:21:05] that it's not about me having some
[1:21:07] confidence I can do anything it's not me
[1:21:10] psyching myself
[1:21:13] up you know I might psych myself up if
[1:21:15] I'm a
[1:21:16] weightlifter because I'm G to psych
[1:21:18] myself
[1:21:21] up I'm going to you know you're you're
[1:21:23] psych yourself up to get your Gusto
[1:21:25] going to try to lift this weight you
[1:21:27] don't think you can lift it you're going
[1:21:28] to give it the old the old Notre Dame
[1:21:30] try and you're going to psych yourself
[1:21:31] up that's not what perfect faith is
[1:21:34] perfect faith is not a confidence that I
[1:21:37] can do anything but it is I am perfectly
[1:21:40] satisfied that God is ready to work
[1:21:43] through me amen he just needs me to
[1:21:47] speak it and believe it see so it's
[1:21:50] about taking your position amen that's
[1:21:53] what Joshua need needed you know when
[1:21:56] they were taking Jericho he gave
[1:21:57] everybody their marching orders here's
[1:21:59] where you need to be here's where you
[1:22:01] need to be and and we're going to have
[1:22:03] the singers we're going to have the
[1:22:04] musicians we going to have a worship
[1:22:06] team out in front of you guys the
[1:22:07] worship team's going into battle first
[1:22:09] because they're going to get the people
[1:22:10] ready and boy that's going to blow the
[1:22:13] enemy's mind when they see you
[1:22:15] surrounding Jericho with a bunch of
[1:22:17] singers and musicians amen and what in
[1:22:21] the world is going on we're getting the
[1:22:22] people ready getting the people ready
[1:22:25] we're marching to Zion beautiful
[1:22:27] beautiful Zion and then take your
[1:22:29] position around you and he said now this
[1:22:31] was important everybody take your
[1:22:32] position and stand get ready right there
[1:22:34] that piece of the wall is yours over
[1:22:36] there that's your brothers don't go
[1:22:38] trying to do his here's yours and he
[1:22:40] said when the when the trumpet blast he
[1:22:43] said then here's what I need you do
[1:22:44] everybody just shout hallelujah just
[1:22:47] shout amen just shout so be it
[1:22:50] Hallelujah and when they when the
[1:22:52] trumpet sounded and the people shouted
[1:22:54] earthquake hit the wall fell and and
[1:22:56] Joshua said all right just go up and
[1:22:59] just go forward to the to right to where
[1:23:01] your wall it'll fall in front of you go
[1:23:04] in and and do what you got to do in your
[1:23:06] area I I hope tonight you're hearing the
[1:23:09] voice of our Joshua who is the Holy
[1:23:11] Ghost Hallelujah and he's saying to you
[1:23:14] this is what you need to do Hold Your
[1:23:16] Position in the word of God and March
[1:23:19] forward
[1:23:21] see brother brandham says it like this
[1:23:24] oh my I got to
[1:23:27] hurry so he
[1:23:29] says this is the one quote I I that
[1:23:32] survived my my taking the quotes out
[1:23:35] because I want you to go get them
[1:23:37] yourself this is paragraph 43 if you had
[1:23:41] perfect faith I left this one in here
[1:23:43] because I want to take up a certain
[1:23:45] subject if you had perfect Faith you'd
[1:23:49] look right straight to God and believe
[1:23:51] it and walk away amen you would have no
[1:23:55] need of coming into a prayer line right
[1:23:59] you would have no need of these things
[1:24:02] because your faith has done made it so
[1:24:05] amen
[1:24:06] see so now you know there there's this
[1:24:10] there's this nonsense idea that we
[1:24:12] shouldn't have prayer lines although
[1:24:14] Jesus had them and brother brandham had
[1:24:16] them and it's it's crazy that we're
[1:24:18] having to feel like we got to defend
[1:24:20] something when we're just doing what
[1:24:22] Christ did and doing what a prophet did
[1:24:24] amen but and so he so so I I want to
[1:24:29] break this down for you because this is
[1:24:32] exactly where Peter had
[1:24:35] arrived Peter had got to the point where
[1:24:37] his faith in the words of the Lord was
[1:24:42] his everything here he is on a boat the
[1:24:45] stormy sea it's
[1:24:47] swamping and they're going to they're
[1:24:49] going to they're they're going to die
[1:24:51] and here comes Jesus walking on top of
[1:24:55] H2O amen well that's quite
[1:24:59] impossible but do you still believe
[1:25:02] it come on y'all it's impossible you
[1:25:05] actually believe Jesus was walking on
[1:25:06] top of the water you understand that
[1:25:09] breaks the laws of physics and you still
[1:25:12] believe
[1:25:13] it you guys are strange you believe it
[1:25:18] wow I feel the Holy Spirit going ask him
[1:25:23] again you'll get the same answer every
[1:25:25] time you ask them amen amen you know I
[1:25:29] want to say that when Peter saw
[1:25:33] him and he he cries out Lord if that's
[1:25:37] you then bid me to break the laws of
[1:25:41] physics amen you know it's interesting
[1:25:44] people say see brother brandham says we
[1:25:46] shouldn't have prayer lines we should
[1:25:48] have perfect faith we shouldn't have
[1:25:49] prayer lines and I'm just wondering if
[1:25:52] the people who are complaining about
[1:25:53] that stuff have even dealt with the
[1:25:55] malice that's in their own heart and all
[1:25:57] the nonsense they need to get rid and
[1:25:59] stop criticizing people who are just
[1:26:00] trying to serve God and help other
[1:26:02] people see and then they want to talk
[1:26:04] about perfect faith I doubt they've ever
[1:26:06] operated a day in their life right cuz
[1:26:08] now I know what perfect Faith won't
[1:26:10] operate through and it won't operate
[1:26:11] through that see and so so first of all
[1:26:15] you know when Peter
[1:26:17] arrived his he I mean he didn't have
[1:26:20] time for a prayer line
[1:26:24] so what brother brandham I'm trying to
[1:26:26] make the point here's the point I want
[1:26:27] to make brother brandham is not issuing
[1:26:29] a Prohibition against prayer lines he's
[1:26:33] just simply trying to make a point about
[1:26:34] perfect faith you'll get into a
[1:26:36] situation where you can't even where
[1:26:38] you're not having a prayer line and you
[1:26:40] don't even have the way to have a prayer
[1:26:42] line that's where Peter was he's in a
[1:26:44] boat he don't have a prayer line going
[1:26:46] he don't even have the facility to even
[1:26:48] hold a prayer line he's climbing out of
[1:26:51] a boat onto a Raging Sea to break the
[1:26:54] law of physics how's he going to have a
[1:26:56] prayer line see yeah so it's not about a
[1:27:00] Prohibition on prayer lines and that is
[1:27:02] let me just say with all the love I can
[1:27:04] muster that is such a childish way to
[1:27:07] look at that quote that is such a
[1:27:09] childish way it's just a prayer line as
[1:27:12] I said in our camp it's just an
[1:27:14] organizing tool to help facilitate an
[1:27:16] atmosphere and an expectation and an
[1:27:19] opportunity for for for a person who has
[1:27:22] called on the Elders of the church to
[1:27:24] have an opportunity to have a little bit
[1:27:25] of one-on-one contact amen see that's
[1:27:28] what brother Brandon would do he he was
[1:27:30] a prophet he said I'm he let me talk to
[1:27:32] you I'm contacting your spirit I'm not a
[1:27:34] prophet but that doesn't mean I can't
[1:27:36] stand there and let a brother or sister
[1:27:38] open their heart and say this is what I
[1:27:40] need and then now I got it and the man
[1:27:42] beside me's got it and the man of God
[1:27:44] over here's got it we're going to lay
[1:27:45] hands and now we know what devil we're
[1:27:47] casting out
[1:27:50] see so it's not about a Prohibition it's
[1:27:53] it's you know Satan has been so
[1:27:55] successful in causing a controversy
[1:27:58] where none should exist you know Peter
[1:28:01] you know Peter Peter didn't need a
[1:28:02] prayer line can I say it that way Peter
[1:28:05] didn't need a prayer
[1:28:07] line he didn't need one not only did
[1:28:09] Peter not need a prayer
[1:28:11] line Peter didn't need to be prayed for
[1:28:15] right Peter didn't need to pray
[1:28:19] amen Jesus didn't say uh Peter go pray
[1:28:23] first right
[1:28:24] Jesus didn't say Peter we better call a
[1:28:26] prayer line Peter you better hold up you
[1:28:27] better get down on your knees but you
[1:28:29] know what Jesus has said to him
[1:28:32] come that's it friends Oh my he just
[1:28:35] said come the problem the problem
[1:28:38] developed not with
[1:28:40] Jesus you see there there's a law of
[1:28:42] physics that a human can't walk on top
[1:28:45] of water but Faith
[1:28:48] disregards the laws of nature the
[1:28:51] Heavenly kingdom is not bound by the
[1:28:53] laws of of this
[1:28:55] Earth what happened is Peter began to
[1:28:58] look at the circumstances Jesus never
[1:29:01] changed what he said he just said come
[1:29:03] and Peter started coming he started
[1:29:05] defying the laws of physics until he
[1:29:07] started doing what putting his eyes on
[1:29:09] the circumstances around him and then
[1:29:11] you know what happened he became an
[1:29:14] obstacle to the supernatural powers that
[1:29:16] were bypassing physics and he began to
[1:29:20] sink naturally yeah
[1:29:24] see naturally this the sleeping Saints
[1:29:26] for hundreds of years can't come out of
[1:29:28] the Grave we're not talking about a
[1:29:30] natural event we're talking about a
[1:29:32] supernatural event naturally I can't
[1:29:35] change my body but supernaturally I'm
[1:29:37] going to be changed naturally I can't
[1:29:39] get rid of a sinful nature but
[1:29:41] supernaturally I can
[1:29:44] see so he didn't stop believing in the
[1:29:47] Lord he didn't stop believing the
[1:29:50] word see and and so so he he turned his
[1:29:54] attention to the
[1:29:56] circumstances and uh you know you know
[1:30:00] what you know what happened to
[1:30:02] Peter that I hope don't happen to you
[1:30:05] when you're right in the middle of
[1:30:07] needing to operate perfect Faith you
[1:30:10] know what happened to
[1:30:11] Peter Satan managed to get him to come
[1:30:13] to his
[1:30:15] senses bro you can't walk on water what
[1:30:17] are you
[1:30:19] doing Satan Satan literally got him to
[1:30:21] come to his senses the laws of physics
[1:30:24] this won't support a human being you see
[1:30:26] it proves that Peter was beyond his
[1:30:29] human senses amen Peter was faith in the
[1:30:33] word of God Jesus said come and he he
[1:30:36] didn't wait for a prayer line he didn't
[1:30:38] wait to go pray he didn't need anyone to
[1:30:41] pray for him he just stepped out of the
[1:30:43] boat if you're if you're on a Raging Sea
[1:30:45] like that yeah and you ain't got time
[1:30:47] for a prayer line then don't have one
[1:30:49] good news brother brandham said perfect
[1:30:51] Faith won't even need one amen
[1:30:53] hallelujah
[1:30:54] Hallelujah friends that's what I'm
[1:30:56] looking for I'm looking for perfect
[1:30:58] Faith where we have a prayer line if we
[1:31:00] need it but I don't have one if I don't
[1:31:01] need it Hallelujah there someday some
[1:31:04] glorious day we're not going to need a
[1:31:05] prayer line we're not going to need
[1:31:07] prayer we're not going to need any kind
[1:31:08] of thing like that the redeemed of the
[1:31:11] Lord are going to inherit the
[1:31:13] earth oh my see so so Peter effectively
[1:31:18] hindered that Supernatural flow that's
[1:31:21] what happened see Jesus
[1:31:24] after that event Jesus still held prayer
[1:31:26] lines and Peter helped him in them
[1:31:29] brother B called him campaigns and Jesus
[1:31:32] praying for the sick see so so it's not
[1:31:36] about that there's this you know there
[1:31:38] there there's an ever increasing
[1:31:39] challenge as we see that great day
[1:31:42] approaching where where we we're facing
[1:31:47] things friends where you may not have
[1:31:50] the time to go get prayed up or somebody
[1:31:54] pray for you or have a prayer line the
[1:31:56] world is falling apart I'm glad we can
[1:32:00] have a camp and structure it and plan
[1:32:01] for it and prepare for it and sing and
[1:32:03] get ready and line people up that's
[1:32:05] great but I'm here to tell you out on
[1:32:07] the streets in this mad world we don't
[1:32:09] have time to organize a prayer line you
[1:32:10] need to have perfect Faith ready to go
[1:32:13] you need and say how do I have it you
[1:32:14] have no condemnation how do I have it
[1:32:17] you have a clear heart in a mind toward
[1:32:18] God how do I have it you're confessing
[1:32:20] Faith how do I have it you're throwing
[1:32:21] down all doubt how do I have it I'm

[1:32:34] to to organize your life in such a way
[1:32:38] today so that you know so that tomorrow
[1:32:42] that's your best way to

[1:32:59] who were at the Youth Camp you want to
[1:33:02] have success

[1:33:10] stand up amen amen all
[1:33:14] right amen you want to have success

[1:33:30] tomorrow organize your life
[1:33:34] today make your life a make your life
[1:33:36] like an organized prayer line an
[1:33:39] organized prayerline we we we go into
[1:33:41] meticulous detail so that we can pray
[1:33:43] for everybody and we don't wear at
[1:33:44] that's why we do it the way we do it we
[1:33:46] want those young people to have some
[1:33:47] time to pour their heart out we want to
[1:33:49] have we don't want to have one preacher
[1:33:51] praying for everybody till he's dead and
[1:33:52] on oxygen and the back room so so that's
[1:33:56] why we set up five stations like that so
[1:33:57] we can it still takes as long to pray
[1:33:59] for them all because now we're giving
[1:34:01] them time but there's more value in it
[1:34:02] and that's just me brother Brandon done
[1:34:04] it both ways brother brandham held
[1:34:06] Gauntlet prayers where you just run
[1:34:07] through my Daddy went through a gauntlet
[1:34:09] prayer that's how I got healed hundreds
[1:34:12] of miles away healed instantly of an
[1:34:14] incurable blood disease cuz my dad was
[1:34:16] going through a prayer line where
[1:34:17] brother brandom said we don't have no
[1:34:19] way to set up a prayer line we can't we
[1:34:21] can't do it we don't have the room' so
[1:34:24] he says he lines the ministers up and
[1:34:25] puts them like a gauntlet and the people
[1:34:27] go through and my dad said preachers are
[1:34:29] just slapping everybody in Jesus name in
[1:34:30] Jesus name hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:34:32] bless him the Lord God and he said he
[1:34:33] gets right down to brother brandham and
[1:34:34] brother brandham is doing the same thing
[1:34:35] he's not stopping anybody until brother
[1:34:37] Eddie gets
[1:34:39] there you know why stopped brother Eddie
[1:34:41] because I needed to be standing here
[1:34:43] tonight to tell you about the glory of
[1:34:45] God hallelujah and he grabbed him he
[1:34:47] stop the line stop the line pulled him
[1:34:49] in said brother and my dad said he
[1:34:52] grabbed him by the arm stuck his finger
[1:34:53] in his face said you believe don't you
[1:34:55] son what do you think brother Eddie's
[1:34:57] going to
[1:34:58] say he said yes sir and he said all
[1:35:01] right at that instant I was healed at
[1:35:04] that instant friends I'm here to tell
[1:35:06] you perfect Faith Works it doesn't
[1:35:09] require you to be a Superman it just
[1:35:11] requires you to believe in a
[1:35:12] supernatural God hallelujah see so you
[1:35:16] can imagine then that that's exactly
[1:35:18] what Satan would do to break your
[1:35:22] concentration on believing the simple
[1:35:25] word of
[1:35:27] God so so you know I I just say we break
[1:35:31] that

[1:43:43] the leg um so they're they're trying to
[1:43:47] save her leg they think they're going to
[1:43:48] be able to save it but they thought at
