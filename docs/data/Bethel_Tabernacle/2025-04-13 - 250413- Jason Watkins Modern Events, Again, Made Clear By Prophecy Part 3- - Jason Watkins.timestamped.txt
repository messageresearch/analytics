[6:43] you, protect you from getting scarred
[6:46] and beaten, you know, and the devil
[6:49] wants you to think, well, you know,
[6:51] that's oldfashioned,
[6:53] but um I wish I'd have been raised in
[6:55] the message from the time I was a little
[6:56] boy. Really do. And I wish I could tell
[7:00] you the the scars that I wouldn't have,
[7:03] but I'm just thankful that he came down
[7:05] one day and said, "You're one of mine."
[7:09] Amen. So, I'll approve that message very
[7:11] much. Very, very much. Do you have a

[32:07] happy to have you here on a beautiful
[32:10] sunny Sunday. Amen. Praise God. Happy to
[32:13] be back here in the home pull pit. We
[32:15] got to enjoy Brother Diggs on Wednesday
[32:17] and I've had so much so much feedback.
[32:21] Uh many people blessed here and abroad
[32:25] and u so I'm passing all of that along
[32:28] to brother Diggs to we sure appreciate
[32:30] him. I love how when he gets in this
[32:31] pullpit, he says, "Happy to be home."
[32:34] Amen. I tell him all the time, he's the
[32:36] most busy traveling evangelist we have
[32:38] because we only get him every couple
[32:40] months. He's home. Amen. So, uh, but he
[32:43] feels at home here and you make him feel
[32:45] at home. I just want you to know, he
[32:47] tells me that privately that this church
[32:50] feels like like his home church.
[32:53] Amen. And um and so of course he feels
[32:55] at home there with brother Anderson as
[32:57] well, but this is like brother Brandon
[32:58] would say when he'd be in Life
[33:00] Tabernacle there in uh in Louisiana, he
[33:03] would say, "This is my uh second home,
[33:05] you know, church." And so they started
[33:08] calling him the associate pastor. Well,
[33:10] Brother Diggs, we already got one
[33:11] associate pastor. We can't have a second
[33:13] one. But uh Amen. We sure appreciate
[33:16] Brother Cadre. Amen. I'm glad to be back
[33:19] from the trip in uh Arizona and had a
[33:22] wonderful time there. Just uh just
[33:26] amazing. And uh it was I I wrote back to
[33:29] brother Ron just to tell him it'll
[33:30] certainly be a hallmark in my mind uh as
[33:34] some of the best meetings I've ever been
[33:36] privileged to take a part of or even
[33:38] been in. And I've been in some good
[33:40] ones, man. And so that one was so good.
[33:44] There was such a pull on the word. was
[33:46] my first opportunity to uh preach
[33:49] alongside brother Chad Lamb. I had
[33:51] preached with brother Chad at a men's
[33:52] meeting years ago, but that's a little
[33:54] bit different. Those are really sessions
[33:56] and not s u preaching services per se.
[34:00] And um and so he uh I remember he was
[34:03] there and closed out the Sunday service.
[34:05] So it's just a different different uh
[34:08] vibe to that. This was my first time to
[34:10] preach in a meeting alongside of him and
[34:13] my goodness did I enjoy it. Brother Chad
[34:15] is such a wonderful brother and uh I
[34:17] just it's somebody that I could sit and
[34:18] talk to for hours and he he feels the
[34:21] same way. We got we got late at night
[34:23] standing in the lobby and I thought we
[34:25] were just going to be there. We might as
[34:26] well have stayed till daylight because
[34:28] we were just having such a good time
[34:30] talking about the word of God. And uh
[34:32] brother Jason Demars was there recently.
[34:35] And so um it's just wonderful,
[34:37] wonderful. We'll see. Amen. How the Lord
[34:40] goes forward. I'd I'd love to do that
[34:42] again sometime. Praise the Lord. We're
[34:44] going to invite you to Daniel chapter 7
[34:49] this morning. And we're only going to
[34:50] read a couple of few verses here because
[34:53] we're going to read the entire chapter.
[34:55] So, we're going to let you be seated.
[34:57] And um while I have you standing, let me
[35:01] just make a few quick announcements. I
[35:03] heard part of this go forward already.
[35:06] We're praying um for Sister Deborah
[35:09] Lowry. Brother Mark wrote in this
[35:11] morning to to say she has hasn't turned
[35:14] a corner yet. Remember that they did
[35:18] when they went in, they found a second
[35:21] um disc that needed so she actually got
[35:23] a double surgery. And so I just would
[35:26] say to her, "Sister Deborah, take
[35:28] courage, sister. Once you get recovered,
[35:31] um according to the doctor, she'll
[35:32] probably never have to go through that
[35:34] again." Amen. So, um, just be giving her
[35:38] some extra prayer this morning. Would
[35:39] you please remember also brother Brad
[35:41] and sister Sarah abroad down in
[35:44] Venezuela there with brother Eric Gallow
[35:46] and meetings there. And brother Brad has
[35:48] asked us especially to pray. I got a
[35:50] text from him letting me know that he
[35:51] they'd made it safe. And so, um, I think
[35:55] that there's included a youth thing
[35:57] going on while they're there. And so we
[36:00] just want to be praying for their
[36:02] blessing, the blessing of the Lord upon
[36:04] all of that and their safe return. Amen.
[36:08] I want to um just make a just a reminder
[36:12] and uh we'll probably send out a
[36:14] reminder um um this week after today and
[36:19] just refer you back to the to the post
[36:21] that we posted. And I'm not going to say
[36:24] a lot u really I'm not going to add to
[36:26] it. Sister Emily composed it and um it
[36:29] was so perfect it didn't need any edits
[36:31] or amendments and I just posted it and
[36:33] we're going to be able to have some
[36:35] fellowship over Easter out here in our
[36:38] fellowship hall. So go back and look at
[36:40] the church chat and you'll see a
[36:41] reference to that a few few postings up
[36:44] and so we're looking forward to that.
[36:46] But I'll send you a a reminder also
[36:48] maybe tomorrow Tuesday. And then also
[36:51] you've got it. You you no you you you've
[36:53] no doubt have seen our special weekend.
[36:55] We're planning for the third weekend in
[36:58] May. And uh we are going to have a
[37:01] special weekend with the Berdettes and
[37:03] other friends. Brother Wes Ardal is
[37:05] coming over to be a part of it. We're
[37:06] going to get our Bethl singers, all you
[37:09] Bethl singers, our Bethl band, best band
[37:11] in the message. And uh we're going to
[37:13] get them um all Amen. and um get get get
[37:17] everything ready to go and get get all
[37:19] those ducks in a row. We're looking
[37:20] forward to that. It's going to be a a
[37:23] singing and a fellowship dinner that
[37:25] Saturday night. And brother Tim and
[37:27] brother Tony, we've been wanting them to
[37:28] come over for a long time. We've been
[37:30] wanting to get Brother Wes here for a
[37:32] long time. And so, uh we're going to put
[37:34] all that together on that third
[37:35] Saturday. And then, Brother Tim, we're
[37:37] gonna chain him down, told him to bring
[37:39] his preaching shoes, and we're gonna
[37:41] make him stay in work for us on Sunday.
[37:44] So, I'm looking forward greatly to that.
[37:47] Amen.
[37:49] Now, a little bit of word I'd like to
[37:52] make while I have your attention before
[37:53] we turn to the scripture. Um, I want to
[37:56] speak to you just briefly. Uh, and I
[37:59] want to make reference to a conversation
[38:02] that brother Jason Demars and I had.
[38:05] And, uh, as you know, Brother JD is
[38:07] really taking some amazing lessons in
[38:10] family relations. and and I was just in
[38:13] the back listening and he's working on,
[38:15] you know, the concepts of history and
[38:17] dating and courtship and all of that.
[38:19] And I just think that the material is
[38:20] fantastic and it really is a relief to
[38:23] me because
[38:25] sometimes I find it difficult without
[38:28] calling a special service, which we have
[38:30] done. We've had some meetings over at
[38:32] the Urban Brew on marriage and we plan
[38:34] to do some more of that. But I just
[38:36] appreciate brother Jason's uh teaching
[38:38] ability. And uh Brother Jason gets uh
[38:42] just just I just want you to know and we
[38:43] discussed this. Brother Jason um um gets
[38:48] a uh gets a next level threshold. He's
[38:51] covering materials that could could come
[38:53] across if you're if you if you
[38:56] misunderstand him. He comes almost into
[38:58] a pastoral lane. And normally I wouldn't
[39:00] allow a teacher to do that. Um and so
[39:04] but brother JD because of the uniqueness
[39:07] of his ministry and by that I mean not
[39:09] just how gifted it is but the fact that
[39:12] brother JD has done the work of an
[39:13] apostle for years um establishing
[39:17] churches abroad. He has founded
[39:19] churches. He teaches churches. He
[39:21] establishes pastors. He has a global
[39:24] footprint that he had long before he
[39:25] ever came to Bethl Tabernacle. This is
[39:27] in fact why Bethl Missions and Present
[39:30] Truth Ministry are separate. We did not
[39:32] absorb Present Truth Ministry. Brother
[39:35] JD moved that headquarters to here and
[39:37] works out of this church and we support
[39:39] Present Truth Ministry. Sometimes we're
[39:41] sending him on Bethl missions trips and
[39:44] um or or a combination of the two. We've
[39:46] done that before and we support him. But
[39:49] I just want to make a note uh so that
[39:52] you understand. Yes, the the the
[39:55] material is is is is really um really
[39:59] coming down to where the rubber meets
[40:01] the road and it has my endorsement and
[40:03] brother Jason and I have talked about
[40:05] this and if he gets too far out of his
[40:07] lane I'll tap him and say
[40:11] and he'll respond to that, you know, and
[40:13] so we have a wonderful fellowship, amen,
[40:16] of our ministry team. Now, I wasn't sure
[40:17] I was going to get to preach today
[40:20] because I slipped out to the restroom
[40:22] and and as I was coming back in, Sister
[40:24] Anna had the uh the door barricaded and
[40:27] a bunch of little girls behind her and
[40:30] um and there were some older sisters
[40:32] trying to get to the restroom, but all
[40:33] those little Sunday school girls were
[40:34] already in line and they were not going
[40:35] to get cut in front of. And so, as I'm
[40:38] walking up, here's a couple sisters
[40:41] who are who are held back and sister
[40:42] Anna's like, "Nobody's getting past me.
[40:46] And I said, "Well, can I go past?" And
[40:48] she went, "Uh,
[40:51] yeah, you can go past." And she said,
[40:54] "Move and let him go by."
[40:58] So, fortunately, Amen. Thank you, Sister
[41:01] Anna, for letting me get back to my
[41:03] office. Amen. I have to work today, so I
[41:06] appreciate that. Amen. Daniel chapter 7.
[41:10] Don't you love the Lord? Love the family
[41:12] of God. Amen. Daniel chapter 7. This is
[41:16] our third installment today
[41:19] and we're uh ministering on modern
[41:21] events again made clear by prophecy.
[41:26] Daniel 7 verse 1.
[41:30] In the first year of Belshazzer, king of
[41:32] Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions
[41:35] of his head upon his bed. Then he wrote
[41:40] the dream and told the sum of the
[41:42] matters. Daniel spake and said, "I saw
[41:45] in my vision by night, and behold, the
[41:48] four winds of the heavens strove upon
[41:50] the great sea, and four great beasts
[41:53] came up from the sea, diverse one from
[41:56] another. The first was like a lion, and
[41:59] had eagle's wings, and I beheld till the
[42:02] wings thereof were plucked, and it was
[42:04] lifted up from the earth, and made stand
[42:06] upon the feet, as a man, and a man's
[42:09] heart was given to it.
[42:11] And behold, another beast, a second,
[42:14] like to a bear, and it raised up itself
[42:17] on one side, and it had three ribs in
[42:20] the mouth of it, between the teeth of
[42:22] it. And they said thus unto it, "Arise,
[42:25] devour much flesh." After this, I
[42:28] beheld, and lo, another, like a leopard,
[42:30] which had upon the back of it four wings
[42:33] of a foul. The beast had also four
[42:36] heads, and dominion was given to it.
[42:39] After this, I saw in the night vision,
[42:41] and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful,
[42:43] and terrible, and strong exceedingly,
[42:46] and it had great iron teeth, and it
[42:47] devoured, and break in pieces, and
[42:49] stamped the residue with the feet of it,
[42:51] and it was diverse from all the beasts
[42:53] that were before it, and it had 10
[42:55] horns. I considered the horns, and
[42:58] behold, there came up among them another
[43:00] little horn before whom there were three
[43:03] of the first horns plucked up by the
[43:05] roots. And behold, in this horn were
[43:08] eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth
[43:11] speaking great things.
[43:14] Keep your Bibles open. Let's pray.
[43:16] Father,
[43:19] Lord, seemingly ominous words that we
[43:22] read in our opening text this morning.
[43:25] And these are weighty matters, Lord. And
[43:27] so, we're asking for your help today.
[43:30] Give us hearing hearts that we may be
[43:32] attentive to all the word of God. And
[43:36] father, teach us thy ways. Now, we're
[43:38] not here to just uh identify symbolism
[43:41] in scripture. We're we're here for more
[43:43] than that. We're not here merely to
[43:46] overlay history and prophecy and this
[43:48] just becomes a history lesson. We're
[43:49] here for more than that. So, Father, may
[43:52] we be able to read between the lines,
[43:54] not just what's on the lines. There are
[43:57] many Bible expositors who read these
[44:00] lines and offer theories and conjecture
[44:03] and doctrinal teaching. But Lord, we
[44:05] realize that we want to know more than
[44:07] just the words on the page. We want to
[44:10] be able to read the intent and find the
[44:12] heart of God between the lines, Lord,
[44:15] and find the vision that you have. So,
[44:18] master, now we come to this sacred
[44:20] moment and I commit it into your hands
[44:23] and commit my self into your hands for
[44:26] service. Father, keep me on track.
[44:29] There's so many directions that my mind
[44:31] would like to go in. It's been very
[44:33] difficult, exceedingly I would say, to
[44:36] try to figure out what we can cover and
[44:39] in what order and in what sequence and
[44:40] what makes the most sense. And so, I'm
[44:42] just trusting that you are in complete
[44:45] control of all of that. Now bless us one
[44:47] and all. We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[44:50] God bless you friend. You can be seated.
[45:09] So let's have my um PowerPoint title
[45:12] slide there. Brother Gideon,
[45:19] let's continue. Um, you know what? Gee,
[45:22] my apologies. We were in the middle of
[45:24] the scripture. Let's go back to that.
[45:26] Thank you. Um, let's pick back up at
[45:28] verse 9.
[45:31] Daniel 79.
[45:34] I beheld till the thrones were cast
[45:37] down, and the ancient of days did sit,
[45:40] whose garment was white as snow, and the
[45:43] hair of his head like the pure wool. His
[45:45] throne was like the fiery flame, and his
[45:48] wheels as burning fire. This is quite an
[45:51] image. A fiery stream issued and came
[45:54] forth from before him. Thousand
[45:57] thousands ministered unto him, and
[46:00] 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him.
[46:04] The judgment was set and the books were
[46:06] opened. I beheld then because of the
[46:10] voice of the great words which the horn
[46:12] spake. I beheld even till the beast was
[46:15] slain and his body destroyed and given
[46:17] to the burning flame. As concerning the
[46:20] rest of the beast, they had their
[46:22] dominion taken away, yet their lives
[46:24] were prolonged for a season and time.
[46:28] I saw in the night visions, and behold,
[46:32] one like the Son of Man came with clouds
[46:34] of heaven, and came to the ancient of
[46:37] days, and they brought him near before
[46:39] him. And there was given him dominion
[46:41] and glory, and a kingdom, that all
[46:43] people, nations, and languages should
[46:45] serve him. His dominion is an
[46:47] everlasting dominion, which shall not
[46:50] pass away, and his kingdom that which
[46:53] shall not be destroyed.
[46:56] I, Daniel, was grieved in my spirit in
[46:59] the midst of my body, and the visions of
[47:00] my head troubled me. I came near unto
[47:04] one of them that stood by, and asked him
[47:05] the truth of all this. So he told me,
[47:08] and made me know the interpretation of
[47:10] the things. These great beasts, which
[47:13] are four, are four kings, which shall
[47:15] rise out of the earth. But the saints of
[47:18] the most high shall take the kingdom,
[47:20] and possess the kingdom forever, even
[47:22] forever and ever. Then I would know the
[47:25] truth of the fourth beast, which was
[47:27] diverse from all the others, exceeding
[47:29] dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and
[47:31] his nails of brass, which devoured,
[47:33] break in pieces, and stamped the residue
[47:35] with his feet. And of the 10 horns that
[47:38] were in his head, and of the other which
[47:40] came up, and before whom three fell,
[47:43] even of that horn that had eyes, and a
[47:45] mouth that spake very great things,
[47:47] whose look was more stout than his
[47:49] fellows.
[47:51] I beheld and the same horn made war with
[47:54] the saints and prevailed against them
[47:56] until the ancient of days came and
[47:58] judgment was given to the saints of the
[48:00] most high and the time came that the
[48:02] saints possessed the kingdom. Thus he
[48:05] said the fourth beast shall be the
[48:08] fourth kingdom upon earth which shall be
[48:10] diverse from all kingdoms and shall
[48:13] devour the whole earth and shall tread
[48:15] it down and break it in pieces. And the
[48:18] 10 horns out of this kingdom are 10
[48:20] kings that shall rise, and another shall
[48:22] rise after them. And he shall be diverse
[48:25] from the first, and he shall subdue
[48:26] three kings. And he shall speak great
[48:29] words against the most high, and shall
[48:31] wear out the saints of the most high,
[48:33] and think to change times and laws, and
[48:35] they shall be given into his hand until
[48:37] a time and times and the dividing of
[48:40] time. But the judgment shall sit, and
[48:44] they shall take away his dominion, to
[48:47] consume, and to destroy it unto the end.
[48:50] And the kingdom, and dominion, and the
[48:53] greatness of the kingdom under the whole
[48:55] heaven shall be given to the people of
[48:58] the saints of the most high. Glory,
[49:00] whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
[49:03] and all dominions shall serve and obey
[49:06] him. Hitherto is the end of the matter.
[49:10] As for me, Daniel, my my my cognitations
[49:14] much troubled me, and my countenance
[49:16] changed in me, but I kept the matter in
[49:19] my heart.
[49:26] It's ominous and yet it's glorious.
[49:30] And this is what prophecy
[49:34] entails.
[49:35] Brother Brandham, I want to just get
[49:37] this out in the beginning. Uh I have a
[49:41] lot of quotes that we want to cover, but
[49:43] we're only going to get to this one
[49:45] today. And so, um, Brother Brandham is
[49:48] going to come in the message um, modern
[49:52] events made clear by prophecy. He
[49:55] preached in August of 1965.
[50:00] Amen. Let me know when we're ready.
[50:02] Okay. Praise the Lord. Modern events.
[50:04] And we are preaching today modern events
[50:06] again made clear by prophecy because we
[50:10] need to understand where we are in the
[50:12] vision. And I I will say I will say this
[50:16] to you and I'll just make these opening
[50:18] comments.
[50:19] [Music]
[50:20] When Daniel's vision of the seventh
[50:24] chapter is complete, that's it. and the
[50:29] kingdoms of our Lord have become the
[50:32] kingdoms uh the kingdoms h of the world
[50:35] have become the kingdoms of our Lord and
[50:38] of his Christ. Now, there's lots of
[50:40] other places in Daniel we're going to
[50:42] have to look at. We're going to have to
[50:43] look at Daniel 12 and Daniel 9 and
[50:46] various places like that. Uh and we're
[50:48] going to try to piece all of this
[50:49] together for you. But I but you're going
[50:51] to see that four gentile kingdoms,
[50:55] notable kingdoms. There have been more
[50:57] than four gentile kingdoms. There have
[51:00] been more than four notable gentile
[51:02] kingdoms. The Assyrian kingdom was a
[51:05] very notable kingdom, but it's not
[51:07] included in these four.
[51:09] Amen. The Inca were a great empire, but
[51:12] they're not included in these four. You
[51:14] understand? So, you have great nations
[51:17] that have risen up. you have um you know
[51:21] um and I could go on down the list
[51:23] today. I don't want to get sidetracked
[51:24] because I'm I'll do that quickly if I
[51:26] start talking about history. We're going
[51:28] to talk a lot about history, but I'm
[51:29] trying to stay on track today. And so we
[51:32] realize that these four gentile kingdoms
[51:36] were going to be notable to God and they
[51:38] were going to be markers along the
[51:40] timeline of mankind in a fallen state.
[51:45] And we realize that coming out of the
[51:47] flood, you're going to have Nimrod rise
[51:49] up and there you're going to have
[51:51] ancient Babylon come on the scene. And
[51:53] so the first kingdom that's notable will
[51:56] be that Babylonian kingdom. It from
[51:59] there it will become and move to the Meo
[52:01] Persian uh empire and then which you
[52:05] know the Babylonian kingdom would be
[52:07] modernday Iraq. the Meo Persian uh would
[52:10] be Iran and places up through there. And
[52:12] then of course the third kingdom would
[52:15] be Alexander
[52:17] seen here as a leopard seen in another
[52:19] passage as a goat with a notable horn.
[52:22] While Persia are is a bear here that we
[52:26] find and you've got an you've got an uh
[52:29] an a lion and a bear and a leopard and
[52:32] so and then a fourth one is diverse from
[52:35] them all. But we realize that when
[52:37] Persia comes up, they are a ram with two
[52:40] horns in another place.
[52:42] You see here, they're a bear with with
[52:44] with ribs in their teeth. And so, you're
[52:46] going to get all of these variations.
[52:48] One of the things to notice is that that
[52:51] after the Grecian Empire under
[52:53] Alexander, you're going to have the
[52:55] Roman Empire come on the scene. And it's
[52:58] diverse from all other kingdoms in
[53:00] numerous ways.
[53:02] Probably one of the most um notable
[53:06] things that makes it diverse and
[53:08] different is that it will be the
[53:11] kingdom. Although it came on the scene
[53:15] and began to be an empire prior to the
[53:18] to to the Lord Jesus being in the earth.
[53:21] The and you go all the way back to get
[53:23] to that Roman. First it was a republic
[53:26] and then and then under Augustus it
[53:28] becomes empire because you you can
[53:30] hardly make the argument for empire
[53:32] until Augustus. But but at any rate so
[53:35] we find that it becomes an empire and
[53:38] it's pagan Rome and it rules the
[53:40] civilized world and uh and and none of
[53:43] them ever ruled the entire globe like
[53:45] the king in the millennium will
[53:47] but they but they had a dominion. And so
[53:50] we realize that one of the things that
[53:52] makes this pagan
[53:54] uh gentile power unique is that it
[53:58] collapses but then through some subtuge
[54:03] and I I I'll go over that when I go into
[54:05] the and and and I deal with that through
[54:07] the history and we find that it
[54:09] resurfaces as papal Rome. Now it's not a
[54:13] political now it's religious that
[54:16] controls political. So now it's a full
[54:19] trifecta, brother Brandham said, of
[54:21] political power, religious power, and
[54:24] demon power.
[54:25] Amen.
[54:26] So we realize then that it invaded
[54:28] Christian Christianity uh after the
[54:31] death of the apostles and the Roman
[54:34] church says that we are the first
[54:36] church. They brother Brandham owned that
[54:39] said well that's true in a sense they
[54:41] are the first organized church but the
[54:44] very first church was at Jerusalem on
[54:46] the day of Pentecost when the jubilee
[54:49] the longawwaited jubilee that Israel had
[54:51] waited on had finally arrived and now
[54:55] the ministry of the son of man that was
[54:57] in operating in Jesus Christ. That
[54:59] ministry would cross over and be born
[55:02] into a bride into a bride body. And that
[55:05] ministry uh would go forward and brother
[55:08] Brandon would say things like now the
[55:10] word of God is made flesh again in the
[55:12] earth. Now it's his body. It's his
[55:14] bride. It's his true church. A lot of
[55:17] times we have to say bride to avoid
[55:20] having you say why do you why don't you
[55:21] just say church? Well if I said church
[55:24] then I got to I got to give you a long
[55:26] explanation that there's two vines and
[55:28] there's a true church and there's a
[55:30] false church. And so it was always
[55:32] supposed to be just the church. And in
[55:35] fact is in that or in those early days
[55:38] every church you would go to was a
[55:40] message church. There was no such thing
[55:42] in the early days as a church that
[55:44] wasn't preaching Paul's doctrines.
[55:48] Not one. They were all subject to St.
[55:51] Paul. Even the apostles. And they were
[55:54] preaching because Paul was the messenger
[55:56] to that age. And so, so this is why
[56:00] you're going to find that that the first
[56:02] thing that happens is they get the
[56:05] dynamics, they get the abstract title.
[56:08] Amen. They get the ministry of the son
[56:10] of man. They get power and then what
[56:12] happens after that? Uh Paul comes on the
[56:14] scene as the second stage. And then from
[56:17] there it the the teaching gets
[56:18] established. So it's dynamics, prophet,
[56:21] and the opening of the word. But when
[56:24] you turn it to the end time, it starts
[56:26] with the opening of the word by a
[56:28] prophet and it finishes with the
[56:29] dynamics. So he's going to finish the
[56:32] church like he started it. This is why
[56:35] it is a restoration back to Paul's
[56:37] teaching because uh that that age was
[56:40] not allowed to go all the way to a body
[56:42] change. They had everything they needed.
[56:44] They had the full word. They had the
[56:46] token. They had the abstract title. They
[56:48] had the son of man. They had the both
[56:51] office and ministry of the son of man.
[56:53] But but but brother Brandham shows us
[56:56] that Jesus had prophesied except a corn
[56:59] of wheat died abideth alone. And since
[57:01] God was never planning just to save that
[57:05] first age because his book of life had
[57:08] names all down through the ages. And I'm
[57:10] glad he didn't just take the first one
[57:12] and one and done. I'm glad he that he
[57:14] stepped back into the eternities and
[57:16] interceded on ignorance and kept
[57:18] building his church and building his
[57:19] church until we've come down to the end
[57:21] time. And now we are at the glorious
[57:24] hour where the restoration is now upon
[57:27] the scene and we are literally returning
[57:30] back to pick up where that church apex
[57:33] began to decline. We pick up right back
[57:36] there and carry it on to a body change.
[57:38] Amen.
[57:40] Because when the last name is called,
[57:43] there aren't any more names.
[57:46] And then the bride is taken from the
[57:48] earth, when she goes, the blood of
[57:50] Christ, the mercy for the Gentiles is
[57:52] gone. That blood ring vanishes. God can
[57:54] then see the sin. That's how the
[57:56] tribulation. You're holding it back here
[57:59] because you're the blood of God by the
[58:01] spirit.
[58:01] Amen.
[58:02] See, so it was never going to be about
[58:04] the chem the chemistry of the blood. It
[58:06] was going to be about the spirit, the
[58:08] life that was in the blood.
[58:10] So the it's not the chemistry. That
[58:12] chemistry ran down the cross, went on
[58:14] the earth, and claimed the earth. But it
[58:16] was the token is not the chemistry.
[58:18] Nobody's got the chemistry. Say, "I'm
[58:20] saved by the blood." You're saved by the
[58:22] life that was in the blood.
[58:24] Nobody has a vial of the chemical of
[58:27] Jesus blood. And if you did, your value
[58:30] would be more than than the value of
[58:33] that because God spent that to get you.
[58:37] Hallelujah.
[58:39] So when you go buy goods, you hand over
[58:42] your money because the goods that you
[58:44] want is more valuable to you than your
[58:45] money.
[58:46] You say, uh, this is valuable, but I'll
[58:48] give this to you if you give me that.
[58:50] And you were so valuable. He was so
[58:52] determined to fill the role of all the
[58:55] names that he came and died for the sins
[58:58] of the whole world.
[59:01] Amen.
[59:05] So,
[59:06] so we find then that we have come now at
[59:10] this time at this end time and a lot of
[59:12] what I'm saying I'll show you in in
[59:14] slides not today. It's going to take a
[59:17] little while to go through this and I'll
[59:18] just remind you that I'm not doing this
[59:21] is not a study per se on the book of
[59:24] Revelation. This is a study on modern
[59:26] events.
[59:29] Made clear
[59:30] by prophecy from Genesis to Revelation.
[59:33] Amen.
[59:34] That's why today we're starting in
[59:35] Daniel. And you know when you
[59:39] let me just let me just cut to the chase
[59:41] uh and give you give you a little bit of
[59:44] of coming thunder is that the modern
[59:48] events made clear by prophecy have all
[59:51] you know you say oh well what's
[59:53] happening in the White House and what's
[59:54] happening at the Kremlin and what's
[59:56] happening in Beijing and what's
[59:57] happening in North Korea they're just
[59:59] pawns
[1:00:01] they're just players what's happening in
[1:00:02] the Vatican just a piece on the
[1:00:04] chessboard and God is moving them
[1:00:06] around. The greatest the event, the
[1:00:09] greatest modern event that will again be
[1:00:12] made clear by prophecy is a bride of the
[1:00:15] last days with the dynamics of the Holy
[1:00:18] Ghost. And you will be a modern event,
[1:00:20] the modern event
[1:00:22] made clear in prophecy.
[1:00:24] Hallelujah.
[1:00:26] You're surviving Leodysia because it's
[1:00:29] prophesied you would.
[1:00:31] You're living. You're overcoming. That's
[1:00:33] where your faith is. That's why the
[1:00:35] message is so vital, so critical, so
[1:00:37] important. You need to eat it, consume
[1:00:39] it, live in it, think on it, pray about
[1:00:42] it, and constantly be feeding on the
[1:00:44] word of God. If you would do that, you
[1:00:47] know what would happen? Like the song,
[1:00:49] the things of this world would grow
[1:00:51] strangely dim.
[1:00:55] People want overcoming power. They come
[1:00:57] to church, they hear a sermon, convicts
[1:00:59] them, they know they're not living very
[1:01:00] spiritual. Listen friends, you're not
[1:01:03] living very spiritual because of your
[1:01:05] spiritual diet.
[1:01:08] That the world already bombards you with
[1:01:10] things you can't avoid. We have to get
[1:01:13] our kids educated. We have to have
[1:01:15] careers. We have to work jobs. We have
[1:01:17] to pay bills. The and and and you have
[1:01:19] to rub shoulders with it. And Paul, you
[1:01:22] know, Paul was not in favor of you going
[1:01:24] to live in a commune somewhere. And God
[1:01:26] was not in favor of his prophet living
[1:01:28] in the wilderness somewhere. He said,
[1:01:29] "I've sent you out as sheep among
[1:01:31] wolves."
[1:01:32] See, so so we so we realize then that
[1:01:36] that that God is is in spite of all of
[1:01:39] these trials. And in fact, as I would
[1:01:41] say to you, that it is because of your
[1:01:44] endurance through the trials that are
[1:01:46] making you stronger.
[1:01:47] I know they feel wearing, but and
[1:01:50] paradoxically, every time you get
[1:01:53] through them, tired, weary, and
[1:01:54] exhausted, you're stronger. Yes. Amen.
[1:01:57] You're more valuable to God.
[1:02:00] A lot of times the trial leaves you so
[1:02:02] beat down, you don't even feel
[1:02:04] spiritual, you feel useless to God.
[1:02:06] Trust me, you're now more valuable
[1:02:08] because you've learned things you don't
[1:02:10] even know you've learned until you face
[1:02:12] them again. And suddenly there's some
[1:02:14] kind of strength and power that you
[1:02:15] didn't have when you went through it the
[1:02:17] first time, but going through the first
[1:02:18] time and you got through it, then Gabe
[1:02:20] gives it to you the next time.
[1:02:22] And this is how God is doing. This is
[1:02:24] why we're climbing Mount Zion. And so I
[1:02:26] would say to you today, you know, reach
[1:02:28] up and get a higher handhold. Let the
[1:02:30] word of God cause you to climb higher.
[1:02:33] And what'll happen is that that that
[1:02:35] when you when you do that and when you
[1:02:37] when you go through that, you don't have
[1:02:39] to come to church and hear the word and
[1:02:40] get convicted and and you you you know,
[1:02:43] the preacher reads a certain scripture,
[1:02:45] makes a certain comment, you know, that
[1:02:47] you just almost have to bow your head.
[1:02:49] Don't live like that.
[1:02:51] Don't be that guy or that gal. uh go
[1:02:53] back to the word and say, "Lord, bring
[1:02:54] me into this image today.
[1:02:57] I don't want to be that person that has
[1:02:59] to blush in the presence of the Holy
[1:03:01] Ghost. I want to be somebody that's
[1:03:03] usable in his hands. I want to be
[1:03:06] somebody he can trust."
[1:03:10] So,
[1:03:12] Satan fills up your life with so much
[1:03:15] stuff that you can't even avoid. You
[1:03:18] have to do it. So, whatever you do,
[1:03:20] don't add freebies to the list.
[1:03:24] Amen.
[1:03:26] You're you're shooting yourself in the
[1:03:29] foot. And that's not that's painful.
[1:03:32] Amen.
[1:03:33] So, Brother Brandham comes here and I'm
[1:03:36] going to have to watch my time. I don't
[1:03:37] want to go long, especially teaching. It
[1:03:40] really sponges the mind and work gives
[1:03:42] you a workout. So, I don't want to overt
[1:03:43] tax you. I want you to learn and and
[1:03:46] again, we're not just learning data.
[1:03:48] Please don't take this as just data.
[1:03:51] This is supposed to be lifechanging.
[1:03:53] These are nutrients and vitamins and
[1:03:56] minerals of the word because brother
[1:03:57] Brandham said when the bride recognizes
[1:03:59] what she is. See,
[1:04:01] and that she can do the greater works.
[1:04:03] And how do you do that? Faith comes by
[1:04:05] hearing the word. We're going to
[1:04:07] identify you in prophecy. We're going to
[1:04:08] show you why you're a modern event.
[1:04:10] Again, just like in Pentecost, just like
[1:04:13] in Brother Brandham's ministry, the
[1:04:15] bride is again made clear in prophecy.
[1:04:18] Amen.
[1:04:18] Do you want to be that?
[1:04:22] So this will I thought that I would read
[1:04:24] this today so that you could you could
[1:04:26] have it as a foundation for the whole
[1:04:28] purpose of this series. So brother
[1:04:31] Brandham Oops. Whoops. So brother
[1:04:33] Brandham would say here in modern events
[1:04:36] made clear in ' 65. This is just months
[1:04:38] before going home.
[1:04:40] Now just let's read along with me. This
[1:04:42] is the only PowerPoint I have for today.
[1:04:45] Now I want to speak concerning this
[1:04:47] Bible and my subject tonight for the
[1:04:49] topic is events made clear by prophecy.
[1:04:52] Events made clear by prophecy. Do we not
[1:04:56] have the back screen working? Is that
[1:04:58] not working?
[1:05:00] Okay. All right.
[1:05:02] Um now the Bible is a different book
[1:05:06] from all other sacred books. The Bible
[1:05:09] is a different book. It is a book of
[1:05:10] prophecy for telling future events.
[1:05:14] And it's also the revelation of Jesus
[1:05:16] Christ all the way from Genesis to
[1:05:18] Revelation brings him out in his
[1:05:20] fullness what he was and is. And the
[1:05:24] whole complete book of revelation 1
[1:05:27] chapter 1 verse 1 to3 said the book is a
[1:05:32] book of the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:05:34] which is the word of God. The revelation
[1:05:37] of Jesus Christ the word of God. Now all
[1:05:40] other books sacred books is only a code
[1:05:43] of ethics a code of morals or a code of
[1:05:45] theology something that's the Quran
[1:05:47] that's Buddhism that's all the an that's
[1:05:50] denominational creeds
[1:05:53] see and so it's just morals and a code
[1:05:57] of theology something that how many ever
[1:06:00] read the Quran the Muhammad and Bible
[1:06:02] and the books of the Buddhist and so
[1:06:03] forth it's just a code of ethics what
[1:06:05] people should live how they should live
[1:06:07] but it doesn't prophesy doesn't say
[1:06:10] anything about these things or about any
[1:06:13] special gifts being given to anybody,
[1:06:14] anything to take place just like joining
[1:06:17] a lodge or something. For the Bible, I
[1:06:21] love this. For the Bible is a living
[1:06:24] foretold witness of Jesus Christ. So,
[1:06:28] it's a living book.
[1:06:30] See,
[1:06:32] and as the earth has grown into its
[1:06:35] fullness, see, we've covered 6,000
[1:06:38] years. of mankind living in a fallen
[1:06:41] state. That's about that world order is
[1:06:43] about to change.
[1:06:44] Amen.
[1:06:44] It's about to get the world's not
[1:06:45] ending.
[1:06:46] The world order is changing. See,
[1:06:49] can't annihilate the earth. It's an
[1:06:50] eternal attribute of God. Millennium
[1:06:53] will be right here. Heavens and earth,
[1:06:54] new heavens and new earth will be right
[1:06:56] here.
[1:06:57] And as the earth has grown into its
[1:06:59] fullness
[1:07:01] and also uh and also vines grow into
[1:07:04] their fullness, the day grows into its
[1:07:07] fullness. The Bible was manifested in
[1:07:10] its fullness in the person of Jesus
[1:07:12] Christ. He was the word of God revealed.
[1:07:15] The whole complete book of redemption.
[1:07:17] The Bible is God's word foretelling the
[1:07:20] future events. Amen. You're tracking.
[1:07:24] You're tracking.
[1:07:26] Its believers is commanded by its author
[1:07:30] to read and believe every word of it.
[1:07:32] Not just part of it. One word to
[1:07:35] disbelieve it. You might as well quit
[1:07:38] trying until you believe that word.
[1:07:40] Every word is absolutely a part of
[1:07:43] almighty God. God made manifest
[1:07:47] uh wound into his word to show forth who
[1:07:51] he is.
[1:07:53] Now
[1:07:56] I want to make a comment here.
[1:08:00] So,
[1:08:02] you know what we're reading here is
[1:08:05] brother Brham is encapsulating what your
[1:08:08] Bible is
[1:08:09] that that Jesus Christ was the
[1:08:12] perfection of it. And that what you're
[1:08:14] seeing here is that the life that was in
[1:08:18] him is in the word. And when you are
[1:08:21] born again of the spirit of God, that
[1:08:23] life is in you. So whether it's the seed
[1:08:26] of the word, whether it's the logos that
[1:08:29] was with God and was God, whether it's
[1:08:31] the gene of God inside you,
[1:08:34] that it's all the it's all part of the
[1:08:36] same thing. It's all part of God's
[1:08:38] expression. So the gene in you allows
[1:08:42] you to be a continuation of the ministry
[1:08:44] of Christ. When you read and study the
[1:08:46] word of God, when you absorb the message
[1:08:49] of the hour, when you align your life
[1:08:52] and your lifestyle according to the word
[1:08:54] that's here, then there is no better
[1:08:58] representation of who Jesus is than you.
[1:09:02] Amen. Amen.
[1:09:04] This can be questioned, but they can't
[1:09:07] question your experience because you're
[1:09:09] the one had it.
[1:09:11] And you become a living testimony. They
[1:09:13] can they can deny all day long uh that
[1:09:17] the Bible doesn't require it doesn't
[1:09:19] mean that you have to live holy and
[1:09:21] separate until you do it.
[1:09:24] And on the day of judgment, they won't
[1:09:26] be able to say, "Well, Lord, we didn't
[1:09:28] think that it meant that." But the Lord
[1:09:31] will say, "Well, my bride lived right
[1:09:33] across the street from you, worked with
[1:09:35] you, went to school with you, assembled
[1:09:38] multiple times a week, every week, and
[1:09:40] you drove by and you saw them."
[1:09:43] Amen.
[1:09:43] See, so in that respect, then would we
[1:09:47] not? And here's a very honest question
[1:09:49] you need to ask yourself, cuz maybe it's
[1:09:51] not true for you. I hope it's true for
[1:09:53] everybody, but I can't make it true for
[1:09:56] you. And God won't make it true for you.
[1:09:58] You have to make it true.
[1:10:00] Duh. Is the my life an accurate
[1:10:03] testimony of Christ?
[1:10:06] Amen.
[1:10:07] Yes or no? Plain and simple. I'm not
[1:10:10] talking about, well, I go to church a
[1:10:11] couple times a week. Most of you do at
[1:10:13] least. And and and I I pay my tithe.
[1:10:17] Most of you do. Thank you. God bless
[1:10:18] you. I you know, I sing. Yeah. Praise
[1:10:21] God. You know, I I testify and witness
[1:10:23] to people. Wonderful. that but but
[1:10:25] listen can I just say to you not to
[1:10:28] burst your bubble not to tell you that
[1:10:31] you're not appreciated but Jesus said
[1:10:33] that as his servant if at the end of
[1:10:36] your life you do you have done
[1:10:38] everything asked of you your testimony
[1:10:41] shall be I was just the Lord's
[1:10:43] unprofitable servant
[1:10:46] no glory to me all glory to him
[1:10:49] so at at the very least I'd like to be
[1:10:52] able to stand there and say When I was
[1:10:54] weak, he was strong. When I couldn't
[1:10:57] face it, he kept pushing me on. And all
[1:11:00] I could do was surrender. And surrender
[1:11:02] is everything I could. And I and I and I
[1:11:05] didn't always surrender it successfully,
[1:11:06] but I kept trying.
[1:11:10] I kept pushing at it. Here's what I was
[1:11:12] determined. I was determined to do it.
[1:11:16] You see, it's like brother Jules said
[1:11:18] many years ago when we were up in the
[1:11:20] A-frame and brother Jules said exactly
[1:11:23] like brother Jules said it. I ain't got
[1:11:25] a problem is you got a problem. He said
[1:11:28] what I got a problem is you got a
[1:11:30] problem and want to keep that problem
[1:11:31] now I got a problem.
[1:11:36] See so so we we all have problems. We
[1:11:39] all have weaknesses.
[1:11:42] Come on.
[1:11:45] Look at your neighbor and say, "He's
[1:11:46] strong, but I I don't know about me."
[1:11:50] It's like It's like the guy said to his
[1:11:52] best friend, his best friend, no less,
[1:11:54] he said, "You know, buddy, the world is
[1:11:56] full of liars except me and you, and I
[1:11:58] ain't sure about you."
[1:12:05] But it's a choice that you make. And I'm
[1:12:07] I'm not here today to say your W your
[1:12:11] win column needs to always have a check
[1:12:13] mark in it and your L column better not
[1:12:15] have any check marks in it. That I'm
[1:12:17] glad that the blood of Jesus accounts
[1:12:19] for that and covers for all the the
[1:12:22] check marks in the in the losses column
[1:12:24] that I've got. It's not about wins and
[1:12:26] losses. It's about where's your heart
[1:12:28] at? What do you desire? What do you want
[1:12:30] to be?
[1:12:31] Amen.
[1:12:32] And that's what God is looking at at
[1:12:34] what I want to be. It's what he told
[1:12:36] sister Georgie E. Bruce. She said, "But
[1:12:37] brother Brandon, I make so many
[1:12:39] mistakes. The prophet didn't deny that.
[1:12:41] He just said, "Sister, that's why Jesus
[1:12:43] had to die. He was our propitiation."
[1:12:46] But God looks at your heart at what you
[1:12:48] want to be. You want to be a godly
[1:12:51] woman. You want to be full of the Holy
[1:12:53] Ghost. You want to have the power. I
[1:12:55] want to have the power. I want to be
[1:12:56] godly. I want to have the word living in
[1:12:58] me.
[1:12:59] Oh my goodness. Bethl Tabernacle. Did I
[1:13:02] just see only a third of the hands?
[1:13:05] Do I need to say that again? Do you not
[1:13:07] agree with me? How many agree with me?
[1:13:09] Say, I want to be all of the word. Well,
[1:13:12] there's about half of you. I want to be
[1:13:14] all of the word.
[1:13:15] It's the last time I'm going to ask.
[1:13:16] Here's your last chance for the Lord to
[1:13:18] see it.
[1:13:19] I want to be all the word that he wants
[1:13:21] me to be.
[1:13:23] Praise God.
[1:13:24] All right, Lord. There you go. I asked
[1:13:26] it five times. So, you saw the hands.
[1:13:29] Amen.
[1:13:29] See, so that's what this sermon is
[1:13:32] about. If you don't have that in your
[1:13:33] heart, we love you. We'll pray for you.
[1:13:36] Come up here. I'll stop preaching right
[1:13:38] now and we'll pray you through to
[1:13:40] victory. I want to see the word desire
[1:13:44] burning in our hearts.
[1:13:46] We are going to make mistakes. We are
[1:13:48] going to make mistakes. You are going to
[1:13:50] make mistakes.
[1:13:51] But I want to see the desire of the Lord
[1:13:53] and the desire of his word burning. I
[1:13:56] want to try and if I fail, I'll try
[1:13:58] again.
[1:14:00] Right.
[1:14:03] This is not a legalist church.
[1:14:06] I've been accused of being a grace
[1:14:08] preacher and they weren't complimenting
[1:14:10] me.
[1:14:13] Was not a compliment. It was that you're
[1:14:16] too too much of a grace preacher. Well,
[1:14:18] I only that because of how much of it I
[1:14:20] need.
[1:14:22] I'm sorry. If you wanted a a a perfect
[1:14:24] pastor 30 years ago, you made the wrong
[1:14:26] choice.
[1:14:27] I got my ups and downs. I'm a man of
[1:14:29] like passions just like Elijah, just
[1:14:31] like Moses, just like Paul, just like
[1:14:33] brother Brandham, but I love the Lord
[1:14:36] and I love his word and I want to see
[1:14:38] him have victory in all of our lives.
[1:14:41] Amen.
[1:14:44] So, you know, here's a question to ask
[1:14:46] yourself in your daily activities. And
[1:14:48] you should think about this whether
[1:14:49] you're at work,
[1:14:51] whether you're in school, whether you're
[1:14:55] at recreation,
[1:14:57] whether you're shopping, whether you're
[1:14:59] on vacation. Don't don't take a vacation
[1:15:01] from holiness.
[1:15:03] Oh, I don't got to go to church this
[1:15:04] Sunday. I get to go down and I'm going
[1:15:06] to strip down and I'm going to show some
[1:15:07] flesh and I'm going to participate in
[1:15:09] this. Shame on you, friends.
[1:15:11] That's right.
[1:15:12] What happened to your love and
[1:15:13] allegiance to Christ?
[1:15:14] That's right. Amen. Well, I got to do an
[1:15:16] activity, so I can't exactly look like
[1:15:18] holiness. What is wrong with you?
[1:15:21] Do you realize? Did Did you Did anybody
[1:15:24] ever tell you that Jesus suffered, bled,
[1:15:26] and died for you?
[1:15:28] And and paid a horrible price so we
[1:15:31] would never have to pay it.
[1:15:33] Amen.
[1:15:34] So again, it's not about mistakes. It's
[1:15:36] about where's your heart.
[1:15:38] Amen.
[1:15:39] What are you That should tell you how
[1:15:40] much you need to get praying. It's
[1:15:42] where's your heart at today. See, if you
[1:15:45] don't care how you how you dress and how
[1:15:48] you act and where you go and what you
[1:15:50] do, then I'll just keep praying for you
[1:15:51] and I'll keep preaching to you as long
[1:15:53] as you'll keep coming here. Uh, and
[1:15:55] we'll keep loving you and we'll keep
[1:15:57] praying and trusting the Lord and we'll
[1:15:58] keep running meetings and we'll keep
[1:16:00] teaching and preaching and I'll bring in
[1:16:02] the weapon and and he'll preach to you
[1:16:04] and he'll walk the aisles and make
[1:16:05] everybody nervous and and but but but
[1:16:08] it's effective.
[1:16:12] Amen. I want to see our parents full of
[1:16:16] the spirit of God because I want to see
[1:16:18] the children have a fighting chance.
[1:16:20] I want to see our teenagers with a
[1:16:22] fighting chance. You might do everything
[1:16:24] right. They might still go astray. That
[1:16:26] can happen. Nobody had better parents
[1:16:28] than Adam and Eve. They had God for a
[1:16:30] parent. They He had them in a perfect
[1:16:32] environment, a paradise, and they still
[1:16:34] fell. It can happen. But at least I'd
[1:16:37] like to know that I did everything I
[1:16:39] could
[1:16:39] and I put on the right example. See, and
[1:16:43] so, you know, and I and and and I'm
[1:16:46] looking as one and wow, this is not in
[1:16:48] my notes. Lord, what's up? And you know,
[1:16:50] I'm I'm just saying, friends, as a
[1:16:52] 30-year pastor, a lot of my scars is
[1:16:55] that when I saw those sweet little
[1:16:57] seven, eight, nine, and 10 year olds,
[1:16:59] and you thought they would just be a
[1:17:01] perfect little angel, though, though the
[1:17:03] parents didn't really live the right
[1:17:04] example, didn't even keep them in church
[1:17:06] regular. And then they hit 11 or 12, and
[1:17:08] I started seeing it. And then 13 and 14,
[1:17:11] the hair was changing, the skirt was
[1:17:13] rising, the boys were getting this, and
[1:17:15] they were getting that, and the world
[1:17:16] was starting to show on them. And then
[1:17:18] by the time they're 16, they're just
[1:17:19] running wild. And and you don't you
[1:17:22] don't have any clue what a scar, what a
[1:17:25] what a stab that is to a pastor's heart
[1:17:28] who preached so hard and pleaded with
[1:17:30] those parents to to make Christ the
[1:17:32] center of your home, and they didn't.
[1:17:34] And to make church the center of your
[1:17:36] activity, and they didn't. to make the
[1:17:39] Bible the center of your knowledge and
[1:17:41] they didn't.
[1:17:41] Yeah.
[1:17:42] And today to to pass them on the street
[1:17:45] and to see them and and they're just
[1:17:46] blown completely out into the world. You
[1:17:48] think there's no hope for them, Brother
[1:17:50] Jason? As long as I got breath in me,
[1:17:51] there's hope.
[1:17:53] I'll pray for them. I'll love them. I'll
[1:17:54] be kind to them. I'll try my best. and
[1:17:57] and thankfully God comes back around and
[1:18:00] many times brings them right back in,
[1:18:01] fills them full of the Holy Spirit and
[1:18:03] even even smears sav over all the wounds
[1:18:06] that they got out in the world
[1:18:07] needlessly. They shouldn't have never
[1:18:08] had to get them, but they do. I don't
[1:18:10] know why I'm preaching this today,
[1:18:11] friends, but this is what's on my heart.
[1:18:15] Amen.
[1:18:18] You understand that that if you that
[1:18:21] that training up a child is not an
[1:18:24] option.
[1:18:25] Amen. because they're going to get
[1:18:27] trained.
[1:18:28] Yeah.
[1:18:29] It's just a it's the only option it is.
[1:18:31] Do you want to be the one to do it
[1:18:33] or do you want to let the world do it?
[1:18:35] Somebody's going to train them.
[1:18:37] See?
[1:18:38] So, it's not about, oh, I don't I don't
[1:18:40] want to do the harder work. I don't want
[1:18:42] to live it a certain way. You better
[1:18:43] because if you don't, they'll take an
[1:18:45] example from someone else. See?
[1:18:47] Amen.
[1:18:48] All right. So, so you need to think
[1:18:51] about that when you're working or you're
[1:18:53] in school or you're shopping or you're
[1:18:55] recreating or you're vacationing. Think
[1:18:57] about your testimony. Think, does my
[1:18:58] life is my life demonstrate that it's
[1:19:01] worthy of the gospel?
[1:19:03] Amen. Is that okay? You still love me?
[1:19:07] Amen. Brother Luther, ain't nobody run
[1:19:08] out, have they? All right.
[1:19:11] That That's rare. People don't usually
[1:19:13] storm out on me. I've had it happen, but
[1:19:15] it's rare.
[1:19:18] So he goes on.
[1:19:22] So he says every word is absolutely a
[1:19:24] part of almighty God. God made down at
[1:19:27] the bottom uh oh let me start at the
[1:19:29] top. Its believers is commanded by its
[1:19:31] author to read and believe every word of
[1:19:33] it not just part of it. One word to
[1:19:35] disbelieve it. You might as well quit
[1:19:37] trying until you believe that word.
[1:19:39] Every word is absolutely a part of
[1:19:41] almighty God. God made manifest wound
[1:19:44] into his word to show forth who he is.
[1:19:47] I got to speed up. We are commanded as
[1:19:50] believers to believe every word of it.
[1:19:51] And it's wrote by the author of God
[1:19:54] himself. There is nobody can add
[1:19:56] anything to it or take anything from it.
[1:19:59] If you would, it would be a freak body
[1:20:02] of God. It would have maybe like six
[1:20:05] fingers on one hand and three arms or
[1:20:07] something to add. It wouldn't look like
[1:20:09] a the the symmetry of of what the
[1:20:12] church, the body of Christ should look
[1:20:13] like.
[1:20:16] to make something away from it and be
[1:20:18] one arm short, one finger short. It's
[1:20:21] the complete body of Jesus Christ. And
[1:20:24] in Christ being the male, the groom, the
[1:20:27] bride is represented in him also. And
[1:20:29] these two are one. At that day, you'll
[1:20:32] know that I am in the father, the father
[1:20:34] in me, I in you, and you in me. What a
[1:20:37] complete picture.
[1:20:39] Amen.
[1:20:40] And the true believers of this word, I
[1:20:42] think I have two more frames. the true
[1:20:43] believers of this word. Now, this is
[1:20:46] modern events
[1:20:48] made clear
[1:20:49] by prophecy.
[1:20:51] And I've already said to you, you're the
[1:20:53] most you're the highest profile event
[1:20:56] God is trying to make according to
[1:20:59] prophecy.
[1:20:59] Amen.
[1:21:00] You're the event.
[1:21:01] You're the highest profile event in the
[1:21:04] modern day that God is looking for his
[1:21:06] word to become flesh.
[1:21:08] Amen. See, so it's it's way less about
[1:21:14] Trump's tariffs.
[1:21:16] Amen.
[1:21:18] It's way less than what the Vatican is
[1:21:20] doing.
[1:21:21] It's way less than what Russia going on
[1:21:23] there in Ukraine. It's it's way less
[1:21:25] than that. You know, the only thing that
[1:21:28] the world including China and they're
[1:21:30] all finding out is what I said years a
[1:21:32] what I said about a year and a half ago
[1:21:34] is China is finding out you cannot fight
[1:21:38] the beast.
[1:21:39] Amen.
[1:21:40] The beast controls the world through
[1:21:42] commerce and craft and money.
[1:21:45] See, so this is a monetary battle that's
[1:21:48] going on. It's about trade and
[1:21:50] international monetary and and and and
[1:21:52] I'm here to tell you that nations can do
[1:21:55] whatever they want. And I don't even
[1:21:56] have a clue. I'm not here to tell you
[1:21:58] how it's going to turn out. Who is
[1:22:00] Trump? I don't. He's a man who's who's
[1:22:01] holding the office. Is he going to be
[1:22:03] the one that is in there when we go
[1:22:04] home? Will Will Francis be the pope? I
[1:22:07] don't know. I know whatever pope is in
[1:22:09] there. When the bride goes up, Satan
[1:22:10] incarnates him and he becomes a an
[1:22:13] incarnate beast.
[1:22:15] I I I I I I know that the beast system
[1:22:18] is in Revelation 13. I know that's
[1:22:20] America.
[1:22:22] Amen.
[1:22:24] So, you know, I mean, I I know that it's
[1:22:27] going to eventually get to where
[1:22:28] somebody's going to globally rise up and
[1:22:30] go, peace and safety finally,
[1:22:34] and then sudden destruction.
[1:22:36] That's what I know.
[1:22:38] How all the pieces are going to fit
[1:22:40] together, who's going to do what when,
[1:22:41] who's on first, what's on second. I
[1:22:43] don't definitely don't know who's on
[1:22:44] third, but we're going to find out. Uh,
[1:22:47] you're going to you're going to have a
[1:22:48] ringside seat at a marriage supper. I'm
[1:22:51] so glad I don't have to be here to go
[1:22:52] through all of that.
[1:22:56] My
[1:22:57] to watch those messengers of every age
[1:22:59] pour out their vial into the tribulation
[1:23:03] and they thought that a partial a
[1:23:05] partial pouring out of the vial during
[1:23:07] the ages was something
[1:23:08] and and e even though it caused woes and
[1:23:11] world wars and they think that's
[1:23:12] horrible, that's nothing. That was a
[1:23:14] temporary judgment.
[1:23:16] Wait till each messenger steps to side.
[1:23:19] You say, you think that's something?
[1:23:20] Watch this. And pours out the the the
[1:23:22] bowl, the vial of wrath, and watch it go
[1:23:25] down into the earth. And the Bible says,
[1:23:27] "Woe unto the inhabiters of the earth."
[1:23:30] Amen.
[1:23:30] For Satan has come down to you. See? Oh,
[1:23:34] hide me in the rock, oh Lord Jesus.
[1:23:37] Hide me in the rock. Hide my children.
[1:23:39] Hide my grandchildren in the rock of
[1:23:41] ages.
[1:23:42] Amen.
[1:23:46] Every believer see and the true
[1:23:49] believers in this world who accept it
[1:23:51] that way believe it and with patience
[1:23:53] wait for its prophesied promises. Every
[1:23:56] one of them to be manifested in its age.
[1:23:58] Every believer has watched for it. Every
[1:24:01] believer that's been on the toes
[1:24:03] watching is the ones that's been
[1:24:05] revealed to.
[1:24:08] So are you on your toes?
[1:24:09] Amen. A lot of times you feel like, man,
[1:24:12] I'm I'm behind. Wow. What what's what's
[1:24:15] this preacher preaching about? I just
[1:24:16] thought I'm just living a life and I go
[1:24:17] to a message church and what what's
[1:24:19] everybody so excited about? Well, it's
[1:24:21] only the Bible says it's the at the end
[1:24:23] time, it's those who know their God who
[1:24:26] are doing great exploits.
[1:24:27] Hallelujah.
[1:24:29] So, you know, if you see the power of
[1:24:31] the spoken word operating in my life and
[1:24:33] you don't feel like you've got it, then
[1:24:34] just follow the path I followed.
[1:24:36] See?
[1:24:38] All right. So every believer has watched
[1:24:40] for it. Every believer that's been on
[1:24:42] the toes watching is the ones that's
[1:24:44] been revealed to. Now look in the days
[1:24:47] of the coming of the Lord Jesus. Why
[1:24:49] didn't those people recognize John when
[1:24:52] the Bible plainly said by Isaiah, there
[1:24:54] will be a voice of one crying in the
[1:24:56] wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord.
[1:24:58] Their last prophet they had, Malachi 3
[1:25:01] said, "Behold, I send my messenger
[1:25:02] before my face to prepare the way." Why
[1:25:06] didn't they see it? Because they was
[1:25:09] looking upon something that had been
[1:25:12] done, basing their thoughts upon some
[1:25:14] message that had went forth beforehand
[1:25:17] and failed to see the present
[1:25:19] manifestation of God in the day they
[1:25:22] were living.
[1:25:25] So, it's all about
[1:25:28] seeing the manifestation of God in the
[1:25:31] day that you're living in. And you know,
[1:25:35] this is exactly why
[1:25:38] um that I have been I took the first two
[1:25:41] sessions and I I I I wanted even to go
[1:25:44] there today and it just I it seemed like
[1:25:45] the Lord hasn't had that for me. But
[1:25:48] we're we're we're going to keep going
[1:25:49] through it because again again again
[1:25:51] again again again I'm not here to just
[1:25:53] educate you in prophecy.
[1:25:55] I'm here to show you where the pieces
[1:25:57] fit and what it means for you.
[1:25:59] See, because everything we're learning
[1:26:01] means something
[1:26:03] for you. It's not just data. It's not
[1:26:05] just information. We're not here just to
[1:26:06] give you theology. We're here to
[1:26:09] activate your faith so that you can get
[1:26:11] busy cooperating in the vision.
[1:26:15] Amen.
[1:26:16] That's what the Christian life is about.
[1:26:18] It's about coop. God has a vision for
[1:26:20] you.
[1:26:22] I pray all the time, God, bring these
[1:26:24] people to the bring me bring me and them
[1:26:27] to the vision you saw of us before the
[1:26:29] foundation of the world.
[1:26:31] Whatever's got to happen, just make that
[1:26:33] happen.
[1:26:34] Amen.
[1:26:35] You can pray that way when your when
[1:26:37] your trust in the Lord uh is is
[1:26:40] absolute.
[1:26:42] Amen. But when we read about these
[1:26:45] prophecies and like we read lengthy in
[1:26:48] Daniel, you know, I and I I'm working on
[1:26:51] an essay that um that I'm not going to
[1:26:53] read for you, but I have the
[1:26:55] introduction here that I just want to uh
[1:26:58] go across and kind of half read it and
[1:27:00] half preach it to you at the same time
[1:27:02] because and and I want to leave you with
[1:27:04] this thought today. This is what I want
[1:27:05] to leave you with.
[1:27:08] And this isn't this is the introduction.
[1:27:11] And I'm just going to read I don't know
[1:27:12] that I'll read it all. It's just several
[1:27:14] paragraphs long. But I still got you.
[1:27:16] Amen.
[1:27:17] You didn't check out and go to Walmart,
[1:27:19] did you? Everybody still here?
[1:27:21] All right. Good deal.
[1:27:23] So, as mankind, the the essay opens this
[1:27:27] way. As mankind
[1:27:30] nears the end of a 6,000year run,
[1:27:34] Amen. in a fallen state. Is there hope
[1:27:39] for the survival of the human race? You
[1:27:43] think that's a fair question?
[1:27:44] Amen.
[1:27:46] The Bible, listen closely. The Bible
[1:27:50] does not offer hope that the end of the
[1:27:55] world can be avoided.
[1:27:57] Right? Amen.
[1:27:58] That's it. Offers hope, but not that
[1:28:00] hope. Right.
[1:28:02] It does however declare with equal
[1:28:04] assurance, thank God,
[1:28:07] that hope in Christ through saving faith
[1:28:11] will save one from the judgments of
[1:28:13] God's wrath and the destruction of the
[1:28:17] world order.
[1:28:18] Amen.
[1:28:18] Steeped in sin.
[1:28:20] Amen.
[1:28:22] Scripture describes the sequence of end
[1:28:25] time events,
[1:28:27] get this, as a prophetic certainty.
[1:28:32] Amen.
[1:28:33] Let that sink.
[1:28:35] Scripture describes the sequence of end
[1:28:38] time events as a prophetic certainty. by
[1:28:41] biblical passages dealing with the end
[1:28:44] times. We've read part of it today that
[1:28:46] that deal with the end times such as
[1:28:48] Matthew 24, chapter 24, chapter 25. You
[1:28:51] remember Jesus goes there and that's
[1:28:53] that's the chapter where there'll be
[1:28:55] wars and rumors of wars. The end is not
[1:28:57] yet. These things must be the beginning
[1:28:59] of sorrows. You remember there'll be
[1:29:01] there'll be false prophets arise and
[1:29:03] will deceive many so that it if it were
[1:29:05] possible it should deceive the very
[1:29:06] elect. You remember all that? Remember
[1:29:08] those ominous words? So this is the same
[1:29:11] Jesus that's that that brought the
[1:29:13] gospel
[1:29:14] and he sent the he sent his disciples
[1:29:16] out two by two. So you realize that he
[1:29:19] didn't send the gospel into the world to
[1:29:22] to circumn the certainty of what he
[1:29:25] said's coming. The world system is going
[1:29:29] to pass away and nothing can stop it.
[1:29:35] Scripture describes the sequence of end
[1:29:37] time events as prophetic certainty.
[1:29:39] Biblical passages dealing with the end
[1:29:41] times such as Matthew 24, Matthew 25,
[1:29:45] Mark 13, Luke 21, Daniel 7, Daniel 9,
[1:29:50] Daniel 12, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, and
[1:29:52] especially the book of Revelation.
[1:29:55] Amen.
[1:29:57] as seen are seen as prophetic
[1:30:00] descriptions of events that will happen.
[1:30:03] And this is a big point. They will
[1:30:06] happen not because God is an evil ogre.
[1:30:08] Right? Amen. Amen.
[1:30:10] They will happen. They are events that
[1:30:13] will happen as part of God's sovereign
[1:30:16] plan. They are not, these prophecies are
[1:30:20] not presented as warnings of potential
[1:30:24] outcomes that human actions can prevent.
[1:30:29] Amen.
[1:30:30] Amen.
[1:30:31] Like all other scripture, endtime events
[1:30:34] are viewed through the lens of a divine
[1:30:37] plan determined by the creator long
[1:30:42] before the foundation of the world.
[1:30:45] Amen.
[1:30:47] Amen.
[1:30:48] The end of the current age. That's the
[1:30:50] age that we are living in.
[1:30:52] And Christ's return. The So, the end of
[1:30:56] the current age, Christ's return, the
[1:30:59] final judgment, the establishment of a
[1:31:02] new heaven and a new earth. Those things
[1:31:04] are considered and should be thought of
[1:31:07] by you as integral parts of God's
[1:31:11] ultimate plan for redemption and the
[1:31:13] consummation of his kingdom. This has
[1:31:16] always been about him.
[1:31:18] Oh yeah.
[1:31:19] It's of him, from him, by him, for him,
[1:31:22] to him.
[1:31:23] Hallelujah.
[1:31:24] Understand this is his plan.
[1:31:26] Amen.
[1:31:27] And so it's all under sovereign control
[1:31:30] and it cannot be countermanded.
[1:31:32] Amen.
[1:31:33] So these events that we speak of, the
[1:31:37] current age, the the world system, the
[1:31:39] sin that's upon the earth, Christ's
[1:31:41] return, the final judgment, the
[1:31:43] establishment of a millennium, the
[1:31:44] establishment of a new heavens. These
[1:31:46] are not these are not in your Bible uh
[1:31:51] depicted as contingent events,
[1:31:54] but they are decreed certainties.
[1:31:57] Yes. Amen.
[1:31:58] They're not contingent events. There's
[1:32:00] no contingency clause,
[1:32:02] right? They are decreed certainties.
[1:32:04] Amen.
[1:32:06] Jesus stated in Matthew 24, "Heaven and
[1:32:10] earth shall
[1:32:13] pass away, but my word, my word,
[1:32:19] my word.
[1:32:21] Come on.
[1:32:22] My kingdom, my family, hallelujah. My
[1:32:26] bride, my wordborn bride will never pass
[1:32:30] away.
[1:32:33] Amen.
[1:32:36] Emphasizing the certainty
[1:32:39] of the events described,
[1:32:42] the hope offered in scripture is
[1:32:45] genuine.
[1:32:46] Amen.
[1:32:47] And applicable to the salvation of the
[1:32:50] soul and overcoming the world. Thank
[1:32:53] God.
[1:32:53] Amen. which is part of the, you know,
[1:32:56] when I say overcoming the world, I mean
[1:32:58] the part of our everyday experiences of
[1:33:01] life. Ain't we got some?
[1:33:02] Amen.
[1:33:03] Come on. Ain't we got some? Some of them
[1:33:06] are doozies.
[1:33:07] Say, Lord, why am I You remember You
[1:33:10] remember a couple weeks ago when we were
[1:33:13] preaching, why did the Lord put Abraham
[1:33:15] to such an unreasonable trial? Walks him
[1:33:18] outside to make him tell him the stars.
[1:33:20] Abraham, I might just do away with you
[1:33:22] if you can't tell me the number of
[1:33:23] stars.
[1:33:25] I mean, what an impossible task. How
[1:33:27] unreasonable was the question. Lord,
[1:33:29] wait a minute. Let me get this straight.
[1:33:31] You've walked me outside and now you're
[1:33:33] requiring me to look up and count and
[1:33:35] tell you the number of stars. And I know
[1:33:37] you know them, but you wanted to see if
[1:33:38] I know them.
[1:33:40] And God, as I said to you, God already
[1:33:44] knew he couldn't tell him the answer.
[1:33:47] You think God didn't know the question
[1:33:49] was unreasonable, but God put him in an
[1:33:52] unreasonable situation to so he would
[1:33:55] stop reasoning the word cuz this was now
[1:33:58] the third time. Genesis 15 was the third
[1:34:01] time Abraham still has to be assured.
[1:34:04] Abraham, I already told you in chapter
[1:34:06] 12. I already told you in 13. Now I'm
[1:34:08] hear it again. And you're still whining
[1:34:10] and crying. I don't think I can do it. I
[1:34:11] don't see I can make it. circumstances
[1:34:13] this and the world that and I don't got
[1:34:15] this and and this one's got that and I
[1:34:16] ain't got nothing and and and and it now
[1:34:19] it looks like these circumstances are
[1:34:20] going to swallow me and my the weakness
[1:34:22] of my flesh and God wanted him to stop
[1:34:24] doing that.
[1:34:26] Look at the original word. Look at the
[1:34:28] stars that it's already got your whole
[1:34:30] life mapped out. The the word in the
[1:34:33] stars sees you there in that kingdom.
[1:34:37] Amen.
[1:34:38] This is why we go back to the original
[1:34:40] word when we find ourselves in fear.
[1:34:44] Just go back to the word.
[1:34:47] So the hope offered in scripture is
[1:34:48] genuine. It's applicable to salvation of
[1:34:50] the soul and overcoming of the world
[1:34:52] which is part of our everyday experience
[1:34:54] of life. But concerning
[1:34:57] the end time events laid out in
[1:34:58] prophecy,
[1:35:00] hope is not for the avoidance of the end
[1:35:05] of this current world system. It's not a
[1:35:09] hope for the for it's not a hope of
[1:35:12] avoidance of the end of this current
[1:35:15] system,
[1:35:17] but rather a way to escape it and live
[1:35:20] on beyond it. Amen.
[1:35:23] I want to live on beyond it. Hallelujah.
[1:35:26] When the world's on fire, I want to
[1:35:29] still be alive. I want to know my
[1:35:31] redeemer liveth.
[1:35:33] Praise God.
[1:35:35] Hope for believers. I'm just finishing
[1:35:37] up and I'm we're going to close.
[1:35:39] Hope for for believers lies in not only
[1:35:44] being saved from destruction to come.
[1:35:48] But while passing through the perilous
[1:35:51] times that lead unavoidably to the
[1:35:54] tribulation, they are actively
[1:35:56] strengthened and secured by the simple
[1:36:00] act of passing through them.
[1:36:04] You understand? This world is falling
[1:36:06] apart. I'm so glad Jesus lives in my
[1:36:09] heart. You're you're you're the fact
[1:36:12] that you're here going forward. Remember
[1:36:14] forward is upward.
[1:36:16] Remember that forward is onward. Onward
[1:36:18] is upward.
[1:36:20] And the bride got out of step, but she
[1:36:22] kept going forward. She kept going. She
[1:36:23] was marching to onward Christian
[1:36:25] soldiers. And instead of going down with
[1:36:27] the rest of the world, she started going
[1:36:29] up.
[1:36:30] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:36:31] Even when she stumbled and was out of
[1:36:33] step, she was still going up.
[1:36:36] Amen. And so we so you realize then that
[1:36:39] that that that while we're passing
[1:36:41] through these perilous times that lead
[1:36:43] to the tribulation, these perilous times
[1:36:46] are actively strengthening us. And we
[1:36:49] are secured by the act of passing
[1:36:51] through them while maintaining our hope
[1:36:54] in Christ. Now James says that knowing
[1:36:57] this James 1:3 that the trying of your
[1:37:00] faith workketh patience.
[1:37:03] You should let faith go. You should let
[1:37:06] uh faith work in you and patience
[1:37:09] because patience is what will be your
[1:37:11] reward. See
[1:37:12] that the trying of your faith workketh
[1:37:14] patience. So let it work. Let it work.
[1:37:18] Amen.
[1:37:19] Quit quit sobbing. Quit crying. Stop
[1:37:22] crying, John. The lion of the tribe of
[1:37:24] Judah has prevailed.
[1:37:27] And when and John went are you talking
[1:37:29] about skitso? John went from weeping and
[1:37:31] crying to all heaven heard him shouting
[1:37:33] glory hallelujah.
[1:37:34] Hallelujah.
[1:37:36] First Peter 1:7 that the trial of your
[1:37:39] faith being much more. Everybody say
[1:37:42] much more.
[1:37:43] Much more precious than of gold that
[1:37:46] perisheth.
[1:37:48] Yeah.
[1:37:48] So I've got something that's worth more
[1:37:51] than gold. Yeah. The trying of my faith.
[1:37:54] Wait, what? Yeah. The trying of your
[1:37:57] faith. Because though it be tried with
[1:38:00] fire, your faith might be found unto
[1:38:03] praise and honor and glory at the
[1:38:05] appearing of Jesus Christ. Gold
[1:38:07] perisheth.
[1:38:09] But faith endures.
[1:38:11] I'm here to tell you, when you see
[1:38:12] Jesus, you won't care about how much
[1:38:14] gold you have.
[1:38:17] Oh my friends, having escaped the
[1:38:19] corruption in the world through lust and
[1:38:21] being delivered from eternal
[1:38:23] condemnation through faith in Jesus
[1:38:26] Christ. And this is a statement I try I
[1:38:28] couldn't remember who I got this from. I
[1:38:29] read it somewhere in a commentary.
[1:38:31] Remember friends that the trial of your
[1:38:34] faith being much more precious than that
[1:38:36] than than than of gold. And this one
[1:38:39] author said that that it will be your
[1:38:43] faith, not your gold that God will have
[1:38:47] on display as evidence of his victory.
[1:38:51] Oh, having escaped the corruption that
[1:38:55] is in the world through lust and being
[1:38:58] delivered from eternal condemnation,
[1:39:00] friends, through faith in Jesus Christ.
[1:39:02] It will be your faith, not your gold,
[1:39:05] that God will have on display.
[1:39:12] Authentic hope.
[1:39:15] Authentic hope
[1:39:18] in Christ
[1:39:21] is centered on Jesus's victories, his
[1:39:26] victorious return to defeat the devil,
[1:39:30] judge the world, and establish his
[1:39:33] eternal reign. It's not it's not it's
[1:39:37] not to to preserve the world's fallen
[1:39:42] state.
[1:39:43] Amen. That's not what hope in Christ is
[1:39:47] to do.
[1:39:47] Amen.
[1:39:48] See,
[1:39:51] read that again. Authentic hope in
[1:39:53] Christ is centered on Jesus's victorious
[1:39:57] return to defeat the devil, judge the
[1:40:00] world, establish his eternal reign. Not
[1:40:03] in any way at all to preserve the
[1:40:05] world's fallen state.
[1:40:06] Amen.
[1:40:07] Properly placed
[1:40:09] and understood. How many want it
[1:40:11] properly placed? You want your hope in
[1:40:12] Christ properly placed?
[1:40:14] Yes.
[1:40:16] Properly placed and understood. Hope
[1:40:18] lies. Is it real? Yeah, it's real. Is it
[1:40:21] genuine? Absolutely. Is it a thing? You
[1:40:22] better believe it. See, it's what
[1:40:24] sustains us. Properly placed and
[1:40:27] understood. Hope lies in the promise of
[1:40:30] Christ for the resurrection of the
[1:40:32] sleeping saints, the change of our
[1:40:35] mortal bodies, and the promise of
[1:40:37] eternal life with the Lord and a renewed
[1:40:40] creation for a thousand years of
[1:40:42] millennial reign. How many takers?
[1:40:46] The ultimate hope is in the new heavens
[1:40:50] and the new earth that follows the
[1:40:51] judgment where righteousness dwells. You
[1:40:53] can find that in second Peter chapter 3
[1:40:56] signifying the end of sin, suffering,
[1:41:01] death, and the full realization of God's
[1:41:05] kingdom. I'm going to be so glad to come
[1:41:08] to the end of sin, the end of death, the
[1:41:10] end of suffering, the end of partying,
[1:41:12] the end of grief, the end of stress, the
[1:41:15] end of anxiety, the end of fear, the end
[1:41:17] of trouble. Oh, hallelujah. The end of
[1:41:19] worry.
[1:41:21] Glory to God. Friends, now you got
[1:41:24] something you can put your faith in.
[1:41:28] The certainty of prophecy isn't
[1:41:32] avoidable.
[1:41:34] It's the last paragraph. The scripture
[1:41:36] emphasizes the need for repentance and
[1:41:40] preparation for the end of the world.
[1:41:44] Amen. the warnings to seek God's
[1:41:46] salvation before serve not to avert the
[1:41:51] end but to urge people to turn to God
[1:41:55] for salvation before the final judgment.
[1:41:58] The hope offered is not in preventing
[1:42:01] these events but in receiving God's
[1:42:04] grace and salvation to pass over them
[1:42:08] into eternal life.
[1:42:11] Amen.
[1:42:12] How many takers? Oh yeah.
[1:42:14] Sign me up, Lord.
[1:42:17] All the way. I'll take it. I'll take the
[1:42:20] way with the Lord's despised few. I
[1:42:23] started with Jesus and I'm going
[1:42:26] through.
[1:42:27] Amen. Come, brother Anthony. Bring your
[1:42:29] team. Let's stand to our feet, friends.
[1:42:32] Amen. That's enough for today. Um, I've
[1:42:36] got a lot of diagrams we want to use and
[1:42:38] a lot of imagery and
[1:42:41] uh, technology has made it infinitely
[1:42:43] easier to get all that stuff now.
[1:42:44] Instead of having to scour the internet
[1:42:47] for and try to find something close to
[1:42:48] what you're looking for, you can
[1:42:49] actually create it now. So, we're
[1:42:52] enjoying that quite a bit. That's quite
[1:42:53] helpful. Amen. And uh, love the Lord.
[1:42:57] How many loving?
[1:42:59] Amen. I want you to bow your heads with
[1:43:01] me over the building today.
[1:43:04] And um just um whatever you choose,
[1:43:07] Brother Andrew, or whatever brother Tony
[1:43:08] directs.
[1:43:13] Lord,
[1:43:15] now I've already
[1:43:17] uh I've already completed three
[1:43:20] installments in this series,
[1:43:23] and I just feel like I'm just getting
[1:43:25] started. There's so much to cover, so
[1:43:27] much to show, so many nuggets and
[1:43:30] beautiful stones and diamonds and rubies
[1:43:32] to pull out and look at and gaze at, see
[1:43:35] where it all fits, to see all the pieces
[1:43:37] come together and and to realize, Lord,
[1:43:39] I suppose for me
[1:43:42] as I study this, Lord, and I I it is my
[1:43:45] hope in you that I can deliver it to the
[1:43:47] people in the same way
[1:43:51] that there has been such an assurance in
[1:43:53] my heart. I can see that you really do
[1:43:57] have all of this in your control.
[1:44:01] He's got it all in control as the as we
[1:44:04] sing the song. And I'm so glad that's
[1:44:06] true. Lord, I pray today that everyone
[1:44:11] under the sound of my voice will take
[1:44:12] new courage today to take and and say,
[1:44:15] "Lord,
[1:44:17] I want to be a part of this and I I I I
[1:44:20] feel like maybe I got some ground to
[1:44:22] make up. Help me today, Lord. Help me
[1:44:24] quickly.
[1:44:25] Oh, maybe I've been a two or three at
[1:44:28] the end of the line, one or two or three
[1:44:29] getting out of step and a prophet
[1:44:30] saying, "Get back in line.
[1:44:33] Get back in step. Stay in line. Stay in
[1:44:36] line.
[1:44:37] Help us, Lord." He said, "When I came
[1:44:39] out of the vision, the last thing I saw
[1:44:41] is those little girls. They were
[1:44:42] hurrying to get back in step." Oh,
[1:44:45] I'm so glad that's the last thing. As
[1:44:47] the vision faded from him, he said,
[1:44:48] "They were hurrying to get back in
[1:44:50] step." Oh, lamb of God. I want to be
[1:44:53] hurrying today. We don't know, Lord,
[1:44:56] what the world holds. We We know what
[1:44:58] tomorrow holds. I I know that the world
[1:45:00] is this world's order is reached its
[1:45:03] end, man. 6,000 years in a fallen
[1:45:06] condition is coming to a conclusion.
[1:45:08] Amen.
[1:45:10] You're not just going to wait forever
[1:45:12] for to go get Benjamin. Well, Lord, when
[1:45:15] we look at Joseph, that was Azenath was
[1:45:19] actually almost second tier. She was
[1:45:21] just dismissed to the palace. Joseph's
[1:45:23] boughs long to embrace Benjamin, the one
[1:45:27] who had been born in his absence.
[1:45:30] And Lord, that's that 144,000. And you
[1:45:32] long to be with them. And you can't go
[1:45:34] to them until this bride is taken from
[1:45:36] the earth. And she can't be taken from
[1:45:38] the earth till that last seed. Oh, may
[1:45:40] it be, Lord God, that we'll find that
[1:45:42] last seed right here, right quick.
[1:45:44] Perhaps Brother Brad will be preaching
[1:45:46] in South in Central America and and
[1:45:49] he'll find that last seed. Maybe brother
[1:45:50] JD when he's in Egypt, he'll find that
[1:45:52] last one. Who can say Lord? Oh lamb of
[1:45:55] God. Maybe it might be right here in
[1:45:57] Buford, South Carolina.
[1:45:59] And we'll go down, Lord. Uh as the place
[1:46:03] where the last seed came in and once
[1:46:06] that happens, Lord, things move very
[1:46:09] quickly at that point. It gathers up.
[1:46:11] Prophet said it it gathers up into
[1:46:13] itself very quickly. There's a short
[1:46:16] quick work. It gathers up into itself
[1:46:17] and the bride is gone. whisked away.
[1:46:22] Lord, that anointing doesn't go back. It
[1:46:24] that eagle doesn't fly back home. That
[1:46:26] that eagle lifts up, flies east, picks
[1:46:28] up Moses and Elijah, and goes right to
[1:46:30] Benjamin. Goes right to those 144,000.
[1:46:33] They're going to receive this same Holy
[1:46:35] Ghost experience. They're going to
[1:46:37] receive this same word, this same
[1:46:39] Christ. Oh, lamb of God, what a day.
[1:46:42] Israel, true Israel, will be born as a
[1:46:44] nation in one day. In one day, that
[1:46:49] nation of true Israel, that 144,000
[1:46:52] elected, it's not the Wall Street Jews.
[1:46:55] It's not all of that. It's that elected
[1:46:58] Jew
[1:46:59] born as a nation in one day.
[1:47:03] Oh, lamb of God, we want to be a part of
[1:47:05] it. It's it's it's it's terrifying and
[1:47:09] it's exciting at the same time. It's
[1:47:12] it's dreadful, but yet it's glorious.
[1:47:14] What a paradox. Lord, I remember when a
[1:47:18] prophet is coming to the end of his last
[1:47:21] message 1964
[1:47:25] and he says, "Now
[1:47:27] for the world, it's a very dark time for
[1:47:31] the world. It's very sad. It's it's very
[1:47:33] serious and dangerous." And the world
[1:47:36] even then knew hardly nothing of what we
[1:47:38] realize today.
[1:47:40] The world was becoming very dangerous,
[1:47:42] very dark, very evil very quickly.
[1:47:46] It would only take a few decades and it
[1:47:48] would spiral, Lord. And and we we are
[1:47:50] faced today with impossible odds and an
[1:47:54] impossible darkness.
[1:47:56] But he went on to say, "But for the
[1:47:58] bride, it's a glorious day. It's a
[1:48:01] bright and sunshine day. Oh, her hope is
[1:48:04] in Christ. Our hope is in the Lord.
[1:48:08] Master, we love you today. And I pray
[1:48:10] that you'll quicken our young people,
[1:48:12] Lord, to want to know the things of God.
[1:48:14] Quicken our married couples to want to
[1:48:16] know the things of God. Our seniors,
[1:48:18] Lord, our ministry team. Quicken us all,
[1:48:21] to want to know the things of God. To
[1:48:24] know the vision clearly and see our
[1:48:25] place in it and be marching in rhythm
[1:48:27] and harmony to the word. May you grant
[1:48:29] it to us, Lord. Time for playing church
[1:48:32] long ago over. These are very serious
[1:48:35] times. And yet it's a a a time of
[1:48:38] jubilation to think that my hope is in
[1:48:41] the Lord and it shall sustain me and
[1:48:43] secure me and I won't pass through that
[1:48:47] tribulation like Noah had to. I'll pass
[1:48:49] over it. Oh God, like Enoch will take a
[1:48:53] walk home one of these days.
[1:48:55] So I pray today for every man, woman,
[1:48:58] boy, and girl present and across the
[1:49:01] airwaves, maybe a later time by an
[1:49:03] archive. Would you deal with their
[1:49:05] hearts, Lord? We love them. There was
[1:49:07] nothing said today with malice or envy.
[1:49:10] There was nothing said today with anger
[1:49:12] or or or disgust. Everything today,
[1:49:15] Lord, the feeling in my heart, however
[1:49:17] it sounded coming from my mouth, Lord, I
[1:49:20] didn't mean for it to sound harsh, but I
[1:49:22] it just if the people can just see that
[1:49:24] it comes from a place of love and
[1:49:26] concern.
[1:49:28] And I'm concerned with myself. I'm
[1:49:30] concerned with the people. I because I'm
[1:49:32] convinced. And a prophet said, "When
[1:49:34] you're convinced, then you're
[1:49:36] concerned." And I'm convinced. We're at
[1:49:38] the end time. I'm convinced that it's
[1:49:40] just about to transition. And therefore,
[1:49:42] I'm concerned about all the ones I love
[1:49:44] and preach to and labor.
[1:49:46] Lord, I want to see them full of the
[1:49:48] Holy Spirit. I want to see the dynamics
[1:49:49] of this church be a refilling of the
[1:49:51] Holy Ghost.
[1:49:53] Oh, lamb of God. That that headstone be
[1:49:55] perfectly into the image of the body,
[1:49:57] fit together, and then the full power
[1:49:59] will raise her off the earth. Oh God,
[1:50:02] grant it to us, Lord. We're looking to
[1:50:04] you now. I commit it. I commit these
[1:50:06] people into your hands and all who have
[1:50:09] heard it. And give us direction, won't
[1:50:11] you, Jesus, for coming lessons in this,
[1:50:15] we're looking to you to know the perfect
[1:50:17] direction. A lot to cover, a lot to say,
[1:50:19] but we want your direction in Jesus
[1:50:22] name. Amen.
[1:50:26] You can you start with the verse,
[1:50:27] brother Tony? Yeah, let's start there.
[1:50:30] Father of kindness, you have poured out
[1:50:36] grace.

[1:50:53] of need.

[1:56:14] [Music]
[1:56:16] Lord, we love you. What could we say
[1:56:19] more, Father? Time would fail to tell of
[1:56:22] how many times you've delivered us, how
[1:56:25] many times you've come on the scene and
[1:56:26] helped us. Times of trouble, times of
[1:56:29] darkness in a world falling to pieces,
[1:56:32] families breaking apart, marriages
[1:56:34] crumbling,
[1:56:36] young people, Lord, losing their mind.
[1:56:38] and and and psychologists are are are
[1:56:41] lifting a warning that Lord, just just
[1:56:44] as brother JD was talking about it today
[1:56:46] in the Sunday school class, all of the
[1:56:49] things that the devil has managed to to
[1:56:52] tear down the very foundations, Lord,
[1:56:54] that even even what was proven to be
[1:56:57] true and a good just system was
[1:57:00] abandoned and thrown aside.
[1:57:02] And now the world, Lord, figures out
[1:57:04] that they know it better than you. They
[1:57:05] know how to do it better than you. They
[1:57:07] got a better plan than your word. Not
[1:57:09] so, Lord. Your word is the ultimate
[1:57:11] plan. Your word is everything that we
[1:57:14] want. Father, so I pray today you go
[1:57:17] with us now. Lord, as we dismiss the
[1:57:19] audience, we're not dismissing them from
[1:57:21] your presence. Nate, Lord, may you go
[1:57:23] with us everywhere. Everywhere today,
[1:57:26] tomorrow, Lord, I'll I'll I'll go to
[1:57:29] sleep thanking you. I'll wake up
[1:57:31] thanking you. I'll I'll sit in my five
[1:57:34] my 5 a.m. chair and I'll lift hands and
[1:57:36] I'll thank you, Lord God, for today for
[1:57:39] this service, for another chance to live
[1:57:41] another day in service to you. Bless our
[1:57:44] sick. Help them, Lord. We hold up Sister
[1:57:47] Deborah for her recovery. We hold up
[1:57:49] Brother Joe for his recovery. We condemn
[1:57:52] the work of the enemy, Lord. We ask that
[1:57:54] you restore them back to perfect health.
[1:57:56] May it be so, Lord. We pray for Brother
[1:57:58] Brad and sister Sarah Broad. Oh God, let
[1:58:01] the word go forth in power. May they
[1:58:02] walk in safety every hour. Lord, grant
[1:58:05] these great needs to us. We have many.
[1:58:08] Oh, we give it to you now in Jesus name.
[1:58:11] Turn around and shake hands with
[1:58:12] somebody, friends. We're going to have
[1:58:13] brother Tony sing us out. Say, "God
[1:58:16] bless you." Give him a hearty good
[1:58:18] greeting. God bless you. Amen. You can
[1:58:22] be dismissed. God bless you. Amen. We'll
[1:58:25] see you in fellowship. God bless you.
[1:58:30] [Music]

[1:58:58] broken every curse.
[1:59:01] Blessed redeemer, you have set this
[1:59:07] captive free.
[1:59:11] Lord I can hear but sing.

[1:59:22] you are
[1:59:26] faithful
[1:59:29] forever.

[2:00:31] [Applause]
[2:00:33] is your faithfulness.
