[9:59] Do you have a request upon your heart?
[10:01] Something you're thinking about? Amen.
[10:04] We have uh several prayer requests.
[10:06] [music] One's from brother Mark for
[10:08] Sister Deborah is by the way. She's
[10:12] feeling good. No pain this [music]
[10:13] morning. Give the Lord a handcuff for
[10:14] that. [applause]
[10:20] [applause]
[10:21] We're thankful she's here. The Lord just
[10:24] keeps her comfortable. But her younger
[10:26] brother, he's 45,
[10:28] he's a diabetic. And the doctors want to
[10:30] cut off his foot. They say that he'll
[10:33] [music] die if they don't. So, it's a
[10:36] pretty urgent need and we just want to
[10:37] remember that this morning.
[10:40] Brother [music] Jack's wife's Kathy,
[10:43] she's nausea and vomiting and [music] we
[10:46] just want to remember that. That's
[10:47] that's that's not fun at all. So, we
[10:49] just want to lift her up before [music]
[10:51] the Lord. Remember, brother Joe, he went
[10:53] to the uh emergency room uh two nights
[10:58] or last [music] night, two nights ago
[11:00] for high blood pressure. Uh he's feeling
[11:03] better today. [music] He's got meds that
[11:05] he's taken. We just want to remember
[11:07] him. And I'd like to remember our
[11:09] brother [music] Mike Gonzalez is dealing
[11:11] with
[11:13] a painful shingles. Remember [music]
[11:16] him. It's painful for him to sit down
[11:18] and everything. It's It's not
[11:19] contagious. Don't worry about it. It's
[11:21] just um he's in a lot of pain. So, we
[11:24] want to [music] remember him this
[11:25] morning. Let's pray.
[11:28] Father, we love you.
[11:30] And Lord, as I spoke these requests and
[11:35] my what if I was looking at having my
[11:38] foot amputated, Father,
[11:41] but Lord, we have an advocate. We have a
[11:44] resource, Father, that your daughter is
[11:48] [music] requesting help for her younger
[11:50] brother.
[11:52] And Lord, we pray in Jesus' name that
[11:54] you would touch him. Remember our
[11:56] brother Joe. Father [music]
[11:58] been battling sickness for quite a
[12:00] while. Lord, we just pray that you would
[12:01] help him. Lord, I'm still believing and
[12:04] looking toward a full recovery for my
[12:06] brother.
[12:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, remember [music] brother Mike this
[12:10] morning the pain. And we pray in the
[12:13] name of Jesus Christ, Father, that you
[12:15] would help him.
[12:16] Sister Kathy, Lord, at home streaming
[12:19] more than likely, Father, [music] we
[12:21] just
[12:23] reach out to you for her this morning
[12:25] that you would touch her, help her, help
[12:27] Brother [music] Jack also, Father.
[12:29] And Lord, as we gather in the name of
[12:31] Jesus Christ this morning, expecting
[12:33] your presence to be with us that you
[12:35] would touch each and every one. Lord,
[12:39] break the bread of life. Father, we love
[12:42] to come to see our brothers and sisters
[12:44] and but Father, we all come to see you.
[12:49] Looking forward to that day, Lord, when
[12:50] we'll come home [music] and we'll all be
[12:53] together. We'll see one another first as
[12:56] our prophet said. [music]
[12:58] But then, Lord, the focus will be
[12:59] totally on you. And may our focus this
[13:02] morning be on you also. [music] Father,
[13:05] as we collect the tithes and offerings,
[13:07] Father, I pray that you bless the
[13:08] cheerful giver. Lord, I just want to
[13:11] thank you for the musicians, the song
[13:13] leader. Father, for each and everyone
[13:15] here that has come with their heart open
[13:17] to you. Father, I pray that you'll pour
[13:20] out a [music] blessing on each and
[13:22] everyone, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen.

[33:04] [clears throat]
[33:04] Do you remember the key?
[33:09] Jesus blinded [music] all my darkness.
[33:14] Sparked my heart within.
[33:17] His grace and mercy lit a passion.
[33:22] Consume my sin.
[33:24] [music]

[35:09] has her.
[35:11] This love will never be [music]
[35:13] extinguished. [singing]
[35:16] I'm alive and wild and free.
[35:19] [music] I'm overtaken by his power.
[35:25] His spirit in me. [music]
[35:27] His spirit in me.
[35:30] His spirit in me.
[35:33] Oh, [music and singing] I've been

[35:40] and watch me burn.
[35:44] I'm going to shout it from the rooftop.
[35:47] [music]

[37:33] [applause]
[37:36] [music]
[37:41] &gt;&gt; [music]
[37:56] &gt;&gt; I've [music] seen
[37:58] some pretty
[38:00] towns.
[38:03] Guess you could say
[38:05] I've been
[38:07] around,
[38:10] found a place
[38:13] to settle
[38:15] down.
[38:18] There is
[38:20] land.
[38:24] [music]
[38:25] Oh, I'm just a pilgrim
[38:29] here.
[38:31] [music] I'm toiling through
[38:34] the world of fear.
[38:38] Our time to leave. It's drawing
[38:43] near.
[38:46] I'm going to that land.
[38:53] [music] Where is I am?
[38:59] I'm home sick [music] for
[39:04] though I've never seen it before. I've
[39:09] got loved ones [music]
[39:12] waiting on that [singing] shore.
[39:16] road.
[39:18] There is [music]
[39:19] a land
[39:25] and [music] it's not not a million miles
[39:32] away
[39:33] [music]
[39:34] or on some far off
[39:37] distance.
[39:41] I'll speed [music]
[39:42] up
[39:44] and they'll slow down.
[39:48] There [singing] is a land.
[39:54] [music]
[39:59] Why am I so homesick for
[40:05] just not [music] myself
[40:08] down here anymore?
[40:11] [music]
[40:12] I'm longing [singing] for that
[40:16] open door
[40:19] [music] that leads to that land.
[40:24] [music]
[40:28] Oh,
[40:30] so I'll drive these weeping
[40:34] eyes
[40:35] [singing] and [music] lift our head
[40:38] toward
[40:40] the sky.
[40:42] Farewell to
[40:45] this [music] world. Goodbye.
[40:50] I'm going to that [music] land.
[40:57] There is [music] a land.
[41:02] Aren't you homesick [music] for
[41:07] though [singing] we've never seen
[41:09] [music] it before? I've got loved ones.
[41:13] [singing] You've got loved ones waiting
[41:16] on that [music] shore.
[41:20] But there is a land [music]
[41:28] [singing] and it's tonight [music] not a
[41:31] million miles
[41:34] away
[41:36] [music]
[41:37] for some far off distance.
[41:42] [music] I'll speed up
[41:46] and they'll slow [music and singing]
[41:48] down.
[41:50] There is a land second verse.
[41:55] [music]
[41:57] Oh, why am I so homesick [music]
[42:01] for? [singing]
[42:03] Sing it. Just not myself
[42:06] down here anymore.
[42:11] I'm longing for [music]
[42:13] that open door
[42:18] that leads [music] to the land.
[42:26] [music]
[42:28] So I'll dry our [singing] weeping
[42:32] eyes
[42:34] and lift my head [music]
[42:37] towards
[42:38] the sky.
[42:40] Farewell to
[42:43] this [music]
[42:44] world. Goodbye.
[42:48] We're going to that land.
[42:52] [music]
[42:55] There is a land
[43:00] I'm so hoping [music]
[43:02] for.
[43:05] Though I've never [music]
[43:07] seen it before. I've got loved ones
[43:11] [singing]
[43:13] there [music] waiting on the shore.
[43:19] But [music] there is a way.
[43:24] Oh,
[43:26] and [music] it's night not a million
[43:31] miles [music] away
[43:35] for some far off
[43:38] dist.
[43:41] I'll speed up
[43:44] and [music] they'll slow down. morning.
[43:49] There [singing] is a way [music]
[43:53] and it's not
[43:56] a million
[43:58] miles
[44:00] away [music]
[44:02] or some far off [singing]
[44:05] distance [music]
[44:06] forever.
[44:09] I'll speed up. [singing] Thank God. and
[44:12] they'll slow down. [music]
[44:16] There is
[44:19] land. [music]
[44:25] [applause]
[44:29] [music]
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; You ready for the word of God?

[44:50] myself. Wasn't quite possible, but uh
[44:53] I'm looking for another round of the
[44:55] word today. I so enjoyed Friday night. I
[44:58] tell you that was just for me um just
[45:02] next level. And so I I told I said,
[45:04] "Brother Aaron, what I'm going to do is
[45:06] it was so successful when I told you
[45:09] this Friday, [music] I just want you to
[45:10] be at 100% liberty and imagine your
[45:12] home." I said, "That worked so well. I'm
[45:14] going to do it again this morning. Take
[45:16] your complete liberty and imagine your
[45:18] home." How many would like to offer our
[45:20] brother [music] Aaron McGary that
[45:22] wonderful liberty? Amen. We're happy to
[45:24] have him and his family [music] here
[45:26] with us again. And uh we've got an
[45:28] afternoon of fellowship planned. So if
[45:30] you want to hang around after a while,
[45:32] Amen. And we're reopening the fellowship
[45:33] hall today at last.
[45:36] Seems like it's been years, but um we're
[45:39] going to have that today to give you a
[45:40] chance to greet brother Aaron and his
[45:42] family and fellowship them a little bit.
[45:43] Turn around and shake hands with
[45:45] somebody standing near you. We're going
[45:46] to go right to the word. Invite Brother
[45:48] Aaron to come forth [music] at this
[45:49] time. Such a good friend. uh brother
[45:52] Aaron I have in brother Aaron and and uh

[46:03] makes for a a growing constant
[46:06] friendship. We love his family. Amen.
[46:08] I've been knowing them since they were
[46:09] all super small. Amen. And so we're
[46:12] happy to have him here with us today.
[46:15] Amen. I want to have brother Drew sing
[46:16] that [music] course again. And that's
[46:19] maybe a half a key higher than we're
[46:20] normally used to. Let's just do it with
[46:22] him. Amen. There is a land. Do you
[46:24] believe there's a land? Oh, our future
[46:26] is bright, friends. As we invite,
[46:28] brother, there is [music] a land.
[46:32] A land. [singing]
[46:34] I'm home. Single. [music]
[46:37] I'm
[46:40] never. [singing]
[46:43] [music]
[46:44] I've got love
[46:48] on this show. Oh,
[46:53] there is
[46:56] [music]
[47:01] [music]
[47:01] no
[47:03] [singing]
[47:05] miles
[47:06] away
[47:08] [music]
[47:09] for so far
[47:12] distance.
[47:15] I'll speed up
[47:18] and they'll [music]
[47:19] slow down.
[47:22] There [music and singing] is
[47:28] [music]
[47:30] amen.
[47:32] Praise the Lord.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; It's so good to be in the house of the
[47:35] Lord today and just enjoy his presence
[47:38] and enjoyed all the singing. I don't
[47:40] know if I've mentioned it here before,
[47:41] but I have a rule. I always have to
[47:43] outdo the song service and we're at 51
[47:46] minutes and I usually try to do double.
[47:48] So I appreciate all the specials this
[47:50] morning. It makes it easier on me just
[47:52] to follow the leading of the Lord. If we
[47:54] could just bow our heads in a word of
[47:55] prayer. We'll do this before we take our
[47:57] scripture, but just to ask God to be
[47:59] present with us in the remainder of the
[48:01] time that we have together today and
[48:03] this weekend. And our gracious heavenly
[48:04] father, we want to offer thanksgiving to
[48:07] you for giving us this opportunity to be
[48:09] together, not just this morning, but
[48:10] beginning Friday. Uh for my family and
[48:13] myself, Lord, it's just been a privilege
[48:15] to be here for all the extra events that
[48:18] have taken place and the time together
[48:21] last night around a campfire and all the
[48:23] effort that went into that. We're
[48:25] appreciative of it. Lord, our time
[48:27] together is always virtuous. And so I
[48:30] just trust that as people have served
[48:32] and they've given of themselves that
[48:34] [music] and we've received of their
[48:36] virtue, may you pour back into them all
[48:37] that they've expended this morning,
[48:40] Lord, as people have labored. I hear the
[48:43] musicians and song leaders just already
[48:45] practicing in the pre-ervice and making
[48:47] sure everything's just submitted to you
[48:50] and yielded, Lord, and as they've given
[48:51] of themselves and created such a
[48:53] tremendous atmosphere today. May they be
[48:56] rewarded for their labor and their
[48:57] service. But above all, Father, we trust
[48:59] that you have been pleased with our
[49:02] worship
[49:03] &gt;&gt; and that you've now come and having
[49:04] inhabited our praises, you desire to
[49:07] speak to us. So take the bread of life
[49:09] and break it to us as only you can as we
[49:11] submit ourselves to you now. Reading
[49:13] your word, we pray that you bless it,
[49:14] sharing quotations from the message of
[49:16] the hour. Make it alive to us by
[49:18] revelation. We ask this in the name of
[49:20] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. And if
[49:23] you could take your Bibles, I'd like to
[49:24] read in Mark chapter 3 and read verses
[49:28] 22 to 27.
[49:32] In Mark chapter 3, again, it's good to
[49:34] be in the house of the Lord this
[49:35] morning. It's good to see everyone
[49:36] that's here. And we saw you see a lot of
[49:39] new faces um from the last time that
[49:41] we're here. And so, it's nice to see a
[49:43] church growing. And I think there's ways
[49:45] that churches grow and there's other
[49:47] ways that churches swell. And um if you
[49:50] add numbers the wrong way, that's
[49:51] swelling. But if you can add numbers the
[49:54] right way, it's growing. And so it's
[49:55] good to see the House of God growing.
[49:57] And um we appreciate the Watkins family
[49:59] very very much. And we're and so we are
[50:02] have tremendous gratitude for being able
[50:04] to be here this weekend and trust we'll
[50:06] have a little bit more fellowship after
[50:08] service. Mark chapter 3 verse 22.
[50:14] And the scribes which came down from
[50:16] Jerusalem said, he hath be elabub, and
[50:19] by the prince of devils casteth he out
[50:22] devils. And he called them unto him, and
[50:24] said unto them in parables, how can
[50:26] Satan cast out Satan? And if a kingdom
[50:30] be a divided against itself, that
[50:32] kingdom cannot stand. And if a house be
[50:35] divided against itself, that house
[50:37] cannot stand. And if Satan rise up
[50:39] against himself and be divided, he
[50:41] cannot stand, but hath an end. No man
[50:44] can enter into a strong man's house and
[50:47] spoil his goods except he will first
[50:49] bind the strong man and then he will
[50:51] spoil his house. Amen. You can be
[50:54] seated. [snorts]
[50:56] I'd like to take a um just as a part two
[50:59] to what we ministered on Friday night
[51:01] building Bethl last night around um the
[51:04] campfire. We shared just some similar
[51:06] principles along the same lines. And as
[51:08] a matter of fact, what I was going to
[51:10] preach this morning, uh, we just kind
[51:12] of, uh, moved and consolidated to last
[51:14] night. The subject matter just seemed to
[51:16] fit. Um, the way this weekend's
[51:18] unfolded, uh, it's been unique, but I
[51:20] just believe God had in his mind what he
[51:23] designed for this weekend. He's just
[51:24] having his way in these services. So,
[51:27] I'm going to make myself at home this
[51:28] morning and continue on this subject of
[51:30] building Bethl. Uh, just since we did,
[51:33] it's been since Friday night, maybe a
[51:35] lot of you weren't here on Friday night.
[51:37] We were looking at how that we make our
[51:38] heart or us as an individual a home for
[51:41] the Holy Spirit. Uh and then by
[51:43] extension our house, we make our house a
[51:46] home for heaven. And then even our
[51:48] church, this Bethl is a home for heaven.
[51:51] And that's a place where God dwells.
[51:53] It's a place where God is made known and
[51:54] it's a place where God has met. And so
[51:57] God dwells. He manifest himself. And
[51:59] then others can meet him there. We took
[52:01] it from Genesis chapter 28 where Jacob
[52:04] woke out of sleep and he said oh surely
[52:06] the Lord is in this place and he said
[52:09] this is none other than the house of God
[52:11] and this is the gate of heaven and he
[52:14] called that place Bethl the house of
[52:16] God. It was a place that he identified
[52:19] with the supernatural, with the very
[52:21] presence of God. And he's saying this is
[52:23] where God dwells. And and it was
[52:25] different to him. Not that God was in
[52:28] creation or everywhere he went, God was
[52:30] there, but rather there was something
[52:31] special about this place where God had
[52:34] manifested himself on earth. He's like,
[52:36] "This is the house of God and the very
[52:39] gate into the presence of God." And so I
[52:42] was using these scriptures and some
[52:44] other things on how that our body um and
[52:46] our dwelling place where you live and
[52:48] our church are represented in this
[52:51] phrase Bethl or the gates of heaven.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; And we must have all three.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; You have to have a body to be a person.
[52:57] You have to have uh a a place to live or
[53:00] you're homeless. Um and you have to have
[53:04] a church. The scripture teaches us to
[53:06] gather together. The message of the hour
[53:08] emphasizes the need to that for that.
[53:10] And then we have this duty to make the
[53:13] inside right by the grace of God. So we
[53:15] have this duty to consecrate these gates
[53:18] whether it be our body, our home or our
[53:20] churches as homes to God. And I believe
[53:24] these things and maybe today it might
[53:26] still be on high level teaching just in
[53:28] other words not very granular or
[53:29] specific but it has very practical
[53:32] impact on home life has a very practical
[53:34] impact on how you live your life. When
[53:36] you want to be a place where he heaven
[53:38] is welcome, you want to be a place where
[53:40] God is manifested. You want to you want
[53:42] to be a vessel where the word is
[53:43] expressed. If you look at yourself as
[53:45] being a Bethl individually, it's going
[53:47] to change the way that you live your
[53:48] life.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; All right?
[53:49] &gt;&gt; And so that's uh I think maybe a good
[53:51] summary for where we were at on Friday
[53:53] night. Now, if you look at our text, I'd
[53:55] like to look at how Jesus when he had
[53:57] cast out devils, uh the response of the
[54:01] scribes was, "Well, this is none other
[54:03] than the power of Satan." and called him
[54:04] Beelzebub uh the prince of devils and he
[54:07] says Satan cannot cast out Satan. He
[54:09] asked the question but we know the
[54:10] answer is he cannot and so it's
[54:12] rhetorical and he says if a kingdom be
[54:14] divided against itself it cannot stand
[54:16] and he says a house if a house be
[54:18] divided against itself that house cannot
[54:20] stand and he says no man can enter into
[54:23] a strong man's house and spoil his goods
[54:25] except he will first bind the strong man
[54:27] and then he will spoil his house. So say
[54:31] Jesus uses this to say that if I could
[54:34] put it this way, Christ had entered into
[54:36] Satan's house and he had bound Satan and
[54:40] because he had bound Satan he was able
[54:42] to cast out devils. You say Satan has
[54:44] not done this but I have entered into
[54:46] Satan's kingdom. I've entered into his
[54:48] house and I've bound the strong man of
[54:51] the house and therefore I can plunder
[54:53] his house where he made an individual's
[54:55] vessel sick. uh um I could I could go
[54:58] and I could cast that devil out because
[54:59] I bind Satan. So this that conclusion
[55:02] teaches us a very very great principle.
[55:05] But the foundation that he bases this on
[55:08] about a house and a kingdom being
[55:10] divided teaches us a very great lesson.
[55:12] So I want to come to those that
[55:14] conclusion here in a little bit. But I
[55:16] want to look at this foundation first in
[55:18] verse 25. If a house be divided against
[55:21] itself, that house cannot stand. So that
[55:24] word house in in in the Greek, it can
[55:26] refer to um an inhabited place or a
[55:28] property, someone's wealth or even their
[55:30] goods. So it's not just a room, but even
[55:32] all those things that relate to it. So
[55:34] any dwelling place where one would say
[55:36] this is my residence, my fixed abode. Um
[55:39] but then it can even mean any building
[55:41] whatsoever. Could be a palace, could be
[55:43] the house of God. It's used even of the
[55:45] tabernacle. And so it's more than just
[55:48] uh a room or a place you live, but it
[55:50] could even be a a tabernacle. Can be a
[55:52] church. uh it's used as one a body a
[55:55] human body that demons live in a house
[55:58] is considered um is used of the human
[56:00] body. So we can look at this to see that
[56:03] it looks to persons a person's
[56:06] individual body or the persons that form
[56:08] a family like a household would be the
[56:10] family of God or the body of Christ the
[56:12] church. So in this he says if a house be
[56:15] divided I want us to be able to put
[56:16] ourselves into that individually our
[56:18] families into that and then our church
[56:20] in that if it can be divided it cannot
[56:22] stand and he says divided against
[56:26] itself. So it's not just a matter of
[56:28] division but it's a way in which they're
[56:30] positioned to where it's not just um
[56:33] being separated out but being separated
[56:35] against one another. In other words,
[56:37] we're we're all different individuals
[56:39] and we're different families. And I know
[56:41] I don't think that we're all
[56:42] intermarried now in this church where
[56:43] everyone's related to one another. We
[56:45] know churches like that, don't we?
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Uh where everybody's related. We won't
[56:49] name names, but we know churches where
[56:51] everybody's married and every family.
[56:52] So, every church gathering is a family
[56:54] gathering. Therefore, it's just it's
[56:56] just toxic. No, I'm just kidding. Family
[56:59] uh every church gathering is a family
[57:01] gathering. But here you have different
[57:02] families, different personalities,
[57:04] different callings, different gifts,
[57:06] different backgrounds. And so it's not
[57:08] that we would be different, but it's
[57:10] being divided against ourselves.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; To be divided means to be separated into
[57:14] parts or divided into parties, split
[57:17] into factions. And so if it be divided
[57:20] against itself, the Bible says in James
[57:23] chapter 1 vers8, a double-minded man is
[57:25] unstable in all his ways. If there's
[57:28] this double-mindedness, then there's the
[57:30] um the divided loyalties. Jesus says you
[57:33] cannot serve God and mammon in Matthew
[57:35] 6:24. You can't serve two masters.
[57:38] You'll either love one or hate the other
[57:40] or just hold to one and despise the
[57:42] other because you cannot have true 100%
[57:46] loyalty to two different things. You the
[57:49] master is the one that's an owner, a
[57:51] possessor, the disposer of a thing, one
[57:53] that has control. So two people can't
[57:55] have full control. So, if a man is
[57:57] double-minded in all his ways, he's
[57:59] dividing his loyalties. He's he's not
[58:02] giving 100% to one. And one of the uh I
[58:05] still can remember very very vividly
[58:07] when your pastor ministered at a a men's
[58:09] meeting years ago and he took this very
[58:12] very um scripture and he brought out and
[58:15] I hadn't caught it before in the message
[58:17] of the hour, which is it's no surprise.
[58:19] Every time a a man of God takes the word
[58:20] of God, I see something in the message
[58:22] I've never seen before. That's what I
[58:24] appreciate appreciate about the gifts of
[58:26] God. But he brought out how brother
[58:27] Brandham used that double-minded man as
[58:29] one who believes God in his head but
[58:31] doesn't have them in his heart.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; And that creates an instability because
[58:35] he's going to have a desire to do one
[58:37] thing and then a desire to do another.
[58:39] But there's the possessor. God isn't the
[58:41] possessor of his soul. So we could see
[58:44] that there's a um a dividing that causes
[58:48] instability. Cannot serve God and the
[58:50] world. A double-minded man is unstable
[58:52] in all his ways. So a house that is
[58:54] divided and then against itself that
[58:57] house falls. And it says on in actsap
[59:00] 2:es 1:2
[59:02] and when the day of pentecost was fully
[59:04] come and we know there was a definitive
[59:07] point at which prophecy had to be
[59:09] fulfilled. So when the day of pentecost
[59:11] had fully come there that's when the
[59:14] holy spirit is poured out. And from that
[59:16] moment on there's no scriptural
[59:18] requirement that we have these tearings
[59:20] until the holy ghost comes. Every age is
[59:23] the age of the Holy Ghost for the true
[59:24] believer.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; That God God can give you and is under
[59:28] obligation to give you the Holy Ghost.
[59:29] And we're not having to wait till some
[59:31] moment on the calendar. But it's a
[59:33] matter of our own yielding. And so it
[59:35] says when the day of Pentecost was fully
[59:37] come, they were all with one accord in
[59:40] one place. At one accord, it means with
[59:42] one mind, with one passion. And and the
[59:45] picture that's being painted is a
[59:46] beautiful one as if it was like when
[59:48] those the outer walls of the tabernacle
[59:50] were finally being raised. what
[59:52] happened. It was that last step for the
[59:53] structure to be completed. You have to
[59:55] have all three uh rooms. And he says as
[59:57] soon as that happened, the glory of God
[59:58] appeared a a and made himself known. And
[1:00:01] so it's when the day of Pentecost had
[1:00:02] fully come, they were all with one
[1:00:04] accord in one place. And and then
[1:00:06] suddenly there came a sound from heaven
[1:00:09] that one accorded uh in with what accord
[1:00:12] it means to rush along and and passion
[1:00:15] along with in unison. So to rush along
[1:00:18] or to be passionate but in unison and it
[1:00:21] creates a musical image. It creates this
[1:00:23] very uh it you seem passion and energy
[1:00:26] but it's it's done so to where nothing
[1:00:28] is out of order. They're they're rushing
[1:00:30] there's enthusiasm. There's energy but
[1:00:32] everything works in harmony. It has that
[1:00:34] musical image where in a symphony uh
[1:00:36] notes different notes are being played
[1:00:38] by many different instruments. And and
[1:00:40] though and though there's different
[1:00:42] instruments and different qualities to
[1:00:43] those instruments and different notes,
[1:00:45] they all harmonize in pitch and tone and
[1:00:47] rhythm, there's no chaos. There's no
[1:00:49] disorder. Despite those different roles,
[1:00:52] the different positions, the different
[1:00:53] notes, the different chairs, the
[1:00:55] different gifts. All those positions,
[1:00:57] different experiences, yet still it all
[1:00:59] works together to harmonize, to make one
[1:01:01] voice. When they were all in one accord
[1:01:03] in one place, suddenly there came a
[1:01:05] sound from heaven as a rushing mighty
[1:01:07] wind and it filled all the house where
[1:01:09] they were sitting. Just like those walls
[1:01:11] of the tabernacle being raised, the
[1:01:13] presence of God came pouring in. And
[1:01:15] that outstanding characteristic is they
[1:01:17] were all with one accord in one place.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Unity.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; This was a a gathering where they were
[1:01:25] unified. And and I believe it's an
[1:01:27] important characteristic. So there's we
[1:01:29] don't have to wait until the day of
[1:01:31] Pentecost for the Holy Ghost to be
[1:01:32] poured out, but there was unity that
[1:01:35] didn't hinder that Holy Ghost from being
[1:01:37] poured out.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amos 3:3 says, "Can two walk together
[1:01:41] except they be agreed?" The walking
[1:01:43] together is can they make progress?
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Can they journey together? It's talk the
[1:01:47] scripture speaks of being unequally
[1:01:49] yolked. That the purpose of a yoke is to
[1:01:51] bind um two beasts to the same burden
[1:01:54] and the same goal. The unequal yoking
[1:01:56] would be one who has a different goal, a
[1:01:58] different passion, a different ability,
[1:01:59] a different quality, and you're trying
[1:02:01] to yoke them to do the same job. There's
[1:02:03] an inequality.
[1:02:05] So to make progress, can two to walk
[1:02:07] together, they have to be agreed.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; That agreement speaks of an appointed
[1:02:12] time or a place of meeting. And and and
[1:02:15] so one way to think about is how can two
[1:02:17] walk together unless they first meet.
[1:02:21] It's like the saying I use sometimes is,
[1:02:22] "Oh, we went to different schools
[1:02:24] together." And and and if you say it
[1:02:27] fast enough, people think you went to
[1:02:28] school together, but you went to
[1:02:30] different schools together. In order to
[1:02:32] walk together, you have to have met.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; If someone walked along the beach this
[1:02:37] morning on one side of town and of the
[1:02:39] beach and then we walked the beach in
[1:02:41] another part, we couldn't say that we
[1:02:42] walked the beach together,
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; but we both walked the beach.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; And so to you have to have met there's a
[1:02:48] meeting of the minds. there's an
[1:02:50] understanding.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean you have to be their twin
[1:02:52] or it doesn't mean it has to be uh um
[1:02:54] this forced uh pretense where we all
[1:02:57] look the same outwardly, but there has
[1:02:58] to be some connection, some joining
[1:03:01] together. [snorts]
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; And so there has to first be a unity
[1:03:05] because if there's not a unity, this he
[1:03:06] says that house cannot stand.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; It's unable to be established.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; It it won't stand still long enough to
[1:03:14] be placed. It it won't it cannot become
[1:03:17] grounded.
[1:03:19] It's division that prevents growth.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; It's division that'll cause one even in
[1:03:25] divided loyalties and the
[1:03:26] double-mindedness. It's what prevents
[1:03:27] that maturity and that develop. It's
[1:03:30] what prevents use of power. Doesn't mean
[1:03:32] you're you're not in the process. But
[1:03:34] this lack of unity is what can keep an
[1:03:37] individual from growing. Uh that
[1:03:39] double-mindedness, the divided
[1:03:41] loyalties, an unsurrendered room in
[1:03:42] their heart, then they can't progress
[1:03:44] because it says the house cannot stand.
[1:03:46] And the word even speaks of being
[1:03:47] established. So you can be established,
[1:03:50] but your growth, Paul said, who did
[1:03:52] hinder you?
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; So there can be a hindrance to this
[1:03:55] progress that we're to be making.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; In Matthew 12:2, it says, "Every kingdom
[1:04:00] divided against itself is brought to
[1:04:03] desolation.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; And every city or house divided against
[1:04:07] itself shall not stand. When it's
[1:04:09] divided, it makes no progress. It may
[1:04:11] exist, but it's not going to thrive. may
[1:04:14] survive but it won't thrive. So when
[1:04:17] turned in against itself it will come to
[1:04:20] desolation. It falters or it dies. A
[1:04:23] statement that kept coming to my heart
[1:04:24] as I was preparing for these services
[1:04:27] even especially last week. Brother
[1:04:29] Bradam said, "Do you know where there's
[1:04:30] disunityity, the spirit of God is not
[1:04:33] welcome."
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. They were all in one one mind and
[1:04:37] one accord in that upper room and they
[1:04:40] had to be in that condition because the
[1:04:42] Holy Spirit wouldn't have been welcome
[1:04:44] in that place.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; So where there is disunityity the spirit
[1:04:47] of God is not welcome. He said where
[1:04:50] there's a resenting spirit God won't
[1:04:52] reveal.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; And I may be paraphrasing that a little
[1:04:55] bit but he says if there's resentment
[1:04:57] then God can't reveal himself. Where
[1:04:59] there's a spirit of disunityity the Holy
[1:05:02] Spirit is not welcome. So a house that
[1:05:04] is not united or a house that is
[1:05:06] divided, it is not a home. It's not a
[1:05:08] bethl.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; It's not a place where God is pleased to
[1:05:12] dwell. And so there are certain
[1:05:15] characteristics that are required in
[1:05:16] order to have a home, in order to have a
[1:05:19] dwelling place of God. If there's
[1:05:21] disunityity, the spirit of God is not
[1:05:23] welcome. So unity is required for it to
[1:05:25] be a dwelling place of God. So there's a
[1:05:28] character or if I could put it this way,
[1:05:31] God's presence should leave a mark.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; There are certain characteristics or
[1:05:35] attributes of God's character that
[1:05:37] should leave a mark in a place that he
[1:05:39] calls home.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; In Isaiah 32:18, my people shall dwell
[1:05:45] to me, this is the perfect definition of
[1:05:47] a home. My people shall dwell in a
[1:05:50] peaceable habitation and in sure
[1:05:52] dwellings and in quiet resting places.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; That's more than a building. Amen.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; That's more than an address. That's more
[1:05:59] than a roof over your head. That's more
[1:06:00] than a cot. My people shall dwell in a
[1:06:03] peaceable habitation in sure dwellings
[1:06:05] in quiet resting places.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; If it's a peaceable habitation, it's not
[1:06:10] a place of striving or fighting. It's
[1:06:12] not disturbed with the alarm of wars.
[1:06:14] You're not sleeping with the enemy.
[1:06:16] There's there's peace there. There's
[1:06:18] agreement and harmony. The sure
[1:06:20] dwellings. It's secure. There's
[1:06:22] confidence there. We read last night
[1:06:23] where brother said, "Make your home a
[1:06:25] happy place. A place where your children
[1:06:27] are pleased to be. Uh that's a place of
[1:06:29] safety. There's a place of acceptance,
[1:06:31] acceptance and comfort. A place of
[1:06:33] provision.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; A house that's not divided against
[1:06:36] itself where there's this infighting and
[1:06:38] this politicking,
[1:06:41] peaceable habitation, sure dwellings,
[1:06:43] quiet resting places. Not it's not
[1:06:46] solely a place for labor. And it may
[1:06:48] feel that way for children who have a
[1:06:50] lot of chores and wives who stay home
[1:06:52] and take care of the family. But the
[1:06:54] home should be a place of rest where
[1:06:55] it's not just a place of labor or
[1:06:57] strife. And this is the idea that I have
[1:07:00] in my heart. When I use the term Bethl,
[1:07:02] we could just have easily said the house
[1:07:03] of God or a home, but it's a place of
[1:07:05] peace. It's a place of provision. It's a
[1:07:07] place of comfort, safety, and rest. It's
[1:07:10] a place where you feel that you belong,
[1:07:11] a place that you want to return back to.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; And so, a house united, a house divided
[1:07:16] against itself is not a Bethl, but a
[1:07:18] house united is a Bethl. Amen.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; And that uniting
[1:07:23] and I I want to take some time to to
[1:07:26] look at this uniting because I think we
[1:07:27] do sometimes have uh different ideas of
[1:07:30] what it means to be united. And I think
[1:07:33] that in my experience, I can only speak
[1:07:35] to my experience, what I've uh
[1:07:39] some of my most difficult things to work
[1:07:42] through in my message experience has
[1:07:45] been the politics and pretense of it
[1:07:47] where there's so much that's external
[1:07:50] and there's so much conf concern about
[1:07:52] getting the outward to look right. So,
[1:07:54] we kind of all look the part of message
[1:07:56] believers, but we don't ever have like
[1:07:58] this unity in our faith with each other.
[1:08:01] Well, we we all believe the word of God
[1:08:02] and we believe these things and that
[1:08:04] becomes our common basis and our common
[1:08:06] ground. We kind of felt like if we could
[1:08:07] all make the outside look good,
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; then we could we could play the part.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; But we make we got to make the inside
[1:08:13] right by the grace of God.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; And so a a uniting is order.
[1:08:20] A uniting is a particular arrangement.
[1:08:22] And the so the order of something and
[1:08:24] the arrangement of something gives it
[1:08:25] strength or it's what gives it its
[1:08:26] character. In 1 Peter 5:5, it says, "Ye
[1:08:30] younger, submit yourselves unto the
[1:08:32] elder." And all the elders said,
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; "Uh, they said it. They said it." Amen.
[1:08:36] Yes.
[1:08:38] Submit yourselves. He says, "Yay, all of
[1:08:41] you be subject to one to another." And
[1:08:43] all the young people said,
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:08:46] So, yes, we are to submit ourselves uh
[1:08:49] the youngers are to submit ourselves to
[1:08:50] the elders, but all of you be subject
[1:08:52] one to another.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; It says, "Submit yourselves to one
[1:08:55] another in the Lord."
[1:08:57] And then it says wives to their husbands
[1:08:59] and and husbands are going to be
[1:09:01] submitting themselves to even to their
[1:09:03] wives to this certain degree. There's
[1:09:04] this yielding to one another.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; It's a mutual dependency is the best
[1:09:09] type of arrangement in a family in a
[1:09:11] marriage in the house of God.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Where it's a codependency that's when
[1:09:15] one is solely relied upon the other for
[1:09:18] everything. Then that's where you get
[1:09:19] manipulation and abuse. And that's where
[1:09:22] there's unnecessary controls put into
[1:09:24] place and it leads by fear. But when
[1:09:27] there's a m mutual dependency, the best
[1:09:29] way that I could describe it is one is
[1:09:30] standing at the door says after you and
[1:09:32] the other one says no after you and the
[1:09:34] other one says no after you. That
[1:09:37] there's this will this attitude.
[1:09:40] It says and be clothed with humility for
[1:09:42] God resisteth the proud and giveth grace
[1:09:44] to the humble. When it says to be
[1:09:46] subject, it means to arrange in order,
[1:09:49] to arrange under, to to uh subject
[1:09:51] oneself or to obey. But it speaks of a
[1:09:53] voluntary attitude of giving in. So that
[1:09:57] there's cooperation there. There's an
[1:10:00] assuming of a responsibility. There's a
[1:10:02] carrying of a burden. So it's one
[1:10:04] recognizing I have this part to play.
[1:10:06] You have this part to play. And this the
[1:10:09] part that I play will benefit you. The
[1:10:11] part that you play will benefit me.
[1:10:12] Together it'll benefit each other. So,
[1:10:14] I'm going to submit myself to for your
[1:10:16] need. I I'm going to submit myself to
[1:10:19] you and your need to do my part. I'm
[1:10:21] going to submit myself to my part and my
[1:10:24] need to do your part.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; A lot of times we speak of
[1:10:27] accountability. But do you realize you
[1:10:29] cannot demand accountability?
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; The very concept of uh accountability is
[1:10:34] that it's willfully and voluntarily
[1:10:37] asked for.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; I I have to ask to be held accountable.
[1:10:41] I can't just say you need to be
[1:10:42] accountable to me. Accountability
[1:10:43] doesn't work that way. So there is a
[1:10:46] acceptance of a of a position and an
[1:10:49] order. Ephesians 5:21 5, excuse me,
[1:10:51] 5:21, submitting yourselves one to
[1:10:54] another in the fear of God.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; So we're to submit ourselves to one
[1:10:58] another in the fear of God. So this
[1:11:00] submission to one another is not a
[1:11:02] hierarchy
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; or we create people who are more
[1:11:04] powerful and people that are better. Uh
[1:11:06] because if you do that, it creates
[1:11:08] imbalance. It creates weakness. But this
[1:11:11] submission to one another is best seen
[1:11:13] as an arrangement among parts.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; That different parts work together in
[1:11:19] such a way to promote that part's virtue
[1:11:21] to assist this other one in their virtue
[1:11:24] so that we could all together fulfill
[1:11:25] our purpose. So when we speak of
[1:11:28] submission, it's not solely for the sake
[1:11:30] of making one subject, but it's for the
[1:11:32] sake of the whole body, for the health
[1:11:35] of the body, so that parts are arranged
[1:11:37] together. And yes, a body has a head,
[1:11:40] but the head is nothing without the
[1:11:42] body.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; The body nothing without the head. They
[1:11:44] see themselves then working together
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; to fulfill a common goal and a common
[1:11:49] purpose.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; I'm my what comes to mind is how Paul
[1:11:54] teaches that every man must bear what
[1:11:57] his own burden
[1:11:59] and that means what he is laden with.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; It speaks of a ship that is being given
[1:12:04] something for carriage and they have to
[1:12:06] transfer. every man must deliver what
[1:12:08] he's been given to carry. But then he
[1:12:10] says, "Bear ye one another's burdens."
[1:12:12] And this isn't in another book. This is
[1:12:14] in the same chapter.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; And so there and it's two different
[1:12:17] words. There's a burden that you are
[1:12:19] tasked with carrying that you must
[1:12:22] you're you're ladened with and it's a
[1:12:24] position. It's a duty. It's a role. It's
[1:12:26] an office that you must submit to for
[1:12:28] the benefit of the whole. And you must
[1:12:31] fulfill that purpose. But when it says,
[1:12:33] "Bear ye one another's burdens," that
[1:12:35] burden, that word there means something
[1:12:36] that's weighing someone down.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; It's something they're not supposed to
[1:12:41] be carrying.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; It's something that they're not tasked
[1:12:44] with bringing through to the other side.
[1:12:45] It's something that's going to cause
[1:12:46] them to not take their their carriage
[1:12:49] and what they're laden with and properly
[1:12:51] fulfill that purpose. So, we're to lift
[1:12:53] the burden up of others.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; And so, it's each one taking their part.
[1:12:59] In the sermon, believest thou this? And
[1:13:01] he make, brother Banner makes this
[1:13:02] statement in a few places. He says, a
[1:13:04] home isn't the house you live in. It is
[1:13:06] the order of the house. That's what
[1:13:08] makes a home. And he quotes a tenner
[1:13:11] cottage. Why should I care? They're
[1:13:12] building a palace for me over there. He
[1:13:14] said, I've seen people lived in palaces
[1:13:16] and didn't have much of a home.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; It's the question, who is the rich man?
[1:13:21] the one who lived in a house that was
[1:13:23] very large and and big and beautiful and
[1:13:25] ornate and then quarreled with his wife
[1:13:27] and wasn't faithful. Uh who who had
[1:13:30] heaven on earth?
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Is that couple in the box car and even
[1:13:34] the proverbs speak of dwelling? It's
[1:13:36] better to live on the rooftop or in the
[1:13:38] corner than it is in a house where
[1:13:39] there's disunityity.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; I know you brothers know what that
[1:13:42] scripture says and I'm just going to use
[1:13:44] the updated the modern Bible.
[1:13:48] Come on.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; It's better that they live on the roof
[1:13:50] of a house than to be with them that
[1:13:52] quarrel.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; See, I used my they them.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; And so there's a it's the order of the
[1:14:00] home in the sermon thirsting for life.
[1:14:02] He says a church is what's on the inside
[1:14:03] of it really.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; That's what makes it up. We pass down
[1:14:07] the street many times we see a house and
[1:14:09] sometimes we say, "Isn't that a lovely
[1:14:11] home?"
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; I remember one time my wife and I were
[1:14:14] driving uh in our travels. We had a
[1:14:16] family with us. We drove by this
[1:14:18] absolutely beautiful homestead.
[1:14:21] Everything about it looked so beautiful.
[1:14:23] My wife said, "Oh, I'd love to have that
[1:14:24] house." And I said, I wasn't threatening
[1:14:26] her or anything. I said, "Do you want
[1:14:27] the divorce that comes with it?" You
[1:14:28] know, uh I don't know if the gift was
[1:14:32] working at the time, but maybe it was.
[1:14:34] But you just there's sometimes you don't
[1:14:35] know. In other words, you don't know
[1:14:36] what's behind the white picket fence.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; You don't know what's on um what's on
[1:14:42] the inside because it's the inside. You
[1:14:44] go, "Oh, that's a lovely home." home. He
[1:14:45] said it might look like a lovely house,
[1:14:47] but the home is the order of the house.
[1:14:50] He says in one place, it's the
[1:14:51] characteristic of it. So he says, you
[1:14:54] see, it's the order that's in it. Order
[1:14:56] of the family.
[1:14:58] Brother Matthew, I was thinking of that
[1:14:59] sermon you ministered one time on the
[1:15:01] order of the anointing that there's an
[1:15:02] order to it. It's not just the
[1:15:04] anointing. It's not just the parts. It's
[1:15:05] the arrangement of the parts.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; How come the statue of a perfect man is
[1:15:09] laid out the way that it is? It matters
[1:15:11] that way.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; It's not all the pieces are there. It's
[1:15:14] all in there. No, they've got to be
[1:15:16] arranged the right way.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; He says, "I think that's what the house
[1:15:19] of God is. It isn't so much a beautiful
[1:15:21] temple, which we do appreciate, but it's
[1:15:23] the order that's on the inside of it."
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; So, there's Brother Brandon once again
[1:15:27] bringing a parallel between the home
[1:15:29] life and the church. So, a house out of
[1:15:32] order, a house that's not arranged
[1:15:35] appropriately is a house divided.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; So, all you have to be in order to have
[1:15:40] disunityity is to not be arranged
[1:15:42] correctly. Amen.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; And this arrangement is not division,
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; but union.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; So you're we're not separated into roles
[1:15:50] to divide us, but we're placed into
[1:15:52] these distinct roles with these
[1:15:54] different functions and offices in order
[1:15:56] to fit together.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; That's why a church has to have one
[1:15:59] pastor.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; There has to be there has to be one that
[1:16:02] makes certain decisions. That's why you
[1:16:04] have um church order. That's why you
[1:16:06] have a set time for church.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, we just kind of all show up
[1:16:10] whenever we want. There's there's a
[1:16:12] reason for order and it's to be able to
[1:16:13] promote certain virtues to give an
[1:16:15] opportunity for certain gifts to be used
[1:16:17] and for God to speak. It's not chaotic.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; What we might call rules and restraints
[1:16:22] and church order and and all these
[1:16:24] different disciplines that we have, it's
[1:16:26] for the purpose of things working
[1:16:28] together. Order is necessary to have
[1:16:31] function, proper function. It's when you
[1:16:34] don't have order that you get strife.
[1:16:36] When a when a machine even in the cogs
[1:16:38] and different wheels aren't working
[1:16:40] together, you get friction. You get
[1:16:42] chaos. You get noise.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Order. Even in the original Latin speaks
[1:16:48] of rows of thread in a loom. Different
[1:16:52] threads being woven together. So a house
[1:16:55] must be woven together into a home.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says it's not just the house
[1:17:01] but it has to be a weaving together just
[1:17:03] as the body of Christ is set together
[1:17:06] and woven together in Ephesians Paul
[1:17:08] describes it in these uh scientific
[1:17:10] terms about the human body each part
[1:17:12] woven together sewn together uh through
[1:17:15] which the energy flows and makes
[1:17:17] increase to the whole body itself each
[1:17:19] organ playing its part we have to have
[1:17:22] order
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; unity is order it's an arrangement of
[1:17:26] family members in relation to one
[1:17:27] another Again, it's not emphasizing
[1:17:30] hierarchy where you have one who calls
[1:17:32] the shots and everybody else just says
[1:17:34] yes, but it's how all those parts work
[1:17:36] together.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; We read the scripture last night on how
[1:17:39] a pastor should rule his house with all
[1:17:41] gravity. It means honesty. And he rules
[1:17:44] it in a way where those that he rules
[1:17:46] respect him,
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; not afraid of him. Well, if we don't do
[1:17:49] it right, he's going to beat us. And the
[1:17:50] most triggering sound to a kid is the
[1:17:52] sound of the garage door.
[1:17:54] It it's it's more respect. It's respect
[1:17:57] for one another and they have respect
[1:18:00] for their dad and and their parents for
[1:18:01] the reasons why they made the decisions
[1:18:03] they made.
[1:18:07] And so it's not a hierarchy where you
[1:18:09] have someone on the top and someone on
[1:18:10] the bottom. I'm sure you've heard the
[1:18:12] phrase low man on the totem pole
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; and you say, "Oh, well, I'm just the low
[1:18:16] man on the totem pole." Well, the myth
[1:18:18] was that the person on the low end was
[1:18:20] the least important. But there's no
[1:18:22] evidence uh to suggest that order of the
[1:18:25] totem pole meant anything to them and
[1:18:27] their religions and their superstitions.
[1:18:30] Uh there was no particular order. But as
[1:18:32] a matter of fact, there's some that
[1:18:33] speculated the one on the bottom was the
[1:18:35] most important because they were usually
[1:18:36] larger and they upheld the structure.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; They're the basis. They were the
[1:18:41] foundation. And so God doesn't have this
[1:18:44] low man on the totem pole mentality.
[1:18:46] Each part is necessary.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Each one has a role and has a function.
[1:18:50] And without it, the body's not whole.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; I I like to say that in the true body of
[1:18:56] Christ, there is no such thing as an
[1:18:57] appendix or a tonsil that we can just
[1:18:59] get rid of without consequence.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Maybe. Well, I'm not going to go there.
[1:19:05] I was going to say maybe if you cut out
[1:19:07] tonsils and remove an appendix, it
[1:19:09] causes gender gender gender identity
[1:19:11] crises in future generations.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying it is, but could it be?
[1:19:16] We don't know.
[1:19:19] In the sermon oneness, brother Bram says
[1:19:21] any man in his family, a correct, good,
[1:19:23] noble, obedient families one with
[1:19:25] another and we're looking at building
[1:19:28] Bethl and the unity that's required
[1:19:30] because a house divided against itself
[1:19:32] cannot flourish. It cannot thrive. And
[1:19:34] so we want to be united, but it's not
[1:19:36] external pretense. It's not agreeing and
[1:19:39] submitting to rules and res regulations.
[1:19:41] I'm sure there's been times when we all
[1:19:42] thought everyone should just sign a
[1:19:44] contract. This is what we're going to
[1:19:46] do. this is what we believe and we if we
[1:19:48] don't get everyone to agree well we've
[1:19:50] just drifted right back into
[1:19:51] denominationalism
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; but it's uh so it's not this external
[1:19:55] idea of um the appearance of being
[1:19:57] together but it's a you this uniting and
[1:20:00] this arrangement where I know my calling
[1:20:02] I know where I fit in I know what I'm
[1:20:04] doing so he says an obedient family is
[1:20:06] one with another if there's something in
[1:20:07] the family that moves them apart it's
[1:20:09] not right the family is broken somewhere
[1:20:13] they should all be one father with
[1:20:15] mother with father children of parent
[1:20:17] parent with children all in agreement.
[1:20:20] So there's this an agreement, there's an
[1:20:21] accord, there's un mutual understanding.
[1:20:24] He says, "And when you see that, you'll
[1:20:25] see one lovely picture." That's God's
[1:20:28] purpose. That's God's nature. God in the
[1:20:31] very beginning, that's what he wanted to
[1:20:33] have is he wanted he want he brought
[1:20:35] forth the family. That was the ultimate
[1:20:36] of his expression. It's when the family
[1:20:38] came forth that he said, "This is very
[1:20:40] good."
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; And so this is something that speaks to
[1:20:44] God's nature, different parts being
[1:20:46] arranged together. And we know that
[1:20:48] there's a head. So we know that there's
[1:20:50] headship. But in in that we might say
[1:20:53] well the head has uh is and this
[1:20:57] headship gives it this preeminence at
[1:20:59] the top. And we and we see that example
[1:21:02] in Jesus Christ. But the head then if we
[1:21:06] use the example of Jesus Christ had
[1:21:07] greater service.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; All right. I'm gonna I'll preach over
[1:21:13] here. I I feel like everybody else look
[1:21:16] look is looking at me like a mule at a
[1:21:17] new gate. [laughter]
[1:21:21] Think about it. The service that Christ
[1:21:23] rendered was the greatest service.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; So the head, yeah, he may be the most
[1:21:28] preeminent, but it has a lot to do with
[1:21:31] how necessary his service is.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; So the head does not exist to be served.
[1:21:36] The head exists to serve.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; It is a position of greater service.
[1:21:42] Amen.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in life's story says
[1:21:44] home is not the house. It's the order of
[1:21:46] the house that makes the home. That's
[1:21:48] what makes home. No matter if it's a
[1:21:50] shanty, whatever it is, if the order is
[1:21:52] right on the inside and godly, it's more
[1:21:55] of a home than if you had a palace
[1:21:57] somewhere. I'd rather live in a shanty
[1:21:59] and be happy than live in a palace and
[1:22:01] be unhappy.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; It's arrangement. It's order. Not
[1:22:05] forced. Because the head, if you're the
[1:22:07] head of the home, I I hate to break it
[1:22:09] to you. I told brother Jason, "This
[1:22:10] might sound very odd for the stream."
[1:22:12] And so, I know they're not using that
[1:22:15] mic, but we perfor we did, we did a
[1:22:17] divorce last night.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Hey, we identified who your spiritual
[1:22:21] husband was at home and or who your
[1:22:24] pastor is at home. It's your husband
[1:22:26] spiritually speaking. And and our our
[1:22:29] pastor isn't our spiritual husband. That
[1:22:31] just upsets the order of things.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; But we recognize in families, the
[1:22:35] husband is the head. in the church, the
[1:22:36] pastors, the the supreme authority, I
[1:22:38] believe, is how brother Brandham
[1:22:39] expresses it. And that means they are
[1:22:42] tasked with greater service,
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; greater oversight. They have they have
[1:22:47] to be sacrificial in their love. They
[1:22:49] have to Jesus sanctified himself for the
[1:22:51] benefit of others. So, a father isn't
[1:22:53] able to say, "Well, I can do what I
[1:22:54] want, live however I want, say what I
[1:22:56] want, and do what I want because I'm the
[1:22:57] head and this is my house." As a matter
[1:22:59] of fact, he might have to not do more
[1:23:02] and restrain himself more and sacrifice
[1:23:04] more than anybody else does in the
[1:23:06] family for the sake of the family.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Greater love hath no man than this.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; And he sanctifies himself, sacrifices
[1:23:15] himself for others sake. And so that's
[1:23:17] that position. There is headship, but in
[1:23:20] order for it to be a home, there's
[1:23:21] order. And that order is that the head
[1:23:23] serves and finds its place in in
[1:23:26] relation to the rest of the body and the
[1:23:28] rest of the body begins to serve with
[1:23:30] that example.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; So we must have order in our personal
[1:23:34] life as we relate to those three rooms,
[1:23:36] those three gates. That's our body. Paul
[1:23:39] said in 1 Corinthians 9:27, "But I keep
[1:23:41] under my body and bring it into
[1:23:43] subjection."
[1:23:45] I believe this is the place where he
[1:23:46] says the words means I beat it black and
[1:23:48] blue. I treat it rudely. One of our
[1:23:52] recent family devotions was on why God
[1:23:54] askked us to do hard things. And we
[1:23:57] think, well, why does God asked us to do
[1:23:58] hard things? God knows the human
[1:24:01] uh our evolution and growth by a being
[1:24:05] hybrid and he knows our fight orflight
[1:24:07] responses. He knows how we're wired
[1:24:10] chemically and what our responses would
[1:24:12] be. And he knows that if we can when we
[1:24:15] do hard things, we become more
[1:24:17] perseverant.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. that we we get greater endurance
[1:24:20] and greater stamina. So God just doesn't
[1:24:22] save our souls and we're saved and now
[1:24:24] everything's fine. He begins to ask us
[1:24:26] to do hard things. You know, one of the
[1:24:27] first hard things he asks us to do, be
[1:24:29] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:30] Christ fully immersed in water. You say,
[1:24:32] "Well, it doesn't seem like a hard
[1:24:34] thing, but it's hard intellectually."
[1:24:35] Well, why does that matter?
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; But he asked us to make ourselves
[1:24:39] uncomfortable.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; He asked us to make oursel vulnerable.
[1:24:42] He asked us to discipline ourselves to
[1:24:45] restrict from certain things. And we
[1:24:47] say, "Oh, well, I'm not allowed to do
[1:24:48] this. I'm not allowed to do that. That's
[1:24:49] God knowing you.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; That's God knowing that there's going to
[1:24:52] be difficult decisions to make later on
[1:24:54] in life that as a man, you you may be
[1:24:56] put in a position one time where the
[1:24:57] devil is really trying to entice you
[1:24:59] into something and you're going to have
[1:25:00] to be able to say no. Say, "Well, how
[1:25:02] did you learn to say no to that?"
[1:25:03] Because I learned to say no to things
[1:25:05] that might have seemed very trivial in
[1:25:07] terms of how I cut my hair, the kind of
[1:25:09] clothes I wore. I got used to doing hard
[1:25:11] things so that when it came to that
[1:25:13] point, I say hard, it was hard maybe
[1:25:15] emotionally or intellectually, but not
[1:25:17] hard physically.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; How hard is it to present yourself in in
[1:25:21] a in a a a manly way?
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Maybe not very difficult in terms of the
[1:25:26] ease with which it takes to put on
[1:25:28] decent clothes. But when it comes to
[1:25:30] that time when you're having to say no
[1:25:32] to a lust and to say no to a terrible
[1:25:34] situation, he said, "I've been building
[1:25:36] up. I've been spiritually lifting
[1:25:38] weights and now it's time for my
[1:25:40] personal best because I've been lifting
[1:25:42] to failure. Now I'm put in a position
[1:25:44] where I have to say no to this. And it's
[1:25:46] because God's asked me to do hard
[1:25:48] things. When it comes time to do the
[1:25:50] hardest and put death under my feet,
[1:25:52] it'll just be another step.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; And so we have to bring our body under
[1:25:58] subjection. Bring our mind and body body
[1:26:01] into harmony with the word. That's the
[1:26:03] order of the individual. There's order
[1:26:05] in the church. As Paul says in 1
[1:26:06] Corinthians 14:40, let all things be
[1:26:08] done decently and in order.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Decently means in proper form.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Wellformed. It actually speaks of the
[1:26:16] beauty, the form of something, the
[1:26:17] shape. Let everything be done decently
[1:26:19] and in order. That's a fixed
[1:26:21] arrangement. Order is a fixed
[1:26:22] arrangement. The right order, the right
[1:26:23] position, everyone being at their post.
[1:26:27] And that post that says every fixed
[1:26:29] decently and in order, it speaks of a
[1:26:30] person's quality or character.
[1:26:33] So, there's a quality, there's a gift,
[1:26:35] there's a a way God has made someone.
[1:26:36] They're suited to play the piano,
[1:26:38] they're suited to lead worship, they're
[1:26:41] suited uh to run the sound. Though, they
[1:26:43] can be some of the most uniquely suited
[1:26:45] people.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; In my experience,
[1:26:52] you've heard this statement before, I'm
[1:26:54] sure. United we stand, divided we fall.
[1:26:58] It's from Asop's fables. You know, there
[1:26:59] he gives these different fables about
[1:27:01] the the four oxen and the lion. There's
[1:27:03] a bundle of sticks and the lion and the
[1:27:05] bulls. And each one spoke of this
[1:27:06] principle of united we stand, divided we
[1:27:09] fall.
[1:27:11] This is a common principle that we can
[1:27:13] see over and over again. And that
[1:27:16] uniting is order, arrangement, taking my
[1:27:20] position, staying in my position because
[1:27:22] if I if I step out of position, it
[1:27:23] breaks the unity.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:27] 1 Corinthians 14:33. I I'll even go so
[1:27:29] far as to say this just to to help some.
[1:27:31] Sometimes we're striving so much for the
[1:27:33] the affirmation externally.
[1:27:37] And we want we want things to agree that
[1:27:39] really all you have to do is be in your
[1:27:40] place and pray that everyone else gets
[1:27:43] in their place. And just by being in
[1:27:44] your place, it creates the accord.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Well, you don't have to meet somebody
[1:27:49] else uh elsewhere and say, "Well, you're
[1:27:51] out of your position, so let me get out
[1:27:52] of my position." Just stay in your
[1:27:54] position. And if you're in your
[1:27:56] position, it helps for others to be in
[1:27:57] their position.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; A husband in his place makes it easier
[1:28:00] for the wife to be in his place, which
[1:28:02] makes it easier for the kids to be in
[1:28:03] their place.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Says, "For God is not the author of
[1:28:07] confusion." 1 Corinthians 14:33, "But of
[1:28:10] peace as in all churches of the saints."
[1:28:12] There's the unity in the local body.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; God is not the author of instability and
[1:28:17] disorder. But he's the author of harmony
[1:28:19] and accord. That's what peace means.
[1:28:24] Judges, it says that the Israel was knit
[1:28:26] together as one man.
[1:28:29] That's that strength that comes from
[1:28:31] being in your position.
[1:28:34] Spiritual amnesia. Just need to go a
[1:28:36] little bit more quickly now as song
[1:28:38] service is close to being matched.
[1:28:42] It may have already been. I'm getting
[1:28:44] nervous now.
[1:28:47] And you say now, well, you've you've
[1:28:48] felt nervous. You sounded nervous
[1:28:50] before, but maybe now I am nervous.
[1:28:53] I get nervous when I'm not nervous. So
[1:28:54] now that I'm nervous, I'm not nervous.
[1:28:56] Figure that out.
[1:28:58] The sermon spiritual amnesia. Brother
[1:29:00] man says, "We are identified with our
[1:29:01] families." I know that may make some of
[1:29:03] you cringe, but we are identified with
[1:29:05] our families in this human life. He
[1:29:07] says, "By marriage." So our marriage
[1:29:09] identifies us. I believe this is
[1:29:11] important to remember that as we're
[1:29:12] raised in a family, I am identified with
[1:29:15] my mother and father. And so to my mom
[1:29:17] and dad, their family was identified
[1:29:20] through their marriage. So that was the
[1:29:21] Mciris. And so now what I hope by the
[1:29:24] grace of God through my marriage, I'm
[1:29:26] creating a new identity of Megiris. So I
[1:29:29] don't have to bear the reproach, which
[1:29:31] camera is on right now of Matthew and
[1:29:33] David. [laughter]
[1:29:37] You're identified through your marriage.
[1:29:39] So when a man gets married, he now has a
[1:29:42] new identity. His loyalties aren't to
[1:29:45] mom. His loyalties aren't to dad. Now he
[1:29:46] has a new identity because a man is
[1:29:48] identified in human life through his
[1:29:50] marriage with our wives. He says and our
[1:29:53] family is identified by the union of our
[1:29:55] marriage of our marriage. So when you're
[1:29:57] a child in a home with married parents
[1:30:00] that's your family identity. But when
[1:30:01] you get married it's the union that
[1:30:03] begins to defy a new brand
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; a new name and the son becomes a builder
[1:30:09] of that family name with the new
[1:30:11] identity. So you are you are identified
[1:30:13] by your union.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And a house divided against
[1:30:17] itself, the upsetting of harmony, the
[1:30:20] breaking up of arrangement, the disorder
[1:30:22] cannot stand.
[1:30:24] As a matter of fact, the dividing
[1:30:26] against itself, a word that's used for
[1:30:28] that is contempt.
[1:30:30] You have heard where you know you're
[1:30:33] being held in contempt. Anybody been
[1:30:35] held in contempt in court and sentenced
[1:30:37] to 30 days in municipal jail for
[1:30:39] contempt? Anybody? Where are the
[1:30:40] preacher kids? Let me find out. Have you
[1:30:42] been accused of riot and unruly? I was
[1:30:45] picking on brother Gideon a little bit
[1:30:46] last night. So none of you been held in
[1:30:47] contempt. Neither have I. Even in my
[1:30:49] legal practice, I have not been held in
[1:30:51] contempt. But it means you've upset the
[1:30:52] order.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Things are out of order.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; And they say that one of the biggest
[1:30:58] signs of a divorce is contempt.
[1:31:03] And they look at it as maybe I'm just I
[1:31:05] can't stand what they say. I can't take
[1:31:07] uh you know stand what they do. But it's
[1:31:10] orders broken somewhere.
[1:31:12] You are now divided and a house divided
[1:31:15] cannot stand.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; The division is not the ruin. The
[1:31:19] division is what leads to ruin.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; So if you're divided, it's not, oh, it's
[1:31:23] over. It's no, that's the seeds of
[1:31:25] ultimate ruin.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; So it's at that point where you see that
[1:31:28] we're drifting. There's contempt.
[1:31:30] There's disorder. Something is broken.
[1:31:31] We've got to got to come back together
[1:31:33] and unite. Amen.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; So, let's look at verse 24 where we read
[1:31:39] before because I think we can just take
[1:31:41] one last step here and finish finish
[1:31:44] this morning. I I feel pretty good that
[1:31:46] we finished this morning, especially now
[1:31:48] that it's 12:35
[1:31:50] and Lord willing, we'll finish this
[1:31:52] afternoon.
[1:31:54] In Mark 3:es 24, 25, 26, 27, says, "If a
[1:31:59] kingdom be divided against itself, that
[1:32:01] kingdom cannot stand." And if a house
[1:32:04] div be divided against itself, that
[1:32:06] house cannot stand. Put yourself in
[1:32:08] that. Put that three- room house, the
[1:32:09] gates of heaven. Me as an individual, if
[1:32:12] if I'm torn internally, if I'm divided,
[1:32:14] I'm can't flourish.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; If I make a step and I'm not sure of it,
[1:32:18] I'm going to be wondering, did I make do
[1:32:20] the wrong thing? So, there's got to be
[1:32:21] some there has to be harmony. The Holy
[1:32:23] Spirit on the inside of the inside is
[1:32:25] the control tower. And your spirit gets
[1:32:27] aligned with that, and then your actions
[1:32:29] align, and there's no worry about
[1:32:30] hypocrisy. Same within a family. We
[1:32:33] looked at that unity and that order and
[1:32:34] then by extension that works to the
[1:32:36] house of God.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; You see where we could preach for weeks
[1:32:38] on those subjects.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; And if a house be divided against
[1:32:42] itself, that house cannot stand. And if
[1:32:43] Satan rise up against himself and be
[1:32:45] divided, he cannot stand, but hath an
[1:32:46] end. So the division becomes the
[1:32:48] precursor to the end.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Verse 27, notice this. No man can enter
[1:32:53] into a strong man's house and spoil his
[1:32:55] goods except he will first bind the
[1:32:58] strong man and then he will spoil his
[1:33:00] house. This is the conclusion
[1:33:03] that was based upon this foundation of a
[1:33:05] house being divided against itself
[1:33:07] cannot stand. A house divided cannot
[1:33:09] stand. And Jesus then to amplify that
[1:33:12] and kind of cap it off says no man can
[1:33:15] enter into a strong man's house and
[1:33:17] spoil it and ruin it. Because he's
[1:33:19] talking about something being brought to
[1:33:20] an end. He says, "Satan's house could
[1:33:24] not be um spoiled except one first enter
[1:33:29] into and bind the strong man."
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Hope you're catching this. And then he
[1:33:34] will spoil his house. So this is very
[1:33:36] rich in meaning for us.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Christ entered into Satan's house and he
[1:33:42] bound the one in control under his
[1:33:44] authority and cast out devils. Amen.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; And so binding the strong man divides
[1:33:50] the house.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; That's where division begins. Bind the
[1:33:55] strong man. And that's how you can
[1:33:58] ultimately defile a house and destroy
[1:34:00] it.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; If you can bind the strong man, it
[1:34:02] unravels the strength
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; and that unraveling of the strength. I
[1:34:07] hope that I can amplify this a little
[1:34:08] bit. So I'll make the statement now and
[1:34:09] then I'll try to come and back it up. to
[1:34:12] to bind the strong man is to take that
[1:34:15] strength that it ought to have and cause
[1:34:17] it to bow to the wrong order,
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; to submit to the wrong arrangement.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Binding the strong man, we think, well,
[1:34:24] we put him in shackles, but really all
[1:34:25] you have to do is create a different
[1:34:27] subjection,
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; create a different order.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; You bind the strong man when he ought to
[1:34:32] be submitted to one thing, but now he
[1:34:34] submits to another.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; You bind the strong man by getting him
[1:34:38] out of his place, because then that
[1:34:39] divides the order. Amen.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; So I want you to think deeply. The div
[1:34:43] the division begins when we get out of
[1:34:45] place.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; So if you can bind what gives any house
[1:34:49] its power, you can divide it and you can
[1:34:51] ruin it.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; In other words, Jesus could not have
[1:34:54] come in and cast out devils unless first
[1:34:57] the prince of devils, unless first Satan
[1:34:59] was bound and had no power and then he
[1:35:02] could rid that house of those evil
[1:35:04] spirits.
[1:35:07] The word bound
[1:35:09] here it means one
[1:35:12] who is under.
[1:35:14] You have to bind the strong man. This
[1:35:16] word means one who's under a lord to
[1:35:18] give service. So you're bound to service
[1:35:19] or loyalty.
[1:35:21] So to bind the strong man is to bring
[1:35:24] him under the power of another.
[1:35:27] This word is used in other places. says
[1:35:29] in Luke 13 11 it says, "And behold,
[1:35:31] there was a woman which had a spirit of
[1:35:32] an infirmity 18 years and was bowed
[1:35:35] together and could in no wise lift
[1:35:37] herself up." The infirmity made her bend
[1:35:41] forward. It was she was bowing under the
[1:35:44] weight of that sickness.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Caused her to be uh bowed in Luke 11
[1:35:48] 13:16. And ought not this woman being a
[1:35:50] daughter of Abraham whom Satan hath
[1:35:52] bound lo these 18 years be loosed from
[1:35:55] this bond on the Sabbath day. So look at
[1:35:58] it this way. We I know Jesus says, "I am
[1:36:01] the one who entered into Satan's house.
[1:36:02] I bound the strong man and cast him
[1:36:04] out." But he said, "If a house is
[1:36:06] divided against itself, it cannot
[1:36:08] stand." And he gives us this one-s
[1:36:10] sentence look into how this can happen.
[1:36:12] Just bind the strong man and you can
[1:36:13] spoil the house. So we want to learn
[1:36:15] from that.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; We're not looking at the anatomy of a
[1:36:18] devil being cast out, but we're looking
[1:36:19] at the anat anatomy and the autopsy of
[1:36:22] houses that fail.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. of unions that that break. Satan
[1:36:27] in these verses, Luke 13, he had put a
[1:36:29] woman under a bind. He had bound her.
[1:36:32] And what did Christ do? He loosed the
[1:36:35] bond.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; He broke the tire, that chain.
[1:36:39] So, I I I'm bringing this to a close. As
[1:36:42] a matter of fact, I want you to begin to
[1:36:44] anticipate that musicians may shortly be
[1:36:46] on the platform.
[1:36:48] I have just created without artificial
[1:36:52] intelligence a new turning point in a
[1:36:54] service. Usually we say if the musicians
[1:36:57] would come,
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; right? But now I'm saying that I will be
[1:37:01] in the future inviting the musicians to
[1:37:03] come
[1:37:05] thereby creating anticipation of a
[1:37:07] close.
[1:37:11] But Bethl, if we're talking about
[1:37:12] building a Bethl,
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; it's spoiled when we're bound
[1:37:17] by another power. When another power
[1:37:20] bows us down,
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; says, "Bind the strong man."
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; The strong man of the house, it's the
[1:37:27] man of strength in a house. And if we're
[1:37:30] looking at an individual, that should be
[1:37:31] the husband.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; So the the easiest way to put a bind on
[1:37:36] a house, the easiest way to create
[1:37:37] disunity is bind the strong man.
[1:37:40] Bind the husband, bind the master of the
[1:37:43] house. And in doing so, that bond even
[1:37:47] needs to to cause to grow the husband,
[1:37:50] that band. It means to cause to grow,
[1:37:52] bind the strong man.
[1:37:56] If the husband is under a different
[1:37:58] influence other than the headship of
[1:37:59] Jesus Christ, then that gives rise to
[1:38:02] the influence of the world.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:05] It's that through which through that
[1:38:07] power alone.
[1:38:09] It's just a gradual step out of place in
[1:38:12] room enough to work.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; First Corinthians 11:3. But I would have
[1:38:18] you to know that the head of every man
[1:38:19] is Christ and the head of every woman is
[1:38:21] the man and the head of Christ is God.
[1:38:24] There's God's order.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "The head of Christ is
[1:38:29] God." And Jesus says, "When you seen me,
[1:38:30] you've seen God." And the father was in
[1:38:33] him. And Jesus did nothing but what the
[1:38:35] father told him to do. There was that
[1:38:37] union and that harmony expressed between
[1:38:38] the father and the son. That same
[1:38:41] dynamic now works between the bride and
[1:38:43] Christ where it's together. It's mutual
[1:38:45] dependency. We're finishing his work.
[1:38:48] And so there's headship. God is the head
[1:38:50] of Christ. Christ ought to be the head
[1:38:52] of every man because the man is to be
[1:38:55] the head of the woman. And if Christ
[1:38:57] isn't the head of the man, but he
[1:38:58] maintains headship over the woman, that
[1:39:00] breaks headship. It moves it into a
[1:39:03] different category where it's by
[1:39:05] hierarchy alone. It's by gender alone
[1:39:07] that he's now been made the head. But
[1:39:09] man is the proper head of the woman when
[1:39:11] Christ is the head of him.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Man should be the physical and spiritual
[1:39:16] protector and provider of his wife and
[1:39:19] his family.
[1:39:21] And so when you compromise the strong
[1:39:24] man, then you can weaken the unity of
[1:39:27] the family.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; And and I know that uh I'm not trying to
[1:39:31] alienate my friends here today as being
[1:39:35] husbands and fathers in their homes, but
[1:39:37] I do think that that's where we can
[1:39:38] start
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; is as a strong man. But there is even a
[1:39:42] spiritual application of Jesus, the word
[1:39:44] Christ being the strong man in the home.
[1:39:47] And that if he when he leaves your home,
[1:39:49] trouble's on the way.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; If he doesn't have place,
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; if his spirit's not welcome.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; And so there is power in that the unit
[1:39:58] of the husband and wife, the father and
[1:40:00] the mother. Brother Brandham said in the
[1:40:02] world has fallen apart. He said the
[1:40:03] beautiful virtue that God gave a woman
[1:40:04] to be a mother has been marred and
[1:40:07] that's the backbone of the nation.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; You break motherhood and you've broke
[1:40:11] the nation. Right? Then
[1:40:14] he said that's what holds it together is
[1:40:17] real genuine parenthood.
[1:40:20] The condition of the nation today, the
[1:40:22] sin that's reflected in the nation
[1:40:23] today. This ought to be a comfort to
[1:40:25] everyone here. If I've mentioned this
[1:40:26] before, it's by means of repetition that
[1:40:28] I believe is reinforced and I believe
[1:40:30] other ministers uh here are certainly
[1:40:32] more capable of teaching these things
[1:40:33] than myself. But don't let the
[1:40:35] familiarity uh water down just how
[1:40:37] impactful this is. But brother Brandham
[1:40:39] is saying that the the worldly
[1:40:41] condition, the perverted condition of
[1:40:43] the world today is a result of the
[1:40:45] family unit being broken.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Like, oh, I'm afraid to raise kids in
[1:40:50] this world. Well, only be afraid if
[1:40:52] you're not committed to a good strong
[1:40:54] family unit.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Because if the cause of the worldliness
[1:40:58] is a broken family unit, the cure for
[1:41:00] the worldliness is a strong family unit.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; The protection from the worldliness is a
[1:41:06] strong family unit. How did the filth
[1:41:08] get into the church? You broke the
[1:41:10] family. How did the filth get into the
[1:41:11] markets? You begin to break down these
[1:41:13] other elements that make up society.
[1:41:16] Society didn't get together one day and
[1:41:18] say, "I think we should just get more
[1:41:19] worldly."
[1:41:21] And then society began to get more
[1:41:22] worldly and families started saying, "We
[1:41:24] want to be like society." No. Families
[1:41:26] begin to get worldly and it permeates
[1:41:28] into society. The world looks the way it
[1:41:30] does. The world looks the way it does
[1:41:32] today when Christ was kicked out of the
[1:41:34] church.
[1:41:35] Yeah.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; How was Christ kicked out of the church?
[1:41:37] Individuals and families developed a
[1:41:40] taste for fanaticism
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; in isms and humanity
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; and they went chasing after their
[1:41:45] traditions and Christ was kicked out of
[1:41:47] the church. So what's the way to
[1:41:49] strengthen your your home from world?
[1:41:51] Invite Christ back in.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Strong family units are the cure, the
[1:41:55] inoculation, the strength and the
[1:41:56] defense to the worldliness that's on the
[1:41:58] outside. It's the strength of a church.
[1:42:02] the sermon thirsting for life. He says
[1:42:03] that's what breaks up homes. That's what
[1:42:05] spoils children. That's what makes
[1:42:06] neurotics.
[1:42:08] That's what makes teenage delinquency is
[1:42:10] when motherhood and fatherhood is broke.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; The crisis we have today of mental
[1:42:15] health and the crisis we have today of
[1:42:17] all these social problems and identity
[1:42:19] issues, it comes back and it traces back
[1:42:21] to the defiling of the family unit.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; The upsetting of the order of not just a
[1:42:27] a leave it to Beaver, Mr. Clever type
[1:42:29] look. It's not um father knows best
[1:42:32] look. It's not what Holly would present,
[1:42:33] but it's the image of the scripture.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's that picture that we see in
[1:42:38] the word of God that says how a man
[1:42:39] ought to treat his wife and how a wife
[1:42:41] ought to reverence her husband and the
[1:42:43] way that they work together submitted
[1:42:44] one to another and they create this
[1:42:46] dynamic in the home where there's mutual
[1:42:48] respect and there's a passion for their
[1:42:50] children and they love one another and
[1:42:51] they love their children's hearts and
[1:42:53] they want to cultivate them to grow up
[1:42:54] to be decent uh uh uh children and human
[1:42:57] beings of integrity and honesty with
[1:42:59] virtue and character and we're all in
[1:43:01] this together. But if you begin to break
[1:43:03] down that structure, that biblical
[1:43:05] structure within the home, that's what
[1:43:06] you get on the outside.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; And listen, I don't mean to get caught
[1:43:10] sideways here and and brother Jason,
[1:43:13] just tackle me if you need to,
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; but there's so much
[1:43:19] uh so many lies spread on social media
[1:43:22] about trades.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; You're going to make me start preaching.
[1:43:28] and this image of a a an alpha male in
[1:43:31] the home. And it's nothing more than a
[1:43:34] perversion
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; because they've tried to create the the
[1:43:37] appearance of a traditional wife and an
[1:43:40] alpha male without having the alpha and
[1:43:42] omega in the relationship.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; They don't they they are using tradition
[1:43:47] to make the word of God an effect. But
[1:43:48] I'm just happy being a submissive wife
[1:43:50] at home. It looks nothing like the
[1:43:52] scripture would have a wife to be. Amen.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; And so there is this there is a little
[1:43:58] bit of a an upswelling of morality and
[1:44:01] traditional virtues and Christianity and
[1:44:03] it has a rise within a political a
[1:44:05] political reign. And let me say this, if
[1:44:07] you think it's just brother brother
[1:44:09] Aaron's opinion, the antichrist presents
[1:44:12] more as Republican than he does
[1:44:13] Democrat.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; There I said it.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; I'm free.
[1:44:20] [laughter]
[1:44:22] and I don't have to worry about getting
[1:44:23] assassinated.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; But it's that false religion.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; It it's this pretense. It's with the
[1:44:33] lips.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; But they have the same motive and
[1:44:35] objective
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; of power and control.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; But what breaks up homes? What's caused
[1:44:42] spoiled children and made neurotics? Why
[1:44:44] do we live in this anxious age that we
[1:44:46] do now? Why is there so much delinquency
[1:44:48] and a lack of even of decency? We broke
[1:44:52] motherhood and fatherhood.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; It's a a lack of respectability,
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; hypocrisy. That's how you break
[1:44:59] motherhood. You become a hypocrite.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; That's how you break fatherhood is you
[1:45:02] become a hypocrite.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; It's where there's selfish ambition in
[1:45:06] the father, selfish ambition in the
[1:45:08] mother. This inability to feel for one
[1:45:09] another, for their spouses, for their
[1:45:11] children. They make things about
[1:45:13] themselves. It's uh they become uh
[1:45:15] they're no longer self-aware where they
[1:45:17] impose restraints and restrictions on
[1:45:19] everyone else, but they can indulge
[1:45:20] themselves. There and listen, it there's
[1:45:23] there's way too much to be able to try
[1:45:25] to address it all in one sermon. I could
[1:45:27] speak without end on these issues now,
[1:45:29] but I'm so glad that it's been diagnosed
[1:45:31] through a prophetic lens to say the
[1:45:33] problem is a lack of alignment and
[1:45:35] harmony with the word of God in these
[1:45:38] positions and offices.
[1:45:42] So, I'll say this, musicians, if you'd
[1:45:43] come, it has begun.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; We cannot, we must not allow ourselves,
[1:45:52] no matter who we are,
[1:45:57] we must not allow ourselves to be
[1:45:59] subject to the world.
[1:46:01] We have to individually purpose that I I
[1:46:03] am going to I'm going to put God first.
[1:46:07] That was what we ministered on last
[1:46:08] night. our first duties to God, the next
[1:46:10] duties to our family. I'm the third. And
[1:46:13] your first duty to God is then to offer
[1:46:15] up your body as a living sacrifice that
[1:46:17] your soul would become a temple for God.
[1:46:19] So it's not to put family first without
[1:46:21] a new birth experience and say, "Well, I
[1:46:23] was just so busy serving the church and
[1:46:24] serving my family. I never had time to
[1:46:26] get the Holy Ghost." No, you put God
[1:46:28] first. That means he dwells in you by
[1:46:30] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And then
[1:46:32] you put your family second. You're
[1:46:34] third. All your ambitions, all your
[1:46:36] plans, all your dreams, all your
[1:46:38] individual idiosyncrasies, those are
[1:46:40] third. I have to see how I can serve God
[1:46:43] first and then my family through that
[1:46:44] service to God. We touched on how God
[1:46:47] would never call you to serve the church
[1:46:50] at at the sake of losing your family.
[1:46:56] Now, following Christ may cause you to
[1:46:59] lose your family.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; But what we've done is we've substituted
[1:47:02] service to church for service to Christ.
[1:47:05] And our families suffer because we we
[1:47:07] were serving the church. We were at our
[1:47:09] post of duty. Meanwhile, families are
[1:47:11] falling apart. And you say, "Well, if
[1:47:12] man's not willing to leave father and
[1:47:14] mother and wife and brother and sister
[1:47:16] and we've completely confused what the
[1:47:17] gospel is and what Christ's sake is,
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; and we've made it just church.
[1:47:22] And we really get it upset and we get it
[1:47:24] turned upside down. But we must be
[1:47:26] submitted to the word of God. In Luke
[1:47:29] chapter 24, it's on the road to Emmas
[1:47:32] that those disciples that begin to walk,
[1:47:34] it got towards evening and Christ has
[1:47:36] opened up the word and they said, "Abide
[1:47:38] with us toward evening. The day is far
[1:47:40] spent." And and so Jesus went into their
[1:47:43] home. That's what that's what we're
[1:47:45] wanting to do, right? Wanting to invite
[1:47:46] Jesus Christ into our home.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Lord, I invite you into my heart. I
[1:47:50] invite you into my family unit, my
[1:47:52] house, my apartment, my cottage,
[1:47:54] whatever it might be. Lord, I I want you
[1:47:56] to make my house a home. I want your
[1:47:58] presence to be welcome. I want it to be
[1:48:00] a place, yeah, we we we maybe have
[1:48:02] family movie night and we play games and
[1:48:04] there's certain things that we enjoy to
[1:48:05] do. We let our kids do and our house, we
[1:48:08] just we live in our house. We're
[1:48:09] ourselves and it can get messy. But I
[1:48:11] want it to be a place where if anytime
[1:48:12] we need to turn to the word, we can do
[1:48:14] that. and that we have times that we do
[1:48:17] do it in the evenings for devotions,
[1:48:18] maybe in the morning, but we pray and
[1:48:20] and sermons are being shared. I I I love
[1:48:23] um I love I know this may be a
[1:48:26] triggering word, but family chats can be
[1:48:28] very triggering for people. And so we
[1:48:31] have a we have a family text group with
[1:48:33] just me and my family identified by the
[1:48:35] union that I have with Sister Elizabeth.
[1:48:37] And in that we have our children are in
[1:48:39] there and we have in that family there's
[1:48:42] more quotes shared from the sermons my
[1:48:44] children are listening to than memes.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Now we might respond with a meme to the
[1:48:49] quote but you know it's it's there. The
[1:48:53] words being lifted up and the
[1:48:56] opportunity it's he's welcome. That's
[1:48:57] what our goal is,
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; right? Is for him to be welcome. Not
[1:49:00] imposed, not forced, but welcome.
[1:49:04] And so they constrained him to stay
[1:49:06] stay. And it came to pass as he sat with
[1:49:08] meat with them, he took bread and
[1:49:11] blessed it and break and gave to them.
[1:49:15] And it was then that their eyes were
[1:49:16] open and they knew him and he vanished
[1:49:17] out of their sight. And what's
[1:49:20] remarkable about this story is when they
[1:49:21] went in verse 35, they're now saying
[1:49:23] that, "Oh, Jesus came and he made
[1:49:25] himself known to us. This is what they
[1:49:26] say." And they told him the things that
[1:49:27] were done in the way. Verse 35, and how
[1:49:29] he was made known of them in breaking of
[1:49:33] bread.
[1:49:35] Jesus Christ was known by breaking
[1:49:37] [music] bread.
[1:49:39] And why was it that he was known when
[1:49:41] bread was broke? We know that he did
[1:49:44] something he had done before.
[1:49:47] But it wasn't just the bread that was
[1:49:49] being broken. And whenever someone would
[1:49:51] break bread, they I remember Jesus broke
[1:49:53] bread. But who was it that broke the
[1:49:55] bread? Master.
[1:49:58] And when he broke bread, he did
[1:49:59] something in their home
[1:50:02] that the head of the house would
[1:50:03] normally do. When you're invited into
[1:50:06] someone's home, how many of you on
[1:50:07] turkey day here most recently went into
[1:50:09] someone's home and after brother Aaron
[1:50:11] had smoked a nice turkey, I'm glad
[1:50:13] there's another brother Aaron that
[1:50:14] smokes. So now I have a partner,
[1:50:17] a brother Aaron that smokes. And so if
[1:50:18] anybody ever accuses me of smoking, I
[1:50:20] said, "Oh, no, no, that's not me. That's
[1:50:21] that's another brother." He goes to
[1:50:22] brother, he plays the bass in brother
[1:50:24] Jason's church. [laughter]
[1:50:28] You smoke a turkey and you have
[1:50:29] everything ready and the guest you
[1:50:31] brought in, hey, why don't you come?
[1:50:32] They go over there, they just kind of
[1:50:33] get in the way and they start carving
[1:50:34] the turkey. No, it's reserved for the
[1:50:36] head of the house.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; So, the breaking of the bread was an act
[1:50:39] only performed by the head of the
[1:50:42] household.
[1:50:44] And so, what did what did Jesus
[1:50:45] demonstrate in that moment? And what did
[1:50:47] what did these strange these disciples
[1:50:49] allow Christ to be? To become the head
[1:50:51] of the household.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; And he broke bread. And when he broke
[1:50:55] bread in that house,
[1:50:57] they he was declaring himself to be the
[1:51:00] master in the head. And that is what we
[1:51:03] can do to be a Bethl. Lord, break your
[1:51:05] bread in me.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; That's what he can do in our homes. He
[1:51:08] can be the one that takes control. He
[1:51:09] breaks the bread. That's what he ought
[1:51:10] to be in Bethl is it's a place where
[1:51:12] God's bread is broken. The word of God
[1:51:15] has preeminence. All these other things
[1:51:16] that we do as a church are there to
[1:51:18] create this kind of atmosphere and have
[1:51:21] everyone in their place where they sit
[1:51:22] spellbound by the word that's going
[1:51:24] forth.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; That's why we have service time that we
[1:51:28] do. That's why we come early and pray.
[1:51:29] That's why these musicians sacrifice
[1:51:31] throughout the week. That's why there's
[1:51:32] effort put into making the sound just
[1:51:34] right and everything. It's so that
[1:51:35] Christ can come as the head of Bethl and
[1:51:37] break bread.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; And so he wants to break bread in you
[1:51:41] personally as you read your Bible and
[1:51:43] pray. wants to break bread in your
[1:51:44] family homes as you have a family altar
[1:51:46] as you fellowship with one another. Let
[1:51:47] Christ demonstrate his headship.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; That's the order that we need more than
[1:51:53] ever before. Let Christ come and break
[1:51:55] bread
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; as the head of the house. Don't let that
[1:51:58] one be bound. Amen.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; And in Joshua chapter 24, as we read
[1:52:03] yesterday,
[1:52:04] verses 14 to1 17, he says, "Fear the
[1:52:06] Lord and serve him in sincerity and in
[1:52:08] truth, and put away the gods which your
[1:52:09] fathers served on the other side of the
[1:52:11] flood and in Egypt and serve ye the
[1:52:13] Lord."
[1:52:16] We say, "Well, the gods of Egypt were
[1:52:17] buried and the army was uh uh buried in
[1:52:20] the sea. We're we're in a new land." But
[1:52:22] now he says, "And if it seem evil to you
[1:52:23] to serve the Lord, choose you this day
[1:52:25] whom you'll serve, whether the gods
[1:52:27] which your fathers served that are on
[1:52:28] the other side of the flood or the gods
[1:52:31] of the Amorites in whose land you
[1:52:32] dwell." Listen, as children raised in
[1:52:34] this message, we may not go back to
[1:52:36] serve denominational gods that our
[1:52:38] parents came out of, but there's plenty
[1:52:39] of Amorites in this land that we're in.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; And he says, "But as for me, in my
[1:52:44] house, we will serve the Lord."
[1:52:48] That was Joshua's commitment.
[1:52:52] at the point at which we're going to
[1:52:53] possess this land. And it had to it
[1:52:56] wasn't a matter of consecrating the
[1:52:58] land. It was a matter of consecrating me
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; and my house.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; As for me and my house, we'll serve the
[1:53:04] Lord. And the people answered. Listen to
[1:53:07] what how the people answer. God forbid
[1:53:09] that we should forsake the Lord to serve
[1:53:10] other gods.
[1:53:14] For the Lord our God,
[1:53:16] he it is that brought us up and our
[1:53:19] fathers out of the land of Egypt from
[1:53:21] the house of bondage.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; So what are they identifying? To
[1:53:27] continue to serve gods in their promised
[1:53:30] land would bring them under the same
[1:53:32] servitude they had in Egypt.
[1:53:35] That service to other gods is bondage.
[1:53:38] That's how you bind the strong man of
[1:53:40] the house. He says, "Choose you this day
[1:53:41] whom you'll serve. Who will you labor
[1:53:42] for? Who will you work for? Who will you
[1:53:44] be subject to?
[1:53:47] I believe that each one of us can say or
[1:53:49] what I'd like to challenge you on this
[1:53:51] whole subject of building building Bethl
[1:53:53] is challenge yourself. I will not let
[1:53:55] the strong man to be bound.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Because if he can be bound, that will
[1:54:00] weaken me.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; If he can be bound, it'll weaken my
[1:54:03] family. If he can be bound, it'll weaken
[1:54:04] the church.
[1:54:06] If the if the message could be somehow
[1:54:08] distilled down to uh to a sound bite,
[1:54:11] maybe sound bite's the wrong word, but
[1:54:13] just to some theme, it it in a final
[1:54:16] analysis, it's the unchaining and the
[1:54:18] loosening of Christ.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; The one that had been covered by creeds
[1:54:23] and dog, the one that had been bound by
[1:54:24] denominational changes, the one that had
[1:54:26] been kicked out. It's a restoration that
[1:54:28] this Bible is our absolute and you can
[1:54:30] trust it and count it as the word of
[1:54:31] God. That's how the Bible became a new
[1:54:33] book. So now that when we look into it,
[1:54:35] we're seeing the face of God. We're
[1:54:37] seeing a mirror image of Jesus Christ in
[1:54:39] ourselves.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; And so it's letting Christ be free. Do
[1:54:43] not let Christ be bound. Do not let
[1:54:45] yourselves be bound.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; It's a deliberate decision to allow your
[1:54:50] heart to be established as a house for
[1:54:53] God, your homes to be a home for heaven,
[1:54:56] to let God's promises be your
[1:54:59] foundation.
[1:55:01] That's our That's what we can do to
[1:55:03] build Bethl.
[1:55:06] Let's stand to our feet.
[1:55:12] Let's pray together.
[1:55:21] What key are you in?
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Can you put it in G? Maybe we I don't
[1:55:25] know if you sang worthy of it all in G.
[1:55:27] I know [music] it works in G, but maybe
[1:55:29] we could just sing that he's worthy of
[1:55:31] worthy of all that we have to give him.
[1:55:33] But let's just pray together.
[1:55:36] Our gracious heavenly father,
[1:55:39] Lord, in this afternoon as it begins to
[1:55:41] get later in the day and we've taken our
[1:55:44] liberty today to expound upon things
[1:55:46] that are very relevant and feeling
[1:55:49] pressed to do so in a way that was uh
[1:55:52] relatable and and applicable. I ask
[1:55:56] Father that you hear our hearts cry now
[1:55:57] from individuals, young people, young
[1:56:01] married couples and families and this
[1:56:03] church.
[1:56:04] Lord, if a name means something, if
[1:56:07] Ricky and Rquetta carried with it a
[1:56:09] negative connotation of these ways that
[1:56:12] we can use these nicknames and they
[1:56:13] [music] carry with them spirits, if a
[1:56:15] name refers to a person's character,
[1:56:19] then by calling this church Bethl,
[1:56:23] it means something, Lord.
[1:56:26] And it's reflective of what every single
[1:56:28] one of us ought to be,
[1:56:30] a living tabernacle for the living God.
[1:56:33] And so Lord, I pray for the individuals
[1:56:35] that make up this church, the families,
[1:56:37] the individuals that make up families
[1:56:38] and the families that make up this
[1:56:40] church that we could just now in our
[1:56:42] hearts maybe without
[1:56:45] this precise detailing, but just as a a
[1:56:49] vision, as a overarching theme, Lord, I
[1:56:51] I want to commit myself.
[1:56:54] I have a duty to make the inside right
[1:56:56] by the grace of God. And so Lord, I want
[1:56:59] to commit myself, make a deliberate
[1:57:00] decision to be a dwelling place of your
[1:57:02] presence. I want to make a deliberate
[1:57:04] pre uh decision to be in my place, to be
[1:57:06] arranged properly, to find the gifts
[1:57:09] that you're cultivating, the position
[1:57:10] that you'd want me to be in,
[1:57:13] Lord, so that I could begin to thrive
[1:57:14] spiritually as an individual and
[1:57:16] thereby, Lord, be a better husband and a
[1:57:18] better father and our family units could
[1:57:20] begin to thrive. And then as our family
[1:57:22] units begin to thrive around your
[1:57:24] presence in our homes, it just adds to
[1:57:26] this church. And then this church can
[1:57:29] begin to grow through character
[1:57:31] development, begin to grow through souls
[1:57:33] being saved from off the streets because
[1:57:35] they're meeting Bethls all over town. So
[1:57:38] Lord, I commit the people to you now. We
[1:57:40] give our lives to you. All that we are.
[1:57:43] Lord, I don't just give you my dress. I
[1:57:45] don't just give you my haircut. I'm not
[1:57:47] giving you my language and the movies I
[1:57:49] watch. Lord, I'm going to give you my
[1:57:50] heart. Give you my body. I'm going to
[1:57:52] give you my mind. I'm giving you what I
[1:57:54] am on the inside. Lord, just as
[1:57:56] revelation from out is an impossibility
[1:57:59] that it has to happen within. May it
[1:58:01] please you to reveal your son in me
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; so that it can be done in me. So, I give
[1:58:07] you myself. I I give you my heart that
[1:58:10] you're worthy of this offering of my
[1:58:12] soul. Now, I just surrender. And I'm not
[1:58:14] worried about what the outside's going
[1:58:15] to look like. I'm not worried about what
[1:58:16] my home's going to look like. I'm not
[1:58:18] worried about what church is going to
[1:58:19] look like. I just know if I can be a
[1:58:21] Bethl,
[1:58:22] if I be a dwelling place of your power
[1:58:24] and your glory, Lord, from there peace
[1:58:26] will reign. I'll be safe and I'll be
[1:58:28] secure. Let hell and high water come.
[1:58:31] I'm safe in your arms.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; And Lord, may we stand as individuals,
[1:58:36] strong and secure,
[1:58:39] in a peaceable habitation, a sure
[1:58:41] dwelling, a quiet resting place because
[1:58:43] you're there. You found home in my
[1:58:45] heart.
[1:58:47] And Lord, may it just flow from there to
[1:58:48] these other gates of heaven.
[1:58:51] May we be a heaven on earth. May this
[1:58:52] church be a heaven on earth. May these
[1:58:54] homes be a heaven on earth.
[1:58:56] Lord, for brother Jason and sister
[1:58:58] Debbie, [music] they're moved into a a
[1:59:01] church cottage, Lord, that has housed
[1:59:03] many weary travelers and ministers and
[1:59:06] families. Lord, Lord, may it be
[1:59:08] dedicated and set aside for them that
[1:59:10] give service to this church so near to
[1:59:13] the place that they've committed and
[1:59:15] dedicated their lives and they've cried
[1:59:17] and they've bled and they've been
[1:59:18] wounded and they've served and they've
[1:59:19] given and they given. But Lord, pour out
[1:59:22] your presence upon them in this little
[1:59:24] place, Lord. In this dwelling, may it be
[1:59:27] a quiet resting place. May it be a
[1:59:30] peaceable habitation. May it be a sure
[1:59:32] dwelling. Not because it's of its
[1:59:34] proximity to the church, but despite its
[1:59:36] proximity, Lord, not because it's such a
[1:59:39] beautiful, expansive, vast uh mansion,
[1:59:42] but Lord, because you're there. You're
[1:59:44] the lifter of their head. You're the
[1:59:47] you're they're you're the calm in the
[1:59:48] midst of the storm. You're the the rock
[1:59:50] and the shadow in a weary land. You're
[1:59:52] the high place above our enemies. Lord,
[1:59:54] I pray that you would grant it to each
[1:59:56] one of us that we could find solace in
[1:59:58] you and that when we return home today,
[2:00:00] we could have Lord, you promise me that
[2:00:02] this home could be a sanctuary. Lord, I
[2:00:05] don't have to leave church to go to a
[2:00:07] sanctuary. But I'm going from sanctuary
[2:00:09] to sanctuary. Let us purpose to apply
[2:00:12] the token. Make our hearts a sanctuary.
[2:00:14] Make our homes a sanctuary. So that when
[2:00:16] we come to this sanctuary, it's the
[2:00:18] omnipotence meeting in an omnipotence
[2:00:21] gathering.
[2:00:22] have your way we pray Lord as
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; we commit it to you in the name of the
[2:00:26] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:31] And you are worthy of it all.
[2:00:37] Just worship him now.
[2:00:40] You are worthy of it all.
[2:00:45] [singing]
[2:00:48] Well, from you are [music and singing]
[2:00:50] all things,

[2:02:16] they bow before. [music]
[2:02:20] If this is what's in heaven, then what
[2:02:22] ought to be reflected here. Oh,
[2:02:24] [music and singing]
[2:02:25] and all the elers
[2:02:29] cast
[2:02:30] their [music] crowns before the lamb

[2:03:03] Sing it again. Hey, don't be afraid of
[2:03:06] him now. Give him your all. Oh,
[2:03:10] you are [music] worthy of it all.
[2:03:15] Yes, Lord.
[2:03:17] Oh, you are worthy [music]
[2:03:20] of it all.
[2:03:25] Oh, for from [music] you are all things.
[2:03:35] You deserve the [music] glory. Sing the
[2:03:38] first verse again. What's in heaven is
[2:03:40] being done on earth. Oh,
[2:03:44] and all the saints [music]
[2:03:48] and angels [singing]
[2:03:52] they bow [music] before
[2:03:55] your throne.

[2:04:08] the land. Oh, come on. Loosen those
[2:04:11] vocal cords, [music] Bethl. Sing us the
[2:04:13] house of God.
[2:04:16] Yes, he's worthy. [music]
[2:04:18] Oh. [singing]
[2:04:21] Oh, you are worthy of
[2:04:23] [music and singing]
[2:04:24] it all.

[2:04:31] you are all things
[2:04:34] and to you [music] are all. Oh, you

[2:07:43] billion creatures catch your breath.

[2:07:49] Oh, evolving in pursuit of what you
[2:07:55] said.
[2:07:58] And if all of nature reveals

[2:10:04] Hallelujah.

[2:10:20] I've got nothing [music] new.
[2:10:26] How could I express
[2:10:31] all my gratitude? [music]
[2:10:37] I could sing these songs
[2:10:43] as I often [music and singing]
[2:10:44] do.
[2:10:48] The every song must end [music]
[2:10:54] and you never do. So lift up your hands.
[2:10:58] Oh, [music and singing]
[2:10:59] so I throw up my hands
[2:11:02] and praise you again and again.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; is all that I have. Listen, despite how
[2:11:12] hard it's been, thank him for it. Thank
[2:11:14] him for his [music] presence. Thank him
[2:11:16] for his grace. Hallelujah. [singing]
[2:11:21] [music]
[2:11:22] And I know it's [singing] not much, but
[2:11:25] I'm nothing else fit for a king. [music]
[2:11:30] [singing] Oh, except for a heart singing
[2:11:34] [music] hallelujah.

[2:11:40] Hallelujah.

[2:12:24] [music] of those love. Oh, get up and
[2:12:28] pray. Sing it one more time. You're
[2:12:31] going to need boldness to hit those
[2:12:32] doors. [music] Oh, [singing]
[2:12:35] so come on my soul. Oh, don't you get
[2:12:39] [music] shy on me. Lift up your song cuz
[2:12:43] you got a lion [music]
[2:12:46] inside of those. Oh, get up and praise
[2:12:51] [music] the Lord.
[2:12:55] Oh,
[2:12:56] so I [music and singing] throw up my
[2:12:58] hand. Oh, and praise you again, [music]
[2:13:03] again and again and again. Oh, all that
[2:13:08] [music] hallelujah.
[2:13:13] Oh, hallelujah. [music and singing]
[2:13:18] Oh, and I know it's not much. I'm
[2:13:22] nothing else fit [music] for a king.
[2:13:27] Oh, [singing] except for a heart singing
[2:13:30] [music] hallelujah.
[2:13:32] [singing]
[2:13:36] Hallelu. [music]
[2:13:37] [singing]
[2:13:42] I want to sing the bridge again, but I
[2:13:44] just feel to impress [music] something
[2:13:46] on you before I turn it over to your
[2:13:47] pastor or whoever's taking the service.
[2:13:50] The devil would want you to be afraid to
[2:13:52] leave.
[2:13:53] Why? Because, well, [music] it just felt
[2:13:55] so good to be in Bethl. But you are
[2:13:57] Bethl.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; Your home is a Bethl. You're not leaving
[2:14:01] this sanctuary to uh to to return to a
[2:14:04] place where there is no sanctuary.
[2:14:05] You're going to go from one sanctuary
[2:14:06] [music] to another. And you're a
[2:14:07] sanctuary in between.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; And so, if you feel the least bit timid
[2:14:12] or shaken or fearful or worried about
[2:14:15] what the future holds, come on my soul.
[2:14:17] Yes.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; Don't you get [music] shy of me.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; It's not a matter of praise while we're
[2:14:22] singing it beautifully right now. But
[2:14:23] when you leave, you got a lion, Jesus
[2:14:26] Christ [music]
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; inside of you. And because the lion's in
[2:14:29] you, you can be a lamb in whatever in
[2:14:30] different situations. And I think about
[2:14:32] you young people, the young married
[2:14:34] couples. I have a just a deep love for
[2:14:36] brother Jason's family and his children.
[2:14:38] Brother Matthew and his children. Got to
[2:14:40] know his family. I said, "Don't be
[2:14:41] afraid of what the future holds." And
[2:14:44] you've got Christ on the inside. [music]
[2:14:46] and and the world is in its oppositions
[2:14:48] and its questions and everything we
[2:14:50] face. Let you've got a lion inside of
[2:14:53] your bones. [music] And so don't get up.
[2:14:56] Get up and praise the Lord.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; I'm going to stand as a a Bethl. I'm a
[2:15:00] rock that's been stood up erect and a
[2:15:02] vast desert of Leodysia. And the
[2:15:04] anointing oil has been poured over me.
[2:15:06] And I'm nothing but a gate of heaven.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; I'm a dwelling place of the living God.
[2:15:10] And I'm not afraid of what tomorrow
[2:15:12] holds. I'm not afraid of the future
[2:15:14] persecution. I'm not afraid of the
[2:15:15] stress. I'm not afraid of the the
[2:15:17] physical words. I'm not afraid of
[2:15:18] everything because I know in me is Jesus
[2:15:20] Christ and I want my voice to be heard.
[2:15:24] So come on my soul.
[2:15:27] Don't you get shy on me. Lift [music] up
[2:15:30] your song cuz you've got a lion inside
[2:15:35] of those lungs. Get up and praise the
[2:15:40] Lord. [singing]
[2:15:42] [music]
[2:15:45] Oh, and come on my soul. Oh, don't you
[2:15:49] get shy on me. Lift [music and singing]
[2:15:51] up your song. Cuz you've got a lion
[2:15:56] inside [singing] of those lungs. Oh, get
[2:15:59] up and praise [music] the Lord.
[2:16:02] [singing]
[2:16:03] Come on my soul. Come on my soul.
[2:16:05] [music] Oh, and come on my [singing]
[2:16:08] soul. Oh, don't you get shy on me.
[2:16:13] [music]
[2:16:14] Oh, cuz you got a lion inside [music]
[2:16:19] of those lungs.
[2:16:21] Get up and praise the Lord.
[2:16:26] [music and singing]
[2:16:28] So I throw up my hands. I'm going to
[2:16:32] praise [music] you again and again.
[2:16:36] Day and night like day [music]
[2:16:40] is [singing] a hallelujah
[2:16:48] [music]
[2:16:55] [music]
[2:17:02] singing [music] hallelujah.
[2:17:08] Hallelujah. [music]
[2:17:18] [clears throat]
[2:17:21] You know, Solomon said that
[2:17:24] there's a time and a season
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; for everything under the heaven.
[2:17:30] There's all kinds of different services
[2:17:32] and church services [music] that you can
[2:17:34] attend and you have attended for years
[2:17:36] and if you're like me raised up from a
[2:17:39] child attending church services
[2:17:43] and there's every every kind of
[2:17:44] variation. There's there's there's high
[2:17:47] octane preaching. There's there's
[2:17:50] teaching. There's and then then that has
[2:17:52] all of its categories. There's teaching
[2:17:53] on prophecy, teaching on this and that
[2:17:55] or Bible principles. [music] There's
[2:17:58] [clears throat] there's stuff that just
[2:18:00] puts the real meat of of God's word on
[2:18:04] your bones. And ever so often
[2:18:06] it comes a time in a season where God
[2:18:09] just brings it down to really like
[2:18:12] brother Bisco used to say, right where
[2:18:14] you live, right to your address.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; How many know that the Lord has found us
[2:18:19] this weekend?
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; He's found your address. He's found
[2:18:23] right where you are. And I have been so
[2:18:27] penetrated by the material [music] and
[2:18:30] it's so challenging to me. Did you ever
[2:18:32] imagine
[2:18:35] that Bethl Tabernacle was never to be
[2:18:38] just a church building?
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:18:41] I think to myself, how did it how has it
[2:18:44] taken me 30 years to realize that you're
[2:18:48] Bethl Tabernacle?
[2:18:51] And remember, as brother Aaron just
[2:18:52] said, you know, you leave you leave this
[2:18:55] dwelling place of God, you go to your
[2:18:56] home, which is the dwelling place of
[2:18:58] God, and you're the dwelling place in
[2:18:59] between.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Did you ever imagine
[2:19:03] that you are the gate of heaven? Just
[2:19:06] say it. I am a gate of heaven.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; I'm a gate of heaven. I I think this
[2:19:10] should this should inform our thinking
[2:19:12] to such a level your whole perspective
[2:19:15] after today. You're headed into getting
[2:19:17] ready to head into a new year. What a
[2:19:19] better way to close out a year to to
[2:19:21] suddenly come full circle and realize
[2:19:23] I'm a gate of heaven. I am a Bethl.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; I am a Bethl,
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; a house
[2:19:32] of God.
[2:19:35] I think I think about I was thinking as
[2:19:38] brother Aaron was preaching
[2:19:42] and I've never looked at that he he did
[2:19:44] the same thing to me he did on Friday
[2:19:46] took an angle to a scripture I'd never
[2:19:48] looked at it like that before. I told
[2:19:50] him I said man brother that sound like
[2:19:51] brother Abraham Myra. He does that all
[2:19:53] the time. And then today, as many times
[2:19:56] I've read over the years since a boy,
[2:19:59] you know, Jesus giving the parable, you
[2:20:01] know, you first got to go in and bind
[2:20:04] the strong man. And Jesus is giving the
[2:20:07] insider trading in intel.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; They're they're they're they're accusing
[2:20:12] him of, oh, you're you're using Satan to
[2:20:14] cast out Satan. And Jesus is answering
[2:20:15] that question. That's not what's
[2:20:17] happening. That's he's trying to say to
[2:20:19] them, Satan, first of all, if Satan is
[2:20:21] divided, he can't even stand. Here's
[2:20:24] what's happening. Catch it. There's no
[2:20:26] way unless you first go into a man's
[2:20:29] home and bind that strong man. That's
[2:20:31] what you see happening. I've went into
[2:20:33] his domain. I've came into his domain
[2:20:35] and I bound him. And you know, a prophet
[2:20:37] talked to us and and it's in the
[2:20:39] scripture and in the message. The power
[2:20:41] of binding and loosing is in the bride.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; You understand that Jesus he he went
[2:20:49] into that's how he he conquered every
[2:20:51] principality. He went into death, hell,
[2:20:54] and the grave and conquered all of it
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; and bound the enemy. And that's why the
[2:20:59] Bible says that we now catch it because
[2:21:02] now what are we fighting?
[2:21:03] Principalities, powers of darkness,
[2:21:06] powers of the air. But you have been
[2:21:08] given the secret [music] that the
[2:21:10] ability is in you as as a gate of heaven
[2:21:14] for God to come through you. Go in right
[2:21:18] here and walk these streets of Satan's
[2:21:20] Eden and bind the enemy. Yes.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; And spoil his house and bring your loved
[2:21:24] ones out of his out of his prison. Bring
[2:21:26] your family out of his prison. Bring
[2:21:28] your neighbors out of his prison. Oh my
[2:21:30] goodness, friends. What God could do in
[2:21:32] a revival if we could catch such a
[2:21:35] vision as that. I just say, my goodness,
[2:21:38] blessed be the name of the Lord. [music]
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; Have you enjoyed this whole weekend of
[2:21:43] services? I told brother Aaron after
[2:21:46] Friday night, I woke up actually this
[2:21:48] morning thinking about it and I had so
[2:21:50] many good reports from the the campfire
[2:21:53] service last night and the gathering and
[2:21:56] well attended and I and uh and I I
[2:21:59] thought to myself, wow, th this is this
[2:22:02] is ridiculous. We've got to bring
[2:22:03] brother Aaron more often. Amen. Bethl
[2:22:06] Tabernacle. How many would like to see
[2:22:08] our brother and his family come more
[2:22:10] often? My goodness. [applause]
[2:22:15] Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Did you know you can
[2:22:18] say that backwards? It means the same
[2:22:20] thing. Turn around and shake hands with
[2:22:23] somebody. We're going to get ready to be
[2:22:25] dismissed. Amen. And we want you to go
[2:22:29] in the love of God. And uh before we go,
[2:22:33] I want to close out the day in prayer
[2:22:35] and just say, "Brother Chris Kathy,
[2:22:36] could you come on up and close us out in
[2:22:38] prayer?" And I just want you to know
[2:22:40] we'll have brother Aaron and his family
[2:22:42] in the in the fellowship hall uh
[2:22:44] throughout the afternoon eating and
[2:22:46] fellowshipping. So give you a chance to
[2:22:47] come in and greet him. Greet his family.
[2:22:50] Tell them how much we appreciate them
[2:22:52] being here. Amen. It's [music] good to
[2:22:53] be a Christian, isn't it?
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; Like brother Brandham. He says, "If I
[2:22:56] wasn't a I don't even know what I could
[2:22:58] do. If I wasn't a Christian, I don't
[2:22:59] even know what I could do." Oh my. It's
[2:23:02] I'm happy to have had you all here today
[2:23:04] and the different visitors. We're glad
[2:23:07] uh Amen. and that Jeff and Hope and Milo
[2:23:09] got to come be with us. [music] So happy
[2:23:11] to see them and all of you different
[2:23:13] ones. Amen. God bless you all. Come,
[2:23:15] brother Chris. So happy to have you,
[2:23:17] your son, here with us today. Amen.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; Treat the people.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Wow. Wonderful word
[2:23:23] [music] today.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; I needed it.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; It's going to be stronger in my house.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; It's time to stand up
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; with the word of God. Thankful for the
[2:23:32] word. Let's just go to him. Father,
[2:23:35] God, we're so thankful that you've
[2:23:38] applied the Isab to our eyes, Father.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; And God, and opened the book from
[2:23:43] Genesis to Revelation, Lord, God, as I
[2:23:46] was driving here today, Lord, I we could
[2:23:48] be in all these other churches, but
[2:23:50] you've called us out.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; God, [snorts] you've gave us a truth,
[2:23:53] Father, and a charge to stand against
[2:23:56] the devil, Father. And we just thank you
[2:23:59] for the word that's went forth in our
[2:24:00] homes. And God has penetrated deep in my
[2:24:03] life, Father, to stand in in my home,
[2:24:06] Father. And God, I just ask you take
[2:24:08] this Bethl tabernacle, Father, and let
[2:24:11] it be stand against every stronghold,
[2:24:13] every enemy, Father, that might come in
[2:24:16] charge, Father. We take victory today,
[2:24:18] Father. We love you, Father. We thank
[2:24:20] you for this service. We thank you for
[2:24:23] your servant that gave out today, God.
[2:24:25] May you refill them, Father. May you
[2:24:27] just bless everyone that's came, Lord.
[2:24:29] Every father in here that would leave
[2:24:32] this place, Father. They wouldn't just
[2:24:33] take it lightly, Lord. They would God,
[2:24:36] just take charge and stand strong in
[2:24:39] your word, Father. We love you, Father.
[2:24:41] We give you our lives. We give you our
[2:24:44] all and all, Father. We just thank you
[2:24:46] for another day to serve you, Lord. God,
[2:24:49] to know you in a a special way, Father,
[2:24:52] as your prophet was saying when I was
[2:24:54] just coming over here, God, if we were
[2:24:56] be ba Beethoven, Father, we would write
[2:24:59] good songs. But God, you've called us to
[2:25:02] be sons and daughters of a king. And
[2:25:04] God, how much more who we who we should
[2:25:07] be today. Forgive us of our failures as
[2:25:09] we leave this place. Let us be a light
[2:25:12] in this dark world. Father, we love you.
[2:25:14] Bless your pastor here, Father. everyone
[2:25:17] that's here. God, we love you, Father,
[2:25:19] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; Chris, [snorts] God bless you, friends.

[2:26:06] Hallelujah.
