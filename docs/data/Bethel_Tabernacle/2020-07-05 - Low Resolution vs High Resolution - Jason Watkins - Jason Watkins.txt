========================================

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good morning a man gonna use this mic right here brother Joe a man greets you all in the name of the Lord this morning a man and happy to be here in the house of the Lord on the church connection it said there was no no internet connection so I'm hot spotting from my phone you might just check that out man appreciate you brothers being here too for our broadcast team as those of you who are viewing remotely will remember we indicated that our Sunday School classes will no longer be attended by the live audience but we're going to continue to broadcast it because I I definitely want to continue with that in fact is today I'm beginning a series I've let brother Matt know I still have yet to let brother Jason DeMars know though I'm sure but the Jason is listening now that I'm going to take a series on the entire book of Revelation I've wanted to do it for quite some time and so I'm going to actually take the Lord willing the Sunday schools going forward for the next while brother Matt and brother Jason will tag-team the Wednesday nights and of course in the middle of all that we'll have visiting ministers we already know but the digs is scheduled for July on a Wednesday brother Dale is visiting us again I actually am scheduled to be at my niece's wedding on the the weekend I think of Sunday the 18th so there will be those kind of interruptions in it but I've wanted to do a series on the book of Revelation for a while so we're just going to get started in today laying a little bit of groundwork we're not going to go too far into it but we're going to go in far enough just to get the idea of the direction I want to and then from there we to make it an in-depth study don't know how long it'll take me but I have a dual purpose and that is that I I will use this material to transition all of this material into the pot one of the podcast channels that brother Matt and brother Jason and I are doing we're still trying to get all of that up off the ground we've got all of our equipment we're getting our studio finished up and hopefully we will be we have done some filming just as rehearsal for how we want to how we want it to go but we're still working on that so you keep us in prayer for that whether or not that'll be the podcast that involves all three of us or it'll be my own private podcast I don't know but this material will then transition to that so that's kind of my dual purpose in it we're gonna go right to the book of Revelation chapter one and begin at verse one I read these eight verses at a service recently when I was emphasizing another thing at at a different sunday-school I'm gonna reread it again this morning Revelation chapter 1 verse 1 through 8 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John who bare record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand John to the seven churches which are in Asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead and the Prince of the kings of the earth you perhaps remember in a previous service I believe it was a Sunday school class where I emphasized how that he was King of Kings I believe that was my Sunday school title King of Kings and we went we just took a quick snippet of world events currently happening and we begin to show you you know various things that have happened down through history but yet at the same time God is always in control of it and we were emphasizing that no matter what we see and we're in very unsettling times but but the the point was made and I'll just reinforce it today he is the Prince of all Kings and so he he rules the world he's in perfect control there's nothing outside of his of his notice there's nothing happening outside of his control let's continue reading because we came to verse let's read verse 5 again in Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead and the Prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us now that was another point we made and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him we know that this is at the end of the Tribulation Period this is not the secret catching away in that instance he comes as a thief and they also which pierced him and all Kindred's of the earth shall wail because of him even so a man I'm Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending saith the LORD which is and which was and which is to come the Almighty amen father we thank you for your word and we asked now Lord that you give us divine inspiration Lord as we begin to look into this as a Bible study as a Sunday School class we commit it to you in Jesus name amen now we're finding that that as we were talking about when we preached King of Kings that we find that the world when they see him at the end of the tribulation they don't wail because of the tribulation plagues and that's an important point they wail because that when they see him it's obvious they're doomed it's very obvious that they have chosen the wrong path it's now very obvious to all of the naysayers and the atheist and the agnostics and the and the the the you know the godless societies and governments of the world in their liberal nasira's but they're now whaling because now they as they say the proof is in the pudding there he is they they haven't had no remedy for the three and a half years of Jacob's trouble they've had no remedy for Moses and Elijah they finally killed him but then they didn't even stay dead they resurrected right in front of the whole world on satellite television no less and so the world at this point when they see him they're already as low as human history has ever been or could ever be and yet even with all of that low point and that low hour we find them wailing further because of him and so we find that the one who was the faithful witness he was the first begotten of the Dead he's the prince of all kings he's the Alpha the Omega he's the beginning in the ending he's the Lord and and and saith the Lord which is he's he which is which was and which is to come he is the Almighty that is a revelation that is going to strike the whole world and all of the people who have dogged Lee contended that he is a trinity of persons are going to find out that's not true and when they realize that they have misled their people and mislead their families they're going to wail because the evidence will be painfully before their eyes now when we begin to look at this book now let me just take some other steps here Wow while I while I move into this thought give me one second here to find where I need to be alright got it now so when you look at when you begin to look at the book of Revelation it becomes extremely imperative that you understand the purpose of the book of Revelation and I want to dis make some lead-in comments so to give you some understanding now we know that that you know the book of Revelation is an unveiling it's an uncovering you know where I I heard brother Bisco many years ago use an example of back in the day in the in the golden era Golden Age and and they were you know bringing out new model cars and you know they didn't have social media and they didn't have all the access to the internet and everything that they had and and so we find that that they would bring a car out and it would have a covering over it now the car was already there it just had a shroud over it you couldn't see what it was they kept it secret there wasn't all of the internet social media for spy shots and things like that back then they managed to keep a lid on it pretty good and they would have these big car shows and they would roll it out under a cover those of us who are old enough to appreciate those days even I was a child back in that era but I remember that that was the how they brought it out and so you know you could you could you could walk up and touch perhaps and you could feel the car you could fit you could tell it was a car you could feel the mirror and say you know that's not it's not exactly like last year's model you could come around and say oh I feel that it looks like they went with rounded headlights rather than square headlights like last year's model it looks like the trunk the deck lid is larger and wider and the lines feel a little different you could get some semblance of it but you really you could only probe at it you only had one sense that you could touch it by eye - for your touch that you could sense it by was your touch but when they uncovered it just like I can have a covering over this mic and and you might could tell that it's a microphone you could feel it and feel kind of what it's like but when I uncover it now you actually see it that's the principle behind the book of Revelation give me my powerpoint brothers before that I'm gonna use for the sunday-school I want you to look at these examples gee man if you will operate that for me because I'm not pulling up my remote this is the book of Revelation and here's my first PowerPoint I'm going to call it low resolution versus high resolution because what I'll tell you into advanced G and so so we find out that God has always been a mysterious being the Bible talks about how that he dwells in unapproachable light no man hath seen him at any time and the only begotten of the Father hath declared him so Jesus begins to declare what God would look like and act like and be like as a man because he was a god man he was the very God living that very God living in a human body that was a spoken word creation of God now he was a man fully because we had to have a kinsman redeemer he couldn't be as the Gnostics and Gnosticism tried to suggest that he was an apparition or perhaps he was an angel no that wouldn't have given us a kinsman he had to be a human being this is the mystery of the Godhead how that how that Christ could be fully a human he could be fully God and that's why the Prophet said he was he was God he was man plus and he was the god man and so he wasn't exactly you know like Solomon or Solomon portrayed him but he wasn't exactly like Solomon he was man plus he was the god man and so we find in that down through the ages from the fall in the Garden of Eden God has slowly and and gradually over over millennia revealed himself more and more and more now we look at these low I want to show you an example here give me my first slide brother Gideon so now for those in the back you might not be able to see it but I imagine you can see it online you can see that you're looking at the exact same picture but the picture on the right side is in low-res the picture on the left side is in high risk they are the same image but the high-resolution picture you're able to discern infinitely more detail over the blurry I can get the outline I can even see the colors on the right side I can get kind of the the you know what's what's adjacent to what and I can get a little bit of depth perceptions but when I go to the left side to a high resolution video suddenly that image that I had a partial understanding of now becomes visible next slide brother Gideon here's another example the building on the right you can see the buildings below it the bit you've got the skyscraper than the buildings below it and you see a lot of pixelation now the image on the right and the image on the left are not images of a different property they are exactly the same property even taken from the exact same angle at the exact same time one is taken right behind another and right side is low resolution left side is high resolution lot next image brother giddy now we're gonna see a little bit more gradual you can see on the right side here's a yellow rose with a very low resolution and I can see it's a flower I can tell that it's a rose I can tell it's a yellow rose but I really can't appreciate that so much until I go from very low to low now I can start to appreciate it just a little bit more I can see a little more definition but yet still the very one to the far left is high resolution now I can see much finer crisper detail and and that's Andhra and high resolution you can just keep going up and up and up you can you can use micro lenses to capture very zoomed in intricate and then high-res that image and friends it's almost limitless then from there you can take that high resolution image and even from from from a micro lens and high res then you could put it under a microscope and see all the way down into the into the very essence of its creation you know what a microscope what a microscope would show you would literally go down into the fibers of the of the petals themselves and you would get amazing detail that you don't see they have tremendous cameras today that can take a picture of your arm you don't ever want to do it because crawling up and down your arm are the most ghoulish looking little bitty creatures you don't know they're there don't bother going to take a quick shower because when you do that you make them worse don't ask me why I'm not a scientist but they're on your body right now they have a purpose their little living creatures at the microscopic level and they're there just because you can't see them or feel them or detect them in any way they're still there and a super high intensity microscope lens can see they're there that's what the message of the hour has done God comes out of them out of the book of Genesis and you'll find him in a very low resolution way take that down get that's all I have for the slides go back to fullscreen and we find that that you-you-you can find where God is revealing himself to Abraham you can find that in the in the book of Genesis and he reveals himself to Abraham in in beautiful and wonderful ways how that how that he's the God who's a provider how that he's the he's the God who's a pen durand a protector he's the Almighty Abraham recognizes him as the Almighty but it's interesting that when you come to the book of Exodus chapter 6 brother Gideon can you find Exodus chapter 6 sorry that to jump you I didn't put that in the that I would do that but if you can get Exodus chapter 6 from memory I don't have it in front of me but I believe it's verse 3 Gideon Exodus chapter 6 look at this amazing statement and I appeared under Abraham unto Isaac and unto Jacob this is three generations by the name of God Almighty but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them now that's interesting and it's not to suggest that they didn't know who Jehovah was because it's the same name when you look in thee it's it's the Lord Almighty it's God Almighty and so we find out them that then how do you explain that he's saying by Jehovah I was not known it's not a reference to understanding or hearing a name or even understanding it doctrinally what the name means or who it is but but it is it is a manifestation because now God is in it is is in Egypt and he's going to deliver his children and so he he says to Moses now now I'm going to manifest myself in a further way not a way that I'd manifested to Abraham when I met him because Jehovah has this meaning God dwelling with his family now comes to Abraham there's no family Abraham has a promise of a family and when we find even through Isaac and Jacob it's starting to grow a little bit but nothing like it would be four hundred and thirty years later when there's two two million plus two million plus family members and so now God says to Moses I was never made known as one dwelling with my family I didn't make myself known to Abraham like that but I'm doing it now Moses you're seeing a further I'm not a different person Moses you're seeing a greater manifestation of me you're just simply seeing and continuation now the time has come for me to further reveal myself through manifestation now that's exactly what he did in the days of Jesus because he was revealing himself in the lives of the prophets in the apartment of the prophets and the priests and the kings but we find that all of that word that that that that that all down through the Old Testament he formed that body through by the prophets and the prophets laid out what the Messiah would do and how he would come and and and the suffering he would go through the prophets wrote about all of that and so the prophets now watch the prophets then formed the word that Jesus of Nazareth stepped into and became a manifestation of that word I'm sure you follow that and so so now then we we see that that even that even now Christ is the manifestation of the Old Testament that's why when he went into the grave he didn't just go into the grave and immediately raise up first before he ascended the Bible tells us he first descended into the lower parts of the earth and gathered all of those who he had made a promise in Abraham that this is what will happen and all of those Jews who believed him not all the great were opened the Bible doesn't say on his resurrection that all the graves robinus says many which slept arose but not all brother Branham shows us who was it that rose it was those who had been faithful and had followed the faith and had followed the word that God had given them even though it was limited they didn't have Jesus they didn't have the full measure but they had the prophets they had the priest they had the Kings and then Jesus Christ comes on the scene and the elected family of Abraham saw it Peter John James Bartholomew Matthew they all start catching the revelation many are following him and we find in that on the Mount of Olives you know there's better than 500 believers they go and then by the time he comes up a room there's 120 people still waiting and and then the church is born now what is he doing he's now creating a further understanding of himself but we realized then that that first original full understanding was lost because Paul warned the church that it would be and it was we can look on history and now comes the book of Revelation which was a book brought back to the church after Paul was gone it's not now you don't want to get the idea that the book of Revelation is knowledge that Paul didn't have because we have found in the opening of the book of Revelation in the unveiling of the mighty God in this last day that everything the book of Revelation teaches not only was it taught by st. Paul and all the other deposits it was taught in Genesis it was taught in the Gospels there's nothing that you can find no doctor no teaching in the book of nothing that the book of Revelation reveals is not founded in seed version in the book of Genesis because Genesis is the seed chapter you begin to get this idea and I'm just winding up my Sunday School class now you begin to get this idea that you you realize that when God you know who who comes through Genesis he's already laying the seed for everything that he will do that's how his family was in him before Genesis 1:1 because in Genesis 1:1 say you can't go back further than that oh you certainly can John 1:1 goes further than Genesis 1:1 Genesis 1:1 is when God created the heavens in the earth but the Bible tells us that our names were in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and so we realize that the book of Revelation now is on is a is is going to cover the history of the church it's going to show those first three chapters cover everything that Paul said would happen the first three chapters of Revelation show it happen you go back in history and overlay those first three chapters you can see how it happened perfectly and then when you come brother Brandon would say now the church goes up at the end of chapter 3 you don't see her again until chapter 19 when she comes riding white horses following the king of kings and Lord of lords now say well wait a minute if we don't see the the church after chapter 3 then what's all of what's it all about in chapter 5 and a strong angel proclaiming who's worthy and John standing there representing the bride and he comes to take a book what's all that about in Revelation 10 the mighty angel and the seventh angel and eating the book what's that all about brother Brandon explains that that the first three chapters show the history of his church show the fulfillment of what Paul warned would happen and it did happen and then chapter four the church goes up and she goes straight up in the rapture and there's a spiritual side to that but he says now beginning in Chapter five he said he's going to begin to show you how he did it how he pulled it off how he kept his church through seven ages through two thousand years he's going to begin in chapter five all the way through to show how he redeemed her out of each age how he came to the last day and revealed himself in an opening of the mysteries of God in an opening of the seals and that's why and then shows how that that mystery that that mystery revealed is the is the vehicle that will carry us into a body changed just like the camels which represented the word carried Rebecca to meet Isaac the word carries us to meet him in the air just like when Rebecca came to meet him he had left his tent he came out into the field she was coming she didn't and they met in the middle and so we meet him in the air by the revelation of this word that's why the book of Revelation is the bride's book specifically and uniquely the bride's book of the last day it is the book that unlocks to us the rapture mystery it is the book that gives us high-definition resolution that we don't see God in low-res we see them in high-res we don't see the world the world is fit is filled with fear and anxiety because they everything they see say don't they see it they do but they don't sit they don't see it clearly we that's the beauty of the opening of the book of Revelation in this last day is it gives us high-definition vision and when you can see it friends oh yeah that's where peace comes because you can see clearly what's happening why it's happening and you are very much aware that it's God in control of it all amen god bless you that'll complete our first lesson we're going to do as I said at the beginning I'm planning to take the Sunday schools for the next while maybe the rest of the year if it takes me I don't know but I want to do a study on the entire book of Revelation today we were just laying some groundwork so god bless you and we will have a short intermission and the regular service should begin probably within the next five or seven minutes god bless you
