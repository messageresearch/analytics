[0:00] Yeah.
[0:02] How many with raise your hands recognize
[0:04] this picture?
[0:08] Do you know who it is?
[0:10] It's brother Brandham
[0:12] and the pillar of fire.
[0:16] I don't know why.
[0:19] In 1964, God honored us privileged to
[0:23] sit in some of those meetings with
[0:25] brother Brown.
[0:28] I can't I can't tell a lot that some
[0:31] people can tell like brother Eddie
[0:33] Biscoll's testimony is awesome. But I
[0:36] want to share with y'all what what we
[0:38] did uh do. And the first meeting we was
[0:42] in was in Birmingham, Alabama.
[0:45] And u I think uh Ethan's got a picture
[0:48] back there. Uh we went to two meetings
[0:52] spiritual
[0:54] sp wrong picture. Ethan. Yeah, that
[0:57] picture,
[0:59] that's what Jason's face looked like.
[1:02] You see it's red.
[1:03] That's blood.
[1:05] And uh we took him to the doctor. He had
[1:07] eczema. There's no cure for eczema. Not
[1:11] then, not now. So when we got to the
[1:14] meetings in Birmingham, we want wanted
[1:16] to have Jason prayed for. And so my
[1:19] husband, brother Eddie, got a prayer
[1:21] card, but unbeknownst to us, Brother
[1:24] Brandham had already used the prayer
[1:26] cards. So the first night he preached,
[1:29] uh, we heard was spiritual amnesia.
[1:32] And when brother Brandon walked out on
[1:34] that platform, now we come from a very
[1:36] small 30, 40 people church, hundreds
[1:40] packed out.
[1:42] All I could think was, he speaks with
[1:44] such authority. I didn't even understand
[1:47] that. I do now, but I didn't then. But I
[1:49] knew he spoke with such authority.
[1:53] So the next night, which was Sunday, he
[1:55] preached um the trial. And after he
[1:59] preached the trial, then he called up
[2:02] all the ministers to line up and and
[2:06] including himself. And the people passed
[2:08] through to be prayed for. Well, Brother
[2:10] Eddie had a prayer card, but he wasn't
[2:12] any good. And so we were disappointed,
[2:15] but he went through the prayer line and
[2:18] he said when he got up to brother
[2:19] Brandham, Brother Brandham pulled him up
[2:22] to him and said, "You believe, don't
[2:23] you, son?" He said, "Yes, sir, I do."
[2:26] Now, we're very young Christians.
[2:30] We're very young message believers.
[2:32] We're very young. We weren't no older
[2:35] than some of you kids sitting here at
[2:37] that time, even though we were married
[2:38] and had two kids. So after that, that
[2:41] was in April 1964.
[2:45] Well, our little church it, you know,
[2:49] Ashley, back then there was very few
[2:52] message churches. I mean, we've got
[2:53] quite a few now, but back then there
[2:55] were very few. And the very few that
[2:57] there were was very small churches, 30,
[3:00] 40 people. So the the pastor we was
[3:03] under was a real believer, but he was
[3:06] limited. So we were hungry. We want to
[3:08] know more about this great thing God had
[3:10] done. From the first time we heard it,
[3:12] we believed it and it has been uh it's
[3:17] kept me all my life and I'm 82 years
[3:18] old. It's kept me all my life and I was
[3:20] in my early 20s.
[3:23] So my husband said, "We're moving to
[3:25] Jeffersonville. We want to find out more
[3:27] about this." And so we moved to
[3:30] Jeffersonville. Oh, I I I forgot I was
[3:33] looking at his picture. So when that was
[3:36] on Sunday afternoon, Brother Eddie went
[3:38] through the prayer line. Well, the next
[3:40] day was Monday when we got home. My
[3:43] sister Connie and our cousin Brenda had
[3:46] kept Lisa and Jason at our home in North
[3:48] Carolina. This was Birmingham, Alabama.
[3:50] And as soon as we walked in, I seen he
[3:52] was healed. And I said, "When did his
[3:56] face start getting better?" And she
[3:58] said, "Yesterday for church, it was
[4:00] bleeding." You can see the That's not
[4:02] Jason, but that's the way his face was.
[4:04] it bled. And she said, "But all of a
[4:06] sudden, yesterday afternoon, it got
[4:09] well. God healed him when he went
[4:12] through that. Jason Jason went I mean
[4:14] Eddie went through that prayer line." So
[4:16] then [cough] that was in April. And then
[4:20] in July, we moved to Jeffersonville. And
[4:24] we got there, we found a little, we only
[4:26] took our essentials. We found this
[4:28] little single wide trailer in his little
[4:30] trailer park. And they let brother Eddie
[4:33] work to pay the rent, give a little
[4:36] money till he could find a job. He was a
[4:39] good worker. He never had a problem find
[4:40] a job. So the first service we was in
[4:43] was Feast of the Trumpets.
[4:45] And during Feast of the Trumpets,
[4:48] um Ethan, are you showing the pictures,
[4:50] honey? It that's that picture was taken
[4:54] when we were on our way to
[4:55] Jeffersonville, Indiana. We stopped
[4:58] there and took them pictures. That's
[5:00] Jason sitting up there and that's Lisa
[5:01] holding him. So in July we moved to
[5:05] Jeffersonville and found that little
[5:06] trailer and then the first service we
[5:09] was in Feast of the Trumpets and during
[5:12] Feast of the Trumpets, Brother Sydney
[5:15] Jackson and his wife from South Africa
[5:17] were there. And I believe Brother
[5:19] [clears throat] Brandham said they got
[5:20] baptized while they were there. I I met
[5:25] I heard brother Sydney's testimony in
[5:27] person and it it was awesome. So anyway,
[5:31] brother Brandham preached Feast of the
[5:32] Trumpets.
[5:34] So after feast of the trumpets, we sent
[5:36] word back home. Brother Brandon preached
[5:39] Feast of the Trumpets. There is
[5:42] there no he did not preach Feast of the
[5:46] Trumpets. They're just young. They don't
[5:49] know what they're doing. They don't know
[5:51] what they're talking about.
[5:52] we got to send somebody up there to find
[5:54] out what these kids he he did not preach
[5:57] feasts of the trumpets. So they said,
[6:00] "Sister Gray and Sister Gray is an older
[6:04] sister, [clears throat]
[6:06] become a lifelong friend, a dear friend
[6:08] of ours." And she come up there to
[6:11] investigate. And what had happened,
[6:14] Brother Brandham was scheduled that
[6:16] summer, and he was in Jeffersonville
[6:18] that summer, and that's the summer we
[6:19] were there. He was going to Africa. That
[6:22] was where his heart was if he could. And
[6:25] if he couldn't, then [clears throat] he
[6:27] was going to preach the seven trumpets,
[6:30] seven nights. And so they wouldn't let
[6:33] him into Africa, an uprising. Some of
[6:36] the missionaries were killed, so they
[6:37] wouldn't let him go, amongst other
[6:39] things. And um then he looked around to
[6:43] try to find a place to hold the feast of
[6:44] the trumpets because the tabernacle
[6:47] itself held about maybe 500 people. Uh
[6:50] and I mean crammed in there. I don't
[6:53] know if you could got more than 500 or
[6:54] not. Jason, maybe you know. But anyway,
[6:58] uh
[7:00] uh he he couldn't find a place to have
[7:02] it and he wondered why. And he looked
[7:05] everywhere.
[7:07] And then he prayed. He said, "Lord, why
[7:09] can I not preach those feasts?" So that
[7:12] there was seven of them. Why can't I
[7:13] preach them? I didn't get to go to
[7:15] Africa. I told the people I'm going to
[7:17] preach them. And the Lord revealed to
[7:20] him they weren't for us. They were for
[7:22] Israel. the seals were for us. So when
[7:26] he preached Feast of the Trumpets,
[7:29] he did preach Feast of the Trumpets. So
[7:32] we were right. And the people found out,
[7:34] yep, he did just in one service. So the
[7:37] next day, Sister Gray, she's out riding
[7:40] around. We're out riding around with
[7:41] her. And she goes down Euing Lane. Now,
[7:43] Euing Lane is is where Brother
[7:45] Brandham's house is. Even today, that
[7:47] house is there. beside his house, his
[7:49] brother and sister Banks Woods, just big
[7:52] yard between them
[7:54] and she drove into the woods's driveway.
[7:58] She got out of the car. We followed her
[8:01] and walked kind of around the back of
[8:03] the house and there was some sisters
[8:05] back there talking and fell the
[8:07] beautiful day. And um so she began
[8:11] talking. We kind of stood back and found
[8:14] out one of them was Sister Mida Brandom.
[8:16] And when we found out it was Sister Mida
[8:18] Brandom, we began telling her about
[8:22] Jason being healed in the Birmingham
[8:24] meetings. That is sister Ma and brother
[8:27] Brham. And um so anyway, we told her all
[8:32] about that and the next service was
[8:35] recognizing your day and its message.
[8:37] And if you go back on that tape, brother
[8:39] Brandham tells that he said there were
[8:42] some people there yesterday been in the
[8:43] Birmingham meetings at the Woods's house
[8:47] talking to Sister Me and him telling
[8:49] them about little children being healed.
[8:50] That little children was Jason. So that
[8:54] was just a blessing. You know, he didn't
[8:56] know our names. He didn't know us, but
[8:57] he told the story.
[9:00] [clears throat] So then we were there
[9:02] when he preached Future Home. If you've
[9:05] never heard Future Home, it's one of my
[9:08] favorite. It might be my favorite
[9:09] because it tells where we're where our
[9:12] future home is and I loved it. We were
[9:13] there for that.
[9:16] Then then he we were there for proving
[9:18] his word. I I can't remember just every
[9:23] little thing. I know the first service
[9:24] we were there, we we were on the right
[9:28] hand side of the church and we didn't
[9:31] know no anybody. We were total
[9:33] strangers, but we recognized brother
[9:35] Levale. We knew brother Lee Vale. We we
[9:38] had met him and we also saw Brother Wei.
[9:42] Now, Brother Wei is the one that dropped
[9:44] dead with a heart attack while brother
[9:46] Brandham was preaching. And you can hear
[9:48] it on tape where he drops dead and
[9:51] brother Brandham goes out prays for him
[9:54] and he comes back to life. Brother Way
[9:56] lived many, many, many years. He lived
[9:59] to be a real old man. And so God
[10:02] completely healed him. Then
[10:05] [clears throat]
[10:05] so we were there for proving his word.
[10:08] And
[10:11] what happened at the Brandom Tabernacle
[10:14] the you got two doors on the back. Some
[10:16] of you been there, some of you haven't.
[10:19] One door on each side, double doors in
[10:21] the front. So we always stood on the
[10:24] right except that I mean on the left.
[10:27] And we were always early.
[10:30] If you didn't get there early, you
[10:32] didn't have a hope of getting a seat
[10:34] because it only held so many people. We
[10:36] were always there early and we had two
[10:38] small children and we would stand there
[10:41] in line. They kept the doors locked. You
[10:43] couldn't go inside. And we would stand
[10:45] there in line with other early people
[10:48] until time for the services. And as
[10:52] we're standing there, more and more
[10:54] people are coming. I don't know how many
[10:57] cuz they're coming at every door. And
[10:59] the door we're at, more and more people,
[11:01] you can hear people talking. You know
[11:03] how we all get together and talk and all
[11:05] like that. And all of a sudden, you hear
[11:09] foot footsteps
[11:11] coming in the Brandham Tabernacle. And
[11:14] when you hear them footsteps, everybody
[11:16] gets quiet.
[11:19] And then there's a an excitement arising
[11:22] almost like get ready, set, go. You you
[11:26] can feel the people are excited. They're
[11:28] fixing to unlock the door. We got to get
[11:31] inside.
[11:33] [clears throat] Excuse. These allergies
[11:34] are killing me. But so when they unlock
[11:38] the door,
[11:40] a tsunami of people took you in.
[11:43] You didn't have to walk.
[11:46] I'm telling you, I you were in. You
[11:49] didn't run around finding a seat. You
[11:51] got the first seat you come to. Or you
[11:54] didn't get a seat. Now, we were always
[11:55] the early cuz we wanted inside because
[11:59] we were always early. We always grabbed
[12:02] the first seat we come to. We always
[12:04] managed to get a seat. A lot of people
[12:06] didn't cuz on the car radio, those that
[12:08] couldn't get in, some of them stood
[12:10] outside the windows. Those that couldn't
[12:12] get in, you could turn the car radio on
[12:14] and listen to Brother Brandham over over
[12:17] the pull pit preaching. We never had to
[12:20] do that.
[12:22] So anyway, um during that time, brother
[12:26] brother Brandham greets brother Ed Bisl
[12:29] and his family. I never knew brother
[12:30] Biscll at that time and they were way
[12:33] over here and we were way over here so I
[12:36] couldn't see them. Years later we become
[12:39] we become acquainted with the Biscals
[12:41] and the family and they're to this day
[12:43] very dear friends of ours. Um, and
[12:47] anyway,
[12:48] the the chairs inside the tabernacle,
[12:53] I don't know how the schools are now,
[12:54] but when I went to school, you know, you
[12:56] seats folded back like that and that's
[12:59] the way they were. Well, we were all
[13:01] standing up. I don't remember what. And
[13:03] Lisa was four years old, curious. Yeah,
[13:06] that's the inside of the Brandham
[13:07] Tabernacle. And we were sitting over
[13:10] here on the on the left hand side at
[13:11] that time. and she couldn't see so she
[13:15] stood up on that chair and that chair
[13:17] flipped and she fell through
[13:21] four years old.
[13:23] Oh my my kid, she going to be screaming,
[13:27] hollering, we're going to break her legs
[13:28] if we can even get her out.
[13:31] You can imagine as mothers how you feel.
[13:33] We got her out. She didn't scream. We
[13:35] got her out and she's fine.
[13:39] Something happened. I believe it's
[13:40] during that meeting because that's where
[13:42] we were sitting that I do remember. We
[13:44] were sitting on that on the left on the
[13:47] left hand side there.
[13:50] Brother Brandon was speaking. I I don't
[13:52] remember the the uh what he was saying.
[13:55] All I remember he was speaking
[13:58] and as he was looking out through the
[14:00] congregation, he went like that. Caught
[14:03] my eye. He went like that like somebody
[14:07] was calling him.
[14:09] what's going on? And he was looking dead
[14:11] at me. I froze.
[14:14] I I mean, here's a pro. I believed he
[14:17] was a prophet and and I froze. And he
[14:21] was looking right at me like that and
[14:24] looking right at me. And I thought
[14:27] now I cannot describe this. Maybe
[14:29] somebody can. I can't.
[14:33] Brother Brandham was very kind. All all
[14:35] of us know that that kind of sweet or
[14:38] humbler man in the world. He didn't look
[14:40] mad. He didn't look angry.
[14:43] But it was God looking through them
[14:45] eyes. I guess he was either looking at
[14:47] that pillar of fire or discernment or
[14:50] something. But when he looked back at
[14:52] me, I cannot describe the look in his
[14:56] eyes. They were piercing.
[14:58] Now I I'm froze. And he done like that a
[15:02] couple times. And what it was just a
[15:05] seat or two in front of me was a
[15:07] brother. And brother Brandham, he was
[15:10] looking at him. I thought he was looking
[15:12] at me. And he said, "You're sitting
[15:14] there praying I'd speak to you, weren't
[15:16] you?" I don't remember what he told the
[15:18] brother, but he did tell him, "You were
[15:20] sitting there praying I'd speak to you."
[15:22] And of course, brother Brandham did. And
[15:26] so in the meantime,
[15:29] uh, Brother Eddie's looking for work. He
[15:32] couldn't find work and he finally found
[15:34] a job with a paint company that were a
[15:37] traveling painting company out of
[15:39] Wisconsin and they painted tar lines
[15:43] like they crawled up them with their
[15:46] buckets and they painted them. And
[15:48] there's another picture even there.
[15:51] That's what he that's the job he got. He
[15:54] said he could feel when they crawled out
[15:56] on him arms. He could feel the electric
[15:58] uh pulling [laughter] on his arm.
[16:01] But he was a good worker so he kept the
[16:04] job. In the meantime though, brother
[16:06] Brandham was there. Uh then he done
[16:08] questions and answers and we were there
[16:10] for that. Then brother Brandham left and
[16:13] uh went I think he had to take the
[16:15] children back to Tucson for school but
[16:16] also he had other uh commitments to go
[16:19] to. And I remember one of one of the
[16:24] questions and answers. There's four of
[16:26] them. Um I don't think we knew it. Uh,
[16:30] well, let me get this first. When Eddie
[16:32] got the job, once that job was finished,
[16:34] it it traveled and they moved to
[16:37] Elizabeth Town, Kentucky, about 50 miles
[16:39] from Jeffersonville. So, we moved to
[16:41] Kentucky and while we were in Kentucky,
[16:44] we met a young couple and they went to
[16:47] Brother Hoover's church. Now, Brother
[16:49] Hoover, Brother Brandham was a friend of
[16:51] Brother Hoover and preached in his
[16:52] church. I think he even dedicated his
[16:54] church. And we did visit Brother
[16:56] Hoover's church. on the weekends we go
[16:58] to Jeffersonville. It's about 50 miles.
[17:01] And um so anyway, one of the questions
[17:05] and answers we were there and I don't
[17:07] think we knew Brother Brandham was going
[17:09] to do it. I recently listened to him. He
[17:12] didn't even know they were going to do
[17:14] it. So, but anyway, when we got there,
[17:16] of course, we didn't get there early
[17:18] enough to get in, but we got in the
[17:19] foyer. In the foyer in the Brandham
[17:22] Tabernacle, there's two openings into
[17:24] the sanctuary. and we were over here. I
[17:27] could see brother Brandham in the pull
[17:29] pit and I could hear him uh and as he
[17:33] was answering questions. Now, Brother
[17:35] Brham took questions and answers very
[17:38] serious.
[17:40] He always answered a question if he
[17:43] could. And this particular questions, he
[17:46] wanted to know what's on the people's
[17:48] heart more than biblical questions, more
[17:50] like personal questions.
[17:53] And [sighs]
[17:54] one of the one of the questions I'll
[17:57] just name three of them. One of the
[17:59] questions that um they asked him and and
[18:02] what he said he said now
[18:05] this question of this person is as
[18:08] important to them as yours is to you. So
[18:11] the question was brother Brandham
[18:14] is women's pajamas the same as men's
[18:17] garments?
[18:19] And you can see it in the cood book. He
[18:21] said,
[18:23] "I really don't know."
[18:26] He said that as as a Christian sister,
[18:29] you basically you decide them things
[18:32] yourself. And he kept talking. He said,
[18:34] "You know, I don't really unless you
[18:37] want my thoughts on it." He said, "Now,
[18:40] if you want my thoughts on it, I'll give
[18:42] you my thoughts on it. I think a night
[18:44] gown's nice." [laughter]
[18:49] But he answered one question. Jason
[18:52] dealt Ashley uh with that a lot today in
[18:55] his sermon. It's a very important
[18:57] question. I love God in simplicity. God
[19:01] has made it so simple. Brother Brandham,
[19:05] how can I love the Lord more? Read the
[19:09] word and pray.
[19:11] That is so simple and it works. It pays
[19:15] off. [clears throat]
[19:18] I seen him get a question he didn't
[19:20] answer.
[19:22] It's kind of funny
[19:25] cuz he answered every question. Like if
[19:28] it was a personal question like a man
[19:30] and a wife or something, he'd say, "I'll
[19:31] see you on personal interviews." He
[19:33] answered every question
[19:35] and brother Neville, I guess brother
[19:37] Caps was a song leader then. Some of
[19:40] them was sitting behind him.
[19:42] Now, also, Brother Brandham said that
[19:44] some of those questions, you know, he'd
[19:47] get them and look at them beforehand,
[19:48] but some of them just come in right
[19:50] then. And I guess this this had to been
[19:52] one of them. Brother Brandham is looking
[19:55] down at this question. It it stuns him.
[19:58] Uh,
[20:02] Brother Brandham,
[20:05] is it okay for women to shave their
[20:07] legs?
[20:10] Did I read that right?
[20:13] Do they do that? [laughter]
[20:15] That was his re It's almost like he
[20:17] jumped. [laughter]
[20:19] Did I read Do they do that? He just laid
[20:23] that question.
[20:26] [laughter]
[20:28] Brother Brandham was had a real that I
[20:32] laugh about. I don't know about Brother
[20:33] Brandon. He had a very good sense of
[20:35] humor. Brother Brandham did.
[20:37] But anyway, um then then he was gone.
[20:41] That was 64. And then in the meantime,
[20:46] [clears throat] job we got traveled. So
[20:49] we was in Elizabeth Town, Kentucky. And
[20:51] we go backwards and forth to
[20:52] Jeffersonville
[20:53] on the weekends. And then they moved us
[20:56] to Oklahoma. We were in Ada, Oklahoma,
[20:59] Bristol, Oklahoma, uh Oklahoma City,
[21:03] Muscogee, Oklahoma, Prior, Oklahoma,
[21:07] and we would be at those places just
[21:09] brief, you know. Now, the foreman of
[21:12] that of that job had his own big truck
[21:14] and pulled his own little home behind
[21:16] him. He had two children, a wife and two
[21:18] children. But we would just find a
[21:20] little place. We never had a problem
[21:21] finding. We probably would now. We
[21:23] didn't then. And so as soon as we get
[21:25] into a place, first thing we'd do is
[21:28] find a little Pentecostal church. And uh
[21:31] when we'd find a little Pentecostal
[21:33] church, then we'd witness the message to
[21:35] them and about brother Brandham and and
[21:37] then they'd move us on some of the
[21:40] places was only there very brief.
[21:43] We wound up in Muscogee, Oklahoma in the
[21:46] bitter cold winter blizzard. I think we
[21:50] even had a blizzard when we were there.
[21:52] and we lived [clears throat] in an
[21:54] apartment I guess about the third I'm
[21:57] thinking about the third floor and we
[21:59] went to a little Pentecostal church with
[22:00] brother and sister Bogman. They were an
[22:03] older couple. They really they really
[22:06] liked us. We really like them. We went
[22:08] to their little church while we were
[22:09] there and witnessed this message to
[22:11] them. They never rejected it. Never. But
[22:15] they didn't embrace it either unless
[22:17] they did after we left. And so during
[22:21] that time in Muscogee
[22:24] out down the hall was other apartments
[22:26] and I met this girl named Kathy Brown.
[22:28] She had two little children. Her
[22:30] husband's name was Cherokee Brown. I
[22:33] don't know if he was Indian but his name
[22:34] was Cherokee Brown. Never met him.
[22:37] [sighs] And so witnessed to her and one
[22:40] night in the dead of winter in Moscow,
[22:43] Oklahoma, we got a knock on the door and
[22:45] it's Kathy wanting to go out and get
[22:47] baptized.
[22:49] pitch black, bitter cold in the middle
[22:52] of winter. Don't know where you're at or
[22:55] where you're going. We're new there. And
[22:58] Eddie thinks he found a dam of some
[23:01] sort. And so we pulled up to it, no
[23:04] flashlight, no nothing. And him and her
[23:06] walked out, didn't even know what kind
[23:09] of water they were walking out in. And
[23:11] he baptized her in the name of the Lord
[23:13] Jesus Christ. And right after that, then
[23:16] they sent us then u to Prior, Oklahoma.
[23:20] Rebecca knows a little bit about this.
[23:22] And we met Brother Ever and Sister
[23:24] Lorraine Thornton, their children, Pam,
[23:28] Deb, Debbie, and Steve.
[23:31] And we just fell in love with them. And
[23:33] they did us too. And so while we were
[23:36] there, we witnessed the message to them.
[23:39] We told them about Brother Brandham.
[23:41] They never rejected it. Never did reject
[23:43] it. But they didn't embrace it either or
[23:46] they didn't embrace it at that time.
[23:49] Eventually they did. So and I think
[23:52] Rebecca's kin some way in a little bit
[23:55] to Pam husband. I believe it is Rebecca
[23:59] Dave Musgrove. Yeah. And uh so anyway we
[24:04] were there and then they sent us to
[24:06] Bulmont, Texas. Perry Green was still
[24:09] pastoring a church in Bulmont, Texas at
[24:11] that time. And when we got there now,
[24:15] all we had was these big Realtore tape
[24:18] recorders
[24:20] and I think we had one tape. Let me tell
[24:23] you, the books weren't out then.
[24:24] The books to come out, I think around 68
[24:26] if I'm not mistaken. The film we show of
[24:30] Brother Brandham, Brother Perry Green
[24:31] found that film around 70 or the early
[24:34] 70s. We didn't have We had That's what
[24:37] we had. And uh it was hard to come by
[24:40] the the Realtore tapes. They broke real
[24:43] easy, too. But Brother Perry had a bunch
[24:45] of them and he would loan them to us. He
[24:48] also made copies for us. And we sent
[24:50] those copies to Brother Thornon. And as
[24:53] time went on, then brother Perry felt
[24:56] led to go to Tucson, Arizona, and start
[24:59] a message church. There was no message
[25:01] church in Tucson, Arizona at that time.
[25:04] Excuse me. He wanted us to go with him.
[25:08] He offered to pay our way to support us
[25:12] till brother Eddie found a job. We
[25:14] considered it. Especially Brother Eddie
[25:16] considered it. And um Brother Perry, I
[25:20] believe Brother Perry left about the
[25:22] first week of November.
[25:25] Uh it seemed like it was around the
[25:26] first week of November. Then you're
[25:28] coming up to the last of November,
[25:32] Thanksgiving.
[25:33] And um brother Brandon's going to be in
[25:37] Sri Louisiana. Now we all that we listen
[25:41] to the tapes or read the books know
[25:42] brother Brandon went regularly to
[25:45] Sriport Louisiana to Jack Moore's
[25:47] church. Jack Moore as far as we know
[25:50] never embraced the message but he
[25:52] embraced brother Brandham. He loved
[25:54] brother Brham and brother Brandham felt
[25:57] free to preach there kind of like his
[25:59] own church.
[26:02] Well, we wanted to go. So, we had met
[26:04] some good friends, Joyce and Harley
[26:07] Dudy. They went to Brother Perry's
[26:09] church in Bowmont, Texas. When Brother
[26:11] Perry went to Arizona, he left that
[26:14] little church in the care of his daddy,
[26:16] Brother Green.
[26:19] We got to go to Sriport.
[26:21] When we got to Sriport
[26:24] is on a heel. Um, if any of y'all have
[26:28] ever been to Sriport, it's hilly. So, we
[26:31] really didn't know where to go except we
[26:33] we knew the name and all like that.
[26:36] Well, when we got there, we looked down
[26:38] the hill and we we saw a bunch of people
[26:41] down there going into a building and we
[26:44] thought it must be where Brother
[26:46] Brandon's going to be preaching. So, we
[26:47] went down there and asked and no,
[26:50] Brother Brandon was not preaching there.
[26:52] It was Billy Graham by way of film. They
[26:55] were had a film of Billy Graham they
[26:57] were all going to see. So, we headed
[26:59] back up the road. Uh maybe someone told
[27:02] us look another direction. And then at
[27:06] the top of the road, uh there was a red
[27:08] light and it and it stopped us. But
[27:11] right in front and the road then went
[27:12] like this. And we're sitting like this
[27:14] road like this. And up on a hill was a
[27:18] big church.
[27:20] And down there on that roadway was a
[27:22] bunch of limousines.
[27:24] I don't remember if I even counted them.
[27:27] at least three, four, five limousines or
[27:30] more sitting there on that roadway. And
[27:32] as we're sitting there under the red
[27:34] light,
[27:36] the church door opens and a bride and
[27:37] groom comes out by themselves.
[27:41] That's very strange. I mean, fully
[27:43] dressed, white dress and everything.
[27:45] That's odd.
[27:47] Come down the steps cuz it was a lot of
[27:49] steps. Come down to the drive to the
[27:51] road. He put her in one of those
[27:53] limousines,
[27:55] shut the door, and he went back in the
[27:58] church. Isn't that odd?
[28:01] So then we finally found Brother Jack
[28:03] Moore's church. And when we did, I think
[28:05] it's a big church. It was packed out. We
[28:08] couldn't get in the sanctuary. We got in
[28:11] the church,
[28:12] maybe the basement. I'm not sure. I
[28:15] could hear Brother Brandham very
[28:16] clearly, but I couldn't see him. So, we
[28:19] might have been in the basement.
[28:22] After service was over, we run into
[28:24] Brother Lee Vale, Sister Vale, and we
[28:27] had become pretty good friends with them
[28:30] at that time. And they invited us to
[28:32] their motel room for a little
[28:34] fellowship. So we went and as we were
[28:37] there talking to brother and sister Vale
[28:40] um we began telling him about Billy
[28:43] Graham and the bride and groom and and
[28:46] he looked at us. He said, "You know,
[28:49] Brother Brandham's right above me in the
[28:51] room above me. I'll take y'all up there
[28:54] and introduce you to him."
[29:00] I mean, we're in our early 20s. you.
[29:03] We're not sick. We
[29:06] sick people have to go. Dead people need
[29:09] raised. We're no. So, we wouldn't go.
[29:14] [clears throat]
[29:15] But there was another main reason we
[29:17] didn't go. When we were brand new in the
[29:20] message, Brother Lee Vale went to
[29:22] Charlotte to brother Albert Green's
[29:24] church, a little small church. Brother
[29:26] Henry Green's brother. We went down
[29:28] there to hear him. That's how we met
[29:29] Brother Veil. And uh while we were
[29:33] traveling, we didn't have a home church.
[29:36] We visited churches. We did not have a
[29:38] home church. We sent him our tithes.
[29:41] He he was not a pastor at that time. He
[29:44] helped brother Brandham a lot in his
[29:46] campaigns. Very good bosom friend of
[29:48] brother Brandham. And it shocked him
[29:52] that we sent him our ties. It shocked
[29:54] him. And uh he said nobody did that, but
[29:58] that's who we knew. and we didn't know
[30:00] nobody else and we had a lot of
[30:03] confidence and loved him. We sent him
[30:04] our ties. We had him at our house in
[30:07] Texas.
[30:09] But one thing he and that's him with
[30:12] brother Brandham. One thing he said at
[30:15] the Charlotte meetings,
[30:17] he said, "A lot of people want to get to
[30:20] know me and be my friends just to meet
[30:22] Brother Brandham."
[30:24] And me and brother Eddie made a promise
[30:26] to each other if we ever meet brother
[30:29] Brandham won't be through brotherly
[30:32] fail. So we couldn't let him introduce
[30:35] us. But apparently he tells brother
[30:38] Brandham about that
[30:40] because on the wings of a snow white
[30:43] dove.
[30:45] Brother Brandham tells that he tells
[30:48] only thing is he brother Brandham just
[30:51] got the story of brother but it was a
[30:53] brother and a sister. I was with him.
[30:55] So, excuse me. And uh he tells brother
[30:58] Brandham tells that and he tells how
[31:01] that bride and groom comes out of that
[31:02] church.
[31:04] He was relating our story to brother
[31:06] Brandham and he said that meant a lot to
[31:08] him. It was complimentary
[31:11] to his to his to his ministry. It was
[31:14] you can read that in the wings of a snow
[31:17] white dove. It was very complimentary to
[31:20] his ministry. And the very night we was
[31:22] there, he preached invisible union of
[31:25] the bride. And here we saw a bride. I
[31:27] can see why that was complimentary to
[31:29] brother Brandham.
[31:32] Well, that was Thanksgiving,
[31:36] the last of November.
[31:40] Then December the 18th, now December the
[31:43] 18th, we're still in Bowmont, Texas.
[31:47] We've got to settle down. Lisa's five.
[31:50] she's got to go to school the next year.
[31:52] So, we got to decide, brother Perry's
[31:54] wanting us to move out there.
[31:56] We we didn't really know.
[32:00] And then on then on December and we
[32:02] didn't have phones. You didn't have your
[32:04] little cell phones. You had a house
[32:05] phone. You didn't have a phone. And of
[32:07] course, we traveling. You don't have a
[32:08] house phone. We didn't have the books.
[32:11] Only tapes we had was what we got from
[32:13] brother Brother Perry.
[32:17] So we you're getting information little
[32:20] by little, not like you do now. December
[32:23] the 18th,
[32:25] Brother Brandon was in a serious car
[32:27] wreck. Most of you know that. I don't
[32:29] know about you young people. It was a
[32:32] head-on collision.
[32:34] There were young boys drinking, driving,
[32:37] going from one side of the road to the
[32:39] other. And just as Brother Brandham come
[32:40] by, they went to his side. Um, they had
[32:44] a hard time getting brother Brandham out
[32:45] of the car.
[32:47] Sister Brandham was hurt really bad.
[32:49] Sarah had a back broke. Only Sarah was
[32:51] with them
[32:53] at the in the wreck. And so they got
[32:57] Sarah and Sister Brham to the hospital.
[33:00] They had an awful time getting brother
[33:02] Brandham out cuz his leg was wrapped
[33:04] around the steering wheel. His upper
[33:07] body was laying out through the
[33:09] windshield out on the dash.
[33:12] And according to uh what I read, they
[33:15] had to take
[33:17] and and pull the car like this while
[33:19] Billy Paul
[33:22] got inside and pulled his daddy. And
[33:24] brother Brown never lost conscious
[33:26] according to what they what they say.
[33:29] And being brother Perry was there, a lot
[33:32] of people were there at the hospital in
[33:35] Texas. Brother Perry was a big
[33:38] spokesperson that if you knew Brother
[33:40] Perry, he there was much nothing he
[33:43] couldn't get done or do. Like I said,
[33:45] he's the one that found the 20th Century
[33:47] Prophet film that we've got.
[33:51] Well, now we're getting little bits and
[33:54] pieces.
[33:56] December the 18th, he has a wreck. I
[33:58] don't think we even knew it till the
[33:59] next day at church, day one.
[34:06] He's God's prophet. He's going to be
[34:08] fine.
[34:11] Day two, he's still in the hospital.
[34:15] What you expect? He's been in a bad car
[34:17] wreck,
[34:19] but he's God's prophet, and
[34:23] he's going to be okay. I mean, brother I
[34:26] I saw Brother Weey raised from the dead,
[34:28] lived many, many years. I knew people
[34:31] personally that was healed under his
[34:33] ministry, including Jason. I knew people
[34:36] that got discernment under brother
[34:39] Brandham's ministry. That's God's
[34:41] prophet.
[34:43] Day three, day four, and he
[34:47] then we're getting word his brain is
[34:48] swelling.
[34:51] Um,
[34:53] he's going to be okay.
[34:58] His work's not through yet.
[35:00] We got it all figured out.
[35:04] We're all going to be here. Brother
[35:06] Brandham's going to be with us and he's
[35:09] going to introduce us to Jesus Christ at
[35:11] the rapture. So, he's going to be okay.
[35:15] Day five,
[35:17] just a greater miracle.
[35:22] Day six,
[35:26] Brother Brandham used to sing a song.
[35:28] You can hear it a lot on a lot of his
[35:30] sermons. Brother Brandham always sung
[35:33] after a sermon, but this one song in
[35:36] particular, beautiful song. I love the
[35:38] song.
[35:40] It's hard for me to hear that song. My
[35:43] heart drops tears.
[35:49] Till
[35:51] we meet.
[35:56] Till [singing] we meet.
[36:01] Till we meet
[36:05] at Jesus
[36:09] feet.
[36:13] Till
[36:14] we meet.
[36:19] Till we meet.
[36:23] [laughter]
[36:25] God
[36:27] be with you
[36:31] till we meet
[36:38] again.
[36:40] Wow.
[36:42] And he was gone.
[36:45] Brother Brandham was gone.
[36:49] His tired, wore out, weary servant
[36:56] was gone.
[36:58] That can't be.
[37:02] We We have to have brother Brandham. He
[37:05] can't be gone. We He can't be gone.
[37:10] But he is.
[37:12] And we had to come to terms with that.
[37:15] We were stunned. We were shocked. The
[37:18] whole world that knew Brother Brandham
[37:20] was in shock.
[37:22] Now, we're still young in the message
[37:23] and still learning. We love it. We
[37:26] believe it. Did Did it Did it weaken our
[37:29] faith? Not one tiny bit. Nothing has
[37:32] ever weakened our faith. I've loved
[37:34] this. I'm 82 years old. I was in my
[37:37] early 20s. I love it.
[37:40] And I love the Lord Jesus for sending
[37:42] it.
[37:43] But he was gone.
[37:45] God took him home.
[37:49] Brother Billy Paul told Brother Perry
[37:52] this different ones there at the funeral
[37:54] at the at rather at Texas.
[37:58] Brother Perry take daddy home.
[38:02] So brother Perry arranged to take
[38:04] brother Brandham home to Coots funeral
[38:06] home. Now Coots was a good friend of
[38:08] brother Brandham's. Then he arranged to
[38:11] get sister Ma and Sarah and I think
[38:14] Rebecca and George and I don't know who
[38:16] all else also get them home to they they
[38:19] were going for Christmas. It was uh
[38:21] going to Jeffersonville from Arizona for
[38:23] Christmas.
[38:26] So they got to Jeffersonville
[38:29] on December the 29th,
[38:32] 1965.
[38:35] They had his funeral.
[38:37] There are some of the cars. That's his
[38:39] church.
[38:41] Sister Brandham couldn't go.
[38:44] Sister Brandham had a concussion. Her
[38:47] body was she was very injured. Sarah had
[38:50] a broke back among other things.
[38:54] So she couldn't go. So after the
[38:57] funeral, they took Brother Brandham's
[39:00] body back to Coot's funeral home.
[39:04] They didn't bury him.
[39:07] They didn't know where to bury him.
[39:09] He had a home in Jeffersonville and God
[39:11] had moved him to Tucson several years
[39:13] before and he had a home out there.
[39:16] Where were we going to bury him?
[39:19] But big decision. There was only one
[39:21] person on the earth could could answer
[39:23] that and that was Sister Ma. And she was
[39:25] not able to answer it
[39:28] at that time.
[39:31] April the 11th, 1966,
[39:35] they Sister Ma decided we're going to
[39:37] bury him in Jeffersonville at Eastern
[39:40] Cemetery. A lot of y'all have been
[39:41] there. And that's about a block from the
[39:44] church. Matter of fact, when we had
[39:45] funerals there, uh we we did not go to
[39:49] Arizona. We went back to North Carolina
[39:51] for a little while and then we went back
[39:53] to Jeffersonville. We lived there for
[39:55] seven years and were members of the
[39:56] Brandom Tabernacle in that seven years.
[39:59] Jason and Lisa and Nathan went to school
[40:01] there. Jason went to school and Lisa,
[40:04] too, in that Park View Junior High where
[40:07] brother Brandham saw the Lord Jesus out
[40:09] there before they ever built it. That's
[40:10] where Jason then went to school. Um,
[40:14] so anyway, they buried him in Eastern
[40:17] Cemetery.
[40:19] Now, I want y'all to look at this
[40:20] picture. Have any of y'all ever saw this
[40:23] picture?
[40:25] I didn't know if any of y'all had or
[40:27] not. this picture. Brother Perry Green,
[40:31] like I say, back back then you didn't
[40:34] have a lot of information, but if you
[40:37] got Brother Perry had a lot of
[40:38] information, but he was one of the few.
[40:41] He sent us a a whole album of Brother
[40:44] Brandham's pictures. This is one of the
[40:46] pictures. Now, I can only tell you what
[40:48] is what I what I was told. I I can't All
[40:52] I know that's brother Brandham's casket.
[40:56] That anointing never left that prophet.
[41:00] And that was, we were told, was its
[41:03] casket.
[41:05] And then they put up his uh tombstone.
[41:08] It's a pyramid. A lot of you have seen
[41:10] it. A lot of you haven't. And it's it's
[41:12] got writings on on the pyramid.
[41:16] Um, brother Brandon when he preached
[41:18] Future Home, you know, he took it out of
[41:21] the Bible that it it's it's on a
[41:22] mountain 1500 miles high. It's a
[41:24] pyramid. So, they put up a pyramid. So,
[41:28] you got that picture, Matthew?
[41:30] Now, I want y'all to look at that
[41:32] picture.
[41:34] I wish I could have found a better one.
[41:36] I couldn't.
[41:38] You see that eagle?
[41:41] That's a gold eagle.
[41:43] Y'all ever saw that before?
[41:46] Now, where's the other one? Ethan,
[41:49] see that gold eagle?
[41:52] Its wings is up. statues don't fly.
[41:57] I guess you're wondering what's going
[41:59] on. Well, I'm going to tell you what we
[42:01] were told when the seven years we went
[42:04] back there. We were told this. That was
[42:07] the first eagle.
[42:09] Someone stole it. I don't think they
[42:12] ever found out where the eagle went, who
[42:13] stole it. They said it was a very
[42:15] valuable eagle and they replaced it with
[42:18] this one.
[42:19] And
[42:21] then I want to brother Brandham couple
[42:25] years back before the Lord took him home
[42:28] and
[42:29] you know our thing was
[42:33] he can't this can't be brother Brennham
[42:36] cannot be gone. Uh we've got all this
[42:39] figured out. He's going to be here the
[42:41] rapture and he's going to introduce us.
[42:44] We didn't realize it but we do now. We
[42:47] were in the rapture already. And he did
[42:51] introduce us to the real Jesus Christ.
[42:54] Every time he preached that word, every
[42:56] time he raised the dead, and you know,
[42:58] he raised several people from the dead.
[42:59] Every time he prayed for the sick or
[43:01] discern, he was introducing us to the
[43:03] real Jesus Christ. We didn't recognize
[43:06] that then, but we do now.
[43:08] We had to learn and grow.
[43:11] He went the the he he he wondered what's
[43:14] on the other side of this veil of life
[43:17] we all live in. And y'all know beyond
[43:19] the curtain of time. God took him there.
[43:22] And then he saw these women coming with
[43:25] their white robes and the brothers
[43:26] coming with their white just one big
[43:29] joy. He didn't want to come back.
[43:33] He didn't have a choice. He had to come
[43:34] back for us. I'm so glad he did. He come
[43:38] back for us. He don't have to come back
[43:40] anymore. That's where he's at now.
[43:43] That's where my husband, Brother Eddie,
[43:45] is, Sister Seal, Sister Jan, and
[43:48] different ones that we've lost over over
[43:51] time right here in our own in our own
[43:54] mist.
[43:56] Someone, I don't know who it was, made a
[43:58] video. Some of you saw it, maybe, or
[44:00] maybe not. Maybe a lot of you haven't.
[44:03] They made this video.
[44:06] It It's called Beyond the Curtain of
[44:08] Time.
[44:10] And it's about three minutes long. And I
[44:13] want to play this little video for y'all
[44:16] because if you wonder where Brother
[44:17] Brandham's at, that's where he's at.
[44:21] Where Brother Eddie is, that's where
[44:23] he's at. Sister Seal, that's where she's
[44:26] at.
[44:26] Yeah.
[44:27] It's where all believers go. If we go
[44:30] before the rapture either way, if we're
[44:33] believers, we're going to be there.
[44:35] So Ethan, you can go ahead and play it.
[44:36] And I I want to thank you all for
[44:38] coming. I I hope I've done a little
[44:41] justice to it. I I'm an eyewitness. I
[44:44] was there.
[44:46] Our age is dying off. I'm 82 years old.
[44:49] I was very young.
[44:52] I have to tell what I saw, what I knew.
[44:56] It's kept me all the days of my life.
[44:57] I've raised my children in it. You've
[44:59] got a pastor because of it. And my
[45:01] daughter is a dedicated Christian, too.
[45:04] And uh it's start young. It's well worth
[45:09] it. You ready to play it, Ethan?
[45:14] This is where this little video, this
[45:17] whoever made it, Brother Brand, I'm
[45:20] talking on it.
[45:23] Pause it until you get sound.
[46:01] I want to see Jesus.
[46:06] I would like to hear the sweetheart bell
[46:10] chen
[46:20] and vanish off here.
[46:25] Lord let us look
[46:28] past the curtain.
[46:34] Lord, let me [music] look
[46:37] up past the curtain
[46:40] of sorrows
[46:42] and fear. Let [music] me view
[46:47] that sunny
[46:49] right climb. [music]
[46:54] It would strengthen our faith
[46:59] [music]
[47:00] and would banish all fear. [music]

[47:08] past the curtain [music]
[47:11] of time.

[47:19] Heat.
[47:22] [music]
[47:27] [music]
[47:32] Heat.

[48:14] [applause]
[48:21] stand. Amen.
[48:23] What an hour. What a time that we face
[48:26] just ahead of us. Friends, it's never
[48:28] been more real to me than now. I thought
[48:30] to myself that, you know, I would um,
[48:34] you know, before Sister Jean started, I
[48:35] had no idea. I hadn't seen any of her
[48:37] material and and I thought, well, you
[48:39] know, I'll want to have some questions,
[48:41] but I don't think I have even one
[48:43] question. Mom, that was so thorough. Was
[48:46] so wonderful. I want to give her another
[48:48] hand. AMEN. [applause]
[48:52] AMEN.
[48:54] I am I I can say literally that I am and
[48:59] will be uh I guess that's almost
[49:02] redundant. I am eternally grateful
[49:06] for God's love and his mercy to my
[49:08] family and revealing this wonderful
[49:11] truth to my mom and dad and that you
[49:13] know that uh that video uh what a day
[49:16] friends my
[49:17] you know we have not run in vain. Amen.
[49:20] And I, you know, the Bible talks about
[49:22] that that we will, you know, we'll not
[49:25] be ashamed. We'll not be left holding
[49:27] the bag. You're not going to end up with
[49:29] a short end of the stick, Brother Jack.
[49:31] It's worth it. Amen. Just like Paul, you
[49:34] know, I think about my aged mom and I
[49:36] think about the Apostle Paul saying, you
[49:38] know, I've I've come to the end. I've
[49:39] run my race. I'm ready to go on. And
[49:42] there's not just a crown of
[49:43] righteousness for me, but for all them
[49:46] who love is appearing. My I you know
[49:49] starting from with sister Jean to me to
[49:51] all of you we have loved his appearing.
[49:54] Yes we have.
[49:55] Amen. Want to thank you all for being
[49:57] here today. Does anybody have a direct
[49:58] question you'd like to ask sister Jean
[50:00] about? It's okay if you don't but if you
[50:02] do I want to give you the opportunity.
[50:04] Amen. Praise the Lord. Oh, brother Rich
[50:16] when we went back the seven years that
[50:18] we lived there. He's the one that
[50:20] started printing the books.
[50:21] Mhm. You said ' 68. I was thinking like
[50:24] the books maybe were around I think they
[50:26] had some publications but the books were
[50:28] maybe around 70.
[50:29] No, we were in church.
[50:32] Oh, yeah. And you were getting them
[50:33] already? Wow. How you like that? Praise
[50:35] the Lord. So, we're glad for that. Any
[50:37] others? Hey, go ahead, brother Young.
[50:41] Were you there during crash with
[50:44] I was in I was in Texas. The car crash
[50:47] was in Texas, but I was in Bulmont,
[50:49] Texas. Uh I forget the town the the
[50:52] wreck happened.
[50:55] What's the What's the first time y'all
[50:56] remember being back at the tabernacle
[50:58] after he passed away? When we moved up
[51:00] there.
[51:01] Yeah. Yeah. And um we moved up there
[51:04] around 1970. Yeah.
[51:06] We were there for seven years.
[51:08] Yeah.
[51:08] And um
[51:10] I'm gonna tell you something. Um the
[51:12] seven years we were there,
[51:15] it made me we it's hard to put in words.
[51:20] I appreciated even brother Brandham
[51:22] more. That's crazy to say that because I
[51:26] saw the way they lived. I saw the way
[51:28] the church was conducted. I saw the way
[51:31] his children were.
[51:33] They were just like the rest of us.
[51:36] And but they they were some real true
[51:41] Yeah.
[51:41] believers. And
[51:44] I got acquainted with the Brandham
[51:46] family. I was a close friend with
[51:48] Rebecca and George. I used to sing with
[51:50] Rebecca and another sister. So it was a
[51:53] great honor. And I sung in the Brandham
[51:55] Tabern. I'll tell you one little story
[51:57] that I froze me.
[52:00] I would not sing behind the pull pit,
[52:03] but but I I was singing solo
[52:06] over here by the piano with a microphone
[52:09] and it was not working. And brother
[52:12] Collins and Brother Phillips was sitting
[52:13] behind me motioned me to brother
[52:16] Brandham's pullpit.
[52:18] [laughter]
[52:20] No, I I looked at them.
[52:27] I sung behind his [laughter] pull pit.
[52:29] What do you do when the preacher tells
[52:31] you to go over and sing behind the
[52:32] brother Brandham's pull pit?
[52:33] That's right. You do whatever the
[52:34] preacher [laughter] said.
[52:37] No question. Just do it.
[52:40] I felt I felt it was the honor was too.
[52:43] [laughter]
[52:44] I tell you, Mom, that's a great honor.
[52:46] There's another story I've never heard
[52:48] in all my life. Praise the Lord. Brother
[52:50] uh brother Michael Collins, that's what
[52:53] he remembered most about you is you and
[52:55] Rebecca and Anna.
[52:56] Anna
[52:56] singing. Yeah, they called him the
[52:58] tabernacle trio.
[53:00] Amen. Praise the Lord. I I that I didn't
[53:03] expect Sister Jean to sing that song for
[53:04] me. I about lost it. But
[53:06] my I grew up my whole life hearing her
[53:08] sing and uh I think she's still a
[53:10] magnificent singer. Amen. God bless you.
[53:13] Let's bow our heads. Any other questions
[53:15] before we go? Any other uh brother
[53:16] Jonathan,
[53:17] how did you get so good at public
[53:19] speaking?
[53:21] I took after your after.
[53:23] It might be the other way around.
[53:25] Might be the [laughter] other way
[53:26] around.
[53:30] Yeah. Yeah. Amen. So, it's uh you know,
[53:32] but the Bible talks about that, you
[53:34] know, the gift on Timothy uh that it
[53:36] came through his grandmother Ununas down
[53:39] to his mother Lois and into him. And uh
[53:42] [clears throat] you know I I loved
[53:44] brother Eddie for a lot of the
[53:45] characteristics I got and uh all the
[53:48] Watkins men love those Watkins jeans but
[53:51] but I I but my preaching ability my gift
[53:54] and it really came through Sister Jean
[53:56] and that's a straightup fact just like
[53:58] Timothy in the Bible. So if I I'm glad I
[54:01] got that scripture so I can lean on
[54:03] that. Amen.
[54:04] All right. Any others before we go?
[54:06] [clears throat]
[54:06] Sister Kathy.
[54:08] Who was it?
[54:09] Sister Kathy Kathy had a question.
[54:10] Unless you changed your mind.
[54:11] Okay. All right. Okay. Good deal. All
[54:14] right. Let's pray. Father, we thank you
[54:17] once again. Lord, we've come to the
[54:19] conclusion of this, Lord. And I Wow. I
[54:22] don't I don't think we could ever have
[54:24] enough time to talk about these things,
[54:26] Lord. And there's others that could, you
[54:28] know, could take it from there and, you
[54:30] know, say when I came and to this day
[54:32] and I've been a believer and the Lord's
[54:34] did this and that. And I think we'd all
[54:36] have that testimony. Lord, one thing's
[54:37] for sure. We we absolutely father are
[54:41] convinced uh the realities of the living
[54:44] God move among us. So it how could it
[54:47] not be the truth Lord when we see the
[54:50] realities of the living God. Everything
[54:52] the word promised for the bride in this
[54:55] day we see it moving among us. We only
[54:57] want more of it Lord. We just desire
[55:00] more and more of it. So I commit it to
[55:03] you. I thank you for this record. this
[55:05] this true record and this true testimony
[55:08] from Sister Jean, your daughter, my
[55:11] mother. Lord, we're looking forward to
[55:13] that day when we're all together again.
[55:15] Then we'll we'll sit around and and tell
[55:18] the great things that God did for all of
[55:20] us down through time. We commit it now
[55:22] to you, Lord. I pray it'll be a great
[55:24] impact upon the young people. That
[55:26] really was the burden of our heart,
[55:27] Lord, for the senior youth. So, Father,
[55:30] may may it have a lasting may it reap
[55:33] dividends for many ages, many years to
[55:36] come, Lord, into the eternal ages. We
[55:38] commit it to you now in Jesus' name.
[55:41] Amen. God bless you, friends. Thank you.
[55:43] God bless you. You're dismissed.
[55:46] Amen. Fantastic.
