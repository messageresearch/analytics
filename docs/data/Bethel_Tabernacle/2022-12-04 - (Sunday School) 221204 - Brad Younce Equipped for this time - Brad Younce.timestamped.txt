[5:20] Lord

[5:23] opportunity to come back in his house
[5:25] once again Lord

[5:28] for granted Lord we we want to be able
[5:31] to come here as many times those doors

[5:46] a quick healing father Lord may you be
[5:48] with us today in his service Lord I pray
[5:50] in Jesus name amen
[5:53] in Ephesians chapter 6 verse 11 or 1 1
[5:57] verse and then we'll uh
[6:00] that should be seated
[6:03] it says put on the whole armor of God
[6:06] that you may be able to stand against
[6:08] The Wiles of the devil
[6:11] may God add a blessing you can have your
[6:12] seats
[6:15] this is one of those I started
[6:18] just a few weeks ago
[6:22] putting this in the title for this thing
[6:23] is equipped for this time
[6:26] and I just left it along after a couple
[6:28] other brothers started preaching on this
[6:30] and the weapons and
[6:33] you know how that is brother Caleb and
[6:35] you say well I had to put that away from
[6:37] somewhere else but when it come up this
[6:39] morning I didn't quickly answer and I
[6:40] started looking through all my notes and
[6:42] I'm like
[6:43] and it's pop that at me I'm I'm like
[6:46] I'm not done with it
[6:48] but so well I mean we'll just we'll just
[6:51] go with it
[6:52] so we know we quipped
[6:54] the word equipped is uh I gotta find it
[6:57] first is to furnish
[7:00] for service or action
[7:02] equip an army
[7:04] to dress to make ready prepare
[7:07] so we're actually in a battle
[7:10] this ain't a picnic we're in
[7:12] when I got a little box of chicken and
[7:14] headed down here to the lake and or to
[7:16] the beach and we're not
[7:17] we're not on a picnic
[7:19] this is a battle
[7:21] before we fight not against each other
[7:24] against principalities against Powers
[7:26] you know he quit for this time
[7:29] it's like an eagle
[7:30] they're equipped for how high they can
[7:32] fly
[7:34] a little a normal bird can't go as high
[7:36] as that eagle because that eagle is
[7:38] equipped to Fly Above
[7:40] they can soar up and if a hawk or
[7:42] anybody try to anything tries to go up
[7:44] they'll just disintegrate they can't go
[7:46] the Eagles equipped to go that high it's
[7:49] like the astronauts
[7:50] they're equipped
[7:52] airplane pilots can't go
[7:55] they're not trained to go into astronaut
[7:57] age if y'all get the point
[8:01] but they're trained to take off to the
[8:03] Moon
[8:03] these astronauts are they're equipped
[8:05] for this
[8:06] they're equipped for this it's just like
[8:09] uh
[8:11] a martyr
[8:12] back in the early days they were
[8:16] equipped
[8:17] how can you stand there and watch your
[8:19] wife
[8:20] the Belly being ripped out
[8:23] how can you stand there and watch and
[8:25] not say a word
[8:27] and say I'm not going to back down from
[8:28] this thing they were equipped for that
[8:31] just like you're equipped to stand in
[8:33] this day we're probably we may not have
[8:35] to give our lives
[8:37] but there's other things that we have to
[8:39] do it's just as just as bad as what they
[8:41] went through we've got to be equipped
[8:43] for this
[8:45] but this is Moses wasn't equipped
[8:48] until he went to the wilderness
[8:51] he tried to just kill one Egyptian but
[8:53] it
[8:54] they didn't they were ready for follow
[8:55] him all he did was kill one person and
[8:58] he got scared and ran so he had to go
[9:00] into the Wilderness to be
[9:02] tried trained so when you come back 40
[9:05] years later
[9:07] I don't hope it don't take us 40 years
[9:09] to get ready
[9:10] or we got to be ready in a moment in a
[9:14] twinkling of an eye we've got to be
[9:15] equipped for this we're a quit for the
[9:17] rapture
[9:19] we're a quit for it
[9:22] it's going to take a special
[9:24] something special
[9:26] to lift us up off this Earth
[9:28] our flesh bodies ain't gonna be able to
[9:30] do it
[9:31] you know in the Book of Esther we often
[9:34] be very familiar with the story
[9:37] where Haman he just didn't like the Jews
[9:41] he didn't like them
[9:42] so he tried everything he did he can to
[9:45] get them killed
[9:46] so he had the king
[9:48] make out this decree that we're going to
[9:50] kill these people in a certain day
[9:52] well Esther sees Mordecai out there why
[9:55] is he in mourning
[9:57] and so he tells her he said you're going
[9:59] to have to do something
[10:01] and she's like I can't go into the king
[10:02] until he calls me
[10:06] he says but you're going to have to
[10:08] because when it's time for the Jews to
[10:11] get killed you're going to get killed as
[10:12] well because you're a Jew
[10:16] he says how do you know that you weren't
[10:19] put in that position for such a time as
[10:21] this
[10:23] my how do you know you're not put here
[10:25] on this Earth for such a time as this
[10:28] Esther was equipped
[10:31] we know all her training she went
[10:33] through
[10:34] she went through the seven Church ages
[10:36] she was trained to go in before the king
[10:39] so when she walks around into the throne
[10:41] room the king says come
[10:44] the king says come
[10:46] she was equipped
[10:49] he held out the Sepulcher
[10:52] we coming through the throne room God
[10:54] hands out his Sepulcher to you you're
[10:56] equipped for this time what a special
[10:58] people we are
[11:00] whoa
[11:02] back over in the Ephesians chapter 6
[11:04] finally my brethren be strong in the
[11:07] Lord in the power of His might put on
[11:11] the whole armor of God
[11:14] this put this put on
[11:17] is to be clothed in
[11:19] to have on
[11:21] to be endued
[11:24] Hallelujah go into the upper room until
[11:27] you be endued with power from on high
[11:31] put on
[11:33] put on this armor of God
[11:36] Hallelujah close with clothing be in
[11:39] Deuter array to be clothed in to sink
[11:42] into
[11:43] it's like you when you got ready for
[11:44] church
[11:46] you got all dressed up
[11:48] you slid the code in
[11:50] you were clothed in you put it on that's
[11:52] what we got to do with this armor we've
[11:54] got to put it on
[11:58] Hallelujah
[11:59] you have to armor the fighting it has to
[12:01] protect yourself
[12:03] the armor of God is what he has provided
[12:06] for every Christian Soldier
[12:09] yeah it ain't mean you're gonna get a
[12:11] little pistol and you're gonna go start
[12:12] fighting
[12:13] you don't have a real sword we got
[12:16] something better than that
[12:18] this right here we're not slaying flesh
[12:20] people
[12:21] we're after the devil
[12:25] we've got the sword of the word
[12:27] we're not a weak back Christian
[12:32] we're not no weak Christians
[12:34] we're not going to barely make it
[12:35] through
[12:36] we're a strong Army
[12:39] brother Brown said God's going to choose
[12:41] for his army the best weapon that could
[12:42] be given and he chose it
[12:45] and it was his word God gave his army
[12:48] the best equipment that he could ever
[12:50] use and ever could use
[12:52] and would never have to change it
[12:57] the devil's always changing his tactics
[13:00] he's always upgraded his Arsenal
[13:03] God's has been the same since the
[13:05] beginning
[13:07] Jesus went to the Wilderness to show you
[13:10] how to beat the devil
[13:13] Hallelujah no matter how many things
[13:15] Satan gets
[13:18] oh he has more things to use today than
[13:20] he had when we was young people
[13:23] if we had to if we want to sneak around
[13:26] listen to rock music we had to get our
[13:27] little big headphones our little
[13:29] walkmans and carry around our big cases
[13:31] of full of our tapes
[13:34] [Laughter]
[13:37] some of you telling how old you are
[13:39] but now you stick your headphone in we
[13:42] ain't got a clue what they're listening
[13:43] to
[13:46] the tactics of the devil
[13:48] let your parents think you listen to
[13:50] Christian music
[13:52] once you grab the headphones of the kids
[13:54] one day and say what are you listening
[13:55] to see what they act
[13:58] [Applause]
[14:01] God is so good
[14:06] tactics of the devil
[14:09] wow
[14:13] Mercy
[14:15] a person he's all the armor to fight the
[14:17] battle of the Lord
[14:18] and if he likes one of these weapons
[14:20] that God has appointed you're defeated
[14:24] if we don't have us if we have the sword
[14:26] but we ain't got the shield
[14:29] we have nothing to protect us
[14:32] my goodness
[14:35] we're not running for the devil
[14:37] we know this armor
[14:39] it always protects the front
[14:43] I probably said it before
[14:44] they don't have armor on the back of the
[14:46] soldiers
[14:47] they're not made to turn around and run
[14:52] Hallelujah
[14:54] Luke 4 24 49 behold I send the promising
[14:57] to you and Terry into Jerusalem until
[14:59] you be endued with power from on high
[15:02] Romans 13 11 they know on the time that
[15:05] now is high time to wake out of sleep
[15:07] for now is our Salvation nearer than
[15:11] when we believe the night is far spent
[15:15] the day is at hand it's Daybreak
[15:19] hallelujah it's Daybreak
[15:25] I'm feeling good
[15:27] for now is our Salvation the night is
[15:30] far spent the day is at hand let us
[15:31] therefore cast off the works of the
[15:33] darkness and let us put on the armor of
[15:37] light
[15:38] let us walk honestly as in the day not
[15:41] in writing and drunkenness and
[15:43] chambering or wantness or Strife or
[15:45] eminent but put ye on the Lord Jesus
[15:48] Christ make not provision for the flesh
[15:52] to fulfill the lust thereof Colossians 3
[15:55] 10 and a half put on the new man
[15:59] put on the new man which is renewed in
[16:02] knowledge after the image
[16:04] of him that created him
[16:06] put on therefore as the elect of God
[16:10] holy and beloved bowels of mercies
[16:14] kindness and humbleness of mine and
[16:16] meekness and long-suffering for bearing
[16:18] one another forgiving one another
[16:22] If any man have a quarrel against any
[16:24] even as Christ forgave you also do ye
[16:28] and above all things
[16:30] put on
[16:32] charity
[16:34] which is the bond of perfectness
[16:38] my goodness
[16:41] Ephesians 6 11 put on the armor of God
[16:44] that ye may be able to stand
[16:48] Against The Wiles of the devil
[16:52] the word wise means traced out with a
[16:55] method well laid out
[16:58] art skill cunning
[17:01] cutting devices spoke of it just a
[17:04] minute ago
[17:05] The Wiles or the Devils or the various
[17:07] arts and strategies which he employs to
[17:10] drag Souls down the hill
[17:14] my goodness
[17:17] trying the same thing he did to Eve
[17:20] false prophets will arise
[17:22] deceiving the people saying this word is
[17:25] not right
[17:26] wow
[17:28] but he don't carry open Warfare
[17:31] the devil doesn't Fight Fair
[17:33] he ain't gonna fight you face to face he
[17:35] can't but he's gonna sneak around in the
[17:37] bushes
[17:39] looking around at you
[17:41] trying to sneak up on you catch you at
[17:43] your weakest moment
[17:46] might be 12 o'clock at night or one
[17:48] o'clock in the morning
[17:51] when everybody's asleep
[17:54] my goodness
[17:56] that's a pastor's job
[18:00] oh he just promised us a life full of
[18:02] joy
[18:04] no more fighting
[18:06] a lot of people's left this message to
[18:08] say how free they are
[18:11] we're free
[18:12] yeah you're free
[18:14] you're free to do whatever you want to
[18:17] but you're always a slave to something
[18:20] [Music]
[18:23] I can't I can't think of no better thing
[18:25] to be than a slave to Jesus Christ
[18:30] I don't want to be a slave to this world
[18:33] you're not free You Think You Are
[18:37] they don't like the rules and
[18:39] regulations that they call it a message
[18:42] thank God for the rules
[18:45] I don't mind the rules
[18:47] when you got the Holy Ghost it's easy to
[18:49] follow
[18:50] it's like just like walking in here and
[18:52] sitting down it's just as easy
[18:56] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[18:58] blood but against the principalities
[19:00] against Powers against the rulers of the
[19:02] darkness of this world against spiritual
[19:04] witness in high places
[19:06] wherefore taken to you the whole armor
[19:09] of God
[19:11] that ye may be able to withstand in the
[19:14] evil day
[19:16] to stand against to oppose resist
[19:20] are you resisting
[19:23] stand therefore having your loins gird
[19:25] about with truth and have it on the
[19:26] breastplate of righteousness
[19:30] you got your breastplate on
[19:33] we don't have time to go into all of
[19:34] that
[19:35] have your feet shod with the preparation
[19:38] of gospel of peace
[19:41] above all take the shield of Faith
[19:44] wherewith ye shall be able to quench all
[19:46] the fiery darts of the wicked
[19:49] to Candle it
[19:50] that's what quench is
[19:53] to Kindle it
[19:55] to put it out
[19:57] all the fiery darts of the wicked
[20:00] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[20:03] sword of the spirit which is the word
[20:05] praying always
[20:08] with all power prayer and supplication
[20:10] in the spirit watching there unto with
[20:13] all perseverance and supplication for
[20:15] the Saints
[20:17] we have to be watching constantly
[20:20] guarding ourselves studying the devil
[20:24] he studies you
[20:27] so why don't we study the devil let's
[20:29] find out what the devil knows about us
[20:31] because he knows you better you know
[20:33] yourself
[20:36] he knows what bothers you
[20:38] I might not know it
[20:40] brother Jason's Minister both may not
[20:42] know what bothers you
[20:44] but the devil knows
[20:46] and he'll try to use every thing
[20:49] against you
[20:51] everything
[20:56] my goodness
[20:58] why do you wire armor because we're in a
[21:01] state of warfare
[21:02] we are fighting
[21:04] numerous enemies
[21:10] 200 000 demons was released out of the
[21:12] rear Euphrates
[21:15] we're fighting I've said it before I
[21:17] like to say it again just let the devil
[21:20] know it don't matter how many he has
[21:22] against us
[21:24] how many fighting against us it's not
[21:27] enough
[21:31] if God could open our eyes like Elisha
[21:33] was praying for his servant open his
[21:35] eyes up Lord
[21:38] let him see there's more for us than
[21:41] against us
[21:42] if God could open up our spiritual lives
[21:44] this morning what would be lying in the
[21:46] walls of this building
[21:49] what would we see
[21:51] in that other dimension
[21:55] believe the preaching the brother Matt
[21:58] yeah
[21:59] oh Hallelujah we got the strength
[22:02] we've got the armor there's so many
[22:05] things you say about the armor
[22:07] a lot of things you say about this armor
[22:09] we need it
[22:11] we need it
[22:13] we can't fight nothing without this
[22:15] armor
[22:18] yeah
[22:19] here we go again
[22:21] what is the armor
[22:24] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[22:28] I need it every day
[22:32] some days you feel like you get so weak
[22:34] you're having a bad day
[22:38] you're like Lord I Need
[22:40] strength
[22:43] Lord I need a refill of your spirit
[22:46] I'm fighting this devil today
[22:48] you see what I face of me at work
[22:51] I'm going to need this armor today
[22:56] but you got to see your need of it
[22:58] you got to recognize you're in a battle
[23:01] but once you receive the Holy Ghost
[23:03] that's actually when your fighting
[23:05] starts
[23:07] my goodness
[23:10] we must realize that we can't fight this
[23:12] Army of Satan alone
[23:13] we've got to have help from a
[23:15] supernatural power
[23:17] we got to realize
[23:20] we don't have what it takes to defeat
[23:22] the Devil alone
[23:25] he is also mightier than we are because
[23:28] we're no match for him
[23:30] unless we put on the whole armor of God
[23:35] you know Paul paints a picture of a
[23:37] Christian armor
[23:38] because Paul's in prison a lot
[23:43] there's been many times he was chained
[23:45] to a soldier
[23:46] so he would look at that Soldier what
[23:48] that Soldier was wearing
[23:49] the belt the breastplate the shoes the
[23:52] shield
[23:53] the helmet the sword
[23:55] He he'll list them in exact order a
[23:59] soldier would put him on
[24:02] he said the belt comes first because it
[24:05] covers the most vulnerable organs and
[24:07] held other pieces of armor in place
[24:10] this is where you kept your weapons
[24:12] needed for Warfare
[24:13] the breastplate covers the chest to the
[24:15] upper abdomen
[24:17] The Shield covers most of the Soldier's
[24:20] body
[24:21] when soldiers stood side by side
[24:25] their Shields touched
[24:28] that's the way they marched
[24:29] it don't matter how many arrows come
[24:31] against them
[24:33] that Shield held it
[24:36] it don't matter we all we all will come
[24:38] together
[24:40] let's put our Shields together
[24:42] it don't matter what the devil throws
[24:44] against you we have the shields
[24:47] we're all one Army we're marching
[24:49] together
[24:51] we got one over here by itself
[24:53] if he is reach over there pull him over
[24:56] here it's safer in numbers
[25:00] my goodness the fiery darts couldn't
[25:03] penetrate those that's that Shield
[25:07] it don't matter how much time he tells
[25:09] you it's fun living in sin
[25:13] it might have been
[25:15] at one time
[25:17] might have been fun going around
[25:18] drinking and smoking and carrying on
[25:21] behind you Christians are still has
[25:24] scars in your bodies from all that
[25:27] I got my hand raised
[25:31] man
[25:33] oh he'll get you he'll get you to sin
[25:35] and laugh at you
[25:37] it's like he'll talk into robbing a bank
[25:39] they call the cops on you
[25:45] that's the devil that's who we're
[25:47] fighting against
[25:49] let's put on the whole armor
[25:52] your feet shot with the preparation of
[25:54] the Gospel the shoes
[25:56] you've heard me say this before I love
[25:58] it
[25:59] because I want the devil to know who he
[26:01] is
[26:02] and where he's supposed to be at and
[26:04] what these he's supposed to be under our
[26:06] feet
[26:07] the spikes on the feet
[26:10] just March around on the devil you've
[26:12] heard me say it
[26:13] spikes
[26:15] the firm grip we don't let him up that's
[26:18] part of the armor
[26:21] he said what she's got to do protecting
[26:23] you
[26:24] it does because if you're standing on
[26:25] the devil he can't get up to fight you
[26:30] Hallelujah he's not going to give you a
[26:32] fair break
[26:34] he don't fight fair
[26:37] oh he'll come with you different many
[26:38] disguises
[26:41] the one he's got today has said
[26:43] hey push away and obey
[26:46] just like we heard Wednesday night
[26:50] the mantle didn't drop on those people
[26:54] they didn't see Elijah go up they still
[26:57] got him on the Earth
[26:59] they still have him
[27:01] because he's the pastor they didn't let
[27:04] him go up
[27:07] who knows that's probably what Matt's
[27:09] preaching on this morning again
[27:10] hope so
[27:13] Hallelujah
[27:18] why in the world's all this
[27:23] Brothers know how it is you get all
[27:24] kinds of quotes and you don't know what
[27:25] you're
[27:26] you had time to go back and proofread
[27:28] them
[27:33] just remember one thing the devil does
[27:35] not have any Authority outside which God
[27:37] has given you
[27:40] a given him so pardon
[27:43] he has a short range the devil knows he
[27:44] has a short Reign on this Earth because
[27:46] he's doing everything he can to get you
[27:50] so put on the whole armor of God
[27:54] withstand the devil
[27:59] what's what's what what'd it say resist
[28:02] the devil
[28:03] and he'll flee from you

[28:46] have your armor
[28:50] because we will be we got a battle

[28:56] picnic
