[28:10] morning
[28:13] hello I love
[28:15] [Music]
[28:17] you is this on this is on right your
[28:20] your applause covered the sound of my
[28:22] own
[28:23] voice okay so as usual there parts of
[28:28] the skit where we like to interact
[28:31] because everyone is so nervous up here
[28:33] and I my knees are shaking it's very
[28:35] hard to be up here so there's a few
[28:38] parts where like um you'll kind of see
[28:41] maybe cues from me or some of the people
[28:45] on stage where it'd be great if you
[28:46] joined in we like to hear you know
[28:49] laughter and things like that not at us
[28:52] but with us so if you see anything like
[28:55] that join in one thing
[28:58] if you would like to applaud that's fine
[29:00] but long extended applauds tend to um
[29:05] because we're doing some voice
[29:06] recordings so if it if your applause
[29:08] lasts too long then does that make sense
[29:11] am I can you read my mind without me
[29:14] having to explain the rest of this okay
[29:16] so we're ready to start just remember
[29:18] what I said about interacting and I hope
[29:20] you all enjoy this this skit is about
[29:24] how Jehovah through the ages of time was
[29:29] different to different people but was
[29:32] the same God to all and that the the
[29:37] different people through the Bible
[29:39] experience different things but we saved
[29:41] by the same God as are each of you so I
[29:44] hope you enjoy
[29:46] [Applause]
[29:56] it
[30:14] it is true we love everybody if God
[30:16] loved the sinner loved you a sinner as
[30:18] Paul says as such were some of you and
[30:20] he said don't you know that the perverse
[30:22] w't inherit the kingdom of God don't you
[30:24] know that those who are in sexual
[30:26] immorality and homosexuality will not
[30:28] inherit the kingdom of God and then you
[30:30] go a little bit further than that and
[30:31] Paul says of such were some of
[30:35] you but you he hath washed and he has
[30:38] cleaned I'm thankful for the grace of
[30:40] God how can I have Grace on somebody
[30:42] because God's given me so much
[30:45] grace and I may never know what it's
[30:47] like to experience listen my experience
[30:50] on the other side when I get to heaven
[30:52] my experience will be totally different
[30:54] from yours because God didn't call me to
[30:56] walk down the trail that he called me to
[30:58] walk down and I can't walk down your
[31:00] path and when I get there on that day
[31:02] I'm going to have a different story
[31:04] you're going to have a different story
[31:05] than
[31:07] me
[31:09] Abraham Isaac Jacob
[31:13] Jo all the prophets they trusted and
[31:18] believed that there was coming a
[31:22] resurrection that the Redeemer was
[31:24] coming they prophesied of him Enoch
[31:28] prophesied of him rested solemnly sealed
[31:31] his testimony with it Isaac
[31:37] Jacob Daniel Jeremiah Ezekiel they
[31:42] rested solemly upon the time that the
[31:45] Messiah would come and they died and
[31:49] their souls went into Paradise they
[31:52] could not go in the presence of God
[31:53] because the blood of bulls and goats
[31:55] could not forgive sins it only covered
[31:58] sins speaking of the day when the
[32:01] perfect sacrifice caus the blood of the
[32:02] animal could not come back to the
[32:04] worshipper for then he would have not
[32:06] ceased to offer sacrifices of that time
[32:10] but when the Son of God died the life
[32:12] that was in him with none other but God
[32:14] to come back and adopt us into the
[32:16] family of God and now we are children of
[32:26] God
[32:52] ah a new arrival welcome my brother
[32:55] where am I this is Paradise all who have
[32:58] followed the great and Holy One are sent
[33:00] here after they die great and holy one
[33:03] I'm not sure if I've ever followed
[33:04] anyone holy where is he I want to see
[33:07] him surely you must know of God you
[33:10] could not have been here otherwise we
[33:12] have all lived Our Lives unified with
[33:15] the Great I Am he is not a person you
[33:17] can see but if you've met him you would
[33:20] know how can I meet someone I can't even
[33:23] see we've all met him through different
[33:25] ways some of us through a pillar of fire
[33:27] or a cloud or a burning bush or even a
[33:32] still small voice but there's definitely
[33:34] no denying an encounter with the Lord
[33:37] I've never seen any of those
[33:39] things I'm sure our brother has not come
[33:42] by any way of deception the ways of our
[33:44] God are mysterious and perfect he would
[33:47] know the answer to how this man has come
[33:48] to be
[33:49] here Abraham why don't you and our new
[33:51] friend come and sit maybe we can tell
[33:53] more of Jehovah and he'll remember a
[33:55] time he made a choice to serve him wait
[33:57] you're Abraham as in like Father Abraham
[34:00] yeah but how do you know of me and not
[34:03] of God I went to public school this is
[34:06] going to be harder than I
[34:25] thought
[34:27] [Music]
[34:29] [Applause]
[34:31] about 2,000 years ago I was living with
[34:34] my wife in the land of Heron when one
[34:36] day God spoke to me and said I will make
[34:39] of thee a great nation and I will bless
[34:42] thee and make thy name great and thou
[34:44] shalt be a blessing and I will bless
[34:47] them that bless thee and curse them that
[34:49] curse thee and in thee All Families
[34:53] shall be
[34:55] blessed
[34:58] there were a few obstacles Not only was
[35:01] I 75 years old when God spoke to me but
[35:03] Sarai was Barren she had never been able
[35:06] to Bear a child how could I become a
[35:09] great nation if we could never have a
[35:11] child it seemed
[35:13] impossible but finally after 25 years of
[35:16] waiting we saw God's promise come to
[35:21] pass the child we so longed for was
[35:24] finally born to us our precious son
[35:27] restored joy into our hearts and we
[35:29] named him
[35:34] Isaac then one day God spoke to me
[35:38] again take now thy son thine only son
[35:41] Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into
[35:45] the land of Moriah and offer him there
[35:47] for a burnt offering upon one of the
[35:49] mountains which I will tell you
[35:54] of with a broken heart I saddled my
[35:57] donkey and took Isaac up to the place
[35:59] God told
[36:01] me I was afraid and sad but knew I must
[36:05] obey the great one who had given me my
[36:09] son my father behold the fire and the
[36:13] wood but where is the Lamb for a burnt
[36:16] offering my son God will provide himself
[36:20] a
[36:22] lamb my heart achd and my hands trembled
[36:26] but I kept the faith in God's promises
[36:29] that he would make my Offspring a great
[36:32] nation I knew he could raise my son From
[36:34] the Ashes if that's what it
[36:38] took before I could strike my son the
[36:41] angel of the Lord called out from above
[36:45] Abraham here I am lay not thine hand
[36:48] upon the lad neither do thou anything
[36:50] unto him for now I know that you fear
[36:53] God see and thou has not withheld thine
[36:56] only son son from
[36:59] [Laughter]
[37:01] me father I see a ram caught in the
[37:04] thicket by its
[37:08] horns the great Jehovah Gyra provided me
[37:11] with a son in my old age then he
[37:14] provided a ram to save my son he
[37:16] provided me with faith that I needed to
[37:18] pass the greatest test of my entire
[37:25] life
[37:38] [Applause]
[37:49] so you're telling me you took that
[37:51] innocent RAM and killed it surely you've
[37:54] heard of sacrifices to God yeah but I've
[37:57] never actually done them how are your
[38:00] sins covered if not for the innocent
[38:01] blood of bulls and goats I don't know
[38:04] but trust me there were a lot of
[38:06] sins this is very curious for in order
[38:09] for you to be here your sins must have
[38:12] been
[38:13] covered perhaps like our friend job here
[38:17] your parents have offered sin offerings
[38:20] in your
[38:21] behalf yeah even brother Enoch had to
[38:24] offer sacrifices and he was so close to
[38:26] God he was raptured raptured yes I will
[38:30] tell you the story of how finally taken
[38:33] from an evil civilization that despised
[38:36] me and my
[38:44] [Applause]
[38:55] God
[39:07] [Music]
[39:11] about 430 years before Abraham was even
[39:14] born I walked the Earth it was the most
[39:17] evil of times it seemed like there was
[39:20] nobody left on Earth that worshiped
[39:21] Jehovah I still performed the sacrifices
[39:24] of Jehovah While others followed pagan
[39:26] Gods I had no fellowship with
[39:28] like-minded Believers so I became even
[39:30] closer to the only one I could turn
[39:33] to look at Enoch freak H
[39:37] Rollero zah oh freak idiot your beliefs
[39:41] are not
[39:43] inclusive for 365 years I lived in these
[39:47] sinful conditions day after day I only
[39:50] found peace by walking with my God I
[39:52] didn't know that God would soon see fit
[39:54] to destroy the Earth in a great flood
[39:56] but he had other plans for
[39:58] me one day I was on a walk talking with
[40:01] the Lord like usual suddenly I felt a
[40:03] funny little feeling then I was
[40:07] here I never suffered the pain of death
[40:09] and the great Jehovah Shalom was my
[40:11] peace in the midst of great evil and
[40:13] ridicule and even greater was the peace
[40:15] I felt when I finally Rose above it
[40:25] all
[40:55] wo
[41:02] I never knew peace on Earth always lived
[41:04] in fear that I would end up dying and
[41:06] going to the Eternal void or something
[41:08] but the great Giver of Peace did not see
[41:10] fit to send you to the regions of the
[41:11] Lost we all feel Unworthy of this
[41:13] blessing how can you feel unworthy you
[41:16] were literally perfect nobody is perfect
[41:19] and we've all fought through many
[41:20] battles and
[41:23] temptations that is true brother Enoch
[41:26] why my life on Earth was nothing to be
[41:28] proud of I spent the first half of my
[41:30] life in sin in
[41:32] debauchery Rahab at least you want a
[41:34] backslider like me I think give more
[41:36] chances than anyone here I seriously
[41:39] doubt that let's tell you our stories
[41:41] and you can decide for
[41:55] yourself
[42:04] [Music]
[42:09] I wasn't born a Hebrew I was a canite
[42:12] living in the city of Jericho nearly
[42:15] 1,400 years ago my house was a part of
[42:18] the Great Wall surrounding the city I
[42:21] made my living the only way I knew how I
[42:23] was a
[42:24] harlot I prayed upon Travelers coming
[42:27] into the city and I was very successful
[42:30] until one day rumors had begun to spread
[42:33] of the Israelite Army and how their God
[42:35] was with them in battle everywhere they
[42:38] went they left a path of conquered
[42:39] enemies in their wake I had never known
[42:42] a God to actually dwell among his
[42:44] worshippers this particular day two
[42:46] strange men came into the
[42:51] city I was immediately ashamed of the
[42:54] way I was living I could tell tell these
[42:56] men were different than the other
[42:57] Travelers of Canaan I offered them a
[43:00] place to stay with me and my
[43:04] family not long after it became obvious
[43:07] that these men were Hebrew spies sent to
[43:08] search out the land the wicked king of
[43:11] Jericho sent word to me that he wanted
[43:13] me to deliver the men to
[43:15] him I knew I could never betray these
[43:18] men or their God and the only way to
[43:20] save my family was to ask this God to
[43:23] abide with me as he did with the Hebrews
[43:27] [Music]
[43:36] when the men searching for them had left
[43:37] to search outside the city I spoke with
[43:40] them I know the Lord has given you this
[43:44] land and all the inhabitants of the land
[43:46] fear you we have heard how the Lord
[43:49] dried up the water of the Red Sea for
[43:51] you and how you utterly destroyed the
[43:54] two kings of the amorites the Lord your
[43:56] God is God in heaven and in Earth I beg
[44:00] you swear to me by the Lord since I have
[44:02] shown you kindness that you will also
[44:04] show kindness unto my father's house
[44:06] that you will save alive all of my
[44:08] family and our possessions and Deliver
[44:10] us from death our life for yours if you
[44:13] tell no one of our business here when
[44:15] the Lord gives us this land we will deal
[44:17] kindly and honestly with
[44:20] you so I lowered them down from the wall
[44:24] by a scarlet cord and advised them to
[44:26] hide in the mountains until their
[44:27] pursuers
[44:30] returned when we return leave this
[44:33] Scarlet rope hanging from the window
[44:35] whoever is within your home will be
[44:40] spared I gathered my family and
[44:42] explained everything to them I told them
[44:44] of the god of Israel and how we could
[44:46] all be saved from the dreaded Hebrew
[44:48] Army I spent many hours in prayer to God
[44:51] and I knew beyond all doubt that he was
[44:53] with me and my family in our home
[44:59] I left the Scarlet rope hanging from my
[45:01] roof and when the Israelites arrived at
[45:03] the city I had nothing left to do but
[45:05] trust in the great Presence of Jehovah
[45:07] sha that now filled our home for 6 days
[45:11] the Israelites marched once per day
[45:12] around the city at first it was quite
[45:15] unsettling to all inside the city but
[45:17] after a few days they became a laughing
[45:19] stock my family stayed soberly in our
[45:22] home certain that God's plan was in
[45:24] motion
[45:29] on the seventh day they marched around
[45:31] the wall seven
[45:37] times now shout for the Lord has given
[45:40] you the city and all in the city shall
[45:44] be accursed only Rahab the Harlot shall
[45:47] live she and all that are with her in
[45:50] her
[45:54] house
[45:58] [Applause]
[46:24] y
[46:29] [Music]
[46:45] [Applause]
[46:51] W the walls to the city fell that day
[46:54] only one portion of the wall was Spar it
[46:56] was the house in the wall that Jehovah
[46:58] sha filled with his presence to preserve
[47:00] a lowly Gentile Harlot and her family
[47:04] the Hebrews accepted us into their
[47:06] nation and I married a good man of the
[47:08] tribe of Judah my great great grandson
[47:11] was the renowned King David God was
[47:14] truly with me from that time on and
[47:15] through the rest of my
[47:24] days
[47:37] [Applause]
[47:43] a thousand years ago my parents lived in
[47:45] the city of zor they had no children
[47:47] because my mother was Barren Israel
[47:49] lived in the backsliding condition in
[47:50] those days because of this the Lord had
[47:53] allowed them to live in the Captivity of
[47:54] the Philistines one day an angel came to
[47:57] my mother and promised that she would
[47:58] bear a son he commanded that she would
[48:00] not drink any wine or eat any unclean
[48:03] thing because when I was born I was to
[48:06] be a nazare unto God from the womb this
[48:09] also meant that I would never lay a
[48:11] razor to my head to cut my
[48:14] hair from a young age I felt the spirit
[48:17] of God moving on me God had designed me
[48:19] for a purpose to deliver his people from
[48:21] the hand of the
[48:23] Philistines I may not have looked like
[48:26] much not exactly the most ripped guy in
[48:28] the world but God had gave me a
[48:30] supernatural strength that would come
[48:31] over me in times of great
[48:34] need once I K with my bare
[48:38] hands then I killed 30 Philistines after
[48:41] I defeated them in a battle of wits
[48:44] so then I caught 300 foxes and then set
[48:47] them on fire in the Philistines corn
[48:50] fields they were not happy about that
[48:53] the feud was on the Philistines burn
[48:55] burned down my father-in-law's house
[48:57] while my wife was in it so I smoked
[49:03] them after that 3,000 Philistines came
[49:06] up to Judah to bind and kill
[49:09] [Music]
[49:12] me yes the spirit of God was with me and
[49:15] he fought through me many times I only
[49:18] had one weakness oh
[49:21] [Music]
[49:22] Samson I never could figure out how to
[49:25] resist him ation even after everything
[49:27] God had done for me I went looking for
[49:29] love in all the wrong places once I was
[49:32] in Gaza um doing things I was not proud
[49:35] of and the Philistines locked me in the
[49:38] city I was forced to rip off the 8,000lb
[49:40] gates hinges and
[49:44] all I carried them all the way down to
[49:46] Hein which was about 37 M
[49:54] away
[49:56] You' think I would have learned my
[49:57] lesson but no the Philistines had caught
[50:00] on to my weakness and they hired a woman
[50:02] to trick me night after night she begged
[50:05] me to tell her the secret to my Powers
[50:08] at first I thought it was just a joke
[50:10] and I made up a whole bunch of stuff
[50:12] just to get her off my back but then
[50:16] Samson you like don't even love me if
[50:18] you really did you would not lie to me
[50:20] all the time all you ever do is lie and
[50:23] lie like how am I supposed to ever trust
[50:25] you again if you won't even tell me the
[50:26] secret to your strength you are just
[50:28] making fun of me so you can laugh at me
[50:30] behind my back with all your little
[50:32] group of friends don't even act like you
[50:34] aren't Samson you are such a player
[50:37] Samson why are you always playing me
[50:40] fine I'll just tell you golly woman so I
[50:45] told her my secret and what do you think
[50:47] she did she shaved my head while I was
[50:49] sleeping then she sold me out to the
[50:52] Philistines that very night with my
[50:54] Nazarite vow broken my strength was gone
[50:58] they gouged out my eyes and made me
[51:00] grind a millstone in the
[51:04] prison I had a lot of time to think
[51:06] about that precious gift I had wasted
[51:09] why couldn't I just have been as strong
[51:10] spiritually as I was physically if I had
[51:13] been as righteous as my parents had
[51:15] raised me to be I could have delivered
[51:17] my brethren from the hand of the
[51:20] Philistines one day the Philistines had
[51:22] gathered together in a great celebration
[51:24] to their
[51:26] deeon they brought me out as proof of
[51:28] their God's might if only they knew that
[51:31] it was my own sin that had caused my
[51:36] [Applause]
[51:41] downfall oh Lord God please remember me
[51:44] strengthen me just once more let me die
[51:47] with these
[51:48] [Music]
[51:54] Philistines
[52:00] Jehovah sidu was my righteousness that
[52:02] day in my weakness he was strong and in
[52:06] my death I slew more Philistines than in
[52:08] my whole
[52:11] [Applause]
[52:24] life
[52:26] [Applause]
[52:41] [Applause]
[52:46] so you're telling me you just called at
[52:48] God called on God at your death and he
[52:49] accepted you just like that yes but at a
[52:52] great cost it was almost too late for me
[52:54] but I repented in the nick of time thank
[52:57] God you made the right choice brother
[52:58] Samson even so late I know what it feels
[53:01] like to be almost out of time what
[53:03] happened to you well it is not a long
[53:06] story but there was a Great Famine in
[53:08] the town of zarap where I lived my son
[53:11] and I were starving to death we had just
[53:14] enough oil and meal for one more small
[53:16] cake we were going to eat it and then we
[53:19] would die together one day God's Prophet
[53:23] Elijah came by and asked that I make him
[53:25] a cake to eat first there was something
[53:28] different about this man the great
[53:30] Jehovah righ had always been my shepherd
[53:33] and I knew in that moment he was guiding
[53:35] me I ran inside and made him a cake to
[53:38] eat and from that time on the Cru of oil
[53:40] never became dry and the barrel of meal
[53:43] was always full the Lord is my shepherd
[53:46] and I shall not want wow I've never
[53:49] heard such a miracle you're telling me
[53:52] it just multiplied right in front of
[53:53] your eyes indeed it did and it saved Our
[53:56] Lives no God can compare to the god of
[53:58] the Israelites my life was given back to
[54:00] me too let me tell you my story
[54:06] [Applause]
[54:24] friend
[54:32] [Applause]
[54:54] m
[54:58] [Music]
[55:04] my name is non about 800 years ago I was
[55:07] the captain of the host of the Syrian
[55:09] Army I was a fierce Warrior and an
[55:11] honorable man God blessed me in battle
[55:13] but something terrible befell me I was a
[55:16] leper I lived in disgrace and suffering
[55:18] because of my condition gross if not for
[55:22] my wife I would have taken my own life
[55:24] one day she came with news to me non the
[55:27] sweet little servant girl you brought
[55:28] for me from the land of Israel has just
[55:30] told me something very interesting she
[55:33] said there is a prophet in Samaria that
[55:35] can recover you from this
[55:37] condition the king of the Syrian Army
[55:40] immediately sent word to the king of
[55:42] Israel that I was coming to obtain my
[55:44] healing the king of Israel rent his
[55:47] garments in fear because he knew he had
[55:49] no power to heal
[55:51] me when the Prophet Elijah heard of the
[55:55] the king's dilemma he sent a servant to
[55:57] meet
[55:58] me go wash yourself in the Jordan seven
[56:02] times and your flesh will be renewed and
[56:05] you will be
[56:07] clean I thought the prophet would come
[56:09] and wave his hands to heal me but he
[56:11] wants me to wash in the Jordan are not
[56:13] the rivers of Damascus cleaner and
[56:15] better than the Jordan Master if the
[56:18] prophet would have asked you to do some
[56:20] great thing wouldn't you have done it
[56:22] and yet how simple it would be to wash
[56:25] and be clean so I went to the Jordan and
[56:28] I dipped myself seven
[56:37] [Applause]
[56:48] [Applause]
[56:53] times
[57:01] when I arose the seventh time my leprosy
[57:03] had disappeared and I was completely
[57:06] healed I knew that day there was no God
[57:08] on Earth but the god of Israel I thank
[57:11] the great Jehovah Rafa for healing me
[57:13] when no other power on Earth
[57:23] could
[57:30] [Applause]
[57:49] these are really great stories but I
[57:51] still don't know how I got here I've
[57:53] never been healed I never bathed in the
[57:56] Jordan River what if there's been a
[57:58] mistake what if I belong with the
[58:06] [Applause]
[58:19] Lost The Great I Am does not make
[58:22] mistakes we all belonged with the lost
[58:25] until our own encounter with the great
[58:27] one and we as children we wait here
[58:30] until he arrives he's coming here yes
[58:34] the great Messiah is coming here and
[58:35] he's going to set us all
[58:37] free one day we're going to leave this
[58:39] Dreamland and enter an eternal rest with
[58:42] him how long will we have to wait he
[58:44] could be here any time he was already
[58:46] born on Earth and when his plan is
[58:48] fulfilled he will come in
[58:50] glory how do you know all these things
[58:52] you've been dead for who knows how long
[58:56] long I met him let me tell you the story
[58:59] of the embodiment of the great Jehovah
[59:01] you have heard so much about I am John I
[59:04] was sent to Earth to forerun the coming
[59:06] of the Messiah I lived most of my life
[59:09] in the wilderness but when I came of age
[59:11] I knew there was work for me to do
[59:13] Jehovah ni my banner gave me the courage
[59:16] to stand up against all the backslidden
[59:18] ways of Israel I began to preach to
[59:20] everyone I could find about repentance
[59:22] and I took them to the river to baptize
[59:24] them one day as I was
[59:26] baptizing there he was I had always
[59:29] known it would be him on Earth he was my
[59:32] cousin Jesus but he was not of My Flesh
[59:34] and Blood I wasn't even I wasn't even
[59:38] worthy to loose his
[59:40] sandals when I saw him that day waiting
[59:42] to be baptized I knew I knew he was the
[59:46] one sent to save the world from their
[59:48] sins in his eyes was every name of
[59:51] Jehovah you have heard today he is The
[59:53] Great I Am and he is is the one to
[1:00:02] come I think it's time I tell my
[1:00:05] story I was not a good man on earth I
[1:00:08] did not know God and nor did I care to
[1:00:10] know God I was nothing but a thief my
[1:00:14] crimes they caught up to me I was
[1:00:17] crucified there were two other men on
[1:00:19] crosses next to me one was a thief just
[1:00:21] like me the other one was this this
[1:00:24] Jesus you
[1:00:28] mentioned the other Thief he began to
[1:00:31] mock him he said why don't you just save
[1:00:35] us all when I looked into the eyes of
[1:00:38] Jesus I seen this this great one you
[1:00:41] speak about and at that moment I had
[1:00:44] hated every evil thing I had ever
[1:00:47] done I didn't know if you would call
[1:00:49] Angels carry us down so I asked him will
[1:00:52] you remember me when you enter your
[1:00:53] kingdom he said he would but then I died

[1:07:32] been revealed in a way that was unique
[1:07:36] to anybody
[1:07:38] else and you know what Jesus says my
[1:07:41] brothers my sisters it is
[1:07:44] me I am the one that you waited for
[1:07:49] Abraham I am the one who met you under
[1:07:51] that oak tree that day it is me
[1:07:54] job it is me I am your Redeemer that you
[1:07:58] said and you went to your grave saying I
[1:08:00] shall see him standing upon the Earth
[1:08:03] Ezekiel I am the will in the middle of
[1:08:06] the
[1:08:07] will what was it he was something
[1:08:10] totally different to each believer but

[1:08:31] but you'll never go through what I go
[1:08:33] through you'll never hear the battles
[1:08:35] and and the times that the devil tries
[1:08:36] to come to me after preaching a sermon
[1:08:38] and for days erects my mind and tries to
[1:08:41] discourage me and put depression upon me
[1:08:43] and break clouds of Doubt around me you
