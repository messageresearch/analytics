[33:58] now lord as we commit it all to you in
[34:00] jesus christ's name
[34:02] amen you can be seated
[34:09] i'm going to turn in just a second to
[34:11] psalms 140 where we quoted and brothers
[34:13] you can have the powerpoint just ready
[34:15] uh you may just follow me
[34:17] uh here just for a minute with the
[34:19] scriptures is we're going to cover a few
[34:21] of them just preaching to you tonight on
[34:23] the real enemy
[34:24] and first timothy
[34:26] chapter 3 verse 7
[34:28] you don't have to turn here i'm just
[34:30] going to quote some of these they can
[34:31] throw it up on the screen if he would if
[34:33] they would want to
[34:35] but the apostle paul
[34:37] speaks of the enemy and he's speaking
[34:40] here even in ephesians 6
[34:42] of the enemy that we face
[34:44] and in first timothy he says lest he
[34:46] fallen into reproach
[34:48] and the snare
[34:50] of the devil
[34:52] and he gives us this word snare and
[34:54] what's amazing is this this word means a
[34:57] stratagem
[34:59] or a setup
[35:01] it speaks of the preparation like
[35:04] preparing for a trap
[35:06] and he speaks of satan how that he would
[35:08] try to entrap us or to try to snare us
[35:12] uh he says in psalms 140 this is david
[35:15] psalms 140 chapter 5
[35:17] the proud have hit a trap for me
[35:20] they have set snares for me
[35:23] what you find here and we're going to
[35:25] read a lot of these scriptures is that
[35:27] the devil is a real person and it's not
[35:30] a it's not a we don't we don't use the
[35:34] word god as a uh sorry as we don't use
[35:36] the word the devil as a metaphor for
[35:39] evil all of us here could look at evil
[35:41] in the world and we can identify it you
[35:43] just can point your finger at uh just a
[35:46] multitude of things and you could easily
[35:48] identify
[35:49] that would be evil or that would be
[35:51] wrong you could look at just crime you
[35:53] could look at murder or any kind of evil
[35:56] deed that you'd see in people and you
[35:59] would say that would be evil but evil
[36:02] the
[36:03] the bible speaks of a person called the
[36:06] devil
[36:07] and when you give a person a name it
[36:09] speaks of a person or a personality and
[36:12] so satan is a real person
[36:14] and as much as jesus or we don't use god
[36:18] as a metaphor to describe everything
[36:21] that's good
[36:22] but god is a real person
[36:24] his name is jesus he's a real person he
[36:26] has a real personality
[36:28] and so satan has a real personality he's
[36:32] going to be held accountable
[36:34] as an individual
[36:37] now not as not as a group of we see the
[36:40] symptoms of evil or we see the results
[36:43] of evil and we see all the evil in the
[36:45] world
[36:46] but there's going to be a person
[36:48] who's held accountable
[36:50] for that evil
[36:54] going to be a a there's a real devil and
[36:57] this the bible speaks of film and this
[36:58] is going to be some of what we're
[37:00] covering here today you're going to
[37:02] recognize
[37:03] uh some of what we're just going to look
[37:05] at as things that we told on uh in his
[37:08] sunday school i want you to follow me
[37:10] real closely here in with your bible and
[37:13] they can keep it on the screen if you
[37:15] can't get there in first john chapter 2
[37:17] verse 18 we're just going to read one
[37:19] verse and then we're going to go to
[37:21] first john chapter 4. first john 2 verse
[37:24] 18
[37:25] little children it is the last time
[37:28] and as you have heard that antichrist
[37:30] shall come
[37:31] even now are there many antichrists
[37:35] whereby we know that it is the last time
[37:38] first john 4 chapter 4 two chapters over
[37:41] verse three
[37:43] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[37:46] the spirits
[37:47] whether they are of god because many
[37:50] false prophets are going out into the
[37:52] world hereby know you the spirit of god
[37:54] every spirit that confesseth that jesus
[37:57] christ has come in the flesh is of god
[37:59] and every spirit that confesseth not
[38:01] that jesus christ has come in the flesh
[38:03] is not of god
[38:05] and this is that spirit of antichrist
[38:08] now not speaking of the person but
[38:11] speaking of the spirit of the person
[38:14] remember brother branham let's say if i
[38:16] had the spirit of beethoven i would
[38:18] compose music he said if i had the
[38:20] spirit of john dilliger i would i would
[38:22] have a gun and he says and if i had the
[38:24] spirit of christ then i would be meek
[38:27] and humble like christ i would produce
[38:30] christ
[38:31] and so you have a person and then you
[38:33] have the spirit of that person and then
[38:35] you have the works of that person and so
[38:38] he speaks here and he says this is the
[38:40] spirit of antichrist
[38:42] whereof you have heard that it should
[38:44] come and even now
[38:47] already
[38:48] is in the world
[38:50] and you see this all the way throughout
[38:52] the bible you'll see these names that
[38:54] he's referred to and calling him by
[38:56] different traits
[38:58] of his character uh it's all different
[39:01] traits but it's speaking of the same
[39:02] individual jehovah jireh jehovah rapha
[39:05] jehovah nissi those are not different
[39:08] persons
[39:09] but they're attributes of one person
[39:13] they're attributes of jehovah right
[39:15] follow
[39:17] and so the bible speaks of traits and at
[39:19] the same of the devil and it calls him
[39:21] in one place the son of the morning
[39:24] calls him the son of perdition the
[39:26] prince of darkness the man of sin
[39:29] the prince of the or the prince of the
[39:32] power of the air
[39:35] and so this is what the title that jesus
[39:37] gives him that he's the prince of this
[39:39] world
[39:40] he's a real enemy and you say brother
[39:42] matt why is that important because if
[39:43] you don't realize you're fighting a real
[39:47] person not a generic battle not just all
[39:50] of us in just a generic war but there's
[39:53] you've got a real person who is really
[39:56] fighting you really trying to destroy
[39:58] you really trying to corrupt you really
[40:00] trying to battle you it's who you face
[40:02] every day of your life as a believer
[40:04] and he's the bible speaks of that he's a
[40:07] he's the the the prince of darkness in
[40:09] fact jesus goes further and says he's
[40:12] the god of this evil age
[40:15] he's the man of sin the bible refers to
[40:17] him as the anti-christ
[40:19] and so what it speaks of is that in the
[40:22] book of revelations it says there's a a
[40:25] a a a a real devil a real serpent a real
[40:29] enemy who has a real plan who has a real
[40:32] blueprint who has a real idea or a real
[40:36] purpose
[40:37] and paul picks it up and says he's laid
[40:39] traps he has snares he studies you he
[40:43] watches you he knows how to entrap you
[40:46] or to entangle you he knows how to get
[40:49] at you more than anybody else can get at
[40:51] you the devil can yes amen
[40:55] and notice what he says here and i'm
[40:57] just going to take just a minute just to
[40:59] cover some of this just for foundation
[41:02] we know that there's the spirit of
[41:03] christ that works in the world and he's
[41:06] working with a purpose in the body in
[41:08] the mystical body today he's working in
[41:11] our lives he's accomplishing a purpose
[41:13] we have a savior
[41:15] a real man christ jesus the man don't
[41:18] ever think of him as some figment or
[41:20] some energy uh or or some good that you
[41:23] know that the uh the the modern
[41:25] spiritualist world uh worships today as
[41:28] some energy or some supernatural being
[41:31] and and they they they believe in some
[41:33] superpower but he's more than just an
[41:36] essence or more than just a power more
[41:39] than just an energy he's a real man he's
[41:41] a real person
[41:44] and he's right now alive living in glory
[41:48] right now he's he's alive right now
[41:51] he's a living person
[41:53] and and
[41:54] and and though we're though even though
[41:56] we're here on earth his spirit dwells
[41:58] within us that's why galatians 4 says
[42:01] because you are sons god hath sent forth
[42:04] his spirit
[42:05] into your hearts
[42:07] whereby we cry abba father
[42:10] and so yet we know there's another
[42:12] spirit at work just as much as this
[42:15] spirit of christ is at work there's an
[42:17] antichrist spirit
[42:20] at work
[42:21] and just as much as the spirit of christ
[42:24] is possessing and residing in the
[42:27] temples of people
[42:29] the spirit of the antichrist
[42:32] is living
[42:34] in temples of people
[42:37] do you believe that
[42:40] he's living and possessing people some
[42:43] of them
[42:44] christians
[42:45] and when we say christian i'm speaking
[42:47] of a a person who just claims the name
[42:50] or goes to church
[42:52] the world system the whole world today
[42:54] thinks that they're
[42:55] saved and that they're christians and
[42:58] born again because they go to church
[42:59] every sunday
[43:01] this is what john first john 4 3 says
[43:04] this is that spirit of antichrist
[43:06] wherever you have heard that it should
[43:07] come
[43:08] and even now
[43:10] already
[43:12] is in the world
[43:14] so john is saying you've heard of the
[43:16] antichrist coming
[43:18] it's been preached it's been told it's
[43:20] been spoken of
[43:22] uh and you've expected his arrival but
[43:25] beloved
[43:27] wake up
[43:28] amen
[43:29] because that spirit of antichrist is not
[43:32] only here he's working
[43:36] he's moving right now he's at work right
[43:38] now you're waging and fighting war
[43:42] now
[43:44] so we realize that they that antichrist
[43:46] spirit is not we're not waiting
[43:48] everyone's waiting for
[43:51] this uh
[43:52] you know this um this uh figure to
[43:55] appear
[43:56] and surely there will be a figure a
[43:58] false prophet an actual person
[44:00] who becomes satan incarnate but that's
[44:02] not what i'm speaking of here what we
[44:05] what we have to understand is that it's
[44:07] we're not waiting for the sudden
[44:09] appearing
[44:10] or this person to come on uh come on the
[44:13] scene and then suddenly uh you know he
[44:16] overwhelms and takes over churches and
[44:18] takes over people and everyone's
[44:20] worshipping him but right now his this
[44:23] his his workings are right now
[44:26] he's got a church right now he's got
[44:29] followers right now he's got cold
[44:32] apostate hearts that have given themself
[44:35] whether they know it or not over
[44:37] to his purpose and his plans now
[44:40] so rather than his spirit rather than in
[44:42] the future his spirit as much as the
[44:45] spirit of christ is at work his spirit
[44:48] is mysteriously at work now
[44:51] setting up his kingdom
[44:53] in cold hearts
[44:56] now
[44:58] you can you bear with me just a minute
[45:00] while i get through some of this before
[45:02] we get to a real thought
[45:04] and it speaks of the man of sin when he
[45:07] appears and the apostle paul warns of
[45:10] this and he says beloved
[45:12] try the spirits
[45:14] see if they be of god or not
[45:17] because the antichrist spirit is at work
[45:19] right now
[45:20] and so he said the last days there would
[45:22] come false prophets or false christs
[45:25] false anointed ones and they would
[45:27] infiltrate the church
[45:29] preaching another jesus
[45:32] one who we've not preached and and we've
[45:34] already seen the list of those false
[45:36] prophets who have you can look back and
[45:38] point even ones living now of false
[45:41] christs and false anointed ones who's
[45:43] deceived
[45:45] many millions of people
[45:48] and they're deceiving many millions of
[45:50] people right now and people follow them
[45:52] blindly without any discernment
[45:55] at all or whatsoever there's masses and
[45:59] millions of people
[46:01] who are deceived
[46:04] thank god that the bride won't be
[46:06] deceived
[46:07] thank god elected elected have their
[46:10] eyes opened
[46:12] and while the rest of the masses of the
[46:14] world are being deceived god said to
[46:16] elect it wouldn't be possible for them
[46:18] to be
[46:19] deceived
[46:21] listen to this here let no man deceive
[46:23] you by any means
[46:24] for the day that day shall not come
[46:26] except there cometh falling away first
[46:28] and that man of sin be revealed
[46:30] the son of perdition who opposeth
[46:34] and exalteth himself above all
[46:38] that is called god
[46:40] or that is worshiped
[46:42] so that he as god
[46:45] sitteth in the temple of god
[46:47] showing himself
[46:49] that he is god who i love these words
[46:51] here who opposeth
[46:54] and exalted himself above all that is
[46:57] called
[46:58] god
[46:59] so satan opposes you
[47:02] amen
[47:03] and satan opposes me
[47:05] and satan opposes the true church
[47:08] right
[47:10] he goes after true worship that's what
[47:12] he wants as we said here before he's
[47:14] much more interested
[47:17] in corrupting
[47:18] the church than removing the church
[47:22] he's much more interested in corrupting
[47:26] your heart or your faith
[47:28] or how you view god or how you view the
[47:31] world he's much more interested in
[47:34] corrupting your mind and your spirit and
[47:36] keeping your faith in place
[47:40] then he is removing it all together
[47:43] because that's his desire
[47:45] that's his motive
[47:47] that's his purpose
[47:48] to shipwreck the faith of god's family
[47:52] and he has no more greater desire than
[47:54] to destroy
[47:56] pure worship
[47:57] he tries to destroy everything that's
[47:59] pure in the world he hates purity
[48:03] all the while he loves religion
[48:06] he loves church
[48:09] he loves church more than a lot of
[48:11] church people
[48:13] satan comes to church every wednesday
[48:16] and every sunday
[48:18] he shows up every time the doors are
[48:20] open
[48:21] he loves church he hates purity he hates
[48:24] pure worship but he loves worship
[48:28] he's all for it
[48:30] he's all for it as his brother jason
[48:33] preached on sunday it was
[48:35] just absolutely awesome if you didn't
[48:37] get a chance to hear it go back and hear
[48:38] that by archive the feminization of the
[48:42] church and worship he loves music he
[48:45] loves worship he loves church he loves
[48:47] people
[48:49] but he he despises
[48:52] purity
[48:54] he despises
[48:55] sacredness satan hates sacredness
[48:58] he hates holiness
[49:01] despises it and he wants to rob god of
[49:05] all holiness and purity and and and
[49:08] praise he and this is this is this he
[49:10] uses the systems of the world that's why
[49:13] he's hijacked science he's hijacked
[49:16] education he's hijacked professors and
[49:20] colleges why do you think he doesn't
[49:22] remove them
[49:24] he would rather keep them in place to
[49:26] use them as tools to deceive masses
[49:31] he would rather much rather keep it even
[49:33] though it's a tree of knowledge of good
[49:35] and evil and some of the things go
[49:37] against his purpose and his plans he'd
[49:39] rather keep it in place and he hijacks
[49:41] education he hijacks uh entertainment
[49:45] comedy
[49:48] and he's is and his purpose is to
[49:50] destroy all the sacred you know i
[49:53] thought about this there that is going
[49:54] to be off topic but
[49:56] it was just incredible that you think of
[49:58] even the ten commandments that god gives
[50:01] the children of israel it gives them the
[50:03] law and the ten commandments you know
[50:05] one of the principles one of the
[50:07] overriding principles of the ten
[50:10] commandments is respect
[50:13] it's not all about respect but one of
[50:15] the overriding principles i thought
[50:17] about this the other day
[50:19] is respect
[50:21] all of the ten commandments all of them
[50:23] all ten of them
[50:25] could really come down to that principle
[50:28] that god was establishing if you want a
[50:31] whole society and you want to you want a
[50:33] wholesome society and a wholesome nation
[50:37] and wholesome families he gives them
[50:39] these ten laws and it's all based upon
[50:41] respecting god
[50:44] and respecting each other
[50:46] respect for god
[50:48] respect for his name
[50:50] respect for his day
[50:52] the sabbath
[50:53] it's all about respect it's all about
[50:55] keeping something pure
[50:57] sacred or holy
[50:59] and then he speaks of respect for people
[51:02] respect for family life
[51:06] satan has no respect for family life
[51:10] christian family life that is
[51:13] uh honor your father and mother
[51:17] amen what is it it's respect for family
[51:19] life it's a sacredness a respect for
[51:22] life itself don't murder
[51:26] it goes further than that respect for
[51:28] marriage don't commit adultery respect
[51:31] for people's property don't steal
[51:33] respect for people's reputation don't
[51:36] bear false witness respect
[51:38] respect
[51:40] a healthy
[51:41] whole society this is what god was given
[51:44] is build upon respect and first you
[51:47] respect god that's exactly what
[51:49] hollywood in the world system is trying
[51:51] to destroy and trying to tear down
[51:54] is respect
[51:56] they hate anything sacred or holy or
[52:00] respectful
[52:02] even even a com
[52:04] a popular comedian i don't remember his
[52:06] name now he was just on on on tv and and
[52:10] made it made a statement and said we
[52:12] intend we intend to leave nothing sacred
[52:18] and that's what they've done with comedy
[52:19] they've removed all sacredness out of
[52:21] everything they've removed the
[52:23] sacredness of marriage that's why they
[52:25] attack marriage in the courtroom that's
[52:27] why they attacked marriage in their in
[52:29] their agenda they they attacked
[52:31] relationships
[52:34] the sacredness of
[52:36] of a marriage being between one man and
[52:38] one woman
[52:40] they they they want to this is their
[52:42] this is what he said we intend to leave
[52:44] nothing sacred
[52:46] and i thought that if that isn't exactly
[52:48] what the devil's primary motive
[52:51] is to strip the world of all sacredness
[52:54] and naivety to to take children and rob
[52:58] them of their purity
[53:01] amen
[53:02] and and he uses tv he uses you say
[53:05] brother matt he doesn't come right out
[53:06] there and do it no but through all of
[53:08] the the different devices as paul said
[53:11] will be not ignorant of his devices he
[53:13] uses television he uses youtube he uses
[53:17] facebook he uses
[53:18] movies and entertainment video games
[53:22] these are all devices that satan uses to
[53:25] try to strip people's minds of purity
[53:29] and respect amen
[53:31] and now they wonder why they've lost
[53:34] respect for police they've lost respect
[53:36] for authority they've lost respect for
[53:39] uh
[53:40] rules and regulations
[53:43] respect for the law
[53:45] what happens to a society when you lose
[53:48] the sacredness and the respect of god's
[53:50] word
[53:51] you want to know what happens turn on
[53:53] fox news and you'll see
[53:56] don't turn on anybody else no i'm just
[53:58] kidding
[53:59] read your local newspaper read just look
[54:02] around you look at the world around you
[54:04] this is what happens when you remove
[54:07] respect and this is the purpose of the
[54:09] antichrist spirit but god's law is based
[54:13] upon respect love god love your neighbor
[54:16] respect god respect your neighbor keep
[54:19] things sacred a loss of respect for god
[54:24] always leads to
[54:25] idolatry and immorality and injustice is
[54:28] when you lose respect of that
[54:31] right you could be educated find
[54:33] education have a great education but
[54:36] lose your respect for god
[54:38] lose your respect for his word and
[54:40] you've lost all
[54:42] sacredness and purity
[54:45] and satan hates purity are you here
[54:50] he hates it this is why paul said in
[54:52] second corinthians 2 lest we be ignorant
[54:56] of satan's devices for we he says satan
[54:59] should get an advantage on us
[55:03] and we become ignorant or he outwits us
[55:05] or he outsmarts us for we are not
[55:08] unaware paul says of his schemes of his
[55:11] planning
[55:12] and that's why paul says beloved try the
[55:15] spirits
[55:17] see if they be of god or not you know
[55:19] you should test everything we should as
[55:22] believers and christians we should have
[55:24] enough spiritual discernment to test and
[55:27] try
[55:28] everything in our life that we take in
[55:31] oh uh
[55:32] every every ingest point should be
[55:35] guarded by the word of god
[55:38] every ingest point because it's an
[55:40] influence upon you it's an influence
[55:42] upon your family and you don't even
[55:44] realize sometimes the way that the
[55:47] devil's using something to just
[55:49] influence you
[55:51] remember he just comes to eve and he
[55:53] gives one word just changes one little
[55:55] word
[55:56] and he uses the same exact schemes today
[55:59] it uses anything to get us and before we
[56:01] know it we're completely our mind how we
[56:03] view church how we view church habits
[56:06] how we view christianity how we view
[56:08] dress code how we how we how we view
[56:11] these things it's incredible sometimes
[56:13] that a man of god can preach straight
[56:16] from the word of god and believers get
[56:18] offended yeah amen
[56:21] amen
[56:22] it should be a wake-up call this man
[56:24] didn't give his opinion i mean i i'm
[56:26] just gonna say it here you heard brother
[56:28] jason preach straight from the bible
[56:31] straight from the word of god it's
[56:33] incredible to me that anyone would have
[56:35] any hard time receiving amen
[56:39] something straight from the word of god
[56:42] and we're believers
[56:44] and this should be our appetite this is
[56:46] this we should be hungry for this
[56:48] [Applause]
[56:48] [Music]
[56:50] oh friends i'm not judging you or
[56:52] condemning you i'm saying god help us
[56:54] to to protect and make sure we try the
[56:56] spirits make sure we clean out all of
[56:59] our channels so that if anything that
[57:01] would block us from receiving the word
[57:03] of god
[57:04] amen
[57:06] we should be able to receive that purely
[57:08] before you know it satan is so used
[57:11] hollywood and and and whatever whatever
[57:14] venue you want to give because that's
[57:15] not that's not everybody's battle
[57:18] but whatever way whatever point satan
[57:20] can give you before you know it he so
[57:23] clogs up the channels and deforms you
[57:25] and distorts your thinking that now
[57:28] you're hearing the word of god
[57:30] and and you're and it's like a log jam
[57:32] it's not it's not you're not taking it
[57:34] and it's like it's right here it's right
[57:36] in the most purest form
[57:38] yeah beloved try not this try not to
[57:42] believe not every spirit but try them
[57:44] see whether they be of god or not
[57:46] so we understand we're not contending
[57:48] against flesh and blood
[57:50] but against spiritual wickedness
[57:54] in other dimensions
[57:58] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[58:00] blood but against spirit against
[58:02] principalities and powers
[58:05] in high places spiritual wickedness in
[58:08] other dimensions not ones that you can
[58:10] see
[58:11] but ones that are very much real
[58:14] very much real listen friends we're in a
[58:17] real war
[58:18] and a real battle
[58:20] we don't say we're in a war i'm not
[58:22] speaking i i i hope this sinks in here
[58:25] tonight
[58:26] i don't use spiritual war as a metaphor
[58:28] to describe what we're in i mean it
[58:30] literally you're in a spiritual war
[58:35] it's a real
[58:36] battle
[58:39] if anything
[58:40] real war or going to afghanistan or
[58:43] whatever you want to name or wars upon
[58:45] wars really that's only a metaphor to
[58:48] describe the real war
[58:50] if anything that's the that's just a
[58:52] metaphor to describe because human
[58:55] battles are only influenced or
[58:57] are happenings from spiritual wars
[59:01] or or or or
[59:03] no matter what you want to name in a
[59:06] physical realm it's only an attribute of
[59:08] an influence from a spiritual
[59:11] realm amen and a real spiritual world i
[59:14] read some i've read these before i just
[59:16] want to read them again lord just put it
[59:18] upon my heart here at the end if you
[59:20] want to display that powerpoint brother
[59:21] josh listen to what brother branham
[59:23] speaks of and these are going to be
[59:24] familiar to you but i want you just to
[59:26] read them
[59:27] uh if you could you have that powerpoint
[59:29] if not we'll just okay good now here
[59:32] notice what brother madam says here
[59:34] here's two spirits calling one to
[59:36] another
[59:37] i only wish that my lovely audience
[59:39] could be in this dimension
[59:41] and see this
[59:42] this woman standing here is suffering
[59:45] with the same thing that woman sitting
[59:47] there with her hands crossed like that
[59:49] and he says here's a dark line
[59:52] because the spirit that's on this woman
[59:55] is calling to this spirit
[59:58] for help and it's both the same disease
[1:00:03] arthritis
[1:00:04] which is a demon
[1:00:07] as brother adam said what is a demon
[1:00:09] spirit it means tormentor
[1:00:11] so demon is anything that would try to
[1:00:13] torment you
[1:00:15] and he uses arthritis to torment people
[1:00:18] he uses physical disease
[1:00:21] and he sends those to torment to torment
[1:00:24] you
[1:00:25] now we know that god uses that the same
[1:00:27] exact thing as paul was given a thorn in
[1:00:29] the flesh
[1:00:31] to keep him humble
[1:00:33] so satan god's purpose to give you a
[1:00:36] thorn remember this is never to torment
[1:00:38] you
[1:00:39] it's never a tormentor
[1:00:42] it's never to give you bitterness it
[1:00:43] could be to keep you humble or to put
[1:00:46] something in the way so that you don't
[1:00:47] go the wrong way but anytime satan gives
[1:00:50] you a sickness or attacks you in your
[1:00:52] marriage your relationship or your home
[1:00:55] or your health or no matter what area he
[1:00:57] attacks you in it's always to torment
[1:01:00] you because he's a tormentor
[1:01:03] and brother branham says the the spirit
[1:01:06] that's on this woman is calling to this
[1:01:08] spirit for help and it's both the same
[1:01:10] disease notice that here's two spirits
[1:01:13] now here's a prophet with a the vision
[1:01:16] to be able to the gift to be able to see
[1:01:18] into another dimension
[1:01:20] that's as real as the physical dimension
[1:01:24] these two women were in amen
[1:01:27] yet they couldn't see that there was
[1:01:28] something a spirit that was connecting
[1:01:31] with a dark line brother branham said
[1:01:34] there was a spirit that was connecting
[1:01:36] them and they had no idea wow
[1:01:40] had no idea that the same spirit that
[1:01:43] was on her was on her brother man says i
[1:01:45] only wish my lovely audience could see
[1:01:47] this listen to this as earnestly
[1:01:49] contending what if i told you that your
[1:01:51] heart trouble can be made well in jesus
[1:01:53] name you believe it then go
[1:01:55] just a minute and then brother madam
[1:01:57] says demons screamed
[1:02:00] something called for help
[1:02:03] demon power
[1:02:04] it come from the audience when this
[1:02:07] woman was killed that spirit
[1:02:10] screaming
[1:02:12] to one another
[1:02:14] for help
[1:02:16] it's the spiritual world we're not
[1:02:18] talking about the outside
[1:02:21] it's the spiritual you know why we we
[1:02:22] display these things to give you a peek
[1:02:25] just into another dimension in another
[1:02:27] world
[1:02:28] that is still here
[1:02:30] and is more active than it was in 1959
[1:02:34] when brother adam preached 1962 when
[1:02:36] brother adam preaches this it's more
[1:02:38] active now more so than ever before
[1:02:42] because as time goes further and time
[1:02:44] goes further the bible says he has great
[1:02:47] wrath and great fury knowing that his
[1:02:49] time is short
[1:02:51] and so brother adam says notice demons
[1:02:53] screamed they screamed out they cried
[1:02:56] out in another dimension
[1:02:59] in another dimension listen to this
[1:03:01] friends they're just as real as you're
[1:03:05] real
[1:03:06] and i see them many times when they
[1:03:09] leave right i've seen them leave right
[1:03:10] from this platform here i see them some
[1:03:14] of them in shape of bats
[1:03:17] look like long hairs hanging on their
[1:03:19] legs
[1:03:20] but an epileptic demon
[1:03:22] looks like a tortoise with round legs
[1:03:27] some of us ought to be glad we can't see
[1:03:29] that of the dimension
[1:03:32] he says looks like a tortoise with round
[1:03:34] legs hanging up like that but usually a
[1:03:37] demon of oppression
[1:03:39] seems to be more of a cloud form
[1:03:44] a demon of oppression
[1:03:47] like a wave
[1:03:48] and it just makes a real funny sound
[1:03:52] when you're
[1:03:53] in that other dimension
[1:03:56] to see the spirit now these are just a
[1:03:58] few examples brother adam gives here of
[1:04:00] demon powers just a few these are just a
[1:04:03] couple little snippets
[1:04:05] notice what he says here he says now you
[1:04:08] may think that's wrong but some of these
[1:04:10] days you'll realize if you could only
[1:04:13] take a spiritual looking glass
[1:04:16] and look in your soul
[1:04:20] you doubt
[1:04:22] and you'd find out what it looks like
[1:04:25] and the greatest devil the chief of all
[1:04:29] devils is
[1:04:30] unbelief
[1:04:33] incredible
[1:04:34] so paul says there's beings they're
[1:04:36] they're real they're as real as you or i
[1:04:39] are they're angels
[1:04:42] of influence it's the who is it it's the
[1:04:45] real enemy
[1:04:46] it's not your brother it's not your
[1:04:47] sister it's not your problem that you
[1:04:49] think is so great in your life right now
[1:04:53] no matter who it is or who you want to
[1:04:54] name or what you want to name
[1:04:57] the real enemy is the devil
[1:05:00] and his real purpose is to
[1:05:03] defect you to destroy you
[1:05:06] to to distort you to deform you in any
[1:05:09] way that he can
[1:05:11] even if it's a small victory or a small
[1:05:15] way and satan knows all he can get is
[1:05:17] just a small little level of victory in
[1:05:20] your life trust me he'll take it
[1:05:23] amen he'll take it and he'll come in the
[1:05:25] form of a complex it'll come in the form
[1:05:28] of a fear it'll come in the form of a
[1:05:30] spirit of some of some activity or some
[1:05:33] recreation or something any kind of
[1:05:36] foothold he can get in your life to trap
[1:05:39] you
[1:05:40] and to ensnare you and to entangle you
[1:05:44] real beings in a real supernatural
[1:05:47] world that is there all the time you
[1:05:51] know it speaks of the devil and it says
[1:05:53] he's like a roaring lion
[1:05:55] seeking whom he may devour
[1:05:58] not that he's a lion
[1:06:00] but he goes about like a lion
[1:06:03] in job where have you been
[1:06:05] satan oh just going to and fro
[1:06:09] in all of the earth now remember the
[1:06:11] earth is his kingdom this is his world
[1:06:14] hello
[1:06:16] hello jesus says this is he's the god of
[1:06:19] this world he's the god of this age this
[1:06:22] is his kingdom remember jesus said if
[1:06:24] this were my world if this was my
[1:06:26] kingdom my subjects would come and fight
[1:06:29] but that's that's that's coming but
[1:06:32] that's not now but now we're living in
[1:06:35] his world in his territory that's why he
[1:06:38] can control the white house that's why
[1:06:40] he can control politics that's why he
[1:06:42] controls the entertainment uh world of
[1:06:45] the of the world that's why he's the
[1:06:46] prince of the power of the air
[1:06:50] that fourth dimension
[1:06:52] and he he he operates in that dimension
[1:06:56] he operates in that unseen world and he
[1:06:59] preys upon complexes where have you been
[1:07:02] oh seeking going about seeking whom i
[1:07:04] may devour this is his world this is
[1:07:08] this is what he uses this is his game
[1:07:10] this is his plan this is his purpose
[1:07:14] and he says he's seeking whom i seeking
[1:07:17] whom i may devour he's like a lion
[1:07:20] seeking whom he may devour the bible
[1:07:22] speaks of him as a serpent
[1:07:24] i don't know i don't care understand
[1:07:26] people who like snakes i know why i
[1:07:28] don't like snakes
[1:07:32] i just read my bible and it says that
[1:07:33] old serpent
[1:07:35] called lucifer and i hate the devil and
[1:07:37] so i hate snakes
[1:07:40] you may like them i don't i kill
[1:07:41] everyone that i see unless it's a good
[1:07:43] one that i know is gonna you know kill
[1:07:45] rats and other animals there are there
[1:07:47] are i guess you could say
[1:07:49] i won't say there's good snakes but i'll
[1:07:50] say that there's
[1:07:52] snakes that serve a good purpose
[1:07:54] right
[1:07:56] and so
[1:07:57] but notice that it calls him us a snake
[1:08:00] he's a serpent he's like a prowling
[1:08:03] enemy
[1:08:04] the the bible speaks of him and calls
[1:08:06] him in one place and i think i have it
[1:08:08] here in my notes uh and one place is
[1:08:11] called abaddon let me just find it yes
[1:08:14] his names the bible refers to him as
[1:08:16] satan abaddon
[1:08:18] you know what that means in the in in in
[1:08:20] greek at me it's apollyon you know what
[1:08:23] it means destroyer
[1:08:27] destroyer
[1:08:28] would you ever attribute god to a title
[1:08:32] like destroyer no
[1:08:34] this is something there's a title given
[1:08:36] to the devil he's like he's a destroyer
[1:08:39] he's beelzebub
[1:08:43] if you knew what some of these names
[1:08:45] mean you would see how evil this is
[1:08:47] descriptors of how evil he is
[1:08:50] he's
[1:08:51] he's in one place called blile
[1:08:54] you know his name lucifer
[1:08:56] there's nothing good about those names
[1:08:58] he's
[1:08:59] just the descriptions
[1:09:02] of the of the of this man
[1:09:04] is subtle wicked
[1:09:06] unclean evil lying
[1:09:09] proud
[1:09:11] he's typed as different animals all
[1:09:13] throughout the bible a serpent a snake
[1:09:14] in the grass a red dragon
[1:09:20] and powerful a prowling lion
[1:09:23] now would you ever want to be
[1:09:26] locked up in a room
[1:09:28] a 10 by 10 room with a lion a snake and
[1:09:32] a dragon
[1:09:35] raise your hand young people would you
[1:09:37] ever like i know you think that'd be
[1:09:38] cool but really it wouldn't would you
[1:09:41] ever like to be in a room with a snake
[1:09:44] a lion
[1:09:45] and a dragon

[1:09:49] your room and you pull up the internet

[1:09:53] up your facebook and do you realize that
[1:09:55] you're in that room with that little
[1:09:57] dragon
[1:09:59] and that lion
[1:10:01] and that snake
[1:10:03] say for the matter are you preaching

[1:10:06] against that at all i'm letting you know
[1:10:09] you should be on guard

[1:10:25] knees and you bow your head and you say
[1:10:27] jesus and you enter into another
[1:10:30] spiritual dimension as much as there's
[1:10:33] as much as there's angels and a heavenly
[1:10:35] father there there's a there's a demon
[1:10:37] spirit and a destroyer trying to hinder
[1:10:40] you
[1:10:42] brother matt why is it so hard to pray
[1:10:45] well let me tell you he's the prince
[1:10:48] of the and has the power of the air
[1:10:52] the atmosphere
[1:10:55] so it's so hard to pray today because
[1:10:57] the atmosphere is against prayer
[1:11:00] it's against consecration it's against
[1:11:02] anything that's why you've got to
[1:11:04] sometimes you've got to labor you've got
[1:11:06] to you've got to work you you feel like
[1:11:07] you've got to really enter in or push in
[1:11:10] or pray through
[1:11:13] because this world is not my world
[1:11:16] it's not my home
[1:11:19] but you've got a real enemy
[1:11:21] do you realize every time i just want to
[1:11:23] bring clarification to that to go a
[1:11:24] little bit further every time you're in
[1:11:26] your your your own your uh no matter
[1:11:29] where you're at whether it's on a phone
[1:11:30] or not
[1:11:31] that spirit that comes to you and starts
[1:11:33] whispering to you and talking to you and
[1:11:35] trying to discourage you and depress you
[1:11:38] and oppress you he's subtle he's wicked
[1:11:41] he's unclean so anything unclean that
[1:11:44] comes in your mind came from him
[1:11:48] amen
[1:11:54] is this is what the devil speaks of him
[1:11:55] he's an entrapper he tries to ensnare
[1:11:59] and tries to
[1:12:00] entrap us
[1:12:03] i just just struggling to know which way
[1:12:05] to go and honest i'll go this this way
[1:12:07] just for a moment
[1:12:10] he speaks of this and he says in first
[1:12:12] timothy 3 7.
[1:12:14] let me read second timothy 2. if you
[1:12:16] have that pull it up on the screen
[1:12:18] second timothy chapter 2 and if you have
[1:12:20] your bible you can turn there with me
[1:12:23] too if they don't get it on the screen
[1:12:24] in time
[1:12:27] second timothy chapter two
[1:12:35] let's just read one verse i'm just going
[1:12:37] to read this just to save time
[1:12:39] this is verse 26
[1:12:41] and that they may recover themselves out
[1:12:45] of the snare
[1:12:46] of the devil
[1:12:48] who are taken captive by him notice that
[1:12:53] who are taken captive prisoner ensnared
[1:12:57] by him
[1:12:59] at his will we we read first timothy
[1:13:02] where it says lest he fall into the
[1:13:03] reproach
[1:13:05] and the snare or the entrapment of the
[1:13:08] of the devil and so you notice that
[1:13:11] satan is a schemer he's he's a planner
[1:13:14] you know many times satan has trapped us
[1:13:17] if we'd be honest
[1:13:20] i've been victim many times to his traps
[1:13:22] in my life
[1:13:24] lose my temper and then go back and lost
[1:13:26] my temper did something wrong and man i
[1:13:28] can just trace it after you get over it
[1:13:30] and you're done venting and you're
[1:13:32] repenting and your heart's humble again
[1:13:35] you trace it back and look all the back
[1:13:36] and go
[1:13:37] oh that dumb devil
[1:13:41] and you you you notice you watch the way
[1:13:42] he
[1:13:43] ensnared you or entrapped you and
[1:13:46] sometimes intricate
[1:13:48] intricate traps
[1:13:51] well-planned well-devised
[1:13:53] well-thought-out
[1:13:55] and listen to me brother and sister it's
[1:13:58] not a trap to go oh i got you
[1:14:01] no it has nothing to do with ha ha i got
[1:14:04] you it's all trying to destroy you
[1:14:07] he's trying to if he can't destroy you
[1:14:09] and take you off the earth he'll try to
[1:14:11] scar you or burn you or maim you
[1:14:16] he's burned many people and maimed many
[1:14:18] people maimed their marriages
[1:14:20] maimed their took them in childhood his
[1:14:22] teenage years and lives through the rest
[1:14:24] of their days with
[1:14:26] because of traps and ensnarements and
[1:14:28] places where satan has trapped them and
[1:14:31] snared them and now they lived with live
[1:14:33] with some of those
[1:14:34] scars
[1:14:35] are you here
[1:14:37] the wicked notice this is psalms 119 and
[1:14:40] you're going to have to be real good
[1:14:41] here with the um the scriptures i'm just
[1:14:44] gonna go through them quickly psalms
[1:14:46] chapter 119 notice this here in verse
[1:14:50] 1 110 psalms 119
[1:14:54] this is what david says he says the
[1:14:55] wicked
[1:14:57] now who's the wicked
[1:14:59] the devil
[1:15:01] he's going to give him a name
[1:15:02] because we're speaking of a person
[1:15:04] we're not speaking of an energy
[1:15:07] we're not speaking of a metaphor to
[1:15:09] describe something bad
[1:15:12] but know your enemy
[1:15:14] call him out by name that's what brother
[1:15:16] branham said to do he said call him out
[1:15:18] boo devil
[1:15:19] speak to him as who he is he's not just
[1:15:21] some some wicked force but david says
[1:15:24] the wicked notice this this is satan
[1:15:27] have laid a snare
[1:15:30] for me yet i air not
[1:15:33] from thy precepts
[1:15:35] notice psalms 124
[1:15:38] verse 7
[1:15:39] our soul is escaped as a bird this is
[1:15:42] psalms 124 verse 7. our soul is escaped
[1:15:46] as a bird out of the snare of the
[1:15:49] fowlers the snare is broken
[1:15:52] and we are escaped that's a testimony of
[1:15:55] a believer
[1:15:56] we have we've escaped thank god
[1:15:59] so notice he says these are satanic
[1:16:02] setups these are snares or entrapments
[1:16:05] ways to entangle you and if any way that
[1:16:08] he can he'll try to entangle you and
[1:16:10] entrap you and he'll use anything in
[1:16:13] your life notice i'm just gonna read
[1:16:14] this is a very familiar one be sober
[1:16:19] this is first peter be vigilant
[1:16:22] this is the warning to the christian
[1:16:25] be sober
[1:16:27] be vigilant
[1:16:29] you know that scripture
[1:16:31] he says because your adversary the devil
[1:16:34] first peter 5 because your adversary the
[1:16:37] devil as a roaring lion walketh about
[1:16:40] seeking whom he may
[1:16:44] devour
[1:16:46] feast upon feed upon
[1:16:50] seeking whom he may devour this is why
[1:16:53] paul says don't be ignorant unless he
[1:16:55] get a an advantage on you don't be
[1:16:57] ignorant
[1:16:58] of his
[1:16:59] devices
[1:17:01] so satan comes to us and listen to me
[1:17:04] our enemy will come to us at all seasons
[1:17:07] of our life
[1:17:08] you think life is just particularly hard
[1:17:12] now it will be in the next season
[1:17:14] and it will be in the next season and it
[1:17:16] will be in your older season your
[1:17:18] younger season your middle-aged season
[1:17:20] because you always have an enemy
[1:17:23] and at any season whether it's good
[1:17:25] times or bad times
[1:17:27] high times or low times
[1:17:30] sick times healthy times satan will
[1:17:32] attack you in any season low
[1:17:36] high
[1:17:36] good
[1:17:37] bad
[1:17:41] and he traps us and ensnares us he uses
[1:17:43] camouflage
[1:17:47] he uses ways to disguise himself
[1:17:50] as maybe something that seems so
[1:17:52] harmless
[1:17:55] and it doesn't seem like there's
[1:17:57] anything wrong with he'll use he'll use
[1:17:59] trickery
[1:18:01] he'll use good people
[1:18:03] people that you love
[1:18:06] and he'll use bad people he'll use
[1:18:08] enemies
[1:18:09] good times and bad times
[1:18:12] and he'll try to track us try to trap us
[1:18:15] and ensnare us
[1:18:17] you say brother matt then what do we do
[1:18:18] we pray
[1:18:20] for spiritual discernment
[1:18:24] as believers
[1:18:25] to try every spirit see if they be of
[1:18:28] god or not let the word of god you know
[1:18:31] what will always expose the devil the
[1:18:34] word
[1:18:35] will always expose the enemy amen
[1:18:39] take it back to the word of god
[1:18:42] give it the word test as brother branham
[1:18:44] says
[1:18:44] it'll always expose the enemy and one of
[1:18:47] the greatest things we could do by the
[1:18:49] preaching of the word of god is to
[1:18:51] expose the devil in your life i say lord
[1:18:54] give us preaching give me give me the
[1:18:58] word of god that exposes the traps of
[1:19:01] the devil in my life
[1:19:02] and if he's trying to entrap me or
[1:19:04] ensnare me expose him lord expose him
[1:19:08] for who he is don't let him hide under
[1:19:11] the cover of camouflage
[1:19:13] but expose him in my life in every area
[1:19:16] of my life oh i just want to ask you
[1:19:18] could you raise your hands and say lord
[1:19:20] expose the devil and all of his workings
[1:19:23] in my life
[1:19:26] you know david walked right into a
[1:19:27] satanic
[1:19:29] trap an ensnarement
[1:19:31] i think we've learned more about the
[1:19:34] attack of the enemy by through david's
[1:19:37] life than any other man in the bible
[1:19:40] and david comes to a place in his life
[1:19:42] and you know the story very well
[1:19:45] when he walked right into a trap
[1:19:47] and he was caught
[1:19:49] he was called
[1:19:51] and you notice that if you read all the
[1:19:54] way through and this is this is this is
[1:19:56] important and i don't really have time
[1:19:58] to get into this here on a wednesday
[1:20:00] night but if you look and you read
[1:20:02] through first samuel before you ever
[1:20:04] read about the sin with bathsheba you
[1:20:07] know what you should do is go back and
[1:20:09] read
[1:20:10] the lead up
[1:20:12] to the entrapment
[1:20:14] because oftentimes that's more important
[1:20:16] than the trap itself when you ask what
[1:20:18] what happened how did you get to this
[1:20:20] place not just where you fell
[1:20:23] but what conditions were around your
[1:20:25] life what was happening
[1:20:27] that that led you to this place and you
[1:20:30] know what happens to david and he was
[1:20:33] this was at a time when he was that
[1:20:36] he was he wasn't he wasn't in the caves
[1:20:38] he wasn't running he wasn't hiding he
[1:20:40] was well to do he was well off he was
[1:20:44] healthy he was strong
[1:20:46] financially just fine
[1:20:48] you could say he was on the high
[1:20:51] he was he was on a high not on a low
[1:20:54] sometimes we're on a high and sometimes
[1:20:55] we're on a low
[1:20:57] this is david at a high amen remember
[1:20:59] he'll attack at any season of your life
[1:21:02] and he comes to david in what you could
[1:21:04] call a high time of his life to where he
[1:21:06] just seemed like he had everything he
[1:21:08] wasn't running no longer a fugitive no
[1:21:11] longer living in caves
[1:21:13] you know and and running from the enemy
[1:21:16] but now he's at a he's well established
[1:21:19] he's well he's he's he's secure he's
[1:21:22] solid his family his life is home
[1:21:26] i don't read anything that i could find
[1:21:28] that was necessarily what you could say
[1:21:31] is in disarray or out of order
[1:21:34] but david now he's not in depression
[1:21:37] he's not writing psalms of
[1:21:39] discouragement
[1:21:41] he's he's not writing psalms to you know
[1:21:44] of of of of of true of enemies trying to
[1:21:46] destroy him
[1:21:48] but he said a good time is when life
[1:21:51] seems to just be flowing right
[1:21:53] and everything's going good and he's
[1:21:56] blessed and he's prosperous and he's
[1:21:59] loved and he's adored and he's the great
[1:22:01] king and then satan comes
[1:22:04] right in the moment of that great
[1:22:06] victory
[1:22:07] right in the right in the moment of the
[1:22:09] height of that great victory of what you
[1:22:12] could say for david would be a high time
[1:22:15] in his life
[1:22:16] and david is victorious he's conquering
[1:22:20] he'd been fighting on the front lines
[1:22:22] you go read and in first kings i think
[1:22:24] it's chapter 12 and david had been
[1:22:27] fighting the chapters before that he had
[1:22:29] been fighting uh the philistines and and
[1:22:33] and he had been getting victory i forget
[1:22:34] the army that he had just defeated and
[1:22:37] he had not fully defeated them
[1:22:40] and he had he had gotten victory and
[1:22:42] they had almost wiped out the entire
[1:22:44] army but there were some left over and
[1:22:46] so a season goes by in his life and then
[1:22:49] the bible says and it came to pass at
[1:22:52] the time when kings go to war
[1:22:56] so here's a season of david's life when
[1:22:59] he's at war he's fighting and now winner
[1:23:02] comes and there's a time of peace and
[1:23:04] he's at home he's in the castle
[1:23:06] and there's no war and then it comes to
[1:23:09] pass at the times when every other year
[1:23:11] david would saddle up he'd get his armor
[1:23:15] he'd get a sword he'd get his shield
[1:23:17] he'd wait for his leaders and his
[1:23:19] commanders and his captains
[1:23:21] and he would go to battle except this
[1:23:24] time
[1:23:24] he stays home
[1:23:26] amen
[1:23:27] except this time david decides for
[1:23:29] whatever reason
[1:23:31] to stay in jerusalem and it's at this
[1:23:35] moment when the rest of the army are off
[1:23:37] battling and off to war
[1:23:40] that david finds himself in his castle
[1:23:42] not at war
[1:23:44] not fighting with his sword down
[1:23:46] remember not not necessarily backslidden
[1:23:50] i hope i can just just say this here
[1:23:52] today i i don't have the authority of
[1:23:55] the scripture to say this is exa we
[1:23:56] don't have the details to this
[1:23:59] but let me just just preach to you here
[1:24:00] for a moment to say it wasn't
[1:24:02] necessarily a time where david's
[1:24:04] backslidden or do anything necessarily
[1:24:06] wrong he's just not in his post of duty
[1:24:11] and you know it's so important to be at
[1:24:13] our post of duty
[1:24:16] doing what god has called us to do
[1:24:19] and not off on the sidelines somewhere
[1:24:22] you say brother and i but i'm not doing
[1:24:23] anything wrong not necessarily didn't
[1:24:25] say you were but are you doing what the
[1:24:28] lord has called you to do are you on the
[1:24:30] front lines when it's a time of war when
[1:24:33] god is when when god is expecting
[1:24:35] something and others are depending upon
[1:24:37] you
[1:24:39] amen but i'm not i'm not brother you
[1:24:41] don't understand brother man i stream i
[1:24:44] still stream and i'm i may not be there
[1:24:46] physically but i'm still streaming with
[1:24:48] you guys and i'm i'm still praying and
[1:24:50] i'm not backslidden
[1:24:52] i better preach this from down here
[1:24:56] they can still see me on the camera
[1:24:58] though
[1:24:59] but um i'm just but are you are you
[1:25:01] doing what the lord's called you to do
[1:25:04] when you should be at war when you
[1:25:06] should be standing with your comrades
[1:25:11] amen
[1:25:16] where are you at david where what what's
[1:25:18] what's happening in your life
[1:25:20] it wasn't necessarily he was
[1:25:21] backslidding off doing something that he
[1:25:23] shouldn't be doing
[1:25:25] but he wasn't at his post of duty
[1:25:28] when god had called him
[1:25:30] to war
[1:25:32] when god had called him and said
[1:25:34] in like ephesians 6 paul says
[1:25:37] put on the whole armor of god well why
[1:25:39] put on the armor if you're not going to
[1:25:41] war
[1:25:43] put on the whole armor put on the helmet
[1:25:45] of salvation put on the sword take the
[1:25:48] sword of the spirit helm the the the
[1:25:50] shield of faith amen
[1:25:53] with all prayer your have your feet shod
[1:25:56] with the gospel of the preparation of
[1:25:58] peace but why
[1:26:00] put on armor
[1:26:02] why have a breastplate why have a helmet
[1:26:05] why have a sword unless god intends that
[1:26:08] we're going to be in a fight
[1:26:11] we're going to be in a struggle then
[1:26:12] we're going to have to have something to
[1:26:14] quench the darts of the enemy
[1:26:18] said brother man what does that mean let
[1:26:19] means to wake you up to tell you god
[1:26:22] intends for you to be at war amen
[1:26:26] and a struggle
[1:26:29] i'm a disciple you're also called to be
[1:26:31] a soldier
[1:26:33] so we preached two wednesdays ago you're
[1:26:34] also called to be a farmer
[1:26:36] you're also called to be an athlete
[1:26:39] to run the race to fight the good fight
[1:26:41] of faith amen amen somebody
[1:26:45] amen somebody
[1:26:48] and and it's it's a it's a real war
[1:26:52] if you don't believe you're in war you
[1:26:53] won't be prepared for what's coming to
[1:26:56] strike your home and your family and
[1:26:58] your mind you'll be called ill-prepared
[1:27:00] if you don't realize that you're in a
[1:27:02] battle
[1:27:04] you don't realize you're in a war i want
[1:27:06] to say lord i want to be ready
[1:27:08] i want to be ready lord don't let me be
[1:27:11] called you know
[1:27:13] don't don't let me be called unprepared
[1:27:15] when the enemy comes knocking on my door
[1:27:18] let me be prepared for the battle
[1:27:21] amen
[1:27:23] let me be prepared for what's coming not
[1:27:26] disillusioned
[1:27:27] by this world or the devices of this
[1:27:30] world let me realize there's a real
[1:27:33] conflict happening in 2021 right now
[1:27:38] real hardship a real risk real suffering
[1:27:42] uh this is this is what jesus says he
[1:27:45] says that he says that you're to expect
[1:27:47] tribulation
[1:27:50] that in this world you should expect
[1:27:53] trials
[1:27:54] and tribulation your sheep
[1:27:57] in the midst
[1:27:59] or in the middle of wolves
[1:28:01] trying to destroy you
[1:28:03] living
[1:28:05] in the enemy's territory
[1:28:07] not at home not in jerusalem not in the
[1:28:09] castle but you're at war
[1:28:12] and you're not here to make peace or
[1:28:14] sign a peace treaty with the devil i'm
[1:28:16] not here to sign a peace treaty with the
[1:28:18] devil that if i give so much compromise
[1:28:20] you'll lay off my back i'm not here to
[1:28:22] sign any peace agreement
[1:28:24] i'm here to let the devil know i'm at
[1:28:26] war and i intend to fight
[1:28:29] i intend to fight and wage war to the
[1:28:31] last breath in this body
[1:28:34] i'll fight against the enemy
[1:28:37] we we spoke last time on churchill and
[1:28:40] played an entire video of of his just a
[1:28:43] compilation of some of his inspiring
[1:28:46] speeches you know that no matter how
[1:28:48] much he warned them and warned them and
[1:28:51] warned them with all of his all of his
[1:28:54] warnings
[1:28:55] and continual warnings
[1:28:57] of of germany and the and the threat
[1:29:00] that they were facing did you know that
[1:29:02] most of the the brit brit uh the british
[1:29:05] people and all the rest of the british
[1:29:07] leaders they called it warmongering that
[1:29:09] that's what churchill was doing and
[1:29:10] ended up signing the peace treaty
[1:29:13] yeah
[1:29:14] with the devil
[1:29:15] with the enemy
[1:29:18] you know what it got him it almost got
[1:29:19] him destroyed
[1:29:21] scientists signed a signed a peace
[1:29:23] treaty
[1:29:24] and and and you know what happened they
[1:29:26] eventually had to declare war anyway
[1:29:30] no matter all the peace talks that they
[1:29:32] tried eventually they realized it wasn't
[1:29:34] going to work let me just tell you right
[1:29:36] now no matter how much you think you can
[1:29:37] sign a peace treaty with the devil
[1:29:39] you'll eventually realize you're going
[1:29:41] to have to someday either be taken
[1:29:43] prisoner or declare war on the devil
[1:29:47] either you'll be taken prisoner
[1:29:48] completely captive with your family and
[1:29:51] your children and that's happened sadly
[1:29:52] to so many people
[1:29:55] or you'll take your sword of the spirit
[1:29:57] and the shield of faith and the helmet
[1:29:58] of salvation
[1:30:00] and say i might have lost some battles
[1:30:02] but i'm going to win the war
[1:30:04] i might have some scars and i might have
[1:30:06] messed up and i'm not going to sit here
[1:30:07] and cry about all my mistakes but here's
[1:30:10] what i'm going to do i'm going to take
[1:30:11] the sword of the spirit i'm going to
[1:30:13] charge the line of the enemy hallelujah
[1:30:17] you got to expect to be in a struggle
[1:30:20] in a fight
[1:30:21] in a war
