[41:20] psalm psalms 143.
[41:26] it might surprise you that i'm going to

[41:31] because that the title
[41:34] that i would like by the help of the
[41:36] lord
[41:37] to take tonight is a deep
[41:40] calling to a deep response and you might
[41:44] well imagine that i would re take
[41:46] brother branham's text
[41:48] from the psalms on the as the deep
[41:50] calleth unto the deep
[41:52] uh but we're not going to take that as
[41:54] our text tonight we've got a couple of
[41:56] quotes from
[41:57] brother brown preached that sermon
[41:58] several times i think maybe three or
[42:00] four maybe five times
[42:02] and we're going to take one or two
[42:04] quotes out of
[42:05] a couple of those sermons but amen i
[42:08] felt
[42:08] inspired to take my thought tonight
[42:11] from psalms 143

[42:21] have tonight so if

[42:26] send it to me direct at whatsapp and
[42:28] i'll check at the end of the service
[42:31] to see what has perhaps come in i have
[42:34] two that have already come to me
[42:36] we're not going to hold you along
[42:37] tonight but i want to deliver my heart
[42:39] that'll be okay
[42:40] amen praise the lord psalms 143
[42:47] hear my prayer o lord give ear
[42:51] to my supplications in thy faithfulness
[42:54] answer me and in thy righteousness

[46:00] every time i read it so now tonight at
[46:03] long last to my delight
[46:05] i finally get to preach it i commit it
[46:07] now to you lord
[46:09] in jesus name amen god bless your
[46:12] friends as you're seated
[46:24] it's wonderful to be a christian isn't
[46:25] it
[46:27] brother branham you know i love quoting
[46:29] it and brother branham says it and
[46:31] with such a feeling in his heart and he
[46:33] just says oh i don't know what i could
[46:36] do
[46:36] if i wasn't a christian my
[46:39] when i when i think about the turmoil of
[46:42] the world and i think about what
[46:44] what humanity is facing today
[46:47] if i didn't have this message and this
[46:50] gospel
[46:51] and the hope and the spirit of god
[46:53] moving in our lives
[46:54] wow friends i mean you know sister gene
[46:57] and i we've talked so
[46:58] many times about you know how does the
[47:01] world
[47:02] cope without christ without this word
[47:05] and you know i it always just comes to
[47:08] me and i say you know mom
[47:09] they're they're not coping that's the
[47:12] whole thing
[47:13] that's why there's a epidemic of drugs
[47:15] and alcohol and abuse and
[47:17] and families breaking up and madness and
[47:20] and the politics and the
[47:21] and the perversion and the laws and the
[47:23] schools and and it's just uh you know
[47:26] all on the streets everywhere to where
[47:28] there's such contamination
[47:30] really friends you can't go anywhere and
[47:32] escape it you find that everywhere you
[47:34] turn
[47:35] that you're gonna find some semblance
[47:37] you know i'm glad we've got a church we
[47:39] can come into
[47:40] where we can just kind of let off the
[47:41] pressure a little bit amen
[47:43] amen monitors down just a little wee bit
[47:46] there for the mat
[47:47] um just a little hot on these monitors
[47:50] maybe
[47:50] drop the value maybe 10 15 percent so
[47:53] you know i'm glad that we have this here
[47:56] tonight
[47:57] and i'm glad that we have a word that we
[47:59] can put
[48:00] confidence in i appreciate a word that i
[48:04] can put confidence and i remember
[48:06] years ago i was witnessing to a very
[48:08] good friend of mine
[48:09] and i had witnessed to him before he
[48:11] just seemed you know that uncrackable
[48:13] nut
[48:14] and uh don't know i haven't seen him in
[48:16] years since we were
[48:18] since we were boys we were just
[48:19] teenagers working together
[48:21] you know i'd preach to him every day at
[48:23] work and you know he would
[48:24] he i i was trying to he was trying to
[48:26] tell me about
[48:28] you know his mormonism and i was trying
[48:29] to tell him about jesus amen
[48:31] and so you know i i and and and i
[48:34] i and so you know he i remember he
[48:36] wanted to have a meeting you know how
[48:38] they like to do they like to get you to
[48:40] where
[48:40] then they'll bring in all the big guns
[48:42] on you and surround you
[48:44] and so i was pretty young but i was had
[48:46] a lot of
[48:47] a lot of smoke in me back then and i was
[48:49] you know i loved a good
[48:50] spiritual scrap i'm a little bit ashamed
[48:54] of that now with some of the
[48:55] some of the spiritual scraps i got into
[48:57] you don't accomplish a whole lot
[48:59] just listen you don't accomplish a whole
[49:01] lot arguing because
[49:03] listen if the if the lord doesn't give
[49:05] them eyes to see
[49:06] then uh you know you're not going to be
[49:09] able
[49:10] uh excuse me here you're not going to be
[49:12] able to get them to see
[49:13] got it uh so you have to have the
[49:16] revelation of the lord
[49:18] amen and so i said to him i said greg
[49:21] i said you know his good friend of mine
[49:24] and i said
[49:25] because we had just sit down for
[49:26] probably wow probably
[49:29] at least an hour and you know he had his
[49:32] his team there
[49:33] and i was just there with my bible and
[49:35] uh
[49:36] you know we they got to talking about
[49:38] doctrine and and i just took him to task
[49:40] with their doctrine in the scriptures
[49:43] and we had we had an agreement
[49:45] at the beginning i won't bring any books
[49:47] of william branham you don't
[49:49] read me anything out of the book of
[49:50] mormon sound like a fair deal
[49:52] amen we just take it based on the bible
[49:55] we all believe the bible yes you believe
[49:57] it absolutely
[49:58] cover the cover yes all inspired yes you
[50:01] believe
[50:01] every word just as it's written
[50:03] absolutely it's the inspired word of god
[50:05] and so me and my ridiculous young
[50:08] arrogance
[50:09] you know i'm i'm you know spouting off
[50:11] to them well in 10 minutes i'll have you
[50:13] retracting that statement
[50:15] i mean they did in 10 minutes retract
[50:17] that statement but
[50:18] it that still wasn't the point the point
[50:20] was
[50:21] that it was you know obnoxious and rude
[50:23] of me to be that way because it didn't
[50:25] win anything
[50:26] uh you know it just embarrassed them and
[50:28] uh but you know then
[50:30] but then i did i felt convicted at that
[50:33] moment and i thought wow lord
[50:35] what have i really done and um i think
[50:38] that's where the lord because i'd been
[50:39] up up to that time doing it quite a bit
[50:41] sister debbie used to just fuss at me
[50:43] all the time well you know what are you
[50:44] accomplishing
[50:45] i said well you know i got to prove my
[50:46] point but so the lord really dealt with
[50:49] me and i realized friends you know
[50:51] and i i felt sorry for him and i just
[50:53] said listen fellas it's not really about
[50:55] convincing one another i said i just i
[50:58] would be sad i'm just telling you from
[51:00] my heart i said no all right
[51:01] bible's closed debate's over argument's
[51:04] over
[51:04] we should have never argued i said i'm
[51:06] just telling you
[51:07] that i'm going to pray for you because i
[51:09] would be very sad i'd be a sad
[51:12] person if if everything
[51:16] that i had believed my whole life
[51:19] and had been taught in the word of god
[51:22] and from the message of the hour and i
[51:25] had
[51:25] from a child been raised up like greg
[51:28] and these men had
[51:30] and somebody could come down and sit in
[51:32] front of me
[51:34] and take this book and just blow gaping
[51:37] holes
[51:38] through my doctrine i mean holes big
[51:41] enough you could drive a talk through
[51:43] and i just said i would be a very
[51:46] very depressed person amen
[51:50] so you know i stand before you tonight
[51:53] very glad to say you don't ever have to
[51:56] worry about that
[51:58] because i'm here to tell you that what
[52:00] god has sent us in this day
[52:02] it it cannot be resisted in this book
[52:07] and i have i have offered that around
[52:09] the world and i have never in all my
[52:11] years of ministering
[52:13] found anyone who could successfully do
[52:15] it and it doesn't even take
[52:17] long and it has nothing to do with my
[52:19] intelligence or your intelligence
[52:21] it's that god sent his intelligence
[52:24] aren't you glad for that so you know we
[52:27] can
[52:28] we have an anchor that's steadfast and
[52:30] it's sure
[52:32] but it's not but it's not you know i
[52:33] want to move in tonight to something
[52:35] beyond
[52:36] you know doctrinal clarity yes we can
[52:39] prove what we preach
[52:40] yes the doctrines can be displayed
[52:44] genesis to revelations no they don't log
[52:46] jam anywhere in the bible
[52:48] not one of them do and i'm glad for that
[52:51] but yet it takes more than that
[52:54] i'm glad that it can dovetail but it
[52:56] takes more than that i'm glad i can
[52:58] understand it with my mind i'm glad i
[53:00] can preach it to you
[53:01] i'm glad you can get it but it takes
[53:04] more than that
[53:06] because brother branham when he was
[53:08] accused of not knowing his bible
[53:10] very well which was pretty funny to me
[53:13] that brother branham
[53:14] didn't defend that he just said well i
[53:18] know the author real well
[53:20] because that you know the author is
[53:23] that's it that's all there is to
[53:24] to worry about is knowing the author
[53:27] because
[53:28] the author promised he would reveal his
[53:30] word to you
[53:32] he would reveal himself to you but you
[53:34] know friends i'm sure
[53:36] that you agree with me that when we when
[53:39] we take this
[53:40] idea of a deep calling for a deep
[53:43] response and brother branham talks about
[53:46] how that
[53:48] that you couldn't have this thirst
[53:51] this longing this hunger except there
[53:54] was something in existence to meet that
[53:56] or you couldn't that couldn't exist
[53:58] remember that and so so brother branham
[54:02] picks up here in the in the in one of
[54:04] his
[54:04] many times of deep call to the deep
[54:07] this one is in june 24 1954
[54:12] and he says if he was ever around an
[54:14] eagle's nest you remember him telling
[54:15] the story
[54:16] there on the uh on the film deep call to
[54:19] the deep that's another one that he
[54:20] preaches in washington dc
[54:22] and and we find that he he tells how
[54:24] that he's
[54:25] watching that eagle remember that story
[54:27] through the binoculars
[54:28] she's way up high and he said he had
[54:31] been watching
[54:32] and all those little guys were in the
[54:33] nest and they were just
[54:35] you know terrible time until she put her
[54:37] wings out you remember that
[54:38] and they get on the wing and she brings
[54:41] them down
[54:41] sets them into the end of the pasture
[54:43] below and then she climbs back to the
[54:45] highest rock to watch them remember that
[54:47] and so brother branham says he's he's
[54:49] starting to talk about now
[54:50] the release that they had on this meadow
[54:54] and he says you know the have you ever
[54:56] been around
[54:57] an eagle's nest they make it out of
[54:59] sharp sticks and things and then poor
[55:01] little eagles
[55:02] was just walking on those sticks and
[55:04] thorns and they never know nothing else
[55:06] see but one day the mother spread forth
[55:09] her wings and they stepped on the wings
[55:10] and went down
[55:12] now he said i looked at those little
[55:13] fellas and they were just
[55:16] having a pentecostal revival they were
[55:19] running around on that
[55:21] soft grass just picking up here and
[55:24] chirping to one another and jumping over
[55:26] each other
[55:27] just as free as they could be and a
[55:30] prophet catches a contrast
[55:32] catches a spiritual contrast he says i
[55:34] thought well that's right
[55:36] now there is like a man in the old
[55:39] nest of the world knows nothing but
[55:43] what the devil can give him amen
[55:46] i mean that that's a sad statement to me
[55:49] that a man born he's just born in the
[55:52] nest of the world and all he knows is
[55:54] sharp sticks and sharp things to walk
[55:57] around on and trip on and get cut on and
[55:59] get bruised on
[56:00] and he said he knows nothing else but
[56:03] that
[56:03] sin an old nest of the world he knows
[56:07] nothing but that
[56:08] but what the devil can give him but one
[56:11] day
[56:12] god picks him up and sets him down
[56:15] in the shady green pastures and and
[56:18] and and we can you know as believers we
[56:21] can relate to that
[56:22] you know especially when we go back and
[56:25] we think about our lives
[56:26] prior to this shady green pasture when
[56:29] you think about your life you know and
[56:31] it doesn't even matter maybe you were
[56:32] raised in a christian home maybe you're
[56:34] raised
[56:35] you know to in a christian church maybe
[56:37] in a message church
[56:38] like like i was but you know you still
[56:41] realize that until you came born again
[56:44] you were just
[56:44] walking around in the prickly nest of
[56:47] the best that satan can give you
[56:49] and his best ain't very good
[56:52] you know i i say that to people all the
[56:55] time young people especially
[56:56] just take it from me the world has
[57:00] nothing to offer
[57:01] but sticks and stones and cuts and
[57:04] bruises
[57:05] and stabs and it's not fun and i don't
[57:08] care in your
[57:09] whatever you want to make out of it at
[57:10] its best level you know what
[57:12] it still is a depressing place life is
[57:15] hard
[57:17] and then you die
[57:20] that's what they say life is hard and
[57:22] then you die
[57:26] so you know there's something to be said
[57:29] then
[57:30] you know that that there's something
[57:33] that is so
[57:34] right to a believer about this story
[57:38] as i was saying that he you realize that
[57:41] you've come to something that's more
[57:43] than a head knowledge
[57:45] you've come to something that's just
[57:47] more than doctrinally accurate
[57:49] and you have to otherwise you're never
[57:51] gonna you're never gonna get that thirst
[57:53] that deep
[57:54] that that hunger that's never going to
[57:57] be met
[57:58] until you step on the wings of jehovah
[58:01] and let him take you out of the nest of
[58:03] the world i don't care what you
[58:05] accomplish until he takes you out of the
[58:07] nest
[58:08] and sets you on shady green pastures
[58:11] you have very little to look forward to
[58:14] in this life
[58:18] this is a a troublesome time for
[58:22] david the 143rd psalm
[58:25] the occasion of the psalm of course is
[58:26] david fleeing jerusalem from absalom
[58:29] ii samuel chapter 15 through chapter 18
[58:32] a very very very sad story
[58:34] not going to elaborate on it tonight at
[58:37] all
[58:37] you you've no doubt read that since your
[58:39] days in sunday school
[58:41] so now david you know this is the time
[58:43] where
[58:45] where you know it's all coming due it's
[58:47] it's all coming time to
[58:50] you know the consequences of something
[58:53] that had been long ago in his past
[58:55] and he had been able to stay ahead of it
[58:58] you know he had
[58:59] he'd been able just to to keep things
[59:01] rolling the prophet had told him
[59:03] you know you're going to have a problem
[59:04] in your family it's going to meet you
[59:06] down the road
[59:07] but you know it's david had managed to
[59:10] to race ahead of it
[59:11] but now here comes absalom and and then
[59:14] even that had taken years over a decade
[59:16] to develop and there had been a
[59:18] a killing there had been a you know a
[59:20] sister attacked and then he murdered him
[59:22] and then he had to flee and then david
[59:23] brings him back and
[59:24] this goes on this goes on for years and
[59:27] you know it's
[59:28] it's it's not that david is running out
[59:31] of the city
[59:33] uh you know repenting for being a sinner
[59:36] at
[59:36] this point david has had his
[59:38] relationship
[59:40] restored to god and he's he's
[59:44] he's he's he's bringing about this great
[59:47] contrast and i think that one of the
[59:48] great lessons of psalms 143
[59:51] is the very sharp contrast between
[59:54] what israel thought was righteousness
[59:58] amen but that versus god's
[1:00:01] actual righteousness that there is such
[1:00:04] a contrast
[1:00:05] say i'm i'm a good person i live a right
[1:00:08] kind of life
[1:00:08] let me tell you your best effort is so
[1:00:11] much lower
[1:00:12] it's filthiness to him he can't use any
[1:00:15] of your holiness
[1:00:16] he can only use his own holiness it's
[1:00:19] not that you have anything to offer him
[1:00:21] it's that we have to
[1:00:22] we we should be here tonight so grateful
[1:00:25] that that i could say
[1:00:26] nothing in my arms i bring it
[1:00:30] simply to thy cross i cling and the lord
[1:00:33] of glory would say
[1:00:34] that's enough i have nothing that's okay
[1:00:39] i have everything i i can bring you
[1:00:41] nothing i can offer you nothing i've had
[1:00:43] nothing but failures don't matter i i
[1:00:46] don't have any failures i'll give you my
[1:00:47] life
[1:00:48] that that is shady green pastures
[1:00:51] friends
[1:00:55] israel's righteousness one one
[1:00:57] commentator
[1:00:58] said that israel was learning that their
[1:01:00] righteousness would carry no freight in
[1:01:02] time
[1:01:02] trouble i thought what an amazing
[1:01:06] statement
[1:01:07] it rang in my heart
[1:01:10] israel's righteousness will carry no
[1:01:12] freight in time of trouble
[1:01:13] you know that's a lesson for us all that
[1:01:17] i'm here to tell you no amount of
[1:01:19] self-sufficiency
[1:01:20] no amount of talent and skill and
[1:01:22] education money wealth position
[1:01:25] popularity
[1:01:26] fortune and glory friends and fame
[1:01:28] nothing
[1:01:29] can equip you to get through this life
[1:01:33] amen this life has so
[1:01:36] many inherent problems
[1:01:39] you have to understand you're born into
[1:01:42] a world
[1:01:43] that's under a curse you're born into a
[1:01:46] body
[1:01:47] built from a cursed earth your soul is
[1:01:51] black and smutty and cut off from god
[1:01:53] your mind is the enemy of god and you're
[1:01:56] an alien
[1:01:57] from the commonwealth of his kingdom
[1:02:02] and then as as if that's not bad enough
[1:02:04] the world is covered
[1:02:06] over with ungodly ungodly men who have
[1:02:09] who have taken sin to levels that
[1:02:12] were almost unimaginable would have been
[1:02:15] unspeakable
[1:02:17] just decades ago i mean just in the
[1:02:21] previous century
[1:02:22] there are things today that are common
[1:02:26] common accepted
[1:02:30] that would have been almost unspeakable
[1:02:34] just a couple decades ago that's the
[1:02:36] rate of acceleration to insanity
[1:02:38] that this world is on it's on a path of
[1:02:41] self-destruction and god's going to let
[1:02:43] it
[1:02:44] he's going to let it he's not going to
[1:02:46] destroy he don't have to
[1:02:47] he'll just get out of the way and let
[1:02:48] man destroy it see
[1:02:51] so we find that you know no amount of
[1:02:54] your own
[1:02:55] ability is going to haul freight for you
[1:02:57] in time of trouble i want you to absorb
[1:02:59] that
[1:03:00] if you're young here tonight your young
[1:03:01] people listen up close
[1:03:03] there's no amount of your abilities or
[1:03:05] skills that'll haul freight for you in
[1:03:07] time of trouble
[1:03:09] you'll find that you can't get through
[1:03:10] life you'll find yourself train wrecked
[1:03:13] shipwrecked blowed up off the side you
[1:03:15] won't be able to navigate
[1:03:17] the world is too crazy too sinful
[1:03:20] you're going to need a guide
[1:03:24] you're going to need somebody to take
[1:03:26] over your life
[1:03:28] you'll never be able to get to safe
[1:03:31] harbor
[1:03:32] amen so we find that this
[1:03:36] this this my un unfathomable distance
[1:03:40] unbridgeable if i could call it that
[1:03:44] even to try to bridge the the the
[1:03:47] difference between the righteousness of
[1:03:49] god
[1:03:50] and the best efforts of man-made
[1:03:53] righteousness
[1:03:54] now of course i think that when we look
[1:03:57] at our text here
[1:03:58] you know david no doubt is you know some
[1:04:02] of his suffering
[1:04:03] that he's going through here being
[1:04:04] chased out of jerusalem
[1:04:06] uh he's suffering you know sprang from
[1:04:08] his own sin
[1:04:10] because i mean that's pretty obvious
[1:04:12] because he's asking god
[1:04:13] not to judge him remember that so it's
[1:04:16] so i'm not i don't i don't want you to
[1:04:18] get the wrong idea when i get when i
[1:04:20] really get to where my heart is on this
[1:04:22] psalm
[1:04:23] certainly david is feeling the weight
[1:04:27] and god is letting him and god will let
[1:04:30] you and
[1:04:30] and and you know i i i i appreciate
[1:04:35] the forgiveness of my sins but i you
[1:04:38] know i would not want god to just strike
[1:04:40] it out completely out of my memory
[1:04:42] because i want to remember
[1:04:44] where he saved me from i want to
[1:04:46] remember
[1:04:48] the the craziness of going that way
[1:04:51] i want to learn from my mistakes
[1:04:55] and david is certainly learning you know
[1:04:58] he's pleading with the lord
[1:05:01] you know don't enter into judgment with
[1:05:03] thy servant
[1:05:04] for in thy sight shall no man
[1:05:07] be justified and so you know he's
[1:05:11] he's finding out that he that he can't
[1:05:14] stand
[1:05:15] you know with his own righteousness uh
[1:05:18] before god nobody can
[1:05:19] david is saying no man can stand don't
[1:05:22] take me there
[1:05:23] because i can't stand there and no man
[1:05:25] can stand
[1:05:26] in your righteousness everyone is
[1:05:29] unrighteousness is in the sight of god
[1:05:32] and so david then appealed to god to
[1:05:36] answer his prayer and this is a real
[1:05:38] turn
[1:05:39] are you ready for this david
[1:05:42] is appealing to god to answer his prayer
[1:05:45] because of god's righteousness
[1:05:49] amen because of god's faithfulness
[1:05:53] the scripture says that even even if we
[1:05:57] are unfaithful he remains faithful
[1:06:01] because he cannot deny himself
[1:06:04] do you understand how secure
[1:06:08] you are in the love of god
[1:06:11] that you're you're so far down the scale
[1:06:14] that
[1:06:14] no amount of good deeds you could ever
[1:06:16] do could get you to be
[1:06:18] judged uh you know in his in his
[1:06:20] judgment and pass the grade you'd be
[1:06:22] destroyed
[1:06:23] and so i want you to know that you're
[1:06:25] going into heaven tonight
[1:06:27] not on any righteousness that you've
[1:06:29] done but because he's righteous
[1:06:32] and because he's faithful
[1:06:35] to his family to give them his righteous
[1:06:39] so he
[1:06:40] he prays quicken me o lord as we were in
[1:06:43] verse 11.
[1:06:43] quicken me o lord for thy name's sake
[1:06:46] for thy righteousness
[1:06:48] sake bring my soul out of trouble
[1:06:54] i've said that i know you've said that
[1:06:56] lord i i couldn't stand in your judgment
[1:06:59] i said you know i remember
[1:07:01] early in the morning hour sun wasn't
[1:07:03] even up and i was sitting there
[1:07:04] early reading and that lord just led me
[1:07:07] to this it was so incredible i even had
[1:07:08] a testimony to my wife
[1:07:10] later when she got up and i said you
[1:07:12] know and i
[1:07:13] i said it's so amazing to me
[1:07:16] because when i woke up early that
[1:07:19] morning and i don't remember it was a
[1:07:21] couple weeks ago probably
[1:07:23] i was praying
[1:07:26] like this and i hadn't
[1:07:30] read this since probably the last time i
[1:07:32] read through the
[1:07:33] the whole testament or the
[1:07:36] uh even even reading the whole book of
[1:07:38] psalms i think those are things you
[1:07:39] should read
[1:07:40] you know reread them and start over and
[1:07:42] read them on a regular basis
[1:07:44] and i hadn't remembered this psalm in
[1:07:47] quite a long time and
[1:07:49] and i woke up that morning
[1:07:52] and i it was on my heart brother jason
[1:07:54] it was so amazing because
[1:07:56] i woke up saying lord you know my
[1:07:59] my way to wake up is just to begin
[1:08:01] praising him immediately
[1:08:02] i'm thank you i've woke up i've got
[1:08:04] another i've got another day to serve
[1:08:06] you
[1:08:06] you know i've got my darling still with
[1:08:08] me i've life is still here there's more
[1:08:10] i can do
[1:08:11] you know i don't care what the devil's
[1:08:13] doing what's happening in the world
[1:08:15] i get to be a christian i get to serve
[1:08:17] god i get to do
[1:08:19] something for him maybe you maybe you're
[1:08:22] looking at me like i'm
[1:08:23] kooky but you're looking at a man who
[1:08:25] feels so
[1:08:26] privileged to be alive i feel so
[1:08:29] privileged with what god has called me
[1:08:31] to do
[1:08:33] oh my and i was just saying that lord
[1:08:37] and then of course there's always like
[1:08:38] you like me we're all alike
[1:08:40] you come to those you come to those
[1:08:42] moments and you say lord
[1:08:43] there's just nothing you know you're
[1:08:45] crying and there's nothing good in me
[1:08:47] and it's all you
[1:08:48] and oh lord if it happened for you and
[1:08:51] it's you and it's you and it's your
[1:08:53] mercy and it's your love and
[1:08:54] i was no good when you found me and i
[1:08:57] failed you but you keep going and
[1:08:59] you won't throw me away thank you thank
[1:09:01] you thank you and i just said lord
[1:09:03] i got nothing to offer you but a heart
[1:09:06] that loves you
[1:09:06] i got nothing to do but surrender all i
[1:09:09] can do is rely on your faithfulness and
[1:09:12] your righteousness hallelujah i was
[1:09:15] i was getting swept away as i was laying
[1:09:17] there in the bed
[1:09:18] crying and trying not to wake my wife up
[1:09:20] so early and i get out of bed and i grab
[1:09:22] my bible i go sit in the room and i open
[1:09:24] up to psalms 143
[1:09:26] and here's david praying this very
[1:09:28] prayer not because of my righteousness
[1:09:31] because of yours not because i've been
[1:09:33] faithful i haven't but you're
[1:09:34] faithful you love me
[1:09:38] hallelujah oh friends
[1:09:42] this sermon has been so heavy on my
[1:09:44] heart for weeks lord when are you gonna
[1:09:46] let me preach it
[1:09:48] hmm we've all said that lord i can't
[1:09:52] stand in your judgment
[1:09:55] and you know if you're like me you
[1:09:58] you you're aware and you're
[1:10:02] you're so aware you're painfully aware
[1:10:05] that that even if i lived a perfect life
[1:10:09] i couldn't stand in his righteousness
[1:10:12] think about that that's that's how
[1:10:16] high his righteousness is that's how
[1:10:19] pure his life is it's
[1:10:22] flawless it's clear as crystal
[1:10:27] god is so pure he's the fountain there's
[1:10:31] no contaminant in him no shadow of
[1:10:34] turning the bible says
[1:10:36] oh all good gifts come
[1:10:40] down from above from the father of
[1:10:43] lights in whom has no shadow
[1:10:46] no variable there's no shadow of turning
[1:10:50] he's always loving he's always kind he's
[1:10:53] always
[1:10:54] just he's always full of mercy his
[1:10:56] throne is established in mercy
[1:11:00] mercy rejoiceth against judgment
[1:11:03] god is always looking to find a way to
[1:11:06] forgive you
[1:11:07] he's always looking for a way to redeem
[1:11:10] you
[1:11:10] he's always looking for a way to woo you
[1:11:13] back when you get away
[1:11:14] he'll wait he'll wait and he'll put an
[1:11:16] arm around you come back child
[1:11:17] come back child that's the love of god
[1:11:20] faithful beyond description a god that
[1:11:24] faithful i couldn't stand if i had a
[1:11:27] perfect life
[1:11:28] and i say lord if i had a perfect life i
[1:11:30] couldn't stand in your judgment
[1:11:31] so don't even take me there don't even
[1:11:35] take me there let's just not even go to
[1:11:37] your judgment
[1:11:38] at all just let me walk under the
[1:11:42] shadows of your mercy

[1:11:50] you can

[1:13:49] here several steps back

[1:14:07] think that i can say today and i'm
[1:14:09] i believe that you can you can relate
[1:14:12] with me that through it all somehow i
[1:14:15] always
[1:14:16] knew he loved me
[1:14:19] i always get that sense from him you
[1:14:22] know i
[1:14:23] i ran as a teenager sure
[1:14:26] i ran as a young man so sometimes i
[1:14:28] still find myself running from his will
[1:14:32] amen sometimes i still find myself
[1:14:37] you know you come up and you see the
[1:14:39] lord's will for you in a certain thing
[1:14:41] and you run from that it's not exactly
[1:14:42] how you wanted it not how you planned it
[1:14:45] you know and uh too often we find
[1:14:47] ourselves come on all you holy people
[1:14:50] too often we find ourselves running from
[1:14:52] the clear commands of his word amen
[1:14:56] everybody just do this
[1:15:01] lord you see that we're just being
[1:15:03] honest tonight
[1:15:07] you know chasing my own human affections
[1:15:10] you ever done that chasing your own
[1:15:13] ambitions chasing your own ideas
[1:15:15] see i got good news for you
[1:15:19] he still loves you i have found that to
[1:15:23] be so
[1:15:24] true i have found myself chasing my own
[1:15:27] ambitions
[1:15:27] he still loves me chasing my own will he
[1:15:30] still loves me
[1:15:31] how do you know he loves you because i
[1:15:32] get corrected
[1:15:36] somebody grabs him by the arm and around
[1:15:38] and around we go
[1:15:41] oh my he loves me he won't change his
[1:15:44] heart
[1:15:45] towards me that's a beautiful thing do
[1:15:48] you say how do you know he won't change
[1:15:51] what if you do something extremely i
[1:15:53] mean brother jason come on i mean
[1:15:54] what if you really pushed it you you
[1:15:57] sure
[1:15:57] that he wouldn't stop loving you i know
[1:16:00] he wouldn't
[1:16:01] say how do you know because i found out
[1:16:04] in his secret book
[1:16:05] that he actually loved me before the
[1:16:06] foundation of the world
[1:16:08] he already loved me before i was even
[1:16:10] here he already knew all the failures i
[1:16:12] would have
[1:16:12] and he loved me at the start there's
[1:16:15] nothing i'm going to do that he
[1:16:17] isn't already aware of and he made a
[1:16:19] decision
[1:16:20] to love me i can't talk him out of it
[1:16:23] you can't talk him out of it
[1:16:24] the devil sure can't talk him out of it
[1:16:28] amen satan can't get him to change his
[1:16:32] mind
[1:16:35] but now can i turn a corner
[1:16:40] this hunger this longing this
[1:16:44] thirst like david it
[1:16:49] and i i so relate to david i'm sure
[1:16:53] when i get on the other side it's always
[1:16:55] been one of my favorite bible characters
[1:16:57] i'm sure when i get on the other side
[1:17:00] i'm going to meet him
[1:17:01] and i'm going to say hey dave
[1:17:06] you know in 2020 on october what's the
[1:17:08] date seventh
[1:17:10] i preach he's going yeah yeah you preach
[1:17:11] the sermon about yeah you had it you
[1:17:12] were right
[1:17:13] you exactly you were right on the money
[1:17:16] i know i
[1:17:17] am see and
[1:17:20] and and david's longing
[1:17:23] david's crushing all consuming hunger
[1:17:28] it wasn't coming from failure
[1:17:31] of course he had regrets he was
[1:17:34] suffering
[1:17:35] absalom chasing him out was a long line
[1:17:39] of
[1:17:39] finally caught up to him from mistakes
[1:17:41] he had made
[1:17:42] you know back years ago mistakes long
[1:17:45] ago dealt with
[1:17:46] god had already forgave him that wasn't
[1:17:48] the issue
[1:17:49] god had already forgave him it already
[1:17:52] been moved on judgment had already been
[1:17:53] passed out
[1:17:54] that you know it's reaping and sowing
[1:17:57] is not the judgment of god that reaping
[1:18:01] and sowing
[1:18:01] is the laws of nature you reap what you
[1:18:04] sow
[1:18:06] it's not god going oh boy look what you
[1:18:08] sowed i'm gonna get you
[1:18:10] god i don't have to do a thing god just
[1:18:12] put a law in nature you
[1:18:14] you sow a certain seed you're going to
[1:18:15] grow that crop exactly
[1:18:17] and god don't it's not god chasing you
[1:18:19] down i'm going to beat you over the head
[1:18:20] with your
[1:18:21] with the fruits of your sin that that's
[1:18:23] not it you're reaping your own your own
[1:18:25] rewards
[1:18:28] so judgment had already been actually
[1:18:30] judgment had already been a sign and
[1:18:31] david had lost a child
[1:18:33] over that whole debacle with
[1:18:36] bathsheba but the prophet told him your
[1:18:39] sin is put away now that's an amazing
[1:18:41] thing because
[1:18:42] there was nothing david could do do you
[1:18:44] know in the old testament
[1:18:45] there was no sacrifice david could bring
[1:18:48] for that
[1:18:49] that was willful sin there was no
[1:18:51] offering for that
[1:18:53] you couldn't bring that you he couldn't
[1:18:55] bring a lamb or a turtledove he could
[1:18:57] have brought a thousand of them it
[1:18:58] wouldn't have mattered
[1:18:59] there was no offering he could do for
[1:19:01] that willful adultery and murder he
[1:19:03] intentionally cold-blooded in the first
[1:19:05] degree with malice and forethought had a
[1:19:07] man killed
[1:19:08] and took his wife in adultery there was
[1:19:10] no
[1:19:11] nothing in moses law that could atone
[1:19:13] for that and he was supposed to die
[1:19:16] and god tells him through the prophet
[1:19:18] you're not going to die
[1:19:20] as for your sin you know what he told
[1:19:22] him as for your sin
[1:19:25] the supreme judge says he's put it away
[1:19:29] and you're not going to die however a
[1:19:32] sword will never leave your house
[1:19:34] and you're going to pay for this in in
[1:19:36] in a payment plan
[1:19:37] you're going to have to make payments
[1:19:39] all the way along you'll have a lot of
[1:19:40] trouble from this day forward and he did
[1:19:42] because he was reaping what he sowed you
[1:19:45] know if i if i could get every
[1:19:47] if i could get every child from about
[1:19:49] the age of
[1:19:50] maybe 10 11 12 years old and up
[1:19:54] to get this in your head you
[1:19:57] reap what you sow and if you so
[1:20:01] and the and the the the beauty and the
[1:20:05] the beauty and the terror at the same
[1:20:07] time is that if you reap good seed
[1:20:09] you always if you sow good seed you
[1:20:12] always reap more
[1:20:13] than you sow you sow a single seed you
[1:20:15] reap a crop with all kinds of seed
[1:20:17] but in perfect contradistinction
[1:20:20] if you sow bad seed if you sow to the
[1:20:22] wind you know what you
[1:20:24] reap you reap a tornado oh you saw i
[1:20:27] only sowed to the wind right but the
[1:20:29] laws of reaping
[1:20:30] sowing and reaping mean that whatever
[1:20:31] you plant comes back in a much
[1:20:33] multiplied stage depends on which side
[1:20:36] you sow it in
[1:20:37] everything you do is a seed everything
[1:20:39] you think is a seed everything you say
[1:20:41] is a seed
[1:20:42] and it grows a crop
[1:20:46] remember that it grows a crop your best
[1:20:49] bet if you've got a truckload of bad
[1:20:51] seed that you sowed
[1:20:52] you better thank god for the story of
[1:20:55] esther
[1:20:56] yeah thank god for esther because you
[1:20:58] know what esther could do
[1:20:59] they couldn't undo that once the king
[1:21:01] had said that made the command there was
[1:21:03] no way to undo it
[1:21:04] the laws of the means and persians
[1:21:06] couldn't be undone it's like god i'm god
[1:21:07] i changed not i can't take it back i've
[1:21:09] said you reap what you sow
[1:21:10] i can't undo that for you even though i
[1:21:12] love you so you know what the king told
[1:21:14] he said now here's what you do he said
[1:21:15] you'll go out and you'll
[1:21:17] you'll sow new seed over the top of that
[1:21:19] old seed
[1:21:20] and here's what it'll do instead of on
[1:21:23] on friday
[1:21:24] when everybody gets to kill you and all
[1:21:25] your people on
[1:21:27] thursday the day before y'all can go
[1:21:29] kill all of your enemies
[1:21:31] so that when friday comes and that law
[1:21:33] comes into force you ain't got no
[1:21:34] enemies
[1:21:36] so what did what did he do the the the
[1:21:38] next seed
[1:21:40] that was sown destroyed the effect
[1:21:43] of the first so if you've got a i just
[1:21:45] gave you that today if you've got a lot
[1:21:46] of bad seed
[1:21:47] just start sowing good seed on top of
[1:21:49] that and when that when that good seed
[1:21:52] comes up it'll destroy the effect of
[1:21:53] that
[1:21:54] that that's the one beautiful thing that
[1:21:56] god provides for his family
[1:21:59] but david is not running in in sin he's
[1:22:02] this he hasn't had a recent failure
[1:22:04] this kind of longing this hunger's not
[1:22:07] coming from that
[1:22:08] this deep calling doesn't come from some
[1:22:11] from some recent failure in david's life
[1:22:14] david the judgment had been dealt with
[1:22:16] just like me just like you
[1:22:18] i i say here i say yes i've i've i've
[1:22:21] had plenty of times where
[1:22:22] you know i was running as a teenager
[1:22:25] running as a young man or even
[1:22:27] admitting here that i don't even
[1:22:28] sometimes now find myself
[1:22:30] uh you know running the opposite away of
[1:22:33] god's will
[1:22:34] for my life but but it's not because i'm
[1:22:37] a secret sinner my whole life's under
[1:22:38] the blood
[1:22:39] thank god aren't you glad today that you
[1:22:43] can stand here not be a hypocrite and
[1:22:44] say i'm a christian
[1:22:46] do you make mistakes of course i do but
[1:22:48] that's that's not in my heart to do that
[1:22:50] i'm under the blood i've been changed
[1:22:52] i got a new nature i don't even want to
[1:22:55] do that stuff anymore
[1:22:57] and so my whole life is under the blood
[1:22:59] yes
[1:23:00] we've all been sinners in our
[1:23:02] unconverted past
[1:23:04] and maybe as i said earlier maybe even
[1:23:06] raised up in a church like me
[1:23:07] may be raised up as a in a believer's
[1:23:09] home like me but
[1:23:11] but at times also you know a secret
[1:23:13] sinner
[1:23:16] in the times before we were converted
[1:23:19] amen
[1:23:20] see and and that's why david is saying
[1:23:24] enter not into judgment with thy servant
[1:23:26] for in thy sight shall no man living be
[1:23:28] justified
[1:23:29] but that's not my life for many years
[1:23:31] now
[1:23:33] that's not my life i'm not a sinner
[1:23:35] anymore so then
[1:23:36] so then why do we have verse four
[1:23:40] this spirit where he feels so
[1:23:43] overwhelmed
[1:23:44] therefore in verse four therefore is my
[1:23:47] spirit
[1:23:48] overwhelmed within me my heart within me
[1:23:52] is
[1:23:52] desolate he's not
[1:23:57] this isn't the cry of a sinful man
[1:23:59] trying to repent because he's being
[1:24:00] chased out of it
[1:24:02] out of his capital like i say that sin
[1:24:05] has long ago been dealt with
[1:24:07] no friends no i'm here to tell you today
[1:24:10] i know by experience this is a different
[1:24:12] hunger this isn't coming from
[1:24:14] from regret this is a different hunger
[1:24:16] this isn't coming from fresh sin
[1:24:18] this is a different hunger this is a
[1:24:20] different deep calling this is a
[1:24:22] different thirst
[1:24:25] oh my david had you know when uh when
[1:24:28] when i
[1:24:28] and you say well then then what is it
[1:24:32] brother jason well i think it's in the
[1:24:33] very next verse
[1:24:35] in verse 5 i remember the days
[1:24:39] of old i meditate on
[1:24:42] all thy works i muse on the
[1:24:46] work of thy hands
[1:24:49] because you know david had gotten to a
[1:24:52] point now
[1:24:53] and maybe this is where i was the other
[1:24:55] morning early maybe this is where
[1:24:57] you are tonight or maybe where the lord
[1:24:59] is going to bring you to
[1:25:00] tonight and maybe he's about to do
[1:25:02] something very special
[1:25:04] in your heart in this service tonight
[1:25:06] because i began as a at my age now
[1:25:09] i i'm like i say i'm not a secret sinner
[1:25:12] that's long ago that's my old life
[1:25:14] but but now it's it's as if the more i
[1:25:18] know him
[1:25:19] then the more i want to know him my muse
[1:25:21] on his old ways i think about the world
[1:25:23] i think about my life i think about the
[1:25:25] faithfulness of god
[1:25:26] i've been down the road long enough now
[1:25:29] to know that god loves me
[1:25:31] i've been on this way long enough to
[1:25:33] know that i can't make him stop
[1:25:34] loving me i've been going long enough to
[1:25:36] know that he's faithful and he's just
[1:25:38] and you can trust him
[1:25:40] and that causes me to rise up with a
[1:25:42] deep call
[1:25:44] a deep hunger not because i've i've got
[1:25:46] some sin but because
[1:25:48] i i find that the more i know him the
[1:25:50] more i want to be
[1:25:52] like him i i can't rest day or night
[1:25:56] i'm not happy with where i'm at and i
[1:25:57] say but you're a christian but i want to
[1:25:59] be a
[1:25:59] better christian but you love god i want
[1:26:02] to love him more
[1:26:02] oh to love him more deep within my heart
[1:26:06] i want to know him i want to know him
[1:26:08] more i want to love him more
[1:26:09] i want to be more i want to do more for
[1:26:12] him
[1:26:13] this is where david was
[1:26:17] i think david was where we all are at
[1:26:19] times we still see too much
[1:26:22] it's where i'm at i still see too much
[1:26:24] of
[1:26:25] of me in the way
[1:26:29] you ever feel like that and that's why
[1:26:32] you come to verse six
[1:26:34] david says i stretch forth my hands unto
[1:26:37] thee
[1:26:38] my soul thirsteth after thee
[1:26:41] as a thirsty land verse 10
[1:26:44] teach me to do thy will for thou art my
[1:26:48] god thy spirit is good lead me into the
[1:26:52] land of
[1:26:53] uprightness
[1:26:56] lead me lord into the land of
[1:26:58] uprightness
[1:27:00] this isn't this isn't david you know
[1:27:04] running running sure he's
[1:27:07] he's being deposed sure it's breaking
[1:27:10] his heart
[1:27:11] but it's it's not just at that level
[1:27:13] this is going
[1:27:14] this is going beyond something that you
[1:27:16] know that every day-to-day human
[1:27:18] existence
[1:27:19] i'm here to tell you something friends i
[1:27:20] believe that the closer that we get to
[1:27:22] the catching away
[1:27:23] the more real it's becoming the more i
[1:27:26] long for those shady green
[1:27:27] pastures i long for mama eagle to
[1:27:30] stretch out her wings and
[1:27:32] carry me off back into the oh hallelujah
[1:27:35] back to the clef of the rock
[1:27:43] so many
[1:27:47] sad scenes that and we're not here
[1:27:49] tonight to
[1:27:50] tell sad stories but the bible is filled
[1:27:53] with some regrettable times
[1:27:55] that have brought mankind to where he is
[1:27:57] today and where mankind is today is sad
[1:28:01] amen it's sad
[1:28:05] it's sad because not only is it worse
[1:28:08] than it's ever been but
[1:28:09] he's helpless to help himself out of it
[1:28:13] i think in my mind's eye back to the
[1:28:15] garden of eden brother branham if you
[1:28:16] ever hear him tell the story it's so
[1:28:18] heart-wrenching
[1:28:19] of course nobody can tell a story like
[1:28:21] brother branham he's such a master at it
[1:28:23] but
[1:28:25] i i remember the scene he describes with
[1:28:28] adam you know the sad scene adam leaving
[1:28:30] the garden
[1:28:31] with his arm around eve and walking from
[1:28:33] the garden walking from god's presence
[1:28:36] you know i i think about the the sad
[1:28:40] think of the think of the sadness that
[1:28:44] adam and eve must have felt when they
[1:28:47] discover
[1:28:48] abel's bloodied corpse
[1:28:52] imagine the pain that that would have
[1:28:55] caused i look at the sad
[1:28:56] scene here of david riding out of
[1:28:59] jerusalem
[1:29:00] weeping over a city goes up upon the
[1:29:02] mount of olives and weeps over
[1:29:04] the city of jerusalem 900 plus years
[1:29:07] later
[1:29:08] son of david is going to go up that same
[1:29:10] hill and weep over the same city a
[1:29:12] rejected king
[1:29:17] you know david had got to a point in his
[1:29:21] life where many things had
[1:29:23] you know this is psalms 143 this is a
[1:29:25] lot of years
[1:29:26] a lot of water's been under the bridge
[1:29:28] at this point
[1:29:29] and you know isn't it amazing that life
[1:29:31] can have a way
[1:29:33] sometimes and it doesn't it doesn't
[1:29:35] necessarily take a lot of years life can
[1:29:38] have a way of just grinding you down
[1:29:42] you know and i think that david surely
[1:29:44] must have felt
[1:29:46] as he's being deposed and weeping over
[1:29:48] the city and
[1:29:49] leaving you know on his on his animals
[1:29:52] and
[1:29:53] and the whole you know capital
[1:29:56] government is leaving with him and
[1:29:58] you know and and the the army generals
[1:30:00] they want him to fight and he's not
[1:30:01] going to fight he just says
[1:30:03] you know i'm just god gave me god put me
[1:30:06] here
[1:30:08] god can take me down if god wants to
[1:30:10] give it to absalom
[1:30:11] let him give it to him my life is in
[1:30:14] god's hands
[1:30:16] in in times where you're ground down
[1:30:20] by life uh one of the best
[1:30:24] places of refuge i've ever discovered
[1:30:27] is to just raise up my hands and say
[1:30:29] lord my life my times
[1:30:31] are in your hands
[1:30:34] and even if you slay me i'll trust you
[1:30:39] you know it takes quite a revelation to
[1:30:40] say that and mean it
[1:30:43] when you're you know when you're when
[1:30:45] you've reached the dead hours brother
[1:30:46] branham called it
[1:30:48] and and and and sometimes life can bring
[1:30:51] great challenges
[1:30:52] and when you've got to have that moment
[1:30:55] and it's got to be by faith and it's got
[1:30:57] to be something stronger than you it's
[1:30:58] got to come from something more than
[1:31:00] your head knowledge
[1:31:01] or more than being convinced of the
[1:31:03] doctrines and teachings
[1:31:04] you've got to be able to say though he's
[1:31:06] slaying me
[1:31:08] yet i'll trust him
[1:31:16] there's many sad disappointments in this
[1:31:18] mortal life
[1:31:20] and you know brother brandon talks about
[1:31:23] he you know in ways of say he'll say
[1:31:27] things like
[1:31:28] you know i i'm here and then when i'm
[1:31:32] over here i want to be over there
[1:31:33] and then when i'm over there i don't
[1:31:34] want to be back over here and
[1:31:37] and he says you know he said i'll i'll
[1:31:39] come back from overseas and he said i'll
[1:31:40] think
[1:31:41] my i don't i want to stay home for
[1:31:43] months and he said and then a jet plane
[1:31:44] will go over over the head and he said
[1:31:46] and my heart will be
[1:31:46] oh i want to be i need to go back to the
[1:31:48] foreign field
[1:31:50] he talks about times where you know just
[1:31:52] life i mean brother brandon was a
[1:31:54] just a human he talks about you know
[1:31:57] about your your
[1:31:58] finances and he says you know you get a
[1:32:00] little money
[1:32:01] and you think you're going to get ahead
[1:32:03] and finally going to get a little relief
[1:32:04] and he said and then something will come
[1:32:05] along and take it
[1:32:08] you know amen amen how many times we've
[1:32:11] had it
[1:32:13] and and you know he he says here
[1:32:16] he says here in questions and answers in
[1:32:18] 1964
[1:32:20] i read this today in um
[1:32:23] in one of my devotionals i it must have
[1:32:25] been um the uh
[1:32:26] the one that brother tim dodd did i
[1:32:28] don't i think maybe book one or
[1:32:30] book two i don't remember but he says
[1:32:32] here
[1:32:34] talking about people who try to live in
[1:32:37] the rearview mirror live in their past
[1:32:39] and he says you know christians
[1:32:42] a christian don't do that a christian
[1:32:44] don't try to be what he used to be he's
[1:32:46] not looking where he's been he's looking
[1:32:48] where he's going see
[1:32:50] don't pay no attention to what you was
[1:32:51] now watch this here's something real
[1:32:53] practical
[1:32:54] for men and women don't pay no attention
[1:32:56] to what you was
[1:32:58] then you done lived that out
[1:33:01] you'll never return to it that's in the
[1:33:03] past
[1:33:04] and any man that drives life's road
[1:33:07] life's road
[1:33:08] looking through a rearview mirror is
[1:33:10] going to go to wreck
[1:33:12] so will you on this christian road see
[1:33:15] don't look back
[1:33:15] what you was look what you're going to
[1:33:18] be paul said
[1:33:19] forgetting those things which are in the
[1:33:20] past i pressed forward
[1:33:24] toward the mark of the high calling
[1:33:27] you know i i was the other day i was
[1:33:30] looking through
[1:33:31] family pictures and my that's such a
[1:33:34] warm
[1:33:34] feeling in your heart you look over old
[1:33:36] friends and old families and
[1:33:38] you know immediate and siblings and
[1:33:41] aunts and uncles and grandparents and
[1:33:42] then
[1:33:43] and then beyond that there's friends
[1:33:44] that you've known and you're there you
[1:33:46] are and they're smiling you're smiling
[1:33:47] years ago and you know as i was
[1:33:50] as i was looking back and just
[1:33:53] just going down memories laying a little
[1:33:55] bit every once in a while
[1:33:58] you know you you run into somebody and
[1:34:00] it's really
[1:34:02] it's really their past that keeps them
[1:34:04] from going forward
[1:34:05] and i've been around people like that to
[1:34:07] where they get so hung on something that
[1:34:09] happened in their past
[1:34:11] and they they get stuck there and they
[1:34:14] can't go forward and they're just
[1:34:15] maybe it's maybe it's something they did
[1:34:17] that they're under guilt maybe it's
[1:34:19] under
[1:34:19] regret maybe they're paying a heavy
[1:34:21] price uh you know i don't know i got all
[1:34:23] kinds of things i could look back over
[1:34:24] pictures
[1:34:25] and i could go wow what a happy time
[1:34:27] look at that oh yeah and then i go
[1:34:28] wow um boy that's also when wow
[1:34:32] man what's that memory wasn't there yeah
[1:34:35] you know i'm glad to be going to a place
[1:34:37] where i'm going to be no more bad
[1:34:38] memories
[1:34:41] i'm going to a place friends where
[1:34:42] everything's flawlessly perfect
[1:34:46] and you know what this might sound weird
[1:34:49] to you
[1:34:50] but i i found myself staring at all
[1:34:52] these different images of people i've
[1:34:54] known and
[1:34:55] and i thought all that that you know i i
[1:34:57] know you know that poor person you know
[1:34:59] they they were pretty close to me and i
[1:35:01] know something that happened and
[1:35:02] i know they regret it i know they
[1:35:03] repented thank god lord i was thanking
[1:35:05] god
[1:35:06] and and i just thought to myself you
[1:35:08] know jesus
[1:35:10] and and then another time elijah you
[1:35:12] know when when
[1:35:13] when when you get sometimes when god
[1:35:15] puts a call on you
[1:35:17] and then you know they want to they want
[1:35:19] to go back and worry about the dead and
[1:35:21] and the and the adage is you know let
[1:35:24] the dead bury the dead
[1:35:26] and i and i just i just thought about
[1:35:28] that in my mind and i just thought
[1:35:30] i you know i want to say to anybody
[1:35:32] who's held up maybe
[1:35:34] maybe some failure maybe some
[1:35:36] cataclysmic failure maybe
[1:35:38] maybe there's been a hard price that
[1:35:40] maybe you're even paying it right now
[1:35:42] i'm here to tell you that god still
[1:35:43] loves you and just let the dead bury the
[1:35:46] dead and quit going back there
[1:35:47] and just be done with it why don't you
[1:35:50] just tonight accept the freedom
[1:35:53] that he loves you and that he forgives
[1:35:55] you and that he doesn't want you to
[1:35:56] linger back there
[1:35:57] he wants you to go forward forward
[1:36:01] upward onward christian soldiers
[1:36:04] i think there's nothing more more
[1:36:07] limiting
[1:36:08] to to for god to be able to use our
[1:36:10] lives
[1:36:11] i tell you something friends i got
[1:36:13] plenty of mistakes without lingering on
[1:36:15] them all day long
[1:36:16] all i can do is give it to god cast it
[1:36:18] in the sea of his forgiveness and say
[1:36:21] father i love you i believe you i'm
[1:36:23] sorry what i did then but here is me
[1:36:25] now and i'm going to go forward in faith
[1:36:27] and i'm going to serve you
[1:36:29] the rest of my days i think that that's
[1:36:32] part of the longing i think that i want
[1:36:34] to say lord
[1:36:35] i don't want to sit back and linger over
[1:36:37] failure and thought and fear
[1:36:39] i want to have faith i want to have
[1:36:41] courage i want to i have a longing i
[1:36:43] have a hunger
[1:36:44] i have a thirst for more of you
[1:36:52] so just let the dead bury the dead let
[1:36:56] if if that's under the blood then to god
[1:36:59] it's dead
[1:37:02] if you've got a responsibility you're
[1:37:04] having to keep up with because of a
[1:37:05] mistake
[1:37:06] then god bless you keep up with it but
[1:37:08] don't linger back there in the failure
[1:37:10] of those kinds of things
[1:37:12] press forward children press forward let
[1:37:14] the bleach wash it all away all of it
[1:37:17] do you realize it wouldn't even been
[1:37:18] possible until the day and hour that
[1:37:20] you're living in
[1:37:20] because we have a justification that so
[1:37:23] far supersedes luther's
[1:37:24] understanding we have a bleach we have
[1:37:27] an abstract
[1:37:28] that traces your life all the way back
[1:37:30] before you were born
[1:37:31] and find you back in the mind of god and
[1:37:34] when you come forward you're one thing
[1:37:36] sons and daughters
[1:37:38] amen and all the hurts and all the
[1:37:41] disappointments and all the pains of
[1:37:43] life

[1:37:51] it to god

[1:37:56] stay back there
[1:37:57] and linger in the pain of it and and
[1:37:59] that's only going to keep me defeated
[1:38:02] why not hope thou and god
[1:38:06] hope thou and god david david commanded
[1:38:08] his own heart to do that
[1:38:10] hope in god see i you know there's
[1:38:13] we got enough sad stories here that
[1:38:15] every one of us could stand up here and
[1:38:17] tell the tragedies of our lives
[1:38:20] but you know we're going to a place
[1:38:22] where someday
[1:38:23] the lord brother branham said we'll sit
[1:38:25] at that table thousands of miles long
[1:38:27] that's not a fairy tale friends
[1:38:29] that's for real and he said we'll reach
[1:38:32] across to one another and we'll weep
[1:38:34] and cry and and he said the king
[1:38:37] the king the king will come out and wipe
[1:38:40] away all your tears and say don't wait
[1:38:41] no more it's all over
[1:38:43] all those words it's all over hallelujah

[1:39:10] remember
[1:39:11] you know there at the bedside what a sad
[1:39:13] scene that was there

[1:39:18] to
[1:39:19] trying to you know get in just to get we

[1:39:27] lord was going to bring him on
[1:39:28] to his reward i'm glad i can stand here
[1:39:30] to go tonight and say hey y'all remember
[1:39:32] brother eddie he's still alive
[1:39:36] very much so amen
[1:39:40] and you know it was but it but but those
[1:39:42] things are sad but paul said it's not

[1:39:44] paul said you know it's not that we
[1:39:45] don't sorrow we don't sorrow as others
[1:39:48] who have no hope sure it was hard to let
[1:39:52] him go
[1:39:52] stand holding his hand wanting him
[1:39:55] healed so bad
[1:39:56] you know to see him slip away and you
[1:39:58] know you can hear the sound and
[1:40:01] suddenly his heart stopped and and we're
[1:40:03] realizing he's gone
[1:40:04] and you know but he he wasn't gone gone
[1:40:08] he'd all he did was step up out of that
[1:40:10] broken down old
[1:40:12] skeleton frame that had wasted away
[1:40:14] didn't even probably look like brother
[1:40:15] eddie anymore
[1:40:17] and i i remember looking and i was
[1:40:19] watching
[1:40:20] sister jean and you know she just she
[1:40:23] just
[1:40:23] laid in close and just rubbed his head
[1:40:25] and i could see i couldn't hear what she
[1:40:26] was saying just
[1:40:27] saying her last words to her to the love
[1:40:30] of her life

[1:40:33] love you and i i could make out a little
[1:40:34] bit and we love you and we'll see you

[1:41:06] looking over jonathan we're crying or
[1:41:07] looking every time what is he doing
[1:41:09] and i thought well maybe he's just
[1:41:11] grieving in his own way
[1:41:13] until i got him turned around and he's
[1:41:14] smiling
[1:41:16] and he found a he found a piece and

[1:41:44] room anymore i'm here to tell you

[1:42:28] i'm here to tell you some friends when
[1:42:29] when the trumpet sounds
[1:42:31] the devil can look for me but i'll be
[1:42:33] out
[1:42:34] he can come and accuse me of whatever he
[1:42:35] wants i'll be gone
[1:42:37] it ain't gonna matter let the world do
[1:42:39] what it wants to do
[1:42:40] let satan have at it when the trumpets
[1:42:43] of god sounds and the dead in christ
[1:42:45] rise
[1:42:45] i will be out of here i'll be gone
[1:42:49] it ain't going to matter to me my heart
[1:42:51] is here today to say lord
[1:42:53] i want to know you more while i'm here i
[1:42:56] want my heart to
[1:42:57] know you in a supernatural way it's not
[1:43:00] about sin
[1:43:00] it's not about guilt that's already
[1:43:02] under the blood it's not about that
[1:43:04] that's not what it was with david
[1:43:07] david had come to know this god
[1:43:10] david had come it was such a personal
[1:43:12] thing to him
[1:43:14] oh he says you know i i i want to know
[1:43:18] you in this way
[1:43:20] in this way i don't want to go to your
[1:43:23] judgment
[1:43:25] i but my my heart is longing
[1:43:28] my whole inside is wanting more of you
[1:43:30] david was going to come back
[1:43:33] god was actually going to do away with
[1:43:35] absalom
[1:43:36] which didn't which broke david's heart
[1:43:38] even more
[1:43:39] and but david was going to be restored
[1:43:41] to his throne
[1:43:43] there's no weapon formed against you
[1:43:45] that can prosper let satan rage
[1:43:47] let the heathen rage the heathen's
[1:43:49] always going to rage
[1:43:51] you know i why while i'm here i'm going
[1:43:53] to have to stop but but
[1:43:54] while i'm here i want to make my life
[1:43:58] count i want to it's not that i can earn
[1:44:02] my keep i could never earn my keep what
[1:44:04] christ has done for me can never
[1:44:07] ever be repaid
[1:44:11] i can't even pay the down payment i
[1:44:13] can't even pay the
[1:44:14] interest on the loan
[1:44:17] no sense even trying to make the first
[1:44:19] payment i could never keep up for all
[1:44:23] that he's done for me but i find myself
[1:44:27] i find myself like david to say lord
[1:44:30] what does life
[1:44:31] really matter anyway as long as i have
[1:44:33] you
[1:44:35] and david is literally being chased out
[1:44:37] of his capital off of his throne
[1:44:39] he doesn't even care that doesn't mean
[1:44:42] anything to him you know the only thing
[1:44:44] that matters to david
[1:44:45] is this longing my heart is longing
[1:44:49] i'm thirsting after you can you imagine
[1:44:51] that kind of a testimony
[1:44:53] in the middle of being deposed and ran
[1:44:55] out
[1:44:57] can can you imagine the catastrophic
[1:45:00] event
[1:45:00] that he's literally being chased out of
[1:45:03] jerusalem by his own son
[1:45:04] coming to kill him and he's not going
[1:45:06] out boohooing
[1:45:08] he's not going out guilty he's going out
[1:45:11] longing
[1:45:12] thirsting right in the middle of his
[1:45:14] trial the only thing he can think
[1:45:16] of is getting closer to god getting
[1:45:18] closer to god
[1:45:19] i'll tell you something friends if you
[1:45:21] want my advice on how to deal with this
[1:45:23] mad
[1:45:24] thing that we call life get closer to
[1:45:26] god
[1:45:28] we don't know we do not know what
[1:45:31] how all this is going to shake out the
[1:45:33] world right now is in such an unsettling
[1:45:35] time
[1:45:36] and you know i my advice to you
[1:45:40] if you've if you've been at at a
[1:45:42] distance with the lord
[1:45:44] be at distance no more amen
[1:45:47] move closer come to god you know it's
[1:45:50] not about
[1:45:51] if you've never known him in the
[1:45:52] cleansing of your sins then come to him
[1:45:54] that way don't try to
[1:45:55] bypass that don't try to take a shortcut
[1:45:58] don't end around
[1:46:00] don't run an end around play on calvary
[1:46:03] but if you've been to calvary and you
[1:46:05] know him in the power of his
[1:46:06] resurrection
[1:46:07] then every day of your life there should
[1:46:09] be a longing and a hungering as a deep
[1:46:12] calleth unto the deep if there's a deep
[1:46:15] calling that tells me there's a deep to

[1:51:11] here
[1:51:16] i have a request of course we want to
[1:51:19] continue
[1:51:20] to pray for brother harrison and our
[1:51:23] brother just
[1:51:24] hanging on as far as i still know and
[1:51:27] believing that the lord
[1:51:29] has the whole matter in his hands you
[1:51:31] know there we were
[1:51:33] i was talking with sarah sunday and
[1:51:36] the family the whole family facing some
[1:51:38] really tough
[1:51:41] family decisions regarding that i don't
[1:51:43] want to elaborate too much
[1:51:45] but how many will just pray for wisdom
[1:51:48] that's a tough spot to be in we were
[1:51:50] right there and
[1:51:51] having to answer some of those same
[1:51:53] questions when brother eddie
[1:51:55] was slipping away from us and we don't
[1:51:57] know brother harrison could be right
[1:51:58] back here by the weekend
[1:52:00] amen you know we're we're not supposed
[1:52:02] to limit the god of israel
[1:52:04] amen so i'm not ready to put him in a
[1:52:06] grave you know i'm going to pray
[1:52:08] for his healing until he's crossed till
[1:52:10] he's crossed over
[1:52:11] because when he crosses over he'll be
[1:52:13] healed anyway
[1:52:15] and so there's no losing you can't lose
[1:52:18] when you're the family of god
[1:52:20] but i don't want the brother to suffer
[1:52:21] enough the lord to be mindful to heal
[1:52:23] him then
[1:52:24] my goodness how we rejoice over that but
[1:52:27] either way
[1:52:28] brother harrison his future is bright
[1:52:31] amen so let's just ask the lord
[1:52:34] for his mercy in that situation sister
[1:52:36] princess
[1:52:37] her mom uh is in the hospital cove at
[1:52:40] 19.
[1:52:41] and it's been a little dicey she went in
[1:52:43] and then got a little worse
[1:52:45] and then it leveled and then it got
[1:52:46] worse and so
[1:52:48] um sister princess said what we really
[1:52:50] need looks like at this point is a
[1:52:52] miracle
[1:52:53] and so we she didn't her mother didn't
[1:52:55] exactly want it out right out right away
[1:52:58] but at this point now it's kind of it
[1:53:00] just kind of got out anyway
[1:53:02] so how many will stand tonight with our
[1:53:04] own sister princess
[1:53:05] for her mother see that's her mom who
[1:53:08] she loves
[1:53:08] and just battling sister ruth pruitt
[1:53:12] has also been battling uh covid and
[1:53:15] that's kind of been going up and down
[1:53:17] we've been praying for that for days
[1:53:19] and the last report i got was that she
[1:53:21] had a good night last night and this
[1:53:22] morning
[1:53:23] the doctors are hopeful that um i don't
[1:53:26] the word
[1:53:27] they didn't use the word turn to corner
[1:53:29] but by the description
[1:53:31] that's how kind of i would take it that
[1:53:33] maybe she's
[1:53:34] you know over the hardest part let's
[1:53:36] believe that will you
[1:53:37] sister ruth such a wonderful sister
[1:53:39] brother timothy pruitt it's his wife and
[1:53:41] you know family of children there and
[1:53:43] then brother tim pruitt has
[1:53:45] a number of people um that went down
[1:53:48] with covid most of them recovered i
[1:53:50] think they had about 70
[1:53:51] cases most of which have all recovered
[1:53:54] thank god
[1:53:55] i think they had maybe three or four
[1:53:57] cases lingering that were pretty serious
[1:54:00] and uh been a number of people that
[1:54:02] passed away brother barry coffey
[1:54:04] lost an elderly sister in his church i
[1:54:06] don't think that was coveted though best
[1:54:08] i can remember brother ron spencer lost
[1:54:11] a deacon
[1:54:12] been a deacon since 1974 lost him i
[1:54:14] think that was
[1:54:15] coveted and then um i think brother tim
[1:54:19] or somebody else did have someone who
[1:54:22] passed away
[1:54:23] amen i'm ready to see god deliver us
[1:54:26] from this
