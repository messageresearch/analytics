[0:00] [Music]
[0:11] morning
[0:12] everyone God bless you let's go ahead
[0:15] and
[0:20] stand let's pray Heavenly Father we just
[0:23] come before you Lord and we're so
[0:24] thankful for your mercy and Grace we ask
[0:27] Lord that your presence would be with us
[0:29] Lord that you would
[0:31] come Lord and take your word and make it
[0:36] uh a living reality in our hearts we
[0:38] know Lord your word is the truth Lord
[0:41] and we are
[0:44] Sanctified through that word of Truth
[0:46] Lord that we're Washed by the washing of
[0:49] the water of the word Lord and we're
[0:51] Gathering to that end Lord pray pray
[0:53] that you'd wash us Lord and cleanse us
[0:56] that we would be presented before you
[0:58] without spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:01] thing Lord but be holy and unreprovable
[1:06] in your sight Lord and we we also
[1:08] understand this is not by our works Lord
[1:10] but this is by the effectual working of
[1:13] your blood in the form of in the form of
[1:16] your word Lord working in our lives and
[1:21] so we surrender ourselves to that in
[1:23] Jesus name amen I bless you we're going
[1:26] to continue from seems like a very long
[1:29] long time ago on a word family this will
[1:33] be part nine and we'll read from uh
[1:37] Genesis chapter
[1:41] 3 and
[1:43] verse
[1:54] 16 unto the woman he said I will greatly
[1:57] multiply thy sorrow and thy conception
[2:00] in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth
[2:02] children and thy desire shall be to thy
[2:05] husband and he shall rule over thee may
[2:08] the Lord add the blessing to the reading
[2:10] of his word you can be seated brother
[2:12] Mark if you want to bring up the
[2:15] PowerPoint just go to the first
[2:20] screen feels like in my mind I need to
[2:23] go back and start over because it's been
[2:25] so
[2:26] long since I've been here um for Sunday
[2:30] school
[2:32] so uh just just a few comments I'll be
[2:35] leaving uh Thursday for Uganda it's kind
[2:39] of a last minute trip a little bit of a
[2:42] long and funny story there but I'll be
[2:45] ministering for brother Abraham for his
[2:47] annual meeting so remember me in prayer
[2:49] brother uh Burley Williams will also be
[2:52] going there so it be a quick trip I
[2:54] think will be
[2:57] like I don't know over maybe 72 hours in
[3:01] transit and uh be there for five days or
[3:05] something like that so pray for
[3:08] me and I've been ever since the trip to
[3:11] Cambodia I've been having some issues
[3:14] with my back so really not looking
[3:16] forward to sitting down for eight hours
[3:19] two different times so need I need a
[3:23] touch from the Lord for sure and uh also
[3:26] remember Addie in prayer she's been she
[3:28] had a pretty rough night with
[3:30] coughing so all right Genesis
[3:35] 3:16 uh as we're reading I'll just make
[3:38] a few comments there before we go in
[3:41] Reading from the it's not up here we
[3:44] have
[3:46] nothing
[3:47] sweet so in the NLT
[3:51] um it it says then he said to the woman
[3:54] I will sharpen the pain of your
[3:56] pregnancy and in pain you will give
[3:58] birth and you will desire to control
[4:02] your husband but he will rule over you
[4:05] so looking at overall the curse that was
[4:11] put upon man and upon woman it's it's
[4:16] distinct man was Cur everything was
[4:18] cursed because of man and it seems here
[4:21] within this there is a uh a curse upon
[4:26] the marriage
[4:27] relationship and that's that's why we so
[4:29] desperately need Christ in the midst of
[4:32] marriage you know the the the na the way
[4:35] of our nature is for a woman to rebel
[4:38] against headship and the way for a man
[4:41] his nature is to overpower the woman so
[4:46] that he does rule over her and so in
[4:49] this is a perversion of God's original
[4:53] intention man was not designed to rule
[4:57] by force amen over his wife wife neither
[5:01] is a woman designed to rebel against
[5:05] headship they're basically the opposite
[5:07] of what the the curse is the opposite of
[5:10] what God has designed she wants to rule
[5:12] over him he wants to be the dictator and
[5:16] if she's going to rebel I will by force
[5:20] make her respect and honor me neither is
[5:23] God's way God's God's way is to lead by
[5:27] love
[5:31] and by
[5:32] wisdom
[5:34] and for the woman God designed her the
[5:37] Bible says that she was designed to have
[5:39] a Meek and quiet
[5:42] spirit and meek doesn't mean weak Meek
[5:46] means e to to be able to be led Moses
[5:50] was the meekest man on the earth he
[5:52] wasn't weak he was strong very
[5:56] strong uh his meekness was he was able
[6:00] to be to hear the voice and Leadership
[6:02] of God and follow it and so that's
[6:06] that's in the design of woman that's in
[6:08] the design of man the position that we
[6:12] find oursel in under the New Covenant
[6:15] with the headship of man and the
[6:17] submission of woman is not a perversion
[6:19] of the original creation it is what the
[6:22] original creation was designed to be
[6:25] under right but we were not it wasn't
[6:27] designed to be like this in gen Genesis
[6:30] 3:16 uh on the one hand a rebellion
[6:33] against headship and on the other hand a
[6:35] perverted patriarchy that Rules by force
[6:39] so I think as time went on and through
[6:43] history especially in the history of the
[6:46] Christian church we find that there was
[6:49] there has been a breakdown of the family
[6:52] unit within the last we'll say
[6:57] 120 plus years
[7:00] um even longer than that because some of
[7:02] the seeds of this feminism were really
[7:07] planted around the time of the Civil
[7:11] War the feminist movement
[7:14] began out of and along with the
[7:18] anti-slavery movement so on the on the
[7:21] you know the tree of the knowledge of
[7:22] Good and Evil you know abolishing
[7:26] slavery is a very good thing
[7:29] but what went along with it was not a
[7:31] very good thing and so some of the
[7:34] leading voices of the anti-slavery
[7:38] movement were also feminists Elizabeth
[7:41] Katie Stanton Susan B Anthony this is a
[7:44] quote from Elizabeth Katie Stanton when
[7:46] women understand that governments and
[7:48] religions are human inventions that
[7:50] Bibles prayer books catechisms and
[7:53] encyclical letters are all emanations
[7:56] from the brains of
[7:58] man she wrote Elizabeth Katie Stanton
[8:01] wrote a fiction work which is a woman's
[8:05] Bible a woman's translation of the Bible
[8:07] getting rid of any references to
[8:11] patriarchy so we understand that the
[8:15] foundation of feminism is rebellion
[8:18] against the word of
[8:20] God and this began they began with
[8:23] working towards anti-slavery all all
[8:27] good but then they moved on to other
[8:30] things and and especially for women
[8:33] getting the right to vote which we've
[8:34] covered that and went over that instead
[8:37] of voting being a family affair now it's
[8:40] an individual Affair and I think that's
[8:42] at the very uh core of feminism is this
[8:48] americanism Americanized
[8:51] individualism that's took place in much
[8:54] ways we can't really understand what the
[8:57] world was like back then because we are
[9:00] so colored by individualism even our
[9:04] version of
[9:05] Christianity we we need we need to get
[9:07] the Holy Ghost and get our minds still
[9:09] as message Believers changed and
[9:11] transformed because we many times don't
[9:14] understand the value and the importance
[9:16] of the family unit of the headship of a
[9:20] father even the father looks Through The
[9:22] Eyes of headship as an
[9:25] individual that's not the right way to
[9:27] look at it amen we need to be cleansed
[9:30] of
[9:31] that because what what it is it's a
[9:36] perversion the
[9:38] very salvation certainly is an
[9:41] individual
[9:43] Affair absolutely right but you can
[9:46] never separate that from the outworking
[9:48] of Salvation which is within a family
[9:51] unit when you're a child there's order
[9:54] there's submission and your obedience to
[9:57] God is directly connected to your
[9:59] obedience to the government that God has
[10:02] put in place right in front of you the
[10:05] family as as a as a
[10:08] wife as a as a mother there is a
[10:11] specific order and role that you're
[10:14] called to play you can't say I my
[10:16] salvation is an individual Fair it
[10:18] doesn't matter my responsibility towards
[10:21] my family you're missing then the
[10:22] outworking of your
[10:25] salvation both as a
[10:27] wife salvation is work worked out
[10:30] differently than would be in the husband
[10:32] as a husband you're what you're going to
[10:34] answer for is different than what a
[10:36] woman is going to answer for but in
[10:37] America and American values my goodness
[10:40] what are you talking about we're all
[10:42] individuals no we're all individuals in
[10:45] a family unit and even greater than it
[10:48] within a community of
[10:51] Believers and so this extreme yes
[10:55] salvation is an individual Affair but
[10:57] this extreme individualism
[10:59] is actually
[11:02] Antichrist
[11:04] voting once was looked at simply as a
[11:08] family affair it was connected to the
[11:10] whole family a man a person isn't voting
[11:14] as an individual the man the head of the
[11:17] household is voting because he he know
[11:20] he understands his responsibility as a
[11:23] head of
[11:24] household now because of women getting
[11:28] the right of vote that has been
[11:29] obliterated from our thinking and many
[11:31] of you are thinking here what are all
[11:33] the ramifications of this thought I have
[11:35] I am still thinking about that there
[11:38] there is so much to that to understand
[11:41] as a man your responsibility towards
[11:43] your family it goes far
[11:46] beyond just the basic things that we
[11:49] think about money and providing and all
[11:53] these different things this is this
[11:56] perverted way of even looking at life is
[11:59] from the rise of progressivism and
[12:02] liberalism and individualism same thing
[12:05] it's directly attached to progressivism
[12:08] and liberalism and it's directly the
[12:12] foundation of progressivism and
[12:15] liberalism is what women getting the
[12:18] right to
[12:19] vote and that's the backbone of the
[12:22] Progressive Movement is women and men
[12:26] who submit to women
[12:30] amen now there's a joke there about
[12:32] liberals but we'll just leave that
[12:36] alone once woman had the vote she had
[12:40] the autonomy the individualism the
[12:42] individuality to throw away male
[12:45] headship to throw away the protection of
[12:48] male
[12:49] headship as the deciding factor in her
[12:52] life and when you throw that away what
[12:55] do you get you get a a society that's
[12:57] unsafe for everyone
[13:02] there's much that could be said about
[13:04] that and people de crying the world that
[13:08] we live in and the evils and women
[13:10] aren't safe on the streets I'll agree
[13:13] with you that's how they used to look at
[13:15] it
[13:16] too and there was a whole society built
[13:20] around being sure that women were
[13:23] protected that brewman we safe we could
[13:25] no more go backwards on that than you
[13:29] you'd have to start
[13:30] over from eight
[13:33] people it's it's that bad and that
[13:36] perverted if you if you wanted you know
[13:38] just just imagine trying to uh guard
[13:42] your family as a as a man like a
[13:45] Victorian husband would in the Victoria
[13:47] ER Victorian era people would think you
[13:51] are literally out of your mind in this
[13:53] church they would think you're out of
[13:54] your
[13:57] mind and they're not out of their mind
[13:59] they were doing things in much many ways
[14:03] in the right way to protect the sanctity
[14:05] of
[14:08] Womanhood it was once that in every
[14:11] Christian country the
[14:14] only way that divorce would be allowed
[14:17] was if there was adultery abuse or
[14:20] willful abandonment and it had to be
[14:23] proven and it had to be directed this
[14:25] person's at
[14:27] fault and if if the judge said you just
[14:30] want to get divorced because you don't
[14:32] like each other sorry you
[14:35] can't go home and work it out talk to
[14:39] your
[14:41] preacher in in the 1970s that was our
[14:45] beloved Ronald Reagan in uh California
[14:49] that pushed for no fault divorce he was
[14:52] the first governor to sign it into law
[14:55] and it's slowly become the law of the
[14:58] land so now
[14:59] divorce is easy
[15:02] simple but but the results aren't easy
[15:06] and
[15:08] simple and that was the time when
[15:11] divorce rates of course skyrocketed
[15:14] skyrocketed next thing to come on right
[15:16] after no fault divorce was the birth
[15:18] control
[15:20] pill and again this not to get into the
[15:23] weeds at all but this destroys the
[15:25] proper function of the female body I'm
[15:28] talking about pill
[15:29] based and it leads to sex without
[15:34] consequences and
[15:36] it's it's very
[15:38] unhealthy just in the natural and leads
[15:41] to many other mental physical
[15:45] disorders just so a person can defile
[15:48] their body with any man that comes their
[15:50] way it's literally disgusting well and
[15:53] if if that doesn't work then in the 70s
[15:57] we legalize
[15:59] abortion if if the pill doesn't work you
[16:02] can't have any consequences there well
[16:04] at least you can murder your
[16:08] child these are the perversions this is
[16:11] women's rights this is literally what a
[16:13] presidential campaign ties itself to in
[16:16] order to try to get elected is they want
[16:19] women's votes so bad that they will tie
[16:22] themselves completely to murder openly
[16:26] and it's put on the airwaves in America
[16:29] and anyone that speaks against it you
[16:32] they say my goodness you don't like you
[16:34] don't want women's rights well I don't
[16:36] want women's rights if that's what
[16:37] women's rights
[16:39] are but it isn't women's that's not
[16:42] women's
[16:43] rights that's total perversion total
[16:47] evil it's sacrificing your children to
[16:49] Molech all over
[16:54] again all of this was designed and done
[16:58] and purposely set forth and they didn't
[17:00] even try to hide it in order to destroy
[17:03] the family unit that was the purpose in
[17:07] order for feminism to succeed they said
[17:11] they had to destroy the family
[17:14] unit they had to destroy any need for a
[17:18] husband and it seems that in a
[17:21] society-wide basis it's
[17:24] worked it's worked but it doesn't work
[17:26] for the hearts of humans made in in the
[17:29] image of God and it hasn't produced
[17:32] happiness and it hasn't produced an
[17:34] increase of prosperity and
[17:37] joy it's produced
[17:42] bondage totally his bypassed the
[17:45] sanctity and the sacredness and the
[17:48] function of marriage not only that but
[17:51] the devil's also successfully planted in
[17:54] people's minds that having children is
[17:55] an inconvenience having children is a
[17:58] diff difficult thing having children
[18:00] puts your life on hold that's not what
[18:03] the word of God
[18:05] says that's not what the Bible says and
[18:07] even this attitude sometimes penetrates
[18:10] Us in the message that we think like
[18:12] this this is the wrong way of thinking
[18:15] children are a blessing from God the
[18:19] more you have when you're young the
[18:21] better that's what the Bible says that's
[18:22] a that's Jason dear's paraphrase of it
[18:25] but we'll read it we'll get to it not
[18:27] probably not this time but Lord willing
[18:29] next
[18:32] time instead of saying
[18:36] well if it's God's will we'll have as
[18:39] many as children as we can we'll ask him
[18:41] to guide us in
[18:43] this and the purpose now is how do we
[18:46] keep this as low as
[18:53] possible it's heartbreaking what this is
[18:56] done to
[18:59] our country to Western
[19:02] civilization it's it's the
[19:05] apostasy of the church is the
[19:08] ultimate source of the
[19:11] problem that's what's happened is
[19:14] preachers instead of watching over the
[19:17] flock and preaching the undiluted word
[19:20] of God they've stood and they've
[19:22] modernized and they've modernized and
[19:24] they've compromised and they compromised
[19:27] until the church is barely
[19:29] barely distinguishable from the world
[19:33] it's just one step behind what the world
[19:35] has done and these Spirits are seeking
[19:39] also to penetrate the minds of Believers
[19:43] of this end time
[19:46] message forget about modernism forget
[19:49] about modern day preachers of this this
[19:53] hour this day modern day theologians go
[19:57] back to the word go back to what brother
[19:59] brandham said I I guess I'm laying a
[20:02] foundation for going into
[20:04] that there's many things that brother
[20:06] brandham said and as I began to search
[20:07] and look I was really surprised at how
[20:09] much we miss
[20:14] sometimes you know of course you could
[20:16] say well women have always um sought
[20:21] versions of birth control women have
[20:23] always uh sought to find a way for
[20:27] abortion that's true
[20:29] that's true wicked women have done that
[20:31] and even at the even at at their own
[20:35] Destruction for their own
[20:38] destruction but remember when we
[20:40] legalize these things legalize birth
[20:42] control legalize abortion the
[20:46] consequence consequences of normalizing
[20:49] that puts forth such elude sexual
[20:52] behavior and ethic in the society that
[20:57] now it's so normal it's so so average
[21:01] and to the point where even you know
[21:04] pornography being legalized is that if
[21:06] you go online you almost have
[21:08] to uh have superhuman strength to be
[21:12] able to avoid it because it's the
[21:14] advertising for it is pushing it
[21:18] everywhere and it's a total perversion
[21:20] it never should be legal none of not not
[21:22] one bit of it it's not has nothing to do
[21:24] with free speech it has everything to do
[21:27] with a demon deception to
[21:30] destroy society and to to pervert
[21:35] manhood all of these things have done it
[21:38] um we've talked about talked about a
[21:41] long time ago that even the birth
[21:44] control being used this goes into the
[21:48] water supply and it's almost impossible
[21:52] it's like a practically a what they call
[21:54] a forever chemical it just stays there
[21:56] and it keeps going the process so we
[21:59] when men drink water what does it
[22:02] do it's feminizing men because it's a
[22:06] it's an
[22:07] estrogen and it's overloading our
[22:10] systems and they talk about how uh even
[22:13] sperm counts have gone down so
[22:17] significantly uh all of these things
[22:20] this is the this is
[22:21] absolutely the devil's work the devil's
[22:24] program to destroy a people and really
[22:28] we understand understand it's targeted
[22:29] at the Bride of Jesus Christ ultimately
[22:33] Satan's purpose is to block Christ from
[22:35] having a bride that's what he's trying
[22:37] he'll never do
[22:38] it but we don't it doesn't mean we don't
[22:41] have to have our eyes open to the
[22:42] reality of what's going on around
[22:46] us
[22:48] again all of these things I've been
[22:50] speaking about what is the end result
[22:53] the family unit is degraded and
[22:56] destroyed and we remember the very
[22:59] place what was the original purpose for
[23:02] man what was he
[23:04] told
[23:07] multiply and replenish the Earth and
[23:11] take dominion over it amen and the
[23:14] gospel us being told to go into all the
[23:16] world and preach the gospel it's
[23:18] directly connected to that and what is
[23:21] the primary means that God use uses he
[23:25] uses the church what is a church made up
[23:28] made up of
[23:30] families right that's the that's the
[23:33] norm is a family and the family is the
[23:36] place where the word of God first must
[23:39] be propagated fathers husbands your
[23:44] primary Duty and primary role is not
[23:48] money your primary role is as the head
[23:52] of your wife your secondary role is to
[23:56] raise up your children to fear and walk
[23:59] with God and to learn how to do the same
[24:02] thing that you're and your wife are
[24:04] doing which is raising their children to
[24:07] serve God the greatest place that the
[24:09] gospel is propagated is in a Godly
[24:12] family the second greatest is going into
[24:15] the all the world and preaching the
[24:17] gospel but that's what's that to do
[24:19] bring families
[24:21] in and continue that process and the
[24:24] enemy it has done everything he can to
[24:28] block that and pervert that and even
[24:30] take the I the proper understanding and
[24:33] idea of family out of our
[24:37] minds we have to realize again
[24:41] feminism didn't bring a little bit of
[24:43] good to
[24:45] society it's improved some things
[24:49] feminism is an open attack against the
[24:52] Christian faith it always has been it
[24:55] always will be it always leads to
[24:57] Liberal ation degradation and perversion
[25:01] it should be treated as an
[25:03] enemy against the gospel against God
[25:07] himself and
[25:10] against good Society let's put it that
[25:13] way every True Believer should stand
[25:15] against it should not be ashamed of it
[25:18] we we have allowed the perverts to take
[25:22] the middle ground and say this is normal
[25:24] no living like message Believers lives
[25:28] that's normal take the middle ground and
[25:30] say that's normal act like it's normal
[25:33] feel like it's normal don't feel like
[25:34] you're weird they're
[25:37] weird they're perverted every Christian
[25:41] did like we
[25:42] do in society through all through all of
[25:46] church history until the 20th
[25:50] century treat it like an enemy treat it
[25:53] like it's a perversion act like it's a
[25:55] perversion talk like it's a perversion
[25:58] don't let it be normalized the
[26:00] perversion be normalized in your mind
[26:02] that's Satan's biggest Ploy is to
[26:05] normalize perversion in your mind so
[26:08] that you feel like perversion is in the
[26:10] middle ground and so now you're
[26:12] adjusting yourself towards perversion I
[26:14] was over here as a Believer but all
[26:16] these perverts are normal now so I
[26:18] should just be a little bit no they're
[26:21] not
[26:22] normal stand your ground don't be afraid
[26:25] I I as we get older we're oh more okay
[26:28] with that but as young people I'm
[26:31] speaking to you is don't think that way
[26:33] don't you allow yourself to think that
[26:36] the perverts are normal and you are
[26:39] weird you're following the Bible in fact
[26:42] you probably should be more extreme than
[26:44] you
[26:48] are all
[26:50] right I'm going to close there that way
[26:53] we won't get behind on the schedule for
[26:55] today so let's stand
