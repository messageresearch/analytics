so uh I'm starting in a fresh material today I told my wife I said well I hope I can remember how to do this seems like um it's been a little while since I stood here Amen brother Caleb I was thinking about what you said in in my office the other night and I thought that was a strange thing for a preacher to say well I hope I can remember how to do this and and I said that exact thing to my wife man I hope I remember how to do this amen everybody keeps telling me it's like riding a bike I crashed a lot of bikes I rode my Chariot furiously and um so uh anyway praise the Lord Genesis 15 want to take a thought today my part or I think I sent to the booth our part in The Inheritance our part in The Inheritance how many believe you have a part how many believe you have an inheritance there is an inheritance and you have a part in it now it won't do you any good to have a part won't do you any good for there to be an inheritance and you have a legal right to it if you don't go claim it amen Genesis 15 verse 1 after these things the word of the Lord came to Abram notice it's Abram not Abraham yet came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and Abram said Lord God what wil thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this eleazer of Damascus and Abram said behold to me thou has given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine Heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bows shall be thine Heir and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness and he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of her of the chais to give thee this land to inherit it let's pray Master we thank you for your word now and Lord as I just relax myself to deliver the burden of the word for the people it's been wonderful studying it Lord I've so enjoyed it and so I'm praying that you give me now that unction of the holy spirit that it may be delivered to the people as it was delivered to me and so we commit this to you in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated amen so I'm just um thankful to the Lord for touching me in body and uh amen amen just um struck me you know but I it it was okay because I was I was I I caught it playing nurse maid to the love of my life and she was sick and in taking care of her uh it got over on me and I was happy to see her get free of it amen have her here with me today and I know that's been going around in other different ones of you uh have had some feeling of that we've got a number number of requests that have went out for healing like that I was glad to I'm sure y'all saw the the testimony we sent uh of sister Elaine yesterday so amen praise the Lord T is she she's home everything's still good yeah praise the Lord so um Amen brother Donald was just sending me the updates and I was sending them out to you and he was thanking the lord and Thanking us for prayer and I was thanking the lord and thanking you all for praying there's power in prayer isn't there amen it's times like that when we realize as we're we're really all in this together brother Donald was saying to me how much you know he he he loved her and he was so grateful to the Lord and I said brother Donald we love her too and we are so grateful to the Lord that he's touching our sister so we want to ask the Lord to just continue amen they've uh they've got her on a little bit of medication and she was a little bit hesitant on some of the tests they wanted to run and uh I knew there was nothing to it it was tests I had run and they were just is fine and uh but uh she had a little bit of trepidation so I was just praying for her secretly I didn't put it in the text but I just said we're just going to pray brother Donald that um you know the Holy Spirit lead you and guide you um you know as far as treatment and all but in secret I was saying Lord give her courage give her courage amen so I was glad when he sent out the update to say that she had um consented to the nuclear portion of that test some people uh feel a little strange about that but it's a it's a great way uh to know what you're looking at amen but I'm glad the Lord is touching her today amen I'm glad the Lord is healing everybody I'm glad the Lord brought everybody back home brother George sister Andrea brother Mark sister Deborah different ones who have been away amen we greet you mark what you doing in town man you just you just hanging out you come to see me or what okay praise the Lord happy to have him uh here with us today and if I'm missing visitors that won't be strange I do it all the time amen but God bless bless you today Genesis 15 now I just want to make some opening comments as I was starting already to think about the inheritance that we have and what it means to have an inheritance but what it means that you go and Avail yourself and that you have to Avail yourself I promise you if you have an inheritance the attorneys will not come to your house and knock on your door they will say we will be at our office there will be a reading of the will and if you want to know what you get come to the reading and uh and and when you go there you not only uh find out what you have been uh what you have inherited but how to acquire it and then you have to go through sometimes you have to go through legal steps and there's sometimes that that jealous uh people will try to interfere and uh jealous family members and remember that you remember when when um when Boaz goes to court there at the gate that's where in the Eastern custom that the courts were at The City Gate he was a he was a judge and he went to court to settle the matter uh between this nearer kin folk uh to Ruth than he was and that of course that that kin folk represented the devil and because Boaz represented Christ but because that you say well you mean I am closer in kinship to Satan than I am to Christ in a new in a in a fallen birth condition exactly that's why when you're born in sin the Bible teaches us that your mind is actually enmity against God it could never agree with God it has to be God coming to you and giving you the ability I love it brother Richie Douglas always says isn't it isn't it amazing brother Jason he says not only only does he give us the word to believe but he gives us the faith to believe it amen oh this is signed sealed and delivered friends I'm so glad today to know that that we not only are given the word of the hour but we're given the faith to believe it and so so yeah sometimes you know you you you get an inheritance from the Lord Jesus but you know you're still in a fallen body that's a result of sin and I'm here to tell you that you got a close Ken Folk called the devil who's always trying to block you and challenge The Inheritance that Christ has given you so I want to say to you today be like the Apostle Paul and don't live after the flesh but live after the spirit see because the sons of God are led by the spirit of God and the spirit of God I promise you is always and ever going to reveal his word to you amen and that will be the ing I heard brother Jason talking about that this morning in his Sunday school how that you you can't say and I've had people believe it or not I've had people look me in the eye and try to say well God gave me a revelation I could do this and I'm like but that's contrary to his word yeah but he gave me a special privilege and I'm like well the Holy Spirit don't do that and I'm not saying a spirit didn't talk to you I'm just saying the Holy Spirit don't do that figure it out amen so you you cannot contradict uh the word of God nothing can can countermand the words of the Lord or his Apostle Paul we today enjoy we say it all the time we are the final voice to the final age and that's because that we have been restored back to Paul's gospel which was the final voice to all the ages of and Paul's words listen friends let me show you how how how much God invested in St Paul Paul's words cannot be countermanded even by God Amen that's because Paul said I didn't get them on my own I didn't get them from a man the Holy Spirit gave them to me and God will never change his mind about his word and that's why Paul said it doesn't matter who comes saying an angel from heaven if even I come saying different what I have said cannot be changed so so you know and we and you see that that you you can see that in in military uh you know there there are some people invested a lot of people don't know that uh that himler actually was Rex furer and his his orders couldn't be countermanded even by Hitler because he was re furer and so so you see this hierarchical order uh that God uses and it's just man and the devil creating imitations and counterfeit copies of it I'm glad that God is a god of order I'm glad he's a god of his word I'm glad he can't change his word break his word fail at his word I'm so glad to know I have an anchor of the Soul amen amen so we we find um that Abraham here is coming to God in verse two uh don't don't put it back up brother Mark stay with stay with that one have Romans writing I'm going to go there in just a second so we find that Abraham was coming to the Lord and it's interesting because you wouldn't imagine Abram would have done this seeing as how God had already called him in chapter 12 and assured him again in Chapter 13 that he would he would have seed and he would Offspring Have offspring that would exceed the dust and so so but aren't we often like Abram don't we often hear the word of God and we know what he said and we know the promise but circumstances we get involved and we get in the trenches and we get down in the big middle of some conundrum and and we go back to God but Lord you said in your word and the Holy Spirit just goes yeah so what's your point well but it doesn't seem like it's coming to pass I find that when I do God that Abraham's lucky that God came a third time because a lot of times I do God that way he doesn't don't even talk to me at all it's fall silent I'm like okay message message received so you know he he he says this one in my house this one in my house this elaser of Damascus you know I'm not a a linguist and and I'm not going to try to give you a lesson in etymology today but but but just when you when you realize this elaser of Damascus that that actually this elaser was a steward in his house and that word Steward can sometimes actually be your Offspring sometimes it's an adopted person or sometimes you you've adopted a child or sometimes it's that you've taken a child and just put in this position as a steward over your house and and so the word literally uh can mean you know son of possession and he's saying to him this one that's actually not of my loins is a son he's in the position as a son of my possession I know that I came in a fallen body but this is not my inheritance see and so so Abraham you know was was was was trying to stress that God to God and and I and I took a a note out of Bible knowledge commentary and they made a a a funny little word play and they said it's as if Abraham was stressing to God that the omen is in the Gomen and that makes a lot of sense to me because of course an openen is is some event um or you know that it it pends something and it might be good or it might be evil you can say you know Jesus said you know when you see the sky red and lowering that's an omen that pends a certain thing is coming and uh and and it might be something good it might be something evil an omen doesn't NE it means either one uh but we find that that aomen now you'd know the word more perfectly from the word nomenclature which we use in English all the time and and and it's a title it's a name it's a position it's an assignment that you give to something to identify it and they use the example that in back in Roman days that and here's a name that you would know uh when we when we talk about Marcus um Tellus Cicero now I only would know him as cisero but he was a Roman Statesman uh there in the early Roman Republic he was an orator he was a writer and and so they they were saying that that tus was his Gman in other words that wasn't his first name name and they name they're a little bit different than what the way we name we have a first name middle name last name and that last name is our surname that's not exactly how the Romans did it that middle name was his family name it was his gener generational name he was part of that family and then the the third name cisero was was just a refinement to show what branch in the family like I might say I'm Jason's son of Ed and Jean see and so so we realize that that it was his family name and they and they would do that the Romans would often do that uh cpio actually when he when he conquered uh the carth uh uh the uh I forget the what they call them uh the carthaginians there uh in the Punic Wars and when he and because he came back and conquered that part of Africa Africans became part of his name and they kind of attached it on as like a title at at the end of his name so so when we when you when you hear the real reason I'm saying this is so that you can understand that that what Abraham was saying is that that I've got a member of my family that's in the line of inheritance that's not exactly my family and I don't really think it's what you meant when you said I would be the father of Nations right amen amen there's a revelation of God's glory that lives in Believers brother Mark give me Roman Romans 8:18 Paul says here for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy uh to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us I'm glad for that promise my goodness I am so glad for that promise because sometimes we have a lot of sufferings and sometimes the sufferings are because of failures that we do to ourselves we suffer at our own hands but I'm glad to know that that that my mistakes don't Define me let me say it like this they don't change the definition of who I really am amen yes amen for the earnest expectation this is our expectation of the creature waiteth oh how we wait for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity see not willingly you didn't volunteer to come born in a fallen condition you didn't volunteer to have a human mind that's enmity against God but the whole thing was going to be a Plan of Redemption if God had not subjected you to that and allowed the fall Satan didn't sucker punch God Amen if God God and God didn't entrap Eve but he made her in such a way that she could choose and and and that's before us today we're all here as Mortals and we have Choice amen amen amen you okay with just this this Foundation this laying some foundation so we we find out that that that God in order to accomplish the characteristic within him it had to get out as a redeemer you know there was nothing in Adam Adam did not understand Redemption he had never been lost so I get it I get it I get it I was talking to a minister some years ago and he says you know Adam was God's perfect Masterpiece brother brandham said he was God's perfect Masterpiece I said exactly in the sense up to what he was just like we wouldn't say of Luther and Wesley brother Ram says don't say they didn't have the Holy Ghost don't say they weren't born again they just didn't have the full because the Holy Ghost is parallel is tantamount is equal to the level of word because faith in the word is what brings the Holy Ghost so when we say we have the token restored at the end time like they had at at in Paul's day it's not saying that Christ wasn't walking in the seven lampstands it's not saying he wasn't in the middle it's just simply saying that everything in the middle wasn't him it had become an ad mixture as brother branham's words and so therefore the the amount of token on display it really couldn't be token on display because the token was the full lamb the blood the full blood of the full lamb see so it wasn't it wasn't a part of it it wasn't you know it wasn't the plasma separated out it it was the full body of chemistry of the blood and it had to be on display so he says so because the creature itself also verse 21 let's read 20 again for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly boy and how but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in Hope because it's all his plan it's all his doing it's all his work word you're his people see this is all about him but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God thanks be to God Almighty for we know and I promise you do know this you you experience it every day for we know the whole creation this broken world yes amen this struggling nature isn't it amazing that that that nature is broken and in sin but every day the sun rises to give him glory and every day the leaves the leaves you know wave their hands and try to praise him every day the grass comes up and reaches up towards him oh think about you and I friends someday when this earth oh and all sin is gone and we stand in bodies where all sin is gone and all sin is gone but we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but we ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to ITT the Redemption of our body for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what for what a man seeth why do he yet hope for in other words if you already if if this is already the Millennium why do I still hope for a millennium but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it now take that down brother Mark let me give you these last two uh 22 through 25 from my retranslation of the book of Romans verse 22 23 24 and 25 just listen for we know that all creation has been groaning as in the Pains of childbirth up to the present time even we Christians although we have the Holy Spirit within us as a foretaste of future Glory also groan to be released from pain and suffering we too Gran inwardly for that day when God will give us our full rights as his children amen including the new bodies he has promised us free from sensuality and the grave remember brother brandom said all of that was gone in that in that body see and that was just the theophany body imagine what the glorified body would be verse 24 for within salvation we find this hope that we speak of and consider if you already have something you wouldn't continue to hope for it but since we look forward to something we don't yet have we confidently wait for it with patience and composure amen so we're not going crazy with the world we could because the world's crazy and it's easy to join that to get on that bus but I'm here to wait patiently with composure and faith and believing and I want the gifts of the Spirit and the fruit of the spirit and I want all of that moving in and out of my life freely without obstacle amen without me getting in the way that's right we have seen the enemy and it is us for sure amen so God blesses his creation we know that uh we we can read about it you know the the Bible tells us that you know you remember that that as he moved through what we would call true Bible um Evolution there is a true true Evolution just like there's a true Trinity there's a Bible Trinity there's a Bible Evolution it's not darwinian that's a lie it's not three persons in a godhead that's a lie that's ancient Babylonian polytheism and Hislop track traced that through the lineage from because you're you're going to come straight there once you come out of the Garden of Eden and leave Cain and Abel and then you go through the lineage you're going to and then you're you're you're going to get to the point where you're you're going to encounter Enoch you're going to encounter a flood and then right away there's there it's not going to be very long by the time you get to another chapter you're got a flood the world's destroyed and then out comes Noah and his three sons and they start again and the next thing you find is they're in in and that's going to lead to Nimrod and Nimrod and the Bible shows and Hislop shows us that he was the first one I think it's even maybe in the scripture I can't remember if I'm uh you know transcribing that in my mind over into scripture but he was the first one to carry War to his neighbors amen and from right there that's what Daniel saw Daniel saw those four Gentile kingdoms the the Babylonian and he saw animals that and they all represented different animals and and in various places it's one animal in another place it's a different kind but anyway it was that Babylonian then the meop Persian and then the Grecian and then the Roman and it's curious that when Daniel is describing every Beast concerning Babylon Persia and Greece he's naming an animal that we can all associate within nature yeah talks about a lion talks about a ram he talks about a goat he talks about it one when he's talking about it again it's a it's a leopard and all these different things and we get it but when Daniel comes to the fourth Beast he can't this is weird he's he's well he's Fierce and he's got iron teeth and he's he he's he's monstrous and and and Daniel can't he can't you know going through his Rolodex of animals he can't exactly what I'm seeing I can't I don't know what to call it and we're just going to call it a beast and it was that fourth Roman Beast it was so powerful that when that as Rome when it ceased being political Rome it just switched and became it went from Pagan Rome to Papa Rome and and then and then coming out of Papa and then Papa Rome is the one who perverted the godhead and water baptism and the original sin and election and all these different things and it and it and it took down all of the ancient Babylonian Gods that they prayed to in the stars and the planets and you know it took down Jupiter and Mars and it put up Venus and put up you know for Peter put up Mars for Paul and and this one for that one oh and I'm I and and and the whole church became an adulterous woman and the Bible shows that that it's Jezebel that they finally would Crown a fall false prophet and sit Jezebel on the throne but then God would come and begin to restore it back and then Luther would come out of that and Luther would carry because he didn't have all the light he's going to carry some of that with him and it comes down to our day and I I've told you many times it was north of 33,000 the latest number I've heard is 40,000 different denominations and various independent Christian organizations 40,000 out of one amen when they first started in the early church every church was a message Church there was no such thing as a Christian Church that wasn't a message church because the message is the gospel in its pure form that's what we've been restored back to thank God Amen thank God so so I you know I'm I'm I'm I'm just drawing you into my picture trying to trying to express the way it it feels to me so so God you know He blesses his creation as he moves through his Evolution but but when he but when he makes Man In His Image when he gets up to that sixth day and he makes Man In His Image he's actually going to give his family an additional blessing amen that wasn't upon everything else it would be a blessing that would set them apart art from all other living creatures so that not only as Sons not only uh you know are we known as God's creatures that can generate uh New Life by being fruitful and you know the text every seed bringing forth of its kind so not only do we have the blessing as other animals that we can bring forth light by being uh life by being fruitful every seed after its kind but we've also been appointed as God's representative image amen and that's a that's next level blessing because now we're in a form we're created in His image and we're literally God's representative image do you wonder why that's so much preaching from a message Pulpit deals with how you should dress how you should conduct yourself things you should do and shouldn't do amen amen do you ever wonder why because we are supposed to be God's representative image so our place and our commission above all other created things is to rule and to oversee the this whole flourishing World on God's behalf amen Prophet said God didn't create the world for himself to rule created for man to rule God rules the universe see so this is actually a main stay that sets our blessing apart from the blessing of all others uh that that that and and here and here and here's a and here's another main stay that as such as the God's image bearers a main stay that sets our blessing apart from the blessing on all others is that we receive the privilege of eating from the Tree of blessing itself amen which is the tree of God's eternal life the Tree of Life the tree of God's eternal life and how do we partake of it how how did Adam and Eve partake of it because they couldn't partake of it directly it hadn't become flesh Yet brother Ram showed us that that's the great mystery the world misses that that's why they get it all tangled up and think he ate a piece of fruit like an apple because they're not realizing that that the way Adam and Eve partook of that fruit that and brother brandom talks about it sustained their life it it renewed their life was they did it by obeying his word they didn't go down a path to a tree and pick a piece of fruit they could eat the the fruit and the trees and the herbs were all for their meat but there was a there was a way of partaking of the tree of life and that was by obeying the word because the Tree of Life The Water of Life the bread of life the Word of Life they're all the same thing they're all Jesus Christ amen so since Jesus had not yet become flesh as brother brandham shows us they could not directly partake of him as a human man walking with them like like we will have in the Millennium so they partook of him by obeying his word and I would say to you today it's the same today it's exactly the same today you don't have access to him in his Incarnation like you will have in the Millennium with Jesus in a glorified body but let me tell you you do have access to him you access him you access his blood you access his Saving Grace you access his Redemptive power through obeying the word there's no other way to be born again outside of an agreement with God's word coming to it by Revelation to hear many he to recognize many are called few are chosen and to act upon his word but there's another tree now remember I'm talking you today about availing ourselves of our inheritance amen or not amen because there is another tree to eat from and we would call it as we as the Bible would say the tree of knowledge which of course is Satan brother brandham said if the tree of life is Jesus then the tree of knowledge is certainly Satan so it's Satan in his desires and I and and I want you just to think about what it means to indulge with Satan with his desires and we find ourselves carried away with the nonsense of the world and we don't sometimes we just take that too lightly do you understand that you're you're consorting with the tree of knowledge that has the the unabashed confessed openly desire to ascend above God Amen you say to me today brother Jason goodness grieve goodness I I I I don't I don't want anything to do with that nasty guy you know but sometimes that that tree of life can can come down to a metaphor and just represent for us a decision or decisions where we find ourselves trying to seize abundance and life on our own terms and by our own wisdom amen that's still a pursuit of the tree of knowledge when you are trying to seize abundance and life on your own terms by your own wisdom I'm going tell you something friends that's when you need to stop drop and roll you are on fire you need to find an altar somewhere and say Lord God not like Jesus not my will thy will be done amen now I'm going to read some statements out of some quotes and I didn't put them on the overhead on purpose because uh I would rather have the the effect of just reading it to you and I'll read and comment as I go now brother Brandon boy there's just nobody can even use the language so confidently like a prophet I just love how he uses it just it creates such a picture in my mind so he's going to talk about you know man you remember there in the in the with the Tower of Babel that their whole thing was we're going to build us a tower and there's two things we're going to try to break back into something we're going to build it up to God and that way if God decides to flood the Earth again we just run in our Tower up to where he is and he have to flood himself to flood us see and then brother brandham with prophetic Insight just like just like Isaiah knew the heart of Lucifer thou has said in thine heart boy Lucifer didn't want that known and Isaiah so added him to the whole world put it in a book and send it to the whole world and and and so brother brandham goes into the heart of those people and he says see they knew they had fallen from something we it's not right what why do we die why job had that question it's not an unreasonable question see it what's next is the question you hear what's after this is there an afterlife what's next some people say oh there's nothing some people say oh that's crazy of course has to be something they just don't know what it is brother brandham says it like this in the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals would you imagine someone falling from the earth now just try to picture this in your mind they're falling from the earth down into a deep pit somewhere and was struggling climbing pulling they must by some means get out of this pit they're not in their original state and frankly they're screaming they're clawing the walls making a noise and doing some way they're they're groaning because that they want to get back to their original state amen that's why a person that's struck with disease aches and pains one time they wasn't that way but they are groaning why they're not they're not right something's wrong I cannot there's something in me intrinsically that says I'm not supposed to get sick and hurt and age there's something intrinsic intrinsic in me that cries out for a new body and a new world this one's broken this one's wrong this is nothing but Warfare and I long for peace I want a rest sir see they're groaning because they want to get back to their original state that's why a person struck with disease aches and pains one time they wasn't that way but they're groaning why that's not right there's something wrong they're groaning trying to get back to where they was when they had health now now he's going to flip it and come down from the natural into the spiritual and when and when Nature and peoples as the Bible said we read it in our text in Romans when we see nature and peoples are groaning it shows something that they're not in their ought to be condition they have fallen from somewhere I'm so glad he said it that way and I because sometimes I have to come to a painful grips with my own shortcomings and failures but I can just say but Lord I I wasn't supposed to be like this and I'm not going to stay like this and I I still believe your word and I got another this coming I'm going from this back to that what I was before I became this they're not in their ought to be conditioned they have fallen from somewhere see we shouldn't have to cry and lament over sickness we shouldn't have to cry and lament over we shouldn't have to cry and lament over our lost children they're supposed to be a Heritage of the Lord given to us and they're supposed to be part of our inheritance and they are but we find ourselves groaning and struggling and crying because we we see the Wayward track but just know this God has this seal the Lord knows all of them that are his and if they're yours they're his Hallelujah so he says now we don't need anybody to interpret that for us of course we know what it was eternal life they had fallen from they lost their claims on eternal life by the fall of Adam and Eve who fell from life to death and the Garden of Eden brought all nature under them to death a tree never died before Adam an animal Wouldn't Die for Adam and there's only one thing that cannot die and that's God because he's Eternal that's the only way we can ever keep from dying we have to have eternal life in us to be Sons and Daughters of God isn't that beautiful amen he says now we are given free moral agency and I keep circling back remember are you going to go to the reading are you just going to stay away from it you You' got an inheritance but you you know what you've done today when you come to church you came to the reading of the will now are you going to leave here and go claim it and take possession of it see amen we were given free moral agency it was given to them just as we so to make a choice now Adam and Eve in the beginning there was a tree of right and wrong before them and that same tree sets before each and every one of us did you hear that there was a tree that set before them and that not a different tree that same tree of knowledge of Good and Evil sets before you and I amen every one of us God God isn't doing for Adam or for Eve you say well that it's their fault no not now it isn't it's your fault you can't place it on Adam now you got to place it on yourself because right and wrong is set before you we're on the same basis as as Adam and Eve but you see when we are redeemed we no more want our own choice but we want his yes oh friends when I F when I first read him it it it almost makes you stop breathing right in wrong is set before you as pilate said what shall I do now that's not pilate now it's you that's why brother brandham came 2,000 years after pilot said that preached a whole sermon and he comes down pilot said what shall I do with Jesus called the Christ what shall you do everybody has to ask that question what shall I do about his word word I'll either give it lordship over my life and I will be his worthy image Bearer to the world or I'll go after Chasing Life and and success and abundance using my own will and my own wisdom right and wrong is set before you because that's really the rub isn't it how do I get past this sinful nature of my birth that betrays me and in enslaves me I want to tell you something friends the extraordinary merciful Saving Grace in The Plan of Redemption is seen in his last line but you see when we are redeemed we no more want our choice we want his choice I'm so glad for that but brother Jason what about the sin that's still dwells in my members as Paul said that is my flesh well you know we just finished up a 10-part series on on how to overcome that amen so uh we we we spent 10 uh sessions answering precisely that question didn't we let me give you another answer to it that I didn't cover in 10 parts so this will be part 10 B brother brandom says from Shalom you okay I told sister de today I said I'm just going to relax I'm just going to relax not going to tr not going to try to do it and not going to try to overdo it but I'm also not gon to try to underdo it amen I'm I'm not going to cover it all I can already see I got pages and pages but I I do want to get to to a certain conclusion at least for today so brother brandham comes in 1964 to this message Shalom he's in vist I believe um that might stand correction but at any rate he says remember the composer knows the end from the beginning he knows all about it that's the reason he could write it here correctly now you must begin with him and you must begin if you want to hear a symphony you begin with him in the music at the symphony you you listen you know what it says it's going to be what the symphony is then you begin to listen at the music so in other words you're you're you're there because you're a you know you're a connoisseur of great of these great Symphonies written by these great Masters and maestros and you understand uh you already a schooled in the thought behind it you know the movements The Melodies you know the what the crescendo means you know when it gets quiet when it gets yeah right amen so brother Brandon this is the point he's trying to make you're you're with it see now watch he he'll go deeper and you know what it is you know just about it here's where certain certain things takes place and you're sitting there waiting oh I love this part here it comes you know he says you're waiting for a certain certain thing that takes place now it's it's got to change now now to anybody else that don't know nothing about that just walked in and sat down it's a bunch of nonsense rattling noise see but the one who knows what it is now we've got a great composer who wrote A Great Masterpiece and he's got changes and movements and he doesn't it's not just you know one page it's page after page of Mastercraft Mastercraft Mastercraft and we're we're just we're we're are you're you're the you're the musicians you're under the direction of the conductor and the conductor's in harmony with the composer and the composer and the conductor and the musicians they're all they're all moving as one and it begins to sweep people away in their emotions people begin to weep people begin to faint you can become so overwhelmed with the Majestic Beauty of some of these pieces and he says he says you you to others it's just not it's nonsense but to the one who knows what it is it's beat out with the music drummed out with the notes it's trumpeted with the trumpets it's strung with the harp it's played with the violin this is all happening in real time simultaneously and everybody's grooving see it's played with the violin it's beat on the bass it's sounded by the Trum but it's beat on the drums the whole thing together in Rhythm and it makes the drama till you can close your eyes and live in it Hallelujah he says if man could lose close his mortal eyes to Earthly sight and live in the presence of Jesus Christ when you see his word being beat out in the great Symphony that we're living in now changing see you must you say oh I that's please I want to do that I I want that to be me you must begin in the symphony you can't be in the symphony following the Sheep music if you're feeding and your whole life is being directed by the tree of knowledge that's not going to work you're you're out of sync you're not even in the same key you don't even got the same sheet music you're going to be exposed as as a fraud as a fake Christian I'm here to tell you I'm not here to chase life or the abundance of Life by my own wisdom and by my own choices the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil sets before every one of us today if man could just close his mortal eyes to the Earthly sight and live in the presence of Christ when you see the word being beat out in the great Symphony that we're living in now changing you must begin in the symphony the only thing you can do if you're in the symphony then you start you begin now watch here he goes you wna you wanna here's my here's my extra piece on how to overcome the flesh Redemption overcame the inner man amen how did I how did I get that that old man to die by a revelation of the word of God I was born again filled with the Holy Spirit but what I do about this flesh amen the only thing you can do if you're in the symphony symphony then you start you begin to get into the Rhythm you begin to get into the Rhythm did you know this has a rhythm for your life this has a beat this has a Harmony it's harmonious with the mind of God as you read it oh I see father oh now I know what you want me to do I wondered and then Paul said I should go back and and and look at my examples and what you did and brother brandom said if you get in a a fix and you don't know what to do go back and just find yourself somebody in the Bible that had that same problem and start rocking like they Rock and start moving like they move and when you do the same thing they did God will bring you out the same way he brought them out he's he's unchanging in his word he's the same yesterday today and forever he'll act for you today just like he did for Moses coming out of Egypt he'll act just like he did for Joshua when he took Jericho he'll act just like he did for Jesus when he walked on the water so brother Brenham explains this principle and he goes on he he he explains this same principle in in in the dance and in a ball game and he says you had to become part of the dance to get out of the dance see to get anything out of it you got to get in it man see you have to become part of the ball game something you're interested in to get in the ball game you see friends I I because I've passed from Death to life I'm already at the dance I'm already at the ball game but I'm not a part of either one of them until I engage with it how do I overcome My Flesh engage with the spirit of the composer see he says you have to become part of the word to know God's Symphony his symphony is when it's playing you understand you're marching with the beat of the time you're watching for it the works that I do shall you also greater than this shall you do these last days oh my he says here the great changing of time we get into the beat beat of the word this is why we are not a denomination amen because the beat of the word beats on past that this is why we're not this is why brother bom said I'm against organized religion because if you stay in organized religion you've got you've got one or two pages of whatever they put a period on and then all the rest of it it might as well not even have it because you you're not allowed to operate in it but I'm not part of a part I'm part of a whole you got to get into the r rhythm of it how does he do it if you get into the word you find out how he did it at the beginning then you know how he does it all the time so so if you think that through I'm still okay on my time you still good so if if you think that through this is exactly why that modern Christianity does not recognize the power and demonstration of the word when they see it when they actually see it and they call it mental telepathy or they call it you know you hypnotize those people people get people blind can suddenly see you hypnotize them wow bring on the hypnotist pay them a gazillion dollars see so he says find out how he did it at the beginning then you know what he's is doing in it all the time so so the mistake that organized religion makes is that they misrepresent what he's doing and a lot of times good people they misrepresent it because they don't know see the Paul said the God of this age hath blinded them amen see but God gave them a legitimate chance to come to light light shined in Darkness Darkness comprehended it not you'd say well then it's not their fault it you could think that until you go read the gospels and then you know that Jesus showed it to them and they made a conscious choice to rejected see their eyes the Bible says Jesus said that that to them their eyes they have closed don't go blaming God they see the Miracles and things that they read in the Bible and they believe it was for the apostles only or they they try to tell us it was from some general age in a in a on day any age anything but this age see uh just not the one we're living in now and and the Bible says having a form of godliness but denying the power brother Ram talks about the authority within the word to to really affect change in our lives people they they have a form of godliness but they deny the power to change them amen don't let me just have the name of Christian but don't don't change anything see wow so you're you're throwing off and and and you're you're you're denying the responsibility to become the image of the word that's what you're doing I'm not here to hurt your feelings but this the house of judgment that's exactly what you're doing you're throwing off when you will not let the word when your life when you will not let your life say Amen to every word you say but you know does that mean I'll never make a mistake of course it doesn't mean that that's the whole Reon you let the word have say so so you make less of those and the ones you make you get forgiveness for and you do better but when you throw off and you deny the responsibility to become the image of the word say how did I become responsible for it because you were born in His image you were given an additional blessing above all other creatures to be his image Bearer to rule see and to have dominion over this and over that so and then even as Believers friends listen even as Believers we dealt with this a lot in our abiding in Christ series but because even as Believers let me just say it today you will never know the power of God and the freshness of his Spirit if your primary ambition is toward the world rather than the word full stop that's it amen I could have just read a text quoted you that and you could have went home benefited even as a Believer you'll never really know you will at least not in its fullness you'll never know the power of God operating in your life you'll never get to feel the daily freshness of his Spirit if your primary ambition is toward the world and how you can have life and gather abundance by your own choices and using your own wisdom you're never going to know the power of God in your life but let me tell you something friends that the purpose of God giving us his word is is showing us how to survive in this Fallen world that's the reason he gives it to you you're not here alone what do you think Jesus meant when he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you that's how you ultimately Escape it see I can I say it like this I I haven't come to the dance to be reformed amen amen that's that's just a somewhat improved version of your former self that's not a new birth you're not in the game see but the Bible says to you and I arise shine arise bride of Christ shine why thy light has come good news you don't have to wander around in the darkness of 40,000 variations of one gospel arise and shine thy light has come it's come all the way as we said last time it's come all the way from eternity he stepped all the way from eternity to me and you to give us life to give us a Revival to be in you to live in you to see you come his goal is to see you come into where the Lord to where the Lord has always desired you to be why won't he just leave me alone and let me be mediocre cuz that's not the vision that's not his vision of you and he's bringing you every day into his vision see that's right we're not here merely gather uh understanding and rejoice over it I mean we do Rejoice over it but but what are you going to do about it Amen brother Brandon would say it like that he say now you say oh brother brandom I sure enjoyed that message he said okay thank you sister but my question is will you do it see so everything we've learned must be brought down to the Here and Now of everyday life I want to say it again everything that we hear everything that we learn of God we learn it we hear it we learn it to bring it down to as brother brandham said you know you don't blow the steam out the top you just blow it out the whistle Pentecostal babies do that but the the trick is to get that Steam down into the gears get this locomotive moving down the track see so so since you know uh since election shows me and this and this is this is true election shows me that I came from the word that being the case then I was born into this world to be a part of the word already when I got here I was already to be a part of the word though I was born in the world Amen that's what election teaches me therefore true Christianity is a power and demonstration of the word true Christianity the kind that goes in the first resurrection the kind that that meets with the sleeping Saints the kind that meets Christ in the air the kind that sits at a table thousands of miles long the kind that comes back with Christ in the millennial world that kind is the kind that that that that have the power and demonstration of the word operating in their life amen which is to say that my life should depict the power it should that's what it should depict what does it depict ask yourself I'm not going to set up at a confessional Booth up here and I'm asking it rhetorically I don't need anybody to jump up and tell me but what does your life tell you about you amen see amen what is your attitude what is your mind what is your what is your first thought say well the devil can can can bring me a thought so what do you do with it right well what am I supposed to do with it you think the Bible didn't know the devil would give you a thought that's why it said take every thought contrary to the word and bring it subject to the word if you'd bring that wrong thought to the Holy Spirit he would kill it immediately see so my life should depict the power and demonstration of who I am in Christ the power and demonstration of what I should be is everything that God wants me to be so you remember Paul said that I've come I didn't come to you in word only amen remember that Paul said I didn't come in word only the gospel came not in word only now watch but in power and demonstration now now let me now let me just jump on that train and and add some add some language to that so the gospel came not in word only but in power and demonstration and if I borrow from St Peter it's a demonstration of the divine nature contained in the promises of God why do you think he says add to this and add to that and add to this and add to that because you've been brought in by Divine promises that you might be a partaker of the Heavenly nature see escape the judgments that are to come so so so as Paul said i' i' I've not come to you in word only but in the power and demonstration of the divine nature in the word can I say to you today that I have come into the world not in election only but in the power and demonstration of the election that I am a part of can I turn for home you know in our opening text Abraham was really making a solid AR Abram was making a solid argument when you view it in real time I mean he wasn't wrong that he still had no seed and God had already promised it to him in in Genesis uh 12 I may I may I may I don't know how far I'll get in this let me just go but he he was making a solid argument when in real time every can I say it like this can I can I just take up for Abram just for a moment every living circumstance testified to the legitimacy of his complaint you say you mean it's question no I mean it's complaint the brother's complaining he's asking it a question yeah you know humans would do that they'll ask you a qu they'll give you a complaint veiled in a question amen amen not going to say that on but all all all men know who are who's very good at doing that but at the end of the day it was still reasoning God's word it was reasonable reasoning can can can y'all give Abram some love today it at least it was reasonable reasoning he just simply says listen you know you can't came to me in chapter 12 you promised me this and you came to me again in Chapter 13 you promis it to me again now here I am in chapter 15 and I'm only getting older I still don't have any children and I'm supposed to be a father of Nations and my and my my seed will be like the Sands and the dust H how's that even going to it's not working you know I just think that the Lord must have walked him out of his prayer closet to go outside and look up into the night sky tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him and now this is the third time he's assuring him so shall thy seed be now we see that fulfilled over in Revelation when you see a number that no man could number so you know I I feel like I feel like yelling into into Genesis 15 and going you made it Abram calm down I you I know you couldn't but I can read the back of the book buddy it's a number that no man can number of of All Peoples tribes and Nations oh there's a number there singing Worthy is the Lamb Hallelujah so in this sense then you find that can I say it like this and I'm just going to have to give it to you the way the way my heart felt it God had to take him Beyond his mental abilities to measure it against because that's what we do we're constantly we're humans we're constantly measuring what's possible Right see against the realities of our circumstances and God's word promised something but our realities don't see that and that becomes our confession so God literally takes him out of his prayer closet walks him out and St says look up at a night count all them Stars when you get done tell me what the number is so he he had to take him Beyond his mental abilities to measures against he took him he took him to an unreasonable comparison to stop him from reasoning amen and God still does this today he will take you into circumstances sometimes so dire and so unreasonable to get you to stop trusting inum reasoning amen amen say that again he'll put you in a consequence a circumstance so un insensible so unreasonable so mindblowing with no hope Abraham had no hope to count the Stars it was so stupidly impossible and God did it that way on purpose and you can get you say I'm in a fix I see no way out but God already has a way out am he has a way for you to keep going forward and so he will do that in this but you know I I I love it because it never came up after Abram got his an an H added because H stands for Divinity and he added an H to his name and it became Abraham and not only did he add it to Abraham but he added it to his bride Sarah and she went from Sarai to Sarah see because and and once God added that Abraham added that AG to Abraham Abram Abram never made that mistake as Abraham see and and that's important God had to give him a name change because brother brandham taught us that the word interpreted now how does he interpret his word by bringing it to pass yes amen always that's how he interprets it that takes all the guess work out Amen brother brandham said he he said these Sons shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils it happens why do you who who I don't need a Greek Theologian to tell me what that means I can see what it means these sign shall follow them that believe I see that happening see and so so so we realize that that the word interpreted is itself a manifestation of the name of God so when God is interpreting his word through your willing compliance you become an image bearer of his name and he values his name even above his word yes see I'm sorry his word above his name you become you become a a manifestation of his word and he values his word above his name and we realize that that of course that that makes sense because God uses different names his names change and evolve as according to what he's doing but his word never changes see so so so we find that he interprets his word by bringing it to pass in our lives and this is exactly why the di recognizing that the name of God was Jesus amen it that's why it's so important uh for that early church and it's it's equally important in the restoration of the brid tree we had to get a revelation of his name and we found out he wasn't a second God he was the god and that's why the Book of Revelation which is the bride's book at the end time it starts out with the revelation of of Jesus Christ I'm here to tell you when you get a revelation of Jesus Christ which you cannot get outside of a new birth it's cut off it's in a mystery it's called The Mystery of redemption but God rich in Mercy reveals not Doctrine not teaching he reveals himself and you get then you get a Next Level when you abide in him because then you start looking like him hallelujah hallelujah and you begin to believe and the more you become like him the more you believe his word and the cycle continues to compound like compound interest the complete mystery of the godhead see because as you've heard me say before the the problem with the with the formula of the trinitarians is it chops God into three persons say well then the Oneness have it no the problem with the formula of the Oneness is they see Jesus only they don't see his body his church his bride which is a direct quote of prophet part of God's godhead because why you're an expression of him you're carrying forth the word of God no wonder the devil fears you when any son or daughter of God in faith puts the word of God on their lips and speak it that's the same as deity speaking what are you afraid of friends why do you keep letting the devil push you around knowing now who you areow just as God would not allow Abram to speak a wrong confession neither are the children of Abraham allowed to confess uh anything that is contrary to what the word declares will you accept that commission today say I will not confess anything contrary to what the word declares the confession of her lips that she is Mrs Jesus Christ is a key component in your Victory but sometimes sometimes every living circumstance in our minds makes that seem impossible I am the he was the beginning of the creation of God I am the continuation uh me do you know you obviously don't know me like I know me me I I'm to put his word on my lips and it's just like he said it amen me I I'm supposed to walk forward in faith like that doubting nothing fearing nothing that that if I say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt it'll happen me see and so we find that to to be able to say that I am part of his godhead that I am Ms Jesus Christ that I am that I am part of the revelation of the mystery and a revelation of a mystery didn't come it's not coming to the world Listen hear me I'm closing it's not a revelation coming to the world because a preacher preached it or somebody taught it from the Bible they already don't believe it a prophet taught it to them for 33 years and proved it with a pillar of fire they're not going to believe anybody saying it what they'll believe is when you can be it that's how you'll persuade your family that's how you persuade the gainsayer that's how you bring somebody to Christ you live it you become it you are it when they meet Christ when they meet you they've met Christ sometimes when we get like Abram we start complaining about the our flesh and the one born in our house let me tell you something friends let me remind you as I close right here Anthony bring your team just like Abram I got one born in my house I'm chained to a dead man I'm carrying him around and it's it's the job it's my job to keep this flesh under the control I am the image bearer of God and it is I am Commissioned I Am commissioned just like in Genesis that I am to rule and have authority over this flesh over the world over sin and over the devil that's right stand to your feet brother brandham said it like this I can't give it to you any pler than the way a prophet said it in the message as I was with Moses he said speaking of Servants of God which we all are this is not just five-fold preachers this is Holy Ghost God's holy ghost filled family and with an extra measure of responsibility on ministers that we are to stand in the steps of Jesus Christ and perform his Works amen you have no idea how many times over the years when you come to this Altar and you've got a prayer request that I am powerless I can't fix it for you I would do it if I could I would heal you if I could brother Ram said what kind of person would I be if somebody came up sick and I refused to heal them he said I can't heal you he said but Jesus has already healed you people that need Deliverance I can't give them Deliverance people that have needs I can't grant that need whatever's in my power I try to Grant it and sometimes I get in the way granting it amen helping people out of a situation God got them in and and I've only made the situation worse come on parents we know that about our kids don't we if you if you've raised teenagers into adulthood you certainly know that sometimes with good intentions you just get in God's way and you bail them out I remember I remember I used to beg God and Lord save my brother save my brother please save him save him Lord save him and the Lord said to me one day just as clear as a bell said how can I save him if you keep saving him I I I'm I felt like I am now silent I couldn't even say anything the Lord so had my number and I knew wow the Lord just found me out I want to have you bow your heads over the building today I want to pray for you I happen to know being a human being that things that were said today and speaking of Abram and the things he was doing and the situation and how God dealt with him and I know that being a human being with you we all have found ourselves at times like Abram and sometimes we [Music] wonder Lord Lord fix this circumstance fix this situation and you're you're wondering why he won't do it and you're unaware that he's put you in that circumstance to fix you deliverance from the circumstance by a Divine Miracle is not the solution you need the solution you need sometimes friends you say well why does God speak like that and then and then sometimes he won't even speak to you at all now I know that happens to you cuz it happens to me sometimes he won't even speak to you at all you know why because he's already told you all he's going to say to you in his word on that subject and until you obey that word don't look for an audible voice Voice or any voice he's saying child I've already spoken to you about this in my word I compel you to be my image Bearer in this matter and if you'll agree to that God will start helping you I know that's true and I'm going to I'll I'll make it easy and I'll destroy the awkwardness I'll just raise up both my hands first how many feel like that at times oh look at those hands everywhere Lord you see see those hands they're up all over the building Lord I'm quite sure that out across the airwaves people are raising up their hands in honest confession Lord yes you've promised it to us many times we see the word we know what you said so did Abram he couldn't deny that you had already told it to him in chapter 12 you had already told it to him again in Chapter 13 what is he doing coming a third time around still complaining and doubting and questioning why why is this why is that and Lord you just simply rather than just rather than explain it all to him he couldn't know what we know today I happen because I can read the book of Revelation I know it all turned out fine I know it all came out okay Abram you'll be okay buddy don't worry you'll be okay but he couldn't know that Lord at the time you you weren't you that was in the early Genesis days you hadn't revealed all of it you'd only told him this is what's going to happen I'm going to I'm going to do it I'm going to do it doesn't even based on you it's what I'm telling you I've already accomplished and this is what's going to happen well then Lord why is my circumstance like it is come out here Abram get get up get out of your prayer closet come outside come here son lord it's dark come out here look up Lord I've looked up a thousand times look up differently this time what do you want me to do Lord count those stars and give me the number Lord that's impossible then if if you think that that's impossible then stop thinking then stop looking at my promise and think I can't bring it to pass cuz Abram I know exactly how many stars are up there I actually built them and hung them there stop looking at your circumstance be my image Bearer go forward I got you I got this it's all going to come out according to my plan I just need you to be willing to Bear my image and I need you to be willing to rule and to oversee all of the flourishing life that I build I want you to be in charge of it Abraham Abraham's children I want you to be in charge of it I want you to be an expression of my name to the world I want you to go forth today Lord I volunteer I raise up my hands now how many volunteers we got today say Lord I'm sorry I ever doubted you I I want to believe your word today oh God move in my heart in my life Lord let it become so real to me I can see you in your plan so clearly Lord I won't want my own plan and my own way and my own way in dreams and thoughts and wisdom not going to chase life and Lord my heart becomes heavy at times like this you know well as a pastor Lord when I when I can think of your family and your children who I know love you and I know you love them but yet I just see them going further and further they don't realize they're they're they're taking their cues from the Tree of knowledge they don't realize it they wouldn't do it if they did and if and if they were here in church today they might have heard me preach it and stopped doing that Satan's got him running off somewhere pulling Pharaoh's Chariot building Pharaoh's Kingdom forsaking the assembling of them eles together as they see the day approaching my heart gets heavy over stuff like that Lord I pray today a special prayer that you will reach out and that you will lift them up above the shadows of that let them see the exercise and futility that that kind of life is bring them into a greater closer Union with you draw them oh God up into thy presence let your anointing fall upon them and bring them today this day just a little closer to the image that you saw of them before the foundation of the world I pray you grant it I commit it to you I commit myself I commit this assembly it felt good today Lord to be back in the saddle proclaiming your word it's been a wonderful lesson I didn't get to finish it I'm sorry for that Jesus I tried but I of course you know I wouldn't have stopped had you not gave me the green light to stop so I I I just leave it in your hands now Lord we'll pick it back up if there's a tomorrow we'll pick it back up again I commit it to you in Jesus name amen do you love him do you love him really you love him with all your heart let's sing it [Music] now I [Music] live every
