[1:58] e
[2:28] e
[2:58] for
[3:28] e
[3:58] e e
[4:32] buildings and what looks to be like some
[4:35] kind of tower in the background um I
[4:37] don't know Josh if you have that
[4:38] PowerPoint um it's coming up right now
[4:41] but this this has to do with how close
[4:46] that he is to the tree and the type of
[4:49] lens that he was using but what's so
[4:51] striking to me is that as he gets closer
[4:54] to the tree the further away the
[4:57] background structures gets and you know
[5:00] there's several factors involving
[5:02] photography here that we that we won't
[5:04] get into this morning with field of view
[5:07] and subject distance and just some
[5:09] mathematical stuff but the main focus
[5:11] and the entire premise of this was that
[5:14] this artist or this photographer wrote a
[5:16] whole lesson on what he did here and he
[5:18] summed it up into what he what he called
[5:20] a one sentence takeaway and it was this
[5:24] as we widen our focal length and move
[5:28] closer to main subject the background
[5:32] elements in our scene will appear
[5:35] smaller do you have it
[5:42] brother as we widen I want to read that
[5:45] one more time as we widen our focal
[5:47] length and move closer to our main
[5:50] subject the background elements in our
[5:53] scene will appear smaller now
[5:56] spiritually this morning if we we
[6:00] um as we widen our Focus uh our heavenly
[6:04] father will broaden our perspective of
[6:06] his word in our life as he grows us and
[6:09] as he matures us as he takes us through
[6:11] things you know we're continuing to
[6:14] advance forward we're pressing towards
[6:16] our Mark and we widen our focal length
[6:19] you know and just think it on on a
[6:21] spiritual uh spiritual thinking field
[6:23] this morning you know and as those
[6:26] background elements in our
[6:28] scene smaller and smaller you know and I
[6:32] just I want this concept to to get into
[6:35] our hearts this morning I felt like it
[6:37] was just it was so encouraging when I
[6:38] saw this and I studing this as we move
[6:41] towards and progress through this life
[6:43] sometimes it doesn't feel like much has
[6:45] happening amen sometimes you feel maybe
[6:48] like you're not growing spiritually
[6:50] sometimes you you might feel like you're
[6:52] not pressing towards the mark you might
[6:54] you might not feel it all the way amen
[6:57] but you know
[7:00] there is growth
[7:02] happening and does anybody else ever
[7:04] feel like that amen and somehow you know
[7:09] you are Josh
[7:16] man okay amen so anyway um it just
[7:20] doesn't feel like much is happening but
[7:22] something is happening in your life amen
[7:24] something is taking place and I don't
[7:28] have the images but I want to just try
[7:29] to draw the picture in your mind this
[7:32] tree there's a tree and it's as you as
[7:36] he moves closer to the tree the tree
[7:37] doesn't look any bigger because the uh
[7:41] the lens that the photographer is using
[7:43] is a different lens right so the tree
[7:46] actually looks like it's the same size
[7:48] but then you move there's four different
[7:50] images as you move closer to the next
[7:53] image he's actually 50 feet closer and
[7:55] then as you move NE the next image he's
[7:57] over 100 feet closer by the time that he
[8:00] gets to the final image he's over 400t
[8:04] closer to where he was when he started
[8:07] now the tree looks the same size because
[8:09] he widened his array he widened his lens
[8:13] but all that stuff in the background is
[8:15] so much further away it begins to just
[8:18] lose itself in the Horizon and we're
[8:20] going to get into that this morning as
[8:22] you as you broaden your perspective in
[8:24] the word it may not always feel like
[8:26] you're growing and it may not always
[8:28] look like you're growing but as long as
[8:31] you're pressing towards the mark As long
[8:32] as you're keeping these statutes then
[8:35] sometimes you just need to take a step
[8:36] back a reflection sometimes is important
[8:39] sometimes you need to look back and you
[8:40] say wow that used to trouble me but it
[8:42] doesn't trouble me anymore those things
[8:44] used to hinder my walk but those things
[8:46] don't hinder my walk anymore you know
[8:48] and all of those things it may not look
[8:50] like you're getting closer but you're
[8:52] closer cuz God says that you press
[8:54] towards the mark amen and as we begin to
[8:57] mature in our Christian walk God is
[9:00] giving us more and more These Are
[9:02] Spiritual Stepping Stones the These Are
[9:04] Spiritual building blocks that that we
[9:06] that that we pressing forward and
[9:08] eventually all of those things in the
[9:10] background and I have just you know all
[9:13] those trials and all those hardships and
[9:15] all those difficulties and all those
[9:17] doubts it it's just getting further and
[9:19] further away and eventually it's just
[9:21] going to it's just going to dissipate
[9:23] into the background amen all that all
[9:24] that doubt you know and sometimes just
[9:27] to think of it this morning say
[9:28] sometimes you can't notice those things
[9:30] those burdens that you once carried
[9:32] until you look back and you're able to
[9:35] see all the ground that you really have
[9:37] gained amen sometimes you just need to
[9:39] take a step you know you feel what the
[9:41] enemy does in our minds is he gets us he
[9:44] gets us so so narrow-minded into what's
[9:48] happening right now in your day right in
[9:50] in this day in this time and in this
[9:51] moment but the Lord is progressing you
[9:55] amen he is if you're still here if
[9:57] you're still in church if you have a
[9:58] desire this morning then he's still
[10:00] progressing you sometimes he just wants
[10:01] you to look back and say look remember
[10:04] when you once struggled with that or
[10:05] remember when you once had a question
[10:07] about that or remember when you went
[10:09] through this circumstance and I allowed
[10:11] that circumstance but now you're past it
[10:13] and now you've matured in it and now
[10:15] you've matured in the word so sometimes
[10:17] those moments of of reflection are are
[10:20] important and amen you know you are
[10:23] gaining ground towards Victory amen and
[10:25] all those all those past defeats cuz
[10:28] sometimes sometimes those things in the
[10:29] background are defeats we do have
[10:31] defeats we do have failures we do have
[10:33] faults anyone who thinks that they don't
[10:36] is is wrong you have faults and you have
[10:38] failures and you have times where you
[10:39] slip up but those things are also what
[10:43] get pushed out into the background
[10:45] because you know it's not about the
[10:47] mistake that you made it's about what
[10:48] you did after you made the mistake it's
[10:50] about it's about how you got back up
[10:51] from that thing amen you know and I
[10:54] believe we've probably don't worry about
[10:56] those pictures um I believe we've
[10:58] probably all heard brother Ben talk
[10:59] about this picture he saw it's called
[11:01] this Cloudland image um you know and
[11:04] then there was an image an artist
[11:06] painted called the Cloudland and and he
[11:08] talks about it several times and and he
[11:10] describes how it was a German painter
[11:12] that painted it and you know when you
[11:14] look at the picture from a distance it's
[11:16] just it's completely Mis misunderstood
[11:18] I'm sure we've all heard about this
[11:20] before and brother brandham said when he
[11:22] viewed the image um from far away it was
[11:26] and these were his words it was the
[11:28] horriblest looking Gloom that he's ever
[11:30] seen But as he got closer to the image
[11:33] he realized it was actually this
[11:35] beautiful portrayal of these angels
[11:38] beating their you know beating their
[11:40] wings together and it struck me because
[11:42] as I was as I began thinking about this
[11:44] and example after example of how often
[11:47] times we can see something from a far
[11:50] off and completely Mis misunderstand it
[11:53] you know sometimes sometimes when you're
[11:55] seeing something from a distance it can
[11:57] be misunderstood you know the the human
[11:59] eye
[11:59] is only limited to see so far even if
[12:02] you have perfect vision it can only see
[12:05] things clearly within a few hundred feet
[12:07] and of course there are exceptions to
[12:09] that you know of course you know there's
[12:10] this excerpt I got from a quick search
[12:12] on it that the concept of line of sight
[12:15] is crucial when considering how far we
[12:17] can see this doesn't just mean removing
[12:20] obstacles from your line of sight you
[12:22] need to think about the curvature of the
[12:24] Earth itself when you're considering
[12:26] maximum distances and on a clear Day St
[12:29] standing at sea level The Horizon is
[12:31] typically about 3 mil away or so which
[12:33] is usually the maximum limit you can see
[12:36] however this changes drastically
[12:39] depending on your elevation now that's
[12:42] an important statement for instance from
[12:44] the top of Mount Everest on a clear day
[12:45] The Horizon would be visible at a
[12:47] distance of about 230 miles however
[12:50] think back to the stars and the moon
[12:52] there there's no Horizon blocking your
[12:55] view so you can see objects that are
[12:57] millions or even billions of miles away
[13:00] you know so the Horizon and I want this
[13:02] to this is spiritually to think about
[13:04] this The Horizon plays an important part
[13:08] in your maximum visual range The Horizon
[13:11] amen the Sun the setting of The Sun you
[13:13] remember how brother brandom in 1965
[13:15] would say sometimes we just need to we
[13:17] just need to let the sun just come and
[13:19] ripen us ripen the word into our hearts
[13:21] and let the let the word just come and
[13:23] soak in the seed has been planted now
[13:25] the sun has to come and ripen that seed
[13:27] so it can grow out of us amen and
[13:29] sometimes we can see objects but until
[13:32] we get close enough to the object we may
[13:35] not be able to fully identify what it is
[13:38] or what its meaning or its value is amen
[13:42] and the same thing goes on the other
[13:44] side of this you know we often times can
[13:46] can look at things going on spiritually
[13:48] or just naturally in our lives but it's
[13:51] not until you get on the other side of
[13:53] it that you're able to fully understand
[13:56] it or to fully appreciate it amen
[13:59] you know and and just like that just
[14:01] like that definition in visual Acuity
[14:03] there that I was given you know
[14:05] sometimes God needs to elevate you a
[14:08] little bit higher to get a longer Range
[14:11] View of what's going on Amen and that's
[14:14] important that's the the elevation of of
[14:17] some of the things that we go into in
[14:19] our lives you know the the trials of
[14:20] course but it's not just that it's it's
[14:23] the the testings it's the it's the all
[14:26] of the all of the above you put it in
[14:28] there that's how God mat ures you and
[14:29] grows you trials are in there of course
[14:31] but he does it in other ways as well and
[14:35] and I love how they put that cuz it had
[14:36] a lot to do with the Horizon amen and a
[14:40] lot of it has to do with light and how
[14:42] much light is included in what you're
[14:44] looking at and um sometimes you know you
[14:48] may not see just exactly what it is
[14:51] doing especially when it when it's
[14:53] happening what it's doing to help you
[14:55] grow until a little bit further in the
[14:58] future but but nevertheless God knew
[15:01] from the beginning that it was going to
[15:02] be beautiful amen and Ecclesiastes 3 I
[15:05] love that I love that scripture God hath
[15:08] made beautiful God hath made everything
[15:10] beautiful in whose time in his time amen
[15:13] his time is unlimited it's unimaginable
[15:17] so it it happens and sometimes it
[15:19] doesn't happen in our time sometimes I
[15:21] wish it did but it doesn't it happens in
[15:23] his time but he does make everything
[15:25] beautiful amen and I I began to think
[15:28] about this subject with relation to
[15:30] distance and and and I thought about how
[15:33] sometimes we can analyze situations from
[15:35] a distance you know and just to kind of
[15:38] pivot a little bit here you know
[15:39] sometimes we can hear some type of of of
[15:42] gossip about a certain person or maybe
[15:44] hear what they said or what they did and
[15:46] then we begin to have a misconception
[15:48] some conceptions about the person and
[15:50] often times it's a misconception about
[15:52] those people or about those situations
[15:54] and what can happen and this this
[15:55] happens to all of us because we're all
[15:57] human is we look at a s a situation from
[16:00] the distance and we see exactly what
[16:02] brother bam saw what an awful mess it is
[16:05] just like this picture it may be the
[16:06] most horribl sight you ever look at but
[16:09] if we can start applying what the
[16:11] scripture says here and um you know and
[16:13] this isn't in every in every situation
[16:15] you know we have to have mature Minds
[16:18] when we think about this but we esteem
[16:20] your brothers higher than than yourself
[16:22] the Bible teaches us that esteem your
[16:24] brothers higher they're going through
[16:25] something we esteem them higher don't
[16:27] think ill of them even if they made a
[16:29] mistake look around at your brothers and
[16:31] sisters this morning cuz they're going
[16:32] to make mistakes you they's going to
[16:35] they're going to say something they're
[16:36] going to do something it's just going to
[16:37] happen that's we're human we're human
[16:39] beings we're in this flesh so it's going
[16:42] to happen but if we can if we can
[16:45] quickly as well as this is this is
[16:47] something that I felt like the Lord just
[16:49] you know has had me go through on this
[16:52] just studying for this you know we have
[16:54] an advocate on the throne amen we have
[16:56] an intercessor he's the high priest of
[16:58] our profession amen and he's still on
[17:01] that throne interceding and all we have
[17:03] to do is what we have to repent of those
[17:04] things and that's that's a thing that
[17:06] happens on a daily basis you know we're
[17:08] not we're not you know living in sinless
[17:11] bodies yet you know we're of course once
[17:13] we have our new nature we live above
[17:15] those things but we still sometimes will
[17:18] fall and we'll still sometimes make
[17:19] mistakes and that's why he's still
[17:20] sitting on the throne amen but what we
[17:23] have to do is repent and him who is
[17:26] faithful and these are scriptures now
[17:28] will forgive and that's the model that
[17:30] we're supposed to follow amen we're
[17:32] supposed to follow Jesus's model on that
[17:35] if we apply those scriptural Concepts I
[17:38] believe we we we we'll start you know
[17:42] and we'll all start seeing and not that
[17:45] we haven't but just reapplying sometimes
[17:48] I was just listening to pet the other
[17:49] Peter the other day this is just to
[17:51] bring back to remembrance amen we all
[17:53] know these things but we ought to bring
[17:55] it back to our remembrance we'll start
[17:57] seeing the beauty of the image a whole
[17:59] lot more in our lives and in the lives
[18:01] of our brothers and sisters you know
[18:03] like I said your brother or your sister
[18:04] next to you today sitting on these pews
[18:06] they're going to mess up maybe they're
[18:07] going to say something or do something
[18:09] that isn't always right but I believe
[18:11] that we can reach a point in maturity
[18:13] where we can move past those things and
[18:16] quickly at that amen forgive 70 time
[18:19] seven turn the other cheek and don't you
[18:21] know don't hold grudges against people
[18:25] um I I this is this is actually from the
[18:28] Mayo Clinic this is their organization's
[18:31] website so it's medically accredited
[18:33] amen and I got these statements directly
[18:35] from Mayo Clinic forgiveness can lead to
[18:37] healthier relationships improve mental
[18:39] health less anxiety stress hostility
[18:42] fewer symptoms of depression lower blood
[18:45] blood pressure a stronger immune system
[18:47] improved heart health and improved
[18:49] self-esteem amen amen God knew this
[18:53] before any doctor ever knew this before
[18:55] they had to go through studies before
[18:57] they had to go through years and years
[18:58] of analysis God knew this so he put in
[19:00] his word forgive amen forgive 70 time 7
[19:04] you know he might mess up he might do
[19:06] the same exact thing that he did last
[19:08] week or the the week before forgive and
[19:11] I know sometimes it's difficult but
[19:12] sometimes God just wants us to grow and
[19:14] and be mature in those things and and
[19:16] and know that it's not it's not about us
[19:19] it's about the the grander picture amen
[19:22] that's why we have to let stuff go in
[19:23] our lives and and we got to arise above
[19:26] that thing because if you're not careful
[19:28] you know it can Can it can also lead to
[19:30] serious you know it talks about physical
[19:32] health but it can also lead to Serious
[19:34] hindrances in your spiritual growth as
[19:36] well amen you know do you think that
[19:38] Jesus would be pleased knowing that
[19:41] we're holding something against somebody
[19:43] you know or um you know when when he
[19:47] forgave me of stuff probably 10 times
[19:49] worse than whatever it is that this
[19:51] person did amen amen amen the Bible says
[19:55] if you have a quarrel against a brother
[19:56] approach that person amen scripture and
[19:59] listen to the Lord's instruction on this
[20:01] Matthew 18 He says moreover if any
[20:03] brother shall trespass against thee go
[20:04] and tell him his fault between thee and
[20:06] him alone if she if he shall hear thee
[20:09] thou Hast gained a brother but if he
[20:12] will not hear thee then take three uh
[20:15] take with thee one or two more that is
[20:17] in the mouth of two or three Witnesses
[20:18] every word may be established and if he
[20:21] neglect to hear them tell it unto the
[20:23] church but if he neglect to hear the
[20:25] church let him be unto thee as a heathen
[20:27] man as a publican and how often now
[20:29] there's three steps there that that
[20:31] Jesus gives and how often do people skip
[20:35] step one and they go right to step two
[20:37] or to step three they go and tell their
[20:39] brothers or their friends in the church
[20:40] or or maybe they even turn it into
[20:42] gossip you know and one thing I know for
[20:45] sure amen and I don't know I'm not
[20:47] thinking of anybody specifically with
[20:49] this I hope nobody thinks that I had
[20:50] nobody in mind I have no idea about
[20:53] anybody doing any gossip I just want to
[20:54] go ahead and get that out there I don't
[20:55] know why the Lord wanted me to say this
[20:57] this morning but one thing I know for
[20:59] sure is there is not going to be any
[21:00] gossip in heaven amen there are going to
[21:02] be there are going to be brothers and
[21:04] sisters living in unity amen we are to
[21:07] we are to be of one mind and of one
[21:09] Accord amen that is how they were able
[21:12] to break through in the upper room that
[21:14] is how they were able to break through
[21:16] and and get to the place that God wanted
[21:18] them to get to they were in one mind and
[21:20] one Accord every place in the scripture
[21:22] where there was in one mind and one
[21:23] Accord there's something happen
[21:25] supernaturally spiritually incredible
[21:27] amen and even on the other side of
[21:30] things and I I think brother Jason had
[21:32] made this statement years ago even when
[21:34] they were in one in mind in one Accord
[21:35] there's something about that they did
[21:37] that at the Tower of Babel and God had
[21:38] to change their language amen because
[21:40] there's something about it when Humans
[21:42] Beings get together in one mind in one
[21:45] Accord um and I believe that that's the
[21:48] way that the Lord wants us to live now
[21:50] amen Ephesians 4:13 says till we all
[21:53] come into the unity of the faith and of
[21:55] the knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[21:57] perfect man under the measure of the
[21:59] stature of the fullness of Christ amen
[22:01] that's the maturity that he wants us to
[22:03] attain in these bodies amen a unity in
[22:05] the faith Even in our differences amen
[22:08] Even in our differences giving respect
[22:11] one to another he goes on to say that we
[22:13] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[22:16] and fro carried about with every wind of
[22:18] Doctrine by the slight of man and
[22:20] cunning craftiness whereby they lie and
[22:23] wait to deceive but speaking the truth
[22:25] in love may grow up in all things which
[22:28] is the the head even Christ from whom
[22:30] the whole body jointly are fit fitly
[22:33] joined together and compacted excuse me
[22:35] by that which every joint supplieth
[22:38] according to the effectual working and
[22:39] measure of every part maketh increase of
[22:42] the body and the edifying of itself in
[22:44] love Ephesians 4 so growing up in all
[22:48] things a port maturing amen if he goes
[22:52] on to say in 20 verse 22 that ye put off
[22:55] the former conversation the old man
[22:59] which is corrupt according to the
[23:01] deceitful lust and be renewed Amen in
[23:04] the spirit of your mind that you put on
[23:06] a new man which after God is created in
[23:09] righteousness and true Holiness
[23:10] wherefore putting away lying and speak
[23:13] every man truth with his neighbor for we
[23:15] are members one of another amen we are
[23:19] members one of another and let all
[23:21] bitterness and wrath and anger and evil
[23:25] speaking be put away with you amen that
[23:28] be kind one to another uh uh I'm sorry
[23:32] with all malice and be kind one to
[23:33] another tender-hearted forgiving one
[23:35] another even as God for Christ's sake
[23:38] hath forgiven you amen all that
[23:40] bitterness and all that evil speaking to
[23:42] be put away and that means that any
[23:45] attitudes or any bitterness to or any
[23:48] ill thought towards a brother or sister
[23:50] the Bible commands us we have to forgive
[23:53] those things amen and that's that's what
[23:55] I that's what we're striving for that
[23:56] the scripture says to be truly
[23:59] tenderhearted towards each other that
[24:02] that's what's going to give your brother
[24:03] or sister maybe the Boost that they need
[24:06] when they're when they're when they're
[24:07] down amen usually you know when when I
[24:11] know when I make a mistake we beat
[24:13] ourselves up worse than anybody else
[24:15] would amen we're Our Own Worst uh enemy
[24:18] which is good you know we have to be
[24:20] that way we have to make sure that we
[24:21] keep ourselves in check when we we may
[24:23] make a mistake but I know that when I'm
[24:25] in a situation like that you know I beat
[24:28] myself up and to hear a word of
[24:29] encouragement especially from maybe the
[24:32] person that that I I wronged or or
[24:34] whatever the situation is to get that
[24:36] kind of a boost it it it's It's
[24:39] Supernatural amen that's God in you
[24:41] that's God working through you amen hope
[24:44] this is all right this morning um just
[24:46] felt like the Lord wanted me to go this
[24:48] way so um and Josh did you end up
[24:50] getting that or no okay getting back to
[24:53] distance this morning sometimes we know
[24:55] when we're looking at things from a
[24:56] distance like the cloud image um that
[24:58] the prophet was speaking about it does
[25:00] look gloomy you know and it looks dark
[25:02] and we talked about uh in the previous
[25:05] two or three lessons we talked about
[25:07] Paul and his trial that he was facing
[25:09] and how the things that we go through
[25:11] how often times it can look dark and
[25:13] often seems like it's a horrible sight
[25:15] but if you can just take a few steps
[25:18] closer and maybe shed some light on the
[25:21] image uh it can change the whole
[25:23] Viewpoint of it and and all the
[25:25] background shatter just like that
[25:27] example we gave um for those who weren't
[25:29] in here that you know that image you
[25:30] know as you as he got closer to the tree
[25:33] you know several hundred feet closer to
[25:36] the tree there was the tree from the uh
[25:39] image itself looked about the same
[25:41] height and but all of the stuff in the
[25:44] background got it was almost as if you
[25:46] couldn't even see it anymore and that
[25:48] was because he widened his angle he he
[25:51] put a different lens on the camera and
[25:53] that's what we are to do amen sometimes
[25:55] you need you're moving closer to the
[25:57] mark you need to watch your angle you
[25:59] need to allow the Lord to bring you into
[26:00] a mature place to see because then
[26:03] you'll know because all it may not feel
[26:06] like it but you'll know because all that
[26:08] stuff in the distance is it's just
[26:09] fading away amen those the the the
[26:12] background the hardships that we face
[26:14] you know it just gets further and
[26:16] further into the distance and eventually
[26:18] just disappears and um I think I made
[26:22] this point here some time ago but you
[26:24] know all those hardships and mind
[26:25] battles and disappointments one day
[26:27] they're going to vanish away forever
[26:29] amen and it's and it's all going to be
[26:32] left we're all going to be into the in
[26:35] the Glorious future that God has
[26:37] prepared for us amen and what was once
[26:40] this picture of Doom and Gloom now has
[26:43] become these angel wings beating
[26:44] together in that Cloudland image that
[26:46] brother renom was talking about amen um
[26:50] there's that scripture I think this is
[26:51] just the last few statements here uh in
[26:54] just in just a short time the Bible says
[26:58] you know and we know this that your
[27:00] mourning will be turned into laughter
[27:01] Ecclesiastes 3 and I wanted to just end
[27:04] on some of these scriptures here what
[27:07] profit hath he that worketh in that
[27:10] wherein he labor I have seen the travail
[27:14] which God hath given to the sons of men
[27:17] to be exercised in it he hath made
[27:20] everything beautiful in his time also he
[27:24] hath set the world in their heart so
[27:26] that no man can find out the work that
[27:28] God maketh from the beginning to the end
[27:30] and I thought what an interesting thing
[27:32] the travail that God hath given to the
[27:35] sons of men to what to be exercised in
[27:38] it amen he has given us these things to
[27:41] be exercised in it to exercise our faith
[27:43] as Sons and Daughters of God to grow us
[27:46] uh in maturity to to get us to see
[27:48] things from a different perspective a
[27:50] Heavenly perspective amen and I I want
[27:53] these scriptures to be not just
[27:55] something I read I want them to be
[27:56] reality in my life amen right amen I
[27:59] think sometimes that that we can preach
[28:01] on on Trials or things we face you know
[28:04] uh I was just going to say me sometimes
[28:07] we've not to single anybody out but I'll
[28:09] just you know we're not talking about
[28:11] anybody here but we make it seem like
[28:12] maybe what you're going through in life
[28:14] is going to be this constant wave of
[28:16] incredible trial and pain and suffering
[28:19] but Saints it's not always like that
[28:21] amen granted you will have hardships the
[28:23] Bible teaches that we're going to have
[28:24] trials and you know acts 14 we must
[28:27] through many tribulation enter the
[28:29] kingdom of God and the trials and the
[28:31] tests they prove our faith first Peter
[28:33] teaches us that and we will face
[28:35] difficult situations and difficult
[28:36] things but as Believers we can't view
[28:39] our life as this long bumpy road of
[28:41] Gloom all the time amen if we live in a
[28:44] place where our constant thought process
[28:47] is the trials that you faced or the
[28:48] things that even that you're currently
[28:50] going through you're going to find
[28:51] yourself living in a place of Gloom you
[28:54] know when and I I think I was listening
[28:55] to brother darl Ward this Wednesday and
[28:57] he was talking about you know just the
[28:58] symptoms you know when you start getting
[29:01] when you start focusing on the symptoms
[29:02] and he's talking about what brother rham
[29:04] said with with Jonah and he's looking
[29:06] he's got symptoms he's the worst worst
[29:08] symptomatic person you've ever seen he's
[29:10] got symptoms on every side sometimes
[29:11] when you get focused on the symptoms or
[29:14] what what you're facing currently or the
[29:15] Mind battles then you're going to get
[29:17] locked up into that place and I know I'm
[29:18] guilty of that a lot you get locked up
[29:20] into that place but what you start to do
[29:24] is you start to focus on something else
[29:26] amen you start to allow the the presence
[29:29] of the Lord to come in and um you know
[29:33] look at look at yourself and and just
[29:35] say Lord where is it that where is it
[29:38] that I can be other than where I'm at
[29:40] right now amen I want to I want to grow
[29:42] from this I don't want to be in this
[29:43] place anymore and God has a provided
[29:46] time of healing for you he's already
[29:49] done it but he knows when it will
[29:50] manifest in your life so we're not to
[29:52] focus on that we're to focus on how
[29:54] we're going to grow from it we're we're
[29:56] to focus on how how can we not focus on
[29:59] the symptoms
[30:02] amen and when those Believers there in
[30:05] Acts they went through those hardships
[30:06] and they were and they were beaten and
[30:08] tortured and they went through the worst
[30:10] things any of us have ever had to face
[30:12] amen they went through much worse things
[30:14] look at their attitude amen they counted
[30:15] it a joy because of many of them had
[30:18] watched physically watched Jesus suffer
[30:21] and die on a cross for them and we just
[30:24] have to put into perspective sometimes
[30:27] how blessed we are are you know in the
[30:28] family that you're in in the word that
[30:30] you hear in the message you've been
[30:31] brought and don't don't let yourselves
[30:34] become uh and I thought about myself on
[30:36] this because it can happen to any of us
[30:37] don't let yourself become this spiritual
[30:39] pessimist where you're always focused on
[30:42] your hardships or your pains or your
[30:43] mind battles of the negatives amen the
