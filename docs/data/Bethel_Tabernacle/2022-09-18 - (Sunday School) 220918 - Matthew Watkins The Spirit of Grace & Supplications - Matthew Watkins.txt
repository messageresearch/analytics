TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if you have your Bible we'll just read straight from the scripture amen here this morning Zechariah Chapter 12 I don't hear myself at all up here like I'm not on by the Brad not sure if the monitors are down that's on good praise the Lord Zechariah Chapter 12 I'd like to just teach this morning and we took a little bit when we preached Wednesday and I just took a little snippet out of that didn't really get to cover my materials so lord gave me this chance this morning so today will just be a Bible teaching and I just pray you get something out of it I want to title this teaching the spirit of Grace and supplications the spirit of Grace and supplications let's just begin reading at verse two we'll just read a few verses then we'll turn to chapter 14. behold I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about when they shall be in The Siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem and in that day while I make Jerusalem a burden some stone for all people notice everybody this is God's saying I'm going to do this there's many things Israel's done to bring upon themself but God says I'm going to do this the Holocaust God did that I need you to understand that that's so important it's it's it opens the door to everything that happens in the second phase of what we're reading about now with Israel the Holocaust was something God did now that's trouble for your mind for the Christian mind and the non-Christian mind to say that God brought up brought about the Holocaust is hard for us to understand and we know a prophet would go further than that and say that was the tender loving hand of Jehovah now you read that what God is saying here this is something I'm going to do if you go read the book of Deuteronomy you'll find uh profitic things even about the Holocaust and if you want to want that reference I'll give it to you after the teaching but we're not looking at that we're looking at this this is this is part two this is the you could almost call this the second Holocaust that's my own that's brother Matt you don't have to accept that Bible doesn't say that brother Branham doesn't say that but if you read about what God is saying is going to come upon Jerusalem it's not a bright sunny picture it's a very dark one now it's a dark one that gets dark but at the darkest moment it turns to light because the Bible says then God will come himself and defend Jerusalem but before it gets light it gets really really really dark now that should show you something about your future as well that at the darkest moment when all seems like everything is lost then God steps in the scene can you say Amen let's read here verse verse uh three again and I will make them a burdensome stone for all people all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces through all the people of the earth be gathered together against it you can be seated this morning let's just begin continue reading that verse eight let's just continue on here we'll get to what we can and then we'll move to part two Lord willing next time verse 8 in that day shall the Lord shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem and he that is feeble among them shall be as David he that shall be feeble among them shall be as David and the House of David shall be as God as the angel of the Lord from before them I want to point out one important thing when you're reading this and just make sure you're right with me here this morning because we're going to go really fast through this book of Zechariah and teach on it just a little bit and I want to get to something Lord willing at the end before we uh before we conclude what's incredible is that God is going to pour out notice this here in verse 8 let's read it again and that day shall the Lord defend all the inhabitants of Jerusalem and he that is feeble among them thank you shall be as David and and the House of David shall be his God as the angel of the Lord from before them you could imagine and I can't imagine as I was reading this this morning I cannot imagine for myself the agony or the PTSD that a Jew would feel when all the nations of the earth surround the entire and Encompass the entire city and now you have a military army United Nations military army a foreign army coming and taking them and plundering their city and there's the Bible speaks of rape and murder and it doesn't actually speak about a lot of death it's incredible I don't I don't know that the Bible ever mentions loss of life but you imagine the PTSD that's going to come upon the Jew who lives and it's in their DNA the Holocaust that they went through and now it looks like it's going to happen all over again let's read Zechariah Chapter 14 and we'll jump back so hold your Bible there in verse in chapter 12 and look at 14 verse 2 for I will gather all nations against jacarai 14 brother Jeremiah two chapters over verse two for I will gather I'll wait for him to get that I want to make sure we have it Zechariah Chapter 14. for I will gather all nations this is God remember you got to keep this in your mind this is not a man this is not Biden this is not Trump this is not Putin make sure you you carefully understand modern events that are made clear by prophecy don't look at it as men doing this this is God doing this this is an anointing that comes upon people and so he says I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle and the city shall be taken and the house is rifled and the women ravished and half of the city shall go forth into captivity and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city then shall the Lord go forth and fight against those Nations so what is it it's a trap God literally brings all the nations of the Earth against her to get them to one spot so he can judge them and this time it won't be coveted this time it won't be a plague this time it won't be a disease this time it'll be the Lord himself Mighty in battle I want to make sure I'm on his side and not against him he says then the Lord shall go forth and fight against those Nations as when he fought in the day of battle and his feet shall stand up shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives which is before Jerusalem on the East let's move on down now turn back over to Zechariah Chapter 12 and let's begin reading there again notice in that Day verse 8 Zechariah 12 shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem and he that is feeble among them shall be as David in the House of David shall be his God or the angel over for them and shall come to pass that I will seek notice and it shall come to pass in that day that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem so this is the Day of Reckoning this is the final Day of Reckoning for all of the years for all of the Nations that came against Israel for all of the destruction and all of the all of the scheming and all of the planning and God says I'm going to bring you all to Jerusalem now what's incredible to me and this is just again me inserting my own thinking here it's incredible that the Bible says that the Lord shall defend notice verse 8 the inhabitants of say it with me not all Israel the Bible says half will be destroyed that's what the Bible says in so much that half of them so he says I'll defend not Israel remember not all Israel is Israel so there's an there's an entire family of God that God has but and God has a special love for that entire family the mystical Body of Christ but then there's a little elected group that has a special place and a special privilege and special benefits because they are his now here are a few amens the rest of you all believe that aren't you glad to be on that side and he says I notice this here it's only for Jerusalem and the House of David so this is a spec this is a special promise to a group not all but to a group are you seeing yourself and he says and he says here in verse verse 10 and I will pour upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and supplications and they shall look upon me who they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn I can't imagine when they realize we were wrong in that day shall there be great Mourning so you notice here the Bible says I'll pour out the spirit of Grace the spirit of grace and the spirit of supplications why would God if he could pour out any spirit that he wanted to but he was going to give them what they needed the most to have victory in this final day in this climax in this Crescendo moment and God says in this great final climax in this great Crescendo I'm going to give them something that they need the most give us the spirit of Courage know that he could have given them that but he didn't give them the spirit of War he could have given that but he didn't give him the spirit of anointing and power but he didn't give them that he gave him the greatest thing that they would need to get Victory and that was the spirit of Grace why Grace well let's just break down those two words what does grace mean you should know that it's unmerited favor he didn't do anything to deserve it but I'm going to give you Grace so God could have poured out any Spirit but these were the two things that this people needed more than anything they needed Grace now don't look so far off to Israel and go yeah boy that stiff-necked rebellious they are that stiff-necked rebellious hardened hard-headed people they need Grace you should also see yourself in the mirror and realize that what God does for Israel he also does to his family the elected bread that more than anything God could pour out would be rapturing Grace and so we're going to look at that here this morning the spirit of Grace and so they would need this and the spirit of supplications now that word means prayers the spirit of prayers but to say it more perfectly it's not just the spirit of prayer but it's desperation it's desperate prayer God says at that day I will pour out the spirit of Grace and desperate supplications let's keep reading here in verse 12. he says and I will pour out verse 10 of chapter 12 Zechariah and I will pour out upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is now it's incredible when you study this book of Zechariah and I got 10 44 so I don't have a lot of time let me just see if I want to go straight to the PowerPoint yes bring up the PowerPoint for me brother Jeremiah if you could it'd be great uh Spirit of Grace and supplications you can go ahead and just display that we're just going to read some things that brother Branham had to say on this here Spirit of Grace and supplication of Jesus Christ whatever it is maybe I can control it here this morning this is the revelation of Jesus Christ this Gentile message as the Jews brought it to the Gentiles the Gentiles will take it right back to the Jews again and the Rapture will come now he will pour out upon thou clip just a little tiny section if you go back and read this now he will pour out upon the house of Israel what the same Holy Spirit so what are the Jews going to receive Jerusalem had an outpouring of the Holy Ghost in the upper room in the book of Acts and they'll have it a second time too but this time it'll be to the Jews and he says he will pour out upon the house of Israel the same Holy Spirit see after now that's important after the Gentile church is gone so if you watch that happen you've missed it if you watch that spirit that Holy Spirit pour out upon Israel and they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know you've missed it notice and not only will it be a mournful time for the Jews who rejected him notice it's going to be we just read about it oh my boy could you imagine those Jews as they in their mind they begin to realize that was so wrong they look on him who they pierced well brother Branham says that's not the only one who's going to be who's going to be weeping but there's going to be another group who are not only weeping but they're gnashing their teeth it will be a Marvel time for the Jews as Messiah it will be immortal for them he says that not only will it be a mournful time for the Jews who rejected them as a messiah but it'll be a mournful time for them left Gentiles back here who has accepted notice who has rejected him as their Messiah of this day they'll be welling and weeping the sleeping virgin will be welling that's the church that refused to get oil in its light who is that group of people that's not a church that's not a church down the road that's not a church over here that you passed on your way to church this morning don't think like that that's any individual that refuse to get the light of their day the oil of the Holy Ghost into their vessel I read that and say Lord let me make sure I have the oil in my vessel you pray that same thing so I pray tonight father that you'll wake up somebody to the knowledge to know that unless they're born you say brother Matt what is rapturing Grace if God's going to pour out the spirit of rapture and Grace upon people then what is our Rapture in Grace oh that sounds like some Hocus Pocus God's just gonna poof and what has come to church and I'll have all of the my habits and I'll just live any old way then all of a sudden boom it's Grace no listen now now that's how you could think of it in your mind say oh Rapture and Grace I'm thankful for Rapture and Grace but listen to what brother random calls Rapture in Grace I pray tonight father that you wake up somebody to the knowledge to know that unless they're born again of the spirit of God has received and then become Abraham's seed that they'll never be able to make the rapture so I pray father that you'll give Rapture and Grace tonight what is your rapture in Grace it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost say is that all it is I don't I'm not professing to know I don't know but I know that brother Brandon says that you'll never make the Rapture without this listen to Jehovah Jireh now we have seen all kinds of great moves and shouting and praising God all fine now this is again on Rapture and Grace he says we've seen all kinds all kinds of moves and shouting and praising God we've spoken tongues and prophesied in all we've seen all of that that's fine now this is an important statement that comes right along with it now many people want to read this next quote and go see that's over here and then this is over here but remember how we preached to brother Brandon says the bride walks right in the middle of the road she doesn't leave anything off she doesn't cut anything out you don't cut one thing out to receive something else but God says I'm going to keep adding to your faith and adding to your virtue and adding to you doesn't say I'll take one remove it and I'll I'll give you this I'll take Faith away and give you knowledge and I'll take knowledge and give you virtue but he says he's going to build it it's going to add it's going to be a restoration he's going to give everything back the the everything of the your original inheritance notice what he says that comes right along with it but remember we've now remember we've had all kinds of moves and shouted and praising spoken tongues prophesied we've seen all of that so he's pointing to that Pentecostal church that restoration of gifts who had received all of that right and he says but remember the last thing is his divine presence the last thing is his his not the gift but the giver himself the last thing is his divine presence the word itself the word itself he is the word the head the word it's coming to the body now don't let that become a cliche oh it's the word what is the word it's himself coming to the body notice what brother Brandon would make this distinction because brother animal would say you can't have all the gifts and prophesying and speaking in tongues and then reject the word they love the Miracles that that was performed in brother random's Ministry but they rejected the word and they missed it all now notice he says but remember the last thing is his divine presence the head the word it's coming to the body now it's not some man here notice this quote it's not some man here is the messiah it's not some man here that's the Messiah it's the holy spirit is the Messiah Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same thing so here it is now just working in the flesh getting the body ready for the Rapture in Grace and he says this believe it friends Amen brother Brandon the working see say what does that even mean brother Matt so what you were witnessing in the ministry of God's Prophet was the Messiah In the Flesh operating in the flesh and what was that to do raise up a man and exalt him and put his put you know lift lift up a man was that what it was to do it was to give you Rapture and Grace but I pray that you'll give this is my favorite quote here I've got in my entire repertoire my my entire Arsenal I have I about went to the stratosphere when I read this quote but I pray this is the countdown 1964 but I pray that you'll give them such a crave for it Lord how many want that you'll give them such a crave for it Lord that they'll come and see we're at the end time the astronaut age not the horse and buggy no not the vehicle not the car not the automobile age no there was an age for that but we've moved past the horse and buggy we've moved past the the automobile age past the jet or does that the jet aircraft age we've moved past the jet aircraft now it's the astronaut age he says I pray that we're at the end time the astronaut age remember what he says this correlates directly with the quote we just read we've had all the gifts and signs and tongues and prophesied but now it's him the presence of him himself so does that mean now we've moved away from all the gifts and prophesied in tongues and now we have the word no it's all of it together you can't have one without the other and he says it's a now what is it it's not just the gifts and prophesying in tongues and healing of the body that's wonderful that goes with it but now you're going to need something greater than to heal your body to come up here in a prayer line and heal you of cancer if you got cancer or tuberculosis or a headache God can do all of that can you say Amen but you're going to need something greater than a power to change your headache you're going to need the power to change your body notice he says they'll pray that it'll be an Astron at the end time I pray father that they'll realize it isn't trying to condemn what they had it's only trying to give them more it's not trying to condemn what they had it's only trying to give them more I'm preaching this morning I should be teaching let me stay right here he says it's not time to condemn them for what they had it's to give them more rapturing Grace for the hour will come when we'll have to have Rapture power not only to heal the body but to change it in a moment in a twinkling of an eye Christ will be so real into their bodies till he can change it so if he's not becoming more and more real now how will you ever get here Lord make yourself more real more real more real his notice by his great death and what he had purchased may they take this today that token that the holy ghost that I spoke of last night hold it before them and walk into this astronaut that could be preached in a sermon series walk in this astronaut where visions powers and worlds Beyond known and oh God where all the great mysteries of God is unfolded in those Seven Seals and made known to man granite father is that your prayer so we're out of time this morning but I just want to read these last because notice what brother Branham says here about that so you say brother Matt how's that typing because everything what happens in natural Israel type spiritual Israel so what happens with the Jews happens to God's what happens to God's elected family to Benjamin also happens to the Gentile elected family of God so as much as the darkest hour would would come before day but as much as The Darkest Day for Israel comes before the brightest day so the darkest day is happening right now in 2022 and that's what battle you're in this morning but before the darkness notice here Jesus what is what is the Psalms 27 what does brother random use when he preaches the Rapture as a scripture in the day of trouble this is the Rapture song but in the day of trouble then I will hide him in the cleft of The Rock and the secret of my Tabernacle so the darkest day comes but the greatest day awaits he says here it'd be so real notice what he says one of these days the message will go to Israel and what a break for God will send unto them Moses and Elijah in Revelations 11 and they'll do signs and wonders and Jehovah's sign while the Gentiles is finished the grace day of Grace will leave the Gentile Church the Pentecostal age will leave the denominations will continue on because they come up here with the sleeping virgin we'll go into that just a moment but they'll come up in that class he's speaking of the foolish and the wise but then when they do when they do that the Jews will receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and there will be a Revival there that'll stop the heavens and the days of don't reign they'll do all kinds of signs and miracles and finally the Roman uses brother random speaking of that day of Zechariah that we just read about in Zechariah 12 and 14. this is prophetic this is future there will come a message that will come the same message will go back to the Jews say what happens next this is what happens next and a Revival will break out and they'll do signs and miracles and wonders and finally the Roman hierarchy the Jews has the wealth of the world and so the Roman Catholic Church will break the cup break his agreement with the Jews after this thing is over and then the treaty that they got signed between them he'll go down there and thens when God will stand like he did in the old days there and fight for Israel they'll finally kill these two Prophets and they'll lay in the street and spit on them and when they do that that's Moses and Elijah and when they do that after three days lay in dead the spirit of life I love reading this so much because it's like I'm reading the novel at the very end of the book and the climax of it all this is what happens at the end and then there's the very end is and they lived happily ever after but here's what happens right before that and he says though he says when they do that after three days laying dead the spirit of life will come into those two prophets and they'll raise up and Ascend into glory and about that time the fireworks starts then about that time the fireworks starts that's the end time that's when she's over let's all stand to our feet I've went over time the spirit of Grace and supplication how many would raise a hand and say Lord I need it this morning Lord we do we raise our hands father in a body in unity Lord how much we need this for our daily lives Lord we thank you for this teaching this morning we pray that it would encourage us Lord May and break an enticement of our appetite Lord to read your word to see where we're at to see where we're living don't let us get so stuck and caught up and distracted by this normal life of Lord what we live every day is humans let us realize Lord that we're supernatural beings and there's a story that's been written about us and we find our part Lord bless the song service the worship Lord everything that's done today May It Be For Your Glory we ask it in Jesus name amen foreign
