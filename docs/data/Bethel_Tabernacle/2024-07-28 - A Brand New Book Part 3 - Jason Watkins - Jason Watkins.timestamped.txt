[37:27] afterwards it's so thrilling to know
[37:30] what the the treasures that lie in the
[37:32] word of God brother brandham said one
[37:34] day he was in his prayer study he said
[37:37] he he got up and he was walking around
[37:39] his chair he laid his chair his Bible
[37:41] down on his chair and he was walking
[37:42] around at praying and he said as I
[37:44] walked by he said I looked down and he
[37:46] said I thought my goodness he said in
[37:49] that book are the are the is eternal
[37:52] life eternal life for whoever would
[37:54] accept it and that grand my praise the
[37:58] Lord Revelation chap
[38:00] 22 we're only going to read one verse in
[38:03] verse six we'll let you be seated and
[38:05] then we'll continue reading after you
[38:07] are seated hey let me make a quick
[38:10] announcement concerning next Sunday
[38:14] um there's been a little kind of a
[38:16] backdoor thing going on that no one knew
[38:19] about very few people knew about it and
[38:22] uh there's only been two uh people who
[38:25] have actually seen the finished product
[38:27] that's brother Bradley Campbell and I
[38:30] and uh brother Bradley came to me some
[38:32] months ago with one of the best ideas
[38:34] I've heard for fundraising for you know
[38:38] for any kind of a project whether it's
[38:40] church building or missions or anything
[38:42] like that it's just a generally a great
[38:45] idea super simple in its concept but I
[38:48] thought my goodness that that is
[38:50] profound and and then he had a second
[38:53] idea and I thought that the second idea
[38:56] was equal to the first idea idea and so
[38:59] we've been
[39:00] preparing um a surprise for you as an
[39:03] assembly and you're not going to get to
[39:06] see it till next Sunday so make your
[39:09] plans to be here amen and so we're going
[39:12] to take next Sunday and uh get with all
[39:15] of the team members and get all of the
[39:17] information thoroughly uh collated and
[39:20] give you a a thorough in-depth update
[39:23] talk about what we're doing talk about
[39:25] what's going on talk about the finances
[39:26] of it amen and so we'll uh we'll
[39:29] incorporate it all into the ministry of
[39:31] the word because that's the main reason
[39:33] we come to church amen but that'll be
[39:36] next Sunday the Lord willing and um as I
[39:39] said if the I've said if the Rapture
[39:41] comes we don't need to worry about it
[39:43] but otherwise we'll be here next Sunday
[39:45] to bring you up to speed on that
[39:47] Revelation chapter
[39:49] 22 and verse
[39:53] six and he said unto me these sayings
[39:56] are faithful and true this was
[40:01] actually he said to me these sayings are
[40:04] faithful and true and the Lord God of
[40:06] the Holy prophets sent his Angel to show
[40:10] unto his servants the things which must
[40:14] shortly be done amen let's pray
[40:18] Master we thank you for your presence
[40:21] here today we thank you for this
[40:23] audience of people who have come out to
[40:25] hear your word for those Lord streaming
[40:28] across the airwaves pray your blessing
[40:30] on them Lord I think about not only your
[40:32] ministry team members uh deployed
[40:35] ministering your gospel but there's
[40:37] other family other whole families Lord
[40:39] on vacation I think of Jonathan and
[40:42] Martha their children and Chris and
[40:44] Katie along and brother Tony and sister
[40:46] Amber and the different ones Lord who
[40:48] who are that I know of who are away
[40:50] today I pray your great blessing would
[40:53] be upon them as well and I'm sure there
[40:56] perhaps are other Lord may you grant
[40:58] your great grace upon their lives in
[41:00] Jesus name amen God bless you friends
[41:03] you can be
[41:05] seated Amen brother Mark Let's uh pick
[41:07] up from verse
[41:12] seven today we are continuing in our
[41:15] third installment brother Gideon told me
[41:17] today he winked at me he Saidi he said
[41:19] I'm predicting nine Parts I'm like get
[41:22] in I don't think so but I've said that
[41:25] before I've been mistaken a couple times
[41:27] in my life
[41:29] so so verse seven behold I come quickly
[41:34] blessed is he that keepeth the sayings
[41:36] of the prophecy of this book and I John
[41:40] saw these things and heard them and when
[41:43] I had heard and seen I fell down to
[41:46] worship before the feet of the Angel
[41:48] which showed me these
[41:51] things then saith he unto me see thou do
[41:54] it not for I am thy fellow servant and
[41:58] of thy Brethren the prophets and of them
[42:02] which keep the sayings of this
[42:05] book
[42:07] um keep the sayings of this book for the
[42:10] time is at
[42:11] hand he that is just is unjust let him
[42:16] be he that is unjust let him be unjust
[42:19] still and he which is filthy let him be
[42:22] filthy still and he that is righteous
[42:25] let him be righteous still still and he
[42:28] that is Holy let him be holy still and
[42:31] behold I come quickly and my reward is
[42:35] with me to give every man according as
[42:38] his work shall be I am Alpha and Omega
[42:42] the beginning and the end the first and
[42:46] the last blessed are they that do his
[42:49] Commandments that they may have right to
[42:51] the tree of life and may enter in
[42:54] through the gates into the city
[42:57] for without are dogs and Sorcerers and
[43:00] whoremongers and murderers and idolators
[43:03] and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie
[43:06] could you imagine loving a lie I Jesus
[43:09] have sent mine Angel to testify unto you
[43:13] these things in the churches I am the
[43:15] root and The Offspring of David and the
[43:18] bright and morning star and the spirit
[43:21] and the bride say come and let him that
[43:25] heareth say come and let let him that is
[43:27] a thirst come and whosoever will let him
[43:31] take the Water of Life freely for I
[43:34] testify unto every man that heareth the
[43:37] words of the prophecy of this book If
[43:40] any man shall add unto these things God
[43:43] shall add unto him the plagues that are
[43:45] written in this book and if any man
[43:48] shall take away from the words of the
[43:51] book of this prophecy God shall take
[43:54] away his part out of the book of life
[43:56] and out of of the holy city and from the
[43:59] things which are written in this book he
[44:02] which testifieth these things saith
[44:05] surely I come quickly even so come Lord
[44:09] Jesus verse 21 the grace of our Lord
[44:13] Jesus Christ be with you all amen can
[44:17] you say Amen to the reading of the
[44:19] word so it's it's vitally important that
[44:24] we have all of the word of God and that
[44:28] we don't have anything that's not of the
[44:31] word of God and that we don't leave
[44:34] anything off that is of the word of God
[44:37] I'm glad today not only that when God
[44:41] required of the age to bring them to
[44:44] Perfection to take a church in a body
[44:46] change he required a faith in the word
[44:51] and the word only meaning no man-made
[44:55] Theory no uh no um mix no ad mixture the
[45:01] pure word and the unadulterated uncut
[45:05] unchanged unaltered Original Seed word
[45:08] of God and that word only now it's one
[45:12] thing for God to require that but what
[45:15] what would it be and what would we face
[45:18] today if he required it and he didn't
[45:20] give us access to it so now today I'm
[45:24] glad that he required it because I don't
[45:27] want to be in heaven debating
[45:30] 33,000 different iterations of
[45:34] Christianity I don't want to have 33,000
[45:37] different denominations north of
[45:40] 33,000 in heaven to contend with and
[45:43] we're still over there contending with
[45:46] what's right what's wrong I'm glad that
[45:48] he's going to settle the matter at the
[45:51] end time and he's going to restore the
[45:54] Original Seed which was always the true
[45:58] word and and but not only am I glad that
[46:02] that's the requirement I'm glad that he
[46:04] gave us access to the revealed word and
[46:09] he invites whomsoever will to believe it
[46:12] now he doesn't say who
[46:14] will like John 3:16 whosoever whosoever
[46:19] will but it doesn't say who who will in
[46:22] fact is John 3:16 here we read the book
[46:25] of Revelations it doesn't even suggest
[46:28] anyone will it's just that whoever does
[46:32] and this is going to be your reward and
[46:34] so in order to find out whosoever will
[46:36] do it who's that going to be who's going
[46:39] to believe then you have to go into the
[46:42] book of Acts and the Bible says as many
[46:44] as were ordained believed so I'm glad to
[46:48] know that this isn't a dice roll this
[46:51] isn't a chance this is definitive this
[46:55] is certain we have believed the report
[46:59] heaven is real Christ is real the word
[47:02] is real and we're going in a real
[47:05] Rapture and a real body change to a real
[47:07] land and live in a real
[47:12] City brother Brandon and I'll have maybe
[47:15] a little more to say on that as I
[47:17] go brother Brandon back to our sermon on
[47:21] the future
[47:22] home brother brandham says in Titus 3:5
[47:25] Paul is using this same word that means
[47:29] regeneration of men now he's using the
[47:31] word the the Greek word that Peter used
[47:33] about heavens and earth passing away and
[47:35] brother bandam has already explained it
[47:36] doesn't mean annihilated it just means
[47:38] it's it's a regeneration so he says he
[47:42] the he Paul is using the same word means
[47:44] regeneration of man that man has passed
[47:47] from a sinner to a saint not completely
[47:49] annihilated we've been dealing with that
[47:51] I'm glad that he didn't destroy me I'm
[47:54] glad when I have failures he doesn't
[47:56] annihilate me I'm glad he's annihilating
[47:59] everything from me that's not
[48:02] him and I just say annihilate Lord
[48:04] because when when it's all said and done
[48:06] I'll be left standing purely him see so
[48:10] he says when a man is changed he isn't
[48:12] annihilated but he's a changed person
[48:15] that's the basic tenant of
[48:18] Christianity so I'm sorry that people
[48:20] think they can be a Christian and not
[48:23] change anything see or at best they
[48:26] change their they start going to church
[48:28] or they start singing gospel songs but
[48:30] it's it's more change than that you've
[48:33] actually got to be a changed
[48:35] person not just change your habits
[48:38] sanctification will do that to you
[48:40] brother BR says it'll make you stop your
[48:42] lying and cheating it'll make you start
[48:44] going to church but that's not born
[48:46] again necessarily it leads to a new
[48:48] birth see all
[48:50] right so he says the man when a man is
[48:53] changed he isn't annihilated he's
[48:55] changed a changed person he's been
[48:57] changed from what he was to what he is
[49:00] not annihilated Jesus used the same word
[49:02] in Matthew 19 now I didn't put these on
[49:04] the screen on purpose because I I want
[49:06] to make a quite a bit of comment as we
[49:08] go I'm just going to read short excerpts
[49:10] and then make my comments so he says
[49:13] Jesus used the same word in Matthew
[49:15] 19:28 now he's not referring to the
[49:17] baptism of 2819 this is
[49:20] 1928 he says you'll set with me in my
[49:23] father's Kingdom regenerated you see
[49:26] changed
[49:27] so he says when you're changed he used
[49:29] the same word he used the same word when
[49:32] he said to the cult loose him and let
[49:35] him go said the same thing at the
[49:37] resurrection of Lazarus loose him change
[49:40] him he's been tied let him go so he says
[49:44] what does it mean the Earth will be
[49:46] loosed from the grip of Satan it'll be
[49:49] loosed it'll be loosed from politics
[49:52] it'll be loosed from denominational
[49:54] religious systems to be used for the the
[49:56] kingdom of God so the Earth is going to
[49:59] be repurposed it's not going to be used
[50:02] anymore for crooked politics or crooked
[50:04] entertainment and it's not going to have
[50:06] a people who are still tied to their old
[50:09] life it you're going to be new you're
[50:11] going to be
[50:13] changed you're going to be loosed just
[50:16] like the Earth is loosed from the grip
[50:18] of Satan you're going to be loosed
[50:20] you're going to live in a land and live
[50:22] in a body that cannot be tempted
[50:24] Hallelujah
[50:28] so he says it'll be loose and and used
[50:30] for the kingdom of God to establish it
[50:32] here on Earth and notice now he goes to
[50:34] the seven sabbaths so notice after 50
[50:37] days or seven sabath sabbaths from there
[50:41] again there come another holy
[50:43] convocation so this is why he's
[50:45] explained that it was you know on the
[50:48] 50th day the Holy Ghost fell in the
[50:51] upper room see and so so after 49 days
[50:55] it comes on the 50th day and that's why
[50:58] it's called Pentecost because that's the
[50:59] Old Testament Feast that's the name of
[51:01] it the Pentecost feast and it's on it's
[51:04] it's after 50 days so brother brandham
[51:06] is showing that now that is at the end
[51:09] of seven sabbaths it's the baptism of
[51:12] the Holy Ghost it's the Eternal day now
[51:15] your soul is in an eternal day amen see
[51:18] so you've got three elements that have
[51:20] to be brought to their Eighth Day or
[51:22] back to the first day the original day
[51:24] the Eternal day and the first one has to
[51:27] be your soul Born Again of the spirit of
[51:30] God you're sitting together in Heavenly
[51:31] places in Christ Jesus you can never
[51:34] pass from there once you're
[51:37] there the second thing that had to come
[51:39] to its eighth day was the word of God it
[51:41] had to go beyond man-made manage
[51:44] thinking and it had to the book of
[51:46] redemption had to be open the mystery of
[51:49] redemption that the world has no access
[51:51] to see I want to get ahead of myself but
[51:54] we find that when the seals are open
[51:56] then the word comes to its eighth day
[51:59] but the Earth even in the Millennium the
[52:01] Earth is still in its seventh day and so
[52:03] it has to have a holy fire just like you
[52:06] had to have a holy fire just like this
[52:08] came through a holy fire it came by the
[52:11] pillar of fire and that's what's living
[52:13] inside of you and that's the new city
[52:16] that's where that city has been
[52:19] built so it's not just the millennial
[52:22] Earth which can't go
[52:24] on uh in in the seventh day see because
[52:27] it would it would never see God dwelling
[52:30] himself among his people he would always
[52:33] be uh limited to an office so he says
[52:36] here now so the Earth will be loosed so
[52:40] after 50 or seven sabbaths from there
[52:44] again there come another holy
[52:46] convocation what happened the Holy Ghost
[52:49] fell on the day of Pentecost so that's a
[52:51] holy convocation that's an eighth day
[52:53] that's an original day that's an eternal
[52:55] day that's why it can never be changed
[52:58] what Peter said can never be
[53:01] altered repent and be baptized in the
[53:03] name of the Lord Jesus Christ that can't
[53:06] be altered you can't Sid step and step
[53:09] around that that's part of the Holy
[53:11] convocation that's that's part of the
[53:13] mystery of redemption that was laid out
[53:16] see all right so he says on the eth day
[53:19] fell on the eighth day was seven
[53:21] sabbaths later exactly after his
[53:24] resurrection so it'd be seven time 7
[53:26] again that's 49 bring it right back
[53:29] around to the first day of the week
[53:31] again exactly see so it's Eternal now
[53:35] just as your soul is eternal and and so
[53:40] now in the realm of the real
[53:44] you time is no longer
[53:48] counted now that's that should in your
[53:51] thinking if the real you is in eternity
[53:54] and time is no longer Counting Ed then
[53:57] that's why things that still happen in
[54:00] your life in this flesh in time can't be
[54:03] counted against you because this is in
[54:06] one realm and that's in another realm
[54:08] see so the real you you we we say all
[54:12] the time the real you didn't do it the
[54:14] real you has already passed into that
[54:17] realm is already sitting together in
[54:20] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we do
[54:23] make mistakes John said we will but we
[54:25] have an with the father see he the the
[54:30] the virgin of you that's born of God do
[54:32] not commit sin he cannot he cannot it's
[54:35] impossible because he's already his seed
[54:38] remaineth in him and that's already
[54:40] transitioned you it's already loosed you
[54:43] it's already cha changed you you're
[54:44] loosed from the law of sin and death you
[54:47] are not any longer under the law of sin
[54:51] and death you are above the law you
[54:53] cannot be charged with a crime against
[54:56] the law because you're above the law
[54:59] see so brother brandham said so there is
[55:04] your holy convocation not have anything
[55:07] to do with literal things see so there
[55:10] are plenty of literal things that happen
[55:12] in our lives but the bride must
[55:15] understand her position in Christ so
[55:17] that she can come to a perfect faith and
[55:20] say it's not based on me it's based on
[55:23] him whom I have faith in and that's and
[55:26] that faith brother Brenham said that's
[55:28] the kind of relationship that is going
[55:29] to bring the dead Saints for hundreds of
[55:32] years out of the
[55:35] ground so so he says it's beyond that
[55:40] it's into the kingdom of God with
[55:41] eternal life with the predestinated that
[55:43] never did start it never started on any
[55:46] day you wasn't saved on any day now
[55:49] you're this is
[55:51] real Redemption mystery
[55:54] teaching this is what brother Jason
[55:56] talking about this in the back room this
[55:57] is what the world doesn't have access to
[55:59] all right let me let me read on before I
[56:01] make those
[56:01] comments so he says it was predestinated
[56:05] never did start it never started on a
[56:07] day you wasn't saved on a day so so my
[56:13] you say but you made a mistake yesterday
[56:16] I'm not judged in days I didn't start on
[56:20] a day it's it's it's the devil can point
[56:23] to he can point to yesterday and last
[56:26] last week day and last year day and 20
[56:28] years ago Day none of that counts why
[56:31] because I have passed from days and
[56:34] weeks and months I'm in
[56:38] eternity so he says you always you were
[56:41] you was always saved Jesus just come to
[56:44] redeem that but you was saved from the
[56:47] beginning
[56:50] because you had eternal life to begin
[56:54] with amen
[56:57] amen so there's no such a thing as
[56:59] spiritual death now to the baptized
[57:01] saint of God just like all now watch him
[57:04] compare it again see I've been showing
[57:06] you the the comparison between the bride
[57:07] and that and that City just like all the
[57:10] curse is gone when the Holy Spirit
[57:12] accepts you you don't accept it it
[57:14] accepts you did you know that Jesus said
[57:17] that to his disciples you haven't chosen
[57:18] me actually I've chosen you see so you
[57:22] you don't accept it it accepts you cuz
[57:25] it's God's attribute
[57:26] see if if it's the holy ghost means
[57:30] God's spirit and it's the attribute the
[57:32] thought of God he accepted you because
[57:34] that you were ordained for that purpose
[57:36] yet you was born in
[57:39] sin come
[57:41] on that's right born in sin it's like
[57:45] everybody else Paul taught us that see
[57:48] because but he say he says so the
[57:50] thought of God has accepted you because
[57:52] that you were ordained for that purpose
[57:54] yet you was born in sin
[57:56] but God had that attribute and here you
[58:00] expressed yourself on Earth and he comes
[58:02] down and gets you you're back here he's
[58:05] talking about you know the that he's
[58:06] Drew he's drew it on the board of a
[58:08] human heart that's been that's been
[58:10] filled with the Holy Spirit and another
[58:12] one that's not and he says but here's
[58:14] where you started in this Pure Clean
[58:16] Place yeah you were born in sin you were
[58:18] over here but he came down and got you
[58:21] Hallelujah he came down and got me he
[58:23] came down and got you and he took you
[58:25] from there to hear and now you can't
[58:27] ever leave here see so this is the
[58:30] position you are and the whole thing is
[58:33] based on an attribute of God you he says
[58:36] he comes down to get you now you're back
[58:38] here here is where you belong can I say
[58:41] that to you today in spite of the devil
[58:44] brow beating you with unworthiness here
[58:47] is where you belong
[58:49] am Shalom bride good morning breathe the
[58:55] peace of God be upon you here's where
[58:58] you belong I know we all went away in a
[59:01] certain way but here's where you
[59:03] belong why did you come here cuz you
[59:05] didn't stay there why didn't you stay
[59:07] there cuz it was none fulfilling this
[59:09] gives you
[59:11] purpose
[59:14] Hallelujah so he goes on he says he so
[59:17] he comes down to get you see now you're
[59:19] back here where you belong sin has lost
[59:21] its power now it's still anointing our
[59:23] flesh but it has no power on my desires
[59:25] anymore
[59:26] there's there's desires than lust that
[59:28] come through the flesh but inside my
[59:31] heart I don't want that life and that's
[59:34] the desire God is looking at I don't
[59:36] want that life and brother B said it's
[59:38] what God looks in your heart at what you
[59:40] want to
[59:42] be I want to be like
[59:46] him see this is part of the Redemption
[59:48] mystery all right sin has lost its power
[59:53] the desire of sin has done gone from
[59:56] your heart when the Holy Spirit comes in
[59:59] you are a restored
[1:00:02] person so so so this is part of the
[1:00:06] mystery of redemption that takes the
[1:00:09] ministry of the son of man and a prophet
[1:00:12] to reveal the the world has all the way
[1:00:17] up through the man age the world has
[1:00:20] General access to the tenants of the
[1:00:23] word of God and the tenants of
[1:00:24] Christianity the world has that they
[1:00:27] they can read the the life stories of
[1:00:29] the Old Testament prophets and they can
[1:00:31] glean they can read the gospels and hear
[1:00:34] the tales of Jesus they can read Sermon
[1:00:36] on the Mount they can go through Peter's
[1:00:38] books and John's and Paul's and all of
[1:00:39] these different ones and and the Book of
[1:00:41] James and Jude and they and they can
[1:00:43] glean uh uh you know parts of this that
[1:00:47] give a a good life make you ex can make
[1:00:50] you give God uh um uh give put put you
[1:00:54] in the presence of God to where
[1:00:56] God can bless you and can favor your
[1:00:58] life but the but the parts of the book
[1:01:03] of The Mystery of redemption are not
[1:01:06] accessible right those are the parts
[1:01:09] they have no ACC that we say all the
[1:01:10] time it's a closed book we're not
[1:01:12] meaning the general tenants that the
[1:01:14] Bible teaches you can clean a lot by the
[1:01:17] children of Israel to the children of
[1:01:18] Israel God showed his acts and they
[1:01:20] learned from that but it was to Moses he
[1:01:22] showed his ways you understand and so so
[1:01:26] when you find out when it's like that
[1:01:27] you have the world so when the world
[1:01:29] says we don't need a prophet they don't
[1:01:32] know what they're talking about because
[1:01:35] it's only the ministry of the son of man
[1:01:37] that reveals the mystery of redemption
[1:01:40] and that and the ministry of the son of
[1:01:42] man operates through a prophet you have
[1:01:43] no access to there without a Ministry of
[1:01:45] the son of man see so so there you know
[1:01:49] it has some some some some relevance to
[1:01:52] right living but the mystery of
[1:01:54] redemption requires as brother random
[1:01:56] would show in the church age book it
[1:01:58] it's going to require more than just
[1:02:01] verse by verse comparison by Bible
[1:02:04] students it's going to require prophetic
[1:02:07] Insight amen see so I'm glad we have
[1:02:11] access to prophetic
[1:02:13] Insight I'm glad that I have access to
[1:02:16] the book of to the book of redemption
[1:02:18] that's why you under that's why you have
[1:02:20] access to the mystery of redemption
[1:02:23] because the mystery of red redemption
[1:02:25] was contained in the book of redemption
[1:02:28] and that's what the entire Book of
[1:02:30] Revelation is about it's about God
[1:02:33] redeeming his family and the Earth and
[1:02:35] his people and the kingdom and setting
[1:02:38] up a whole new civilization it's all
[1:02:41] about Redemption and in there was a
[1:02:42] seven sealed book of redemption and
[1:02:45] Christ opened it and gave it to a
[1:02:47] prophet who gave it to the
[1:02:50] people so now you have more access to
[1:02:54] the Mysteries than just common salvation
[1:02:56] from destruction there's a difference
[1:02:59] between salvation from destruction and
[1:03:02] Redemption so that's why when brother
[1:03:04] brandham is making these almost
[1:03:07] unimaginable statements that that God
[1:03:10] has accepted you because you were
[1:03:12] ordained yet you were born in sin but
[1:03:15] you you were an attribute you expressed
[1:03:17] yourself on Earth he come and got you
[1:03:19] now you're back here where you belong
[1:03:20] sin lost its power see and so so this is
[1:03:24] Mysteries under red
[1:03:26] Redemption that you have access to and
[1:03:30] the opportunity to be a believer
[1:03:33] of that
[1:03:35] clear so he goes
[1:03:38] on and then when the earth is restored
[1:03:41] by the same thing there can be no more
[1:03:43] cursing no more storms no more winds no
[1:03:45] more typhoons rather you're reconciled
[1:03:48] man and God is met the new Earth will be
[1:03:51] put on its Eden Beauty again the new
[1:03:53] Earth will be will spread forth her
[1:03:56] after her baptism of fire like the man
[1:03:59] was when he still had all right here
[1:04:02] here's a bulletin from your past like
[1:04:05] the man was when he still had when he
[1:04:08] still had hatred malice and strife in
[1:04:11] him when the fire baptism come it
[1:04:15] cleaned it
[1:04:19] off I mean unless you're sitting here
[1:04:22] today and saying uh still dealing with
[1:04:25] some of that m malice hatred and see he
[1:04:28] says no more
[1:04:30] jealousy no more of nothing it's just
[1:04:34] absolutely a dwelling place for God
[1:04:36] that's his delegation that's going to
[1:04:38] meet him out yonder so you see friends
[1:04:41] the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:04:45] takes hatred malice Strife jealousy just
[1:04:51] like it purges it from the earth it the
[1:04:54] whole purpose of it is to purge it from
[1:04:58] you so just because you can sit here by
[1:05:02] and and understand the word of God and
[1:05:05] even agree with it and even say Amen to
[1:05:07] it does your life say Amen to
[1:05:12] it and when the Holy Fire of God
[1:05:15] sterilizes the Earth with the
[1:05:18] chemicals he Has Lifted his bride which
[1:05:21] can come into heaven with him while this
[1:05:23] is going on you remember Satan compasses
[1:05:26] at the end of the Millennium Satan
[1:05:27] compasses the holy city and the Lord the
[1:05:30] Bible says God takes his family and
[1:05:32] lifts them up on the breath of the earth
[1:05:33] and rains Holy Fire down upon it see so
[1:05:37] he says he lifts you up and then and
[1:05:39] then you're you're in heaven with him
[1:05:42] while this is going on and comes back
[1:05:44] down the Earth again a new heavens and a
[1:05:46] new Earth the cold winter can't hurt it
[1:05:48] the hot summers can't hurt it the
[1:05:49] deserts will Blossom like a rose sin and
[1:05:52] sinners are gone God and His create God
[1:05:55] and his creatures and creation is
[1:05:58] dwelling together in Perfect Harmony as
[1:06:00] the heavens and the Earth is husband and
[1:06:02] wife so is Christ and the church and
[1:06:06] they all meet in one big glorious Plan
[1:06:09] of Redemption and is brought right into
[1:06:12] the bosom of God again do you see it do
[1:06:15] you see it do you see it bethl
[1:06:18] Tabernacle do you see it see so while
[1:06:22] he's sterilizing the Earth I'm lifted up
[1:06:25] in him safe now that's happening right
[1:06:28] now because uh the my soul realm is now
[1:06:31] impervious it the the the the fires of
[1:06:34] tribulation and judgment are already
[1:06:36] falling on this Earth but they're not
[1:06:38] going to get me they weary this flesh
[1:06:41] they might even stumble this flesh but
[1:06:42] they ain't getting me because I've been
[1:06:44] lifted up into him and I'm
[1:06:49] safe see so he's showing here uh he says
[1:06:54] um
[1:06:56] he says let me catch these two
[1:06:57] paragraphs he says just as God created
[1:06:59] the Earth in six days made the Earth six
[1:07:01] days or 6,000 years referring to Peter a
[1:07:04] thousand years as a day he says and
[1:07:07] Christ is gone and is preparing a place
[1:07:11] that's been on its construction for many
[1:07:13] many thousands of years preparing a
[1:07:15] place and if I go and prepare a place I
[1:07:17] will come again and receive you that
[1:07:19] wherever I am you may be also notice the
[1:07:23] Redeemer and the redeemed
[1:07:26] so he's showing when we this is why when
[1:07:30] we look at that Holy City he's he's
[1:07:34] showing
[1:07:36] definitively the last word on who is a
[1:07:40] real Christian and and who have always
[1:07:43] been a real child of God so it's a
[1:07:47] definitive answer it's the last word I
[1:07:49] want you to remember that it's God's
[1:07:51] last word on who our real Christians and
[1:07:56] have always been real Christians say who
[1:07:58] is it it's those who have been a
[1:08:02] reflection of that
[1:08:04] City see you see the the correlation so
[1:08:09] it's the it's the what are some of the
[1:08:11] characteristics of that City how about
[1:08:14] this the absence of sin or impurity the
[1:08:18] golden streets of cleanness and Holiness
[1:08:21] the king Seated on his throne in your
[1:08:25] heart the pillar of fire on the top
[1:08:27] overshadowing all of our intelligence
[1:08:30] and all of our thoughts giving us the
[1:08:31] mind of Christ that's a real Christian
[1:08:35] just like that's a real city of the king
[1:08:38] so whenever people try to interpret what
[1:08:41] a Christian is and it's less than what
[1:08:43] you read about in that City to say uhuh
[1:08:46] because that's a reflection of this
[1:08:47] which is a reflection of that Hallelujah
[1:08:50] and that puts the devil to silence
[1:08:53] there's no doubt what it is to be a real
[1:08:55] Christian and be a real believer because
[1:08:57] when the book of redemption was open we
[1:08:59] could see the new
[1:09:02] city and fact is brother brandham refers
[1:09:08] to um in Revelation 34 to 23 I'm not
[1:09:12] going to read it today but brother
[1:09:14] brandham calls that the final
[1:09:17] Council because it's the message to
[1:09:20] leoda and he's he's saying here after
[1:09:24] 2,000 years this is where you've
[1:09:27] arrived you are you think you're rich
[1:09:30] and increased with Goods you're unaware
[1:09:33] you're blind that you're actually
[1:09:35] miserable and naked and
[1:09:37] poor and what you really have need of
[1:09:40] you think you need nothing but what you
[1:09:42] actually don't know is you need to buy
[1:09:44] of me gold tried in the fire you need a
[1:09:47] purity you don't have you need the
[1:09:49] garments of the word that you've
[1:09:51] rejected see and so he says I I counsel
[1:09:54] the he that hath an ear because in every
[1:09:57] age there was going to be people who had
[1:09:59] an ear there'd be people who sat
[1:10:01] shoulder toos shoulder in barrooms but
[1:10:03] they have an ear to hear the word of God
[1:10:05] there wouldd be people who were trapped
[1:10:07] behind denominational uh barb wire but
[1:10:09] they had an ear to hear the word
[1:10:11] whoever's got an ear come out of her my
[1:10:14] people I'm glad I had that kind of an
[1:10:17] ear I'm glad I heard an eagle
[1:10:20] scream see so he called it the final
[1:10:23] counsel this was God's final final
[1:10:25] Counsel on the age you're blind you're
[1:10:28] miserable stop saying you're great
[1:10:30] you're not great stop saying you're my
[1:10:33] church you're not even my church at all
[1:10:35] anymore you've kicked me out you you
[1:10:38] used to be my mouthpiece you're no
[1:10:40] longer my mouthpiece I have called a
[1:10:42] bride out of you and she is my
[1:10:45] mouthpiece she's the final voice to the
[1:10:48] final age her Doctrine her teaching her
[1:10:52] lifestyle is my last will in Testament
[1:10:55] do what you want say what you want let
[1:10:57] 33,000 say what they want let the
[1:10:59] Republicans the Democrats say whoever
[1:11:02] can say whatever but I am establishing
[1:11:04] in the Earth One More Time a true bride
[1:11:08] who's living in the True
[1:11:10] Image and she my last will in Testament
[1:11:13] and nothing will be altered whoever
[1:11:15] tries to add to it will add plagues and
[1:11:19] if you try to take away from what she's
[1:11:21] given I'll take your name out of the
[1:11:23] book of life amen
[1:11:26] see so God always has the last word on
[1:11:32] the
[1:11:33] matter and may I say God desires to have
[1:11:38] the last word in your life
[1:11:42] amen so this is why a prophet would say
[1:11:45] it's a great question is your life
[1:11:48] worthy of the
[1:11:50] Gospel see it's a great
[1:11:53] question what shall I do
[1:11:55] now forget pilate it's what shall I do I
[1:11:59] know what pilate did what shall I do
[1:12:03] with Jesus called the
[1:12:06] Christ we're not talking about his
[1:12:08] historical figure we're talking about
[1:12:10] Christ today in his word
[1:12:13] amen so God always wants your life to be
[1:12:17] the last word he doesn't just want you
[1:12:20] to believe the right the last word and
[1:12:22] say the last word and be the last sign
[1:12:25] this generation will ever see that's all
[1:12:27] true but he wants your life it's a shout
[1:12:31] and it's a voice and it's a trumpet and
[1:12:34] the thing that just happens just it's
[1:12:35] Christ doing them all William brandham
[1:12:38] had no message he didn't even have an
[1:12:39] education good grief he but he had an
[1:12:42] angel that ministered to him a Ministry
[1:12:44] of Divine Healing and the pillar of fire
[1:12:47] came into his room to break the book to
[1:12:48] break the book open to us see and it was
[1:12:52] Christ doing it you don't have the
[1:12:54] ability you're voice is not of any value
[1:12:56] to God it's your it's you when you've
[1:12:59] been converted and filled with the holy
[1:13:01] spirit of God then you're the final
[1:13:03] voice and the last thing that happens
[1:13:05] before the trumpet of God sounds and the
[1:13:07] dead and Christ rise is a final voice in
[1:13:09] The
[1:13:10] Bride to establish and give God the
[1:13:14] final
[1:13:17] say David and
[1:13:22] Goliath we find don't don't follow me in
[1:13:24] this brother Mark I'm just going to go
[1:13:25] across it quickly but you can go home
[1:13:28] and read 1st Samuel 17 and you find the
[1:13:31] story and you know Goliath and great big
[1:13:34] Philistine and he made all of his boast
[1:13:36] to David you know am I a dog that you
[1:13:38] you come out to me with staves and the
[1:13:41] Bible says the Philistine cursed David
[1:13:44] so he's running his mouth quite a bit
[1:13:47] and David's just standing there taking
[1:13:48] it he's waiting you know what he's
[1:13:51] waiting on to have the last
[1:13:53] saylah why why am I still here and why
[1:13:56] is the rapture not come because we're
[1:13:57] got to have the last say we got to have
[1:14:00] a bride that when the world is
[1:14:02] impossible to be an overcomer and yet we
[1:14:05] are
[1:14:06] Overcomers see am I a dog the Philistine
[1:14:10] cursed him and said to David come I'll
[1:14:13] give your flesh to the fowls to the
[1:14:16] beasts of the field and he you know
[1:14:19] that's all he could do and David finally
[1:14:21] waited till it was time for him to speak
[1:14:24] amen because because he was not about to
[1:14:26] give God was not about to give Goliath
[1:14:29] the last
[1:14:30] say and then David said to the
[1:14:33] Philistine thou comest to me with a
[1:14:36] sword and with a spear and with a shield
[1:14:39] but I come to thee in the name of the
[1:14:41] Lord hallelujah he goes on in verse 46
[1:14:44] this day Not Another one not tomorrow
[1:14:47] put it on your put it on your calendar
[1:14:49] this day this very
[1:14:52] day will the Lord deliver thee into mine
[1:14:56] hand and I will smite thee and take
[1:14:59] thine head and all the assembly shall
[1:15:03] know that the Lord saveth not with sword
[1:15:08] and spear for the battle is the Lords
[1:15:11] and he will give you into our hands and
[1:15:15] that was the last word spoken and David
[1:15:19] got his stones and his sling and and
[1:15:22] Goliath drew his sword and moved on
[1:15:24] David and David grabbed his sling and
[1:15:26] ran to meet him and slung a sling and
[1:15:28] popped him between the eyes knocked him
[1:15:30] down jumped on him took his own sword
[1:15:33] and fulfilled the word of God David was
[1:15:36] literally it went from words to life and
[1:15:39] he literally became the word made
[1:15:42] flesh it was the last say that's always
[1:15:45] going to be God's desire is to be the
[1:15:49] last save Jesus is in the wilderness
[1:15:51] with Satan and Satan's got every kind of
[1:15:53] thing finally takes him shows him the
[1:15:56] kingdoms of the world and saith unto him
[1:15:58] all these things will I give thee if
[1:16:00] thou will fall down and worship me then
[1:16:03] saith Jesus unto him get thee hence
[1:16:06] Satan for it is written Thou shalt
[1:16:08] Worship the Lord thy God and him only
[1:16:11] shalt thou serve and that was the end of
[1:16:14] the battle that was the end of the
[1:16:16] discussion and the devil leave left him
[1:16:19] and angels ministered to him I'm here to
[1:16:21] tell you something I'm looking forward
[1:16:22] to a day when the devil keeps trying
[1:16:24] trying to deceive me keeps trying to
[1:16:26] pull me aside he finally it says I can't
[1:16:28] do nothing with this guy you just need
[1:16:30] to go in a Rapture I say thank you very
[1:16:32] much that's exactly what I'm going to do
[1:16:35] Hallelujah friends that's where we are
[1:16:37] don't ever give the devil the last say
[1:16:39] in your
[1:16:41] life Jesus stands with pilate in John 19
[1:16:45] then said pilate unto him they' been all
[1:16:47] this discourse are you a king th say is
[1:16:49] well your people say this and that and
[1:16:50] if it were not you know if this were
[1:16:52] true they're in this discussion and then
[1:16:54] pilate said unto him speakest thou not
[1:16:56] unto me knowest thou not look at this
[1:17:00] look at this Doctrine if you'll notice
[1:17:03] that in Goliath and in Satan and now in
[1:17:07] pilate they're all misrepresenting the
[1:17:11] truth Goliath said this is what I'll do
[1:17:13] and David said that's actually not true
[1:17:15] here's what's going to happen Satan said
[1:17:18] to him this is what I'll do and Jesus
[1:17:19] said no that's contrary to the word the
[1:17:21] word of God is going to be the last say
[1:17:24] then said pilate unto him speakest thou
[1:17:26] not unto me knowest thou not that I have
[1:17:29] power to crucify thee and have power to
[1:17:31] release thee that was such a
[1:17:34] lie that was so not true I'm here to
[1:17:37] tell you something friends I know the
[1:17:39] devil tries to say what he can and can't
[1:17:41] do it's a lie he has no authority over
[1:17:44] God's people Jesus said thou couldest
[1:17:46] have no power at all against me except
[1:17:49] it were given to thee from above no
[1:17:51] matter what Satan can do he's got to get
[1:17:53] permission from my heavenly father he
[1:17:55] has no jurisdiction over my life no
[1:17:57] authority over my life I have renounced
[1:18:00] him I'm living for the king I'm an
[1:18:02] ambassador of a new
[1:18:04] world there's power in the name of
[1:18:08] jesusall see so so this is so now think
[1:18:12] about our text so when we read and now
[1:18:16] you're coming down to the end of the
[1:18:21] Bible and here comes your last verse
[1:18:25] the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
[1:18:30] with you all
[1:18:33] amen so there's no
[1:18:36] discourse there there the devil's not
[1:18:39] here in revelation 22 arguing that Jesus
[1:18:42] said this is his last promise I'm
[1:18:44] telling you I'm giving you my promise
[1:18:47] that the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:49] will be with you amen so be it that's it
[1:18:52] the Challenger is gone the challenge has
[1:18:55] been put down the last accusation has
[1:18:57] been against God's family has been
[1:18:59] silenced and Grace is the last promise
[1:19:02] and amen is the last word hallelujah and
[1:19:06] I have passed from Death to life under
[1:19:08] grace that's the amen and I am bringing
[1:19:11] forth I'm a final voice to the final
[1:19:13] agent Satan is
[1:19:16] silenced amen
[1:19:19] amen God wants to be the Amen in your
[1:19:24] life
[1:19:25] yesj God wants to be the last word in
[1:19:29] your life will you let him today will
[1:19:32] you let him young people will you say I
[1:19:35] want your word to be the last word I
[1:19:37] want your word to be the amen forget
[1:19:40] what I think it's I only want what you
[1:19:42] think Lord how many today can say Lord
[1:19:44] grant that to me
[1:19:48] hallelujah it's what we
[1:19:51] desire so brother brandham says
[1:19:55] yeah you're a part of the earth your
[1:19:59] body your soul is part of God that
[1:20:02] beautiful not
[1:20:04] simple you're a part of the earth your
[1:20:07] body your soul is a part of God an
[1:20:09] attribute of God displayed here on Earth
[1:20:12] in a
[1:20:13] body the body is to be redeemed now the
[1:20:17] Soul's redeemed because it was in
[1:20:20] sin
[1:20:22] amen only four people
[1:20:25] your soul is redeemed CU it used to be
[1:20:27] in sin we're just waiting on the body to
[1:20:30] get redeemed see but in my body I'm
[1:20:33] being the final voice I'm being the amen
[1:20:35] of the word amen this why there's no
[1:20:38] backing
[1:20:39] down that's why there's no compromise
[1:20:42] that's why the ministry team here we're
[1:20:44] not going to preach you a watered down
[1:20:45] gospel nothing do you don't even want
[1:20:48] that you wouldn't stay here if we
[1:20:51] started preaching that you're Eagles and
[1:20:53] you want Eagle food and we're all more
[1:20:55] happy to supply you with eagle food we
[1:20:58] have no backing up no compromise on the
[1:21:00] word of God we're not interested in
[1:21:02] pleasing the
[1:21:04] world we interested in pleasing the
[1:21:08] master so he says the body to be
[1:21:11] redeemed now the soul is redeemed
[1:21:12] because it was in sin so God come down
[1:21:15] by process of
[1:21:17] justification
[1:21:18] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:20] and redeemed your soul and you being
[1:21:23] part of the Earth see this is this is
[1:21:25] Insider stuff this is redemption mystery
[1:21:29] see and you I mean I can read this these
[1:21:33] secrets to the
[1:21:34] world that's not really that you're
[1:21:36] hearing it read or that you're getting
[1:21:38] to read the mystery the book God opened
[1:21:40] to you that's not it I can read these
[1:21:42] words to the world they don't believe
[1:21:44] them they don't accept it oh no that's
[1:21:47] not true well okay good luck with that
[1:21:51] but I believe it's true
[1:21:54] so he
[1:21:57] says he redeemed your soul and you being
[1:22:00] a part of the earth it's Redeemed by it
[1:22:03] you're in the process now it's growing
[1:22:04] on your body was justified under Noah's
[1:22:07] baptism amen and your flesh speaking of
[1:22:10] Jesus on the cross when he his blood run
[1:22:12] down the cross when it dropped upon
[1:22:13] there and the Earth is to be cleansed by
[1:22:16] fire so in Noah's day it got its baptism
[1:22:19] of water Jesus blood ran down the cross
[1:22:21] onto the Earth and baptized it in
[1:22:23] justification now sanctification but
[1:22:25] it's got but then the church went on to
[1:22:27] Pentecost the earth goes through a
[1:22:29] millennium and goes on to to the to the
[1:22:31] Eighth Day Pentecost amen see and so he
[1:22:35] says and the Earth is to be cleansed by
[1:22:38] fire the place where you live with the
[1:22:41] baptism of the Holy
[1:22:43] Spirit don't you see now watch him watch
[1:22:46] him just bring this down to just to just
[1:22:50] common language don't you see the towns
[1:22:52] the cities the houses the dwellings are
[1:22:55] speaking of that right now all these
[1:22:57] natural things are a shadow brother
[1:23:00] Brandon would
[1:23:01] say you see a tree struggling to live he
[1:23:06] says that is proof that there's one
[1:23:08] somewhere not
[1:23:09] struggling said you see a man struggling
[1:23:13] gasping the death rattle in his throat
[1:23:15] gasping for air trying to live he said
[1:23:18] that shows that there's a body somewhere
[1:23:21] that doesn't do that Hallelujah indeed
[1:23:25] doesn't struggle doesn't have pain
[1:23:28] there's no yesterday there's no tomorrow
[1:23:30] it's just all right now you've just
[1:23:32] arrived a prophet could even have words
[1:23:34] to explain it and that's just under the
[1:23:35] altar in the sixth Dimension think of
[1:23:38] what that realm is going to be friends
[1:23:40] no wonder Paul could say it's never
[1:23:41] entered into the heart of man even in
[1:23:43] your imagination I can imagine quite a
[1:23:45] bit I can't imagine what that'll be the
[1:23:48] reality of it opening
[1:23:50] up so he
[1:23:53] says don't you see the towns the cities
[1:23:55] the houses the dwellings are speaking of
[1:23:57] that right now all these natural things
[1:23:59] are a
[1:24:01] shadow and he gives an example take a
[1:24:03] shadow at a distance like my hand before
[1:24:07] there can be a positive or A negative
[1:24:10] there has to be a positive see so you
[1:24:13] can't see it but I know you know what
[1:24:14] I'm talking about I could put it up here
[1:24:15] on the wall see there's my there's my a
[1:24:18] reflection of my hand now it's all very
[1:24:21] faint you can't even hardly make out the
[1:24:23] details until I start moving close and
[1:24:25] The Closer I Get The Sharper it gets the
[1:24:27] further you go along the closer you're
[1:24:29] getting you understand the more in line
[1:24:32] your body is coming into that because
[1:24:35] you're facing challenges if just by
[1:24:39] virtue of nothing more than the fact
[1:24:40] that the world is more
[1:24:42] nuts just by virtue of the fact that the
[1:24:45] world is more insane than it's ever been
[1:24:47] and the days of Sodom and the days of of
[1:24:50] lot and Sodom and Noah and his age are
[1:24:52] upon us together and now it's 6,000
[1:24:54] years and Satan's had 6,000 years to
[1:24:56] build his Eden and he's the God of this
[1:24:58] evil age and the world is more crazy and
[1:25:01] more impossible than it's ever been if
[1:25:03] if if just by virtue of that alone and
[1:25:05] you're still standing against that tidal
[1:25:08] wave where it's impossible to stand but
[1:25:10] you're still standing I know the Devil
[1:25:12] beats you up because you don't always
[1:25:14] feel like a superch Christian trust me
[1:25:16] you're a superch Christian trust me
[1:25:18] you're a super race a super people and
[1:25:20] you've got a perfect faith more perfect
[1:25:22] Faith than you're aware of
[1:25:25] amen amen how much Faith does it take to
[1:25:28] see our loved ones drifting away but
[1:25:30] have a power of Faith to take the word
[1:25:32] of God and claim them and apply a token
[1:25:34] and hold on until a supernatural God
[1:25:37] moves on the scene and brings your words
[1:25:40] into reality Hallelujah friends that's
[1:25:44] what the word has given to us today see
[1:25:47] so he says it's a
[1:25:50] shadow all these Natural Things says
[1:25:53] take a shadow distance like my hand
[1:25:55] before there can be a positive or A
[1:25:56] negative there has to be a
[1:25:58] positive you see that shadow look like I
[1:26:01] got a dozen fingers but then when you
[1:26:03] get go to getting it close together it
[1:26:05] focuses down to one and then the shadow
[1:26:08] Fades into the hand that's a lot of
[1:26:11] times people thinks there's three or
[1:26:13] four Gods because they're look too far
[1:26:15] back in the early Reformation they
[1:26:18] haven't focused the lens see brother
[1:26:20] Bram in another place he's and and this
[1:26:23] this to do with Optics that's what
[1:26:26] Shadows that it looks like in
[1:26:28] photography you have when they when they
[1:26:30] invented film paper film you had
[1:26:31] negatives see and so so but then you had
[1:26:34] a you had the the photograph when after
[1:26:37] it was finished developing so so so I
[1:26:40] don't want to get ahead of myself let me
[1:26:41] go through this finish this quote then
[1:26:43] I'll give you my
[1:26:44] thought so brother Brown talks about it
[1:26:47] in one other place he said the other day
[1:26:50] Billy gave me some I think it was a
[1:26:53] camera
[1:26:54] and he said Daddy and they stopped along
[1:26:57] the side of the road and he said there
[1:26:58] was I think there was antalope out
[1:27:00] across the Prairie and he said take a
[1:27:02] picture and brother brandham looked in
[1:27:03] the camera and he said I was looking at
[1:27:05] one and I could see two or three and he
[1:27:08] said there something wrong with this
[1:27:09] camera and he said no Daddy you got to
[1:27:10] focus it and so he started turning the
[1:27:13] lens he said and all three came into one
[1:27:17] see and that's the way he said they're
[1:27:19] looking too far back under the
[1:27:20] Reformation that's why they see three
[1:27:22] and four Gods if you would just focus it
[1:27:24] and focus it to the revealed word of
[1:27:26] this hour Not only would you see one God
[1:27:29] but you'd see you're a part of his
[1:27:31] godhead see you're talking about
[1:27:33] focusing because what you're focusing on
[1:27:36] is the book of
[1:27:38] redemption friends this is just
[1:27:42] beautiful you enjoying the
[1:27:45] word I'm watching my time I'm only going
[1:27:47] to get so far I've already got it marked
[1:27:50] so he said it focuses down and then the
[1:27:52] shadow Fades into the hand see so that's
[1:27:55] a lot of times and he goes on he says
[1:27:57] come on down now you'll find the focus
[1:28:00] focus is into there's one exactly so so
[1:28:05] the world let me say this to you
[1:28:07] today you know there's all kinds of
[1:28:10] conspiracy uh people who just don't even
[1:28:13] know what they're talking about and they
[1:28:16] they say oh this is just a
[1:28:18] simulation you're just living in a
[1:28:20] simulation it's all just a matrix anyway
[1:28:23] and and they actually believe that they
[1:28:27] have convinced themselves that nothing
[1:28:29] is
[1:28:30] real that that that that the Earth is
[1:28:33] just a little playground for some great
[1:28:36] whatever some great energy some great
[1:28:38] intelligence or maybe it's nothing of
[1:28:40] any of that and and and life here is
[1:28:43] just meaningless anyway and when you're
[1:28:44] done here you're done what a shallow
[1:28:48] life well I mean if I had to believe
[1:28:50] that with all the trials and
[1:28:51] tribulations I've had to go through and
[1:28:53] if I didn't believe there's a world
[1:28:54] coming and a body that I'm going to get
[1:28:56] to live in and go back and recapture my
[1:28:59] youth and recapture my health and and
[1:29:01] and have all of that back with No Malice
[1:29:03] or hatred or jealousy or Envy or all of
[1:29:05] those things
[1:29:08] Hallelujah so we're seeing here by what
[1:29:11] a prophet is saying the world is not a
[1:29:15] simulation so so so but it is a
[1:29:20] shadow see it's it's like a in one s and
[1:29:24] I'll give you another sense of it here
[1:29:25] in a minute so it's like it's like a
[1:29:29] photographic film negative like a
[1:29:32] negative that back in the days of film
[1:29:34] it's make actually making quite a
[1:29:36] Resurgence but but film is so authentic
[1:29:39] it's not like digital where you got to
[1:29:41] you know takes nine images and gets the
[1:29:42] best one then you just got to tweak it
[1:29:44] and the the the the the film as long as
[1:29:46] your lighting is good you can get
[1:29:48] actually what it was and there's and
[1:29:50] photographers who are going back to it
[1:29:51] saying there's something about film that
[1:29:53] you just can't cat capture digitally
[1:29:55] there's a real there's a realness to it
[1:29:57] and and so so the when you're looking at
[1:30:00] a negative like back in the days of
[1:30:02] photography of film photography the
[1:30:05] images that you see on the negative are
[1:30:09] real they're just not
[1:30:13] finished they're Shadow they're a
[1:30:16] negative they're real they're not a
[1:30:19] simulation you're looking at that
[1:30:20] negative you hold up light and go oh I
[1:30:22] see my mom there look at that see but
[1:30:24] everything's
[1:30:25] inverted and so the darks are lights and
[1:30:28] the lights are dark and it takes a
[1:30:30] process to get the whole thing finished
[1:30:33] I mean my life here I know it doesn't
[1:30:35] look like that life there you know why
[1:30:37] it's inverted I'm in a shadow I know
[1:30:41] this body doesn't look very Eternal but
[1:30:43] I got one that does hallelujah I know I
[1:30:46] have all kinds of problems in my mind
[1:30:47] and you got all problems but my mind is
[1:30:49] upside down but I got a positive one
[1:30:52] coming
[1:30:54] I got one that's going to be finished
[1:30:56] he's putting me through the process
[1:30:58] right now that's what you're sitting
[1:31:00] here today you're being processed from a
[1:31:03] negative to a
[1:31:06] positive see it's not a simulation the
[1:31:09] only reason it appear you know when when
[1:31:11] when when we look at a shadow the reason
[1:31:14] that a shadow appears real to you is
[1:31:17] because you're Shadow you're a shadow
[1:31:18] looking at Shadow you're a negative
[1:31:20] looking at a negative so so it it
[1:31:23] appears real so so you're a shadow
[1:31:25] looking at a shadow now so you you
[1:31:28] perceive it as real but just remember
[1:31:33] you are real amen but you're not
[1:31:36] done amen you're not finished you're not
[1:31:41] yet he's still working on me my kid just
[1:31:46] sing that when they were little I'm
[1:31:47] going to make them all sing it next
[1:31:49] Sunday to make me what I ought to be see
[1:31:54] so the the images are real they're just
[1:31:56] not finished all right so so can I so
[1:32:00] the the shadow of you is not the final
[1:32:05] say
[1:32:07] hallelujah take that devil yeah I look
[1:32:10] in the man in the mirror and I go boy
[1:32:11] you got problems but then I go yeah but
[1:32:13] you ain't finished yet Hallelujah this
[1:32:16] ain't the final say of Jason Watkins
[1:32:19] thank God thank God thank God Hallelujah
[1:32:24] see so it's not the final say now so let
[1:32:27] me let me give you some more things that
[1:32:30] a Kentucky Hill belly explained it so
[1:32:31] simply because life life is a shadow
[1:32:36] life is a negative but life is not
[1:32:40] non-reality it's not a simulation
[1:32:43] see as broken as it is with all of its
[1:32:48] hardship and all of its loss it is real
[1:32:54] it is it's not a simulation I mean
[1:32:57] friends the Garden of Eden wasn't a
[1:33:00] simulation the the the very what Adam
[1:33:02] and Eve did when they collapsed it and
[1:33:05] they and they fell that was not a
[1:33:07] simulation I'm here to tell you hell is
[1:33:09] not a
[1:33:11] simulation you best believe that hell is
[1:33:13] not a simulation all a man or a woman
[1:33:16] going there for rejecting the Divine
[1:33:19] propitiation in the death burial and
[1:33:21] resurrection of Jesus Christ people who
[1:33:23] go there that's not a simulation and
[1:33:26] I'll tell you further the sufferings of
[1:33:28] the Lord Jesus Christ was not a
[1:33:31] simulation he suffered for real he
[1:33:34] suffered in a body he's not like the
[1:33:36] Gnostic settle he's just an apparition
[1:33:38] he's just a a phantom he was real he was
[1:33:41] a man John said we've handled God we
[1:33:46] handled him with our own
[1:33:48] hands Calvary was not a simulation his
[1:33:51] suffering was not a simulation
[1:33:54] I'll promise you that perfect life oh my
[1:33:57] that we're headed to friends is not a
[1:34:01] simulation so life is
[1:34:03] real but by virtue of it not being the
[1:34:07] original
[1:34:08] order it fell into Shadow so brother
[1:34:11] brandham explained it by drawing a
[1:34:14] perfect circle and down here in the
[1:34:17] bottom of the circle he drew a little
[1:34:19] Loop down it the circle's coming around
[1:34:23] and then it loops Loops down back up
[1:34:25] into the circle again and that's the
[1:34:26] whole Plan of Redemption he says my wife
[1:34:29] ma called it a little hickey just a
[1:34:32] little drop down from eternity into time
[1:34:35] to accomplish Redemption and everything
[1:34:38] from Genesis to Revelation 4,000 years
[1:34:41] of Old Testament history and 2,000 years
[1:34:44] of New Testament history and we've
[1:34:45] looped down and back up and we're almost
[1:34:47] ready to hit the circle
[1:34:49] again oh friends happy day happy
[1:34:54] day oh my see so so it's a it's a lower
[1:35:00] form of reality uh and most importantly
[1:35:04] it's not the original reality and that
[1:35:07] is what this message is so much about on
[1:35:11] the future home that he's trying to say
[1:35:13] you have a future a reality in the
[1:35:15] future that's more real this one is just
[1:35:17] a this one is transitory you're just a
[1:35:20] transient you're just passing through
[1:35:22] this world isn't even your home this
[1:35:24] life's not even about this life it's
[1:35:25] just a proven ground it's a training
[1:35:27] field you're being called back up into
[1:35:30] eternity you've been given the open book
[1:35:32] of redemption to believe it say Amen to
[1:35:34] every word and your life come and be a
[1:35:37] final voice to the final age to bring
[1:35:39] the sleeping
[1:35:40] Saints see so so it fell from its
[1:35:44] Eternal realm in the Garden of Eden
[1:35:46] brother Ram talks about that realm was
[1:35:48] in Eternal realm and it fell down into a
[1:35:51] lower form of reality uh that's not the
[1:35:54] original reality and that's exactly why
[1:35:59] friends that's exactly why if time is
[1:36:02] anything it's
[1:36:04] temporary you just remember that I mean
[1:36:07] if time's anything at all and there's a
[1:36:09] lot about the SpaceTime Continuum that
[1:36:10] science don't even understand but just
[1:36:12] understand this it's not the original
[1:36:15] time is not the original and time's
[1:36:17] going to run out and that that new
[1:36:18] heavens and new earth is not in time and
[1:36:21] time is never coming back again
[1:36:23] Hallelujah I don't care what you're
[1:36:25] suffering right now it's temporary I
[1:36:27] don't care what's happening in your life
[1:36:29] I don't care if it's sickness if it's
[1:36:30] finances if the devil's got your
[1:36:31] children it's temporary it's
[1:36:34] temporary God's plan will prevail
[1:36:39] Hallelujah we all grieve our fallen
[1:36:42] Humanity what they've done to the Earth
[1:36:43] we all grieve that
[1:36:45] amen what they've done to the world
[1:36:47] order of things and all the Crooked
[1:36:49] politics and the filthy entertainments
[1:36:51] and the open filth on the streets and in
[1:36:54] the public places and and I mean
[1:36:56] ultimately ultimately friends listen
[1:37:00] ultimately we we always knew that the
[1:37:03] world would finally come to Total
[1:37:07] Insanity see so we're not even to be
[1:37:09] amazed Peter said when these fiery
[1:37:11] trials don't even be amazed at that we
[1:37:13] always knew the world was coming to its
[1:37:17] complete Insanity the total depravity
[1:37:21] where it is right now amen where it is
[1:37:24] right now that even even society as a
[1:37:28] whole as as Paul said who knowing the
[1:37:31] Judgment of God that they which commit
[1:37:35] such things are worthy of death meaning
[1:37:38] at the Judgment bar people who reject
[1:37:41] this word and live that kind of a life
[1:37:45] are worthy of death at the Judgment
[1:37:48] don't think that God is being evil to
[1:37:50] destroy them God so loved the world he
[1:37:54] came as a man and died for them I don't
[1:37:56] think he needs to prove his
[1:37:58] love I don't think God has anything to
[1:38:01] prove to the planet Earth see and so
[1:38:05] Paul warned the alpha Church of this in
[1:38:08] Romans 1:32 William brandham warned the
[1:38:11] the Omega Church Paul warned the alpha
[1:38:13] Church William brandham warned the Omega
[1:38:15] Church that the world would go totally
[1:38:16] insane amen is that right and and and
[1:38:20] Paul Paul even included the blindness of
[1:38:23] the age notwithstanding that they fully
[1:38:27] know the Judgment of God even though
[1:38:30] it's a blind age that Paul acknowledges
[1:38:34] in that 32nd verse that that they
[1:38:36] actually they know they they fully know
[1:38:41] the Judgment of God not only do the same
[1:38:44] themselves but have pleasure in others
[1:38:47] that do
[1:38:50] them th this is exactly why the ESV
[1:38:53] translates that 32nd verse like this
[1:38:55] listen though they know God's righteous
[1:39:00] decrees that those who practice such
[1:39:03] things deserve to die they not only do
[1:39:06] them but give approval to those who
[1:39:09] practice
[1:39:11] them see Eugene Peterson in his message
[1:39:15] translation says verse 32 and it's not
[1:39:19] as if they don't know better they know
[1:39:21] perfectly well they're spitting in God
[1:39:23] face and they don't care worse they hand
[1:39:27] out prizes to those who do the worst
[1:39:29] things
[1:39:31] best come from another planet come from
[1:39:35] another galaxy and live on this Earth
[1:39:37] for 30 days and tell me that's not
[1:39:40] true come come from a whole another
[1:39:43] universe and live and walk this Earth
[1:39:45] for 30 days and try to say Paul was
[1:39:47] wrong or William Brandon was wrong
[1:39:49] saying the world would go totally insane
[1:39:51] oh it's true friends it's it's true the
[1:39:54] world over in every nation it's true in
[1:39:56] every nation in every
[1:39:58] tongue now you got a seat belt
[1:40:03] on you better buckle
[1:40:06] up might better cinch my belt
[1:40:09] up this is tough how many Believers are
[1:40:14] here so now it's Elijah's turn in the
[1:40:18] Omega age to amplify
[1:40:21] that and he quotes the scripture they
[1:40:24] have pleasure in them that do them
[1:40:27] that's that's the point I'm making Paul
[1:40:29] said not only do they know better but
[1:40:30] they actually take pleasure in not only
[1:40:32] do they do it but they take pleasure in
[1:40:34] the people that do they give rewards to
[1:40:35] the people who sin the
[1:40:37] best isn't that the age we've come
[1:40:40] to everybody the worse you can send the
[1:40:43] more vow you can be and and and and
[1:40:46] they've got some of the most vile un un
[1:40:50] almost indescribably runchy
[1:40:53] women who are now the role models for
[1:40:55] 12-year-old
[1:40:57] girls the most runchy and vulgar worse
[1:41:01] than worse than who was that brother
[1:41:03] brandom said they and feathered
[1:41:04] Calamity Jane or whoever that was she
[1:41:06] was nothing compared to what they have
[1:41:09] now she at least she didn't walk out in
[1:41:11] public in her
[1:41:13] underwear didn't talk vulgar like that
[1:41:15] she cussed like men and wore pants and
[1:41:18] rode a horse and so they tired and
[1:41:19] feathered her and yet today they exalt
[1:41:22] these women that do that yes they exalt
[1:41:26] these men who chase after them and
[1:41:27] worship them that's why I so appreciated
[1:41:29] brother Jason's sermon today his lesson
[1:41:31] on in Sunday school that that men that
[1:41:34] men are being broken down at the W
[1:41:36] worshiping at the idol of women see ill-
[1:41:39] famed women the the the this not an
[1:41:43] accident the Bible said it would be here
[1:41:47] a prophet back in CB Scout days said it
[1:41:49] would be here and it is here Marilyn
[1:41:52] Monroe was almost a a none compared to
[1:41:59] today brother brandham takes this verse
[1:42:01] have pleasure in them that do them he
[1:42:04] said you might say this is from the
[1:42:06] message my favorite message is your life
[1:42:09] worthy of the
[1:42:10] Gospel he said you might say I would
[1:42:14] never come to that point let me see a
[1:42:17] list of your friends and
[1:42:19] Associates the ones that you commit the
[1:42:22] most amount of your time to and I'll
[1:42:23] tell you who you have pleasure
[1:42:28] in you let me see what you look at and
[1:42:33] what you read and the kind of music you
[1:42:35] listen to the crowd you associate with
[1:42:38] and I'll tell you what kind of a spirit
[1:42:40] is in
[1:42:44] you where God is looking for a people
[1:42:47] who are willing to be a different
[1:42:50] voice who are willing who are saying I
[1:42:53] will not be the I will not be these
[1:42:55] people who take pleasure in ungodliness
[1:42:58] and I will not take pleasure in the
[1:43:00] people who who they support I will not
[1:43:04] support I will not condone I will not
[1:43:06] associate myself if if I have to live
[1:43:09] alone on a Mountaintop I will not
[1:43:12] associate with this ungodly
[1:43:15] world see so we can't say we don't know
[1:43:18] these things
[1:43:19] friend can't say that you can't say it
[1:43:23] you've been spending your whole life
[1:43:24] reading these listening to these
[1:43:26] messages reading your Bible yeah so so
[1:43:29] we can't say uh that we don't know these
[1:43:32] things the question is do you
[1:43:34] care see that's what uh that's what the
[1:43:38] ESV says that that that the people who
[1:43:41] do these things they don't care they
[1:43:42] they know they're spitting in God's face
[1:43:44] they don't care so the question is today
[1:43:47] I do do you care I can tell you this he
[1:43:50] cares do you careen
[1:43:53] answer that young people don't don't
[1:43:54] answer it to brother Jason answer it in
[1:43:56] your heart he cares do you care he cares
[1:43:59] to save you and redeem you and change
[1:44:01] you and clean your life up do you care
[1:44:03] to be cleaned and revived and and
[1:44:05] repurposed to live for
[1:44:09] God let me tell you what he knows about
[1:44:12] you let me tell you friends that why his
[1:44:16] grace just keeps reaching to us again
[1:44:18] and again let me tell you why he won't
[1:44:20] let you go because here's what he knows
[1:44:24] he knows you were born in
[1:44:27] sin he knows that you came trapped in a
[1:44:31] fallen nature and this is exactly why
[1:44:34] David pleaded with the Lord to not judge
[1:44:37] him by his missteps and his his failures
[1:44:40] but to judge him by his heart said if
[1:44:43] you judge me by my works I'm finished
[1:44:45] but if you'll Judge Me by My Heart Lord
[1:44:47] I love you job did the same thing job
[1:44:51] pleaded with the Lord that that he could
[1:44:53] be weighed on honest scales Lord weigh
[1:44:56] my heart on honest scales that I love
[1:44:58] you now it it blew my mind when I
[1:45:01] thought about these men I thought about
[1:45:03] this last night or this
[1:45:05] morning that blew my mind when I thought
[1:45:08] about that these men could pray like
[1:45:10] that and they were
[1:45:13] unconverted and they didn't not only did
[1:45:15] they not have the Holy Ghost they didn't
[1:45:16] have access to it see so so they didn't
[1:45:20] have the new birth that we had have and
[1:45:24] and so so then as such as such then then
[1:45:28] there'd be no way for them to escape the
[1:45:33] enmity that exists in their minds that
[1:45:36] that is against God Paul said that your
[1:45:38] Fallen mind is enmity against God's word
[1:45:41] it can never agree with God so they they
[1:45:44] had no way to escape the darkness in
[1:45:46] their hearts from a wrong birth no way
[1:45:49] like you have David had no way to escape
[1:45:53] the darkness job had no way to escape
[1:45:55] the darkness in his heart from a wrong
[1:45:57] birth they had no way to escape the
[1:45:59] enmity of their minds that was against
[1:46:02] God by being born in sin and yet job and
[1:46:05] David could still cry out for a clean
[1:46:08] heart I'm here to tell you there had to
[1:46:10] be a different identity somewhere oh
[1:46:14] there had to be something in the
[1:46:15] eternities there had to be another
[1:46:20] representation That's The Power of this
[1:46:22] represent ation you with the Holy Ghost
[1:46:25] have the ability to not only long for it
[1:46:27] but to become it hallelujah oh my I
[1:46:30] thought to myself if David could have
[1:46:32] lived in this day if David could have
[1:46:34] lived under the baptism of the Holy
[1:46:36] Ghost if David could be here today and
[1:46:38] enjoy the message that we enjoy he he he
[1:46:42] he could have he could have looked to
[1:46:43] the truth of God's word and and and
[1:46:46] David could could have written all David
[1:46:49] could have WR WR the psalm like this all
[1:46:52] at once I looked up and I said I'm not
[1:46:55] the son of Charles and Ella
[1:46:58] Branham if David could have looked up
[1:47:01] could have come to this message he could
[1:47:03] have wrote in the Psalms all at once I
[1:47:06] looked up and I said I'm not the son of
[1:47:09] Jesse and nevit I'm not the
[1:47:11] great-grandson of Ruth and Boaz there's
[1:47:14] another me in another world another
[1:47:17] reality oh friends that's the privilege
[1:47:20] that you and I have today and this is
[1:47:24] why God Ran after you because he knew
[1:47:28] that you were born with a nature that
[1:47:30] was not your original nature you're just
[1:47:33] in a shadow you've dropped down Oh my he
[1:47:37] always knew he always knew when he was
[1:47:39] chasing you and you were running but God
[1:47:42] wasn't worried cuz he knew it was
[1:47:45] temporary he knew he would eventually
[1:47:48] corner you and reveal himself to you and
[1:47:50] you would come to your senses and say
[1:47:52] say my father I have a father I'm not
[1:47:55] from here I'm not finishing here I'm
[1:47:58] believing to the word of God I'm
[1:48:00] believing the word of this
[1:48:04] hour oh my on that day when Mama Eagle
[1:48:07] went hunting for her
[1:48:09] child see so now by the new birth we are
[1:48:13] creations of
[1:48:15] Christ we are brand new units amen and
[1:48:20] now Satan will will never have the last
[1:48:27] say how many want to have the last say
[1:48:31] and say what I say Amen stand to your
[1:48:34] feet friends that's the truth that's so
[1:48:38] much of the meaning that brother Brandon
[1:48:40] was trying to get across to people when
[1:48:43] he's preaching he's not just preaching
[1:48:45] about streets of gold and walls of
[1:48:47] Jasper you can read all of that in the
[1:48:48] Bible but he's breaking into the mystery
[1:48:51] of redemption and he's showing you hey
[1:48:52] guess what oh go figure he's redeeming
[1:48:56] you just like he's redeeming that he's
[1:48:58] Redeeming the Earth just like he's
[1:49:00] redeeming you the whole thing works
[1:49:02] together you're in a shadow here now
[1:49:04] you're born in sin you got a body that
[1:49:06] won't cooperate you got a mind that was
[1:49:08] inity you had a heart that was darkened
[1:49:10] but don't worry because I got a plan for
[1:49:13] that I'm putting an attribute of myself
[1:49:16] down inside of you and on a certain day
[1:49:18] when Mama eagle goes looking for that
[1:49:20] child oh she flew over over my way and
[1:49:24] the word screamed to me friends come on
[1:49:26] this morning Hallelujah do you accept
[1:49:29] that God has had that plan for you all
[1:49:31] along you accept that you have Insider
[1:49:34] information that the world can't
[1:49:36] understand they cannot understand it
[1:49:38] they cannot understand why you live and
[1:49:40] you don't you won't participate in the
[1:49:42] world it's I you know I don't
[1:49:44] participate in the world because I don't
[1:49:45] want
[1:49:46] to there's something down inside of me I
[1:49:49] know I'm in a shadow but I'm only in a
[1:49:50] shadow because I'm not in the original
[1:49:52] form form I'm going back to the original
[1:49:56] the world is in a shadow only because it
[1:49:58] dropped down into a shadow that's not
[1:50:00] its original form you can best believe
[1:50:02] that that's why brother brandham said in
[1:50:05] that world he said there will never be a
[1:50:07] bobbed haired woman go in there he said
[1:50:09] I'll promise you that he said cigarette
[1:50:12] smoking painted face Jezebel he said
[1:50:15] you'll never see one on that side said
[1:50:17] they don't care he said I promise you
[1:50:19] and that's that was thus sayith the Lord
[1:50:21] said she'll never get there
[1:50:23] yeah that's what Paul assured us of
[1:50:25] there won't be any kind of thing like

[1:56:41] thinking it's that way but we did
[1:56:43] definitely exist in a form of your
[1:56:47] reality when morning Stars sang together
