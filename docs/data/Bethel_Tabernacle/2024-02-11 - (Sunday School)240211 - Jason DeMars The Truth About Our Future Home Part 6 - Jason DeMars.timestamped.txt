[0:02] they shall not build and another inhabit
[0:05] they shall not plant and another eat for
[0:07] as the days of a tree are the days of my
[0:09] people and my elect shall long enjoy the
[0:12] work of their
[0:13] hands they shall not labor in vain nor
[0:16] bring forth for trouble for they are the
[0:18] seed of the Blessed of the Lord and
[0:20] their offspring with
[0:23] them so when we look at this again we
[0:26] spoke before about the Millennium and
[0:29] the new heaven the new Earth the
[0:31] Millennium is not
[0:32] heaven right and so we have to rule with
[0:35] a rod of iron over the Nations so
[0:37] there's a there's a need for that but it
[0:40] is what what is termed as the
[0:44] Regeneration Jesus calls it that so it's
[0:46] it's a regeneration
[0:48] of cultures
[0:51] Nations uh
[0:53] civilizations and the Earth itself it's
[0:56] a process of regeneration leading up to
[1:00] the new heavens and the new Earth and so
[1:02] there's there's a glimpse of Heaven
[1:04] because for us we'll be there with an
[1:07] immortal
[1:08] body right so we'll we'll be there for
[1:11] an immortal body ruling over the Nations
[1:14] am and it's a foretaste but it isn't the
[1:18] final for us it's not full Redemption
[1:21] because there still will be a gathering
[1:23] of those Nations that will come forth
[1:26] and will fight against the camp of the
[1:28] Saints at the end of now Immortal Saints
[1:31] aren't going to be saved and then lost
[1:34] so it's got to be the Nations that we
[1:35] rule over they're the ones that are
[1:38] deceived and that will come against that
[1:40] and then the fire comes the great white
[1:42] Throne comes that and that is when the
[1:46] new Heaven and the and the new Earth is
[1:47] there and Redemption is
[1:49] complete so looking at this verse
[1:53] there's building there's planting in
[1:55] other words there's
[1:57] farming and it says the work there will
[1:59] will not be done for nothing it's not
[2:02] done in vain so in other words
[2:04] purposeless
[2:06] pointless so if you look at if you look
[2:08] at this and you see that there's work I
[2:11] want to point out the scripture that
[2:13] says the gifts and callings are without
[2:17] repentance and OB usually we take that
[2:20] to mean well while we're alive the gifts
[2:23] and callings are without repentance but
[2:25] I believe that that's not what that
[2:26] means I believe it really is God repents
[2:29] when we die we're no longer going to be
[2:32] what we're called to be before no I
[2:34] believe that if God called you to be the
[2:36] only I'll tell you this the only jobs
[2:39] that are going to be people be out of
[2:41] work is
[2:42] chiropractors doctors Physicians
[2:45] assistants
[2:48] nurses Etc anything that's dealing with
[2:52] needing the need for healing because
[2:57] it'll be complete right but
[3:00] outside of that I said I I believe even
[3:02] within that God will have a special uh
[3:06] call and purpose for those people like
[3:09] brother brandham he continues to be a
[3:11] leader when he's over there but he's not
[3:13] praying for the sick anymore right so
[3:16] there there'll be a place and there'll
[3:17] be a position every person you you and
[3:21] we'll look at the scripture not too in
[3:24] depth but a little bit is that there's a
[3:26] reward for each of us and what God made
[3:29] us to be here we'll continue to be that
[3:32] on the other side if you're an artist
[3:34] here you'll be an artist there if you
[3:36] are a teacher of God's word you'll be a
[3:38] teacher of God's word there what's that
[3:40] now yes we will still be learning we
[3:43] won't be infinite we'll never be
[3:46] infinite so there's always the
[3:49] capability for learning there you can
[3:53] never exhaust God you could never
[3:55] exhaust knowing god and even if you even
[3:59] if you were to take it at at some point
[4:02] in all of eternity we were we took it
[4:04] all in you still as a finite person you
[4:08] couldn't take it all in at the same time
[4:11] right you could only grasp this much
[4:14] because if we could take it all in at
[4:15] the same time all of God in at the same
[4:18] time then we're infinite too so there's
[4:20] no possibility of that so we'll still be
[4:23] learning and growing in understanding
[4:25] and revelation of God even in eternity
[4:30] and brother brandom talks about this the
[4:32] the type of person the type of character
[4:34] that you have when you die it's the same
[4:37] type of person and character that you'll
[4:39] have when you come up
[4:43] again a person that's a carpenter that
[4:45] loves to create things over here is
[4:47] going to be a carpenter and love to
[4:49] create things over
[4:51] there you know the rich man in Lazarus
[4:54] were the same men that lived after they
[4:56] died they were still the rich man in
[4:59] Lazar and Lazarus even though Lazarus
[5:01] was now the rich man and the rich man
[5:03] was now the poor man but they were still
[5:05] known by what they were on the earth
[5:09] incredible also if we think about it our
[5:13] resurrected bodies will have resurrected
[5:18] Minds so we'll be able to uh create and
[5:22] we'll be able to do things with our mind
[5:24] that we never could have IM can imagine
[5:27] doing now the things that we long to do
[5:30] and desire to do and can't get to it
[5:32] here there there'll be no hindrance to
[5:39] it I believe that the
[5:42] Lord designed us to do something he
[5:46] designed us with a purpose not merely
[5:48] just to exist not just to sit there and
[5:51] take it all in but to actually be a
[5:54] means of expressing him I me that was
[5:56] his original purpose for creation and
[5:59] every as we look in the in the purpose
[6:02] of redemption the manifestation of the
[6:05] spirit is given to every man to profit
[6:08] with all so every person is given a
[6:11] spiritual gift to participate in the
[6:13] Plan of Redemption but even further than
[6:16] that we can take that as you God has
[6:18] designed you in a way to express an
[6:20] attribute that he had in himself so that
[6:23] doesn't end in fact this is the negative
[6:26] side of it that's the positive side of
[6:28] it so if you're if you're designed to
[6:31] express something here just imagine what
[6:33] you'll express over
[6:35] there um you know and and it's easy to
[6:38] take that in many carnal directions but
[6:40] I think when you look at it uh we all
[6:43] are desire if you if you have the Holy
[6:45] Ghost inside of you let's put it that
[6:46] way you're Desiring Holiness you're
[6:49] Desiring to be like God and so whatever
[6:53] he's created you and designed you
[6:56] everyone's designed with certain likes
[6:57] and dislikes you see that that and that
[6:59] develops in young in young children as
[7:01] time goes along and you see this one
[7:03] likes this thing this one likes that
[7:05] thing and they go that direction
[7:07] sometimes the devil can hinder a person
[7:11] can put a person in a place I never get
[7:13] to do the thing that I really dream to
[7:17] do maybe that's the case or or maybe
[7:20] you've had to surrender it for whatever
[7:22] responsibility you might have you've
[7:24] surrendered that to the lord well I
[7:26] believe the Lord will take will take
[7:28] that thing and and he will give that to
[7:30] you in its fullness that will bring joy
[7:34] and peace and happiness unlike it ever
[7:36] would here
[7:40] amen Wilbur Smith writes in heaven we
[7:42] will be permitted to finish many of
[7:44] those worthy tasks which we had dreamed
[7:47] to do while on Earth but which neither
[7:48] time nor strength nor ability allowed us
[7:51] to
[7:54] achieve in the beginning man was given
[7:57] the command to take dominion over the
[7:58] Earth
[8:00] and that that never stopped that's
[8:02] continued we're still commanded to take
[8:05] dominion over the Earth but
[8:08] unfortunately it's with the with the
[8:10] influence of Satan over everything with
[8:13] the influence of Satan and the tree of
[8:15] knowledge of Good and Evil it's
[8:17] overseeing and governing everything so
[8:19] no matter what you create it might it
[8:22] might be a net positive but there's
[8:24] going to always be some negative along
[8:26] with it because of because of we're
[8:29] under the tree of
[8:31] knowledge and we're we're cut off from
[8:33] the Tree of Life we would like to design
[8:36] things for the Tree of Life the only the
[8:37] only thing that comes from the the only
[8:39] source of the tree of life is him not
[8:42] you not me it's him he can operate that
[8:46] through us but we can't on our own human
[8:48] level create something after the tree of
[8:50] life that would cause people to eat from
[8:53] that tree metaphorically and live we
[8:56] can't do that just God creates that just
[8:59] God does that but when the curse is
[9:02] lifted we'll be able to continue this
[9:05] task remember taking Dominion was a prec
[9:11] curse Commandment that was given to us
[9:14] right so when the curse is lifted this
[9:18] the same thing has to take place only it
[9:20] won't be after the tree of knowledge
[9:22] it'll be after the tree of life
[9:24] everything that we will do everything
[9:27] that your hand finds to do and when I
[9:28] say this I'm talking about the
[9:30] creativity the
[9:32] inventiveness the the the all those
[9:35] things that go along with what he made
[9:36] us to be will be bursting forth and
[9:40] bringing forth in life and joy and for
[9:43] the glory of God Amen now it's mixed
[9:46] with you know even our best works that
[9:48] we do even our best sermons that we
[9:51] preach are tainted by our own sinfulness
[9:55] and the best sermon that you hear is
[9:57] Tainted by your own sinful
[10:00] see God through the foolishness of
[10:02] preaching it's not the the the word
[10:04] isn't foolish but the PE the vessels are
[10:07] foolish and weak but God through that
[10:10] still perfects his people which is
[10:16] incredible there will be a perfect
[10:19] society that will be built there will be
[10:21] a perfect
[10:23] civilization right now our civilization
[10:26] is all based on evil
[10:29] um
[10:32] fear racism everything
[10:35] else but there we won't have none of
[10:38] those influences will be there all that
[10:41] will be
[10:45] gone you know think of the new Earth in
[10:47] the same way Noah would have thought
[10:49] about the time after the flood where
[10:52] there's a destruction and we're going
[10:54] into something new is going to be formed
[10:58] on the earth only this time God isn't
[10:59] leaving it up to us like he left it to
[11:01] Noah and his
[11:03] sons what did they do they fell why
[11:07] because the Redeemer hadn't
[11:10] come Satan hadn't been bound up Satan
[11:13] the The Works of the devil hadn't been
[11:15] destroyed so God was showing to us again
[11:19] the futility of us doing it on our own
[11:22] there's no you know it it would be great
[11:25] if America became a Christian Nation
[11:27] again but it still would be under the
[11:30] curse because Satan is the prince of the
[11:32] power of the air doesn't matter how
[11:34] Christian it be it would become Satan is
[11:37] still going to put his way in there look
[11:39] what it did at the very beginning of our
[11:41] founding many good things some bad
[11:44] things but nevertheless is what is the
[11:47] result not it's not positive it's not a
[11:50] good thing that we have right now this
[11:52] is the result that's man that's the tree
[11:55] of the knowledge of Good and Evil
[11:56] there's good and there's evil so
[12:04] think about think about this now we're
[12:06] told we only use 10% of our brain
[12:10] capacity so just compreh just
[12:15] imagine having access to 100% of your
[12:18] brain capacity we you can't you've never
[12:22] had it but there you're going to have
[12:24] 100% there'll be there'll be no
[12:27] degradation of your mind of your body so
[12:30] and and don't we think of it in such
[12:32] Heavenly terms well we'll have 100% of
[12:34] our mind and we'll just stand there in a
[12:37] cloud and worship for all time God wants
[12:41] worship
[12:42] for for us to be what he created us to
[12:46] be in total submission and surrender to
[12:48] him that's worship it's not just sitting
[12:51] in a church service there'll be plenty
[12:53] of that in heaven no doubt but the real
[12:57] thing that he wants to see is is us
[12:59] living a life of Kingdom Dominion on the
[13:08] earth uh let's go to the next scripture
[13:11] Jeremiah 31:3 the Lord hath appeared of
[13:14] old unto me saying yay I have loved thee
[13:17] with an Everlasting Love Therefore with
[13:19] loving kindness have I drawn thee amen
[13:22] again I will build thee and thou shalt
[13:24] be built oh Virgin of Israel Thou shalt
[13:26] again be adorned with thy tabrets and
[13:29] shalt go forth in the dances of them
[13:31] that make marry Thou shalt yet plant
[13:33] vines upon the mountains of Samaria the
[13:35] Planters shall plant and shall eat them
[13:38] as common things there's going to be
[13:41] dancing awesome there's going to be
[13:43] music there's going to be Vineyards
[13:46] there's going to be Farmers what do you
[13:47] do with with Vineyards I'll just leave
[13:50] that there you can make your own
[13:56] interpretation Luke 6:21 blessed are ye
[13:59] that hunger now for ye shall be filled
[14:03] blessed are ye that weep now for ye
[14:06] shall laugh amen this is a promise for
[14:09] us you're going to laugh and you're
[14:11] going to be filled filled by God Amen
[14:15] not just spiritually speaking but
[14:17] literally you're going to laugh and
[14:18] you're going to be filled with all good
[14:20] things by God now we weep over sin we
[14:24] weep over loss we weep over pain because
[14:27] of the trials of the life but over there
[14:30] we won't have any of that it'll just be
[14:33] laughter every tear will be wiped
[14:39] away from convinced and concerned
[14:42] brother brandom says now there is
[14:43] somewhere there I was there just as I am
[14:45] here looking back at myself I've had
[14:47] Visions I know what Visions are if that
[14:50] was a vision it was the strangest one I
[14:52] ever
[14:56] had and I seen the people ones that's
[14:58] gone on I seen them there the old was
[15:01] young and they were standing there human
[15:03] beings just like I am only without sin
[15:06] it was beyond Perfection Sublime you you
[15:09] just couldn't mention what it
[15:11] was and when I knew that I had to return
[15:14] back there was one thing that I would
[15:16] return to try to persuade people
[15:19] whatever you do don't miss it don't miss
[15:22] it don't miss it you can't afford to
[15:24] miss it everything else let everything
[15:26] else go but make ready for that see
[15:28] whatever you do
[15:33] amen don't miss we don't want to miss
[15:36] what God has planned for us I mean let's
[15:39] think about the logic let's just talk in
[15:41] logic terms right
[15:43] now right now how much what percentage
[15:47] of
[15:48] time is the next 20 years of your life
[15:52] compared to
[15:54] Eternity what percentage
[15:56] 0% zero so for a moment of doing
[16:03] whatever we want to do seeking pleasure
[16:06] that pleases the
[16:08] flesh we're going to trade that for
[16:12] eternity no
[16:14] way so that's why he says whatever you
[16:17] do don't miss it amen whatever it takes
[16:22] Get Your Heart Right with God make sure
[16:26] that everything is clean and clear in
[16:28] your ready to go there because if you
[16:32] miss it my goodness the pain the
[16:35] suffering and the sorrow you're going to
[16:37] face in torment it's horrible
[16:43] amen amen God is not just going to
[16:46] resurrect our bodies he's actually going
[16:48] to resurrect our works as
[16:51] well let's look at that 1 Corinthians
[16:54] 3:9 for we are are laborers together
[16:58] with God God you are God's husbandry you
[17:01] are God's
[17:02] Building according to the grace of God
[17:05] which is given unto me as a wise master
[17:06] builder I have laid the foundation and
[17:09] another buth thereon but let every man
[17:12] take heed how he builds
[17:16] thereup for other Foundation can no man
[17:19] lay than that is laid which is Jesus
[17:21] Christ now if any man build upon this
[17:25] Foundation gold silver precious Stones
[17:29] wood hay stubble so now the foundation
[17:32] is laid you can't lay another Foundation
[17:35] you can't rip it up and relay it it's
[17:38] been laid the word is final and whenever
[17:42] whenever whenever there's a building on
[17:44] top of that you got to return back to
[17:46] the foundation if anything leaves a
[17:48] foundation it's wrong so there people
[17:50] are going to build on top of it and and
[17:53] Paul is saying there's people that are
[17:55] going to build with gold silver precious
[17:58] stones but then there's also people that
[17:59] are going to burn build with wood hay
[18:02] and
[18:03] stubble verse 13 Every Man's work shall
[18:06] be made manifest for the day shall
[18:08] declare it because it shall be revealed
[18:10] by fire and the fire shall try every
[18:13] man's work of what sort it
[18:18] is if any man's work abide which he hath
[18:21] built thereupon he shall receive a
[18:24] reward if any man's work shall be burned
[18:27] he shall suffer loss but he himself
[18:29] shall be saved yet so as by fire so
[18:34] what's it speaking of
[18:36] Christians can live in such a way that
[18:40] you you're building you're sending your
[18:42] Works ahead of you you also can live in
[18:45] such a way where you don't you'll have
[18:48] no reward you'll be there which is
[18:51] wonderful but you'll have no
[18:53] reward so we have to take heed how we
[18:57] build and what we build because what we
[19:00] do now is what will be resurrected for
[19:02] us in eternity
[19:07] amen so again if your work abides you
[19:11] receive a reward for the work that you
[19:16] do Matthew 6:19 lay not up for
[19:20] yourselves Treasures upon Earth where
[19:22] moth and rust doth corrupt and where
[19:25] thieves break through and steal
[19:28] treasure in Greek means the place in
[19:31] which good and precious things are
[19:32] collected and laid up we usually call
[19:36] that a bank account now we don't have
[19:39] treasure chests some people do
[19:42] but most people have bank
[19:47] accounts um it can also mean a treasury
[19:50] Storehouse repository or
[19:55] magazine verse 20 but lay up up for
[19:58] yourselves Treasures in Heaven where
[20:00] neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and
[20:03] where thieves do not break through nor
[20:07] steal for where your treasure is there
[20:10] will your heart be
[20:13] also so our
[20:16] heart will be where we send our treasure
[20:19] the things that are are well I mean if
[20:22] you really look at a literal sense of
[20:24] the word treasure simply means a form of
[20:27] money that you value the
[20:30] most so wherever you put your
[20:35] money that's where your heart is going
[20:37] to go so we actually can send our
[20:40] treasure into heaven amen how do you do
[20:43] that you don't send wire
[20:47] transfers there's no way to send a wire
[20:49] transfer but of course it's by
[20:53] giving giving of your money giving of
[20:56] your self to the Lord
[21:01] Lord so when we do that it's not merely
[21:04] an act that has no well it has an impact
[21:07] just on the person that receives no it
[21:09] has an impact on
[21:18] you and everyone H I feel like that's
[21:22] skipping I skipped one yeah I didn't put
[21:24] that in the PowerPoint so just blank
[21:28] that out for a minute Philippians
[21:30] 4:17 Paul says not because I desire a
[21:33] gift but I desire fruit that may abound
[21:36] to your account hm
[21:39] interesting so we have an account in
[21:43] heaven you know they have a bank account
[21:45] I don't know the I don't know the
[21:46] numbers
[21:48] yet and I I have no access but it's a
[21:52] trust fund that's there for you that you
[21:54] have access when you die now you you can
[21:58] start a trust fund here and your kids
[22:00] have access when you die but this trust
[22:03] account is one that you can make
[22:06] deposits in and that you actually get
[22:09] access to for all of eternity it it it
[22:13] never Fades away it never gets Rusty it
[22:17] never gets motheaten it continues for
[22:20] all of
[22:22] eternity and accumulation doesn't just
[22:26] stay stagnant at what you put it in
[22:28] there there's actually an interest rate
[22:31] that applies and
[22:33] it's way more than we can
[22:36] imagine Matthew 19:29 and everyone that
[22:40] has forsaken houses or Brethren or
[22:41] sisters or father or mother or wife or
[22:44] children or lands for my name's sake
[22:47] shall receive a h hundredfold and shall
[22:49] inherit everlasting life amen so I want
[22:54] you to think about that for a second
[22:56] does anybody know what percentage rate
[23:00] return 100-fold
[23:02] is anybody have a guess I want to hear
[23:05] somebody guess
[23:07] something 100%
[23:11] nope that's getting
[23:14] closer it's
[23:17] 10,000% so let's back up you can make
[23:21] deposits in your account in heaven right
[23:25] it depends on your attitude it depends
[23:27] on your heart where ever you're wherever
[23:29] you're giving you could give out of
[23:31] obligation that might not end up there
[23:33] but if you're giving as a joyful Giver
[23:36] because you love the Lord with all your
[23:38] heart it's getting added to your bank
[23:40] account in heaven it earns
[23:44] 10,000% and you'll never you'll never
[23:46] lose
[23:48] that uh money that you've deposited
[23:51] there think about that for a second
[23:55] that's real I'm I'm not just making up
[23:57] hyper herbally a joke is it actual money
[24:01] over there no it's your
[24:03] reward you know it's you are faithful
[24:05] over one city rule over 10 cities I that
[24:10] may be that since we rule over the
[24:12] Nations I believe that may be a
[24:15] reality that you'll rule over cities and
[24:19] countries and state there's position of
[24:22] rulership over there and I know it's I
[24:26] know it's very spiritual to say I just
[24:28] don't I don't want to I don't want to do
[24:29] any of that I just want to be with Jesus
[24:31] well Jesus is telling you that you you
[24:33] have a reward that there's an actual
[24:35] reward there's a crown which a crown
[24:38] speaks of
[24:39] what a kingdom a kingship a rulership so
[24:44] there's going to be a rulership and we
[24:46] know that in the in the Millennium we'll
[24:48] be ruling over the Nations but even in
[24:50] the new Earth it speaks about the the
[24:53] the New Jerusalem but it also speaks
[24:55] about the Nations that bring uh their
[24:57] produce and so on and so forth and their
[24:59] wealth into the city so what you're
[25:03] doing now is impacting what you're doing
[25:06] there amen and I'll remind just of a
[25:10] principle that brother brandham has said
[25:12] the people that you
[25:13] think will be there now I'm I'm changing
[25:16] this into reward from being there to
[25:19] rewards but I want you to get the
[25:20] picture is he says the people that you
[25:23] thought for sure will be there may not
[25:25] be there you'll be surp a lot of
[25:26] surprises on the Judgment Day
[25:28] right he says that well I think the same
[25:30] thing goes here we think oh man you
[25:33] know this so and so Minister he did so
[25:36] much and he did this he's going to have
[25:38] this massive reward well he might not it
[25:42] it might be that little brother that was
[25:44] a prayer Warrior that just sat sat there
[25:47] and prayed everybody through to
[25:49] Salvation to the anointing in the
[25:51] service to deliverance and nobody knows
[25:54] anything about what he does except for
[25:56] God Amen and he'll be there sitting
[25:59] right next to the throne so you know we
[26:03] don't God doesn't account it the same
[26:05] way as we know he says be not many
[26:07] Masters because judgment is more strict
[26:09] for you he says greater is condemnation
[26:12] but it really means really speaking of
[26:15] judgment will be more strict for you
[26:17] because if you sin with your
[26:20] words my because you're leading people
[26:23] you're teaching people you're pointing
[26:24] them to Christ and if you're pointing
[26:26] them away even by accident there's going
[26:28] to be a strict judgment there amen so
[26:31] Lord help us let's let's
[26:36] stand Heavenly Father we thank you so
[26:38] much for your goodness and mercy we
[26:39] thank you so much for your word Lord I
[26:41] ask that you'd pray uh that you'd break
[26:43] it down into our hearts Lord that it
[26:45] would be more and more of a reality to
[26:47] us father pray you bless the the the
[26:50] music and the preaching of the word that
[26:53] you'd be glorified in our midst we ask
[26:54] in Jesus name amen God bless you
[27:01] [Music]
[27:26] you
[27:30] [Music]
[29:28] [Music]
