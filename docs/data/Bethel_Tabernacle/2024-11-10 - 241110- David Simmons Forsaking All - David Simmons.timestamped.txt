[34:12] and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[34:15] and come take up the cross and follow me
[34:20] amen and he was sad at that saying and
[34:23] went away grieved for he had great
[34:26] possessions Jes Jesus looked around
[34:28] about and sath unto his
[34:31] disciples how heartily shall they that
[34:34] have riches enter into the kingdom of
[34:37] God I want to skip down to verse
[34:40] 28 then Peter begin to say unto him Lo
[34:43] we have left all and have followed thee
[34:47] let's bow our
[34:50] heads gracious heavenly father as we
[34:53] approach your word this morning this

[34:59] able to handle
[35:01] it only you yes amen amen and Lord if
[35:06] you don't come and speak to us
[35:08] tonight and I've done no good at
[35:11] all but Lord may your spirit come and
[35:14] anoint our hearing and our ears and Lord
[35:17] anoint my
[35:18] lips for without that Lord you know my
[35:21] heart when I was a young man I tried to
[35:23] preach
[35:25] and I was it was
[35:29] terrible but when you come and you
[35:33] speak we see things move yes we see
[35:37] people
[35:38] healed Lord we see people delivered yes
[35:42] and Lord this church here God it's such
[35:45] I feel so humbled around the ministry
[35:47] that he's already got
[35:50] here what a body of
[35:53] Believers Lord bless them I pray anoint
[35:56] me now in Jesus Christ name amen amen
[35:59] you can be
[36:02] seated I also want to turn to 2
[36:05] Corinthians chapter
[36:07] 4 starting with verse one I do a lot of
[36:10] scripture I hope that's all
[36:17] right therefore seeing we have this
[36:19] ministry as we have received Mercy we
[36:22] faint not but have renounced the hidden
[36:25] things of
[36:26] dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor
[36:29] handling the word of God
[36:31] deceitfully but by manifestation of the
[36:34] truth commending ourselves to Every
[36:37] Man's conscience in the sight of God but
[36:40] if our gospel be hid it is hid to them
[36:42] that are
[36:43] lost amen yes now brother Brandon in
[36:47] unveiling of God I'm going to read this
[36:49] quote it's out of paragraph 21 and part
[36:52] of 23 he said I hope and trust that you
[36:56] have a spiritual
[36:58] understanding of
[36:59] what that God had been trying to get
[37:02] over to the church without saying it
[37:04] right out see it's a thing sometimes we
[37:08] have to say things such as a way that it
[37:12] might thin down it might bring some to
[37:16] go out yeah some to leave and some to
[37:21] ponder over but it's done
[37:24] purposely it must be done that way
[37:28] I hope we understand this morning I know
[37:30] most of us here are grown up I hope
[37:33] right so people come in some leave yeah
[37:37] amen then it might be the same would say
[37:41] you mean God would purposely do a thing
[37:43] like that he certainly
[37:47] did amen I'm going to leave it there
[37:50] that's not my message on who's leaving
[37:52] and coming but
[37:54] that's you'll get the Gest of what I'm
[37:56] going to go to here in just a minute
[37:57] minute
[37:59] yeah and the sermon forsaking all
[38:04] [Music]
[38:05] 1962 paragraph
[38:07] 76 I know yall don't know me some going
[38:10] do this usually I
[38:11] don't tell where I'm getting it from but
[38:13] tonight I'm going to my first time here
[38:15] Jesus said on the scripture said he that
[38:18] loves the world or things of the world
[38:21] the love of God is not in him right it
[38:23] takes forsaking all there when you are
[38:27] with willing to forsake all and follow
[38:29] him then see forsaking all the rich man
[38:34] could not give up his riches he could
[38:37] not forsake something and that's the way
[38:39] it is with us a lot of times we forget
[38:41] that forsaking all means getting rid of
[38:46] everything you know I was listening to
[38:48] some uh gospel singers a what few years
[38:51] back and they told me that they or it
[38:54] was on the radio they said that they got
[38:55] their inspiration from country and
[38:57] western
[38:58] music now this is Southern gospel
[39:01] country and western What Spirit was
[39:03] behind that yeah brother it's not a good
[39:05] one right they would not forsake the
[39:08] worldly things amen now John 15:1 says I
[39:13] am the True Vine the father and my
[39:15] father is the husbandman every branch in
[39:17] me that beareth not fruit he taketh away
[39:20] and every branch that beareth fruit he
[39:22] purgeth it that it may bring forth more
[39:26] fruit now you can
[39:29] cling now ye are cling through the word
[39:32] which I have spoken unto you abide in me
[39:36] and I in you and the branch cannot be
[39:38] bear fruit except it abide in the vine
[39:41] no one can ye except ye abide in
[39:44] me I am the vine ye are the branches he
[39:48] that abideth in me and I in him the same
[39:51] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[39:54] you can do nothing amen now we know who
[39:56] he is right right he's the word John 1:1
[40:00] if a man abideth not in me he is cast
[40:04] forth as a branch and is withered and
[40:07] Men gather them and cast them into the
[40:09] fire and they are burned if you abide in
[40:11] me and my words abide in you ye shall
[40:15] ask what you will and it shall be done
[40:18] unto you now how many believe God's
[40:21] bring us a perfect word in this age amen
[40:24] how many of you here is filled with the
[40:25] Holy Ghost
[40:27] amen some of this isn't for you
[40:31] then amen because you have forsaken
[40:36] all is that right you have forsaken your
[40:39] own thoughts you have forsaken your own
[40:41] ideas you have forsaken everything that
[40:44] the world has come at you with to follow
[40:49] Christ is that right so if we have
[40:52] forsaken
[40:54] everything then we can ask God anything
[40:57] we want within his will and we can have
[41:01] it if we can believe amen I believe God
[41:05] said he would come to us yes and give us
[41:09] all that we have need of he says he not
[41:12] forsake his people is that right right
[41:15] you got a
[41:16] need then ask him for
[41:19] it if you have a need I'm going to say
[41:22] it again ask him for it but then what
[41:24] are you going to do when you ask him for
[41:26] it you've got to Bo believe what does
[41:28] that mean that means forsaking every
[41:30] other thought that would come into your
[41:32] mind that would cause you to doubt
[41:35] [Applause]
[41:38] that oh my you have to forsake
[41:42] it you know we got
[41:46] people I preach for a little while not
[41:49] too long I guess like some of these
[41:51] ministers here but have a little
[41:53] bit but have come across people that
[41:57] want to serve God yeah without forsaking
[42:02] everything amen they're still hanging on
[42:05] to things of the
[42:06] world and then they want to know why or
[42:10] wonder why their life isn't in the
[42:13] position it should be when they have a
[42:16] need amen now don't take what I'm saying
[42:20] wrong we all go through cows and
[42:22] tribulations amen that don't mean you're
[42:24] not doing what God wants but there's too
[42:26] many of us that sometimes we get to that
[42:29] place that we have not forsaken
[42:31] everything to the place God can move
[42:34] through us and when we talk to him and
[42:36] we ask him something he gives it to
[42:39] us
[42:41] amen listen to
[42:46] this John 15:17 says if you abide in me
[42:50] and my
[42:51] words my words abide in
[42:54] you ye shall ask what you will and it
[42:57] shall be done unto
[42:58] you if what abides in me his word well
[43:01] who's the word Jesus Christ where did
[43:04] that come from he went to heaven he's
[43:06] sitting on the right hand of God what is
[43:07] it that life that was in him as the
[43:10] spirit of God came back down on the day
[43:12] of Pentecost is now is in
[43:15] you amen then if that is in you the word
[43:18] is in you you cannot deny one thing that
[43:22] the Bible says or the prophet said that
[43:25] when God sent a prophet to very ver ify
[43:27] that word to us is that right now if you
[43:32] have
[43:33] doubts you need to get on your knees and
[43:35] find out where the doubts are coming
[43:36] from or you need to do what the Bible
[43:39] says and cast those things down and
[43:42] leave them there by the side of the
[43:45] road hearing my father is glorified that
[43:48] ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my
[43:54] disciples going back into forsaking all
[43:56] again in 62 brother brand if you've not
[43:59] listened to the sermon for a while you
[44:00] need to go back and listen to it it's
[44:02] just phenomenal sermon I think amen if
[44:06] he says if you abide in
[44:08] me my words in you you can ask what you
[44:11] will and it will be done for you but you
[44:14] cannot knowing that those things are
[44:17] wrong you know they're
[44:19] wrong so if you're doing something you
[44:21] know is wrong you can't ask
[44:28] now let me give you just a few things he
[44:30] says is
[44:31] wrong the Bible is against them card
[44:36] playing cigarette smoking drinking
[44:39] wearing inmoral clothes and then
[44:41] claiming to be a Christian if that
[44:43] spirit in you does not condemn that then
[44:47] there is something wrong with that with
[44:49] the spirit that's in you good well that
[44:52] means there's a different spirit
[44:57] because the word of God wrote the word
[45:01] God who wrote the word is the word the
[45:04] word is in you and it condemns you it's
[45:08] got to and if it doesn't you are being
[45:13] deceived now let me ask you something I
[45:15] don't want no one to raise their hands
[45:17] here how many of us have ever done
[45:20] things we know we shouldn't have done
[45:22] and paid for it I'm going to raise my
[45:24] hand cuz I know I
[45:25] have amen amen like I said I'm not
[45:28] asking you to raise your hands but I
[45:30] have you pay for it because God will
[45:33] discipline you if you're his
[45:35] child is that right he says he
[45:38] disciplines every one of his children
[45:39] that comes to him and if you're not
[45:42] being disciplined by God you're none of
[45:44] his that's right amen well I enjoy the
[45:47] discipline amen I enjoy it more if I
[45:50] don't need the
[45:54] discipline amen
[45:57] now you can he says you're being
[45:59] deceived how can the Holy Spirit write
[46:02] something and you turn around and do
[46:04] contrary to it and the Holy Spirit is
[46:08] leading you you can't do it see you
[46:11] can't you can't say rock and roll of the
[46:15] world or is of god rock and roll is of
[46:18] the
[46:19] world Amen now I want to stop there just
[46:22] for a minute cuz all you people that's
[46:23] listening to the message brother brandom
[46:25] didn't say rock and roll lyrics
[46:28] right
[46:29] brother he said rock and roll
[46:33] music and I notied that some so-called
[46:36] gospel music has went rock and
[46:39] roll amen there's a spirit behind it
[46:44] yeah
[46:47] am some of us enjoy the spirit that's
[46:51] behind some of the
[46:55] music I'm just being honest here if your
[46:58] pastor thinks I'm wrong he can correct
[46:59] it then I'll take it but it's the truth
[47:04] anyway as far as I
[47:07] know rock and roll is wrong just like
[47:11] country and
[47:14] western true you got such an anointed
[47:17] song leaders around here that come up
[47:18] here and
[47:20] leaden that's what you need you want to
[47:22] dance to something there's something to
[47:23] dance to God will give you a Spirit of
[47:25] Dance
[47:29] listen to this
[47:32] real see you can't you can't say rock
[47:35] and roll is of god rock and roll is of
[47:37] the world any of those dances and
[47:40] filtered nasty filthy things rather is
[47:43] out of the world it's all of the world
[47:47] you can't say bobbed hair for women is
[47:50] of God the Bible says it isn't so it's
[47:53] the filth of the world if you love The
[47:55] One Speck of the world the love of God
[47:57] is not even in you can I say something
[47:59] else I hope I don't hurt no one's
[48:00] feelings I believe we're all all right
[48:02] here we're grown a little bit but you
[48:05] also can't connect yourself to an
[48:08] unbeliever in
[48:12] marriage
[48:14] amen come
[48:15] on if you're flirting around with
[48:18] worldly women or men or boys or girls or
[48:21] whoever you are you are going into a
[48:24] very dangerous area
[48:28] that's going to cause you such a
[48:31] harm
[48:34] spiritually and you better be careful
[48:37] even if they claim to be a Christian
[48:39] because I know a lady girl I know
[48:40] several people that married so-called
[48:42] Christian boys they found out that they
[48:44] weren't so
[48:46] Christian and they end up single by
[48:49] themselves raising
[48:51] children
[48:53] prayer what what am I trying to say c
[48:56] cast down all reasoning cast down
[49:00] anything that's contrary to the word of
[49:02] God and lift yourself up into his
[49:06] word look at who he
[49:12] is like I said I hope I don't hurt no
[49:14] one's feelings
[49:17] [Music]
[49:25] but I've skipped a lot already
[49:29] but I know we got
[49:32] to he said what's that well that's
[49:36] drawing it it's drawing something down
[49:41] on the
[49:42] inside drawing I like what brother Brown
[49:45] puts this the soul is drawing your
[49:47] resource through the
[49:49] outside down through the spirit into the
[49:52] soul and if the soul loves the world
[49:54] it's deaden
[49:57] so I like to check myself every so often
[50:00] what is my spirit drawing on is it
[50:03] drawing on the world that's good is it
[50:05] drawing on
[50:06] movies more than it is the word of God
[50:10] is it drawing on the worldly things and
[50:12] the things out there that we shouldn't
[50:14] be drawing on oh my you know I like what
[50:17] your pastor said just the other Sunday I
[50:19] believe it was the other Sunday it was
[50:20] one of the Sundays anyway how many times
[50:23] are you reading your
[50:24] Bible you know I I people say oh I read
[50:27] my Bible every day you find out they
[50:29] read one
[50:32] verse that's not enough
[50:36] right or how how often have you prayed
[50:39] this week oh we pray every day when we
[50:41] go to bed for five minutes if they get
[50:44] lucky for
[50:46] five and then they want to know
[50:50] why their spiritual life is
[50:54] dead they're drawing on the RO wrong
[50:56] things they're not talking to the God
[50:59] right they're not listening to what God
[51:01] has to say to them you know why they're
[51:03] not listening they can't hear him any
[51:10] longer forsaking
[51:16] all he says if the soul loves the world
[51:19] it's dead I don't care how it's
[51:23] anointed anointed ones at the end time
[51:25] just go back and listen to that and if
[51:26] you don't what he's talking about here
[51:28] my father was one of
[51:30] those very anointed man behind the pull
[51:33] pit seeing people
[51:35] healed curse you out after
[51:41] church so I know what I'm talking but I
[51:43] live through
[51:45] it and and it confused me as a kid amen
[51:49] and I went into the world because of and
[51:51] I told God I don't know what's right and
[51:53] wrong so I'm till you can show me I'm
[51:55] I'm leaving and
[51:57] did for a long time God kept drawing on
[52:00] me and I kept pushing him away he kept
[52:01] drawing I kept pushing him away but he
[52:04] made a liar out of me because he didn't
[52:05] show me what was right until after I got
[52:07] saved and then he led me to that sermon
[52:10] anointed ones at the end
[52:14] time God make you a
[52:19] liar you think you can do whatever you
[52:21] want to God will make you a liar amen
[52:25] amen actually you're making yourself one
[52:27] but you know what I
[52:29] mean listen to
[52:32] this I said I hope I hope this ain't too
[52:41] harsh he said it's drawing on something
[52:44] it's something down on the inside
[52:45] drawing the soul is drawing your
[52:47] resource through the outside through
[52:50] down through the spirit into the soul
[52:52] and if that soul loves the world it's
[52:54] dead I don't care how it's anointed
[52:58] amen now that's for ministers and I've
[53:01] seen ministers that way but that's not
[53:03] just for ministers that's for Lay people
[53:06] musicians song
[53:09] leaders it's for all of us he's talking
[53:12] to everyone here not just a certain
[53:15] group right so we need to check what
[53:17] we're drawing on I'm talking about
[53:20] myself I have to check what I'm drawing
[53:22] on I don't care how it's anointed it is
[53:26] out here and how religious or righteous
[53:29] it is out here don't care how righteous
[53:32] it looks down in here it's dead for he
[53:35] that loves the world or the things of
[53:37] the world the love of God is not even in
[53:39] him no matter how
[53:41] religious right he says the true filter
[53:44] that way will set all those things out
[53:47] and bring nothing but tress of God the
[53:50] word into the real true Soul if you want
[53:55] to know what he's talking about filters
[53:56] there most of us probably listen to it
[53:58] thank you man's filter go listen to it
[53:59] it's very good
[54:03] sermon then how do we get into the real
[54:06] word of God how do we get it let's just
[54:10] go to 1 Corinthians 1213 you ministers
[54:13] know where I'm going for by one
[54:17] Spirit you are all baptized into one
[54:20] body whether you be jew or Gentile
[54:23] whether you be Bond or free and have all
[54:25] been made to drink into one one one
[54:30] Spirit not two Spirits not a worldly
[54:33] spirit in his can't serve two masters
[54:37] one
[54:41] Spirit whether you be Bond or
[54:44] free or have all been made to drink into
[54:47] one
[54:48] Spirit First Corinthians 10 or 2
[54:51] Corinthians 10:1 now Paul myself beseech
[54:54] you by the meekness and gentleness of
[54:56] Christ
[54:57] who in the presence am among based among
[55:00] you but being absent and bold toward
[55:04] you I like that because it makes it
[55:06] sound like he's talking to me he's
[55:08] absent from me but here he is Paul's
[55:10] talking to me
[55:13] tonight but I beseech you that I may not
[55:15] be bold when I am present with
[55:19] you that confidence wherewith I think to
[55:22] be bold against some which think
[55:27] of us as if we walked according to the
[55:30] flesh for though we walk in the flesh we
[55:33] do not war after the flesh is that right
[55:37] right for the weapons of our Warfare are
[55:40] not carnal But Mighty through
[55:42] God to pulling down of
[55:46] strongholds now this is a huge key here
[55:48] he's going to tell you how to pull them
[55:49] down you young people need to listen to
[55:52] this casting down imaginations so do you
[55:55] older people yeah and I'm talking about
[55:57] myself too and every High thing
[56:02] yeah not just the low things every High
[56:07] thing that exalteth itself against the
[56:10] knowledge of God and bringing into
[56:13] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[56:17] of
[56:18] Christ amen what's Christ the anointing
[56:21] what's the anointing the spirit of God
[56:23] bringing all things into C captivity
[56:27] every thought to The Obedience of Christ
[56:30] and having in a Readiness to Revenge all
[56:34] Disobedience when your obedience is
[56:37] fulfilled now I wanted to look at a
[56:38] couple of words
[56:41] here in verse six it says
[56:43] Revenge I looked it up in the
[56:46] Greek to vindicate one's right do one
[56:51] Justice to protect
[56:54] defend having in all read in Readiness
[56:57] to Revenge all what Disobedience listen
[57:00] to what that word
[57:01] means a hearing a
[57:10] misso casting down
[57:14] all
[57:17] imaginations the hearing a
[57:21] Miss how many times have we listened to
[57:24] ministers
[57:27] you know because I I stream some every
[57:29] once in a while I'm talking about
[57:31] nominal ones because some of them's got
[57:32] some good thoughts I I I listen to
[57:34] there's a few I'm listen to once in a
[57:35] while but if you listen close you hear a
[57:40] Miss what do I do with that I cast it
[57:43] down
[57:45] amen amen amen sure brother casting down
[57:54] anything but look look I like the way he
[57:56] says it
[57:58] here and having in a Readiness to
[58:02] Revenge amen revenge is
[58:06] hard I mean we're talking
[58:09] about to do one's Justice to avenge a
[58:12] thing to
[58:15] punish how do you punish in a Miss
[58:18] because you cast it down you stomp on it
[58:21] you get rid of
[58:23] it what about healing you know we've
[58:26] talked about healing here at the church
[58:27] before and I know your pastor done a lot
[58:30] better job than I'm going to do tonight
[58:31] on it but
[58:33] healing how do you get healed amen well
[58:37] by everyone says Oh by faith faith does
[58:40] it it that's true and I'm not making
[58:42] light of that fa but what's Faith what's
[58:45] believing what's
[58:46] believing casting down anything that's
[58:49] contrary to it
[58:51] am brother brandom says in in the let me
[58:56] go back over
[59:00] here like I said I skipped quite a
[59:04] bit but then the unveiling of God I
[59:07] believe it was the sermon go listen to
[59:09] it he says to look to get what you need
[59:12] he says you got to do something he says
[59:14] he's talking about when he had to throw
[59:15] the stone up in the air and it started a
[59:18] whirlwind well here there's another
[59:20] sermon I can't remember which one it is
[59:22] you brothers that are ministers and read
[59:24] the sermons you'll know what I'm talking
[59:25] about but also said that in one of the
[59:27] prayer lines he had he had Tommy Osman
[59:30] come
[59:31] up in a prayer help him
[59:34] pray and he says Tommy Tommy asked said
[59:37] may I may I say something he says sure
[59:38] brother so Tommy gets up behind the mic
[59:41] and he goes
[59:42] brother and he says now when you come up
[59:45] to get prayed for he says if you've got
[59:48] a you know something wrong with you
[59:50] start using
[59:52] it if you got a bad hand or an arm you
[59:54] know start moving it
[59:58] amen don't just get prayed for and walk
[1:00:00] away like
[1:00:07] this you've got to do something you've
[1:00:10] got to exercise your
[1:00:13] faith
[1:00:16] amen You Know Jack Co I know a lot of
[1:00:19] people may not have liked him very much
[1:00:20] but brother Brown said he was a good
[1:00:23] man you know I I I've watched several
[1:00:25] his videos there's a woman that had a
[1:00:27] cancer on her
[1:00:29] face you can still see it he goes up and
[1:00:31] he takes this and he starts doing this
[1:00:33] comes off in his
[1:00:36] hand he did
[1:00:40] something there was a man who was
[1:00:42] crippled over bent over like this he
[1:00:44] goes over there behind him grabs him
[1:00:45] puts his knee in his back now I don't
[1:00:46] recommend us doing this don't take what
[1:00:47] I'm saying wrong God's leading this man
[1:00:50] to do it or it wouldn't have done and he
[1:00:51] puts his knee in his bang starts
[1:00:52] straightening him up and bending him
[1:00:53] over straightening him up bending him
[1:00:54] over straighten him up the guy out the
[1:00:56] straight of
[1:01:01] board my point behind that is if Jack
[1:01:04] didn't do it for him he should have done
[1:01:05] it
[1:01:07] himself you start doing what God tells
[1:01:10] you to do because by faith you're
[1:01:12] starting to believe that the word of God
[1:01:14] said do it then he said I by his stripes
[1:01:17] ye were healed not that you're going to
[1:01:19] be healed it's not a futuristic thing
[1:01:21] but you're healed right
[1:01:24] now thank you and I'm just going to be
[1:01:27] real blunt cuz brother your pastor
[1:01:29] already knows I had two shots in my back
[1:01:32] yesterday because I got a real bad
[1:01:34] back but I don't let it stop me cuz the
[1:01:37] doctors told me years ago I should be in
[1:01:39] a
[1:01:40] wheelchair and I refuse the go
[1:01:44] set
[1:01:47] amen and I've told the people that I
[1:01:49] Pastor for all those years if I get in
[1:01:51] the wheelchair God's going to bring me
[1:01:53] out of it
[1:01:56] it's where you're going to put your
[1:01:58] faith are you going to put it in you
[1:02:00] know we got a precious brother in
[1:02:02] Virginia's fighting
[1:02:04] cancer amen he hasn't stopped there
[1:02:08] ain't no one of us should feel sorry for
[1:02:11] ourselves listening to that
[1:02:20] testimony I love that brother he come
[1:02:22] and spoke for us one time in Illinois
[1:02:26] precious
[1:02:33] brother love brother
[1:02:37] Spencer may not know this but even got
[1:02:40] brother from Tennessee to come and speak
[1:02:43] for us once answered a lot of questions
[1:02:45] for
[1:02:51] us forsaking all and those Brothers come
[1:02:54] with nothing because we had nothing they
[1:02:56] paid their own way and
[1:02:58] came we were such a small
[1:03:01] church I mean we give them something but
[1:03:03] it wasn't near
[1:03:07] enough God to bless him for that in
[1:03:10] eternity forsaking all let's get back to
[1:03:13] this I'm
[1:03:14] sorry there when you are willing to
[1:03:17] forsake all and follow him then if ye
[1:03:20] abide in me and my word abides in you
[1:03:22] whatever you ask shall be done Mark
[1:03:24] 16:14 and I'm going to close it out with
[1:03:26] this
[1:03:27] here but I want you to listen carefully
[1:03:29] afterwards he appeared into the 11 as
[1:03:31] they sat at meat and up braided them
[1:03:34] with their
[1:03:36] unbelief and Hardness of Heart because
[1:03:38] they belied not them which had seen him
[1:03:41] after he was risen that's very important
[1:03:44] because some of us went in brother
[1:03:46] bram's
[1:03:48] meetings none of us was back here during
[1:03:50] Jesus's walk on earth
[1:03:55] but some of us
[1:03:59] believed many more does
[1:04:06] not he up braided them because they
[1:04:08] would not believe what the others had
[1:04:11] seen and he said unto them go ye into
[1:04:14] all the world and preach the gospel to
[1:04:15] Every Creature he that believeth and is
[1:04:18] baptized shall be saved but he that
[1:04:20] believeth not shall be damned and these
[1:04:22] signs shall follow them that believe in
[1:04:25] my name name I ain't pointing to myself
[1:04:28] here Christ in me in my name Jesus
[1:04:31] Christ in my
[1:04:33] name shall they cast out
[1:04:36] Devils they shall speak with new
[1:04:39] tongues they shall take up serpant a lot
[1:04:42] of us got rid of the tongue talking I
[1:04:44] ain't talking about your church here but
[1:04:46] they preach against
[1:04:48] it it
[1:04:51] is because Bible tells us Paul taught us
[1:04:54] that in the pr of our Clos that is an
[1:04:56] intercession for us and him amen amen it
[1:05:00] will intercede for you that spirit of
[1:05:02] God will intercede if you'll let it flow
[1:05:04] he'll intercede for us I woke up in the
[1:05:07] middle of the night one night hearing
[1:05:09] myself speaking to something I didn't
[1:05:11] know what I was
[1:05:14] talking something was interceding for
[1:05:19] me think of that thank you Jesus but
[1:05:23] we've gotten rid of that stuff
[1:05:26] not here I know
[1:05:29] that church world has
[1:05:34] practically they shall speak to with
[1:05:36] Tong they shall take up serpents and if
[1:05:39] they drink any deadly thing it shall not
[1:05:41] hurt them they shall lay hands on the
[1:05:43] sick and they shall
[1:05:45] recover so then after the Lord had
[1:05:47] spoken to them he received up into
[1:05:49] heaven and sit on the right hand of
[1:05:52] God and they went forth and preached
[1:05:55] every everywhere the Lord working with
[1:05:58] them and confirming the word with signs
[1:06:02] following musicians you can come
[1:06:06] forward I've got many more pages here
[1:06:08] but I'm not going to get to it tonight
[1:06:11] because it's going to it'd be
[1:06:13] another hour and a half
[1:06:15] probably so I I put a little note here
[1:06:18] says
[1:06:23] stop I know that most of you know
[1:06:26] this and I'm not preaching to you that
[1:06:29] know it this is a
[1:06:31] reminder amen I'm not trying to PE
[1:06:33] preach you into something you didn't
[1:06:35] know I'm giving you a
[1:06:39] reminder cast down and you have to do
[1:06:41] this every single day of your life
[1:06:46] Satan's not going to stop just because
[1:06:47] you cast it down today tomorrow you're
[1:06:50] going to have to cast it down again
[1:06:52] whatever thought comes to you that is
[1:06:54] not of the word of God H cast it down
[1:06:57] and get rid of it put it
[1:07:01] aside oh
[1:07:05] my
[1:07:07] brother amen Give the Lord a hand clap
[1:07:10] of
[1:07:11] [Applause]
[1:07:13] Praise amen that's all
[1:07:15] stand did you appreciate the word of the
[1:07:18] Lord amen what a u such a simple thought
[1:07:22] to say forsaking all but you know I
[1:07:25] believe that that in this age that we
[1:07:26] live in today it's it's more and more
[1:07:28] important that every day we say Lord I'm
[1:07:30] going to forsake everything I think
[1:07:32] brother brandom in that message forsaken
[1:07:34] all one of my favorite uh quotes in
[1:07:36] there brother brandom talks about you
[1:07:38] might have read it Brother David or
[1:07:39] something close to it but he talks about
[1:07:41] how that we want to he said so many
[1:07:43] times we want to follow Jesus and hold
[1:07:46] on to everything at the same time and he
[1:07:48] says you know sometimes the Lord wants
[1:07:50] you to follow him and let go of let go
[1:07:53] of everything and he says because
[1:07:55] sometimes times you got to put both
[1:07:56] hands on him and you can't put both
[1:07:58] hands on him until you let go of
[1:08:00] everything and say Lord I'm going to let
[1:08:01] it all go so I can hold on to you amen
[1:08:04] you need a promise tonight let go of
[1:08:06] everything and grab a hold with both
[1:08:08] hands amen amen wow my goodness Brother

[1:18:05] tonight here about a year or so ago
[1:18:09] there was a lot going on in my body I
[1:18:11] didn't understand what was going on I

[1:18:17] nauseous all the time I couldn't even
[1:18:19] ride in a car even 20 miles I would get
[1:18:23] so car sick I mean Jason and Debbie
[1:18:26] would have to give me nausea medicine to
[1:18:29] even go to my sister's

[1:18:39] it in half the doctor approved uh we
[1:18:42] couldn't figure out what was wrong So

[1:18:47] prayer and Jason called all the
[1:18:50] ministers up I told
[1:18:53] Jason I just need prayer for my body I
[1:18:56] don't know what's wrong with it and
[1:18:59] that's been about a year or so ago so
[1:19:02] then um I called sister Deborah and I
[1:19:06] said or I think I called Matthew I said
[1:19:09] uh would you like me to help with a
[1:19:11] Christmas little children's program she
[1:19:13] does I'll tell the the birth in the
[1:19:16] manger story on Christmas Eve that was
[1:19:21] Sunday well y'all mostly know I love to
[1:19:24] tell stories stories I don't get nervous
[1:19:27] telling stories I love doing it
[1:19:30] especially Bible
[1:19:32] stories well but I'm a type of person I
[1:19:35] got to know where I'm going and what I'm
[1:19:38] doing before I do it and I kept asking
[1:19:41] Matthew okay Matthew how do I what do
[1:19:43] you want me to
[1:19:45] do out there on the steps that Sunday
[1:19:48] morning Matthew come up he didn't know
[1:19:51] why he did it put his arm around me and
[1:19:55] started praying for me for my
[1:19:57] nerves I thought well okay Matthew I'm
[1:20:00] not
[1:20:02] nervous but something was going on in my
[1:20:05] body when I come out here and most of
[1:20:08] y'all were here and I told that
[1:20:10] Christmas story of the birth of
[1:20:13] Christ there was something going on in
[1:20:15] my body I couldn't explain it it was
[1:20:17] like an anxiety bubbling bubbling
[1:20:20] bubbling and as soon as I left and went
[1:20:23] out of the
[1:20:25] platform my chest hurt the rest of the
[1:20:28] day that wasn't unusual I've had it
[1:20:31] before and it usually I pray and it goes
[1:20:33] away that was on Sunday Monday we had
[1:20:37] Christmas Tuesday I'm wiped out cuz I
[1:20:40] went over to Jason and Debbie's the
[1:20:42] family I'm wiped out and I think well
[1:20:44] it's just I've got a lot going on so
[1:20:48] I'll get up in the morning and I'll feel
[1:20:50] better after a good night's rest I got
[1:20:52] up in the morning on Wednesday morning
[1:20:54] and fullblown own heart attacks and I
[1:20:57] called
[1:20:58] Jason we went to the walk-in clinic they
[1:21:01] sent me to the ER and he called brother
[1:21:03] Andrew and brother Andrew had already
[1:21:05] left the hospital so he called one of
[1:21:08] his doctor friends told him to take care
[1:21:10] of me and he did I wound up I had two
[1:21:14] stance put in my heart I had a 90
[1:21:17] blockage and a 80 blockage which they
[1:21:19] said was a Widow Maker or or Widow wor
[1:21:22] maker
[1:21:25] and you
[1:21:27] know the doctor come in to me that day
[1:21:31] cuz they kept me overnight and I told
[1:21:33] him about Sunday about that going on and
[1:21:37] this is Wednesday he said yeah this is
[1:21:40] Wednesday now God spared my life for
[1:21:43] another year for some reason and I think
[1:21:46] it's all y'all's prayers and I
[1:21:49] definitely think it's Matthew's prayer
[1:21:50] and the church's prayers and for
[1:21:53] whatever reason I'm still here and the
[1:21:55] doctor said yeah and this is Wednesday I
[1:21:59] should have died and that would have
[1:22:01] been okay I mean 83 years old it's okay
