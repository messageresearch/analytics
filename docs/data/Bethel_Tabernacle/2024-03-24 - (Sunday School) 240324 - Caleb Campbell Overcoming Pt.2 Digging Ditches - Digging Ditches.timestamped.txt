[0:00] ye are of God little children and have
[0:03] overcome them because greater is he that
[0:06] is in you than he that is in the world
[0:08] amen amen let's pray Heavenly Father
[0:11] Lord Jesus we just come before you this
[0:13] morning Lord we just pray that father we
[0:16] can come into your presence father we
[0:18] pray that you would anoint the word Lord
[0:20] and just open it up to us father we love
[0:23] you now and we just give you our hearts
[0:25] and Minds now in the name of Jesus
[0:27] Christ amen God bless you as you take
[0:30] your seats this
[0:31] morning we're going to take a a part two
[0:34] this morning from the last time we spoke
[0:37] our subject was overcoming um I may have
[0:40] a few things that sound familiar from
[0:42] last time but most of it is new material
[0:45] I I uh I'm hoping to get get to all my
[0:48] notes but I I don't want to rush through
[0:50] things so it's hard having a burden and
[0:52] trying to put it in 30 minutes Amen
[0:55] brother Benham says this in how can I
[0:57] overcome he says overcome means to
[1:00] recognize the devil in every one of his
[1:03] tricks a lot of people said there is no
[1:05] devil it's just a thought don't you
[1:08] believe that there's a real devil he's
[1:10] just as real as you are or anybody a
[1:13] real devil and you must recognize him
[1:16] real you must know he's a devil then the
[1:19] same time that you recognize him and
[1:21] know that he's a devil and he's against
[1:23] you then to overcome you must recognize
[1:28] that the god in you is greater and
[1:31] mightier than he is that the one that's
[1:34] in you has already overcome him amen and
[1:39] by his grace you are more than a match
[1:42] for him the devil amen that's real
[1:46] overcoming when you recognize you look
[1:48] back and say I'm doing this I'm doing
[1:50] that then no you're defeated but there's
[1:52] no condemnation to them which are in
[1:55] Christ Jesus that walk not after the
[1:57] flesh but after the spirit then you
[1:59] realize you overcome and you know that
[2:01] he is a devil and a little bit further
[2:03] down he says You must realize that the
[2:06] Holy Spirit that's in you has already
[2:08] overcome this thing and he's in you and
[2:10] you overcome by him that's exactly
[2:14] sensible it's exactly the way the
[2:16] scripture is written overcoming so and
[2:19] we talked a little bit last time on the
[2:21] key to overcoming it's it's Jesus Christ
[2:24] Living in you living out of you and
[2:26] that's the badge that you show the devil
[2:28] when he comes against you the holy ghost
[2:30] amen you know brother Matt did a a great
[2:32] job of breaking this down Wednesday
[2:34] night Christ in you the hope of glory
[2:37] he's already overcome everything you're
[2:40] just walking in the footsteps he's laid
[2:42] out for you in your life and you know we
[2:45] touched on overcoming when it comes to
[2:47] our thought life specifically thoughts
[2:49] towards our brothers or our sisters in
[2:52] the Lord and how the devil can sneak
[2:54] into our life and grab a hold of the
[2:58] flaws and the failures of our brothers
[3:00] and our sisters and then start
[3:02] magnifying those things and if we're not
[3:04] careful we begin start to start
[3:07] tolerating those thoughts and eventually
[3:10] that leads to embracing those thoughts
[3:13] and then that leads to strife and
[3:15] disunity if you begin to tolerate and
[3:18] embrace I had this scripture last time
[3:20] on my heart I didn't get to it 1
[3:22] Thessalonians 51 says wherefore Comfort
[3:26] yourselves together and edify one
[3:28] another even as also so ye do and we
[3:31] beseech you Brethren to know them which
[3:34] labor among you and are over you in the
[3:37] Lord and admonish you and to esteem them
[3:40] very highly in love for their work sake
[3:43] and be at peace among yourselves verse
[3:46] 14 says now we exhort you Brethren warn
[3:48] them warn them that are unruly Comfort
[3:51] the feeble-minded support the weak and
[3:54] be patient towards all men I wanted to
[3:57] capitalize on that scripture be patient
[3:59] towards all men I heard brother Chris
[4:01] Kathy speak about it in his sermon
[4:03] several weeks ago I thought it was worth
[4:04] repeating don't discredit someone in
[4:08] their walk if they're not where you're
[4:10] at in your Christian walk amen we be
[4:12] patient towards all men we're all coming
[4:15] into our position in Jesus Christ and
[4:17] we're all now you know we're all moving
[4:19] into that place we're all coming into
[4:21] our maturity amen and some may be
[4:24] further along or have more experience
[4:27] but we're all believers and we're all
[4:29] working towards the same common goal and
[4:32] that scripture says to be patient
[4:34] towards all men so if a brother or a
[4:36] sister maybe isn't where they need to be
[4:38] pray for them amen spiritual maturity
[4:41] doesn't just happen overnight amen of
[4:43] course the Holy Ghost will set in order
[4:46] things in people's life but every war is
[4:49] B is is one one battle at a time amen we
[4:54] can't think lowly of our brothers or our
[4:55] Sisters in Christ if they do something
[4:57] wrong forgive them care about them love
[5:01] them and think about it the way that God
[5:04] thinks about you forgive them the way
[5:05] God forgave you
[5:08] amen the brothers were uh going through
[5:11] this sermon we've been they've been
[5:13] going through this sermon on Thursday
[5:14] nights and I heard this quote this past
[5:16] Thursday and it struck me he says in
[5:18] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[5:20] paragraph 866 says if the brother if you
[5:23] think he's a little wrong or the sister
[5:25] say Lord don't let me never have the
[5:28] root of bitterness spring up CU it'll
[5:30] affect him and it'll take the Christ
[5:33] right out of your life that poison acids
[5:37] of malice and jealousy and hatred that
[5:39] will just take the Holy Spirit right
[5:42] away from you it'll run him from the
[5:44] Tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of
[5:47] God or drive it away from here hurt your
[5:49] pastor it'll do everything see don't do
[5:52] that amen we have to be so conscious of
[5:56] how we speak towards one another brother
[5:59] bom says if we're not careful it'll take
[6:01] Christ right out of our Lives I don't
[6:03] want Christ out of my life amen and all
[6:05] of those things those things that he
[6:07] mentioned there malice and jealousy and
[6:08] hatred and bitterness all of those
[6:11] things begin they spring up in your mind
[6:14] as a simple thought maybe against an
[6:17] individual whether they did something
[6:19] wrong or not and it takes an active
[6:22] decision in your life to Captivate that
[6:25] thing you give it to the Holy Ghost and
[6:27] then he puts it down amen you take those
[6:29] thoughts captive in the name of
[6:33] God otherwise it grows and it becomes
[6:36] Strife amen because I believe the Lord
[6:39] wants to do more in our life I believe
[6:41] he wants to do more wants to do more in
[6:43] my life I believe he wants to do more in
[6:45] your life amen but our thought process
[6:48] is still in this Earthly realm so often
[6:51] times and if we can just start putting
[6:54] on the goggles of the Lord Jesus Christ
[6:57] and start looking through those goggles
[7:00] at everybody in our life look I look at
[7:02] you and I look at you I look at all my
[7:04] brothers and sisters through the goggles
[7:05] that Jesus Christ looks through because
[7:07] brother renom says that he looks at you
[7:09] through the blood so all he sees is the
[7:11] perfected work amen so if we start
[7:14] looking at each other through that same
[7:16] perfected work because we are written
[7:19] Epistles read of all men amen we are
[7:21] Sons and Daughters of Christ so if we
[7:22] put on those lenses and start looking at
[7:25] your brother maybe they're not where
[7:26] they need to be but pray them there pray
[7:29] them where they need to be and God will
[7:31] be faithful to get them where they need
[7:32] to be amen you remember um I heard I
[7:36] heard a brother talking about this uh uh
[7:39] about Peter several several months ago
[7:41] and those Believers there in the upper
[7:42] room how they were in one mind and one
[7:44] Accord you know that means they weren't
[7:46] thinking about the person's flaws or
[7:49] about their past failures or about what
[7:51] that person did or that person did or
[7:53] what this person said or what this
[7:55] preacher may have said you know they
[7:57] were they had reached a point in that
[7:59] upper room it took them a long time but
[8:01] they reached a point in that upper room
[8:02] where they were in a real Unity among
[8:05] each other and they had finally reached
[8:07] that point where they weren't thinking
[8:09] about each other anymore they were
[8:11] thinking about Christ they had Christ's
[8:13] lenses on in that upper room that day
[8:16] amen and you know they had a whole lot
[8:18] of failures to look past especially
[8:21] because they were talking about Peter
[8:22] especially Peter I mean he this guy he
[8:24] failed a lot he he denied Christ he
[8:27] cursed I mean on the last day that
[8:30] Christ was was alive or the last couple
[8:32] of days imagine you you look at someone
[8:34] and you say why you you know you denied
[8:36] Christ how many times in our life we go
[8:38] through those things and we look at
[8:40] somebody you denied Christ look we need
[8:42] to start looking at the finished product
[8:44] amen they had to take that thought into
[8:46] captivity because Peter became the
[8:49] spokesperson of Pentecost and they had
[8:51] to get past that thought
[8:53] process amen and in this evil day that
[8:56] we live in we have to actively apply
[8:59] apply those scriptures every day in our
[9:01] life to the to those mind battles we
[9:03] face not not just hearing the word but
[9:05] applying it and being active in the
[9:07] principles we hear read over the pulpit
[9:09] or read in our homes or listen to it to
[9:11] a tape and and really step into it um my
[9:15] subject this morning was overcoming and
[9:16] then my um my subtitle was digging
[9:21] ditches uh I was listening to the
[9:23] prophet the other day brother brandom
[9:25] takes a text out of 2 Kings chapter 3
[9:28] where the king of Edom the king of Judah
[9:32] and the king of Israel were all at a
[9:34] time and they were together and they
[9:36] were seeking help against their common
[9:38] Enemy at the time and they were afraid
[9:42] that their enemy the king of Moab were
[9:44] going to overtake all three of their
[9:46] armies so they inquired of the prophet
[9:49] in the land at the time which was Elisha
[9:52] and then Elisha inquired of the Lord and
[9:55] how Elisha inquired of the lord it's
[9:57] really a cool Story 2 Kings chapter 3 I
[9:59] recommend you go and read it but he had
[10:01] a minstral playing and the presence of
[10:04] the Lord came into the into that place
[10:06] and spoke to Elisha and the word that
[10:09] came from the Lord was make this Valley
[10:13] full of
[10:14] ditches so he inquired of the Lord about
[10:17] this battle that was going to take place
[10:18] and about this this storm that was going
[10:20] on in their life and he said the Lord
[10:22] said make this Valley full of ditches
[10:24] and the Lord said in that scripture he
[10:27] said it's not going to come by rain
[10:29] there's not going to be any any wi so in
[10:32] other words he wasn't going to do
[10:33] anything in the natural way that we
[10:35] think it's going to take place it was
[10:37] going to be a supernatural means that he
[10:39] was going to H it was going to take
[10:41] place
[10:43] in and he says you will defeat the
[10:46] entire Army but there is a work for you
[10:49] to do they had a task at hand and I I
[10:53] want to paraphrase the quote brother
[10:54] random says just for time sake but
[10:56] brother random said that the main
[10:58] principle
[10:59] was to prepare for the water to come
[11:04] amen and to get the ditches dug out in
[11:08] the land at that time amen so if you
[11:11] think about this you see God is going to
[11:13] move in our lives he's going to overcome
[11:16] every enemy that you will ever Face
[11:18] bottom line period he will over he's
[11:21] already done it so you will overcome
[11:23] that thing but sometimes it takes
[11:26] actively digging your ditches in your
[11:28] life and what that means is is he's
[11:30] going to provide the water he's going to
[11:32] provide the word he's going to provide
[11:34] the weapons all of it but we've got to
[11:37] make ready for that water to come we've
[11:39] got to make ready for the Holy Ghost to
[11:41] pour out into our lives so there's
[11:43] something young people old people
[11:45] there's something for you to do as well
[11:47] in your life you got to start digging
[11:49] those ditches in your home spiritually
[11:51] speaking you know the we've always we're
[11:54] always talking about how we've got to
[11:55] empty out so he can come and fill us and
[11:58] once we've once we've received the
[12:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost he wants to
[12:02] give us
[12:05] more you more you receive that now
[12:08] you're placed into that position and you
[12:10] you'll never be able to be separated
[12:12] from the love of God Amen but you're
[12:14] always stepping higher into the maturity
[12:16] of Christ amen you're always coming into
[12:18] a a furtherance of God and so you've got
[12:21] to dig ditches what that means you got
[12:24] to dig out those thoughts against your
[12:27] brothers or your sisters you got to dig
[12:29] out those indifferences that you feel
[12:31] towards one another you know you see cuz
[12:33] it's a two-fold process that takes place
[12:35] you see when you when you get a shovel
[12:37] just physically speaking you go get a
[12:39] shovel and you start digging into the
[12:41] ground you start running into things
[12:43] amen that a shovel eventually cannot get
[12:47] out of the ground you start running into
[12:49] Roots you start running into trees but
[12:52] what you've done now is you've exposed
[12:55] that thing so something greater can come
[12:58] into that place and extract that so
[13:01] sometimes we've got things in our life
[13:03] we've got trials we've got mind battles
[13:06] we've got weaknesses we've got doubts
[13:08] you got to expose that thing to the Holy
[13:10] Ghost and you got to dig that ditch and
[13:12] say God I can't do this by myself but
[13:15] I'm going to expose this thing to God
[13:17] right now I want to expose this I'm
[13:19] going to be vulnerable for you so that
[13:21] you can come in and take the Holy Ghost
[13:23] Machinery that you have and extract that
[13:26] thing out of my life and then not leave
[13:28] it that way because God doesn't want to
[13:30] leave you an empty hole in the ground he
[13:32] wants to fill you he wants to pour out
[13:34] his Spirit he wants to give you without
[13:37] measure his spirit amen so when you
[13:40] start running into those things you're
[13:41] going to run into roots in your life
[13:43] where you cannot get out of it by
[13:45] yourself you're going to run into trials
[13:47] you're going to run into anxiety you're
[13:49] going to run into doubts that you cannot
[13:51] extract by yourself but what you do is
[13:54] you start digging that thing out and you
[13:55] say God I can't do this by myself but I
[13:58] know that greater is he that is in me
[14:01] than he that is in the world so you
[14:03] start extracting it you start being
[14:05] vulnerable Lord I know I'm too weak but
[14:08] I know that you're strong and you're
[14:09] living in me so father I give it to you
[14:12] and then he starts pulling that thing
[14:13] out and it's just as easy as that for
[14:16] him to do but he needs you to expose
[14:19] that thing to him amen he's not going to
[14:21] come in and he's not going to push you
[14:23] through a pipe like brother Jason always
[14:24] says quoting brother brand he's not
[14:26] going to do that he's got to have you do
[14:28] something too amen yes
[14:31] amen but God will do the
[14:35] rest young people don't get caught up in
[14:39] your mind that you're a failure in life
[14:41] because you're struggling with something
[14:44] don't let the devil keep that thing
[14:46] hidden in your heart don't let that
[14:49] happen you give that thing over to God
[14:52] and he will do his part he will do his
[14:56] part amen but he needs you to open up to
[14:59] him he needs you to be vulnerable so
[15:02] that he can come in and he can get rid
[15:04] of that thing amen you just start
[15:07] digging you expose that
[15:09] thing and then even better he'll pour
[15:12] His Spirit out in that place in that
[15:15] thing in your in the anger in your life
[15:17] in the resentment in your life and those
[15:19] things you're going to just start
[15:21] expressing God you're going to start
[15:23] expressing love you're going to start
[15:25] expressing the attributes of Christ
[15:27] because you are written Epistles read of
[15:28] all men in and God wants to work through
[15:31] you that's how he works on this world he
[15:34] works through his sons and his daughters
[15:37] so you can take something like a root of
[15:39] bitterness you can take those things
[15:41] anger that you used to struggle with you
[15:43] can take the anxiety you can take those
[15:45] things and say I know I want struggle
[15:47] with that and maybe sometimes they come
[15:49] in because roots are buried deep down
[15:52] inside but and sometimes they feel like
[15:54] they still got hold but you can say God
[15:56] I know you delivered me here you can do
[15:58] it again again I need you here amen wow
[16:02] you got
[16:03] to empty out so that that that gusher
[16:07] brother bom calls it a gusher of the
[16:09] Holy Ghost can pour into our lives have
[16:12] prayer meetings in your home with your
[16:14] family start digging those ditches take
[16:17] the time to pray with your kids confess
[16:19] your wrongs to your wife to your husband
[16:21] confess those things give it out there
[16:24] put it out there so that God can come in
[16:26] and and do something listen to tapes in
[16:28] your home get rid of the distractions
[16:30] and the carnalities because the prophet
[16:32] says it like this there's coming a
[16:34] gusher if you'll get ready for it but if
[16:37] you don't make ready for it you'll never
[16:40] see it I want to see it don't you he
[16:44] says lay aside everything every sin that
[16:46] so easily besets you he says acting as
[16:49] if someone he was talking just he says
[16:51] brother random I don't do nothing and
[16:53] he's just asking if meaning as if
[16:55] someone's talking to him brother random
[16:57] I don't do nothing and he's answering
[16:59] himself and he says maybe that's what's
[17:01] the matter that's the trouble of it it's
[17:04] more sin not to do than it is to do good
[17:08] and know better that's right he that
[17:10] knoweth to do good and doeth it not to
[17:13] him it sin you've got to make ready
[17:17] doing nothing is the worst you can do if
[17:20] you don't if you come to church and you
[17:22] sit on a Pew every Sunday and every
[17:24] Wednesday but you don't dig those
[17:26] ditches in your life every other day of
[17:28] the week then it just becomes a seat and
[17:30] a Pew on a church You' got to dig those
[17:33] things in your life you got to be
[17:35] willing to expose the flaws you got to
[17:38] be willing to expose your failures to
[17:40] God so that he can extract those things
[17:42] from you
[17:44] amen we ought to dig those overcoming
[17:46] ditches you know we know that the water
[17:49] is going to come and I love that story
[17:51] second Kings chapter 3 go read it this
[17:53] week I love that story there in the Old
[17:54] Testament because God uses a
[17:57] supernatural means
[17:59] that creating the water to gush in in a
[18:01] dry and a desolate desert and he used
[18:04] that water to deceive the enemy listen
[18:07] he says because when the mo when the
[18:09] moabites when that enemy started to come
[18:12] it it said it was in the morning time so
[18:13] the sun rose and the sun just as the sun
[18:16] was Rising it was it was pointing at
[18:18] that water and as it was pointing at
[18:20] that water it was almost like a mirage
[18:23] and it says that it looked like that it
[18:24] was blood so he was deceiving the enemy
[18:27] because now the enemy thought that those
[18:29] three armies had fought each other so
[18:31] they went down to take the spoils of
[18:34] that of those three it was the
[18:36] Israelites and uh the kingdom
[18:39] of Judah they went down to take the
[18:41] spoils because they thought they fought
[18:42] each other so they were completely
[18:44] unprepared for that fight and they went
[18:46] down there unprepared and the Israelites
[18:49] ran defeated them ran them into their
[18:51] armies so sometimes the very thing that
[18:54] God is wanting you to do it's it's to
[18:55] use it to defeat the enemy with and a
[18:58] lot of s and I just to just to be so
[19:01] transparent a lot of times you've got to
[19:03] dig those things so the water can flow
[19:06] in because they were given a word now
[19:09] listen here they were given a word and
[19:11] it wasn't something that they understood
[19:13] you know at the T we can look at
[19:15] scriptures and we can see at that time
[19:18] now now we've got a full picture of it
[19:20] this is why God did this he did this
[19:22] because he needed to deceive the enemy
[19:24] and then he was going to use that to
[19:26] have the Israelites drive it but we we
[19:29] look at that now but sometimes God
[19:32] imagine being in their position you want
[19:34] me to dig ditches I need you to fight
[19:36] that enemy what do you mean I we're
[19:38] going to dig some ditches God needs you
[19:40] to do something in your life maybe that
[19:42] we don't understand amen we don't always
[19:46] understand they weren't given a full
[19:47] picture of understanding it wasn't
[19:50] something for them to understand they
[19:52] needed to trust God's plan in it amen
[19:56] sometimes you need to trust God's plan
[19:58] in the situation and stay right with it
[20:01] and sometimes we're given things in our
[20:02] life trials that you just don't
[20:05] understand tests instructions and we
[20:08] don't understand them but God's ways are
[20:10] higher than our ways and sometimes it's
[20:13] not a time of understanding it's a time
[20:16] of trusting because God is going to use
[20:19] that thing to defeat the enemy
[20:22] Hallelujah prise God the Bible says in 2
[20:25] Corinthians 10: 4-5 it says for the
[20:27] weapons of our are not carnal But Mighty
[20:30] through the god to the pulling down of
[20:33] strongholds casting down imagination and
[20:36] every High thing that it exalteth itself
[20:39] against the knowledge of God and
[20:41] bringing into captivity every thought to
[20:44] The Obedience of Christ every single
[20:47] thought sometimes you've got to take
[20:48] your own thoughts captives because God's
[20:51] ways are past finding out so sometimes
[20:53] he's got something for you to do that
[20:55] seems absolutely ridiculous but he's
[20:57] looking for you not to to not understand
[20:59] it he's looking at you to obey him
[21:01] because down the road it's going to be
[21:03] Mighty it's going to be powerful it's
[21:05] going to be something amen it's going to
[21:07] be powerful amen he just looking for you
[21:09] to dig that
[21:11] ditch another translation puts it like
[21:13] this we use God's Mighty weapons not
[21:16] worldly weapons to knock down the
[21:18] strongholds of human reasoning and to
[21:21] destroy false
[21:22] arguments and I read the message
[21:24] translation of the scripture and I
[21:26] thought it was so powerful in uh from
[21:28] from 2 Corinthians 10 it says the world
[21:31] is
[21:32] unprincipled it's a dog eat dog world
[21:35] out there the world doesn't fight fair
[21:37] but we don't live or fight our battles
[21:40] that way never have excuse me and never
[21:42] will the tools of our trade aren't for
[21:45] marketing or for manipulation they are
[21:48] for the or for demolishing that entirely
[21:51] massively corrupt culture we use our
[21:55] powerful God tools for smashing warped
[21:58] FL philosophies tearing down barriers
[22:00] erected against the truth of God fitting
[22:03] every loose thought and emotion and
[22:05] impulse into the structure of Life
[22:08] shaped by Christ Our tools are ready at
[22:12] hand for clearing the ground for every
[22:15] obstruction and building lives of
[22:17] obedience into maturity so our tools our
[22:21] our shovels are in our hand clearing the
[22:24] ground of every obstruction and building
[22:27] lives of obedience into maturity
[22:31] obedience into maturity amen so the the
[22:34] tools of our trade are they're for
[22:36] demolishing the entire corrupt culture
[22:38] it says you know you know I I was
[22:40] thinking about this you know culture
[22:41] changes over time it does I was thinking
[22:44] about the other day just the degradation
[22:46] of society in in something as simple as
[22:49] as the way people dress not just women
[22:51] men just the same what began as
[22:54] something completely abnormal and
[22:57] unaccepted eventually became tolerated
[22:59] in society and John Wesley pins it
[23:02] perfectly tolerate when one generation
[23:04] tolerates another generation Embraces
[23:07] that's why we are as Believers are never
[23:09] to tolerate the culture of this world
[23:12] because the culture changes of the world
[23:14] but God's culture never
[23:16] changes you know the word tolerate means
[23:20] it means to allow the existence of or it
[23:23] means willing to accept behavior and
[23:26] beliefs that are different from your own
[23:28] although you might not agree with them
[23:30] or approve of them I thought it was
[23:32] important to Define that because our
[23:34] practice is to be completely intolerant
[23:38] of the devil and his tactics amen when
[23:41] the enemy places thoughts in your mind
[23:43] recognize those thoughts to be not your
[23:46] thoughts recognize those thoughts to be
[23:49] not godly thoughts and put them into
[23:51] captivity reject the very appearance of
[23:54] it shun the appearance of evil the Bible
[23:56] says don't give him any place because
[23:58] what happens is is if you let that
[24:00] thought linger you begin to tolerate it
[24:03] amen when you tolerate it then you begin
[24:05] to embrace it amen once you've embraced
[24:07] it then you've lost the battle because a
[24:10] a word is a thought expressed amen and
[24:13] we always use that in the positive
[24:15] connotation but it has a negative
[24:16] connotation as well when a word is a
[24:19] thought expressed that means that
[24:20] thought has taken captivity in your mind
[24:23] and now you've allowed yourself to
[24:24] express that thought and it's become a
[24:26] negative action in your life
[24:28] wow
[24:31] amen that's what happened to the the
[24:33] Israelites there in the Old Testament
[24:35] they began to tolerate evil in their
[24:37] land when God deliberately told them not
[24:39] to give their land they don't even don't
[24:41] even pay tribute to them don't allow
[24:43] them to stay on your land even as your
[24:45] even as your slaves do not do it and
[24:48] they did because their thinking they
[24:50] thought their thinking was highly
[24:52] elevated amen but you know and we're all
[24:54] familiar with that with that with that
[24:56] scripture it led to destruction and what
[24:59] happens is the longer you tolerate a
[25:01] certain thing the more comfortable that
[25:04] you become with
[25:06] it I don't know about you but I don't
[25:08] ever want to be comfortable with
[25:10] anything the devil has to offer look at
[25:13] what look at what the Toleration has led
[25:15] to in the world it wasn't just a a
[25:17] Christian practice to dress modestly
[25:19] until the late 1800s it was
[25:21] inappropriate for women to even show
[25:23] their ankles in public in one article I
[25:25] read it saw it said in the 1800s women
[25:27] dressed in dresses in a way that
[25:30] emphasize modesty and femininity and and
[25:32] I'm not getting bogged down on just the
[25:34] way we dress but I'm just showing it
[25:37] because the natural types the spiritual
[25:39] and the lines are blurred to what is
[25:42] right and what isn't but thanks be to
[25:45] God it's not for believers amen we've
[25:47] got our standard amen and we live by the
[25:50] standard that's the word of God Amen you
[25:53] know brother Jason he's been emphasizing
[25:55] the set aart ones amen these past few
[25:57] Services the set apart ones have one
[26:01] culture and that is the Bible whatever
[26:04] the Bible says anything out of those
[26:06] boundaries we don't entertain or else we
[26:09] risk getting sucked into the modern
[26:11] culture and by embracing the way maybe
[26:14] the world dresses or the way the world
[26:16] Acts or the way the world talks you know
[26:19] or even worse you start embracing the
[26:21] way modern Christianity talks or the
[26:23] modern Christianity Acts or modern
[26:26] Christianity dresses and if we begin
[26:28] tolerating it in our lives we're risking
[26:30] our kids embracing it and more than just
[26:32] our kids because we're living in such a
[26:34] dark time and a mind boggling age that
[26:37] even in our own lives if we tolerate
[26:39] something it doesn't take an entire
[26:41] generation anymore that to become an
[26:43] embrace it it just takes a little bit of
[26:46] time and that and that Toleration leads
[26:49] to embracing that embracing leads to a
[26:51] thought that thought leads to an
[26:52] expression that expression leads to
[26:54] something that is ungodly amen so young
[26:58] young people everybody be intolerant of
[27:01] this world be intolerant of the devil
[27:03] and his tactics live with a higher
[27:05] standard take action in your walk dig
[27:08] ditches in your spiritual life that will
[27:11] allow the Lord Jesus to come in and to
[27:15] expose those things and be vulnerable to
[27:18] the Lord open up open so that he can
[27:20] open up him himself more to you and
[27:23] those things that hinder you in your
[27:25] walk you know if there's no room for him
[27:27] to come come in then he won't come in
[27:31] amen you know th those that maybe AR
[27:34] aren't concerned about maybe attendance
[27:37] or or concerned about listening to the
[27:39] prophet every day or you know maybe it's
[27:41] time for a change in our life maybe it's
[27:44] time for a fresh outpouring of God if
[27:46] youve and if you've never been concerned
[27:48] with it maybe it's time for an acts to
[27:50] experience in your life dig that ditch
[27:53] of Allowing God to come in say God if I
[27:55] I don't know if I've got the Holy Ghost
[27:57] dig that ditch expose that to God and
[27:59] say God I want that so bad and he will
[28:03] be faithful and just there is one way
[28:05] it's acts two repent be baptized in the
[28:07] name of Jesus Christ and you shall
[28:09] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen
[28:11] amen you know you'll always be at war
[28:14] with your flesh man and and you're doing
[28:16] the wrong thing Romans Paul makes that
[28:17] clear in Romans 7 he says I'm it seems
[28:20] that I'm always at war with myself amen
[28:23] I'm Waring against my own members but
[28:26] we've got the tools to overcome
[28:28] keep digging those ditches in your life
[28:30] amen and it'll make way for more of God
[28:33] to flow into you amen I just a couple of
[28:37] closing comments this morning I I I've
[28:39] been I was just reading yesterday
[28:41] studying for this Romans four or uh I'm
[28:43] sorry numbers 14 the Lord just put my
[28:46] put this scripture on my heart as I was
[28:48] studying and I thought it was just an
[28:49] incredible point to end on for
[28:51] overcoming for an overcoming Topic in
[28:54] numbers 13 and 14 when it came time to
[28:57] spy out for their Pro Promised Land This
[28:59] was when they went to Kadesh Baria there
[29:01] was several spies Joshua and Caleb being
[29:03] among them they they they went there and
[29:06] you remember the spies gave their
[29:07] testimony that their the the enemy is
[29:09] too great the land
[29:12] is Joshua said Joshua Caleb they Steed
[29:15] the people and said we are well able to
[29:18] overcome the
[29:19] land you
[29:22] know the Israelites actually got afraid
[29:25] and angry at that they started picking
[29:27] up stones and murmuring against Aaron
[29:29] and Moses and as they did that the glory
[29:31] of the Lord appeared in the Tabernacle
[29:34] and he actually came on the scene and
[29:36] spoke to Moses and I thought this was so
[29:37] awesome I'm almost finished he says this
[29:40] wasn't and this so this this scripture
[29:42] uh numbers 14:24 this isn't this isn't
[29:45] Moses's testimony of Caleb this was
[29:48] God's testimony of him he says but my
[29:51] servant Caleb because he had another
[29:54] spirit with him hath followed me
[29:57] fully
[29:58] land where he and his seed shall possess
[30:01] it God said that that was God's
[30:04] testimony about Caleb God God said that
[30:06] he has a different spirit and that he
[30:08] followed him fully imagine God's
[30:11] testimony of you being that you're
[30:12] different from the rest of the world and
[30:14] that you followed him fully that you're
[30:16] that you want to follow his words
[30:18] wholeheartedly not begrudgingly because
[30:20] you have to this is the life of an
[30:22] overcomer you hearken unto the to the
[30:25] word of the Lord and when the rest of
[30:26] the world is doing what they want or
[30:28] maybe your friends are doing what they
[30:29] want you've taken the pledge to follow
[30:32] him fully amen You' you to follow the
[30:35] teachings of God's Prophet fully and
[30:37] entirely you know the difference in
[30:40] Caleb and those other spies that went
[30:42] out is Caleb didn't let fear overcome
[30:44] him no doubt he saw the exact same thing
[30:48] that they saw you go through things in
[30:50] your life and sometimes it can be
[30:51] overwhelming but Caleb brought
