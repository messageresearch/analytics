TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] This is my worship. This is my offering. [Music] In every moment, I withhold nothing. I'm learning to trust you. Even when I can't see it, and even in suffering, I have to believe it. If you say it's wrong, then I'll say no. If you say release, I'm letting go. If you're in it with me, I'll begin. When you say to jump, I'm diving in. If you save me still, then I will wait. If you say to trust, I will oy. I don't want to follow my own way. I'm done chasing feelings. Spirit lead [Music] me. It felt like a burden, but once I could grasp it. You took me further, further than I was asking. And simply to see you. It's worth it all. My life is an alter. Let your fire fall. If you say it's wrong, then I'll say no. If you say release, I'm letting go. If you're in it with me, I'll begin. When you say to jump, I'm diving in. If you say be still, then I will wait. If you say to trust, I will oy. Teach me how to follow your way. Done chasing feelings. Spirit, lead [Music] me. When all hope is gone and your word is all I've got, I have to believe. You still bring water from the rocks to satisfy my thirst. To love me at my worst. And even when I don't remember, you remind me of my worth. I don't trust my ways. I'm trading in my thoughts. I lay down everything. Cuz you're all that I want. I land it on my knees. This is the cup you have for me. And even when it don't make sense, I'm going to let you spot [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Let your spirit lead [Music] me. Spirit lead [Music] me. Holy Spirit lead [Music] me. Spirit lead me. [Applause] Spirit, lead me. And if you say it's wrong, then I'll say no. If you say release, I'm letting go. If you're in it with me, I'll begin. And when you say to jump, I'm diving in. If you save me still, then I will wait. If you say to trust, I will oy. You're the only truth for life away. Done chasing feelings. Spirit, lead [Music] me. Spirit, lead me. [Music] [Applause]
