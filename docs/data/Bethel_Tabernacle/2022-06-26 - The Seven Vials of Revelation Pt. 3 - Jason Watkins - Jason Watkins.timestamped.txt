[42:50] we have wonderful ministry coming
[42:53] for this year so
[42:55] we're looking forward to that so today i
[42:57] think is the last day
[42:59] for our bethel youth to be able to
[43:01] register uh on a private link before the
[43:04] public link opens
[43:07] st john chapter five
[43:12] saint john chapter 5 and we're going to
[43:14] read
[43:14] uh verses 24 through 29
[43:18] and just appreciating the the lord in
[43:21] this study i certainly
[43:23] have needed him
[43:25] and he is i tell you the lord is just
[43:27] the most faithful friend you'll ever
[43:29] have
[43:30] and uh just so reliable and so uh
[43:33] so responsible over his family and
[43:36] you know if it was all up to us
[43:39] man it would just fall down right away i
[43:41] know it would fall down if it was all up
[43:43] to me
[43:43] but i'm glad that he just overlooks my
[43:45] fault
[43:46] and sees the need
[43:48] and one one singer sang at one time said
[43:50] he overlooked my fault and saw the seed
[43:54] i say blessed be the name of the lord so
[43:57] we want to carry on today by the help of
[43:59] the lord
[44:00] and
[44:01] we're we're going on into part three
[44:05] of the seven vials of revelation
[44:08] and
[44:09] we're just going to we're trying to go
[44:11] slow and i'm trying to do that on
[44:13] purpose
[44:14] so we really want to get into the nuts
[44:16] and bolts of some of it today and move
[44:18] into
[44:19] those eight or nine consecutive services
[44:21] that brother branham
[44:23] took
[44:24] when he was at least
[44:26] going along the theme of
[44:28] the seven vials he makes it very clear
[44:31] that he would like to have
[44:33] a time and a place to specifically
[44:36] take it like he did the seals where it
[44:38] becomes just a uh you know seven eight
[44:41] nine services of bible study but he he
[44:44] couldn't get the facility and the lord
[44:46] didn't bring it like that he still kept
[44:48] longing for it he wanted to do the
[44:49] trumpets the same way
[44:51] but we find that as we look closer at
[44:53] the message we find that he did teach
[44:56] many things out of the trumpets and out
[44:59] of the vials and correlated a lot of
[45:01] things together for us that you really
[45:03] can only see
[45:05] uh in the entire body of his teaching if
[45:07] you go to any one servant one service
[45:10] you're not gonna get it but if you if
[45:13] you understand the whole thing in its
[45:15] entirety then you can put a lot of the
[45:17] pieces together this is why there's a
[45:19] need for the five-fold ministry to
[45:22] rightly divide the word of truth because
[45:24] you know i've spent my my lifetime uh
[45:27] since a boy
[45:28] studying and putting it all the picture
[45:30] together in my mind
[45:32] you say brother jason where are you
[45:34] where are you getting all this i can
[45:35] only say it's been you know years since
[45:38] a child that i began studying the
[45:41] prophet's message
[45:42] comparing it to the scripture and uh
[45:45] have found it to be a hundred percent
[45:47] spot on uh you're indefensible if you
[45:49] try to resist it from the bible it's an
[45:52] indefensible position and so uh i
[45:55] appreciate it that's why you know we no
[45:58] one preaches i promise you no one
[46:00] preaches
[46:01] harder that you should hear the tapes of
[46:03] god's prophet but you still need an
[46:06] elected ministry to rightly divide the
[46:08] whole thing out and draw out and put all
[46:10] the pieces together for you amen so
[46:13] that's god's order of doing things and
[46:15] we very much appreciate it i would have
[46:18] no ability to do it i promise you that
[46:20] would have no ability if i wasn't able
[46:22] to lean back on a prophet's tapes i
[46:24] would have no ability to bring anything
[46:26] of understanding men have tried they
[46:29] probed at it but god sent one vindicated
[46:31] voice in this day believe that friends
[46:34] amen i hope you believe that because
[46:36] that's your that's the path to getting
[46:38] out of here is to receive him whom god
[46:42] hath sent they asked jesus how can we do
[46:45] the works of god and that was his answer
[46:47] believe him whom god hath sent
[46:50] so whenever christ reveals himself to a
[46:53] messenger in any age
[46:55] you should follow that if you want to
[46:58] live amen john chapter 5
[47:02] verses 24 to 29
[47:06] now we've taken the first two parts and
[47:08] we've read out of
[47:09] revelation 16 concerning the seventh
[47:12] vial i don't need to do that today
[47:14] partly because i've already done it
[47:16] twice and
[47:17] additionally because we'll have it up
[47:18] here on the screen just shortly
[47:21] i have
[47:22] some stuff i've been promising to show
[47:24] you
[47:25] and i got a lot more
[47:27] that we won't get to today so you just
[47:29] give me your undivided attention and let
[47:30] me get to what i want to get to amen i
[47:33] won't wear you there's no death worse
[47:35] than being drugged to death so we won't
[47:37] we won't do that to you
[47:39] verily verily saint john 5 24 verily
[47:42] verily or truly truly or surely surely
[47:46] i say unto you
[47:48] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[47:51] him that sent me
[47:53] hath everlasting life and shall not come
[47:57] into the condemnation but is passed from
[48:00] death unto life
[48:02] that one verse
[48:04] has the value of eternity
[48:07] uh they could never write enough volumes
[48:09] of books to fill up the whole world that
[48:11] would be more valuable than that verse
[48:14] amen verse 25
[48:17] verily verily i say unto you the hour is
[48:19] coming
[48:20] and now is
[48:22] when the dead shall hear the voice of
[48:24] the son of god
[48:25] and they that here shall live
[48:28] for as the father hath life in himself
[48:32] so hath he given to the son to have life
[48:35] in himself now watch
[48:38] and conjunction and
[48:40] not only does he have the power to give
[48:43] life
[48:44] but anne hath given him authority to
[48:46] execute judgment also
[48:49] because
[48:51] so there's a reason
[48:52] because
[48:54] he is the son of man all right now
[48:57] that's an office the son of man
[48:59] marvel not at this for the hour is
[49:03] coming
[49:04] in which all that are in the graves
[49:06] shall hear his voice now he's jumped all
[49:08] the way to the end time
[49:10] now he's just talked about saint john 5
[49:12] 24
[49:14] that those who have believed him have
[49:16] passed from death to life never come
[49:18] into the judgment so they're already
[49:20] resurrected by the time this voice is
[49:22] sounding
[49:23] this is the general resurrection uh
[49:26] coming at the end of the millennium and
[49:29] shall come forth they that have done
[49:32] good unto the resurrection of life and
[49:35] they that have done evil unto the
[49:37] resurrection of damnation so he's
[49:40] calling forth the remnant of the woman's
[49:43] seed and those who face judgment they're
[49:47] all coming to his judgment bar and
[49:50] they're there they will get a fair trial
[49:52] i appreciate that that's a comforting
[49:54] word to the whole world people can say
[49:57] to me you know what what's going to be
[49:59] my fate uh if i refuse this thing you
[50:02] call a message i'll just simply say well
[50:04] you'll get a fair trial i can promise
[50:06] you that and you'll get a fair trial
[50:08] from an unbiased judge who will look at
[50:10] your heart and he knows what he revealed
[50:13] to you and he knows what you were called
[50:14] to and he knows what you did with what
[50:16] you had when you had it and so
[50:19] so there there's nobody going to be able
[50:21] to cry foul
[50:23] at the judgment bar and if you go and
[50:24] read matthew 25 you don't find anybody
[50:27] crying foul you don't even even the
[50:29] people resigned to their fate and led
[50:31] away are not gold kicking and screaming
[50:34] crying injustice they realize that
[50:37] there's apparently at that point all the
[50:39] veil is lifted and you you see yourself
[50:42] as you really are now the advantage that
[50:45] we have today
[50:47] is we can look in god's mirror and see
[50:49] who we really are now
[50:50] you don't have to wait till you get
[50:52] there amen because now there's mercy so
[50:55] i would say to you today if you don't
[50:57] know him in the power of his
[50:58] resurrection you're at the right place
[51:01] at the right time and a tremendous
[51:03] opportunity lays before you
[51:06] let's pray
[51:08] father we thank you for your word
[51:10] and i just move into it lord as i begin
[51:12] to feel your anointing and declare as
[51:15] you would have me declare i commit
[51:17] myself into your hands unworthy as i may
[51:20] be but lord you are worthy and you have
[51:22] made in christ we are worthy now lord
[51:25] that's not something we could do to
[51:27] ourselves of ourselves for ourselves but
[51:30] you have purposed it lord and you have
[51:33] carried it out and we say today blessed
[51:35] be the name of the lord now give us lord
[51:38] the word that we need for the present
[51:39] distress we commit it to you in jesus
[51:42] name amen god bless you you can be
[51:44] seated
[51:55] all right
[51:57] so
[51:58] i understand then
[52:00] that um
[52:01] this should be working brother mark so
[52:03] brother caleb i'm going to
[52:05] power off and power on you put my
[52:07] powerpoint up please
[52:11] and remember the instructions we're
[52:13] starting from a certain slide
[52:16] let me advance one and let me see if
[52:17] that's the one
[52:19] no you you're you started too far back
[52:21] go to seven i think is what i sent to
[52:23] the booth there you go beautiful
[52:26] all right
[52:27] so we're advancing on
[52:30] and today we're carrying on the seven
[52:33] vowels of revelation and we want to look
[52:35] at a correlation between the seven
[52:37] trumpets and the seven bottles let me
[52:40] test this and try to go back
[52:42] okay perfect seems to be working brother
[52:44] mark you're a good man uh we'll we'll
[52:46] see if if if technology holds up because
[52:49] i have an embedded video thanks brother
[52:51] tony uh can i get yeah you're right
[52:53] never mind that's that's the one yeah
[52:56] and um
[52:57] and we'll see if it plays and brother
[52:59] caleb i
[53:00] i sent it to you with the volume muted
[53:03] it should stay muted even though it
[53:05] doesn't look muted but it if you hear
[53:07] sound uh then
[53:09] yeah pardon
[53:11] yeah you're you're the man all right so
[53:14] let's look now at some things the
[53:15] prophet said here
[53:17] in an exposition of the seven church
[53:19] ages
[53:21] i have a number of things and statements
[53:23] i want to take from the church age book
[53:25] brother branham says though this is from
[53:27] the introduction though this volume will
[53:29] concern itself with the various major
[53:31] doctrines
[53:32] such as the godhead water baptism etc
[53:36] found in revelation chapters one through
[53:38] three
[53:39] its main theme is the setting forth of a
[53:42] detailed study of the seven church ages
[53:46] now watch
[53:48] this is necessary
[53:50] in order to study and understand the
[53:53] rest of the revelation
[53:56] for out of the ages come the seals
[53:59] excuse me and out of the seals come the
[54:02] trumpets and out of the trumpets come
[54:04] the viles
[54:07] like the first burst of a roman candle
[54:10] the church ages come forth with a mighty
[54:12] initial illumination
[54:14] without which there could be no further
[54:16] light
[54:17] but once the brilliance of the seven
[54:19] church ages is given by divine
[54:21] revelation
[54:22] light upon light follows until the whole
[54:26] of the revelation opens wide before our
[54:30] wondering eyes isn't that a wonderful
[54:32] promise
[54:33] and we edified and purified by its
[54:36] spirit are made ready for his glorious
[54:39] appearing even our lord and savior the
[54:42] one true god jesus christ
[54:45] all right um i think i can go we'll just
[54:48] leave it right there for now
[54:51] so so when we are looking at
[54:55] at the revelation that god brought in
[54:57] this day under the opening of the seven
[54:59] seals
[55:00] and as i've said to you before and i
[55:02] don't have a lot of time for
[55:04] backgrounding today so if you've missed
[55:06] part one and two i would highly advise
[55:08] you to go back and listen to it because
[55:11] it really i've spent a lot of time and
[55:14] effort identifying where we are in
[55:16] prophecy and that's important because
[55:20] once you identify where you are in time
[55:22] as it relates to prophecy
[55:24] then you then you know what god's up to
[55:27] you know what the devil's up to and you
[55:30] know what you're supposed to be up to
[55:32] amen so uh so you don't just want to you
[55:35] know just gloss over it and say well you
[55:37] know i wasn't here for that service and
[55:39] i'm not going back to get the archive
[55:40] well that's your loss because it'll
[55:43] better equip you to understand uh the
[55:46] hour and the challenge that we face in
[55:48] this day now
[55:50] so when we when we see what he's done
[55:53] and and and as he says out of one thing
[55:55] comes another and comes another and
[55:57] comes another we've told you how that
[55:59] the seventh seal is the overview of it
[56:02] all everything is under that seventh
[56:03] seal everything happens under the
[56:05] seventh seal all the trumpets sound
[56:08] under the sixth seal which indicates a
[56:10] time of tribulation when they come into
[56:12] their fullness but we've also now found
[56:15] out that during the ages that that there
[56:18] are partial uh renderings there are
[56:21] partial fulfillments coming under the
[56:23] trumpets just like there were partial
[56:27] seals partially opened during the ages
[56:30] and with partial opening of the word
[56:33] then there was a brad called out and and
[56:36] in the trumpet it's god dealing with
[56:37] israel down through history uh he's
[56:40] gonna slowly bring them back to the day
[56:41] of atonement because they rejected
[56:43] christ it went to the gentiles but we
[56:45] find that they're going to discover when
[56:47] when moses and elijah go to them
[56:50] with the message of the hour when they
[56:54] take to them the message like that you
[56:56] have enjoyed for years the mighty god
[56:58] unveiled the token the invisible union
[57:01] they're going to understand that and and
[57:04] moses and elijah are going to be able to
[57:06] go into the trumpets in depth
[57:08] because brother branham he
[57:10] he he wanted to do that like he did the
[57:12] seals and and and god told him he
[57:14] already preached it under the seals and
[57:16] so he takes feast of trumpets my mom and
[57:19] dad uh were uh live at that service and
[57:22] so so we find that that
[57:25] when you have that seal partially opened
[57:29] down in every age you had trumpets
[57:32] partially open and that's why you read
[57:34] about judgments brother branham talks
[57:37] about
[57:38] that in each age and i'm going to say
[57:40] this again shortly i'm just saying it in
[57:42] repetition so you get it
[57:44] but we fight going to find out
[57:47] that that during each of the ages when
[57:50] he's opening partially a seal and a
[57:52] messenger catches it when there's a
[57:54] rejection of that then there's a partial
[57:57] uh opening of a vial correlating to that
[58:00] age and pours out a judgment and the
[58:03] trumpets record it and it'll say things
[58:05] like a third of this died and a third of
[58:07] that died meaning temporary it's not the
[58:10] full thing which is going to come in the
[58:12] tribulation period but you don't want to
[58:14] discount the fact that these that the
[58:17] seals and the the ages the seals the
[58:20] trumpets and the vials have been and are
[58:23] affecting life as you know it
[58:25] and they are they are moving in god's
[58:28] plan of redemption and that's an
[58:29] important point
[58:31] and brother branham gives us enough
[58:33] teaching
[58:34] on the trumpets and in the vial so that
[58:37] we can know that
[58:38] so that you can know what i just said is
[58:40] true all you got to do is go and study
[58:43] brother branham's teachings on the book
[58:45] of revelation and he said a ton of stuff
[58:48] showing and went right into the trumpet
[58:50] showing how they were applying and back
[58:52] in the ages because every time you had
[58:54] an age uh to the to the gentiles and and
[58:58] a seal partially opening and a messenger
[59:00] you also had a trumpet correlating to
[59:02] that for the jews and and then before
[59:05] the second age or the second seal would
[59:07] begin you'd have you'd have that first
[59:09] trumpet and then the second in the age
[59:11] for the gentiles and then a second to
[59:14] the jews and then a third and a third
[59:16] and a fourth and a fourth and all the
[59:18] while the vials or the plagues or the
[59:20] judgments are pouring out partially
[59:23] under those partial openings
[59:26] it makes sense
[59:28] now
[59:29] that all worked fine until we got down
[59:31] to this end time day and you're going to
[59:33] see one of the things i've been telling
[59:35] you that it's going to make this age
[59:37] completely unique from those ages
[59:40] because it's a restoration all the way
[59:42] back to the alpha age the alpha church
[59:44] under the apostles that early church
[59:46] before they began to to cool off and
[59:49] relax and backslide and uh
[59:52] and that's why when you see brother
[59:54] branham begin the church ages he begins
[59:56] with that with that falling that that
[59:58] relaxing so he says the he talks about
[1:00:01] how the church ran for a couple decades
[1:00:03] uh under the perfect word of god and so
[1:00:06] uh going into the ages as every time
[1:00:09] they kept losing the realities of christ
[1:00:11] and losing the teaching and brother
[1:00:13] branham talks about irenaeus
[1:00:15] last one to understand the godhead
[1:00:17] perfectly and so every time they they
[1:00:19] lose something and it's because of their
[1:00:21] backsliding
[1:00:23] and then when they lose it then god
[1:00:25] seals it away and he seals it under and
[1:00:27] by the time you get to the end it's all
[1:00:28] sealed up it's under seven seals and
[1:00:30] can't even be known and so by the time
[1:00:33] they crown a false prophet in the fourth
[1:00:35] age they've already rejected christ at
[1:00:38] nicaea and they've been put away and and
[1:00:41] and now god is dealing uh as the as the
[1:00:45] son of god in mercy back in the
[1:00:47] eternities interceding on behalf of the
[1:00:50] ignorance of the people because he's not
[1:00:52] going to lose his children
[1:00:54] see
[1:00:55] and you can't disbelieve what you don't
[1:00:57] know
[1:00:57] so the
[1:00:59] sin is unbelief that's what sin is and
[1:01:02] so you can't be you can't be found
[1:01:04] guilty of sinning and disbelieving
[1:01:08] something you you don't know at all see
[1:01:10] so so you see that god has it all
[1:01:13] covered he has a plan for it he even has
[1:01:15] a plan for the for the natives as
[1:01:18] brother branham said the heathens who
[1:01:20] never even got a chance to hear the
[1:01:21] gospel be raised up in the millennium to
[1:01:24] hear it and have a chance at it you say
[1:01:26] well who's not going to believe it
[1:01:27] living in the millennium well adam and
[1:01:29] eve fell in the garden
[1:01:31] so it's not going that's not going to
[1:01:33] stop anything see so so they're going to
[1:01:36] be and the judgment bar now will give
[1:01:38] every man a fair trial but i'm thankful
[1:01:41] that the bride down through all the ages
[1:01:43] old testament and new will be with him
[1:01:45] hallelujah the four and 20 elders are
[1:01:47] already seated on 12 thrones and now
[1:01:50] there's there's a place for you to sit
[1:01:52] hallelujah
[1:01:54] amen and i just said a mouthful all
[1:01:57] right now let me let me try to make some
[1:01:58] tracks
[1:02:00] so it's all redemption it brings
[1:02:02] everything back
[1:02:04] that that's what the seventh seal does
[1:02:06] it it re it redeems everything that was
[1:02:09] lost it's going to come through god's
[1:02:11] threefold plan of
[1:02:13] uh of of making himself manifest in
[1:02:16] christ and then he's going to have
[1:02:18] preeminence down through the church ages
[1:02:20] in his church by the holy ghost
[1:02:24] and by the seven spirits of god which
[1:02:26] are going which is one god speaking in
[1:02:29] seven ages through seven messengers yes
[1:02:31] amen so so so i so look
[1:02:35] there's no need to kick against the
[1:02:37] pricks the seven spirits of god speak
[1:02:40] through seven messengers
[1:02:42] and so if you want to hear the spirit of
[1:02:45] god you have to hear the seven
[1:02:48] i mean that's not hard
[1:02:50] all right and that's the way
[1:02:52] complain all you want but that's how god
[1:02:54] designed it see
[1:02:56] all right
[1:02:58] now
[1:03:00] so it's all redemption it's all about
[1:03:03] bringing everything back we found out
[1:03:05] last wednesday not only the bride is
[1:03:07] redeemed
[1:03:08] uh we find out that in the tribulation
[1:03:11] the threefold purpose because you know
[1:03:13] in this site it's to re to make himself
[1:03:15] manifest in christ to get preeminence in
[1:03:17] his bride through the ages and then to
[1:03:19] restore the bride back to her rightly
[1:03:20] position that fell by sin in the garden
[1:03:24] all right so we find then that in the
[1:03:27] tribulation it's a time of purging it's
[1:03:30] a time of purging 144 000 elected jews
[1:03:34] it's a time of purging the remnant of
[1:03:36] the woman's seed the foolish virgin
[1:03:38] and it's a time of purging the earth
[1:03:42] excuse me
[1:03:45] um i apologize for that the medication i
[1:03:48] take chokes me up horribly in the
[1:03:49] morning so i just have to hack and cough
[1:03:51] my way and preach through it but it's
[1:03:53] all right amen so if i cough and you
[1:03:56] feel you need to cough just cough
[1:03:58] you don't have a mic i have to mute mine
[1:04:02] all right
[1:04:03] so
[1:04:05] so we find then that it's it's it's
[1:04:08] redemption and it and it's going to
[1:04:10] bring the earth you know into
[1:04:12] back into its right order and you know
[1:04:15] there should be a passion i i think that
[1:04:18] there should be a passion in our lives
[1:04:20] you know to know the word of god to to
[1:04:24] not only know the theology of it friends
[1:04:26] but but there should be some kind of as
[1:04:28] paul said pressing toward the mark there
[1:04:31] should be a and that means straining
[1:04:33] reaching there should be a reaching to
[1:04:35] know him in the spirit
[1:04:37] there should be a reaching to know
[1:04:38] you're not here today just to get
[1:04:40] theology pumped into your heads i'm here
[1:04:43] to to show you christ in his word
[1:04:46] because he's a mystery that desires
[1:04:48] fellowship with his people
[1:04:51] and so there should be a fervent desire
[1:04:54] in our lives to please god brother
[1:04:56] branham comes in the church age book i
[1:04:58] don't i don't i didn't put it up on
[1:05:00] purpose because i didn't want to read
[1:05:01] too much
[1:05:02] uh from the screen but brother branham
[1:05:04] goes into the sumerian church age and
[1:05:06] then he repeats it again in the resume
[1:05:08] of the ages and he talks about how that
[1:05:11] learning has replaced revelation and
[1:05:13] reasoning has replaced faith and program
[1:05:16] listen to this one program has replaced
[1:05:19] spontaneous praise in the holy ghost all
[1:05:22] away with program
[1:05:24] we should have spontaneous praise in the
[1:05:27] presence of god
[1:05:30] not here looking for reasoning to
[1:05:32] replace my faith i'm not here to let
[1:05:34] program replaced spontaneous praise in
[1:05:36] the holy ghost he goes on how in the
[1:05:39] resume how that they the age became
[1:05:41] lukewarm and that's what the church has
[1:05:43] happened today that's that's the that's
[1:05:46] what god testified about laodicea the
[1:05:50] seventh and last age that you're in this
[1:05:52] was his testimony two thousand years
[1:05:55] before they came on the earth
[1:05:57] and he talks about brother bannon goes
[1:05:58] into the resume talking about how that
[1:06:00] they they just become lukewarm and and
[1:06:03] formal and when you become lukewarm and
[1:06:06] formal you know what happens you become
[1:06:08] powerless
[1:06:10] you have no power to overcome the devil
[1:06:12] you have no power to live a life above
[1:06:14] reproach you have no power in your
[1:06:16] prayer and i'm here to tell you this is
[1:06:18] an hour when you need to have power in
[1:06:20] your prayer
[1:06:21] this is an hour when you need to have a
[1:06:23] fellowship with god and brother branham
[1:06:25] would say that over and over perfect
[1:06:27] faith in different messages he would say
[1:06:29] now i'm bringing this you've had a faith
[1:06:31] but but there's coming a time i'm going
[1:06:33] to talk to you about a perfect faith
[1:06:35] because there's coming a time when
[1:06:36] you're going to need this
[1:06:38] and it's not going to come by theology
[1:06:40] and it's not just going to come because
[1:06:42] you're elected it's going to come
[1:06:44] because you have pressed forward that
[1:06:46] you have reached for the high calling
[1:06:48] that you have entered into a vibrant
[1:06:51] relationship
[1:06:53] with christ
[1:06:55] he said they become lukewarm and formal
[1:06:57] and powerless
[1:06:58] and many well he calls it well worked
[1:07:00] out explanations and prophet called it
[1:07:03] educated guesses of educated men
[1:07:06] how that they hold the ignorant in
[1:07:08] foodless pastures
[1:07:10] oh i'm no i think this bride is done
[1:07:13] with that she wants the revealed word of
[1:07:15] god
[1:07:16] hallelujah she doesn't just want to be a
[1:07:18] church member she's looking to ascend
[1:07:20] hallelujah
[1:07:23] and so we see these things happening you
[1:07:25] know they're in an age where we have
[1:07:27] such fear that has come upon the earth
[1:07:29] i'm going to try this i think it darkens
[1:07:31] that screen
[1:07:32] i thought it yeah it does we have such
[1:07:34] an age where fear has come into the
[1:07:37] world but but the prophet showed us that
[1:07:40] when the seven seals were open in the
[1:07:42] last day that what it one of the primary
[1:07:45] purposes that it came to do was take
[1:07:47] away fear
[1:07:49] how does it remove fear by removing
[1:07:51] doubts
[1:07:52] see because uncertainty brings anxiety
[1:07:55] and that's that's fear and and the whole
[1:07:57] world men's hearts are failing for
[1:08:00] not knowing
[1:08:02] the fear of the unknown and so now he
[1:08:05] has revealed not only his teaching but
[1:08:08] he has manifested his presence and
[1:08:11] that's why a prophet could say to you
[1:08:12] shalom bride good morning
[1:08:15] it is the darkest time the darkest day
[1:08:18] it's gross darkness on the people but
[1:08:19] here's the here's the ministry of the
[1:08:21] morning star arise shine thy light has
[1:08:24] come
[1:08:26] hallelujah
[1:08:28] so we find in the opening of the seals
[1:08:30] that have been people who have been
[1:08:32] chosen in christ
[1:08:33] how their names have been placed in the
[1:08:35] lamb's book of life and under no
[1:08:37] circumstances could any of those names
[1:08:38] ever be removed just say that to
[1:08:40] yourself and say it to the devil under
[1:08:42] no circumstances can those names be
[1:08:45] removed from the book of life under no
[1:08:47] circumstances
[1:08:50] so when the church comes you know to
[1:08:52] know
[1:08:53] who she is brother branham talked about
[1:08:55] satan will be powerless before her
[1:08:57] she'll be
[1:08:58] an invincible army he tells the the time
[1:09:01] the experience of coming and he's he's
[1:09:03] in a dream and he's three quarters of
[1:09:05] the way to jordan and it's and there's
[1:09:07] great fear and everybody's under fear
[1:09:08] and it's a great
[1:09:09] it's a great beast moving and he says
[1:09:12] when i saw it i recognized it as a mamba
[1:09:15] from africa he said they're very deadly
[1:09:18] one bite and you just are finished and
[1:09:20] and and i was just seeing uh the other
[1:09:22] day on a uh uh uh uh an animal
[1:09:25] documentary about the mamba and how that
[1:09:28] his bite can even take down a full grown
[1:09:30] bull elephant
[1:09:33] i saw it was so pitiful i saw a lion uh
[1:09:36] a a large lion taken and bitten by him
[1:09:39] and he began to convulse and shake and
[1:09:41] couldn't control his functions anymore
[1:09:44] and and through the night perishing and
[1:09:46] and and brother branham said the one
[1:09:48] bite of this that's a spiritual it's a
[1:09:50] time where the enemy has reached his
[1:09:52] zenith it's a time where he's the god of
[1:09:54] this evil age this is no time to be
[1:09:57] distant from christ
[1:09:59] you're gonna need to be close to him in
[1:10:01] this hour
[1:10:03] things are coming upon the earth and
[1:10:04] you're going to need to have thus saith
[1:10:06] the lord you're going to need to have a
[1:10:07] token that you can bring and show him
[1:10:09] and brother branham says shake it in
[1:10:11] front of his face i'm a son or daughter
[1:10:13] of god
[1:10:14] and the word of god gives me this
[1:10:16] privilege and i claim it in the name of
[1:10:17] jesus christ it'll go after your
[1:10:19] sickness in your body it'll go after
[1:10:21] your children who are in the world it'll
[1:10:23] restore everything because this is a
[1:10:25] message of redemption
[1:10:28] hallelujah
[1:10:31] it's a time of extreme fear
[1:10:34] and you must go on he was only i heard
[1:10:37] brother abraham preaching on this
[1:10:38] recently and
[1:10:39] how that you know brother branham is
[1:10:41] pointing out he's only two-thirds of the
[1:10:42] way
[1:10:43] the whole point was you must go on
[1:10:46] and and the and the real if there be a
[1:10:48] moral to the story is that if you don't
[1:10:51] if you don't go on
[1:10:53] if you don't move on in maturity if you
[1:10:56] you're you're living in such a time that
[1:10:59] if you stay carnal and you don't move on
[1:11:02] then the mamba well brother abraham said
[1:11:04] in his african way then the mamba will
[1:11:06] finish you here
[1:11:09] he'll destroy you now i'm here to tell
[1:11:11] you he'll take away from you everything
[1:11:14] you love he'll take away everything that
[1:11:16] you hold dear to your heart don't let
[1:11:18] that happen friend you're the bride of
[1:11:20] jesus christ
[1:11:22] hallelujah
[1:11:25] so we see these things as they begin to
[1:11:28] break upon the earth and
[1:11:31] i had a number of
[1:11:34] articles i was going to show you but
[1:11:36] they just were too sad and
[1:11:38] there's just been too many and when i
[1:11:40] you know i i started to show you the
[1:11:43] you know this shooting in this situation
[1:11:45] and before i before i could even come to
[1:11:47] show it to you they already had three
[1:11:48] four five six more
[1:11:50] and i was going to show you another one
[1:11:52] and then i'm going to show you two or
[1:11:53] three and now i'd have to show you half
[1:11:55] a dozen just since i started showing
[1:11:57] studying this the world is such a such a
[1:12:00] sad state
[1:12:02] i read an article about a
[1:12:04] you know and this is so typical it's not
[1:12:06] some big headline breaking story but i
[1:12:08] thought how typical it is
[1:12:10] of this world of irresponsibility where
[1:12:13] nobody takes responsibility nobody owns
[1:12:15] anything
[1:12:17] it's always somebody else's fault
[1:12:20] it's never you know everybody refuses
[1:12:23] blame and even large corporations get
[1:12:26] caught
[1:12:27] gaming the system and and and and they
[1:12:30] they have to come and and pay a fine
[1:12:33] which is a fraction of the of the
[1:12:35] billions they've tucked away breaking
[1:12:37] the law
[1:12:38] and they have to pay a little fine that
[1:12:40] doesn't even wouldn't even cover the
[1:12:41] interest they're earning
[1:12:43] but they admit no guilt
[1:12:46] yeah we'll pay your fine but we're not
[1:12:47] going to admit any guilt say yeah that's
[1:12:49] that's a corrupt government it's not
[1:12:51] just a corrupt government it's a
[1:12:53] government that knows that these
[1:12:55] corporations can hire dream teams of
[1:12:57] lawyers who are corrupt and can just
[1:12:59] work to move this thing on for years and
[1:13:01] so the government says look with a
[1:13:03] center you pay a fine and don't you do
[1:13:04] it again and and they won't until they
[1:13:06] do
[1:13:09] the world's done friends
[1:13:11] stop investing in it invest don't put
[1:13:14] treasures here put them up there
[1:13:16] hallelujah this world is passing away
[1:13:20] they talked about i seen a headline of
[1:13:22] this congressman got caught totally you
[1:13:24] know he was a complete adulterer and
[1:13:27] liar and swindler and and here he is has
[1:13:30] the audacity you need you need to resign
[1:13:33] from running i'm not going to resign
[1:13:35] well but you got caught red-handed that
[1:13:38] you were a crook and you were cheating
[1:13:40] on your wife and your family and you
[1:13:42] then you lied about it and then and then
[1:13:44] you even threatened this woman over here
[1:13:46] that if she said anything you would have
[1:13:47] her killed
[1:13:48] how can you not resign i'm not resigning
[1:13:51] he's still running today
[1:13:53] there's no shame
[1:13:55] there's no embarrassment brother branham
[1:13:56] said you can't even hardly get a girl to
[1:13:58] blush these days
[1:14:00] brother m tells a story of a little boy
[1:14:02] he says when i was a little boy i was on
[1:14:04] the playground in the school and he says
[1:14:06] we were out of the swing or the slide or
[1:14:07] something and he said a little girl out
[1:14:09] there in her long dress uh and he said
[1:14:12] she go to when to stand up and just the
[1:14:15] the bottom flap of her skirt just kind
[1:14:17] of flipped open and he said about a few
[1:14:19] inches of her petticoat which was also
[1:14:21] all the way down
[1:14:22] he said a few inches of her petticoat
[1:14:24] showed and she said all the boys seen it
[1:14:26] and said she turned several shades of
[1:14:28] red and all the boys turned away
[1:14:31] that's that sounds like a joke
[1:14:34] that's like that's like material a
[1:14:35] comedian would use to today in the
[1:14:38] modern day but that's where society was
[1:14:40] compared to where it is now
[1:14:42] they're not even embarrassed to be
[1:14:44] completely nasty and vulgar out in the
[1:14:47] open and you've got society going that
[1:14:49] way you've got the government passing
[1:14:51] laws to protect it i'm here to tell you
[1:14:54] friends that satan's eden and i i'm
[1:14:56] looking for a new heavens and a new
[1:14:58] earth i'm looking for a millennial reign
[1:15:01] with christ
[1:15:04] i read a story of a middle schooler
[1:15:07] middle school kid
[1:15:08] who may have his future trashed as far
[1:15:10] as it relates to universities
[1:15:13] and he was a he's a he's a a straight a
[1:15:16] student with high aspirations to ivy
[1:15:19] league schools but that's all been cast
[1:15:22] in doubt now
[1:15:23] because
[1:15:24] his middle school faculty
[1:15:27] went after him uh because
[1:15:30] that they because he didn't use a proper
[1:15:34] gender neutral pronoun
[1:15:38] it was an accident
[1:15:39] and he did it several times and he i'm
[1:15:41] sorry and they said you're doing that on
[1:15:43] purpose and his parents are saying look
[1:15:45] we raised him to look at a boy and say a
[1:15:48] boy and look at a girl and say that's a
[1:15:50] girl and this is a he and that's a herd
[1:15:52] and this is a hymn and that's a she and
[1:15:54] i'm sorry but he can't just turn that
[1:15:57] around overnight and they're actually
[1:15:59] trying to ruin his future
[1:16:04] because he refers to a girl as her
[1:16:07] i was preaching to you wednesday about
[1:16:08] the insanity
[1:16:10] the insanity
[1:16:12] the insanity
[1:16:14] see
[1:16:15] and so we find that
[1:16:17] you know he um
[1:16:19] when we start to look at these things
[1:16:21] and so
[1:16:22] so it's
[1:16:23] but now let me let me just say this let
[1:16:25] me just let me just come back
[1:16:27] to my thought
[1:16:29] it's all still
[1:16:31] under the perfect control of god there
[1:16:34] is nothing i know it looks like chaos
[1:16:36] but prophecy is driving it to the letter
[1:16:41] i know it looks like this thing's got
[1:16:43] out of got away from god and got out of
[1:16:44] control nothing doing i'm here to tell
[1:16:47] you the devil still runs nothing but his
[1:16:49] mouth
[1:16:50] and brother branham said he has no
[1:16:52] weapon only the only weapon he has is to
[1:16:54] get you to doubt your weapon i'm not
[1:16:57] going to doubt my weapon
[1:16:59] and i'm not going to doubt that i that i
[1:17:01] can move into a relationship with god so
[1:17:04] far
[1:17:04] so deep that satan can't even find me
[1:17:09] i believe that the holy spirit can
[1:17:11] anoint me and i can speak to something
[1:17:13] and it wouldn't matter what's hindering
[1:17:14] it it god's power of creation can turn
[1:17:17] it around
[1:17:20] hallelujah
[1:17:24] so beginning then to be seen at the turn
[1:17:26] of the 20th century
[1:17:29] judgments began to
[1:17:31] pick up steam in the earth this is all
[1:17:33] part of the
[1:17:35] unique hour that we have arrived at
[1:17:36] there's so many things as i've said to
[1:17:38] you
[1:17:39] so many things that are unique about the
[1:17:41] seventh and last age
[1:17:44] preach a whole sermon on it but not
[1:17:46] going to do that today
[1:17:48] we've talked about it before
[1:17:50] but we find that one of the things that
[1:17:52] make it unique
[1:17:54] is that bro
[1:17:55] that this age brother branham was
[1:17:58] identified
[1:17:59] by brother branham as unfolding
[1:18:02] under the under the beginning under the
[1:18:04] fourth trumpet which which was unfolding
[1:18:08] in history just prior to the turn of the
[1:18:10] 20th century and brother branham goes
[1:18:13] back to identify it because it was part
[1:18:14] of the depravity of the world the sun
[1:18:16] wouldn't shine the moon and the stars
[1:18:18] wouldn't give their light and brother
[1:18:19] branham says see there the world was
[1:18:21] turning away from the word christ is the
[1:18:23] sun the moon the church is going dark so
[1:18:25] so we already see
[1:18:27] the uh the under under the fourth
[1:18:29] trumpet
[1:18:30] and then and then when you come into the
[1:18:32] fifth trumpet then you find right around
[1:18:34] the turn of the century you've got an
[1:18:37] angel descending
[1:18:38] and given a key to the bottomless pit
[1:18:41] and to and brother branham takes that
[1:18:44] angel and ties him back to zechariah how
[1:18:46] art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer or
[1:18:49] isaiah son of the morning
[1:18:51] and shows that that angel that fell with
[1:18:53] the key to the bottomless pit was
[1:18:54] lucifer and he's been given now an extra
[1:18:58] power in the earth because now things
[1:18:59] are starting to pick up speed
[1:19:01] this thing is arriving to the seventh
[1:19:03] and final age the it won't be but just a
[1:19:06] few decades and god will be standing in
[1:19:08] a cave
[1:19:09] telling a prophet i'm going to sing you
[1:19:11] to the world with a ministry of divine
[1:19:13] healing
[1:19:14] amen
[1:19:15] and see so so now when satan has been
[1:19:17] given all this extra power and released
[1:19:19] all of these demons into the world
[1:19:21] then you've got god as i've said to you
[1:19:23] before and i'm repeating it you've got
[1:19:25] god back over here starting to inspire
[1:19:27] parnum and grant and lake and seymour
[1:19:30] and these guys and you've got the holy
[1:19:32] spirit pouring out on azusa street in
[1:19:34] los angeles because why when the enemy
[1:19:37] comes in like a flood god raises up a
[1:19:39] standard
[1:19:42] and then you're gonna move on from there
[1:19:43] and you're gonna find out that under the
[1:19:45] sixth trumpet then you're gonna find
[1:19:48] that the
[1:19:49] the the 200 million demons are released
[1:19:52] from euphrates that's history
[1:19:54] that's not a
[1:19:55] sixth trumpet on brother ram says all
[1:19:58] the trumpets sound under the sixth seal
[1:20:00] and the six seals tribulation so none of
[1:20:03] them sound till the tribulation wrong
[1:20:06] it's just that one is fullness one is
[1:20:08] partial
[1:20:09] just like the seals we have the full
[1:20:11] opening of the seals my brother adam
[1:20:12] says back in the ages the seal was
[1:20:14] partially opened and there was a and
[1:20:16] when they rejected it he dropped a
[1:20:18] temporary judgment a temporary plague
[1:20:21] that you can read about in its fullness
[1:20:22] coming under the seventh vial during the
[1:20:25] time of the tribulation period
[1:20:28] or whatever age the rejection was taking
[1:20:31] place you'd have a corresponding
[1:20:33] temporary partial judgment coming from
[1:20:35] that corresponding vial
[1:20:38] so i just want to keep all of that
[1:20:39] straight in your head
[1:20:40] i i started to draw it but i thought i
[1:20:42] can explain it better and just give you
[1:20:45] a uh
[1:20:46] let you have a visual image i'm happy to
[1:20:48] answer any questions if you're not quite
[1:20:51] catching it all right just try to try to
[1:20:52] stay with me so
[1:20:54] and and you're i'm sure you've noticed
[1:20:56] by now
[1:20:57] i say things and repeat them and i'm
[1:21:00] repeating things now i've already
[1:21:01] repeated and it's because that's how
[1:21:03] you're going to learn it the best is to
[1:21:05] constantly you'll finally you'll get to
[1:21:07] a point you'll you'll start to see the
[1:21:08] picture and it'll all start to make
[1:21:09] sense all right so just stay with it
[1:21:12] so now we find then that he he talks
[1:21:15] about how that through the fourth and
[1:21:17] the six trumpets with their correlating
[1:21:19] vials you're going to start seeing god
[1:21:22] move in the earth in the last age coming
[1:21:25] to the last laodicean age all right now
[1:21:28] i'm going to show you correlation all
[1:21:30] right
[1:21:32] this is correlation between the trumpets
[1:21:34] and the vials you'll notice revelation 8
[1:21:37] 7 the first angels sounded they're
[1:21:38] followed hail fire and mingled blood and
[1:21:40] they were cast where upon the earth and
[1:21:43] the third parts of the tree see a third
[1:21:44] part third a third see it's temporary
[1:21:47] it's in time it's not in the tribulation
[1:21:49] in the tribulation the the vial is going
[1:21:51] to be poured out in its fullness
[1:21:53] all right but now watch
[1:21:55] and so look here in the first vial and
[1:21:57] the first went and poured out his vile
[1:21:59] where upon the earth see and there fell
[1:22:02] annoys him and grievous swore upon men
[1:22:03] which had the mark of the beast and upon
[1:22:05] them which worshipped the image right
[1:22:07] you can track that all the way back into
[1:22:09] the church ages brother branham didn't
[1:22:11] do that i'm not going to try to do that
[1:22:14] because it would be presumptuous but
[1:22:16] what what you need to where it's really
[1:22:18] going to get important is when we get to
[1:22:20] the seventh one
[1:22:21] all you need to understand now is they
[1:22:23] were running hand in hand and these
[1:22:25] vials were playing out among the jews
[1:22:27] and among the gentiles partially all
[1:22:29] right watch second trumpet and the
[1:22:32] second angel sounded as it were a great
[1:22:34] mountain burning with fire all right
[1:22:36] remember the ages and seals uh relate to
[1:22:39] the gentiles trumpets are to the jews
[1:22:42] and the vials are the plagues that fall
[1:22:43] under both of them and the second angel
[1:22:45] sounded great mountain burning with fire
[1:22:47] was cast into the sea there are
[1:22:50] cataclysmic events that happened in
[1:22:53] history of the last 2000 years when i
[1:22:55] look at them and i look at some of these
[1:22:57] descriptions i go yeah that's probably a
[1:23:00] connection but i'm not going to preach
[1:23:02] that because i don't have the authority
[1:23:03] of a prophet and he didn't preach that
[1:23:05] all right all right
[1:23:07] so he said so we only want to be able to
[1:23:09] say what a prophet taught us and and
[1:23:11] anything i say i promise you can be
[1:23:12] supported in the quotes
[1:23:15] so he says
[1:23:16] a great mountain burning with fire cast
[1:23:18] in the sea and a third part of the sea
[1:23:19] became blood third part of the creatures
[1:23:21] were dead la and and had life died and
[1:23:24] the third part of the ships were
[1:23:25] destroyed revel now the second vial and
[1:23:27] the second angel poured out his vow
[1:23:28] where upon the sea
[1:23:30] because it correlates to the second
[1:23:32] trumpet all right third
[1:23:34] and the third angel sounded and there
[1:23:36] fell a great star from heaven
[1:23:38] burning as it were a lamp and it fell
[1:23:40] upon the third part of the rivers and
[1:23:42] fountains of waters and the name of the
[1:23:44] stars called wormwood in the third part
[1:23:46] here it is again third of the waters
[1:23:47] became wormwood and many men died of the
[1:23:49] waters because they made bitter third
[1:23:51] vial and the third angel poured out his
[1:23:53] vial upon where the rivers and fountains
[1:23:55] of waters see they became blood and it
[1:23:57] goes on and on and on and on
[1:23:59] trumpet four
[1:24:00] uh and the fourth angel sounded and the
[1:24:03] third part of the sun
[1:24:05] was smitten and the third part of the
[1:24:07] moon and the third part of the stars and
[1:24:08] when when brother branham is preaching
[1:24:10] on revelations uh chapter three chapter
[1:24:13] four chapter five he goes and starts
[1:24:16] interpreting these symbols
[1:24:18] even though he's not preaching on the
[1:24:19] trumpet he he he because some of this
[1:24:22] language appears in the ages also and
[1:24:24] brother branham gives us the universal
[1:24:26] meaning of it that you can apply and
[1:24:28] extrapolate throughout we'll see you'll
[1:24:30] see that in a few minutes
[1:24:32] and so it was smitten in the third part
[1:24:33] of the moon and the third part of the
[1:24:34] stars
[1:24:36] so as the third part of them was
[1:24:37] darkened and the day shown not for a
[1:24:39] third part of it and the night likewise
[1:24:41] now look at the fourth violin the fourth
[1:24:43] angel poured out his vile here it is
[1:24:45] upon the sun power was given unto him to
[1:24:47] scorch men with fire all right great
[1:24:49] heat they blasphemed god
[1:24:52] which had power over these plagues they
[1:24:54] repented not listen
[1:24:56] judgment comes for the purpose of
[1:25:00] repentance
[1:25:02] god is not maniacal sadistic he's not a
[1:25:05] troll he's not evil he doesn't he he he
[1:25:08] loves life
[1:25:10] he loves humanity
[1:25:12] he says to the world why will you die
[1:25:14] why will you not come to me and live
[1:25:17] no god doesn't send anybody to hell
[1:25:19] brother branham said anybody that goes
[1:25:21] to hell will have to fight every step of
[1:25:23] the way because god will try everything
[1:25:24] he can to block him
[1:25:26] so you say oh the judgment comes upon
[1:25:29] this situation or that situation or this
[1:25:31] church or that person just just rejoice
[1:25:34] because the judgment comes for
[1:25:36] repentance
[1:25:37] in the tribulation they can't repent but
[1:25:41] right now they still can repent
[1:25:44] hallelujah
[1:25:47] so he poured it up upon the sun fourth
[1:25:49] vial all right let's move on trumpet
[1:25:52] five
[1:25:53] the fifth angel sounded star here it is
[1:25:55] says lucifer fall from heaven unto the
[1:25:57] earth to him was given the key to the
[1:25:58] bottomless pit brother branham ties him
[1:26:00] right back to the old testament how are
[1:26:02] thou fallen from heaven lucifer son of
[1:26:03] the morning he opened the bottomless pit
[1:26:05] and there was a smoke of the pit as the
[1:26:07] smoke of a great furnace and the sun and
[1:26:09] the air were darkened by reason of the
[1:26:10] smoke of the pit under the vial and the
[1:26:12] fifth angel poured out his vial upon the
[1:26:14] seat of the beast and his kingdom was
[1:26:16] what here it is full of darkness and
[1:26:18] they gnawed their tongues for pain and
[1:26:20] blasphemed the god of heaven because of
[1:26:21] their pains and their sores and repented
[1:26:24] not of their deeds trumpet six
[1:26:26] and the sixth angel poured out his voice
[1:26:30] from the four horns of the golden altar
[1:26:32] which is before god saying to the sixth
[1:26:34] angel which had the trumpet loose the
[1:26:36] four angels which are bound in the great
[1:26:39] river euphrates now
[1:26:41] now you're coming to the book of
[1:26:43] revelation where you've got four angels
[1:26:46] standing on the winds of the earth
[1:26:47] controlling world war
[1:26:49] and the walls have have need the woes
[1:26:52] have just been waiting first world
[1:26:53] second world third woe which is going to
[1:26:55] bring the first world war the second
[1:26:57] world war and armageddon and and when
[1:26:59] the first woe starts through the earth
[1:27:02] it would have just went one two three
[1:27:05] and it would have just swept the earth
[1:27:07] clean of of all humanity but there came
[1:27:10] an angel who rose out of the east with
[1:27:12] the seal of the living god it showed it
[1:27:14] was christ because christ is the only
[1:27:16] one who can seal you
[1:27:19] oh hallelujah he comes with a seal of
[1:27:21] the living god and says wait i got
[1:27:23] children down there hold your horses
[1:27:26] hold up everything i gotta redeem him i
[1:27:28] gotta find him i gotta get a prophet and
[1:27:31] drop him down in an interval in a space
[1:27:33] of time between the sixth trumpet and
[1:27:35] the seventh trumpet and the sixth seal
[1:27:37] and the seventh seal i gotta send elijah
[1:27:39] and pull a pride out of there and then i
[1:27:41] gotta then the eagle's gonna lift up and
[1:27:43] the bride will go home and the eagle
[1:27:44] will fly east and pick up moses and
[1:27:46] elijah and he'll find my 144 thousand
[1:27:51] amen so he put he puts a temporary
[1:27:54] injunction
[1:27:55] on the prophecy see
[1:27:58] and so when he comes here into into into
[1:28:00] the vial
[1:28:02] see because here the the great river
[1:28:03] euphrates
[1:28:05] and those and so the those that's where
[1:28:07] you're going to get in in another place
[1:28:08] those 200 million
[1:28:10] chargers all right
[1:28:12] the six angel sits vial
[1:28:14] the sixth angel poured out his vial
[1:28:16] where upon the great river euphrates and
[1:28:19] the water there it was dried up that the
[1:28:20] way of the kings of the east might be
[1:28:22] prepared and the and all of the prophecy
[1:28:25] teachers think that's china that's
[1:28:27] nothing to do with china
[1:28:29] it's that it's because listen here's a
[1:28:31] good way to think of the vile
[1:28:33] the vile
[1:28:34] makes the way
[1:28:36] for the antichrist to take the next step
[1:28:39] so so when it's time for him to go after
[1:28:43] the jews
[1:28:44] we find waters dried up
[1:28:47] spiritually which release demons
[1:28:49] who are trapped there and they and now
[1:28:51] the antichrist has taken another step to
[1:28:53] do what annihilate god's people but it
[1:28:56] was all the tender hand of jehovah god
[1:28:58] was playing him the whole time
[1:29:02] oh my
[1:29:05] now we come
[1:29:07] we come to the
[1:29:09] seventh and i apologize it's so small i
[1:29:12] had to fit it all on one screen
[1:29:15] and the seventh angel sounded
[1:29:18] and there were great voices in heaven
[1:29:20] saying the kingdoms of this world
[1:29:22] are become the kingdoms of our lord and
[1:29:24] of his christ and he shall reign forever
[1:29:27] and ever and the four and twenty elders
[1:29:29] which sat before god on their seats fell
[1:29:31] upon their faces and worshiped god
[1:29:33] saying we give thee thanks move that
[1:29:36] curse of please we give thee thanks lord
[1:29:38] god almighty which art and was and art
[1:29:41] to come because thou has taken to thee
[1:29:43] thy great power and has reigned and the
[1:29:46] nations were angry and thy wrath is
[1:29:49] common the time of the dead that they
[1:29:51] should be judged and that thou should
[1:29:53] just give reward unto thy servants the
[1:29:54] prophets and to the states and them that
[1:29:57] fear thy name
[1:29:58] small and great and should us destroy
[1:30:00] them which destroy the earth now watch
[1:30:03] verse 19 and the temple of god was
[1:30:05] opened in heaven and there were seen in
[1:30:07] his temple the ark of his testament and
[1:30:10] there were lightnings and voices and
[1:30:12] thunderings and an earthquake and great
[1:30:13] hail those five things along with the
[1:30:16] with the ark of the testament now look
[1:30:19] at the vial and the seventh angel poured
[1:30:22] out his vial where into the air
[1:30:25] now here's where we've been showing you
[1:30:27] that temporary portion
[1:30:30] amen
[1:30:31] all right now i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm
[1:30:33] gonna connect it just carry on
[1:30:35] because we see that happening
[1:30:38] temporarily now
[1:30:40] before we go into the tribulation and it
[1:30:42] is that it is that thing released into
[1:30:44] the air that brings satan's eden and
[1:30:47] causes the world to go insane see watch
[1:30:51] now and i'm going to prove it so let's
[1:30:52] hold on
[1:30:54] the seven things are poured out as
[1:30:55] violent into the air and there came a
[1:30:56] great voice out of the temple of heaven
[1:30:58] from the throne saying it is done now
[1:31:00] watch verse 18 and there were voices and
[1:31:02] thunders and lightnings and there was a
[1:31:04] great earthquake such as was not since
[1:31:07] men were upon the earth so mighty an
[1:31:09] earthquake this is the earthquake that
[1:31:11] brother branham ties back to the old
[1:31:13] testament prophecy i believe in ezekiel
[1:31:16] or jeremiah can't remember that this is
[1:31:18] jerusalem the city will people think
[1:31:20] it's rome
[1:31:22] all revelation teachers think that's
[1:31:24] rome being divided into three parts not
[1:31:26] rome gets burned with nuclear fire
[1:31:29] rome gets torched by atomic radiation
[1:31:32] jerusalem breaks into three parts and
[1:31:34] that's where the mount of olives begins
[1:31:35] to break up right there in jerusalem to
[1:31:37] create because because when brother
[1:31:39] branham is preaching the in the uh the
[1:31:42] future home he uses the same scripture
[1:31:45] of a holy mountain to describe the
[1:31:47] millennium and the new heavens and the
[1:31:49] new earth
[1:31:51] so there is going to be a headquarters
[1:31:52] in the millennium there's not going to
[1:31:54] be the city john saw but there is going
[1:31:56] to be palaces and there is going to be
[1:31:58] government there is going to be his
[1:31:59] family and priests and kings ruling and
[1:32:01] reigning with christ a thousand years
[1:32:04] so
[1:32:06] so we find then
[1:32:08] there's this great earthquake so
[1:32:10] i don't see it as being california
[1:32:12] because brother branham thought we would
[1:32:14] see california and we certainly don't
[1:32:15] see jerusalem broke into three parts
[1:32:18] so he so i think california's the
[1:32:20] fulfillment of matthew 27 and 28 on the
[1:32:23] on resurrection morning the graves of
[1:32:25] them which slept arose uh and oh because
[1:32:28] there was two earthquakes there was an
[1:32:29] earthquake on good friday in matthew 27
[1:32:32] and brother branham says the events of
[1:32:34] matthew 27 repeat at the end time and
[1:32:36] that's why when brother branham
[1:32:38] just like the seventh vial brother
[1:32:40] branham throws a rock up into the air
[1:32:43] and says judgment striking the west
[1:32:45] coast and the judgments under the
[1:32:47] seventh vial begin with alaska
[1:32:50] and it's going to move and move and move
[1:32:52] and move and it's going to take
[1:32:54] california out and it's causing the
[1:32:56] madness that you see in the world and it
[1:32:58] starts with the last guy and moves all
[1:32:59] the way and the bride goes home the the
[1:33:02] stops are all pulled out satan's wagon
[1:33:04] and that church following a witch goes
[1:33:06] off into the abyss but the bride is
[1:33:09] marching upward hallelujah
[1:33:12] oh my
[1:33:15] now so he says and every island fled
[1:33:17] away in the mountains were not found and
[1:33:19] there fell upon me in a great hail see
[1:33:21] all of those signs under the seventh
[1:33:22] trumpet are in the vile
[1:33:25] weighing about a talent men blasphemed
[1:33:27] god because of the plague of the hail
[1:33:29] for the plague thereof was exceeding
[1:33:31] great so when it's falling in its
[1:33:34] fullness
[1:33:35] all they can do
[1:33:36] is blaspheme
[1:33:38] see there's no way brother branham says
[1:33:41] no one is saved during the millennium
[1:33:44] the unwise virgin are not saved in the
[1:33:46] millennium
[1:33:48] she's already saved but she goes into
[1:33:51] the tribulation to be purged for her sin
[1:33:53] of unbelief and rejecting the message
[1:33:55] see and so so he's he's purging he's
[1:33:58] purging the remnant he's purging israel
[1:34:01] and he's purging the earth during the
[1:34:04] millennium now all right
[1:34:06] let me pause right there
[1:34:10] all right
[1:34:11] hang on
[1:34:12] you good
[1:34:14] man i don't see anybody's ears smoking
[1:34:16] yet so
[1:34:17] we're we're good amen brother joe give
[1:34:19] me a thumbs up if brother joe is good we
[1:34:21] should all be good
[1:34:22] amen praise the lord
[1:34:26] so so when you go now and so
[1:34:29] you know and you and and as i said to
[1:34:32] those who might be listening to this you
[1:34:34] you have to go to everything brother
[1:34:36] branham taught because it it takes it
[1:34:38] takes a lot of study
[1:34:40] and and countless hours and and midnight
[1:34:44] oil over years to get the full picture
[1:34:47] so you know brother branham translates
[1:34:50] what voices and thunderings and
[1:34:52] lightnings are but he doesn't preach a
[1:34:54] sermon called the seventh vial where he
[1:34:55] interprets it where he interprets it is
[1:34:58] back when he's preaching revelation
[1:35:00] chapter 3. and there brother branham
[1:35:03] comes in and says you notice in here it
[1:35:05] was not a mercy seat for there was
[1:35:07] lightnings and thunder and voices
[1:35:10] there's no there there's no lightning
[1:35:12] and thunders at mercy that's judgment
[1:35:16] see
[1:35:18] so
[1:35:18] lightnings thunder and voices so so then
[1:35:22] now so out of the throne
[1:35:25] is lightning and thunder so now because
[1:35:28] why
[1:35:29] this is the time where we've entered
[1:35:30] into judgment now in the tribulation
[1:35:32] it's all full complete judgment right
[1:35:34] now you're seeing life and death go
[1:35:37] forward right now you're seeing a word
[1:35:39] that can give life to believe it and at
[1:35:41] the same time god will issue an
[1:35:43] indictment to the age
[1:35:45] it's a unique time that's never happened
[1:35:48] before see
[1:35:50] and so we find that john is being taken
[1:35:53] forward here and and and you you if you
[1:35:55] want to go home and read that that's
[1:35:56] revelation 4 5 and out of the throne
[1:35:58] proceeded lightnings and thunderings and
[1:35:59] voices and there were seven lamps of
[1:36:01] fire burning before the throne which are
[1:36:04] the seven spirits of god so now watch so
[1:36:07] now you've got all your messengers
[1:36:09] you've got your judgment lightnings your
[1:36:10] judgment thunders you've got your voices
[1:36:12] of the of the messengers see so out of
[1:36:15] the throne is lightning and thunder and
[1:36:18] john now in revelation 4 is being taken
[1:36:20] forward in time and he's literally moved
[1:36:23] into where
[1:36:24] where what's revelation 4 the rapture
[1:36:27] cycle
[1:36:28] so he we we've been caught up out of the
[1:36:31] age god closed off a church age now not
[1:36:34] an eighth age it's a it's an age within
[1:36:37] an age it's a bright age contained in
[1:36:39] the last age
[1:36:40] and that's why brother branham said it's
[1:36:42] now the time of the word and the word
[1:36:44] only now word and word only does not
[1:36:47] mean
[1:36:47] word no spirit
[1:36:49] it doesn't mean that at all it just
[1:36:51] simply is saying that everything we
[1:36:54] believe is only the word
[1:36:56] that now i'm throwing out all man-made
[1:36:59] ideology all man-made ideas all
[1:37:01] organized religion and the bride has
[1:37:03] thus saith the lord or she says nothing
[1:37:07] in other words everything she says is
[1:37:10] thus saith the lord by a prophet
[1:37:13] see but you don't discount the spirit
[1:37:15] it's the spirit that gives life to the
[1:37:18] word amen see
[1:37:22] so we find then that the throne
[1:37:25] so john now here is seeing this rapture
[1:37:27] cycle he's taken into the heavenly realm
[1:37:29] he's looking at what is taking place
[1:37:31] there and the throne of course
[1:37:32] represents a judgment throne as brother
[1:37:34] branham showed it's not a not a throne
[1:37:36] of mercy see there they then then here's
[1:37:40] seven lamps of fire burning before that
[1:37:42] throne which are the seven spirits of
[1:37:44] god so now here's the voices
[1:37:48] as brother brennan would say
[1:37:50] the voice of judgment what is it the
[1:37:52] voice of the ministers
[1:37:54] down through the ages
[1:37:56] who cried through the holy spirit see so
[1:38:00] now you've got these voices you've got
[1:38:02] christ speaking through his messengers
[1:38:05] and once the messenger watch this now
[1:38:08] i'm going to show you another unique
[1:38:09] point
[1:38:10] once the messenger
[1:38:12] was was taken from the earth
[1:38:15] then what does history teach us what did
[1:38:17] brother branham prove in the church ages
[1:38:19] that they denominated the movement
[1:38:22] amen
[1:38:23] am i right how many how many message
[1:38:26] readers
[1:38:29] when the messenger was taken
[1:38:31] here you've got these seven messengers
[1:38:33] these seven spirits of god god's not
[1:38:35] seven persons
[1:38:36] it's god speaking through messengers
[1:38:39] and so we find that when that messenger
[1:38:43] is taken from the earth then they
[1:38:45] denominate the movement by disbelieving
[1:38:48] the word for their age and its messenger
[1:38:51] and this then releases a temporary
[1:38:54] judgment into the earth
[1:38:57] under the correlating vial correlating
[1:38:59] to that age and that messenger
[1:39:01] partially
[1:39:03] temporarily you see
[1:39:05] so now we're at the seventh age now
[1:39:08] we've come down to the seventh age
[1:39:10] and this age now here's a unique thing
[1:39:13] this age
[1:39:15] didn't have to uh wait if i could put it
[1:39:18] that way every age they had to wait till
[1:39:20] the messenger ran his course and was
[1:39:22] taken and then they denominated and that
[1:39:24] was it in the in the age that we that we
[1:39:27] live in we find that that we that that
[1:39:30] we didn't have to wait until the
[1:39:32] messenger left
[1:39:33] because his ministry is the ministry of
[1:39:37] pointing to the messenger in the latter
[1:39:40] rain which is christ
[1:39:42] and that's why he says at the end i'll
[1:39:44] give you the former rain and i'll give
[1:39:45] you the latter rain but then there's
[1:39:46] going to come a time i'm going to pour
[1:39:48] the former rain and the latter rain out
[1:39:50] in the same month
[1:39:52] and and the reapers will overtake the
[1:39:54] sowers
[1:39:55] oh do you understand friends who who are
[1:39:58] who i mean i mean the sowers overtake
[1:40:00] the reapers because the sowers for the
[1:40:02] next ages moses and elijah and the
[1:40:04] reapers who are still in the field
[1:40:06] trying to gather the harvest of the
[1:40:08] pride and you've already got judgments
[1:40:10] moving in and messengers ready to go and
[1:40:12] god's ready to get a move on and the
[1:40:14] pride is getting ready and you've got
[1:40:16] these you've got this anointing saying
[1:40:18] to you bride hey clear the field go in
[1:40:20] the rapture get out of here we gotta sow
[1:40:23] for the next event
[1:40:25] that's the hour that we live in friends
[1:40:27] you're being pushed out of here by the
[1:40:29] anointing of the holy spirit
[1:40:33] i feel the pull
[1:40:36] it's drawing me somewhere
[1:40:40] so we find then that
[1:40:42] that he's pointing to the messenger the
[1:40:44] seventh angel
[1:40:46] points to the messenger in the latter
[1:40:47] ring because that's christ he didn't
[1:40:49] bring people to himself we and branham
[1:40:51] didn't do that people who say he did are
[1:40:52] lying that's a false accusation
[1:40:55] he actually never did that
[1:40:57] he pointed people to christ constantly
[1:40:59] see
[1:41:00] and so he he's pointing to the messenger
[1:41:03] and the latter raid which is the
[1:41:04] identified christ of all ages and this
[1:41:06] is exactly now
[1:41:09] this is exactly why
[1:41:11] that that that when he when he comes to
[1:41:14] declare
[1:41:15] the identified christ in all the ages
[1:41:18] that he can
[1:41:19] he can say
[1:41:21] i indict this generation
[1:41:24] in the presence of the judge
[1:41:27] so now there's been a transition
[1:41:30] now seals have been opened the mighty
[1:41:32] angel has descended down the open book
[1:41:35] has been given to the messenger who's
[1:41:36] then given it to the people why because
[1:41:39] the ministry of the son of man has to be
[1:41:41] restored in the church not just the
[1:41:43] office of son of man paul held the
[1:41:45] office of son of man jesus walked in the
[1:41:47] office of son of man but the ministry of
[1:41:49] the son of man is that word made flesh
[1:41:51] in people and when the holy ghost came
[1:41:53] in the upper room that became the
[1:41:55] ministry the continuation of jesus
[1:41:57] christ
[1:41:58] the ministry of the son of man the word
[1:42:02] made flesh and what did they do they
[1:42:04] opened blinded eyes they raised the dead
[1:42:06] they healed the lame they preached the
[1:42:08] gospel they walked out of prison
[1:42:10] hallelujah
[1:42:12] and that's what the last day messenger
[1:42:14] was to bring back he was to bring back
[1:42:16] the office of son of man therefore
[1:42:19] christ could come down and through that
[1:42:21] message come into his church and once
[1:42:23] again we have the ministry of the son of
[1:42:26] man the word made flesh in a pride at
[1:42:29] the last day no wonder satan is afraid
[1:42:32] of you
[1:42:35] no wonder he fears you
[1:42:37] no wonder he attacks you
[1:42:40] see
[1:42:43] so the judgments did did not need to
[1:42:45] wait
[1:42:46] until the age ended the indictment came
[1:42:49] and the judgments began to fall
[1:42:52] ah while elijah was still sounding
[1:42:54] starting in alaska
[1:42:56] they didn't need to wait until the age
[1:42:58] ended
[1:42:59] in the tribulation because the last part
[1:43:02] of the seventh age
[1:43:03] is a bright age which never ends
[1:43:06] the kingdoms of this world revelation 11
[1:43:09] the kingdoms of this world have become
[1:43:12] the kingdoms of our lord and of his
[1:43:15] christ that's not true lord that's not
[1:43:18] teaching to lord doctrine that's
[1:43:20] teaching christ and his bride
[1:43:22] it's become the kingdoms of our lord and
[1:43:25] of his anointed family see so brother
[1:43:28] branham identifies that as his bride
[1:43:30] so we find then that lightnings and
[1:43:33] thunderings and voices
[1:43:35] now here's a beautiful part i'll
[1:43:36] probably have to close here because i'm
[1:43:38] just flat out of time
[1:43:39] and i'm not going to be able to finish
[1:43:41] not going to be able to even get to my
[1:43:42] pause place but it's okay
[1:43:44] all right all right thanks moe
[1:43:46] all right now that's about what i need
[1:43:48] i'm i can finish a few a few minutes
[1:43:50] inside of that
[1:43:52] so now
[1:43:53] listen friends
[1:43:55] here's something to put a shot in your
[1:43:56] arm
[1:43:58] lightnings and thunderings and voices
[1:44:02] also represent deliverance
[1:44:04] to god's people because when god
[1:44:08] called israel
[1:44:09] out of egypt in the first exodus
[1:44:12] and now here we are in the third exodus
[1:44:15] and when god called
[1:44:16] israel out of egypt under the first
[1:44:18] exodus
[1:44:19] there were lightnings and there were
[1:44:21] thunderings and there were voices and it
[1:44:24] was judgment to egypt but it was
[1:44:26] deliverance
[1:44:29] to israel it was a coming out of oh my
[1:44:32] friends because there were there those
[1:44:35] of god's family who right while the
[1:44:37] judgments were pouring out they were
[1:44:39] safe in goshen
[1:44:41] hallelujah while the world was in
[1:44:43] darkness goshen had light while the
[1:44:45] world was suffering the loss of their
[1:44:46] firstborn israel was under a token
[1:44:49] hallelujah
[1:44:51] oh my friend so we we see then the
[1:44:54] giving of life
[1:44:56] with this message in this bright age at
[1:44:59] this hour
[1:45:00] we see the giving of life and the
[1:45:03] releasing of judgment
[1:45:05] under an indictment
[1:45:07] simultaneously amen
[1:45:10] see
[1:45:11] that's unique
[1:45:13] it's simultaneous because it's the
[1:45:16] ministry of the son of man
[1:45:18] again
[1:45:20] see
[1:45:21] and we're we're
[1:45:23] living
[1:45:24] right
[1:45:25] in the big middle of it
[1:45:28] it's judgment to a dying world
[1:45:31] but to the bride
[1:45:32] it's the power of transformation
[1:45:35] hallelujah it's the power of
[1:45:36] transformation it's judgment to the
[1:45:38] world it's darkness to the world but
[1:45:40] arise shine shalom bright arise shine my
[1:45:44] light has come
[1:45:46] hallelujah
[1:45:52] you know
[1:45:56] let me just let me just turn a corner i
[1:45:58] i want to try to get to this part
[1:46:01] and no i'm still going to stay within my
[1:46:02] time just watch
[1:46:05] so now
[1:46:07] you're going to find that no members
[1:46:11] and i and i can say this authoritatively
[1:46:13] because i grew up
[1:46:15] you know in the age after the prophet
[1:46:16] was gone and
[1:46:18] i i you know i
[1:46:21] always tried to position myself near
[1:46:22] preachers
[1:46:24] feeling as a little boy someday i would
[1:46:26] do that
[1:46:27] and you know
[1:46:29] when brother eddie was
[1:46:31] having deep discussions
[1:46:33] you know i was always with an ear
[1:46:34] listening
[1:46:35] you know discussing it with other
[1:46:36] ministers and brother eddie
[1:46:38] was kind of on the inside of things
[1:46:40] because he was personal deep deep very
[1:46:42] close personal friends with perry green
[1:46:44] very personal friends of oliveio and uh
[1:46:47] very very personal friends with brother
[1:46:48] collins at the tabernacle there and and
[1:46:51] going there as a child gave me some
[1:46:53] inside track and i can just tell you
[1:46:55] friends and then as i grew up and began
[1:46:57] to minister myself
[1:46:58] you know there was no member of the
[1:47:00] fivefold ministry or even even dare i
[1:47:02] say a prophet in his day
[1:47:05] that thought
[1:47:06] we would still be here this side of
[1:47:09] eternity now
[1:47:13] yeah
[1:47:14] it's it's you know there was a there was
[1:47:16] a unanimous
[1:47:18] around the world no one who followed the
[1:47:21] the teachings of god's prophet not even
[1:47:23] brother branham
[1:47:25] now
[1:47:26] i got to say it like this brother
[1:47:27] branham knew we could be
[1:47:29] and he said that
[1:47:30] he said that very clearly he said i
[1:47:32] could miss it many miles he said it
[1:47:34] might go on another 100 years and i just
[1:47:36] thought to myself you know i remember
[1:47:38] years ago in the in the late 80s and how
[1:47:40] crazy the world was then which looked
[1:47:42] like nothing compared to now and the 80s
[1:47:44] look and the 80s made the 60s look like
[1:47:46] nothing
[1:47:47] and so it's just gotten worse and it got
[1:47:50] impossibly worse until it couldn't get
[1:47:51] any worse and then it did
[1:47:53] and that's where we are and i'm here to
[1:47:55] tell you it'll continue to get worse
[1:47:58] say i can't imagine it's already beyond
[1:48:00] what you can imagine
[1:48:02] you couldn't imagine five years ago
[1:48:04] where we'd be now
[1:48:06] with the laws that they're passing and
[1:48:07] the and the the the attitude and the
[1:48:10] social fabric of the nation and of the
[1:48:12] world
[1:48:13] it's it's it's madness it's it's crazy
[1:48:16] we look at it and we go has everybody
[1:48:17] just lost their mind they have
[1:48:20] see
[1:48:21] and so
[1:48:22] the only thing that's held us in check
[1:48:24] is the mind of christ
[1:48:26] see
[1:48:27] that's why i was saying one time about
[1:48:29] things old-fashioned
[1:48:30] and you know the only the only reason
[1:48:32] something got old-fashioned is because
[1:48:34] time progressed and they changed at one
[1:48:37] time here was a certain style and women
[1:48:39] the women all dressed in dresses and
[1:48:41] modest and and nothing you know showing
[1:48:43] and decent and modest and men were
[1:48:45] tipped their hat and didn't curse in
[1:48:47] public and and didn't even spit in front
[1:48:49] of a woman
[1:48:50] and you say oh that's old-fashioned well
[1:48:52] that's only old-fashioned cause time
[1:48:54] kept going and people backslid that
[1:48:56] didn't change the fact that there's
[1:48:57] still decency
[1:49:00] it didn't change the fact you see so i
[1:49:02] i'm i'm interested in the in the in the
[1:49:04] word i don't care about the style
[1:49:07] i want the word
[1:49:09] because the style will always and what's
[1:49:11] old is new and what goes around will
[1:49:13] come right back around again and you you
[1:49:15] chase that stuff you'll go nuts you'll
[1:49:17] spend a third of your income just trying
[1:49:19] to keep up with fashions and styles
[1:49:20] don't do it
[1:49:22] hallelujah put on what you like what
[1:49:24] looks comfortable and what keeps you
[1:49:25] decent modest and a testimony of jesus
[1:49:27] christ
[1:49:29] let the world go crazy
[1:49:32] don't go crazy with them
[1:49:33] see
[1:49:36] so brother branham knew it could go on
[1:49:37] ministers knew it could the bride
[1:49:40] certainly i think i speak for us all
[1:49:42] the bride wanted to be
[1:49:45] long gone
[1:49:46] long ago
[1:49:48] you know um
[1:49:50] 50 plus years ago yeah
[1:49:53] i mean i thought this morning how i
[1:49:56] would love to be 50 years deep into the
[1:49:58] millennium right now
[1:50:01] man about how to run away when i thought
[1:50:03] about that and i started getting excited
[1:50:05] i thought how i would love to be 50
[1:50:07] years
[1:50:08] deep into the millennium still at 950
[1:50:10] years to go but those first 50 have been
[1:50:13] epic
[1:50:14] and here we are
[1:50:15] still this side of eternity
[1:50:18] see
[1:50:19] and just as god i say well brother jason
[1:50:21] can you speak to that i think i can at
[1:50:23] least it and what helps me when i
[1:50:25] rationalize it i realize you know by by
[1:50:28] teaching that god brother brown talks
[1:50:30] about how that god wouldn't allow the
[1:50:31] early church
[1:50:32] to know it's going to be you know they
[1:50:34] they thought he him his coming is
[1:50:36] imminent he didn't let him know brother
[1:50:38] brown talks about that he didn't let him
[1:50:39] know it's going to be 2 000 more years
[1:50:41] because that would have discouraged him
[1:50:43] see you always want to live with the
[1:50:44] imminency of he's coming soon
[1:50:48] he's coming soon and so so that that
[1:50:52] that that's helpful so the cup of
[1:50:53] iniquity
[1:50:55] but we found the cup of iniquity you
[1:50:58] know would have to be full
[1:51:00] and i i just want to i just want to give
[1:51:02] this plug for god can i do that
[1:51:05] the cup of iniquity
[1:51:07] we would have loved to have been gone 50
[1:51:09] years ago
[1:51:10] but but the cup of iniquity of fallen
[1:51:13] man
[1:51:14] would have to be full
[1:51:16] before a god of boundless mercy would
[1:51:19] finally end the gospel era to the
[1:51:22] gentiles
[1:51:24] and i'm here to tell you something
[1:51:25] friends he is a god of mercy
[1:51:28] and the bible says don't don't count as
[1:51:31] slackness just because the lord is
[1:51:33] delaying that's what you might count as
[1:51:35] slackness he said but to god it's not
[1:51:38] slackness but god is tenderhearted and
[1:51:40] merciful trying to give everybody a
[1:51:43] chance
[1:51:44] see
[1:51:44] so he's trying to find and redeem the
[1:51:47] last name in the lamb's book of life and
[1:51:50] call his bride home
[1:51:51] and then of course that dreadful time of
[1:51:53] jacob's trouble
[1:51:55] uh would set in and
[1:51:56] six thousand year human journey would
[1:51:59] come to a come around its final bend and
[1:52:02] uh finishing out its last 42 months when
[1:52:06] you're gone
[1:52:07] you say the clocks stop when we're gone
[1:52:09] no they actually just start
[1:52:11] 42 months and counting
[1:52:13] and every day they wake up it's one day
[1:52:16] less
[1:52:16] 42 months and counting
[1:52:19] and so we found that that what god
[1:52:23] that and brother branham was showing us
[1:52:26] that the two things now now we're going
[1:52:28] back to
[1:52:29] to
[1:52:30] rehearse what we learned and i think
[1:52:33] part one and partially in part two
[1:52:36] that the two things that brother branham
[1:52:38] showed us that would lead the church to
[1:52:42] armageddon
[1:52:43] one would be the trinity doctrine
[1:52:46] those three unclean spirits like frogs
[1:52:49] so
[1:52:50] so that that doesn't even come until you
[1:52:54] find that coming in the in the vials and
[1:52:58] so brother branham shows that it's
[1:53:00] coming between the sixth and seventh
[1:53:02] vial
[1:53:03] and that's already been and brother
[1:53:04] branham said that that look those frogs
[1:53:08] look back all the way back to when to
[1:53:10] babylon
[1:53:11] see and and it looks back to rome and
[1:53:13] rome looks back to babylon so you've got
[1:53:15] the same devil operating all the time
[1:53:18] only now it's coming into prophecy and
[1:53:21] we find at the last days that the
[1:53:23] trinity doctrine is going to give a
[1:53:25] power of solidarity to the religious
[1:53:27] world to bring them against you and i
[1:53:30] and it doesn't matter that your lives
[1:53:32] are holy and decent and righteous and
[1:53:34] you don't lie you don't kill you don't
[1:53:36] beat your wives you don't drink you
[1:53:38] don't do drugs you pay your bills you
[1:53:40] keep your word you're a good citizen and
[1:53:42] they hate you
[1:53:45] see i'm not i'm not talking about your
[1:53:46] hated universally i got plenty of
[1:53:48] friends who love and respect me i'm
[1:53:50] talking about the the beast system
[1:53:53] the demon powers that that control and
[1:53:56] and and i'm here to tell you something
[1:53:57] friends
[1:53:58] uh
[1:53:59] what according to bible prophecy the
[1:54:02] whole world will run after him whose
[1:54:05] names are not in the lamb's book of life
[1:54:07] you say well i got i got i know a lot of
[1:54:11] nice people that would never do that
[1:54:14] listen
[1:54:15] i don't care what you think
[1:54:17] about those nice people
[1:54:19] when demon power takes over their mind
[1:54:23] the bible says that they as a unified
[1:54:27] body of humanity will murder moses and
[1:54:30] elijah
[1:54:32] murder the 144 thousand and murder the
[1:54:35] unwise virgin
[1:54:37] they will slaughter them they will all
[1:54:39] be martyred during that time and a lot
[1:54:43] of nice people now won't be so nice then
[1:54:47] see
[1:54:48] and i would say in that time the only
[1:54:50] nice ones left will be the remnant of
[1:54:52] the woman's seed as far as gentiles are
[1:54:53] concerned and and the 144 thousand
[1:54:56] that's just a a drop in the bucket
[1:54:58] compared to the humanity so the whole
[1:55:00] world is going after that don't don't be
[1:55:03] naive and think scripture's not gonna
[1:55:05] like scripture you don't know what it's
[1:55:06] talking about
[1:55:07] scripture has never been wrong
[1:55:10] see
[1:55:11] and so then the second thing that would
[1:55:13] lead the whole world was worldly
[1:55:15] entertainment now brother branham used
[1:55:17] the term rock and roll
[1:55:19] and when he saw a witch which
[1:55:22] represented the head of the church
[1:55:24] puts the nuts because remember it's a tr
[1:55:26] it's a it's a it's a triunity of
[1:55:29] religious political and demon power
[1:55:33] all right coming together
[1:55:35] and
[1:55:36] though the church is being led by a
[1:55:38] religious witch that goes all the way
[1:55:40] back to the pope
[1:55:42] see
[1:55:43] because the bible says through his
[1:55:44] sorceries
[1:55:46] see and it's witchcraft because
[1:55:48] rebellion against god
[1:55:49] and and brother branham in the 60s could
[1:55:51] only call it rock and roll now we've
[1:55:54] actually because we're still here 50
[1:55:56] plus years later now we've had to
[1:55:58] actually broaden the term not adding to
[1:56:00] brother branham's words but there was a
[1:56:02] lot of things there were you know now
[1:56:04] we've got to say we've got to say rock
[1:56:06] and roll and then you've got to divide
[1:56:08] classic and then you've got to divide
[1:56:10] pop and then you've got to divide rap
[1:56:12] and then you've got to divide country
[1:56:13] and then you've got to divide this and
[1:56:14] that and then you've got to divide
[1:56:16] grunge and then you've got to really
[1:56:18] call it punk and then you've got to i
[1:56:19] mean the the the categories go on and on
[1:56:22] and on and on and now you had hollywood
[1:56:25] just really getting started when brother
[1:56:26] branham talks about that they swap
[1:56:28] around one another committing adultery
[1:56:30] you know uh and and that was just that
[1:56:33] that now you're in the days where you've
[1:56:34] got cary grant and grace kelly and it
[1:56:36] looks it looks innocent now it's it's so
[1:56:39] vulgar even the commercials
[1:56:42] i i hope no one in here is a is a is a a
[1:56:45] routine tv watcher i know you might be
[1:56:47] in a hospital and they got it playing or
[1:56:48] you might be in a my wife went to the
[1:56:50] dentist and they got it playing in front
[1:56:51] of her thankfully it's hg it's showing
[1:56:54] you know cooking shows and rebuilding
[1:56:55] houses and i appreciated the dentist for
[1:56:58] that but i mean let's face it friends
[1:56:59] the world is nasty and vulgar and
[1:57:02] perverted
[1:57:04] and now even the commercials are
[1:57:05] promoting the the homosexual agenda
[1:57:08] promo promoting all uh you know
[1:57:11] cross-racial barriers and and and i'm
[1:57:13] not not complaining against that but why
[1:57:16] are they constantly putting it in our
[1:57:18] face because hollywood
[1:57:20] nashville motown new york where it's at
[1:57:24] paris france london england moscow
[1:57:27] russia
[1:57:28] it doesn't matter the whole world the
[1:57:31] religious world is being led by a
[1:57:33] trinity of devils
[1:57:36] father son and holy ghost under a false
[1:57:38] prophet a beast and a dragon and we find
[1:57:41] that the power of world now i've got to
[1:57:43] expand the term to worldly entertainment
[1:57:48] driven by demons
[1:57:52] now
[1:58:02] for 40 years
[1:58:06] former soviet
[1:58:08] soviet union the
[1:58:11] uh with with all of their soviet union
[1:58:13] satellite states
[1:58:15] for 40 years held people under communism
[1:58:19] where they could not
[1:58:21] you know
[1:58:22] let me just come to the part that's
[1:58:23] really that i noticed personally
[1:58:26] when we first started going into russia
[1:58:29] brother lonnie and i started going
[1:58:30] together and then brother eugene started
[1:58:32] coming along then later brother barry
[1:58:34] started coming along
[1:58:35] and
[1:58:36] and and and now brother barry's still
[1:58:38] going back in there even to this day i
[1:58:39] haven't been in years
[1:58:40] uh probably five years ago i was in
[1:58:42] moscow preaching revivals for brother
[1:58:44] sergey
[1:58:45] and
[1:58:46] that's the meeting where we saw as he
[1:58:49] yet spake these words the holy ghost
[1:58:50] started falling on the people people
[1:58:52] were being healed of diseases i never
[1:58:54] prayed for a person just while i
[1:58:55] preached
[1:58:56] young people being filled with the holy
[1:58:57] ghost on the spot people under
[1:58:59] depression and darkness and beginning
[1:59:01] getting free men coming in off the
[1:59:03] street here just hearing me read a
[1:59:04] scripture fall down and repent
[1:59:07] see just like just like in the just like
[1:59:09] the house of cornelius that the book of
[1:59:10] acts again as peter yet spake these
[1:59:12] words the holy ghost fell
[1:59:15] and so so we but one of the things that
[1:59:18] we find when we went there
[1:59:19] is they were so stoic that you
[1:59:22] you no matter what you said it was
[1:59:24] difficult on us especially me as a
[1:59:25] southern preacher brother lonnie was
[1:59:26] yankee it was a little easier on him but
[1:59:29] it was hard on me as a southern because
[1:59:31] i like i like to hear some amens i like
[1:59:33] to hear some pull
[1:59:34] you know and and you you i mean you
[1:59:36] bring your best material and you'd wow
[1:59:43] and they just sit there
[1:59:45] and we thought what is wrong with these
[1:59:47] people but what we learned to discover
[1:59:49] now they're not like that now
[1:59:51] now they'll jump through the roof and
[1:59:52] land out in the road
[1:59:54] but but then they were 40 years under
[1:59:57] communism and they were taught to not be
[1:59:58] expressive
[2:00:00] it was it was against the law
[2:00:02] they'd take you aside and question you
[2:00:04] if you acted out in public
[2:00:06] see
[2:00:07] and so
[2:00:08] so we we learned that they were just
[2:00:11] locked down and frozen
[2:00:13] so
[2:00:14] so then you can imagine
[2:00:16] what a revival began to break among the
[2:00:18] people
[2:00:19] when when perestroika and glasnost and
[2:00:22] and gorbachev and yeltsin begin they
[2:00:24] tore down the berlin wall and and and
[2:00:27] commune the soviet union collapsed and
[2:00:29] you had cosmonauts who were part of the
[2:00:31] ussr when they went into space and when
[2:00:33] they came home they were ussr didn't
[2:00:35] even exist anymore they're part of the
[2:00:37] russian federation
[2:00:39] and so
[2:00:40] they they held a revival
[2:00:43] in in in moscow right shortly after the
[2:00:47] uh after all of that came down it's 1991
[2:00:50] and they they held a revival and you can
[2:00:53] see when the people who have who have
[2:00:55] been taught there was no god
[2:00:58] there is no god they didn't know the
[2:00:59] first thing about worshiping god and
[2:01:02] finally now the gospel is starting to go
[2:01:04] in and and and
[2:01:06] and things are starting to progress and
[2:01:08] the people are so excited to hear
[2:01:12] uh the things of god
[2:01:14] that
[2:01:15] they assembled in moscow 1991
[2:01:19] almost two million people
[2:01:24] almost 2
[2:01:25] million people
[2:01:28] the excitement was palpable
[2:01:32] they're there i mean you're going to
[2:01:33] even see american and even dixie flags
[2:01:35] wave look at the mass of humanity it's
[2:01:37] as far as you can see
[2:01:39] and one point it starts waving there's a
[2:01:42] russian helicopter going over i mean
[2:01:44] these people are excited to be free
[2:01:47] now they can worship
[2:01:49] like they've never been able to worship
[2:01:51] before
[2:01:52] and even their soldiers there that's a
[2:01:54] profile of a soldier you can see the
[2:01:56] people are so excited and watch them now
[2:01:58] you're even going to see the soldiers
[2:01:59] even finally can't resist anymore and
[2:02:01] and even the soldiers start jumping up
[2:02:03] and down and and worshipping and these
[2:02:06] people are so sincere look at those
[2:02:08] raising their hands and oh lifting up
[2:02:12] glory and praise and their there's your
[2:02:15] soldiers and the only problem was that
[2:02:18] it they weren't worshiping the god that
[2:02:20] you and i would normally worship
[2:02:26] and they'll be led
[2:02:28] by the trinity
[2:02:29] and rock and roll to armageddon
[2:02:34] you think
[2:02:35] you think
[2:02:37] that
[2:02:38] that
[2:02:39] rock and roll won't lead the world
[2:02:42] look at that
[2:02:44] you think rock and roll doesn't have
[2:02:46] that kind of power
[2:02:48] to make people look at this soldier
[2:02:49] right here he's he's lost it now he's
[2:02:51] taking his uniform off i mean this this
[2:02:54] was this was just me this here they are
[2:02:57] and i i titled that screen false
[2:02:59] anointed ones
[2:03:03] 40 years under communism this is what
[2:03:05] broke my heart broke brother's heart
[2:03:07] 40 years under communism
[2:03:10] and
[2:03:11] as soon as those walls collapsed
[2:03:13] trinitarian churches ran in
[2:03:15] took up all the real estate
[2:03:17] started started persecuting the
[2:03:19] believers tried to hold us back from
[2:03:22] witnessing
[2:03:23] questioned us at checkpoints and wanted
[2:03:25] to know come into our meetings i'm told
[2:03:27] in certain meetings i have to keep my
[2:03:28] voice low i go into belarus and and i'm
[2:03:32] preaching in an apartment to probably 20
[2:03:34] people and i'm trying not to get excited
[2:03:37] and every time i get excited the
[2:03:38] pastor's saying
[2:03:39] there's people outside listening and if
[2:03:41] they hear us in a service they'll call
[2:03:43] in so we said well we better go and have
[2:03:46] a secret meeting in the woods and we did
[2:03:48] and we got busted
[2:03:50] and the border guards come rushing in
[2:03:51] what took everybody to jail but god in
[2:03:54] his sovereignty when i got out of the
[2:03:56] out of the van they left to go get some
[2:03:58] old ladies and i left my bible left my
[2:04:00] notebook i left everything and i
[2:04:02] couldn't start preaching until they got
[2:04:03] back with the old women and before they
[2:04:05] got back with them here come the border
[2:04:07] guards and so no preaching was going on
[2:04:09] but i would have been wide open and i'd
[2:04:11] went straight to jail the pastor went to
[2:04:13] jail he told me that he said you'd went
[2:04:15] to jail i'd went to jail and everybody
[2:04:17] here women and children would have went
[2:04:18] to jail
[2:04:21] and they finally when we told them we're
[2:04:23] just here singing some songs and they
[2:04:25] looked at everybody's passports and and
[2:04:28] they left and then i get on a train and
[2:04:30] i've got to cross the russian frontier
[2:04:31] to get back to moscow and suddenly the
[2:04:34] train's not leaving and they're knocking
[2:04:36] they're knocking on our window and the
[2:04:38] brother brother vitali goes and he opens
[2:04:40] the curtain and the pastor's
[2:04:41] you know and vitali leaves and and he
[2:04:43] locks the door he says brother jason
[2:04:45] something's wrong don't talk
[2:04:48] don't speak english leave this door
[2:04:50] locked if somebody knocks don't answer
[2:04:51] it
[2:04:52] and he went and they said the kgb had
[2:04:54] boarded the train because this is
[2:04:56] belarus they're still russian
[2:04:58] they're still uh communist
[2:05:00] and he's and they're looking for someone
[2:05:03] and so they they hit me in this car with
[2:05:05] the door locked wouldn't let me even
[2:05:06] utter a word and we drove across the
[2:05:08] russian frontier through the night i
[2:05:10] made it back into the federation of
[2:05:11] russia i'm going to tell you something
[2:05:13] friends and this is this is now satan in
[2:05:16] control if satan can do that
[2:05:20] if satan can do that to people who never
[2:05:23] did that for 40 years
[2:05:26] then you think the trinity and rock and
[2:05:29] roll worldly entertainment ain't gonna
[2:05:31] somehow lead them to armageddon
[2:05:33] i'm here to tell you something friends
[2:05:35] it not only will it already is
[2:05:40] this is the hour
[2:05:42] that we have arrived at
[2:05:45] the taking back
[2:05:46] of every everything that we lost god is
[2:05:50] redeeming it back to his bride
[2:05:53] you are living in the last closing
[2:05:56] scenes of human history
[2:05:59] and we'd love to have been 50 years deep
[2:06:02] in the end of the millennium but you
[2:06:04] know this word had to be lived
[2:06:07] it had to be lived
[2:06:09] do you know do you know why they wrote a
[2:06:10] book of acts i've said it to you before
[2:06:12] why they write a book of acts because
[2:06:14] people acted
[2:06:16] and i'm here to tell you what what
[2:06:18] vindicated william branham was it his
[2:06:19] theology no
[2:06:21] it was his life of the supernatural and
[2:06:24] his life as an overcomer and maintaining
[2:06:27] victory
[2:06:28] and they could never move him from that
[2:06:31] and his life proved that what the bible
[2:06:34] said would happen when elijah came he
[2:06:37] did it
[2:06:38] i'm here to tell you the the old
[2:06:39] testament prophesied what would happen
[2:06:41] in the in jerusalem in the upper room it
[2:06:44] prophesied what would happen jesus
[2:06:45] prophesied
[2:06:47] that that his life would be lived
[2:06:48] continually through them i'm here to
[2:06:50] tell you we'd have all liked to have
[2:06:51] been gone 50 years in the millennium but
[2:06:54] he wasn't coming back to marry a little
[2:06:56] girl she was barely walking when a
[2:06:58] prophet went home hallelujah she had to
[2:07:01] she had to go through this
