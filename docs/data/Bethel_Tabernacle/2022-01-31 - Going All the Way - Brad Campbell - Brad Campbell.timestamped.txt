[0:05] started on this journey
[0:10] many years ago
[0:12] [Music]
[0:18] i've seen a lot of things
[0:21] [Music]
[0:23] while traveling to and from
[0:29] [Music]
[0:31] well i've been through the storm
[0:34] [Music]
[0:37] i've been through the rain
[0:43] [Music]
[0:45] and sometimes all i try to do
[0:50] it just seems to be in vain
[0:58] but one thing i know for sure
[1:03] i'm gonna get my starry crown
[1:07] [Music]
[1:12] cause i've done come this far
[1:15] [Music]
[1:17] and i just can't turn around
[1:26] with the things i have to do
[1:28] [Music]
[1:31] you may not understand
[1:34] [Music]
[1:40] but my main concern
[1:44] that i'm in the master's plan
[1:52] [Music]
[1:58] [Music]
[2:06] well i could care less
[2:08] [Music]
[2:12] what the world may do or say
[2:16] [Music]
[2:20] cause i've made the lord a promise
[2:23] that if he would lead the way
[2:26] i told him i'd follow
[2:33] and after all that i've been through
[2:37] i'd be a fool to turn it loose and let
[2:40] it all go down
[2:47] cause i've made up in my mind
[2:52] but i'm going all the way
[2:59] listen to these words
[3:01] satan comes around
[3:05] [Music]
[3:07] playing with my mind
[3:09] [Music]
[3:15] but i've got a job to do
[3:20] i can't afford to waste my time
[3:28] where he pretends to be my friend
[3:33] and he pretends to be so
[3:36] kind
[3:38] [Music]
[3:42] forget behind me saturday
[3:46] [Music]
[3:49] my
[3:56] [Music]
[4:01] i'm going all the way
[4:04] singing with me now
[4:06] thank you lord
[4:08] oh i could kill this
[4:11] [Applause]
[4:14] what the world may do or say
[4:22] cause i've made the lord a promise
[4:26] that if he would lead the way
[4:29] i told he might follow
[4:35] and after all that i've been through
[4:39] i'd be a fool to turn it loose and let
[4:42] it all go now
[4:46] [Applause]
[4:49] cause i've made up in my mind
[4:55] i'm going
[4:56] all the way
[5:02] i'm going all the way
[5:09] i'm going
[5:10] all the way
[5:17] [Applause]
