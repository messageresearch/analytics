[26:34] amen so
[26:35] been been a long time so looking forward

[26:41] we'll let you be seated
[26:43] i want to read in the tenth chapter and
[26:46] the ninth verse
[26:47] and i went into the angel and said unto
[26:50] him give me the little book
[26:52] and he said unto me take it and eat it
[26:54] up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[26:57] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[26:59] honey father we thank you for your word
[27:02] we commit ourselves into your hands just
[27:04] now i
[27:06] lord have expended this entire day lord
[27:10] just sitting before you since early
[27:12] hours lord and just
[27:14] making notes here notes there and
[27:15] adjusting as best i could hear your
[27:17] voice so
[27:18] i'm trusting you now to make it
[27:20] something valuable to the people
[27:23] help me now lord to deliver it as i
[27:25] received it i committed to you
[27:27] in jesus name god bless you friends as
[27:28] you're seated
[27:32] amen
[27:35] we'll come back to that verse
[27:36] momentarily i want to pick up 2
[27:38] thessalonians chapter 2
[27:40] and verses 7 through 12.
[27:45] for the mystery of iniquity doth already
[27:48] work
[27:49] only he who now letteth will let until
[27:52] he be taken out of the way
[27:54] and then shall that wicked be revealed
[27:57] whom the lord shall consume with the
[27:59] spirit of his mouth
[28:00] and shall destroy with the brightness of
[28:03] his coming
[28:04] even him whose coming is after the
[28:06] working of satan
[28:07] with all power and signs and lying
[28:09] wonders and with all deceivableness of
[28:12] unrighteousness
[28:13] in them that perish because they
[28:17] received not the love of the truth
[28:19] that they might be saved and for this
[28:22] cause
[28:23] god shall send them strong delusion that
[28:25] they should believe a lie
[28:27] that they all might be damned who
[28:29] believed not the truth
[28:31] but had pleasure and unrighteousness
[28:34] amen brother branham when he
[28:38] takes this verse uh in the 11th verse
[28:42] of 2 thessalonians 2. brother branham
[28:46] shows us how that that they should
[28:49] believe a lie
[28:50] and brother branham said more perfectly
[28:52] from the original
[28:54] text it's the lie it's the original lie
[28:57] he said it's actually the exact same lie
[29:01] that satan told eve in the garden of
[29:04] eden
[29:04] and brought the sad downfall of all
[29:07] humankind
[29:09] so the lie of course and i just want you
[29:13] to jump right in with me because we're
[29:14] going to cover a lot of ground
[29:16] and i'm going to have to go quickly but
[29:18] at the same time i want it to sink in
[29:20] so i got your full attention all right
[29:23] so this
[29:23] lie we're going to call it the lie the
[29:26] lie not a lie
[29:27] it's the lie it's the original lie
[29:30] and this lie takes many forms of sin
[29:33] that's one of the first
[29:35] points that i want to make to you it's
[29:37] not any specific sin
[29:39] it's a it's a misguided principle all
[29:41] right
[29:42] and so uh all of its forms no matter
[29:46] what
[29:46] form the lie comes in that all
[29:49] of its forms are all based
[29:52] on this one single false premise
[29:56] that applies across the board
[29:59] the lie is that reasoning god's word
[30:03] away
[30:03] will not cause you to
[30:07] right die all right that's the lie
[30:11] that reasoning god's word away
[30:14] will not cause you to die that's the lie
[30:18] so the type of transgression is not as
[30:22] relevant as the principle that covers
[30:25] all situations there is
[30:29] uh an atoning blood of christ for our
[30:32] transgressions
[30:33] but we realize that in a born-again
[30:36] believer
[30:37] there is no sin because sin is unbelief
[30:40] and i have already unbelieved the devil
[30:44] and i have believed the lord amen
[30:47] and therefore because that i have
[30:49] received the revealed word
[30:51] it brought a gene a gene of god that was
[30:54] inside of me
[30:56] my acceptance of his word brought that
[30:58] to life
[31:00] and i'm sealed unto the day of my
[31:01] redemption and therefore he that's born
[31:04] of god doth not commit sin for he cannot
[31:06] sin
[31:07] because the seed remains see he cannot
[31:10] sin
[31:11] however john goes on to say but if we do
[31:13] sin in other words if we do transgress
[31:15] we have an advocate with the father so
[31:19] we want to make that
[31:20] clear distinction between the unbelief
[31:23] of sin
[31:24] and and simple transgressions of the
[31:26] flesh
[31:28] but this the lie that that he says
[31:32] to that warns the church by that they
[31:34] for this cause god shall send them
[31:36] strong delusion
[31:38] that they should believe the lie that
[31:41] they all might be damned
[31:43] who believed not the truth now why did
[31:45] they not believe the truth
[31:47] because they agreed to reason weigh the
[31:50] word of god
[31:51] amen and therefore god
[31:54] when they did that then god sends him a
[31:56] strong delusion
[31:58] to where they actually cease being
[32:00] hypocritical in it
[32:02] and actually believe the lie all right
[32:06] and so that they might be damned who
[32:09] believed not the truth but had pleasure
[32:12] and unrighteousness denominations
[32:16] denominationalism
[32:17] and just to speak of one aspect
[32:20] denominations
[32:21] seem like a sensible and reasonable idea
[32:24] brother branham talks about that in the
[32:25] church age book
[32:26] the whole idea of you know gathering
[32:29] what we we believe and let's put it in
[32:31] writing and let's make a document
[32:32] let's get everybody to rally around it
[32:35] you know let's have a hierarchical order
[32:37] uh in the church of ministries and
[32:39] bishops and over that
[32:40] so that way we can keep everything
[32:42] correct and brother branham said
[32:44] it sounded reasonable but it was
[32:47] actually the seed of the roman catholic
[32:49] church
[32:50] so denominations may seem like a
[32:52] sensible
[32:53] and a reasonable idea until you find out
[32:57] by the original word
[32:59] that they are all broken cisterns and
[33:02] that they adopt
[33:03] names of blasphemy in fact they are
[33:06] themselves
[33:07] blasphemius or blasphemous names
[33:10] that lead to the mark of the beast now
[33:12] the b system
[33:13] take another step the b system of
[33:16] organized religion
[33:18] amen a product of the lie
[33:22] amen come on you have to help me the
[33:25] organized religion
[33:26] is a product of the lie amen
[33:30] it's a product of the lie and if
[33:32] followed
[33:33] it will have a person not only
[33:36] failing to recognize the truth of their
[33:39] hour
[33:40] but it will actually cause its followers
[33:42] to
[33:43] end up calling the truth itself a lie
[33:47] that's that's how that's how much power
[33:50] this lie has and people have abandoned
[33:54] what we held traditionally for hundreds
[33:56] of years to be the truth
[33:58] and taught in the word of god to be the
[33:59] truth and suddenly the world declares it
[34:02] all alive
[34:04] my wife was telling me about one of one
[34:06] of her cooking show ladies that
[34:08] you know looking at a certain aspect you
[34:10] know
[34:11] of a lie because something came into her
[34:13] family and one of her
[34:14] family members began practicing a
[34:16] perverted lifestyle
[34:17] and she she looks in the camera supposed
[34:19] to be a christian lady
[34:21] and says you know i heard all my life
[34:23] that that was wrong she said but that's
[34:25] a lie
[34:27] and i was stunned and i thought there is
[34:29] no end to the insanity of this world
[34:32] and that's why god god doesn't say i'm
[34:35] going to destroy them
[34:36] because i don't like them he said i'm
[34:39] going to destroy those who loved not the
[34:41] truth
[34:42] but who loved unrighteousness rather
[34:44] than the truth
[34:45] see so the lie then so so then
[34:49] you know i i i even even as i start out
[34:52] here
[34:53] i want to make a statement for clarity i
[34:55] think it's important
[34:57] uh a clarity of my purpose
[35:00] in this three-part series i have
[35:03] i i want to say that i have the same
[35:06] determination that
[35:07] paul uh had you know
[35:10] lest i suffer the same disappointment
[35:12] that he was trying to avoid
[35:15] here's the hope that he has here's what
[35:17] i have here's part of my purpose
[35:19] in this three-part series paul says to
[35:22] the church
[35:22] holding forth since philippians 2
[35:25] holding forth the word of life
[35:27] that i may rejoice in the day of christ
[35:30] that i have not run in vain
[35:31] neither labored in vain so why brother
[35:35] jason have you taken
[35:36] now you're taking a third service to
[35:39] tell us something
[35:40] that as message believers we pretty much
[35:42] already know
[35:44] but what i want you to understand
[35:46] friends is that
[35:47] satan is always busy and he's always
[35:50] battling our mind
[35:52] and he's always trying to put you on a
[35:54] slippery slope that doesn't
[35:55] seem like you're disbelieving the word
[35:57] or reasoning it at first
[35:59] but after a while of slipping
[36:02] suddenly your lifestyle goes way away
[36:05] from where you used to be
[36:08] you understand and so we realize that
[36:10] this
[36:11] lie this misunderstanding of
[36:14] scripture is so destructive
[36:18] it is so costly to human souls
[36:21] that it will actually take the
[36:23] overwhelming majority of humanity
[36:26] into a tribulation period for three and
[36:28] a half years
[36:32] a time the bible describes as having no
[36:34] parallel
[36:35] or equal in the 6 000 year history of
[36:39] the world
[36:41] life is short amen
[36:45] life is short i if you're any age at all
[36:49] you know that some of you young people
[36:50] don't look at it that way but trust me
[36:52] our time on earth is very brief
[36:55] and we only have one chance in life
[36:59] to make a difference somehow and in our
[37:02] life it is so so the question comes so
[37:05] now i'm back to paul's burden
[37:07] i want to be able to rejoice i don't
[37:10] want to come up at the finish line
[37:12] and have have half of you or a third of
[37:15] you
[37:16] or a tenth of you or any of you
[37:19] you know floundering believing the lie
[37:23] and end up missing a rapture i i want to
[37:26] i want to be able to rejoice
[37:28] that i've been able to sow the glory of
[37:30] god in your lives
[37:32] and so we we realized that that
[37:36] it begs the question that is our life
[37:38] think about our life for a moment
[37:40] is our life declaring the word of god
[37:44] our lifestyle the conversation of our
[37:47] flesh
[37:48] amen is our lifestyle i think this is uh
[37:52] this is a question every believer should
[37:54] ask every morning when they're setting
[37:56] up their
[37:56] purpose for the day i hope you i hope
[37:59] you meet every day doing several things
[38:01] number one
[38:02] i hope you wake up talking to the lord
[38:04] number two i hope you'll avail
[38:05] yourselves of his mercies which are new
[38:07] every morning
[38:08] number three i hope you're purposing and
[38:10] pledging to him lord i want to serve you
[38:12] today
[38:13] i i don't even know i'll have tomorrow
[38:15] and yesterday's gone but i do have today
[38:19] that's the power of today as brother
[38:20] matt preached for us some time ago
[38:23] there's a wonderful wonderful reality
[38:26] when you think about the power of today
[38:30] all right so now so now when i when i
[38:33] look at this
[38:34] i think about our lives and how
[38:38] what kind of an example are we living
[38:41] to the world it is our life declaring
[38:45] the word of
[38:46] god in such a way that someone observing
[38:49] us might find their way to eternal life
[38:52] that's an important one see that's an
[38:55] important question
[38:57] is our light our daily light of our
[39:00] lives
[39:01] shining brightly enough brightly enough
[39:04] at the least
[39:06] at the least to keep them from believing
[39:08] the lie
[39:09] and being damned by it amen amen
[39:13] because there's going to be people that
[39:16] don't go in a rapture
[39:17] but also don't take the mark of the
[39:19] beast and they're going to go through
[39:21] the tribulation and somehow someway
[39:23] they're going to have a some from
[39:25] somewhere that they knew
[39:26] enough to not take and believe the lie i
[39:29] would like to think they
[39:31] saw me and they talked to me and maybe
[39:33] they weren't ordained for the message
[39:34] but yet
[39:35] i was able to live in such a way before
[39:40] them
[39:42] so we want to keep them from believing
[39:46] the lie
[39:47] and being being damned by it
[39:50] uh my presentation so i want to
[39:54] run quickly over these two quotes from
[39:56] arthur pink that we finished with last
[39:57] time i think they're so poignant that
[39:59] they bear uh re-reading again
[40:03] so pink says he says now this is uh
[40:06] israel crossing the jordan into the
[40:08] canaan's land all right
[40:10] we realize it's the holy ghost not the
[40:12] millennium right
[40:13] jordan meant death so you have to go
[40:15] through death and then into the holy
[40:17] ghost
[40:18] amen all right on the one hand if we
[40:20] confine our viewpoint solely
[40:22] unto the sovereign grace of god in
[40:24] connection with our salvation
[40:26] and deliberately close our eyes to all
[40:28] that scripture teaches
[40:30] upon the discharge of our responsibility
[40:32] that's what almost the entire christian
[40:34] world does
[40:36] see they always just they always just
[40:38] want to holler grace it's just all grace
[40:40] it's
[40:40] you know it doesn't matter how i live or
[40:42] how i look or how i do it matters
[40:43] oh it matters matters to you matters to
[40:46] your victory it matters to your joy
[40:48] and it just might matter to the eternal
[40:51] destination
[40:52] of people who won't make the rapture but
[40:55] might
[40:56] miss taking the mark of the beast
[40:59] see because there will be people who do
[41:01] that they're the unwise virgin they're
[41:03] righteous people so he says
[41:07] he says to all that scripture teaches
[41:10] upon the discharge of our responsibility
[41:12] in relation there to
[41:13] then it would be indeed be strange if we
[41:15] understood how
[41:16] that on the one hand canaan was a free
[41:18] gift unto israel just like
[41:20] the new birth salvation is free which
[41:22] they entered by grace alone
[41:25] by grace alone are you saved through
[41:28] faith amen
[41:29] all right and on the other hand that
[41:31] they had to fight for every inch of it
[41:34] that seems like a conundrum why why does
[41:36] it why do these two
[41:38] why does the type so not answer the
[41:40] anatype
[41:42] because it looked like it was all grace
[41:44] alone but then when they got in there
[41:45] they had to
[41:46] actually have some things to overcome
[41:48] they had to surmount have some victories
[41:50] in their life
[41:51] so it mattered how they lived and how
[41:52] they fought
[41:54] all right so he goes on but when we
[41:57] realize that eternal life is both the
[41:59] gift of god as in romans 6 and a crown
[42:02] which
[42:02] has to be won by faithfulness as in
[42:04] revelation 2
[42:06] that the christian inheritance is not
[42:07] only purchased by the blood of the lamb
[42:09] but is also the reward of those who
[42:11] serve the lord christ
[42:12] as in colossians 3 then we should have
[42:14] no trouble
[42:15] in perceiving how the type answers to
[42:18] the antitype amen
[42:22] so the need i'll advance on in a minute
[42:24] so the need
[42:25] for the holy ghost i don't know if one
[42:29] of these will darken the screen i'm not
[42:31] gonna
[42:31] the bottom one or the top one
[42:35] oh that worked okay i better still be
[42:37] there when i go back
[42:40] so the need for the holy ghost after
[42:43] believing
[42:45] should make perfect sense to you amen
[42:48] brother branham
[42:49] went back to paul have you received the
[42:51] holy ghost since you believe
[42:53] and those who received the promised
[42:55] having believed they were baptized in
[42:56] the holy ghost
[42:58] the bible is replete with evidence of
[43:00] this and brother branham
[43:01] taught it constantly and would you
[43:03] imagine that it was one of the
[43:05] the main things that that the
[43:08] fundamentalist and evangelicals
[43:10] and denominations held against him
[43:13] is that he preached you had to have the
[43:15] baptism of the holy ghost
[43:17] they said oh you're just you just hang
[43:18] out too much within pentecostals
[43:20] and brother branham would show him in
[43:22] nature he would show him in scripture
[43:24] he had his own life to testify he could
[43:26] perform the signs
[43:28] of of of that are the gifts in the bible
[43:30] he could perform the german
[43:32] he could do all of that thing and amaze
[43:34] them to where they couldn't say a word
[43:36] against that
[43:37] but they still resisted this whole idea
[43:41] that i've got to have that that if i say
[43:43] i have the literal life of christ living
[43:46] inside me
[43:46] that actually means something that's not
[43:48] a cliche
[43:50] that actually it carries weight behind
[43:52] it that brings the christian
[43:54] that makes the church mark 16 which is
[43:57] the church
[43:58] in action if it's not in action it's a
[44:01] worthless gathering of people
[44:04] you'd be better to to to join a country
[44:06] club
[44:07] all right you'd have more fun than
[44:09] coming in here and and be beat up by a
[44:11] preacher
[44:12] uh talking talking down to you how you
[44:14] should live better
[44:16] because if you're not born again that's
[44:18] what this sounds like
[44:20] all right so so the need for the holy
[44:24] ghost after believing
[44:25] should make perfect sense because there
[44:27] is no way
[44:28] for a fallen man to accomplish what pink
[44:31] is talking about
[44:32] there's no way for a fallen man to
[44:34] accomplish that not at least
[44:36] not acceptably for redemption i get that
[44:39] people live holy lives and there's value
[44:42] in that
[44:42] amen the king refers to the unwise
[44:45] virgin that's righteous people amen
[44:48] but we're not talking about i'm not
[44:49] talking about being
[44:51] safe from destruction and being granted
[44:53] eternal life on the backside of the
[44:55] millennium
[44:55] because i got a fair trial at the
[44:57] judgment bar i'm talking about being
[44:59] redeemed
[45:00] and not having to go to the judgment and
[45:02] becoming a part of christ
[45:04] there's no way to accomplish that for a
[45:07] fallen man it's impossible
[45:09] it takes the holy ghost inside of you
[45:13] because god can only accept the unwise
[45:16] virgins of matthew 25 notwithstanding
[45:18] god can only accept himself as the
[45:22] provided sacrifice for redemption
[45:24] abraham knew exactly this
[45:26] the lord shall provide himself a
[45:28] sacrifice the lord shall provide himself
[45:30] as a sacrifice
[45:32] his life living in a man and that alone
[45:36] redeems a man good works
[45:39] however good or however numerous
[45:43] cannot pay the price of redemption
[45:46] it's too expensive there's not enough
[45:50] value
[45:51] someone say it again good works however
[45:54] good
[45:56] however numerous cannot pay the price
[46:00] for redemption i want you to think about
[46:04] our opening text that we read
[46:05] and i don't need to put it back up it
[46:07] was just one simple verse in revelation
[46:09] 10 9. and i went to the angel and said
[46:12] unto him
[46:13] give me this little book and then now
[46:15] the angel is going to respond
[46:17] and i want you to notice that the angel
[46:20] is all business here you're going to
[46:23] notice
[46:24] the that there is a complete absence of
[46:27] pleasantries
[46:29] in this conversation a complete absence
[46:32] of pleasantries
[46:34] in this conversation there's no hey how
[46:36] you doing you know i better make sure i
[46:37] say this politically correct
[46:39] you know he goes to the angel and he
[46:41] said unto me
[46:42] take it and eat it up amen not how you
[46:45] doing would you like to have this is
[46:46] pretty good i think it's a good idea
[46:49] he said i went and asked for the little
[46:50] book because john john representing the
[46:52] bride he wanted to live he wanted
[46:54] eternal life
[46:55] he wanted he wanted redemptions claim
[46:58] and he was told
[46:59] go and ask for the little book and he
[47:01] said i went and asked and said give me
[47:03] the little book
[47:04] and he he didn't say to me how are you
[47:06] how are you doing you're having a nice
[47:07] day i don't want to hurt your feelings
[47:09] he said take it and eat it up and
[47:12] in thy belly it shall make thy belly
[47:15] bitter in case you're wondering
[47:16] this ain't going to be good now it's
[47:18] going to be sweet as honey in your mouth
[47:20] but when it gets down into your belly
[47:22] where you got to actually live it and
[47:24] produce it
[47:26] it's going to set up a spiritual war in
[47:28] fact is
[47:29] such a great one it's going to be called
[47:31] the greatest battle ever fought
[47:33] amen see
[47:36] so the angel is all all
[47:39] business when we look at revelation
[47:43] chapter 10 and we move on i want to come
[47:45] back to revelation 2.
[47:47] notwithstanding i have a few things
[47:49] against thee because thou
[47:50] sufferest you tolerate that woman
[47:52] jezebel which calleth herself a
[47:54] prophetess
[47:55] to teach and to seduce my servants to
[47:58] commit fornication
[48:00] and to eat things sacrificed to idols
[48:03] and i gave her space to repent of her
[48:05] fornication
[48:07] and she repented not
[48:10] behold i will cast her into a bed
[48:13] and them that commit adultery with her
[48:16] into great tribulation
[48:18] except they repent of their deeds and i
[48:20] will kill her children with death this
[48:23] is pretty heavy language
[48:25] this is so politically incorrect to say
[48:28] today
[48:30] i mean you know the one of the first
[48:32] pieces one of the first persons
[48:34] that that they would try to x out would
[48:36] be god
[48:38] if jesus came and said this to the world
[48:40] he's one of the first ones cancel
[48:41] culture would attack
[48:43] all the big sponsors would take away
[48:45] their take away their sponsorship
[48:47] and he'd have nobody but believers
[48:48] following him
[48:51] and i will kill her children with death
[48:53] and all the churches shall know that i
[48:55] am he which searcheth the reigns and
[48:57] hearts now that's an important statement
[48:58] brother iran's going to key on that a
[49:00] minute
[49:00] and and i will kill our children with
[49:03] death and when i do that
[49:05] when when when my family sees that
[49:08] then all the churches shall know that i
[49:11] am he which searcheth the reigns and
[49:13] hearts now
[49:14] god's children already know that brother
[49:15] brahm's going to point that out
[49:17] see then all the churches shall know
[49:20] that i
[49:20] am he which searcheth the reigns and
[49:22] hearts and i will give unto every one of
[49:24] you
[49:24] according to your works so brother
[49:26] brennan picks this up in the thyatiran
[49:28] age he says now with this verse i want
[49:31] you to drop down to 23 which
[49:33] as you can see right there i'll kill our
[49:34] children with death and all the churches
[49:36] shall know that i'm he would searcheth
[49:37] the reigns and hearts and i'll give unto
[49:39] every one of you according to your works
[49:40] i want you to drop down to verse 23 and
[49:43] see the proof of a great truth i have
[49:45] been bringing to your attention all
[49:46] along
[49:47] and i will kill her children with death
[49:49] and all the churches shall know that i
[49:51] am he which searcheth the reigns now
[49:53] young people
[49:54] listen clothes all you teenagers i am
[49:57] determined
[49:59] that i'm going to take a generation to
[50:01] into the rapture
[50:03] who aren't believing the lie that the
[50:06] world is telling
[50:07] that we're all the same and it doesn't
[50:10] matter
[50:11] and you're overblowing it and we're all
[50:13] just christians
[50:15] no not according to saint paul that's
[50:17] part of the lie
[50:20] amen now listen i want because i don't
[50:23] want to see another generation grow up
[50:26] and i still got to preach this
[50:27] fundamental truth that i've been
[50:29] preaching for 26 years
[50:31] and yet i still see people i don't see
[50:33] people coming
[50:34] sitting in my office saying i'm not sure
[50:36] i believe brother branham
[50:38] but what i do see is people who claim to
[50:41] believe brother branham but their
[50:42] lifestyle doesn't look like they believe
[50:44] brother branham
[50:46] amen amen the testimony i'm not worried
[50:48] about the testimony of their lips i'm
[50:50] worried about the testimony of their
[50:52] lives
[50:54] all right all right so oh
[50:58] matt you're okay here we go all right so
[51:02] and i will kill her children with death
[51:04] and all the churches shall know that i
[51:06] am he which searcheth the reigns and
[51:08] hearts
[51:08] i have been saying right along that
[51:11] there are actually two churches now he's
[51:13] going to prove it
[51:14] though the spirit speaks to both of them
[51:17] in each
[51:17] age as though they were but one
[51:21] all right in that verse he's proving
[51:22] this right
[51:24] there's two churches here it is plainly
[51:27] stated
[51:28] that there are churches see and it
[51:31] states just as
[51:32] plainly that some of those churches most
[51:35] evidently do not know
[51:37] that he is the one who searcheth the
[51:39] reigns and the hearts
[51:40] all right he is going to prove to them
[51:44] that is so now then what churches will
[51:47] be those that do not know this truth
[51:49] of course it is the false vine group
[51:52] because because because
[51:54] the true believers certainly know that
[51:56] judgment begins at the house of god
[51:59] the true believers certainly know that
[52:00] they're be they that they being
[52:02] god-fearing judging themselves that they
[52:05] be not judged real christians know the
[52:07] bible teaches that
[52:09] so if he's going to prove to the
[52:11] churches that this is true
[52:13] he's certainly not talking about the
[52:14] true church she already believes that
[52:18] so don't let anyone tell you it doesn't
[52:21] matter all the churches are the same
[52:23] they're not there's only one true
[52:27] church there's only one true vine and
[52:30] the other vine is a
[52:32] like a church but it's a false church
[52:35] all right let's move on
[52:38] now why does god call these churches his
[52:41] churches
[52:42] even though they are the false vine
[52:44] that's a fair question isn't it
[52:46] the truth of the matter is they are
[52:48] christians
[52:50] but now watch but they are not
[52:53] christians of the spirit
[52:55] they are christians of the flesh now
[52:57] he's going to give you an example
[52:58] they are bearing the name in vain that's
[53:00] according to mark 7
[53:01] 7 go read it see how be it in vain do
[53:05] they worship me
[53:06] teaching for doctrine the commandments
[53:08] of men these are talking about people
[53:09] who do this
[53:10] see but indeed they are christians for
[53:14] what else could they be a mohammedanism
[53:17] that is his religion no matter how he
[53:19] lives how many lives it because he
[53:22] subscribes
[53:23] in theory to what the koran teaches so
[53:26] he's a he's a muslim because
[53:29] he
[53:29] believes the koran that doesn't mean he
[53:31] lives it
[53:32] see so because people subscribe to the
[53:35] bible and subscribe to jesus the
[53:37] historical figure
[53:39] they naturally and rightly so call
[53:41] themselves christians
[53:43] say are you saying they're not
[53:44] christians no i'm saying they are
[53:46] but they're not spirit-born christians
[53:49] they're christians of the flesh that
[53:52] that doesn't go in a rapture
[53:54] amen that may not even escape the
[53:57] damnation that
[53:58] is the be system of the antichrist of
[54:00] taking the mark of the beast
[54:03] all right he goes on
[54:06] in the same way a christian is a
[54:08] christian as long as he subscribes to
[54:09] the fact that jesus is the son of god
[54:11] born a virgin was crucified and died and
[54:13] rose again
[54:13] that he is the savior of mankind etc in
[54:16] fact
[54:17] in the laodicean age there will be those
[54:19] who call themselves christians because
[54:21] they subscribe
[54:22] to the fine qualities of jesus
[54:25] while reserving to themselves the right
[54:28] to deny his deity
[54:30] christian science have done that already
[54:32] as well as multitudes who preach a
[54:34] social gospel
[54:36] amen you see where this is going all
[54:39] right
[54:41] he is a nominal christian and belongs to
[54:44] the church
[54:45] but he is not a true or spiritual
[54:49] believer that kind of a believer is one
[54:52] who has been baptized
[54:54] into the body of christ and is a member
[54:57] of him that baptism is a holy ghost
[54:59] baptism
[55:00] but nonetheless it is in god's order
[55:03] that the tares grow up with the wheat
[55:06] and they are not to be uprooted
[55:08] that is the command of god their day for
[55:10] binding and burning
[55:12] is coming but not yet
[55:17] so the spirit is speaking to this mixed
[55:21] group
[55:22] on the one hand he is praising and on
[55:25] the other
[55:25] he's rebuking now he's not bipolar
[55:29] amen he's not double-minded
[55:33] amen he's talking to two different
[55:35] groups
[55:36] he's praising one and rebuking one now
[55:39] watch
[55:40] hold on i'm going to make a big point
[55:42] that i only really
[55:43] struck me today as i was studying this
[55:45] closely as many times i've read over it
[55:48] he has he has now look on the one hand
[55:51] he is praising
[55:52] and on the other hand he is rebuking he
[55:55] has
[55:56] told what is right with the true
[55:58] believer
[56:00] now he warns what the false vine
[56:03] must do if it is to stand justified
[56:07] before the lord
[56:09] now we're not talking about making a
[56:11] rapture we're talking about gaining
[56:13] life at the judgment bar and he has
[56:16] warned them
[56:17] what they must do if they are going to
[56:19] be one of those
[56:20] unwise virgins who are granted eternal
[56:23] life
[56:23] so now how important is it for you and i
[56:27] to take up the word and be a real true
[56:30] accurate living reality of the word of
[56:34] god
[56:36] because brother branham is showing just
[56:39] because they miss the rapture
[56:40] that doesn't necessarily mean that
[56:43] everybody
[56:44] who misses it is doomed everybody who
[56:47] misses it is doomed to go through three
[56:48] and a half years
[56:49] and sleep for a thousand but there are
[56:52] going to be people
[56:53] on the backside oh i don't know they had
[56:56] they saw just enough they heard just
[56:57] enough they knew just enough somehow
[56:59] they they they had their name on the
[57:01] book of life and they found out happily
[57:04] that it had not been removed
[57:06] how many wants to help them how wouldn't
[57:09] you like to know
[57:10] that they're coming in because and they
[57:11] and as they pass by the throne
[57:13] and they see you seated with christ they
[57:15] say look that's the one who we saw
[57:17] and that's the one who talked to us on
[57:19] the street corner that day happy day
[57:21] happy day i'm glad we believed him
[57:26] you see why outreach is so important
[57:30] you see why reaching out is so important
[57:35] see so so we come to that scripture we
[57:39] keep
[57:40] we keep repeating constantly
[57:43] for as the body without the spirit is
[57:46] dead
[57:47] so faith without works is dead also
[57:52] so this is why i made some statements to
[57:55] you
[57:56] that were pretty stiff statements and
[57:58] i'm going to repeat one or two of them
[58:00] here's one that i made being a christian
[58:04] in name only is a worthless hypocrisy
[58:08] yes amen further
[58:11] moreover beyond that it is a detriment
[58:15] to the world
[58:17] a detriment means it's a damage it's an
[58:20] injury
[58:23] it's an impairment you're actually
[58:26] because of your
[58:28] lackadaisical lifestyle that's not very
[58:31] spiritual
[58:32] then they look at you and go if they're
[58:34] doing it it must be okay
[58:37] you know what'll happen you'll get by
[58:39] with it
[58:41] because you're a child of god they won't
[58:45] amen amen god will take a belt to you
[58:50] he'll wear you out but he's not going to
[58:53] lose you
[58:55] but they don't enjoy that seed gene
[58:57] privilege
[58:59] they watch your life and you're going to
[59:00] end up dooming them people you claim to
[59:02] love
[59:04] and are trying to help and you don't
[59:06] live a sincere life before them you live
[59:08] a life of carnality
[59:10] and what will get you a whip and will
[59:12] get them a lake of fire
[59:16] see needlessly amen needlessly
[59:20] see so it's a worthless hypocrisy it
[59:24] only leads in fact is
[59:26] why why why is it a detriment why is it
[59:28] an injury why
[59:29] why is it an impairment because it leads
[59:32] to the further blinding of fallen man
[59:35] from the realities of the living god
[59:38] he already has a hard time seeing it and
[59:40] believing it because he hears so much
[59:41] misinterpreted theology
[59:43] that it's not real and if he don't even
[59:46] see it in you and me what's him what's a
[59:48] poor sinner to do
[59:50] see so it only leads to a further
[59:53] blinding of this
[59:54] age god's entire plan from the very
[59:57] start was always to provide a way back
[59:59] to fellowship
[1:00:01] between god and man that got lost in the
[1:00:03] garden of eden
[1:00:05] god was desiring to make a way
[1:00:08] for the kingdom of god to be restored in
[1:00:11] the world
[1:00:12] so if christ is not allowed here's
[1:00:14] another one
[1:00:16] if christ is not allowed to live
[1:00:20] in and through you
[1:00:23] amen amen if he's not allowed
[1:00:27] say well he's god i'm just a little worm
[1:00:29] i can't stop oh yes you can
[1:00:30] because he's god but he's a gentleman
[1:00:33] and that's why paul said you have to
[1:00:35] allow the mind which was in christ
[1:00:37] you have to allow you have to allow your
[1:00:40] life to be fervent allow the holy spirit
[1:00:43] allow that that gift to abound in you
[1:00:46] see you have to permit that and so if
[1:00:49] christ
[1:00:49] is not allowed to live his life in and
[1:00:52] through you
[1:00:53] if he's not lifted up high
[1:00:57] amen jesus said if i be lifted up
[1:01:00] i'll draw all men to me if he's not
[1:01:03] lifted up high
[1:01:05] then your faith in christ is worth very
[1:01:08] little now
[1:01:09] and very little ultimately amen amen
[1:01:13] see brother branham says in the message
[1:01:16] look we must focus our lives right i'm
[1:01:21] doing good
[1:01:21] making tracks we must focus our lives
[1:01:25] not what somebody else says but focus
[1:01:28] our lives to him
[1:01:30] and he is the word see if we get our
[1:01:33] lives
[1:01:34] lined with the word this is you talking
[1:01:36] about top secret intel
[1:01:38] this is nuclear this is atomic secrets
[1:01:42] of the kingdom
[1:01:43] devil don't want this known so bad watch
[1:01:46] if we get our lives lined with the word
[1:01:50] then the word in our life becomes the
[1:01:52] same
[1:01:54] he said if you abide in me in my word
[1:01:56] and you ask what you will it will be
[1:01:57] granted to you
[1:01:58] verily i say unto you if you say to this
[1:02:00] mountain be removed and don't doubt in
[1:02:01] your heart
[1:02:02] but believe that what you have said will
[1:02:04] come to pass you can have what you
[1:02:06] have said i mean i don't need to go out
[1:02:08] here and move terra firma
[1:02:10] but i do have mountains in my life that
[1:02:12] i need to be able to speak to
[1:02:14] amen i'm not looking to relocate
[1:02:17] rushmore i'm not looking to relocate
[1:02:18] mountain bakery i don't need
[1:02:20] to move the appalachian mountains 50
[1:02:21] miles closer to me
[1:02:23] all right we might do that in the
[1:02:25] millennium i'm not going to do that here
[1:02:27] i don't need to do that here
[1:02:29] but i do have mountains in my life that
[1:02:32] i need to be able to look at the promise
[1:02:34] of the word of god and believe it and
[1:02:35] claim it
[1:02:36] and see supernatural power launch out to
[1:02:39] make it happen
[1:02:41] see he goes on now
[1:02:44] what i said not what i said
[1:02:47] what you said you can have because
[1:02:50] you and he become the same
[1:02:54] because the mind watch this ending now
[1:02:57] because the mind
[1:02:58] i love this wow because the mind
[1:03:02] that was in christ is in you and the
[1:03:05] mind that was in christ
[1:03:07] was to fulfill the father's word so if
[1:03:09] it's in you what are you going to do
[1:03:12] fulfill the father's word which he was
[1:03:14] the word
[1:03:15] there you are then you and the word
[1:03:19] are focused in together you become
[1:03:23] a living unit of god amen
[1:03:27] that is what the devil does not want
[1:03:31] you to know and of all places it's in
[1:03:34] the it's in a message i gotta look at
[1:03:36] that i said
[1:03:37] my goodness how perfect is the holy
[1:03:39] spirit of all places to make that
[1:03:42] statement
[1:03:42] he he has a prophet called the the title
[1:03:46] one word look
[1:03:49] look at my image world look at my people
[1:03:52] look at my family hey
[1:03:53] hey blind world hey laodicea you think
[1:03:56] you understand you understand nothing
[1:03:58] look i got a bride in the earth
[1:04:00] she's like me she's become one she's a
[1:04:03] she's a
[1:04:04] she's a unit of god look
[1:04:08] amen you don't want the lord to be
[1:04:11] embarrassed to
[1:04:13] say look look at those saints in bethel
[1:04:17] tabernacle
[1:04:19] you don't want him to be embarrassed to
[1:04:20] say that wouldn't you like to have the
[1:04:22] lord
[1:04:23] have a testimony of you like he had of
[1:04:25] his great servants down through time
[1:04:28] he says to job have you considered my
[1:04:30] servant jobs nobody like him is a
[1:04:31] perfect man in all his ways
[1:04:33] i'm here to tell you something friends i
[1:04:34] want the lord to look upon me and be
[1:04:36] proud
[1:04:38] i want the lord to have confidence in me
[1:04:40] he said i know i got a son down there
[1:04:42] and i
[1:04:42] my enemy is busy but it doesn't matter i
[1:04:45] got some sons and daughters in beaufort
[1:04:47] south carolina that'll keep him pushed
[1:04:49] back
[1:04:51] hallelujah so this is why
[1:04:54] uh in hebrews 12 28-29 in
[1:04:57] eugene peterson's uh message translation
[1:05:00] he says it like this
[1:05:02] do you see what we've got
[1:05:06] an unshakable kingdom and do you
[1:05:09] see how thankful we must be not only
[1:05:12] thankful
[1:05:12] but brimming with worship deeply
[1:05:15] reverent before god for god
[1:05:17] is not an indifferent bystander
[1:05:20] he's actively cleaning house torching
[1:05:23] all that needs to burn and he won't quit
[1:05:25] until it's all cleansed god himself is a
[1:05:27] fire that's in the king james
[1:05:29] my god is a consuming fire i just say
[1:05:31] lord burn out of me whatever is
[1:05:33] necessary
[1:05:33] don't be a bystander lord be involved in
[1:05:36] my life and
[1:05:37] cleanse me daily and i'm here to tell
[1:05:40] you he's doing it
[1:05:41] he will keep doing it and you better get
[1:05:43] in line quick
[1:05:44] because he's going to keep torching
[1:05:46] whatever needs torched
[1:05:49] and believe me you want him to
[1:05:52] so my greater purpose in this series
[1:05:57] in this multi-part series firstly
[1:06:01] has been to express the great lie
[1:06:05] that is being told in this last day
[1:06:10] according to prophecy amen that the pro
[1:06:13] that was in 2nd thessalonians that's a
[1:06:14] prophecy of the end time
[1:06:16] that we read that i'll send them strong
[1:06:19] delusion they'll believe a lie
[1:06:21] and be damned by it that's an end-time
[1:06:24] prophecy
[1:06:25] see and so we first need to expose the
[1:06:29] lie
[1:06:30] we showed you how the two messengers to
[1:06:32] sodom
[1:06:33] propagated it throughout the world all
[1:06:35] you need to do is make a decision all
[1:06:37] you need to do is be a christian of the
[1:06:38] flesh
[1:06:40] and you don't really need to be a
[1:06:41] christian of the spirit you and actually
[1:06:44] they're not christians of the spirit but
[1:06:46] they even actually claim they're
[1:06:47] christians of the spirit
[1:06:48] but but brother branham would simply
[1:06:51] come back with common
[1:06:52] old hillbilly sins and say
[1:06:56] look it if i had the spirit of houdini
[1:06:58] in me
[1:06:59] i'd be an escape artist and do magic
[1:07:01] tricks
[1:07:03] if i said i got the spirit of john
[1:07:04] dillinger in me i'd carry guns and rob
[1:07:06] banks and i'd be a desperate on a bad
[1:07:08] guy
[1:07:09] he said so if i say i've got the spirit
[1:07:12] of christ in me
[1:07:13] what am i going to do i'm going to be
[1:07:15] like jesus
[1:07:17] see so first thing is to expose the lie
[1:07:21] that is being told
[1:07:23] in this last day the lie that is leading
[1:07:26] to the damnation
[1:07:28] of many unsuspecting people today
[1:07:33] you might fairly imagine this would be
[1:07:35] my primary aim but actually it's not not
[1:07:37] that
[1:07:38] not that as a doctrine that it's not
[1:07:41] vital to redemption
[1:07:42] given especially given the language of
[1:07:44] the verse itself there in second
[1:07:46] thessalonians
[1:07:47] it's vital to redemption what we're
[1:07:49] talking about today the baptism of the
[1:07:51] holy ghost is vital
[1:07:53] that doctrine you need to understand
[1:07:54] that that lie
[1:07:56] that that you don't that you don't
[1:07:58] really have to let christ be
[1:08:00] you know change your life that lie be
[1:08:03] lie you can reason away god's word it
[1:08:06] doesn't really matter
[1:08:08] you know the prophet said that 50 years
[1:08:10] ago this is 2021 come on it doesn't
[1:08:13] really matter
[1:08:14] that's part of the lie
[1:08:17] amen that's insane to think that a
[1:08:20] prophet who was tapped into the eternal
[1:08:21] mind of god couldn't give us a word for
[1:08:23] 2021.
[1:08:24] come on amen i don't know
[1:08:27] that's that's man i did fall off the
[1:08:30] potato truck but i didn't do it
[1:08:32] yesterday
[1:08:34] so so we find that that you know
[1:08:38] you might would think that that's my
[1:08:40] primary aim because it actually is a
[1:08:42] modern 2021 event
[1:08:44] made clear in 2000 year old prophecy all
[1:08:46] right
[1:08:47] but i actually have a further purpose
[1:08:51] uh you know even even more
[1:08:54] representative i guess i would say of my
[1:08:57] main burden
[1:08:59] and that is that we do not declare the
[1:09:01] lie
[1:09:03] in our lives by living a life
[1:09:06] before the unknowing world that
[1:09:09] misrepresents
[1:09:11] true holy ghost-filled christianity
[1:09:14] amen that is my main
[1:09:19] burden i've taken three services and i
[1:09:23] and i've went back and forth between
[1:09:25] it's been a two-pronged attack
[1:09:26] i've been exposing the life for three
[1:09:28] services back to back to back
[1:09:31] because i'm determined to nail it till
[1:09:33] it clenches
[1:09:35] that this question is never in the mind
[1:09:37] because that's constantly
[1:09:39] satan is constantly busy trying to bomb
[1:09:42] you and
[1:09:42] bend you and pound you into that kind of
[1:09:44] an understanding
[1:09:46] to get you to lower your guard and think
[1:09:48] that it doesn't matter
[1:09:49] i want to tell you something friends it
[1:09:50] matters more today than it's ever ever
[1:09:52] mattered
[1:09:53] where are the to where though those upon
[1:09:55] whom the ends of the world have come
[1:09:57] and so i have taken three services to
[1:09:59] not only pound what the lie
[1:10:01] is and what the blindness
[1:10:04] i only started calling it the lie
[1:10:06] tonight i've been calling it the
[1:10:07] blindness of the age
[1:10:09] that those messengers sowed in the world
[1:10:13] but where but also as i've been coming
[1:10:15] along
[1:10:16] not just tonight in the uh first two
[1:10:18] parts
[1:10:19] i've also been trying to get us to
[1:10:21] understand that
[1:10:22] that our lives that living we don't want
[1:10:25] to
[1:10:25] live in such a way to an unknowing world
[1:10:28] that we misrepresent
[1:10:30] a holy what it means to be a holy
[1:10:32] ghost-filled christian
[1:10:33] or taking too lightly that we
[1:10:37] are to have the token on display amen
[1:10:41] taking that too lightly see and so
[1:10:44] we're talking about in our everyday
[1:10:46] lives for everybody to see that's what
[1:10:47] the token on display means
[1:10:50] that's that's just a cliche if it's not
[1:10:52] true
[1:10:54] see the token on display means that i'm
[1:10:57] proving in my
[1:10:58] life my life is testifying to a
[1:11:00] spirit-filled
[1:11:01] existence so you know so if we
[1:11:04] misrepresent the true gospel
[1:11:06] by our carnal lifestyle hello
[1:11:10] hello if we represent
[1:11:17] and find ourselves in such a way
[1:11:20] projecting to the world
[1:11:23] misrepresenting the true gospel by a
[1:11:25] carnal lifestyle
[1:11:26] then there's little value listen friends
[1:11:29] there's there's almost no value in being
[1:11:31] religious if you're not spiritual
[1:11:34] amen i've seen a lot of people get
[1:11:37] religious and not any more spiritual and
[1:11:40] the more religious they gets most times
[1:11:42] the less spiritual they seem to get
[1:11:44] unto where the whole thing becomes a
[1:11:46] delusion to them
[1:11:47] and i'm going to tell you something a
[1:11:49] spiritual life is on fire for god
[1:11:51] how many believe that do we still
[1:11:53] believe that in
[1:11:55] 2021 hallelujah spiritual life is a life
[1:11:58] on fire for god the zeal of the lord
[1:12:01] is burning down inside of our souls
[1:12:05] it's a life void of a desire for the
[1:12:07] world it's a
[1:12:08] it's a visible life of self-crucifixion
[1:12:12] if that's not you as a christian you're
[1:12:14] not a true spirit christian
[1:12:16] amen see because it's void
[1:12:21] of the things of the world
[1:12:24] no i'm okay
[1:12:28] i did not fall
[1:12:32] poor siri thinking are you okay you
[1:12:34] sound like you're dying
[1:12:37] i'm trying to kill the devil siri but
[1:12:40] don't report that
[1:12:43] friends the bottom line is if we make it
[1:12:45] something other than what was taught and
[1:12:46] explained to us by the apostles and
[1:12:48] prophets in the new testament
[1:12:51] and that's what the world has done today
[1:12:52] and if you do that
[1:12:54] that's one of the most egregious
[1:12:55] failures we can commit
[1:12:57] amen that's i'ma say that again
[1:13:01] that's one of the most egregious
[1:13:02] failures you can commit
[1:13:05] is to is to make it something other than
[1:13:08] what was taught and explained to us by
[1:13:10] the apostles and prophets in the new
[1:13:11] testament
[1:13:13] see so so if for no other reason that
[1:13:17] then then then then you know that that
[1:13:19] we are
[1:13:20] you know i mean good grief i don't i
[1:13:22] don't want to play along so that i'm
[1:13:24] actually demonstrating the mystery of
[1:13:26] iniquity take your pick
[1:13:28] you want to demonstrate the mystery of
[1:13:30] iniquity
[1:13:32] why is it a mystery because nobody knows
[1:13:34] they're guilty of it
[1:13:35] they're blind and naked don't know it
[1:13:39] it's hidden denominationalism it's
[1:13:41] hidden
[1:13:42] it's a mystery of iniquity it's
[1:13:44] reasoning the word of god
[1:13:45] nobody understands not to do that they
[1:13:48] don't think they're doing that
[1:13:49] and that's why it's a mystery of
[1:13:51] iniquity
[1:13:52] and it would still be a mystery of
[1:13:54] iniquity and i'm here to tell you
[1:13:56] you wouldn't been smart enough to figure
[1:13:58] it out but god sent an
[1:14:00] uneducated hillbilly who stood in the
[1:14:02] presence of god and was able not to
[1:14:04] bring us
[1:14:05] intellectualism but unable to bring thus
[1:14:07] saith the lord
[1:14:09] so i know what iniquity is now it's not
[1:14:11] a mystery to me anymore
[1:14:14] see so given the fact that god
[1:14:18] chose you from among billions
[1:14:22] does that weigh on you friend he chose
[1:14:25] you from among billions to represent him
[1:14:27] and brother branham
[1:14:29] had that concern and i i said this in
[1:14:31] part one or part two
[1:14:33] are we are we sufficiently impressed by
[1:14:35] this amen
[1:14:37] is it sufficiently impressed upon your
[1:14:39] mind
[1:14:41] that god chose you
[1:14:44] from among billions
[1:14:48] looked over billions
[1:14:52] with a b billions
[1:14:57] multiple billions and chose
[1:15:00] you for eternal life and
[1:15:04] in a and gave you the secret to the
[1:15:06] mystery of iniquity
[1:15:08] and and is filling your life with the
[1:15:10] holy ghost
[1:15:11] and has brought a gene of god to life to
[1:15:14] where you can't even be lost
[1:15:17] does this sufficiently weigh upon us
[1:15:21] are we sufficiently impressed
[1:15:24] so one purpose and goal that brother
[1:15:27] branham says you know that he hadn't
[1:15:29] even gone into much detail
[1:15:31] until this message until he's coming to
[1:15:34] this message that we've been reading
[1:15:35] these quotes from from the message look
[1:15:36] in ninth
[1:15:37] he preached it several times and so he
[1:15:40] he talks about how that i haven't gone
[1:15:42] into a lot of detail about it
[1:15:44] and you know that i mean i gotta tell
[1:15:47] you that this this comforts me
[1:15:49] you know with what seems like a
[1:15:51] continual proclamation of doom is
[1:15:53] imminent and i get it
[1:15:55] i understand that sometimes we
[1:15:58] it's it it can just sound like oh you're
[1:16:01] always just in a proclamation of doom
[1:16:05] well the secret to escaping it is to
[1:16:09] focus on the word
[1:16:11] focus your life focus your life into the
[1:16:14] word
[1:16:16] then our life and the word will become
[1:16:19] one
[1:16:20] and you become a living unit of god
[1:16:25] see we're not talking about a sinless
[1:16:27] perfection enoch wasn't perfected
[1:16:29] enoch wasn't perfect there's none good
[1:16:32] no not one that's right
[1:16:34] amen we're all we all we like sheep have
[1:16:37] gone astray
[1:16:38] even elijah had um
[1:16:42] a man of like passions brother branham
[1:16:44] says with his ups and downs
[1:16:46] amen see we're all open sepulchers said
[1:16:49] paul we're all just dead men
[1:16:51] see there's only one good among us and
[1:16:54] that's christ it's not that enoch was a
[1:16:56] perfect man
[1:16:58] but his faith was in a fully revealed
[1:17:00] word and in fact
[1:17:02] is so great was his faith in that fully
[1:17:04] revealed word
[1:17:05] that he literally manifested that faith
[1:17:07] as he built the image
[1:17:09] as he built that image of the perfect
[1:17:11] word in his pyramid
[1:17:12] amen that pyramid was a manifestation of
[1:17:16] a revelation that was flowing through
[1:17:18] him
[1:17:18] that he couldn't rest day and night till
[1:17:20] he got it built for the world to see
[1:17:23] and paul peter says you're lively stones
[1:17:25] you're a temple now i'm here to tell you
[1:17:27] something friends
[1:17:27] we're building the image of the son of
[1:17:29] god in the last days
[1:17:31] your life is the is the antidote your
[1:17:35] lived life is the antidote to the
[1:17:37] deception
[1:17:38] of the lie that your neighbors are
[1:17:40] believing churches are believing
[1:17:42] billions of people are believing
[1:17:43] i say we got a lot of work to do and a
[1:17:45] short time to do it
[1:17:48] i say lord breathe on me with more fire
[1:17:50] lord breathe on me with more spirit
[1:17:52] cause me to be more real hallelujah is
[1:17:55] that your desire
[1:17:59] see so so i realized that
[1:18:04] you know even when my flesh doesn't seem
[1:18:06] to always live the right image
[1:18:08] there's still an inner voice amen drives
[1:18:11] me to my knees again
[1:18:12] does it to you drives you to your knees
[1:18:15] stands you back up on your feet and you
[1:18:17] start again hallelujah
[1:18:19] oh my so we find then let me try to let
[1:18:23] me try to find a place i want to try to
[1:18:26] finish this out
[1:18:30] so i mean that that that's a fair
[1:18:32] question to say
[1:18:35] why does then why does the bride go in
[1:18:38] the rapture
[1:18:40] and the unwise virgin does not
[1:18:44] i mean because let's face it there are
[1:18:46] some holiness groups that out
[1:18:47] outpace us in works see
[1:18:51] so if it's based on that it's going to
[1:18:52] be the opposite they're going to go and
[1:18:54] we're not going to go
[1:18:56] see so it's it's not about that thank
[1:18:58] god it's it's about the fact that i have
[1:19:00] believed the word
[1:19:02] for my day see then well then that just
[1:19:05] gives you carte blanche that just gives
[1:19:07] you a ticket to do
[1:19:08] anything it it it absolutely does do
[1:19:10] that it lets me do
[1:19:12] all my heart's desire and the more i get
[1:19:15] the more i hear of the mystery
[1:19:16] of god the more my heart's desire is
[1:19:18] this right here amen
[1:19:20] see it's not a forced imagery i'm not
[1:19:22] here today to preach a forced imagery
[1:19:24] i'm not here today to put you under
[1:19:26] legalism that's just religion
[1:19:29] that's almost no value at all i'm
[1:19:31] talking about a fire breathing
[1:19:32] experience friends
[1:19:34] something where you humble yourself
[1:19:36] daily and let the holy spirit come down
[1:19:38] and live in and through your lives
[1:19:41] the world is depending on us there we're
[1:19:45] the only version of jesus they'll see
[1:19:48] they don't see him until the end of
[1:19:49] revelation 19 and by that time it's too
[1:19:51] late
[1:19:53] so you are the only version that they
[1:19:55] will see
[1:19:57] it's a literally a reproduction you
[1:19:59] believe that of god's word
[1:20:01] reproduced in this day amen so brother
[1:20:04] branham comes to this
[1:20:06] right here and he says the spoken word
[1:20:09] is original seed
[1:20:10] if you haven't don't if you haven't
[1:20:13] don't believe all the word of god
[1:20:16] you haven't received the holy ghost yet
[1:20:19] right
[1:20:20] that's exactly right the holy spirit
[1:20:24] when you hear the truth
[1:20:26] and the holy spirit don't lead you to it
[1:20:28] then there's another spirit in there
[1:20:30] keeping you away from it
[1:20:32] so the spirit you got in you ain't the
[1:20:35] holy
[1:20:36] spirit amen see
[1:20:40] see that's a tough statement but that's
[1:20:41] the truth now watch
[1:20:44] brother branham says back to this
[1:20:47] message look
[1:20:49] there is a judgment coming the sinner
[1:20:51] knows it
[1:20:52] many people when you speak of church
[1:20:55] they have a funny idea
[1:20:56] that's true isn't it the world when they
[1:21:00] pass by the church
[1:21:04] i mean the body of christ gathered
[1:21:06] together
[1:21:07] they think of our women with some great
[1:21:11] long stringy hair with black dresses and
[1:21:14] everything and they think of the men
[1:21:16] with long fingers
[1:21:18] dressed in black clothes and always
[1:21:20] condemning them
[1:21:22] to a good sense of the word that's true
[1:21:27] because the church is a peculiar people
[1:21:31] a called out people watch
[1:21:35] the reason it looks that way
[1:21:38] to the man who wants to judge the church
[1:21:40] in that condition
[1:21:42] is because the church is always pointing
[1:21:44] a condemning finger to everything he
[1:21:46] thinks is good
[1:21:47] and if he's a sinner he thinks sin is
[1:21:50] good the pleasures of life such as
[1:21:52] living in the world
[1:21:53] and when the church stands up and
[1:21:55] condemns that thing
[1:21:56] it looks like a hideous animal to him
[1:21:59] but if he only knows
[1:22:01] it's god's only way of bringing
[1:22:03] salvation that's right
[1:22:04] expressing the word of god by the lips
[1:22:07] of his servant
[1:22:10] amen so i i get that unbelievers don't
[1:22:13] like
[1:22:14] me preaching like this i get that people
[1:22:17] who are believers but don't really have
[1:22:19] the holy ghost burning like they should
[1:22:21] get a little bent at preachers preaching
[1:22:24] like this
[1:22:26] we've had them sit right in this church
[1:22:27] and get flaming mad at the preachers
[1:22:30] amen i've dealt with it for 26 years but
[1:22:33] now you
[1:22:33] now you know why see now you know what
[1:22:37] you say
[1:22:38] oh yeah now i know why you preach it
[1:22:39] like that no no you're missing the the
[1:22:41] lesson
[1:22:42] now you know why you're reacting like
[1:22:44] that amen
[1:22:46] amen there's nothing wrong with the
[1:22:48] preachers
[1:22:49] they're not doing anything but what
[1:22:50] we're supposed to be doing
[1:22:52] but it's your reaction that's poor why
[1:22:55] is it because
[1:22:56] because the holy ghost coming out of
[1:22:58] here it doesn't find the holy ghost down
[1:23:00] inside of you
[1:23:02] and that's why it gets under your skin
[1:23:06] see so it becomes astonishing
[1:23:11] because i'm just going to try to turn
[1:23:12] that off it becomes astonishing then
[1:23:15] that we would have to revisit this over
[1:23:17] and over you know
[1:23:19] uh but as i said there's a relentless
[1:23:22] devil
[1:23:23] and this close to the finish line
[1:23:25] friends i'm here to tell you
[1:23:27] you know um that as a ministry
[1:23:31] it's amazing to me that we still have to
[1:23:33] earnestly contend for this
[1:23:36] but i'm going to earnestly contend for
[1:23:38] it until we're out of here
[1:23:42] you can rest assured i'm never going to
[1:23:44] sit back and let that lie
[1:23:46] be pervasive in those people who are
[1:23:49] under my care that's never going to
[1:23:50] happen
[1:23:51] we're too close to home i know that the
[1:23:54] spirit on the age daily
[1:23:55] i know it i know it tries to pound that
[1:23:58] into you constantly
[1:23:59] constantly trying to pound the image of
[1:24:01] the lie into your life
[1:24:03] but the word is preached you know why we
[1:24:05] preach it to keep you washed
[1:24:08] i'm washing you in the washing of the
[1:24:10] water of the word
[1:24:11] we're trying to keep you washed clean of
[1:24:13] this global deception
[1:24:16] so that you see and fully understand the
[1:24:18] lie that's important
[1:24:20] see and just as important perhaps as
[1:24:23] i've said
[1:24:24] perhaps even more so and certainly the
[1:24:26] main burden
[1:24:27] of my heart in these last sermons has
[1:24:30] been
[1:24:31] you know that you not conduct yourself
[1:24:34] in such a way as to facilitate
[1:24:37] that lie that's that's what keeps
[1:24:40] brother jason awake at night
[1:24:41] amen not that maybe you don't understand
[1:24:44] the mysteries
[1:24:45] not that you can't line up the seals
[1:24:47] trumpets vows and woes
[1:24:48] that doesn't keep me awake at night what
[1:24:51] keeps me awake at night
[1:24:53] is that some of you have believed the
[1:24:55] lie and it has duped you in your
[1:24:57] lifestyle
[1:24:58] and you've allowed carnality and you've
[1:25:00] allowed the flaming
[1:25:02] fire of the holy spirit to dim in your
[1:25:05] lives
[1:25:07] i want to read you some scriptures
[1:25:08] before we close
[1:25:10] nine minutes before i've set myself a
[1:25:12] self-imposed deadline i think i can just
[1:25:14] read these off
[1:25:15] and we'll stop
[1:25:21] first peter 2 9 but ye are a chosen
[1:25:25] generation
[1:25:26] you love that a royal priesthood
[1:25:30] a holy nation of peculiar people
[1:25:33] here's why here's why that ye should
[1:25:36] show forth show
[1:25:40] forth the praises of him who hath called
[1:25:43] you out of darkness
[1:25:44] into his marvelous light so am i off the
[1:25:47] word
[1:25:49] isn't this the desire of simon peter
[1:25:51] that you
[1:25:52] show forth his praises paul in
[1:25:55] philippians 2
[1:25:56] that ye may be blameless but jason why
[1:25:59] do you why have you taken three sermons
[1:26:01] on this
[1:26:01] that you may be blameless and harmless
[1:26:04] the sons of god without rebuke
[1:26:07] in the midst of a crooked and perverse
[1:26:10] nation among whom ye shine
[1:26:13] as lights in the world
[1:26:16] you remember my analogy of the
[1:26:18] lighthouse you got a ship out there
[1:26:20] being tossed
[1:26:22] people innocent are going to die unless
[1:26:24] your light beam can pierce the raging
[1:26:26] storm
[1:26:27] so you're going to brighten your light
[1:26:28] you're going to dim the light
[1:26:32] you know any any person who's got a
[1:26:35] problem with
[1:26:36] these three sermons i'm just gonna i
[1:26:38] want an answer to that question
[1:26:40] there's a ship out there there's
[1:26:41] innocent people the only way they're
[1:26:44] gonna get to safety is your lighthouse
[1:26:46] are you going to brighten the light or
[1:26:48] are you going to dim the light
[1:26:50] amen and it ends right there
[1:26:54] unless you're willing to answer that
[1:26:55] question don't berate me
[1:26:57] see don't don't say a word negative
[1:26:59] about these three services not that i
[1:27:01] have any not that i have even a single
[1:27:03] negative word not even one
[1:27:04] i'm just saying i'm just giving the
[1:27:06] devil notice lest there should be anyone
[1:27:09] in this church are out on the airwaves
[1:27:12] until you can answer that question for
[1:27:14] me because the answer is pretty obvious
[1:27:15] it's a trap you probably shouldn't try
[1:27:18] because it'll trap you see because if
[1:27:21] you say i should dim the light then i'm
[1:27:23] going to tell you you just go away from
[1:27:24] me you're going to hell and there's no
[1:27:26] hope for you
[1:27:27] if you if that's the kind of heart you
[1:27:28] have that you want to dim the light and
[1:27:30] people are
[1:27:31] re they're relying on a bright light
[1:27:34] and you claim you like them and love
[1:27:36] them and they're your work associates
[1:27:37] and your neighbors and you recreate with
[1:27:38] them and you work near them and you go
[1:27:40] to school with them and you shop with
[1:27:41] them
[1:27:42] and you see their children and and and
[1:27:45] and and you don't brighten the light
[1:27:48] you don't brighten the light you dim the
[1:27:50] light
[1:27:54] heartless is a is a compliment to what
[1:27:56] that
[1:27:57] is see look from the esv
[1:28:01] i love this philippians now we just read
[1:28:03] it we just read it here in king james
[1:28:05] look at
[1:28:05] look at esv that you may be blameless
[1:28:09] and innocent children of god without
[1:28:12] blemish
[1:28:13] in the midst of a crooked and twisted
[1:28:16] generation
[1:28:17] among whom you shine as lights in the
[1:28:20] world first john 1
[1:28:21] 5-8 esv this is the message
[1:28:24] we have heard from him and proclaimed to
[1:28:27] you that god is light
[1:28:29] and in him is no darkness at all if we
[1:28:32] say we have fellowship with him while we
[1:28:34] walk in darkness we
[1:28:35] lie and do not practice the truth
[1:28:38] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:28:41] the light
[1:28:42] we have fellowship one with another and
[1:28:45] the blood of jesus
[1:28:46] his son cleanses us from all sin
[1:28:50] let me give this last one i saved it for
[1:28:53] last
[1:28:54] second corinthians 4 1 and 2 therefore
[1:28:56] and one through actually we get 1 2 and
[1:28:58] then 11.
[1:28:59] therefore seeing we have this ministry
[1:29:01] this ministry don't read
[1:29:03] this ministry that i have taken three
[1:29:06] services
[1:29:06] back to back to back to deliver to
[1:29:10] you and i know i'll preach it again
[1:29:11] somewhere anytime i finish this series
[1:29:13] and it's still burning and i want to
[1:29:14] start all over
[1:29:15] i'm sure i'll preach it again somewhere
[1:29:17] i think it's timely
[1:29:19] now concerning what you've heard for
[1:29:20] three days therefore
[1:29:23] seeing we have this ministry the one
[1:29:26] i've been describing to you
[1:29:29] as we have received mercy we faint not
[1:29:32] but have renounced the hidden things of
[1:29:34] dishonesty
[1:29:36] not walking in craftiness nor handling
[1:29:38] the word of god deceitfully
[1:29:40] but by manifestation of the truth
[1:29:42] commending ourselves to every man's
[1:29:44] conscience
[1:29:45] in the sight of god for we which
[1:29:49] live are always delivered unto death for
[1:29:52] jesus's sake
[1:29:53] that the life also of jesus might be
[1:29:56] made manifest in our
[1:30:00] mortal flesh amen
[1:30:03] amen musicians come on stan
[1:30:08] god bless you amen
[1:30:11] you can take that down matt
[1:30:15] amen i made it
[1:30:18] got all the way through it and i feel
[1:30:23] satisfied amen
[1:30:26] friends i wanted that
[1:30:29] completed it's recorded it's on the
[1:30:33] internet now
[1:30:34] it's an archive let the record stand
[1:30:37] for whoever wants to believe it i'm here
[1:30:39] to tell you
[1:30:40] we're almost home amen and if there was
[1:30:43] ever a time that we need to be
[1:30:45] shining brightly in our lives
[1:30:48] is now the world
[1:30:52] is believing a misunderstanding of
[1:30:55] scripture
[1:30:57] so devastating
[1:31:00] so devastating is this misunderstanding
[1:31:04] so devastating that the
[1:31:08] overwhelming majority of
[1:31:11] billions of human beings are gonna go
[1:31:14] right into a three and a half year
[1:31:16] tribulation that's how devastating that
[1:31:18] lie is
[1:31:21] and so i want to expose it and once we
[1:31:24] know what it is
[1:31:25] then the answer becomes self-evident the
[1:31:28] answer is then to let your light
[1:31:30] shine and let your life
[1:31:33] demonstrate and manifest as we just read
[1:31:36] in your mortal
[1:31:39] flesh so don't tell me it doesn't matter
[1:31:43] about your mortal flesh how you dress
[1:31:46] how you look where you go what you do
[1:31:49] what you say
[1:31:50] your mortal flesh matters
[1:31:54] your mortal flesh the failures of your
[1:31:56] mortal flesh
[1:31:57] won't keep you out of the rapture
[1:31:59] because you've passed from death to life
[1:32:00] you can never come into the judgment a
[1:32:02] seed genome has come a seed gene
[1:32:04] there won't be one empty chair at that
[1:32:06] table
[1:32:07] but there also won't be one extra
[1:32:09] placemat at that table
[1:32:12] but while we're here friends how about
[1:32:14] we live it in such a way
[1:32:15] that we find every last seed on that
[1:32:17] book of life
[1:32:18] so we can go home and that we leave
[1:32:22] a mark in this world that we
[1:32:26] leave a testimony that you're willing to
[1:32:28] leave
[1:32:29] footprints on the sands of time
[1:32:33] that when someone in that tribulation
[1:32:35] sees it
[1:32:36] they'll see footprints and it just might
[1:32:38] save their life bow your heads with me
