[19:25] I'm so glad you'll understand why I'm

[19:30] the way that he will amen praise the
[19:36] Lord you believe we've come to the end
[19:38] of all things
[19:40] friends that's true I do a lot of
[19:42] thinking about the Beyond andj thinking
[19:46] about what's next and you know it's a
[19:49] it's a it's an encouragement to me
[19:51] because I know that my future is clear I
[19:54] know that my future is very bright I
[19:56] know that we have much to look forward
[19:59] to in the world coming and I'm I'm glad
[20:02] I want to take as many people with me as
[20:04] I can y'all want to come along amen

[20:22] who all will make it but I'm going to
[20:24] make it amen praise the Lord I am going
[20:27] to make it and so uh I'm glad because
[20:31] the world we live in is has reached a
[20:34] point you know where it's uh it's it
[20:37] life is is you know with under Satan's
[20:40] control for the believer uh this world
[20:43] is just a maddening place and uh but yet
[20:46] we have the answer amen and I want to
[20:49] deal with that just a little bit about
[20:51] you know what sin has done to the world
[20:53] and and and the place of the Gospel in
[20:56] the world but I also also would like to
[20:59] say to you today that regardless of what
[21:03] Satan has been able to accomplish and
[21:05] regardless of you know where you might
[21:09] think of yourself and your own self
[21:12] assessment might not be too high but I
[21:14] hope by the end of this sermon you're
[21:16] going to be in the stratosphere amen
[21:18] amen because it was really encouraging
[21:20] to me praise the Lord Luke chap 12 and I
[21:24] I'm saying all of that because this is a
[21:27] rather ominous text to open with Luke
[21:30] 12:
[21:39] 49-53 I am
[21:41] come to send fire on the earth and what
[21:46] will I if it be already kindled amen but
[21:51] I have a baptism to be baptized with and
[21:54] how am I straightened till it be
[21:57] accomplished amen suppose ye that I am
[22:00] come to give peace on Earth I tell you
[22:03] nay but rather
[22:05] division for from henceforth there shall
[22:08] be five in one house divided three
[22:10] against two two against three the father
[22:14] shall be divided against the Son and the
[22:16] son against the father the mother
[22:18] against the daughter and the daughter
[22:19] against the mother and the Mother-in-law
[22:22] against the daughter-in-law and the
[22:23] daughter-in-law against her
[22:26] mother-in-law mine amen wow what are you
[22:29] about to preach brother Jason to preach
[22:32] on starting a fire
[22:34] amen um let's let's continue reading I I
[22:38] I told the booth we'd stop at 53 but I
[22:40] want to keep
[22:42] going and he said also to the
[22:45] people when you see a cloud rise out of
[22:48] the West straight way you say there
[22:50] cometh a shower and so it is and when
[22:53] you see the south wind blow you say
[22:55] there will be heat and it cometh to pass
[22:58] you Hypocrites you can discern the face
[23:02] of the sky and of the Earth but how is
[23:04] it that you did not discern this
[23:08] time yay and why even of yourselves
[23:11] judge ye not what is right see so this
[23:16] is a situation where you know the Prince
[23:19] of Peace is bringing a message that
[23:23] don't sound too
[23:25] peaceful now that doesn't make him not
[23:27] the prince of
[23:28] peace all right so what we're going to
[23:31] find out is that the condition of the
[23:33] world it ain't on him yeah it's on us
[23:37] the condition of the world ain't on God
[23:40] when God built it he built it perfect
[23:42] it's mankind that broke it and is still
[23:46] breaking it and in Mass refuses to to
[23:50] let it be fixed now I'm glad that the
[23:54] Lord has a chosen people who are not
[23:57] only only willing willing to let him fix
[23:59] the world but let him fix
[24:01] us amen praise the Lord let's let's bow
[24:04] our heads father we thank you for your
[24:08] word just now as we read it and Lord you
[24:12] you you've been with me throughout the
[24:14] early morning hours Lord as I've said
[24:16] and just waited for you to put all this
[24:18] together and it seemed a struggle for me
[24:21] Lord but I see my way clear now and I'm
[24:24] grateful for that I pray that your great
[24:28] anointing it be upon the people and I
[24:31] don't even know fully what all you want
[24:32] to say but I'm just here to say it so
[24:35] Lord we give ourselves into your hands
[24:37] completely in Jesus name amen God bless
[24:41] you friends you can be
[24:56] seated
[25:04] I remember brother Jason making h a
[25:08] comment that caught my attention some
[25:10] months ago in one of his Sunday School
[25:13] classes or it might have been a
[25:15] Wednesday night I can't remember truly
[25:18] but brother Jason references Romans
[25:21] chapter one and I'm not going to take
[25:24] the time to go there today but you know
[25:28] his point was that all of the elements
[25:31] that Paul listed there in Romans one in
[25:35] Romans 1 which which are dire and
[25:39] disheartening and uh and you know it's
[25:43] it's God rendering a verdict of the
[25:46] earth and it ain't pretty and we find
[25:49] that it it was all prophetic because the
[25:52] world wasn't even had not even reached a
[25:55] point uh to what Paul was describing now
[25:59] everything he said was in play but not
[26:01] everything just like the the scripture
[26:04] where Paul says to Timothy at the in the
[26:07] last days perilous times shall come you
[26:09] remember that and we realize that it
[26:12] wasn't Paul wasn't suggesting that they
[26:15] didn't have perilous times in his day it
[26:18] was just simply pointing out
[26:19] prophetically that at the end time if
[26:22] you think it's perilous now amen way
[26:25] till you get there amen and you know
[26:27] know the Lord did not allow brother
[26:29] brandham tells us how that the Lord did
[26:32] not allow the early church to know all
[26:35] about how that he wouldn't actually come
[26:37] in their lifetime they all believed his
[26:39] coming was imminent that he wouldn't
[26:41] even T but he he and according and in
[26:44] God's mind he has not carried I mean in
[26:47] God's time it's only been a couple of
[26:48] days see so that's why the Apostle will
[26:51] say he'll come and he won't T he hasn't
[26:53] carried in his time frame but just
[26:55] remember his ways are not like yours
[26:57] don't go judging God by your standards
[27:00] because you're just a little pepper
[27:02] Speck on sitting on a little dot hanging
[27:04] in space that can barely be seen from
[27:07] you know from our our our Voyager
[27:09] spacecraft looking back sees the Earth
[27:12] as barely a little blue faint little
[27:14] blue dot against a a vast expanse where
[27:18] brother brandham and I'm aware that
[27:20] brother brandham talks about how they're
[27:22] looking to a curve but we don't
[27:23] understand what that means I do know
[27:25] that brother brandham did uh he did
[27:28] verify that uh that when science looks
[27:32] when we look up at stars and science
[27:34] says that those Stars which look close
[27:37] together are further apart from each
[27:40] other than we are from them yeah amen
[27:43] and and brother Brandon verifies that
[27:45] they I mean listen friends it's worlds
[27:46] of Worlds amen and they have certainly
[27:51] believe and they certainly believe that
[27:53] that that the universe is even ever
[27:56] expanding and I've always just said well
[27:58] that's a good thing because an ever
[28:00] expanding Kingdom of the increase of his
[28:03] kingdom there shall be no end an ever
[28:05] increasing kingdom is going to need an
[28:07] ever increasing universe so oh my what's
[28:10] ahead of us amen but we have
[28:15] to while we look forward to that we have
[28:19] to deal with the here and now we have to
[28:21] be real we have to understand that this
[28:25] isn't just some dream that we're living
[28:28] this is real life happening in real time
[28:31] and it's all purpose-driven God has a
[28:34] reason for you being here God has a
[28:36] reason for
[28:37] you being here right now not back there
[28:42] in Paul's day when Paul was looking
[28:44] ahead saying perilous times are coming
[28:47] and they're going to be uniquely worse
[28:49] and in Romans chapter one all of the
[28:52] various things that he uses to describe
[28:55] what's coming uh you're here yes this is
[29:00] you're it tag you're it and and they and
[29:04] as I said brother Bram said God didn't
[29:06] let them know that it was going to be
[29:09] 2,000 years of history and seven
[29:11] contiguous Church ages but but but
[29:15] because he said two for two reasons
[29:16] number one it would have it would have
[29:18] discouraged them but it would have also
[29:20] taken away their Zeal because why why
[29:23] press if you don't feel like it's
[29:25] imminent oh it's not coming in my
[29:27] lifetime anyway hey can I say to you
[29:30] today there ain't no more
[29:32] ages there ain't no more
[29:34] Messengers there's no more time
[29:37] remaining you're this is it we're not at
[29:40] the end time we're at the end of the end
[29:44] time and so it would be most foolish to
[29:48] bet against the scripture and think that
[29:50] life is just going to go on and on and
[29:52] on I'm I'm not here to suggest to you
[29:55] that that won't happen I'm here to tell
[29:57] you emphatically it can't happen right
[29:59] amen he is
[30:02] finished with the age of
[30:05] mankind living in a fallen
[30:09] condition brother brandham calls it that
[30:12] the age of man and I I don't I don't
[30:15] speculate on what that might mean I I've
[30:18] often wondered you know how did how did
[30:20] humans you know coexist with dinosaurs
[30:23] and maybe were they when were they
[30:25] destroyed were they tame was that before
[30:27] the fall was that I mean how did they
[30:29] run from them when when did all this
[30:31] happen was that in Noah's day I don't
[30:33] know the answers to that I know we'll
[30:35] understand it better by and by but I
[30:38] know that the prophet talks about an age
[30:39] of man maybe there was a time that they
[30:41] were here before man I don't know
[30:43] brother brandham talks about a a a
[30:46] ruined civilization some pre-existing
[30:49] civilization we don't know it doesn't
[30:51] matter I'm here right now and I got to I
[30:54] got to deal with life headon as it comes
[30:58] to me there's no getting out of it
[31:00] getting around it or getting by getting
[31:02] by it Jesus started a fire and you're
[31:05] going to have to go through
[31:07] it the Hebrew children Shadrach meach
[31:12] and Abednego could not avoid it amen
[31:16] they had to go through that fire to seal
[31:18] their testimony and so do you so since
[31:22] you have to go through it and you can't
[31:25] get out of it may I suggest the Fourth
[31:28] Man may I suggest that you have the
[31:31] Fourth Man In The Fire say I want the
[31:34] Lord Jesus well they did too he was in
[31:37] the fire so don't run from it don't cry
[31:40] over it don't collapse over it face it
[31:43] he's
[31:44] there he's with you wherever you go he
[31:47] said I will never leave you nor forsake
[31:51] you
[31:53] amen and it was incredible how that
[31:56] brother Jason was showed that list in
[31:58] Romans 1 that nearly every last single
[32:01] one of the elements Paul describes if
[32:03] not all of
[32:05] them are either either mostly almost
[32:08] entirely
[32:10] history they were prophecy when Paul
[32:12] wrote them they're history today and and
[32:15] even even even the last ones maybe we're
[32:17] at the very last one and it's being
[32:20] fulfilled as we speak Amen in Luke 12
[32:24] and 50 where we read in the w expanded
[32:28] translation it says it like this
[32:31] moreover I have an immersion by which I
[32:35] will be
[32:37] overwhelmed and let let me Let me
[32:39] refresh you from the King James but but
[32:42] I have a baptism to be baptized with and
[32:45] how am I straightened till it be
[32:49] accomplished from the W expanded
[32:51] translation moreover I have an immersion
[32:54] by which I will be
[32:56] overwhelmed now you would think that
[32:59] Jesus would have been his next line
[33:02] would have been so I'm running for the
[33:06] hills that's what humans would normally
[33:09] do if you found out that they're
[33:12] suffering ahead of you you're going to
[33:14] run the other way that's right if you
[33:16] find out that somebody is plotting evil
[33:19] against you you're not just going to
[33:21] keep going forward as if you hope it
[33:23] happens right but then again you're not
[33:27] the
[33:28] Lord he says I have an immersion by
[33:31] which I will be overwhelmed how am I
[33:36] hard pressed from every side until it be
[33:40] consummated amen he he he just wanted to
[33:44] get it over with they they said they
[33:47] wanted to make him a king Lord don't do
[33:49] it and he said the cup my father has
[33:53] given me to drink what are you
[33:55] suggesting Simon that I not drink it I I
[33:59] remember um was it brother uh step
[34:03] coffee was ministering here and talking
[34:06] about how he was going back there
[34:08] referring to brother brandham in the
[34:10] quotes and brother talking about how
[34:12] Jesus you know he didn't want to die he
[34:14] didn't have a death wish he had his
[34:17] Brethren he loved life he loved his
[34:19] Brethren he didn't want to die he had a
[34:22] will but he he he found a way to
[34:25] surrender and say not my will will thy
[34:28] will be done friends that's got to be
[34:31] our heart it do to say not my will
[34:34] ultimately Lord not my will thine be
[34:38] done as long as you have confidence that
[34:42] that he's not going to lose you and that
[34:44] he can he can hold on and even if you go
[34:47] to the Grave he can raise you up and
[34:49] that he will never you're in your F in
[34:52] his father's hand and you can never be
[34:54] lost from it what a confidence it ought
[34:56] to give
[34:58] us and how that Jesus was brother Steven
[35:02] was saying how that here he's sitting
[35:05] around the fire cuz he was just a man
[35:08] who sat around the fire with his
[35:10] disciples and he loved them and they
[35:12] laughed and they had fellowship and just
[35:15] like we would sit around and laugh and
[35:16] have fellowship and talk about the good
[35:19] things of God brother brandham on
[35:20] testimony on the sea he's got all the
[35:22] disciples out there in a boat and
[35:24] everybody's vying let me tell it let me
[35:26] tell my testimony oh wait oh no hold on
[35:28] I want to tell mine first they all want
[35:30] to tell of the great things oh I
[35:32] remember when he came down that day and
[35:34] took those and and he took those fish
[35:36] and those Loaves and I watched it
[35:38] multiply right in front of my eyes oh my
[35:41] what a story well what about that time
[35:43] we were thought we were doing doomed
[35:45] boys we thought we were finished and
[35:48] here he comes walking on the water and
[35:50] and at first we thought it was a ghost
[35:52] and started screaming bloody murder and
[35:54] he ran up to the boat on the water and
[35:56] said said calm down it's me and he said
[35:58] and then suddenly we're at the
[36:01] shore it has teleported us from the
[36:03] middle of a Raging Sea he can do that
[36:05] today he can teleport you he can
[36:08] transport you from a raging Inferno just
[36:10] like the three Hebrew boys and just take
[36:13] you right through it and there won't
[36:14] even be the smell of smoke on your
[36:17] garments he can take you you're in the
[36:19] middle of a raging Storm he can put you
[36:21] on the shore right
[36:24] now amen see
[36:29] so from Eugene Peterson's translation
[36:33] called the message he in in in verses 49
[36:37] to 53 where we've
[36:39] read Peterson translates it like this
[36:43] I've come to start a fire on this
[36:47] Earth how I wish it were blazing right
[36:52] now I have come to change everything
[36:57] turn now this is this is some different
[37:00] language from the lowly Nazarene
[37:02] yeah suddenly now the lowly Nazarene
[37:06] walking the shores of Galilee going
[37:08] about doing good with gentle words and a
[37:11] gentle touch and embrac children and
[37:13] blessed them and raised the dead and and
[37:16] and and was and had compassion upon
[37:19] people and now here he's saying hey I've
[37:23] come to start a fire on this Earth and
[37:26] in fact is I wish it were blazing right
[37:29] now I've come to change everything Lord
[37:32] what do you mean turn everything right
[37:35] side up how I long for it to be finished
[37:41] God he's not he's not you know it's not
[37:43] a death wish he's not he's not a a a a
[37:46] purveyor of Doom and Gloom he's just
[37:49] simply you you're here today saying oh I
[37:52] just wish it was over he was saying that
[37:54] 2,000 years ago Amen Let Me let me tell
[37:56] you something the one who chose you and
[37:58] called you and saved you he has a
[38:01] kingdom and he desires you to be there
[38:03] more than you desire to be
[38:05] there but but he knows best how to get
[38:08] you
[38:10] there and that's where trust comes in
[38:13] amen where we have to have confidence he
[38:16] goes on in Peterson's translation here
[38:19] those 49 to 53 do you
[38:22] think this is Jesus do you think I came
[38:26] to SM smoth things over and make
[38:27] everything nice oh not
[38:31] so not
[38:33] so I've come to disrupt and
[38:37] confront from now
[38:39] on when you find five in a house it will
[38:44] be a father against a son a son against
[38:47] a father a mother against a daughter A
[38:49] Daughter against her mother and and and
[38:52] and and I just say to you today friends
[38:54] that while is this is shocking to hear
[38:58] the Gentle Savior say but sometimes this
[39:01] kind of shock is necessary to awaken
[39:05] people from some kind of a dreamlike
[39:08] stuper or blindness that we walk around
[39:11] in and we have to go oh my
[39:14] goodness and God uses these kinds of
[39:17] things amen there is in case you didn't
[39:20] know
[39:21] it say what is wrong with the world and
[39:24] everybody's asking that everybody's
[39:26] saying what is wrong with the world and
[39:28] and you you can't hardly find the man on
[39:30] the street who sees you know we we we my
[39:34] wife and I were talking about just this
[39:36] morning and and I they're talking about
[39:39] you know the the covid and how many
[39:41] strains of covid and and and it's only
[39:44] and there's so many more and I said well
[39:46] you know it's I stood in a p in this
[39:48] pull pit several years ago and I said
[39:50] well not going to fear it because
[39:51] there'll only be five more behind it and
[39:54] 10 more behind those five and then 10
[39:56] more behind those 10 it's not going to
[39:59] get better brother BR there's no peace
[40:01] till Jesus comes brother brandham fell
[40:03] under under prophecy and fell into a
[40:06] vision and came out of that vision and
[40:08] said thus sayeth the Lord if you ever
[40:11] see musini head to Ethiopia then from
[40:15] that point there will be no peace in the
[40:18] earth until Jesus
[40:20] comes and he said they wanted to they P
[40:23] they were threatening to arrest me for
[40:24] saying something like that that I was
[40:27] you know they they they wanted they
[40:28] wanted to kind of you know accuse him of
[40:31] stirring up a riot an Insurrection and
[40:34] he all he was doing was saying what God
[40:35] had showed him but what the what the
[40:38] blind World couldn't see is his prophecy
[40:40] was connecting to the trumpets and the
[40:42] vs not here to preach on that today but
[40:44] it was
[40:45] perfect and and it and it the if the
[40:47] first W produced a a world a first world
[40:50] war and a second woe produced a second
[40:53] world war and the second woe doesn't
[40:56] even in until you're already in the
[40:59] tribulation then you tell me where's the
[41:03] Breather we're going to get a breather
[41:05] no we're
[41:06] not the world has constantly been at War
[41:09] since that hour and it won't be peaceful
[41:12] until Christ comes and sets up a
[41:14] millennium and the second woe doesn't
[41:16] even end until Revelation 11 we're
[41:18] already gone Moses and Elijah have now
[41:21] been martyred the 144,000 are martyred
[41:24] the foolish virgin are martyred and the
[41:26] Bible says the end of the second woe now
[41:29] cometh the Third Woe quickly oh I'm here
[41:32] to tell you something friends hide me in
[41:34] the Cliff of the rock you think the
[41:36] world is troubled now you can't spell
[41:38] trouble compared to what's
[41:41] happening amen and you say I just want
[41:44] it to be over so does the
[41:49] Lord and people say what is wrong with
[41:51] the world and you know and I and I and I
[41:54] just read an article you know and they
[41:55] they saying there's so many variations
[41:57] of Co now and it's only not a new
[42:00] pandemic cuz it's not killing people
[42:02] it's it's just mild flu but there's so
[42:03] many variations and I just read a
[42:05] headline just just yesterday or the day
[42:07] before and it said and the headline was
[42:10] why are all my friends
[42:12] sick and everybody's sick and we're
[42:15] constantly hearing it we got sick people
[42:16] out today and we had them last week and
[42:18] the week before Oh I'm here to tell you
[42:21] and and then you've got the insanity of
[42:23] that's going on in the
[42:24] world and was talking about wars and
[42:27] rumors of wars you always Jesus said you
[42:29] have that but the end is not yet wars
[42:31] and rumors of wars just simply are the
[42:34] judgments pouring out but there are
[42:36] certain things that he said when you see
[42:38] this now then look up your Redemption
[42:40] draweth nigh he would say another place
[42:42] when you see this this and the other
[42:44] then know that summer is nice so we we
[42:46] get these Clues to to show that we're at
[42:49] the end time and the whole world you
[42:51] know is uh you know I I I've testified
[42:54] to you some kind some couple years ago
[42:56] go uh and I I I caught the the openings
[42:59] the opening volley of the you know the
[43:03] Nightly News anchor watching it on a an
[43:05] archive on my laptop and he opens up
[43:09] with this is his opening line friends
[43:13] the world is falling
[43:15] apart amen that's the opening wter
[43:18] kronite except it wasn't kronite it was
[43:21] one of our guys right here in the modern
[43:22] day it just a couple years ago the world
[43:25] is falling apart and the average man on
[43:28] the street shakes his head you can get a
[43:30] conversation started just like that and
[43:31] people are just at at a loss for what is
[43:34] wrong with the world and as a preacher I
[43:37] I I I have the answer it's not one that
[43:41] everybody wants to hear because they're
[43:43] hoping it can be fixed politically or
[43:45] economically or something like that or
[43:47] or somehow love just love and then
[43:49] there's music and music can fix it and
[43:51] government can fix it which can't fix
[43:53] anything and and you I don't mean to say
[43:57] that like that but but but we're all
[43:59] laughing because we know that's the
[44:01] truth it's kind of like the oxymoron of
[44:04] military
[44:06] intelligence
[44:08] so but
[44:10] anyway uh I I've I've said to people and
[44:14] you would be amazed how many people are
[44:16] like huh what where where's that what do
[44:18] you mean I wonder do people even read
[44:20] the Bible in this country anymore right
[44:23] I don't think they do I think they just
[44:25] go to these churches they hear these
[44:26] flower feel-good speeches you know where
[44:29] they don't deal with sin and they don't
[44:31] they don't they don't identify modern
[44:33] events and
[44:35] prophecy and I'm I'm like well you do
[44:37] know there's a strong delusion that was
[44:39] to be released on the earth at the end
[44:41] time a a what a what a strong delusion
[44:45] what what does that mean what does that
[44:46] even mean preacher and then you're
[44:48] you're trying to break it down to say
[44:50] listen there's a there's an atmosphere
[44:52] of insanity
[44:53] yeah really yeah it's under of the
[44:56] seventh vial it was a it was a plague
[44:58] that broke out in the air and you can't
[45:00] get a vaccine or wear a mask or social
[45:02] distance from it it's in the atmospheres
[45:04] it's part of the plagues now it doesn't
[45:06] thank God none of those vials come in
[45:08] their fullness until the tribulation
[45:10] period but all of them just like the
[45:12] seals were partially broken open down
[45:14] through history yes amen and plagues
[45:16] drop brother brandham said he says that
[45:18] right on tape brother brandham throws up
[45:20] a rock in the air and says judgment
[45:22] striking the West Coast now from here
[45:24] it'll just get worse and worse and worse
[45:26] and the world is going to get worse with
[45:29] no let up I'm here to tell you for the
[45:32] bride it'll get worse and worse but we
[45:34] go
[45:36] up thank God thank God thank
[45:41] godl but there is a a an inbred
[45:47] corruption that has been brought on the
[45:50] earth from the cruelty of sin and the
[45:53] fact that this is Satan's Eden and
[45:56] Mankind has been eating from the Tree of
[45:59] knowledge and and that has perverted I
[46:02] mean listen friends even biologically
[46:05] that has perverted the gene pool of
[46:07] humanity amen
[46:09] amen
[46:11] absolutely you know they they they you
[46:14] know I I had somebody say to me one time
[46:16] said that uh
[46:19] homosexuality it it can be proven by
[46:22] scientific that that it's in the genes
[46:25] and and and so you know I said well look
[46:28] I'm I wouldn't deny at all that we're
[46:31] all born with various propensities
[46:34] brother brandham called it weak spots
[46:35] you have to keep your guard over it's
[46:38] just the problem is we just need
[46:42] regene come on that's the real
[46:45] problem the world has you were you were
[46:47] born in sin but not only that agees
[46:49] ahead of you were and by now brother
[46:52] brandham said even went to Food and
[46:54] hybrid food and said it's killing our
[46:56] brain
[46:58] cells and we've got Insanity on the
[47:00] streets that a prophet is identifying
[47:02] from hybrid food I hope you pray over
[47:05] your
[47:06] fooden I hope you're like Thomas Jackson
[47:09] who didn't even take a drink of water
[47:11] without thanking God for it Stonewall
[47:15] Jackson let tell you something friends
[47:17] this is no time to be away from the F
[47:20] Pillar of Fire this is no time let me
[47:23] warn you this is not the hour to be
[47:25] distant from the pillar of fire he told
[47:28] the Jews he said stay close because
[47:31] you're going through a section you've
[47:32] never been here before and you're going
[47:34] to need to stay close and whenever the
[47:37] trumpet would sound they had to pack up
[47:39] camp two and a half million people and
[47:41] because the pillar of fire is moving and
[47:43] as soon as they see it moving they run
[47:45] to the mountain top and blow a trumpet
[47:46] and everybody starts pulling up stakes
[47:48] and packing quickly he's on the Move
[47:50] well if you were somewhere way off in
[47:52] the wilderness and you didn't hear the
[47:55] the trumpet sound I'm here to tell you
[47:57] some friends the trumpet sounds from
[47:59] here don't find your life way off away
[48:03] from hearing the
[48:06] trumpet don't let your life get so full
[48:10] of stuff amen amen you don't have time
[48:14] to come to church and hear the word of
[48:16] God it's a low priority in your life and
[48:20] and everything else is stacked above it
[48:23] when a when a prophet is pleading saying
[48:25] Jesus wants to be first don't make him
[48:28] second he wants to be first in your life
[48:31] he said don't make him second let me
[48:33] tell you something about
[48:36] Jesus can I say how do you know because
[48:39] I had a prophet say it can I tell you
[48:41] something about
[48:42] Jesus he don't want to be
[48:46] second he don't deserve to be second he
[48:51] wants to be first he paid a heavy price
[48:56] to be
[48:58] first but he wants you to let him be
[49:01] first what wife wants to say to her
[49:04] husband I order you to tell me you love
[49:06] me okay I love you what does that
[49:08] mean it doesn't mean anything it's
[49:10] almost
[49:12] offensive if I got to tell you and you
[49:15] know and and and and those are those are
[49:16] things that husbands stand and pledge
[49:19] to Sure guys what do you think what do
[49:23] you what do you think cherish means
[49:27] that's the number one vow I find broken
[49:29] in
[49:30] marriages number one vow the vow to
[49:33] cherish and and not very long after
[49:36] matrimony is is signed sealed and
[49:38] delivered CH cherishing goes kind of by
[49:40] the
[49:41] wayside happens from wives to husbands
[49:44] as well love one another tell them you
[49:47] love them show them you love them you
[49:49] love the Lord tell him show
[49:52] him he loves you he tells you he shows
[49:57] you does he not am I wrong he shows you
[50:01] he loves
[50:02] you thank you
[50:06] Lord it has literally polluted the very
[50:09] gene pool of
[50:13] humanity in this last
[50:18] age it's
[50:20] uh Luke Luke 12 is just an amazing piece
[50:23] of Intel from the heart and mind of the
[50:26] Creator and and all about his plan and
[50:29] we find
[50:31] that that ultimately the plan of the
[50:34] Prince of
[50:36] Peace that that ultimately his ministry
[50:40] would not
[50:41] bring
[50:43] peace but division yeah and the reason
[50:47] it brings
[50:49] division is that because some would
[50:52] accept what he has to say yes amen While
[50:56] others would not accept what he has to
[50:59] say so the chaos so the conflict so the
[51:03] trouble that is in this world is not on
[51:08] God as I said to you already it's on
[51:11] mankind amen the Creator in his grace
[51:15] and his
[51:17] Mercy he doesn't even have to do it he
[51:19] makes his plan known but mankind my
[51:23] goodness in his seemingly a a
[51:26] determined uh Bend there there's like a
[51:29] determined Rebellion that works mankind
[51:33] just determined to work with all his
[51:35] might and people go to
[51:38] extraordinary Le Feats and levels to
[51:42] resist the word of God
[51:47] Amen it's it's shocking
[51:50] because they're resisting mercy and life
[51:53] and God doesn't even have to give it to
[51:55] them
[51:56] amen I mean that's messed up here is God
[52:01] not even he's not even have to do it and
[52:04] he warns you what his life is like and
[52:08] tells you make sure you do this and it
[52:09] and it actually gets down into the
[52:11] nitty-gritty of your life and saying if
[52:12] you want a good life then then then
[52:15] operate from the operator's
[52:17] manual because I I I wrote this for a
[52:20] reason and this will tell you how to
[52:22] live and this will tell you how to be
[52:23] successful and this will tell you and
[52:25] the world is going to have a bunch of
[52:27] other voices that might look like it'll
[52:30] give you a better Advantage than this
[52:31] but ultimately that's death and only
[52:33] this is life I'm I'm sorry I don't have
[52:36] a third alternative that's death and
[52:39] this is life that's it make your choice
[52:42] choose you this day whom you will serve
[52:45] do you want to live or do you want to
[52:47] die that's the bottom
[52:51] line there's not another all there's not
[52:53] a third answer
[52:56] but man in his determined Rebellion say
[52:59] what makes it he so determined it's the
[53:01] it's the uh it's the spirit of
[53:03] delusion a strong delusion that he sends
[53:07] upon the world and and the strong
[53:09] delusion is for one purpose now it's not
[53:14] cruel in the sense
[53:19] of in in the sense of you know God is
[53:23] just some un feeling being who just
[53:26] here's life take it or leave it follow
[53:28] me or die that's not his attitude amen
[53:32] he he so loved the world he gave his
[53:34] only begotten
[53:35] son he so loved the world that he laid
[53:38] aside his Splendor came down and
[53:41] fashioned himself in the form of sinful
[53:43] man and lived a life just like we do so
[53:45] that he could feel everything you would
[53:47] feel you think he had to do they didn't
[53:49] have to do that at
[53:50] all he could have absolutely destroyed
[53:53] the world Jesus said that you think my
[53:55] my father wouldn't presently send
[53:57] Legions of angels destroy this world Set
[54:00] Me Free start over with me just start
[54:02] over with
[54:04] me and then the whole world be populated
[54:06] by me multiplied God is actually going
[54:08] to do that but he's he wasn't going to
[54:10] do it by killing off the world he was
[54:12] going to do it by sending the gospel to
[54:14] his
[54:15] family
[54:17] Hallelujah and this is where the
[54:21] disharmony in the world comes from we
[54:25] have to walk in this fire as I said when
[54:28] I started just like the three Hebrews
[54:30] the only way to survive so let so let me
[54:33] say it again we have to walk in this
[54:35] fire you have to no options there's no
[54:38] out amen okay there's no get out of jail
[54:41] free card there's no exit ramp we all
[54:45] have to walk through this world that is
[54:48] on fire the only way help me say the
[54:53] only way the only way the only way to
[54:56] survive is to have the fourth man
[54:58] walking with
[54:59] youl amen
[55:02] amen but but you have to take a stand
[55:05] for him like they
[55:10] did Eugene Peterson goes on from verses
[55:13] 54 and 56 then he turned to the
[55:17] crowd when you see clouds coming in from
[55:20] the
[55:21] West you say storm's coming and you're
[55:24] right
[55:26] and when the wind comes out of the South
[55:27] you say this will be a hot one and
[55:30] you're right
[55:31] frauds
[55:33] frauds you know how to tell a change in
[55:36] weather so don't tell me you can't tell
[55:39] a change in the season right the god
[55:42] season we're in right now amen you know
[55:48] I it I I I I have no sympathy for people
[55:52] who oppose the word of God right
[55:55] and I have I have pity but but at the
[55:59] same time you know while I have human
[56:02] pity you know God does it like this he
[56:05] says I'll send us if you choose if you
[56:10] make the choice I won't Force you but if
[56:12] you he says if you choose to throw me
[56:15] out of your thinking you don't want my
[56:18] word you're determined to Go Your Own
[56:20] Way fine then I will send on you a
[56:24] strong illusion so that you'll believe a
[56:27] lie and be damned by it and why would
[56:30] you do that so basically I don't have to
[56:32] mess with you anymore I'm I'm now
[56:34] Justified that I gave you a chance you
[56:36] won't be able to accuse me on that day I
[56:38] gave you a chance you didn't want it I'm
[56:40] gonna I got better things to do with my
[56:42] time I need to save my family and if you
[56:45] don't want me
[56:47] fine then then then have a nice life
[56:50] this is it this is all you have right
[56:53] right that's that's why brother the
[56:55] brandom said that we give up our rights
[56:57] say oh yeah well a sheep gives up not
[56:58] not just for that reason not just
[57:01] because the spirit of Christ but you
[57:03] give up your rights brother Ram said if
[57:04] somebody cuts in front of you in line
[57:06] let them you're not from here right amen
[57:09] they're they're actually native to here
[57:11] you're not you're a citizen from above
[57:12] You're an Alien amen you don't have any
[57:14] rights
[57:16] here these people this is the only life
[57:18] they'll ever have you're going to live
[57:20] forever brother Brandon even talks about
[57:23] somebody getting pleasure out of his
[57:24] cigarettes and his alcohol brother I'm
[57:26] said don't take that from him that may
[57:28] be the only pleasure he he ever has tell
[57:31] him about you don't have to settle for
[57:34] that but don't just crush him on it
[57:37] don't don't just make him miserable I'm
[57:39] not interested in bringing somebody off
[57:41] the street and brow beating them into
[57:43] misery where they get just enough
[57:46] Christianity to make themselves
[57:47] miserable we're not that this isn't a
[57:50] prison this is a hospital and I'm trying
[57:52] to bring healing and but maybe you you
[57:54] don't want the medicine okay there's
[57:56] nothing more I can do I love you God
[57:58] bless you but I'm here to tell you there
[58:00] is a bomb in Gilead and you don't have
[58:02] to be a prisoner you don't have to be
[58:04] sick you can be
[58:08] healed but
[58:11] choose these verses from our Lord are
[58:15] exposing the hypocrisy among the
[58:17] religious leaders of his day and they
[58:20] expose the hypocrisy of the religious
[58:21] leaders today the leaders and the people
[58:24] who had you know who had especially in
[58:28] this day it exposes the people who had
[58:31] intentionally sought out teachers having
[58:34] itching ears to tell them what they
[58:37] wanted to hear and give them a
[58:39] convenient version of The Gospel that
[58:41] they wish was
[58:42] true see the gospel the version you want
[58:46] to be that you wish that you want to be
[58:49] true itching ears tell them what they
[58:51] want to hear and so then they'll believe
[58:53] it you tell somebody AE if it's what
[58:55] they want to hear they'll believe
[58:58] it it's very much like Jeremiah in
[59:03] chapter
[59:03] 8 and I'm just going to read you from
[59:06] the Amplified version this is by this
[59:09] point now Israel's in
[59:12] captivity very sad Israel has been
[59:15] depopulated of the Jews and they're now
[59:17] in captivity and God warned them and
[59:20] pleaded with them and sent them prophets
[59:21] and they killed them and send them more
[59:23] prophets and they had eily mistreat them
[59:25] and kill them too and and he he'd rise
[59:27] up righteous Kings and then finally
[59:29] worse Kings and worse Kings and worse
[59:31] till finally they just were taken Israel
[59:34] was taken the 10 tribes were taken uh by
[59:36] the Assyrians and then later Judah is
[59:39] taken and Jerusalem is sacked by
[59:42] Nebuchadnezzar and and we find
[59:45] that that Jeremiah comes with this very
[59:49] sad and this is a this is a three-way
[59:53] call okay this is it's like a a Biblical
[59:56] Zoom call okay there a three-way
[59:59] conversation I just want to bring you in
[1:00:01] on that this is between Jeremiah and the
[1:00:05] people and
[1:00:07] God and Jeremiah says in verse 18 oh
[1:00:13] that I could comfort myself against
[1:00:16] sorrow for my grief is beyond healing my
[1:00:21] heart is sick and faint Within Me Be
[1:00:24] hold says Jeremiah the prophet listen to
[1:00:28] the voice now he's speaking to God he he
[1:00:31] he's crying out to the Lord Lord listen
[1:00:35] to the voice of the Cry of the daughter
[1:00:38] of my people for help because of those
[1:00:41] who dwell in a far country is not the
[1:00:44] Lord in
[1:00:45] Zion is not her King in
[1:00:49] her but the Lord
[1:00:52] answers why have they provoked me to
[1:00:55] anger with their carved images and with
[1:00:58] their foreign
[1:00:59] Idols the people speak
[1:01:03] up the people speak up but the Harvest
[1:01:07] has passed the summer has ended and the
[1:01:10] Gathering of the fruit is over yet we're
[1:01:12] not
[1:01:14] saved Jeremiah jumps back in for the
[1:01:17] hurt of the daughter of my people am I
[1:01:21] Jeremiah hurt I go around more morning
[1:01:25] dismay has taken hold on me is there no
[1:01:29] bomb in Gilead is there no physici there
[1:01:34] why then is not the health of the
[1:01:36] daughter of my people restored and God
[1:01:39] replies because Zion is no
[1:01:43] longer Zion no longer enjoyed the
[1:01:47] presence of the great
[1:01:51] physician why is she sick why is she not
[1:01:55] healed why why why are
[1:01:58] 33,000 in denominational churches filled
[1:02:02] with sickness why are they not healed
[1:02:05] because they have the Bible why are they
[1:02:07] not healed because the presence of the
[1:02:10] great physician is
[1:02:12] gone and he he resides only in one place
[1:02:16] in his word and the only access you have
[1:02:18] to him is through his word you can't
[1:02:21] join a church you can't have a society
[1:02:24] you it's not about a mental Ascent to
[1:02:26] doctrinal agreement it's not about that
[1:02:29] it's about your whole heart has been
[1:02:30] given over to
[1:02:32] God
[1:02:35] Amen it is understandable to feel
[1:02:37] overwhelmed and discouraged at times
[1:02:40] amen but you know something friends as I
[1:02:44] I I I I'd like to turn a
[1:02:48] corner it is understandable I just want
[1:02:50] to say to you it
[1:02:52] is the world is a broken sad place and
[1:02:55] amen nature is still beautiful but
[1:02:57] mankind has nearly ruined it now and you
[1:03:02] know it's we can feel overwhelmed and we
[1:03:05] can all feel discouraged but I just want
[1:03:08] to say this to you and I say it to you
[1:03:11] because the world
[1:03:14] largely sadly doesn't really care all
[1:03:17] that much they're happy to agree with
[1:03:20] this statement but really to have any
[1:03:22] effect of it in their lives only God
[1:03:24] family is willing to have any effect in
[1:03:26] their lives and here's my statement it
[1:03:28] is it it is a a fact that sometimes we
[1:03:33] get overwhelmed it is a fact that
[1:03:35] sometimes we get discouraged but we
[1:03:36] should never lose sight of the fact that
[1:03:39] God still reigns from his throne he's
[1:03:43] still in control Satan cannot and has
[1:03:48] never defeated
[1:03:53] him this benevolent
[1:03:56] Creator who a prophet in our day
[1:03:59] described such almost poetry to me it's
[1:04:03] not even a sermon it's it's it's more
[1:04:06] like
[1:04:07] poetry he describes this
[1:04:10] Creator as a great fountain in the
[1:04:13] eternities you're familiar with it
[1:04:14] you've read the Times where brother
[1:04:16] Brenham wax is poetic talks about that
[1:04:19] great
[1:04:20] Fountain setting in the
[1:04:22] eternities and now that he designed this
[1:04:26] world with such great care and such
[1:04:29] great affection and and and in fact is
[1:04:32] his love can be seen in The Wonder of
[1:04:34] nature his love can be seen in all
[1:04:37] creation
[1:04:39] Amen brother brandham says in he in his
[1:04:43] Hebrew series
[1:04:47] 1957 now mzc this is where we were
[1:04:50] Wednesday night now MDC was a priest but
[1:04:54] was he he he is he is what he was I'm
[1:05:00] sorry here is what he was let me start
[1:05:03] again now mzc was a priest was he here
[1:05:06] is what he was we find out that God in
[1:05:10] the beginning was a great Fountain of
[1:05:14] spirit amen Bo that is just a a simple
[1:05:19] Kentucky way of just I I can just get
[1:05:22] that he's not using all the Greek and
[1:05:25] Hebrew and this you know and it's just
[1:05:28] all a bunch of nonsense I I I read one
[1:05:31] time and I did it here in church and my
[1:05:33] dad he it was one of his favorite
[1:05:35] memories of me Ever In a Pulpit he said
[1:05:37] I he was often would say I love that
[1:05:39] time when you you know gave the the uh
[1:05:41] lexical a definition to the word in
[1:05:43] morphe and and you know I got all the
[1:05:46] great Scholars together and it was this
[1:05:47] big wordy long this word and that word
[1:05:50] and this root word connects to that word
[1:05:51] and this means that and then in in in
[1:05:53] the ancient world and then coming
[1:05:55] through the enlightenment it took on
[1:05:56] this meaning and you just tring the
[1:05:58] whole word and by the time you get done
[1:06:00] I was I filled up the whole screen I
[1:06:01] said okay everybody got it and
[1:06:03] everybody's like H you're like
[1:06:07] yeah and I said okay never mind let me
[1:06:09] just give you what a prophet said God
[1:06:11] changed
[1:06:14] himself that's it what does it morphe
[1:06:16] mean God changed his mask same God just
[1:06:20] different mask Hallelujah I'm glad I can
[1:06:23] know him like
[1:06:26] that he says we find out that God in the
[1:06:30] beginning was a great Fountain of spirit
[1:06:32] is that right he had no
[1:06:36] birthplace he
[1:06:38] had he had no dying place he had no
[1:06:42] beginning of days now he's talking about
[1:06:44] MDC he had no D he had no birth place he
[1:06:47] had no dying place he had no beginning
[1:06:49] of days he had no ending of years he was
[1:06:54] just as Eternal as eternity is
[1:06:57] eternal he never was born he never did
[1:07:03] die and this is why I was showing you
[1:07:05] Wednesday night that the order of mzc
[1:07:08] because in the new birth that's what the
[1:07:09] order you're called into yeah that's
[1:07:12] what the the the the atonement of Christ
[1:07:14] does for you it brings you into the same
[1:07:16] or it makes you like madc see and this
[1:07:20] was so important what we were saying
[1:07:21] from Wednesday night's service because
[1:07:24] the fact that he had no beginning or he
[1:07:26] had no ending so then your life from its
[1:07:30] maybe it might have been a horrible
[1:07:31] beginning and it might have a terrible
[1:07:34] ending but but none of that matters it's
[1:07:36] all covered in the sacrifice of Christ
[1:07:40] because you're in the order of MDC so
[1:07:42] however you start it however you finish
[1:07:44] you say yeah but but what about you know
[1:07:46] what about everything in in the middle
[1:07:49] part the beauty of that is he abideth a
[1:07:52] priest continually
[1:07:54] there is a Perpetual
[1:07:57] atonement a Perpetual satisfaction
[1:08:00] before I can even have a transgression
[1:08:02] he's already
[1:08:05] confessing Hallelujah that ought to make
[1:08:08] us rejoice in this sick broken Dying
[1:08:11] World we have a right to
[1:08:14] Rejoice I'm in the order of
[1:08:16] MDC he had no beginning he had no ending
[1:08:20] so nothing in my beginning or my ending
[1:08:22] or anywhere in the middle count against
[1:08:24] me
[1:08:27] Hallelujah you know there was a sister
[1:08:29] Dalton who was concerned about her
[1:08:31] illegitimate birth she had been very
[1:08:33] concerned about it and she wrote to a
[1:08:36] friend who you know who who took it you
[1:08:39] know to brother brandom and he and he
[1:08:41] wrote back and sister Rebecca Smith
[1:08:43] published it in her only believe
[1:08:44] magazine
[1:08:45] I had sister Debbie go through our
[1:08:48] collection I found exactly the very one
[1:08:50] sister Debbie actually found it I
[1:08:51] thought it was pretty hopeless she found
[1:08:53] it in about a minute and that's just the
[1:08:56] advantage of a smarter
[1:08:58] wife and so so I I I tell my my sons and
[1:09:03] grandsons don't ever marry a woman
[1:09:05] smarter than you but I did it myself so
[1:09:07] I can't hardly enforce that so so I I
[1:09:11] find that that that that he he he takes
[1:09:14] this sister you know oh her her case and
[1:09:19] he's he's sitting there and let me see
[1:09:21] if I can uh if I can get it right here
[1:09:24] and and he says he says he says he says
[1:09:27] it like this he says sister Dalton he
[1:09:30] wrote her back a letter and I I started
[1:09:32] to put it on the screen you can actually
[1:09:35] see that's a picture of it that's that's
[1:09:38] handwriting right there and this brother
[1:09:39] Brandon's handwriting and signature down
[1:09:40] at the bottom and so he writes back to
[1:09:43] to his friend sister Dalton sitting here
[1:09:46] alone with brother brandham Ed and Jean
[1:09:49] and I heard him explain about a bastard
[1:09:53] child child that's an illegitimate
[1:09:55] child it was in the Old Testament a type
[1:09:58] of us under grace brother brandham said
[1:10:01] that we are all bastard children and are
[1:10:04] brought to God by Christ so get off your
[1:10:07] high
[1:10:08] horse come
[1:10:10] on
[1:10:12] Amen you know but for
[1:10:15] God we just we have no
[1:10:18] chance
[1:10:19] see we are all bastard children and are
[1:10:22] brought to God by Christ we must be
[1:10:26] rebred by the truth and being born again
[1:10:30] our Being Born Again In Christ changes
[1:10:34] everything it changes us from
[1:10:37] illegitimate to legitimate Sons and
[1:10:39] Daughters of God Amen in Adam we were of
[1:10:43] hybrid birth in Christ we are of the
[1:10:46] true
[1:10:47] birth and brother brandham writes down
[1:10:50] at the bottom in his own hand do not
[1:10:52] fear sister do
[1:10:54] your new birth or anyone's New Birth
[1:10:58] corrects it
[1:11:00] all
[1:11:02] Hallelujah it corrects it all in the
[1:11:05] order of mzc I stand perfect before God
[1:11:09] and I and I just say to I I say to
[1:11:12] friends and family and acquaintances who
[1:11:14] could not want
[1:11:17] that your new birth or anybody's New
[1:11:21] Birth corrects it all
[1:11:24] I mean here brother Bram is literally
[1:11:26] explaining that that th that this
[1:11:29] illegitimate birth literally that no
[1:11:31] matter no matter what has befallen you
[1:11:34] as children of God once you're sealed
[1:11:36] into the kingdom of God and the blood
[1:11:38] speaks for you Amen brother BR said God
[1:11:41] can't even see my sin he said Jesus died
[1:11:43] for me the blood speaks for me see and
[1:11:47] he and and so he said it literally
[1:11:49] reverses all of our sin condition from
[1:11:52] birth to death
[1:11:54] you know Ruth was found gleaning in the
[1:11:59] field Ruth is a perfect type for us here
[1:12:01] at the end time because that's why
[1:12:02] brother brandham in the breach at when
[1:12:04] he's preaching in the seals he preaches
[1:12:06] God in Simplicity and then he preaches
[1:12:08] on the breach and there's where he picks
[1:12:10] up Ruth and Boaz Boaz is the goel the
[1:12:14] the the goet the
[1:12:16] Redeemer see he go he he Ste between uh
[1:12:20] Ruth and this this nearer King Kinsman
[1:12:24] cuz Satan is a nearer Kinsman to you
[1:12:27] when you're born in sin he's a near he's
[1:12:30] nearer to you because you're born with a
[1:12:32] fallen nature yes see but but so Boaz
[1:12:35] goes like Christ and says do you want to
[1:12:37] redeem him Satan can't Satan couldn't
[1:12:39] redeem God's family see and so first of
[1:12:42] all he didn't have the money and he
[1:12:43] didn't even have the will he hates
[1:12:45] you don't feel bad he hates his own
[1:12:48] family yeah amen right so he hates
[1:12:51] everybody he's pure hate yeah and so but
[1:12:54] Boaz steps in and says then I'll redeem
[1:12:56] her and he you know he takes his shoe
[1:12:59] off as a as a sign and that was and he
[1:13:01] went to the gate that was the courtroom
[1:13:03] in the East and he he steps out in the
[1:13:06] middle that it's it's you see that all
[1:13:08] through the Bible you see you see Moses
[1:13:11] standing there and here's cor and
[1:13:13] daythan and Moses said whoever's on the
[1:13:15] Lord's Side come to me so Moses now is a
[1:13:18] is a is an intercede he's interceding
[1:13:20] and keeping everybody live alive when
[1:13:22] judgments about to fall amen when Moses
[1:13:25] goes into the pillar of fire walks right
[1:13:27] into it without a blood sacrifice he
[1:13:29] doesn't die because he's a prophet and
[1:13:31] Aaron who would have died if he went in
[1:13:33] that presence without blood except he's
[1:13:35] with Moses and since Moses being a
[1:13:38] prophet the ministry of the son of man
[1:13:40] is a Ministry of atonement so so now
[1:13:42] Aaron can walk right in and out of the
[1:13:44] pillar of fire not die because he's with
[1:13:46] he's got a
[1:13:48] prophet oh friends do you see how
[1:13:51] valuable a prophet a Propet was in our
[1:13:54] day because what does a prophet do he
[1:13:56] doesn't just get you the anointing Benny
[1:13:58] hen can get the anointing he doesn't
[1:14:00] just get you a blessing pay your ti you
[1:14:02] get a blessing but he can actually bring
[1:14:04] you into the
[1:14:06] presence if you come into the presence
[1:14:08] without a bleeding word you die it's
[1:14:12] worse for you to to do that
[1:14:16] see so David did the same thing David
[1:14:19] you know he here's Israel and here's the
[1:14:22] Philistines and here's the devil here's
[1:14:24] Goliath and David steps he's he steps in
[1:14:27] between now he's the man in the middle
[1:14:30] he's in between Israel he's there it's
[1:14:32] just Christ all through the scripture so
[1:14:34] so we find that Ruth is gleaning in the
[1:14:36] field she's a perfect type of the
[1:14:38] Gentile bride you and I Naomi is the
[1:14:41] type of the old church the Old Testament
[1:14:43] Church Boaz is a type of Christ and he
[1:14:47] finds her gleaning in the field and
[1:14:49] another word for gleaning in Websters is
[1:14:51] the word calling now calling is
[1:14:54] typically used to describe the process
[1:14:57] of selecting and removing inferior
[1:15:00] animals or inferior plants from a
[1:15:03] population to do what to improve the
[1:15:05] overall quality so you go into a you go
[1:15:09] into a garden and you call out the weeds
[1:15:11] and you call out anything that's in
[1:15:13] remember Jesus said he tells the parable
[1:15:16] of the landowner and said here's a tree
[1:15:18] and it all it does is encumber the
[1:15:19] ground it uses nutrients and it never
[1:15:21] brings any fruit and all the other trees
[1:15:22] could use it because they're bringing
[1:15:24] forth fruit and the man pleads and says
[1:15:26] let me you know dig about and dung it
[1:15:29] and I'll fertilize it and if if no fruit
[1:15:31] you know next season then fine we'll cut
[1:15:32] it down why should we let it encumber
[1:15:34] the ground so this is just nature you
[1:15:37] understand so so so calling you know
[1:15:41] allows the the you you leave the best so
[1:15:44] that it can be better and you you take
[1:15:46] out that which is which is poor and bad
[1:15:49] so so we find that when Ruth Ruth comes
[1:15:53] that's what she's doing she's she's a
[1:15:55] Gleaner she's she's gleaning in the
[1:15:57] field she's not down picking up uh
[1:16:01] chaff she's down picking up the choice
[1:16:04] leftovers because they were they were
[1:16:06] not allowed the rich men weren't allowed
[1:16:08] to harvest the corners of their fields
[1:16:09] because that that would give the poor
[1:16:11] the poor had the rights of The Gleaners
[1:16:13] they didn't even need permission they
[1:16:14] could come into the field and go into
[1:16:16] the corners and glean and and so so we
[1:16:19] find that that you know Jesus talks
[1:16:22] about about that in Matthew's gospel
[1:16:24] I'll send my angels and they'll separate
[1:16:26] the good from the bad remember that see
[1:16:29] and and we talk about how that he will
[1:16:32] he will you know the the wheat shall go
[1:16:34] to the barn and the chaff shall be blown
[1:16:37] away and be burned with in unquenchable
[1:16:39] fire so this is the process of nature so
[1:16:43] this is what this is what God is doing
[1:16:45] God is going down through the Earth and
[1:16:47] he's gleaning he's calling he's he's
[1:16:50] taking your life and he's getting rid of
[1:16:52] all the broken stuff oh Hallelujah and
[1:16:56] he's only leaving you with what's
[1:16:58] good he took away all my doubt and all
[1:17:01] my fear and all my sin took away all my
[1:17:03] evil desires I now have no more
[1:17:06] conscience of sin I don't want sin I
[1:17:08] hate sin I don't desire it I want
[1:17:12] righteousness amen that's what he did
[1:17:14] for Ruth and and he comes to Ruth in
[1:17:17] Chapter 2 and watch this now then she
[1:17:21] because Boaz comes to her in the the
[1:17:23] second chapter and says my
[1:17:24] daughter stay right here in my Fields
[1:17:27] where right where I found you stay right
[1:17:30] here don't go into another field I'll
[1:17:32] feed you I'll protect you I I've told
[1:17:35] the young men don't lay a hand on you
[1:17:37] and and and I've got all this Authority
[1:17:39] and power and I I will'll see that you
[1:17:41] get rede Redemption and Ruth falls on
[1:17:44] her face much like we did when Christ
[1:17:46] began to tell us how much he loved
[1:17:49] us it didn't matter how we were born it
[1:17:53] didn't matter what we went through it
[1:17:56] didn't matter that we had broken lives
[1:17:58] as children you think Ruth didn't she's
[1:18:00] a heathen moabit Heathen loses her
[1:18:03] husband as a young Widow and and when he
[1:18:07] he's beginning to express all of this
[1:18:09] love to her she's a foreigner she's not
[1:18:11] even a
[1:18:12] Jew of all he's Rich of all the people
[1:18:16] of all the maidens he could have went
[1:18:17] after he goes after this one broken
[1:18:20] widowed moabit yeah
[1:18:23] amen and she fell on her face and bowed
[1:18:27] herself to the ground I can see myself
[1:18:30] there yes and said unto
[1:18:33] him why have I found Grace in thine eyes
[1:18:39] that thou should us take knowledge of me
[1:18:42] of me seeing I'm a stranger do you
[1:18:47] understand I'm I'm a I came I was a
[1:18:49] heathen you do know that right you don't
[1:18:52] know no I got almost nothing I can offer
[1:18:54] you I'm a broken
[1:18:57] Widow and Boaz answered and said unto
[1:19:01] her it hath fully been showed me amen
[1:19:05] all that thou has
[1:19:07] done oh he said that to me friends I
[1:19:11] said Lord I'm no good he said I know
[1:19:13] everything you've ever done it doesn't
[1:19:15] matter I know about your life I know
[1:19:17] what you went through I still want you
[1:19:20] me you want me yes I want you stay right
[1:19:23] here in my field don't go
[1:19:26] anywhere oh friends that's the love of
[1:19:29] God I know the world is broken but God
[1:19:32] loves
[1:19:34] you and and then he goes down a list
[1:19:38] here's now watch
[1:19:39] this here's some
[1:19:42] beauty because when he starts
[1:19:45] naming why he's being kind to
[1:19:49] her just like Abraham
[1:19:54] who we know that Abraham committed all
[1:19:57] kinds of transgressions yeah got caught
[1:20:00] lying and cheating yeah
[1:20:03] twice backslid yeah left the promised
[1:20:07] land brother Ram said anytime a Jew
[1:20:08] leaves promis on his
[1:20:10] backslid gets down there lying
[1:20:13] conniving he loses his he you know he he
[1:20:16] he he's worried about his own hide but
[1:20:19] but remember that when when Paul tells
[1:20:21] the story none of that's none of that's
[1:20:24] mentioned anymore am it's like it
[1:20:26] doesn't even exist like it was like it
[1:20:28] was never part of the record right see
[1:20:31] because what Paul gets credit for is the
[1:20:34] one good thing and that is he never
[1:20:37] staggered at the
[1:20:38] promise he had all kinds of fleshly
[1:20:41] failures but none of that counted after
[1:20:45] Calvary the only thing that counted was
[1:20:48] his faith in the word of the
[1:20:51] hour and when he names it to Ruth he
[1:20:55] says here's here's where you here's
[1:20:58] where you've done good you you were good
[1:21:01] to your mother-in-law since the death of
[1:21:03] thine husband and how thou Hast left thy
[1:21:06] father and has left thy mother and left
[1:21:10] the land of thy Nativity and art come
[1:21:13] unto a people which thou knewest not
[1:21:15] here to before the only thing he names
[1:21:18] is her good
[1:21:19] stuff you think she didn't have problems
[1:21:22] you think think Ru you think Ruth hadn't
[1:21:24] had a slip or two you think Ruth you
[1:21:26] think Ruth was like some you know some
[1:21:29] perfect Virgin Mary type of girl she was
[1:21:31] a heathen but none of that counted and
[1:21:35] when he enumerated she said why do you
[1:21:37] care about me he said because you're
[1:21:39] this and you're that and you're this and
[1:21:40] you're that and it was all good I'm here
[1:21:43] to tell you he only sees the good all
[1:21:46] the old is gone you're a brand new
[1:21:49] creation in Christ amen
[1:21:53] it's a powerful image that conveys the
[1:21:57] transformative power of Jesus's
[1:22:00] sacrifice and the hope it offers to
[1:22:03] those who seek his forgiveness I hope
[1:22:05] you'll seek it today if you don't know
[1:22:07] it he's only regarding I'm here to tell
[1:22:10] you today he's ready to forget every
[1:22:13] mistake you've ever made and when he's
[1:22:16] done with you only the good of you will
[1:22:21] remain see
[1:22:23] and and we're not talking
[1:22:25] about necessarily I'm not limiting it to
[1:22:29] and in fact as by comparison it pales
[1:22:32] we're not talking about good in this
[1:22:34] life all your good deeds because your
[1:22:35] best Good Deeds are still filthiness to
[1:22:38] him you understand so we're not talking
[1:22:41] about necessarily you know the things
[1:22:43] you might say well I've done this good
[1:22:44] and I've done that good there's none
[1:22:46] good no not one I'm talking about your
[1:22:48] existence when you were in him and it's
[1:22:51] not just good if it's
[1:22:53] perfect and that's what he's willing to
[1:22:56] look at you as as perfect the Rapture
[1:22:59] you understand friends that the Rapture
[1:23:02] is the final
[1:23:04] gleaning It's the final gleaning of
[1:23:08] 2,000 years so that in the resurrection
[1:23:12] you know he gives you a a final calling
[1:23:15] on Resurrection morning you looking
[1:23:17] forward to it on Resurrection morning he
[1:23:21] gives you a final calling that leaves
[1:23:24] only the remaining parts of you that was
[1:23:27] in him from the
[1:23:30] beginning even this old body is changed
[1:23:35] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:23:38] the real you the real you on that
[1:23:40] morning friends you're going to be so
[1:23:42] happy with the real you and can I say to
[1:23:46] you today that that's really been the
[1:23:48] real you all along and I know you
[1:23:51] haven't felt that way but that that's
[1:23:52] how God has looked at you you're going
[1:23:55] to be on Resurrection morning the real
[1:23:57] you that he always saw you
[1:23:59] as Hallelujah it connects us to our
[1:24:02] origin and it connects us to our
[1:24:05] destination back into eternity before I
[1:24:09] ever made a mistake before I ever came
[1:24:11] into this life and I stand glorified in
[1:24:16] his presence it positions me now I'm
[1:24:18] going to close with this
[1:24:20] amen it positions me
