[Music] you is this on this is on right your your applause covered the sound of my own voice okay so as usual there parts of the skit where we like to interact because everyone is so nervous up here and I my knees are shaking it's very hard to be up here so there's a few parts where like um you'll kind of see maybe cues from me or some of the people on stage where it'd be great if you joined in we like to hear you know laughter and things like that not at us but with us so if you see anything like that join in one thing if you would like to applaud that's fine but long extended applauds tend to um because we're doing some voice recordings so if it if your applause lasts too long then does that make sense am I can you read my mind without me having to explain the rest of this okay so we're ready to start just remember what I said about interacting and I hope you all enjoy this this skit is about how Jehovah through the ages of time was different to different people but was the same God to all and that the the different people through the Bible experience different things but we saved by the same God as are each of you so I hope you enjoy [Applause] it it is true we love everybody if God loved the sinner loved you a sinner as Paul says as such were some of you and he said don't you know that the perverse w't inherit the kingdom of God don't you know that those who are in sexual immorality and homosexuality will not inherit the kingdom of God and then you go a little bit further than that and Paul says of such were some of you but you he hath washed and he has cleaned I'm thankful for the grace of God how can I have Grace on somebody because God's given me so much grace and I may never know what it's like to experience listen my experience on the other side when I get to heaven my experience will be totally different from yours because God didn't call me to walk down the trail that he called me to walk down and I can't walk down your path and when I get there on that day I'm going to have a different story you're going to have a different story than me Abraham Isaac Jacob Jo all the prophets they trusted and believed that there was coming a resurrection that the Redeemer was coming they prophesied of him Enoch prophesied of him rested solemnly sealed his testimony with it Isaac Jacob Daniel Jeremiah Ezekiel they rested solemly upon the time that the Messiah would come and they died and their souls went into Paradise they could not go in the presence of God because the blood of bulls and goats could not forgive sins it only covered sins speaking of the day when the perfect sacrifice caus the blood of the animal could not come back to the worshipper for then he would have not ceased to offer sacrifices of that time but when the Son of God died the life that was in him with none other but God to come back and adopt us into the family of God and now we are children of God ah a new arrival welcome my brother where am I this is Paradise all who have followed the great and Holy One are sent here after they die great and holy one I'm not sure if I've ever followed anyone holy where is he I want to see him surely you must know of God you could not have been here otherwise we have all lived Our Lives unified with the Great I Am he is not a person you can see but if you've met him you would know how can I meet someone I can't even see we've all met him through different ways some of us through a pillar of fire or a cloud or a burning bush or even a still small voice but there's definitely no denying an encounter with the Lord I've never seen any of those things I'm sure our brother has not come by any way of deception the ways of our God are mysterious and perfect he would know the answer to how this man has come to be here Abraham why don't you and our new friend come and sit maybe we can tell more of Jehovah and he'll remember a time he made a choice to serve him wait you're Abraham as in like Father Abraham yeah but how do you know of me and not of God I went to public school this is going to be harder than I thought [Music] [Applause] about 2,000 years ago I was living with my wife in the land of Heron when one day God spoke to me and said I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee and in thee All Families shall be blessed there were a few obstacles Not only was I 75 years old when God spoke to me but Sarai was Barren she had never been able to Bear a child how could I become a great nation if we could never have a child it seemed impossible but finally after 25 years of waiting we saw God's promise come to pass the child we so longed for was finally born to us our precious son restored joy into our hearts and we named him Isaac then one day God spoke to me again take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell you of with a broken heart I saddled my donkey and took Isaac up to the place God told me I was afraid and sad but knew I must obey the great one who had given me my son my father behold the fire and the wood but where is the Lamb for a burnt offering my son God will provide himself a lamb my heart achd and my hands trembled but I kept the faith in God's promises that he would make my Offspring a great nation I knew he could raise my son From the Ashes if that's what it took before I could strike my son the angel of the Lord called out from above Abraham here I am lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that you fear God see and thou has not withheld thine only son son from [Laughter] me father I see a ram caught in the thicket by its horns the great Jehovah Gyra provided me with a son in my old age then he provided a ram to save my son he provided me with faith that I needed to pass the greatest test of my entire life [Applause] so you're telling me you took that innocent RAM and killed it surely you've heard of sacrifices to God yeah but I've never actually done them how are your sins covered if not for the innocent blood of bulls and goats I don't know but trust me there were a lot of sins this is very curious for in order for you to be here your sins must have been covered perhaps like our friend job here your parents have offered sin offerings in your behalf yeah even brother Enoch had to offer sacrifices and he was so close to God he was raptured raptured yes I will tell you the story of how finally taken from an evil civilization that despised me and my [Applause] God [Music] about 430 years before Abraham was even born I walked the Earth it was the most evil of times it seemed like there was nobody left on Earth that worshiped Jehovah I still performed the sacrifices of Jehovah While others followed pagan Gods I had no fellowship with like-minded Believers so I became even closer to the only one I could turn to look at Enoch freak H Rollero zah oh freak idiot your beliefs are not inclusive for 365 years I lived in these sinful conditions day after day I only found peace by walking with my God I didn't know that God would soon see fit to destroy the Earth in a great flood but he had other plans for me one day I was on a walk talking with the Lord like usual suddenly I felt a funny little feeling then I was here I never suffered the pain of death and the great Jehovah Shalom was my peace in the midst of great evil and ridicule and even greater was the peace I felt when I finally Rose above it all wo I never knew peace on Earth always lived in fear that I would end up dying and going to the Eternal void or something but the great Giver of Peace did not see fit to send you to the regions of the Lost we all feel Unworthy of this blessing how can you feel unworthy you were literally perfect nobody is perfect and we've all fought through many battles and temptations that is true brother Enoch why my life on Earth was nothing to be proud of I spent the first half of my life in sin in debauchery Rahab at least you want a backslider like me I think give more chances than anyone here I seriously doubt that let's tell you our stories and you can decide for yourself [Music] I wasn't born a Hebrew I was a canite living in the city of Jericho nearly 1,400 years ago my house was a part of the Great Wall surrounding the city I made my living the only way I knew how I was a harlot I prayed upon Travelers coming into the city and I was very successful until one day rumors had begun to spread of the Israelite Army and how their God was with them in battle everywhere they went they left a path of conquered enemies in their wake I had never known a God to actually dwell among his worshippers this particular day two strange men came into the city I was immediately ashamed of the way I was living I could tell tell these men were different than the other Travelers of Canaan I offered them a place to stay with me and my family not long after it became obvious that these men were Hebrew spies sent to search out the land the wicked king of Jericho sent word to me that he wanted me to deliver the men to him I knew I could never betray these men or their God and the only way to save my family was to ask this God to abide with me as he did with the Hebrews [Music] when the men searching for them had left to search outside the city I spoke with them I know the Lord has given you this land and all the inhabitants of the land fear you we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you and how you utterly destroyed the two kings of the amorites the Lord your God is God in heaven and in Earth I beg you swear to me by the Lord since I have shown you kindness that you will also show kindness unto my father's house that you will save alive all of my family and our possessions and Deliver us from death our life for yours if you tell no one of our business here when the Lord gives us this land we will deal kindly and honestly with you so I lowered them down from the wall by a scarlet cord and advised them to hide in the mountains until their pursuers returned when we return leave this Scarlet rope hanging from the window whoever is within your home will be spared I gathered my family and explained everything to them I told them of the god of Israel and how we could all be saved from the dreaded Hebrew Army I spent many hours in prayer to God and I knew beyond all doubt that he was with me and my family in our home I left the Scarlet rope hanging from my roof and when the Israelites arrived at the city I had nothing left to do but trust in the great Presence of Jehovah sha that now filled our home for 6 days the Israelites marched once per day around the city at first it was quite unsettling to all inside the city but after a few days they became a laughing stock my family stayed soberly in our home certain that God's plan was in motion on the seventh day they marched around the wall seven times now shout for the Lord has given you the city and all in the city shall be accursed only Rahab the Harlot shall live she and all that are with her in her house [Applause] y [Music] [Applause] W the walls to the city fell that day only one portion of the wall was Spar it was the house in the wall that Jehovah sha filled with his presence to preserve a lowly Gentile Harlot and her family the Hebrews accepted us into their nation and I married a good man of the tribe of Judah my great great grandson was the renowned King David God was truly with me from that time on and through the rest of my days [Applause] a thousand years ago my parents lived in the city of zor they had no children because my mother was Barren Israel lived in the backsliding condition in those days because of this the Lord had allowed them to live in the Captivity of the Philistines one day an angel came to my mother and promised that she would bear a son he commanded that she would not drink any wine or eat any unclean thing because when I was born I was to be a nazare unto God from the womb this also meant that I would never lay a razor to my head to cut my hair from a young age I felt the spirit of God moving on me God had designed me for a purpose to deliver his people from the hand of the Philistines I may not have looked like much not exactly the most ripped guy in the world but God had gave me a supernatural strength that would come over me in times of great need once I K with my bare hands then I killed 30 Philistines after I defeated them in a battle of wits so then I caught 300 foxes and then set them on fire in the Philistines corn fields they were not happy about that the feud was on the Philistines burn burned down my father-in-law's house while my wife was in it so I smoked them after that 3,000 Philistines came up to Judah to bind and kill [Music] me yes the spirit of God was with me and he fought through me many times I only had one weakness oh [Music] Samson I never could figure out how to resist him ation even after everything God had done for me I went looking for love in all the wrong places once I was in Gaza um doing things I was not proud of and the Philistines locked me in the city I was forced to rip off the 8,000lb gates hinges and all I carried them all the way down to Hein which was about 37 M away You' think I would have learned my lesson but no the Philistines had caught on to my weakness and they hired a woman to trick me night after night she begged me to tell her the secret to my Powers at first I thought it was just a joke and I made up a whole bunch of stuff just to get her off my back but then Samson you like don't even love me if you really did you would not lie to me all the time all you ever do is lie and lie like how am I supposed to ever trust you again if you won't even tell me the secret to your strength you are just making fun of me so you can laugh at me behind my back with all your little group of friends don't even act like you aren't Samson you are such a player Samson why are you always playing me fine I'll just tell you golly woman so I told her my secret and what do you think she did she shaved my head while I was sleeping then she sold me out to the Philistines that very night with my Nazarite vow broken my strength was gone they gouged out my eyes and made me grind a millstone in the prison I had a lot of time to think about that precious gift I had wasted why couldn't I just have been as strong spiritually as I was physically if I had been as righteous as my parents had raised me to be I could have delivered my brethren from the hand of the Philistines one day the Philistines had gathered together in a great celebration to their deeon they brought me out as proof of their God's might if only they knew that it was my own sin that had caused my [Applause] downfall oh Lord God please remember me strengthen me just once more let me die with these [Music] Philistines Jehovah sidu was my righteousness that day in my weakness he was strong and in my death I slew more Philistines than in my whole [Applause] life [Applause] [Applause] so you're telling me you just called at God called on God at your death and he accepted you just like that yes but at a great cost it was almost too late for me but I repented in the nick of time thank God you made the right choice brother Samson even so late I know what it feels like to be almost out of time what happened to you well it is not a long story but there was a Great Famine in the town of zarap where I lived my son and I were starving to death we had just enough oil and meal for one more small cake we were going to eat it and then we would die together one day God's Prophet Elijah came by and asked that I make him a cake to eat first there was something different about this man the great Jehovah righ had always been my shepherd and I knew in that moment he was guiding me I ran inside and made him a cake to eat and from that time on the Cru of oil never became dry and the barrel of meal was always full the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want wow I've never heard such a miracle you're telling me it just multiplied right in front of your eyes indeed it did and it saved Our Lives no God can compare to the god of the Israelites my life was given back to me too let me tell you my story [Applause] friend [Applause] m [Music] my name is non about 800 years ago I was the captain of the host of the Syrian Army I was a fierce Warrior and an honorable man God blessed me in battle but something terrible befell me I was a leper I lived in disgrace and suffering because of my condition gross if not for my wife I would have taken my own life one day she came with news to me non the sweet little servant girl you brought for me from the land of Israel has just told me something very interesting she said there is a prophet in Samaria that can recover you from this condition the king of the Syrian Army immediately sent word to the king of Israel that I was coming to obtain my healing the king of Israel rent his garments in fear because he knew he had no power to heal me when the Prophet Elijah heard of the the king's dilemma he sent a servant to meet me go wash yourself in the Jordan seven times and your flesh will be renewed and you will be clean I thought the prophet would come and wave his hands to heal me but he wants me to wash in the Jordan are not the rivers of Damascus cleaner and better than the Jordan Master if the prophet would have asked you to do some great thing wouldn't you have done it and yet how simple it would be to wash and be clean so I went to the Jordan and I dipped myself seven [Applause] [Applause] times when I arose the seventh time my leprosy had disappeared and I was completely healed I knew that day there was no God on Earth but the god of Israel I thank the great Jehovah Rafa for healing me when no other power on Earth could [Applause] these are really great stories but I still don't know how I got here I've never been healed I never bathed in the Jordan River what if there's been a mistake what if I belong with the [Applause] Lost The Great I Am does not make mistakes we all belonged with the lost until our own encounter with the great one and we as children we wait here until he arrives he's coming here yes the great Messiah is coming here and he's going to set us all free one day we're going to leave this Dreamland and enter an eternal rest with him how long will we have to wait he could be here any time he was already born on Earth and when his plan is fulfilled he will come in glory how do you know all these things you've been dead for who knows how long long I met him let me tell you the story of the embodiment of the great Jehovah you have heard so much about I am John I was sent to Earth to forerun the coming of the Messiah I lived most of my life in the wilderness but when I came of age I knew there was work for me to do Jehovah ni my banner gave me the courage to stand up against all the backslidden ways of Israel I began to preach to everyone I could find about repentance and I took them to the river to baptize them one day as I was baptizing there he was I had always known it would be him on Earth he was my cousin Jesus but he was not of My Flesh and Blood I wasn't even I wasn't even worthy to loose his sandals when I saw him that day waiting to be baptized I knew I knew he was the one sent to save the world from their sins in his eyes was every name of Jehovah you have heard today he is The Great I Am and he is is the one to come I think it's time I tell my story I was not a good man on earth I did not know God and nor did I care to know God I was nothing but a thief my crimes they caught up to me I was crucified there were two other men on crosses next to me one was a thief just like me the other one was this this Jesus you mentioned the other Thief he began to mock him he said why don't you just save us all when I looked into the eyes of Jesus I seen this this great one you speak about and at that moment I had hated every evil thing I had ever done I didn't know if you would call Angels carry us down so I asked him will you remember me when you enter your kingdom he said he would but then I died I don't know what happened after that my brother if what you're saying is true your sins were not covered they were [Music]
