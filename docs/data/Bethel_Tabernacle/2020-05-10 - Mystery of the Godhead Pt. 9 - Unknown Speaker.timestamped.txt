[0:01] good morning everyone may the Lord
[0:04] richly bless you so good to see a lot of
[0:08] faces I haven't seen in a long time
[0:10] thankful for each one of you thankful
[0:13] that we're getting closer to all being
[0:14] together again and then let's stand up
[0:17] and we'll pray gracious Heavenly Father
[0:21] we just come to you now Lord and you are
[0:24] the Great and Living God you created all
[0:28] things Lord just by your spoken word
[0:30] Lord and as we look across the world and
[0:35] see Lord the disorder and chaos we can
[0:40] come back and look to you the one who is
[0:43] sovereign over all things Lord and put
[0:45] our faith and confidence that there is a
[0:48] purpose and there's a plan here we know
[0:51] there's an enemy that's battling against
[0:53] us that's seeking to exalt himself and
[0:56] yet Lord we also know that he's already
[1:00] been defeated that even as the scripture
[1:04] said that Jesus Christ made it may -
[1:06] open show of him when he conquered him
[1:10] and Lord we thank you for that we ask
[1:13] that your spirit would move in our
[1:14] hearts that you would speak to us teach
[1:18] us guide us give us revelation and
[1:21] understanding that we might know you
[1:23] more we commit ourselves to you in Jesus
[1:25] name Amen god bless you you can be
[1:29] seated so I this may not be a hundred
[1:35] percent true but I believe that this is
[1:37] probably bringing the Godhead series to
[1:41] a close I kind of feel like as I was
[1:44] studying and going through things that
[1:46] was it was a good place to finish up and
[1:49] and so we're gonna try to get through it
[1:52] just depends on if I go really slow so
[1:55] we're going to look and start with a
[1:59] quote here brother Branham says this
[2:01] we're gonna be looking at the Son of God
[2:04] and then we're gonna be kind of bringing
[2:05] a conclusion of the big picture so the
[2:08] son of God
[2:09] by supernatural birth the Bible said he
[2:12] is the beginning of the
[2:13] creation of God how did he begin in the
[2:17] wombs of a woman that's from the future
[2:19] home sermon where the Branham is looking
[2:24] at the beginning of the creation of God
[2:26] he was that beginning of the creation we
[2:29] are the continuous continuation of that
[2:31] creation Luke 1:35
[2:35] and the angel answered and said unto her
[2:37] the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and
[2:39] the power of the highest shall
[2:41] overshadow thee therefore also that holy
[2:45] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[2:46] be called the Son of God therefore means
[2:50] because of this so here here we see the
[2:55] connection there why is Jesus called the
[2:58] Son of God because he's some second
[3:02] eternal person of the Godhead so he's
[3:06] some pre-existing being no the scripture
[3:09] says he's the son of God
[3:10] because the Holy Ghost over shadowed
[3:13] Mary Psalm 2 verse 7 I will declare the
[3:22] decree the LORD hath said unto me thou
[3:25] art my son this day have I begotten thee
[3:29] this day it doesn't say in eternity this
[3:33] day a day in time in history was when he
[3:38] was begotten not eternally begotten and
[3:40] we we also understand son the words son
[3:44] assumes a beginning you cannot be a son
[3:48] and be eternal it it's a
[3:52] self-contradiction to make a statement
[3:54] like that
[3:56] Matthew 1:18 now the birth of Jesus
[4:00] Christ was on this why's this word there
[4:03] is jeanna oh it's the same place where
[4:06] we where we derive the word Genesis the
[4:09] birth of Jesus Christ that literally
[4:11] meat can be translated as the beginning
[4:13] the start is the beginning of the
[4:16] creation of God the Prophet said when
[4:18] did he begin in the womb of a virgin the
[4:21] birth of Jesus Christ was on this wises
[4:23] Mary Mother Mary was espoused to Joseph
[4:26] before they came to
[4:27] there she was found with child of the
[4:30] Holy Ghost again we'll skip past that
[4:37] first Corinthians 15:45 through 47 thus
[4:44] it is written the first man Adam became
[4:46] a living being the last Adam became a
[4:49] life-giving spirit but it is not the
[4:52] spiritual that is first but the natural
[4:54] and then the spiritual the first man was
[4:58] from the earth a man of dust the second
[5:00] man is from heaven this is reading from
[5:03] the ESV English standard version so Adam
[5:08] became sin he he he brought sin upon all
[5:16] of us the human race and so we were
[5:19] fallen through Adam he was first in
[5:23] sequence Christ by his righteous nature
[5:29] became what is it what does the
[5:31] scripture say that there became a
[5:34] life-giving spirit so by his
[5:37] resurrection his death burial and
[5:40] resurrection he now becomes that
[5:42] life-giving spirit now it's the spirit
[5:45] of his son that brings forth adoption in
[5:48] our lives and so Christ Adam came forth
[5:52] from the dust Christ will return again
[5:56] from heaven Galatians 4 verse 4 but when
[6:03] the fullness of the time was come God
[6:06] sent forth his son made of a woman made
[6:09] under the law so this word made is from
[6:14] the Greek word you know my and it means
[6:16] to cause to be or to come into being or
[6:20] come into existence so the scripture
[6:23] here is saying he came into being from a
[6:26] woman or we say through a woman all
[6:31] right and when did it when did he come
[6:32] to be during the time of the law of
[6:36] Moses he was born under the law again
[6:41] these things
[6:41] I together with what brother branham was
[6:43] teaching us there what was the
[6:45] difference between Jesus and God he said
[6:47] he said this multiple times those the
[6:49] difference between Jesus had a beginning
[6:52] God had no beginning Jesus was the body
[6:55] in the tabernacle God is the spirit from
[7:01] this sermon God's gifts always find
[7:03] their places
[7:04] I love these quotes and I love putting
[7:07] them together because people want to
[7:09] take one and say we like we love this
[7:13] one but then they take the next one and
[7:15] say oh wait that we don't like that one
[7:17] let's dismiss it let's put it together
[7:20] because there's a reality there's a
[7:23] revelation in the there's a Kuenn
[7:26] there's an explanation that comes it
[7:27] brings a revelation of why he says
[7:30] things that seem like they're two
[7:32] different ways they're not because the
[7:34] scripture does the very same thing I'll
[7:35] give an example
[7:36] the scripture says no man has seen God
[7:39] at any time and then it goes even
[7:41] further says nor can see God and then
[7:44] literally when in when in Exodus he came
[7:48] to Moses and he came to the elders and
[7:51] they went and they gathered together and
[7:53] it says and they saw the God of Israel
[7:57] okay well seems like a contradiction to
[8:00] me but it isn't a contradiction there's
[8:02] a explanation which brings forth a
[8:06] revelation scripture always wants to
[8:08] keep us in balance doesn't want it
[8:11] doesn't want us to be flying off on this
[8:14] direction flying on off on this
[8:15] direction there's a balance to the whole
[8:17] picture
[8:18] another example is brother Branham says
[8:20] God God is not like the wind he's not
[8:24] like the air he's a being he dwells in a
[8:27] house another place he says he's a
[8:29] spirit that covers all space and time
[8:31] the scripture does the same thing well
[8:33] there's an explanation there I think
[8:35] we've we've explained some of those
[8:37] things throughout our series on the on
[8:39] the Godhead and I don't want to get
[8:41] caught up in that at the moment but just
[8:43] so you get a picture there so the man
[8:45] this is from God's gift find their
[8:47] places 1963 the man the body was not
[8:51] deity but deity was in the body
[8:55] that's actually quite simple it's quite
[8:59] simple and it's not a quote that we take
[9:01] and dismiss the rest of the quotes so
[9:04] look at harvest time brother Branham
[9:06] says in 1964 dude Jews don't try to
[9:09] claim him as yours he was neither Jew
[9:11] nor Gentile he was God
[9:12] see you are what your blood is seeing of
[9:15] course your flesh and Mary of course
[9:16] Mary didn't have no conception with the
[9:18] Holy Ghost giving her sensation God the
[9:21] Father created a germ or an egg in Mary
[9:24] and a blood cell in her also and it was
[9:26] the blood of God so the man the body was
[9:29] not deity but the body was the blood of
[9:32] God is it to a person that doesn't want
[9:38] to understand and wants to fight the
[9:40] message these are great I gave them
[9:41] great ammunition but for someone who
[9:45] wants to see the scripture in its plain
[9:47] clarity it's a revelation it's a
[9:52] revelation Jesus Christ was the DNA of
[9:55] God so let's let's break it down the
[9:59] Holy Ghost overshadowed Mary and created
[10:02] a little embryo sperm and egg fused
[10:05] together within her womb both of them
[10:08] were created by God one was not Mary's
[10:12] if he would have had Mary's egg he would
[10:14] have been a sinner in the nature like
[10:16] his mother
[10:17] so he'd God directly created within Mary
[10:22] a little man Adam so the first Adam the
[10:28] second Adam the first man
[10:30] the second man the first man was created
[10:32] as a full adult directly by God and he
[10:36] was to be the carrier of the life of God
[10:38] and to bring that life forward to the
[10:41] rest of the human race the same exact
[10:43] principle applies here to Jesus Christ
[10:47] one of them brought sin on the world the
[10:49] other one brought a life-giving spirit
[10:52] upon the world but not only did God
[10:57] create that DNA so that DNA was a
[11:01] perfect image and reflection of him so
[11:06] when Jesus was born he was the
[11:08] exact imprint of God's nature but that
[11:14] body wasn't deity okay but God also
[11:19] placed his very own life within that
[11:22] embryo where does your soul come from
[11:26] God
[11:29] where does your spirit come from the
[11:32] same the same thing but your spirit is
[11:35] not impact the the spirit of Jesus the
[11:39] human spirit of Jesus Christ is not
[11:41] impacted by a fallen nature like yours
[11:45] and mine are his the nature of his
[11:49] spirit was a perfect righteous faultless
[11:53] nature he could not be deceived he could
[11:57] not he could not be trapped into
[11:59] something he was unless and let he was
[12:04] unable to sin against God because of the
[12:08] very nature that he put within him so
[12:09] that was God's own the life that was
[12:12] placed into Jesus Christ so when you're
[12:17] looking at that body when you're looking
[12:19] at that baby when you're looking at that
[12:21] teenager when you're looking at that
[12:22] grown man doing his ministry when you're
[12:25] looking at that man hanging on the cross
[12:27] who are you looking at one perspective
[12:31] you say you're looking at the Son of God
[12:33] another perspective you said you say
[12:35] that's the invisible God right in front
[12:39] of me I'm seeing God hanging on the
[12:43] cross on the other hand we know brother
[12:46] Branham said he couldn't die as God the
[12:49] anointing left him you say it's all
[12:52] muddled and confused no it's perfectly
[12:56] in line with the scripture the scripture
[12:58] does the exact same thing so he had to
[13:02] be born with that nature of sin without
[13:04] the nature of sin that he inherited from
[13:07] Matt Mary and he was that last Adam a
[13:09] direct creation of God in a virgin just
[13:12] as Adam was a direct creation of God
[13:14] from the dust
[13:17] is the holy spirit a third person of the
[13:22] Trinity now this is this is an
[13:25] interesting thing because the the the
[13:29] gentleman the young man at the time that
[13:31] led me to the message struggled with
[13:34] several things that caused him to leave
[13:37] the message one was he couldn't
[13:39] understand the Seventh Seal and two was
[13:42] he started reading in John chapter 14
[13:45] and 15 and 16 and he said the Holy
[13:49] Spirit has to be a separate person from
[13:52] God in Christ and so when you look at
[13:57] these verses you're gonna see that
[13:58] you're gonna see what point he's trying
[14:01] to make but we can't just take those
[14:03] verses and separate it from the rest of
[14:05] the verses in the Bible this is the very
[14:07] thing I warned him about but when you
[14:09] want to believe something and you want
[14:11] to reject something you'll do it so John
[14:15] 14 17 through 18 even the Spirit of
[14:18] Truth whom the world cannot receive
[14:19] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[14:22] him but you know him for he dwelleth
[14:24] with you and shall be in you I will not
[14:28] leave you comfortless I will come to you
[14:32] okay we start there fourth verse 26 but
[14:35] the comforter which is the Holy Ghost
[14:37] whom the father will send in my name he
[14:40] shall teach you all things in brief
[14:41] bring all things to your remembrance
[14:43] whatsoever I have said unto you alright
[14:47] so who is we have the father sending the
[14:52] Holy Ghost then Jesus says I'm sending
[14:55] it and then he says I'm coming to you so
[14:59] which person of the Trinity if there is
[15:01] such a thing is coming is that the
[15:04] second or the third person
[15:06] well now let's go further and let's get
[15:08] even more muddled Matthew 10:24 it is
[15:11] not ye that speak but the Spirit of your
[15:13] father which speaks in you now it's the
[15:16] first person of the Trinity all three
[15:18] persons are coming to dwell in me that's
[15:20] what I'm getting here Galatians 4:6 and
[15:25] because you are sons God has sent forth
[15:27] the spirit of his son into your hearts
[15:31] a father once again a reassertion saw
[15:34] three persons are gonna come dwell in me
[15:36] my goodness so Jesus says I'll come to
[15:41] you in the form of the Holy Ghost the
[15:42] father sends the spirit in the name of
[15:44] Jesus it's the spirit of your father
[15:45] it's the spirit of his son first
[15:49] corinthians 2:11 for what man knoweth
[15:53] the things of man save the spirit of Man
[15:55] which is in him even so the things of
[15:57] God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God
[16:01] so are you a separate person from your
[16:06] spirit no no it's a part of your being
[16:14] the mind of God and the Spirit of God
[16:17] and God himself are all one in the same
[16:22] different aspects of this very same
[16:24] person and Ephesians chapter 4 says
[16:30] there's one God and Father and of all
[16:32] who is above all and through all and in
[16:36] you all and so okay so how do we how do
[16:39] we have Jesus saying the son is going to
[16:41] be in you the father's gonna be in you
[16:43] there's just one spirit there's not two
[16:47] spirits not three spirits but what is it
[16:50] we understand there's a mediator that we
[16:53] have there's an intercessor there's a
[16:56] man that's standing in heaven for you
[16:58] and I in the presence of God and these
[17:01] are representative they're interceding
[17:04] for you and I we understand that but
[17:07] that that that God is so identified in
[17:11] that body that whatever God does that is
[17:16] what he's doing through Jesus Christ so
[17:18] what he's doing in you that's the spirit
[17:21] of his son
[17:21] that's the spirit of Christ and we
[17:24] understand Christ means The Anointed One
[17:27] but it also can mean the anointing and
[17:30] so who's in you Christ in you the hope
[17:33] of glory
[17:35] and so God cannot do anything except for
[17:42] through Jesus Christ
[17:45] the mediator he stands in our place he
[17:47] sees us he works on our behalf he moves
[17:50] through us and it's him not them not two
[17:55] persons but one person you see you got
[17:59] it you you you've got to see the
[18:01] distinctions cuz the Bible gives us
[18:04] distinctions but you got to see the
[18:05] unity because the Bible gives us the
[18:07] unity and if you get those out of
[18:09] balance you'll have two gods over here
[18:11] or you'll be Jesus only over there
[18:16] Father Son and Holy Spirit are revealed
[18:19] in one name we're all familiar but it's
[18:23] it's worth going through the scriptures
[18:25] again I'll do it quickly Matthew 28:19
[18:28] go ye therefore and teach all nations
[18:30] baptizing them in the name of the Father
[18:32] and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost
[18:35] 1st John 5:7 for there are three that
[18:38] bear record in heaven the father the
[18:39] word and the Holy Ghost and these three
[18:41] are one doesn't say there's three
[18:43] persons in one says the three are one
[18:47] acts 2:38 then Peter said unto them
[18:51] repent and be baptized every one of you
[18:53] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[18:54] remission of sins and you shall receive
[18:57] the gift of the Holy Ghost there's one
[18:59] name of God that's the Lord Jesus Christ
[19:04] and when you're talking about the name
[19:08] of God you're not just talking about a
[19:10] name a word letters on pages the name is
[19:14] speaking of the very person and presence
[19:16] of God all of his attributes all that he
[19:21] is is bottled up into that name acts 816
[19:28] for as yet he was fallen upon none of
[19:30] them only they were baptized in the name
[19:33] of the Lord Jesus acts 19 verse 5 when
[19:37] they heard this they were baptized in
[19:39] the name of the Lord Jesus John 5:43 I'm
[19:44] coming my father's name and he received
[19:47] me not if another shall come in his own
[19:48] name him you will receive John 14:26 but
[19:53] the comforter which is the Holy Ghost
[19:54] whom the father will send in my name he
[19:56] shall teach you all things and bring all
[19:58] things do you remember its whatsoever I
[20:00] have said unto you acts 4 10 through 12
[20:04] be it known unto you all and to all the
[20:06] people of Israel that by the name of
[20:08] Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you
[20:10] crucified whom God raised from the dead
[20:12] even by him that this man stand before
[20:15] you whole this is the stone which was
[20:17] set at nought of you builders which has
[20:19] become the head of the corner neither is
[20:21] there salvation in any other for there
[20:23] is none other name under heaven given
[20:25] among men whereby we must be saved it's
[20:30] that one name the name of the Lord Jesus
[20:32] Christ I want you to look at Isaiah 9:6
[20:38] this is a prophecy of the very same
[20:40] thing for unto us a child is born unto
[20:44] us a son is given so he's a child he's a
[20:48] son and the government shall be upon his
[20:51] shoulders and his name shall be called
[20:54] wonderful counsellor the mighty God the
[20:57] everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[21:00] what did Jesus say I am come in my
[21:03] father's name so what what is it
[21:07] he's completely the the the visible
[21:12] identification of Almighty God when
[21:16] you're looking at him you're looking at
[21:18] the Father but we don't understand that
[21:21] into Jesus only since he's not his own
[21:24] father but when you're looking at him he
[21:26] is the invisible father made visible
[21:30] before us jesus said it's not me that
[21:33] does the works it's my father that
[21:35] dwelleth in me he does the works and you
[21:39] know read through on your own read
[21:41] through John chapter 17 you'll see the
[21:44] importance of the name Jesus said I have
[21:48] manifested your name think about that
[21:52] for a minute when you manifest the name
[21:55] of Almighty God what are you doing
[21:57] you're you're making him visible so
[22:03] think about that God was manifest in the
[22:07] flesh Jesus didn't go around say in in
[22:11] my father's name
[22:13] be healed in this he just did it why
[22:17] because he was the father's name he's
[22:21] the perfect reflection of his father
[22:23] John 1:14 and the Word was made or
[22:26] became flesh and dwelt or tabernacled
[22:29] among us and we beheld his glory the
[22:32] glory as of the only begotten of the
[22:34] Father full of grace and truth
[22:37] we're gonna give a little summary and
[22:41] then I'm gonna finish with several
[22:42] quotes from brother Branham that I think
[22:44] are marvelous summaries so God is a
[22:48] spirit the invisible father the man
[22:52] Christ Jesus the visible son if I look
[22:55] in the mirror the image in the mirror is
[22:59] not me
[23:01] and yet that image is the perfect
[23:03] reflection of me the one true and living
[23:09] immortal invisible omniscient omnipotent
[23:11] and omnipresent God is revealed
[23:13] perfectly in his own son our Lord and
[23:18] Savior Jesus Christ it's not two persons
[23:21] it's one person we have the manhood of
[23:25] Christ and the deity of Christ brother
[23:31] Branham says in the sermon blind
[23:32] Bartimaeus I believe that Jesus Christ
[23:35] is the son of Jehovah God I lost
[23:38] sometimes brother Branham does this and
[23:40] he puts it just in such a paragraph and
[23:43] it's like did he just put the majority
[23:46] of the doctrine all just in one
[23:48] paragraph this is incredible I believe
[23:51] that Jesus Christ is the son of Jehovah
[23:53] God that God overshadowed Mary created a
[23:55] blood cell in her and she brought forth
[23:57] the son Christ Jesus God came and dwelt
[24:00] in this body reconciling the world to
[24:02] himself I believe that this Jesus is the
[24:04] son of Jehovah God and then in the
[24:06] sermon Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[24:07] today and forever 1955 and the day that
[24:11] when John baptized him God have
[24:13] indicated him God spoke from the heavens
[24:15] John saw him coming in the form of a
[24:17] dove and said this is my beloved Son in
[24:19] whom I'm pleased to dwell the right
[24:22] translation there is in whom I'm pleased
[24:23] to dwell in Jesus immediate
[24:26] anointed with God he was just a man till
[24:28] that time but now he becomes the god man
[24:34] from things that are to be now Jesus is
[24:38] here speaking about he's gone ahead to
[24:41] prepare a place for us let not your
[24:43] heart be troubled now he was talking to
[24:46] Jews now you believed in God believe
[24:48] also in me
[24:49] as you believed in God believe in me
[24:51] because I'm the son of God see and God
[24:54] other words I and my father are one
[24:56] my father dwelling in me and what you
[24:59] see do I'm doing it's not me it's my
[25:02] father that dwelleth in me he doeth the
[25:05] works God was in Christ reconciling the
[25:08] world to himself it was easy for those
[25:10] Jews who had been taught through
[25:12] generations to believe that there was a
[25:14] great supernatural God but to think that
[25:17] that God had come down and was
[25:19] manifesting himself through the person
[25:21] of his son Jesus Christ God tabernacled
[25:25] in a body of flesh flesh that was a
[25:27] little too much for them to understand I
[25:30] think that's a beautiful way to close
[25:33] brother Branham puts it in such a
[25:35] brilliant way there and we'll just stand
[25:37] and dismiss and we'll leave it at that
[25:44] gracious Heavenly Father there's really
[25:50] there's no adequate human words to
[25:54] explain and encapsulate these things
[25:58] Lord we we know that it's a revelation
[26:00] to each and every heart of who you are
[26:03] it's not just a grouping of doctrines or
[26:07] ideas that were following and trying to
[26:11] lay out but Lord it's there's a truth
[26:13] that has been manifested in this day
[26:19] through a prophet to us we've we've seen
[26:24] I think of that ceremony preached I've
[26:28] heard of the by the hearing of the ear
[26:30] but now I see thee and how he went
[26:32] through the the line it went through the
[26:35] church and began to tell people their
[26:37] names where they were from
[26:40] tell them tell them what they're praying
[26:42] about in their secret places and then he
[26:45] spoke the words I've heard of you by the
[26:48] hearing of the ear but now I see the
[26:51] Lord I think that's the point of oh hi
[26:54] you're straightening out all these all
[26:56] these doctrines is that you want us to
[26:58] see you clearly in this day present
[27:02] tense of how you're revealing and
[27:04] manifesting yourself Lord in a many
[27:07] membered bride Lord we just give thanks
[27:11] for that we asked Lord hiding us
[27:12] teaching us leading us Lord I I pray
[27:15] Lord that this these things would cause
[27:17] each one of them we want to continue
[27:20] Lord with you on this journey that we
[27:24] have together father we just commit
[27:26] ourselves to you commit the service to
[27:28] you Lord we ask that you be lifted up
[27:30] and glorified through the name of Jesus
[27:32] Christ amen
