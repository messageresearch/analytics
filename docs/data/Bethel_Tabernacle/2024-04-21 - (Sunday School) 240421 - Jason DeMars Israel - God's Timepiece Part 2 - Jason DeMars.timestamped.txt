[0:01] uh Israel God's time
[0:03] piece and uh the last time as we talked
[0:07] about how God had promised that he would
[0:10] bring Israel a second time uh back into
[0:15] the land that he has promised and that
[0:17] there is a number of promises that go
[0:20] along with that and that's going to be
[0:23] what we look at in future times this
[0:25] time I want to go through Romans 9
[0:29] through 11 as much as I possibly can get
[0:32] through this time in order to show what
[0:36] God's purpose is for Israel see um
[0:39] through her church history you know
[0:41] sometimes we take things for granted
[0:43] through church
[0:44] history um the Catholic Church the
[0:47] Orthodox Church even some uh Old Line
[0:52] Protestants believe that the church
[0:55] actually replaces Israel in God's
[0:59] program God turned from Israel and now
[1:02] went to the Gentiles meaning he will
[1:05] never return back to Israel that's the
[1:08] Viewpoint of of historically of
[1:13] Catholics Orthodox lutherans
[1:16] Presbyterians that we are living in a uh
[1:20] some sort of Millennium
[1:22] now and this Millennium everything is
[1:26] spiritualized and the purpose of the
[1:28] church is to christianize the world
[1:30] and once the church fully christianized
[1:32] all the nations as in even their
[1:35] governments then Christ will return and
[1:38] set up the new Heaven and the new Earth
[1:39] so this is so sort of
[1:42] um the idea that many of the churches
[1:46] it's it's part of the falling away and
[1:48] so God purposed to
[1:51] restore the church back to the original
[1:53] faith and as we as we read as we read
[1:56] last time in the scriptures and as we'll
[1:57] see Paul speaking is that God turns away
[2:01] from Israel he blinds them so that he
[2:04] can turn to deal with the Gentile bride
[2:07] yes of course there's still Jews that
[2:10] come to Faith get the baptism of the
[2:12] Holy Ghost and you know will be raised
[2:16] up and raptured and so forth Absol
[2:20] absolutely but it's just a small Remnant
[2:23] God will turn again to deal with Israel
[2:27] as soon as the Gentile bride is out of
[2:30] the
[2:31] way so obviously as we start this Romans
[2:34] N9 Paul is coming with the understanding
[2:37] that the Jews have rejected
[2:40] Christ as we as we as you read through
[2:42] the book of Acts we know that thousands
[2:44] became
[2:46] Christians but even within that they
[2:50] they were so dedicated to the law that
[2:53] they would hardly leave the Gentiles
[2:55] alone just to receive the Holy Ghost and
[2:57] walk in the spirit they wanted many of
[3:00] those Jewish Christians quote unquote as
[3:03] we call them that turned to Christ and
[3:05] that were in the church in Jerusalem
[3:07] wanted to
[3:08] force Judaism the the observance of the
[3:12] law on the
[3:16] Gentiles and we understand we know that
[3:19] that God sent Paul and Barnabas to the
[3:24] Gentiles he never sent them with a
[3:25] message to convert to
[3:28] Moses he sent them with the message of
[3:30] faith in Christ that they were to be be
[3:34] the CH become the children of Abraham
[3:37] who is justified by faith not by The
[3:39] Works of the law and so again there was
[3:42] that battle of the Jews against the
[3:44] truth even though they came they came in
[3:47] to the church brother brother brother
[3:51] Paul the Apostle Paul calls them
[3:54] Brethren who have come out snuck into
[3:57] the church unawares that they've come in
[4:00] to spy out our Liberty in Christ and so
[4:06] it's hard for an Israeli to move away
[4:10] from the law and to come into Christ
[4:13] they always want to be under the law and
[4:17] they've remained this way even if we
[4:19] look at history 70 AD 70 AD is when
[4:24] Judaism when the Jewish religion Ended
[4:27] as we know it there's no
[4:32] more there's no one on the earth who's
[4:35] following the Torah anymore you say yes
[4:37] the Jews are where's their Temple where
[4:41] is the levitical sacrifices they're not
[4:44] what they have done is in in response to
[4:46] the Gospel of Jesus Christ they have
[4:48] created their own version of religion
[4:52] that they've been cast out of the
[4:55] land that's what happened when Paul is
[4:57] writing in Romans this is before the
[5:00] temple was over when Paul writes the
[5:02] book of Hebrews this was before the
[5:04] temple was destroyed so Temple worship
[5:06] was still going on but 70 AD was
[5:08] prophesied by the Lord Jesus Christ that
[5:11] they would be carried out out of the
[5:15] land why because they rejected the
[5:17] Messiah all right so that's where we
[5:19] pick up Romans
[5:21] 9:1 I say the truth in Christ I lie not
[5:25] by conscience also bearing me witness in
[5:28] the Holy Ghost that I have great
[5:30] heaviness and cons continual sorrow in
[5:33] my heart for I could wish that myself
[5:36] were a cursed from Christ for my
[5:39] brethren my Kinsmen according to the
[5:42] flesh so this is Paul's heart for the
[5:47] Lost he knows his Brethren according to
[5:50] the flesh the nation of Israel is
[5:54] lost and he's saying I would sacrifice
[5:57] my own self for them
[6:00] to be
[6:01] saved he says who are Israelites to whom
[6:05] pertaineth the adoption and the glory
[6:08] and the covenants and the giving of the
[6:10] law and the service of God and the
[6:13] promises whose are the fathers and whom
[6:16] as concerning the flesh Christ came who
[6:18] is over all God bless forever amen see
[6:22] Paul even at this point in time speaks
[6:24] of them that the promises belong to them
[6:28] it's not as though this they rejected
[6:30] the Messiah and God has cast them away
[6:34] forever no they're still God's chosen
[6:37] people they the adoption belongs to them
[6:40] or the placing as children of God the
[6:43] glory the covenants the giving of the
[6:45] law the service of God even at that time
[6:48] they were still in the temple and the
[6:51] promises so they they are blessed and as
[6:55] we remember all through Paul's Epistles
[6:59] when he speaks of the Gospel it says to
[7:01] the Jews first and also to the Greeks
[7:05] the gospel was to go first to the Jewish
[7:08] people what did they do in the book of
[7:11] Acts at the end of books of Acts what do
[7:12] we witness Paul says you've counted
[7:15] yourself Unworthy of the
[7:18] Gospel so because of that I I I wipe the
[7:22] dust off of my feet and we go to the
[7:25] Gentiles who will hear it
[7:27] gladly so all all of these things are
[7:30] placed there and planted there in the
[7:32] scriptures for us to see that God is was
[7:35] turning away from them this is where
[7:37] Paul is breaking it down for us making
[7:40] it clear to us what is happening if Paul
[7:43] wants to say God has done with Israel
[7:46] this is where he's going to say it he's
[7:49] done with Israel forever the church
[7:51] replaces them if he wants to say that he
[7:54] certainly can say that and this is the
[7:57] place where he explains it not as though
[8:00] the word of God hath taken none effect
[8:02] for they are not all Israel which are of
[8:06] Israel neither because they are the Seed
[8:08] of Abraham are they all children but in
[8:12] Isaac shall thy seed be called again
[8:17] pointing out that just because a person
[8:21] is of the Seed of Abraham doesn't mean
[8:24] they're the children of Abraham Jesus
[8:26] speaks about this in John chapter 8
[8:31] if you remember he calls them the
[8:32] children of the
[8:33] devil and the word he uses is
[8:37] techon techan speaks of a close
[8:40] relationship and fellowship a and uh
[8:45] sort of like the I the concept of the
[8:47] Apple doesn't fall far from the tree in
[8:50] other words you take after you take
[8:52] after the nature of your father Jesus
[8:55] said tells the Pharisees you're of your
[8:57] father the devil you're the the techan
[9:00] of the devil you're not the techan of
[9:02] Abraham because Abraham didn't do this
[9:05] Abraham didn't act this way yes I know
[9:08] that you're The Offspring of Abraham but
[9:11] not all Israel is
[9:16] Israel that is they which are the
[9:18] children of the flesh these are not the
[9:21] children of God but the children of the
[9:24] promise are counted for the seed for
[9:27] This Is The Word of Promise at this time
[9:29] will I come and Sarah will have a son
[9:32] again Abraham had a number of children
[9:36] apart from Sarah but none of them were
[9:39] to obtain the promise only the elected
[9:43] in the family were to obtain the promise
[9:45] Esau by right should have obtained the
[9:47] promise but he wasn't elected that's
[9:50] what he's going to talk about here and
[9:52] not only this but when Rebecca also had
[9:54] conceived by one even by Our Father
[9:56] Isaac for the children being not yet
[9:58] born neither having done any good or
[10:00] evil that the purpose of God according
[10:03] to election might stand not of works but
[10:06] of him that cth it was said unto her the
[10:09] Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is
[10:12] written Jacob have I loved but Esau have
[10:16] I hated what shall we say then is there
[10:19] unrighteousness with God God
[10:22] forbid for he saith to Moses I will have
[10:25] mercy on whom I will have mercy and I
[10:27] will have compassion on whom I will have
[10:29] compassion so then it is not of him that
[10:32] willth nor of him that runneth but of
[10:35] God that showeth mercy so
[10:39] salvation is based on God's choosing
[10:43] God's predestinated plan it's not based
[10:45] on your will it's not based on your
[10:49] works but it's based on God's Sovereign
[10:52] will making his choice and saying I will
[10:55] have mercy on this one and I will pass
[10:58] over this one now now people will say
[11:01] what kind of God is that that would just
[11:05] choose to have mercy on some well here's
[11:08] the problem with that line of thinking
[11:10] is that Mercy is not deserved Mercy is
[11:14] undeserved to get what we
[11:17] deserve don't think anyone wants
[11:20] that all of us have sinned all of us
[11:24] have fallen short of the glory of God
[11:25] all of us are worthy of hell
[11:29] but and and the fact is that all of us
[11:32] left to our own selves would turn away
[11:35] and reject and hate
[11:37] God but instead God by his Mercy comes
[11:41] and says I I will I will open your heart
[11:45] to the word of God that you can receive
[11:47] it and I can have mercy on
[11:51] you for the scripture saith unto Pharaoh
[11:53] even for this same purpose have I raised
[11:56] thee up that I might show my power in
[11:59] thee and that my name might be declared
[12:02] throughout all the Earth therefore hath
[12:05] he Mercy on whom he will have mercy and
[12:08] whom he will he hardeneth so he's saying
[12:11] I choose the one to have mercy and I
[12:14] choose to harden the hearts of
[12:16] others see this is God he predestines to
[12:21] Salvation and he also pred predestines
[12:24] to
[12:26] damnation that's his sovereignty
[12:30] thou will say then unto me why do he yet
[12:34] find fault for who has resisted his
[12:38] will this is Paul's answer and
[12:41] ultimately this is God's answer back to
[12:43] us neid oh man who art thou that
[12:45] repliest against God shall the thing
[12:48] formed say to him that formed it why
[12:50] hast Thou made me thus and again we
[12:52] often take these verses and we just
[12:54] apply it to personal salvation that's
[12:57] correct we should do that however if you
[13:00] see the bigger picture of Romans 9
[13:02] through 11 you can understand it a
[13:05] little bit
[13:07] better when you see that he's actually
[13:11] still talking about Israel and the
[13:15] Gentiles naid oh man who are you that
[13:18] reply against God shall the thing form
[13:20] say to him that formed it why hast Thou
[13:23] made me thus in other
[13:25] words had not the PO power over the clay
[13:28] of the same l to make one vessel un
[13:31] honor and another un dishonor what if
[13:34] God willing to show his wrath and to
[13:36] make his power known endured with much
[13:38] longsuffering the vessels of Wrath
[13:41] fitted to destruction and that he might
[13:43] make known The Riches of his glory on
[13:45] the vessels of Mercy which he had a four
[13:48] prepared unto Glory even us whom he hath
[13:51] called not of the Jews only but also of
[13:55] the Gentiles now I want to I want to
[14:00] take a minute to speak about this we I
[14:02] talked about it last time and I want to
[14:04] bring it up
[14:05] again he Paul writes of make sure that
[14:09] you give we give no offense to the Jews
[14:12] to the Gentiles or to the Church of God
[14:16] so when we look at the world the world
[14:19] looks at there's this nation there's
[14:21] that Nation there's Jews there's Muslims
[14:24] there Christians God looks at it this
[14:26] way Jews gentiles Nations the Church of
[14:31] God those are the three things that we
[14:33] should keep in our mind God is dealing
[14:38] with the Church of God now God has a
[14:40] purpose for the Jews he's brought them
[14:42] back to their Homeland but he's not
[14:44] dealing with them in Redemption of
[14:47] course there's individuals I I know I
[14:50] know I know some that have received the
[14:52] message that have received the baptism
[14:54] of the Holy Ghost and they're
[14:56] Jewish that's that's the that's that's a
[14:58] rem that's a small amount but as a whole
[15:02] as a nation God is not bringing
[15:05] salvation to the Jews he will do that as
[15:08] soon as the Church of God the
[15:10] Gentile bride is called up in the
[15:14] Rapture then he turns the two witnesses
[15:16] come and the Seal of the Holy Ghost
[15:18] comes to the
[15:20] 144,000 but now he's not dealing with
[15:23] them that
[15:24] way with Gentile Nations how we we know
[15:29] not only the Gentiles but also the
[15:31] Jewish
[15:32] political all these nations are ruled by
[15:35] the devil the Jewish nation is not yet
[15:37] ruled by the Messiah I wish it was if it
[15:40] was they'd be all
[15:43] Christians but it's not they're all
[15:46] under the the prince of the power of the
[15:50] air you can read go read in the Book of
[15:53] Revelation Jerusalem is called the city
[15:56] that is spiritually Sodom and gomorra
[15:59] and to this day every year they have a
[16:02] gay pride event right in
[16:06] Jerusalem so God says it's spiritually
[16:09] Sodom my goodness so even Israel
[16:13] politically speaking is under the
[16:15] control of the enemy though God has a
[16:19] purpose but he has a purpose with
[16:21] America and Russia and
[16:22] everyone it's it's going to be
[16:25] Destruction for
[16:27] all it's as though God is going to the
[16:30] Messiah is going to sweep down and say
[16:32] oh there's my servant Netanyahu and the
[16:35] knesset you all are my you are all the
[16:38] people that I chose no that's not what
[16:39] he's doing it's going to be Christ and
[16:42] the bride that return and who is going
[16:44] to rule over it's not going to be the
[16:45] knesset it's not going to be Netanyahu
[16:48] it's going to be the TW Apostles that
[16:51] will rule over the TW tribes of Israel
[16:55] all
[16:56] right so here as we look at this
[16:59] understand those three types of people
[17:00] Jews Gentiles and the church the called
[17:03] out ones they're called out of Gentiles
[17:05] they're called out of Jews to form one
[17:07] new man you can read that in Ephesians 2
[17:10] and
[17:11] three and these are the these those are
[17:15] that's the place where the Holy Spirit
[17:17] that's probably the better way to put it
[17:19] is that's the place the holy spirit is
[17:21] working holy spirit's not falling upon
[17:24] Jews right now God is working to set
[17:26] things in order but the B ISM of the
[17:29] Holy Ghost is not available there unless
[17:32] they come to this seventh Angel's
[17:36] message and receive it then they can get
[17:39] the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[17:40] through the to the Jewish Nation
[17:42] spiritually speaking God is not working
[17:45] with them that
[17:46] way Romans 9:25 as he saith also in
[17:51] Hosea I will call them my people which
[17:53] were not my people and her beloved which
[17:56] was not beloved that's that's us we were
[18:01] not beloved he's called us beloved not
[18:05] yes yes Gentiles but Gentiles who repent
[18:09] and receive the Gospel who become the
[18:11] called out ones and it shall come to
[18:13] pass that in the place where it was said
[18:15] unto them you are not my people there
[18:17] shall they be called the children of the
[18:21] Living God that's the church
[18:29] Isaiah also crith concerning Israel
[18:31] though the number of the children of
[18:33] Israel be as the sand of the sea a
[18:36] Remnant shall be
[18:38] saved for he will finish the work and
[18:41] cut it short in righteousness because a
[18:44] short work will the Lord make upon the
[18:47] earth I believe this is speaking of the
[18:50] future still in that
[18:53] time just that short period of time
[18:57] three and a half years where he deals
[18:58] with Israel through those two witnesses
[19:01] it would be a short work but only even
[19:03] then though there be millions and there
[19:06] are millions of Israelites today still
[19:11] only a Remnant will be saved think about
[19:14] what 144,000 is there it would only be
[19:18] considered a blip on the radar in Israel
[19:21] if you were to spread that out
[19:23] throughout
[19:24] Israel not me it's not a huge massive
[19:27] amount of people amongst their
[19:31] population and Isa and as Isaiah said
[19:34] before except the Lord of sabba oath had
[19:36] left us a seed we had been as Sodom and
[19:40] made like unto gomorah what shall we say
[19:43] then that the Gentiles which followed
[19:45] not after righteousness we were pagans
[19:49] as brother brandham said we had a we had
[19:50] a club on our backs and we were Idol
[19:55] worshippers we have attained to
[19:57] righteousness even the righteousness
[20:00] which is of Faith but Israel which
[20:04] followed not after the law of
[20:06] righteousness hath not attained to the
[20:09] law of
[20:10] righteousness that's strange I thought
[20:12] they were following the
[20:14] law the law of sin and death the law of
[20:18] Works they were following not the law of
[20:20] righteousness what is the law of
[20:22] righteousness Abraham believed God and
[20:24] it was imputed unto him for
[20:27] righteousness
[20:29] wherefore because they sought it not by
[20:31] faith but as it were by The Works of the
[20:34] law for they stumbled at that stumbling
[20:38] Stone as it is written behold I lay in
[20:41] Zion a stumbling stone and rock of a
[20:43] fence and whosoever believeth on him
[20:46] shall not be ashamed who's The Stumbling
[20:50] Stone who's the rock of offense Christ
[20:54] Christ
[20:55] crucified to the Jews what foolishness a
[20:59] stumbling
[21:01] block they can't understand that they're
[21:04] expecting a king to overthrow a
[21:07] governmental system that's still in
[21:09] their minds they're still they're not
[21:12] looking for a
[21:13] sacrifice even many of them are not even
[21:16] looking for a rebuilt Temple they don't
[21:18] want it we think oh the Jewish nation is
[21:21] just waiting for the chance to tear down
[21:23] the Dome of the Rock no
[21:28] very very
[21:30] few Jewish people want to see the temple
[21:35] rebuilt they're they're afraid if you go
[21:38] if you go to the temple if you try to go
[21:40] to the Temple Mount there's a big sign
[21:42] from two both the major the sapharic and
[21:45] the ashkanazi rabbis with their picture
[21:47] saying do not go to the Temple Mount
[21:50] you're not allowed to under Judaism you
[21:53] might step on the holy of
[21:56] holies so but many still go
[22:00] but nevertheless those in power they
[22:02] don't want it they don't want to upset
[22:04] what what's happening
[22:07] there it's it's a blindness has happened
[22:11] to
[22:11] them and the truth is they're they they
[22:16] most Orthodox and serious religious
[22:20] Jewish people are
[22:24] Antichrist that's just a fact they they
[22:27] hate Christians
[22:29] they hate the gospel God have mercy upon
[22:32] them they need to repent they'll have
[22:35] their time to
[22:36] repent but it'll be through two
[22:38] witnesses two two two prophets Moses I
[22:42] believe men after the spirit and power
[22:44] of Elijah and Moses though some people
[22:46] think it'll literally be Elijah and
[22:48] Moses that's not a matter of Salvation
[22:51] so don't let's not argue about it but
[22:54] but uh following God's principle these
[22:57] men will raise up
[22:59] and begin to prophesy and their message
[23:02] will be Vindicated but it'll be a
[23:03] message to the world of judgment they'll
[23:06] be smiting the Earth with plagues this
[23:08] is part of their Vindication just as
[23:09] Moses did and just as Elijah did but
[23:13] what was it it was proving who the true
[23:15] and living God of Israel is and it's
[23:19] it's
[23:20] not it's it's not what they think it is
[23:23] who is it the Lord Jesus
[23:27] Christ the living God made manifest in
[23:30] human flesh and until they turn to him
[23:33] him they're walking in blindness and
[23:35] they need to repent though they be God's
[23:38] chosen
[23:39] people
[23:41] Brethren my heart's desire and prayer to
[23:44] God for Israel is that they might be
[23:47] saved so why is he praying why is he
[23:50] praying if they're already saved they're
[23:52] they're not saved they're lost why
[23:55] because they're blind they've rejected
[23:57] Jesus Christ and when you reject Jesus
[23:59] Christ you have rejected
[24:02] salvation and so here they are in this
[24:05] condition and and Paul's heart's desire
[24:08] and prayer is for their salvation is it
[24:10] a hopeless thing Paul
[24:13] no no it's not for I bear them record
[24:17] that they have a Zeal of God but not
[24:20] according to knowledge they're lacking
[24:23] what not merely human knowledge they
[24:26] have all kinds of knowledge what are
[24:28] they lacking spiritual
[24:31] Revelation that brings them into an
[24:34] experiential knowledge of who God is you
[24:37] can be zealous for God but not know God
[24:40] At All by
[24:42] Revelation for they being ignorant of
[24:44] God's righteousness and going about to
[24:47] establish their own righteousness have
[24:50] not submitted themselves unto the
[24:53] righteousness of God isn't that amazing
[24:57] to think their Zeal for the law I mean
[25:01] if you read in the book of Acts Paul
[25:04] returns from his missions trip to the
[25:06] Gentiles and the all they gather
[25:09] together and what do they say look at
[25:11] all these people that have turned to the
[25:13] way and they're all zealous for the
[25:17] law my my they were so proud of
[25:21] themselves God's heart was bleeding you
[25:24] don't see it you don't get it you don't
[25:26] understand what happened in Christ
[25:29] you're missing it
[25:30] completely you've not submitted yourself
[25:33] you're still trying to establish your
[25:35] own
[25:38] righteousness for
[25:40] Christ is the end of the law for
[25:43] righteousness to everyone that believes
[25:47] amen Christ is the end of the law once
[25:49] you have received Christ by the baptism
[25:52] of the Holy Ghost into your heart what
[25:55] is it the law is now living inside of
[25:58] you the nature of God which is
[26:01] manifested in the law is is on on the
[26:05] inside working out the righteousness of
[26:07] God in you for Moses describes the
[26:10] righteousness which is of the law that
[26:13] the man which doeth those things shall
[26:16] live by them now again we go back to the
[26:20] context Romans Chapter 2 Romans chapter
[26:24] 3 both prove that the Jewish people need
[26:29] Christ as much as the Gentiles they're
[26:32] all under both Jews Paul says we've
[26:35] determined before that both Jews and
[26:38] Gentiles are all sold under sin all
[26:43] under the Dominion of sin if you break
[26:46] one of the laws you're a breaker of all
[26:48] the
[26:49] laws and he proved that the all every
[26:52] Jew is breaking the law
[26:55] so they try to live by them but can they
[26:58] live live by them no one
[27:00] can but the righteousness which is of
[27:03] faith speaketh on this wise ah it speaks
[27:08] say not in thine heart who will Who who
[27:11] shall Ascend to Heaven that is PR Christ
[27:14] down from above or who shall it descend
[27:17] into the deep that is to bring up Christ
[27:20] again from the dead but what saith it
[27:23] the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth
[27:26] and in thy heart that is the word of
[27:29] faith which we preach what is the word
[27:31] of faith that if you confess with your
[27:34] mouth the Lord Jesus or if if really the
[27:38] right way for that is confess with thy
[27:40] mouth that Jesus is Lord and Shall
[27:43] Believe in thine heart that God hath
[27:45] raised him from the dead Thou shalt be
[27:49] saved amen it's by faith
[27:52] alone that we're saved it's not by The
[27:56] Works of the law it's by by believing in
[27:59] the Lord Jesus Christ and making your
[28:01] confession and really what is the way
[28:03] that we outwardly make our confession
[28:06] that Jesus is Lord by being baptized in
[28:09] the name of the Lord Jesus
[28:13] Christ that's what
[28:15] that's that's right there it's another
[28:18] way of putting acts 238 repent be
[28:23] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[28:24] Christ for the remission of sins and you
[28:27] shall receive
[28:28] the gift of the Holy
[28:31] Ghost for with the heart man believeth
[28:34] under righteousness and with the mouth
[28:37] confession is made unto salvation for
[28:39] the scripture saith whosoever believeth
[28:42] on him shall not be
[28:45] ashamed amen so we're going to have to
[28:48] quit there probably have to go back over
[28:50] some of this as we go just to get the
[28:52] get the uh feeling and the understanding
[28:56] of he's not really
[28:58] he's partially left talking about Israel
[29:01] and the Gentiles but he not really left
[29:03] it he's trying he's trying to show the
[29:06] distinction why is Israel in trouble why
[29:10] are why is God dealing with the Gentiles
[29:13] and how will he restore Israel so let's
[29:17] pray Heavenly Father we come before you
[29:19] Lord and we ask that your Holy Spirit
[29:21] would be with us Lord in the worship and
[29:24] in the preaching of the word today Lord
[29:27] pray that you'd be glorified
[29:28] pray for all those traveling now Lord
[29:30] that you'd keep your hand upon them Lord
[29:33] and bless them wherever they're at we
[29:34] ask in Jesus name amen
