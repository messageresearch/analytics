[46:29] words or my thoughts but that would be
[46:31] you speaking through me father that
[46:32] these people would hear your words and
[46:34] not mine
[46:35] father we know that anything that i
[46:36] would say wouldn't be able to edify them
[46:38] but anything that you would say would
[46:39] give them eternal life father we ask
[46:41] that you would
[46:42] you would speak through me father and
[46:43] that you would anoint their ears to hear
[46:44] it anoint their hearts to be open to
[46:46] hear your word and be receptive father
[46:48] and we ask these things in your precious
[46:50] wonderful name the lord jesus christ
[46:52] amen
[46:53] y'all can be seated
[46:55] um so
[46:57] this is a very uh well-known scripture
[46:59] i'm sure we're all very familiar with it
[47:01] and um knowing that this is a
[47:04] a prophecy you know several hundred
[47:06] years before um
[47:09] you know the actual christ coming in
[47:10] flesh
[47:11] um that is identifying that when he
[47:14] would come the people that he would come
[47:17] to wouldn't
[47:18] see him as anything special
[47:20] that they would completely miss who he
[47:22] was
[47:24] almost entirely based on his appearance
[47:27] right there's no he's no
[47:29] you know where it says um
[47:31] uh he has no form nor comelyness that we
[47:34] should see him
[47:35] um
[47:37] uh hang on nor formerly companies and
[47:39] when we shall see him there's no beauty
[47:40] that we should desire of him right he's
[47:42] there's nothing beautiful or special
[47:44] there's no
[47:45] there's no big light show that comes
[47:47] when christ shows up
[47:49] except for those who know what it is
[47:51] right that those who knew that what the
[47:53] star was they saw it but
[47:55] for the vast majority of the world thank
[47:57] you
[47:58] um the vast majority of the world
[48:00] they completely
[48:02] missed who he was because they were
[48:04] entirely
[48:06] wrapped up on the exterior they got
[48:08] completely blinded by
[48:10] what was on the outside
[48:13] um and so i wanna i wanna
[48:15] turn to john chapter seven
[48:17] um st john chapter seven
[48:20] um
[48:21] and uh
[48:22] pull my notes up here
[48:24] while we're turning
[48:40] and uh we'll start at verse one um
[48:44] it says uh after these things jesus
[48:46] walked in galilee for he would not walk
[48:48] in jewry because the jews sought to kill
[48:50] him
[48:51] now the jews feast of tabernacles was at
[48:53] hand his brethren therefore said unto
[48:55] him depart hence and go into judea for
[48:57] the disciples may
[48:59] may also may see the works that thou
[49:01] doest
[49:02] for there is no man that doeth anything
[49:04] in secret and he himself seeketh to be
[49:06] known openly if thou do these things
[49:09] show thyself to the world
[49:12] um for neither did his brethren believe
[49:14] in him then jesus said unto them my time
[49:17] has not yet come but your time
[49:20] is always ready the world cannot hate
[49:23] you but me it hadeth because i testify
[49:25] of it that the works thereof are evil
[49:28] you go up unto this feast i go not up
[49:31] yet unto this feast for my time is not
[49:33] yet full come
[49:35] when he had said these words unto them
[49:37] he bode still in galilee
[49:39] now
[49:40] again this is this is yet another
[49:42] example of how even the people
[49:45] in his hometown he couldn't there's
[49:47] nothing he could have said to convince
[49:49] them who he was
[49:51] they were com because they knew him like
[49:53] oh this is just jesus from around the
[49:54] corner
[49:55] right this is our cousin this is our
[49:57] brother this is
[49:58] somebody that we've grown up with they
[50:00] could not get past
[50:02] what was on the outside the flesh that
[50:05] they knew the flesh that they grew up
[50:08] with the the humanity that was right in
[50:10] front of them completely blinded them to
[50:13] the actual deity that was standing there
[50:16] right
[50:17] and so then um it
[50:19] the the chapter goes on and it talks
[50:21] about how you went up to the the feast
[50:22] after they had gone up
[50:24] um and uh i want to skip down to um
[50:30] uh where was that
[50:32] um
[50:33] down to ch verse um
[50:36] go down to verse 15.
[50:38] um and it says
[50:40] um
[50:41] and the jews marveled saying
[50:44] how knoweth this man letters having
[50:46] never learned right because it was
[50:48] because jesus went up to the feast but
[50:49] he to jerusalem but he was teaching in
[50:51] the temple
[50:52] right and so all these people are
[50:54] marveling like well
[50:55] we know this guy we know his educational
[50:57] background he never went to school how
[50:58] does he know how to read how does he
[51:00] know how to how to
[51:01] you know knows all this doctrine where
[51:03] did he learn it he never i mean he
[51:04] didn't even go to school right again
[51:07] they're they're completely stunned by
[51:09] this exterior
[51:11] um jesus answered them and said my
[51:13] doctrine is not mine but his that sent
[51:15] me if any man will do his will he shall
[51:19] know of the doctrine whether it be of
[51:20] god or whether i speak of myself he that
[51:23] speaketh of himself seeketh his own
[51:25] glory but he that seeketh
[51:28] his glory that sent him the same is true
[51:31] and no unrighteousness is in him
[51:34] did not moses give you the law
[51:36] and yet none of you keepeth the law why
[51:39] go ye about to kill me
[51:42] and the people answered and said thou
[51:43] has the devil who goes to go with about
[51:45] to kill thee
[51:47] jesus answered and said unto them
[51:49] i have done one work and you all marvel
[51:51] moses therefore gave
[51:53] unto you circumcision not because it is
[51:56] of moses but of the fathers and ye on
[51:59] the sabbath day circumcise a man
[52:01] if a man on the sabbath day receives
[52:03] circumcision that the law of moses
[52:05] should not be broken
[52:07] are ye angry at me because i have made a
[52:10] man every wit whole on the sabbath day
[52:13] judge not according to the appearance
[52:15] but
[52:16] judge
[52:17] righteous judgment
[52:19] then said some of them
[52:21] of jerusalem is not this he whom they
[52:24] seek to kill
[52:26] but lo he speaketh boldly
[52:29] and they say nothing unto him do the
[52:31] rulers know indeed
[52:33] that this is the very christ
[52:36] how be it we know this man
[52:38] uh whence he is
[52:40] but when christ cometh no man knoweth
[52:42] whence he is
[52:43] then cried jesus in the temple as he
[52:46] taught saying
[52:47] you both know me and you know whence i
[52:49] am and i am not come of myself
[52:53] but he that sent me
[52:55] is true whom you know not but i know him
[52:58] for i am from him and he has sent me
[53:02] and so here's
[53:03] he you know so here he is he goes to
[53:05] teach
[53:06] and again the people are so hung
[53:10] on
[53:11] his appearance his lack of education um
[53:14] and and they're like well he could be
[53:15] the christ he's teaching boldly and and
[53:18] the and the rulers aren't saying
[53:19] anything even though we know they want
[53:20] to kill him maybe they're being
[53:22] convinced that he's the christ but man
[53:24] if he is the christ he can't be the
[53:26] christ because we know when the christ
[53:27] appears he'll just sort of appear and we
[53:30] won't know where he came from and we
[53:31] know jesus we know is where he comes
[53:32] from we're from his hometown
[53:34] this can't be him we know too much about
[53:36] his past and
[53:39] you know everything about him
[53:42] and
[53:43] we kind of look at this
[53:48] you know and it's it's so baffling to us
[53:52] looking back on it
[53:53] you know especially um like in from the
[53:56] sunday school um you know the last time
[53:59] you know when i took sunday school last
[54:00] we mentioned that um when he uh fed 5000
[54:03] right
[54:04] how he had
[54:05] he had um which which actually let me
[54:08] just look at my notes here
[54:10] because i have this scripture here this
[54:11] is john 6
[54:13] 26-34
[54:15] jesus answered them and said verily
[54:16] verily i say unto you
[54:18] you seek me not because you saw the
[54:20] miracles
[54:21] but because you did eat of the loaves
[54:23] and were filled now this is this is the
[54:25] day after
[54:26] um he had fed the 5000 and they came to
[54:28] the other side of the ocean to or other
[54:30] side of the sea of galilee to find him
[54:32] so he's talking to the same people
[54:34] um
[54:35] and this is this is how he greets the
[54:36] crowd that came came looking for him
[54:39] um you know you're not looking for me
[54:41] because of the miracles you just got a
[54:42] full belly and you're you're looking for
[54:44] some some handout you know
[54:46] um
[54:49] uh and he says labor not for the meat
[54:51] which peri perisheth
[54:53] but for that meat which endureth unto
[54:55] everlasting life which the son of man
[54:57] shall give unto you
[54:59] for him hath god the father sealed
[55:02] which is an interesting statement the
[55:03] fact that he's recognizing that he is
[55:06] sealed
[55:07] which
[55:08] i mean you could almost
[55:09] take a whole thing on the seven seals
[55:11] right off of that um that he he is the
[55:13] bread of life sealed with seven seals
[55:15] that would be open at the end at the
[55:16] last day um
[55:18] then saying uh said they unto him
[55:21] what shall we do that we might work the
[55:23] works of god jesus answered and said to
[55:24] them this is the work of god
[55:26] that you believe on him
[55:28] whom he hath sent
[55:31] they said therefore unto him
[55:33] what signs show us thou then that we may
[55:35] see and believe thee
[55:37] what doest thou what
[55:39] doest thou work
[55:40] our fathers that eat man in the desert
[55:42] as it is written he gave them bread from
[55:44] heaven to eat
[55:46] then jesus said to them verily barely
[55:47] say unto you moses gave you not the
[55:49] bread from heaven but my father gave you
[55:51] the true bread from heaven for the bread
[55:53] of god
[55:54] is he which cometh down from heaven and
[55:56] giveth life unto the world
[55:59] then said they unto him lord evermore
[56:01] give us this bread
[56:03] so here again here it is them completely
[56:06] failing to recognize who's sitting in
[56:07] front of them because they're looking at
[56:08] his flesh and going well this can't be
[56:11] who's this guy
[56:12] prove yourself give us some work to show
[56:14] that you're of god failing completely
[56:15] failing to recognize that they literally
[56:17] ate the very work that they were asking
[56:19] for the previous day
[56:21] right he broke the bread and if anything
[56:23] it's it's a greater more
[56:26] profound thing because in moses day they
[56:28] went to bed and the bread fell out of
[56:30] the sky right the old gods in heaven and
[56:32] it falls out of the heavens well here he
[56:33] is it's coming directly out of his hands
[56:36] how much more of an indication do you
[56:37] want that it was jehovah sitting in
[56:38] front of them
[56:40] right and they
[56:41] completely miss it because again they're
[56:45] hung up
[56:46] on what he looks like on that he's a
[56:48] flesh person and a flesh person couldn't
[56:50] possibly be jehovah
[56:52] right
[56:54] and and again we look at this and are
[56:56] and are so like man they how could they
[56:58] have missed it
[57:01] and we're thinking yeah i mean after all
[57:02] you know
[57:03] christ has made flesh in our day and we
[57:05] see it you know with brother branham and
[57:06] the ministry and
[57:09] that's about
[57:10] it
[57:12] you know
[57:13] like really
[57:15] you know um
[57:17] the
[57:19] we're so hung up on our flesh
[57:22] and what we see and we know our past and
[57:25] where we came from and all the mistakes
[57:27] and the the catastrophe of our history
[57:30] that we completely fail to see
[57:33] christ manifested in our lives and who
[57:36] we are
[57:38] and
[57:39] this reminds me of um
[57:42] i want to i want to go to um
[57:46] uh esther chapter one
[57:48] um
[57:52] keep an eye on the clock here
[57:55] um and i'll just have you all just pull
[57:56] it up on the screen if you could
[57:59] um
[58:01] oh sorry uh uh verse one
[58:03] oh i'm sorry um verse 10.
[58:06] yeah we'll start with verse 10.
[58:15] all right so um just to give a little
[58:17] bit of of lead up to what's happening uh
[58:19] in the story here
[58:21] at this point in the story um
[58:23] if i'm sure you all are familiar um king
[58:25] of hazaris he's kind of king of persia
[58:27] historically he had just taken conquered
[58:29] babel uh babylon unified this massive
[58:32] empire from india to
[58:33] india to egypt and this is a giant event
[58:37] that he's throwing
[58:38] kind of post-coronation
[58:41] to get all the like a hundred and it
[58:43] says in there i don't forget exactly
[58:44] what it is but it's like 160 provinces
[58:46] each one of these has a lord over it
[58:48] he's bringing all these people in and
[58:50] has this massive six month long
[58:52] demonstration of all of his treasure
[58:55] right it talks about how you went
[58:57] through all this treasure house went
[58:58] through all of his wealth all of his
[59:00] horses and his army and just showed off
[59:02] his massive empire to all these people
[59:04] under him
[59:05] and he's doing this
[59:07] to establish
[59:09] himself as like this supreme ruler right
[59:12] he's he's
[59:15] he's
[59:15] demons because he's got to make sure all
[59:17] of his people are loyal right they got
[59:18] to have a reason to follow him so he's
[59:20] making sure that they understand just
[59:22] how unbelievably powerful he is and at
[59:24] the end of it
[59:25] he has the seven day long feast in like
[59:28] the hanging gardens of
[59:29] of babylon with and it goes into a lot
[59:32] of detail um
[59:34] about like how decadent this feast was
[59:37] all about the hangings and all the
[59:39] marble inlay and mosaic on the floor and
[59:42] it specifically talks about how
[59:44] everyone in his house in his palace it's
[59:46] actually a different translation called
[59:48] a fortress this massive fortress in this
[59:50] capital city that everyone from the
[59:53] lowest servant to the highest noble was
[59:55] invited to this feast and everyone was
[59:58] given a golden chalice that was fit for
[1:00:01] a king and each one was a handcrafted
[1:00:03] specially diverse from all the others
[1:00:06] drinking vessel right which
[1:00:08] historically that's a sign that like
[1:00:10] that's what the king would have to
[1:00:12] identify himself at the feast as like
[1:00:15] the head honcho and he's indicating to
[1:00:17] all these people that even in
[1:00:19] when i'm king even my stable hands party
[1:00:22] like a king
[1:00:23] right even my the even the the servants
[1:00:27] are royalty in my house
[1:00:29] right
[1:00:30] and he has this massive thing and at the
[1:00:32] end of it this is where we pick up
[1:00:35] this is on the seventh day
[1:00:37] when the heart of the king was married
[1:00:38] with wine he commanded muhuman and i not
[1:00:41] gonna try to pronounce all those um the
[1:00:43] seven chamberlains that served in the
[1:00:46] presence of hazaris the king
[1:00:48] and uh come on uh next one
[1:00:50] um
[1:00:51] to bring vashti the queen before the
[1:00:53] king with the crown royal to show the
[1:00:55] people and the princes her beauty for
[1:00:57] she was fair to look on
[1:00:59] but the queen vashti refused to come at
[1:01:02] the king's commandment by his
[1:01:04] chamberlains therefore was the king very
[1:01:07] roth and his anger burned in him
[1:01:11] then the king said to the wise men which
[1:01:14] knew excuse me which knew the times
[1:01:16] for so was the king's manner toward all
[1:01:18] that knew law and judgment
[1:01:21] um
[1:01:23] and the next unto him uh some more names
[1:01:25] that i'm not gonna try to pronounce the
[1:01:26] seven princes of persia and media which
[1:01:28] saw the king's face and which sat uh the
[1:01:31] first in the kingdom
[1:01:33] um
[1:01:34] uh and i will actually stop there um
[1:01:37] so we know the story um
[1:01:40] obviously she he sends a message out to
[1:01:42] her she rejects it and and fails to show
[1:01:44] up which
[1:01:46] you know
[1:01:47] a lot of people kind of read this as
[1:01:48] like well man that's kind of kind of
[1:01:50] rough that he would just depose this
[1:01:52] woman because he didn't she didn't want
[1:01:54] to show up to a party
[1:01:55] right but again if you really look at
[1:01:58] this backstory that's not it wasn't just
[1:01:59] a party
[1:02:00] right it is
[1:02:02] the king
[1:02:03] establishing himself as as this
[1:02:06] unchallengeable unquestionable ruler and
[1:02:09] then his own wife doesn't even respect
[1:02:10] him enough to show up
[1:02:12] right
[1:02:13] this is a massive political disaster
[1:02:16] on for him because
[1:02:18] his all these nobles that he's got to
[1:02:19] keep loyal are going okay what kind of
[1:02:21] like weak dude is this that his own wife
[1:02:23] doesn't respect him right
[1:02:26] so he can't have this
[1:02:28] but more importantly
[1:02:30] what what struck me
[1:02:32] is that
[1:02:33] he asked her specifically
[1:02:36] because it wasn't just a beauty pageant
[1:02:38] what he was doing one of the things that
[1:02:40] he told her specifically was to put the
[1:02:42] crown on her head the royal crown that
[1:02:44] he gave her and walk into this room
[1:02:47] well
[1:02:49] that's there's there's a lot to that
[1:02:52] because number one the crown that he
[1:02:54] told her to wear
[1:02:56] nobody just wears a crown
[1:02:58] right only a king or somebody very
[1:03:00] important to the king wears a crown if
[1:03:03] you do they remove the head that put the
[1:03:04] crown on it right
[1:03:06] you just don't do that because it's a
[1:03:07] challenge to his authority so for him to
[1:03:09] tell her to wear this crown it's him
[1:03:11] telling her you are going to embody my
[1:03:13] authority to these people he's
[1:03:16] presenting his wife
[1:03:18] as the ultimate
[1:03:21] embodiment of all of his wealth she's
[1:03:23] the grand finale of six month long
[1:03:26] treasure demonstration
[1:03:28] right and
[1:03:31] she's not and crown jewels are not just
[1:03:33] a crown it's actually like if you
[1:03:35] actually look up the crown jewels of
[1:03:36] england there's like a gown that goes
[1:03:38] with it and a cloak that's all decked
[1:03:40] out in jewels she's like supposed to be
[1:03:42] like the living embodiment of bling when
[1:03:44] she walks into the room and like from
[1:03:46] head to toe just this magnificent
[1:03:49] opulent being
[1:03:51] who's symbolizing
[1:03:52] what like the king's projection of power
[1:03:55] into another human being
[1:03:58] and she says no
[1:04:01] right
[1:04:02] and more importantly
[1:04:04] not only does she reject the king's
[1:04:07] attempt to embody his authority in her
[1:04:11] but this is what got me
[1:04:13] he sends seven chamberlains which also
[1:04:16] translates to seven eunuchs to go send
[1:04:19] her the message to call her out
[1:04:22] to be this embodiment of authority
[1:04:26] so
[1:04:28] here we have
[1:04:30] this woman who types a church
[1:04:32] who by the way was at another feast she
[1:04:34] had thrown another feast for a bunch of
[1:04:35] other women because all the all the
[1:04:37] women of the palace right
[1:04:39] so she wants here's the church who wants
[1:04:41] to stay with all the other churches
[1:04:43] and instead of
[1:04:46] instead of stepping into the position of
[1:04:49] absolute royal authority that the king
[1:04:52] is giving her it completely ignores the
[1:04:54] message that the seven church age
[1:04:56] messengers gave to her
[1:04:58] and just
[1:04:59] decides no and the funny thing is it's
[1:05:01] not like she wasn't bride material
[1:05:04] she she she number one she heard the
[1:05:07] message of all seven chamberlain's
[1:05:10] right she was exposed to all of their
[1:05:12] message
[1:05:14] she was bride material she i mean he
[1:05:15] married her after all
[1:05:17] and yet when it came time for her to
[1:05:19] step up and take authority and position
[1:05:21] she said no
[1:05:24] and that's what got her put away
[1:05:27] right
[1:05:28] and so now we delineate this
[1:05:30] um with esther right
[1:05:33] which i want to uh look at this at um
[1:05:38] esther chapter five
[1:05:41] um
[1:05:42] just a quick quick little uh
[1:05:44] um
[1:05:46] reading here
[1:05:47] uh sorry um chapter verse one
[1:05:51] um
[1:05:53] uh now it came to pass on the third day
[1:05:55] um that esther put on her royal apparel
[1:05:58] and stood in the inner court of the
[1:05:59] king's house over against the king's
[1:06:01] house and the king sat upon his royal
[1:06:03] throne in the royal house over against
[1:06:05] the gate of the house and that's that's
[1:06:07] good
[1:06:08] so leading up to this as we know um
[1:06:11] there you know heyman sends out the gets
[1:06:13] the king to sign an order gonna kill all
[1:06:15] the jews mordecai is mourning in the
[1:06:17] gates she goes back and forth with him
[1:06:19] asks him what's going on he says you
[1:06:21] have to go before the king
[1:06:23] and
[1:06:24] i don't know i i like
[1:06:27] i like when i read bible stories i like
[1:06:29] kind of playing it out in my head a
[1:06:30] little bit kind of dramatizing it more
[1:06:32] than yeah it's uh
[1:06:34] i don't know brother branham does that a
[1:06:36] lot and so i figured that i can too um
[1:06:38] so
[1:06:41] and so in my mind it's like here's
[1:06:43] esther
[1:06:43] coming before
[1:06:45] mordecai and morocco is like esther you
[1:06:47] gotta do this you gotta do this there's
[1:06:49] not another option we're all gonna die
[1:06:51] and she's like but i can't
[1:06:54] i can't do it like this is
[1:06:56] i'm gonna die and besides who like i
[1:06:58] don't even know how i got here like like
[1:07:01] i'm like an orphan girl
[1:07:03] and like they named me like her because
[1:07:05] their hebrew name was hedesa which
[1:07:07] translated it's means myrtle which is
[1:07:10] like a shrub she's like they named me
[1:07:12] after a shrub like i'm just
[1:07:15] i'm an orphan girl named after a shrub
[1:07:17] and i'm supposed to do this
[1:07:19] and
[1:07:20] and he's like esther get over yourself
[1:07:25] it doesn't matter where you came from or
[1:07:27] who you are or what shrub you're named
[1:07:29] after you're still the queen
[1:07:32] right you're still the queen and god put
[1:07:34] you here for a reason he didn't make you
[1:07:35] queen so you could have a fancy hat and
[1:07:37] a jacuzzi he made you queen because
[1:07:40] there was something you were gonna have
[1:07:40] to do
[1:07:42] right there's something important that
[1:07:44] you're gonna have to do and what is she
[1:07:47] and so this is where she has the
[1:07:49] opportunity to put on the same crown
[1:07:51] that vashti had
[1:07:52] to put on the same gown that vashti had
[1:07:55] to step into her royal authority and she
[1:07:58] did it
[1:07:59] and that was the defining moment of
[1:08:01] esther that was it it wasn't it wasn't
[1:08:04] all the build up it wasn't her winning
[1:08:06] the king's heart and all that that was
[1:08:07] all beautiful and wonderful and it's all
[1:08:08] part of who she was but what defined her
[1:08:11] was the because vashti did all the same
[1:08:13] things right what made esther not vashti
[1:08:16] was her willingness to put on her
[1:08:18] authority and
[1:08:19] and identify herself
[1:08:22] as
[1:08:23] the royal authority made flesh
[1:08:28] so
[1:08:30] you know and this is where you know we
[1:08:32] we talk about you know esther claiming
[1:08:34] her position right you know brother bran
[1:08:36] would would say you know positionally
[1:08:37] placed that here's esther recognizing um
[1:08:41] you know what her position was that this
[1:08:42] was her her calling in life was to save
[1:08:44] the jews
[1:08:46] and you know we talked we know that we
[1:08:48] are supposed to be positionally placed
[1:08:51] and i don't know growing up in the
[1:08:52] message i always kind of like this
[1:08:54] terminology like positional place what
[1:08:55] does that mean
[1:08:57] exactly
[1:08:58] like it's some sort of
[1:08:59] like grand mystical moment like one day
[1:09:03] i'm gonna be like i'm gonna fast and
[1:09:04] pray all night long and i'm gonna i'm
[1:09:06] gonna the sun rises a beam of sun like
[1:09:09] sunbeam's gonna hit me in the head and
[1:09:11] i'm gonna know my position
[1:09:13] and i'm just gonna like
[1:09:15] you know i don't know like have some
[1:09:18] you know healing ministry or or
[1:09:20] build
[1:09:21] 17 churches in sub-saharan africa or
[1:09:25] have a
[1:09:26] theology podcast or something i don't
[1:09:28] know um
[1:09:29] and
[1:09:30] like this is this is going to be this is
[1:09:32] what i have to be to be this is my
[1:09:34] position
[1:09:35] and
[1:09:37] this is what it means or maybe i'll
[1:09:39] start speaking with a british accent
[1:09:40] like jesus and all the bible movies
[1:09:42] i don't know
[1:09:43] um
[1:09:44] but it just seems like it's it's
[1:09:46] supposed to be like some sort of big
[1:09:48] magical thing and that was the
[1:09:49] impression that i had growing up and
[1:09:52] most of that
[1:09:54] because the honest secret is most
[1:09:56] message kids don't actually read the
[1:09:57] message the way they're supposed to um
[1:09:59] or listen to the message the way they're
[1:10:00] supposed to and the end result and what
[1:10:04] what actually so struck me was that one
[1:10:07] day
[1:10:08] i actually decided to look into this i'm
[1:10:10] like yeah actually what does this
[1:10:11] actually mean
[1:10:12] and to be adopted or to be positionally
[1:10:14] placed and all this stuff
[1:10:16] and so shockingly enough you can find
[1:10:18] the answer to this in a message called
[1:10:20] adoption
[1:10:21] um
[1:10:22] it's stunning i know um
[1:10:25] and so i have this quote it's cause
[1:10:27] there's actually four messages one two
[1:10:28] three four um they're numbered actually
[1:10:30] um and so this is actually from the last
[1:10:32] one this is a little excerpt and this
[1:10:33] sums it all up in one happy little
[1:10:35] package
[1:10:36] and says
[1:10:38] and if each one of you in here now has
[1:10:41] not been positionally placed you might
[1:10:44] not be nothing but a housewife well you
[1:10:47] say brother branham i've never done a
[1:10:49] thing in my life i'm not a preacher
[1:10:51] well maybe god brought you here to raise
[1:10:54] a family of children out of that family
[1:10:56] of children may come another family of
[1:10:58] children that'll be a preacher that'll
[1:11:01] send a million souls to christ you had
[1:11:03] to be here you're here for a purpose did
[1:11:06] you know that
[1:11:08] well just like esther
[1:11:11] but we think oh well esther was a queen
[1:11:12] so she's important
[1:11:14] but you're not
[1:11:16] right
[1:11:17] um another this is actually from
[1:11:18] adoption number one um it says that's
[1:11:20] what he taught his church the church
[1:11:23] position uh positionally before the
[1:11:25] foundation of the world when god in his
[1:11:28] labor pain
[1:11:30] was bringing forth bringing forth you
[1:11:32] knowing what you would do he
[1:11:34] positionally placed you in his own body
[1:11:38] to be a housewife to be a farmer to be a
[1:11:41] preacher to be a prophet to be this or
[1:11:44] to be that he placed you positionally
[1:11:49] and then
[1:11:50] knowing like this changes a lot of
[1:11:52] things doesn't it right because it's no
[1:11:54] longer what we're waiting for some big
[1:11:56] moment
[1:11:58] your moment is monday morning when you
[1:11:59] gotta go to work
[1:12:00] [Music]
[1:12:02] right
[1:12:03] that's your moment
[1:12:06] and
[1:12:08] you know i think of
[1:12:10] you know in my mind so the other day me
[1:12:12] and katie have been going through um
[1:12:14] the um
[1:12:15] the gospels
[1:12:17] and um
[1:12:20] when i read
[1:12:21] john chapter six and we get to the part
[1:12:23] where
[1:12:24] um jesus feeds five thousand right
[1:12:26] and you know brother graham tells a
[1:12:27] story about how his little boy's lunch
[1:12:29] that he he had
[1:12:30] you know fish couple fish sandwiches in
[1:12:32] his in his little bag right he says you
[1:12:34] played hooky from school
[1:12:36] right to go to jesus meetings
[1:12:39] and i thought of himself and i looked at
[1:12:41] katie said hey
[1:12:42] okay so when he
[1:12:44] breaks the fishing loaves
[1:12:46] he's replicating the cooking right
[1:12:50] so
[1:12:50] somewhere not in this story
[1:12:53] there's another story
[1:12:55] of a mom who woke up that day
[1:12:57] and made sure her kids had lunch
[1:13:01] to go to
[1:13:02] school and that was her job that day
[1:13:06] and it wasn't anything special she did
[1:13:08] it just like she did every day it wasn't
[1:13:10] magic it wasn't a sunbeam hitter in the
[1:13:12] head she got up and cooked lunch
[1:13:15] and she gave it to her little boy and
[1:13:17] sent him off to school and then he came
[1:13:19] back with dirt on his face and said mom
[1:13:21] you'll never believe what happened she
[1:13:22] said you're right you're home two hours
[1:13:23] early from school i'm not gonna believe
[1:13:25] it um
[1:13:28] and he says no no you don't understand
[1:13:30] let me tell you the story
[1:13:33] and then it was through that
[1:13:36] that a mom
[1:13:38] doing
[1:13:39] mom things
[1:13:42] ended up providing jesus with the
[1:13:44] material that would identify him as
[1:13:46] jehovah on the earth
[1:13:49] right so
[1:13:53] the funny thing is
[1:13:55] he's jehovah he could have snapped his
[1:13:57] fingers and just poofed all the food
[1:13:59] into existence he didn't need the lunch
[1:14:03] but he still put a mom in the world to
[1:14:06] let her have an opportunity to be part
[1:14:09] of the plan
[1:14:11] he still let the mom be part of the plan
[1:14:15] and
[1:14:16] it doesn't matter who you are
[1:14:18] it doesn't matter what you do it doesn't
[1:14:20] matter if you're a plumber or an ac guy
[1:14:22] or a mom or whatever you've got an
[1:14:24] opportunity you don't necessarily know
[1:14:26] when you just go to work every day doing
[1:14:29] the ex doing what god called you to do
[1:14:32] because you never know when you
[1:14:35] because this is the thing right the
[1:14:36] posit the whole point of positionally
[1:14:38] placement is that it is you being a
[1:14:42] plumber as if god himself was the
[1:14:44] plumber
[1:14:45] right it is you doing with the character
[1:14:47] and and the
[1:14:49] the um the humility and the the ethics
[1:14:53] and the the the charity and all these
[1:14:55] things as if jesus was the one fixing
[1:14:57] the pipes or you know if jesus the one
[1:15:00] painting the walls or jesus the one
[1:15:02] cooking lunch whatever it was
[1:15:05] it is jesus doing it you have the
[1:15:07] character of christ and that's
[1:15:09] manifesting through you and you just do
[1:15:12] that because that's your position it's
[1:15:13] allowing
[1:15:14] jesus to operate
[1:15:16] isaiah 53 to whom is the arm of the lord
[1:15:20] revealed
[1:15:21] it's the arm of the lord to do things
[1:15:26] and
[1:15:28] we why does
[1:15:29] we do this because we want the
[1:15:31] opportunity to manifest christ to people
[1:15:33] and we're going to do this over and over
[1:15:35] and over again and it's not going to be
[1:15:36] special it's not going to be
[1:15:37] pyrotechnics every day it's going to be
[1:15:39] boring but we're going to get up and do
[1:15:40] it anyways as if christ was doing it
[1:15:43] because we are christ doing it
[1:15:45] and it's going to we do this because you
[1:15:48] never know when you're going to have the
[1:15:49] opportunity to manifest jehovah in the
[1:15:52] flesh to somebody
[1:15:54] and you don't it might not even be
[1:15:55] somebody that you meet it might be one
[1:15:57] of your grandkids or your great
[1:15:59] grandkids you don't know or just some
[1:16:01] twice removed person that you've never
[1:16:03] met but you affected them somehow you
[1:16:06] don't know but god does and that's why
[1:16:08] he needs you in that position
[1:16:11] he's setting up all the pieces on the
[1:16:13] chessboard and the individual piece
[1:16:14] doesn't know what's happening he just
[1:16:16] knows to stand on this square and fix
[1:16:19] the pipes
[1:16:21] and so that's what he does and
[1:16:24] suddenly one day he gets to the other
[1:16:26] side and all these people show up and
[1:16:28] said this is our precious brother that
[1:16:30] caused us to come to the lord and goes
[1:16:31] what i just fixed pipes
[1:16:34] and then yeah but you don't understand
[1:16:36] let me tell you how you doing that
[1:16:39] led me to the lord and you didn't even
[1:16:41] know it
[1:16:45] and the whole point
[1:16:46] is if you manifest jehovah in what
[1:16:50] you're doing day to day eventually the
[1:16:53] two things are gonna come in line the
[1:16:55] spiritual and the natural and you're
[1:16:57] just gonna manifest jesus
[1:16:58] in the flesh
[1:17:00] the actual why did brother branham talk
[1:17:02] about if he was a potato farmer when the
[1:17:04] lord came he wanted to find him planting
[1:17:06] potatoes
[1:17:08] because that's
[1:17:11] that is the that is the that is how you
[1:17:14] manifest christ right
[1:17:16] and so
[1:17:18] um
[1:17:20] the the
[1:17:22] the struggle then becomes
[1:17:24] to actually
[1:17:26] believe it
[1:17:29] because nobody
[1:17:31] the whole the whole difficulty when
[1:17:33] christ was on the earth is that nobody
[1:17:34] believed it they no matter what he did
[1:17:38] no matter what he did he could have done
[1:17:40] everything they asked him to do that he
[1:17:41] literally did it and they still didn't
[1:17:43] catch it
[1:17:45] so what are you going to do
[1:17:48] right who has believed our report i want
[1:17:50] to
[1:17:51] pull up isaiah 53 those first three
[1:17:52] verses again
[1:17:54] and
[1:17:55] um
[1:17:56] but can you pull it up in the nlt
[1:17:58] actually
[1:18:01] can you do that
[1:18:02] i can if you can't
[1:18:12] you see because this is ultimately what
[1:18:16] the message of the hour is
[1:18:19] the whole point remember esther esther
[1:18:21] knew the gown and the crown and the
[1:18:24] royal regalia that she was to wear she
[1:18:25] knew how to take that royal authority
[1:18:27] because she was taught how to do it
[1:18:29] by
[1:18:30] a chamberlain
[1:18:31] there was there was a messenger that
[1:18:33] came to her a unit that came to her and
[1:18:35] taught her how to do that taught her how
[1:18:36] to enter the king's presence because she
[1:18:38] had to recognize it wasn't her authority
[1:18:42] right not here to make something out of
[1:18:43] ourselves we're here to reckon we're
[1:18:45] here to manifest something that's not us
[1:18:48] right
[1:18:49] and
[1:18:51] the um
[1:18:56] the message of the hour in this day here
[1:18:58] you have our chamberlain who's teaching
[1:18:59] us who's clothing us in the word and the
[1:19:01] glory and the authority of god
[1:19:04] this was his whole point right it was
[1:19:06] this is the whole purpose he said he
[1:19:08] came to make the bride ready and so here
[1:19:11] we have who has believed our message to
[1:19:13] whom has the lord revealed his powerful
[1:19:15] arm
[1:19:16] and so
[1:19:17] that is the question that we have
[1:19:20] who's believed the message have you
[1:19:22] believed the message
[1:19:24] have you do you
[1:19:26] right
[1:19:27] do do you do you step out of bed on
[1:19:30] monday morning
[1:19:32] and
[1:19:33] manifest christ in everything that you
[1:19:34] do
[1:19:36] right
[1:19:37] do you
[1:19:38] win
[1:19:39] when the devil comes after your family
[1:19:42] do you put on your crown like esther
[1:19:45] and go before the king
[1:19:48] right or or are you vastly well that's
[1:19:51] not for me and besides i mean who am i
[1:19:53] i'm just some nobody and look at all
[1:19:55] these faults and failures that i have
[1:19:56] and i can't do it
[1:19:58] right
[1:20:00] um
[1:20:02] because
[1:20:03] because that's what the jews did in that
[1:20:06] day
[1:20:07] they failed to recognize where christ
[1:20:08] was in the flesh
[1:20:11] and so the message to believe the
[1:20:13] message actually to believe the message
[1:20:15] the whole purpose and we can stand up i
[1:20:18] i went through this pretty quick
[1:20:20] actually
[1:20:21] um but it's been it's been 45 minutes
[1:20:24] um so we can we can stand the musicians
[1:20:26] come
[1:20:29] um
[1:20:32] [Applause]
[1:20:38] and so
[1:20:40] i guess if i could say anything to to
[1:20:42] close it off
[1:20:44] that going forward to recognize who you
[1:20:46] are to recognize your authority
[1:20:49] to to truly believe the message that you
[1:20:51] are
[1:20:52] christ come again
[1:20:54] right that's who you're supposed to be
[1:20:58] and to to not be
[1:21:01] afraid
[1:21:02] to identify yourself as that and to go
[1:21:05] before the lord and claim what you
[1:21:08] have a right to
[1:21:10] esther had a right to enter that into
[1:21:12] that throne room she might not have felt
[1:21:13] like it at the time but the reality is
[1:21:16] that the king was never going to take
[1:21:17] her head off he couldn't
[1:21:19] right he loved that girl
[1:21:21] and i mean look
[1:21:23] if you paid me
[1:21:24] a million dollars to beat up my wife
[1:21:27] i couldn't do it
[1:21:29] right i mean technically yeah she's this
[1:21:31] tall and not even 100 pounds
[1:21:34] it's not a matter of ability
[1:21:35] it's a matter of i couldn't do it
[1:21:39] and that king yes he had the ability to
[1:21:42] take her head off as soon as she step in
[1:21:43] the door he's not going to do it because
[1:21:45] he loves her
[1:21:47] it's a it's a romance he's looking at
[1:21:49] her and going
[1:21:50] wow
[1:21:52] she's wearing the crown that i gave her
[1:21:54] she liked it that much wow
[1:21:58] like
[1:21:59] doesn't he feel amazing when you reflect
[1:22:02] everything that he poured out on you you
[1:22:04] reflect it back to him and identify him
[1:22:07] in you and say look at what you've done
[1:22:10] for me look at look give glory to god
[1:22:13] because that's what she was wearing she
[1:22:14] was wearing his glory all that the
[1:22:16] jewels and the crown and the royal
[1:22:18] regalia it was a reflection of the glory
[1:22:21] of his glory
[1:22:23] poured out upon her
[1:22:25] it was identifying his magnificence on
[1:22:28] her
[1:22:29] and that's what our lives are to be a
[1:22:31] reflection of his glory not ours but
[1:22:33] when we do that when we reflect his
[1:22:35] glory in everything that we do
[1:22:40] then
[1:22:41] we have we're pleasing to god then we
[1:22:44] can enter his presence and claim
[1:22:45] whatever we have need of and so
[1:22:47] i would say
[1:22:49] if you've believed the message then what
[1:22:52] do you have need of
[1:22:54] what do you need to enter the presence
[1:22:56] of god for what do you need
[1:22:59] what do you need deliverance from
[1:23:02] because it's there do you believe that
[1:23:04] he's in the flesh
[1:23:07] do you believe that you can just enter
[1:23:09] that presence and claim what you need
[1:23:12] and uh if you do
[1:23:14] then do it
[1:23:16] amen that's what we're we'll end it
[1:23:25] [Applause]
[1:23:32] [Music]
[1:23:40] [Music]
[1:23:46] he would pray
[1:23:49] not i will die

[1:25:07] he'd go
[1:25:10] [Music]

[1:25:19] how he came
[1:25:22] so far far from glory
