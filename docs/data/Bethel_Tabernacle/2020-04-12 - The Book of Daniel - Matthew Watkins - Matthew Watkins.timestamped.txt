[0:00] - the Word of God and if you if you
[0:03] study at all any historical commentary
[0:07] and you study commentary from different
[0:10] men who or even just have biblical based
[0:13] literature you read literature that's
[0:14] based on the Bible you'll find that
[0:17] there has been a shift now listen closer
[0:21] I don't want you to lose your hair is
[0:22] this the most important part
[0:23] there's been a shift in the way that
[0:26] biblical scholars of the past and the
[0:29] biblical scholars of today look at the
[0:33] Bible and what you'll find is if you
[0:37] study historical commentary or biblical
[0:39] literature you'll find that the change
[0:41] there's been a change that happened in
[0:43] our generation of the Bible and any
[0:47] literature surrounding the Bible in
[0:49] their attitude towards two categories
[0:52] miracles and prophecy and the way that
[0:57] has that biblical scholars now look at
[1:00] his history our miracles and prophecy is
[1:03] very different than how scholars or
[1:05] commentators of old did it's quite
[1:08] astounding when you really look at it
[1:10] and it's a telltale sign of something
[1:12] very important you see miracles and
[1:15] prophecies in the Bible used to be used
[1:18] as if you take out any miracle or any
[1:21] prophecy that you could name in the
[1:23] Bible Jonah being swallowed by the well
[1:26] Noah and the Ark Daniel and the Lions
[1:28] Den Shadrach and Meshach and Abednego
[1:30] and the fiery furnace where they go into
[1:32] a fire that was seven times hotter and
[1:34] they didn't get burnt not even a hair
[1:36] singe didn't even smell like the fire
[1:39] you take those miracles out of the Bible
[1:42] and miracles and prophecies used to be
[1:45] considered proofs of the inspiration of
[1:48] the Bible and many of you have you read
[1:51] many apologists for the Christian faith
[1:53] they would always used it they would use
[1:55] to look back and say look at the
[1:57] prophecies look at the miracles look at
[1:59] the prophetic things that have happened
[2:01] and and and it's proof that it's a
[2:03] divinely inspired book but it's amazing
[2:06] because nowadays biblical scholars shy
[2:10] away from any miracles speaking of
[2:11] miracles or prophecy
[2:13] in fact prophecy and miracles is
[2:16] considered a handicap in proving the
[2:19] validity of the Bible now in our age you
[2:24] say why is that you know most people
[2:26] today say well you know if you just cut
[2:29] out the miracles and you cut out all the
[2:31] prophecies I could believe a book like
[2:33] the Bible you know instead of instead of
[2:36] helping people to believe it's God's
[2:38] book it actually miracles and prophecies
[2:41] actually now to the modern world they
[2:44] hinder someone from believing the Bible
[2:46] think about this you're just here for a
[2:48] moment
[2:48] now today miracles and prophecies to
[2:51] people in the age we live in they don't
[2:53] help to get someone to understand that
[2:57] it's a divinely burrowed book now let
[2:58] hinders them but actually that's because
[3:00] you say brother Matt why is that because
[3:02] now we live in the scientific age and we
[3:06] live in an age where intellect has
[3:08] became supreme and Jesus said it would
[3:11] be this way that men would be lovers of
[3:13] their own self that's not getting the
[3:17] mirror and looking at your body or
[3:18] looking at your face and oh I'm so
[3:19] handsome and I'm so I'm so pretty if
[3:22] you're a woman the worship of self that
[3:25] Jesus is referring to is this worship
[3:27] the worship of man's thinking are you
[3:32] with me here so it's a scientific age
[3:35] that we live in and people deal with
[3:38] people so you ask how does science how
[3:42] does a scientific intellectual mind I'm
[3:44] talking about Christians here how does
[3:46] how does a scientific educated mind deal
[3:49] with miracles and prophecies well the
[3:53] miracles they treat them as fiction
[3:57] fable and you think I'm you thinking if
[4:00] you think I'm making this up today just
[4:02] go do some of your own study and read
[4:04] some modern biblical theology
[4:07] it's shocking now they have what they
[4:11] call textual variants and they they
[4:13] can't trust in the King James Bible
[4:15] anymore it's unreliable because there's
[4:17] textual variants and they've the NIV has
[4:19] deleted entire verses out of the book of
[4:22] Mark and the Book of Luke
[4:23] and it's a scientific age and they do
[4:26] you say how do they deal with miracles
[4:27] well miracles are just fiction rather
[4:29] than fact rather than an event that took
[4:32] place there these are myths and they
[4:36] category categorize them as tales or
[4:39] legends sort of like you take the the
[4:42] Greek gods of Zeus or they won't were
[4:45] that they were legends and fables you
[4:46] take the story of the Trojan horse or
[4:50] any of those any of those wives tales we
[4:52] call them or fables and this is how they
[4:56] treat they call the myths and legends
[4:58] you know they could say well there there
[5:01] may have been some you know maybe some
[5:03] when you look at the story of Daniel in
[5:05] the lion's den and Shadrach Meshach and
[5:07] Abednego and Jonah you know there may
[5:10] have been some kind of historical truth
[5:12] in them but really the way we should
[5:14] approach them because we're living in
[5:16] the modern age is we need to approach
[5:17] them more as these are just tells these
[5:21] are allegories and they give us good
[5:23] lessons of morality so the Bible can't
[5:27] be used as a historical fact of an event
[5:30] these stories that you read about we're
[5:33] just to glean from the moral of the
[5:37] story they that's how many people treat
[5:42] miracles of the Bible as tells with the
[5:46] moral and they treat prophecies as a
[5:50] record that was inserted after the event
[5:53] took place rather than a revelation that
[5:56] God gave to a prophet now we're
[6:00] sheltered from a lot of this because
[6:01] we're message believers and but and I'm
[6:04] just trying to get you to understand
[6:05] here be thankful for what you have be
[6:08] thankful for the revelation that you
[6:09] have because the entire world is groping
[6:11] in darkness and I'm speaking of the
[6:13] Christian world
[6:15] it's groping in darkness and gross
[6:17] darkness and it doesn't take very much
[6:20] time when I go to study us for a certain
[6:23] verse and I've got I'm weeding through
[6:25] everything the Prophet said about it
[6:27] going through all everything that the
[6:29] word says and if there's maybe some I
[6:30] want to get some added clarity to maybe
[6:33] a certain Greek quarter Hebrew word I go
[6:34] to certain resources that I use as
[6:36] brother branham
[6:37] use those also and we go to some of
[6:39] those resources and it's amazing to me
[6:41] sometimes I start looking at the way
[6:43] almost have to go back to men of a
[6:48] hundred years ago to get any pure
[6:50] thought because now the scientific age
[6:52] is so polluted the minds of men that
[6:56] they they just date a lit-up you face
[6:58] that here in our megachurch here in this
[7:00] city of where they just they they they
[7:03] they they can they they don't look at
[7:06] the biblical prophecies or miracles they
[7:09] say the days of miracles are past that
[7:11] God God's in sundry times spin that in
[7:14] days of past spoke to the prophets but
[7:16] now he's spoken through his son and
[7:17] there's no more apostolic gifts there's
[7:19] no more days of the Apostles is over
[7:21] we're not gonna get bogged down in that
[7:23] but I it's amazing because modern when
[7:28] you look at and what is is modern modern
[7:30] liberals modern liberal scholars who
[7:34] have really infiltrated the church
[7:36] because this was prophecy that this
[7:38] would take place and and they they they
[7:42] take these prophecies and what you find
[7:45] is what's amazing is when you go look at
[7:47] this to get the we're gonna run out of
[7:49] time but I want to get through this
[7:50] first part in particular when you study
[7:54] the Book of Daniel and chapter 11 when
[7:58] you come to Daniel chapter 11 Daniel 11
[8:03] is the most vivid and detailed
[8:07] prophecies concerning future events that
[8:10] we have in the entire Bible there are
[8:12] other prophecies you see the Book of
[8:15] Revelations but the book of Revelation
[8:17] speaks in symbology and symbols and
[8:19] signs that needs interpreted but Daniel
[8:21] 11 go read it Daniel 11 is vivid
[8:26] specific very very very detail specific
[8:32] in fact there's over 200 specific
[8:35] details in Daniel 11 all of which
[8:40] happened centuries after Daniel passes
[8:44] away but all of which happened
[8:48] and you could google it you could go
[8:50] read the history and read the history
[8:51] books they happen centuries later so you
[8:54] say brother Matt what does that mean
[8:55] that either means that this is a book of
[8:57] man who's these are cunningly devised
[9:00] fables and a man has came in here and
[9:02] inserted these events after they took
[9:03] place to make it look like this was a
[9:05] divinely real book it's either that or
[9:07] it's a divinely revealed book and a
[9:10] person has to make that choice I choose
[9:14] to believe it's divinely inspired
[9:16] because the same the same Daniel he
[9:20] understands the prophecy of Jeremiah of
[9:23] 70 years in Babylonian captivity and we
[9:25] know that took place the seventy weeks
[9:27] of Daniel so
[9:30] put it up Isaiah chapter 46 if you don't
[9:34] if it's not ready that's fine but verse
[9:36] 9 and verse 10 notice what God says this
[9:39] is this is the this is why men have a
[9:40] log jam because they don't understand
[9:43] this about God Isaiah chapter 46 and
[9:46] verse 9 it says remember he says the
[9:50] former things of old for I am God not
[9:53] man that's what man tends to forget for
[9:55] I am God and there is none else I am God
[10:00] and there is none like me verse 10 he
[10:03] says in the next verse for the gorge he
[10:06] says declaring the end from the
[10:08] beginning and from ancient times the
[10:11] things that are not yet done saying my
[10:13] counsel shall stand and I will do all my
[10:16] pleasure it's amazing to me how many of
[10:19] these people who look at this with this
[10:21] scientific modern approach even
[10:23] Christian scholars and they treat
[10:25] miracles and prophecies of the Bible in
[10:27] such a humanistic way but somehow they
[10:30] still want to keep the Bible somehow
[10:34] they still want to believe in the by
[10:35] which they just be honest and throw the
[10:38] whole thing out because if this is if
[10:39] any of this is man then all of it needs
[10:42] to be thrown out it's got to either be
[10:45] all God or none of God are you or your
[10:49] entire paradigm of God falls apart
[10:52] you got me and so well you know you can
[10:57] you can keep the moral and spiritual
[10:59] benefits from all those stores you don't
[11:00] have to believe that they were literal
[11:02] you could just keep all the moral and
[11:04] spiritual values and and and and just
[11:07] cut out all the miracles and keep the
[11:08] you know just they say just live by the
[11:10] Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the
[11:11] Mount I'm a good person that's all
[11:13] anything it's amazing how people will
[11:14] take that but they don't believe in
[11:15] miracles and prophecy they'll cut and
[11:18] splice and take portions of it because
[11:20] it fits into their historical
[11:22] understanding of Jesus but when you
[11:25] believe in miracles and prophecies you
[11:27] believe that he's the same yesterday
[11:28] today and forever and then that means
[11:32] you have to make a change in your life
[11:34] and people don't want to make changes
[11:39] you know what people can't believe in
[11:42] miracles and prophecy
[11:44] cuz they don't really believe in God
[11:48] because if they really believed in God
[11:51] they believed the scripture would is
[11:52] read in Isaiah but people they have no
[11:55] trouble except in a historical Sunday
[11:57] school Jesus they just have a log jam
[12:00] when you try to make him present today
[12:02] and relevant today right difference
[12:06] between religion and Revelation so
[12:09] there's a built-in reluctance in every
[12:11] human being there's something that's
[12:13] built into your system to accept
[12:16] anything to accept it to to agree with
[12:19] it with anything that's in a
[12:21] supernatural dimension now you're saved
[12:23] born by the Spirit of God and now you
[12:25] you it's part of your sixth sense you
[12:27] accept it but the fallen man the
[12:28] intellectual man how you were born you
[12:31] have a built-in reluctant reluctance or
[12:34] repelled it towards anything
[12:36] supernatural or understanding or
[12:39] believing anything or accepting anything
[12:41] in a supernatural dimension it's not
[12:43] just you look at scientism and it
[12:45] believes that we live in a closed planet
[12:48] and and a closed system and the only
[12:51] thing the only reality is that which can
[12:53] be put in the test tube and tested or
[12:56] taken with instruments and observed
[12:58] that's how science thinks they believe
[13:00] the only reality is what can be tests
[13:02] that are investigated so man always has
[13:05] a reluctance to believe in the
[13:07] supernatural now let's go to the book
[13:10] before we run out of time here Daniel
[13:12] the book of Daniel is in two halves two
[13:17] halves it's split into two halves and
[13:19] the first half of the Book of Daniel is
[13:23] mainly mostly all miracles
[13:26] and then the second half of Daniel the
[13:30] first half is chapter 1 through chapter
[13:32] 6 it's mostly all miracles and then the
[13:37] second half of Daniel chapter 7 through
[13:40] 12 is mostly all prophecy so you have
[13:45] these two categories in the Book of
[13:46] Daniel miracles and prophecy that's why
[13:48] people who don't believe in miracles are
[13:50] believed in prophecy they don't know
[13:52] what to do with the Book of Daniel
[13:54] because it's all miracles and prophecy
[13:57] the whole book is miracles in prophecy
[13:59] Daniel
[14:00] well Daniel was new you know Daniel the
[14:01] lines in yet happened but the lines had
[14:03] been fed you know right before Daniel
[14:05] went in there right and and so they they
[14:12] have a state they can't understand so I
[14:14] want I wanted this bring this here
[14:16] because it's so awesome to look at the
[14:18] first so the first if you read Daniel
[14:20] the first six chapters of Daniel are
[14:23] very easy to understand whereas the
[14:25] second half the last chapters are what
[14:28] you wouldn't even be more difficult to
[14:30] understand we all know the first six
[14:32] from sunday-school but most people are
[14:34] not familiar with the last six
[14:36] so the second seven to twelve are what
[14:40] we would call harder most people don't
[14:41] know it can't understand now some
[14:43] interesting facts this is amazing when I
[14:45] got to looking at this here and I won't
[14:47] get time to even get into it chapter as
[14:51] we said chapters 1 through 6 or mostly
[14:53] miracles chapter 7 through 12 is mostly
[14:56] prophecies now what's amazing is that
[14:59] chapters 1 through 6 are written in the
[15:02] third person chapter one through six
[15:05] Daniel he Daniel said and Daniel went
[15:09] and dent they're written in the third
[15:10] person
[15:11] but chapter 7 through 12 says I Daniel
[15:14] so the first six chapters are third
[15:18] person the last our first person Daniel
[15:21] I Daniel so you say for the Matt words
[15:24] that means it means the first six
[15:25] chapters are all about him and the
[15:29] second half is all by him so it's from
[15:33] Daniel so the first half of the Book of
[15:36] Daniel is everything that happens in
[15:38] Daniels life the second half of day of
[15:41] the Book of Daniel is everything that's
[15:43] going to happen after Daniels life
[15:46] prophecy and so some of it as we said
[15:50] has happened already a lot of it has
[15:53] happened already some of it is yet to
[15:55] come the first half is present the
[15:57] second half is future all history the
[16:01] most but you know the moment one of the
[16:03] most unusual differences that I found
[16:05] that's amazing is that the first half
[16:09] the first six
[16:10] chapters that you read in this book the
[16:13] first six chapters of this book and the
[16:17] second half so you have chapters you
[16:19] have chapter one through six and chapter
[16:21] seven through twelve and the first now
[16:24] you gotta listen closest this is going
[16:26] to confuse you you got two halves the
[16:28] first half the second half what's
[16:30] amazing is that the first chapter of the
[16:34] first half is written in the language of
[16:37] Hebrew the last five chapters of the
[16:41] first half is written in the language of
[16:43] Aramaic now when you go to the second
[16:47] half the first chapter is written in
[16:49] Aramaic and the last five are in Hebrew
[16:52] so it's not just as simple as dividing
[16:55] two halves there's actually something
[16:56] unique you see Aramaic was the was the I
[17:00] forget what they call that but it's the
[17:01] mother tongue it's the world it's the
[17:03] it's the tongue that everyone spoke
[17:05] Aramaic was the common language it was
[17:08] the one that everyone understood whereas
[17:11] the Hebrew tongue was only a selected
[17:13] people could understand that language so
[17:17] what does it say it says that there were
[17:20] certain portion wood tells me that there
[17:21] are certain portions of the book that
[17:23] was for the entire world to understand
[17:25] and to read and then there were certain
[17:28] parts Daniel wrote only for the Hebrews
[17:32] see for the mat what is that
[17:34] significance because there's certain
[17:35] portions of this book that the whole
[17:37] church world could see but then there's
[17:39] another language it's written in that
[17:41] only the bride can understand and so it
[17:48] tells you where the chapters were meant
[17:49] to be read they were both they were
[17:51] directed towards two classes or two
[17:54] different groups so you can tell which
[17:56] parts are meant to be read widely and
[17:58] understood and which parts now let's get
[18:00] to some historical background in the
[18:02] last two minutes by the kid I'm hurryin
[18:04] give me two minutes
[18:05] the historical background is Babylon we
[18:09] know that city very well what's
[18:12] important to understand is that the
[18:14] children of Israel when they were taken
[18:16] out of the promised land and brought
[18:19] into captivity in exile they were not
[18:21] all taken in one time we
[18:23] taught on this before we're gonna cover
[18:24] it here again it's important the they
[18:27] were not all taken at one time but they
[18:31] were they they they were in exile they
[18:35] weren't taking all at the same time and
[18:37] they also were not brought back to
[18:39] Jerusalem at that we're all together so
[18:42] when you read if you study the records
[18:43] carefully in the books of Ezra and
[18:45] Nehemiah and you read about Zerubbabel
[18:47] and Ezra and Nehemiah when you read them
[18:49] carefully you'll understand that they
[18:51] were taken in three different
[18:53] deportations three different times and
[18:55] they come back also in three different
[18:58] returns there's three different returns
[19:01] but the total number that comes back to
[19:04] Jerusalem is much smaller than the total
[19:06] number that went to Babylon and in fact
[19:11] they left behind when it was all said
[19:13] and done they left behind a massive
[19:14] Jewish community in Babylon that never
[19:16] returned only up until a few years ago
[19:19] until recently there was a community
[19:22] Jewish community in in what we would
[19:25] call modern Babylon now we know there's
[19:27] a reason for that it's all prophetic
[19:29] it's all it's all part of Israel
[19:31] becoming a homeland becoming a nation
[19:32] again but notice in the times of Daniel
[19:36] they don't all come back together
[19:37] there's three different trips and
[19:40] there's also three different
[19:42] deportations so historically in these
[19:45] numbers you can write down the first
[19:48] deportation was in 606 it was the we
[19:52] call it the top layer of society it was
[19:54] all of the important people all of the
[19:56] nobles all of the key people and among
[19:59] that first deportation was some young
[20:02] men four of them Shadrach Meshach
[20:06] Abednego and Daniel and all four of
[20:10] these young men go back in that first
[20:13] deportation and these were these were
[20:16] these were outstanding excellent men of
[20:20] excellence Daniel was there was a reason
[20:22] why he gets to Babylon and he's
[20:23] successful because he was a man of
[20:25] excellence now we're gonna we're out of
[20:27] time here today so we're just gonna put
[20:28] a pause put the break let's stand to our
[20:30] feet eleven o'clock got a stop there
[20:33] Lord Jesus we thank you Father for this
[20:36] teaching this morning
[20:37] we ask Lord that you would bless the
[20:39] remainder of the service the singing
[20:41] Lord the worship father the ministry of
[20:43] your word may you to speak to us this
[20:45] morning we ask by your word in Jesus
[20:47] name
[21:14] you
