[Music] so verily verily I say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall live for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself and has given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man Marvel not at this for the hours coming in which all that are in the grave shall hear his voice and they shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of them Nation now over in first Thessalonians 4 16 you don't have to turn but very familiar for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord well I'm longing for that day aren't you may God added blessings you can have your seats for a title this morning I want to speak on listening for The Voice of the Resurrection brother Branham said and hear his voice so many things to dull the senses of the people today but in the midst of all of that in spite of every dueling dulling in every voice that's in the world today some of them pleasure voices some of them sinful voices to lure the people but in spite of every bit of that the truth of God Still Remains he that will hear my voice and come after me men and women who will hear the voice of God God still wants to speak to every individual that will open their ears to hear the voice don't you never get too busy but what you can stay in the presence and listen for his voice God always keeps his word no matter how bad times may be it don't matter how bad this world is getting it's like I said the prayer all hell is broke loose upon this Earth all the stress and strains of what's going on today the pressures of the world the voices that we're hearing out here political voices I mean our leaders we don't need to be listed his voice he don't even know what he's saying half the time it's the truth you said look at him you're like what's he trying to say I was going to add there's some ministers so-called ministers they're preaching the poor pitch you're sitting here wondering what are they saying we'll move on from that anyway but all kinds of voices that we're listening to when all the chaos and Hell breaking loose they're still the voice of God is one to speak to us oh voices of men is saying this message is not right look the voice of the devil uh voices saying you do too tired to go to church I've heard that voice a few times but there's only one voice when he'd be listening to this morning and that's the voice of Jesus Christ are you listening oh you could tell what voice you listen to by the way you act Hallelujah brother because he said Jesus Christ is still willing to speak that still Small Voice to anybody that will listen for him he is still ready to do it if we'll just quieten ourselves listen to his still Small Voice every one of you people who profess to be Christians set yourselves quiet before him don't let the Washington hinder sisters don't let the work hinder Brothers don't let nothing hinder don't let nobody know what you're doing just go before him and get the woods somewhere get out on the side of the road go into your secret closet and close the door when the kids are at school then get down on your knees you've heard all kinds of voices everywhere but just get down and stay there until those voices are silenced and you begin to lift up it'll change you it'll make you different it'll make you what you should be it'll make you the kind of Christian you ought to be Hallelujah but we find we're too busy we're always on the go running to and fro I say my next door neighbors are probably wanting the world because we're constantly in and out of our garage leaving all day long constantly on the go busy people that's the that's the age we live in we'll come to church we're so wore out from the cares of life from the stress and strains of the world what we need to do is come in that back door this place should be a place of Refuge we leave all the cares out there behind that door don't worry they'll be there when you get there when you walk back out you pick them up take them back home with you but for a moment for an hour or two times a week that's all leave your cares out there let's get it here where we're not so so weighted down with the cares of this world we can hear God speaking Hallelujah but it depends on what voice you're listening to depends on your final destination here in the scripture we just read that all it's in the grave will hear the voice of God whether you're lost or saved you're going to hear that voice one day some to life most to judgment wow goodness what is the voice of the Resurrection or who is this voice of the Resurrection you know who speaks to you this morning it's not me I'm sorry Adam heard the voice of God in the garden he talked to God the way it was intended to he was in constant fellowship with him God would come down in the cool of evening God would come down and have church with Adam God's come down this morning to have church with us he's standing right here all he wants to do for you to just open up your ears take a spiritual Q-tip clean out your ears this morning or you can hear God speaking to you he wants to hear you all right what happened Adam and Eve started listening to the voice of the devil God left them don't be listening No Lie of the devil we're not like Eve this second Eve ain't gonna listen No Lie of the devil we don't even need to be talking to him we don't need to be listened to what he has to say because it's nothing but lies Hallelujah there's only one voice are you listening for him he's not hearing all kinds of noise he's not here on a preacher it preaches loud even though he'll use it he'll use even the smallest people the quietest people when a man of God Gets behind this Pulpit a true called man of God it's God speaking to you Hallelujah if a man hears a voice of something and he's proven to be the voice of God and on time and that proceeds forth from the man heavens and earth will pass away but this word will can't pass away when God spoke it it's going to come to pass Elijah had a great Victory on Mount Carmel when under the anointing he had a prophets of a bale killed ran and hidden a cave when anointing left him God come to want to speak to him God said stand up like a man I'm going to say something to you earthquake come by we ain't come by and blow the rocks out think I'm fire God wouldn't need none of it God just come to him in a still small voice and spoke breath said big noises idiot attract a prophet Prophet didn't care about the big noises and when he heard that still Small Voice he knew that was the word we hear that still small voice today we know that's the word he says you know when I've seen this yesterday I was like wow the Sun can draw more water in 15 minutes without any noise at all we make more noise drawn out a gallon of water water then the sun does in a million barrels it's quiet it's quiet good you're quiet maybe you hear God Speak maybe you hear that still small voice but we're always looking for something that's big a lot of hooray a lot of Racket to it but it wasn't in the earthquake or the wind of the fire God spoke to him in a still small voice we've had our Thunder in the Pentecost we've had our thundering of God sent a prophet God speaks and Thunders God speaks enlightening but he also likes to speak in quietness in that still small voice you used to hear people say God spoke to me today and you're like you're waiting with the Audible Voice I've never heard the Ottawa voice of God some of these might have I hear him in that still Small Voice the quietness if I could get myself quiet enough the kind of person I am I can't get still long enough God just about has to shake you calm down a minute so I can speak to you I'm not along in that has longer we're listening to the things around us we can't hear him it's that still small voice sometimes we drown it out guilty where this is all kinds of voices voices of the man it's a Pulpit voices of TV evangelists that's who you were listening to One Day you're listening to denominational voices but one day you stumbled into a message Church and you heard the voice of God you like something is real this church has something real I've got something real you heard something different You Heard a Voice through the man it's a Pulpit and that voice came from eternity and called you out there's a voice drawing you know which voice are you listening to this scripture we read in John chapter 5 verse 28 29. that's the voice of the Resurrection there's two resurrections at the end once for the bride and the others for the entire race but notice in this verse 28 is not to the bride it's to the world the Rapture has already took place but this takes but this happens we're already at the marriage supper toward the end of it we're going into the Millennium and at the end of the millennium that's when this takes place John 5 25 says verily verily I say unto you the hours coming and now is that the Dead how many were dead we were dead in our sins and trespasses when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of God have you heard his voice if you hadn't heard his voice if you're still dead in sin listen real close he's calling you he's calling the voice of the Resurrection he wants to resurrect your dead body and bring you to life this morning they that hear shall live Hallelujah when it happens the pride is already gone well proof brother Brown says in a church age book I should have said Church age book A lot of people don't like that book he's wrote by a man they said the question now arrives why are these righteous ones in the judgment there is no no come up for there but two resurrections since they could not qualify for the first resurrection they must come up in the second which is the resurrection to judgment the one who's qualified for the first resurrection the bride Brother JD we're pre-qualified you know you get these little things in the mail you've been pre-qualified for this credit card oh you get all excited five thousand dollars you fill it out turn it in sorry you didn't qualify but we got a pre-qualification this is a hundred percent qualification we were the back part of God's mind before the foundation of the world we were pre-qualified before the world ever began there's no devil in hell could take that from you Hallelujah that name can never be removed qualified for the rapture you might walk around in your flesh you're wondering if I'd I don't feel it I don't feel it but just remember you've been pre-qualified you're going to come to it the bride is not in the judgment Jesus must had yet another group in mind who had a certain Resurrection will receive eternal life they will receive it at the resurrection not previously received it as a member of the Bride John 5 28 29 Marvel not at this for the hours coming at which all is in the grave shall hear his voice John 5 28 29 is not the rapture for only the dead in Christ will rise from the graves at that time along with the living bride which is still on the earth first Thessalonians 4 16. and 17. I read it this but it says in John 5 28 29 that are going to come forth from the grave you're coming forth if you die Christian or you die lost you're coming forth the day is going to be brought before the Lord and judged Hallelujah whose names were not in the Book of Life and then they're going to be cast into the Lake of Fire do you recognize the voice of God Jesus says my sheep knows my voice and a stranger they won't follow you have heard the voice of God you won't be fought in any other voices no other voice will you follow Hallelujah if you hear the voice of God today you're a sheep what are you if you don't hear the voice of God you're a goat I don't know why I put that in there but that sounds pretty good if you're just a lamb but you you might be a lamb but you still haven't heard the shepherd's voice yet he's calling listen listen for him are you quiet enough where you can hear it listen for that still small voice and a stranger they will not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers it's like your dog you'll go in the door and hey little boy he come running like you has he'll run from them that's why we need to do the devil he's trying to talk to you just turn around and run from him I know this I ain't brother Jace I'm sorry you just got stuck with me this morning sometimes we talk to the devil what do we do God only time God hears from some of us is when we uh pray over our food bless his food in Jesus name or if we go to bed oh I hadn't prayed today you lay your head on the pillar father forgive me in my sins and you're gone I'm gonna hide behind this pulpit guilty guilty Don't Be Afraid raise your hands are you guilty of this when you speak to God more the more we speak to God the more he's going to speak to us lay aside the cares of the world listen for the voice of God but there's a voice calling us to judgment I don't want to be called to judgment because there's a voice calling people to judgment it don't matter how old you are Mason youngest person in here probably not Mason but whoever you are to the oldest person well JD you'll hear the voice of God he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall never come into condemnation if he's called you this morning happy we should be you should be up and running around the building God's called you Hallelujah oh we'll sit in church Time After Time and we from the pulpit and hear about getting your life to God I heard that last Wednesday no doubt I heard it again Wednesday and next Sunday I've got time no we don't when I was a young person we had all kinds of time we thought we was told we young people Brother John the Lord's coming tomorrow could be the last day laughs we got serious oh Lord I give my heart to you you young people now you hear the same thing the Lord's coming it could be tomorrow the voice of the Resurrection could call you tomorrow morning are you ready are you ready if you're not ready let's get ready if you're a seed of God you're not ready would you please come on because we know the prophets say when that last seed comes in we're gone I'm tired of this world how many is tired of this world come back it's time to come to god let's leave this place I don't like it here do you know that the voice of God is speaking through the ministers and there's only Doom if you ignore it Hallelujah brother Graham said voice of many Waters what do these Waters represent the water represents multitudes and people and tongues voice what a horrible thing of life no pilate to guide him loose floating with the tides to hear the Roar of a great cataracts I could hear him when he's preaching this wished I could do it like he did to hear the Roar of the Greek cataracts the falls what a horrible thing it would be to a soul drifting voice of many Waters what is this voice it's the Judgment it's the voice of the ministers through the Holy Spirit cried out to the people in every age standing there the voice of many Waters crying out he says what it'll be know that you set in these meetings and heard that you should get right with God and receive the Holy Ghost and a drifting soul to hear the voice speak out in that meeting that you set in and heard the judgments of God preached and refused it the great fall is ahead of you the great cataracts to take you to your Eternal Doom wow I'm not looking for no Doom that's not my destination my destination is heaven we're in this world but we're not part of it we're going home soon very soon voice of the Resurrection or the voice of damnation which one will you hear when it takes place Jesus came down took on flesh died for our sins took the whip upon his back for us sacrifice for you but all we do we'll just go around and play Church what a serious thing that God done for you and we'll just come in churches my hand it's only 10 after 12. he's still got 50 more minutes bro Jason stops at one we need to listen listen we're in Rapture mode it's time to drop the things of the world we need to quit acting and looking like it you're going to be in judgment Hall one day we're all going to be up there when the Judgment takes place but depend on what voice you're listening to today it's depending on which side you're gonna stand on are you going to be around God in his throne will you be the group in front oh yes there's people in front that's going to receive eternal life why do you want to be that one take the chance just in case I was wrong God calling some has heard the voices of resurrections other will hear the voice of damnation and then we cast it to the Lake of Fire and brother you don't want to be there one of these days is going to give you your final call and then the door is going to be closed between mercy and judgment don't be left out get in now while you can don't pay no attention get into Christ let's talk about his vision he had to be on the curtain of time where you've seen young people and he says when I knew I had to return back there was only one thing that I would return to there's a way he said one thing I would return back to you for is to tell you people don't miss it whatever you do don't miss it you can't afford it everything else that everything else go my amen help me Lord and make ready for that whatever you do The Voice the resurrection is going to cause many Moses heard it Moses acted on it I am that I am go down to Egypt Saul heard it on the road to Damascus he was predestinated he heard the voice of God God changed him around changed his name when you hear the voice of God calling you you get a name King we were called Miss Baptists Miss Catholic whatever denomination you come out of we were called Miss message oh Hallelujah we were called all kinds of names but we heard the voice of God we had a name change we're now Mrs Jesus Christ Hallelujah Paul's life was changed just like yours were you didn't have a care in the world you were out surfing brother Travis one day God got a hold of you you heard that voice you might have been in a bar room somewhere I've heard sometimes when people get drunk they start talking about Jesus maybe one day you were drunk by talking to him what a life I live Lord and he started speaking back to you and changed your life forever you were once drunk on the things of the world you're still drunk this morning yeah you're can drinking from the Fountain of Life Hallelujah somewhere down the inside was a predestinated sea given to you from the foundation of the world foreign and it came to life you weren't expecting it you never respect it you weren't looking for God a lot of people say I was looking for God no you weren't you were happy in your sins is that brother Diggs we were happy in our sins but one day Hallelujah God Yanks you up called you Hallelujah I'm hurrying Lazarus heard the voice of the Resurrection he was a real dead man Lazarus house was a place according to the prophet that Jesus would stop and rest from his preaching Lazarus was a good friend of Jesus I am too Lord we're told Lazarus was a scribe when Jesus was baptized Lazarus started falling he was a bosom friend to Lazarus so his house was a place that Jesus liked to go and rest from all his healing campaigns and preaching Jesus felt comfortable there in his house does he feel comfortable in your home foreign but Jesus had to leave he knew there was supposed to be a miracle take place he knew Lazarus was going to get sick and he knew if he was there he would have to heal him but he wanted a greater testimony so Jesus left and when Jesus leaves your home you know Barbara said about it the devil likes to come in well forget about Jesus sometimes we'll just put him over on a corner forget who he is how many here would invite me over to your house and put me over in a chair and don't even talk to me brother Aaron that's one so why do we do Jesus that way we want Jesus be the god of our home but we don't even talk to him say your preaching real slow today I'm trying to be like Brother JD he says great things when he's ghosts when he goes slow we don't even read our Bibles every day like we should I got a mirror it's okay I'm right here looking at myself and I'm praying and preaching I mean we wonder why we don't have no more move of God in our life if I say anything wrong bro Jason will be here Wednesday straight me out but when Jesus leaves your home expect trouble to hit what kind of homes we have if Jesus had preeminence if you let Jesus be the god of it if you put him first what kind of homes will we have is Jesus comfortable enough in your heart where you can say go to the refrigerator God my favorite Cherry Pepsi drinks in there go ahead and get it here here Lord sit right here in my favorite chair Hallelujah man but this case they did nothing wrong Lazarus and his sisters but God want to be glorified Jesus tarried Lazarus got sick Jesus tarried they sent free word to Jesus no answer day two Jesus your friend Lazarus is sick he's trying to work on Jesus's emotion didn't come finally Lazarus died how many here if you called up brother Jason to come pray for you in a hospital he didn't come that probably hurt your feelings yeah I'm gonna find somewhere else to go he don't care no more for me than that can you imagine what Martha and Mary were thinking they didn't know that in a little bit they was going to hear that voice of the Resurrection Hallelujah we don't know but in a little bit we're going to hear the voice of the Resurrection they were in a time of delay Jesus was delaying they were in the time of delay no answer if you're sick this morning you've been praying for a long time and you're in that time of delay don't worry God knows the voice of the Resurrection is coming it's been a miracle Jesus has stayed healed Lazarus it would have been it had been a greater Miracle when he can call him forth from the tomb Jesus comes on his own time he knows the best for us when you see you're at your ropes in hold on God knows what he's doing are you going to be like Joe though God slay me yet I'll trust him do you trust him through all things through everything Mary and Martha had reached their end their dad mom was gone now their brother was gone what were they going to do they left their Church to follow Jesus and Jesus wouldn't know where to be found they left for him but he wouldn't come for them Battle of the mind they were thinking I thought he loved us but I tell you as long as you have Jesus you're never alone you young people you don't have friends out here you say I don't have no friends but you got the best friend that man could ever have in the Lord Jesus Christ John 11 17 Jesus came and he found he laid in the graves four days already Bethany was nine to Jerusalem about 15 furlongs about two miles and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sit still in the house then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou Hast been here my brother had not died she had faith but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it to thee pause Jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha said unto him I know he'll rise again in the resurrection of the last day she wasn't looking for it Jesus said unto her but oh I am the resurrection dead yet shall he live Hallelujah the same I am that came to Moses in the burning bush that same one and spoke let there be light it's the same one that said I am the resurrection and the life and whosoever liveth and Believes In Me shall never die love this question Beretta said thy brother shall rise again she said yes Lord I know the Jews believed in a general Resurrection said I know Lord he'll raise the last days as a general Resurrection he was a good boy I know he'll raise up watch him he says there's no beauty that we should desire him let alone skinny guy Jesus was he wasn't a great big Priestly looking fella he was a skinny fella and he straightened his little frame up and said can you imagine you see Jesus straight his little Frame Up I have the resurrection and the life what Hallelujah he that believeth on me though he did yes I live and Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews also weeping which came into hurt he grown and his Spirit was troubled this is where have you lady they said unto the Lord come and see and then Jesus wept he's a man he wept he was a man when he's in a boat asleep but when a storm rose up he was God when he said peace be still he was a man when he walks up to the tomb of Lazarus he wept like a man he cried Jesus says take you away the stone Martha and the sister of him that was dead unto him Lord but by this time my sin stinks for he had been dead four days I found this interesting I've tried to find it brother JD I can't I don't know where I got it this is four days the rabbis taught that the spirit wandered about for three days seeking readmission into the body but abandoned it on the fourth day my opinion take it as it is my opinion I believe that's why Jesus waited there'd be no doubt this man's dead that his Lazarus Spirit was already gone towards his destination Lazarus had been dead four days skin worms has started to destroy his flesh and his nose caved in but it was time for a body change it's time for a body change I need one the voice of the Resurrection was going to speak and Lazarus body was going to change it's just like Abraham and Sarah they were old too old to have any children they had a body change when God said it's time the king of the Philistines looked at Sarah he was a young man why would he want a 90 year old grandma unless she was changed foreign why would God want to own the crepey little bride walking around here feeble walking around with swollen ankle gray hair no hair but we've got to be changed that voice is going to speak to us and we're going to be changed Hallelujah the real you bursting forth out of these bodies from the dust and will be like job though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God Jesus says roll away the stone he told these two sisters roll away the stone you see these two little frail women over here trying to roll away this big old stone but they had something to do if they want to receive something Hallelujah if you're needing to overcome a sin that seems to be hanging on it's time to roll Wick back that stone you've got to do it God ain't going to come down and roll it back for you if you want to hear a voice of the Resurrection roll back the stone roll back the stone of unbelief roll back the stone of the things of this world you need Deliverance roll back your stone of rock and roll back the stone of watching things you shouldn't roll the stone away the stone that's in your way is a fear of Who You Are afraid of it of it you've got to roll it away you gotta put your back into it roll that thing away from you you want to hear the voices of Resurrection get rid of the Stone what do you have need of is it healing roll that sickness Stone away from you Hallelujah Martha Mary they came to the stone it stunk so bad behind it you can imagine smelling rotten flesh can you smell can you imagine the smell that goes up to God's nostrils of us of our stinking flesh they struggled they got it done you may struggle with this Stone you might not get the mood the first time it might not even budge but keep at it maybe God wants to see your sincerity It's Time It's Time Lord I want this Stone out of my way I've got to have the strength to do it you've got to make an effort it doesn't matter how bad your sin smells you've got to want to be delivered from it I want the people that they thought Jesus standing there tell these two women to roll back that Big Stone in the absolute great message he went down to the Grave there stood a man there stood God in flesh that could have said to that stone dissolve and it were dissolved but he said to them Little Women them Poor Little Women they're little young women take away the stone you've got something to do and they wrote away the stone and it made them sick it was so stinky Jesus stood there so stoop shouldered perhaps turning gray when he was not yet 30 years old and the Bible says he might have looked like 40 or 50. you're a man not over 50 years old and you say you've been and you say you've seen Abraham before Abraham I was I am and we come to find out here he stood by the grave and he know that a vision had to strike he knew it had to be take away the stone he was stinking wrapped in Gray clothes and been dead for four days his nose had already caved in there he stood there straightened his little body I have the resurrection in the life and he that believeth on me though he were dead yes shall he live tell me a man that could ever make a statement like that whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth to all this where have you laid him he says down he went to the Grave weeping like a man and when he got down there what did he say now do you when you get there you got something to do too you know take you away the stone if you want to see a miracle you sick people tonight if you want to see a miracle take away the stone take away that stone that sin that lays before the door you say Brother Bear I don't do nothing but if you don't believe it it can't happen take away the stone of unbelief and watch what happens just take away a stone and we shall obey the word of the Lord she saw a miracle [Music] there was another Stone wrote away one day another Resurrection it was Jesus Christ it was his turn to be raised from the dead the voice of the Resurrection rising up from his grave two women was going to that grave two women was going to that grave but this time they're going to bring spices I guess they thought they were going to roll the stone back and go in and anoint the body of Jesus but when they got there there was no stone to be moved the voice of the Resurrection spoke that stone moved the voice of the Resurrection is going to speak and each one of us is going to move when God speaks things happen when he said let there be light it happened when he says you're going to be healed it's going to happen when God speaks Miracles take place we've seen it happen preachers pray for you when you're sick and you turn and you walk out of here you're healed Hallelujah another quote this is probably the best one action in the life and he that believeth in me though he were yes shall he live he says speak omnipotence miraculous will take place and he always does it at the junction and we're at the junction blr when you see these things happening we're at the end time all beneficent speaks and a dead man lived again stood on his feet and went to a banquet he supper with him what happened oh my what happened some glorious day all we who are once dead in sin and trespasses omnipotence we were going to hell omnipotent spoke Hallelujah we've raised from hell to glory and someday we'll be a banquet supper at the last days speaks God's word is omnipotent we believe it and raised from Death unto life he that heareth my words and Believes In Me though he were dead yet shall he live omnipotence we're like Noah he says building away on the ark the miraculous will take place someday when the Rapture comes and Jesus comes we're at The Junction now when you see these things happen raise up your head your Redemption is drawing now omnipotence speaks and miraculous is done but you got to know the person of The Voice God I have the personal voice living down on the inside in order to hear the voice of the Resurrection with that same voice he'll call out the Saints Matthew 27 50 Jesus said when he cried out with a loud voice yelled it up the ghost he said it is finished he didn't say he was dead he just said it is finished the work that I came to do is finished and behold the veil of the temple was red and Twain From the top to the bottom and the Earth did quake and the Rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies which slept a rose and came out of the Graze of the resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many the second Exodus foreign our pastor preaching on it that's the second Exodus The Godly men of the Old Testament Jacob says when I died take me over there and bury me in the land Joseph when he died says when you leave here and you're going to take me bury with my fathers they knew when the resurrection was going to take place they knew where the voice was going to come to where the voice was going to speak oh brother sister today we don't have to go to Israel we don't have to go to Israel to hear the voice of the Resurrection the voice of the Resurrection is going to come to us it's coming to us we're going to be in the right place as well the right place at the right time first Thessalonians 4 13. I missed something let me get this first Lazarus we didn't email the gray did we he's still dead God when he was Jesus when the man walked up and wept stood straight up when he spoke his name hey Lazarus come forth to call for Lazarus you had to have a big voice because Lazarus was on a four-day Journey that voice of the Resurrection had a stream for him Lazarus cut forth it didn't take four days for that Spirit to get back into Lazarus immediately here he come out of the Tomb unwrap him no we're going to hear that voice Bride come forth Hallelujah but I would not have you be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep if I die which I was told the other night that I'm old somebody made a comment said 60 is super old I'm only 51 so I'm pretty old foreign if I die before you young Brothers and the Rapture takes place I'm coming up first so don't be a sure you're gonna be called first Hallelujah and if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so then which also sleep

come and get the rest of us Hallelujah for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself out of Sin from heaven with the shout the message with the voice of the archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord called up we're going to be pulled up we're going to be seized God's going to take us by force the big gravity arm of God is just going to sleep over us like a big magnet and lift us off the Earth the voice of the Resurrection that quickening power coming to the grave of job where there wasn't even a spoonful of dust of his bones left and he went back and turn back to gas of the Earth but yet when that quick according to the word of God to the promise hundreds hundreds just out here when that quick power was brought forth from the grave job Abraham Isaac Jacob all of them came out of the grave with him you say well I wished I lived it is Verona says wait a minute first Thessalonians 4 16. he said I want you to read that I'm not going to have you in there brother concern that he's asleep sorry not even as those have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again for the third day and not make believe but we believe him even so then that speak to him shall God bring the new test was Saints with that quickening power amen shall resurrect also at the second coming just
