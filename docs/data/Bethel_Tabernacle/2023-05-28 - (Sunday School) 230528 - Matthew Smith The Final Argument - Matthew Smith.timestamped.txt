[0:00] um king over France and he commissioned
[0:02] a bunch of cannons, right? Commissioned
[0:04] he was building up his army,
[0:05] commissioned a bunch of cannons and
[0:06] across the the breach of the cannon he
[0:09] had inscribed
[0:10] um
[0:12] uh ultima ratio regium which for those
[0:15] of you who don't know Latin means the
[0:17] final argument of the king. Okay. So
[0:21] what this king is saying is
[0:24] when people come before me to have legal
[0:26] disputes, this duke over here has some
[0:28] claim to a land and this lord over here
[0:30] is a counter claim and they're arguing
[0:31] and this that and the other and I give a
[0:33] decree. No, this is the judgment. People
[0:35] can sit here and keep arguing, but at
[0:37] the end of the day, if they don't obey
[0:38] what I said, we're going to have a line
[0:40] of cannons about it, right? Like you can
[0:43] make all your arguments all you want and
[0:45] you can have your documents and your
[0:47] legal dispute,
[0:49] but that's not going to stop a 18lb
[0:51] cannonball screaming through the air at
[0:53] several hundred feet per second. It's
[0:55] just not going to happen. You know, like
[0:56] at some point you just have to accept
[1:00] that this is the reality.
[1:02] And
[1:05] so this is just something that I've
[1:07] known since I was a kid. And and when I
[1:09] you know that that little history story
[1:11] and
[1:14] you know when I was struggling with all
[1:15] this you know like Lord how do you how
[1:17] do I know that you're real? How do I
[1:18] know the message is real? How do I know
[1:19] all these things? What's what's the
[1:21] reality here? What's
[1:23] how do I know? Because for everyone that
[1:25] says that it happened, there's another
[1:26] one who says that it didn't happen and
[1:27] it was so far before I was born. I can't
[1:29] verify any of this.
[1:31] So what do I do?
[1:33] and I'm struggling and it on one hand I
[1:36] have all of these arguments right from a
[1:39] scientific perspective right how do you
[1:42] prove this all all of that and it's
[1:44] really good arguments and in a court of
[1:46] law it might actually work like if
[1:48] you're trying to have some sort of you
[1:49] know civil case about it
[1:52] but on the other hand I'm looking at
[1:55] people who are legitimately good people
[2:00] that I know aren't putting on who are
[2:02] behaving in Christlike ways that go
[2:06] beyond just human reasoning. There's no
[2:08] possible way people could be that good
[2:10] all the time, right? Even when you see
[2:13] the flaws, even when they stumble and
[2:15] fall and face plant in their
[2:16] Christianity, they still get back up and
[2:18] are better for it. How is that possible?
[2:22] Right? People who were willing to love
[2:25] me when I'd been a massive booger. like
[2:27] it was just people who are willing to
[2:31] just just
[2:33] be genuinely loving people and you look
[2:37] at the love of people the love of Christ
[2:40] inside of people and go oh that's real
[2:42] that's not you know it's like um you
[2:46] know brother Brandham tells the story of
[2:47] Bert right meanest man in town what was
[2:50] it I mean this is the man who' been
[2:51] hunting with brother Brandham for years
[2:52] you think brother Brandham had never
[2:53] read him a scripture brother Brandham
[2:56] you Brother Brandham had never told him
[2:58] what he believed in, had never tried to
[3:00] win him over. How many times brother
[3:02] Brandham try to try to influence this
[3:04] man? And a prophet, an actual literal
[3:07] vindicated word prophet could not win
[3:10] that man's heart, but a deer.
[3:13] A mama deer loving her baby could
[3:16] because that the love of Christ is the
[3:21] it's the argument, right? There's no
[3:24] counterargument to that. It's the king's
[3:26] final argument.
[3:28] It's the ultimate weapon. There's no We
[3:32] can sit here and have all kinds of
[3:33] debate about, well, this news clipping
[3:37] and and that magazine and and this
[3:39] person said that and there's this person
[3:41] who, you know, met Brother Brandon.
[3:43] Okay, great. Awesome. I don't care
[3:47] because
[3:51] it's the best way I've ever put it. I've
[3:52] ever heard it put
[3:54] when
[3:57] you know you you wonder, well, is God
[3:59] real?
[4:01] Yes or no? We can have a lot of
[4:04] arguments about it. But at the end of
[4:05] the day, I know God is real the same way
[4:08] I know every one of you is real because
[4:10] I've met you,
[4:12] right? I've met you. I've I've shaken
[4:13] your hand. I've I've looked you in the
[4:14] eye. We've had a conversation. I know
[4:17] you're real, right? And I know God is
[4:19] real because I've met God
[4:20] and he's come down and talked to me and
[4:23] I know how different my life is. It's
[4:25] not verifiable. It's not very
[4:27] scientific. But it is a piece that
[4:29] passes understanding,
[4:30] right? It's beyond understanding.
[4:33] It's not supposed to be understood,
[4:36] right? It's not supposed to make sense.
[4:38] It's not supposed to have some sort of,
[4:43] you know, uh, peer-reviewed paper. Um,
[4:49] and so
[4:51] to me, you know, and I and I felt like
[4:53] this is
[4:55] um
[4:56] like uh the man born blind in John
[4:59] chapter 9. We don't have to turn to it
[5:02] or nothing. I can just read it, but or I
[5:04] I'll just tell you the story. Um it's
[5:06] the man who was born blind and he's on
[5:09] the side of the road begging and doesn't
[5:12] say how old he is. Um, I think he was in
[5:14] my mind I believe he was kind of a
[5:16] younger man, maybe in his 20s or so.
[5:20] And um, he he can't make a living. He
[5:22] can't do anything. He's he's blind. He's
[5:24] completely unable to support himself.
[5:26] All he can do is is get by on the on the
[5:28] charity of those people around him.
[5:31] Completely helpless. And and
[5:35] you know, he the the Lord is passing by
[5:39] and he heals the man, right?
[5:42] and
[5:43] he he he anoints his eyes and and he
[5:47] tells him to go wash at the pool and he
[5:49] washes his his eyes and he can see. And
[5:52] so it's this big deal. He's going around
[5:53] telling everybody, "Praise the Lord.
[5:55] This Jesus healed my eyes."
[5:58] And um
[6:02] the Pharisees go looking into this like,
[6:04] "Hey, you can't be going around saying
[6:05] this. Don't you know that like this
[6:07] Jesus, he's like Belzeub, right? Now,
[6:09] you know that he's he did this on the
[6:10] Sabbath day. He healed you on the
[6:11] Sabbath day. So, clearly it was of the
[6:13] devil. Um, and he's and the man's going,
[6:18] "Okay, well, how do you how do you
[6:20] explain? I mean, nobody heals somebody
[6:22] and being of the devil. That's not the
[6:23] way this works. Show me in the Bible
[6:25] where this happened." And so, I want to
[6:27] just read here. This is from verse 24.
[6:29] He says, "Then again called the man
[6:34] uh that was blind and said unto him,
[6:36] give God the praise. We know this man is
[6:37] a sinner. He answered and said, "Whether
[6:40] he'd be a sinner or no, I know not. One
[6:43] thing I know, that whereas I was blind,
[6:46] now I see."
[6:49] Then said to him, "What did he do to
[6:51] thee? Uh, how opened he thine eyes?" He
[6:54] answered them, "I have told you already,
[6:56] and ye did not hear. Wherefore uh would
[7:00] ye would ye hear it again? Would ye also
[7:02] be his disciples?" Then they reviled him
[7:04] and said, "Thou art his disciple, but we
[7:06] are Moses' disciples." So here they are.
[7:09] Here they are going, "Well," you know,
[7:10] he's going, "I don't know. We can sit
[7:12] here and have this argument about the
[7:13] law and whether or not he should have do
[7:16] healings on the Sabbath day, but what I
[7:17] know is that none of y'all could heal my
[7:19] eyes."
[7:20] Yeah.
[7:20] Right. What I know is that I was blind
[7:23] and I can see now. You know, when I look
[7:26] at my life and people are, you know,
[7:27] well, how do you know that the message
[7:29] of the hour is legit? Well, what I know
[7:31] is that I was blind and now I can see,
[7:34] right? What I know is that I was a
[7:36] wretched, awful person who was just the
[7:40] worst
[7:42] and now I'm not and I didn't do it.
[7:44] Right? God did that and it's through
[7:48] this message. It's it's because of that.
[7:50] Nothing else did that, right? You know,
[7:52] no no,
[7:54] you know, uh anything would have done
[7:56] that.
[7:58] So, um, you know, and and so we know
[8:02] that the the word of God, it's this
[8:05] that's what it is. You know, going back
[8:06] to what we said, it's it's that
[8:08] bloodstained banner. We we everything
[8:10] that the that a Christian is is built on
[8:12] that. The final argument of Christ is
[8:14] that cross. There's, you know, when the
[8:16] when the devil comes before the throne
[8:18] to accuse the church and say, "Well,
[8:21] they're guilty of this, they're guilty
[8:22] of that. Oh, they they they have to bear
[8:24] the burden of this sin. they have to
[8:26] bear the burden of this uh this sickness
[8:28] because of sin.
[8:30] Well, but there was a there was a there
[8:32] was a a price that was paid, right?
[8:34] There's a there's a an atonement there
[8:36] that there isn't it's not logical. It's
[8:39] not scientific, right?
[8:41] The love of God is not scientific. It's
[8:43] not
[8:44] it's not something that you can argue
[8:46] against, right? You know, even even from
[8:49] if we say that that through sin that you
[8:51] know that that sin is atoned for, that
[8:53] means the penalty of sin is atoned for,
[8:55] right? You know, if someone's pardoned,
[8:56] they don't go to jail.
[8:58] Amen.
[8:58] If
[9:00] we have a pardon from sin, then what is
[9:02] the penalty of sin, right? Well, it's
[9:04] sickness. It's being broken. It's being
[9:06] being chained to all these different
[9:07] things. Well, we don't have to suffer
[9:09] that anymore. We have a a a
[9:12] we have an ultimate enforcement.
[9:16] And um you know that's I I feel like so
[9:19] many often times we don't we don't take
[9:21] advantage of that. We don't we don't
[9:24] recognize that this is there's more you
[9:27] know the love of God extends to the
[9:29] Christians right the love of God extends
[9:31] to the sinner. The love of God extends
[9:32] to everybody and no matter what your
[9:34] situation may be
[9:36] that's it's the final answer right
[9:39] there's no there's no argument beyond
[9:40] it. And even if it doesn't make any
[9:42] sense, right? You know, if the if a
[9:43] doctor is telling you something that is
[9:46] contrary to your healing, well, it
[9:49] doesn't have to make sense. Since when
[9:50] is since when is the Bible based on on,
[9:55] you know, evidence? When is since when
[9:58] is this based on on some uh what do you
[10:01] call it? You know, peer-reviewed study.
[10:03] If you're gonna take if you're gonna
[10:04] take that level of scrutiny to it, you
[10:08] know, just not only to the message, if
[10:10] you take it to the message, I think I
[10:12] heard brother Matt Watkins say this one
[10:14] time and it absolutely articulated this
[10:17] spot on. If you take that level of of
[10:21] scrutiny to the message of the hour,
[10:24] it does not lead you to denomination. It
[10:25] leads you to atheism
[10:27] because you kick the legs out from under
[10:30] the message. the exact same set of
[10:31] standards if you apply it to the Bible
[10:33] will do the same thing.
[10:34] You have no at some point you got to
[10:37] take it on faith. At some point, the
[10:39] only way to have that faith is to meet
[10:41] God and know God,
[10:42] right? At some point is to experience
[10:44] the power of God in your life. That's
[10:47] the only way that this works.
[10:50] And so, um,
[10:53] do you do you have that video? Cool.
[10:56] um just start playing it and I'll talk
[10:58] over it um until we get to a certain
[11:00] point. So um
[11:03] this is a video clip from the from 1953.
[11:07] The army is is testing out a new cannon
[11:10] that they built since we have a cannon
[11:12] theme. Um we uh they're building this
[11:15] new cannon and one of the things that I
[11:16] noticed about this is when the the
[11:18] cannon fires you it'll actually tell you
[11:20] can tell when the when the round hits
[11:22] the target. It takes a while. Like it
[11:25] takes a good couple of minutes. Um not
[11:28] minutes but like you know a good couple
[11:30] of seconds. And um oftent times you know
[11:34] we'll we'll pray and we'll ask the Lord
[11:38] you know what what is our we'll ask for
[11:41] for for deliverance of something and it
[11:44] takes a minute, right? We load our our
[11:46] Isaiah 53 into the into the gun and pull
[11:49] the trigger but it's going to take a
[11:50] minute to hit, right? And so don't lose
[11:54] faith
[11:57] because you know the round got fired
[12:12] because that's a nuclear cannon.
[12:17] thing fires an atomic bomb
[12:21] and
[12:24] you know they built this thing because
[12:26] they're crazy. Um but because you know
[12:30] colloquially they call a nuclear weapon
[12:32] unleashing the power of the sun.
[12:35] Well folks you have the final argument
[12:39] of the king. You can unleash the power
[12:41] of the s o n right? Whatever situation
[12:45] is in your life, you pull the trigger.
[12:47] You put Isaiah 53 into action. It might
[12:50] take a minute.
[12:51] Amen.
[12:51] It might take a minute,
[12:53] but all your problems get wiped out.
[12:55] There's nothing left standing.
[12:56] That's right.
[12:57] Right. Whatever the enemy has in your
[12:59] way, no matter no matter how many, you
[13:02] know, MRIs come back with a bad report,
[13:05] no matter how many whatever the doctor
[13:07] says about your baby, Brother Caleb, it
[13:09] doesn't matter. It might take a minute,
[13:13] but the sun is on the case,
[13:16] right? The, you know, they they have
[13:18] this new um in Ukraine, they just sent
[13:21] those new artillery shells that are
[13:22] guided. They can fire and it actually
[13:24] has a guidance system, so it it's
[13:25] pinpoint accurate every time. They call
[13:27] it Excalibur, right? Like the sword from
[13:31] King Arthur. Well, we have a two-edged
[13:33] sword that you can put that behind what
[13:35] you need and pull the trigger and it's
[13:36] going to hit the target every time.
[13:38] It'll never miss. Yeah,
[13:40] because the love of God does not miss,
[13:44] right? Whatever you have need of that
[13:47] that that blood has atoned for any
[13:49] situation that you have.
[13:52] So, I guess that's where I got to quit.
[13:55] Um, we can stand and have a word of
[13:57] prayer.
[14:02] Dear father, Lord, thank you for this
[14:05] opportunity to maybe give someone some
[14:07] encouragement. Father, that maybe they
[14:09] would be weary, that they would be
[14:12] struggling, Lord. That I would just if I
[14:14] could have one requested that my words
[14:17] would go out and encourage somebody and
[14:18] help them through their day, help them
[14:20] through their week, Father. that when
[14:22] the devil would have them beat down that
[14:24] they would be able to maybe have that
[14:26] that thought in the back of their mind
[14:27] that you're there to to protect them,
[14:30] Father. That you're there to to save
[14:31] them, Father. And so, Lord, we're
[14:35] we're so thankful for all that you've
[14:37] done. So grateful for your for your
[14:40] atonement. So grateful for everything
[14:42] you've done. And on this Memorial Day,
[14:44] we think of all the men that would have
[14:46] died, heroes that would have died for a
[14:48] good cause, Father. that there was one
[14:49] hero above all heroes who died for the
[14:53] greatest cause.
[14:55] So, Father, we're thanking you, Father,
[14:57] for everything that you've done in Jesus
[15:00] name. Amen.
