[16:50] good morning god bless you all welcome
[16:53] to Sunday school for the few that are
[16:55] here let's stand and pray gracious
[17:01] father we just come to you now Lord and
[17:03] that we ask that your spirit would be
[17:05] with us Lord here in the service and
[17:08] those who are streaming live now may
[17:11] your hand be upon each one Lord may the
[17:13] spirit of Revelation Lord come forth
[17:16] upon your people Lord that they would
[17:17] know you in the power of your
[17:20] resurrection Lord in this hour that were
[17:22] dark hour that we're living in Lord
[17:24] speak to our hearts may the truth be
[17:26] told and may hearts be ready to receive
[17:29] it father
[17:30] write your word within us by revelation
[17:33] Lord not by knowledge but by an intimate
[17:36] or relationship with you personally we
[17:39] ask these things in Jesus name Amen
[17:42] we are going to continue on our subject
[17:45] of the mystery of the Godhead this is
[17:48] part five and we are going to continue
[17:51] on there's a lot of different aspects
[17:53] you'll notice that the subtitle has
[17:57] changed before it was why the Trinity is
[18:00] false we're still kind of dealing with
[18:02] that but we're examining Trinitarian
[18:06] terms and misinterpreted verses and
[18:09] we'll spend some time and look at that
[18:10] and we'll look and see what even
[18:14] scholars today are finding out as they
[18:17] study deeper into the history and
[18:20] understanding of the scriptures that
[18:21] they're actually going back and create
[18:24] correcting some of the past false
[18:27] interpretations because of Trinitarian
[18:30] doctrine so we thank the Lord for his
[18:32] truth it's been revealed to us in this
[18:34] day I pray that continuing on the
[18:38] subject of the Godhead wouldn't be
[18:40] something that's boring if you'd want me
[18:42] to just move on or something like that I
[18:44] hope not but it's going to be a
[18:46] long-term study we're gonna continue
[18:50] probably a few more on looking at why
[18:53] the Trinity is false but then
[18:55] we have some topics like the attributes
[18:57] of God and then looking closer at to
[19:00] what the message teaches about the
[19:02] Godhead of course we've been looking at
[19:04] that through that time but then you know
[19:06] sometimes when you look at a topic in
[19:09] response to another topic that's false
[19:12] you don't get the full picture and so we
[19:16] want to eventually we'll move beyond
[19:18] this topic of responding to Trinitarian
[19:21] doctrine and go deeper into what the
[19:25] scripture actually says and how it
[19:26] actually defines it that's the problem
[19:28] sometimes when you approach a subject
[19:31] that's like an argument between two
[19:33] parties the one party responding to
[19:36] another party he's always going to be
[19:38] shaped by what the other party says just
[19:40] like just like today our news media sets
[19:43] what the topic is and the government has
[19:45] no choice but to respond to what the
[19:48] media is saying because there's an
[19:49] outcry from everyone it's on social
[19:51] media it's on the media and so forth
[19:53] well we don't want to just follow the
[19:56] devil's agenda we want to set follow
[19:59] God's agenda God's truth and so we might
[20:02] we might be responding to the false
[20:06] Trinity doctrine now but we want to move
[20:09] out move on from that into looking at
[20:13] okay what is this what is the scripture
[20:15] really teach so we're doing that now but
[20:18] we want to do it in a little different
[20:19] fashion as we move forward we've we've
[20:24] read this the last few services
[20:25] Galatians chapter 3 verse 20 in the King
[20:30] James it says now a mediator is not a
[20:32] mediator of one but God is one in the
[20:35] amplified version it says now a go but
[20:38] go between intermediary has to do with
[20:41] and implies more than one party there
[20:43] can be no mediator with just one person
[20:45] yet God is only one person and we'll
[20:50] skip the last part of that there Dodd is
[20:53] only one person this is a this is a
[20:56] Bible interpretation put together by
[21:00] Trinitarians and in it they have to
[21:03] admit that the Bible itself says God is
[21:06] only one person
[21:08] about they reinterpret that and and and
[21:12] look at it from this angle from that
[21:14] angle and now no longer means God is one
[21:16] person it means God is three persons but
[21:19] yet the Bible itself explains itself God
[21:22] is one person a verse very frequently
[21:30] referred to in the times that I've
[21:32] spoken with Trinitarians is Genesis 1:26
[21:35] and 27 and we'll read that and God said
[21:38] let us make man in our image after our
[21:41] likeness and let them have dominion over
[21:42] the fish of the sea and over the fowl of
[21:44] the air and over the cattle and over all
[21:46] the earth and over every creeping thing
[21:48] that creeps upon the earth so God
[21:50] created man in his own image and the
[21:52] image of God created he him male and
[21:54] female created he them so when we look
[21:58] at this verse the first thing a
[22:00] Trinitarian says what this speaks of at
[22:03] least two persons there's got to be
[22:05] multiple persons in the Godhead and then
[22:08] they'll take you to the term Elohim
[22:10] Elohim in Hebrew is a plural term for
[22:16] God it can either be translated as God
[22:19] or depending on the context or it can be
[22:22] translated as gods anytime you have the
[22:25] team at the end of a word in Hebrew it
[22:30] speaks of a plurality so Trinitarian say
[22:34] this means there's more than one person
[22:37] in the Godhead however it the Jewish
[22:43] people never understood this verse this
[22:45] way there's absolutely no evidence in
[22:48] fact over and over and over again to the
[22:51] tune of tens of thousands of times when
[22:54] the word Elohim is used in the Old
[22:57] Testament it's it's used in conjunction
[23:00] with a singular personal pronoun so if
[23:05] that's the case this plural what what is
[23:09] the plural plural of persons it's never
[23:11] taught in the Old Testament Trinitarians
[23:15] admit that over and over again the
[23:16] Trinity is not taught explicitly in the
[23:20] Old Testament
[23:21] so what is it what is it speaking of let
[23:24] us make man in our own image Elohim
[23:27] you know it's speaking every every
[23:30] Jewish scholar and today now Trinitarian
[23:35] scholars admit Elohim simply means the
[23:38] plural of Majesty it means it means that
[23:42] we're talking about the greatest most
[23:44] powerful it's trying to say this is the
[23:47] highest God there's no one but there's
[23:50] no gods above this God you know the
[23:55] children of Israel made a calf here's
[23:58] here's an example of misinterpreting
[24:00] misinterpreted theology the children of
[24:03] Israel made a calf how many calves did
[24:04] they make one and what what did the
[24:09] interpreter say these this well the this
[24:12] is what the scripture itself says this
[24:14] is your Elohim that brought you out of
[24:17] Egypt what do the interpreters say in
[24:20] that verse in the Exodus these be thy
[24:23] God's how can these be thy gods when
[24:26] there's only one calf they don't
[24:29] understand this is your God is what what
[24:32] they're saying that brought you out of
[24:33] Egypt a bull well it's the plural of
[24:40] Majesty there's one God and he's he's
[24:43] he's the highest God but let's look at
[24:45] this let us make man in our image I'm
[24:47] not gonna try to go into a teaching on
[24:49] this of what how we understand how I
[24:52] understand it I'm simply gonna leave you
[24:54] this is what important Trinitarian
[24:57] theologians write Gordon Wenham he
[25:02] writes Christians have traditionally
[25:05] seen Genesis 1:26 as wow this is a fancy
[25:09] word Adam Brading foreshadowing the
[25:11] Trinity it is not universally admitted
[25:14] that this was not the plural meant to
[25:17] the original of author in other words
[25:21] what is he saying this the original
[25:24] author of Genesis well who's the
[25:26] original author of Genesis God that God
[25:31] inspired it he did not intend to say
[25:34] that there's multiple person
[25:35] in the Godhead he did not intend to say
[25:37] that there's a Trinity from this verse I
[25:39] want you to see what the NIV Study Bible
[25:42] contains on this note us our our God
[25:47] speaks as the creator King announcing
[25:50] his crowning work to the members of his
[25:53] heavenly Court and then they offer
[25:55] multiple verses throughout the
[25:58] scriptures that bear record to God
[26:00] speaking in plural to his heavenly court
[26:03] and so I again I'm not trying to go into
[26:06] my doctrine about this verse or our
[26:09] doctrine about this verse and the
[26:11] message I'm simply saying this is what
[26:13] important scholars are saying today is
[26:16] that this verse has nothing to do with
[26:18] multiple persons in the Godhead John one
[26:23] and one this is probably the main verse
[26:27] that caused Greek scholars in the early
[26:30] church to come to this conclusion that
[26:33] there's two persons there's a second
[26:36] person each that is eternal in the
[26:38] Godhead a misinterpretation of John 1
[26:41] verse 1 in the beginning was the word
[26:44] that's Greek logos and the Word was with
[26:47] God and the Word was God
[26:50] they took this verse and they said this
[26:53] is speaking of a second co ternal person
[26:57] with God that's what the Nicene Creed is
[26:58] saying so the word and God are two
[27:04] different persons is what they're saying
[27:05] so if we take this this is a little
[27:10] slightly confusing but if we take this
[27:12] and put on top of it their
[27:14] interpretation Trinitarian
[27:16] interpretation this is what we arrive at
[27:18] in the beginning was the son som the son
[27:22] of God and the son was with the Father
[27:27] but then the last part it says the Word
[27:29] was God
[27:30] so and the word the son was the father
[27:35] what it doesn't work it doesn't make it
[27:39] is there's no there's no logic behind
[27:42] interpreting this as a second person in
[27:44] the Godhead co-equal and coeternal with
[27:46] God if
[27:49] signifies one person and God signifies
[27:51] another person then how can the word be
[27:53] God the word would have to not be God
[27:57] but the scripture says the Word was God
[27:59] so now we shouldn't we should see it a
[28:02] little bit in a different light so they
[28:07] say the the word is eternal even even to
[28:10] the Farsi translations today in other
[28:14] translations says and in eternity was
[28:19] the word that's how they interpret that
[28:21] verse but the word in greek is NRK
[28:25] there's no no possibility of saying any
[28:28] that are K means eternity our K means
[28:31] beginning always it's always translated
[28:34] as beginning it is never translated as
[28:37] eternal so even they will he'll be
[28:41] guilty of adding to the word putting in
[28:45] the Bible a word that's not even there a
[28:47] complete false interpretation it says in
[28:50] the beginning was the word that begs the
[28:52] question what about before the beginning
[28:55] there's two parts to the logos when we
[28:59] look at it really there's the thought
[29:02] the intent the plan right and then
[29:07] there's the expression which is the
[29:09] action the work the manifestation so
[29:12] there's two parts two logos it's the
[29:14] inner part and then it's the outward
[29:18] part and if we look at this this is how
[29:21] the early church understood it before
[29:23] the development that led to the Nicene
[29:26] council to make two co-equal persons in
[29:29] the Godhead proverbs 8 22 and 23 now
[29:38] some in the early church took logos and
[29:42] wisdom from the Old Testament and they
[29:44] separated those out
[29:46] they said the logos is Jesus Christ and
[29:49] the wisdom is the Holy Spirit I don't
[29:53] believe you can arrive at that the
[29:55] reason why they do that is because in
[29:57] proverbs 8 it refers to the the wisdom
[30:01] in the female
[30:03] with female pronouns now if you've been
[30:08] if you've been around the message for a
[30:09] while the light belt should be going hot
[30:13] so we have the logos and wisdom they're
[30:16] the same they're the same one is Christ
[30:20] one is his bride Ephesians chapter 1
[30:23] tells us that God has chosen us the
[30:26] bride in Christ before the foundation of
[30:28] the world so lady wisdom was there in
[30:31] Christ not as this not as another person
[30:34] but in him so this is from the ESV
[30:37] proverbs 8 22 and 23 the Lord possessed
[30:41] me at the beginning of his work the
[30:44] first of his acts of old so the Lord
[30:47] possessed me literally the Lord entered
[30:49] in and dwelt within wisdom ages ago I
[30:54] was set up
[30:55] the word set up there means to be poured
[30:59] out so he was he was poured out from
[31:03] something so in other words he was in
[31:05] something and then he was poured out
[31:08] from that the logos was at the further
[31:11] ages ago I was set up at the first the
[31:14] word means concealed at the first so in
[31:18] other words he was concealed and then
[31:21] poured out before the beginning of the
[31:24] creation so we have eternity wisdom the
[31:28] logos was in God as a thought a plan a
[31:33] purpose and an intent but then just
[31:37] prior to creation the logos went out of
[31:41] God and it became the very expression
[31:43] the body theophany of God it says the
[31:46] Lord possessed me God entered into this
[31:49] it said this is me manifested to the
[31:52] world early church fathers spoke of this
[31:56] as well and I'm I'm Way too tight here
[32:02] up here and even that's cut off but this
[32:06] is dr te pollard a theologian and also
[32:09] do you still gonzales who's a church
[32:13] historian right like Hippolyte
[32:15] Hippolyta's Tertullian starts from the
[32:17] idea of god solitariness before the
[32:19] creation of the world before all things
[32:22] God was alone because there was nothing
[32:24] external to him yet God was not alone
[32:28] for he had reason within him the ratio
[32:32] the reason which is his logos and by
[32:36] God's simple will the logos springs
[32:40] forth sound familiar
[32:43] this is the teaching of Tertullian in
[32:45] the early church
[32:47] Bernard loss and other historian writes
[32:50] IRA næss Bishop of Lyons and his
[32:53] doctrine of God first spoke of God's
[32:55] inner being and second of his
[32:57] progressive self disclosure in the
[32:59] history of salvation IRA næss was of the
[33:02] same opinion as the apologist of the
[33:04] ancient church especially Theophilus of
[33:06] Antioch that when he taught that God has
[33:09] with with him from all eternity his word
[33:13] and his wisdom God brought them forth
[33:17] from himself before the creation again
[33:22] it was with God it was in God as a
[33:25] thought as a plan then it went out of
[33:27] God as his self revelation his
[33:31] self-expression this is what they taught
[33:35] before Nicaea and and the development up
[33:38] there it didn't just arrive at Nicaea
[33:40] and instantly they had a new doctrine no
[33:43] they went from this and they this true
[33:47] understanding and they developed
[33:49] something further that the church
[33:51] previously didn't believe here's what
[33:55] brother Branham said in Hebrews sermon
[33:57] as we had it the other night God in the
[34:00] beginning was spirit and then from God
[34:02] went out the logos for the theophany
[34:04] which was a form of a man called the son
[34:06] of God prefigured so I'm just gonna stop
[34:12] there for a minute
[34:15] this is what the Trinitarians have taken
[34:18] and perverted they developed a new
[34:20] understanding of John one and one and
[34:23] the result was that now you have two
[34:27] gods now of course they reject that
[34:30] terminology but let's call a duck a duck
[34:34] we don't need to call a duck some kind
[34:37] of strange winged creature that flies
[34:40] over water and swims is is he a duck
[34:43] is he a fish let's reinterpret this for
[34:47] a little while a duck is a duck and
[34:49] though you say you don't believe into
[34:52] two or three gods when you make a second
[34:55] co-equal Co eternal person you're making
[34:58] a second God and in fact honest
[35:01] theologians in the early church
[35:02] literally said that said it was a second
[35:06] God Justin Martyr who didn't believe in
[35:09] a co-equal Co eternal person still
[35:11] because of false interpretation part of
[35:13] the development away from the truth
[35:16] called Jesus the logos a second God the
[35:22] fact is the logos is simply God
[35:24] expressing himself first it's in God and
[35:27] then it goes out of God when it goes out
[35:28] of God now it's with God but it doesn't
[35:32] become less than God it God is a spirit
[35:36] right he's invisible you can't see him
[35:38] well now God becomes invisible
[35:40] well that logos is it really God sure
[35:44] absolutely it is
[35:46] and yet it's an expression of him it's
[35:47] it's it's with him it's two but not two
[35:55] persons that's why it's with him it's
[35:57] God in his body you are three but one
[36:02] person body soul and spirit
[36:05] and so these things with the spirit of
[36:08] Revelation are simple but without a
[36:11] spirit of Revelation an exulting reason
[36:14] that's what Greeks did they exalted
[36:17] reason Jews exalted revelation they
[36:20] wanted it revealed they wanted a prophet
[36:22] to come and make the truth known to them
[36:24] they prayed for that they waited for
[36:26] that true ones false ones they set up
[36:28] their own interpreter
[36:29] they set up their own denomination and
[36:32] when God came to interpret the word they
[36:34] said that's not God that's the devil and
[36:39] what do Greeks do they turn around and
[36:42] do it even worse they make completely
[36:46] nonsense philosophy exalt reason above
[36:52] revealed truth now we're going to use
[36:54] reason to understand revealed truth
[36:57] instead of using what God has provided
[36:59] which is the scriptures and the Spirit
[37:02] of God prayer waiting on the Lord
[37:05] now it's politics philosophy reason
[37:11] death that's really what the ultimate
[37:14] reality that came forth from that
[37:18] Hebrews 1:1 through three start this and
[37:22] we'll probably finish when we're done
[37:25] with these verses God who at sundry
[37:26] times and in divers manners spake in
[37:29] time past unto the father's by the
[37:31] prophets hath in these last days spoken
[37:34] to us by his son whom he has appointed
[37:37] heir of all things by whom also he has
[37:41] made the world's who being the
[37:43] brightness of his glory and the Express
[37:44] image of his person and upholding all
[37:47] things by the word of his power when he
[37:49] had by himself purged our sins sat down
[37:51] on the right hand of the Majesty on high
[37:56] so when we look at Trinitarian
[38:00] terminology they're using these terms
[38:02] persons and they're using the term
[38:04] essence three persons in one essence now
[38:08] can we arrive there from Scripture the
[38:10] word that we talked about before that
[38:12] they use for persons not exactly the
[38:15] word persons in Greek but it's very
[38:17] similar
[38:17] it means it's who post a cease and so
[38:21] they say three who post a cease in one
[38:23] lucia does the scripture speak of three
[38:30] distinct who post a cease
[38:34] anywhere in one essence so we saw that
[38:39] see in that scripture it says who's the
[38:43] being the brightness of his glory and
[38:45] the Express image of his person is who
[38:51] post a cease so Jesus is the Express
[38:55] image that word literally means the
[38:58] exact imprint like a coin you you want
[39:02] to make an imprint on a coin of a of the
[39:05] Emperor of the president you you make
[39:08] you make an original which is based on
[39:11] what what he really what what the
[39:13] president looks like now you make an
[39:16] original and then you stamp the coin so
[39:19] you have the original which is the stamp
[39:20] itself and then you have the metal which
[39:23] is shaped now that you make the stamp
[39:26] now that stamp is exactly or that coin
[39:29] is an exact representation of what the
[39:32] stamp is so the Son of God the visible
[39:37] manifestation of God is the exact
[39:40] imprint of God's who post a cease so who
[39:45] post a see speaks of a foundational
[39:47] nature or essence so Christ is the
[39:53] perfect expression of the invisible
[39:57] God's nature or essence he's the exact
[40:03] imprint he's when you see Jesus said
[40:07] when use when you see me you see the
[40:09] father amen so it isn't to hypo States
[40:16] who post a cease between father and son
[40:18] there's one who post a cease and there's
[40:21] one expression of that hoop of Stacey's
[40:24] not to God is invisible he has an eight
[40:27] he has a nature he has an essence God is
[40:31] made visible is there another nature in
[40:33] essence is there a second nature is
[40:37] there two natures between God and Christ
[40:41] no when we're talking about humanity
[40:43] humanity and and spirit God who is a
[40:46] spirit and
[40:47] and a man yes in that sense there's two
[40:50] natures but is the fundamental nature of
[40:53] who Jesus is as a man what he expresses
[40:56] what is he what does he express is he
[40:59] like us he sometimes expresses his
[41:02] fleshly side and sometimes Express
[41:04] there's one nature that's God's very
[41:07] nature expressed completely through
[41:11] Jesus Christ not to some people in the
[41:15] message say there's two persons there's
[41:19] not there's not two persons in the
[41:20] Godhead there's one God who's invisible
[41:25] manifested perfectly through Jesus
[41:28] Christ who is the visible expression of
[41:30] him who is invisible all right second
[41:36] Corinthians 4:6 for God who commanded
[41:38] the light to shine out of darkness has
[41:40] shined in our hearts to give the light
[41:42] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[41:44] the face piroso pone of Jesus Christ
[41:49] another word often means and then
[41:54] translated has been reinterpreted that's
[41:58] some of the problem that's happened with
[41:59] languages the Vic the person who wins a
[42:02] victory
[42:03] whatever victory that would be whether
[42:05] it be theological or political he starts
[42:08] to define language the way he wants to
[42:10] define the language and so the the
[42:13] theological Victor's which were
[42:15] Trinitarians
[42:16] begin to reshape the meaning of language
[42:19] but prosopon does not mean person there
[42:24] is a word for person in Greek it's
[42:25] persona but preso pone means something
[42:29] different means the front towards the
[42:32] view it would be similar to image only
[42:36] it has a different connotation prosopon
[42:42] speaks of the mask so in a in a drama in
[42:49] those days when someone was playing a
[42:52] part he didn't just play the part and
[42:55] look where his normal face he actually
[42:59] wore a mask
[43:00] sometimes you play multiple parts within
[43:02] that within that particular drama and so
[43:06] he played those multiple parts change
[43:07] the mask it's the same person behind
[43:10] that it's the same persona behind that
[43:14] but the pro so pone is different so got
[43:20] the glory of God when you hear the glory
[43:23] of God what do you what are you here the
[43:26] Shekinah the supernatural light the
[43:29] logos that which is emanating from God
[43:32] making him visible is revealed in the
[43:36] pro so pone of Jesus Christ
[43:39] so the glory of God took on God Himself
[43:43] took another mask to play another act in
[43:46] his drama so what Jesus is not a second
[43:49] person what is he he's the very he's the
[43:54] mask that God entered in and played hid
[43:57] that role in the plan of redemption
[44:01] again all these things they get
[44:04] redefined they get changed reinterpreted
[44:06] but when you look at the scripture
[44:08] itself look at the history itself you'll
[44:12] understand something completely
[44:14] different if you read and we'll read
[44:17] further to about some things that
[44:19] Tertullian said said the same thing you
[44:22] use the same terminology there's three
[44:23] Pro soap bones and one person three
[44:27] masks one person again well with we have
[44:32] a lot more to cover we'll continue on
[44:34] but let's let's stand up and pray before
[44:37] we dismiss sunday-school father we thank
[44:41] you so much for your goodness your mercy
[44:44] to us Lord that the eyes of our
[44:46] understanding are opened up Lord I pray
[44:48] father that this could be used Lord for
[44:52] people to share this message with those
[44:57] have not heard yet Lord increase our
[45:00] burden for that take this word Lord and
[45:03] make it become a revelation to people's
[45:05] heart we want your word we want their
[45:08] true revelation and understanding of
[45:11] your reality and we want that reality to
[45:13] be expressed
[45:14] through us Lord the same reality that
[45:18] was in Jesus Christ to be in us and
[45:20] manifested through us lord help us to
[45:22] raise higher in our faith and in our
[45:25] walk with you Father
[45:26] we commit ourselves to you we ask you
[45:28] bless the worship and the preaching of
[45:31] the word today may it come forth with
[45:33] power into people's homes and lives we

[45:39] god bless you
