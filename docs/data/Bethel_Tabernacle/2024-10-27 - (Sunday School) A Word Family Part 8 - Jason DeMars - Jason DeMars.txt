========================================

e e [Music] morning everyone let's stand going to continue on our subject to word family this is part eight go ahead and pull that PowerPoint up for me brother Mark and while he does that we'll pray Heavenly Father we just wna come to you Lord and we ask that your Holy Spirit would guide us and lead us Lord that it would be a a ministering of the word to the hearts of your people Lord that it would bring something that would be a help to them in their Walk with You Lord we just commit ourselves and our time in the word with you now Lord we ask that you'd be glorified in our midst in Jesus name amen all right so we'll start reading uh first Peter chapter 3 not sure if I'm connected I'm probably going to need you to help me out brother Mark I don't know if we're having a battery issue or what I am on 1 Peter 3:1 likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives next verse while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plating the hair and wearing of gold or put of putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a weak of a Meek not weak meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price for after this manner in the old time the holy women women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement likewise you husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated all right now I have control good deal so you might you might be thinking why does he keep going on and on and preaching about A Woman's Place and I I have to say we understand and in our study we've realized that it was Men Who abdicated their position that allowed for feminism to grow uh unhindered amen it was weak men that that did that we we call them uh never mind sometimes you have to catch yourself it's brother brandham mocked people and so did Elijah but uh sometimes it's over the top so uh sissified men is how the prophet said it modern people would call them soy boys but we won't go there but it cissified men that refused to lead in the home in the church and in Civil Society amen and so if if we get the men in order eventually the women will come back into order but if we don't even understand what order is what's the order and how do we get back there and that's why we spend time speaking about the position and order that women have it used to be in the Reformation period anyone that was a Christian immediately understood they didn't have to preach on women shouldn't be preachers amen women shouldn't lead the family they they spoke about it they wrote about it but it wasn't something necessary to rebuke and preach again they didn't have to preach against modesty only a little bit amen they didn't have to preach wh why are why are people uh dressing this way and acting this way it wasn't necessary because everyone understood and knew in a Christian Society a woman should dress modestly she shouldn't wear makeup she shouldn't cut her hair she should put on pants men shouldn't go out with their women's underclothes on they should lead the lead in the home they should lead in the family and only in extraordinary circumstances would a woman ever be a leader in civil society and especially not if there was a vote cast to bring that of course in hereditary places where there was no one else to inherit de you you think of Deborah you think of the woman at the city that joab was about to attack God used them on a temporary basis but the norm was not w women in leadership positions in Civil Society the Civil Authority or the political Authority though it could happen in extraordinary circumstances that God could choose them to do that but again it wasn't the norm now we've come full circle and just to stand in the pulpit and say you know women shouldn't have the vote in a Christian country and women shouldn't run for civil office in a Christian St country and women shouldn't preach behind the pulpit in a Christian country and you are now marked as a radical well thank God I'm a radical I'm happy as a radical because I'm in good place with all the writers of the Bible and the prophets of old and the prophets of new amen and so as we look at this and we speak about women it's because we love women amen it's our duty to protect our sister isers we live in a world where women are unprotected because of feminism where women are put in a position in the place where they're out of their place instead of being protected by a father a grandfather a brother an uncle society as a whole they're put In Harm's Way in front of every man to dress any way that they choose to look any way they choose to and this is not God's purpose and program for the world and brother brandham speaks about it any country that will all would allow such a situation is a perverted country amen and so as we look at these things we look at First Peter we see God's purpose brother brandham says women oh let me pull up the PowerPoint again women ought to look to Jesus Christ you ought to look to Sarah and them of the Old Testament now they got so that I was preaching the other night someone about women to obey their husband obey yeah that went out of the marriage ritual a long time ago but they ain't going to do that no sir they live in America and they let you know so they're not going to obey but as long as you don't do it don't never try to call yourself a Christian CU you're not I don't care how much you dance and speak with tongues if you don't obey your husband you're out of the will of God am amen this is exactly the scripture just as we read Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord who daughter whose daughters you are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement this is the purpose and place of our dear sisters is under Authority amen the the you you look through scripture and we read it before and I'm just going to refer to it briefly read numbers 30 some people look and say well the Old Testament law has nothing to do with us as Christians well the ceremonial law that's true the ceremonial law we understand is a type of Christ and the bride right but in the laws we can look and see places that God put something there that gives us a principle and the truth is every nation should base their laws upon the word of God and upon the principles of the word of God so we look back to numbers 30 and it shows us what actual headship in a home means it means that the father or the husband is the deciding factor in the family if his wife or daughter makes a decision he can invalidate them even to the point where if they make a vow to God he can say no amen and God himself will honor that authority of the husband now again the immediate thing that happens is that uh modern women feminist women go directly to well if it's that way every woman will be abused was every woman abused in all of history no Would a Christian man abuse his wife not a real Christian man amen a a sissified man that doesn't understand what manhood is manhood in itself means work and guarding so a protector someone that controls someone that manipulates someone that uh beats his wife is a twisted person is a twisted man he is not a man he's weak amen and in order to establish his strength he has to use perverted means the Bible says the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God so the anger of man does not accomplish God's righteousness so an angry man an angry husband that uses anger to control his family is a perverted man yes amen as the young people say he's a beta he's not a real man he's we he he is absolutely Ethan's saying something different maybe he's a sigma I don't know but um the fact is he's weak he's not he's not a real man a real man understands that it it is his duty to protect it is his duty to provide and take care of those around him and those that are weaker even to his own hurt even to his own uh pain he must be that type of man all right continuing on 1 Thessalonians 2 7 and 8 I want you to see the scripture speaks of the attributes and nature of a woman and Paul even speaking of himself that he as an apostle manifested to his children both the nature of of the love and nurture that a woman brings and the the correction and d and and wisdom that a father brings but the point being is looking at as these are attributes that a woman should have in her life and in her family so 1 Thessalonians 2:7 and8 but we were gentle among you even as a nurse cherishes her children so a woman isn't to be a brute a woman isn't to be hard hard and have a hard Edge and have a harshness to her as we read before it's a it's a a Meek and a quiet Spirit what is meekness meekness is not weakness meekness is being able to be led Moses was the meekest man on the earth what did it mean that he was weak absolutely was not weak what was he what was it he was actually uh easily led by God Amen he was the one that knew he was under the authority of God and knew that he needed to stay under that Authority and a Meek woman knows that she needs to be under headship and to follow headship so there's a gentle spirit that is upon a woman a mother that should be upon her harsh Brash uh aggressive that's not the nature that God wants a woman to have amen so being affectionately desirous of you we were willing to have imparted unto you not the gospel of God only but also our own Souls because you were dear unto us getting ahead of myself a little bit I just want to make the point that one of the names that Adam gave to his wife was Eve it means Hava it means lifegiver so if you're looking at the scripture a woman is designed to impart life unto her children this is this is her nature this is a her desire so we see how perverted our society has become that the number one issue in voting for women is that they can kill their unborn children amen abortion is a great perversion of Womanhood real Womanhood says I'll rather give my life and let the baby live then kill this baby so that I can just live however I want to without any uh any ramifications for my actions but that's the perversion of birth control and that's the perversion of abortion they don't want consequences for what they've done amen and they and and the Viewpoint of our age as children are an inconvenience to our own life this is a perversion and even this idea sometimes Creeps in to the church yeah but God's idea is quite different so a a real mother a real woman is ready to give her own life for her children in fact she does from her body after she has children it changes it's not the same body anymore she gives that up gladly joyfully it's not easy no one said it's easy but she joyfully does it because she Lo because of the love and the the the the nurturing Gentle Spirit that she has from God Amen not only that then after the baby's born she dedicates her whole time and effort to taking care of and feeding that baby from her own body and so this this is the real Beauty And Glory of motherhood brother brandham says in the sermon flashing red light of the sign of his coming again brother brandham is not afraid to call out the sins of the age and the sins of the hour he says what happens out of marriage here's another place in the Bible out of marriage Goes The Vow obey huh obey huh a keeper at home chased of Good Works she laughs in your face and goes to the powder plant somebody's office my husband yeah oh I doubt that if she forces today these forces today such a disgrace put women on the police force if that is and a mark of debauchery among any city as many men is out of work and they have to put them women out there when the Bible said she is to stay uh she's to stay home and be a chased Keeper at at home but she keeps all the boss's books and yours too that's right I ain't talking about good women now I'm not throwing this to you women that's really Godly women God Bless you that's on tape or what wherever more but I'm talking about where you find one like that you find 1,500 the other way they won't listen to a word keep your Bible preach it to yourself we don't want to hear it obey oh she might say this tell you tell your bible stories to somebody else keep your God to somebody else and leave me alone what are you hollering at me about I never did ask you to say these things I know but God did see so that's all so they still corrupt the way just as they did in the days of the Lord just as they did in that day so do they today just the same it hasn't changed it doesn't change it won't change juvenile delinquency finally gets her children the jail gets part of the women and the men and Hell takes the whole thing up that's exactly right fin finally swallows them all up and the preaching seems to go over the top of their backs they never listen to it they're going to have their own you could tell them what the Bible says Bible says this they say keep your Bible we're going to have our fun I can hear some of you sister saying now maybe not right present but hear you saying who me obey my husband huh I make him him obey me but there is where you're wrong stay at home chased I don't care what the Bible says about it you leave me alone listen sister that wasn't it back in the dark a that that wasn't in back in the Dark Ages that's the voice of today that never happened so much back in the anti deluvian it happens today too that's the same thing again they say I'm a modern woman I live in America well that's no more than you live in a a Hog Pen it wouldn't make a bit of difference to God where you lived you are what you are in your heart that's right and don't think sister that you're so modern that you're one of these modern women as you want to say today you're you're from a way back according to this Bible in Dark Ages in the ant deluvian time in the time of Noah that's when they did the same thing so you're not so very modern after all are you see that's the way they acted in the anti- deluvian world see and that's the way they're acting today so it must be a Dark Age Again back in the Great Dark Beyond and you man that will let your wife do it you're no longer sons of God no you kind of fell into Sodom that's right let the woman boss you around my goodness what a rebuke yeah seems to be even more fitting for the day that we're living in than it was even for the time of of brother brandham right uh in in his day at least there was a Remnant now it's seems to be all pervasive although I will say this that that this uh biblical understanding is starting to uh take effect it's starting to to make a make some a slight change amongst Christians that believe the Bible that they've discovered that this world is evil and we should not we should not be a little bit like the world and a little bit like the Bible but they say forget all that let's go back to the Old Paths and the old ways and I believe that's the right way and the right approach and again I'm I'm not reading this because I want to beat a dead horse I'm reading this because I want you to see what the prophet said it's easy to go along and listen to sermons and and and just gloss over it and not see where it's connected to the scriptures but it's important that we really see his attitude and his approach to these things and even how he he dealt with them in his preaching and you men that's smoking cigarettes that's Unbecoming and you men that's letting your wife do that and then you say you're sons of God a man the great the great vow that's took at the marriage ceremony love honor and obbey is gone in America the woman has the right of way well everywhere she has got the right of way the Bible said she would have it that way now don't shoot me this is just saying what the prophet said they say that the women is the most careful drivers that we got in the land that's wrong my son and I crossing the nation back and forth keep a book and every time there is what we call a boo boo pulled on the road if it's the man we put it under man and woman under woman and under three 100 boo boos Across the Nation there was 281 of them women how did they base this because of the reports that's turned in certainly them cops ain't going to arrest them Nic looking women if they got a telephone number they won't turn them in they let them go and that's the reason you see it's become a woman's world the Bible said it would be that way exactly so listen what he says next so the preacher in the Pulpit is just about the same thing he's afraid to say anything against it that's that is what we're living under that's what we see mega churches filled with people and the majority of them is women in these mega churches why because the preacher stands up and he rebukes the men and what about the women not a word they're the best members they're the ones that we love they're the ones that are women are more spiritual than men that might be true but they also need a rebuke just as much as the men do yeah and and especially in the hour that we're living in where feminism has creeped in and taken over the minds of people things need to be set in order and it takes courage and you must stand here here and preach the word of God Amen and I'm I thank God for sisters that have put up with me I think you still like me for eight eight eight series of uh uh Sunday school and who knows how many more it will be but our desire is to be right with God not to give you smooth words that everybody would say oh I just love Jason you might be coming to Sunday school flinching but if you if you leave a better woman a better man I think you should just thank God and again my point wasn't to talk about women being worst drivers as you see my point was not that my point was to point out authority figures are fearing of women right are husbands fearing of women I think so are preachers afraid of women I think so is the government even afraid of women to some extent absolutely amen so we live in a society that's afraid to hold women accountable well God isn't afraid of it so neither should his preachers be neither should the husbands be amen amen in questions and answers brother brandham is gets this question brother brandham the Bible tells us a wife should obey her husband I a Christian and my husband is a sinner he persecutes me in every way that he can and for me not to go to church and read my Bible and denies the word what should I do what should you do now listen you're supposed to obey your husband that's the word now if he tells you and refuses you to read the Bible go to church or something like that you don't have to obey that because he that will not forsake his father mother husband wife or whatever it is and follow me is not worthy of me is that right now don't the men are supposed you're not a man's not supposed to use that authority over a woman just because he's her ruler God is her ruler above you brother in other words Amen in other words it should be the leadership of Christ flowing through the husband to his wife and the rest of the family it's not just we use it use the authority over our wife just because we want to get our own way that's selfishness amen we use that Authority in order to bless in order to build in order to strengthen in order to rebuke correct Etc God her is her ruler above you brother see and if your wife is doing something wrong then don't then you got a right to tell her and she's supposed to listen to you but you haven't got no right to to beat her or drag her around or do those things no God Made Men a helpmate not a dormant remember she was your sweetheart she should always be that amen notice incredibly balanced beautiful answer the prophet gives well you're supposed to obey your husband he doesn't minimize that he doesn't say well sister you see he says yep that's the word obey your husband but if he tells you to disobey the word don't do that because you have to be willing to forsake all to follow Christ and men don't don't use your authority to control your wife God is her ruler above you in other words that you you're using your position of authority to speak what God speaks to you for your family and he says don't beat her or abuse her amen but in but instead you also need to be able to correct her if she's wrong sit down about it and another quote he says sit down look at the Bible together and pray over it amen that that's way he's saying to take the leadership and authority over your wife and as a wife you should obey a husband that's pointing you to the word Proverbs 11 29 he that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind and the fool shall be servant to the wise so I want to read what John Gil says about this verse because I I think it's very important to understand as men a man can either bless his house with his leadership or he can trouble his house with his leadership regardless of the the situation of your country you might live in a Middle Eastern country where patriarchy is the norm you might live in America where feminism is the norm whether you're in in one country or the other you can be one of two kinds of husbands because there's patriarchy is inevitable because men are stronger than women men are in a in a better position to lead so what is the difference a man that abdicates his position of leadership leaves it to the woman is a is a feminist Le home a matriarchal home right that but he's still he's still The Leader by abdicating his authority so that means he's a bad leader and there's another kind who's a patriarch who abuses his authority that's wrong that's un that's just as unscriptural all right but then there is a godly man that understands that the authority of Christ flows through him to his own family on either ends of these places you have someone that is troubling his own house amen he's he's bringing he's not doing what he's supposed to do he's not bringing strength he's not bringing wisdom he's not bringing an uh the right kind of attitude because ultimately the husband is who creates the atmosphere for the home amen and and in in all pervasive not just spiritually speaking but but Naturally Speaking as well and so uh the purpose of a man is he should he should look and see that he is the benefactor of his whole family I am the provider and I'm the one that's to bring B every benefit to supply every need of my family now we understand we can't meet their spiritual need on their soul level but we can do the things that are necessary to keep them in the atmosphere where God can bring bring forth the blessing on the level of the Soul see bring them to church be a consistent person go to when there's church on Wednesday don't make an excuse that somebody's tired we're all tired the preacher himself is probably more tired than anybody so come get to church every single time don't make an excuse don't let your wife make an excuse don't let your kids make an excuse be there every time same on Sunday get to Sunday school on time every time 15 minutes early you're asking for the moon I'll I'll ask for the sun next amen amen get to church on time show that it is a priority in your life your children will never leave that path get them to the youth youth camp get them to the the the youth meetings make these things a priority pray in your home pray together when there's a big issue pray together over meals eat meals together what a revelation am and pray over your meals together sit down and enjoy one another's company as a man you set the atmosphere that that's what you want and lead by example so don't trouble your own house there John Gil I got one less than one minute left John Gil says this he that troubleth his own house this from his commentary his family his wife and children and servants by being bitter to the one and by Prov Ving the others to wrath and continually giving out menacing words to the rest or through idleness not providing for his family or through an Overworld Spirit pushing on business and hurrying it on beyond measure or through a Covetous and greedy temper withholding meat and drink and clothes convenient for them my goodness we're we're not to be that kind of man that brings trouble to our own house were to be the kind of man that the whole family would look at say is my father always yeah provided for me not just meat not just food but spiritual meat and emotional meat and mental meat to help me grow and become the person that God wants to be me to be let's stand Heavenly Father we thank you so much for your word we thank you so much Lord for the reality and Light of Christ in this hour Lord I'm so thankful to see young people sitting and listening at the word and not in the
