praise the lord we're going to go right into the word this evening had a thought that came to me very early this morning and just want to look to the lord to see how many have a need amen i have great needs in my life and i know that that the lord is here to answer them all amen [Music] why don't you go ahead brother travis and give me that image [Music] this is a curious image it's very nice image whoever did it did a very nice job this title my sermon tonight now i got this just to give you a little insight i i woke up very early this morning probably a little after four o'clock and just immediately began praying asking the lord you know i had material but i never get i never know for sure if that's the material he wants me to use and so i just i'm always looking to say lord i don't mind last-minute changes and i just prayed there for a little while and just talked to the lord about the service tonight about this service i knew you know we'd have some people here and you'd have needs like me amen and i just always remind the lord of that that lord these are your people and they have needs and i know that you'll meet and i drifted back off to sleep and i don't know somewhere some i forget maybe sometime after six i woke again and immediately started praying again lord it's wednesday there's going to be people gathered and a little more than a little more than 12 or 13 hours from now your family is going to come and gather in a building and we're going to look to you and you just let us talk to lord i don't know how you pray but i talk to him like i'm talking to you he's my friend amen i have a very personal relationship with him and i just laid there and just prayed a little while and just prayed just specifically about this service and i said of course lord you know in my notes there's several different things i've been looking at and could carry on very easily with any one of them and i you know i must have drifted back off just laying there praying and i think sometime then after seven which now by now is really late for me to sleep and sometime after seven o'clock i just came bolt awake and the lord began to speak to my heart immediately he said i want you to go to church and i want you to tell the people the king is coming amen and it it broke before me as an image and i i don't know if i was still in that i'm not a prophet i don't see visions but i don't know if i was in that twilight between wake fully getting awake i know i've i said i won't bolt awake but this was happening as i was coming bolt awake and i heard that and i saw that image and i saw myself excited and i was running to tell everybody the king is coming amen and i i started after i got awake and i got my bearings i said lord that's a wonderful sermon what you're gonna have to build it for me because it's brand new that's all i got the king is coming and so you know i realized that to get to that place friends the world is not a a very peaceful place the war paul talks about how that we fight not against flesh and blood amen but against principalities powers high wickedness in high places powers of darkness now you need to understand that that that battle that's the same battle in revelation 12 where lucifer fought against michael and that started before genesis that started back in the eternities that battle's been raging all the while it it it it fell down into the earth you know what happened in the garden and that battle's been raging and god's family's been fighting it and paul was saying hey we're still fighting it and revelation 12 shows that it's going to finally come to an end and but here we are fighting it and i'll tell you something friends fight with confidence amen because the king is coming amen and so i i kept thinking about this all morning we got a fight there's a battle it's raging and i s and that's the way the lord led me and i i jumped on checking pardon this little testimony but you know i'm taking all this time but i just want to put you put you in the vision with me and i was just making sure checking messages that came in through the night any prayer requests i was catching up getting ready for the bible study this morning catching the last part of brother jd's morning study that's really good if you all want a good bible study to you come on at 7 hey jd 7 30 so you can sleep an extra half an hour and catch a bible study and then uh and then right from there i jumped straight had just a quick little bit of time and jumped into the uh morning lesson there with those brothers from different i say the west coast it's actually going everywhere now it's all kind of all over up in canada and everywhere but as i was thinking about all that and so i'm looking for prayer requests looking for any who's the teacher is it me who is it and i i checked which i rarely check i tell people all the time don't send me stuff on facebook messenger because i might check it once maybe once a month um i'm on whatsapp or you can hit me up sms but i rarely see facebook messenger stuff but i i just for some reason checked it and my sister sister lisa had posted this on our website and when i saw that i went pow perfect and i thought i'm gonna take that image and i'm just gonna show it to the church and tonight i want to speak to you on a battle plan i hope you got one you're gonna need one amen you believe it so we're going to hit first thessalonians 5 we're going to hit ephesians 6. so to open your bibles i want them just to leave that there rather than turning to rather than putting it on the screen let's just open our bibles to first thessalonians 5 17 and you know this is for for me first thessalonians is a scripture that that actually means quite a bit to me especially this fifth chapter and for the reason is is that this was one of the very first sermons i ever took in my ministry nearly 30 years ago when it went uh as a when i evolved to a pulpit ministry and i love this passage i would love to start at verse one um and i and and let's just let's just do that let's start at verse one and i'm going to skip a little bit of it but of the times and seasons brethren you have no need that i write into you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are the children of the light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of the darkness isn't that wonderful now let's look at verse um verse 16. rejoice evermore amen pray without ceasing i just want you to think about that pray without ceasing you know there are people there are certain uh sex of religion there there's a sect in the uh i forget now it seemed like it's somewhere in europe and i saw a documentary on it and it's it's a movement where uh they literally move their lips all day long they take that literally and they they're never not praying and you know i i thought and i i saw it and i thought well i don't i don't really think that's required of us but you know something in the day and hour that you and i live in part of your battle plan needs to be heavy doses of prayer it's never been it it is and it is an essential business is prayer if there was ever uh uh uh something essential it ought to be prayer it's more important brother branham said you you know you can study too much you can read too much but you never can pray too much prayer is the greatest weapon love is the strongest force and prayer is the greatest weapon and i have found in my experience over the years that very often times people get into jams and it never occurs to them to pray and they run to every expert and every person to try to get some help and and sometimes i find that god has to strip you down to to to just take every other option away from you until he gets you down to your last best option that should have been your first option prayer sometimes he strips us down to our last best weapon and i i think that it is so undervalued now ephesians chapter 6 verse 11 turn there with me ephesians 6 and we'll read 11 12 and 13. put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities amen do you believe that against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness i mean it sounds like we are really outnumbered i want you to look at this this is you here's what's arrayed against you all right principalities powers rulers of darkness spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore or because of that or now that you know all that here's some good advice take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day now if language means anything i can say if you don't take the whole armor you won't stand amen you will get taken down it requires the whole armor that you may stand all right that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand then 14 goes stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness it goes on down about talking about the whole body armor and and it's amazing i've always heard it since i was a kid i've heard preachers say there's no armor here for your back so don't run whatever you do you'll take an arrow from behind don't run you've got armor you've got a shield you got a sword use it all right so if you don't if you if you don't do that if you fail to have a battle plan there's a saying uh uh that talks about how that those who fail to prepare prepare to fail yeah uh those who prepare those who fail to prepare uh now i've got it all messed up see my those who fail to prepare say it again if you fail to prepare prepare to fail amen let's pray master we thank you for your love and your kindness to us i stand here lord and i my heart is just just full lord to think on this thought throughout the entire day lord i've just pondered it and pondered it and pondered it and i i feel such a such an excitement in my heart to give this announcement to the people tonight don't fear the king is coming lord we have a battle plan we we have a plan satan is turned loose upon the world like a roaring lion going about but father we have a plan we're prepared we have been prepared for this day that we are living in for quite a while now lord and i believe it is my belief in my heart that lord it's all been by design we would have desired to see lord the catching away of the church decades ago decades ago but father i know that you have had all things under your perfect control and you are clicking along without any there's no reservation in you lord there's no shadow of turning in you father it's it's a it's it now must be a word that comes into the bride because we realize this thing can't just keep going it can't just keep going lord we've come to that time i believe as we said to the church last weekend we are those upon whom the ends of the world have come now lord i've i've prepared the people have sang worship and there's been songs people have come out now that's humanly that's all we can do now father it's going to be up to you and of course the enemy will try to hinder it every way he can but father we're looking to the unseen now i put my faith and confidence in you in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated and i want you just to leave that up brother just leave that image up for me you know the scripture has a number of prophecies regarding the end time that are very unique i i'm not going to turn to them all tonight in fact as i doubt that i'll turn to any other scriptures because i want to leave that up and i want to move quickly i decided not to use a powerpoint for that very reason but but we we're going to find out friends that that when the bible talks about for instance jesus will talk about and it's very familiar to us where when the fig tree puts forth its bud and and we know of course that that is uh more than more than a half a century ago well more it's probably 70 uh probably 70 i think it was 70 years in 2018. and so now here we are moving 70 plus years into the fulfillment of that scripture and to me you know you say wow i thought that generation wasn't to pass and until all things be be finished and be fulfilled but we also have to remember that it's it that jesus also said and all of these things and brother branham emphasized that i think i mentioned that to sunday that jesus that brother branham talks about that's not just the fig tree but when all of these other things begin to come forth and put forth their leave put when all these other things begin to be come into fulfillment now when you read if you're just a a prophecy reader and there's people who just do nothing but study prophecy i'm glad that when i study prophecy i have an answer in the word of god because it's very foreboding and when you read the things that are to come on the world i mean doom and gloom is almost an understatement you're like wow i mean how is anybody going to be able to stand what are the believers going to do when these kinds of things begin to fall upon the earth and it's a fair question you know it's uh it's something to consider and i'm i'm here to tell you and i want to make this point before i get too deep into my notes it is valid and it is noteworthy and you should have confidence in the fact that you are predestinated not to fail that you are that you have a gene of god and that according to the prophecy of jesus there is no way to deceive that last day bride he's already promised himself you amen all right and so you know you're going to find brother branham's going to make some statements and i i was surprised when i when i read the statements in warrior david it's 1955 and brother branham is making such a case for election that even even i was stunned i thought wow this is 1955. this is this is a decade away from brother branham even using the term a gene of god amen but yet when he when he begins to speak about these quotes let me let me read you just a couple of statements that he says here so in the message the great warrior david so he says now we know it's it's god's will to save the lost that's easy all right we know it's god's will to heal the sick now watch now if we can positionally place ourself in his will then it's over he's about to pray for sick people and he's simply trying to get them to understand he's trying to build up their faith and trying to get them to think correctly about the word of god and in order for that to happen the people are going to have to place some confidence not in their flesh but in the fact that christ through election and by the new birth places you positionally in christ and so it's it's almost as if to say it's really not on you it's on him amen all you have to do is begin to confess that and to believe it and walk in it allow this word i'm here to tell you something friends there is nothing more valuable in your life than allowing the word to be the lord and master because the word of god knows every need you you have or will ever have and it already has the answer watch what he says he goes on now here he says so last night he said we were speaking of how that gifts and callings are without repentance it's god's election and foreknowledge is what makes the thing so if we have a desire the bible says it's not him that willeth or him that runeth but it's god that showeth mercy see it's not whether you will or whether you won't or where your desire is it's it's whether it's god's will or not all right watch or what you see so so he says so he says foreknowledge is what makes the thing so if we have a desire the bible said it's not him that willeth or him that runeth it's god that showeth mercy it's not whether you will there it is it's not whether you will or whether you want to amen amen amen it's not whether you will or whether you even want to or where your desire is it's whether it's god's will or not see then we have to find out god's will and if it's that perfect we can just set our faith to that and say that's it and we can run right all the way the will of god runs so you you realize here tonight i want to encourage you with something friends i know the world is falling apart i know you're there is a great army arrayed against you i know the world is burning down i get it disease judgment plague coming pre-tribulation uh things happening in the earth we've been talking quite a bit about it and there's never been a time where god's bride was facing more attack mentally emotionally spiritually but i'm here to tell you something friends you're held up not even by your own choice or by your own will or by your own grit you're held up because he chose you in him before the foundation of the world so he goes on now watch so it's whether god's will or not all right now he says how many christians here raise up your hand and i think we'd we'd in this building not we'd all put our hands up all right so how many christians in here raise up your hand all right you ready for this you got a seat belt on you're not a christian by your desire you're a christian by god's desire i i just i just i just see the devil getting hit between the eyes pow no man can come to me except my father draws him you was elected this is 1955. was elected by god before the foundation of the world to be a christian that's why you're a christian that's to say well i made a choice you were born to make that choice i have a desire that's actually god's desire hallelujah and it's beginning to operate it feels like your desire [Applause] amen amen isn't that amazing now i want you to catch the point brother branham is not just trying to preach a pep rally that i mean that's pep rally material that's not what his aim is he's trying to get the people in this audience where he's preaching this sermon he's trying to get him to understand look if that's all true then you ought to have the greatest amount of confidence in the world why would you then not believe god for whatever your need is whatever you're facing whatever your battle is right now and you might be facing multiple battles on multiple fronts and i'm here to tell you as soon as that one of those battles is over there's another one waiting behind it so why don't you just go ahead and make up your mind now well god's in control and i'm gonna keep going forward because i'm not even a christian because i decided to be i'm a christian because he decided to be well if that's true then how would he not help me win the battle you get the picture all right so he says here and he says you know that people you know you're not a christian by your desire you're a christian by god's desire no man can come except my father draws him first he was elected by god before the foundation of the world to be a christian that's scripture jesus said no man can come except my father calls him first he was elected called then when god elected you he called you and you heeded to his call then he poured the anointing oil on you the holy ghost when the cruse of oil he says now and he he he goes back to david being anointed by samuel and i don't want to get ahead of myself but i want to just give you this foundation and he goes back to where david is being anointed in the anointing oil being poured on him brother branham shows that it's an old testament type of you receiving the holy ghost all right and then here in 1955 he's been preaching all these years and he makes that statement and he says when he poured he says what does the oil represent in the bible holy spirit when he poured the oil upon him he baptized him with the holy spirit and symbol for him and brother branham says amen i hope you get that that just come fresh now not that the oil was the holy ghost brother madam always knew that and brother rabbis knew it would take the holy ghost but it's the first time he goes back in the life of david and he says wow i never caught that before and that just come fresh when david got the anointing oil poured upon him i'm here to tell you something friends brother branham is going to go on in this quote to say at that moment david was king amen and he's a scrubby boy brother brown caught him a scrub had all these big you know jesse's got all these you know sons he's here's all these big strapping you know warrior these guys are all in the army and and david's just a little little scrub out there and tending the father's sheep and as soon as he gets the holy ghost he's a king amen and and so when when you realize friends that to me this is so beautiful because once you get the baptism of the holy ghost you're you're you're already in position to defeat any devil any time any place under any condition you don't have to grow into that you don't have to come way on down the road and eventually after a few years i'll be able to live like a christian nonsense you're already a king when the baptism of the holy ghost comes upon you you already have authority see he says not sparingly he poured it i went all over him a whole hornful that's the way god pours the holy ghost on a man not sparingly just baptizes him into it anointing him with the spirit notice here it is right then when that anointing struck him he was positionally placed as king now you're positionally placed as his bride that's what the token has done in this hour i'm here to tell you something friends the reason the king is coming is because there's a bride to receive him hallelujah and that is what the devil is fighting the devil can't stop the king he's already taken a beating from the king but he's after the bride he's trying to stop his bride but he can't stop her because a bride has been prepared for this hour like esther you've been prepared you've been brought on the scene i don't know why you weren't here a hundred years ago i don't know you know why this happened in your life but i know this you're a believer because he decided you were hallelujah you've got faith because it's his faith and it does not matter i'm here to tell you it does not matter what you're facing the devil can't stop you if you accept that you are now positionally placed in christ as the bride with full authority glory amen amen amen anointing oil struck him he was positionally placed as a king amen you are positionally in christ jesus as kings and priests the moment you receive the holy spirit god places you in the kingdom and air what a beautiful picture there you are it's amazing he says here's david in this battle and it's an interesting thing when you think about the battle of david because you know he's he hears this giant brother ram said that that giant was making his boast but on that day he probably should have shut up because david come into the camp and until an anointed positionally placed child shows up the devil can say whatever he wants amen this is why you see the things that he does because positionally placed sons and daughters of god are are rare in the earth and so you you have the devils in control of the government why say why do they do such evil things really say you know in in the halls of education why do they teach such such things contrary to the scripture you really have to ask that why do we see the fabric of society so vile so polluted you know well what are they feeding on see and so so we find but but once i i'm going to tell you something friends you should walk around every day realizing that you are a duly authorized agent of almighty god and i don't care what situation you walk into and how many non-positionally placed people are there with all of their filth and all of their doubt you're a different person as paul said you're not of the darkness you're of the light you're a child of the light you're not of the night you're of the day paul is drawing a line of demarcation between them and says you're not them and they're not you understand and so so when we go forward you you know we have to have this attitude and i'm here to tell you you're going to need it in this hour and you're not going to successfully deploy it without a big prayer life and a confession that you believe the word of god and laying in the word and stop feeding on all everything from the world otherwise you'll be anemic and poisoned and weak and you won't have no effective power you might be a child of god that you won't have any effective power because you're not prayed up you're you're you're contaminated with too much of the world and that's where i read to you i think it was sunday where paul said you're gonna have to be careful about being overcharged with the things of the world amen at the last days don't be a glutton of laodicea we live here but we we live here as you know as as not as i'm from here i'm not from here i do live here but i'm not from here this world is not my home and we find that once david showed up now it's a different story because now you have in symbol in type a man who has the oil poured on him who is anointed by god who's called and elected to this position and you and you've now the king is in a tent hiding amen but the real king is out there going why don't we go kill him right and the real the the the national king is in there he don't have his armor on he's not planning to fight at all when david's ready to go fight he says okay well let me put my armor on you he don't have it on himself and and you know when david says you know i haven't proved this brother bradham said you know a theological degree doesn't work for a real servant of god i can't use creeds to fight him this armor i haven't proved these things you know let me go in the way that i know to go how was it that you went i i i recognized but brother branham tells it so in such in such great detail how that when david was out there and that lion grabbed a one of the sheep of his father and brother branham says i mean it wasn't like david was like boy is he going to pay david was actually afraid like you and i would be and he had to pray and brother branham said here was his prayer lord that's my father's sheep and i've been i've been put in this position to protect that sheep and you're going to have to help me lord because i'm going after him he had no ability to do it himself but he was trusting on his position that the father had placed him in and he knew if he did that then a supernatural god would have to come on the scene and a lion would get killed by a scrabby boy bear the same way and fortunately you know when he when he says to uh to to saul let me go in the way that i know and you know fortunately there was still enough in that backslid preacher you know saul prophesied with the prophets he's a backslid preacher and fortunately there was just enough gumption left in him to let david do it now it's interesting i want you to think about this for a minute because you've got a number of categories here you've got the king who's saying you can't do it you've got the army of israel cowering back amen you've got a giant saying saying here's what i'm going to do to you and giving him all of these bad prophecies i'm going to feed you to the fowls of the air you've got david's own family david's own family this when i thought about this it blew my mind here's his own family his brothers who saw him get anointed by a vindicated prophet they saw samuel they were standing there and they saw samuel thus saith the lord this is god's king and even his own brothers who were who were in the meetings and saw the miracles amen who walked and saw the supernatural and could not deny it and and and and and you know family members as it were because uh because you know brother branham said they're my brothers and because they claim the name of jesus and i claim it and you know and even even even trinitarians and oneness he said they're my brothers we're one and here you've got all of his brothers who saw the anointing knew it on him knew it was thus saith the lord could not deny it they there's no way to undo what they were standing there witnessing and yet here they are saying oh they even are starting to question his motives even starting to question his character i know why you're here you're acting like you're a christian but i know that's not why you're here you know you're a mischievous kid and you're just a punk and you're just trying to you know stir up some trouble and here is david standing there like christ perfectly completely innocent of that he had he only had one motive and you know what his motive was not to go face a giant his motive was to defend the honor of god amen david it wasn't like that david felt like ultraman david said look the the name of jehovah's in question here i can't let the name of jehovah be questioned and and brother branham talks about that he said you know even if i go down in defeat then i would still i'd still rather go down i'd still rather get defeated trying to defend the honor of the lord it's just like that like the three hebrew children told the king said well we don't know whether he'll deliver us or not we know he can but here's but that's that's a moot point your majesty we we don't know if he will we know we can we don't know if he will but that has nothing to do with it we're here to tell you that we're not going to defile the name of our lord by worshiping an idol do what you want to do we're not doing it and they had no idea the furnace was gonna be hit seven times hotter they had no idea it's gonna get so hot even their captors are gonna get fried putting them in there they had no idea a fourth man was coming in the fire but the fourth man was already waiting on him they had to be willing by faith by a commitment not not faith that we're we're going to get delivered but a committal that we're not going to bow and it doesn't that constant the consequences are of no concern to me i'm not worried about how this turns out i don't worry will i live or die or will i sink or swim i'm here to defend the honor of the name of the word of god and i'm gonna stand on it and then it's up to god friends you understand when you when you face a devil in that kind of frame of mind the devil don't know what to do with you because it wouldn't do him any good to threaten you it doesn't matter it won't do him any good to bring symptoms on you you don't care you don't care i'm here i'm going to claim the word of god well but you got this problem it doesn't matter that has nothing to do with the promise i'm going to claim the word of god i'm going to stand on it will he heal you i don't know it doesn't matter if he takes me i'll be healed if he leaves me then he'll heal me one way or the other i'm going to get healed and so we find then that we have to identify ourselves it's important now i want you to think for a minute which crowd do you belong to the family the army the king goliath the philistines their king their army you know what's amazing say about jason sometimes i just feel so alone and outnumbered there was one human in two national armies facing off two multi-ten thousand multi-tens of thousands army squaring off and kings on both sides and there was one human being on in all of that who was willing to say i will defend the name of god amen i want to tell you something friends i have made up my mind if the whole world won't serve him i'm going to if the whole world rejects him i'm going to accept him and if i have to walk alone brother branham said if i have to uh lay lay on my belly and and drink branch water and eat soda crackers he said i'm it doesn't matter what i they said well brother billy you preached to a to a to a post you preaching like that he said then i'll preach to the post amen i'm here to tell you something friends we're not looking for numbers we're not looking for popularity and god hasn't called you to success god has called you to be faithful not necessarily successful the devil would like to put you on that treadmill but success isn't measured that's not how god measures success i'm successful because he chose me he desired me he called me hallelujah he elected me he has anointed me and i'm going forward the king is coming and he's going to have a queen here to receive him he's going to have a bride and i made up my mind i'm in them i'm one of them i'm part of that number i have a battle plan today what's your battle plan to believe every word what's your battle plan to pray without ceasing what's your battle plan i'm gonna put on the whole armor of god because i know this ain't no joke this ain't disneyland or fairy tale this is real war and there's armies arrayed against me and i'm outnumbered i'm out gunned i might only have a slingshot i might only have a slingshot but i'm gonna fire missiles at that enemy and say you're gonna hit him between the eyes that's pretty hard to do david couldn't do that brother ram said when david hurled that stone and he said that stone took off and he said the holy spirit caught that stone in midair and guided it right caught him right between the eyes oh and tell you something friends if you want to hit a bull's eye on the devil ask the lord to guide it amen amen don't try to do it in your own power it's not about my own power it's not about how great i am it's about how great he is you believe it amen we find that you know the the brother branham had i read this quote to you last time about how that you know god is going to bring forth a bride tree which is the tree of life restored back to him as husband and wife and the garden of eden how's he going to do it by the same word and the same god made manifest in husband and wife catch it the same god made manifest in husband and wife the same god the same single being is going to manifest himself in christ the word and in the bride amen so do you realize that that equates you that that equates you to this that's why brother branham would say put this on your lips and it's the same as deity speaking amen see which is a more powerful version of the bible this ink on paper put together and glued and stapled by uh a publisher or this word living behind skin amen brother brahms said when the books are closed for the last time there were to be flesh that's what the devil's afraid of amen that's what the devil's afraid of he's not afraid of ink on paper there's life in this book we don't disregard our bibles we love our bibles and it takes faith in these words in this ink on paper it takes faith to activate it to make it work but when it comes to working it's looking to work behind skin that's always been god's desire is to have his word that was the adam didn't have a bible amen you understand adam didn't have a bible adam didn't control nature by saying in the name of jesus when stop you understand jesus is his name in redemption because there's a fault he's going to redeem a family but but the whole plan of god is god was going to have an economy of faith a kingdom of faith a kingdom of children who would not just quote his word who would not just mentally agree with his word but who would be living manifestations of his word the word made flesh has always been god's plan and sacrifices and offerings thou hast had no pleasure but a body has thou prepared me amen jesus didn't even carry a bible i'm just making a point you understand i'm not not subtracting this is this is this is our book and this is the book faith in the in this book backs down devils but you understand that that eventually the books will be closed hallelujah i want to know that that my whole life is one one complete unified person who has complete faith perfect faith to take any challenge of the devil you say oh oh my the world's been going on the world's been going on you know it's interesting because in the early days of the church and they they didn't know brother branham talks about that in the church age series how that you know god didn't let them know that there's going to be would it discourage them it's going to be 2 000 years you know they every age has believed in the imminency of his coming and you even have disciples saying you know he he he won't terry and he'll come and and he wasn't actually by his standards because he was going to come in the last days plural the last two days the last 2 000 years and he was going to work all down through the church ages remember in teaching on the book of revelation that that the bible he's all the time saying i'm alpha and omega and brother branham says notice he doesn't mention the middle i'm alpha and omega i'm the beginning and i'm the ending now he is in the midst of his seven lamps brother branham even even used it he says if you're standing in front of all the seven lamps and he said if you notice he said when he stretches out at his hands his hand is touching ephesus and laodicea well what about the other five in the middle he's walking in the midst of his lampstands don't imagine that he's not in every age but the difference is that in every age while he's in every age everything in the age is not him men are starting to inject theory and creed and man-made opinion and they're starting to change the word of god but he says i'm alpha when it was perfect and i'm i'm omega because i'm going to bring it back to perfect i'm going to bring back a token i'm going to bring back a jubilee i'm going to bring back an abstract and there's going to be a people just like paul stand at the last day and conquer this enemy once and for all so you are the ones upon whom the ends of the world have come you are that omega you are that fullness and now we find ourselves here in a most amazing hour unique by many standards the the the church you know as it began to as it began to uh as time just kept happening amen and time you know the people the people had believed they looked for the coming of the lord it was going to be any time it's going to be any minute they met on the first day of every week just like we do they went house to house they had prayer meetings they took the lord's supper they had life they understand they they worked jobs they paid taxes they you know they had families just like you and i they they had some persecution going on but but but we realized that that was because in many cases they were going to have to give their lives whereas the battle there and during those bloody times in the ages was that they would give their lives but brother branham actually says in a way in a certain fold that it was almost an easy out because if life just got too bad and too tough and you just want to go to heaven so bad he said you just step out and go the pope is the antichrist and they would kill you and you could just go quickly and get it over with just go okay i just can't tell you anymore i'm going to go out on the street corner and declare that rome is the false prophet and the pope is false prophet in rome is the beast system and and and yeah they might torture me the rest of the day and half tomorrow and then they'll kill me and then i'll be in glory and brother branham talks about how that that that option is not open to us any and here we have to strive strive daily keep striving keep slogging it out and you're in a worse age than them you're in a worse age than them you you've got the convergence of noah and sodom you've got the convergence of you know you you you've got we're we're the time you're at the time where all the kings of the earth are in our are our uh that's a crass way to say it oh i'm not going to say it that way all kings of the earth are are are in the bed chamber with the beast system all the captains of the sea are in her commerce amen so and and so here we are we're so outnumbered globally the whole system of politics and religion and education social entertainment everything is oh you're swimming upstream friends every day of your life you're you're constantly having to press press press press press you believe it and and we find that that now you've got the the you know you're not we're not dealing with a city a little city in the plains called sodom now we're dealing with sodom multiplied globally in the highest offices and now every system from politics to religion to news to entertainment social values write to the neighbors in your neighborhood amen who are no doubt nice people but if you begin to say here in 2021 homosexuality is a mortal sin you're gonna go to hell for it they would go wow aren't you wow you shouldn't say that are you that's so politically incorrect you need to be more accepting i'm accepting of of god's word i'm against no man i'm against the devil and i'm for god and however that makes the chips fall the chips fall but i'm here to defend the name of god i'm here to defend his honor and so we find that that you've got the days of noah you know what the days of noah were that every man's mind over the whole world was evil continually that means that 24 7 365 all the population was evil now you've got that increased sodom increased all the kings and captains of the earth increased and it's all converged in this last day but he's promised i'm coming back with an omega i'm coming back and you're you're talking about outnumbered you might feel outnumbered friends you're you're you know when the early church when they didn't see it happening it looked to them like nothing's happening and so much that the apostles have to start preaching hey hey come on earnestly contend for the faith come on y'all we need to earn it stop slipping you're starting to slip you know earnestly contend for the faith can you imagine what pastors had to put up with when all the last when the last disciples and apostles were gone and those grievous wolves started coming in can you imagine loyal pastors pounding it away in the pulpit come on saints you know that's not what paul taught us come on friends that's not what peter preached on the day of pentecost you got to have a real new birth and and slowly and slowly and slowly you know that beast system took it all over and you're here now in satan's eden he's the god of this age it's over spread the whole world the convergence of every possible bad thing that could ever happen is now upon us you better have a battle plan you better be ready you better have some armor on hallelujah amen amen because this is where we have arrived we find that you know we we can feel like and i gotta close and i'm trying to close in seven minutes once brother dig says don't get scared i'm fitting the clothes and then he'll preach another hour i'm not going to do that so we we can find that it's almost as if there's been this long very long um not a pause but a really long space of time many decades since a prophet opens the seals 1963 on penn street here in a little podunk town still pretty much that and and and one of the greatest events the one of the greatest bible events that was that was ever going to happen for god's family the opening of the seven seals 2 000 years in the making ever since the church fell away and christ has to sit back down seals the word up intercedes on behalf of ignorance for seven church ages comes to the end and now he's gonna break it open and he's gonna bring back the he's gonna make the mighty god it's gonna be unveiled amen and when he unveils when when he has the unveiling of god suddenly we realize oh wow we already knew he wasn't three but now we we realize why the oneness were wrong because now we see his body is included we see that his body is included brother brown talks about how that when you're born in the baptism of the holy ghost you're brought into the very deity of jesus christ amen that you're part of god's godhead this is his economy this is the kingdom he's been trying to build and it looks like wow there's been such a long time you know that it it it it seems like from the time of the shout you know to the time when the trumpet sounds and we're going to have a resurrection of the saints and you know it just seems like a lot of things have had to happen and here we're we're still here but it's been necessary amen first of all all those names had to be caughty we can't leave here without that last name on the lamb's book of life amen i mean the bride has been has been has been being fit to the word not the other way around the word was never going to change the bride had to be fit to it she had to be she had to grow across these decades the bride has had to grow into her position as the final voice to the final age and you know something i mean let me just throw this out here this might seem like a almost like a an awkward elephant in the room but i'm just gonna say it the way it feels on my heart you know all these decades since even before prophet left we had people you know having other little camps and other little ideas even when a prophet was there and the prophets got to go take trips and rebuke them and change them and calm them down and you know and he keeps calling he said they're my children you know and and you had men misunderstanding who the prophet was what the word was what it was to do they misunderstood the seals they misunderstood marriage and divorce they they're doing things wrong and brother brandon's having to try to fix it and and they're saying oh mercy's over brother brennan should we quit our jobs or should should we still should we still work and brother brown said well the only one that will work as a christian man of course he said good grief y'all don't have i not brother branham even felt like he was responsible yeah he said my goodness how could you come up with that of course there's still mercy of course you should still keep your jobs brother branham should we he's getting letters and getting phone calls brother branham should we meet under under the bridge what yeah i heard i heard there's a man in his yard we heard the it was the rapture was happening and brother brown said sir you you you've got me confused i don't know what you're talking about but yet we find that god has family members sometimes who get a little confused amen those disciples all ran for the hills in the garden of gethsemane they all lost their mind it took a little while for them to come back around and peter thought he had he'd sealed his doom i i i love that statement i heard some years ago brother paula fontaine may he's talking about those disciples you know fled and and and lost their mind and then had to come back around he said you know something friends let's just admit this it said this thing ain't over yet come on could we have that attitude this thing ain't over yet rather than condemning the rest of the world who maybe don't agree with it exactly like us why don't we make our calling and election sure put on the whole armor stay in prayer and let's just be the right example amen i don't i don't believe and in fact as i i know for sure there there are groups within the message that love this message love god's prophet and and and i don't exactly agree with their position they don't exactly agree with mine but you know get around them sometime talk to them you know what you'll find out they love this message as much as you do they love a prophet as much as you do they in fact is they think you don't love it quite enough and and i just say okay there's this group and there's that group and i understand we're going to have fanaticism my point is that jesus you know it i i that's what i love that scene i i play it over and over where jesus is standing there to his fishermen in in in the uh in in that uh chosen one of the greatest most epic jesus stories bar none running away the second next competitor is miles behind it the greatest jesus story i've ever encountered and he's standing there and he's mad he's filled up their boat to where it's sinking with fish and peter's falling on his knees and go away from me i'm a sinful man and jesus invites him to follow him a sinful man a failure and jesus says follow me and later when he calls matthew they can't believe it do you understand what he hits guy's a traitor he's taxing us and cheating us he works for rome and and yet this is and jesus tells him he says he says i'm gonna make you fishers of men fishers of men and he makes the statement he says i want you to go and he says i want you to bring all kinds in bring go to go to everything catch everything you can and he says i'll separate them later i just about start screaming every time he says that says go catch them go find them bring them in get all kinds i'll separate them later i don't need you to do it i just need you to catch them i'll send forth my angels and that's the ministry of the last day but we're not separating them based on our theory we're just preaching the word of god and the word of god people who can't take it run away from it but i'm here to tell you something friends we got we might be splittered here and splintered there in this group here in this group there but i'm here to tell you it's not going to be a misunderstood doctrine that's gonna you're never gonna keep somebody whose name is on the lamb's book of life i don't care what the condition of their life is or the condition of their teaching is they're gonna be there there's not gonna be one empty chair at the marriage supper of the lamb how about we just have the love of god and just keep preaching it and keep living it and keep loving and keep letting god sort out his family this is our battle plan the king is coming we need to be an array we need to be ready we need to choose who am i in the david story who am i choose friends choose who you want to be are you going to be the backslid son of god in the tent the king you're going to be the backslid preacher have ain't got enough courage to put his armor on anymore you're gonna be the the family who saw the miracles of god and then try to try to turn around and attack it you're gonna be goliath got to be in the army i got one man i want to be like david there's an anointing came on david david prophesied when he got out in that field now catch it he didn't he didn't prophesy until he went to war and when he went to war and actually armed himself with his slingshot the the the war tribe the you know the the the war room we've already figured it out the king wants me to go in his arm i ain't gonna do it take my own okay go i've already went past my brothers i don't care what they say i know everybody's afraid but i'm gonna go facing he gets five smooth stones takes his sling and heads to heads to the field of battle and when that giant makes his boast against david an anointing falls on david and david starts prophesying now there's two prophecies going forward one from one from christ and one from antichrist and they're both pretty much saying the same thing i'm going to take your head off and feed it to the fouls of the air and david said you know it's not that david had bigger more brave sounding words than goliath but david had a secret and here's what goliath was missing this cost him his life david said your boast is because of your shield and sword you're coming at me with your shield and your sword and your spear but i'm coming at you in the name of the lord that's the difference goliath i'm not i got a slingshot i'm not even trusting in the slingshot i'm coming to you in the name of the lord god that's that was the difference and that made david victorious and goliath got a uh let's say a rude awakening he went to sleep never woke up that's what it takes friends that's what it takes it doesn't matter i i understand how the devil can come into our lives disrupt our home challenge you challenge you for your family amen i i had a a wonderful uh conversation a sister sent me and just like any good mommy would be praying for her children pray i tell you we need more mommies like that praying and it's it's the burden of her heart that all of her kids make it i can tell you that was sister debbie's burden nothing mattered didn't matter as long as all of her kids made it in and and mothers praying that prayer and and and she gave me a testimony here here i had a testimony of getting up at four she says she says to me says she says i woke up at three in the morning she said and here i am and she said and i said i put a tape on and she said and and and and i'm just hitting some highlights and she said and as the tape is playing she said i drifted off and she said i i went into a deep sleep and she said and i've had this happen so many times where i'm studying a thought or i got a need or something i'm praying about or some kind of situation i'm facing and i'll and i'll i'll i'll have a tape playing and i'll go in my office maybe mid-afternoon take a 10-minute power nap 50-minute power nap and sure is anything you can't believe how many times it's happened i'll literally come awake hearing the statement i needed not even knowing it's on that tape and suddenly just wake up and hear him say something this sister saying to me it's the most amazing thing she says i drifted back off i went into a deep sleep and she said i came awake and as i came awake she said i heard these words just believe on the lord jesus christ and thou and thy house shall be saved hallelujah was god answering a mother's heart who's concerned and praying for her children and brother branham she sent me the whole quote brother m says if you can believe for yourself you can believe for your house also have enough faith in god to believe for yourself then believe for your children also come on friends let's believe it hallelujah that same faith will save your children that saved you if you just keep praying amen this is your armor if you just god will answer prayer here's two beautiful prophet words ready ready don't worry amen don't worry what should i do just ask him and believe it and get it anchored in your heart and just keep moving on that's the way it's done the world's got every kind of gizmo and every kind of thing say oh that's the way it's done well that's whatever you're doing i don't even care about i want my family saved i want my children saved i want my grandchildren i want your

plan to have um on valentine's sunday it falls on a sunday and i thought what better time i've had a lot of requests um to have some kind of some one-on-one you know not behind a pulpit teaching a class but kind of in a casual environment to you know talk about married couples and marriage and the principles of of being a husband principles of leading of family the relationship between husbands and wives and so we decided to uh no better time than the president brother mike and sister wanda uh who have a dynamite place for it have opened up even on short notice uh they're home this sunday afternoon and i sent that announcement out i'm sure you got it it went into the whatsapp i went out to the entire church for couples married or in courtship and we're going to just have a casual atmosphere of coffee and desserts the after you've had your lunch we've long been out of church we've had fellowship you've had your lunch we've had fellowship then we're going to go and have a nice little get together kind of a little sweethearts get together and have some fellowship and talk about the things of god now all sounds great right i've had one rsvp one couple out of the entire assembly now by the mat he'll be out of town brother jd i think will be gone again you're ministering somewhere off this weekend hey jason and so uh and maybe some others are out of town and so if it's if it's let me say it this way if it's a scheduling issue uh no problem for me to push it back a week you know that that would give matt time to get back jd time to get back i know there's some saints in florida maybe they can't do it this weekend i don't know i'm just simply saying if it's a scheduling issue then please let me know and i'm happy to push it back a week if it's not a scheduling issue and you just don't want to come fine great um we'll just go forth and have it for whoever wants to come i promise you that'll be perfectly okay because i'm gonna i'm gonna do them again i'm not just gonna do it's not gonna be one and done we wanna start doing some more things we wanna start doing that and things like that so uh i'm happy to do it either way but i sure would like to have some communication from the assembly we ask rsvp uh for a reason and uh we need that more for more than just figuring out how much dessert to have amen all right so like i said be clear if it's a scheduling issue and enough people say i'd love to do it but we're going to be out of town then i'll just reschedule and push it back a weekend but if it's just uh you know there's only a couple that want to come then we'll just go with a couple and we will have a good time amen praise the lord god bless your friends let's bow our heads and i'll let you be dismissed in prayer father we thank you for this wonderful evening that we've had thank you for your word lord i sure was depending on you and you as always you never fail you never let us down lord you always come and give us what we need wow you are amazing so i i the devil fighting me so hard lord but you just stepped right around him as if he didn't even matter lord i'm grateful for that he doesn't matter lord he can't stop your word he can't stop you father he attacks the vessels that carry the word but he can't stop the word when you're determined to do something lord and there's no power in heaven or earth that can stop you and if you're determined something's not gonna happen it don't matter what you do you're not going to make it happen so lord i like it that way because that leaves you in complete control and that's the way i feel to say this i sleep safe at night knowing you're in control so i give you these people and all those listening and streaming lord we give them into your care in jesus name
