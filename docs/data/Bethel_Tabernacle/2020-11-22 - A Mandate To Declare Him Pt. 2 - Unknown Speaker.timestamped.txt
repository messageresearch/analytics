[3:17] praise the lord good morning god bless

[3:46] 1. unto the angel of the church of
[3:48] ephesus

[4:31] done in this day
[4:32] so may you help us now lord that's all
[4:35] we can do is approach you
[4:37] humbly with preparation lord in our
[4:40] hearts and minds ready we commit it to
[4:42] you in jesus name
[4:44] amen god bless your friends you can be
[4:46] seated
[4:51] i'd like to just say again how much i
[4:54] have enjoyed uh
[4:56] this series and it's been a little bit
[4:59] of a dual thing for me because we're
[5:01] sharing it
[5:02] uh every morning online to a group of
[5:06] the brothers you all met brother esteban
[5:08] who was here
[5:09] with us the previous weekend and he's
[5:12] one of the regulars
[5:14] that we have on that
[5:17] class that we do every morning seven
[5:20] days a week even those brothers on the
[5:21] west coast
[5:22] they even want it on saturday and sunday
[5:24] i figured they would surely want a break
[5:26] but
[5:27] i suggested it even and i immediately
[5:29] unanimously got over
[5:31] overwhelmed with no no we want it seven
[5:33] days a week
[5:34] like so you're gonna get up at four in
[5:36] the morning on saturday and sunday
[5:38] yes absolutely so amen i think it's a
[5:42] marvelous thing
[5:44] but we were looking how that
[5:47] you know in our in our last time we
[5:49] finished off in part
[5:51] 12 with the brother branham referring to
[5:55] the
[5:56] the the great message of the second
[5:58] appearing
[6:00] of elijah he said from the statue of a
[6:02] perfect man
[6:03] we were ending with that how that the
[6:05] just live by faith said luther
[6:07] sanctification through wesley then come
[6:10] in brotherly kindness through laodicea
[6:12] and we believe of course he's meaning
[6:15] the brotherly kindness in the age of
[6:17] philadelphia and we believe the great
[6:20] message of the second appearing of
[6:22] elijah in the last day
[6:23] will sweep the land and of course
[6:26] it's not it's in one sense it's
[6:29] absolutely accurate what he said because
[6:30] we find
[6:32] that as it relates to the to the time
[6:35] of the age of the church then it
[6:38] certainly
[6:39] is um laodicea as an extension
[6:42] of or a continuation of philadelphia
[6:46] we found that the bride now here we are
[6:49] at the very tail end of laodicea
[6:51] and the light has gone out to the church
[6:54] age the age of the church
[6:56] and uh physically you know we're here in
[6:59] time but we also recognize a spiritual
[7:02] awakening that has happened in our day
[7:05] and that
[7:05] spiritual awakening is found in isaiah
[7:09] 60 and verse 2 for behold the darkness
[7:12] shall cover the earth
[7:13] and gross darkness the people but the
[7:16] lord shall arise
[7:17] upon thee and his glory shall be seen
[7:21] upon thee now interestingly enough and i
[7:23] didn't plan it this way
[7:24] but that's going to be my opening text
[7:28] for the regular service so go figure
[7:31] that's just the lord doing it that way
[7:34] so
[7:34] what we've been trying to do is to
[7:37] concentrate on the power
[7:38] behind the history we wanted to
[7:40] especially now we've spent a lot of time
[7:43] breaking down the revelation of jesus
[7:45] christ in chapter one
[7:46] we connected chapter one to chapter two
[7:49] spent a lot of time in that and we want
[7:52] to as i was
[7:53] went back to hear the exact part where i
[7:56] left off last time
[7:57] and i realized that we're just still not
[7:59] getting into the nuts and bolts of the
[8:01] verse by verse
[8:02] as it breaks down into the church ages
[8:04] so i want to do that today by the help
[8:06] of the lord
[8:07] so we've taken our first chapter two
[8:10] verse 1
[8:12] unto the angel of the church of ephesus
[8:15] amen and so um let me
[8:18] make one quick check on something here
[8:21] um yeah okay so unto the angel of the
[8:23] church of ephesus write these things
[8:26] saith he that holdeth the seven stars in
[8:28] his right hand
[8:29] who walketh in the midst of the seven
[8:32] candlesticks so
[8:34] when we talk about the power behind the
[8:37] history
[8:38] we are realizing that right right away
[8:41] that and i've pointed this out in
[8:43] previous lessons
[8:45] that god opens up every age
[8:48] and every message to every messenger in
[8:51] each age all seven of them and if you'll
[8:54] notice as we go along
[8:56] he he repeats things that he has said
[8:59] about himself in chapter one
[9:01] that's so that you can identify the
[9:04] power
[9:05] behind the history does it match the
[9:07] word because
[9:09] god's absolute is the word and so
[9:12] we realize that as we keep our mind
[9:14] straight on bible prophecy i want to
[9:16] make this point this morning
[9:18] this is a point that brother lonnie used
[9:19] to make a lot is that
[9:22] when we talk about bible prophecy that
[9:25] it's not
[9:26] it's not neces it's not necessarily or
[9:28] merely as
[9:29] if i would say it's not merely that god
[9:32] is looking down
[9:33] the stream of time and he can see
[9:36] everything that's going to happen
[9:37] and so he comes and puts it in a book
[9:40] that's not
[9:40] that's not bible prophecy bible prophecy
[9:44] is that god has a purpose
[9:46] and in order to accomplish that purpose
[9:49] he is going to lay out a path that
[9:51] humanity
[9:52] is going to follow and his power is
[9:54] going to be behind that prophecy
[9:56] to make that come to pass so it's not
[9:59] it's not just merely looking from his
[10:01] foreknowledge and saying
[10:03] well i see that this is going to happen
[10:04] it's not coming to the last day and say
[10:06] well i see that a bride makes it so let
[10:08] me go ahead and tell them
[10:10] you know i saw someone faithful and true
[10:12] no when he
[10:13] sees you as faithful and true in chapter
[10:16] 19
[10:17] that the bride was found faithful that's
[10:19] because he determined
[10:20] that you're going to be found faithful
[10:23] and so
[10:24] we realize that god is never
[10:27] out of control and satan has never
[10:30] gained a victory
[10:32] i love saying that god has never been
[10:35] out of control
[10:37] and satan has never had a victory he has
[10:40] been defeated
[10:41] by god in fact is we find in the
[10:44] scripture
[10:45] that satan and i know he don't like to
[10:47] hear this this is going to burn him
[10:49] amen but i love saying it amen that he's
[10:52] just a tool in the hand of god
[10:54] just like we were saying last and last
[10:57] service
[10:58] you're a tool in the hand of god and
[11:00] kings and monarchs are tools in the hand
[11:02] of god the vatican is a tool russia
[11:05] is a tool amen communism is a tool
[11:08] in the hand of god i love realizing
[11:11] friends
[11:11] that you don't need to worry about
[11:13] anything god's in control
[11:15] and i know there's chaos in the world i
[11:17] get that we see it i see the same
[11:19] headlines you see
[11:21] but you know i'm going to tell you
[11:22] something friends god knows what it
[11:24] takes to get this church perfected and i
[11:28] wanna
[11:28] let me let's let's turn that in a little
[11:30] closer god knows
[11:32] what it's gonna take for you to be
[11:34] perfected
[11:35] so don't don't stress over the social
[11:38] upheaval don't stress over the political
[11:40] upheaval don't stress over the
[11:42] polarization
[11:43] and the hatred and the and the you know
[11:45] the all the terrible things that are
[11:47] going on
[11:48] listen we're not a part of that we're
[11:50] part of a different part of the word
[11:52] that's coming to pass not because the
[11:54] devil
[11:55] has been able to do anything but because
[11:57] god ordered it so and has allowed the
[12:00] devil
[12:01] so whatever's happening in your life
[12:03] just lean back on the
[12:05] bosom of the lord and say master i trust
[12:07] you
[12:08] for everything that i need in
[12:11] my life so god knows what we need to be
[12:15] perfected he knows what it's going to
[12:17] take
[12:18] to get the the character
[12:21] of the power behind the history there's
[12:23] a being behind that
[12:25] and he has a nature and he has a
[12:26] character and the
[12:28] the the the beauty of the godhead
[12:32] is that he has a body amen that's
[12:35] just like him the same as him that's
[12:38] what hebrews 13 8
[12:39] promises promises us is that in
[12:43] that when jesus christ shows up in a
[12:46] form at the end time
[12:47] it'll be just like he's always been amen
[12:50] now we're not talking about his corporal
[12:52] return where we meet him in the air
[12:54] we're not talking about the time when he
[12:56] comes to the earth
[12:57] and revelation 19 we're talking about
[13:00] his
[13:00] life infused into his church right now
[13:04] and so you already are the body of the
[13:07] lord you already
[13:09] are part of the formula of his
[13:12] of his expression in the godhead and
[13:14] that's why brother branham could say
[13:16] she is him now he's not saying she's
[13:19] literally
[13:20] him he makes another statement you're
[13:21] the blood of god by the spirit
[13:23] but we realize that that i came into
[13:26] this world
[13:27] unlike jesus who was this his blood was
[13:30] a spoken word creation mine was not
[13:32] but you understand i had a gene of god
[13:34] in me that didn't come from my earthly
[13:36] parents that came from god
[13:39] and therefore when that's alive then i
[13:41] have had a spiritual blood transfusion
[13:44] and i'm no longer
[13:45] merely the son of ed and gene watkins i
[13:48] realize that i am now
[13:49] a part of the family of jesus christ
[13:53] so brother branham when he's drawing out
[13:56] the church ages he makes it makes it
[13:58] clear and feast of trumpets
[14:00] that he drew that that image by vision
[14:03] now
[14:04] that was refreshing for me this morning
[14:06] when i re-read that quote and feast of
[14:08] trumpets i'm going to read it for you
[14:10] because you know a lot of times if we're
[14:12] not careful we'll tend to think of the
[14:13] church ages
[14:15] as well that was prior to the seals and
[14:17] you know we've had to adjust it a little
[14:19] bit nothing doing that chart brother
[14:21] branham drew
[14:22] he drew it by vision watch what he says
[14:24] it's his 1964
[14:26] feast of the trumpets now the hidden
[14:28] mysteries of christ was
[14:30] fully revealed in the seven seals it
[14:32] revealed first
[14:34] the seven church ages opened up the ages
[14:37] and placed them positionally both with
[14:40] history
[14:41] and with the bible and set them in
[14:44] position how they was
[14:45] and we found ourself in the last church
[14:48] age
[14:48] being the laodicean church age which was
[14:51] the most corruptible
[14:53] of all the church ages even from the
[14:55] very first from
[14:57] ephesians was a great church age and
[14:59] then
[15:00] how here the holy spirit
[15:03] giving me a vision and seeing what would
[15:06] take place
[15:07] i draw it on the blackboard two years
[15:10] ago
[15:10] here it is up here on the drawing that
[15:14] uh that how that the light was fading
[15:17] off of the earth
[15:18] which would be exactly the way the light
[15:20] come on the earth
[15:22] as the gospel and how it would fade in
[15:25] and out not knowing it at the time what
[15:28] it meant
[15:29] and how it would be when he preached it
[15:32] in the church ages
[15:33] he drew it according to a vision that's
[15:35] like moses when he built the tabernacle
[15:38] in the wilderness and god instructed him
[15:40] make sure you build it exactly like the
[15:42] one you saw in heaven
[15:43] and so we realized brother branham
[15:46] moving by a vision and then once the
[15:48] seals were open to us
[15:50] then it all began to disconnect dots in
[15:52] his mind and he
[15:53] he was he is here rejoicing friends
[15:56] because brother branham really is
[15:58] realizing with the opening of the seals
[16:00] he had not run in vain and he had not
[16:02] been crazy
[16:03] like they said he was and he was not
[16:05] full of the devil like they said he was
[16:07] and it never
[16:08] it puzzled him how they would say billy
[16:10] that's spiritualism that's of the devil
[16:12] and brother branham would say you know i
[16:14] could never figure out
[16:16] how could i be of the devil and love god
[16:18] so much
[16:19] i want to tell you something friends i
[16:21] don't always understand my life you
[16:23] don't always understand yours but here's
[16:24] one thing i can't deny i love him
[16:27] i love his word i love his righteousness
[16:29] i love his holiness
[16:31] i detest my weaknesses i detest my
[16:33] failures i did test
[16:35] when i come up coming up short i'm here
[16:38] to be the maximum version of me
[16:40] that god saw before the foundation of
[16:42] the world
[16:43] so we realize now that as god building
[16:46] it this way
[16:48] what he says unto the angel of the
[16:50] church of ephesus
[16:52] you can best believe there was going to
[16:54] be an angel to that church and god
[16:57] already had paul had already run his
[16:59] course and there was going to be a
[17:01] messenger to the second one and there
[17:02] was going to be to the third
[17:04] and there was going to be a message with
[17:06] that messenger
[17:08] and so here we are today friends you say
[17:10] well we've had a messenger in our day
[17:13] now you'd have a hard time not believing
[17:15] that since the supernatural so attended
[17:17] the ministry
[17:18] but many times the error that we find
[17:22] ourselves making is very catholic it's a
[17:24] very catholic error
[17:26] error and in that we we give
[17:30] all the attention to the messenger and
[17:33] we don't
[17:33] catch that he had a message and so
[17:37] a lot of times it becomes an idolatry
[17:40] which is contrary to the message he
[17:42] brought and we
[17:43] see that happening today and not to
[17:45] diminish the messenger because you can't
[17:48] diminish something god has done
[17:51] so i'm not i'm not here to diminish it
[17:53] and i don't need to defend that he does
[17:55] william branham doesn't need defending
[17:57] god defended him
[17:58] i don't need i don't i don't have to
[18:00] defend that i believe he was god's
[18:02] prophet if people don't want to believe
[18:04] it
[18:04] fine i do but what i want to concentrate
[18:07] on
[18:08] is what was the message why did he come
[18:11] and what message did he bring and that's
[18:14] because remember
[18:15] there's a power behind the history and
[18:18] when i get on the other side
[18:19] i want to look back and see the power
[18:22] that was behind my history
[18:25] amen so we realized that this is how god
[18:28] would do it now it's not entrapment
[18:30] a lot of times people can think of it
[18:31] that way but that is
[18:33] it that god entrapped because he's he
[18:35] determines these things
[18:36] beforehand but in it and beforehand but
[18:39] in every time
[18:40] he he offers uh them the opportunity
[18:45] to advance through the age uh that
[18:48] and and yet and yet he's done that since
[18:51] the fall in the garden of eden
[18:53] he offered cain away forward he's
[18:56] offered everyone a way forward
[18:58] he they they he knows who will take it
[19:00] and who won't
[19:01] but he doesn't force them to take it or
[19:04] not take it
[19:05] he just simply his foreknowledge knows
[19:07] who will and who won't
[19:08] and therefore but but when we talk about
[19:11] his elect family like a nun to
[19:13] abel because remember people who don't
[19:16] like the terminology to say
[19:18] there's there's humanity and there's an
[19:21] elect lady
[19:22] people don't like that but all i do is
[19:24] go back to the garden of eden and say
[19:27] well clearly cain was not of the same
[19:30] lineage as abel
[19:31] and that's very clear in the scripture
[19:34] so clear that a child could understand
[19:36] it
[19:36] now that's not god's fault that but god
[19:39] has allowed these things to come forward
[19:41] but just know this
[19:43] there is a power operating in your
[19:45] history
[19:46] there is a power operating in this
[19:49] church
[19:49] and you can rely on it i want you to
[19:52] know i know this age is wicked
[19:54] i know it's impossibly horrible but
[19:56] there's a power here friends
[19:59] i know that it seems hopeless and it
[20:01] seems wearying and it seems troubling
[20:03] and it is perplexing and it is
[20:05] unsettling but there's a power
[20:07] in control of it all
[20:11] so we realized then that you know he he
[20:14] he he looks you know we we we see
[20:18] how that you know god is aiming for
[20:20] something
[20:21] and so in the age here when he comes to
[20:24] open up this ephesian church age
[20:27] you'll notice that that as he's doing it
[20:29] unto the angel of the church of ephesus
[20:31] write these things and he describes
[20:34] himself
[20:35] he that holdeth the seven stars which
[20:38] walketh in the
[20:39] in the midst of the seven golden
[20:41] candlesticks
[20:42] and so we realize that in each age god
[20:45] is aiming at something and
[20:47] we're not going to get further than the
[20:48] first verse today but all the way down
[20:51] through you'll see how he describes
[20:53] himself describes the history describes
[20:55] what's going on
[20:56] warns them of what he sees coming and so
[20:59] in
[20:59] every age god is aiming at something
[21:03] and and that's you know that that that
[21:06] that
[21:06] that's where we differ because
[21:10] you know cain's choice ended up as a
[21:13] fatal choice
[21:15] judas the choice judas made was a fatal
[21:18] choice it was a choice
[21:19] he couldn't recover from and i'm here to
[21:22] tell you
[21:22] that the bride of christ makes a choice
[21:25] she can't recover from
[21:26] amen and it's not a fatal choice it's a
[21:29] glorious choice
[21:30] you say have you ever made a fatal
[21:33] choice i did i died one day
[21:35] and was reborn in christ and the
[21:37] decision i made for christ
[21:39] and i want to say to you today if you're
[21:41] going to make a decision for christ let
[21:42] it be a fatal one
[21:44] let it make sure you die don't just turn
[21:46] over a new leaf
[21:47] because that's not the image he's trying
[21:50] to get to
[21:51] in the history that's not the power
[21:53] behind the history that's not the
[21:55] that's not why the power behind the
[21:58] history
[21:58] came all right so the first age was
[22:02] aimed at and relaxed that's what ephesus
[22:04] meant
[22:05] and uh aimed at and relaxed and we can
[22:07] see
[22:08] why god had to rebuke this ephesian
[22:10] church age
[22:11] because they were they were aiming you
[22:14] know they were
[22:15] they were aiming remember aiming and
[22:18] then relaxed and so they're
[22:20] they're they're why is god rebuking them
[22:22] because they're aiming to be conformed
[22:24] to the image of christ
[22:27] that's what they were aiming at but they
[22:29] got relaxed
[22:31] in where the where the goal was
[22:34] they got relaxed in what it meant to
[22:36] accomplish that
[22:38] and so they they began to
[22:41] set the the goal marker to something
[22:44] less
[22:45] than what it had been in the upper room
[22:48] you understand
[22:49] as the age is moving on paul goes off
[22:52] the scene
[22:53] and john comes with a message to the
[22:55] church to say
[22:56] listen paul set you to aim to aim
[23:00] for the high calling and and you have
[23:02] that
[23:03] intention you believe you're aiming it
[23:05] and that's great you
[23:06] are aiming for it but here's a problem
[23:09] you're
[23:09] you're relaxing the standard you're
[23:12] relaxing
[23:13] the prayer you're relaxing the marker
[23:15] that says you've achieved it
[23:17] so you're not going as far you're not
[23:20] becoming as much as
[23:22] they were when they came out of the
[23:24] upper room
[23:25] and that's what it means aiming but
[23:27] relaxed
[23:28] see and so and of course the next stage
[23:31] is bitterness and dying per
[23:33] smyrna means bitterness and dying
[23:34] pergamus means
[23:36] married that's so fitting because you
[23:38] know it's
[23:39] if that's the age of pergamos where they
[23:41] married
[23:42] and then it was right after columba goes
[23:45] off the scene 606
[23:46] comes and they they're fully put
[23:50] uh they're put away uh and divorced by
[23:52] christ because now they have
[23:54] fully chosen it's no longer a saying
[23:56] they've actually seated a false prophet
[23:58] and they put a crown on him and so he's
[24:01] now in the stead
[24:02] of jesus and therefore brother branham
[24:04] said that's it when israel done that and
[24:07] chose a king
[24:08] a human king over god being their king
[24:10] he put israel away
[24:11] when the church came and they they chose
[24:14] a human man to be a viker in the stead
[24:16] of christ
[24:17] which was the position the holy ghost
[24:19] was sent for
[24:20] and they made that a mortal man and put
[24:22] him on a throne and put a crown on his
[24:24] head and god said that's
[24:25] it you're you're married to that
[24:28] system and therefore you're an
[24:30] adulterous woman and i put you away in
[24:32] divorce
[24:33] so we find out but i don't want to get
[24:35] too far ahead of myself
[24:36] thyatira means lacks loose and lazy
[24:39] sardis means escaped ones
[24:41] philadelphia's brotherly love laodicea
[24:43] is people's rights boy do we know that
[24:45] all too well
[24:47] so we realize then that they're aimed at
[24:50] but they're relaxed in their goal
[24:52] and their and then and now things are
[24:54] starting to creep into the church
[24:57] things are starting to come into
[24:59] people's lives
[25:01] that water down and dilute
[25:04] what it means to be a real christian now
[25:07] you can see where 2 000 years of that
[25:11] has gotten us to
[25:12] so that today you drive by the
[25:16] the churches that are that were supposed
[25:18] to be like the
[25:19] upper room church amen and they're a
[25:22] million miles
[25:23] from the upper room experience not only
[25:25] do they not even have the same lifestyle
[25:27] they don't have the same power they
[25:28] don't have the same anointing they don't
[25:30] have the moving of the holy spirit
[25:32] and and and that's where it was going to
[25:34] end up once they
[25:36] ever started moving the goal post don't
[25:38] do that friends
[25:40] don't accept don't accept a watered-down
[25:43] version
[25:44] of of the life that this message was
[25:47] sent to turn you into see because
[25:51] you know i i've got i don't want to get
[25:53] into my sermon today but
[25:55] but one of the things that we're going
[25:56] to find in the main service
[25:58] is is god is we're becoming something
[26:03] excuse me and jesus would be back and
[26:06] the millennium would be on well
[26:08] you know by the time you reach smyrna
[26:10] hundreds of years have passed and really
[26:12] nothing has happened like that in fact
[26:14] is they don't realize it's going to be
[26:16] many more years before that millennium
[26:19] sets in and so
[26:20] they're beginning to to have a little
[26:22] bit of bitterness over their
[26:24] circumstances and you know i want you to
[26:27] remember
[26:28] that god is here the holy spirit is
[26:31] given to us
[26:32] to guide us to bring us to where god
[26:35] has desired us to be and so you know the
[26:39] we find that that their brother branham
[26:41] showed us here in these early in this
[26:42] early age how that there's
[26:44] there's two churches and one is walking
[26:47] in darkness and one is walking in light
[26:49] and the separator is that
[26:52] the false church which ironically
[26:54] claimed to be the real one
[26:56] the false church began to move toward
[27:00] an intellectual birth an intellectual
[27:03] confession
[27:04] an intellectual christianity but god
[27:08] while god starts in the mind brother
[27:10] branham brought this to us
[27:12] the word comes to your mind because
[27:14] there's where a battle has got to take
[27:15] place because the human mind is enmity
[27:17] against god
[27:18] but when the holy spirit in his grace
[27:20] and mercy
[27:21] begins to reveal the word to your mind
[27:25] then faith rises and it drops down 18
[27:29] inches catches your heart
[27:30] and into your soul it becomes a soul
[27:32] birth not a mental
[27:34] birth see and so that was one of the
[27:37] factors that was going to separate so we
[27:40] have these two churches
[27:42] one goes for the mind one goes for the
[27:44] soul one is walking in theology
[27:47] and darkness and one is walking in
[27:49] revelation
[27:50] and light all right so
[27:53] and unto the angel of the church of
[27:57] all right now you know all
[27:59] manifestations of christ
[28:02] through the bible were christ
[28:05] by measure and we've we've labored a lot
[28:08] on this and i'm out of time now so i'm
[28:10] going to just pause right here
[28:12] with this statement but we realize that
[28:16] christ was being displayed all through
[28:19] the old testament even though it wasn't
[28:20] jesus of nazareth
[28:22] who was born of a woman amen but it
[28:25] but when jesus of nazareth was born
[28:29] he was the same person as the one in the
[28:31] old testament
[28:32] he wasn't another person and so we
[28:35] realized that
[28:36] he was revealing himself by measure so
[28:38] moses
[28:39] was christ in a measure joseph was
[28:42] christ in a measure right on down until
[28:44] it finally come to the fullness
[28:46] of the godhead bodily and that
[28:48] manifested
[28:49] in jesus christ now the book of revel
[28:52] the book of revelation
[28:54] starts out by saying the revelation
[28:58] of jesus christ which god gave unto him
[29:00] and so
[29:01] god was showing what the word
[29:04] is here to do in every age that the word
[29:08] this is why the revelation comes to
[29:10] continue the unfolding
[29:13] revelation of jesus christ so each age
[29:16] starts out as in revelation 2 1
[29:18] unto the angel of the church every age
[29:21] opens with christ identifying
[29:23] in some manner that he identified him
[29:26] like that in every in every age so john
[29:29] is told to write to these churches
[29:31] he addresses it to the angel he not to
[29:34] the entire body
[29:35] but to the angel and he he sends that
[29:38] messenger to the church and the
[29:40] messenger brings
[29:41] his message all right i gotta close now
[29:44] he brings his message so he's a star
[29:47] in the right hand of god and he's the
[29:50] one
[29:51] who has the word for this age and that's
[29:53] why brother branham would say
[29:54] paul was the pastor of not just the
[29:58] ephesian church which in history he was
[30:00] for a short time
[30:01] but paul was the pastor to the whole age
[30:05] and therefore irenaeus was the pastor to
[30:08] the whole age all the way down until we
[30:09] come
[30:10] to the day and hour that we live in and
[30:12] god sent us a pastor
[30:14] amen and who who would have a ministry
[30:17] over over the five-fold ministry
[30:21] and and and that and that and that
[30:23] five-fold ministry
[30:24] has a solemn duty to take the message
[30:28] of the messenger and break it down as
[30:30] the messenger told them to do
[30:32] and feed it to the people he said of his
[30:35] own ministry
[30:36] i only have time to hit the highlights
[30:38] you men of god take it study it break it
[30:41] down and feed it to the people
[30:43] so i i trust that you're being well fed
[30:46] bethel tabernacle
[30:47] amen god bless you let's stand back to
[30:49] our feet i'm completely out of time
[30:51] let's pray father
[30:53] we thank you for your word this morning
[30:55] we ask that it be a living word to the
[30:57] people lord may it take root in our

[31:05] humanity may we see the power behind the
[31:08] history of our lives may we see the
[31:10] power
[31:10] behind our future may we see the power
[31:12] behind our day-to-day life lord
[31:14] and realize that we're becoming
[31:16] something because there's
[31:18] a power that has ordained it and an
[31:20] anointing that's driving it
[31:22] so master we commit ourselves into your
[31:24] hands in jesus name
