Spur you on Amen we're going to preach on the joy of the Lord tonight only not like you think praise the Lord amen hope it don't make it worse amen praise the Lord we're going to invite you to the book of Nehemiah this evening amen we're going to go to write to chapter eight and Hallelujah Ezra and Nehemiah are two of my favorite books you'll run into them right after the book of second chronicles you'll crash right into those Brothers wonderful wonderful men of God Ezra in fact penned he was the Scribe of Chronicles Samuel was the writer of first and second Kings it's commonly held that Ezra penned the Chronicles which is why sometimes you'll find like in the gospels the same story told from a different angle amen and it can sometimes even look like differences in the story but the Bible is filled with that you know it's written that way on purpose sometimes just to to trick scoffers amen praise the Lord and so you know we we I'm appreciative of the Lord tonight that he opens his word to his family aren't you glad for that you're happy to be a part of his family amen I'm glad to have you all out tonight it was uh pretty rainy in certain parts and especially back over uh toward Ridgeland I was talking to brother Tony and they were having a monsoon and I looked on the radar and my goodness the whole thing brother Luther how did you get out of that man and it was all red and orange and I said wow man you might be in it for a while amen so uh but I think the word brother Tony is he's even further on West than you isn't he Luther yeah so he said man brother Jason I can't even see 10 foot in front of me so I said you better be careful so um amen I want to be praying for some of those Saints out that way um and different ones tonight I went to get sister mom I didn't want her driving in this so amen happy to have her here with us tonight God bless you all Nehemiah chapter 8 amen we want to take a continuation from Sunday and the Lord willing and so I I I'm trusting that the Lord will give us everything that we have need of I enjoyed Sunday it was as I said gave me an opportunity to start a new series and my you know I I started on the time of the unsealing and you're going to see why tonight on Sunday we stopped here we made reference to Nehemiah chapter eight but we want to go back there this evening and catch it Nehemiah chapter 8 and we're going to begin at verse 8 we'll catch 8 9 and 10. let's um yeah chapter verse 8. so they read in the book in the law of God distinctly and gave the sense and caused them to understand the reading you remember Sunday we were right here showing you that this is a type of the fivefold ministry because Ezra had taken the people back you can see in zerubbabel and Ezra and Nehemiah and you you find you know that zerubbubble went back to you know get get a get a the temple worship to restore worship and then Ezra come in behind him to re-establish the law and re-establish the word and then Nehemiah comes in behind that and he's got to build a wall and it deals with the walls of our lives and I've preached on that before let me tell you something friends God didn't just send a prophet to entertain the world he didn't send a message as I've said to you so many times the message isn't didn't come to fill you with better theology than the UPC and so it it came to to turn you into something it came to produce a life and that is really uh testifying to brother Chris as we were coming to church tonight brother Chris St John and we were I was saying you know the the the whole theme and and this is going to be important for you to get I'm going to let you be seated in a minute um but the the whole theme I want you to get in this series is that we're going to encapsulate the age to show us what God has done and where we are but a lot of that is will be rudimentary to us but what I what I the real burden and I hope you will come with these kinds of glasses on to look at it this way my real burden is is what will it take at the right at the end to for the people of the end time who know their God to do great exploits what's it going to take brother Brandon we we can talk all we want to about the third poll and we can talk about the spoken word and brother Brandon said a lot about it we can talk about the seventh under mystery in the seventh seal and there's a lot said about it we're going to say a lot about it but remember that every time a prophet came to that he started with God in Simplicity and when he finished it where does he come to the end of the seventh seal and he starts admonishing the people to just be a real Christian be a humble servant of God serve the Lord be consecrated be dedicated Amen in why Christ speak as listening to it today brother Branham same thing where he's talking about the power of the spoken word and he comes to the end of that sermon and he's imploring his own Tabernacle this is a time for rededication this is a time for consecration God is not Santa Claus verse 9. and Nehemiah which is the tershatha which is means a governor Nehemiah which is the governor in Ezra the priest The Scribe and the Levites that taught the people said unto all the people this day is Holy unto the Lord your God more not nor weep for all the people wept when they heard the words of the law you know why they were weeping because they were so broken-hearted for the lives they had lived and were and were under achieving in the promises of God and when they read what God had said in his word and they hadn't heard it in so long and they realized that their lives were a million miles from what they were supposed to be it broke their hearts that's a good way that's a good Broken Heart amen then he said unto them verse 10 go your way eat the fat and drink the sweet and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared for this day is Holy unto the Lord neither be you sorry for the joy of the Lord is your strength let's pray father we thank you for your love and kindness to us Lord I'm just here Lord to carry on and put in another another fold of this thought Lord and another installment and we're only going to get so far tonight so father just help me now to have my thoughts crystallized according to your will I believe I have it and I'm committing it to you in Jesus name amen God bless you can be seated several days ago and just the Lord leads you in such amazing ways sometimes it even catches You by surprise and I was I've been studying this the I've had the notes creating working uh probably put my first installment of notes on this sermon probably several weeks ago and so it's just kind of been building and building I was finishing up other things waiting for the unction of the Lord and so we're coming now tonight to a part two uh uh in this series uh the time of the unsealing and the again the theme of the unsealing what was the unsealing The Mighty God unveiled in our day but that that was not as I as I was just saying that remember God didn't didn't bring the word to entertain us and we don't have all of these great and wonderful promises about the spoken word so that you can go out here and just create whatever you want to uh the whole premise is the life of Jesus because Jesus had that kind of power Jesus walked up to a tree and when he couldn't find what he wanted he said no man eat from thee forever and nothing happened at that moment a lot of times you say oh the power of the spoken word it's going to come right away we're going to say a lot about that it it's not as it's not as straightforward as you might think it is God remember this God is training us for a world to come you're in training even we're going to talk a little bit about tonight about overcoming adversity and trials and things that we go through and and how the joy of the Lord what's the real essence of the joy of the Lord because here it is in the days of Nehemiah right here at the end time because this time of the Feast of trumpets that's the millennium that's body change Feast of Tabernacles you understand Feast of Tabernacles refers to the body changes it's when we're headed home to a millennium how many want that and and so this is the time when you've had a zerubble come you've had a Ezra in tight come you've got a Nehemiah now who's hearing and nehemiah's not even a preacher so now you ought to really set up and pay attention because I'm not talking about Ezra I'm talking about Nehemiah he was just a governor this is you this is your everyday life because Nehemiah was coming back to re-establish people in their life that it wasn't just going to be oh Ezra gave you the word now you've got a lot of theology old ceruval will come back and they laid the foundation and you're going to have a new you're going to have a new uh you're going to get a new church but when Nehemiah came the walls were crumbling and the gates were burned and nobody cared and the the the preachers were out in the fields like farmers and nobody was caring about about what it meant to live the word of God and we have come down in this last day dear friends we have come down and we say this is the end time this is the time of the spoken word and oh my it's a rejoicing time and truly it is a rejoicing time but the key to the rejoicing and I want to say this real clear your key to the joy of the Lord starts with a broken heart it's it's got to start there it's got to start in in a in a cleanness that comes from a repentive heart that cleans itself of the world that that's when the joy of the Lord because remember it's the joy of the Lord so it's supernatural and and so I I was I in my even in my morning study all this week in in days past I kept coming across across various nuggets and in the family altar with brother branaman uh streams and different places that I was reading I I read this one scripture uh in streams because here here's something that we talk about a lot and it's a scripture and and this is more of a paraphrase than the than the King James version but I think this is maybe New King James Version but you've heard it you've read it you've saw probably a sign laughter doeth good like a medicine and that's wonderful happiness and you know contentment is is very valuable to learn but you have to learn to be content because real contentment doesn't doesn't rely on stuff see so that that's just anybody say oh I'm content well if you've got a couple of mill in the bank and you got and you got perfect health and everybody likes you I guess you are content but real contentment is achieved and it's arrived at it takes uh it takes some overcoming it takes some victory it takes some adversity laughter doeth good like a medicine but the Bible tells us in Ecclesiastes 7 3 sorrow is better than laughter now imagine that yeah I come out here today and go hey laughter laughter with good luck of medicine we'd all go oh yeah oh oh it's going to be a wonderful sermon tonight and then I turn around and say yeah but sorrow is better than laughter Ecclesiastes 7 3 sorrow is better than laughter catch it now here's why it's not just going to make a statement and leave you hanging it's going to tell you why for by the sadness of the countenance The Heart Is Made better so you know we find that that sorrow is better for heart disease than laughter according to the Bible now remember that when brother Branham talks about you know by speaking about biology and speaking quoting science of his day and it's still True to this day and he starts talking about he says you know they say the number one killer is heart disease and brother Branham says I don't want to tell the doctor his business he said but I disagree with that he said the greatest problem is sin disease Hearts full of sin so while laughter could do good like a medicine sorrow is better than laughter for the for a heart that is diseased with sin fact is the greatest heart disease as brother Brandon would say is sin disease you know people always I shouldn't say always but more often I find it too often let me say it that way over the years pastoring and ministering around the world I find so many times that people will you know take off and run down the road of sin young people they get raised in a Christian home and they're protected and kept in the church and the preachers praying for them and they're just bound and determined to go to go wild and it seemed like no matter what you do sometimes you can't stop it and you struggle and fight with it and I've seen them go down the road of sin and then you know if they're a child of God it's not very long before their life capsizes I mean it can relate to that and it's one thing you know if you come contrite heart amazing friends I want to say to you today it is astonishing the amount of sin God will forgive in a moment if you come to him with a contrite heart you can reverse years oh I could almost cry you can reverse years Decades of the most heinous ungodliness in a moment with the right kind of heart and approach to God with a broken spirit and raised hands and tears streaming and say look God forgive me and in a moment he just wipes it away as if you never did it at all and you're instantly a son or daughter restored sometimes we have the scars of sin left by left over and the Lord even helps us with those but you know the the the when we find that too often times two more times than I'm comfortable with I find people running down the road of sin their life capsizes and they they get all depressed and they get all discouraged and they come around the family of God and they just want God to make them happy foreign make me happy again but it but it's true sorrow over your sin is the medicine you need not happiness it's the greatest real true brokenheartedness and repentance is the greatest medicine you can receive from God because you can't get there on your own it's God rich in Mercy drawing your heart breaking your heart driving you to an altar you're not just down there some people are they're just they just want out of their jam and there's as math as brother Matthew Watkins preach preached some time ago people can get very sorry for the result of what sin got him into they're very regretful over it but they're not but that's a far cry from being sorry over the sin itself see so you know when sorrow comes under the power of God's grace then it that's really where God can move in your life you know I I read this on one of my devotional one of the mornings says God never uses anybody to a large degrees referencing Genesis 29 I'm sorry Genesis 49 22 God never uses anybody to a large degree until after he breaks that one all to pieces brother Branham talks about that he says the only way to get the fragrance out of the Rose is to crush it and it talks about how that how that Joseph you know he he was he was it was said of Joseph that he is a fruitful bowel and he lives by a well he's like a he's like a tree planted by the a great whale whose branches just flourish and just run right over the wall you can't even contain him he's so flourishing but let me tell you something Joseph had more trouble and adversity and sorrow that he had to go through than all of his brothers combine he had more sorrow than all the sons of Jacob in it but yet that path LED joke LED Joseph to bring to be the giver of bread to a starving Nation think about that now friends see it takes its it was said I I wrote this quote down it said it takes sorrow to widen the soul and because this was so on my heart I thought my that is so so poignant and so true you know because what you know and you you know you could you you might could say here tonight oh brother Jason what happened to the joy of the Lord can can you can you can you get back to the joy of the Lord you know I'm here to tell you that what I'm preaching tonight is much more effective to widen your soul and it really is the pathway to the joy of the Lord because as I said to you already you need to realize that the joy of the Lord is a reward for faithfulness it's a reward for diligence see and so it's it's remember it's the joy of the Lord as I've already said in my opening statement you could tell I was ready to preach this it's a supernatural force in fact is it's so Supernatural that it doesn't even require a state of happiness or blessing at all at all it doesn't require a state of happiness it doesn't re the joy of the Lord doesn't require blessing at all it doesn't it doesn't require good news the joy realize that the joy of the Lord it literally maintains its faithfulness even in the midst of the deepest trials how many have experienced that kind of joy of the Lord it maintains its Effectiveness its efficacy its faithfulness even in the midst of deep trials even in sometimes seemingly impossible tribulations that threatened to consume you how many have been there if you've been alive on the earth any time at all job said you're only a few days anyway and you're full of trouble and you don't have to be very old to run into a lot of trouble you know but but remember that it is the joy of the Lord that comes from a Victorious Life that outlasts and he thinks Satan can throw at you oh my what's that what's that line sister M that how long Outlast this what this Darkness yeah because I am I long Outlast this Darkness because the Lord is fighting on my side or something like that yeah cause you're with me in this fight whoa oh my every time I I get to feeling too bombarded by the enemy I'll get online and pull up Sister Emily's song and I'll just sit there in my dark living room early in the morning and I'll as she comes to that line I'll long Outlast this Darkness man whoa I'm like hear me devil I'm gonna long Outlast this Darkness you're not gonna get me I'm gonna keep fighting and when I'm done I'll fight some more Hallelujah I'm determined to be an overcomer I will long Outlast this Darkness this Dark World this dark laodicea Hallelujah I'm not minimizing friends I'm not here to minimize your hard trials but get it that fiery trials are the tools God uses to make you a fruitful bow as Joseph for a fruitful field I mean it's the very sharp and hard plow that the farmer uses to make a fruitful field and and we know that Jesus said I my my father is I I'm the vine you're the branches my father is the farmer the husbandman the gardener and and and you know it the these are things that happen in our lives and they come our way and sometimes you know we don't understand why the Lord can allow certain things but you just remember that that that that it is these fiery trials that God uses can I say it this way and I hope it'll make you I hope you don't think I'm minimizing your trials it's it's those trials that God used to fill you with abundance I don't mean zeros in your bank account I'm talking about the joy of the Lord I when I in fact is when I I didn't realize it this evening when I opened my Bible to to find my place where for my text and my family got me this Spurgeon Bible I love it my favorite Bible ever had uh for Christmas or a birthday I don't remember and he literally I couldn't believe it he literally starts talking about the joy of the Lord and he goes right into repentance when I said you've got to be kidding and he says this he says as certain Fabrics need to be dampened before they will take the glowing colors with which they are to be adorned so our Spirits need the grace of repentance before we can receive the radiant coloring of delight and it's thought how profound that was he starts talking about you know it's if there's ever seen a you know a clearer shining than that which follows a shower the flowers are glistening he said raindrops the Sun comes out and raindrops turn into would look like gemstones but what what took that the showers and and he starts talking he makes the statement at the end I just thought he said the steps by which we Ascend to the Palace of delight are usually moist with tears I just thought there was such strength in that because listen friends I'm not here tonight to to go into a series where you know it it we've we've had a lot of rejoicing and shouting over the word of God but I've had such a burden on my heart because I can I go back and I can see every type like here in Nehemiah and I realize it's coming to the time of the Feast of Tabernacles and he's saying you know yet the people are Weeping and they're Brokenhearted and and they and it ought to be it rightly so because that meant that zerubbabel hadn't ran in vain and Ezra hadn't preached in vain and Nehemiah hadn't governed in vain I'm here to tell you your life's not in vain it's counting for something there's a mighty God with a book of remembrance and and he he has a promise that there will be a people brother Branham you know I was I was listening the other day to um as I was with Moses one of my favorite sermons that's the sermon if you ever hear me down here sometimes I don't always say it when I feel inspired I felt an evil spirit trying to resist I just remind him what a prophet said that as a servant of God brother ministers as Servants of God according to Elijah we are commissioned and commanded to stand in the steps of Jesus Christ and to perform his works there's no option on it Brothers we have to keep our lives dedicated and sincere before God we have to stay prayed up and on fire we have to we have to constantly move ourselves in the direction of Victory and we do make mistakes and we do get down but but uh but I know the path to the joy of the Lord all I got to do is get down on my knees and begin to say Lord God help me I'm sorry forgive me and then a joy unspeakable it doesn't even matter if the circumstances change there's no bearing on the joy of the Lord I don't need happiness our blessing we're here to fight friends we're here to take the enemy's ground away from him I want you to absorb that tonight we're here not just to hold Satan at Bay I get that he that letteth will let till he be taken out of the way but as I've said to you many times before the Lord didn't save you at an altar you know and say okay your safety in heaven and I and I usually follow that up with you know we are hoping to board The Old Ship of Zion someday but the Lord never told me to go down to the docks and sit on my luggage I I need to be I need to be in the fight uh God is has raised up soldiers and I'm here to tell you something friends a lot of times you we have to go through adversity to get us there and it's too bad brother Branham said sometimes we need a faith and the level of faith we need is going to only have to be fueled by desperation and unfortunately we can't get ourselves desperate enough so God has to bring something in our lives that makes us desperate and then the desperations like a factory and it starts producing the faith and then you start going forward and this is God's way why does it surprise us no wonder Peter said don't think it's strange when fiery Trials come they're they're to grow you they're to widen your heart widen your soul widen your mind foreign it's much more effective way of widening your soul Abraham overcame a lot of adversity and Abraham you know it's it's amazing sometimes we forget what a uh what an amazing Warrior Abraham was amen we just think of him as a sheep herder a simple humble man who probably never you know raised his voice who just walked on humble he was a you know his great man of faith and you know he just he just lived this kind of a stale life of just wandering around the desert and God talking to him Abraham lived real life Abraham had to settle domestic problems in his home had to settle domestic problems between him and his wife he had to settle domestic problems between him and his Kinfolk he had to understand how to prosper and he had to understand he understood how to get in trouble and he he had to learn how to be honest and confess his sin and repent and let God restore him he kept having to learn that one but you know when you when you when you read in the in Genesis where let's let's look at Genesis 14 Ethan I'm sorry to jump you I I didn't warn you but um give me Genesis 14 if you can get that up I want to just read um I'm going to say start around verse 10 maybe I'm just guessing ah go to 11. okay so this is where you've got a bunch of Kings who teamed up and came into the valley and stormed the gates of Sodom and Gomorrah and you remember the story they took a bunch of people captive and took all their money and all their treasure and took lot his nephew and his wife and his children and his in-laws his daughter-in-laws and son-in-laws and daughters and son-in-laws I meant to say and and and watch this now and they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their evictions and went their way verse 12. and they took lot Abram's brother's son who dwelt in Sodom and his goods and departed verse 13. and there came one that had escaped and told Abram the Hebrew for he dwelt in the plane of memory the Amorite brother of s of escal and brother of Anna and these were Confederate with Abram verse 14. and when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house 318 and pursued them unto Dan and he divided himself look at this this is a strategist I mean this guy is amazing and he divided himself against them he and his servants by night do you notice that the Bible said they were not just servants these were trained servants all he did was arm them they were already trained all right and and his servants by night and he smote them and pursued them unto hobot which is on the left hand of Damascus and he brought back how much all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people that's enough Ethan thank you and you know when you think about it I mean Abraham is a brilliant man I mean just just just think about this for a minute Abraham was brilliant and just in the fact that that he had a grasp on on the the ancient charity of knowledge that's where his whole family had come from from the chaudians and so he his his Heritage you know he has a a at least a grasp on Ancient charity charity and knowledge and he was he was Abram was no pushover certainly not somebody to be trifled with he's a direct descendant of sham Abraham because remember that that Abram was only ten Generations removed from a complete Global Extinction event see and and of course that event Abram knew was brought on by sin see and so so finding himself then you know in a in a fallen World which is where we find ourselves in a fallen World among Fallen men uh you know he's he's no naive fool and the Bible doesn't call for us to just be naive idiots at the devil's tactics and to say oh I'm just a humble Christian and I'll just let God fight all my battles let me tell you something God's gonna fight your battles but he's got he's putting a sword in your hand say I don't I don't have any power you understand that I can't save one of you I don't I can't give any of your children the Holy Ghost I don't have any power to do that but what I do have is a weapon and this weapon in the right hand has all kinds of Power and so I come with the sword of the spirit the word of God and we come with faith believing and we're we're on the attack I'm here tonight to attack the devil I'm here to attack him in your lives and I'm our children's life and our family's lives see and so what whatever is happening whether it's sin in our lives or we got our own self in it I mean even things that we might be culpable in I'm here to tell you the joy of the Lord is your strength the joy of the Lord is your strength if you want to be a warrior you're going to need strength and there's no greater strength than the supernatural joy of the Lord and there's no better way to get that than repented in your heart and crying out to God and being willing to face adversity and keep on going it's incredible because I mean Genesis 14. shows that Abraham he maintained a fighting battalion of more than 300 men that's no joke I mean they they when you when you're in the field in Battalion strength you remember those days brother Kenny but Joe you remember those days when you're in the field and brother Charles you're you're not that platoon strength this isn't company strength you got a whole battalion of of trained men and you're you're in the field of battle and Abram literally because he lived in a fallen world and he lived among Fallen men he literally has a he's maintaining a fighting Battalion of 300 Warrior servants moreover as you read it with me you read it with me I mean in these verses you know I mean he demonstrates that he's a a master tactician so I just thought he was a simple sheep herder no you'd be wrong oh I just thought he walked around and stared at his feet all day no you'd be wrong Abra Abram is is a is a master strategist who who knowing I mean he think about it he he knows how to track and pursue he knew how to strike at night for the element of surprise I mean he he he literally knew how to track him how to pursue them how to sneak up on him in the darkness for surprise and divided his Force for a perfectly executed pincer movement this man is brilliant see and so he's he the and the entire the entire the Bible uses the word slaughtered you know what that means means they that the enemy died to the last man he literally the enemy force was slaughtered and Abram returns back with his Battalion and there's no casualty report not one servant dies not one of the captives gets killed not one of their goods is lost he returns people husbands wives children's Goods garments kills all the enemies Slaughters until the last man and returns with his entire Battalion 318 men still intact oh my friends you realize what God is capable of doing in your life you're not just some Backwoods backwash you know you don't know nothing no you're the you're the cream of the crop you're the apple of his eye you're the whole purpose of calvary oh my Genesis shows him to be a not just a simple sheep herder Genesis shows him to be a brilliant Warchief and a successful herdsman if I might say see so there's there's nothing wrong with being trained for war even though you're a man of faith amen say it again there's nothing wrong with being trained for war even if you're a man of faith so I'm just a man of Faith good you're going to need it now get get some Warrior training because God did God didn't bring all that on you just to decorate you and March you in a parade I mean listen friends this is the very this is what the ministry of Melchizedek showed up look who met him after the slaughter of the kings in the in the Kingsdale when he comes back and Melchizedek comes and serves in communion what was Melchizedek doing Melchizedek was showing the kind of life you have Abraham that's the kind of life I recognize that's the kind of life I validate that I'm going to serve you Kawaii and bread because I'm validating your life you stayed out of Sodom you capture yours you stayed before me you didn't go down to the Sodom you you had enough foresight to be a strong man of Faith you had enough foresight to be able to destroy the enemy and protect your home and save your family I wonder if we got enough men dads and mothers who have enough spiritual strength to to go after him and destroy an enemy in a complete Slaughter Hallelujah this is exactly why and I'm gonna quit early tonight because we want to have prayer and we want to have some testimonies I'm trying to gauge it I'm trying to set the right example for Wednesday nights when Joshua I want to make this point for our for our walk away when Joshua took the children of Israel Over to take the land uh you know the very first Divine being he met was a soldier God didn't call him up to the mountain like he did Moses he didn't meet him in a burning bush see God didn't God didn't meet you on the Ohio River he didn't come down like a star out of the heavens God didn't walk up like and you were in a cave and he stepped into a light you you that that that's not that's how God met our Moses but I'm here to tell you something friends we've crossed over under Joshua and it's time for war and it's time to fight and you have to ask yourself why am I a Believer I hope that you're asking yourself that question tonight why am I a Believer why do I come to this church why do I believe what I believe why do I believe God sent a prophet I can promise you it's not for entertainment it's not for recreation it's not for theology it's to make champion guns of the kingdom of God it's to take from the Devil this is did you realize that that's what that's what the meaning of being more than a conqueror is you're more than a conqueror because when you kill the enemy you take all of his spoils you get all of his ammo all of his weapons all of his tanks all of his guns all of his bullets all of his rations all of his water all of his fuel all of his aircraft airplanes now you're not you're not just a conqueror you're more than a conqueror you're not here just to to put the devil away you got to go forward you need to take some things back that he has taken from you and you're more than able because God has given us the joy of the Lord is our strength because we have arrived at the end time we've arrived we're we're here Nehemiah you Gallant man that's reservable sand is irrumable not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord we have arrived at the Feast of Tabernacles we have arrived at body change time we have arrived at Millennium time the joy of the Lord is here it calls for our contrite heart it calls for a repentance it calls for dedication it calls for Consecration and sincerity before God I want that more than anything let's stand to our feet friends I I'm just so taken with it I'm so taken with what it when I realize that for years we have talked about the power of the spoken word and there are things that are yet to become greater I believe that according to Prophecy in the Bible according to things brother Brandon said to us very clearly on Tate God is going to prove I don't know all the details and he didn't know all the details and he didn't claim he did and even some of the statements he makes are somewhat ambiguous but I know collectively there's enough of them for me to know that friends God has something great and I believe it's just laying right in front of us say why do you think that because we've arrived at the not the end time we've arrived at the end of the end times say I've heard preachers been saying it's the end for decades that's right it has been that's not that wasn't wrong but now I'm here to tell you we've not we're not at the end time the end time started with the opening of Seven Seals that was the that was the beginning of the end and you have arrived now at the end of the end you haven't run in vain says Gene you haven't run in vain well Charles you haven't run in vain you haven't run in vain friends I haven't run in vain I know that God is Not only gonna keep his word I'm not looking for some way off out there if you're always chasing something wealth out there I'm telling you it's here it's right now you have you have arrived at the time of the unsealing and God is ready to do amazing things and a lot of times some of the most amazing things happen in silence one of the most amazing things do you know one of the most amazing things that happened in your life today the sun rose if it didn't rise the Earth would be in darkness and cold and would be a dead Planet devoid of all life in a very short time if the sun suddenly went away life could not be sustained on the Earth so I'm here to tell you that the greatest event that happened to you today and for you was the sun rose I'll ask you a question anybody hear it did anybody feel ripples go through the air no it just Rose and all of a sudden there it was and it went all day long warming the Earth using its its energy on a big ball of flame and heating from that many miles away and gave you warmth and gave you light and then the light is life nobody heard it you didn't even feel it unless you walked out and felt Warm Rays so we're not we're not here to chase some Sensational I don't know way out there somewhere over a rainbow no I'm here to tell you you're at the time of the unsealing it's now you're here it's arrived and I don't know I mean I think that God is already doing more in us than we're even aware of I think there's more Supernatural operating in you that you're a believer in this impossible age I I you know let's give the Lord some credit he's keeping me and from glory to glory he's changing me I'm so glad I can say that I'm so glad I've been raised in this I've been in it my whole life but I can still say today even after all these years he's still changing me he's still growing me he's still moving me oh one of these mornings we're going to move right into another dimension friend oh Hallelujah let's pray father we thank you thank you for our time together now Lord and thank you for your word I commit it now to you master I feel completely satisfied that I was able to get everything that you wanted said and so now Lord we turn our hearts and Minds to prayer we have requests to pray over in sick people and needs and various things and Lord Oh how we need you in this day how we need you in this hour there's never been an hour where we needed you more than now so I pray father that you be our helper tonight as we look to you now in Jesus name gather around his brother Matt sings for us amen I'm Gonna Keep resting on [Music] I'm Gonna Keep [Music] [Applause] of my Lord oh oh I'm gonna keep her receipt no oh [Music] yes sir [Music] sing it now for Satan tries to stop me think about it and turn me aside proves [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm gonna keep pressing on Hallelujah [Music] amen praise the Lord I have just one special unspoken prayer request from sister Sharon short so we'll take that to the Lord I didn't have any other prayer requests that come in but I know a lot of times sometimes when you arrive to church you don't think you have a need until the preacher gets done and then you feel how many Phil you have a need tonight something in your heart you need to pray and ask the Lord's help you know I was talking brother Chris and I we were coming to church and and we were just brother Chris made a comment about you know just the conversations of late that he's had with the Lord and I said well you know Chris that's that's exactly that that's exactly like the Bible that's what God actually wants that that I I did a study some time ago not too awful long ago right in the latter part of last year and I I got enamored with with these prophets and pre and Priests and kings and apostles and I mean even in the book of Acts and different places where these long elaborate detailed I'm talking about almost like a like uh this prayer where you know this man implored God and and built his case and gave him reasoning and Lord we've got this problem and here's what your word says and we need this kind of help and if you don't do it this is going to happen over here and we're trusting you right here and Lord you've got to come on the scene and and and remember your word and remember your people and for thy great love and all and I mean just these elaborate prayers I was like wow I mean it it occurred to me I thought let me go back and look at some of brother Brandon's prayer same thing but sometimes brother Brown be praying for somebody and just get down you remember the prayer when the man got his car stoled and brother Branham didn't just lay hands on him and say Lord go find his car he got down said now Lord this poor brother he drives all these many miles and he comes he got he's poor Lord but you know he's a Christian you know he loves you now Lord some evil person has stole his car you think God didn't know all that you think these prophets and kings and brother Branham and Paul and different ones in the Bible do you think they're telling God something he doesn't know the Bible says who's been his counselor but yet God I said it's not about that it's that God loves the interaction that's why brother Branham said ask big things don't be afraid to ask pray believe he said ask big things God wants you to you got a prophet his permission God wants you to the Bible says ask big that your joy may be full ask abundance gently I mean look I I can I can I can give you a double testimony you know I had small children had small grandchildren and even to this day whether they're grown and strapping bigger than me there was no there was you know there was times when when I would come to you know and I'd want to do something for my sons and I'd get a big joy out of seeing their smile or a grand a grandchild I'd go buy them something you know and just to hear them squeal and and and I got a great joy out of that but that's nothing every parent especially grandparents are special know this to be true there's nothing like having that child or that grandchild come and say well my son say Dad Dad I've got a problem Bob you help me I got to have that can you you know and or or a grandchild come and say papa I got a situation and if you could help me and over here and then if you just and then we can and oh my goodness that then I will stop having an earth Wild Horses couldn't keep me away from it see because the thrill I get because they engaged me and asked me and then I get to do it and and God is a Heavenly Father remember that he's a heavenly father he he wants you what's on your heart son what's on your heart daughter pull up a chair let's talk about it my brother Branham said he wants that oh friends don't don't just treat him like a you know like a vending machine he's a real being talk to him like a friend talk to him like a brother you got a need tonight amen got a need let's go to him Lord we love you tonight we thank you for your word we thank you for the Liberty that we have in the presence of God I thank you for these people tonight Lord Who come out on this rainy night to hear the word of God I know there's others Lord as streaming and and couldn't make it tonight we understand that father I believe the word went out tonight and and I believe it was an arrow of Deliverance that found its Mark oh God I know the enemy's afraid tonight for what the people heard because they might put it into action Lord I pray that every one of them will put it into action every one of them will go forward with new faith and new confidence Lord these needs we have one unspoken prayer request and we have hands that went up across Their audience and we need these things of the Lord you see

you'll meet it now according to your riches in glory we commit it to you in Jesus name amen praise the Lord anybody got a testimony tonight before we go amen sister Melissa I gotta find some fiend has stolen my mic oh I think sir hey you come unplugged there buddy all right pass that sister Melissa last week we prayed for a 14 year old young man who had been in an accident and the doctors as of I guess Friday and Saturday the doctors told the family that there was no hope and that they needed to start thinking about letting him go and and that kind of thing well they were in the um the family was gathered around the hospital room and they were just trying to process that information and the young man woke up he just just woke up and he reached for his mom and was trying to get to her and so of course the medical staff did put him back into a coma because he's got so many broken bones I guess or her injuries of whatever kind that they thought it was best to keep him medically in a coma so that he wouldn't thrash around and hurt himself more but they realized that he you know he's there yes and so the family asked that we continue to pray and I just wanted to give that test hey man praise the Lord anybody else over in this side got testimony before we go amen anybody over here going once going twice amen praise the Lord you're going to get more in the habit of this you're going
