TRANSCRIPT
========================================
thank you morning everyone God bless you let's stand and pray gracious father we come before you Lord and we ask that your presence would be amongst us Lord leading us and guiding us into all truth Lord I pray that you take your word and make it alive and real in our hearts Lord help us to get ourselves out of the way Lord that you would move and be glorified amongst us we ask in Jesus name amen and we're going to read from Isaiah chapter 4 continuing on the subject seven women take hold of one man and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and calmly for them that are escaped of Israel may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word he could be seated so if you're if you haven't been here for the previous Sunday schools I guess go back and listen because I'm not going to spend a ton of time explaining what I have the last four different times but just to give a picture we're looking at a prophecy of scripture and we're looking at uh as brother Branham says many scriptures are dual prophecies and so if you look in the natural this of course is uh in many ways speaking of the hour when that Jesus prophesied in 70 A.D where not one stone would be left upon another of the temple and the men would be killed and and there would be women left and women would then need to find a husband and this is what they said we'll we'll deal with our own Provisions only just give us your name so we can be called by that but then you fast forward to the spiritual prophecy and look at it in the end times and you'll see that within this is the seed of feminism but not only that bigger picture than that is in that next portion of the the the the verse in verse two the branch of the Lord will be beautiful and glorious speaking of the bride of Christ who will be without spot or wrinkle or any such thing in the last days so looking at those two different two different things you have the the church world and then the true elected bride of of Christ on one side the church World saying we'll have our own Doctrine we'll have our own theology we'll have our own approach to the Bible only let us be called by the name of Christ to take away our reproach but the but then on the reverse side is God has sent his Vindicated word he's he's come on the scene he's he himself has come down with an open book ripped the seals off the book to make them known to us and then Vindicated that with Supernatural signs and wonders to show forth the very presence of almighty God in his bride and what and then what what this what is her response her response is to say just uh let's do our own thing and just let us be called by your name no this this the response of the Bride is amen thank you Lord and then from that the character of Christ is shaped and then from that you see God declares over her she's beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth is excellent from her so I'll just leave it at that there's there's many scriptures that everything that go into that but you can get that in Parts one two and three I believe so continuing on from last week again as I said this this might seem weird if you didn't listen to last week's Sunday school this leads directly into that so the feminization of the church we talked about the feminism feminization of culture we talked about the feminization process both in Civilization education and in science right so then we see that now we're going to see the impact on the spiritual side of things of what's happened because you see every denomination has gone into the gone into the place of where is the decline every denomination has made what was the start of it it was the start of first the opposite direction of the Reformation right when the Reformation started with Luther what what did it start with it didn't start with justification by faith it started with what is the absolute what is the final authority of the church the Bible the church is subject to the Bible the church has to be subject to the Bible not to its own traditions and its own internal Authority so what is the dot the downturn of every denomination is when it's it begins to say well uh I'm just going to put it this way they say well Jesus didn't say that Paul said it see what and what's what does that signify what does that signify is they don't ex no longer accept the inerrancy of scripture they believe that they can question and accept some things and reject some things what does it always start with women preachers the very first part spot of decline that takes place is saying women can also be preachers then again I'm not going to go in and prove that point we did in our last three services but that's the start and as soon as that happens liberalism comes in every denomination search the history look at it you'll find out that's absolutely right and so what do we have in today in our church world I should say not our local church necessarily but the church world is the church has been feminized and spirituality and worship has been feminized it's emotion-based it's touchy feely focused it's self-help center Jesus came to give me unconditional Emotional Love regardless of my sinfulness and the purpose of church is to make me feel better emotionally and it's not these are not the things that God that Christ came to do he came to bring Redemption he came to take the sins of mankind and Destroy them and destroy the works of the devil were literally in a war we're not here to have our emotions tickled into our have our feelings built up do those things come sure they come and they go but the word of God doesn't change the truth of God doesn't change the Warfare that we're facing doesn't change based on how we feel is still Warfare this is from David Murrow he says in today's Church the gospel is no longer about saving the world against impossible odds it's about it's about finding a happy relationship with a wonderful man which every woman wants to find that which I mean I guess today we don't even know if they're a woman or not as we've talked about um what is a woman the world doesn't have any clue what that is and so but anyways at any rate a woman wants to find a relationship with a wonderful man and that's a feminizing approach to the gospel is there there is there is fellowship with God and with the Lord Jesus Christ according to scripture it's it is a relationship but the focus is not that it's we were enemies and through the blood of the Cross were brought near and we have fellowship and we worship him it's not necessarily mostly focused on oh I have a relationship you see okay you're you're stumbling at that a little bit but there's a difference between focusing on mere relationship and fellowship it's two different things when you have fellowship with God and you're brought nearer by his blood there is a relationship but it's a that's not that's not it's not a happy relationship all the time is it it's not it's not like your human relationship with your husband or with your friend we use these terminologies but it's far beyond that it far exceeds any of those things if the main focus of the church is merely come and have a relationship with Jesus fantastic but what about the fact that your your enemies with God what if what about the fact that you need to be reconciled you can't be friends with Jesus unless you're reconciled unless you repent if there's no if if there's a gospel of just a relationship and emotions no repentance there is no relationship see this is what I this is the point I'm trying to trying to bring out here is the focus is emotional relationship the focus is not reconciling enemies the gospel is reconciling enemies so let's continue on from there true Womanhood is a beautiful reflection of the bride of Christ true manhood is a beautiful reflection of Christ see and and the the Bible has an order to this and this order has an impact on everything in your home your home should be a reflection of Christ and the church the church itself the local church should also be a reflection of of this the authority of Christ coming down right the authority of Christ the Bible says the head of every woman is the man the head of every man is Christ the head of Christ is God so there's a there's a directional Authority that's flowing down the same thing in a home and this in the same thing in a church so men and women we read this I think three times before but we'll do it again men and women are equal but they're not the same men and women are different at the cellular level every cell is marked as either male or female men have denser bones larger hands and greater muscle mass of course these things should be obvious but there's a great egalitarianism movement that goes on in our society and in the church world that tries to say there's no difference between men and women men and women can fulfill the same roles they can't because they're not made the same men tend to compartmentalize women tend to connect everything men are wired to lead women are wired to nurture or I would say influence Colossians 3 18 and 19 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the Lord husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them this is this this is speaking of the bitterness is if you look at that word it's speaking of ruling with rigor or like a dictatorship so husbands love your wives don't rule them like a dictator lead them with love wives submit so that's not a swear word our society think that that's a that's a bad word and women should not submit and that spirit will get will come over and get on Christian women that want to follow the word of God but Society pushes in a certain direction because media and everything else pushes against that and kicks against that and says this is a remnants from the old school patriarchy let's go back to the old school patriarchy but the Bible version of it from the Rapture brother Branham says I remember that night before I seen that I seen the preview of the Bride I stood there and seen a beautiful little lady just correctly dressed at things marching this way there was somebody standing by me in the vision and I seen they said the preview of the Bride I seen her go by they come on this side and went around I heard it coming up the church is coming up from this other side there come the Asian Church oh you talk about filth here come the European Church oh my and then I heard a rock and roll coming and it was Miss America the church and she didn't even have any clue on any clothes my she had papers like newspapers gray hold in front her dancing by rock and roll Miss America the church do you notice that she's not clothed in fine linen clean and white which is the righteousness of saints she's not closed in in the word what has she clothed in news current events politics that's what the modern American church has clothed herself with a connection with politics so then when them women pass by all doing all kinds of rock and things and short hair and painted faces and as they passed like that supposed to be virgins to Christ and when she passed like that I turned my head you know with this holding in front of me was disgraceful the back of them and then where there they was going like that and I turned my head to weeping like that then I heard something like Onward Christian Soldiers I looked and here come that Saint bunch of little girls just exactly the way they was all correctly dressed their hair hanging way down to their back smooth clean marching like this to the step of the Gospel she was the word they looked like one out of every nation I was looking as it as it has passed as they passed by and seen them pass by instead of going down amen they started going up Hallelujah so you see brother branham's vision he's typing the woman of today with both the bride so sisters you're a type of the Bride which is all of us and out in the world that's a type of the church you see the condition of the world it's reflected by the condition of the church it's been that way in every age and and what is it one one is filthy and one is clean it's a very different approach a very different Viewpoint that's taking place a different work completely different world view Titus 2 3 and 5. the aged women likewise that they be in Behavior has become with Holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of God be not blasphemed so this is Paul writing to Titus for Titus to give these instructions so these are the instructions that that ministers need to be giving to their Church and so what what is this what what what are we looking at this is just a you know this is a pretty good idea that you guys should should do we think it might work or do you think that maybe that he's giving instructions of this is the vision that God has for the family and for the home and for the church for aged women to to make to instruct the young people the young women so where in that does it say go get a career I'm just laying it out there where where is that to make it your vision I'm going to have a career and I'm going to pursue my own uh finances and life and everything is that God's vision is that the vision he's had I would that younger women get an education and get a career that's not what it says I'm not against education I'm not against getting an education I'm not against if you have to unless brother Branham said if you're what if your husband's sick and he can't can't work prop uh well then that's a whole different story but the point being is this is God's vision so if our vision is teaching our young ladies something different than this now understand there there's there's circumstances and situations but what I'm saying is this is the General Vision that Paul is teaching don't be offended by that don't be such a modern American that you're offended by the teaching of the word of God that you feel like gee boy he's going out on a limb I'm expositing to you the Bible if you don't like it you have to repent I'm not telling you weird and crazy things how could this preacher stand up there and say women shouldn't focus on an education and shouldn't okay you can get that but that should be that's a side vision of your life that's not the main direction that God is calling you to be if the word of God means anything to you First Timothy 5 14 I will therefore that the younger women marry bear children guide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully I'm offended I'm offended the the preacher is telling young women to get married and have children and lead the home that's the vision that's the direction that's Paul saying Timothy teach them this if they're going a different direction correct them oops sorry America sorry American Dream you're a false teaching we don't accept you and I I feel that there's a there's a great resentment to what I'm saying right now the question is do we take the word of God as our absolute or do we take culture and well that you don't understand our situation so do we have a culture outside of the word of God do we have a culture outside of the Bible well if we do then throw it in the trash can because we don't have this version of the Bible and that version of the Bible and this version of the Bible we have what Paul taught brother Branham taught what Paul taught I'm trying to point to you what brother Branham and what Paul taught if you don't like it then don't like it but we go by the word of God guide the house it's the word to manage the family Affairs to rule a household so under her husband a wife is to rule and manage the Affairs of the family that's God's Vision she's to be a homemaker we look at Homemaker and we think my goodness you know I'm so discouraged and I feel so terrible all these women have great careers and I'm just a I'm just a homemaker that makes me so angry that Devil he's a liar put them right under your foot and say that's a lie a woman that's a homemaker is the most highly exalted person on Earth that's the gr that's the greatest thing that our nation lost is a real Homemaker that stays at home raises their children feeds their family takes care of them don't think that missing a career is something that you're missing out on you are blessed and your family is blessed and your husband is blessed and your children are blessed why because you're following God's order many times many times you could look at and say oh we've suffered we've had difficulties in Trials because we don't have two incomes yeah you could say that but God is the great provider and you could say well I had many trials because I didn't go to I I uh I didn't go to work on Sundays and Wednesday nights you know I had you're obeying the word of God of course there's going to be trials and resistance and fights and the devil is going to come against you and it's going to be difficult in all of society as we said Satan has molded and shaped to society and a world where a woman at home is almost impossible but With God all things are possible if you put God first and Obey him it's up to him to lead you through and provide for you through every difficulty and trial that ensues because of that but there's so much that goes into this when a woman is at home versus at work when you're at work you're picking up the atmosphere of other people around you and you're picking up that atmosphere and you're bringing that home you say I'm strong I have I have the Holy Spirit okay yes that's true and so do I but I also worked worked full-time at some places where it was I was around Christians in some places where I was definitely not around Christians and the atmosphere was very different and the atmosphere I brought home was very different and you know that very well so a woman her role is to set that atmosphere at the home for the husband for the children the husband is to be a part of that but he's going out and coming back he should come into a place that Sanctified and the Holy Spirit is moving I know there's chaos especially when there's little kids but nevertheless nevertheless inside of that there's still the presence of the Lord surrounding all the chaos of family life that's a beautiful thing and setting that atmosphere if you're out in the workplace and coming home it's not you're not bringing the same atmosphere it's not the same thing and so the atmosphere Amy's going to hate me but when when she was working in the bank before we had children uh she was around all kinds of worldly people and the atmosphere was one thing when she was home with the children and not in that atmosphere anymore it was different it's just very different that's that's my personal testimony I believe that carries on though because there is an atmosphere and that atmosphere is critical and there's so I could go on and on about the importance of a mother in the home talk about the importance for the children the stability that it brings the strength that it brings mom is always there mom is a source of strength and and consistency there for children if Mom's out dad's out who's raising them Grandma and Grandpa okay that's good but it's still not the same it's still not exactly if you have a chance to be at home be at home you say it's impossible remember With God all things are possible obedience to him comes first choosing of a bride brother Branham says I know I'm not much of this modernistic taste of women working when I seen these women with these Uniforms on riding around in the city on motorcycles as police it's a disgrace to any City that will let a woman do that see see as many men that's without work it shows the modern thinking of our city it shows the degrading we don't have to have them women out there like that they ain't got no business out there like that amen that's the absolute truth that's not a position for a woman to be a police officer you all are looking at me like I'm crazy but I'm speaking the truth to you this is what this is what the prophets the prophet that thinks this if if you're a Bible believing Christian you should think it think it no matter what it's absolutely the truth when God gave a man a wife he gave him the best thing he could give him outside of salvation but when when one goes trying to take a man's place then she's about the worst thing that he could get a hold of now that's right now we see the spiritual application I know that's bad you think it's bad but it's the truth we don't care how bad it is we got to face up to the fact that's what the Bible teaches and he was to pass that way brother Branham says she got no business in a defense plant a woman's place is at home with her children and I had went sheet now if her husband is sick and she has to work that's different but Woman's Place is at home in the kitchen and when she leaves that she's out of her place exactly right can you say Amen or you don't you don't like this what what's going on okay it's old-fashioned but we need to go back to the old-fashioned Bible Way I'm just going to finish there let's stand and pray Heavenly Father we come before you now Lord and oh God we see the degradation of our society and even many Christian people wonder what what happened where did we go wrong it's so simple it's it's so obvious where we went on to anyone with spiritual understanding Lord and I though this world this culture these things around us have gone the wrong way we're not required as Christians to go the wrong way the Lord let us shape ourselves and shape what we teach our families and the direction that we give in our families Lord may it be shaped after the word of God and not after this civilization which is of Satan Lord we ask for your holy spirit to guide us Lord and teach us we ask that your Holy Spirit Lord would convict and correct our hearts Lord we commit ourselves and our ways to you we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you [Music]
