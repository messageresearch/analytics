of you you love him tonight amen God bless you certainly good to be here in the house of the Lord if you have your Bible let's go to the book of Galatians chapter 3 Galatians chapter 3 we just want to uh go straight to the scripture amen here tonight and just have something upon our heart we just sent a PowerPoint back to you if you want to have that just ready let's look at Galatians chapter 3 and we'll just be read three verses and then have you be seated amen got it just a lot on of our on our plate tonight and just trusting the Lord would say what he wants to say and I could just get myself out of the way and that everyone here tonight amen and those online listening could just ask the Lord Jesus to speak to them and say Lord would you come and speak to me say what you want to say and then I believe the Lord can do that I'd like to speak to you on anointed anointed by the Supernatural That's My Title tonight Galatians 3 o foolish Galatians who hath Bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you this only what I learn of you received notice the text here received ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of faith are you so foolish having begun in the spirit and you now made perfect by the flesh let's read that verse three one more time are you so foolish having begun in the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh second Kings chapter 2 quickly and will have you be seated I'm not sure I'll get to this text but I just wanted to make sure we read it so I wouldn't have to cover it once we're going if the Lord decides to lead us this way and it came to pass II kings 2 1 and it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elisha Elijah into Heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha from gilgall and Elisha said unto Elijah Elijah said unto Elisha Terry here I pray thee for the Lord hath sent me to Bethel and Elisha said unto him as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they went down to Bethel Lord we give you thanks for the reading of your word tonight believing Lord that you're in control of all things Lord I just now Lord fill your spirit Lord as the worship that we were singing Lord was created an atmosphere Lord where we invite you and you could take your Abode Lord and you could come and speak to us now Lord I pray that you would do that tonight Lord for every person that's here those Lord that are streaming tonight Lord maybe couldn't make it Lord I pray that you would just be close to us right now father Lord is the words that we want to speak tonight Lord we believe are given and the inspiration has been given by you so Lord I pray that you would just come and anoint your word father to the faith to the heart of the believer may they receive it by Supernatural Faith Lord I pray that you'd Grant it tonight in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated thank you amen for all the music if you have that my slides you could display that that'd be good anointed by the Supernatural and I I've got quite a few of these uh up here so I want to make sure that we get them make sure we have them up on display for everyone to be able to read them and I'm not going to be able to get to everything the lord has laid upon my heart but I just want to be sensitive to what he wants to speak here tonight brother Brandon says this in the message why Christ speak and this is this the Lord has placed us so strong upon my heart uh you just over the past few days since brother Diggs spoke on Sunday and I've just listened to it several times five or six maybe more times now and I just want to draw something from this man Moses as you hear brother Brandon we only just selected a few quotes but the prophet begins to talk about Moses how that he had received this anointing in his life he had received a commission and and he says here in the message why Christ speak he says may the Holy Spirit teach us today the things that we ought to know and may we then do we have that Brothers make sure the audience is selected I want to make sure we get this on the screen I'm just going to keep reading until they get it here May the Holy Spirit teach us today the things we ought to know may we then in return listen closely to every word and and he says he says uh to weigh it deeply and then may we those who are listening by the way of tape may they listen close and may we be able to catch what the holy spirit is trying to reveal to us so he's since be sensitive here be awake be aware be attentive may we not miss it may we catch what the holy spirit is trying to reveal to us for we realize if he should anoint us then the anointing is not in vain it's for a purpose now I'm preaching to you on anointed by the supernatural so we don't want to use this Pentecostal charismatic I would call it word that's a buzzword in charismatic movements of the anointing and you find almost every title of sermons and spin things that they give is the anointing the anointing the anointing and sometimes people don't even know what that means it's just a fuzzy feeling or something that feels good to say I'm anointed but really there's a there's a there's a biblical meaning and the prophet spoke a lot about what an anointing it what an what anointing means it's not just a fancy word or a funny feeling or a fuzzy feeling that you feel come over your body but in the Bible when a man was anointed it was an oil that God poured over and as the Bible speaks of of of of David when David is Anointed by the prophet Samuel and hell it flowed from David's head and it flowed down his beard and dropped down to his garments all the way down to his feet what he was it was a symbol that God was equipping or God was going to take his purpose and pour it into the life of a man and then that man would come under the anointing of God's purpose and do the job so an anointing was always for a specific purpose it wasn't just given uh to everybody not everybody had the anointing to be king and to uh as David did except David because David had received that anointing not everyone had the anointing that the uh that the Hebrew children had there was an anointing that came upon their life and it was to accomplish a specific purpose so brother Brandon would say May the Holy Spirit teach us may we be sensitive may we listen close may we be able to catch what the holy spirit is trying to reveal to us how good I just uh table searched this today and I thought it was just incredible if you table search the exact phrase don't miss it and you hear how many times brother Branham uh throughout whether it was a sermon or through a prayer line he would make this statement don't miss it make sure you don't miss it and and I was just going through all the way just always usually start from 65 and then move on back to see how many times did brother Brandon say this and it was brother random would have some important something to say or the angel of the Lord in a prayer line and he would say Oh Sister don't miss him oh brother don't miss it don't miss the the spirit of the Lord is trying to speak to you and that's a special thing when God tries to speak it's a special thing when the Lord is trying to give you something or trying to say something to you and I just I felt it so quickened upon my heart when I was there this afternoon in prayer and the Lord just was saying to say to the church here tonight don't miss it all right don't miss what the Lord is trying to do don't miss what God is trying to say to say is the brother random said I could just raise my hand and say Lord let me be attentive let me listen closely let me weigh it deeply Lord what you're trying to speak to me in my life because I believe the Lord is trying to say something this is a time a special time not just any other age not just any other day but there's a special time and a special people who has to receive an anointing and that anointing is something God's given them for a purpose listen to what he says here he says it's for a purpose that it might work to the good he says that might work to the good to the Lord and may our hearts and understanding be open Lord it begins to talk about Moses and he talks about the man Moses and how that God had put so much inside of him listen to what he says in the next slide and he knows how to do these things and how to deal with man he knows what's in man let me say this you may think you know what's inside of you but you really don't only God knows what he's really put inside of it because nothing of who you really are is anything that you've ever accomplished or done in life who you really are is who God said you were before you ever took a first action or a first breath or thought your first thought God knows what he put inside of you and so brother Branham says he knows what's in man he knows he knows him we don't we only know from the intellectual side we only know from the intellectual side whether it's academic or maybe you're just a smart person and you think that your brother Madam says there's a side of that Moses knew who he was by reading the word of God and that's what the prophet says he said he's seen how that God's family would have to sojourn and the land of Egypt for 400 years and brother Brandon says now intellectually he could see that he could see that there would there would that God's people would sojourn for 400 years and then there would come a deliverer and they would be freed yeah and brother Brandon says Moses even recognized this about his own Ministry about himself listen he says here and he says Moses was born in this world and a gifted boy the next slide and he was born to be a prophet a deliverer he was born with the equipment borned in him [Music] I want you to catch that he was born with the equipment born in him it was already there so how was Moses going to perform the miracle that God was requiring he didn't need to look somewhere else he didn't need to look down the road what he needed was already inside of him I hope you catch it tonight stop looking for your answer outside it's laying down inside of the seed God put inside of your life what has to happen is that seed that God has placed the equipment that God has placed inside of you has to be anointed he was born with it as every man comes into this world is born with this equipment next slide Moses born than he was afterwards he was brought the place where he was anointed the next slide to the place where he was anointed so there was a transition something took place in his life there was a time where intellectually he knew it yeah and what did it produce a dead Egyptian right right that's what that's what the Bible says what brother Brown tells us all of his intellectual of his mom and daddy teaching him that's why brother Brandon says to have dramatized it to the kids about joke about and he said I was trying to get them to understand they would sit Moses down every night they would read him the Scrolls they would they would they were doing they were doing their job as parents they were sowing the seed of the word into the little heart of Moses yeah you know what that's what that's what parents that's what we are our job is to do and we can't save them we can't fill them with the Holy Ghost so what do we do throw up our hands no we we sow the seed and we put confidence that if we sow the word in them then it doesn't matter what I am or what mom is or what you do or what what happens in life if you sow the seed all it takes is the light to flash across that seed and it'll come to life so he says they they sow the seed down inside Moses's little heart and he said and he knew it from the time he was born you were a special child Moses you were a proper child what did Brother Brandon mean when he says that he says you were different than all the other little kitties you were different than everybody you you didn't think the same as the rest of the teenagers that you were around you were different Moses you've been in you've been called to it to be a deliverer you were you were called and God said in God brother Adam says and God placed the equipment inside of him when he was born yeah it goes further and says he placed the seed of God inside of Moses so he knew it he was not only equipped with the gift but he was told by his parents he was taught by his church he was taught by the people he was ministered to he was preached to and he intellectually had absorbed all of that yet what did it produce a dead Egyptian he had all of the word all of the ingredients of the word he had all of the teaching good parents good raising told him the truth and he says it was an intellectual exception notice this he says Moses he was born afterwards he was brought to the place where he was anointed and notice the seed laying there with an intellectual conception the seed laid there with an intellectual conception with all the faith that he was born to deliver this people and yet it never come to life until that light from the burning bush flashed across them notice until he seen not something he read about but something he's seen with his eyes something that spoke to him and he spoke back to it oh my brother my sister we ought to say Lord give me an experience where I speak and it speaks back or it's not something I just read about but something I have and experience a living reality that burning bush experience he says oh how that did bring things to life I think any man listen to this next slide I think any man or woman boy or girl I think in an intellectual conception of what they think the word is and so forth never can how I want to just stop here and say this for a minute because we use these terms Paul's that if you could mute that for a second uh you just press the I think it's the beat the button B it'll should mute it um that's that if you can if you can that's good just find a way thank you I don't want people reading ahead of me I got to be careful because we use this word intellectual conception and we're not talking about that's there's there's a context in when that's we're saying that in a negative way but this is not in a negative way it wasn't that his parents had done anything negative by intellectually filling his mind with the word and it's there's nothing wrong listen to me young people here tonight here tonight you're taught the word of God and there's a there's a point in all of our life where we received all of us here today no matter where we are in the family of God if we're born of the Holy Ghost or not whatever stage you're at even if God's done a work in your life and he started to work on your in your life listen an intellectual understanding is all Moses had and it was given to him by his parents notice he says I think any man or woman boy or girl an electoral conception put it back up please and what they think the word is and so forth never can have a full Foundation stand until they have met that light that brings the word to a reality mama can't do that daddy can't do that Pastor can't do that sitting in church can't do that yeah go being around God's family it's wonderful being in the Fellowship of the saints of God it's wonderful but you've got to meet the burning bush for yourself you've got to know that you know that you know that you've you've met the burning bush and the burning bush has spoken to you and you've spoken back and he says he says that brings the word to a reality next slide now hundreds and hundreds of years before notice he says hundreds and hundreds of years before God had said that Israel was sojourn I think I missed a a slide I want to make sure that I have it if I don't that I'm gonna I'm gonna just stop because I felt so LED of the Lord too uh to read this yes it is it's further good thank you Lord now hundreds and hundreds of years let me find my place before God had said that Israel would sojourn and be mistreated in a strange country and would stay there 400 years but God with a mighty hand would bring them out so you see with this Burning Bush just as we know now sorry for the small text as a man asked me a few moments ago about the coming and the Rapture notice where he goes to immediately he's saying Moses had read the word he had he had been told the word and he says brother man and then go straight over and he says just as we know now and now a man asked me a few minutes ago but the coming in the rapture we know we've lived we know intellectually we've lived the time out at the time of the Rapture is at hand and we're looking we're looking we're expecting [Music] we're not just sitting down waiting we're looking we're expecting we're moving towards something we're reaching out and he says we're we're looking for a rapturing faith that can pull the church together and give it some super natural strength that can change these bodies that we live in I'm looking for that when we see a god notice when we see a God that can raise the dead off the floor or out of the yard and bring him back to life again and present it before us when we see a God who could take a cancer that's eat a man to a shadow and raise him up we just witnessed that two thirds two weeks ago a man sat right there where Mason's ate up with cancer dine with cancer and God delivered him of that cancer and he stood before the whole church and testified showing a pet scan full of cancer in a pet scan completely cancer-free when we see a man a God can take a cancer that see the man who shot he raise him up to a strong healthy man that ought to give rapturing faith that ought to give rapturing Faith oh come on friends when are we going to believe it when are we gonna stop saying it but actually accept it that should give Rapture and faith Lord give it to me tonight the body of Christ will be quickly gathered together to change the moment taken in the heavens yes there's got to be something like that happen if I could have just another two hours I would preach and stop right here and just preach a different sermon I have he says there's God to something he says he says there's got to be something this is what the prophet looked for not just in the early stages not just pre-seales but after this it was all the way down to two I can show you just the the communion service leadership brother man I'm saying oh I'm longing to see that Supernatural God come and move amongst his people once again I'm longing to see it brother Brandon says that he says I'm longing to see the real living true God move amongst his family in a supernatural way not an intellectual way not just a preaching sermons intellectual sermons but a burning bush experience where we expect a supernatural God to come and make his word live amen this is what brother Brandon was looking before before he passed away yeah to see that Living God come and make his word live not just take everything that he had preached and just go to seed and everybody Camp down around doctrinal and this difference in teaching this and doctrine of it this wasn't what was on brother Brandon's heart he didn't have a heart to go establish schools of prophets and schools of Theology and camps and said this wasn't on his heart what was on his heart before he left the scene was to see that Living God prove himself alive the same today yesterday and forever sir that was the theme of his ministry until he breathed his last breath say brother brother Matt why is that why is that so stir you up here tonight because there's got to be a transfer of that anointing and there's got to be a transfer of that expectation it wasn't just for a prophet it was so why did God give Hattie ride her voice so that you could have faith to ask for your children why did God give brother Branham why does God give uh give Hattie write her sons so that I could have faith for my family and my children and my lost loved ones there had to be a transfer of that promise to the believer [Music] I can't get sidetracked so let's go they've got to find says they they intellectual are right but you've got noticed this it's got to be something like that happen in our schools of theology can never produce that yet they intellectually are right but you've got to meet that light you've got to find that something in her Moses why Christ speak based in his great call upon the word and it was great until one day he met this light and the Very word itself spoke back to him he wasn't just reading but now what he was reading was now speaking and brother Brandon says then he got his anointing that anointed what he had in him that on the inside the intellects that believed it the faith that was based upon his belief in God that separated him from his mother and now when he strikes in the presence of the light it anointed that that he believed so there's a difference in an intellectual belief in the message of the hour and then when God strikes your heart and you meet the burning bush and it's no longer brother Adam's message it's your message it was no longer what happened there had to be a transfer in Revelations to John which was a type of the Bride it could he couldn't just hear the see the book and and the man the the the the the Bible says that John the angel spoke and said John said give me the little book and the angel said come and take it and eat it what is he saying young people it's got to be more than Mom's message and Daddy's tapes that they play during the day it's got to become your message you've got to go and take the little book and eat it and consume it oh can I get an amen from this church it's got to become ours personally he says Moses knowed this intellectually listen and he says he says Moses knowed this intellectually and the seed that was born in him was laying in his heart and he tried through his intellectual experience with the word to try to bring them out to deliver them because he knew knowed he was born for that purpose he knowed that the time the scriptures all said they had already been there 400 years he knew it and actually he knew it brother random says I think no church listen to this I think no church this is profound I could just read this and we could close no matter how intellectual and fundamental it might be that church cannot Thrive until the Supernatural is made known among the people I want a thriving Church and I want to say Lord make that we've already seen it we've already witnessed it he says no church no matter intellectual fundamental until the Supernatural is made known among that people and they see it what does it take it takes an expectation it takes a dedication we preached on it last time it takes a desperation why does God bring trials why does he bring pressure to produce Supernatural desperation and you start asking for things that weren't even in your heart you start longing and thirsting for God when you didn't have a thirst for the Lord you start hungering for his word when it wasn't there and what is what happens God puts you through the law God puts you through the tumbler he puts you in the pressure he puts you in the fiery furnace why because it produces a hunger and a thirst and a desperation not desperation what does it produce a dedication to say Lord I want to see the Living God moving among me moving among my children moving among my family moving among my marriage moving among my church moving in our music moving in our church no in the walls of the whole building of the whole church I've got an expectation I've got a desire Lord I want to be anointed by the supernatural [Applause] he says that church can't Thrive until the Supernatural is made known among the people and they see it something I love this something that they can talk to that will talk back to them I want to see that how many could say that by uplifted hand and say I want a family that thrives I want a home that thrives I want teenagers and children that thrive I want a church that thrives so what am I looking for I'm looking for the manifestation of the supernatural in my home the supernatural in my mind the supernatural at work the supernatural every single day of my life I'm expecting it Lord now notice we can preach the word explain the word but you have to receive the word oh Hallelujah that's what sets it a fire brother when you receive it the revelation something notice slips out of the Unseen World I hope that you don't glaze over this we can preach it we can explain it but you have to receive it that's what sets the fire brother when you receive it the Revelation is something slips out of the Unseen World the under comes rolling down through a mystical Channel somewhere into your soul that's a real New Birth that's not an intellectual dry-eyed confession I've just accepted I just believe it I'm just a I just accept the Creed of the church that's a real Holy Ghost branded experience when something Supernatural slips out brother random says it slips out of the Unseen World and it goes comes rolling down through a mystical Channel somewhere into your soul that says now I see it your eyes brighten your lips that hung down straighten up and smile every muscle in your body seems to rejoice that was testifying to a young person that just the other night and I said you know it's wonderful to see the work it's very simple it's a very simple thing make it so complicated it's very simple you know we you use terms I just want to be closer to the Lord and I got I want more of God in my life I want God in my life listen friends it's very simple there's works of God that God does in people's lives that are apart and they've maybe never been born again of the spirit of God a work of God went into a donkey's mouth and it spoke right that was a work of the Holy Ghost doesn't mean the whole the donkey was born again doesn't mean the donkey has eternal life right what is it it's very simple it's when you know that you know that you know that you have repented of your sins that you have died when you can say it doesn't matter if Mom don't go if Dad don't go though none go with me still I'll follow there's a determination in your heart when you can say I'm going to separate myself from all unbelief I'm going to separate myself from everything that's unlike the Lord everything that's displeasing to him and when you really come with that desperation in your heart and you repented of your sins and you've really repented and forsaken real repentance means you've forsaken everything that's why the Bible says he that's in Christ is a new focus on that word not reformed not remodeled [Music] not remodeled it's new it's not like the remodeling house it's a it's a it's a wrecking ball that comes and bulldozes your entire house starts from the ground and builds you new all things are are passed away behold All Things becometh New when you've really that germ is inside of your life has really been quickened that it doesn't matter there's no compromise it doesn't matter what the world does doesn't matter what friends do it doesn't matter what this brother does and this sister does what family does it comes down to a determination I was testifying that to her last night I said when I was 16 years old the Lord put a desire in my heart I wanted to live for the Lord Jesus I wanted to give my entire life to him so you know what I did I did that yeah and then make it complicated I didn't try to work it up I gave my life to the Lord Jesus and I I gave you my heart I've never asked for it back I've never turned back I've never looked back why there's nothing back there I've separated myself I've burned the bridges behind me you say brother Matt you were better than so I wasn't any better than anybody else around me but what was it it wasn't just an emotional I just want to be close to God I just want to have God in my life it was saying I don't want to be me anymore I want to die out to myself I want to leave me behind I want to be born again by a supernatural birth brother random says your eyes brighten your lips the hung down straighten up and smile every muscle and your body seems to Rejoice Angelic notice this here next slide here he says now he says Angelic beans make sure I didn't miss that good Angelic beings associate together oh I hope you get that that just dropped right down free look if you've got the holy spirit in you then you're a candidate for association with the Unseen World and the supernatural did you hear me France when the Holy Spirit comes into you it opens an entire Dimension that you never had access to before and it's not just a dimension of devils and demons and depression and anxiety now there's a doorway open to joy and peace and love and harmony and health and sin and satisfaction a dimension of angelic beings to come and anoint your life do you realize that that Angels come to and send you an anointing we're going to read here in a minute Angels come as ministering spirits to you amen no wonder people can't believe in those things they've never come in contact they've got nothing in here to believe with but when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart quickly he becomes then a two-fold being one of the earth to die and one of Heaven to live amen and his body in his body in your body brother man when you receive the Holy Ghost you were just you were just free of all sin no temptation no that's when the battle really began because I'm a twofold being now and he says his body is still subject to death but in his soul he's passed from Death unto life and his body he has his Earthly contact with his five senses in his Spirit he has a covenant he says and he has a contact with God through the Holy Ghost and the angels of God visits them speaks with them yeah and their Messengers sent from God to reveal and to bring messages from God to the individual oh I say let angels and cap about me let Angels let an Angelic hosts around me let them minister to me I'm tired of the Demons I'm tired of the troubles I'm tired of the depression I want to open myself up I want to close those channels how many can say that and I'm going to open up a supernatural expectation to say Lord I believe I can be anointed even if I don't feel like it here tonight I might have came here to this church feeling dry as I could ever be but I'm going to say Lord I believe I can be influenced by angels that can minister to me could anoint my faith notice he says then what have we got to be worried about Jesus is here his spirit is here what happened just now brother Brandon message Faith 1956. what happened just now I went into another world it's an Unseen World we become so conscious of looking at one another like this but there's an Unseen World it's greater than anything you can see and here's Christ in this world in this building here our evil spirits and War you might not have recognized that or realized that before stop reading the head listen you come to church you come to a Battleground ever do you know that every time you open your mouth and say my father whatever you say and address the Lord you open a dynamic Supernatural Dimension into another world when you open your mouth and you begin to pray that's what spiritual warfare is that's why Paul says we don't wrestle with flesh and blood against Prince or principalities but spiritual wickedness in high places therefore put only a whole armor of God what is it it's a supernatural War brother random says in this building right now notice and just in the previous quote he says what happened just now I stepped into another place I stepped out I moved into another dimension I left this place my body was still here but I moved into another dimension in this world in this building here are evil spirits and War and Christians anointed and the angels of God encamped about them trying to energize them with [Music] do you know that when you go out into the world there's not anything trying to energize us trying to de-energize you and you've got whether you can see it or not in an unknown unseen Dimension you've got every kind of stress and worry and trouble and Satan will bombards you with it whether it's sickness in the body or the Mind what's he trying to do he's trying to take a Christian and sap them of their energy he's trying to de-energize you that's why in the during the day you should be playing the tape of a prophet of the Prophet you should be playing a tape of brother Brandon why it's going to energize your faith you should be opening up the Bible and saying Lord I'm speaking speak back to me what's it doing it's energizing your faith and so is God here and the right here in this building tonight is angels and War but then there's God there's demons and War and spiritual wickedness and on this side over here if you would receive it there's the Lord Jesus himself and angels that are trying to energize your faith oh we ought to be an expectation for that we ought to be an expectation what does the song leader doing when he's up here seeing he's not just performing we don't have her performance these musicians aren't performing they do something mechanically and naturally but what are they trying to do they're trying to create an atmosphere so that heaven can just be open just for a moment so the joy can flood through the building so the peace can come into your life so that answers could come to your questions so that strength can come to your weaknesses amen and he says so is God so is angels and someday it'll be just as much reality as television or anything else because the spirit will bring us into that Immortal Life praise God then we'll understand someday that spirit of God that you're feeding right now someday I'll bring you into that Immortal Life you don't understand that right now you just get a glimpse of it and pieces of it and you have a connection to it but one day brother Bynum says the spirit will bring us in there fully into Immortal Life then we'll understand then we'll understand brother Adam says this he says Moses had to have his faith anointed I just forgive me this while I determine where what direction we're going to go with this here tonight notice what brother Branham says in the countdown we've read this last time now the horse and buggy days was who that was the end of the Lutheran age see horse and buggy they believed in justification God bringing the church from romanism Catholicism he brought it into his first Supernatural achievement that the just shall live by faith that was the horse and buggy days as they come from the horse and buggy days that ended now the next achievement man how did the way of transportation was the automobile you notice the automobile increases all the time in its power the end of the Wesley age brought in by spiritual achievement sanctification which means the church raised that's an important word she's moved up from a Justified state to a Sanctified State now we noticed again Along Came the methodists with sanctification there's many of those methodists was actually sanctified there's a lot of them that claim to know nothing about it listen friends just because you're part of something doesn't mean you partake of something right hello those methodists were there and sanctification just because they were all under his message doesn't mean they were all Sanctified you can be part of a movement and part of a Revival and part of an energy and part of a power and never partake of it yourself remember how we heard brother John Andy speaking about that at Youth Camp Billy Paul and his life had seen the angel even seen the angel of the Lord been there in the prayer lines and yet was so close yet so far amen some of those methodists he says but some of them I love this Methodist Church the Methodist Church taught sanctification they said they got down and cried and got back up glory to God I'm Sanctified they went right on living like they always did but some of those men and women was actually sanctified from the things of the world and lived a consecrated set-aside life some of them didn't miss it brother man says don't miss it that was the automobiles which took in more horsepower automobile the old T model was probably 15 or 20 horsepower she had 15 20 horses bottled up in a little engine like that sanctification when science achieved something by the natural God is achieving something by the spiritual see something's going on all the time then after the Sanctified notice what brother random says just the same as Henry Ford and them done with the transportation of the old Model T Ford up the side of the horse he moved on and above the horse State Wesley moved on and above the Lutheran day then Along come Pentecost next slide and as science of the world was able to achieve an automobile motor the Wright brothers that created or made manufactured rather the airplane the Flying Machine was far above the car on the Earth because he took to the air now the Wright brothers through their achievement was able to take science and pattern something here on Earth to show that there was a great spiritual thing fixing to happen remember we preached on this every achievement of man is only a foreshadow of what God's doing what he's doing in the natural man God's doing in the Supernatural and he says he's moving on up he's moving on up and he says he says it showed some great spiritual something fixing to happen and when the Wright brothers was able notice this wasn't these men they whether they realized it or not it was an anointing an intellect that God put upon the minds of men because he was needing to do something in the church because he was needing to do something to his family so what does he do he allows just like there's always been a way of a a Canaan enable a true and a false and brother random says they've always sought achievement Cane's seed has always built cities uh where where where great uh you know Builders of cities brother Brandon says what was it they were always moving towards education always moving towards science but the further you go towards education and science the further you get away from God hello that's what brother Brandon said and he says notice here they were they they were achieving something in the natural but for those that didn't miss it God was doing something in the Supernatural when the Wright brothers went to achieve that get a man's feet off the ground Pinnacles fell and took to the air with a spiritual gift with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he took to the air oh Hallelujah got his feet off the ground he could swim around got up in the air how far he was above the horse and buggy how far he was above the automobile he was up in the air President says what did it represent it's no longer intellect no longer theology no longer Martin Luther John Wesley was no longer a man anointing but God was trying to get his church that he had restored to come off of the Earthly and come up into the heavenly and brother random says notice this he was up in the air he was knocking and puffing and banging but he was flying what man achieves on Earth for they're made of things which do not appear God was able to achieve Something by A Spirit-filled people who were sitting there with their arms crossed and looked like bumps on a pickle let's read it again God was able to see something about spiritual people who were sitting there didn't really care just another Wednesday night just another service brother random said You know here we are 2022. what's going to happen next no it was people who were hungering and thirsty and those that would stay with the word amen amen if Wesley hadn't stepped out of the word and got a bad name behind him it's Carter crazy man and everything he would have never been able to achieve but Wesley was one of God's Great scientists Luther is one of God's Great scientists they didn't care what the church said what the organization said Luther didn't care what the Catholic said he believed the just shall live by faith Hallelujah I love this and he took the Kim of God's chemicals of the word and put it together and the church moved by faith Wesley put it together by the blood and proved it by the blood and the church got Sanctified the Pentecostals believed that the baptism of the Holy Ghost at the promise next slide he says that the promise is to you and your children and them that's far off and they put the chemicals together out of the word and they moved into the air they weren't Earthbound anymore everything looked different the same Earth that they had lived in the same word the same Bible that they had read now they got a different view of the world you ever got up in an airplane everything looks so different you say man I didn't even know that about Savannah you know about Charleston never even knew when I was flying landing on the airport I was actually near the Tallmadge Bridge could have hit it at any time didn't know I was only like three months maybe two miles as the crow flies but now you get up there and it's like oh man everything looks so different you see when God brings you higher and he gives you a revelation you come up higher all of your old previous thoughts and previous ideas and misconception is what you thought about God and what you thought about his word you have a whole new view [Music] that's why when you talk to someone who's never been up in the air in a plane and you try to tell them and describe them your but your view from the sky they just go ah yeah I don't know about that but once you've been up there and once you've experienced it and once you've tasted of it and once you've moved up in the air and you're no longer Earthbound brother Brandon says oh he says the Pentecostals believe the baptism the promises to you and your children they put the chemicals they moved out Hallelujah they moved out because they were able to accomplish stuff did you notice one of those scientific achievement accompanied the other one complimented the other one I know we read this last time but I just want to cover it the automobile was a higher form of transportation than the horse and the airplane was a higher form of charge facing the automobile but they accompanied one another you didn't do away with one just because we received the baptism of the Holy Ghost doesn't mean you don't have to be justified and sanctified and set aside for service right then when you receive the Holy Ghost you're not set aside you're put into service what about the Holy Ghost he says notice the automobile was higher they accompany one another horsepower if that's horsepower what about God power what about the Holy Ghost in power he says what was it no to skip on down to the Bold part they were spiritual scientists they seen the thing they believed it man did it by education the Natural Science the spiritual science has done it by Revelation one by education the other by Revelation oh if we can just open up there's all kinds of material laying right there but now notice this next but now something else has happened amen amen we got an astronaut now John Glenn our first astronaut found out so far above the airplane airplane can go you know you've had that view of the airplane but when you get that astronaut view man it changes again and it's similar to what you had when you were in the airplane but in some ways it's all together different you look at everything different the Bible becomes a brand new book and he says it's a greater power I love this that presses him so much higher than an airplane even is it that's right he's been able to do that all right now we gotta and I've got an astronaut a natural age notice you couldn't see it with your natural eyes next slide and the Bold you couldn't see it with your natural eyes and it can go whether there's any pressure there or not he can just go on out there because it's in a pressurized tank he could go out there and sell around and see the worlds around an astronaut oh my what an age that is coming yes sir go beyond any natural things at all and sweet Plum out into Yonder what does it represent a spiritual age a spiritual time where God's going to have spiritual astronauts amen they're here right now the Eagles are there that could go beyond any other birds sell above everything spiritual astronauts that can take the word of God and prove that he's the same yesterday today and forever a spiritual ass Glory that makes me feel good living in this age what a wonderful thing a spiritual astronaut notice and vote he says you become an astronaut that can go so far next slide it's beyond denominational thinking it's beyond anything else it's beyond the things of the church out yonder with God and him alone you stay astronauts yeah it's different than everything else it's different listen to me friends the message that came that we received was different than everything else previous and prior this was what was it as a fulfillment I don't have time nearly to cover we're just closing here but I just want to come to one more point this was a fulfillment of of a Biblical Prophecy of the coming of the Lord do you realize that you say brother Matt was it the coming was it there's still a physical Corporal coming of course we believe that but the stage of the the Rapture is in three phases three stages so the astronauts that would be launched the people that would be launched out of the airplane and go and sell Beyond this the atmosphere to the stratosphere beyond the Milky Way what was it it was a super natural power it was a supernatural message it was not an intellectual message it wasn't even an educated message message it wasn't a scientific message that might have been all right for another age and another anointing when those men were under that man age I'm sure they were a college educated educated refined eloquent polished men but this anointing wasn't going to be about polished and educated and sophisticated and scientific do you realize that God that's why God sent it to a Kentucky hillbilly who didn't have us about a seventh grade education because why God was not going to do it among the masses he wasn't going to do it it was going to be something altogether different it was going to come to the illiterate it was going to come to the simple it was going to come to the humble [Applause] thank God that was what it was representative that's why brother Brandon was so he wasn't just so that we canoe and all and so what a humble man what a man it was wonderful man of God was wonderful it was the reason he was poor came from a poor family there was a reason he was uneducated it was going to be a super when the spirit of God poured out upon a group and uh in the book of Acts it didn't come to the theologians it didn't come to the educated it came to simple people common people it came to illiterate people people that didn't understand brother man is there anything wrong with being smart no there's not anything wrong with it nothing whatsoever I'm talking about what the word of God did spiritually listen friends it wasn't the book of Acts was not filled with intellectual sophisticated people what was it it wasn't going to be anything natural it was going to be super yeah and the educated mind can't understand can't believe the supernatural but the simple and the simple-minded even the uneducated and unilliterate you read about the Revival that came to the Azusa Street Pentecost read about the men that were that this was a real move of God the pouring out of the spirit it didn't come to find Refined it wasn't Azusa Street Church was not a refined church with a massive steeple a brick building with white uh you know shutters and beautiful and educated and people wearing suits and driving fancy cars that's not where God poured out a spirit it was on a dingy little dark place where there was illiterate people it was on it was on a place that everybody looked at in the town and thought Oh what is that that little hole in the wall church that little nothing that little what is that little weirdo Church on Mossy Oaks Road little something that's listen it wasn't about the big Steeples and the big churches and the big intellect and the big fancy scientific things it was going to be a supernatural people a supernatural word where a simple people could believe it and have Supernatural faith [Applause] it was to the humble [Applause] those men were in Azusa Street weren't even educated so you know what it does and you take educated men and they want some of that and they start getting brother Brandon talks about this in the deceived Church by the world and he's noticed I'm just going to read it here Lord you told me to I'm going to notice what notice what brother Brandon says here just give me just one minute to find to find it here brother random says notice here and he says and I may not I may read a few more than I than I than I need to but that's all right this is the second Sue he says but notice uh I just won't let them just forgive me just for one moment let me make sure yes and he says here he says notice this white horse rider now just background in a little bit in this seal notice the white horse rider remember he wasn't Christ that's what brother Brandon had previously thought right wasn't Christ he says when he went out he serves in three stages notice the devil as I proved to you the other night is in a trinity just like God but it's the same devil all the time in three stages notice his stages in the first stage he comes in the Holy Ghost fell and people had everything in common that's what the Bible the book of Acts says hello Bible readers and they had all things in common there were no big eyes there were no little use the brother Brandon talks about oh brother Jones sister Jones no there was none of that everybody had all things in common socialism really everybody just gave gave up they gave of their own gave it their own uh uh uh increase gave to the church the spirit of God notices fell upon them and the apostles I love this I wish I had it here for you to read and he says in the spirit of God fell among them and the apostles went from house to house breaking bread with people and there was great science notice he doesn't say they went to house to house pulling out the Greek and the and the and the books of Theology and notice over here in the school notice he went to them breaking bread to people what was it about it was about supernatural a supernatural expectation a supernatural work he says he went and broke bread and there was a great signs and wonders and the first thing you know Satan began to cause a murmur to come up Ah that's his first stage the first stage in the falling of a way of the original message started with complaining and if that isn't exactly what started the fall in a way in our message and we really got to dress like that now we really got we really got to look like that we really got to listen to that kind of preaching we really got to teach that to our children I mean I was fine when my children were two and three and four but now brother Matt you know they're teenager I really got to force those kind of I gotta I gotta live like that I mean really what did it start with remember brother Brandon said it was came to those who stayed with the word and he says notice this here and he says he says it started with murmur then after a while these slaves and the poor of the land what received the Holy Ghost they went out into different places testifying poor people people that were slaves they testified to their masters and after a while they're beginning to become all kinds of army captains and different things and celebrity begin to see the gallantry and the Miracles and the signs that these men had done so they accepted Christianity don't let me lose you please and he says notice the work of God went out then all the dignity seated they went back and told their slave masters and I said let me hear about this oh it's Miracles Supernatural so they received it we accepted Christianity when he embraced Christianity notice this he says here well then you see when he embraced embraced Christianity and go down there to a place where they're meeting and a little old dark dingy Hall and clapped their hands and shout and speak in tongues and getting messages why he could never take that to his competitor notice immediately intellectually I see the miracle I see the fire I see the signs and wonders I see the power of God but when he go down there to that little dingy dark place where they're clapping and and Shout people shouting and speaking in tongues and he says notice he'd never believe it like that not that he wouldn't believe it he just wouldn't want to believe it like that notice they didn't go oh you know what I accepted it but now I see what it's producing not for me no no what does the devil do he hybrids it he says I'll take all of this and I'll leave out the that and I want all of this but I don't want any of that and I'll take some of this but I don't want any of that I want a cultured polished nice feel-good Vibes in my church nice feel-good sermons you know what because people with itching ears want that but there's a humble little group of people who've been anointed by the supernatural that says I'm not looking for the fancy I'm not looking for the big Steeples I want the supernatural anointing of God I want the power of God I want the reality of Jesus oh how many could raise a hand and say that's what I'm expecting that's what I'm looking for Lord doesn't matter if it's got to be in a dingy little place where people are shouting and speaking in tongues and dancing I'm not going to be ashamed of it it's who I am I've got my identity here this is all that I am I can't fit in in the world this is the only place among the only people that I fit in it's the only group that I'm comfortable around why because I've been translated I've got a supernatural anointing Hallelujah thank you they begin to get together and to think now we'll form something a little different Jesus right at me left to the first church age you told them the second chapter of Revelations I have somewhat against you because these Deeds of the Nicolaitans Nico conquer the laity in other words they want me to make instead of everybody be one they want me to make some holy fella they wanted to make some kind they put in the pattern after paganism for what they had come from they finally done it now watch first nicolaitan the nicolaitan was called in the Bible Antichrist because it was against the original doctrine of Christ and the apostles what sinful man could there be today that could look in the face of the Bible and see if the Holy Spirit isn't The Interpreter of the word today making himself known by manifestations of promises of the gifts and the things he promised to do in this day Malachi 4 being fulfilled all the rest of the scriptures being fulfilled and see we're right act the end time you don't need any man to interpret it no sir it interprets itself it proves it's the message of the hour what was it to bring a supernatural why did we read Galatians chapter 3 back to our text and we'll close all you foolish Galatians are you so foolish listen to me are you so foolish having begun in the spirit this is how the church started this is how God began this is your your origin this is your Genesis and it starts in the spirit and you think that now you can become perfected by the flesh it's the same exact reason why churches today are ashamed of Jehovah of the Old Testament they love Jesus of the new the Jesus that loves and sits and forgives I love that Jesus too but I want all of the Gospel I don't just want his care what if some of some what some story somebody told me I wanted Paul said to know him and the power of his resurrection they they're ashamed it's an embarrassment it's it's an embarrassment I'm preaching to you on anointed by the supernatural the Supernatural is an embarrassment to them it's an embarrassment so they turn their churches into feel good Comfort zones where sin is never mentioned in people's dress and how they live and people's consciences are dulled listen to me friends it's the same exact way the intellectual mind without a burning bush experience will always view the messages rules regulations and codes and bondage you've got to have a burning bush experience [Applause] it's the same way the intellectually minded man will always always always take the way of Cain always accept the way of worship that's beautiful and pretty and reject the blood and the bloody mess because it's an embarrassment I'm closing how are you so foolish having begun in the spirit and are now made perfect by the flesh let me say this as I wrote it down as the Lord just inspired me are we so foolish in the message of the hour having begun in the Supernatural are we now made perfect by the natural is it about a perform a pressure to perform is it about our performance of how we check off everything that we did this week and and we do this week listen friends you say brother Matt I would I you know I I I'm not I'm with you here you know brother Matt I don't believe it's by natural you know I don't believe it's by intellect I'm not talking about that right do we believe that it's up to us to perfect us do we believe that it's some behavior that we learn or that we live every day and if we we're a good boy long enough and certainly we'll have a body change listen if you started in the Supernatural then the body change will have to be the same way it'll have to be nothing that you've done apart from yourself it'll have to be grace that saved you and Grace that changes your body are we so foolish having begun in the Supernatural and now we're made perfect by the natural having begun I wrote this having begun the message of the hour to a simple uneducated illiterate seventh grade education having begun in the old-time religion with snotting and crying and screaming and pouring out our hearts to God in an altar now we're going to finish with a cultured refined dry-eyed people if it started that way it's got to finish that way it's a deceived Church by the world and I don't want to be deceived I want to say Lord you've started Us in the spirit let our church finish in the spirit have started with the supernatural how many can raise a hand stand to your feet and say Lord I want to finish with a supernatural expectation I want to believe from Miracles I want to believe for wonders I want to believe for signs that follow the believer I want to believe in the real baptism of the Holy Ghost that gives an experience that changes that person musicians it's a definite real experience I'm not told that young person the other night I said it may not be shouting you may you may not you may not jump you may you may not dance you may but here's what will happen you know something got a hold of you and it's changed you it's changed you from this creature from that creature brother Brandon says here come uh I'll I'll save that let me not read that bow your heads with me if you could just play something if you guys to Ruth oh are you so foolish having begun in the spirit are now made perfect by the law or by the hearing of faith are you so foolish having begun in the spirit now made perfect by the flesh he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doth he do it by The Works of the law or by the hearing of faith no you therefore that they which are Faith the same are the children of Abraham we are the children of faith I want to say Lord let me be a child of Faith how many could raise a hand say Lord let me be a child born of the supernatural let me be Lord not just how I was born but let me live my life under an anointing for a purpose an anointing listen those things got to be transferred as we preached on the expectation that was upon brother branham's heart right before he passes away has to be the same expectation that's transferred to the bride that same expectation not to see an intellectual not to see just a dry-eyed confession but to see a real living moving spirit that has free reign and freedom in his people and in this church how many could say I want that for me I want that for my family I want that for my life listen to what brother Brandon says here and I don't want you to just keep your head bowed every eye closed this is the message and what house will you build me into November 21st just a few days now it's November 9th 1965. I know that each of you if you feel like I do I am so hungry to see the spirit of God moving I wonder if that just resonate with someone's heart here tonight brother Brandon's prayer he says I know that each one of you if you feel like I do I am so hungry to see the spirit of God moving I just can't hardly stand it I'm raising my hand saying that's what I'm hungry for Lord I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God moving that I just can't hardly stand it Sometimes some experiences I've had just up in the mountain just to feel that once again that's something that when I first was saved was So Glorious in my heart and we can come into a place we can sit and we can see it among us that we're drying as we sit here in the desert I get among my brother and they talk with me and I talk with them always in a little way of watching filling out there with the spirit as it was to see the condition of the brother to see what's wrong I begin to fill us all reclining getting away from the spirit oh God let it not be us he says I begin to fill us reclining it's become too natural a thing to us my goodness every head doubt ever I closed when I read those words I thought Lord don't let me be guilty don't let me I'm raising my hand say Lord don't let me be guilty of reclining back getting away from the spirit don't let it become such a natural thing to us brother Brandon says we must Worship in the spirit where the spirit of God is Not only our message should be the flame of the hour it should be the flame of our hearts oh did you hear that it's not just the message of the hours the message of my heart it's the message of my cry it's what's with Who I Am Lord let it resonate from the deepest part of my being it's got to be in our hearts Lord let it be Jesus I raised my hand up Lord I'm just going to stop here raising my hands up Lord with all of these people I've preached it waited on you and inspired of you Lord to say what you wanted to say now Lord God I believe that you've said these things for a reason may they find me it may that word come Lord to where it was meant to come to let it find that Heart Lord and connect let that heart open up right now let go of every hindrance let go of you unclog every channel and forget all doubt forget all all fear and any kind of conception let it just be straight from you not even for me Lord let that Spirit speak directly to that heart here tonight Lord let us Jesus have a supernatural expectation I pray that we'd come into these doors on Sunday Every Time We Gather and assemble let us come with a supernatural anointing let our music and our worship be a supernatural anointing let us lord it's going to take us your Prophet said oh God let there be such a crave inside of me for it let there be such a desire and such a hunger and such a thirst I believe Lord I'm not the only one praying that I got my hands raised I believe there's a whole body of Believers those that are online those that are here saying Lord make me to Crave after it oh make me the Crave after it Lord your Prophet said we've got to have faith for for a body change Gotta Have Supernatural Faith it's got to be a greater faith it's got to be
