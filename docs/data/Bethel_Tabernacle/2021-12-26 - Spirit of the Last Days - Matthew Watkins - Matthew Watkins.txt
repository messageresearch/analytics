TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this morning just take just a thought the spirit of the last days the spirit of the last days verse 3 second timothy this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away look to verse seven ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth you can be seated this morning we have a some slides here to make sure this um is working real fast just make sure this is on there we go good all right praise the lord that's a few little technical bugs but we got them worked down it's amazing when you look at the declaration of independence one of the phrases that you find inside of there thomas jefferson said is what the government is put in place to protect and that is life is one of them liberty is the second one and the third one is the pursuit of happiness it's amazing that they put that in there if you've ever looked at the declaration of independence and thought what were the crafters what did they have in their mind when they were pinning this that we have the right and in fact they call it the inalienable right of a u.s citizen to pursue life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and everyone is pursuing something they call it the american dream i was driving on ladies island and seeing a an old uh just uh just dilapidated as dilapidated as it could get a class a that's the motor coach that you would drive in you know like a big rv and man this thing was dilapidated rusted um you know the wheel wells were rusted you could see into the wheel wells from where the tire was that none of the tires this thing was massive probably 40 feet long big and you could just as i was looking at that um that rv i thought man this thing's probably like a i would say like a 1985 model and out in these you know here's this man and this woman driving it i thought man probably and it's when that thing just came off the lot it was probably just nice and the paint job was new and you know they were the envy of everybody as they drive it now they're the laughingstock of everybody because the thing is just rusted to pieces it's dilapidated it's falling apart and and as i look as it goes by me i'm just these thoughts are running through my mind thinking man that thing was probably so nice when they first bought it probably you know nowadays a rv like that cost a hundred thousand dollars just to drive something like that and and then looking at the condition that it is now the glass was broke and you could see where the tent had started to scrape off i mean it was still it still wasn't wasn't uh un you know unusable but it was quite a far stretch away from what it was when it when it's glory days and it was incredible because as it went by me the black smoke just puffing out of the back of it and i looked on the side and you could make out the writing that was there that was sort of faded and was missing letters and the writing was the american dream and i thought my goodness what a what a stereotype of what a what a true emblem of the american dream and here this thing wrote right on the side of it the american dream and it had it had uh it had fallen far from grace it had fallen far from what it once was and that's what they call this is the the life lib to to have life to have liberty according to the crafters it's our inalienable right life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and so you begin with and it's a it's like a uh you would call it a just a vocation that you're given by by the the founders of the nation that that's your pursuit i mean that that's your that's your right is to pursue happiness and everyone is pursuing something you know you're you're today you're pursuing you're in pursuit of something all of us in this world uh you know today as i was pursuing something and i believe it's important that we know what we're pursuing i think that's a good question sometimes to ask us just here in sunday school something very simple what are we trying to that's obtain what is it that we're after what is it that we're pursuing what is it that we're chasing the world's chaste liberty they've chased life all throughout american history that's what you find is this pursuit of it's always progress always trying to improve and and without denial things have improved technology has advanced in ways that we never would have thought possible never would have dreamed uh you know the technology that we have today that we could pull out of something a device in our pocket and and and be able to video chat with someone in another country and be able to converse just back and forth or on your watch you know you can be running down the road and talking to someone on your watch it's incredible what technology has done and the world has progressed but has it has it has it found the question i have this morning is has it found what it's looking for has it found what they've called the american dream what does that really mean to have the american dream you could tell by the name of the bus the motor coach it was it was a life that was free and had freedom and had liberty and kid and had riches and had excess and was successful that's what they look at they pursue so because of that the pursuit of money you have the per people are always chasing and they they're pursuing uh their entire life mission and life purpose is money money is a is a is a an idol that's worshipped in this in our in our country people are pursuing it constantly trying to chase riches always chasing the next big paycheck the next big opportunity and i'm trying to give you just an idea of the pace that america the the american dream i'm trying to give you the pace and the atmosphere that the world because we're told that you're you're too that your inalienable right is to have life liberty in the pursuit of happiness and we heard that so we chased it we're chasing happiness well money brings half money bangs possessions so that must produce happiness what a lie that's been told to many a movie star and actors and music stars who've died by suicide at 18 19 20 years old because they got all the money in the world and they realize money doesn't bring happiness can you say amen some pursue money and they're always chasing that others pursue a bigger house a better car they're looking for status or some way to have an imagery that they give off and some of the most broke people in the world drive some of the nicest cars and live in some of the biggest houses because it's all about an image that you're as as it's the the cochlear ism as you know or you could say you know you're trying to keep up with the joneses or trying to keep up with this family and everyone's trying to keep up and trying to stay to make sure you're you know you don't have to be at the very top but just make sure you're not at the very bottom and it's all about an image some people are pursuing social acceptance in a higher class that's what they call when they say oh man you've i just want to make it i'm trying to make it i'm trying to make it i'm doing what i'm doing because i got to get out of here i got to make it what are they trying to make it to they're trying to make it to what people have defined defined in this shallow shell of what the american dream is so some people chase money some people chase status some people chase image and then you have other people who you have people who pursue money people who pursue image people who pursue status and then you have others who are pursuing they wake up every day chasing running laboring sweating but they don't really know what they're chasing they don't really know what they're pursuing they're just in this roundabout and what is it that they're trying to obtain the world is chasing life liberty and happiness and so now we ask this question here we are this many years past that inalienable right given to this nation and i ask have they found what they're looking for has the world here we are in the break of 2022 man the age of progress and we ask ourself has the world found after all those years of pursuit have we found happiness is the nation is the world happy when you look on the news you see streets that are burning rioting protesting you see a two parties screaming at each other fighting you you see a world that's paralyzed by fear every single day a world that's that's uh that's oppressed by hatred and hate and and anger and malice if i was to take the barometer and i was to tell you the temperature of the world of the nation and it doesn't matter where you go and what part of the country you're in you're a little better in the south i'll say that but yeah it's a lot lot better weather but if you were to take the temperature you'd get this across the board that the real atmosphere of the nation is not happiness but it's malice and envy and jealousy and bitterness and it's constantly i want to just this is so simple i know but i thought it was just good for a sunday school it's constantly being fed through cycles and there's always been throughout the dawning of of of news media there's always been a new cycle but now we live in the age of information we live in the information age and with the click of a button just on your phone just in the click of a button you don't have to go down and spend 25 cents anymore at a machine or 50 cents or a dollar 25 for the paper or get get and then go through the paper and and and be able to you know you don't even need a subscription service you don't need any of that you just with the click of a button with your out your phone on your computer on any device that you have we're in the world of the information age where everything is connected and and and and and with the click of a button with just the press of your finger you can ingest and consume gallons and gallons and gallons of hatred and fear and strife and anxiety and worry you don't have to go out and seek it just with the click of a button you don't even realize i don't think we realize sometimes how much of that we ingest how much of it that it affects us you know it's amazing because it's no accident we know that this is satan's eden and it's not just random we haven't just arrived at the information age you haven't just arrived here but it's there's a there's a design i want you to look beyond the surface this morning and understand that it's designed that way it's being controlled by an end-time spirit and that there's a movement happening and that movement has a leader it has a president and his name isn't joe biden but there's a leader there's a president to that movement he's greater than any president we've ever had he's greater than any pope the bible calls him the god are you listening the bible calls him the god of this evil age and he's a god because of his stat he gets god's status because he's worshiped by people it's and i want you to listen uh just listen real close what brother branham says here in investments he says now let's talk and bring it back home once you church members wants the same thing you want some preacher you women that will not condemn you for the way you dress and live somebody that'll pat you people on the back and tell you that you can do this that and the other and you can act like the world and live like the world and still maintain your confession of christ you're wanting those things you voted listen holly says this you're wanting those things you vote it you'll vote against a godly man out of your community to get a man like that in there it's the desire now remember and we i don't know how to uh to blank this maybe it's that good remember it was we've spoken this before ahab and jezebel evil king evil queen didn't just israel didn't just that wasn't just misfortune that they got an ahab and jezebel but ahab and jezebel was actually the reward for the desire of their heart it's what they were wanting so brother branham says you want a preacher who will not tell you how to live how to dress how to act you want somebody you'll vote them out to get somebody like that and he says it's the desire it's the spirit of the nation and then he says it's the spirit of the last days so there's a spirit of the last days we read about it in timothy and may i stop right here just a minute and say i believe that the people are in the preparation of the last great destruction this world will ever know i believe we're at the end you can speak to people you could put a billy graham in every city in the united states they'd drink whiskey and smoke cigarettes and laugh at you and everything else just the same they are in the spirit so what is he speaking of here this is an anointing this is a worship this is a spiritual something spiritually that they're participating in they don't even realize it but the he says they're in the spirit of the last days and notice this this is the prophet speaking here and god they're in the spirit of the last days and god cannot send destruction before the people are in the spirit for destruction another place he says you can't be healed until you get in the spirit of healing he says we can have a sp a healing service and he says but healing couldn't take place until you get in the anointing of the atmosphere of that that's why we have a worship service we can't really worship until we've entered into the spirit of worship and he says god can't send destruction until the people come under the spirit of destruction man i have to stop right there and say they are in the spirit of destruction you'll never see a an uh a group of of people that are more typified by destroying things than the age that you live in today and you say well they're burning the streets down and they're burning they're riding and building yeah that's one side of it the other side is get it on facebook and get it on social media and get it in their massive microphones and destroying and tearing down the other party it's all destruction brother branham says you could kill a man more than one way to stick a knife in his back speak against him speak against his character all right you with me he says they're in the spirit of the last days god never did destroy anything man always destroys himself so you have this constant you have a we live in the information age and as i said it's no accident you something you i don't think you even realize it to you this if you were to stop and transport yourself and travel back in time 30 years ago and you were to contrast it with today you would not believe you would not believe how distracted you are today not realizing it by um by a news media not just not just let's just use the word media because it's not just always fox news sometimes it's instagram and facebook and snapchat it's all media and you don't realize how much it's being thrown at you constantly constantly incessantly this thing's ding ding ding ding all through church and it's it's constant and you say brother matt why are you pointing out because i want you to realize this morning it's not an accident right it's very much designed the latest news breaking news i wish i had it on the screen big red breaking capital man when you see that you're like oh what's happened what's happened in the world breaking news do you realize that there's breaking news now every day every hour almost every second breaking breaking breaking a new a new story a new cycle something's happening and it's incessant information constantly the world has a iv they have they have an iv constantly plugged in being fed fear hate malice jealousy oh no i'm just reading the news right yeah it's constant no matter what no matter what your medium is no matter how you receive it it's constant and if you're not careful if we're not careful we find ourselves ingesting and you yourself can become a partaker of the consumer age because it's all about consumption they put big screens and big tablets and big devices what are they made for when they design these machines what are they designing them for consuming yeah hello it's like a it's like a it's like a a platter a plate and it's always being set down before you to feed it feed on it ingest it eat it consume it breathe it in take it in and brother branham says there's a spirit of the last days that falls upon a nation upon a people and it's an anointing listen let's just go a little further and we'll stop notice let's get back to cain again and get some of the faith in the beginning watch those spirits how they begin to move it's the spirit of anything that does the work of it anyhow the people have to be in this kind of a spirit to bring the latter days the peoples in the spirit of the latter days the nations are in the spirit of the end time amen you realize this is the world you live in you live amongst i'll never forget when brother jason demars spoke this one of the first times he spoke in this church and he says you remember you're living amongst diseased people when you go to work when you go to walmart i can make a joke there but i'm going to refrain from doing that when you go to target as well you're living amongst diseased people they've got a disease a sin disease and you're living amongst people who are under an anointing that's why you don't you man you you got to be careful nowadays you know in it whether it's on the road whether it's in a store whether it's whoever you're conversing with you you know you gotta you you don't just you don't just uh take every opportunity you can to contest with somebody at the traffic light you might just get shot and it might be by by a 17 year old kid who who who was having a but never had a criminal record at all before but because of the neurotic age that we live in tempers fly tempers go hot and then if triggers are pulled and people are dead that's the world the reality that you live in today amen because there's a spirit that is settled upon people and it's called the spirit of the last days listen to this they got atomic weapons hydrogen weapons all kinds of things because it's the spirit of the day the people are in the spirit of the end time the church is moving now listen i love this red too fast there they got atomic weapons hydrogen weapons all kinds of things because it's the spirit of the day the people are in the spirit of the end time the church is moving together under the power and the impact of the holy spirit so we're not under that we're we shouldn't be hello we shouldn't be under that spirit of hatred and malice and envy and destruction but we should be living under the impact of the holy spirit god's getting ready to take his and the devil's getting ready to take his let's all stand to our feet this morning thank you jesus for this morning lord for the sunday school teaching i pray that you would just bless everyone that hears it online
