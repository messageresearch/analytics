TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] do [Music] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] stand and read a scripture real quick if y'all would turn to genesis chapter 1 and we'll look at chapter 1 and verse 27. all right it says so god created man in his own image and the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth let's have a word of prayer father we ask that you would anoint the word that was about to go forth father that you would anoint my lips and my heart and my mind that i would speak what you would have me speak father and that people would hear what you would need them to hear father they would be able to sharpen their swords to fight the devil in the days and weeks and months going forward we ask these things in jesus name amen y'all can be seated um and uh go ahead all right cool this thing work awesome so um i gotta you know it's a real sunday school because i got a powerpoint today um but uh so um you see my title there by their fruits um and you know referring to the scripture where jesus said by their fruits you shall know them um but i had a subtitle as let every seed bring forth of its own kind now we've all heard that phrase um though it's not really i couldn't locate it actually in the scripture um through every search engine that i could find the bible never actually explicitly says that phrase exactly what it does do is starting in the book of genesis um in genesis chapter one and and we'll just read it here and it says and god said let every let the earth bring forth grass and herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass in her building seed after its kind and the tree yuling fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and god saw that it was good and then again in chat in verse 21 and god created the great whales and every living creature that moves moveth which was which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every winged foul after his kind and god saw that it was good and god blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let fowl multiply on the earth and in verse 24 and god said let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind and cattle and creeping thing and peace of the earth after his kind and it was so and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and everything that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and god saw that it was good so what we have is we see this pattern where god creates creatures and then within them is a seed to replicate themselves right within them is a is the instructions that they would need everything that they would need to continue and continue to bring forth after their own kind so we get this phrase every single every seed brings forth of its own kind it's it's more of a principle than an exact quote and so um we can now if we go down to our actual text which i didn't put my powerpoint to verse 27 so we see this progression right we see the plants then the fish and the birds then the animals on the land and then finally in verse 27 so god created man after his own image right he's continuing the pattern if the if the plants and animals he created and that they would recreate after their kind then the fish and the birds would recreate after their kind and then the animals in the land would recreate after their kind in verse 27 it's god recreating after his kind okay and that that the the the man that he would put on the earth would also have within him the seed that he would need to recreate itself right that the man would recreate what created him right if if the plant if this if if the the plants that would come from their parental plants would create plants then the people that would come from god would recreate god okay so really we when we look at this this is you know in the bible they use the archaic terms like seed or you know things like that and we know really through modern science and through sort of modern understanding and through biology we understand what that seed is referring to is genetics right i mean a plant seed and an animal seed are two very different different things if you look at them objectively biologically the only really thing that makes them you know that's in common between the two is a genetic package at the center of it right the the written instructions on how to recreate the creature that it's that that seed is intended to recreate and so what we might say is that every genetics recreates itself okay that would be another way of saying every seed brings forth of its own kind so because of this and i mean it the more i looked into this topic of genetics and dna because really when we talk about the field of genetics what we're talking about is dna right what were i mean the more it just it just blew up on me so um i want to do a quick little kind of wrap up my my thought here with this hopefully if i can contain it in the next 20 minutes or so um and so we look if we look at this is a sort of a very simple simplistic representation of what might be a human cell you can't really see it um because it might be a little small on my diagram there but you can see this a lot of different things there but really what we want to look at is that big purple circle kind of in the top right there okay it's called a nucleus inside that nucleus which unfortunately is a little small from what you can see out there probably is you can see a bunch of little squiggly lines okay in that nucleus bunch of little squiggly lines and that's your dna dna looks like a big long kind of like a piece of yarn with two two threads wound together and that dna is the instructions on how to recreate that cell not only that cell but everything in the body right i mean you think how does one creature know within itself how to recreate itself well it's because it's got written instructions dna on how to do that and every single cell in its body has a full set of instructions on how to recreate the entire body okay um you know if you have a but it's it's so not only does it have everything that it would have need of within that instructions it has everything that any other cell would have need of in that set of instructions right you say say you have you know in your body you have like a pancreas right and that pancreas you have little pancreas cells and they make you maybe you need insulin and that the job of that little pancreas cells to make insulin well given the right environment right you eat some sugar your blood sugar goes up well that pancreas cell on that string of dna there's little sections these sections are called genes there's a little tag on there called an epigenetic tag that when your blood sugar goes up it sends a signal activates that tag it opens up the gene for insulin and it expresses insulin right that's what that's the job of that cells is to do well same thing if you have an eye cell and it needs to do whatever eye cells do um it's got it's going to have the genes inside of it to teach it how to do that now you get a problem when a pancreas cell decides to be an eye cell that's called cancer right or if an eye cell decides to be a liver cell right this is not how it works right now we also have a set of instructions right basic instructions before leaving earth and we follow this and anything that we would have need of is in this in this seed in this set of instructions it's the instructions on how to recreate the entire body of christ now each one of us might have a different role right housewives have a different role than say deacons right but they have we have the instructions on how to do all of it right there's a lot of commonality between all of it but there are some instructions that are exclusive to deacons and there's some instructions that are exclusive to housewives right and if you get one doing the other then you get cancer okay now um and so as i would say that you know anything that that that little cell would have need of is in that set of instructions right if he needs healing well there's a gene for that right if he needs maybe he's he's uh got some problem that he doesn't know how to overcome well if he starts running through that genetics there's a set of there's a set of genes that can pretty much handle any problem that cell comes across um so um now there's a um there's another little thing i want to shoot i want you to see okay now some of y'all might recognize this guy okay after the last two years of kovid um this has become a pretty common little image and we already might recognize this as a virus well the world would call it a virus i'm going to show you that this is actually called the devil um so the way i know this is the devil is number one you see how it says viral surface proteins all over the outside well those little proteins most of that i would say about 99 of what's on the surface of that virus is the exact same thing that's on the surface of one of your cells right why because otherwise your cell wouldn't accept it right the virus the way it attacks is it comes up next to your cell and just integrates itself right in it just pushes itself right in and your cell will accept it why because it looks almost identical right it the devil's not going to come at you head-on he's going to come at you sideways and make it 99 the same okay not only that but if i go to this next picture now here's a just to give you a size comparison on the left there you got a red blood cell on the right you've got a covid virus okay that's the scale that little virus is tiny it's it's a little bitty thing it's nowhere near the size of one of your human cells it's a little bitty fox right it's these little things that look exactly like the actual body of christ but they've got something sinister hiding in there that one percent lie that's going to that's going to trip you up okay now the other thing um that i want to look at my notes here um so the reason why the virus is so small is because in your human cell we go back and oops excuse me oh oh no i have there we go all right you see all these little structures inside of there okay all those structures do stuff a lot of in involves um like uh reproduction specifically the other only other thing that i have marked out there is something called a ribosome that's actually what takes the instructions on the on the dna and makes it into a cell okay well you notice that guy doesn't have any of that that's why he's so small he doesn't have anything inside of him that will actually be able to produce anything he has no creative ability on his own just like the devil the devil has no creative power all he can do is that when he injects himself into the body of christ you can see those little squiggly lines now at the top is called rna for the purpose of this that's dna there are actually some viruses that use dna he's got a seed inside of him too yeah okay it's not a human seed it's a seed of discrepancy right he's got a seed that's going to recreate himself but he has no ability to do it on his own the only way that virus or the devil can ever recreate himself is to inject himself into the body of christ and hijack the creative capacity of the body of christ to reproduce his seed right that's it that's the only way he can do it and because that he can be small he can be sneaky because he doesn't have to be able to do it himself right all that's taken away um and all he's got is that seed of discrepancy that lie um and his purpose is to pervert the the true plan of god to to supplant the true seed that god put inside of humanity that that was god's seed to begin with because he made man after his own image and so if we look at the process of how how this would this would happen this virus would come in it would inject itself into the human body that seed would come in and it would um it would go into the nucleus and and completely there's they don't really have a label on there but there's other things in there that actually shut down the cell's ability to perform its own functions it no longer reads its own genetics and will only read that seed of discrepancy it takes a little bit of time to happen but it'll happen eventually and what happens is that viral genetics are being produced it'll just slowly make more and more viruses more and more of those viruses get produced until eventually the cell becomes so full of viruses it's no longer even performing the function that god intended to perform it's not reading the the instruct its own instructions that god intended it to read it's only feeding off you know only expressing this this this perverted seed and eventually becomes so full of viruses that it can't take anymore and the cell just explodes it erupts it ruptures and just blows all of these new brand new viruses all over everything around it okay and so we look at this and this is exactly what people will do they'll pick up some little thing that they don't think is such a big deal but it's got some sort of it's got a seat of discrepancy in the bottom of it they don't really realize and what'll end up happening is it'll come in and over time it'll supplant their reading of their true seed they'll stop feeding on the word you stop expressing the seed that god intended them to express stop expressing the dna that god intended to express they're no longer expressing the genes of god that were that was inside of them and instead they're expressing the genes of the devil and now here's the thing on the outside the little cells around it they don't know it's a mystery right they don't they don't know all they see is one day this thing just explodes one day their neighbor just blows up and is suddenly spewing a bunch of toxic nonsense that they have no idea where it came from right and the crazy thing is now one thing to note there it says it's rna instead of dna for the purpose of this is basically the same thing they do the exact same thing the difference is that rna is a little bit more unstable than dna which means it mutates it changes a lot of times so every time it's reproduced every time it's replicated it'll be a little bit different than the way it was before dna doesn't do that right god's word doesn't change but you get some lie of the devil someone will start with one thing and by the time they're by the time it all ends up they'll have two or three four different strains of it that ended up just you don't know what in the world you know where in the world it came from right because it just it multiplies errors and so here we have so so to the to other cells like you think okay how how does your body fight this right because the other cells they're not really going to know it's just like i said one day suddenly their neighbor is is gone crazy and they don't know what happened well in in the bible we get matthew chapter 7 says beware of false prophets which seem to you in sheep which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves you shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every excuse me every tree that bringeth forth not uh bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them okay so this is i wanna all right so this guy right here is a little thing in your body called natural killer cell also called lymphocytes if you've heard of those um and what this guy does is if if you want to if you want to so he goes around he's on patrol okay he's going all through your body and there's a little thing inside of all of your cells called i didn't put it on here called the major histocompatibility complex okay that's why i didn't put on the slide but this little thing called the mhc whenever your body is reproducing the genetics right you know actually expressing the genetics creates little proteins and it your body the little cells will will chop off pieces of those proteins every once in a while just like it'll just randomly select a protein that it creates chop it up into little bits and it attaches this mhc and then it goes and presents it on the outside of the cell okay why because this guy is on patrol and he's on the lookout he's got a special receptor on him that attaches to that mhc and then compares the protein that it's presenting to the genetics inside of it okay so it's saying i this this cell it has the original seed inside of it it has the untainted unpolluted word of god inside of it and it's going around and it's looking for any cells in the body that are presenting cells not in accordance with the with the word okay and so if it's producing viral protein right if there's a virus inside of it that's recreating itself on it might take a little bit of time but on the outside of that cell it will produce a section of that viral protein that that guy's going to see right it will not remain an internal affair when someone's full of viruses or this thing also just had cancer right because if it if you're if you if the cell becomes cancerous and it's reading that word incorrectly well that it's not going to match up to what this natural killer cell knows is accurate and it's going to do what the name implies when it comes across something that doesn't line up it's just going to kill it right it's not going to allow that to continue and so what we see what we see is within the body of christ you have to have a token on display on the outside because there's a death angel patrolling right we'll pick up let me see exodus chapter 12 and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt right all the way back to exodus where what that token was that blood over the doorpost was was god having the children of israel draw a petition a line between themselves and the rest of the world and say there was a price paid for these people but nobody else right there was a lamb they had followed the order of god's word and stepped into that word they were now expressing the genetics that god had would have of them right slaying the lamb putting that token over their door post so that when because if you actually read which i guess i can go ahead and read that because i have a few minutes um so if we come down um and it says in verse 1 and the lord's speaking to moses and aaron in the land of egypt saying uh this month she'll be under you the beginning of months it should be the first month to the year to you um uh hang on i'm gonna skip down a little bit um well i guess i don't have time to find it anyways the um the point is when in in chapter 12 when it says this it doesn't say it doesn't really say that that the death angel was going to come it said that god was going to come right god identified himself as that angel that was going to discern whether or not someone was falling within the line of order of god's word right if they would and and i always want to read um for and again i didn't have it uh time to to put it up but this is from the token um and it's brother brandon to give a little context his brother brandon talking about um how if uh if you know he was on trial for murder he'd go get a a an attorney and he'd want the best attorney that money could buy because you know his life is on the line right if and so he starts going down how god was was the judge and then all humanity was was on trial and then he said then he became not only the judge but the attorney as well um and so he says um uh the same one is judge is our attorney the case is settled we have the token both judge and attorney is the same person when god was made flesh and dwelt among us our judge became our attorney and the case is settled he says and the holy ghost is here for a token that we're ready to pass from here into the lands beyond okay now take that statement where you can because of this we can now say any time when brother branham's talking about having the token entered where he says the word token interject the word holy ghost there okay um and we'll skip down a little bit as if the token or the blood in the time of egypt's coming out their exodus if the token was so the supreme sign um skip down um says the token was not no good unless the token was displayed right holy ghost ain't no good unless your holy ghost is displayed right the the holy ghost or the token had to be displayed not a sympathizer with the token but the token must be applied and no matter how much anyone could prove that he was a jew and a covenant jew by circumcision that didn't do anything about it at all it took the token not the covenant he never said when i see the covenant sign but when i see the token so you might be a professed christian you might be be a covenant with christ but unless that token is displayed in this late hour that we're coming to now there's no way for him to pass over the token must be displayed it must be on and so we could say you know we have a relationship with christ we're in the message we we have all sorts of of good teaching we have the message books we read them all the time hey guess what the cell doesn't lose its dna just because a virus comes in right you might have access to the message books but if you're expressing something from the outside and not what's within that word of god when that when god himself comes and visits you you're not going to have the the appropriate word on display right if you've been infected with some sort of seeded discrepancy some some it might look really good it might look 99 it might be so tricky you just let it right in but if it's not actually in line with the word that god gave you then you're you're going to express it on the outside eventually right i don't care how long you stuff it down on the inside it's only a matter of time before that virus just so replicates you can't hide it anymore and you'll display it on the outside and when you do right that's it yeah right that your your your token because because the cell in a in its everyday as long as it's expressing what it was intended to do following with the instructions that it had it'll present the word that was given originally right as long as we're following the scripture your life will pattern itself right you'll always be presenting if this is your what you're feeding on right if this is what you're expressing then and that's what you're patterning your life after right because that little cell in its day-to-day functions it's always going back to that word to decide what to do right and your day-to-day functions everything that you're doing you're always going back to the word decide how to conduct your affairs then your out external life will display that seed that you've been you've been expressing the minute that you bring something else in it's only a matter of time before you you express something outside of that before you express something poisonous or toxic you know you want i mean people wonder oh you know everything's going great and then suddenly out of nowhere i blow up and have this crazy fight with my wife and it didn't even make any sense well what have you been feeding on exactly right what was the first thing you did in the morning when you got out of bed you know what what did you do did you you know um did you pick up your phone and read the news and fill your head full of a bunch of like carnal nonsense that the devil put out just to make you depressed and suddenly your day has been kicked off by depression so no wonder you're in a bad mood you know i mean it's simple it seems really simple and small but hey guess what that virus is a tiny little particle it's really simple it's not that complicated but it's something that if you've been if you're if you're not going back to read that word you're not going to express it and anything that you have been in taking in you will express it eventually it's just a matter of time and i am two minutes over so we'll shut it down there and we can stand and have a word of prayer father we thank you for this time that maybe you would take the stumbling of my words father and my foolishness of preaching that these people would might be able to gain something out of it and take something practical that they'd when they roll out of bed tomorrow morning they'd be able to take the fight to the devil a little bit better we ask these things in jesus name amen [Music] foreign
