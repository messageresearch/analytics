[5:24] prayer Heavenly Father Lord we're
[5:26] grateful and thankful for another

[5:43] praise this morning Father invite you
[5:45] here Lord this morning for service Lord
[5:47] for worship father we're just here to
[5:49] hear from you Lord I ask all these
[5:52] things now in the name of Jesus Christ
[5:54] amen amen let's open up our Bibles and
[5:57] turn to uh the book Book of Luke this
[6:00] morning we're going to go to
[6:02] two two portions of scripture we have a
[6:05] little bit of a lengthy reading so I'm
[6:07] going to just try to be mindful
[6:09] here Luke chap 2 and verse
[6:13] 25 Luke 2 and
[6:16] 25 it says and behold there was a man in
[6:19] Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the
[6:22] same man was just and devout waiting for
[6:25] the consolation of Israel and the Holy
[6:27] Ghost was upon him and it was revealed
[6:29] unto him by the holy ghost that he
[6:32] should not see death before he had seen
[6:34] the Lord's Christ and he came by the
[6:36] spirit into the temple and when the
[6:38] parents brought in the Child Jesus to do
[6:40] for him after the custom of the law then
[6:43] took he him up in his arms and blessed
[6:45] God and said Lord now let us thou thy
[6:48] servant depart in peace according to Thy
[6:52] word for mine eyes have seen thy
[6:56] salvation which thou Hast prepared
[6:58] before the face of all thy people a
[7:01] light to the Gentiles in the glory of
[7:04] thy People Israel and Joseph and his
[7:07] mother marveled at those things which
[7:08] were spoken of him and Simeon blessed
[7:10] them and said unto Mary his mother
[7:12] behold this child is set for the
[7:14] fall and the rising again of many in
[7:17] Israel and for a sign which shall be
[7:18] spoken against yet a sword shall pierce
[7:21] through thy own soul also that the
[7:23] thoughts of many hearts shall be
[7:24] revealed amen God bless you as you take
[7:26] your seats this morning I'm just going
[7:28] to actually turn over in the book of
[7:30] Samuel as well and that one's a little
[7:31] bit lengthy so I thought we could just
[7:33] read that as we're SE seated here 1
[7:35] Samuel the 1
[7:37] chapter now there was a certain man of
[7:40] Ral zofim 1 Samuel 1 and verse one we're
[7:44] going to skip around here a little bit
[7:46] just for a context and there was a
[7:47] certain man of Ramo zopim of Mount
[7:49] Ephraim and the name was Elena the son
[7:51] of Jerome the son of eliu the son of
[7:53] toou the son of zeu an nephite and he
[7:56] had two wives the name of one was Hannah
[7:58] the name of the other was panah and
[8:00] panah had children but Hannah had no
[8:02] children and this man went up out of his
[8:04] City yearly to worship and to sacrifice
[8:06] unto the Lord of hosts and Shiloh and
[8:08] the two sons of Eli Hoff and Phineas the
[8:10] priests of the Lord were there and when
[8:11] the time was that Eleni offered he gave
[8:15] to panah his wife and all her sons and
[8:16] her daughters portions but unto Hannah
[8:19] he gave unto a worthy portion for he
[8:21] loved Hannah but the Lord had shut up
[8:23] her womb if we skip down to verse 9 but
[8:26] Hannah rose up after they had eaten in
[8:27] Shiloh after they had drunk now Eli the
[8:30] priest sat upon a seat by a post in the
[8:32] temple of the Lord and she prayed in the
[8:35] bitterness of her soul and prayed unto
[8:36] the Lord and wept sore and she vowed a
[8:39] vow and said oh lord of hosts if thou
[8:41] wil indeed look on the Affliction of
[8:43] thine handmaid and remember me and not
[8:46] forget thine handmade a Manchild then I
[8:48] will give unto him the Lord all the days
[8:50] of the life and there will be no razor
[8:52] upon his
[8:57] head I want to take a title this morning
[9:00] the unselfish reaction we're going to
[9:02] look at these two characters this
[9:03] morning Hannah and Simeon we're going to
[9:05] refer back to Samuel in a few minutes
[9:07] but the man Simeon in the Bible the
[9:10] Bible the Bible said that the Holy
[9:12] Spirit was upon him and said to him
[9:14] Simeon you're not going to see death
[9:16] before you see the Christ and when it
[9:18] was revealed to him Simeon believed for
[9:20] it and one day when the Lord set events
[9:23] in order to bring his life uh bring his
[9:25] life to that promise Simeon was
[9:27] hungering and thirsting for that promise
[9:30] to come to pass you know he had maybe
[9:32] grown old in age holding on to that
[9:34] promise and you know the Bible says
[9:37] Matthew 56 if you're hungry for more of
[9:39] God the Bible says that those that are
[9:41] hungry and thirst for righteousness they
[9:42] shall be filled amen so one day the Holy
[9:45] Spirit came down and spoke to
[9:48] Simeon and he said you know Simeon now
[9:50] is the time for that promise to come to
[9:52] pass in your life you know I revealed
[9:53] this thing to you and now is the time
[9:55] for this thing to happen and you know
[9:57] Simeon found that little baby among
[9:59] among the crowds it wasn't the fanciest
[10:01] dressed one it wasn't the world the one
[10:03] the world may have thought of maybe not
[10:05] even the one that Simeon would have
[10:06] thought of but it was Jesus and Simeon
[10:09] comes to that juncture in his life and
[10:11] you just look at his reaction I may now
[10:13] depart in peace you know he didn't ask
[10:16] to to stick around and see how it would
[10:18] come to pass he he didn't need the Lord
[10:21] to do anything more than what the Lord
[10:22] had revealed to him would happen in his
[10:24] life and out of the thousands of the
[10:27] things in the Bible that said aren't
[10:29] documented John 21:25 even all the books
[10:31] could not contain the things that are
[10:33] documented God saw fit that this event
[10:36] be recorded in scripture he was pleased
[10:39] with simeon's reaction to what the Holy
[10:42] Spirit did in his life little old Simeon
[10:44] you know God chose to reveal this thing
[10:47] this thing to him and I'd like to just
[10:48] focus this morning on Simeon simeon's
[10:51] attitude for a moment you know brother
[10:52] Brena makes a great drama out of the
[10:54] scripture in a few sermons God keeps his
[10:56] word 1958 and the sermon Simeon 1954 I'm
[10:59] going to quote a few a few times from
[11:01] both of those you know and he said that
[11:03] God always has a Remnant who was waiting
[11:06] on his promises amen he always has a
[11:09] Remnant that is waiting on his promises
[11:10] we're that Remnant waiting on his
[11:12] promises amen we're a part of that here
[11:13] this morning and as he was feeding on
[11:15] the word that one day in the temple as a
[11:18] as a priest maybe would normally be just
[11:20] reading on the word maybe he was reading
[11:22] the scroll brother benam says of Isaiah
[11:24] 9 where it says unto us a child is born
[11:27] unto us is given and the government
[11:29] shall be upon his shoulders and his name
[11:31] shall be counselor and and Prince of
[11:33] Peace and and the Mighty God the
[11:34] Everlasting father and when the Bible
[11:37] says that the Holy Spirit revealed to
[11:38] him that he wouldn't see death before he
[11:40] had seen the Lord's Christ and this this
[11:43] Revelation was something that was
[11:44] completely settled in his heart it was
[11:46] something that would that was happened
[11:48] and when brother randam dramatizes this
[11:50] this event in the Bible he says you know
[11:51] maybe he went around and maybe he was
[11:54] they called him a Holy Roller you know
[11:55] maybe you know he he testified to this
[11:57] for a long time and they just said oh
[11:59] this old this old fogy this is you know
[12:01] what are you talking about Simeon but
[12:03] this was a revelation in his heart that
[12:06] God had told him this was going to
[12:08] happen and you know then the Lord came
[12:11] to him at this point it was time for
[12:12] this thing to be fulfilled and the Lord
[12:14] told him set down the scroll and follow
[12:16] me over this way just kind of dramatize
[12:19] here for a minute God leads by his
[12:20] spirit amen in in all cases God leads by
[12:22] his Spirit you know maybe he came around
[12:24] looking looking around the building and
[12:26] not sure exactly where he was going but
[12:29] just deep down something in his heart
[12:30] told him to keep going and look this is
[12:32] the day that I'm going to fulfill this
[12:34] scripture I'm going to fulfill this this
[12:36] this Revelation in your heart so just
[12:38] keep going it was settled you know and
[12:40] at that time in Israel's history the
[12:42] custom was that on the eighth day after
[12:44] the children were born that they would
[12:46] bring their male children down to the
[12:48] temple for purification and the
[12:50] cleansing of the mother for the
[12:51] circumcision of the baby boys so this
[12:53] particular day Simeon was being led of
[12:55] the Lord to go down to this place and he
[12:56] gets this you know he gets to this place
[12:59] and the Lord tells him you know this is
[13:01] this is that Prince of Peace that you
[13:03] were just reading about this is this you
[13:05] remember when I revealed this to you
[13:06] this is that this is him and his
[13:08] reaction was so humble and so so
[13:11] grateful so thankful you know the kind
[13:14] the focus this morning you know he
[13:15] probably took little baby Jesus and
[13:17] lifted him up you know with tears just
[13:19] running down his face falling from his
[13:21] beard and he said Lord let your servant
[13:24] now depart in peace according to your
[13:27] word for mine eyes have now seen your
[13:31] salvation you know I think many times
[13:33] the Lord sets up things stages in our
[13:35] lives he brings things together he hears
[13:37] our
[13:38] prayer and he cares about it amen he
[13:41] sets things in order and events in order
[13:44] to answer your prayer or to reveal
[13:46] something special to us and then when
[13:48] that light of Revelation does strike in
[13:50] your
[13:51] heart it's settled in there amen and
[13:54] he's always
[13:55] faithful but what is our reaction to do
[13:59] it back there in first Samuel Hannah
[14:02] actually she had no children she was
[14:04] Barren but something in her was so
[14:07] desperately longing to Bear children to
[14:09] have children to be a mother so she
[14:11] travailed it says the Bible says and
[14:13] brother randomp said her soul traveled
[14:15] she got in desperation she had a need
[14:17] amen many of us have gotten into those
[14:19] positions in our life right that we have
[14:21] a need and and we come in those
[14:23] desperations brother random says this in
[14:25] U desperation 1963 she got on her knees
[14:27] and she never noticed the Dignity of the
[14:29] temple she never noticed the dignified
[14:31] priest as he walked out she was in such
[14:34] distress till her tears were rolling
[14:36] down her cheeks cheeks and she was
[14:38] crying in desperation oh Lord God give
[14:40] me a son give me a son and notice I want
[14:43] you to just catch this here notice she
[14:46] wasn't selfish when God heard her and
[14:49] answered her prayer and gave her a son
[14:51] she gave him back to God and because
[14:55] that she was not willing to be selfish
[14:57] after God had answered her prayer pray
[14:58] her God gave her a prophet as a son oh
[15:02] that was an extra blessing he says and
[15:04] he's just full of them those extra
[15:06] little blessings he gives not only a son
[15:08] but a prophet and there had been no open
[15:11] Visions for many years in Israel so this
[15:13] was a great blessing and she wasn't
[15:15] selfish about it he answered her prayer
[15:17] and her reaction to God answering her
[15:20] prayer became this incredible testimony
[15:22] that we can read about you know she
[15:24] couldn't have kids and her prayer was to
[15:26] have kids and God granted her that
[15:28] request and she was so thankful and so
[15:30] grateful that she gave them back to God
[15:33] and she remembered the vow that she had
[15:35] committed to
[15:37] God even even if sometimes those vows
[15:40] that we do make to God in those things
[15:41] are hard you know if even if it meant
[15:43] giving her blessing
[15:45] back one night as I as I was just coming
[15:47] to this thought this thought had come to
[15:48] me and I was in prayer about a situation
[15:50] one of those things that you know you're
[15:52] earnestly in prayer about you know we
[15:54] all have those things maybe there just
[15:55] something in our heart that we're
[15:56] praying about the Lord would reveal to
[15:58] us the Lord would lead us and guide us
[16:00] on a certain situation and one night
[16:02] just after weeks of prayer the Lord had
[16:04] revealed some light on the situation
[16:06] aren't you glad for those things amen
[16:08] I'm so glad for that you know brother
[16:11] Benham says in the church age book the
[16:12] importance of Revelation by the spirit
[16:14] to a True Believer can never be
[16:17] overemphasized Revelation means more to
[16:19] you than perhaps you realize now I'm not
[16:22] talking about this book of Revelation
[16:23] you I'm talking about all Revelation it
[16:26] is tremendously important to the Church
[16:29] you know
[16:30] and the Lord has many ways of blessing
[16:33] his people you know he can bless through
[16:36] you know physical things you know
[16:37] material things I I understand that but
[16:39] the Lord has many other sources as well
[16:42] the Lord blesses through trials the Lord
[16:44] blesses through afflictions the Lord
[16:45] blesses through Ministry the Lord
[16:47] blesses with joy the Lord blesses the
[16:49] list can just go on and on and on but I
[16:52] think one of the most important things
[16:53] that He blesses us with is revelations
[16:55] in our life amen because Revelation
[16:58] tells tells you who you are amen the
[17:01] first church age brother bam says that's
[17:03] what the devil fights the hardest is to
[17:05] keep you from the revelation of who you
[17:07] are in
[17:09] him he says in this Revelation he tells
[17:11] us about what the end of the devil is he
[17:14] tells us how he was going and what he
[17:17] was going to deal with the devil and
[17:18] cast him into the Lake of Fire he
[17:19] reveals the end of the wicked one who
[17:23] would follow Satan and Satan hates that
[17:27] Jesus said about Satan he has no part in
[17:29] me and I have no part in him the devil
[17:30] would like to prove that different but
[17:32] he cannot so he does all that he can to
[17:34] destroy confidence in the word but when
[17:36] the church disbelieves Satan and
[17:38] believes the spirit's revelation of the
[17:41] word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[17:43] against her and that is the thing that
[17:45] the the devil tries to keep you from is
[17:47] to keep you of revelation of who you are
[17:50] in Jesus Christ amen and he knows that
[17:52] if the people can get in the church age
[17:55] book he knows that if the people can get
[17:56] the true revelation of the true church
[17:59] of what she is and what she stands for
[18:00] that she can do the Greater Works and
[18:02] that she can be an invincible Army amen
[18:06] if they get the true revelation of the
[18:08] two Spirits within the framework of the
[18:10] Christian church and by God's spirit
[18:11] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[18:13] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[18:16] her he will be definite he will
[18:19] definitely be thed today as when Christ
[18:21] wasto every effort to gain power over
[18:23] him in the desert yes Satan hates
[18:26] Revelation but we love it
[18:29] with true Revelation in our lives the
[18:31] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it
[18:33] but we will prevail over them amen you
[18:36] know and he goes on to say in the church
[18:38] age book that the only the the only way
[18:40] to gain Revelation is through the Holy
[18:42] Ghost you know and he and he you know
[18:43] says it's nice to study scripture and
[18:45] that's a good thing you know we're
[18:46] supposed to study scripture we're
[18:47] supposed to study the Bible supposed to
[18:49] study the message but it's only the Holy
[18:51] Ghost can give you Revelation to show
[18:52] you what this is and what this is and
[18:54] put them together right and as Believers
[18:56] of God's word we know what the path is
[18:59] to take to get us to those points you
[19:02] know Faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[19:04] of the word of God right so the devil
[19:06] fights us harder than anything on that
[19:09] pathway hearing the word and finding the
[19:12] revelation of who you are in the word he
[19:14] just as simple as it is he just fights
[19:16] you from hearing about scripture he
[19:19] fights you from reading the word he
[19:20] fights you from listening to the message
[19:22] because he realizes that if enough light
[19:24] can shine on that seed in you then it
[19:26] can grow and as it begins to grow then
[19:28] all of those things will break away and
[19:30] you can become who you are Hannah's
[19:33] principle of of desperation speaks to
[19:36] how Believers should should should seek
[19:38] Revelation in their life she was
[19:41] desperate for it she laid it before God
[19:43] you know you don't care who makes fun of
[19:45] you you don't care how ridiculous you
[19:47] look Hannah looked probably really
[19:49] really ridiculous in that situation even
[19:51] the Bible says even the even the prophet
[19:53] Eli was like what what are you doing you
[19:54] know your lips are muttering are you are
[19:56] you in strong drink have you been have
[19:57] you been been drunk but she said no this
[20:00] is I'm in desperation for I have a need
[20:02] I want the Lord to speak to me that's
[20:04] how we should be with God in our lives
[20:06] with Revelation Lord I want you to speak
[20:08] to me I want you to I want you to reveal
[20:10] yourself to me I need more of
[20:12] you and you know when even how
[20:14] ridiculous you look in those situations
[20:16] God is always faithful to meet you there
[20:19] he's always faithful to reveal himself
[20:21] to you and but the devil always fights
[20:23] those simple things in your life he
[20:26] desperately tries to keep you from
[20:28] becoming sincere in your seeking brother
[20:30] rendom says this in the church age book
[20:31] he says is it is that simple there is
[20:34] nothing of such prevailing power as
[20:36] revelation of the word in verse three in
[20:39] a blessing a blessing is pronounced on
[20:41] those who give special attention to this
[20:43] book I think this refers to the Old
[20:45] Testament custom of the priest reading
[20:47] to the congregation in the morning you
[20:48] see many could not read so the priest
[20:50] had to read to them and and as long as
[20:53] it was the word the blessing was there
[20:55] it didn't matter if it was read or heard
[20:57] some sometimes he keeps you from being
[20:59] in church because it doesn't matter if
[21:01] you read it or hear it faith comes by
[21:03] hearing and he knows that if you just
[21:05] sit in church and you get under the
[21:06] anointing of the Holy Ghost that he
[21:08] knows he can bring you to where you are
[21:11] he knows that God can bring you there so
[21:12] he fights you he fights you so hard
[21:14] maybe to not get to church on time maybe
[21:16] to maybe to have mind battles when
[21:17] you're at church maybe to just keep you
[21:19] from where you need to be in church
[21:22] amen Revelation can come by sitting in
[21:25] church and you know just just to kind of
[21:28] give you a little insight here the Lord
[21:30] maybe lays it on a on a Brother's heart
[21:32] to go a certain direction by the
[21:33] inspiration of the Holy Ghost right you
[21:35] know there's a battle in the entire
[21:37] process just to give you just some steps
[21:40] here the Lord sees what you have need of
[21:42] so one day he sets it in motion for the
[21:44] pastor to have a burden to take a
[21:46] certain position to go this route in the
[21:48] scripture maybe the pastor has no idea
[21:50] why he's going that way right or maybe
[21:53] he sets it on you know one of these
[21:54] other brothers heart you know to
[21:56] minister a certain direction and you
[21:57] know the the devil fights it the whole
[21:59] way discouragement fights that preacher
[22:00] so hard you know maybe it's just me but
[22:03] you know I'll go through a hundred
[22:04] different scenarios in my head on on how
[22:06] this seems like a ridiculous thought or
[22:08] you know it's a weird angle or or or it
[22:10] doesn't make any sense or or you've
[22:11] already went that direction before and
[22:13] he and then he fights you he fights you
[22:16] as well maybe at Sunday morning he laid
[22:18] it on your heart to make it to Sunday
[22:19] school maybe he laid it on your heart to
[22:21] come to church you know but the devil
[22:23] has every H every demon in Hell fighting
[22:25] you to get there you know maybe the kids
[22:27] are extra fussy that morning and your
[22:29] car is making a funny noise or whatever
[22:31] the case is maybe it's maybe it's a
[22:32] mental battle right you're you're here
[22:34] you're in service but you're thinking
[22:36] about other things right you're
[22:37] discouraged you're depressed you're
[22:39] thinking about work you're stressed
[22:41] you're you're maybe you're not motivated
[22:42] to go all the while the Lord is fighting
[22:45] a battle in this Supernatural realm to
[22:47] get you in church because he knows that
[22:49] you've been praying about a certain
[22:51] thing so the Lord will just take that
[22:53] thing and he will bring you Revelation
[22:55] in that thing so the devil somehow he
[22:57] knows knows somehow the devil knows
[22:59] there's there's there's there's power in
[23:01] being in church so he just keeps you
[23:02] from
[23:04] there you know this is just all things
[23:06] that's going on in the spiritual realm
[23:08] you know and half the time we don't
[23:09] probably more than half the time we
[23:10] don't even realize that those things are
[23:12] going on but circumstances Prevail and
[23:14] the lord always will prevail amen you
[23:17] know you make it to church that day you
[23:19] know the the worship leader maybe sets
[23:21] it sets the right atmosphere get you out
[23:23] of the brain frog fog that you were
[23:25] living in then the word comes forth
[23:28] the and the thing that's been so heavy
[23:30] on your heart maybe something the pastor
[23:32] says just sheds enough light the right
[23:34] amount of light then it's unveiled to
[23:35] you that's what brother Benham says in
[23:37] the church age book that that that
[23:39] Revelation is it's an unveiling of
[23:40] something and it's settled in your heart
[23:43] you know that without a shadow of doubt
[23:45] that the Holy Ghost spoke to you Simeon
[23:47] knew without a shadow of doubt that the
[23:48] Holy Ghost spoke to
[23:50] him Peter may still have you know Pastor
[23:53] may still have had no idea why he added
[23:56] this in his sermon you know but thanks
[23:58] be to God the battle in that other
[23:59] dimension was one and and that Victory
[24:03] is already won because God has ordained
[24:06] even if you don't make it to church that
[24:08] day somehow some way he's going to shed
[24:10] light on that situation he's going to
[24:11] Prevail we do have to fight we do have
[24:13] to set things in order but God will
[24:15] prevail every
[24:16] time and it doesn't matter what the
[24:19] enemy says you know that you know that
[24:20] you know that the Holy Ghost revealed
[24:22] this thing to you that's what Revelation
[24:25] is you know that you know that you know
[24:26] it doesn't matter what anybody says now
[24:28] there's something seated in your heart
[24:30] that you have this thing here and nobody
[24:33] would ever be able to move that from you
[24:35] you know coming back to just earlier
[24:37] what I was talking about in my statement
[24:38] I had one of those times you know it
[24:40] wasn't specifically in a service but the
[24:42] Lord had revealed something to me and it
[24:45] had been a burden on my heart and it was
[24:47] lifted amen and that weight that I had
[24:49] been carrying I felt like Hannah there I
[24:51] was carrying this weight and and I had
[24:53] been carrying a need and the Lord had
[24:55] resolved it God does those things he
[24:57] does those things in your life and you
[24:59] know maybe sometimes the the whole world
[25:00] might not know about it because it's
[25:02] something between you and God and but
[25:03] the Lord resolves those things because
[25:05] he cares he cares about those
[25:08] things and he had resolved it and I had
[25:12] sat there and I was I was so
[25:15] disappointed in my reaction on the
[25:17] situation that he had done this thing
[25:19] for me and I read this this story here
[25:22] about Simeon and how the Lord had done
[25:24] something so miraculous in his life he
[25:25] had been able to see the Sal a of God
[25:28] and this baby and you know I maybe
[25:30] uttered three words in my heart thank
[25:32] you Lord for doing this how many times
[25:34] in our lives have we come to this place
[25:36] where the Lord has set these events in
[25:38] order and done all these miraculous
[25:39] things and and and fought so hard in the
[25:41] spiritual realm and then we say maybe
[25:43] three words thank you Lord how many
[25:46] times has that happened I felt so
[25:47] convicted in my heart I felt
[25:50] selfish you know and maybe those three
[25:53] words in my heart it may have seemed
[25:55] worse to say those three words than to
[25:57] say anything at
[25:58] all has anybody else ever been guilty of
[26:01] that amen you know and as Believers
[26:03] these types of situations actually
[26:05] happen frequently in our life and the
[26:07] devil fights us harder than anybody else
[26:10] because he knows that once we get the
[26:12] revelation we become an invincible
[26:16] Army my burden for this morning was was
[26:18] the attitude that they took when God did
[26:20] something in their lives Simeon
[26:22] patiently waited for the Holy Spirit to
[26:24] do this in his life and then when the
[26:26] promise was manifested his heart leaped
[26:28] for joy and his reaction became Lord I
[26:31] may now depart in peace he didn't try to
[26:35] take the promise further take to the
[26:37] next step and you know to see how the
[26:39] scripture was going to be fulfilled
[26:40] later down the road he wasn't selfish
[26:42] about just seeing Jesus as a baby he was
[26:44] overwhelmed with happiness and
[26:46] gratefulness that the Lord granted him
[26:48] the
[26:49] opportunity to see the salvation of the
[26:53] Lord Hannah's Prayer became and we
[26:56] didn't it was a lengthy reading so I
[26:57] skipped through it but in in in 1st
[26:59] Samuel the 2 chapter and Hannah prayed
[27:02] and said my heart rejoiceth in the Lord
[27:04] my horn is exalted in the Lord my mouth
[27:07] is enlarged over my enemies because I
[27:10] rejoice in thy salvation what a what a
[27:13] what is our reaction when the Lord does
[27:15] something in our lives no matter how
[27:17] great no matter how small you know we we
[27:19] classify things as humans you know this
[27:21] is great this is small God there there's
[27:23] no scale to God Amen like that he
[27:26] everything is big in his book
[27:30] amen what is your reaction to the Lord
[27:33] moving in in your life do we have a
[27:36] selfish attitude like that like I did do
[27:39] we have those kind of selfish things
[27:41] where you know the Lord did so many
[27:42] mighty things just to get you where you
[27:45] need to be and did we utter more than
[27:48] three words of thank you
[27:50] Lord we also can let ourselves get to a
[27:53] point where maybe you know we feel so
[27:56] revelated that the Lord is here to speak
[27:58] to you in those little simple small
[27:59] things what we might classify in our
[28:01] head as small things but it's God in
[28:05] Simplicity working amen he works in
[28:07] those things amen and we can find
[28:09] ourselves stumbling at the Simplicity of
[28:11] things because that's another way the
[28:13] devil fights Amen brother ROM says you
[28:15] know if Revelation is beyond you look up
[28:17] and see God for it that is the only way
[28:19] you are ever going to get it Church age
[28:22] book a revelation has to come from God
[28:24] it can never come by human natural
[28:26] endowment but by spiritual enduement you
[28:29] can even memorize the scripture and
[28:31] though that is wonderful that won't do
[28:33] it it has to be a revelation from God it
[28:36] says in the word that no man can say
[28:38] that Jesus is the Christ except by the
[28:41] Holy Ghost you have to receive the Holy
[28:43] Ghost and then and only then can the
[28:45] spirit give you the Revelation that
[28:47] Jesus is the Christ God the anointed one
[28:50] now you read that with a human mind and
[28:52] you say well many people say Jesus is
[28:55] the Christ but by saying that Jesus is
[28:57] the Christ meaning you believe it
[28:59] meaning that you act upon it meaning
[29:01] that the holy spirit sets it in order
[29:03] that you take every single word of the
[29:05] Bible many say that Jesus is the Christ
[29:08] but they'll come at that time and say
[29:09] and the Lord will say I never even knew
[29:11] you depart from me you workers of
[29:12] iniquity because you didn't know me by
[29:14] Revelation you sought me by a word but
[29:17] you never had the
[29:19] Revelation no man knows the things of
[29:21] God save the spirit of God and He To
[29:23] Whom the spirit of God reveals them
[29:25] brother renom says this church age book
[29:27] The first one I recommend highly you go
[29:29] read the first the chapter of the church
[29:31] age book it's important we need to call
[29:33] on God for Revelation more than anything
[29:37] else in the world we need to call on God
[29:41] for Revelation more than anything else
[29:44] in the world we have accepted the Bible
[29:46] we have accepted the great great truths
[29:48] of it but it is still not real to most
[29:51] people listen to the statement it is
[29:52] still not real to most people because
[29:55] the Revelation by the spirit is not
[29:57] there my goodness we ought to call for
[30:00] Revelation brother random says you can
[30:02] accept the Bible it says you can accept
[30:04] the great truths of it but it can still
[30:07] not be real to you because the
[30:09] revelation of the spirit isn't
[30:11] there you know and as you begin to pray
[30:14] for Revelation be specific with your
[30:17] requests ask big things James 4:2 says
[30:20] you have not because you ask
[30:23] not John 15 says to ask big things from
[30:26] God because Ephesians 3:20 says that he
[30:29] is able to do more exceedingly
[30:32] abundantly all that we can ask or think
[30:35] according to the power that works in us
[30:37] and he is willing to exceedingly
[30:40] abundantly take whatever request you
[30:41] have and move it to the next level I
[30:43] love Hannah prayed for a child God
[30:45] granted her that child she gave that
[30:47] child back to him and then because
[30:49] there's an extra blessing in in
[30:50] Remembering your promise to God she
[30:53] Grant he granted her more children he
[30:55] granted her that extra blessing having a
[30:56] prophet as a child and then he granted
[30:58] her more children he went exceedingly
[31:00] abundantly more than she even asked or
[31:02] thought he's willing to do that with
[31:04] your
[31:05] requests he was so pleased with her
[31:09] reaction to it and keeping her vow glory
[31:13] to God we have to be willing as Simeon
[31:18] was willing to be led by the spirit you
[31:21] know sometimes the leading of the spirit
[31:23] isn't cut and dry sometimes you question
[31:26] yourself the whole way amen that happens
[31:29] but you know that something is leading
[31:31] you that deep calling is leading you to
[31:34] something amen as long as you line it up
[31:37] with God's
[31:38] word and then you keep moving forward in
[31:41] it God will be faithful amen every time
[31:45] because he's faithful and he will speak
[31:47] amen and when he does speak let's give
[31:50] him a praise offering like Hannah did
[31:53] like Simeon did thanks be to God lord
[31:55] you moved in my life although many of
[31:57] the world thinks this is a small thing
[31:59] Lord I know you care about the small
[32:01] things I know you care about the little
[32:03] things in my life because you answered
[32:06] my prayer I didn't even verbally speak
[32:08] it the spirit made utterance and it
[32:10] groaned utterance and then you came down
[32:12] you revelated me Lord you gave me
[32:14] something that now can never be taken
[32:17] away I know you did that for me because
[32:19] I didn't even speak it the spirit
[32:20] uttered
[32:22] it then when we get to that
[32:26] situation how many times you know can we
[32:30] sacrifice something like Hannah did
[32:32] sometimes we we sacrifice things because
[32:34] we have a need from God you know we'll
[32:36] fast when we have a burden on our heart
[32:38] you know we'll give up something for a
[32:40] week so we can cleanse our minds from
[32:41] distractions or things but have you ever
[32:43] sacrificed something after the Lord has
[32:46] answered your prayer amen what about
[32:48] giving something up as a thanks offering
[32:50] to him thank you Lord for doing this in
[32:53] my life you know I'm just G to I'm maybe
[32:54] I'm just going to give something up just
[32:56] because I love you I'm just going to I'm
[32:57] just going to fast just because I I care
[32:59] about you just because you spoke to me
[33:01] and
