========================================

horrified that here's their young son is trying to marry this Philistine girl and the you know and as The Story Goes he goes he marries her and then at the at the wedding he has this there's the uh he has this riddle right because on the way to to get her he um kills this lion he has this riddle and there's a oh he makes a bet with all these the guys at the wedding and um uh they went that they they couldn't figure out his riddle and then he goes and um they couldn't figure it out so they went to his newlywed her to tell her the answer to the riddle so they can win the bet and he realizes that's what happens when they come and tell him to answer the riddle and so then he gets all mad and he says well if you hadn't been you know talking to my wife then you never would have figured it out and so then he leaves for like a year and then he comes back later and she's married off of somebody else and then he's asked her dad what's why did you marry my wife off and he says well I thought you hated her because she gave away your riddle right because I mean and it sounds like well who cares about a riddle well it was because there was a lot of money involved right usually that's why people that's usually why people get upset about that kind of stuff and so and so then his his marriage blows up and now she's married to somebody else and he he gets all upset and he goes and burns down a bunch of uh Philistine Fields goes in and sets all their crops on fire it's like this is a kind of a crazy story of a guy who's mad about his marriage going south and so as to burn everyone's crops down well it's because the Lord had sought an occasion against the Philistines yeah right so it's like you know from the outside perspective you you see this guy who's has this crazy almost like a psychotic break and and goes on a rampage and it's well it's because and it's all stemming from the fact that he was getting involved in a relationship that he shouldn't have got involved with in the first place but what he didn't realize and what nobody really realized is that the Lord was orchestrating that because he knew down the road that if Samson got involved in this in this relationship that was going to go bad it would cause him to become a deliverer for the people right it would start to to break the bondage of the Philistines on the people and I see this as so many times in in our lives the you know we'll go through stuff especially you know maybe before you're a Christian you have different things that you struggled with and the Lord delivers you for delivers you from it or maybe maybe just throughout your Christian experience you have all these things that maybe you should have known better maybe you you know and it feels like the Lord lets you go do stuff that you really shouldn't have done you know I mean the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord so does that mean that that's not true when you're walking off into some bear trap you know when when the you know it's it's funny there's the I saw a I was a comic strip one time and it's a guy and he's walking around going look he looks at a bear trap and he's like I can't believe Bears get get you know don't see this trap and he sees a mousetrap and says you know I can't believe that uh uh you know people wouldn't people wouldn't your mouse wouldn't notice that this is a trap and then you know it's you know some some whatever it is whatever you know some money scam or whatever obvious scam that he gets involved in how could I have known it's like well yeah it's because you know it's it's a trap that so A lot of times we'll walk right into the Trap Of The Devil and the Lord will let us do it and you get hung up and you get a bunch of you in it with a bunch of scars because of it and the Lord let you do it and the reason is because he had an occasion against the devil he knew that in a year's time you're now going to have the motivation to pray about something that you wouldn't have had before when you when somebody else comes along who walked into the same trap you can now properly enter into the feeling of their infirmity because you have an occasion against the devil right I know throughout my life I've you know had various struggles various hardships things that I didn't understand how it was you know you know especially when you're a new Christian you think man Lord why did I have to go through that why did I have to struggle with all these issues you know well it's because now when when I have people that I care about or just anybody that you know they come to me saying that they have the same issue well for me it's not I have an occasion against that particular devil right I don't feel like you know especially when I was a teenager I had severe issues with anxiety and depression and I I dealt with that all the way up until when I got saved and you know for thankfully the Lord has really helped me with that but you know when I you know somebody asked me to to pray for them if they have anxiety or depression it's not like it's not like a for me it's not it's not just a prayer right it's not it's not a normal fight it's a grudge match right like I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna pray for that person in a way that has some earnestness behind it because that's close to my heart right right I can really enter in and and really be be dedicated to that and so a lot of times you know we deal with stuff that's really heavy and it hurts and we struggle with it well maybe it's because when somebody else comes along because you want the same problem the Lord needs someone to to be there and as you know I I think of um of Peter let me pull my scripture I wanted to read um let's turn to uh mark 14. let's see here um we're gonna go Mark 14 and verse 27. um yeah and it says here and Jesus saith unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written I will Smite the shepherd and the Sheep shall be scattered but after that I am risen I will go before you unto Galilee but Peter said unto him although all shall be offended yet will not I and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto you that this day even in this night before the Crow twice Thou shalt deny me Thrice but he spake the more vehemently if I should die with thee I will not deny thee in any wise likewise likewise also said they all okay I want to skip down to verse 66. um yeah and uh and as Peter was beneath in the place there cometh one of the maids of the high priest and when she saw Peter warming himself she looked upon him and said uh and that all also was with Jesus of Nazareth and he denied saying I know not neither understand what thou sayest and he went out into the porch and the caught crew and a maid saw him again and uh and began to say to them that stood by this is one of them and he denied it again and a little after they that stood by said again to Peter Shirley Thou Art one of them for thou art of Galilean and thy speech betrayeth a speech agreeth that they're too but he began to curse and to swear saying I know not this man of whom you speak and the second time the crew and Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him before the crowed twice thou shall deny me Thrice and when he thought thereon he wept so here we have this event in Peter's life that I mean it's in about every gospel you've got to imagine this is something that's on Peter's heart real heavy you know this is something where here's Peter who is so you know so uh you know aggressive maybe that he was so bold and I'll I'll Stand I'll I'll go to the Grave with Christ I'll never turn my back on him willing to fight try to cut off a man's head when they came to arrest Jesus oh he's you know he's he's he's uh so um like just out there he's he's aggressive he's he's uh he's not going to back down zealous that's the word right up until he's in a situation where it's rubber meets the road and suddenly he's a coward yeah suddenly he's uh can't can't really be identified with Jesus right can't really can't really do what he thought that he could and now he's confronted with this thing confronted with the fact that he wasn't really who he thought he was and you know the the the religion that he thought he had didn't really hold and now he's he ends up he ends up you know failing miserably and and making an absolute I mean it's it's it's uh you know he's broken-hearted about it but then you know the Lord come you know on I I read this story and I and I I can't help but think that maybe because of this story without this event in Peter's life without this event where he was faced with you know standing up for for for the Lord and being identified with the Lord no matter the consequences and he fails and he fails to to be identified and he becomes ashamed of of the Lord without that event in his life you don't get Acts chapter 2. right you don't get the boldness that he has when the Holy Ghost comes in because now he's it's like the the the the Lord allowed him to have this this major event this major failing that he would become ashamed of so that when he's full of the Holy Ghost he's never going to allow that to happen again he's now got you know that's why he's going to stand there boldly on the day of Pentecost and and preach and and not back down and that everywhere he's gonna go he's never gonna slow down he's never gonna he's never gonna he's never gonna back down ever again because he did it once and he really didn't like it you know he didn't like how that ended up because you know the the the Lord sought occasion against the devil he sought on occasion there was he wanted there were so many things that Peter was going to have to come against that the Lord needed him to be uh Valiant he needed to be to be zealous he needed him to be on fire and so he was going to allow him to fail miserably to give him that motivation right to go to go set the devil's fields on fire yes you know and so so many times don't don't let don't let the devil tell you that your failures and your faults and these things that come upon you that you know when you you know it's not I'm not trying to you know make it an excuse to to fail what I'm saying is don't allow your failures to be let the devil keep you down use that you know if you as you know it's it's like when you're when you're training to be a fighter you know what you do is you you spar with people and you get beat up and they and you lose a lot you know if you're if you're training Jiu Jitsu right when you first start out Brazilian Jiu Jitsu first thing you do when you start out is lose all the time like you the the the trainer is going to just beat the snot out of you and there's nothing you can do about it and no matter how angry you get no matter how upset you get he's just gonna tie you into a pretzel again and you can be mad at him but that doesn't change the fact that you're in a you're a pretzel like it's and so but the the difference I I heard a a black belt he was a a martial arts instructor he said you know people because you have you have the different colors right represent how high how skilled you are as a you know they're different colored belts represent how skilled you are as a in that particular martial art and they said that the hardest uh I believe I think it's the the the the blue belt is the first one after what well white is the first one but then after that is the yellow okay anyways they said the the P I've heard that he said I've heard it said that people say the yellow belt is the hardest one to get because nobody nobody sticks it out people get their white belt and start training and then they get tired of it they're tired they get tired of losing so they quit and they don't recognize that no every time you lose every time you fail every time the instructor breaks you down is the opportunity to recognize that you could be better to recognize well where did I fail where did I fail what did I do wrong how can I be better be perseverant be be undaunted don't give up right don't when you're when you're you know when you the the problem the problem what the devil is trying to do is not get you to the devil doesn't care if you win or lose the devil cares if you don't get back up right it's the um during the second world war the um British very famously dropped a lot of um propaganda pamphlets on the Italians when they're trying to take the Italian Peninsula because the Italians World dug up in the mountains up in up in Northern Italy they couldn't get them out and the British flew planes over the the Italian entrenchments and dumped propaganda pamphlets basically it taught the it had instructions on how to fake an illness and a bunch of like propaganda about you know like basically like making them question why they why they were fighting the war and the idea was and the question is when I heard this wait a minute the British flew planes over the British or over the Italian lines and dropped propaganda they dropped pamphlets on them why don't they just drop bombs right it was the same planes it was the same wrist they burnt the same fuel they put the same pilots and aircraft in danger being shot down why didn't they just drop bombs on them and the reality was they got more Italian troops to Desert and become disheartened and leave and and leave the battlefield on their own then they could have killed with the bombs they were too dug in and the devil a lot of times he know he can't beat you all he can do is get you to give up and quit that's you're not he can't he can't really beat you the the problem isn't you know with too many times where we get so complacent we get so bogged down we we have some failure and some mistake that we keep falling in and and say oh well I'm just going to give up and be complacent now and I'm not I'm going to stop fighting on that point well okay but now the devil's got you licked the problem isn't when you fail the problem is that you didn't get back up and keep trying the problem you know you have some issue that you keep running into well be analytical be stop and ask ask yourself why did I fail here well maybe there's a coin maybe there's a common denominator that every time you go to a certain place or do a certain thing or or whatever it is you're gonna that's where the devil knows you're weak and so he's going to hit you there and so what what we need to do is we need to stop letting the devil convince us that this is the end and instead recognize that what this is an opportunity to let the Lord fight with you what this is an opportunity is that the maybe what's going on here is that the Lord has an occasion against this issue in your life maybe this is that the Lord has the Lord is trying to do something here and instead of being disheartened and instead of being despondent what we need to do is is fight even harder right go on a rampage go go fight back as hard as you can and even if you fail again you get back up and keep swinging right Samson the Lord had occasion against against the Philistines all of Samson's life and he kept on getting hung up with Philistine women for the rest of his life all the way up until he tore their Temple down and killed more of them in his death than in his life you know the the the you know again it's not a it's not to say that this is okay that we fail it's to say don't let it discourage you and don't let it don't let it dissuade you from fighting every time Samson failed it was every time Samson got hung up with some Philistine woman was the the Capstone of that was that he turned around and fought on the Lord side and destroyed Philistines right no matter who it was right this this Philistine he gets married to this Philistine woman he goes and burns her crops down he gets hung up with a prostitute in Giza he rips the gates off their City you know he ends up getting uh mixed up with Delilah and goes in in the end of it pushes the temple over right when he dies the the the the the the the the moral of the story here is again to not let ourselves be despondent I um I just got a couple minutes left and I I had something I was thinking about um you know it it occurred to me that you know in uh I don't have time to read it because I just literally have a couple minutes left but it's in First Corinthians 6 Paul says that you know that he says no you're not that you we will judge Angels right and we'll judge the world and angels well we there's going to come a day when the bride of Christ is going to sit on the throne right and judge the world the great white Throne judgment and maybe the reason why God allows his family to go through some of these things and have failures and faults and and different issues is because everybody deserves a jury of their peers right how it's one thing for the people of the world to come before the great white Throne judgment and be judged by A Perfect God who never did anything wrong it's another thing to be judged by a bunch of people who absolutely did things wrong who were just as bad as everyone who comes before that throne and yet we're still saved anyways because they saw they they took the atonement when they had the opportunity there was a very famously um the Nuremberg trials when all the Nazi war criminals were were tried for the things that they had done there was a judge who before though the war broke out and the Nazis were taking coming to power they were making all the judges sort of give bad judgments so they could lock up the the opponents to the Nazi party and he said he wouldn't do it he he wouldn't go along with it and they threatened him threatened his family they threatened his life so he packed up and fled and went to America and basically lived in poverty they lived on the streets because they didn't have anywhere to go um German law isn't exactly a transferable skill to the United States and um after the war he goes back to Germany and they're looking for judges to preside over the over the trials and he was one of the judges that they picked because they said who better to judge these people than the people who didn't take the bribes who didn't go along with the agenda and so when all these people would come before me says well we had to do it they threatened our family said yeah they did they threatened my family too but I didn't go along with it I I wasn't willing to go down that path and I think maybe that's what that's why we go through some of these things because the Lord has occasion against particular Devils but on the day of judgment when when justices served finally there's going to be people there who are are are the living evidence of why these angels must be punished the way that they are right there's a it's you know we we are the testimony that will convict the people who didn't take the atonement you know your life your life is the testimony that will convict the devil and the angels and all the world that follows them right so it's uh that's where we gotta quit so we'll stand and have a word of prayer and we'll be dismissed foreign Lord I Thank you for this opportunity to say a few words that maybe would encourage somebody to press on and and take the fight to the devil lord and be encouraged Lord I consider it an honor that I'll be able to maybe encourage someone so Lord I asked that you wouldn't you would make it so that the people would not think that would be my words that they would recognize that that these are your words and that you would be able to that you would be the one speaking to them not me that I I couldn't I couldn't help anyone Lord so I asked you would Bless the people bless the service the coming service Lord you'd be in our worship that you would come down and dwell with us and speak to our hearts we ask these things in Jesus name amen foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music]
