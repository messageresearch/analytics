[1:24:38] for the preacher or for the
[1:24:41] singers we're not here to cause trouble
[1:24:44] either amen or to cause
[1:24:46] confusion we're here to focus on the
[1:24:49] Lord Jesus and we greet each one of you
[1:24:52] and we welcome you recognizing that each
[1:24:55] one of you are very
[1:24:56] special and each one of you are very
[1:24:59] unique and you're
[1:25:00] different and you're
[1:25:02] odd all of all of us are in fact we have
[1:25:07] several hundred here tonight but we're
[1:25:08] still a
[1:25:09] minority so stop being a victim the rest
[1:25:12] of your life and just accept it you're a
[1:25:14] minority all right but we're going to
[1:25:17] heaven and we're going in the
[1:25:20] Rapture Hallelujah
[1:25:26] now uh this is a youth meeting and we're
[1:25:30] focusing on that I don't want you to
[1:25:32] worry about anything or be nervous about
[1:25:35] anything God's got it all in
[1:25:38] control we're Sons and Daughters of God
[1:25:41] and all of us are on a
[1:25:45] journey and we're at different stages of
[1:25:47] growth and
[1:25:49] experience and we respect one another
[1:25:52] and we do have patience for each one of
[1:25:56] you and we're willing to wait and linger
[1:26:00] and let God go down a pathway and leave
[1:26:03] the rest of us just for
[1:26:07] you so I'm not into meetings where we
[1:26:10] just focus on the services I'm brother
[1:26:13] John is more concerned about next Monday
[1:26:16] and your Tuesday and next Wednesday then
[1:26:20] I am just this this meeting tonight or
[1:26:23] tomorrow's meeting I'm more concerned
[1:26:25] about what you take home with you and
[1:26:27] your personal Walk With
[1:26:30] Jesus is that okay whatever you have
[1:26:34] need of I think our pastors already said
[1:26:36] that brother Jason whatever you have
[1:26:38] need of is in Jesus so I encourage you
[1:26:41] to
[1:26:43] surrender right while you're in your
[1:26:45] chair just yield yes amen just be
[1:26:49] sensitive to those around found you how
[1:26:53] many believe we're living in another
[1:26:55] book of
[1:26:56] Acts in the book of
[1:27:00] Acts people were being healed just in
[1:27:03] the shadow of someone
[1:27:05] else the the the people that really had
[1:27:08] the Holy Ghost were just walking and
[1:27:10] living their lives and just their shadow
[1:27:12] people were being
[1:27:14] healed so if you just want to wave your
[1:27:17] hand or just be a believer maybe don't
[1:27:19] make a lot of noise but just your shadow
[1:27:22] could heal someone cause Deliverance for
[1:27:25] somebody a whole section could just be
[1:27:27] filled with the Holy Ghost while they
[1:27:29] hear the word so if we are in another
[1:27:31] book of Acts don't put it all behind the
[1:27:34] pulpit please that's not where the focus
[1:27:37] is the focus is on you we're here for
[1:27:40] you this weekend is that okay so be
[1:27:42] listening for a personal word from the
[1:27:47] Lord and U be conscious that God is
[1:27:50] dealing with others and we're a body and
[1:27:53] we move
[1:27:54] together and so these are some of the
[1:27:57] greatest times of your
[1:28:00] life and this year 2021 has been a very
[1:28:04] Sovereign and Supernatural
[1:28:07] year and I don't know what would attract
[1:28:12] uh young people and people from over 20
[1:28:14] churches to meetings other than the Holy
[1:28:17] Ghost other than God has called us
[1:28:20] together and I have seen it in other
[1:28:22] states and other churches and other
[1:28:24] moves of God where God is moving very
[1:28:27] sovereignly get caught up in the
[1:28:30] wave the virus they call another wave
[1:28:33] another wave another wave well it's time
[1:28:36] for us all to get caught up in the
[1:28:38] Rapture
[1:28:39] wave and we don't want to be Revival
[1:28:41] Surfers where we're just surfing and
[1:28:44] just looking for the next you know youth
[1:28:46] meeting but we want to be young people
[1:28:48] and Believers that are are being filled
[1:28:51] and being possessed and have something
[1:28:53] of substance that we uh you know God
[1:28:56] pre-plans everything and he pre-arranged
[1:29:00] everything so there's opportunities for
[1:29:02] us to draw closer to him this weekend
[1:29:05] and to one another amen and so uh I
[1:29:09] don't want to be negative but making fun
[1:29:11] of others will not be tolerated amen
[1:29:15] being a bully is
[1:29:17] sin so we don't I I believe it's okay to
[1:29:20] say this we we don't stand for arrogance
[1:29:24] and you know people being uh full of
[1:29:26] Pride and selfishness let's just cast
[1:29:28] that in the trash can you know this is
[1:29:31] like a hospital all right so this is a
[1:29:34] place of healing so if you have no need
[1:29:36] of a physician then you wouldn't go to
[1:29:38] the hospital you just drive on by and
[1:29:40] you never go there till there's a need
[1:29:44] so we're here because there's needs and
[1:29:46] we're willing to put our name out there
[1:29:48] and put our face out there and be
[1:29:51] vulnerable to one another am and you
[1:29:54] don't have to be
[1:29:56] embarrassed we're all trying to find
[1:30:00] ourselves none of us have it all
[1:30:04] together and none of us know it
[1:30:08] all I actually wrote these notes down
[1:30:11] can you believe that
[1:30:13] Hallelujah none of us are better or
[1:30:15] higher than anybody
[1:30:18] else we're all in need so willing to be
[1:30:22] open and be
[1:30:23] vulnerable and even this weekend that
[1:30:26] we're here brother John is a middle-aged
[1:30:29] person 49 years old but my wife is
[1:30:32] beautiful she makes up for that and
[1:30:34] she's back there in the back by uh
[1:30:37] sister Jean God bless you Sister
[1:30:40] Jean we were born and raised in the
[1:30:43] message so when you hear us speak it's
[1:30:46] it's coming from another
[1:30:48] perspective it's coming from someone
[1:30:50] that was raised with a father and a a
[1:30:52] mother that believe this message we're
[1:30:54] raised at the brandham Tabernacle for 16
[1:30:57] years of our life we're not ashamed of
[1:30:59] our Prophet William brandham and so when
[1:31:02] we Minister I just wanted to give this
[1:31:04] as a
[1:31:05] foundation um we're ministering from
[1:31:08] from an experience of I always remember
[1:31:11] brother Jason and he remembers too our
[1:31:14] family back in the Tabernacle and I
[1:31:16] wonder what it what it was like to be a
[1:31:18] teenager growing up then but I wonder
[1:31:21] what it's like to be a teenager or a
[1:31:23] young adult growing up now and you have
[1:31:25] it 10 times worse than we ever did and
[1:31:28] brother Jason and I are middle age now
[1:31:31] now we have
[1:31:32] grandchildren and so they have it 10
[1:31:34] times more than our children that's
[1:31:36] right and I have three children and
[1:31:38] three grandchildren and so we just want
[1:31:40] the Lord to minister to us I think the
[1:31:43] brothers can you bring up our first
[1:31:44] slide I want to show this quote before
[1:31:46] we turn to the uh Book of Joel if you
[1:31:49] want to start turning to the Book of
[1:31:51] Joel
[1:31:52] but we're going to read this quote on
[1:31:53] the
[1:31:57] screen I think you'll be able to bring
[1:31:59] that
[1:32:02] up so if I can have your attention let's
[1:32:05] let's look at this
[1:32:07] together this is our title tonight
[1:32:09] restored
[1:32:12] youth I guess I don't have your
[1:32:14] attention you're turning to the Book of
[1:32:15] Joel it's in the Old Testament back
[1:32:19] there okay let's read this
[1:32:22] an INT seed sign welcome brother Matthew
[1:32:26] come on back brother everybody's
[1:32:27] watching
[1:32:30] you when we see God heal a man a few
[1:32:35] days ago in our church he's speaking
[1:32:37] this in Georgia they brought a little
[1:32:39] girl in there on a stretcher he's
[1:32:41] talking about his home Church in brandom
[1:32:44] Tabernacle they called me into in the
[1:32:47] night time on the road and said the girl
[1:32:49] cannot live the cancer was so bad dad
[1:32:52] about 17 years old she can't even get
[1:32:57] there it was a pitiful case a lovely
[1:33:00] little child of 17 years old but to
[1:33:04] prove something to my church I never
[1:33:06] touched the girl at all I never as much
[1:33:10] as touched her I walked in she was
[1:33:12] laying on a stretcher of course there
[1:33:14] were other sick people but I was
[1:33:16] concerned about the child to catch her
[1:33:19] spirit when I spoke to her she seemed
[1:33:22] like a very fine little girl I could see
[1:33:25] no reason why that child should fill a
[1:33:27] premature grave and that has to be the
[1:33:31] devil trying to take her
[1:33:34] life so I never touched the child at
[1:33:37] all went right to the pulpit with the
[1:33:39] word and stayed right with the
[1:33:42] word and the word healed her so
[1:33:47] instantly until she got up and walked
[1:33:50] away is all right now now living like
[1:33:53] anybody else and can't find a trace of
[1:33:55] it anywhere never even touched
[1:33:58] her now remember what he said there I'm
[1:34:02] sorry I just blanked the
[1:34:05] screen I was
[1:34:10] trying to prove something to my church
[1:34:13] to prove something to my church I never
[1:34:15] touched the child at all and then the
[1:34:18] last part I never even touched her see
[1:34:21] the word went forth this is our last
[1:34:24] quote before we read the scripture the
[1:34:26] word went forth and she believed the
[1:34:29] word and the word is God's life and
[1:34:32] God's power and the word is what does it
[1:34:36] the word heals the sick then you say
[1:34:39] well Jesus healed the sick he is the
[1:34:41] word he is the word when you receive the
[1:34:45] word you receive Jesus for he is the
[1:34:47] word then he quotes the scripture the
[1:34:49] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:34:52] we believe that don't we how many
[1:34:54] believe the word tonight we believe that
[1:34:56] Christ is God's word made manifest we
[1:35:00] believe that his bride must be the same
[1:35:02] thing we believe that she must believe
[1:35:06] every bit of the word and have that word
[1:35:08] in her because she is part of the body
[1:35:11] she is the body where he is the head so
[1:35:15] you are part of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:35:18] then we're going to approach you like
[1:35:20] that we're going to speak to you like
[1:35:21] that I believe that's wonderful we're
[1:35:24] Sons and Daughters of god so let's stand
[1:35:27] to our feet tonight and if you Brothers
[1:35:29] want to put the scripture up that's fine
[1:35:37] Joel chapter
[1:35:40] 2 verse
[1:35:42] 23 did you find that
[1:35:45] okay the Lord laid this on our hearts
[1:35:47] for tonight

[1:45:44] about this I will restore as it just
[1:45:46] came to me some days ago of restoration
[1:45:51] and I will
[1:45:53] restore I still got the original piece
[1:45:55] of paper that I wrote on I will
[1:45:59] restore who's saying this it's it's God
[1:46:03] it's the Lord and he has never lied
[1:46:06] that's right so I will
[1:46:09] restore to you the years that the Locust
[1:46:12] hath eaten the cankerworm the
[1:46:15] caterpillar the pommer worm this great
[1:46:17] Army which was sent out you years is a
[1:46:21] division of time or a measure of time it
[1:46:24] it's indicating part of an age or it
[1:46:27] could be even a
[1:46:29] lifetime years of life God is saying to
[1:46:34] the situation that he's there to
[1:46:38] restore I will
[1:46:41] restore even if it's a lifetime of
[1:46:44] issues even if it's things going on in
[1:46:46] your life but it's in the time in a
[1:46:49] measure of time this is our time this is
[1:46:52] our
[1:46:53] season because as a as a restored uh
[1:46:57] youth it's going to be changed at any
[1:46:59] moment this is all that we've got right
[1:47:01] now is time but eternity is blending in
[1:47:04] with
[1:47:06] time so anything in your
[1:47:09] life that's out of cater out of line in
[1:47:14] disarray the promise of God is I will
[1:47:17] restore to
[1:47:19] you say it just happened in a this like
[1:47:22] this or just became like a season of my
[1:47:25] life but this could have been going on
[1:47:26] for years God's able to restore you and
[1:47:31] I'm going to get into some pictures in a
[1:47:32] few minutes of scars you know all of us
[1:47:35] have gone through things in our lives
[1:47:37] even you as young people there's scars
[1:47:39] and we know about scars that we bear but
[1:47:42] I will restore as a promise to us as
[1:47:46] young people we've been given a message
[1:47:49] and given a word word and thus sayith
[1:47:52] the Lord that I I'm going to labor on
[1:47:54] this till we get it I will restore it
[1:47:58] he's here to restore you back to your
[1:48:01] right mind back to your senses your
[1:48:04] spiritual senses of who you really are
[1:48:08] God's going to break every chain and
[1:48:10] break every yoke and break every spirit
[1:48:13] that is haunted you and demonized you
[1:48:18] you're not a
[1:48:19] victim you're Rising you're coming out
[1:48:22] of that Hallelujah if I'm speaking above
[1:48:26] your head just reach up and grab it like
[1:48:28] an allar just reach up and grab it I'm
[1:48:31] throwing a ladder down into the pit to
[1:48:34] say we're with you but we're we're
[1:48:35] coming out of here I will restore
[1:48:39] there's got to be brothers and sisters
[1:48:41] that's been there already that knows
[1:48:43] there's power there's strength there's
[1:48:46] keeping power I'm speaking to you
[1:48:48] tonight from experience
[1:48:51] hallelujah we're not here to talk about
[1:48:53] a message we're here to get in under the
[1:48:56] token and apply it that's a quote of
[1:49:00] brother Brandon By the way we're not
[1:49:01] here to talk about the message we're
[1:49:04] here to apply the token apply the blood
[1:49:08] because the death angel is in the
[1:49:12] land sir death is in the land and it
[1:49:16] wants to destroy you and take you down
[1:49:19] it's taking down Elders it's taken down
[1:49:22] older people it's taken down people
[1:49:24] that's been preachers and song leaders
[1:49:27] and deacons and trustees but he focus is
[1:49:29] on the young people brother John has
[1:49:32] seen it even in the last 15 months and
[1:49:34] this is a youth meeting by the way so
[1:49:36] I'm going to be addressing it very
[1:49:39] strongly it Satan's intent is to destroy
[1:49:43] the young
[1:49:47] people and we know the virus and
[1:49:49] different things has taken a lot of
[1:49:51] older ones or those with pre-existing
[1:49:53] conditions that's the natural death but
[1:49:56] brother John has seen a spiritual death
[1:49:58] and a death grip even message
[1:50:04] churches and and he he puts a choke hold
[1:50:07] on the young people on the
[1:50:11] children but that's why we have meetings
[1:50:13] like this that the Holy Spirit would
[1:50:16] come TW over 20 churches Here We Are
[1:50:19] Tonight
[1:50:20] you have a little room but tomorrow
[1:50:22] night it's going to be full so just
[1:50:23] breathe a little
[1:50:25] bit Satan's trying to put all of his
[1:50:28] demons on you so you can't
[1:50:31] breathe that's why Jesus speaking to his
[1:50:33] disciples just a few days before he left
[1:50:36] he breathed on them it was a promise
[1:50:39] receive ye the Holy Ghost and just a few
[1:50:42] days later they went up to the day of
[1:50:44] Pentecost and they received
[1:50:47] it so all the years that Satan has
[1:50:50] indicated it's a measure just look at
[1:50:53] your whole life Satan's trying to say
[1:50:55] you're no good you're not going to make
[1:50:57] it in the Rapture you don't have the
[1:50:59] Holy Ghost you'll never measure up and
[1:51:01] here's a promise saying I will restore
[1:51:04] to you the
[1:51:07] years amen so in the next
[1:51:11] slide I guess I thank you Brothers maybe
[1:51:13] that's that's better I just took it out
[1:51:16] of a couple different versions We read
[1:51:18] out of the King James ver version and
[1:51:21] The New International Version in Joel
[1:51:23] 2:25 says I will repay to
[1:51:27] you I will repay you for the years the
[1:51:31] locusts have eaten yes amen he's not
[1:51:35] talking about CIA
[1:51:37] locuses and they Buzz around every 17
[1:51:40] years
[1:51:40] [Music]
[1:51:42] and he's talking about spirits that
[1:51:45] haunt you not just your waking days but
[1:51:48] even in your sleep he'll try to take
[1:51:50] away your sleep and get you to where
[1:51:52] you're so full of nervousness you can't
[1:51:54] sleep that's a demon
[1:51:56] Spirit God God's trying to give you rest
[1:51:59] he's trying to give you
[1:52:01] peace Hallelujah I felt this brother
[1:52:03] Jason and sister Debbie as we spoke last
[1:52:06] night at the table I was almost weeping
[1:52:09] looking across and hearing the testimony
[1:52:12] I thought God if some of our older ones
[1:52:15] can be going through these battles what
[1:52:16] about our young people then we are here
[1:52:19] to fight for
[1:52:23] you we are here to fight for our young
[1:52:26] people to make it every single one of
[1:52:28] them we're here to get out of the way
[1:52:31] and lay down and become vulnerable and
[1:52:33] become like foolishness before you so
[1:52:36] that you would win
[1:52:38] Christ so that a young lady or a young
[1:52:40] man could look beyond the scars and look
[1:52:43] beyond the wounds and Touch the Hem of
[1:52:45] His Garment say there is hope for
[1:52:48] me I will repay or give back to you the
[1:52:52] years that the locusts have
[1:52:55] eaten the great Locust and the young
[1:52:58] Locust the other Locust that
[1:53:00] swarm The New American Standard Version
[1:53:03] says it like this Joel 2:25 then I will
[1:53:07] make up to
[1:53:10] you see I always feel like I'm falling
[1:53:14] short I always feel like that I'm not
[1:53:16] making the grade I you know we can be
[1:53:20] guilty as adults by speaking down all
[1:53:22] the time to our young people or our
[1:53:25] children or our grandchildren or any
[1:53:28] children and we we can almost get a
[1:53:32] condescending attitude I've been there I
[1:53:35] done that we know the quotes we've been
[1:53:38] that's not what young people
[1:53:40] need
[1:53:42] Amen brother brandham said our children
[1:53:45] have it 10 times worse than we
[1:53:48] did so our grandchildren have it I think
[1:53:51] a hundred times then right CU if one
[1:53:53] generation 10 times is it a 100 times
[1:53:56] come
[1:53:57] on so there ought to be no condescending
[1:54:01] and looking down there ought to be Lord
[1:54:03] what can we do for our young people what
[1:54:06] can our grandchildren how can we get out
[1:54:07] of the way you say well we've been there
[1:54:09] we' done that but you haven't been down
[1:54:11] their
[1:54:13] Road I've got to commend all of you God
[1:54:16] has chosen you to be in a generation
[1:54:22] I I was thinking I was going to say I
[1:54:24] don't know how you're doing it or how
[1:54:26] you're making it but I do know it's the
[1:54:27] same strength that we had but we never
[1:54:30] want to get to a place as older ones
[1:54:32] that we're just above everybody I salute
[1:54:36] you Satan is tormenting your mind with
[1:54:40] pressures I never had there were things
[1:54:42] that we were dealing with that it seemed
[1:54:45] like it was 18 or 19 when our minds and
[1:54:48] our emotions were older that an
[1:54:50] 8-year-old deals with now a 9-year-old a
[1:54:53] one-year-old knows how to
[1:54:56] swipe I know what I'm talking about I I
[1:54:58] prayed for a little boy this is years
[1:55:00] ago and he was a little boy he's not
[1:55:02] even one years old and he already
[1:55:04] swiping D and he had a heart problem and
[1:55:06] his parents had him in the hospital and
[1:55:09] he was already learning he knows how to
[1:55:10] swipe push p and friends you know
[1:55:14] incredible if you
[1:55:16] hello you're incredible like yeah if you
[1:55:19] if you want to get something done with
[1:55:21] the electronic just hand it to a young
[1:55:25] person let's move along here Joel is
[1:55:29] saying I will make up to you for the
[1:55:31] years that the swarming locusts have
[1:55:34] eaten sir the creeping Locust the
[1:55:37] stripping Locust and the gnawing Locust
[1:55:41] can we just say any spirit that would
[1:55:43] come against this generation we have
[1:55:46] been given Authority by the word of God
[1:55:48] to say I will
[1:55:50] restore we're looking at it straight in
[1:55:53] the faceall to Satan tonight and saying
[1:55:56] you are coming
[1:55:59] down not the person but a spirit that
[1:56:03] would defy the word of
[1:56:09] God that brother brandham said to prove
[1:56:13] something to my church I never touched
[1:56:15] the child at all so he wasn't interested
[1:56:18] in just doing f Fantastics he wasn't
[1:56:20] being he wasn't personally trying to
[1:56:23] please the pastors or the ministers I'm
[1:56:26] not speaking to them tonight I'm
[1:56:27] speaking to you as young
[1:56:30] people it's God proving his word that
[1:56:34] you can touch God and he can touch you
[1:56:36] right there and no one needs to know
[1:56:39] about the issue but God and he just

[1:58:55] already been accepted in the
[1:59:03] Beloved you know we're not taking any
[1:59:06] vote tonight about the message the
[1:59:09] message is true no matter what you think
[1:59:12] we're just telling the world the message
[1:59:14] is
[1:59:15] true and we don't need 648 likes and
[1:59:18] then 100 downs and oh I believe it no
[1:59:21] God said it I will
[1:59:24] restore it doesn't matter if there's a
[1:59:26] thousand thumbs down by the end of the
[1:59:29] service dislikes we believe the word of
[1:59:32] God
[1:59:39] I so when he said restore that means I'm
[1:59:44] going to give you a covenant of
[1:59:47] Peace probably we ought to preach a
[1:59:49] whole message on this but we only have
[1:59:51] three with you this
[1:59:57] weekend God is giving you
[2:00:01] peace I give it to
[2:00:06] you so if you're battling and
[2:00:10] Waring just receive
[2:00:13] it you know you can get like
[2:00:17] this and God just asking everyone to go
[2:00:20] like
[2:00:21] this just let it
[2:00:24] go I told you I'm going to speak
[2:00:26] personal I'm going to talk
[2:00:29] right it doesn't matter if I get no
[2:00:31] amens no hand claps I'm just going to
[2:00:34] preach the
[2:00:36] word and some of us live like this right
[2:00:40] I'm speaking to your young people we
[2:00:43] just need to go like this we just need
[2:00:46] to let it
[2:00:47] go could be 13 years old tonight that's
[2:00:51] and 16 or 17 or
[2:00:54] 23 or
[2:00:56] 83 but it's a secret Just Let It
[2:01:01] Go amen and your mind can be going in a
[2:01:04] lot of places but God's talking to you
[2:01:07] right
[2:01:07] now and the Holy Spirit is getting your
[2:01:11] attention and it might take a little bit
[2:01:13] of time or half a service or till
[2:01:16] tomorrow night for somebody but just
[2:01:18] keep fighting keep waiting through just
[2:01:20] keep laying aside your feelings and your
[2:01:25] emotion all the years that the Locust
[2:01:28] has tried to crowd in and Claw away at
[2:01:32] your
[2:01:33] integrity and your
[2:01:35] beauty and all the false images that
[2:01:38] Hollywood and Paris has built up in your
[2:01:40] minds to be and Larry Bird said it the
[2:01:43] best one of the all stars at the end he
[2:01:46] just I think he threw the ball against
[2:01:48] the locker and he said is this all there
[2:01:49] is to life is a stinking locker
[2:01:53] room that's one of the
[2:01:55] elite and so it's not King LeBron it's
[2:01:59] not King that it's King
[2:02:01] Jesus it's God changing our mind
[2:02:03] changing our
[2:02:05] whole restoration has to do with God
[2:02:07] putting you at peace so you can receive
[2:02:09] the
[2:02:10] word because you'll become the word as
[2:02:14] you receive the word amen so if there's
[2:02:16] a wall and and there's a reason why you
[2:02:19] can't receive it that's the
[2:02:21] devil that's not the Holy Spirit I
[2:02:25] didn't say you didn't have the Holy
[2:02:26] Spirit I said yield to the holy spirit
[2:02:29] let the Holy Spirit break down all the
[2:02:32] Clutter I tell you tonight we need more
[2:02:35] of God in our lives than
[2:02:37] ever you say well I'm battling whether I
[2:02:40] even have the Holy Ghost tonight why
[2:02:42] don't you just end that right
[2:02:46] now I don't know if you have it or not
[2:02:49] right I really
[2:02:51] don't but God can give you the
[2:02:54] experience and the faith tonight to
[2:02:56] receive
[2:02:57] it every single person in this building
[2:03:00] could receive the Holy Ghost right
[2:03:07] now so it's you just need to stop
[2:03:10] wrestling do I have it did I get it a
[2:03:12] year ago was that really real just stop
[2:03:15] all that nonsense God isn't going to
[2:03:17] come back until you're ready
[2:03:19] to go amen y'all remember what Jesus
[2:03:23] said two in a bed one will be taken one
[2:03:26] be left do y all remember that that's
[2:03:28] the Bible Luke 17 two in a bed stop
[2:03:33] thinking you're always the one that's
[2:03:34] going to be
[2:03:35] left you know I'm the Judas in the
[2:03:37] church I I I'm brother John if you knew
[2:03:40] my private life well God knows about
[2:03:43] your private life and he's still talking
[2:03:45] to you this
[2:03:46] [Applause]
[2:03:47] wayl
[2:03:56] he'll bring a man from Washington State
[2:03:58] which is where I live all the way to
[2:04:01] South Carolina for God to touch your
[2:04:05] heart just in a certain word or a
[2:04:07] certain atmosphere and you just feel
[2:04:11] [Music]
[2:04:13] that some of us just need to learn to
[2:04:16] breathe
[2:04:17] again just look around the room and
[2:04:19] realize
[2:04:21] wow God's put me here for a purpose
[2:04:24] everything's pre-planned brother Jason
[2:04:26] God knew tonight he knew where everyone
[2:04:28] would be
[2:04:30] sitting every person and every mile the
[2:04:33] wheels turned or every however you got
[2:04:36] here God saw you some of you are really
[2:04:39] nervous tonight I understand
[2:04:42] that most of us are nervous God made us
[2:04:45] as his seed to be inspirational
[2:04:49] can I just go down this for a little bit
[2:04:52] he made us
[2:04:54] inspirational so that's why many times
[2:04:57] you and I can be like
[2:04:59] this it's not that we haven't been born
[2:05:02] again and that we don't have the Holy
[2:05:04] Ghost it means that God calls
[2:05:08] Believers that are inspirational and
[2:05:11] have a seed down inside of them and you
[2:05:13] never fit into this world
[2:05:16] never you'll never fit in to the
[2:05:20] world and you can get anxious and upset
[2:05:23] and try to fit in you're not going to
[2:05:25] fit
[2:05:26] in this should be the place we can let
[2:05:29] off the pressure and feel at home that's
[2:05:33] why I asked you in the beginning we need
[2:05:34] to respect one
[2:05:39] another the only person that should be
[2:05:42] nervous after these meetings is the
[2:05:44] devil that nervous Spirit starts working
[2:05:47] and feeding off of someone else well
[2:05:49] just throw up your hands and say devil
[2:05:52] I'm going to be
[2:05:53] delivered this weekend is my time for
[2:05:56] peace I I will restore my mind has been
[2:05:58] scattered broken I feel like it's being
[2:06:01] pulled apart I will restore is a promise
[2:06:05] of God like a lightning
[2:06:10] bow so it means that God is going to
[2:06:13] make you complete I'm just in the second
[2:06:15] line there and to be sound I've given
[2:06:19] you a sound
[2:06:20] mind I'm here to make your life
[2:06:24] complete to be I'm going to finish this
[2:06:27] work I'm going to cause you to be ended
[2:06:29] and come to the end
[2:06:32] uninjured Hallelujah now that's kind of
[2:06:34] strange because you say well brother
[2:06:36] John I'm tattered I'm broken I've been
[2:06:38] injured I've been shot at I've been in a
[2:06:41] fight and the sword is got me I'm going
[2:06:43] to talk about that in a few minutes I'm
[2:06:45] going to show you on the screen what
[2:06:47] scars are but to be uninjured is not
[2:06:51] does not mean that when the Rapture
[2:06:53] happens that our spirits and our bodies
[2:06:56] aren't going to have some
[2:06:58] difficulties people that are older
[2:07:00] finally realize that our bodies we need
[2:07:02] a
[2:07:04] change and when we're younger we think
[2:07:06] we're Invincible we can take on the
[2:07:07] world well as you get a little older if
[2:07:09] there becomes trauma in your life you
[2:07:11] realize we need the
[2:07:14] Lord we need the Lord even if you're
[2:07:17] healthy and strong we need the Lord why
[2:07:20] don't you just say it I need the Lord
[2:07:22] need the Lord say but I got it together
[2:07:25] that's a problem you'll never be helped
[2:07:28] unless you realize I need more of the
[2:07:30] Lord there's there's more of me I can
[2:07:33] you say but I've got the Holy Ghost and
[2:07:35] you ought to be pulling harder you ought
[2:07:36] to be pulling saying God fill us all

[2:09:43] news and even if they came in here with
[2:09:46] a wheelbarrow of a $100 bills by
[2:09:48] tomorrow that could be worth
[2:09:53] zero it's true friend right during this
[2:09:56] service the whole economy of America
[2:09:59] could be
[2:10:01] collapsing there could be already bombs

[2:10:05] be resurrected Saints coming down the
[2:10:07] road to walk in

[2:10:13] [Applause]
[2:10:17] hallelujah
[2:10:18] so it it is God Awakening our desire yes
[2:10:22] I mean where would you rather
[2:10:23] be down at a pub
[2:10:26] somewhere having sex with someone
[2:10:28] outside of
[2:10:32] marriage and don't worry not just young
[2:10:35] people and not just middleaged but in
[2:10:37] the
[2:10:38] message so don't think that it's all
[2:10:41] this and that and holier than thou on
[2:10:44] there'll be a huge crash for you one day
[2:10:47] cuz God's going to restore you no matter
[2:10:49] what and until your stubborn stiff neck
[2:10:52] mind and heart gets
[2:10:54] broken so why not just let it be broken
[2:10:57] amongst people that love you that's
[2:10:59] right instead of being a broken heart to
[2:11:02] someone that's just going to throw you
[2:11:04] in the corner anyway and you're just
[2:11:06] another
[2:11:07] number I pray if someone has been going
[2:11:10] down that road brother Matthew that
[2:11:13] maybe all of this was to save a lot of
[2:11:15] Despair and ruin
[2:11:19] amen and if it has happened in your life
[2:11:22] that's not the unpardonable
[2:11:24] sin
[2:11:26] hello we all know what the unpardonable
[2:11:28] sin is right it's blasphemy against the
[2:11:31] Holy Ghost so if you feel an urge up to
[2:11:34] just say something just and whatever
[2:11:37] you've done in your life and I don't
[2:11:39] know who the holy spirit's talking to
[2:11:41] right now but it's not the unpardonable
[2:11:45] sin it's time to commit that to God and
[2:11:48] put it under the blood and let's go
[2:11:50] on stop holding that
[2:11:53] inside or you'll go
[2:11:56] [Applause]

[2:17:16] you ever heard that restoration of the
[2:17:18] brid tree what I wanted you to see is
[2:17:20] right in the beginning in the middle is
[2:17:22] the first year then you can see in a
[2:17:24] rainy season the lines actually get
[2:17:27] wider that's because there's more
[2:17:31] growth then the years that it was
[2:17:34] drier maybe like the last few months in
[2:17:37] the message you know you couldn't go to
[2:17:38] church or this with cancelling meetings
[2:17:40] you got a
[2:17:43] stream can't go to Young peoples can't
[2:17:46] go to camp and
[2:17:48] it's like you're gasping it's like a dry
[2:17:50] season yeah but what I wanted you to see
[2:17:53] here is the scar from a forest fire can
[2:17:57] you see that can you see that brother
[2:17:59] Jason at this certain year of this
[2:18:02] tree's life there was a forest
[2:18:06] fire that went through the church or the
[2:18:10] family yeah or school or a
[2:18:13] relationship it was like a forest fire
[2:18:16] and it burned you could see the effects
[2:18:18] that it
[2:18:21] had next
[2:18:23] slide thank you brothers that are
[2:18:25] helping me back there now the wood of
[2:18:28] this tree oh you can see it's 24 years
[2:18:33] old 24 years and you can see the
[2:18:37] different years of its
[2:18:39] life but there's a knot there can you
[2:18:42] see that on the bottom part of the that
[2:18:45] knot lasted for five years w wow there
[2:18:48] was a situation that
[2:18:50] happened and it it actually whether it
[2:18:53] grew around another sapling something
[2:18:57] happened it it it became a
[2:18:59] knot in the believer's life you can see
[2:19:02] that it lasted for five years I just
[2:19:05] want you all to know that not every tree
[2:19:09] is perfect
[2:19:11] amen not every believer is perfect we
[2:19:14] know spiritually our souls and we you
[2:19:17] know we're already there Heavenly places
[2:19:19] we can quote that all day long but we
[2:19:21] have people sitting in the pews that are
[2:19:22] wondering why the scars why the forest
[2:19:25] fires well I'm I'm speaking to you
[2:19:27] tonight there's knots in our lives
[2:19:29] there's situations that no matter how
[2:19:32] good it might be it comes around to
[2:19:35] that and it hits the
[2:19:39] situation I'm speaking about some of
[2:19:41] your
[2:19:42] lives next
[2:19:44] slide now this certain tree
[2:19:48] is about 30 years old it was cut when it
[2:19:50] was 30 years old it's Douglas fur tree
[2:19:54] but when it was 20 years old you can see
[2:19:57] for 20 years throughout its whole
[2:19:59] adolescent teenage years Etc the tree
[2:20:03] how it was so the lines are very very
[2:20:05] little can you all see that it was lean
[2:20:07] years it was dry they weren't in a
[2:20:09] church that was strong they they were
[2:20:11] out in the world or they came to the
[2:20:13] Lord when they were 20 years
[2:20:15] old but there came a certain time
[2:20:17] time they're calling it bio solids but
[2:20:20] certain things started being poured into
[2:20:22] this tree's life growth uh
[2:20:26] water
[2:20:28] care compassion amen God brought a young
[2:20:32] person into that or a youth leader into
[2:20:35] that church maybe like brother Wes
[2:20:37] Willis yeah or he brought a certain
[2:20:40] Minister by that certain year at Youth

[2:28:56] everyone to toil and labor and go
[2:28:59] through a whole Global
[2:29:02] pandemic because his word says I will
[2:29:05] restore I'm sorry if I said that word
[2:29:07] but I'm just getting your attention
[2:29:09] whatever we've gone through is for God

[2:29:14] life awaken Jesus Jus that's in your
[2:29:19] [Applause]
[2:29:23] boat let's let's go to the next slide I
[2:29:25] wanted to show this tree but I wanted to
[2:29:28] bring your attention back to the fire
[2:29:30] the scar this Wildfire happened in a
[2:29:34] situation that was
[2:29:35] unplanned this tree did not call for it
[2:29:38] and it didn't ask for it but there came
[2:29:40] a
[2:29:41] wildfire a situation happened in the
[2:29:45] church in your family yes in a
[2:29:48] relationship and you didn't ask for
[2:29:50] it and look how long it lasted look at
[2:29:53] this I'm showing you on the screen how
[2:29:55] many years it affected this tree and
[2:29:58] even in the middle part of its life can
[2:30:02] y'all see that whenever it comes around
[2:30:04] to November November why is it November
[2:30:08] because this happened brother Matthew I
[2:30:10] could sit down and talk to you about it
[2:30:12] I could tell you the details like it's
[2:30:14] just so real in my mind it's a scar
[2:30:18] yeah and someone else is looking at you
[2:30:21] saying just get over it come on well the
[2:30:24] guy walked out of your life and he said
[2:30:26] crude mean things just get over it well
[2:30:29] it could be like
[2:30:31] this and everyone else is saying well
[2:30:34] why isn't she doing okay wh why isn't
[2:30:37] that brother it just seems like he just
[2:30:39] hit a certain point
[2:30:41] then and now he's just the fire's gone
[2:30:45] yeah that's right it it was a it was a
[2:30:49] scar and you can see how the wide Rings
[2:30:52] indicate there was fast growth that year
[2:30:54] the weather was good water was available
[2:30:57] things were good life is good it's not
[2:31:00] always good come on there's going to be
[2:31:02] scars there's going to be
[2:31:04] wildfires am I breaking some of your
[2:31:06] romance novels it's not all going to be
[2:31:10] good they're not going to treat you
[2:31:12] always
[2:31:14] good life isn't fair that's right hello
[2:31:18] somebody I got about half of you with me
[2:31:21] life isn't always good God is
[2:31:32] good I'm just speaking the word God is
[2:31:35] good all the time but what happens to
[2:31:38] you isn't always good but it will work
[2:31:41] out for your good some of you know the
[2:31:43] scripture better than I do it's in
[2:31:45] Romans somewhere amen I've been
[2:31:47] preaching to you quotes of brother
[2:31:49] brandom almost word for word and
[2:31:52] scriptures and then the narrow Rings it
[2:31:55] indicates slow growth that means there
[2:31:59] was either a regional
[2:32:01] drought or cold
[2:32:04] temperatures hit and there's just not a
[2:32:07] lot of growth but all of a sudden
[2:32:11] January 2021 hit and I started hearing a
[2:32:15] Revival the move of God young people's
[2:32:19] meetings groups coming together churches
[2:32:22] it was like we hit another
[2:32:24] level it was like God was saying I've
[2:32:26] about had
[2:32:28] enough of the lethargy coldness staying
[2:32:31] at of church fist bumping waving give me
[2:32:35] a hand you know it's like I've got to
[2:32:37] come down and I've got to fulfill my
[2:32:40] word somebody know what I'm going to say
[2:32:43] I will restore amen has been laying
[2:32:47] there all these years but there has to
[2:32:49] come a time that the book is handed to
[2:32:52] him you know the pages are stuck
[2:32:54] together that even a prophet had to hear
[2:32:56] from a Catholic
[2:32:58] priest and have his Bible given to him
[2:33:02] it wasn't the Bible it was the
[2:33:04] word this day this scripture is
[2:33:08] fulfilled wake up
[2:33:10] tonight maybe somebody on the Internet
[2:33:12] is catching this more than we are in
[2:33:14] this building prophecies being fulfilled
[2:33:18] this is none less than thus sayith the
[2:33:19] Lord if brother Brandon was preaching
[2:33:22] behind this Pulpit he'd be preaching
[2:33:24] like this cuz this is how he preached it
[2:33:27] wasn't a lesson of of just you know
[2:33:36] discour he was
[2:33:38] connecting he would go a whole service
[2:33:40] and you just say you know there's been a
[2:33:42] spirit on this side has been
[2:33:43] fellowshipping with somebody back there
[2:33:45] yeah but I see now light going and
[2:33:47] there's light if God would open your
[2:33:49] eyes to the angels that line these walls
[2:33:53] can't you see that streak that's going
[2:33:54] from brother Matthew back there in the
[2:33:56] back and the deacons someone's leaning
[2:33:58] forward sister Gan is leaning forward
[2:34:00] saying God this is what we've been
[2:34:01] praying for somebody on the internet was
[2:34:04] already in this service had said I sense
[2:34:06] the
[2:34:07] atmosphere I sense the anointing they're
[2:34:10] not even in this room wow wow it's
[2:34:13] because we are fulfilling what a prophet
[2:34:15] said there would be voices and colors
[2:34:19] excuse me Brothers social distancing I'm
[2:34:22] sorry there would be voices and colors
[2:34:24] going through a room in Australia from
[2:34:28] this from that tonight we're going to
[2:34:30] Pakistan indiaan Africa right now this
[2:34:33] very moment someone in Africa is saying
[2:34:36] Amen Brother John yes brother John
[2:34:39] preach it this is what we
[2:34:41] need God help us to be right in the
[2:34:43] midst of it and not even know that
[2:34:46] prophecies being
[2:34:47] fulfilled this day God is restoring
[2:34:51] Minds restoring Hearts restoring you
[2:34:55] from the scars and the years the years
[2:34:58] the next slide I just put it on the
[2:35:00] screen here as we come toward the end of
[2:35:02] the service Psalms
[2:35:04] 107:20 he sent his word and healed
[2:35:10] them so he's not talking about just one
[2:35:13] here one there we had a nice meeting by
[2:35:16] the Cadre is kind of nice 200 plus young
[2:35:18] people but it was and they were all
[2:35:20] filled with the Holy Ghost they were
[2:35:23] within one mind and one Accord God send
[2:35:26] his word and healed them let's all say
[2:35:29] them it's for me it's for
[2:35:33] us till we all come to the same measure
[2:35:38] the statute of maturity then we can all
[2:35:41] go
[2:35:42] [Applause]
[2:35:44] home he sent his
[2:35:48] word and healed
[2:35:50] them and delivered
[2:35:52] them from
[2:35:55] there can we all say
[2:35:59] it what Satan thought for
[2:36:02] evil Peter Satan wanted to sift you like
[2:36:06] wheat like sand like brother Jason
[2:36:08] putting a bunch of sand in my hand like
[2:36:11] this it would just come out and just
[2:36:12] fall out Satan wanted to sift you like
[2:36:15] that let you fall to the ground and
[2:36:17] here's a word he said his word and
[2:36:20] healed them and delivered them from
[2:36:22] their
[2:36:23] destructions I just want to stop right
[2:36:25] now and say praise the Lord prise the
[2:36:27] Lord thank you Jesus you
[2:36:31] Jesus
[2:36:39] Hallelujah some of you just need to
[2:36:41] confess it and say I am
[2:36:44] healed I am delivered
[2:36:46] I I am whole I I have peace I have peace
[2:36:51] I have joy I have joy hallelujah
[2:36:54] hallelujah in the upper room they were

[2:44:24] to show you this one year ago one year
[2:44:27] ago in June brother John went by this
[2:44:30] place
[2:44:31] and it's in Bellingham
[2:44:34] Washington it's actually my father and
[2:44:37] mother's wedding anniversary on June the
[2:44:39] 16th that's next week and we went across
[2:44:42] to an Olive
[2:44:44] Garden
[2:44:45] across this parking lot and I saw the
[2:44:47] wound healing
[2:44:50] Center and something jumped into my
[2:44:52] heart for the young people of the
[2:44:57] message this is amazing the world can
[2:45:01] have a wound healing Center for Natural
[2:45:06] Things why isn't there someone dealing
[2:45:09] with the
[2:45:10] wounds amongst our young people in the
[2:45:14] message that are real why isn't someone
[2:45:18] dealing with the
[2:45:20] wounds and again have you just drive by
[2:45:23] this like sister Anna hope and all the
[2:45:25] ones from our area that are in they've
[2:45:28] driven by this road they've been in this
[2:45:30] Clinic my
[2:45:33] daughter-in-law is an RN and she took
[2:45:36] someone to this very facility it's the
[2:45:38] wound healing Center tomorrow night I'm
[2:45:40] going to speak about I looked across
[2:45:42] brother Jason and saw this place
[2:45:44] something triggered in my heart about
[2:45:46] the young people the message why cannot
[2:45:50] they be healed amen on and I'm not going
[2:45:53] to stay on these long because some of
[2:45:54] you might
[2:45:55] faint but these are
[2:45:59] wounds let's watch the screen for a
[2:46:01] moment I hope this is going on the
[2:46:03] internet these are people I'm happy it's
[2:46:06] going on the
[2:46:09] internet these are
[2:46:12] wounds why do young people have it in
[2:46:14] their feet and their hands why on a
[2:46:17] finger you can see on the left hand side
[2:46:19] of your screen the stages of a wound how
[2:46:22] it's bloody and it's all inflamed and
[2:46:24] then as time goes on God does a healing
[2:46:26] you can see on the top one on someone's
[2:46:30] shoulder it it was like Satan was
[2:46:32] wanting to take them
[2:46:34] out it's a
[2:46:37] wound you can see here it creates a scar
[2:46:41] and this is what I want to leave you
[2:46:42] with I want you to think about this to
[2:46:44] till tomorrow
[2:46:46] night a
[2:46:47] scar is evidence that healing has taken
[2:46:53] place so stop talking about all the
[2:46:56] negative and you know reaching under
[2:46:58] your blouse or your shirt and scabby and
[2:47:00] that that's what I'm trying to put some
[2:47:02] oil on and bomm on some of you the
[2:47:05] scar may be there till the Rapture amen
[2:47:09] stop talking about the
[2:47:11] scar we all have
[2:47:13] scars but when you see a scar it's
[2:47:16] evidence that healing has taken
[2:47:20] place prise God it's actually a visible
[2:47:23] or emotional response from a past
[2:47:27] injury that did not lead to
[2:47:32] death you're still
[2:47:34] alive we didn't have your
[2:47:37] [Applause]
[2:47:43] funeral
[2:47:48] somebody say hallelujah
[2:47:51] hallelujah you'll still
[2:47:54] here maybe half here maybe not
[2:47:58] emotionally I'm getting you there come
[2:48:01] on by the end of Sunday when you go home
[2:48:04] where you drive out of here fly out of
[2:48:06] here whatever I I believe God is going
[2:48:09] to do
[2:48:11] healing and we believe in
[2:48:13] miracles but miracles happen suddenly
[2:48:17] was healing takes
[2:48:19] time and God does both of
[2:48:22] them and you always we always want
[2:48:26] Miracles we always want immediate we
[2:48:29] always want I got to get out of here I
[2:48:31] got to know the reason now I want and
[2:48:35] God just standing back there saying I'm
[2:48:37] the
[2:48:39] Healer the healers in the house the
[2:48:42] great Physicians here and we all got our
[2:48:45] placards you know miracle miracle
[2:48:49] miracle who wants a miracle yeah miracle
[2:48:52] and God's saying nope you're going to
[2:48:54] get a
[2:49:02] healing it's called a big fat
[2:49:10] lip and it's Tuesday after the special
[2:49:13] meetings and you're wondering why
[2:49:16] I've got a
[2:49:17] scar why is it black around
[2:49:20] it why do I keep dealing with this I
[2:49:23] guess I didn't get it I guess you know
[2:49:27] it just wasn't real for me and then
[2:49:30] listen I know what I'm talking about oh
[2:49:32] yeah cuz I've streamed Services of the
[2:49:34] Wednesday night after and it's like the

[2:49:43] meeting after meeting after meeting it's
[2:49:45] like

[2:49:55] is is God trying to teach us there's
[2:49:58] scars there's things we're going through
[2:50:00] God's working he's growing and I know

[3:13:18] God we're just going to sing in a moment
[3:13:21] the great physician now is near but I
[3:13:23] wonder if the brothers could bring up
[3:13:25] the first slide again I wanted you to
[3:13:28] see this before I turn the service back
[3:13:30] to our brothers on the very first
[3:13:34] slide I wanted you to see what brother
[3:13:36] Brandon was trying
[3:13:38] to teach us tonight about a young lady
[3:13:41] that was 17 years old
[3:13:43] old going to
[3:13:45] die it was pitiful
[3:13:48] case but he said to prove something to
[3:13:50] my church I never touched the child at
[3:13:53] all so here's a prophet trying to train
[3:13:56] a
[3:14:01] church this was a man that was coming
[3:14:05] into his
[3:14:08] maturity that God Allowed by a message
[3:14:11] to be waved over a generation saying
[3:14:13] there's more out there that's going to
[3:14:15] come and he wanted them to get
[3:14:18] it he wanted them to get it and so he
[3:14:22] was just laying
[3:14:24] back and he had character and he just
[3:14:28] was wanting something for his church he
[3:14:30] never like touched her never called her
[3:14:33] never pointed laid hand never let he was
[3:14:37] just trying to train the
[3:14:41] church I walked in she's laying on a
[3:14:44] stretcher there was a lot of other sick
[3:14:46] people but he was
[3:14:48] concerned he was
[3:14:51] concerned about her to catch her spirit
[3:14:55] and I prayed in my room this
[3:14:58] afternoon that the Lord would go out and
[3:15:01] catch some wondering
[3:15:04] spirits and bring them back
[3:15:10] again only the Holy Spirit can do that
[3:15:13] and go out and catch them and bring them
[3:15:17] back again right so they can breathe and
[3:15:20] be thinking right and he's trying to get
[3:15:22] a church and he's just W concerned
[3:15:26] catching her spirit very fine girl the
[3:15:29] devil was trying to take her life never
[3:15:31] touched her went right to the pulpit
[3:15:33] preached the word stayed with the word
[3:15:36] and God healed her instantly she got up
[3:15:38] and walked out of that place never even
[3:15:41] touched heren and the next slide we read
[3:15:45] that it's it's now the body he is the
[3:15:48] head do you all see that at the end we
[3:15:50] believe every word of God we believe
[3:15:53] that Christ is in God's word he
[3:15:54] manifested it but there's a bride
[3:15:57] there's going to be a group of young
[3:15:58] people that are saying I am
[3:16:01] restored and when the call goes out
[3:16:03] where are the
[3:16:04] youth that are
[3:16:06] restored we can wave our
[3:16:09] flag say where's the Revival in the

[3:25:21] positive this is God this wasn't just an
[3:25:23] inspirational something that you get as
[3:25:25] scripture comes upon your heart she said
[3:25:27] this is like prophetic that the Lord was
[3:25:30] speaking and saying I will restore and

[3:27:35] short man true true couldn't help it

[3:27:41] sure I could create your own player and
[3:27:43] I make myself this tall and 6'4 and you

[3:27:53] choose it you know that he was a short
[3:27:54] man and he couldn't see Jesus couldn't
[3:27:57] help it couldn't see him in the midst of
[3:27:59] the crowd I read something so powerful
[3:28:01] stirred me up and I just want to say it
[3:28:03] tonight it said long before zachus
[3:28:05] couldn't see Jesus God had planted a
[3:28:08] tree to meet his need
