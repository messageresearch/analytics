[1:31] song i find it rather remarkable
[1:34] that brother kenny would sing that it's
[1:36] so conducive to my sermon this morning i
[1:38] think brother kenny better be prepared
[1:40] to sing it again
[1:41] after i finish preaching when we call

[3:20] i believe brother don you were telling
[3:22] me there was a prayer meeting saturday
[3:24] evening
[3:24] amen so praise the lord i appreciate
[3:26] that amen
[3:28] matthew chapter 5 we're just going to
[3:30] read one and
[3:32] matthew chapter 5. we're just going to
[3:34] read one
[3:35] brief verse here and you pray for my
[3:38] throat a little bit it's
[3:39] just sinuses and different things coming
[3:42] back from a flight i'm always
[3:44] battling that a little bit get on that
[3:46] metal tube and
[3:48] amen they say it's purified air but i
[3:52] always come back with a problem
[3:53] so i don't know praise god
[4:00] matthew chapter 5 just want to catch um
[4:04] you know let's just i just really want
[4:06] to catch one verse and we're going to
[4:07] let you be seated straight away
[4:10] verse 48 matthew chapter 5
[4:13] verse 48 be
[4:16] therefore perfect even as your father
[4:19] which is in heaven is perfect
[4:24] amen if you could put my title screen up
[4:27] then brothers and i'll control it from
[4:29] up here
[4:30] let's pray father we thank you for your
[4:34] word this morning i just was so
[4:37] inspired lord listening to the sunday
[4:40] school class and hearing the worship
[4:43] service this morning i
[4:46] have a rather simple and direct thought
[4:50] today lord with just a
[4:52] single verse it might seem rather under
[4:55] achieving to just read one verse but
[4:57] lord
[4:59] when it's a verse out of your word it's
[5:02] greater than all heavens and earth would
[5:03] pass away before that single verse would
[5:05] pass away
[5:06] so we know that little is much if god is
[5:09] in it so we have many other scriptures
[5:12] to refer to today
[5:14] but we wanted to just begin with this
[5:16] simple
[5:17] direct uh command from you when you were
[5:20] here i have
[5:21] i pray you open the eyes of our
[5:24] understanding today that we might
[5:26] see lord what it is that you've burdened
[5:29] my heart with
[5:30] and it's a joyous thing lord we want to
[5:34] teach it correctly
[5:35] we want to believe the right thing
[5:38] but once we get there my goodness i've
[5:41] been so thrilled lord just studying it
[5:44] and it just is such a reassurance to me
[5:48] this dark hour lord where the enemy
[5:51] lord is seemingly on every hand and has
[5:55] permeated every bit of society and every
[5:58] our whole
[5:59] everyday lives lord we spend on this
[6:02] earth that's falling apart
[6:03] but what a provision you have given us
[6:06] in your word lord that we can
[6:08] live above it and rise above it and be
[6:10] above it and be recognized by you
[6:12] as above it even lord and it's so secure
[6:16] and your plan is so brilliant that even
[6:19] if we do stumble at times it doesn't
[6:21] even count against us we're still
[6:23] considered in the image in the vision of
[6:26] christ we're considered perfect
[6:28] so what a plan lord i just say what a
[6:30] plan
[6:31] lord i thank you for it now i surrender
[6:34] myself fully
[6:35] just gonna go along as i feel led i
[6:38] committed to you
[6:39] in jesus name amen god bless you friends
[6:42] you can be seated
[6:51] praise the lord amen
[6:54] now i wish by the help of the lord to
[6:58] bring this thought to you today be
[7:01] perfect
[7:02] i i want to um
[7:07] i'm going to kind of jump ahead of
[7:10] myself here i can already see
[7:13] i'm going to need to do that we'll then
[7:14] we will we will
[7:16] back up uh once i can get this guy up
[7:19] and moving
[7:20] so all right so
[7:24] do we have power to this little guy it
[7:27] would help if i turn it on yeah
[7:30] okay okay josh yeah okay praise the lord
[7:33] now i should have fire in the hole
[7:35] all right yeah here we go now i want i'm
[7:37] going to come back to this we read this
[7:40] actually in the last service
[7:43] and i want to come back to it
[7:45] intentionally there's
[7:47] there's where we read this morning be
[7:50] you therefore perfect
[7:51] even as your father which is in heaven
[7:55] is perfect now i'm i'm going to take
[8:00] matthew 5 and then we're going to follow
[8:04] it
[8:05] here with hebrews 10 1-17
[8:08] now thank you brother kenny now the
[8:10] reason that i'm doing this thanks sir
[8:13] the reason that i'm doing this is
[8:15] because then i'm going to take you
[8:17] to a quote where brother branham ties
[8:20] these two scriptures together
[8:22] and gives you clarity of thought between
[8:24] them that'll be all right
[8:26] all right so now we read here be
[8:29] there for perfect even as your father
[8:32] which is in heaven is perfect i
[8:35] i love the statement that brother
[8:38] branham made one time and i don't have
[8:39] it up here this morning
[8:41] but brother branham quoted this one time
[8:43] and said you know how can you even
[8:46] i mean when you look at that you go okay
[8:48] i might as well
[8:49] never mind because i'll just never be
[8:52] able to achieve that so i might as well
[8:54] eat drink and be merry right
[8:56] well wrong the the i want to say to you
[9:00] that it's made impossibly
[9:04] hard on purpose it's made
[9:07] impossible on purpose
[9:10] god made it in such a way that there's
[9:13] no way you can do it
[9:16] on purpose which means you can't save
[9:19] yourself
[9:20] by any amount of works you would ever do
[9:23] you can't save yourself
[9:24] by any mental assent or no matter what
[9:28] you would ever confess with your lips
[9:31] god still has to achieve your perfection
[9:35] all right
[9:36] so there's there's none perfect
[9:40] and the only one that is was jesus
[9:42] christ
[9:43] that you know paul deals with with that
[9:46] quite a bit
[9:47] in other places in the scripture
[9:49] particularly
[9:50] if you want to have some nice reading
[9:52] today
[9:53] go home and have a fresh read of paul's
[9:56] letter to the romans especially chapters
[10:00] three
[10:00] and four where he really paul takes
[10:04] chapters 3 and chapter 4 of romans
[10:07] to just basically tell us that we're all
[10:09] guilty going to hell and no way to
[10:11] escape it
[10:12] because there's none of us any good and
[10:15] there's never been anybody any good
[10:16] except one amen that we're all
[10:20] open sepulchers we're all liars
[10:23] we're all deceitful there's there's none
[10:26] good
[10:27] no not one a lot of times we can you you
[10:29] can think
[10:30] well you know god will accept me because
[10:33] i'm a pretty good person
[10:35] he won't do that say well god will
[10:38] accept that person because they're a
[10:39] pretty good person he won't do that
[10:40] either
[10:42] god has one provided way to accept a
[10:45] fallen
[10:46] man and that's through the atonement of
[10:48] the blood of christ
[10:50] there is no other approach there is no
[10:52] other way
[10:53] only through the blood of christ now
[10:56] what's what what satan has never been
[11:00] able
[11:01] to catch this satan has never been able
[11:05] to get the christian church
[11:08] to go blind to that for millennia
[11:12] multiple millennia all christians
[11:15] believe that that we are saved by the
[11:18] blood of the lord jesus christ by the
[11:20] atonement
[11:21] by the sacrifice by the death burial and
[11:23] resurrection of christ amen
[11:26] but what satan has been successful in
[11:30] doing
[11:31] we've been preaching on he's been very
[11:33] successful
[11:34] in obscuring what
[11:38] what fully the blood of jesus is
[11:41] and what is it about his blood that
[11:44] redeemed you now it becomes apparent
[11:49] and i don't think anybody could argue
[11:50] with this and if you can i'd sure
[11:52] welcome you to stand up and tell me so i
[11:54] mean that quite sincerely
[11:57] i'm going to make this statement no one
[11:59] has the blood of jesus
[12:02] not that chemistry not the blood that
[12:04] flowed through his veins
[12:06] no one has it do you have it i don't
[12:07] have it does the vatican have it
[12:09] is it in jerusalem somewhere is there a
[12:12] secret vial
[12:13] somewhere of his blood well then how are
[12:16] you ever going to be redeemed
[12:18] you can't even get his blood you have no
[12:20] chance to get it
[12:22] because that chemistry flowed down the
[12:24] cross and fell on the earth and claimed
[12:26] the earth
[12:27] all right and but but the but the
[12:31] secret to being redeemed is that
[12:34] jesus said drink this cup it is my
[12:38] blood in the new testament and when you
[12:41] realize what came
[12:42] in the new testament it was the holy
[12:45] ghost which was him
[12:48] now satan obscured that by making people
[12:50] think it's a third person it's not it's
[12:52] the same person
[12:53] see so we find then that
[12:56] john satisfies the whole argument
[13:00] by a great revelation under an eagle
[13:02] anointing because he was that
[13:04] he represented that fourth living
[13:05] guardian the eagle anointing that's why
[13:07] john picks up things the other
[13:09] writers don't even get and and so
[13:12] so we realize that john gives us a clue
[13:15] to say
[13:17] in the beginning say in the beginning
[13:19] was god no
[13:20] in the beginning was the word
[13:24] you understand there was a time when god
[13:27] that being was not worshipped
[13:29] there was no one to worship him but he
[13:31] was always the word you follow me
[13:34] he was always that divine being he was
[13:38] always that person
[13:39] but at one point he's all alone he
[13:42] doesn't even have angels
[13:43] to even sing his praises until he
[13:45] creates them
[13:47] you understand so this is why jesus
[13:50] would say
[13:51] heavens and earth will pass away but not
[13:53] one of my words will pass away
[13:56] because the word or the logos
[14:00] is god simply in a form
[14:03] and when it and when and and when he
[14:06] merged himself into that pillar of fire
[14:09] that pillar of fire
[14:11] became a son of god by designation
[14:13] because it
[14:14] went from one position into another and
[14:16] it became from two
[14:18] you got me but it's only a designation
[14:21] it didn't make a second person
[14:24] so the pillar of fire that led the
[14:26] children of israel wasn't a second
[14:28] god he was the very same one
[14:31] that promised abraham see but when he
[14:34] came to promise abraham
[14:36] catch what he did he comes as a human
[14:38] being
[14:40] and it's all the same person you
[14:43] understand
[14:44] so so when we when we find out
[14:47] that how do we access the blood of god
[14:51] the only way to do that the only the
[14:54] only way to do that
[14:56] is through the word of god
[14:59] by believing the word of god by
[15:03] accepting when you accept the word of
[15:05] god you're accepting god
[15:08] and that's why john would say if we walk
[15:12] in the light
[15:13] of the word as he is in the word
[15:17] then we have fellowship one with another
[15:20] why because we're all born again of the
[15:21] same spirit
[15:23] amen we're all born of the same being
[15:26] we have fellowship one with another you
[15:28] don't have fellowship
[15:29] with the family of god if you're outside
[15:32] of the
[15:33] new birth you can be friends to them you
[15:35] could be neighbors with them you could
[15:36] be acquaintances
[15:37] you can be human blood kin but you're
[15:39] not in the family of god
[15:41] because you can't join that and that's
[15:44] where
[15:44] satan obscured it to the churches down
[15:46] through the ages they thought you could
[15:48] join that and be baptized and
[15:49] put your name on a role and doesn't do
[15:51] you any good at all
[15:53] you have to be as jesus said to
[15:55] nicodemus
[15:56] born again amen and we're going to show
[15:59] you that the new birth
[16:01] has always come acceptance before god
[16:04] has always come
[16:06] by receiving his word amen
[16:09] and no man ever found acceptance before
[16:12] god
[16:12] by rejecting any part of his word it is
[16:15] impossible to do because
[16:17] that's the access to him amen because
[16:20] you don't have his blood
[16:23] but if we walk in the light as he's in
[16:26] the light
[16:27] then we have fellowship one with another
[16:30] and the blood of jesus
[16:32] cleanses us from sin there is a
[16:35] chemistry blood there is a
[16:36] a physical body and that body lays on
[16:39] lays on the mercy seat brother venom
[16:41] said that body lays there
[16:42] and there's a perpetual atonement the
[16:44] voice of that blood speaking for me
[16:47] speaking for you but how do you access
[16:50] it because you're here and it's there
[16:53] so how are you going to get any value in
[16:55] it by
[16:56] faith in the word
[17:00] nothing more faith plus
[17:03] nothing no works
[17:07] no accomplishments it means nothing to
[17:10] god he can't use
[17:11] any of your works all your works or
[17:13] filthiness to him
[17:15] your best effort you understand and so
[17:18] he
[17:19] makes it completely impossible so that
[17:22] he's the only one who can do it for you
[17:26] and you gain access to it by receiving
[17:28] his word
[17:29] and that's never not been true
[17:33] when abel received acceptance by god
[17:37] did abel receive acceptance by god
[17:40] because
[17:41] he slew a lamb and did works
[17:44] or because or was it more than that
[17:47] was it because he received a revelation
[17:50] to slay a lamb
[17:51] and slaying the lamb was only a
[17:53] testimony of his faith
[17:56] his works followed his faith not the
[17:59] other way around
[18:00] you see what i'm saying so it wasn't
[18:02] just his physical slaying of a lamb
[18:05] but but what he because cain could have
[18:08] done that but cain refused the
[18:09] revelation you understand
[18:11] and therefore he had no works that were
[18:13] willing to follow that cain wanted to
[18:15] stay
[18:16] his own thinking in his own way and
[18:19] there's
[18:19] there's the rub that's why jesus said
[18:23] that straight is the gate narrow is the
[18:26] way and few there'll be that find it
[18:27] however
[18:28] broad is the way that leadeth to
[18:30] destruction and many
[18:32] shall go therein despite god
[18:36] making it as easy and simple
[18:40] as could possibly be be made and that is
[18:43] to just
[18:44] surrender being you and let him come in
[18:47] and be him in you
[18:49] and then when when you can find that
[18:52] place
[18:52] mentally to ex it's not about accepting
[18:55] doctrine
[18:56] it's not just that it's it's it's
[18:59] accepting
[19:00] the change that he'll make in your life
[19:03] that's mentally as far as you can go
[19:05] because
[19:05] a lot of times you come to god when you
[19:07] first come to god you don't even
[19:08] understand the doctrines you haven't
[19:10] even been you haven't read the doctrines
[19:12] so it's not about agreeing with all the
[19:14] doctrines the holy spirit will lead you
[19:16] and guide you to all truth you don't
[19:17] have to worry about that
[19:19] you understand but what it is is is not
[19:22] just
[19:22] accepting of mentally accepting the
[19:24] doctrines but it's mentally accepting to
[19:27] stop being you
[19:28] and let him become alive in you so that
[19:31] you're willing to give up your life and
[19:33] when you do that
[19:35] then that kind of repentance makes you a
[19:38] candidate for the holy ghost
[19:40] and then the what is the holy ghost it's
[19:42] god coming down
[19:43] as a sign as a seal god is testifying
[19:47] i i accept your faith it's pure
[19:51] it's a hundred percent you're not trying
[19:53] to be half me and half you
[19:54] or ninety percent me and ten percent you
[19:57] you're willing to completely die
[19:59] and let me have complete control of your
[20:00] life therefore i'm gonna give you the
[20:02] holy ghost to seal you in
[20:04] that's the holy ghost that's what the
[20:05] holy ghost is given for
[20:10] and paul breaks that down in romans
[20:12] three and four
[20:13] where he he starts talking about you
[20:16] know these sacrifices and things that
[20:18] they bring and he
[20:19] pricks up abraham and he says
[20:22] you say oh you've got to be circumcised
[20:24] he said okay well did abraham receive
[20:25] the promise before circumcision or after
[20:27] circumcision
[20:29] well none of those jews won't answer
[20:30] that one because then they trapped
[20:31] themselves
[20:32] because obvious he received it before he
[20:34] was ever circumcised
[20:36] he was circumcised because he received
[20:38] it and accepted it and god gave him the
[20:40] seal
[20:40] as a sign that his faith was true
[20:44] see and it didn't matter at that point
[20:46] at that point it didn't matter what
[20:48] anybody believed about abraham and it
[20:49] didn't even matter if abraham
[20:51] failed afterward and he did numerous
[20:54] times
[20:55] none of that mattered because now
[20:58] abraham's righteousness
[20:59] was imputed to him and couldn't be taken
[21:01] back
[21:03] couldn't be reversed see he believed god
[21:07] paul said and god imputed righteousness
[21:10] unto him
[21:11] so so it's it's by faith
[21:14] through grace amen not not of works not
[21:18] of him that willeth or him that runeth
[21:20] it's god that showeth mercy
[21:22] let me tell you something friends the
[21:23] the getting the new birth isn't
[21:25] difficult getting the
[21:27] baptism of the holy ghost isn't
[21:28] difficult satan will have you chasing
[21:30] something
[21:32] have you chasing some mental i i think
[21:34] it must be some emotion or i must have
[21:36] to have this or i must
[21:37] it must it you know if i make this
[21:40] mistake i must not have it
[21:42] none of that that's all just smoke and
[21:44] mirrors that's all the devil trying to
[21:45] confuse and
[21:46] stir up the water you understand so god
[21:49] has sent his presence into the world by
[21:52] his word
[21:53] and from your whole mind and your whole
[21:55] heart and soul
[21:57] you have said amen to every word and
[21:59] that means that you're saying lord
[22:02] here's what it means for me lord i i'm
[22:05] i'm not perfect and i don't always live
[22:08] perfect
[22:09] but i have a perfect acceptance that i
[22:12] want to have your life in me
[22:14] i have a perfect acceptance of your
[22:16] holiness
[22:17] i want it i chase it i crave it i desire
[22:20] it
[22:20] if i fail i'll repent then i'll go again
[22:23] because i am completely i'm all in i'm
[22:26] all in i'm all in
[22:28] and whatever you have to change in my
[22:31] life
[22:31] change it and if i'm holding on to
[22:36] something and won't let it go rip it
[22:38] from me
[22:39] by any means necessary lord cause me at
[22:42] every point and every turn to obey your
[22:45] word
[22:46] i can't ever exactly get this here in
[22:48] the flesh
[22:49] but i can sure have that in my faith i
[22:51] can have a perfect faith and i do
[22:55] see you thought perfect faith was just
[22:57] to speak squirrels into existence
[23:00] perfect faith is what gives you the new
[23:02] birth
[23:04] perfect faith in the word of god that's
[23:06] that when you have perfect
[23:08] faith in god's word that's when you walk
[23:10] down the street and demons howl and
[23:12] faint
[23:14] when you have perfect faith that's when
[23:15] you say to this mountain be moved
[23:18] why because god unctioned you to do it
[23:20] not because you decided to do it you've
[23:21] already stopped being you
[23:25] understand so it's never about trying to
[23:27] figure out
[23:28] i'm going to go do this i'm going to
[23:30] have this i'm going to accomplish this
[23:31] has nothing to do with that
[23:33] all you'll do is run around and make a
[23:34] big bunch of noise and have a bunch of
[23:36] confusion fall on your face discourage
[23:38] yourself and
[23:38] a lot of people watching you listen
[23:41] friends it's not difficult
[23:43] it's faith in the word
[23:46] faith alone in the word because you have
[23:49] received
[23:50] the message of the hour because you have
[23:52] believed the report
[23:54] because you have received him whom god
[23:56] hath sent
[23:57] all right now that's quite a mouthful i
[23:59] better be able to prove it right
[24:02] all right so then we're going to come to
[24:05] our our next passage hebrews 10. now
[24:08] let's take a reading for the law
[24:10] having a shadow of good things to come
[24:12] and not the very image of the things
[24:15] could never with those sacrifices which
[24:17] they offered year by year continually
[24:19] make the comers there and to perfect now
[24:20] just read that this way
[24:23] for the law having a shadow of good
[24:25] things to come and not the very image
[24:27] of the and not the new birth can never
[24:30] with all my works which i offer
[24:32] continually
[24:33] make me perfect amen all right
[24:37] for because that's an old testament
[24:39] version and i just gave you the new
[24:40] testament version
[24:42] all right for then would they not have
[24:44] ceased to be offered i mean if you could
[24:46] have
[24:47] perfected your life good enough to be
[24:49] accepted by god then why
[24:51] would jesus even have to have died
[24:54] well i'm gonna i'm gonna make it a
[24:56] requirement that because i see that
[24:57] there will be people who'll become
[24:59] perfect but i'll send jesus anyway to
[25:00] pick up the stragglers
[25:02] that's not how it works all right
[25:05] for then would they not have ceased to
[25:07] be offered because that the worshipers
[25:09] once purged
[25:10] should have had no more conscience of
[25:11] sin there is
[25:13] what the holy ghost is trying to get to
[25:16] verse 2 look at it zero in on it
[25:20] paul is paul is prophesying he's showing
[25:23] look you were chasing you were chasing
[25:27] this you love this
[25:28] that you have no more conscience of sin
[25:30] that's the whole plan right
[25:32] i'll take out the stony heart and put in
[25:34] a heart of flesh i'll cause them to keep
[25:36] my
[25:36] word amen don't you want your desires
[25:39] changed
[25:41] you don't want to have to live as a
[25:42] christian life by gritting your teeth do
[25:44] you
[25:45] you don't want to you don't want to have
[25:46] just enough religion to make you
[25:47] miserable do you
[25:49] well good news the gospel didn't come
[25:52] for that
[25:53] the gospel came to change your nature
[25:56] the word came to change your nature the
[25:57] word came to take away conscience of sin
[25:59] in other words all desires of sin you
[26:02] can finally be free
[26:06] you can finally be free that you can
[26:09] finally
[26:10] live after the ordinances of god amen
[26:14] and and if we sin john said we have an
[26:16] advocate
[26:18] see but he that's born of god doth not
[26:21] commit sin why because he has no more
[26:23] conscience of sin
[26:24] that evil nature's gone it's annihilated
[26:26] ain't never coming back
[26:29] you're born again you've already passed
[26:31] from death to life you can never come
[26:32] into the judgment
[26:34] so it's not about a checklist of wins
[26:37] and losses
[26:38] stop letting the devil put you under
[26:40] that kind of tyranny
[26:42] you're going to do wrong let me give you
[26:44] a direct quote you're going to do wrong
[26:45] you'll willfully do wrong
[26:47] it doesn't mean you're not a son it
[26:49] means a rod of correction is coming
[26:52] amen and i just say thank god for the
[26:55] rod
[26:56] thank the lord that he corrects me see
[26:59] and so so so we find then that paul is
[27:02] actually trying to get him to understand
[27:05] if if sacrifices could have done it then
[27:07] wouldn't they have ceased to be offered
[27:09] why'd you have to keep doing it every
[27:10] year
[27:11] why jews hey you hebrews
[27:14] you hebrews why'd you have to keep doing
[27:17] it every year because it never removed
[27:18] your desire for sin
[27:21] did it and the hebrews all go
[27:25] right because it couldn't but in those
[27:27] sacrifices there is a remembrance of gin
[27:31] made of sins every year for it's not
[27:34] possible that your works could save you
[27:37] amen amen it's not possible that the
[27:40] blood of bulls and goats should take
[27:41] away sins
[27:42] wherefore when he come and this is why
[27:44] when he came into the world he
[27:46] said sacrifice and offerings thou
[27:48] wouldest not that was not jesus desire
[27:51] then and it's not his desire now
[27:53] but a body has thou prepared me what a
[27:56] sacrifice
[27:57] once and for all a body i'll give my
[28:00] body as a sacrifice
[28:01] i will live in my body perfectly
[28:05] i will accomplish matthew 5. i said it
[28:08] be you perfect but i wasn't requiring
[28:11] any of my family
[28:13] to live flawlessly i was saying i will
[28:16] live flawlessly on your behalf
[28:19] and when you accept me and my person
[28:23] not as a mental acceptance only of
[28:25] teaching and doctrine but
[28:27] when you accept my person in the holy
[28:29] ghost i will come in and destroy all
[28:31] your old desires of sin
[28:33] and i will i will you'll pass from death
[28:35] to life and even if you do sin it won't
[28:38] count against you because the blood is
[28:40] already speaking
[28:41] [Music]
[28:43] the blood speaks before i fall when i
[28:46] fall
[28:47] after i fall amen amen
[28:51] so it it hits that bumper that surrounds
[28:54] that bloody bumper that can never reach
[28:55] god
[28:56] see wherefore when he cometh into the
[28:59] world he said sacrifice and offering
[29:00] thou what is not but a body has
[29:02] thou prepared me and burnt offerings and
[29:05] sacrifices for sin thou hast had no
[29:07] pleasure no satisfaction
[29:09] god never got his family where he his
[29:12] back to
[29:13] to the garden of eden pre-fall by
[29:16] sacrifices and offerings
[29:18] of blood of bulls and goats he never
[29:19] accomplished that you understand
[29:21] and he was it was it was the benevolence
[29:25] of god don't read ahead of me
[29:26] it was the benevolence of god that even
[29:29] offered us a substitute god didn't have
[29:31] to do that
[29:33] god god was the offended party
[29:37] god hadn't done anything wrong man had
[29:39] made a choice
[29:40] against god's word god built a perfect
[29:41] world
[29:43] people want to blame god for the cruelty
[29:45] of sin and mankind brought on the
[29:46] cruelty of sin
[29:48] it blows my mind and you think you think
[29:51] god doesn't
[29:52] it doesn't break his do you think the
[29:53] cruelty of sin and seeing children
[29:54] suffering and seeing wars and men blow
[29:56] up and
[29:57] you think that doesn't break the heart
[29:59] of god you think
[30:01] you know god is just ambivalent he just
[30:04] stands off and he's just uncaring and
[30:05] unarrested no
[30:06] friends from the very from the very
[30:08] beginning
[30:09] he agreed to accept a substitute until
[30:12] one day he could come
[30:13] and give his own life that was the love
[30:17] of god god didn't have to do that
[30:19] god did that god allowed them to slay an
[30:22] animal
[30:23] and then god would would would not would
[30:26] not
[30:26] bring about the judgment he paul said he
[30:28] just kept passing it off
[30:30] he passed over judgment passed over
[30:32] judgment because he knew someday
[30:34] i'll pardon him completely so he passed
[30:36] over judgment based on what he would do
[30:38] in the future
[30:39] you understand so when his family died
[30:42] they went to paradise
[30:44] amen so he passed over judgment
[30:47] waiting for the time when he could come
[30:49] himself and be
[30:51] the perfect human and then all you have
[30:54] to do
[30:55] is approach that human approach that
[30:58] sacrifice
[30:59] by faith and recognize that the the
[31:02] christ on the cross
[31:03] and the christ in this book are the same
[31:05] person amen
[31:08] and so it becomes ridiculous to accept
[31:12] the
[31:12] one on the cross and refuse this one
[31:16] you understand that's what the world
[31:19] that's what the devil has been
[31:21] successful in getting
[31:23] the christian church in an old in an
[31:25] overwhelming majority
[31:27] to believe see but but you but you but
[31:31] you find
[31:32] that it it doesn't it doesn't pan out
[31:34] and and and we're going to keep proving
[31:36] that all right
[31:39] so and burnt offerings and sacrifices
[31:42] for sin thousands had no pleasure then
[31:44] said i lo i come in the volume of the
[31:47] book it is written of me
[31:48] to do thy will o god above when he
[31:51] said sacrifices and offerings and burnt
[31:53] offerings and offerings for sin thou
[31:55] wouldst not neither has pleasure in them
[31:57] which
[31:57] are offered by the law then said he
[32:00] in other words more than that beyond
[32:02] that he said lo
[32:04] i come to do thy will o god he taketh
[32:08] away the first because of the way he
[32:10] said that
[32:11] that in sacrifices and offerings that's
[32:13] not my main plan i come to do thy will
[32:16] i come to be a propitiation for the
[32:19] people
[32:21] i come to live the perfect example and
[32:24] because he's saying it like that then
[32:26] paul is saying
[32:28] that he taketh away the first this is
[32:30] what he's trying to get those hebrews to
[32:32] understand he takes away
[32:34] the the first that he may establish the
[32:36] second
[32:37] amendment amen so what what that that's
[32:40] what
[32:40] uh the the message of every hour
[32:44] has been able to accomplish to bring a
[32:46] fresh kill of the word
[32:48] to do away with the former and establish
[32:51] the new
[32:52] the problem is people stayed in the
[32:54] former and that's what
[32:57] destroyed them amen that's
[33:00] that's what cain wasn't willing to do
[33:03] he wasn't willing to go on in the word
[33:06] amen you understand so
[33:10] god's no respecter of persons but when
[33:12] abel
[33:15] caught caught what god was after
[33:18] and abel examined it and thought blood
[33:22] yeah that makes sense because
[33:25] realizing what happened in the garden
[33:27] yep that adds up
[33:29] because life's in the blood so i get it
[33:32] and he goes and gets the lamb and brings
[33:34] the lamb and then god
[33:36] accepts his sacrifice just like when you
[33:39] repented
[33:41] and you repented and you came to an
[33:42] altar and said
[33:45] yeah my life was no good i get it all my
[33:48] works
[33:49] of no value to god the only way i can
[33:51] get it is to accept him and let him come
[33:53] into my heart and make me a new creation
[33:55] okay i get it lord and then god accepts
[33:57] that faith you receive the holy ghost
[33:59] you're born again
[34:00] and then the holy ghost keeps leading
[34:01] you in guiding you into a truth
[34:03] you understand that see so
[34:07] so he says verse 10
[34:11] by the which will we are sanctified
[34:15] through the offering of the body of
[34:17] jesus christ
[34:18] once for all right and every priest
[34:22] standeth daily ministering and offering
[34:24] often times the same sacrifices which
[34:26] can never take away
[34:27] sins but this man
[34:30] after he had offered one sacrifice for
[34:32] sin for sins forever
[34:34] sat down on the right hand of god from
[34:37] henceforth expecting till his enemies be
[34:40] made his footstool
[34:41] for by one offering he hath perfected
[34:44] forever
[34:44] them that are sanctified whereof the
[34:47] holy ghost also is a witness to us
[34:49] for after that he had said before this
[34:52] is the covenant that i will make with
[34:54] them after those days saith the lord
[34:56] i will put my laws into their hearts and
[35:00] into their minds will i write them and
[35:02] their sins
[35:03] and iniquities will i remember
[35:06] no more
[35:10] this is why jesus could so confidently
[35:13] say
[35:14] that he that heareth my word and
[35:16] believeth on to him that hath sent me
[35:18] hath everlasting life and shall never
[35:19] come into the judgment
[35:21] because it's once for all see you don't
[35:25] have to keep getting re-saved every time
[35:27] you make a mistake see
[35:31] now you you would think that
[35:35] everybody would take that deal i mean
[35:38] that's like
[35:39] a slam dunk that's like a no-brainer i
[35:41] didn't got to think about that you mean
[35:44] to tell me okay let me get this straight
[35:46] i come to christ i get rid of my stinky
[35:49] old self
[35:50] that gets on my nerves and i hate my
[35:52] fallen desires
[35:54] and i i i i i want to be a better person
[35:58] i've made horrible mistakes it's too
[36:00] late i can't even fix them
[36:01] and you're telling me that christ is
[36:04] going to come
[36:05] first he's going to remove all ever he's
[36:08] going to blank out every transgression i
[36:10] ever committed
[36:12] every one of them yep
[36:15] and then he's going to put me in a
[36:17] position to where
[36:18] i receive his life so that now i can
[36:22] have the kind of holiness and
[36:23] righteousness i always wanted to be
[36:26] and then moreover you're telling me that
[36:29] even if i do make a transgression
[36:31] you're actually telling me i will and
[36:33] that when i do not if i do but when i do
[36:35] it won't even count against me amen yep
[36:38] sign me up as brother ernie would say
[36:42] sign me up you say well everybody would
[36:45] take that deal but the overwhelming
[36:47] majority overwhelming
[36:48] by by orders of magnitude
[36:52] don't take that deal and the reason is
[36:55] because of the one in the middle that
[36:58] they don't want their life
[37:00] changed everybody loves the notion of
[37:03] having their sins
[37:04] emitted and being immune from
[37:06] prosecution going
[37:08] forward everybody would love to have
[37:10] diplomatic immunity
[37:12] and and i don't got to pay for anything
[37:14] i've ever done and i can never be
[37:15] charged for anything i ever do
[37:17] everybody wants to take that deal but
[37:19] they don't want the middle deal
[37:21] that says all right i have to die
[37:24] and let him be reborn in me
[37:28] you see see what i'm saying that's the
[37:31] rub
[37:32] but yet it's to me that's the best part
[37:34] of the deal
[37:36] to me friends that's the best part of
[37:37] the deal i wouldn't care
[37:40] listen if if i knew that i had
[37:45] eternal life in the fallen condition
[37:48] and that nothing i've ever done i'll
[37:50] ever have to pay for
[37:52] and nothing i ever do will ever have to
[37:54] pay for but yet i still have to walk
[37:56] around
[37:57] with with evil desires and filthy
[38:00] thoughts
[38:01] and horrible and i could never uh
[38:04] overcome and never be
[38:05] i i wouldn't want that deal at all i'd
[38:07] say good grief shoot me now get get it
[38:09] over with send me into oblivion
[38:10] blank me dissolve me i don't want to
[38:13] live
[38:13] like that to me to live is
[38:17] to live as christ amen
[38:20] to live as christ if i'm going to live
[38:22] then i i want to live for christ
[38:24] that's my desire if there was never a
[38:26] heaven i'd still want to live for christ
[38:29] because it's a better life and i would
[38:32] enjoy it more
[38:34] amen so even if there was no next life
[38:38] so now we find then watch this
[38:42] let me see where yeah so then brother
[38:44] branham comes along and picks this up
[38:47] the water of separation now he's going
[38:49] to catch
[38:51] matthew 5 be therefore perfect and he's
[38:53] going to catch what we just read in
[38:54] hebrews 10.
[38:56] god looking through the blood he doesn't
[38:59] see you no more as a sinner
[39:02] he sees you redeemed i could just say
[39:05] musicians come let's
[39:06] let's dismiss and go home that right
[39:08] there would be enough
[39:10] you're redeemed because
[39:14] he's always sees you through christ
[39:17] that's the reason we can be perfect not
[39:21] perfect in the sense of sinless we're
[39:23] perfect in the eyes of god
[39:25] when we're in christ that's the reason
[39:27] he said there's matthew 5
[39:30] be therefore perfect even as your father
[39:32] in heaven is perfect
[39:34] paul now he goes to hebrews paul in the
[39:36] 10th chapter of hebrews
[39:38] trying to explain the law having a
[39:40] shadow of good things to come not
[39:42] the very image of the things could never
[39:44] make the comer
[39:45] unto perfect because god was looking
[39:48] through animal blood but
[39:49] now he looks through the blood of his
[39:52] son
[39:52] perfection come by jesus christ not
[39:56] beautiful
[39:57] now i'm not perfect in your sight
[40:01] you may not be perfect in my sight
[40:04] you're not
[40:07] but what about in god's sight
[40:11] uh we should just have a jubilee i mean
[40:14] we should just have a jubilee to say i
[40:17] already know
[40:18] you know brother jason you're not
[40:19] perfect no kidding
[40:21] i already know that thanks for telling
[40:23] me you're not perfect either
[40:25] but in god's sight we're both perfect
[40:29] hallelujah there's
[40:32] where it lays where where where in god's
[40:36] sight
[40:37] see and if you're born again into the
[40:40] body of christ
[40:41] then god looks upon you as perfect as
[40:44] christ was himself
[40:48] amen nothing you can do
[40:51] it's not by any works you can do at all
[40:54] it's by grace god has given you
[40:58] this offer and if you've accepted it
[41:01] in the sight of god you are
[41:04] perfect redeemed washed in the blood of
[41:08] the lamb
[41:09] without fault without blemish without
[41:12] spot
[41:14] isn't that marvelous
[41:20] this is what the word of god would do
[41:22] now
[41:23] okay now let me let me let me back up
[41:25] and show you now you're going to
[41:27] understand why i
[41:28] read this quote to you last time out of
[41:31] the thyatiran church age
[41:33] because now let me explain what the show
[41:35] you what the enemy has been able to do
[41:38] to the nominal church world he says
[41:41] now brother branham is referring to
[41:43] revelation chapter 2.
[41:44] remember we read i don't need to keep
[41:46] going back over all this
[41:47] down to verse 23 and you see proof again
[41:50] of the of a great truth i have been
[41:51] bringing to your attention all along
[41:53] and i will kill her children with death
[41:55] and all the churches
[41:56] see see that word church is plural
[42:00] churches so it meant there's more than
[42:03] one
[42:04] by the time this is written there's more
[42:05] than one now in the original there was
[42:07] only
[42:07] one church of the living god it didn't
[42:09] matter if it was in jerusalem
[42:11] or if it might it might be in
[42:14] thessalonia
[42:14] thessalonica it might it might be a
[42:16] church in rome it might be
[42:18] any anywhere you understand but it
[42:21] it could be in antioch it could be
[42:23] anywhere but it was all one church
[42:26] see but now there's churches because now
[42:29] there has been the beginning of a
[42:32] deceptive
[42:33] thing that looks like a church and satan
[42:36] pulled it off and the people believed it
[42:38] because why why why why because their
[42:41] deeds are evil and they don't want that
[42:43] changed all right watch
[42:47] i will kill our children with death and
[42:49] all the churches shall know that i am he
[42:50] would certainly
[42:51] searcheth the reigns and hearts i've
[42:53] been saying right along
[42:54] there are actually two churches though
[42:56] the spirit speaks to both of them in
[42:57] each age as though they were but one
[43:01] here it is plainly stated that there are
[43:02] churches and it
[43:04] states just as plainly that some of
[43:06] those churches most evidently do not
[43:08] know that he is the one who searcheth
[43:10] the reins and the hearts
[43:11] he is going to prove to them that it is
[43:13] so now then what churches
[43:15] will be those that do not know this
[43:17] truth of course it is the false vine
[43:20] group because
[43:20] the true believers certainly know that
[43:22] judgment begins at the house of god
[43:24] amen you don't you don't argue that do
[43:27] you see
[43:28] so i so i i if i come here and the lord
[43:31] anoints me with a scolding sermon and
[43:32] scours us all out and
[43:34] smashes sin in the head and gets down
[43:36] into your personal life
[43:38] is it okay does judgment begin at the
[43:41] house of god
[43:42] so we don't need to worry about
[43:44] political correctness here
[43:47] right this is the last place in the
[43:49] world you want to be politically correct
[43:51] all right because politics are of the
[43:53] devil
[43:55] see he's a living god all right watch
[43:58] and he's a consuming fire so he says
[44:00] here
[44:01] of course so the the true believers
[44:04] certainly know
[44:04] judgment begins at the house of god and
[44:06] they being god fearing judged themselves
[44:08] that they be not judged we read that in
[44:10] our communion service
[44:11] out of the book of corinthians now why
[44:13] does god call these churches his
[44:15] churches even though they are the false
[44:16] vine the truth of the matter is
[44:18] that they are christians
[44:21] of course there would be see watch
[44:24] but they are not christians of the
[44:26] spirit they are christians of the flesh
[44:29] they are bearing they are bearing the
[44:31] name in vain according to mark 7.
[44:34] amen jesus taught that that they would
[44:37] bear his name in vain
[44:39] how be it in vain do they worship me
[44:41] teaching for doctrine
[44:42] doctrines the commandments of men but
[44:44] indeed they are christians for what else
[44:46] could they be a muhammad and as a
[44:47] mohammed and that is his religion no
[44:49] matter
[44:50] how he lives it because he subscribes in
[44:52] theory to what the quran teaches
[44:55] isn't that simple it's like wow
[44:59] i love that brother branham didn't leave
[45:01] things complicated
[45:02] in the same way a christian is a
[45:04] christian as long as he subscribes to
[45:06] the fact that jesus is the son of god
[45:07] born of a virgin was crucified and died
[45:09] and rose again
[45:10] and that is the savior of mankind
[45:11] etcetera in fact in the later sea and
[45:13] age there will be those who call
[45:14] themselves christians because they
[45:16] subscribe
[45:17] to the fine qualities of jesus while
[45:20] reserving to themselves there's the
[45:23] catch
[45:24] while reserving to themselves the right
[45:26] to deny his deity
[45:28] see christian science have done that
[45:31] already as well as multitudes who preach
[45:33] a social gospel
[45:35] he is a nominal christian and belongs to
[45:37] the church but he's not a true or
[45:39] spiritual believer
[45:40] that kind of a believer is one who has
[45:42] been baptized into the body of christ
[45:44] and is a member of him but nonetheless
[45:47] it is in god's order that the tares grow
[45:49] up with the wheat and they are not to be
[45:51] uprooted
[45:52] that is the command of god their day for
[45:54] binding and burning is coming
[45:56] but not yet so the spirit is speaking to
[45:59] this mixed group
[46:01] on the one hand he is praising and on
[46:03] the other hand he is rebuking
[46:05] i mean god's not bipolar i said that to
[46:07] you last time
[46:08] he's not having an on day and an off day
[46:10] he doesn't wake up on the wrong side of
[46:12] the bed
[46:12] all right so he's one group he's
[46:15] praising the other he's rebuking
[46:18] he has told what is right and here all i
[46:21] remember now i
[46:21] forgot about that i remember keying on
[46:23] this last time
[46:25] he has told what is right with the true
[46:27] believer now
[46:29] he warns what the false vine must do if
[46:31] it is to stand justified before the lord
[46:34] so here he's got a false vine who won't
[46:37] take his way
[46:38] and he's in in great love and great
[46:41] compassion
[46:42] warning them look just like he warned
[46:45] cain gave cain an opportunity tried to
[46:48] get judas to reconsider his thought
[46:51] god's not trying to destroy anybody he's
[46:53] trying to save everybody you understand
[46:56] but he has a provided way and you have
[46:59] to come
[47:00] god's provided way you can't come your
[47:03] way your way is
[47:04] no good and and and i would say friends
[47:08] that
[47:09] that this is this
[47:12] should be the cornerstone of our
[47:15] outreach amen if you've got an
[47:19] outreach that that is not establishing
[47:22] that to the people what
[47:23] what is the point do you want them to
[47:26] come around and just think because
[47:29] you know that that they can sit and hear
[47:31] a sermon preached and
[47:32] smile and shake the preacher's hand and
[47:34] say oh i really enjoyed that or
[47:36] enjoy all all the singing i mean that's
[47:38] not hard to do we have fantastic song
[47:40] leaders
[47:42] i see people come in here and you can
[47:44] you you certainly can see that
[47:46] the spirit of god doesn't dwell on them
[47:47] and they they they go into another realm
[47:51] just a whole nother realm these worship
[47:53] leaders we have just take them right
[47:54] into another realm
[47:56] and but it doesn't change their life
[47:59] they their opinion is well that was a
[48:01] really great sermon
[48:02] that was a really great song service
[48:04] that was a really great worship service
[48:07] but you understand that the cornerstone
[48:09] of what we believe
[48:11] is that it requires faith plus
[48:15] nothing but it has to be a true faith
[48:19] it has to be a real faith that god
[48:22] recognizes as a real faith not just a
[48:25] mental ascent
[48:26] and a historical act but it requires
[48:29] that you
[48:30] come through the bleeding word
[48:34] amen now the beauty of it is
[48:39] and this is really my thought today i'm
[48:41] going to take several scriptures and
[48:43] prove what i've just said out of the
[48:45] bible because if we can't prove it out
[48:46] of the bible
[48:47] we shouldn't be up here so
[48:51] but the the beauty of this whole sermon
[48:54] because i've already spent plenty of
[48:55] time i already spent three services in
[48:57] the last series i did
[48:59] telling you about the great lie that's
[49:01] been you know put on the world remember
[49:04] that we
[49:04] we dealt with that with that great
[49:06] deception i'm not preaching on that
[49:07] today
[49:08] i i'm preaching on the beauty the
[49:10] beautiful side of it
[49:12] is that when you accept god
[49:16] in his revealed word he changes your
[49:19] whole life
[49:20] sets you free from sin you get to be a
[49:22] real christian
[49:24] you get to be a real new creation
[49:27] nothing you've ever done counts and
[49:28] nothing you ever do will count
[49:31] you've got a heaven waiting a body as
[49:33] soon as this earthly tabernacle be
[49:35] dissolved i have one already waiting
[49:36] what is that
[49:37] a word body what built it the word
[49:40] do you think you're going to inhabit a
[49:42] word body disbelieving this word how
[49:44] would you get that word
[49:48] it was the word that created the heaven
[49:50] then when jesus said i go and prepare
[49:52] that he was the word
[49:54] how would you get a word prepared place
[49:57] and a word built body
[49:58] by rejecting any part of his word
[50:02] amen see
[50:05] but when people don't want to change
[50:08] they'll lie to themselves
[50:11] and they'll accept the most thing that's
[50:13] the most convenient
[50:15] so that they can keep their lie and
[50:17] sleep at night
[50:18] and they will heap to themselves
[50:20] teachers who have itching ears to tell
[50:22] them what they want to hear
[50:25] and tell them that they won't brother
[50:27] branham
[50:28] you know i had i had a you know you and
[50:31] i'm sure you've encountered it too where
[50:33] say you know william branham was a false
[50:36] prophet
[50:37] i say well i get why you
[50:41] need to believe that you better hope
[50:42] that's true
[50:44] you better hope it's true because if he
[50:47] if
[50:48] if he was a true prophet you're doomed
[50:51] so he said that to even preachers to say
[50:55] listen william branham said concerning
[50:58] paul's teaching about a woman not
[51:00] cutting her hair
[51:02] and he and brother branham speaking in
[51:04] the third person says
[51:06] woman women will say well my preacher
[51:09] says there's nothing wrong with that
[51:10] and brother branham said he'll suffer
[51:13] for it in the regions beyond
[51:16] that he told her that jeremiah 23 makes
[51:19] that clear
[51:20] that's why god ripped them down and tore
[51:22] them down and put christ over him as a
[51:23] shepherd
[51:24] because they told the people that was
[51:26] the thing that
[51:27] bent god the most that
[51:30] that was he he wasn't angry at ignorance
[51:34] he was angry at iniquity because they
[51:36] were telling the people
[51:38] go ahead and sin it won't matter god
[51:42] won't care
[51:44] and when god heard that he said that's
[51:47] it i am done with these false shepherds
[51:50] and false prophets and i'm going to tear
[51:52] them right out of their position
[51:54] and i'm going to put somebody over them
[51:55] who will tell them my truth
[51:58] because i know i i know by jeremiah 23
[52:02] that if
[52:02] my job is one single job it is
[52:06] definitely not to you know
[52:09] kiss the babies and bury the dead and
[52:11] baptize the ungodly
[52:14] you know i have a life and and i'm i
[52:16] move among you
[52:18] i am a human i love people we fellowship
[52:21] we're brothers we're one and one
[52:22] together amen my family and your family
[52:25] all right but that's not my job my
[52:29] job my commission is to stand in his
[52:32] presence
[52:34] and if i stand in his presence then he
[52:36] promises me that's all he needs me to do
[52:39] just to stand in his presence and then
[52:41] he through me
[52:42] will cause you to hear his word and if
[52:45] you hear his word not my word his word
[52:48] then you'll go free from your sins i
[52:50] have no other job
[52:52] in the world but that one amen see
[52:55] so i stand in his presence and i come
[52:57] here as a conduit of his word
[53:00] and when and i have this confidence that
[53:02] and that's why i don't
[53:04] fall all to pieces over your failures
[53:07] and over my failures because i know
[53:10] that as we hear his word it keeps
[53:12] washing us clean
[53:15] and it will take you to a body change
[53:17] and then you won't have these problems
[53:19] anymore hallelujah
[53:21] oh my i i i'm in an unredeemed body and
[53:25] i
[53:25] i'm i am a wretched man who will deliver
[53:28] me i thank god
[53:29] through jesus christ i will
[53:32] someday be free of this body of death
[53:37] see so we'll just have to stay
[53:40] wretched people wretchedly in love with
[53:44] one another
[53:45] praying for one another abiding with one
[53:48] another
[53:50] uh interceding for one another amen
[53:54] so when we when we all right now
[53:57] take take that down brother josh and i'm
[53:59] going to give you a workout
[54:00] in the in the in the bible take my
[54:03] slide down i'm going to i'm out of time
[54:05] so i'm just going to go through these
[54:06] all right and we'll stop
[54:10] we're going to start in matthew 13. i
[54:12] got maybe a half a dozen i'm just going
[54:13] to give you make a quick comment take me
[54:15] 10 minutes you good
[54:18] so matthew 13. now what am i what am i
[54:20] about to prove
[54:22] you need to know that you need to know
[54:24] what to look for all right
[54:25] i'm going to prove to you what i keep
[54:28] saying
[54:29] that acceptance before god comes by
[54:32] receiving the revealed word in no other
[54:34] way
[54:36] there's no other way it comes a a
[54:39] a a a mental ascent alone
[54:44] of a historical act at calvary by christ
[54:49] that alone does not save you
[54:53] you understand that's a that's a good
[54:55] start
[54:56] you do need to mentally accept that he
[54:58] was the son of god
[55:00] amen that he died to save sinners of
[55:02] which i am chief
[55:04] that that's where it starts you have to
[55:06] start there that's the
[55:07] that's the that's the front door to the
[55:10] gospel
[55:11] but i got a whole house i want to show
[55:13] you
[55:14] all right you so you're not you're not
[55:16] going to really have much shelter if
[55:17] you're just standing on the front porch
[55:19] staring at the front
[55:20] door all right so now
[55:23] yes it's a door yes it can be opened
[55:27] yes it leads you through but you gotta
[55:30] open it and go through
[55:32] all right so now look watch this so
[55:35] we're proving
[55:36] that it only comes by faith in the word
[55:40] all right matthew 13. and let's catch
[55:43] verses 10 through 15 and the disciples
[55:46] came
[55:47] and said unto him if you can get that up
[55:49] brother matthew 13
[55:50] 10-15 perfect and the disciples came and
[55:54] said unto him
[55:56] why speakest thou unto them in parables
[55:58] he answered and said unto them
[56:00] because it is given unto you to know the
[56:03] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
[56:05] but to them it is not given for
[56:08] whosoever hath to him
[56:09] shall be given and he shall have more
[56:12] abundance
[56:13] but whomsoever hath not from him
[56:16] shall be taken away even that he hath
[56:19] verse 13 therefore i speak to them in
[56:22] parables because
[56:24] they seeing see not and hearing they
[56:28] hear not
[56:29] neither do they understand and in them
[56:31] is fulfilled the word
[56:33] fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah which
[56:36] saith
[56:37] by hearing ye shall hear and shall not
[56:39] understand
[56:40] and seeing ye shall see and shall not
[56:42] perceive
[56:44] for this people's heart is waxed gross
[56:48] and their eye their ears are dull of
[56:50] hearing
[56:51] and their eyes they have closed lest at
[56:54] any time
[56:56] watch here's here it is here's what
[56:58] could save them
[57:00] lest at any time they should see with
[57:03] their eyes and hear with their ears and
[57:05] should understand with their heart
[57:07] and should be converted and i should
[57:09] heal them
[57:11] mark 4 here's what he says in mark 4
[57:13] verse 12
[57:15] that seeing they may see
[57:18] and not perceive right mark 4 12 that
[57:22] seeing they may see
[57:24] and not perceive and hearing they may
[57:27] hear
[57:27] and not understand lest at any time
[57:31] they should be converted and their sin
[57:33] should be forgiven them
[57:37] so how do i get my sins forgiven by
[57:39] hearing and receiving the word
[57:41] there is no other way and it's always
[57:44] been that way
[57:45] that's what it was for abel that's what
[57:47] it was for noah
[57:48] that's what it was for abraham the bible
[57:51] says
[57:52] the bible doesn't say abraham believed
[57:55] in god
[57:57] the devil believes in god the bible says
[58:01] abraham believed god what does that even
[58:04] mean
[58:04] god told him something and he believed
[58:06] it god gave him a word
[58:09] and revealed it to him and abraham
[58:11] believed it and god imputed
[58:13] righteousness to him
[58:16] not just that he believed in god but he
[58:18] believed what god told him
[58:21] and that's how his righteousness was
[58:24] imputed unto him
[58:27] amen john 5
[58:30] 24.
[58:33] giving josh a workout this morning i
[58:36] love it
[58:37] john 5 24 verily verily i say unto you

[59:03] condemnation he that heareth my word and
[59:06] believeth

[59:25] he heard it with his ear but he that
[59:28] heareth
[59:29] my word and believeth on him that sent
[59:32] me
[59:33] this is the one that is is out of
[59:35] condemnation this is the one who's
[59:37] passed
[59:37] from death unto life now let's go on
[59:40] down to verse 36 through 47
[59:42] john 5 36-47 but i have greater witness
[59:45] than that of john for the works which
[59:47] the father hath given me to finish
[59:50] the same works that i do bear witness of
[59:54] me
[59:54] that the father hath sent me and the
[59:57] father himself which hath sent me
[59:59] hath born witness of me ye have neither
[1:00:02] heard his voice at any time
[1:00:04] nor seen his shape and ye have not his
[1:00:08] word
[1:00:08] abiding in you for whom he hath sent
[1:00:11] him you believe not search the scripture
[1:00:14] for in them you think you have
[1:00:17] eternal life and they are they which
[1:00:20] testify
[1:00:21] of me so so we find that belief
[1:00:25] and acceptance of the word made
[1:00:28] flesh became the source
[1:00:32] of eternal life when the word jesus said
[1:00:36] you didn't believe me god sent me
[1:00:40] i am the word made flesh
[1:00:43] and because you don't believe that i'm
[1:00:46] the word made flesh
[1:00:47] then this is why you're going to die i
[1:00:50] am the word in a form
[1:00:52] you search the scripture you think you
[1:00:56] believe the word you went to bible
[1:01:00] school
[1:01:00] you think you believe the word but you
[1:01:02] don't receive it when it becomes alive
[1:01:04] in front of you
[1:01:05] yes amen see watch now
[1:01:10] verse 40 and ye will not come to me that
[1:01:14] you might have life
[1:01:16] i receive not honor for men but i know
[1:01:18] you that ye have not the love of god in
[1:01:20] you
[1:01:21] i am come in my father's name and you
[1:01:23] receive me not if another shall
[1:01:24] come in his own name him you will
[1:01:26] receive how can you believe
[1:01:29] which receive honor one of another and
[1:01:31] seek not the honor that cometh
[1:01:33] from god only do not think that i will
[1:01:36] accuse you to the father there is one
[1:01:37] that accuseth you
[1:01:39] even moses in whom you trust see
[1:01:42] for had you believed moses ye would have
[1:01:45] believed me
[1:01:46] for he wrote of me but if you believe
[1:01:48] not his writings
[1:01:50] how shall you believe my words now
[1:01:53] jesus this this is a two-way street
[1:01:56] jesus is qualifying
[1:01:58] their claim that they believe moses
[1:02:02] but he he's he's disproving that
[1:02:06] because they don't believe in him and he
[1:02:09] says well
[1:02:10] i'm only the manifestation of what he
[1:02:13] said so
[1:02:14] you can't claim to believe him and
[1:02:15] reject me
[1:02:17] you see what i'm saying so it doesn't
[1:02:19] matter you know
[1:02:20] when god reveals his word in every age
[1:02:24] down through all seven church ages that
[1:02:27] false church was constantly saying we're
[1:02:29] the church and they weren't
[1:02:31] and they were saying the real church
[1:02:32] wasn't and it was
[1:02:34] see but god had a messenger in every age
[1:02:37] to
[1:02:38] to to to save all of those who wanted to
[1:02:40] be saved
[1:02:42] everybody who would receive their word
[1:02:45] was in
[1:02:46] and whoever refused their word was out
[1:02:50] and that's what's happening here that's
[1:02:52] not a new thing
[1:02:54] this has always been the case since
[1:02:57] genesis
[1:02:58] i defy anyone to go anywhere in the
[1:03:00] bible and find any uh
[1:03:02] find even a single place where anyone
[1:03:05] any human man
[1:03:06] ever found acceptance before god by
[1:03:08] refusing his word
[1:03:11] it is impossible to find in the bible
[1:03:14] see now
[1:03:17] so so this now this is why
[1:03:22] so this is why john
[1:03:25] would come ah give me first
[1:03:28] john 1 and
[1:03:31] 7. this is why john
[1:03:34] who you just heard him with jesus sermon
[1:03:38] john's standing there writing down what
[1:03:39] he's saying
[1:03:39] you just read it this is why john could
[1:03:42] come in first john 1 7
[1:03:44] and say but if we walk in the light as
[1:03:47] he's in the light
[1:03:48] we have fellowship one with another in
[1:03:50] the blood of jesus christ his son
[1:03:51] cleanses us from all sin
[1:03:53] how do i get the blood of jesus how do i
[1:03:55] get cleansed from all sin by walking in
[1:03:56] the light
[1:03:58] see so but because the light was the
[1:04:00] life of men
[1:04:02] and the life was the light of men you
[1:04:05] follow me
[1:04:06] so so they go hand in hand all right now
[1:04:09] so so so john now back back to john 12
[1:04:12] all right let's go to john 12.
[1:04:14] josh and i got just two or three more so
[1:04:17] john 12 all right
[1:04:20] verse 34
[1:04:24] the people answered him we have heard
[1:04:27] out of the law
[1:04:28] that christ abideth forever and how
[1:04:32] sayest thou
[1:04:33] the son of man must be lifted up who is
[1:04:36] the son of man
[1:04:38] so i i'm gonna save some time
[1:04:41] go home and read john 12.
[1:04:45] because john 12 then is the basis that
[1:04:48] john in his epistles
[1:04:49] writes about he was the light of the
[1:04:51] world and in him was life
[1:04:54] amen this is how john could write
[1:04:56] because john heard the sermon
[1:04:58] in in the in the fifth chapter that of
[1:05:02] john
[1:05:02] and the 12th chapter of john and that's
[1:05:04] exactly why because
[1:05:06] what what you're going to find out what
[1:05:08] they're asking
[1:05:09] is who is this son of man that can
[1:05:12] forgive sins
[1:05:15] you keep talking about the son of man
[1:05:17] what is the son of man the word made
[1:05:18] flesh
[1:05:20] and with that comes forgiveness of sins
[1:05:23] that's why jesus said
[1:05:25] that that that judgment is granted to
[1:05:28] the son of man because he's the son of
[1:05:30] man
[1:05:31] so when god has revealed his word openly
[1:05:34] and plainly
[1:05:35] you only have one option and that's to
[1:05:38] say amen
[1:05:40] and allow that word to completely
[1:05:44] change your whole life
[1:05:47] and if you don't do that then all your
[1:05:50] faith in a historical event won't give
[1:05:52] you the new birth
[1:05:55] it won't i'm not saying you wouldn't be
[1:05:58] safe from destruction at the end because
[1:06:00] the unwise virgin don't get the new
[1:06:01] birth either they
[1:06:02] they reject the message and have to go
[1:06:04] on a tribulation i've preached on that
[1:06:06] three sermons prayer don't need to go
[1:06:08] over all that again we understand that
[1:06:09] of course
[1:06:10] the heathen will be raised up in the
[1:06:11] millennium to hear the gospel who never
[1:06:13] heard the gospel listen friends god's
[1:06:16] got this figured out if you just quit
[1:06:17] arguing against it
[1:06:18] and just realized god's got this he's
[1:06:21] got every question you could ever ask
[1:06:23] and ever wonder he's got a plan for it
[1:06:25] here's what you need to know i don't
[1:06:27] care what the circumstance looks like
[1:06:29] all his ways are right and all his words
[1:06:32] are true
[1:06:34] all his ways are just doesn't matter if
[1:06:37] it looks like injustice or inequality
[1:06:39] all of you don't know the whole story
[1:06:42] say well why
[1:06:43] what about this person well you don't
[1:06:44] know you don't know that person you know
[1:06:46] what's in their heart he does
[1:06:48] you don't know what happened in their
[1:06:49] secret time he does so
[1:06:51] so quit trying to figure out god's plan
[1:06:53] for him god god knows the
[1:06:55] everybody will get a fair trial anyway
[1:06:58] and he'll judge him by their heart it's
[1:07:01] not up to me
[1:07:02] all i can do is point you you know
[1:07:05] i suspect you're not here trying to
[1:07:08] figure out
[1:07:09] how to get eternal life after you go
[1:07:11] through the tribulation
[1:07:12] i suspect you're here to try to avoid a
[1:07:14] tribulation
[1:07:16] so i'm preaching to you how to do that
[1:07:19] amen i fair trial i don't want to trial
[1:07:22] fair or otherwise
[1:07:24] i want i want all my sins to go ahead of
[1:07:26] me so that by the time i get there it's
[1:07:28] already taken care of
[1:07:29] in christ jesus i don't have to answer
[1:07:31] for nothing
[1:07:32] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:07:36] thank god and and and what what does it
[1:07:38] take for me to get it
[1:07:40] faith in his word faith alone abraham
[1:07:42] believed god
[1:07:43] that was it that's all he could do
[1:07:45] that's all i can do
[1:07:46] i accept his word i accept his life it
[1:07:50] comes and it changes my whole heart
[1:07:51] there's nothing i can do to save myself
[1:07:55] all i can do is say amen to every word
[1:07:58] and that means i'm saying so be it
[1:08:00] unto me no matter what you say in your
[1:08:03] word lord so be it unto me
[1:08:05] i might stumble at it but i'll repent
[1:08:08] because i want it
[1:08:10] see so so then
[1:08:13] john you know so so so we find then that
[1:08:17] that john comes along
[1:08:20] and and and they're asking him you know
[1:08:23] who
[1:08:24] who is the son of man you know that that
[1:08:27] forgives sins all right
[1:08:29] let me get back to where i was
[1:08:32] all right let me get these last verses
[1:08:35] but go home and read that fifth chapter
[1:08:37] of john in that
[1:08:38] 12th chapter of john then go read first
[1:08:39] john and it'll all make sense to you
[1:08:42] all right so based on the things he
[1:08:44] heard
[1:08:46] he heard jesus teach in chapter 5 and
[1:08:49] chapter 12
[1:08:50] thus he comes to first john and that
[1:08:53] whole
[1:08:54] epistle is based on what he heard jesus
[1:08:57] preach
[1:08:59] his eagle anointing oftentimes caught
[1:09:02] more than the other three guardians of
[1:09:04] the tabernacle
[1:09:06] so all right second thessalonians
[1:09:07] brother josh here looks like
[1:09:09] a few just a few more second
[1:09:11] thessalonians 2 13.
[1:09:14] but we are bound to give thanks always
[1:09:18] to god for you brethren beloved of the
[1:09:20] lord
[1:09:21] because god hath from the beginning
[1:09:24] chosen you to
[1:09:25] salvation through sanctification of the
[1:09:29] spirit
[1:09:30] and belief of the truth amen
[1:09:34] hebrews 4 12 hebrews 4 12.
[1:09:37] for the word of god is quick and
[1:09:40] powerful
[1:09:41] is the word of god quick and powerful
[1:09:44] and
[1:09:44] sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:09:47] piercing
[1:09:48] even to the dividing asunder of soul and
[1:09:49] spirit and of the joints and marrow and
[1:09:51] as a discerner
[1:09:53] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:09:56] so it goes to a level past the spirit
[1:10:00] down to the heart that's where the new
[1:10:03] birth
[1:10:03] comes in that's why the unwise virgin
[1:10:06] are
[1:10:06] saved from destruction because they they
[1:10:09] do have sanctified spirits the bible
[1:10:13] calls them saints
[1:10:14] read revelation 15. jesus called him
[1:10:17] righteous the king called him righteous
[1:10:19] in matthew 25.
[1:10:20] these are righteous people these are
[1:10:22] sanctified people these are not people
[1:10:25] with a form of godliness meaning they go
[1:10:27] to church and raise their hands and sing
[1:10:29] songs
[1:10:30] but they the women dress like
[1:10:32] prostitutes and the men cuss and smoke
[1:10:34] and
[1:10:35] and that's not a saint that's not a
[1:10:38] saint at all
[1:10:40] that that's a child that that's a that's
[1:10:42] a child of the world
[1:10:45] who who is continuing with their fallen
[1:10:47] nature can they be converted
[1:10:49] sure that's why jesus died
[1:10:53] but but but let's get them the real
[1:10:55] version of
[1:10:56] jesus amen so
[1:10:59] so he so he so we find that it goes past
[1:11:02] the spirit down to their heart james 1
[1:11:04] 18. james 1 18.
[1:11:07] i'll give you these two more james 1
[1:11:11] 18 of his own will
[1:11:15] beget he us with the word of truth
[1:11:19] amen how did you get the new birth the
[1:11:21] word of truth
[1:11:23] say it again how did you get the new
[1:11:24] birth the word of truth
[1:11:27] that we should be a kind of first fruits
[1:11:30] of his creatures
[1:11:31] see in other words i become the
[1:11:33] continuation he was the beginning of a
[1:11:35] new creation i'm the continuation of
[1:11:37] that same creation
[1:11:39] see i'm in the first resurrection amen
[1:11:42] there's been a resurrection already
[1:11:44] christ came
[1:11:45] up see and there's gonna there's a
[1:11:47] there's a third exodus coming all right
[1:11:49] that was second exodus moses had the
[1:11:51] first exodus all right
[1:11:53] of his own will beget he us with the
[1:11:56] word of truth
[1:11:56] that we should be a kind of firstfruits
[1:11:58] of his creatures in other words
[1:12:00] he gave me the new birth so i could be
[1:12:02] like him amen
[1:12:03] he doesn't give the new birth so you can
[1:12:05] stay you
[1:12:08] understand so he gives you the new birth
[1:12:10] so that you
[1:12:12] can be like him
[1:12:16] i mean i i listen friends if if you just
[1:12:19] think that through
[1:12:21] and be very sincere
[1:12:25] you can't make yourself into him amen
[1:12:30] that's that's one of the themes of my
[1:12:32] whole sermon today
[1:12:34] you can't make yourself into him he will
[1:12:37] remake you
[1:12:38] into him all you can do is be willing to
[1:12:41] stop being you
[1:12:44] that's all you can do all you can do
[1:12:47] is be willing to stop being you
[1:12:52] and let him make you into him
[1:12:56] see so all right
[1:13:00] first peter 1 first peter 1
[1:13:03] brother josh get this last one verse 22
[1:13:07] and 23
[1:13:09] first peter 1 22 and 23 seeing ye have
[1:13:12] purified your what
[1:13:15] what louder souls
[1:13:19] seeing ye have purified your souls
[1:13:22] and obeying the truth through the
[1:13:26] spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[1:13:29] brother
[1:13:29] see that you love one another with a
[1:13:31] pure heart fervently brother kenny was
[1:13:33] talking about that very thing today
[1:13:35] being born again not of corruptible seed
[1:13:39] but of incorruptible by the word
[1:13:43] of god which liveth and abideth
[1:13:46] forever how are you born again
[1:13:49] in the soul by a love of the word
[1:13:53] amen there is no other option
[1:13:57] brother branham says here okay take that
[1:13:59] down read this quote and we're going to
[1:14:00] stop
[1:14:04] read you this this quote stand up with
[1:14:05] me and i'll read it to you
[1:14:08] brother kenny bring your team back now
[1:14:10] don't run out i want you to get this
[1:14:11] last quote
[1:14:13] all right listen to this
[1:14:17] blasphemous names brother branham would
[1:14:18] call it blasphemous names
[1:14:22] now brother branham is talking about the
[1:14:26] virtues that peter spoke of
[1:14:29] remember faith virtue knowledge patience
[1:14:32] temperance meekness
[1:14:33] amen so you have all of these virtues
[1:14:36] now watch what he says here patience
[1:14:38] and so forth all right there's a mockery
[1:14:42] of it
[1:14:43] you believe that there's a mockery of
[1:14:46] patience remember a form of godliness
[1:14:48] but denies the power
[1:14:49] denies brother i'm saying denies the
[1:14:51] living reality of it
[1:14:53] what what's what does what's the outcome
[1:14:55] of denying the living reality because it
[1:14:57] can never change my life
[1:14:59] all right patience and so forth
[1:15:02] there's a mockery of it a pretending to
[1:15:05] be
[1:15:06] a a a nature given faith
[1:15:10] a nature given virtue there's a nature
[1:15:14] given temperance
[1:15:16] all of these things are nature given
[1:15:19] and the biggest part of art now watch
[1:15:21] and the biggest part of our faith
[1:15:23] is mental faith all right
[1:15:26] by hearing the word it brings us to a
[1:15:29] mental recognition of god
[1:15:32] but if this coming from above
[1:15:36] oh brother if it ever strikes
[1:15:39] this there is a godly
[1:15:42] spiritual faith then what does that
[1:15:46] faith do that faith recognizes only the
[1:15:49] word
[1:15:50] no matter what else anything else says
[1:15:54] it only recognizes the word because
[1:15:57] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:16:00] word was with god
[1:16:01] and the word was god and the word is
[1:16:04] still god
[1:16:05] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:16:07] among us and when the word itself
[1:16:09] is pouring into our faith our mental
[1:16:12] faith
[1:16:13] becomes spiritual revelation
[1:16:18] and upon this foundation i'll build
[1:16:21] my church not upon a mental conception
[1:16:24] of joining
[1:16:25] church joining a mental conception of
[1:16:27] that but upon the revelation
[1:16:29] when them streams of grace has poured
[1:16:31] into that mental faith that you've got
[1:16:34] then upon this a spiritual revelation
[1:16:37] i'll build my church and the gates of
[1:16:39] hell
[1:16:40] can't prevail against it see that shows
[1:16:43] they would be against it but it'll never
[1:16:46] prevail
[1:16:47] what a glorious thing now see the faith
[1:16:51] see it proves if jesus said
[1:16:56] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:16:59] against it
[1:16:59] brother man says well then that means
[1:17:01] the gates of hell are going to be
[1:17:02] against it
[1:17:03] so the gates of hell are against
[1:17:07] people getting spiritual revelation
[1:17:10] he doesn't mind them getting mental
[1:17:13] faith in a story
[1:17:16] but that and and there's value in that
[1:17:19] there's value in that don't ever think
[1:17:20] there's not
[1:17:21] telling the story of jesus just somebody
[1:17:23] reading the gospels
[1:17:24] there's value in that they're the unwise
[1:17:27] virgin
[1:17:28] inherit eternal life because of that
[1:17:32] but if you want to pass from death unto
[1:17:33] life now
[1:17:35] it's got to go on to you've got to
[1:17:39] follow on to know the bible says we
[1:17:41] shall know
[1:17:43] if we follow on to know have you ever
[1:17:46] thought about apollos
[1:17:49] apollos had already accepted that jesus
[1:17:51] was the messiah
[1:17:53] i was proving it mightily by the
[1:17:55] scriptures
[1:17:56] and but so how how do we know
[1:18:00] that apollo's faith was real because
[1:18:03] when he preached aquila and priscilla
[1:18:06] who had the baptism of the holiest and
[1:18:08] had a more perfect understanding
[1:18:09] took him home for lunch and sat down
[1:18:12] with him across a table
[1:18:16] and instructed him more perfectly
[1:18:19] and apollos accepted it and then is he
[1:18:22] done no
[1:18:23] then he's going through the upper coast
[1:18:25] of ephesus and runs into paul
[1:18:27] he don't have the holy ghost yet he's
[1:18:29] he's
[1:18:30] he's living a sanctified life he's
[1:18:32] proving christ out of the out of the
[1:18:33] scriptures he's not even he's not even
[1:18:35] born again yet
[1:18:36] and paul curious that's that's strange
[1:18:40] how are you baptized well we were
[1:18:42] baptized by john
[1:18:43] oh but no wonder that's why
[1:18:47] because well well why does that matter
[1:18:48] paul well because john
[1:18:50] came before calvary just to tell people
[1:18:53] that the messiah is here he he christ
[1:18:56] was a keystone between the old and the
[1:18:57] new
[1:18:57] but now he's already come he's died was
[1:19:00] buried rose ascended
[1:19:01] came back with his spirit into the
[1:19:03] church and paulus was
[1:19:05] like oh would i what do i need to do
[1:19:08] i'll have to re-baptize you no problem
[1:19:10] let's go right now
[1:19:12] what did he do he kept following he kept
[1:19:14] following
[1:19:15] and that following brought him to a new
[1:19:17] birth and that made him a contemporary
[1:19:20] of saint paul
[1:19:25] i mean what do you think would have been
[1:19:27] apollo's outcome
[1:19:29] had he just stan had he said to aquila
[1:19:31] and priscilla
[1:19:33] sorry i've got enough i've got all i
[1:19:36] need
[1:19:37] and when he went to paul and paul said
[1:19:38] you need to be re-baptized i don't need
[1:19:40] to do that paul
[1:19:41] i already believe in jesus i'm i can
[1:19:43] prove it better than you can i'm a
[1:19:44] better preacher than you
[1:19:46] d do you want you think apollos would
[1:19:48] have ended up in the
[1:19:49] heavens gospel hall of fame no no
[1:19:53] i can tell you what his christian the cr
[1:19:55] the history of the christian church
[1:19:57] would have had a lot different to say
[1:19:58] about apollos
[1:20:00] see he you shall know
[1:20:03] if you follow on to know oh
[1:20:07] praise the lord i i love
[1:20:10] what god has done for me in this hour
[1:20:13] now today friends
[1:20:14] listen i have proven to you
[1:20:17] out of the bible back and forth back and
[1:20:20] forth
[1:20:21] you cannot save yourself
[1:20:26] you can't save anybody you can't save
[1:20:28] you much less anybody else
[1:20:30] there's no works you can do stop chasing
[1:20:33] that stop trying to get
[1:20:35] to stop trying to find a satisfied
[1:20:37] feeling
[1:20:38] by working for the lord
[1:20:42] surrender if you're if you're if you're
[1:20:45] still chasing that you've got levels of
[1:20:47] surrender that you haven't reached yet
[1:20:50] because i can tell you something you
[1:20:51] surrender your way into the love of god
[1:20:53] at such a level in your heart
[1:20:55] you you you you'll do works
[1:20:58] works will follow but it but you won't
[1:21:01] you won't feel dependent upon those
[1:21:03] works
[1:21:04] you'll you'll work for the master
[1:21:06] because it'll just be second nature to
[1:21:08] you
[1:21:10] has nothing you don't you don't get his
[1:21:12] approval
[1:21:13] by chasing works you can't do that it
[1:21:15] means nothing to him
[1:21:17] there's you do good deeds sure laws are
[1:21:20] reaping and sowing
[1:21:21] yeah you give and it'll be given to you
[1:21:24] you you are merciful and you'll receive
[1:21:26] mercy and i mean the laws of reaping and
[1:21:29] sowing sure
[1:21:30] but i i'm not here just to just just to
[1:21:33] get his blessings i wanted him
[1:21:36] ruth wasn't just satisfied with the
[1:21:39] blessings of boaz
[1:21:40] she wanted boaz because she know if she
[1:21:42] got him in marriage
[1:21:44] she got all these blessings and all the
[1:21:46] field and all the servants that were
[1:21:47] dropping them she got everything
[1:21:50] amen so that's what we want friends and
[1:21:52] you can't do it by works
[1:21:54] we're saved by faith
[1:21:57] alone no other way
[1:22:01] faith in god's revealed word
[1:22:04] is the only path to redemption
[1:22:08] now to believe it differently you just
[1:22:10] have to accept
[1:22:12] dogma and creed of denominational
[1:22:14] thinking you need
[1:22:15] a different bible because this bible
[1:22:18] doesn't teach that
[1:22:19] that's what satan that's the lie he's
[1:22:22] told the world
[1:22:23] and it's up to us to tell them the truth
[1:22:27] and the best way as i preach three
[1:22:29] services the best way you can tell them
[1:22:32] the truth
[1:22:33] is live it let them
[1:22:36] see that you're claiming
[1:22:39] that this revelation won't just make you
[1:22:42] join a church and stop
[1:22:43] lying this revelation will affect
[1:22:46] every facet of your life you will move
[1:22:50] talk walk dress do appeal
[1:22:54] participate involvement your everything
[1:22:57] you do your whole motive and objective
[1:23:00] to life
[1:23:01] itself will be to be a servant of god
[1:23:05] and to shine forth his love to a world
[1:23:08] listen friends they're they're under a
[1:23:10] misunderstanding if we don't tell them
[1:23:12] about it who will
[1:23:14] see we're the only ones that that know
[1:23:16] what the misunderstanding is
[1:23:18] not because we were smarter or or
[1:23:20] smelled better
[1:23:21] but because that we believed the report
[1:23:25] when it came and god hath accepted our
[1:23:28] faith
[1:23:29] and changed our lives amen by your heads
[1:23:31] with me
[1:23:34] father i thank you and i feel so
[1:23:37] thrilled to know as i stand here today
[1:23:42] i don't have to chase anything i don't
[1:23:45] have to be any certain thing
[1:23:50] i just have to be willing to stop being
[1:23:52] me
[1:23:53] and let you make me into you
[1:23:56] there's nothing i can do lord there's
[1:23:58] nothing there's nothing i can achieve
[1:24:01] to earn it lord we've got to give the
[1:24:04] right message to the world that
[1:24:08] dressing a certain way or living a
[1:24:11] certain way or going to a certain church
[1:24:14] that if it's just the way if it's just
[1:24:16] works of
[1:24:17] man there's a value to sanctified living
[1:24:21] there's certainly a value and it will
[1:24:25] save people from destruction
[1:24:28] but if you want to be born again if you
[1:24:31] want to pass from death to life
[1:24:34] if you want to have your nature changed
[1:24:36] and be a new creation in christ
[1:24:39] the only way to do that is god's
[1:24:41] provided approach
[1:24:42] and that's faith in his word alone
[1:24:47] faith in his revealed word
[1:24:51] alone i thank you that you
[1:24:55] gave us back the full revealed word
[1:24:59] so that we can become the full image so
[1:25:02] that we can be the full continuation
[1:25:04] [Music]
[1:25:06] of your word for 2000 years it waned
[1:25:09] left and right
[1:25:11] and it looked kind of like it it wasn't
[1:25:13] exactly like it but you promised in the
[1:25:15] last days
[1:25:16] you would not bring something new you
[1:25:19] would restore the original
[1:25:21] and the originally the word the original
[1:25:24] word restored
[1:25:26] would restore the original life and that
[1:25:29] would restore the original church
[1:25:31] and that would restore original power
[1:25:34] that would restore
[1:25:36] an uh original thinking and a people who
[1:25:40] are willing
[1:25:41] to to obey willingly obey
[1:25:44] everything in your word thank you for it
[1:25:47] lord i stand here today with such
[1:25:48] confidence in your word i want to be
[1:25:52] a spiritual believer i don't want to
[1:25:54] just
[1:25:56] be fond of the fine qualities of jesus
[1:25:59] he had a lot of fine qualities to
[1:26:00] emulate
[1:26:01] but i want more than that lord i'm i'm
[1:26:04] happy for anyone who wants to do that
[1:26:05] but there's more
[1:26:06] more to be had
[1:26:10] maybe maybe with all heads bowed maybe
[1:26:13] you're here today and
[1:26:15] you've never known him at all and you'd
[1:26:17] like to
[1:26:19] it's easy it's not complicated
[1:26:22] you don't have to do anything but accept
[1:26:24] it accept your own death
[1:26:27] and receive his life and to say lord
[1:26:30] come into my life right now and come
[1:26:32] into my heart
[1:26:32] and change me completely make me into
[1:26:36] you
[1:26:36] i don't want to be me and if and if your
[1:26:40] faith is genuine and you really mean
[1:26:42] that
[1:26:42] he will accept it he promised he would
[1:26:46] and you will pass from death to life
[1:26:48] you'll become a new creation in christ
[1:26:50] jesus
[1:26:51] all your old life and desires will pass
[1:26:55] away
[1:26:55] and all your desires will become new
[1:26:58] that's how you'll know
[1:26:59] that you've passed from death into life
[1:27:01] because it will manifest itself
[1:27:03] in the way you live and breathe and go
[1:27:05] about your day
[1:27:07] and maybe maybe you're here today and
[1:27:09] you've already
[1:27:10] had an acceptance of the christ of
[1:27:12] calvary but
[1:27:14] you're unclear about the fullness of his
[1:27:16] word
[1:27:17] you're like apollos today maybe you just
[1:27:20] need to follow on a little more
[1:27:23] i'm here to tell you he's willing
[1:27:26] he's willing to take you on into the
[1:27:28] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:27:29] willing to take you on in the
[1:27:31] understanding of the word for this hour
[1:27:34] father i pray you'll do it today if
[1:27:36] there be anybody here
[1:27:38] lord and then lord
[1:27:41] maybe we should also include
[1:27:44] those who have already passed from death
[1:27:46] and to life

[1:27:50] could climb a little higher and be a
[1:27:52] little closer
