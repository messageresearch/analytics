just looking forward to What the Lord Has for us tonight amen that's that's what we're here for us to hear from him amen I I just spotted you there buddy hey man if you have your Bibles this evening let's look in the Book of Leviticus the 25th chapter we want to look in Leviticus and also we have a couple other places we'd like to read in the scripture Leviticus 25 I totally lost it in my ear Leviticus 25 and then we're going to look in the New Testament there it is that's good Leviticus 25 and I know this is a very very familiar reading we just want tonight to pull some things from here and just have a simple thought here on my heart but I was actually going to go a whole different direction and the Lord dealt with my heart early Friday morning to speak this thought so we just pray it'll be a blessing to you and if we read the word let's just buy our hearts together and I wonder maybe if you wouldn't mind just to lay your hand over on someone next to you brother to brother sister to sister husband to wife in a Godly order and let's just speak to him and let's invite him to come I believe that there's an anointing when the Believers come together in unity don't you Heavenly Father Lord As We Gather here this afternoon father we are very well aware that we're not here by ourselves we're not here in a room taking up space Lord feelings feeling pews and singing songs playing instruments but Lord we're in a supernatural moment we're in a supernatural Place Lord father we're here in the presence of you and you are the Living God and Lord we know that your word said where two or three are gathered together in my name you sit there I will come and be in their midst and Lord I know here this evening as I look around there's more than two or three here but Lord there's a whole house full of Believers Lord as I look across this congregation Lord father familiar faces Lord of Believers Lord that have gathered here this evening father I recognize that I as a man I have nothing Lord that I could offer this people that would be of any benefit from a human ability but Lord I recognize that you sent a message and that message is supreme authority and Lord if we'll release our faith in the presence of the anointing then Lord sicknesses are already healed Jesus are already cured Lord demons are already defeated Lord As We Gather here tonight Lord as we've enjoyed the fellowship the days leading up to this moment now Lord as we Endeavor to open your word Lord we invite the spirit of wisdom and Revelation to come into the building oh god father may you drive out every Spirit that's unlike the Holy Spirit Lord may you bring a peace and a calm into every heart here tonight Lord that we could look away from our troubles we could look away from our situations we could look away from the trials and the things of life and we could look away to Jesus tonight and Lord as we look to you then your Prophet said we will receive strength as we look to you Lord I pray you would bless this assembly o god father may you bless our brother Jason may you bless this assembly may you Lord continue to give him the desires of their heart Lord reward them o God and Lord we'll just give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it to do thy Wonderful Name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says a man and amen The Book of Leviticus the 25th chapter and in the eighth verse the Bible says Thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee 40 and nine years so 49 years then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month and the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and ye shall Hollow the 50th year notice this and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof and it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and he shall return every man unto his family now watch the Jubilee unto you you shall return every man unto his possession so he's not going to something foreign he's going back to what's rightfully he is ye shall return every man unto his family so not going to a new family going back to his original family a jubilee shall the 50th year be unto you you shall not Soul neither reap that which goeth of itself in it Lord Gathering the grapes in a Divine undressed notice this for it is the Jubilee and it shall be holy unto you and ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field and in the Year of Jubilee you shall return somebody say return you shall return every man unto his possession in the Year of Jubilee you shall return every man unto his possession now in the Book of Luke the fourth chapter I want to read Luke's gospel the fourth chapter another very a very familiar reading to you in Luke the fourth chapter in the 16th verse we know a study in the message this is Brother brahm's text for this day this scripture is fulfilled and he comes to the 16th verse of Luke 4 and the Bible said and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for it to read now there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written when he had opened the book somebody said well the opening the book is not in the Bible I have just read to you where the prophet of God takes this text to preach this day this scripture fulfilled and the Very words is he opened the book found the place where it was written and said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives recovering of sight to the blind to sit at Liberty them of the bruised and to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears amen this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and one other place I want to look with you is in John the eighth chapter John the eighth chapter another very familiar reading in John the eighth chapter and the 36th verse just one verse there Jesus here speaking again he says if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed amen how many believes that here we ask the Lord to add the blessing to reading of his word as you can be seated here this afternoon I also want to say God bless you brother Samuel it sure is good to see you and amen in The Book of Leviticus there The Book of Luke The Book of John I want to if I can to speak to you tonight from those passages of scripture and if I title this tonight I want to speak to you on the hour of Jubilee amen the hour of Jubilee brother Branham preaches three messages on the word uh Jubilee He preaches Jubilee year he preaches the Azusa Jubilee and then he preaches return in Jubilee and in 1962 he's preaching return in Jubilee in paragraph 32 he says now is the hour of Jubilee so not in the past not in the present amen but now is the hour of Jubilee He said come back to your original inheritance to a real Holy Ghost again so now is the hour amen of Jubilee to come back to your inheritance your original inheritance Amen to a real Holy Ghost again so therefore he could say return in Jubilee now when you look at this word return it has a powerful definition it means to bring back it means to allow to return to put back to drawback give back restore it means to relinquish one's rights given payment to bring back to refresh to restore the the word Jubilee is another very powerful word it is a special anniversary of an event especially one celebrating 25 or 50 years amen of a Reign or activity so when brother bam is actually preaching returning jubilees preaching in 1962 at Jack Morris in Shreveport and he's actually there in a celebration of when the Holy Ghost fail and he said it's been 50 years since the Holy Ghost fell and he said now watch when the Holy Ghost fail it fell in a barn he said as a type of women when the Lord came to the Earth he said he was born and he said in a in a barn and a cow stable he said showing you that the Holy Ghost is coming to places that are humble but yet they will receive him not he's not going to the dignitaries he's not going to the to the fancy to the high polish but he's going to places amen that will receive him and they will welcome him in the power amen and not try to change him amen but they will allow him to be who he is when he comes on the scene now in the message he turns you believe again he said that Jubilee was God's manner of expressing Grace to his people amen for restoring or being brought back to their rightful position amen so Jubilee was God's grace being expressed to his people of being restored or brought back to their rightful position he said now I believe that this is the hour again of Jubilee He said I believe it's the time of Jubilee can we can we agree there it's the hour of Jubilee it's the it's the time of Jubilee it's the season of Jubilee He said the hour again of Jubilee now if there's been an hour again of Jubilee that means somewhere sometime amen there's been a jubilee amen and if there is another Jubilee then there's one in the future so there has been a jubilee amen there is a jubilee and according to a prophet he said we are headed for another great Jubilee so amen no matter what you're facing tonight no matter what you're going through no matter what situations and and battles and disappointments are plagued in your life amen as the Bride of Jesus Christ you have not been called amen unto bondage and Corruption and destruction and defilement of laodicea but you have been called anointed and positionally placed Amen in the Jubilee of God's word this hour is in the hour of Jubilee Abraham said many years has passed amen but the same God that sent the Jubilee in them days amen is the same God who sins the Jubilee today so therefore it's not a man bringing the Jubilee amen but it's God bringing the Jubilee brother Brandman off the scene nearly 60 years amen and we're still in a jubilee amen because the Jubilee is not coming from a man it's not coming from a church amen but the Jubilee is coming amen from the opening of the word and the age that we're living in what we need today my Christian friend is a jubilee time he said the devil has taken many Believers captive during this time for instance coldness and worldliness has slipped into the church but the thing we're here for today is in celebration of the old-fashioned Holy Ghost revivals that we used to have he said I hear our fathers talk about how the Angels Came Down amen and sang in the meetings now listen friends amen you you you've heard your song Leader's voice you've heard your preacher's voice amen you've even heard your voice but when is the last time amen you've been in a meeting and the angels come down amen and you didn't just hear Brother Tony's Voice or brother Jason's voice amen but you was actually hearing the voice of angels amen that was singing you say well preacher that's far out let me say this message is not a pipe dream this message is not something that was hatched out of one Walt Disney amen but this message is a reality amen and if it's a message of reality then it's coming to a people amen that are not the Sons and Daughters of fiction amen but they are children of Reality by the word amen that God is restored in the age of living him he said the Angels came down and saying and the power of God taken over and the Saints were born again and great things happen it comes from the old-fashioned backwards sky blue sin killing preacher the old sassafras type maybe men didn't even know their ABCs but they know Christ and they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said that's what we hunger for today is an old-fashioned baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and a pouring out of God's blessing amen let me say this revival is a promise in this message I meant a renewing from the presence of God is a promise in this message amen are refreshing from the presence of God is a promise in this message people say well amen we need a Revival I agree we don't just need a Revival once a year we don't just need a Revival twice a year amen but I believe I'm just going to preach since I'm here amen I believe we've come to a time where it doesn't take a special meeting Amen to enjoy the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost I believe we've come to a time where it don't take a special evangelist coming through town amen and announcing getting a bunch of people together amen but we have broke out into a dimension with God Amen that Wednesday nights can be conventions amen Sunday mornings can be special meaning amen this message is not limited to just a preacher amen or to a location amen but this is the message of the king amen it's the message of Resurrection it's the message of power it's the message of redemption this message is not looking for your education it's not looking for your abilities this message is looking amen for somebody who give their voice Amen to the infallible proofs of the resurrection of what Jesus Christ has done in our age and will give themselves to it and as you give yourself to it it will lift you up into a dimension where you can see things amen beyond the way the world sees them amen you can believe things beyond the way denomination please somebody told me one time they said well this message is different I said Thank God Amen we finally got something amen that's different than what the Harlot system is saying and what her prostitute daughters are saying amen we have received amen the Fulfillment of the word and the age we're living in and it's a sound that you believe then we need a Revival but I'll say this we don't need a new building to have a Revival we don't need a new Bible to have a Revival we don't need a new choir to have a Revival amen we need a rededication and a re-outpouring of the Holy Ghost amen the same God that sent you believe in the days of Azusa is the same God right here in Buford South Carolina on a Saturday night Amen to fulfill the promise of this work listen we're not here ain't been wasting time we're not here going in circles amen but as Christians were on a walk in this Jubilee we're on a walk believing this message we're on a walk Amen in our walk on this Earth as a Christian amen is more important than we realize our walk as a Christian is more you say why do we need a Revival why do we need to refreshing why do we need to renew him amen because our walk as a Christian is more important than we realize amen we should never brother said build the campfire in the same place twice listen you may you might have been here Wednesday night brother Jason sharing with me what a powerful service you had you say brother Andrew amen since Wednesday I've only taken a centimeter of a stand I say thank God for the centimeter amen well brother Andrew I didn't take a foot or I didn't take two feet amen if you took a step and then you're a step further today amen than you was yesterday listen amen how did they take the land amen one step at a time and how are you going to take the promises that God has given you amen is going to take one step by another step by another step listen this is not a walk of feeling this is not a walk of sensation this is not a walk of emotion amen this is a walk that Paul spoke of when he said we walk by faith and not by side amen then you may not feel like walking amen but in not you gotta walk anyhow amen you may not feel him around you amen but you gotta get up and face another day come on I feel like preaching here for a second amen we're gonna walk like he not church and one of these mornings we're going to leave the dimension of time and our bodies are going to be changed and we're going to take off corruption and we're going to put on incorruption we're going to lay aside this Mortal and we're going to put on immortality you say how are we going to do it amen we're going to do it by the word and it's been fulfilled in the age we're living amen we're not walking by the way we feel we're not walking by the way others think about us amen we're walking by the Sea of the Lord and it's been released to this generation it's a part of our inheritance our Christian walk is a part of our inheritance I love what the Bible said in Revelation 3 4 in the sardisan church age which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in White NOW Watch the next words for they are worthy it didn't say because they felt like they was worthy it because they are worthy amen and they shall walk with me he said that is what God says he will bestow upon them for this upright walk that is a part of their inheritance that he has reserved for them now watch this it is an inheritance that has been reserved see if they were willing to walk with him through the tolls and snares of life and be an honor to him he was going to reward them because he is not forgetful of our labor of love as God will always recompense us amen for our efforts to please him amen that as a Christian you gotta walk amen and that walk is a part of your inheritance Amen in that inheritance is not open to anybody amen but that is Heritage is reserved to those amen that have been called to walk this walk among you remember the prophets that God had that woman in the dream she said I can walk this walking high-heeled shoes he said go ahead and try it he said next thing I sing she was falling off somewhere amen because you can't walk this walk amen unless you're walking the way of prophet talks and if a prophet said do this you ought to do it and if he said don't do that you shouldn't do it amen this is not a choice walk amen this is a Grace walk and you know what I say on the first night of this meeting I say thank God for the grace Amen to walk with this message amen when you don't understand it just still walk with it amen when you can't put all the eyes and T's and using everything together but in your soul it's a gene seed of God Amen that didn't come from a church it didn't come from a system but it came from almighty God and that seed has been lodged Into Your Heart by God's unpredestinated unmerited favor and there ain't enough devils in your past ain't enough devils in your present and there ain't enough devils in your future Amen to remove you amen from this walk listen friends just keep on walking amen cause one of these days amen the word that we're feeding on it's going to change our bodies and we're going to be like Enoch and we're going to be gone in the moment in the twinkle of an eye well it's a reality to me it's not an emotion it's a revelation it's not a sensation it's a verse say of the Lord if you'll walk with me in the hard times if you'll walk with me in the difficult come on I know I'm talking to some Warriors here you've had to walk with God when it wasn't easy to walk you've had to trust him when it wasn't easy to trust him amen but why are you on the other side tonight amen because you walked with him when you could not trace him amen but there was a seed in your soul that said God I will trust you I will trust you when I cannot Trace you I will trust you in the answer against me you know it's the truth it's the truth it's a walk thank you brother it's a walk oh no did I knock that over okay thank God that reputation followed me down here I've knocked over a base a cello and a violin we just need a guitar right no bro now the life that we're living here present is reflecting our inheritance in the future in First Corinthians 15 40 that there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another I remember saying question answers 54. I believe in the church here there's a role here I can hear Liv's mortal being so in this role lives mortal beings each one of us in this great conglomeration of gaiety Blackness and darkness he said Mortals live in here now they are influenced either from this away or from that away see you cannot have here be a spiritual being sinner of saints without having an influence from the underworld or the above world so we have just identified amen where the inheritance in the future is laying according to the way you're walking amen if you're walking a certain way then you're being influenced from the underworld if you're walking another way you're being influenced from above world if you're an influence from here amen then you're from above and your celestial your body is waiting up here but if you're Wicked hypocritical and different then your Celestial body is down here regardless of how much you think it's up here because they're fruit that you bear before the pre people proves where you're from so you can't think it's up there and make it be there but the life you're living here is a testimony of The Inheritance that's laying in the future so you are here what you are somewhere else I'm on church amen I heard Birmingham say yesterday he said death is not changing so good or bad he said the only thing death does is change the dwelling place amen so if you lived a bad life amen death ain't all of a sudden going to make you live a good life and put you in a good place Amen brother Joe death is just going to change amen you from here Amen to the place where your inheritance is you're reflecting while you were living He said see you life that you live here is just reflecting what inheritance is when you leave here so if you want to know what kind of inheritance you've got in the future amen look at the life you're living now you say well preacher the life I lived in the past don't look good I'm not talking about the life before the blood I'm talking about the life after the blood amen because amen if we're going before the blood we're ever one influence from the under world if we're going from before the blood wherever one on our way to hell if we're going before the blood we're not worthy to stand in the Shekinah glory amen that I say thank God for the blood amen that divorced us from the old nature that we was born in and introduced us to a new Nature by the baptism of the Holy Ghost listen I want to put you on notice we've had a jubilee amen we're in it you believe amen but lift up your head we're headed for another great Jubilee it may be bad but I got Jubilee in my future I know my body may not feel good but I got Jubilee in my future listen how could I believe what I believe and not be happy about it come on Church how can I Hear What I Hear on these tapes and not have an amen in my how can I sit in a study and hear a prophet say one of these days you're going to feel a cold sweet go across your body and in the moment in the twinkling of an eye you're going to change the mentions how can I hear that and still look like everything's against me listen it's not going to happen based on the way I feel it's going to happen based on the word that is said it has happened because the word I'm preaching is the infallible perfect word of God and it will defeat the Devil anywhere Anytime Anyplace under any condition amen the word of God will release the children we've had it to believe we're in and you believe amen but lift up your hands and rejoice we're headed for another great Jubilee the grave is not our goal layout of sea is not our home lukewarmness is not our identity we did not come from this world and we're not going back to this world but we have come from another Civilization by aging seed of God God oh we're headed for another great Jubilee what are you saying preacher I'm saying amen God wants his church to be free God wants his church to be free you say now you better be careful amen well let's look what a prophet said he said Lord we pray for those who are sick and needy those who are bound in chairs and cots and stretchers Thou Art more willing listen there are more willing to set them free tonight if that little spark of Faith amen which they are now fumbling around in their heart amen let it catch a fire lord like a like a kindling amen wood to the promise of God Amen the spark of Faith that's in your heart it doesn't need a hot good to her to anoint it it doesn't need a fancy song to anoint him come on Church you know what I'm talking about amen just start preaching this message uh glory to come here I might as well preach amen just start preaching this message and watch the angel of God Amen come in the room on a Saturday night and he'll come in this Dimension and he'll clear out demons he'll clear out spirits of unbelief he will rebuke Demons of depression come on he will push back formal Spirit you know why because he's got a blessing for you and he's got your name on it amen then if your name brother getting is on your blessing amen I can't have it and if my name is on my blessing you can't have it amen but we have got a blessing here tonight that is not coming from this 16 element realm amen have lied and cost me cash hey remember this coming from an eternal Dimension listen we're two Earthbound Church there's a Heavenly world and it's all around us I say oh God let our eyes amen catch a sight of that other dimension that we can see that you believe we can see the Jubilee listen I can see the Jubilee somebody said one time they survander why do you keep on preaching the message amen like you do because I've seen this message work I've seen it break Spirits I've seen it come in cold dead churches you say well now you got to be careful amen I'll tell you what I believe I believe any church that ain't preaching this message is dead come on you don't judge a church based on the music you don't judge a church based on running the house and speaking in tongues and seeing prophecies and vision you judge a church by the word amen but here's the thing about it amen God didn't call me to travel the country amen judging churches he called me to preach the word and I've been ordained by God to preach a message and I know this message amen will paralyze every devil it'll drive back every Coast Spirit it'll bring a Revival it'll bring a heart worship Revival in the hardest church member it'll bring a fire in the coldest young person it'll break the chains of addiction also the oldest church member because it's the word that has been fulfilled in the age we're living in it's a word of Jubilee it's a word of anointing it's a word about amen don't you reduce this message down there's some little feeling or sensation or emotion this message is the power of God and the Salvation it's the power to break the change oh God let the fire of God catch a hold of your heart and let that fire get near them promises and in a few minutes the Fire or the word of God will move you from bondage to Liberty oh brother Andrew I don't know if I'm asked the question he repeats Jesus from Luke 18 and says will I find faith when I come the Earth he said Lord you never asked will I find church members will I find Creeds listen he never even asked will I find sincerity you said well I find faith when I come to this earth amen go study and only ones at the end time he said well I find Faith or will I find the word fulfilled come on Church the faith of God in this hour is the Fulfillment of the word of the Hour See Lord May these sick people let their faith loose just now and if they turn their faith loose then the sickness will have to turn loose show me and I believe in Mark 16 laying on his hands amen but show me where between turning your faith loose and the devil turning loose amen was a hand laid on you come on church and then show me where between turning your faith loose amen and coming through a prayer line though I believe in him had many will have more but show me where amen he said it he didn't say he said turn your faith loose and the minute you turn your faithful loose amen the devil will turn Loose as well amen he will leave his holy and they'll be set free by the power of the almighty God you say preacher why amen did you say let my faith loose then the devil will turn loose amen because when two men shake hands amen that means they're walking in agreement amen and the devil of your Affliction is not going to shake hands amen with the almighty God of your faith and then them walk in agreement amen but if you get a hold of Faith the devil turns loose of your body if you'll get a hold of the Word of Promise amen the devil turns loose for your children listen I know there's some bad situations amen but when did we stop believing in a God who could change the situation at any moment any second anytime listen I know you may not think it is happening but I'm going to tell you by the word it is amen while the word is being preached amen things are taking place you may not see it you may not feel it but that does not change the fact that it's happening oh yeah let the holy ghost search every heart baptize Every Soul heal everybody that's in divine presence now listen friends if Mark 16 be the truth it says they shall what lay hands on the sick and I believe it's the truth they shall cast out devils in my name I believe it's the truth then I heard the prophet say today he said I come here with orders from the Lord he said the Church of the Living God is Freeborn of the spirit of God don't need any denomination they follow the king of the Messianic and Kingdom they don't have to take people's things they they're Freeborn made free by the son who makes them free indeed these signs shall follow them now you say brother Andrew how does God free somebody can I just tell you according to a prophet God frees his church by the word God frees his church by the word look here in the message Junction or just once more he said Satan has no more power only as he can Bluff with it if he can only Bluff you into it then you'll have to have it but legally he has no power at all every Power he had was taken from him at Calvary that's where the price was paid he is nothing but a bluff if you want to listen to his bluff well all right but you don't have to you are free tonight if you want to listen to Satan's Bluff you can if you want to but you don't have to because you are free tonight he has made you free and now if something listen if something in the word can make you realize you are free by his grace or if something realized the word makes you understand or some Act of God that it included you it includes us all then you just accept it on those basis and you're free also you don't have to feel any different you don't have to feel anything at all Jesus never said that you feel it he said did you believe it it's Faith friends and that sharp two-edged sword will cut every Promise free if that arm of faith is able to yield the sword a great strong arm holding this Bible can cut every promise of it free I'm on Church a great strong hand of this Bible can pick up the word and can cut every promise of it free you say then why are you saying that because it's time to be strong in the Lord amen it's time to put on the Power of his mind it's time to quit letting the devil run us around the church they've been like we're a bunch of trespassers in the promises of God it's time to quit letting the devil amen say boo when we get little and he gets bigger I think it's time somebody somewhere sometime amen pick up the sword of the Lord and begin to say boo back at that devil and as you say boo he'll get smaller and you'll get bigger come on church amen you can only get so small and he can only get so big before something's gonna happen and maybe this sermon finds you in the car owner amen but release your faith and pick up the strong hand of God and accept the word if you believe it's not a man it's the ministering Spirit sent from the presence of God or they sent poor amen I love this brother brother Brad they're sent to minister amen forth the word to them who are The Heirs of Salvation remember said what does he do he stays right with the word amen Cuts every devil what does it the word what is it the ministering Spirit sent from the presence of God to anoint the speakers of God the word that stays with the word and he confirms the word with signs amen following which brings Jesus the same yesterday today and forever now you say brother Andrew you mentioned the bride's Jubilee what is the rights you believe well if you study the message you'll find that the bride's Jubilee amen is the interpreted word fulfilled the bride's Jubilee actually happens when the written word becomes manifested word by interpretating the word of God and then it is fulfilled remember said what a word to say this scripture 65 what a word think of it this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears before your eyes who said it God himself who is what The Interpreter of his own word then this day is this scripture fulfilled he said the Messiah himself amen standing in the presence of the congregation and reading a word out of the Bible pertaining to himself and then saying amen today this scripture is fulfilled watch and they still failed to see it now now that would I mean amen y'all got to forgive me cause I'm just a country boy okay but that would be like you go in a room and in the room amen there's a book written and the book says Andrew Glover will walk in at seven o'clock in a great pair of pants a white shirt purple top black coat pick up this word read it close it hand it back and sit down and it'll be fulfilled so Andrew Glover comes in seven o'clock gray pants white shirt purple tie black coat picks up the Bible reads the word goes over sits down and somebody says well I just don't think that's what it is well why don't you think it is well so and so told me that he would have on a black shirt and he would have on gray pants but he would have a different color tie but why don't you think it was so-and-so told me that he wouldn't be six foot three he'd be five foot four amen but if you if you read the description come on church if you read the description when you see the Fulfillment match the description it's a sin to disbelieve it and that's exactly what happened amen Jesus according to Isaiah walked in the temple picked up the Bible found the place that was written read it right out and their eyes saw it their ears heard it they've been their mouths dropped open as he done it but because they were believing man's interpretation amen they missed the Jubilee and they continue to serve under the traditions of the Pharisees and the Sadducees and I'm just going to go and preach since I'm here amen this message amen has not changed since a prophet walked off the scene man has changed it man is trying to interpret but this message Remains the Same amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever this word is not being interpreted by man it's being interpreted by God which is bringing the perfect interpretation of the word in the church which by the perfect interpretation it is literally bringing us back Amen to our original inheritance see our original inheritance is an Incorruptible inheritance she loved that Peter said it like this he said which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope Amen to an inheritance is Incorruptible undefiled and Faith it's not a way and it is reserved in heaven for you now watch this word incorruptable it's something that has no principles of dissolution or decay in it therefore it must be totally different from this Earth this inheritance must be something totally different from this Earth why who now watch the next verse who were kept by the power of God Amen through faith unto salvation and they are ready to be revealed in the last time Peter goes on to say we've been born again amen not of corruptable seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever now if a man is born of a word he will produce the word and the fruit or works of his life will be a product of the kind of seed or life that is in him his Works therefore will be scriptural so if you've got a corruptable seed you'll have corruptable Works amen which will end in destruction of the corruption but if you have an Incorruptible seat that is received an Incorruptible inheritance it will that the inheritance sin will end up in an Incorruptible body then I say this to you with everything within me our inheritance is scriptural don't you ever let anybody tell you that this inheritance is not scriptural this inheritance is scriptural amen and where did it come from it did not come from the hybrid beginning but it comes from the original beginning said it very plain he said we are on our road back to that original beginning of the creation of God then what is the way back amen the way back or the road back is the Holy Ghost then how did the Holy Ghost come to the church amen on the day of Pentecost amen the Holy Ghost was released back into the church which was the abstract which was the token which was the sign which was the mark amen listen friends when something is sent you will either receive it or you will reject it when something from God is sent you will either receive it or you will reject it now brother Brahm said if you receive it he said it will be a golden age he said but if you reject it amen now watch when people rejected amen the place always goes into chaos and just rots in its condition now amen if you want to preach with me we can amen go to go to Life Tabernacle Shreveport amen and look where they're at today amen they meant their Generations removed from when a prophet stood there but you go in there and brother Jason there's no resemblance that a prophet ever stepped foot in that place amen you know why because God sent the word fulfilled amen by the voice of the seventh angel which that word was going to be a jubilee amen not to the denominational people amen but to the gene seed of God Amen to show them you're headed for another true belief amen and what do they do they slam the door in the face and said we don't want that here rather you know it or not when's preached in last part of his ministry 1965 in Shreveport amen he's down there preaching predestination he's preaching invisible Union amen and Jack Moore actually goes to the hotel to tell him you cannot continue the meetings amen you have to take him somewhere else but they kept giving him the wrong room and REM comes to the pulpit and makes a joke about it and says well they never found me guess we'll have to go somewhere else amen now you believe what you want to believe but I believe that was the hand of God Amen because hundreds are not hundreds of feathers amen but years later right here on Beaufort South Carolina on a Saturday night Amen in the back part of God's mind he had a bride who would be sitting here in the age when the message was to be sent and she would not reject it she would not say take it somewhere else but she would say be it unto me Lord according to Thy word amen amen my hands are yours my mouth is yours my heart is yours amen my family my church my Ministry amen I give my life amen to the message of it I say we ought to open up a door and welcome back the authority of what a prophet told in this generation until it frees our kids it frees our marriages come on church I'm I'm just going to preach and then we got situations that counselors can't fix we got problems that psychologists can't get us out of and the only hope for the church is the return of the true holy ghost in the Dynamics of its power I say we welcome the Holy Ghost we welcome him to move come on Church he'll do things that we can't do come on he can do more in five minutes brother Jason then five hour prayer meetings can do amen he can do more in five minutes than 50 years of trying to figure it out can do yeah when he comes in except him come on because he's coming to bring you into your position he's not coming to leave you in the bondage he's coming to bring you into the Liberty now when program says this he opens returning Jubilee amen by showing Israel's portion of inheritance in the land of Palestine and he said see the portion of inheritance could not be fulfilled by anyone else so you're sitting there thinking someday somebody somewhere is going to come along and they're going to do a lot better job than me and God's going to give them my position well I don't know who you're serving amen but that's not how my God works come on Church my God if he gets your position amen he will make sure you fill that position and every devil in hell amen will have to stand back and watch him amen use you in that position come on Amen these are not given take positions amen do you want to be the bride today or you didn't do good today give it back to me well you want to be a son tomorrow here no that's not the way God works amen if you ever was the son of God you always was the son of God if you ever was a part of this bride you always was because the predestination position of God is Not Upon A give and take basis it's Upon Us thus saith the Lord in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation I tell you what I feel like preaching here for a second I think we ought to take a few moments and let that devil know after everything he done to destroy us and try to take us out and try to bury us and try to make us just another church on the side of the road we're still here and we're still believing and we're still preaching and we're still worshiping oh some is coming some is when amen but we're still here amen we're still in the fight amen because we didn't put ourselves in amen but God from before the foundation of the world persistently placed this church in its position and there ain't enough devils in hell right enough devils in time right enough devils in this Dimension Amen to pull this bride out of her god-given position by the lamb well we're still here I said we're still here I said we're still here we're still preaching this message we're still believing in the Holy Ghost we're still singing until the Angels break out in this Dimension we're still believing for our kids we're still believing for our healing that will throw all you on at us we'll be here tomorrow and if you don't like that we'll be back Wednesday and if you don't like that we'll be here 10 years until this bride leaves the Earth this bride will be in her position and she will not be swayed by the situations of her life she will not be moved by the conditions of laodicea we're still here he said we're still here the devil knocked us down but we got back up come on the devil said well they're finished God said you ain't seen nothing yet y'all know I'm telling you the truth it's time to get up I know you've had a little misunderstandings a little well this amen but get back up and get back in the fight you still got a sword you still got a church you still got a word it's still got an anointing you still got a position hormones Church your thoughts can't take you out your failures can't take you out amen cause false didn't put you in and failures didn't put you in but Jesus Christ the son of God Amen sealed you in by his own blood I'm still here devil I'm still here look here I'm still here you said I wouldn't make it and I made it you said I wasn't overcome and I overcome you said I was finished and God said how can he be finished when I'm fishing to breathe amen the message of life into him and then bones are going to live again and they're going to declare I know what I'm talking about amen I know a devil when I recognize one and there's a devil suicide and it's roaming through this generation and you know what it's doing is talking people into living Lifestyles that's ungodly and unclean amen and then tell them they ought to go kill themselves because they got called up in that lifestyle I remember that is nothing but a line devil from the pits of hell and I got a sword in my hand and I've heard the testimony of William Branham and to cap it off I heard Eddie biscal and he said soldier boy you will not die amen but you will live and go home and be a real man and be a real father come on Church our God is a god of restoration our God is a god of redemption our God is a God it'll break the chains of perversion he'll break the chains of homosexuality he'll break the chains of transgenders he'll break the chains of pornography because he's God and His word is true that's power is real hey I'm not a crazy man it's a jubilee time it's a jubilee season it's an anointing to release the prisoner from the prison Hallelujah it's the hour of Jubilee hell I know what I'm talking about it's a devil I said it's a devil it's a devil to rob a man from being in his position it's a devil to rob a lady from being in her position I got a sword so I might as well cut and I got a strong arm to pick it up [Music] it's a devil but you don't have to live compressed by it oh church program said that man come in he said what is this soldier boy he said I love him I love him not in the middle of singing about loving him he says what is this Soldier Boy he said you're not going to commit suicide the devil's aligned to you resist that devil you're going to go home you're going to be a real man you're going to preserve your heritage come on Brothers you're going to be a real man you're going to you're going to be a real head remember him said that that night he went free now brother said her brother biscal said like this he said we was on our way back to the camp he said stop by restaurant so we walked in there said all of a sudden this man walked in with the soldier boy brother grandma called out he said brother brother Branham looked at him said God bless you he said God bless you he said brother I'm gonna have a word with you brother best school said they stepped out of the out of the restaurant he said I stood there brother Jason and I watched him walk down the road down the sidewalk amen they walked down the sidewalk he said and I saw him conversing he said then all of a sudden he raised his hands and he began to shout I'm free he began to pump his fist I'm free he said I'm free brother bisco said they turn around and come walking back up and the whole time he's saying I'm free I'm free I'm free I'm free listen I ain't preached this in a long time but I preached the message on the while back amen he began to say I'm free I'm free he said when I got back up there they got in the car but they had said brother Bradham he said you mind me asking what that was he said brother Eddie he said that man's in the military he said he's been in a psych ward he said and they've been saying he's going to commit suicide he said but we were walking down there and he said the angels of the Lord discerned what it was he said he's a married man got a wife and kids but said he got involved in a homosexual lifestyle and said he's been living with a man and said the devil's been telling him he's going to commit suicide he said but the minute that thing was exposed he said that devil turned his hands off of that man he said brother Eddie he's not going back the way he came [Applause] it's more than a taste it's a jubilee come on you can slow down the change you can throw down the banners you can throw down the old lifestyle you can throw down the depression you can pull down the anxiety you can throw down the devil you have been released by the word of true belief come on church amen I can't stop there I gotta finish the testimony but Brisco said like this he said and brother random had me take a picture of him he said he had to take a picture and he said I looked at that picture and thought I'll never see him again years later Marilyn brother bisco's daughter is in Florida her and her husband and I believe it was at uh I think it was brother Brown's he hands him a picture of this man and the soldier boy he takes it back she takes it back home social to her dad rubisco stands there and all and says oh that's him that's the soldier boy and in that picture they were not having a funeral he was standing there with a prophet of God and it was the dawning of a new day brother Jason I got to thinking about that and I'm way off my notes I got to thinking about that and I heard a prophet say this he said the devil's trying to send you to a premature grave I got to thinking what was that there was suicide trying to do to that young man sent him to a premature grave amen but David said amen shall not die amen but she shall live and the reason you're going to live is you're going to declare the wonderful acts of god of what he's done for you listen friends that Devil's tried to kill you he's trying to kill me he's trying to kill this church he's trying to kill your faith amen but I think tonight's a good night Amen to stand up in that Devil's place and say I will not die I will not be buried I will not be finished I will not bow my knee to the demon of suicide but I will live and I will declare that he's the same yesterday today and forever I will declare he's a God that heals I will declare he's a God that feels I will declare he's a God that walks on water I will declare he's a God it'll break through the midnight season and it'll change the situation I will declare he's a chain breaker way making Miracle working Soul Saving body healing Jesus and he's right here he's right here in this building tonight in divine presence [Applause] you're not condemned you're redeemed [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it's a devil but resist that devil come on Church you know I'm telling you the truth it's a devil it's a devil resisting he don't have a choice well I don't want to leave you ain't got a choice you got to go now well devil you might as well get out of here Church the devil is a liar so why not tell him why not tell him he's a liar why not just use your voice to say what the word says and tell that Devil he's a liar Andrew you don't know how long I've been in this I didn't ask how long you've been in it I come to tell you the word of Jubilee gives you a new identity the word of Jubilee changes your identity come on church he came a homosexual he left a husband he left the father come on some of y'all come to church you come depressed but you don't stay that way you leave with joy come on you come to church with guilt and condemnation but you don't stay that way you leave different you know why because it's a trumpet it's a jubilee trumpet sounding now my Bible says it very plain I pray I'm not going over time but the Bible said therefore Brethren ye have been called unto Liberty somebody say why are you enjoying Liberty because I was called unto it only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another look at this word called it means to utter in a loud voice said when those Patriarchs mothers Hebrew mothers give birth to their sons he said they cried out their names and their position Amen in The Inheritance in the land but they didn't feel it till a hundred years later so when she called their name she was positionally placing them in Palestine and they're still babies coming out of her womb but they've already got their position and years goes by but brother Josh nothing changes what she screamed out in her labor pains nothing they went through could change their position they was ordained to it they was born to fill that position listen and you say well well what's this so important about that called because called means to call it means to name so when something calls you it names you it means to call by name it means to give a name to it means to receive the name of receive as a name to give some name to one it means to call his name then our old name listen amen I'm just going to preach here because there's nobody in here got a right to hold up a Halo and say well I'm better than so-and-so and I've been here this long and I know every one of us was born in sin shaping in iniquity and brother John the only thing we had going for us was a prophet said that when God created the foundation of the world he said God in his labor pains was bringing forth you knowing what you would do the same level cause the same Pains of those Hebrew mothers amen called their names and their tribes and positionally placed them amen years before they got in their position amen and the prophet of God said God called your name when he was bringing forth the Earth he positionally placed you into his own body to be a housewife to be a farmer to be a preacher a prophet to be this or that he placed you positionally then what happened God in his Masterworks knew he would not be defeated and so he promised there would be a church in the end time that would be positionally placed in the position he saw her all the way from when he was creating the Book of Genesis listen friends Jesus did the works of the father why because the father was in him then the god which is the word which was invisible was invisible until it was made visible and then the word became visible listen friends in God's labor pains when he was bringing forth he called you unto Liberty he called you into this Liberty amen but it was an invisible calling until the word become flesh in your flesh and when the word become flesh in your flesh it called you into your position listen that's why when you're sitting in church and you hear the word and some literally pulls you up out of your seat brother Jason and you say Amen you're not doing that because the preachers begging you you're not doing well well some do but I don't amen you're not doing that amen because somebody's working you up you're doing that because the word that's being preached is calling you into your position and it's not a word of defeat it's not a word of bondage it is a word of Liberty and as you hear the word you receive the word and as you receive the word you become the word and you're being positionally placed not as a defeated housewife but as a liberated housewife amen not as a defeated farmer but a liberate is harmor not as a defeated Pastor brother Jason but a liberated Pastor listen I say we ought to declare war on every devil in hell it's time to take our Liberty amen we've been called unto Liberty my name is not depression my name is not suicide my name is not defeat and failure but my name is Miss Jesus Christ and I have been called by the word of my age you say preacher why are you free cause I can't help but be free I got y'all forgive me I got to dance the other day when I was preaching somebody's sitting there staring at me big old bug eyed I turned around just caught me wrong you know I tried he's just kind of sitting around at me I said don't be jealous I'm free I'm about her and you can be free to listen amen thank God for this message it broke the Pentecostal taskmasters off of Our Lives now come on church can I preach to you this message is the only place you can be what you are without fear favor or anything [Music] oh brother okay well try me would you go to a Pentecostal church and just sit there and raise your hand and not and you know what before long they're going to change their sermon and tell you praise God hallelujah you need to get up and you need to walk you need to shout you need to speak in tongues come on church because they're trying to force you to be something that you're not listen I'm a firm believer there'll be people walk the streets of gold that never dance the aisle but there'll be people that did there'll be people that'll sit at the marriage supper of the lamb and they never one time spoke in tongues but there'll be people sent there that did they'll be people that'll fellowship with Paul around the tree of life and they'll drink water from the River of Life and they never one time stood up and shouted amen but the word moved him in the way that God anointed them to be moved come on friends this message has give you amen a liberty to be what God called you if you feel like shouting this message give you Liberty to shout if you feel like running he'd give you Liberty to run if you just feel like sitting there raving your hands and just crying out to God it'd give you Liberty to do that because a man didn't give us your position but Church didn't give you this position but you were called by the liberty of the anointed word in this age under your position I say our eyes and shine and fulfill your position be the best day manner if you're a sinner be the best sinner if you're a shout or be the best shouter but whatever position God has called you to [Applause] to the best of your ability you've been called to it I feel like shout hallelujah you've been called to it I've been called this position you've been given the name Liberty [Applause] Oh Glory to God you've been given the name Liberty I don't have time to preach it to you but it's a beautiful story Israel goes in the mud pits of Egypt right 400 years Abraham receives a vision after 400 years sister you're gonna walk out defeated with no joy barely holding on barely believing it's not what the vision said the vision said after 400 years you'll come out with great substance 400 years passed and all they had was the vision that God gave Father Abraham but they knew in 400 years we're leaving here do you know what I got to study one day and I got to thinking about something realization how many times did those Israelite fathers come home get in the tent have enough time just to get La get Salve put in their in their straps in their stripes from the day before and barely get the skin the touch and then the next morning wake up and go back in those mud pits how did they do that for 400 years they didn't have three services a week they didn't have 50 youth camps a year they didn't have 20 special meetings and 10 conventions come on Church they didn't have men's prayer breakfast every two weeks they didn't have come on they didn't they didn't have Friday night Youth Services over at the as they didn't have those all they had was a vision God gave Abraham that your seed will sojourn in a Strange Land but after 400 years I'll bring a jubilee upon this seed and when the Jubilee comes upon it I'll bring you out with great substance but you know what I found I found out in the Bible there's a principle you know what I call it I call it David's principle say with me David's principal you know what it is it's when they spoke of stone and David the Bible says that David encouraged himself David encouraged himself in the Lord he didn't have nobody to pray for with him he didn't have nobody to sing with him but brother Samuel he reached over and got a hold of David's principle and said I will encourage myself in the Lord and I can see those Israelites walking for the chase in those mud pits every day saying be of good cheer be of good courage hold on Church we're leaving here one of these days just a few more whips and we're out of here just a few more days of pain and Agony and we're out of here because the seed is under the promise of Jubilee what are you saying preacher I'm saying that this is the ear of Jubilee it's the season of Jubilee by the vision of the word remember said look if they was in a walled City or Within Walls he said those walls paraphrase him will never stop the Jubilee I'm coming into my message right now from my heart okay amen I'm not y'all forgive me I'm not prone to Fanatics hey man but I had a whole service whole whole other direction laid out but wrestling in my mind and praying at 1 42 a.m Friday morning I don't know what it was but it was a voice spoke to my heart and said preach the Jubilee so that's all I'm going to do here tonight is preach what God spoke to my heart preach the Jubilee preach the people that you believe you say preacher what are you getting at I'm saying that your walls will never stop this Jubilee I'm saying this situations that look impossible will never stop this true belief we have received the leadership of the Holy Ghost we have not rejected it we have a sure confidence in the leadership of the Holy Ghost and we're not bowing down but we're in the end of the season and Reverend said at the end of the season he said those drift fences was taken down and all the cattle got together and they celebrated a great big Jubilee He said and I pray God in the coming week we'll take all the dress finches a denomination will be torn down and all born again children of God will be brought together in one great big Holy Ghost rally of Jubilee where they all get together you say now preacher I've heard you believe tonight I've heard the word but I'm sitting here I've heard about a position I've heard about these things but brother Andrew you don't realize I don't have an inheritance okay well let me ask you this how many children of God do we have here you testify you're a child of God then will you receive the words of a Vindicated prophet every child of God has an inheritance every child of God has an inheritance and if that inheritance is lost then you have a god-given right to go back and take the inheritance back you say preacher how in the world am I going to do this because Grace made a way for the Lost inheritance to be returned Grace made a way for the Lost inheritance to be returned you say what is it preacher it's nothing but the pardoning grace of God remember I'm sitting in that Jubilee year every man lost his Heritage by some means if he was a Freeborn True Blood is right no matter who held the possession it had to go back to him free he didn't have to pay a thing he didn't have to do a thing what did he have to do he just stopped what he was doing and go back to his inheritance what a picture it gives to church in the last days you see what man can do and what God does but the Jubilee was God's manner of expressing Grace to his people or bringing them back to their right for possession what are you saying I'm saying the hour of Jubilee there was the sounding of the Jubilee trumpet Leviticus 25 9 the trumpet sound throughout all your land first Thessalonians 4 16 the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with what a shout with a voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God first Corinthians 14 8 if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound then who shall prepare himself for the battle listen now a man in his family could hear the Jubilee trumpet which is the gospel and right then they could go back to their original Heritage if they could hear the Jubilee a trumpet sound and know what it meant listen are you ready for this the whole family could come and receive their inheritance the whole family could come and receive their inheritance he said what is that inheritance the Pentecostal experience which is your possession now I don't find this strange brother Matt that in Leviticus 25 it says on the 10th day of the seventh month amen so you hear but day of atonement and shall the sound of the trumpet be that's not strange to me because I read brother Kent in Revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the same words used in Leviticus 25 have now oh God have now come over in Revelation 10 and he says the mystery of God will be finished as it declared to his servants of prophets remember he said what is it both of them working for the same Master amen slave amen just a slave and then a son they're both working for the same master so the slave don't have one master and the son that's a slave have another they've got this same Master he said now watch amen their soul under sin he said many a time he said they stay that way but now watch he said they take dogma's rituals Creeds in the church instead of taking the real word but when the real word sounds itself out they don't know what you're talking about they call you a Holy Roller see why amen because the real word is the Holy Ghost itself amen sounding through human flesh come on church when when the priest picked up the trumpet am I going too long when the priest picked up the trumpet in Leviticus 25 amen and sounded amen the breath he was blowing was coming out of his mouth into the trumpet and it was connected with the trumpet and it was putting out a sound and that sound amen was the sound of Jubilee without the trumpet sound it was just a breath without the breath connecting with something it was just a breath but when the breath of the priest connected with the instrument of the trumpet and began to sound it changed it from just a voice into a supernatural sound amen and when they heard that sound when they heard the trumpet they could throw down the hole let me tell you young people let me tell you church this Holy Ghost message is not the sound of a bunch of preachers it's not the sound of a box of personalities this message is the holy ghost that has been bound by denominational Rivers for 2 000 years being released in the evening time come on Church the mess message is not just in books the messages and flesh come on I don't have a shofar tonight Brad I don't have a trumpet tonight but I'm sounding the Jubilee oh I've sounded just like pressure how you sounding amen because when you hear it you can go free somebody say free you can go free you can't go free it feels good to say it you can go free you say preacher what are you getting at only the son that had lost his inheritance was able to go free and as many as received him to them gave you power to become the sons look at this word power it's the liberty of doing as one pleases foreign are you ready for this it means to leave so when you heard the Jubilee trumpet sound you didn't have to ask for permission to leave testing one two it's still working when you heard the Jubilee trumpet you didn't have to go to the Taskmaster and say Sir I've got a wife at home I've got babies and starving I've got a home falling apart would you mind if I go back to my family when you heard that trumpet program said like this he said you could throw down the hole and you could go and walk off and say don't you ever hit me again don't you ever touch me again he said why because you was being loosed from the slave bill of sin you was being loosed from the slave out of the Taskmaster now you all know according to Revelation 1 5 how we are loose we are loose by the blood right the perfect blood of God looses us entirely no longer to serve the Taskmaster but to walk in the liberty and go back to our original Heritage then turns you and says it like this he says the man in the museum the other day crying his eyes out an old black fella he said I walked over and put my arm around him I said sir what's wrong he said do you see that dress he said I do and Michael he said that dress is the dress of the wife of Abraham Lincoln he said the blood on that dress is Abraham Lincoln's blood he said sir then why are you crying he said he turned around and lifted up his shirt he said do you see these scars on my back he's said that blood on that dress sister Debbie that blood on that dress stopped the scars on that man's back brother said I'll look put my arm around him and I said the blood of a sinful man named Abraham Lincoln meant so much to a man that he could move him into worship he said but then I got to thinking about some more scars he said I got to thinking about some more scars he said I got to thinking amen about the sleigh bell to sin he said then I begin to think about how it control me he said but then all of a sudden he said one day I recognize that the blood of Jesus Christ had been said and I no longer had to serve under sin I was freed by the blood I was free somebody say freed by the blood oh I was freed by the blood the devil don't want to hear that but I'm going to say it to him again you were freed by the blood you were born in sin but you were subject to bondage by the fall but God through his grace declared a Year of Jubilee and I said now watch we were under a load can I can I read this to you our parents sold us out to sin the Garden of Eden we were laid under the bonds of sin we were a slave to the devil we were born in sin safe and equally now listen there was nothing we could do to help us brother Aaron there was nothing we could do to help us cause our whole makeup our whole nature everything we are a Sin brother Andrew I'm trying to help myself get out of this condition can I give you a jubilee tonight you can't help yourself [Applause] you can't help yourself message Jubilee here remember him said I met a young lady not long ago she said brother ma'am I'd give anything if I could only break this band of whiskey she said I started when I was little girl with a boy that drank we started mixing drinks now watch her words and I become a perfect slave to it foreign I become a perfect slave to it and if I don't have it she says I just go wild if I can only get rid of this he said I looked at her and said you can't do it yourself but I know someone brother Luther I know someone who can break it for you the Lord Jesus Christ has come to make you free I'm just going to preach to you right now because some of y'all has become perfect slaves you become perfect slaves to situation amen come on don't get tired on me you know it's the truth you become a perfect slave to the way people think about you you become a perfect slave to the way people view your church well glory to God listen you become a perfect slave well brother Andrew I'm not a perfect slave but no bad the church likes me well congratulations you're a perfect slave in your mind you're a slave well so and so looked at me I tell you brother Jason was preaching he looked right at me when he said that who else is he supposed to look at the walls come on and some people have been brought out of situations but they're still wearing the band to those situations so they never give nobody a chance they never give their new church a chance but come on you know I'm telling you the truth but it's the hour of Jubilee I remember I heard Paul the fun thing say one time he said people leave another church scarred by a minister come to my church he said and sit there for years judging me based on how the former Minister scarred them and never give me a chance to help them and you know what that is amen that's a perfect slave to scars but as I'm close tonight amen the word of God is in my voice it's in my lungs it's come out of my breath and I'm sounding to you tonight the Jubilee trumpet perfect slaves you can go free you don't have to live under the bands of what somebody said of what somebody done or the way somebody's thoughts or the way somebody come on Church the minute you hear the Jubilee trumpet you can throw down the hole you can square your shoulders back and say devil don't you ever touch me again I think it's time some fathers right here tonight swear their shoulders back and say Satan take your hands off my family take your hands off my home take your hands or come on church it's the hour of Jubilee oh I feel that devil pushing back at me but I'm gonna push back it's Jubilee you say preacher devil yes spiritual warfare there's Devils right now in another dimension intimidate me amen not to say it but just to show them they don't control me I'm gonna say it anyhow who the son has set free is free indeed and my Bible says I have an inheritance my Bible says I've got a right Amen to put my foot on every Instagram that God's given me that if I've got a right I'm going to put my foot on Joy I'm gonna put my foot on peace I'm gonna quit my foot on forgiveness I'm gonna put my foot on no condemnation come on Church you're never going to stand on the Promises as long as you're sitting on the premises it's time to stand up and put your foot on the head of that devil and say this is my church this is my Jubilee this is my family this is my hour This Is My Season Satan I've served you long enough but today it's over in the name of Jesus Christ I charge every devil take your hands off of God's Property I loose them by the sound of the Jubilee trumpet the Sun is up the Sun is up giddy and the Sun is up and if the Sun is up then so are we if the Sun is hot then so are we you've been looking at Jubilee you've been hearing about Jubilee but now is the hour come on church now is the time now is the season brother Samuel now is the anointing has come to put your foot [Music] it's on me can I preach it to you it's getting late brother Jason can I have a few more minutes it's time to put your foot on it that devil that's walked on you is how you put your foot on him is it still working Brad that devil that's walked on you this Jubilee trumpet is releasing you to put your foot on him now you'll make primitive from the Bible I can in Genesis the third chapter the Bible says that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent but the serpent brother Joe said the serpent would bruise her heel the serpent would only bruise his heel in other words you got a position but so does the devil I said you got a possession Brother JD but so does the devil you say the devil yeah the devil has a position it's under your foot [Applause] the devil has a position but it's under your foot God give the devil a position but it's under your foot you say well preacher the devil's Afflicted me he had a right to according to Genesis 3 God gave him a right to afflict you but you know where brother Steve the only place he has a right to afflict you is your heel if he afflicts you anywhere else he's out of his position brother Chris if he afflicts your mind he's out of his position if he afflicts your knee he's out of his position if he afflicts your emotions he's out of his position the Bible said put your foot on that devil then you know what I say in closing brother I say it's time for the bride to bring back some old-fashioned Holy Ghost Field foot stomping religion amen back in the house of God [Applause] it's time to put your foot on that devil some of y'all think I'm crazy join me I'm free it's time to put your foot on that devil it's a preacher you better be careful now if you got scripture I do Luke the 10th chapter Jesus said I beheld Satan amen fall from Heaven as lightning look at the definition of the word fall the word fall means come to its end right after Luke 10 the very next verse Jesus says I sing Satan come to his end very next verse brother Tony behold I give you power to put your foot to tread upon serpents and score in other words there was a connection between the devil's end and your foot [Applause] there was a connection between the devil's hand and your foot the very minute the devil come to his hand was the very minute God released the power in the church to put their foot on that devil can I go a little bit further with it you know what brother Ben said he said now we don't stomp a devil out you agree with me we don't stop it so I got to study I thought man why is there so much in the Bible about stomping the devil and then remember so we don't stop it able to make him go out he said now but listen when the devil is Defeated You've Got a right to stomp on him I said oh okay we don't stop to defeat a devil but we stomp on the defeated devil foreign you know me and I got thinking I got to thinking you get your straight animal around your property amen and that thing stands here and you throw something at you put a little bit of lead in it y'all forgive me just no comfortable okay you put a little lead in that boy amen that thing's gonna stand there and he's going to torment you but you know what he's defeated while he's doing it so I got to thinking amen if we got a ride to stomp amen then we can Stomp and get that defeated devil out here a lot quicker cause you know what you say you say get out of here go on get out of here y'all know I'm telling you the truth and some of y'all sitting there right now letting an old defeated devil has followed you since you as a child amen panelize you and torment you but the word of Jubilee has put a strength in your foot you've got to write by the word to put your foot on that devil now well I gotta close here I'm gonna preach all night but I gotta quit right here but then I got to study it you know what else program said he said Jesus Christ the son of God heals you of arthritis over 31 times he says that brother Steve he says the Lord Jesus heals you of our spirit anybody here ever been healed of it you've been healed of arthritis God heals arthritis don't he so I'm thanking brother Aaron we don't stomp on the devil but temperament says this he says now go out of this field and and stomp on that devil he heals you of arthritis I said oh there it is when the devil is Defeated You've Got a right to stomp on him as a sign he's back in his position can I go a little bit further you know what I found out I found out arthritis is the stiffness of joints and you know what happens the older you get the more age accumulates the stiffer you get I got to think of man praise God the Lord heals natural arthritis but then you know what brother Chris I found out there's another kind of arthritis it's called spiritual arthritis and we got a lot of cases around the church y'all know I'm telling the truth amen not gonna just tell you where it's at amen some people brother Jason they got spiritual arthritis in their hands you say how do you know that they can't shake hands with certain people their hands too stiff they can't shake somebody's hand you know why because 20 years ago somebody done somebody wrong and they've held that little something in their heart and for 20 years they let spiritual arthritis amen Harden their hand and they see the brothers see the sister can't shake their hands oh you know I'm telling you the truth amen I found out people got spiritual arthritis in their elbow Brothers used to be able to hug their brothers necks amen but now they avoid them sisters used to be a brother Luther it might just be me and you time I get done they used to be able to hug their sisters but now they got spirituals right what can I go on I found out brother Joe some people got in their shoulder man when they first got saved brother Jason every sermon he preached was the most powerful sermon they raised their hand I mean they they were waving their hand they were praising God they were pumping fists preaching brother but give them a little time they memorized some quotes they went through a few things they didn't like about brother Jason and now that spiritual arthritis has gotten their shoulder but occasionally they get temporary healings when a Vista comes through and then they can raise it up but come Wednesday night it'll show back up and they won't be able to race amen but then I found out there's another place it is it gotten their knees they used to be able to stand up when the preacher preached amen but now they complain because other people stand up it's because she got spiritual arthritis well I might as well keep on going I found out they got it in their ankles they used to shout and dance and enjoy the blessings of God Amen but it's been 50 years since they stood up it's been 50 years since they danced it's been 20 years since they shouted amen but if Jesus Christ the son of God can go into a meeting and heal somebody of natural arthritis then I propose to you vessel Tabernacle that that same Lord Jesus has come in this church tonight and he is here to heal spiritual arthritis I say it ought to leave our hands in order to leave our Harms in ought to leave our feet I say bring back celebrity I say bling back to Joy bring back the unity bring back the fellowship but your mouse must stand up and put your foot on that devil said put your foot on that devil but then I can't but sometimes you just gotta stand up and put your foot on that brother Aaron how do you do it you just kind of stand up and put your foot on Brad how do you do it you just kind of stand up brother Jason how do you do it you just kind of put your foot up come on church that Devil's walk all over some of you all and I'm giving you an opportunity right now by the word to stand up on your feet and put that devil under his [Applause] put him in his position put that table under your feet come on musicians I'm done push that devil back in this place it's the hour of Jubilee y'all know I'm telling you the truth you serve that never long enough it's time to put him back in his place put your foot on that devil that was nervous but just kind of put your foot on him he's defeated if you want the quotes I'll send them to you but I'm giving you prophetic instructions he said stomp on that devil you know what he called it he called it imaginary things he said stomp on him look it up another I found brother Jason he said it's unreasonable fault stomp on them now listen I know this is simple but it's coming from a heart it's the hour of Jubilee you've been a perfect slave to those unreasonable thoughts long enough now listen I know what I'm talking about unreasonable thought s that say I'll never be good enough thoughts that say you know brother Jason I have no inheritance I guess this is the future of my family and this is the future of my life but I propose to you tonight Church that's an unreasonable thought and you've got a right to put your foot on it you've been anointed by the word of Jubilee put your foot on it anybody won't see that devil get back in this position you remember what it was like you remember what it was like before you had spiritual arthritis couldn't nobody sing a bad song ever Sherman was the best ever meat was the best then you got a little something and listen I know what I'm talking about because we go through things and if we don't deal with them we accumulate them and then 20 years down the road we're still serving them thinking we're free but you know what happens there Comes A Time you gotta buried Comes A Time you gotta let it go sh I said to you like this who the sun is set free who the word has set free is free indeed I know right now you may say brother I don't feel like I'm free I don't care if you feel like you are or not the word is greater than my feelings the word is greater than the way I sense things are going the word declares you're free [Music] I was in a meeting something like this a few years ago I was in church and there was a there was a sister come up for prayer she was an elderly sister and she come up and she said with Andrew she said a couple years ago I lost my husband she said when I did she said me and my daughter we had crosswords and she said she's the only daughter of God only child I've got left she said and ever since then she said we've not spoken we've not shaken hands or nothing for two years he said she said we just been distant I said really she said she said and something happened in my life 50 years ago she said that still torments me to this day she said and so adding that on top of this is this okay she said add that on top of this she said it's come to a spot she said where I can't even enjoy my salvation anymore she said I need help and brother Brad I have no power of my own [Music] but I took these hands and just laid them over on her head and I began to speak the word over her life begin to say since the word says who the sun is set free it's free I said is it on the bus you said brother and send the blood I said that I believe right now the Lord can take that thing that you've been serving for 50 years totally dismiss it put you in a position you can heal this situation with your daughter and you can move forward I got done praying the spirit Lord dropped on the lady the pastor is down there with us she was speaking in tongues rejoicing I'm free I'm free and about that time another lady walks up his brother Andrew she said two years ago she said my mom and I had a fallen out she said we ain't talked in two years I said really she said yeah she said dad died something happened she said we ain't talked in two years I said well do you believe the Lord can heal that right now and you'll go make it right she said I will as soon as I can I said now when you get out of church I said God it never dawned on me brother Brad I said when you get out of church just go call her up make it right so I started praying for her Lord hit her brother Jason I walked back up on the platform and I turned around I looked over and the woman was hugging the young lady and she was hugging and the pastor come by and said that's mother and daughter they've been at odds for two years but in a presence of the word the word just dropped in the room and released her listen friends you're not slaves to things in your past you got an inheritance you got a future just let it go won't you drop that hoe tonight go when you get time sometime go study the way brother bam says it over and over I love the way he rehearses it he says when the slave dropped the hoe he said he turned around and looked him in the face and said don't you ever touch me again he said I'm going home I believe there's some people right now that I'll turn around look at that Taskmaster and say don't you ever touch me again [Music] it's under the blood depression don't you ever touch me again suicidal Spirits don't you ever touch me again listen I believe there are some young men out here turn around and look at pornography say don't you ever touch me again [Music] I know we labored on it with the boys but I think we missed the girls some of them isn't as bad as the boys I think some young ladies can say that perverted lifestyle will never touch me again Chevrolet I don't feel like it it don't matter if you feel like it the word says you don't have to serve it and the man that you accept what the word says about your life is the minute that devil loses its hold over you won't you bow your hearts with us tonight I believe that I believe it's the hour of Jubilee [Music] now listen friends I I know it's gotten late but I believe he's in the building tonight and I believe you got a right tonight by the word to drop that program if you're if you're holding potatoes he said whatever instrument is in your hands he said you got a right to drop it and go home what about it tonight friends with everyone closed will there be one here tonight I could say I've served this long enough I've been a perfect slave to this long enough [Music] God bless you God bless you hold my hands up all over the building I've been a slave to this long enough who the son is set free is free indeed heard brother remember save the day he said that old Devil's a squatter and he said that devil don't have no rights on your property he said he's coming for son's name son of man Son of God Son of David Son of Abraham son of David Heirs of the son of man and he said Son of Abraham heir of the royal Grant he said but as a legal owner tonight he said the 50th year Jubilee he said 49 he said 40 days there was a dispute he said but then the 50th they rolled around and he said for 40 days he had been disputing that Jesus Christ people disciples stole his body he's sipping on that 50th day the Jubilee Day the Holy Ghost illegal owner descended into the body and said the legal owner went back to his original property friends I believe the Holy Ghost is coming into your life right here tonight he's the legal owner of your life he's the legal owner of your inheritance

gone forth tonight there's a liberty father there's an anointing in this word of Jubilee Lord I don't believe I'm speaking to slaves and Servants of sin I don't believe I'm speaking to slaves and
