TRANSCRIPT
========================================
in the coming weeks I'll be going to Tanzania and in the morning when you meet somebody in Tanzania uh in swah uh they don't say good morning they say and that means how are you like I mean not just hey but how are you doing how are you feeling how are you so let's try it this morning okay habari let's do itari habari that's not very good let's do it againi I'm doing great thank you so good morning morning morning let's pray father we thank you for your goodness we thank you for a beautiful new day we depend upon your mercies which also are new every day bless this Gathering we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen now it's for healing also they say uh at the end of a prayer they say Amen so let's say Amen good all right God bless you may be seated let's go with number one all right so again we have a limited amount of time and I have my clicker here there we go so uh we're going to uh go pretty rapidly through this uh I've appreciated all the meetings appreciate the hospitality and the invitation to be here I appreciate getting to connect with a lot of you that uh haven't seen some I haven't seen for a while and like I said for most of you I know your parents better than you and uh it's just really nice to be here and uh be able to share in the experience here uh being lost in the mountains and uh so I wanted to talk this morning about a subject that is very practical and something that is um that is uh good for us to know and we want to talk a little bit about this subject of uh how they the disciples came and asked Jesus uh to teach us to pray so let's just jump right in is that all right take your Bible if you don't mind cuz we're going to look in the Book of Luke in the moment if you don't have your Bible uh this is where you're welcome to use your phone if you have a uh an app on your phone you the one time you'll have permission to use your phone in church as long as you don't uh you don't go like this you know and use your phone for something else okay and uh don't don't text your friend so in Luke chapter 8 is where we're going to start this morning now brother brandham said he said one of the greatest there you go one of the greatest things he said that I've found in the Christian life so forgive me I have to look this way and this way at the same time all right so that's what I'm doing the greatest thing I found he said in the Christian Life is letting the Holy Spirit lead you and guide you and his work is marvelous how many of you agree there's no one would lead you to the altar but the spirit of God there's no one would bring you here tonight unless it was the spirit of God and he moves in mysterious ways his wonders to perform so God doesn't always move on the basis of logic he doesn't always move according to our time uh our time frame or our time schedule uh sometimes it's not always logical what God does and the things that he asks you to do like hey if you're going to take down a big city like Jericho walking around it with a trumpet in your hand is probably not the most practical thing to do right but God asks us to do things that are not always logical and always sensible and so when it comes to prayer we have to always remember that uh my ways are not his ways his ways are higher than my ways isn't that right his ways are higher than mine they're better than my ways and so therefore when we come to pray and we come to seek God about something we want to know number one we want to pray for things to happen there are things in your life that you want to change like maybe you need healing or deliverance from something or maybe you want to overcome a problem or a habit or a complex in your life you may want to have joy and don't underestimate Joy because the joy of the Lord is your strength isn't it and and we we sometimes need to pray for wisdom and we need to pray for peace I've never seen a time in my life where more young people are affected by the problem of anxiety and there's a lot of people that are that are struggling with that in one way or another and and I will tell you this that that I believe that healing for any problem you have I believe that God has the answers to every situation we face I believe that God has the answers to every situation that we could face yes he's an all powerful God do you believe that yes and so there are times when we need to pray for things to happen now there are also things that we need to pray for more that should happen so we want to have his leadership and we want to have uh you know answers to questions that we uh that we have about what happens next in our life and if I did a survey here this morning and I've done this in many places in the world if I did a survey and uh said give me your questions I could probably categorize those questions into two uh two categories or I could summarize those questions into two categories and one is about the will of God and what I should be doing now and what how do I know when I'm in the will of God how do I find the will of God and that would be the first category and the second category would be uh how do I know when I found the right one to marry and and most often with young people and you find this all over the world uh there is uh there is a you know uh obviously a need to have an answer to both of those things because you got a lot of life that's laid out ahead of you and so Paul tells us in Romans 12 we should rejoice in Hope and be patient in Tribulation and continue constantly in prayer continuing instant in prayer and that means to persevere not to faint but to be in constant Readiness uh to pray in order to to seek God and to seek his will all right is that all right yeah now um there's two things that uh that were asked for in the scripture uh in relation to this and the first thing that uh David asked in the Old Testament was he said uh Lord teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts on the wisdom in other words Lord help me to be in the right place at the right time doing the right thing that's what it means when he says number our days I want to be found in the right place the right time doing the right thing and and David said I need you to teach me how to do that and you need to be uh sensitive to that in your life you need to develop a sensitivity to that in your life it's really a good uh good practice and the second thing is found in Luke 11 which we want to focus on this morning and that is when the disciples are looking at Jesus they're looking at the kind of ministry he has and the kind of uh results of that Ministry and the work that he's doing and the supernatural that accompanies him all the time it seems like there's uh nothing there's nothing uh that stops Jesus in their view there's nothing that holds him back he's not intimidated by anything or anybody and and they're looking at him and they say teach us to pray we see you going off in the mountain and praying we hear about how you how you commune with your heavenly father father and you know just in in the teachings and they said teach us to do that teach us to pray and I think it's really great because he gives us the words to say and I love it when Jesus gives us the words to say and I love it when brother random gives us the words to say yeah and and so this is very simple he says and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased when he ceased his disciples came to him and one of his disciples and said Lord teach us to pray as John also taught his disciple so this is not an unusual thing this was something that uh that that they did and he says uh he said unto them when you pray say this Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in uh in L why don't we say it right thy will be done on Earth thy will be done as in heaven so in Earth and give us this day our daily bread and so forth forgive us our trespasses and as as the prayer goes on you're familiar uh you're familiar with it and so therefore uh it is a it is a good thing for us to pray this way because Jesus taught us to pray this way and so let's take a a little bit of a look at that now here's the problem if you like or here's the challenge is that according to the scripture we really don't know how to pray or what to pray for right right in Romans chapter 8 it says likewise the spirit also help with our infirmities and our infirmities are weaknesses the Holy Spirit helps us with our weaknesses and we know not what we should pray for for as we are I know that there's some of you that are here at camp and well maybe not here but maybe there's someone you know who's praying Lord let that girl notice me let that girl I I believe she's the one I want I want to marry her I'm 16 and she's 15 and we're ready Lord and I believe it's the will of God lord just just allow her to look my way and if she comes to breakfast this morning wearing a skirt and a a shirt and and and uh she's sitting on a table full of girls I know that's the will of God I know and I'm going to claim her well you know good luck with that uh it it may not be the will of God and and there are things that uh we all have prayed for in our lives that we found out later were not the will of God but there was a time in your life and you really wanted it but you know God knows better doesn't he he knows better about us and the Bible tells us here that uh the spirit maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searches the hearts knowth what is the mind of of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God so what's better it's better to pursue the will of God isn't it it's better to know the will of God I I mean when I met my wife I knew I knew I you know I I often would ask people I'd ask my brothers and I'd say hey how did you know how did you know that that your your wife was the one and they they all said I just knew I said that's not an answer how did you know they' say well I I I I just knew and I'd ask different people older people and I'd say how did you know that that was the will of God for you how did you know that she was the one and then most often 99% of the time people say you know what I just knew because that is not something that you want to have somebody else tell you right you want to know yourself and and but that was not good enough for me as a single person and then years after I was married I was at Louisiana camp and some young snickle Fritz came up and asked me said brother Mary how' you know that sister Becca was the one I looked at him I said I just knew cuz it was love at first sight you believe in love at first sight that's a weak yes brother random said when Adam saw Eve it was love at first sight he said when Isaac saw Rebecca it was love at first sight he said when Jesus sees the bride in glory it'll be love at first sight when I saw my wife it was love at first sight let me tell you and uh the rest is history so there are things that we don't often know how to pray for and there are things that uh because we are limited to knowing the future as a matter of fact you don't know any of it uh we are we are rely we have to rely upon God but the next verse in Romans 8 says all things work together for good to them that love God and them are the called according to his purpose so we're going to trust in the Holy Spirit to help us help lead us to the right thing and the right answers and the right uh the perfect will of God for our lives that's what we absolutely should do so then the question is how should we pray and let's let's deal with that let me give you a little bit of info and then we'll give you some examples here in the Supernatural sermon brother Ram said prayer is not a perhaps prayer is a sincere thing prayer is talking to God now it's really interesting in the Hebrew language uh there's two words for the word talk and one of the words is the formal uh speaking of a prophet when a prophet came and said thus sayeth the Lord this day Thou shalt die I mean that's the formal God talking that prophets did we don't talk like that right you don't go into Walmart and say thou shall give me 10 bananas lest thou die we don't we don't talk like that and if you talk to your wife like that well you don't want to talk to your wife like that this is the the word for the the ordinary conversation that you would have with somebody so in in the scripture when it talks talks about prayer in this way there there is a a casual talking that that we would use so in Deuteronomy chapter 8 uh the Bible says that uh you know when you talk to your sons and your daughters and you talk about things in your house and at the gate and and uh you know in in around your table in the book of Deuteronomy it means that we're going to we're going to talk about things as human beings would talk and just in conversation and this is the idea that brother Ram's trying to get us acquainted with that prayer is talking to God prayer is not getting down and shut your eyes and think about your washing and your work and say Lord help me uh John and help Miss Jones and so forth he said that's not prayer that's repeating some words but prayer is to come into a atmosphere say it atmosphere now an atmosphere that changes the whole picture here he says prayer means coming into an atmosphere when you realize you're in the presence of God moving into the deepest of sincerity and first you say a little worship like oh Jehovah how I love you or like Jesus said Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come and and brother R says we worship a little bit first and and and say oh oh Lord how I love you and how I appreciate you and how I thank you for salvation and all the rest and after the worship come you come with a sincere heart asking and presenting your petitions before God right and he tells us to do that cast all of our cares upon him because he cares for you right so that's what we should do I will tell you some uh I'll tell you a good way not to create the atmosphere and that is to go to prayer like this you can't do that that's right you can't be plugged in and unplugged at the same time right and and and I believe if we're going to create a right atmosphere we need to make sure that we're in the right place so that uh you know there are no distractions and that's hard today I realize that's hard but that's what that's what brother's telling us about you get into an atmosphere and so here's brother bom again in blind B and forgive me here for reading I'll read quickly I won't read it all but you'll have the PowerPoint he said you know there's something about getting Al loone to yourself and this is great cuz here's here's how brother brandom did it here's how he prayed all right so just for your information he said there's something about getting alone to yourself and many people never pray until they come to church yeah thinks the only place to pray is app church but the Bible said for men to pray say everywhere lifting up holy hands and then when we get by ourselves we usually pray different than what we would if we pray if we're in church let me tell you I'll tell you I I will say that you'll pray differently when the blessings are flowing and uh you know that girl actually took a side glance at you when you left the dining hall and you know I I mean when things are going well and uh you know you're blessed in service and we pray a certain way we thank God and thank God for the lovely day I will guarantee you you'll pray differently when things go sour in your life oh yes when you see that girl and she gets up and walks out with another guy huh you'll pray differently when your health is not so great you'll pray differently when uh you have problems in your church and you'll pray differently when you lose your job right you pray differently when you start in tests and so on and and so brother random says we'll pray differently when we're alone and it's a secret prayer that Jesus spoke about enter into a secret closet and close the door and when you have did so pray to your father who sees in secret and he that sees in secret will reward in public and so he says when we're praying like that there seems to be something that takes all the hypocrisy out of it so you're not trying to put on a show and say fancy words he said it seems like to be getting a better connection with God to get alone I think it's a good thing to have a connection with God don't you and he said we get in a better connection with God when we get alone and there's been many times in my life as perhaps in your life that you just have to get alone once in a while with Jesus and I've taken my car and drove down the road studying and I got off on some country road till it became so I became so filled with his mercies and goodness and he said I just stopped the car and hold a wheel and WEP like a baby many times I've climbed up in the mountains where many and thought I was hunting but he said go up and sit on the rock look like up to the sky and he says my whole innermost being became filled with something oh he said everything in the world seemed to pass away all for those precious hours alone with God the last thing he says and it's there when the greatest Revelation and inspiration comes is when you're alone with God I mean do you get the point he's saying over and over again that being alone with God is a good thing being alone with just you and your phone and God it's a good thing right as you're on Facebook you have 200 billion people who are on there with you and that's a good thing and he said and it's there and being sarcastic is that you were on Facebook is that Facebook live no oh okay all right and it's there you're just saying that right and it's there that when the greatest Revelation and inspiration comes is when we're alone with God and we better take we take more time on that I'm sure if if we take more time on that I'm sure we would live a better life and a more Victorious Life In Christ we would take more he said and take more time on that I'm sure that we would live a better life and more victorious in Christ now just very briefly the Hebrew word for prayer is really interesting because it means to reconcile now listen to this for a moment here when when the when the word prayer is mentioned in the Old Testament it means that you have to take a view you have to take a view of yourself and a you like God sees the problem that's the way they that's the way the word is formed and it it means that you're going to reconcile these two things so in other words let's say that I have a problem uh you know I got a I got a decision to make about uh college or you know I'm graduating from high school and I I got to make a decision now do I go to work do I go to college do I take a trade or whatever else and all of those things are perfectly fine but you got to look at that so what you have to do is reconcile this view as if God was looking at it all right so that's the way they taught it and they said so in other words I look at it one way and I look at options and I don't know what what is best I could do that I could do this I could do something else but when you begin to look at things like God is looking at it it changes your perspective so in other words you're going to say Lord I know you're looking at my life and this crossroad that I'm at and I'm I'm confident that you know my future you know the will of God for me the Bible says you do Romans 8 and I know that you have a path you have a purpose for bringing me on the earth in this hour and you have a will for me and when I when I begin to say things like that and I Look to God you know what my decision in a sense seems trivial or my worry seems trivial I know that God's got my back can you say amen I know that God uh has a will for me and that God's going to fulfill his will so when I reconcile a two my worries really should fade away because his way is higher than my way his way is better than my way his way will bring all the things into my life that God wants to bring in my life so I'm going to rest in the fact that God's looking at this and he knows my future he knows my path he knows everything that's going to take place in my life and so therefore I'm just not going to wor I'm just not going to worry amen and when when we talk about reconciling those two things uh if you hang on to it and you look at out only through your lens very often you'll get worried about things and you'll get despondent about things and you'll get troubled about things but when we look at it like God looks at it let me tell you we know that he knows the end from the beginning he knows the beginning of your life and the end of your life and he knows how to get you there because I said as I said in the first quote the greatest thing is to be led by God isn't that right and he wants to do that he wants to do that in your life so there's something about living in this atmosphere of Prayer praying constantly and just being submissive to the will of God there's something really neat about it and when did the disciples you remember the story in Matthew chap 17 and they came to Jesus and uh apart and the apart means that they had just left the scene where there was an epileptic boy that uh you know often cut himself you remember the story and he threw himself in the fire and he took fits and I mean it was pretty bad it was bad enough that this father was desperate and he called his disciples uh Jesus disciples and said can you cast out this devil from him and they tried and they couldn't and they did everything they could but they couldn't and so then Jesus comes along and one of the lowest exhibitions of faith in the Bible was when that father said to him if thou C if you can could you pray for my boy and to me that that that is a man who is a desperate because uh you know he's at a point where he's he's practically got nothing left in reserve he's got no faith at all hardly not that he's a bad man but I mean he's desperate and he's watching the Disciples of Jesus pray and they can't cast this demon out and so Jesus speaks to that demon and it goes and so forth and then they go apart and when they go apart the disciples ask Jesus and they said why couldn't we cast them out how come we could pray all of us and nothing happened and then you come along and and pray and the boy is completely healed and Jesus said to them because of your unbelief for verily I say unto you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed he said You shall say to this mountain remove Hands To Yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible to you great answer and then he says how Beth this kind goeth not out by prayer and fasting and it's interesting because Jesus didn't either he didn't fast right and he didn't go off and pray uh separately but he just spoke to that demon that was there and he left that boy you know why I believe because he lived in a communion with God he lived in a place where he knew exactly where he stood and so he didn't need to go and prepare himself and that's why it's a good thing for us to pray continually because we never know we never know when we're going to be called upon to pray and and if you only pray in church you're going to depend on the atmosphere of church in order for you to uh pray easily but there's a lot a lot of times when crisis will arise and you're not in church and you need to pray because something's happening and something's going on right and that's why it's a good thing to live in this in this place it's a good thing to live uh in that in that uh in that in the spirit of God now let me uh let me just say this uh this is a I'm going to skip just a little bit here and in the Book of John John be record saying I saw the SP spirit of God I saw the spirit of God can I have that na right there this what he said I saw the spirit of God descending from heaven like a dove and had aod upon him and I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him listen to me he said he whom the spirit descends and remains on him the same as he which baptized him with the Holy Ghost and I saw him bear record that this is the Son of God so Jesus now when he shows up at the river John sees the spirit descend on him and remain now you can be in a meeting like we're in and the spirit of God can descend isn't that right sure but you know what that's not the greatest challenge because if you didn't experience some touch of the Holy Spirit last night you're dead right but the remaining part is a challenge so therefore every step you take has to be with the spirit in mind because the spirit is easily grieved isn't that right so let's say it this way let's say this is the holy spirit because it's white and it's like a dove like that let's say that when Jesus walked and he had the spirit that descended on him it's one thing to have the spirit to sin but it's another thing for have it for him having it to remain with him right so every step he took he took with the spirit in mind I want to make sure that I do nothing in my in my days that Grieves the holy spirit so everything I do every way I talk everything I say to my wife everything that I do I want to make sure that he's there at the beginning of the day I want to be sure he's there at the end of the day I want to be sure he's there and if I make a mistake and the spirit FES off because he's easily grieved I'm going to try to make that right because I don't want to go too far today without the spirit of God very close to me isn't that right and so therefore I believe it's a good practice for us to say every step I take I want to keep the spirit in mind yeah I may actually offend I may offend other people or other people may not understand but you know what I I'm my first priority is to make sure I don't offend the holy spirit is that all right and that's what that's what Jesus had and that's the way that Jesus lived and that's the way that Jesus walked now brother R also says in in Christ's mystery God revealed he said I was riding with a man he said one one time and man said to me think of it he said we are here this on this earth and the way we are he says we can only know or say uh that were saved by some Jewish Fable called The Bible and I said sir I don't believe it's a Jewish Fable and he said well when you pray what do you pray to and I asked for a certain certain thing and I didn't get it so brother BR what do you pray to and I said you pray wrong we should never pray to change God's mind we should pray to change our mind because God's mind doesn't need change that's right how many would agree amen God's mind doesn't need changing and so therefore I look at prayer as an exchange an exchange means that Jesus told us come unto me all ye that are heavy laden that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest and take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest to your souls for my yoke is easy that word means manageable many times when we go to God it's because of a crisis in our life and we can't manage it I mean if you could fix it you would right if you could uh work it out you would but there are times in life when things come your way that are really unmanageable and Jesus said hey tell you what you do you take my Yol because it's manageable and you take my burden because that burden is light and in the Greek that means agile that's where we get our word agile when you are burdened with something you know you're really troubled by something uh it sometimes you feel like every step is a is is a struggle and uh you know you don't have any Joy you don't have any peace and you're not very Nimble and people can even look at you and say hey there's something I noticed there's something wrong with you and you're not moving like you should Jesus said I'll tell you what to do you give me my burden I'll give you my yoke and he said my yoke is manageable and it'll keep you agile in other words you have a an awareness you have a peace that you know what God's got it he's got it he's got it under control I just GED the Holy Spirit he's got it under control he's got everything uh in his place it's going to be all right and that's what prayer is in it's an exchange it is an exchange so that God takes it and your man you're your agile now let me give you a little example we find over here in the book of Acts you know the story Peter's in prison he's in prison for doing nothing wrong but he's in prison he's laying down on the ground between two guards he's chained to those guards right everybody know the story he's chained to those two guards and he's laying there on the floor in the Middle East prisons are pretty Dirty Rotten Dark Places and filled with water and lots of other things and Peter is laying there on the ground there's two prisoners two guards that are chained to him there's two also standing in the room there's an iron gate and then there's all kinds of guards outside and then there's a big Iron Gate that goes out through the street that's the way I've been in some prisons as a visitor in the Middle East and I've seen so Peter figures wow my days are numbered you know uh my goodness this is the end of the road for me and the Bible says there that as he was sleeping between the two CH soldiers and he was bound with chains an angel shows up and smites him on the side and says stand up and Peter says yeah right he said no stand up on your feet and he stands up and he can't and he's looking down at these guards and they're still asleep and he's looking at this and he says the angel says as the chains fell off his hand the angel said g thyself bind thy sandals on and so he did and he said cast thy garment about thee and follow me so Peter's kind of walking out and he stands in front of the door and the door swings open doesn't touch it the door swings open brother brandom said one time years ago that he and his wife were walking into a supermarket in Jeffersonville and he said he stood in front of the door and swung open and when he saw that you know how they do it in supermarkets right in stores and so forth today and there's a an eye that's watching you there and brother manam looked at that and he just turned to his wife wife right away and he said the Bible had that first and and he Peter's standing there and he stands in front of the door you're the door okay and he stands in front of the door and the door swings open he it whoa and he and he walks out and he goes out this Angel is accompanying him and he walks out goes past all the guards nobody sees him and then he he comes to the Big Iron Gate and he stands in front of the door and it opens up whoa I mean he's enjoying this and he walks out and and he's on the street oh he's you know now he's happy and he's he's you know he's this hey this is all right this is all right and so at the same time there are people praying for him down at John Mark's house right you know the story and Peter says well hey I know where everybody is everybody's at the prayer meeting tonight and so therefore I'll go down there and he stands in front of the door yeah yeah hello hello he stands in front of the door and nothing happen right let me do it again and Peter comes up to the door nothing happened so he decides to knock on the door and when he does the lady there the girl opens up the window shade because everybody's afraid at that period of time she opens up the shade and says it's and he says it's Peter he died that's his Spirit out there they said Hey listen open the door what do you got to lose that's a spirit don't worry and so they open up the door and he Mars Peter what does that tell us that tells me this that there are times in life when you're going to come to doors that are absolutely locked in front of you and you will not be able to open them and when you come to those kinds of doors God will supernaturally open those doors for you but there's going to be other doors that you come to that you can open yourself and God puts Tools in our hands and we should use them right there are situations that are impossible and when you get to that place God will actually open that door make access for you but there are times in life when there's things you can do and you can change and you can ask forgiveness and you can pray and you can make things right and there are things that you can do to open doors in your life and that's exactly what the Holy Spirit wants you to do because God has put those tools into our lives yes sir right let's go back to our text for a moment here Jesus said I got to watch my time here Jesus said thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven so just think about this now the way he told us to pray thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven right so Jesus said listen there should be a match between what happens here and what happens there that's right do you understand yes Lord and this is the way he taught us to pray he said thy will be done thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven so we should pray in this way to say Lord let my life match what happens in the Kingdom because what happens in the kingdom is better than what happens here yeah there are laws that work up there that are better laws than laws here right that's right let me tell you there are things that happen in that Kingdom uh that are more powerful than what happens here I believe when Jesus walked on the water he was operating by a law of that Kingdom not of this one right if you're going to operate by the laws of this Kingdom and you walk on the water you're going to have a different outcome than what Jesus had but when he was walking on the water he was walking according to the laws of that Kingdom there right now think about this when when a Son of God when a Son of God prays and they actually are living according to the laws of that Kingdom what happens in their life is different than what would happen here okay so for instance remember on the story of the Mount of uh when when Jesus was teaching the people and uh there was 5,000 of them there and Jesus said all right Hey listen let's take a break let's have lunch and they said hey we didn't bring anything to feed these people besides there's 5,000 people here and Jesus said you didn't bring anything and he said no uh the disciples said no we didn't bring anything at all matter of fact there's no food out here I've been out there where that is and there's no stores there's no hey there's not even a Walmart out there if you can believe it there's not even a Walmart and so Jesus is say looking at the disciple now he knows what's going to take place but he's looking at them he said you brought nothing and they said no we brought nothing and they said the only thing we have is a little boy over here has his lunch and he's got two loaves of bread and five fishes or two fishes and a couple loaves of bread and uh that's all we've got and Jesus said hey all right tell you what make the people sit down and bring that boy over here and let me take his lunch when the food passed into his hands and he gave thanks thanks for it it passed because it was in the hands of the Son of God it passed now under the rules of that Kingdom and something happened because in that Kingdom there's no starvation there's no hunger in that Kingdom there's no thirst isn't that right in that Kingdom there's no death in that Kingdom there's no sickness in that Kingdom there's no sorrow right and Jesus said thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven so when he took that bread in his hands all of a sudden it multiplied because it's not under the rule of this world it's under the rules of that world and something Supernatural happen in the same way that when Samson took the Jawbone of a of a mule let me tell you that's not the kind of tool that you would use in a war but when he took it in his hand as a Son of God under the commission of God something happened to that bone and now it was operating according to those rules over there and not these rules here and he won the victory because because thy will be done on Earth as is in heaven in heaven there's no defeat in heaven there's no loss in heaven there's no surrender and when you take something in prayer and you take something in your hand because you are a son of God and you're praying and say Lord thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven let me tell you things happen why do you think brother brandom had so much success in prayer and talking with people because in that Kingdom there's no sickness right and he's walking in that realm he's walking in that atmosphere with God and let me tell you Supernatural things happen uh when you uh when you walk in that place with God Amen true Walking with God is a powerful thing yes sir Walking with God is a beautiful thing Walking with God will convict you and change your attitude about things that happen in your life I wish we had a little bit more time to talk about this particular subject here but Paul writes to and says sorry I'm flipping here in 1 Thessalonians chap 4 he says furthermore he says we beseech you Brethren and exort You by the Lord Jesus that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God so you would abound more and more for you know what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus and this is the will of God even your sanctification Hey listen up this is the will of God this is what Paul is telling us is the will of God for us he said this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication right that's right that's a pretty weak amen we should abstain from fornication amen fornication is sexual sin between people who are not married right let me let me give you a little piece of advice God hates sexual sin yes God destroyed Sodom because of sexual sin and other instances in scripture we understand that like I said yesterday that uh intimacy uh shouldn't be in our vocabulary or in our sight until we make a Comm commitment with somebody and God looks at that very carefully and that every one of you every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and in honor not in the lust of dirty mindedness yeah that's what concubines is we don't use that word in our English language but it means dirty- mindedness and he says we should not walk it's not the will of God for you to walk continually remembering what you saw on a website but rather we should know how to possess our vessel and not walk in the lust of even as the Gentiles which know not God right yeah we are different yes come on folks we are different we should act different we should dress different I believe that when we come here as guys we should not have to struggle with how girls are dressed in a place like this because you all profess the message you all profess to be Christians yeah and we should not have to struggle or turn our eyes because somebody the way somebody is dressed here on is that all right that no man go beyond on and defraud his brother in any manner because that the Lord is the Avenger of all such as we have forewarned you and testified for God has not called us to uncleanness but he's called us to social media no God's called us to Holiness yes and Holiness in his raw definition means separation so therefore how they do it in the world is not your cue we're not learning from the cosmos how to live how to dress how to listen to music and how to how to do things we are learning from those that have taught us we're learning from the word of God we're learning by revelation we are learning in every way that God's made accessible to us how to live in a way that pleases God you know why because I want to make sure I want to make sure I don't grieve the Holy Spirit that's right every step I take I want to keep him in mind yeah so you girls ought to look at that and say if I wear this is this going to be here if I don't wear this is this going to say and that's the kind of question that you should be looking at yeah you say well it won't make me popular but it'll keep you in the will of God and that's what's most important and so so it it's it's it's really vital it's really critical uh for us to uh be mindful of this fact that uh God has given us things so that we would know and it's important for you to apply because like I said yesterday a token is useless unless it's apply if you had a bucket of Blood by the door and you were living in the first Exodus it would absolutely do you no good unless you took it and applied it on the door post of your house you can know about it like brother Andrew said you can know about it you can be sympathetic towards it but let me tell you the token will do you no good until you apply it and where you apply it is everywhere in your life including your phone including your wardrobe including your uh you know your car when you're alone everything else you need to apply that token and that's how you need to live yes sir because the message is not just a bunch of instructions that God has given to us uh hoping that we would make it that's not why God gave us this message so that uh like here's all the sermons and if you read those and you read your Bible you know what uh good luck see you in the Millennium that's not what he said I don't find anyone where where brother BR said that I don't also find anywhere where brother BR said just stay home and play Tes amen I mean if he said that I'd preach that but he didn't say it you got to talk to God you got to live for God you have to make sure that you're in tune with God and remember no matter what happens around you there is only one evidence there is one true evidence of having the baptism of the Holy Spirit and that is believing the word for your days isn't that right A lot of people will do lots of things our world around us will change uh things get darker narrower as the Bible says and so forth but let me tell you there's an evidence that you need to rely on not your feelings and not what everybody else in your cabin does now what other churches do you need to make sure that you believe the word for your hour that's right and you should say Lord make that real make that firm to me make that clear so nothing moves me no matter what takes place in our world because God did not say I'm just going to give you this message do with it what you want good luck I'll see you in the Millennium happy happy tribulation for the rest of the world God didn't say that no so I need to volunteer I need to volunteer and I don't want you to put your hand up I need you to come down here he knows who he is I don't need you hey I appreciate you volunteer but I already had this volunteer lineup thanks buddy appreciate it come on down here brother the cine now we're going to I I I just want to close and illustrate with this because I I I'm just R out of time it' be nice uh to to end this way grab a seat now Jesus said uh this to me now the part of the real reason why God sent the message is to have uh to make sure that we get there to his house and Jesus said I'm gone he said I'm going to go to my father's house and prepare a house for you so that where I am there you may be also so the goal is that he's he needs to come to my house if I'm Jesus he needs to come to my house right that's the goal CU we don't want to leave him here because leaving him here means is's going to be smack in the middle of tribulation tribulation is not a place of you or anyone else would want to be so he's got to get the mil house that's a challenge do you know the way do you know the way to your heavenly home I mean can you give me direction no when you die you go left right north south you don't know right and all of us we don't know so we're trusting that the God in us will bring us to where we need to be but let me illustrate it this way there's two ways for him to get to my house now I'm Not Jesus now I'm me so if I if I if I I wanted brother Kathy here to come what's your first name uh Elijah Elijah Elijah or not Elijah Elijah Elijah what a j Wonder good name what I don't have to double portion you don't have to double portion you're just a single dude okay he's a single dude just say to your pH number only joking all right so brother Eli j is here and I want him to come to my house two ways for me to get into my house all right one of them is I can tell him how to get there and I can give him instructions about how to get to my house all right you ready you need to listen to this all right cuz it's going to get you to my house now you need to leave leave out of here okay and you go down to the main road whatever that is and then you take a right and when you take the right you're going to be hooking up with I think it's 278 and 278 will wind you around and you come to Carol and you come to another little town before Bard and that turns into 60 and then that turns into 44 okay there just little side roads there hey don't laugh remember this and so when you when you get there and you come to Bard and you're going to work your way towards Ashville okay so there's another Ro I think it's 276 and you're going to take 276 it winds around but it'll actually bring it to the outside outskirts of Asheville and so you want to watch for that to get on 40 for a short period of time only short and then you're going to make a left actually the the exit R goes right and then you're going to go to 26 and 26 will take you over the mountain through Johnson City all right so when you get into Johnson City go Pastor don't stop and you go P there and you go to 40 and when he gets on 40 he'll sorry sorry 81 you get on Interstate 81 go right across there and that'll bring you right to withv right into Virginia past Bristol and Abington and so forth get all the way to wivi don't stop at withi okay but you going even though sister Becky was born right there don't stop there okay keep going and and then you go all the about 45 minutes more and then you come to exod 114 when you get to exod 114 there a great big hospital there and to be a sign there and you're going to take Pig Path Road say it after me pig Path Road and then you get on that road you so you're going to right off the interstate you're going to go left on Pig path and it's going to wind you down through the countryside farms and smelly as they raise Hogs there and then you come down on the route eight okay when you go to Route eight and you're going to go to the Post Office watch for the post office in Riner there's a big flag there it's always half mask cuz the guy's ex marine green and so you always got a p flag on there so watch that's white and so then when you come to the post office turn left on Union Valley you go a half mile on Union Valley and you come to surface surface you turn the left and you go to the end of the road to Tac and that house is mine got it let me ask you a question how many of you think that he's going to make it with those instructions come on let's be honest no does anyone here believe that he's going to now that is the way to my house you ask my wife she doesn't tell lies you doesn't stretch anything like me and so that is literally the way to my house but I don't think he's going to get there with those instructions neither did God give us this message as a bunch of instructions saying figure it out get there on your own good luck see in the in the marriage supper he didn't do it that way you know what he did he said I'll be with you that's right even in you to the end of the world isn't that right that's right so the second way to get to my house brother Elijah is to do this I'll go with you yeah there you go now you drive okay and I'll tell you where to go and when you're when you're heading down the road and I'll tell you what turns it take okay because I know the way to my own house yeah I know where I live so I don't need to explain a bunch of stuff to you you just follow the directions okay follow where I'm going and when you when you need to turn right and turn right when you turn left and turn left and you know what if you make a mistake I'll correct you because after all I know the way to my own house are you following me he didn't give us a message and send us on our road he said I'll be with you and and even in you until the end of the way and so now how many of you think that he's going to get to my house number two is a better option isn't it so the only thing that he's got to do is listen to the voice that's guiding him he's got to listen to the instructions that are given to him and God needs those real and God will Don't Clap Don't Clap I don't have time he's got to listen whenever God corrects him he's got to listen whenever he Bears on the wrong pathway he's got to do urns along the way he's got to say oh sorry I made the wrong turn turn to quickly and he's got to uh make adjustments to his pathway but he's confident that I know where my house is and he's resting in that leadership BL just give the hand things to God I will tell you that's exactly how he wants you to live your life don't try to figure it out don't try to make all the decisions yourself don't try to lead yourself he is in you to lead you and guide you to the end of the world and he knows exactly where you need to be and he knows exactly how to get you there you just pay attention to him and make sure that whatever he says you listen to that and act on it because you need to be not only a hearer of the word but a doer of the word as well let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness and your mercy we thank you for your word and your love to us we're resting on the fact that Lord you are our guide you are our comforter Lord we want to be found in the will of almighty God in every phase of Life you've given all these young people Lord a season in which to live in their singleness I pray that they would take advantage of that and Lord they would be used of you and they would be trained by you and they'd be molded by you and they would be shaped by you in their thinking and their understanding and not in the wokeness of the world but Lord in the reality of the truth of scripture and I pray that you would guide them and lead them Lord because you promised you said you never leave us nor forsake us and Lord we're resting on them bless our day we commit it to you Lord we give it to you like an offering we present our bodies as living sacrifices holy and acceptable unto you because that's our reasonable service we love you we thank you Lord and we appreciate the opportunity Lord to learn from your word in Jesus name we pray and all God's people said amen Amen brother Anthony
