[45:48] verse 27
[45:50] so god created man in his own image
[45:53] and the image of god created he him male
[45:57] and female created
[45:58] he them heavenly father we thank you
[46:01] lord for the reading of your word
[46:02] tonight
[46:03] knowing god that your word is a seed
[46:06] lord and that when it's planted
[46:08] in good ground lord that it brings forth
[46:10] your purpose it brings forth lord your
[46:12] life
[46:13] so we just ask god right now lord as we
[46:16] have worshipped you lord and
[46:18] lord the church is saying and we've
[46:20] played our music lord we used our voices
[46:22] to lift
[46:23] praises to your name lord we pray father
[46:25] now you would come
[46:27] lord and take over father lord may you

[46:39] father i pray that you'd be with us in
[46:41] all things in jesus christ's name
[46:43] amen you can be seated tonight
[46:48] we'd like to just pick up right where we
[46:50] were where we left off
[46:54] on bride character and i i would
[46:57] subtitle this a few different titles but
[46:59] i just didn't have one that was real
[47:00] clear
[47:01] and so we're just going to go with part
[47:02] two of this i want you to notice and
[47:05] without
[47:06] recapping so much of what we covered uh
[47:09] the first time we spoke on this we're
[47:11] going to just touch
[47:12] and highlight some of it that we spoke
[47:14] on and then just move to something else
[47:17] if the lord would be our help tonight
[47:19] genesis 1 chapter
[47:21] chapter 1 verse 27 have that up if you
[47:23] could and hold it in your bible
[47:24] i want to just uh to look there again
[47:27] hold your place there in genesis chapter
[47:29] one we're going to read it just one more
[47:31] time so god created man in his own
[47:33] image in the image of god created he him
[47:37] male and female created he them so
[47:40] what's amazing when you look at the
[47:42] creation and the creation account that
[47:44] you find here
[47:45] when god is creating man you notice that
[47:48] god didn't create any of the animals
[47:51] in the likeness of himself but he
[47:53] created each animal with their own
[47:55] nature
[47:55] he created each animal with their own
[47:57] image and
[47:59] we identify today an animal and in every
[48:02] specie
[48:03] uh you could identify by the way that it
[48:06] by the way that it's built its anatomy
[48:08] but the bible says that about man he was
[48:11] different
[48:12] and and and he wasn't like an animal the
[48:14] world today
[48:16] uh secularism wants you just to believe
[48:18] that we're we're just
[48:20] animals that that's what a a a a human
[48:22] being is
[48:23] you know even i was reading today uh an
[48:26] answer
[48:27] on the internet just from someone who
[48:28] posted decora
[48:30] you know what is the what is the isla i
[48:32] think the question was
[48:34] is life a blessing or is life a curse
[48:38] and this uh this really uh sophisticated
[48:41] person
[48:42] got on there to give this long diatribe
[48:44] about
[48:45] how that life is neither it's neither a
[48:48] blessing nor a curse it's just
[48:50] the uh the natural uh evolution that
[48:53] we're just made up of gases and
[48:55] materials from the earth and
[48:56] life doesn't have a purpose it doesn't
[48:58] have a meaning we're just an
[48:59] animal you know where we have the same
[49:02] all nature that
[49:03] you see in the world there's a predator
[49:05] there's a prey and he was
[49:07] using that to say that you know a world
[49:08] is that's what life is really about
[49:10] we're just
[49:11] another animal and we all have a
[49:13] predator instinct and
[49:15] and then there's there's those that are
[49:16] the predator and then those that are the
[49:18] prey
[49:19] and uh and he went on to say how that
[49:21] you know that that if you're lucky and
[49:23] you're blessed and you're
[49:24] you know in life and you're skilled and
[49:26] talented maybe greater than
[49:28] some of the other animals then you
[49:30] become the predator but if you're less
[49:31] fortunate
[49:32] and you know you're not you're small and
[49:34] and you know and you don't have a lot of
[49:36] strength and you don't
[49:37] have a lot of ability or a lot of talent
[49:39] well then you're just
[49:40] the prey and and i just read that answer
[49:44] and it was much
[49:45] longer i'm just condensing much longer
[49:47] and you know and
[49:48] and very uh very articulate the way he
[49:51] put it all out there and i
[49:52] i thought just like the apostle paul i
[49:55] thought you know if if
[49:56] if if i didn't have god
[50:00] i would be of all men most miserable if
[50:03] i didn't have an understanding of what
[50:04] the purpose of the meaning of life
[50:06] is and and god creates man with the
[50:10] knowledge even the bible speaks of that
[50:12] and says that there's a knowledge of
[50:14] the creator inside all humanity but the
[50:17] bible says that god was
[50:19] that god created man and he creates him
[50:22] in his own image or in his own
[50:25] likeness genesis 2 verse 7 we want to
[50:28] read
[50:29] in genesis chapter 2 verse 7 and the
[50:32] lord god formed man
[50:34] of the dust of the ground and breathed
[50:36] into his
[50:37] nostrils the breath of life and man
[50:40] became
[50:41] a living soul so the first here was the
[50:45] first
[50:45] original human being here was adam as he
[50:49] was
[50:50] formed and the bible says he takes of
[50:52] this lump of clay
[50:53] any any any and he takes this lump of
[50:55] clay he begins to
[50:57] uh as a great architect as a great
[50:59] designer as a great
[51:01] uh engineer a great artist you could
[51:03] think of all
[51:04] the ways you want to describe this
[51:06] creator but he was he was creating
[51:09] this creation to be in his own image
[51:12] and in his own likeness and the bible
[51:14] says and then he
[51:15] breathes into man uh into his
[51:18] nostrils the breath of life and then it
[51:21] becomes a living soul
[51:23] and so man is is formed and created uh
[51:27] and i could imagine this this man adam
[51:30] was very different than what we are
[51:32] today in a sense
[51:33] very different uh because we know that
[51:36] we're
[51:37] we're we are while we're homo sapien
[51:39] we're a human being
[51:40] but as adam adam was not under a curse
[51:45] adam was not under a disease he was not
[51:47] he
[51:48] there was no sin uh he was he was
[51:51] perfect
[51:52] he was he was you could you could
[51:54] describe him as
[51:55] beautiful uh he was he was just a
[51:58] because you say how because god created
[52:00] him and so god creates him perfect he
[52:03] creates him in beauty
[52:05] he doesn't create him with any flaw he
[52:08] doesn't create him with any
[52:09] defect there's no there's no uh
[52:13] there's nothing lacking in this perfect
[52:15] man
[52:16] uh he was he was he wasn't he couldn't
[52:19] perish
[52:21] life today we're perishing today we're
[52:23] corrupting
[52:24] today all of us every single one of us
[52:27] even the little babies that are
[52:28] here today uh they they're young and
[52:30] they're full of life and they're growing
[52:32] but at the same time
[52:33] there's a law there's a curse that
[52:35] they're under
[52:36] in this human body there's a curse of
[52:38] sin and we're living under the cycle of
[52:41] corruption
[52:42] and if the lord tarries all of our
[52:44] bodies we'll corrupt to the point of
[52:46] death and will go into the ground into a
[52:49] grave and that's the
[52:50] that's that's you say what is that from
[52:53] sin
[52:54] that that that that is that is what we
[52:57] that's what we call
[52:58] pair we're perishable today but adam was
[53:00] not perishable
[53:02] there wasn't there he he had he lived
[53:04] his what he breathed was eternal life
[53:08] because his life came from his father
[53:10] and you say what what was adam was he uh
[53:12] when god created him was
[53:14] he 30 was he 40 was he he wasn't a baby
[53:17] we know that he didn't god didn't form
[53:19] him and breathed into his nostrils the
[53:21] breath of life and he was a little baby
[53:23] no
[53:23] he was but he wasn't an old man either
[53:26] amen he was a perfect man this is why we
[53:29] have we struggle
[53:31] we try to describe this but we struggle
[53:33] because we don't live that's not
[53:35] us we come into this world as a baby and
[53:38] as we go through
[53:39] life we age and we get sick and our body
[53:42] begins to break down but
[53:43] adam was in the prime of life we could
[53:46] say that
[53:47] he was perfect in his in his in in and
[53:50] and brother branham when he goes beyond
[53:51] the curtain of time
[53:52] and he doesn't really give a an exact
[53:55] you know age he just says somewhere
[53:57] you know about 18 to 20 in the prime of
[53:59] life maybe 20 years old
[54:01] you know and just the perfect prime of
[54:03] life he said that's how they all were
[54:05] living he was
[54:06] trying to describe something that for us
[54:08] we really
[54:09] can only imagine that's right so he
[54:11] wasn't a baby he wasn't an
[54:13] old man but we know he was he was in he
[54:15] had
[54:16] he had perfect youth and and you that's
[54:19] why we say
[54:20] you know you're the what is heaven it's
[54:22] just a big youth meeting
[54:24] it's a big young people's gathering and
[54:27] and
[54:27] and when you have youth you have
[54:29] strength you have energy you have
[54:30] vitality you're
[54:32] you're healthy there's no it's it's
[54:34] prior to
[54:35] your back hurting it's prior to any
[54:39] uh you know any diseases that you get
[54:41] you you're you're young today you're
[54:44] young only only once
[54:45] and so in that youth there's health and
[54:47] there's strength and then
[54:49] you know at some point you start to have
[54:51] to fight to to maintain that health and
[54:54] and and that strength and that strength
[54:56] begins to to fail
[54:58] but adam adam could walk you say what
[55:01] was adam he was
[55:02] he was a miniature god he was he was
[55:06] the god of earth god was jehovah was the
[55:08] god of heaven adam was the god of earth
[55:10] adam could walk on water
[55:14] adam could cr adam could con nothing
[55:16] that god could do
[55:17] adam couldn't do adam could do anything
[55:19] god could do he was a god man he was
[55:22] perfect he could
[55:23] he could he could he had his he was in
[55:25] the likeness of his father
[55:27] notice he was in the likeness of his
[55:29] father his father wasn't in his likeness
[55:32] we don't say you know man your son looks
[55:34] just like you you know where we don't
[55:36] say you look just like your son
[55:38] we say your son looks just like you
[55:40] because the the
[55:41] the the genes are passed down they're
[55:43] not passed up
[55:44] and so it was in the likeness of god he
[55:47] looked like god
[55:49] he spoke like god he could he could say
[55:52] to a tree to be
[55:53] picked up and planted over here and let
[55:56] me say this
[55:56] it was it was part of his nature
[56:01] to have faith it was part of his nature
[56:05] to believe
[56:06] that's who he was you know and and so
[56:10] opposite of us here today because
[56:12] it's not natural for you to have faith
[56:14] and believe this
[56:16] it's very natural for you to have doubt
[56:18] and disbelief
[56:21] that comes as part of your nature
[56:25] you say brother matt well i've been born
[56:27] again well i trust that you have
[56:29] so now that now that we can classify you
[56:31] as born again now let me tell you what's
[56:33] natural to you
[56:34] doubt let me tell you what's natural to
[56:37] you
[56:38] fear it's normal you say for a believer
[56:41] yeah for a believer that's what comes
[56:43] as your first instinct your first
[56:46] instinct is doubt
[56:47] you have the word of god the promises of
[56:49] god it takes
[56:51] faith to believe the word of god
[56:54] but for adam he didn't have to quench or
[56:57] he didn't have to strain
[56:58] he didn't have to read enough for the
[57:00] word of god he didn't have to say i'm
[57:01] just going to believe it i'm going to
[57:03] i'm going to step out on faith it was
[57:05] natural for adam to believe
[57:07] it was part of who he was it was part of
[57:10] his makeup it was
[57:11] it was part of his first nature
[57:15] whereas for us our first nature even as
[57:18] as christians even as believers
[57:20] it is in our first nature to react and
[57:22] doubt
[57:23] and disbelief hello
[57:27] all you angels here maybe i'll just
[57:29] preach to those on the internet all of
[57:31] y'all humans out there
[57:32] it's natural for us to doubt that's part
[57:35] of our nature
[57:37] it's natural for us to get upset that's
[57:40] part of our nature
[57:41] thank you brother it's it's you know say
[57:43] brother matt how can you say that
[57:44] because here's what else is natural
[57:46] it's very natural for you to get sick
[57:50] but i'm born again will you still get
[57:52] sick
[57:54] anybody still get sick still get a
[57:56] headache and say well i'm healthy will
[57:57] you still get a headache
[57:59] still get backaches why you say brother
[58:01] matt why is that because that's part of
[58:02] even as a christian
[58:04] even as a believer it's part of your
[58:06] nature because you're under
[58:08] a bodily curse
[58:11] right but for for adam
[58:15] there was no curse faith was natural to
[58:18] adam
[58:19] he could speak the word of god and he
[58:22] didn't have to think about it
[58:23] it just came to him because it was it
[58:25] was part of his makeup it was part of
[58:27] who he was it was part of what he
[58:29] believed for us
[58:30] our nature is the opposite of that our
[58:33] first reaction
[58:34] is to get angry our first reaction is to
[58:37] doubt
[58:37] our first reaction is to have fear but
[58:40] but god so
[58:41] so the same way that adam was a human
[58:44] but in every way in the likeness of god
[58:46] we are the direct reverse of what adam
[58:48] was
[58:51] and so for us we we come and we believe
[58:53] the word
[58:54] we we we give our life to to jesus
[58:57] christ and
[58:58] god indwells us with the spirit and we
[59:00] now we have the spirit of god
[59:01] but yet we still have this carnal nature
[59:04] yet we still have this
[59:05] second part of us that's always there
[59:09] it's always there and so brother branham
[59:11] said it this way
[59:13] he said he said you he said jesus came
[59:16] into the world very different than how
[59:17] you and i came into the world
[59:19] and he said he came straight from
[59:21] thought from theophany
[59:23] he says but you you came into this world
[59:26] as a seed of god that's eternal that's
[59:29] down on the inside of you
[59:30] but you came into a into it in a body of
[59:34] time
[59:35] and and he begins to describe this body
[59:38] of time and this is you know what this
[59:39] is very easy for us to comprehend
[59:42] we think he turned we think uh you know
[59:45] you know you know what's hard for us to
[59:46] comprehend is eternity we preach about
[59:48] eternity we believe in eternity
[59:51] but there's only one part of us that
[59:52] believes in eternity the inner man
[59:55] the inner man believes that the the
[59:57] inner man doesn't struggle with it but
[59:58] the outer man struggles with it
[1:00:00] but but for for for us time is very
[1:00:04] natural and time is so different
[1:00:06] uh than eternity when you look at this
[1:00:09] even and i don't need you to turn i'm
[1:00:10] just gonna brush
[1:00:11] i'm just gonna look at this just really
[1:00:13] quick and just brush over some of these
[1:00:14] scriptures
[1:00:16] ecclesiastes solomon says that which
[1:00:18] hath been is now
[1:00:20] and that which is to be hath already
[1:00:23] been
[1:00:23] and god that's that's just amazing when
[1:00:26] you just think about what he just now
[1:00:27] said there
[1:00:29] that which hath been is now and that
[1:00:32] which is to be
[1:00:33] in other words tomorrow next year next
[1:00:35] month
[1:00:36] the election coming up in in a few days
[1:00:39] has already been amen
[1:00:42] now he's speaking from a perspective of
[1:00:44] eternity here
[1:00:45] this is the perspective that adam and
[1:00:47] eve lived in it was a perspective of
[1:00:49] eternity not time
[1:00:51] it wasn't until a curse comes and that
[1:00:53] mankind falls and now
[1:00:56] eternity is broken and now time begins
[1:00:59] under a curse amen are you following
[1:01:02] here
[1:01:03] and so now man lives by time he measures
[1:01:05] his days
[1:01:06] he measures his life his life is but uh
[1:01:09] is literally measured and you look at we
[1:01:11] we measure everything by time everything
[1:01:14] is what we'll do tomorrow and what's
[1:01:16] going to ha what happened last week and
[1:01:17] what's going to happen next week
[1:01:18] but adam didn't think about what's going
[1:01:20] to happen next year or the next moon
[1:01:22] because there wasn't none it was all
[1:01:23] just life
[1:01:26] and heaven there is no there is no time
[1:01:28] uh what will happen next week or next
[1:01:30] year or next month
[1:01:30] it's just eternity it's life
[1:01:34] listen what what he says here and and
[1:01:36] notice what he what what solomon says
[1:01:38] because
[1:01:39] he's he's he's he's he begins to to
[1:01:42] speak about this and he says something
[1:01:44] that's so amazing
[1:01:45] at this when he begins to talk about
[1:01:47] this concept of eternity
[1:01:49] he says here and and this is just a
[1:01:52] different translation of the same verse
[1:01:54] whatever is has already been
[1:01:59] and what will be has been before
[1:02:02] and god will call the past
[1:02:05] to account he another translation says
[1:02:08] what
[1:02:08] now is has already been
[1:02:11] what is to be already is god retrieves
[1:02:15] what has gone by he brings the past back
[1:02:18] at judgment what's he doing he's
[1:02:20] bringing the past back
[1:02:22] we can't go in the past god can
[1:02:25] and so he says whatever was whatever
[1:02:28] will be
[1:02:29] is that's how it's always with
[1:02:32] god because uh for us we have a hard
[1:02:34] time
[1:02:35] understanding the idea or the concept of
[1:02:37] eternity
[1:02:38] because we're bound by a law called time
[1:02:41] we live in that law
[1:02:43] of time we go we measure everything by
[1:02:46] by years and then
[1:02:47] by months and then by days and then by
[1:02:51] hours and then by seconds and then we've
[1:02:54] broken it even further down into
[1:02:55] milliseconds
[1:02:57] and everything's measured by time and
[1:02:59] how much something how long something
[1:03:02] takes we go through life by time second
[1:03:04] by second minute by minute
[1:03:06] and you can't stop it you can't stop
[1:03:10] time
[1:03:11] i would if i could many times we'd stop
[1:03:14] time and freeze everything but
[1:03:16] we can't do that but and and we can't
[1:03:19] stop it
[1:03:20] we can't we can't make time go faster
[1:03:23] can't speed it up can't speed up the
[1:03:26] process
[1:03:27] you you can't allow you can't make it go
[1:03:29] forward you can't make it go backwards
[1:03:32] because we're trapped under this curse
[1:03:35] we're trapped under this curse of sin
[1:03:38] and beyond all that and
[1:03:40] everything for us has a beginning and
[1:03:42] everything has an
[1:03:43] end but according to what the bible says
[1:03:47] time is just a temporary thing
[1:03:50] that god allowed but one day god will
[1:03:52] say
[1:03:53] time shall be no more
[1:03:56] and so god at one time will say time is
[1:03:58] no more the
[1:03:59] time time is all of the all of history
[1:04:02] as we've taught
[1:04:03] before here history is just his story
[1:04:07] break it up so all of history from
[1:04:09] yesterday today and tomorrow is just
[1:04:12] his story but his story had a beginning
[1:04:15] and a story is going to have an end
[1:04:18] but i'm part of the story that had no
[1:04:21] beginning
[1:04:23] and i'm part of this i'm part of the
[1:04:25] story that has a beginning and end but i
[1:04:27] also am part of the story
[1:04:28] from eternity i'm part of the part of
[1:04:32] the story that has no beginning or end
[1:04:34] that's right
[1:04:36] [Music]
[1:04:39] you try to grasp that your mind blows up
[1:04:41] where did i come from who
[1:04:42] who am i really where did where is my
[1:04:45] origin where am i really from
[1:04:47] amen you know when did my life really
[1:04:50] begin
[1:04:52] when is it really going to end so it's
[1:04:55] all by time we measure it
[1:04:57] let me just find my place here we we
[1:04:59] measure it
[1:05:01] by time but god god comes god the
[1:05:04] the the god is from eternity the bible
[1:05:07] says that he's from
[1:05:08] age to age everlasting that's why god
[1:05:10] could say
[1:05:11] i am the i am in other words not just
[1:05:15] the i was or i'm going to be but who are
[1:05:17] you i'm
[1:05:17] moses said are you i'm the i am right
[1:05:20] now
[1:05:21] you can't no you can't describe that i
[1:05:23] am the i am i am
[1:05:25] and i always was and i always will be
[1:05:29] i'm the uh i'm the i i i the i'm the
[1:05:32] past
[1:05:33] i'm your past i'm your present i'm your
[1:05:35] future
[1:05:36] i'm yesterday i'm today and i'm forever
[1:05:39] is that what the bible says about jesus
[1:05:41] christ
[1:05:41] he's the same yesterday he's the same
[1:05:44] today he's the same forever
[1:05:46] he's called the i am he can move forward
[1:05:49] he can move backwards in time and he
[1:05:53] sees
[1:05:54] all of it not literally like we do here
[1:05:57] today
[1:05:58] but he sees the end from the beginning
[1:06:00] amen
[1:06:02] and he sees it as if it's happened
[1:06:05] already
[1:06:06] and he sees it as if it's happening now
[1:06:09] and he sees it
[1:06:10] as if it's about to happen all three
[1:06:14] because he the concept of time is only
[1:06:16] natural to us but to god it's all
[1:06:18] already happened
[1:06:19] why does the bible says the lamb that
[1:06:21] was slain before the foundation of the
[1:06:23] world
[1:06:24] revelations 13 the lamb that was slain
[1:06:27] before the
[1:06:28] foundation of the world wasn't that the
[1:06:29] lamb was slain it was that all of it was
[1:06:32] already done it's already finished in
[1:06:34] the mind of god
[1:06:37] even when jesus says that it is finished
[1:06:40] what's he speaking of a block a spot
[1:06:43] something has taken place in time and
[1:06:46] now that part of that ministry
[1:06:49] is is finished there's a completion of
[1:06:51] redemption
[1:06:52] but what was god saying when he said the
[1:06:55] the lamb that was slain before the
[1:06:57] foundation of the world
[1:06:58] god was saying it's it was already a
[1:07:01] completed
[1:07:02] work before man ever sinned
[1:07:05] and needed redemption redemption was
[1:07:08] already provided
[1:07:09] before man was ever lost there was
[1:07:11] already a savior to save him amen
[1:07:15] he says here in isaiah 46 verse 10 and i
[1:07:17] don't want to take too much time on this
[1:07:20] he says in isaiah 46 verse 10 i make
[1:07:23] known
[1:07:24] the end from the beginning listen to
[1:07:27] this
[1:07:28] very closely i know you've heard this
[1:07:29] before but listen now let's word it here
[1:07:31] i make known this is this is the king
[1:07:34] that's the king james this is the new
[1:07:35] international version
[1:07:36] i make known the end from the beginning
[1:07:40] from ancient times what is still to come
[1:07:44] i say my purpose will stand
[1:07:48] and i will do all that i please
[1:07:51] amen so we have this concept of time but
[1:07:54] god looks at it from
[1:07:55] eternity he sees all of time as if it's
[1:07:58] happened already it's happening now and
[1:08:01] it's going to happen
[1:08:02] he sees it already done and already
[1:08:04] accomplished
[1:08:05] why do you think you fear where did fear
[1:08:08] come from
[1:08:09] because you don't know what's going to
[1:08:10] happen tomorrow you don't know what
[1:08:13] what waits for you you don't know what's
[1:08:14] going to happen to your children you
[1:08:16] don't know how this problem is going to
[1:08:17] work itself out
[1:08:18] and so you're fearful how am i going to
[1:08:20] take care of this you don't know who's
[1:08:21] going to pay the bill
[1:08:22] on friday but for god there is no fear
[1:08:25] because
[1:08:26] he already sees the answer it's already
[1:08:29] finished it's already completed it's
[1:08:31] already signed sealed delivered
[1:08:33] it's completed your salvation your
[1:08:35] redemption
[1:08:36] the the your inheritance with god
[1:08:40] is already completed
[1:08:43] and now all god has to do is get you in
[1:08:45] line
[1:08:46] and align you in and sync you up with
[1:08:49] his eternal vision
[1:08:54] so he says he has made everything this
[1:08:56] is ecclesiastes 3 11.
[1:09:00] ecclesiastes 3 11. he has made
[1:09:03] everything notice this here
[1:09:05] so god sees everything as if it's
[1:09:07] happened already already accomplished
[1:09:09] all the events the election
[1:09:11] is already over in the mind of god you
[1:09:13] know what he knows who wins
[1:09:16] who you think's going to win oh i don't
[1:09:19] know i think
[1:09:20] i think biden's got it i don't know i
[1:09:22] think trump you know i think 2000
[1:09:23] you see what's going on god doesn't have
[1:09:25] those conversations
[1:09:27] it's already decided it's already set up
[1:09:30] he's already commanded it
[1:09:31] it's already taken place so if he's not
[1:09:35] worried why would we be worried
[1:09:38] if he's not fearful why would we be
[1:09:40] fearful
[1:09:42] we either put our life into his hands
[1:09:44] with his eternal perspective or we don't
[1:09:47] but when you put your life in the in the
[1:09:49] hands of a god who knows the end from
[1:09:51] the beginning
[1:09:52] then you can let go of all fear you can
[1:09:53] let go of all worry you can let go of
[1:09:55] all stress
[1:09:57] because it's already played out in the
[1:09:59] mind of god
[1:10:02] one of the most cringing moments one of
[1:10:04] the most nail-biting moments you can
[1:10:06] have is
[1:10:07] your what yours for your favorite you
[1:10:09] know take a carnal example your favorite
[1:10:11] uh uh golfer your favorite uh race car
[1:10:14] driver your favorite football player
[1:10:15] favorite team
[1:10:16] and and you and and you you emotionally
[1:10:19] invest yourself
[1:10:20] in something that you can't control at
[1:10:22] all
[1:10:23] but we we get so invested in this and
[1:10:25] you know it's that those moments you
[1:10:27] those moments when you're so
[1:10:28] nervous you don't know who's going to
[1:10:30] win you're going to watch the
[1:10:32] you know the the the world series you
[1:10:34] don't know who's going to win
[1:10:36] so you're in anticipation what's going
[1:10:37] to happen i don't know it
[1:10:39] and you know what starts to happen
[1:10:40] anxiety i've watched certain people they
[1:10:42] can't even be in the same room they walk
[1:10:44] out of the room i'll find out what
[1:10:47] happens after it happens they don't want
[1:10:48] to experience it because what if they
[1:10:50] lose
[1:10:51] and so they get fearful and they get
[1:10:53] worried and they get there's excitement
[1:10:55] there's
[1:10:56] an anxiousness and and for some it just
[1:10:59] becomes a miserable experience
[1:11:01] because you just it's almost like ah i'm
[1:11:04] gonna i'll enjoy this
[1:11:05] after it's over and i find out they win
[1:11:07] then i'll celebrate
[1:11:10] but you know what's amazing if you ever
[1:11:12] if you ever go back and watch a rerun
[1:11:14] of your team that already won
[1:11:18] you don't sit there and worry
[1:11:21] you watched the third down you know
[1:11:22] third and and long and they fumbled the
[1:11:24] ball and the other team
[1:11:25] scores and man you don't sit there and
[1:11:27] throw anything you don't get mad you
[1:11:29] don't get upset
[1:11:30] you know why because you know fourth
[1:11:32] quarter's coming and in the fourth
[1:11:33] quarter he threw a touchdown and they
[1:11:34] kicked an old side's kick and you
[1:11:36] already know the entire you
[1:11:38] you follow me when you watch the
[1:11:41] recording
[1:11:42] there's no worry there's no fear
[1:11:45] because it's already happened and guess
[1:11:48] what your team
[1:11:49] already won and my brother my sister we
[1:11:52] shouldn't get so trapped up in time
[1:11:53] where we look at life with such anxiety
[1:11:56] and such worry we don't want to look at
[1:11:57] anything look at the back of the book
[1:11:59] you already won
[1:12:01] you can live this life with no pressure
[1:12:04] no fear
[1:12:04] no anxiety it's already been
[1:12:07] pre-recorded
[1:12:08] in the mind of god and you're a winner
[1:12:10] and you win and your children win
[1:12:12] and your family wins hallelujah
[1:12:16] it's already settled in the mind of god
[1:12:18] there's no reason to fear
[1:12:21] because it's already taken place in
[1:12:23] god's perspective from eternity
[1:12:26] it's already taken place
[1:12:30] he has made listen to this in
[1:12:32] ecclesiastes 3 11. he has made
[1:12:35] everything
[1:12:36] beautiful in his time he has made
[1:12:40] everything beautiful in
[1:12:44] his time he has also set eternity in the
[1:12:49] human heart
[1:12:50] yet no one can fathom no i want to read
[1:12:52] this from the king james he has made
[1:12:54] everything beautiful in his time
[1:12:55] he has also set the world in their heart
[1:12:59] in other words he's already given the
[1:13:01] the the cosmos he's given all humanity
[1:13:04] this concept of eternity so that no man
[1:13:07] can find out the work that god maketh
[1:13:09] from the beginning
[1:13:11] to the end so man it's a it's a
[1:13:14] it was from this eternal perspective
[1:13:17] that
[1:13:18] the the that god comes from and so we
[1:13:20] say who are we really
[1:13:22] we we look at this you know this place
[1:13:25] that adam dwell
[1:13:26] where there was no fear there was no
[1:13:27] worry he he he lived in
[1:13:30] in perfection no anxiety no stress
[1:13:34] but the reason is is that there is a
[1:13:37] there's there's a
[1:13:38] but but for us as i was coming back to
[1:13:40] my train of thought there
[1:13:42] but for us brother branham says but you
[1:13:44] bypassed your theophany
[1:13:48] and he says you came into the world to
[1:13:51] be tested
[1:13:52] and tried you follow me
[1:13:55] you came into this world to be tested
[1:13:58] and tried
[1:13:59] and then you go back to your theophany
[1:14:02] that's why he says you you heard the
[1:14:04] word of god you recognized it as
[1:14:05] eagle's food you left the other thing
[1:14:07] you heard from your theophany
[1:14:09] you've already been translated and trans
[1:14:11] you've already been transfigured into
[1:14:12] the image of his dear son
[1:14:14] but but but your life is all about a
[1:14:16] struggle
[1:14:17] it's all about the struggle paul speaks
[1:14:19] of it in the book of romans
[1:14:21] because we don't come from eternity
[1:14:23] we're going to eternity
[1:14:25] we don't start like adam started we
[1:14:27] start with the curse we start with the
[1:14:29] fall
[1:14:30] and it's and even trying to understand
[1:14:32] this it's amazing to me
[1:14:34] because you you if you think of this as
[1:14:36] a as a human as a believer as a son or
[1:14:38] daughter of god
[1:14:39] you live with two opposing minds the
[1:14:42] bible teaches this
[1:14:44] the mind of the spirit and the carnal
[1:14:46] mind and the bible says the carnal mind
[1:14:50] what is the carnal mind that's your mind
[1:14:52] that you have right now as a believer
[1:14:56] right now you have a carnal mind
[1:15:00] and it wars against the mind of the
[1:15:02] spirit that's what paul said in
[1:15:03] colossians
[1:15:04] it wars against the mind of the spirit
[1:15:07] so
[1:15:07] the bible says the carnal mind is enmity
[1:15:11] with god it says and it can't even know
[1:15:15] the things of god
[1:15:17] but paul paul begins to describe this we
[1:15:19] know the scripture very well
[1:15:21] in romans uh he says this in romans 7
[1:15:24] brother travis can you pull that up
[1:15:25] romans 7
[1:15:26] verse 14. very familiar
[1:15:30] uh scripture paul says for we know that
[1:15:32] the law is spiritual but i
[1:15:35] am carnal sold under sin slave he's
[1:15:38] speaking of slavery
[1:15:39] that's you today right now you're a
[1:15:42] slave
[1:15:44] to this and he says i'm carnal
[1:15:48] a a a sold under sin verse 15 keep just
[1:15:52] keep going
[1:15:53] for that which i do i allow not
[1:15:56] for what i would notice this for what i
[1:16:00] would
[1:16:01] amen that do i not but what i hate
[1:16:05] that do i verse 16. he says
[1:16:09] if then i do that which i don't want to
[1:16:12] do
[1:16:12] i would not i consent unto the law that
[1:16:15] it is good
[1:16:16] verse 17. now then it is no more i that
[1:16:19] do it but
[1:16:20] sin that dwelleth in me
[1:16:24] for i know that in me that is
[1:16:27] in my flesh now he's going to
[1:16:30] why do you think paul makes a
[1:16:32] distinction there
[1:16:34] follow why does paul have to make a
[1:16:37] distinction and say
[1:16:38] now be careful because i'm speaking of
[1:16:40] something for i know that
[1:16:42] in me that is in my flesh
[1:16:45] in other words there's two me's
[1:16:49] and i'm gonna distinct i'm gonna i'm
[1:16:50] gonna identify to make sure you
[1:16:52] understand what i'm speaking of here
[1:16:53] that is this other me the one that
[1:16:57] that that doesn't do what the spirit
[1:16:59] wants me to do amen
[1:17:01] for i know that in me that is in my
[1:17:02] flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will
[1:17:05] is present with me
[1:17:06] but how to perform that which is good i
[1:17:09] find not
[1:17:10] for the good that i would i do not but
[1:17:13] the evil which i would not that i do
[1:17:16] now if i do that i would not it is he
[1:17:18] says for if i do
[1:17:20] that i would not it is no more i that do
[1:17:22] it but
[1:17:23] sin that dwelleth in me i find then
[1:17:27] a law that when i would do good
[1:17:30] evil is present with me for i delight in
[1:17:34] the law of god after the
[1:17:36] here's the other me here's the go back
[1:17:38] here's the other me
[1:17:40] you've got a me in the flesh and he says
[1:17:42] for i delight in the law of god after
[1:17:44] the
[1:17:44] inward man are you following this
[1:17:48] but i see another law in my members
[1:17:51] there's the other man
[1:17:52] warring against the law of my mind and
[1:17:55] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[1:17:57] sin which is in my
[1:17:58] members o wretched man that i am who
[1:18:01] shall deliver me from the body of this
[1:18:03] death and he has a real simple answer
[1:18:06] jesus christ
[1:18:08] amen real simple answer jesus christ but
[1:18:11] you know what it's not that simple it's
[1:18:13] a revelation
[1:18:14] amen who's going to deliver me from this
[1:18:17] war
[1:18:17] jesus christ i want to read you this
[1:18:20] from a from a
[1:18:21] phillips translation he says my own
[1:18:24] behavior
[1:18:25] baffles me for i find myself
[1:18:28] doing what i really loathe
[1:18:31] but not doing what i really want to do
[1:18:35] i often find that i have the will to do
[1:18:39] good
[1:18:39] but not the power when i want to do good
[1:18:43] only evil is within my reach
[1:18:47] it makes me a prisoner to the law of sin
[1:18:51] which is inherent in my mortal body
[1:18:54] amen for left to myself
[1:18:58] i serve the law of god with my mind but
[1:19:01] in my
[1:19:01] unspiritual nature i serve the law of
[1:19:04] sin
[1:19:05] it is an agonizing situation
[1:19:10] who can set me free from the prison of
[1:19:12] this mortal body
[1:19:14] only christ only christ
[1:19:18] so what is he describing here he's
[1:19:20] describing the way that you're made is
[1:19:22] very different than how you read about
[1:19:24] adam
[1:19:25] it's very different now you're by your
[1:19:27] you have two opposing
[1:19:28] there's two distinct what you find here
[1:19:31] romans
[1:19:32] there's two distinct separate lifes
[1:19:35] are forces two separate
[1:19:38] instincts two separate influences
[1:19:42] that is at work all the time in you all
[1:19:45] the time
[1:19:46] the quicker you understand this and you
[1:19:48] recognize this and you admit this
[1:19:51] the faster you'll get victory
[1:19:54] amen but people who don't see the side
[1:19:56] of themselves have a blind side to it
[1:19:59] that's right
[1:20:01] are you are you following me so there's
[1:20:03] two life forces
[1:20:05] and both of those forces both of those
[1:20:08] instincts both of those
[1:20:09] influences that that good and that evil
[1:20:12] that spiritual that carnal
[1:20:14] are constantly this warring of the that
[1:20:17] paul
[1:20:18] speaks of this war in the flesh that i
[1:20:20] have a part of me that wants to do the
[1:20:22] will of god
[1:20:23] then i have a part of me that doesn't
[1:20:25] and doesn't i find that i don't do it i
[1:20:27] found a law within me
[1:20:28] there's no good thing inside of me that
[1:20:31] is in my flesh
[1:20:32] so there's two distinct forces always
[1:20:35] trying to control you
[1:20:36] trying to control your thoughts trying
[1:20:38] to control your mind trying to control
[1:20:40] your spirit
[1:20:40] trying to control as who brother matt
[1:20:42] the world know i'm speaking to believers
[1:20:44] here tonight
[1:20:46] trying to control us or influence us
[1:20:51] i read this is amazing about the the
[1:20:54] just this little snippet from a book
[1:20:56] that i found and have been going through
[1:20:59] and he begins to
[1:21:00] to talk about this this force that he
[1:21:03] found
[1:21:03] and inside of him as a christian he says
[1:21:06] there are things about myself that scare
[1:21:12] me
[1:21:14] things like a great inner need that
[1:21:17] can't be explained
[1:21:19] like the constant need
[1:21:22] for love and fulfillment he goes on in
[1:21:25] this book begins to say that he had this
[1:21:27] as just a
[1:21:28] even as a young man as a teenage boy and
[1:21:30] he felt that always needs
[1:21:32] and and and always there's always a need
[1:21:34] for love and fulfillment
[1:21:36] remember brother branham said that that
[1:21:37] was natural and he preaches the message
[1:21:39] thirst and he says but he says god god
[1:21:42] gave you a holy thirst to thirst after
[1:21:44] him but satan will give you a
[1:21:46] substitute amen amen
[1:21:49] and he says he'll try to satisfy that
[1:21:51] holy thirst and he'll give you a
[1:21:52] perversion
[1:21:54] he says like a constant need for love
[1:21:57] and fulfillment also
[1:21:58] those subtle desires that surface on
[1:22:01] occasion
[1:22:03] making me lust for experiences that are
[1:22:06] contrary to my christian nature
[1:22:09] i can't explain why i am such a dual
[1:22:12] person when it comes to right and wrong
[1:22:15] the evil that i hate is always present
[1:22:18] in me the good and moral desires are
[1:22:22] there too
[1:22:22] keeping my mind in constant turmoil
[1:22:26] it is and he goes on to say he says just
[1:22:29] when i think i've got my act together
[1:22:32] things fall apart and once again i am
[1:22:34] doing things
[1:22:35] i really don't want to do
[1:22:38] now we're not talking about habitual
[1:22:40] habits here
[1:22:42] but as a as a christian as sons and
[1:22:44] daughters of god how
[1:22:46] we can relate to this can you relate
[1:22:49] a constant turmoil and he says right
[1:22:52] when i think i have my act together then
[1:22:53] i find myself
[1:22:54] things fall apart and i find i'm doing
[1:22:57] things that i really
[1:22:58] don't want to do the real me
[1:23:02] this war between good and evil is raging
[1:23:05] in all mankind
[1:23:07] a minister who was exposed for adultery
[1:23:11] this was a minister who was very very
[1:23:13] well known renowned man
[1:23:15] uh tv vandalist he was exposed for
[1:23:17] adultery
[1:23:18] and this was his confession it's a it's
[1:23:20] a direct quote from this man
[1:23:22] he says my evil nature held a strange
[1:23:25] charm over me it made me chase false
[1:23:28] dreams that i knew would fade away it
[1:23:32] kept me chained
[1:23:33] to a lust that finally destroyed me
[1:23:36] it forced me into compromises that
[1:23:39] weakened me
[1:23:41] its promise of true love ended up
[1:23:45] as only a mirage
[1:23:48] and even though i knew i would keep on
[1:23:51] getting hurt
[1:23:52] i followed the dictates of my evil mind
[1:23:56] like an obedient slave
[1:24:00] this was a preacher who was exposed and
[1:24:03] he begins to confess to
[1:24:04] that he gave himself over to he gave he
[1:24:08] allowed what did brother adam teach on
[1:24:09] when he taught about the white dog and
[1:24:11] the black dog in the natures
[1:24:14] and he says you know chief which one
[1:24:16] wins he said whichever one i feed the
[1:24:17] most
[1:24:19] which one i feed the most that's the one
[1:24:21] that wins
[1:24:22] paul paul says here he says who shall
[1:24:24] deliver me out of the body of this death
[1:24:27] but i thank god through jesus christ so
[1:24:29] what is it
[1:24:30] it's a it's a constant battle it's a
[1:24:32] constant
[1:24:33] war it's a struggle even though even the
[1:24:36] groanings that the bible speaks of
[1:24:38] in romans chapter 8 notice romans 8
[1:24:41] verse 22
[1:24:42] and he says for we know that the whole
[1:24:46] creation groaneth and traveleth
[1:24:50] in pain together until now
[1:24:53] is speaking of the earth because the
[1:24:55] earth is a part of god
[1:24:56] it's a part of it's an eternal attribute
[1:24:58] of god
[1:24:59] and he says what is the earth doing it's
[1:25:02] groaning
[1:25:04] it's travailing you know what that word
[1:25:06] groaning
[1:25:07] is the greek word stinzaio if i'm
[1:25:10] pronouncing that right it means to groan
[1:25:14] when you read this word here for we know
[1:25:16] that the whole creation groaneth and
[1:25:18] traveleth
[1:25:19] in pain together until now in other
[1:25:21] words it's still groaning
[1:25:23] you say brother matt when did it start
[1:25:24] groaning when adam was there in the
[1:25:26] garden
[1:25:27] in perfection no it wasn't groaning then
[1:25:30] it had a man to keep it it had a man to
[1:25:32] tend to it
[1:25:33] the earth wasn't under a curse it didn't
[1:25:35] bring forth thorns and thistles
[1:25:38] but after the fall a curse is put upon
[1:25:40] it and now there's pain another
[1:25:42] suffering now there's a struggle now
[1:25:44] there's torment
[1:25:45] now there's by the sweat of your brow
[1:25:47] now there's thorns and thistles that's
[1:25:49] what the curse was
[1:25:50] upon the earth it will bring forth it
[1:25:52] will yield unto you thorns and thistles
[1:25:53] you've got to labor
[1:25:54] you've got to teal you've got to you've
[1:25:56] got to you've got a toil
[1:25:58] and then paul says all creation all the
[1:26:02] earth is groaning
[1:26:03] and travailing in pain together
[1:26:06] brother brandon preached when he
[1:26:07] preached birth pains and he says what do
[1:26:09] you then he preaches the oncoming storm
[1:26:12] and he's talking about a hurricane that
[1:26:13] comes up from the south of florida
[1:26:15] and that hurricane it was just about to
[1:26:17] level florida and brother brandon begins
[1:26:19] to
[1:26:19] preach about that hurricane he says what
[1:26:21] is it he says it's a sign of judgment
[1:26:24] it's the language that the world the
[1:26:26] only language the world
[1:26:27] understands it's a language of judgment
[1:26:30] because god's trying to get its
[1:26:31] attention
[1:26:32] because the only thing left after you've
[1:26:35] spurned mercy
[1:26:36] is judgment and he says
[1:26:39] he says but what was it it was birth
[1:26:41] pains it's the world
[1:26:43] shaking and groaning and travail
[1:26:46] within itself wondering what
[1:26:49] perfection wanting what no more toil no
[1:26:53] more struggle no more sweat no more
[1:26:55] thorns and thistles
[1:26:56] what are you groaning for here tonight
[1:26:59] no more toil
[1:27:00] no more no i'm not talking about natural
[1:27:02] labor i'm talking about that struggle
[1:27:04] that warfare that the apostle paul
[1:27:05] described
[1:27:07] amen for we know that the whole creation
[1:27:10] grown and thrilleth in pain together
[1:27:12] until now
[1:27:13] verse 23 and not only they but ourselves
[1:27:18] also
[1:27:19] can you identify tonight
[1:27:22] which have the first fruits of the
[1:27:24] spirit even
[1:27:26] we ourselves grown
[1:27:29] within ourselves waiting for the
[1:27:32] adoption
[1:27:32] to wit the redemption of our body
[1:27:38] amen you know why because the redemption
[1:27:40] of this body means no more cancer
[1:27:42] no more covet no more no more no
[1:27:46] more depression no more anxiety no more
[1:27:49] fear
[1:27:49] no more doubt no more worry no more
[1:27:52] struggle
[1:27:52] no more giving into the devil's lies no
[1:27:55] more hatred no more malice
[1:27:57] no more envy no more strife
[1:28:01] when the body's rid you say where does
[1:28:03] all that come from i'm a believer i'm a
[1:28:04] christian i love the lord but yet i
[1:28:06] still struggle and i can get mad i can
[1:28:08] get angry what are you doing you're
[1:28:09] groaning and travelling
[1:28:11] saying i'm ready to be rid of this
[1:28:12] carnal man
[1:28:14] i'm ready for the real me to come
[1:28:16] through i'm ready for my character
[1:28:18] to match the character of this
[1:28:21] and he says for we groan within
[1:28:23] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[1:28:25] wit the redemption
[1:28:27] of our body that word groaning stenzio
[1:28:31] means
[1:28:31] to groan because of pressure being
[1:28:33] exerted forward like the pressure of
[1:28:35] childbirth
[1:28:36] to feel pressure from what is coming on
[1:28:39] to groan decide
[1:28:40] deeply to to to make to be in straits to
[1:28:43] sigh
[1:28:44] and and so he says we murmur we groan
[1:28:47] within ourselves
[1:28:50] because you say why because we have the
[1:28:52] holy ghost
[1:28:54] that's why amen because we have an
[1:28:57] earnest because we have a deposit of
[1:28:59] eternal life
[1:29:00] because we've tasted of eden
[1:29:04] because we've tasted of perfection
[1:29:06] because we've tasted of holiness
[1:29:08] we desire holiness because we've tasted
[1:29:11] of god we want
[1:29:12] more of god because we've tasted of
[1:29:15] where we came from of who we
[1:29:16] really are
[1:29:19] of who we really are
[1:29:23] can you say amen
[1:29:26] i want to i want to just read this here
[1:29:28] brother brandon begins to talk about
[1:29:30] this
[1:29:30] make sure i'm i'm in my right place here
[1:29:33] before i just begin reading
[1:29:35] yes the sumerian church age he says now
[1:29:38] comes our triumphal
[1:29:40] capstone on the baptism of the holy
[1:29:42] ghost galatians 4 4-7
[1:29:45] but when the fullness of time was come
[1:29:47] god sent forth his son
[1:29:48] made of a woman made under the law to
[1:29:51] redeem
[1:29:52] them that were under the law that we
[1:29:55] might receive the adoption of sons
[1:29:58] and because you are sons
[1:30:02] god hath sent forth the spirit of his
[1:30:05] son
[1:30:06] into your hearts crying abba father
[1:30:10] wherefore thou art no more a servant but
[1:30:13] a son
[1:30:14] and if a son than an heir of god through
[1:30:17] christ that's galatians 4 of verse 7
[1:30:20] brother travis
[1:30:21] he says you're you're an heir then an
[1:30:23] heir through wherefore thou art no more
[1:30:25] a servant but a son
[1:30:26] and if a son than an heir of god through
[1:30:28] christ
[1:30:29] notice what brother branham says here he
[1:30:31] says there it is
[1:30:33] jesus christ came forth died upon the
[1:30:36] cross
[1:30:37] and accomplished redemption which means
[1:30:39] to restore
[1:30:40] to the original owner by means of
[1:30:43] purchase
[1:30:44] or paying the price so what was he doing
[1:30:47] at calvary he was purchasing
[1:30:49] he was restoring back to the owner by
[1:30:52] purchasing
[1:30:53] can you say amen and he says
[1:30:57] he says and he says there it is jesus
[1:30:59] christ comes forth
[1:31:01] dies upon the cross and thereby
[1:31:04] by what by that by that perfect work by
[1:31:07] that finished work
[1:31:09] placed us as sons
[1:31:12] now listen close he did not make us sons
[1:31:19] amen he did not make us sons
[1:31:22] for we were already his sons
[1:31:26] but he placed us as his sons
[1:31:30] for as long as we were in the world in
[1:31:33] the flesh
[1:31:34] we could not be recognized as his son
[1:31:37] why
[1:31:38] because you were like an orphan
[1:31:42] an orphan is is is a son
[1:31:45] already by someone
[1:31:50] but he's been orphaned so brother
[1:31:52] branham says you were a son i want you
[1:31:53] to notice
[1:31:54] i wanna i want you just to notice what
[1:31:56] brother branham says here he says we
[1:31:57] were held
[1:31:58] captive by the devil
[1:32:02] but we were sons nonetheless
[1:32:07] we were held captive you say when in sin
[1:32:11] amen
[1:32:12] so what does the baptism of the holy
[1:32:14] ghost do for you does it make you a son
[1:32:16] or daughter of god
[1:32:16] no you always were it only adopts you
[1:32:20] into the family
[1:32:22] and recognizes you as a son but you
[1:32:25] always were a son
[1:32:27] amen he says we were held captive by the
[1:32:30] devil but we were sons nonetheless and
[1:32:31] hear
[1:32:32] this because you are
[1:32:35] sons god hath sent forth the spirit of
[1:32:38] his son into your hearts whereby
[1:32:40] you cry abba father father upon whom he
[1:32:43] asked this question
[1:32:45] upon whom did the spirit fall at
[1:32:48] pentecost
[1:32:49] sons amen amen upon
[1:32:53] sons who at corinth sons
[1:32:57] when they heard the word of god the holy
[1:32:59] ghost baptized them
[1:33:01] and he says sons while they heard the
[1:33:02] word of god what is the baptism with the
[1:33:05] holy ghost
[1:33:06] it is the spirit baptizing you
[1:33:10] into the body of christ it is the new
[1:33:13] birth
[1:33:14] it is the spirit of god coming in and
[1:33:16] filling you
[1:33:17] after you have repented and been
[1:33:19] baptized in water
[1:33:21] as an answer of a good conscience
[1:33:23] towards god
[1:33:25] what we have just set forth would be
[1:33:27] much easier for all to understand
[1:33:29] if all believe the doctrine of the
[1:33:31] oneness of the godhead
[1:33:32] for there are not three persons in that
[1:33:34] godhead but one
[1:33:36] thus we are not born again by the spirit
[1:33:40] of life of jesus coming in
[1:33:42] and then subsequent to that the holy
[1:33:44] spirit coming in to give us power
[1:33:46] he goes on to say this he says thus it
[1:33:48] is
[1:33:49] the the father son and holy ghost
[1:33:52] all coming in at one time for it is one
[1:33:55] person
[1:33:56] comprising that godhead i wish i had
[1:33:58] this on the screen
[1:34:00] that advent took place at pentecost
[1:34:03] what was it sons already sons
[1:34:07] not made sons so the real you notice
[1:34:09] what brother branham says here i'm going
[1:34:11] to close on this
[1:34:11] if you have that powerpoint that i i
[1:34:13] sent just display that
[1:34:15] i want i want to read you this was so
[1:34:17] good i just read this afternoon
[1:34:19] along the lines of what we just read
[1:34:21] brother branham saying in sumerian
[1:34:23] church age here
[1:34:24] brother bannon begins to describe this
[1:34:26] and i think i have good he says the
[1:34:27] first book of life
[1:34:29] coming up was he says the first book of
[1:34:32] life coming up
[1:34:34] was when you were born that was your
[1:34:36] natural birth see
[1:34:37] but then one time way back down and
[1:34:40] there
[1:34:41] there was a little grain of life as i
[1:34:44] was explaining to some of the young
[1:34:45] sisters at the house this afternoon
[1:34:47] see there's a little grain of life
[1:34:50] laying there
[1:34:51] that you wonder where did it come from
[1:34:53] what these strange things i was saying
[1:34:56] this
[1:34:56] talk taking for myself like you was
[1:34:58] going to say william branham
[1:35:00] well 40 years ago the william branham
[1:35:04] and he says it isn't the same one
[1:35:06] tonight 40 years ago william branham
[1:35:09] is not the same one tonight see
[1:35:12] he says if someone back there would say
[1:35:15] william branham was a rank rascal see
[1:35:19] because i was born of charles and elle
[1:35:21] branham in their
[1:35:22] nature i was a sinner i came to the
[1:35:26] world
[1:35:26] a liar and all the habits of the world
[1:35:30] laid right in me amen
[1:35:34] what were you are you any different than
[1:35:35] him no
[1:35:37] was i any different than him no your
[1:35:39] children today if they're not born and
[1:35:41] filled with the holy ghost they're no
[1:35:42] different than he was
[1:35:44] they have the nature of their father and
[1:35:46] mother a sinful
[1:35:47] the curse of sin is passed down
[1:35:49] generation a generation
[1:35:51] and he says all the sins notice he says
[1:35:54] he says in the nature i was a sinner i
[1:35:55] came to the word a liar
[1:35:57] and all the habits of the world laid
[1:35:59] right in me but down
[1:36:00] in there too was another nature present
[1:36:04] see predestinated
[1:36:07] was in there by god in this same body
[1:36:11] two natures in there listen well i only
[1:36:15] catered to one
[1:36:18] as it growed i gued as a baby dada
[1:36:22] first thing you know i became a liar
[1:36:28] you don't want to believe that about
[1:36:29] your children but there's brother
[1:36:30] branham saying hey they're gooning gaga
[1:36:32] and as a baby but
[1:36:33] then they become a liar
[1:36:37] that's just your children that's who
[1:36:38] they are the bible says foolishness is
[1:36:42] locked up inside of them
[1:36:43] bound they're bound with it he says then
[1:36:45] i i became a liar
[1:36:47] and he says first thing you know become
[1:36:49] a liar become everything else that's a
[1:36:52] sinner
[1:36:53] because i was raised up that way but
[1:36:56] down in there he keeps going back to
[1:36:58] this but
[1:36:59] down in there he says it was a little
[1:37:02] speck of life
[1:37:03] all the time i used to remember as a
[1:37:05] little boy hoping not holding too long
[1:37:07] he said sitting out there on the creek
[1:37:08] bank
[1:37:09] and i'd sit there and look around at
[1:37:11] night time pop and mom
[1:37:13] they're going on now to the rest them
[1:37:15] days they were sinners
[1:37:17] there was no christianity in our home at
[1:37:18] all and oh my
[1:37:20] drinking and parties and carrying on it
[1:37:23] made me sick
[1:37:24] i'd take my lantern and my dog and go to
[1:37:26] the woods to stay all night in the
[1:37:28] winter time
[1:37:29] i'd hunt till the party was over maybe
[1:37:31] daylight in the morning
[1:37:33] come home wouldn't be over i've laid on
[1:37:35] the top of a shed and slept
[1:37:36] waiting for daylight to break then i
[1:37:39] think of how
[1:37:40] that time he says then i'd i think of
[1:37:42] how the times
[1:37:43] then being out there in the summertime
[1:37:46] get my sticks and put them down for a
[1:37:48] little wind break

[1:38:09] inches deep in the ground

[1:38:23] he said i was just a sinner
[1:38:25] he says just came from my parents the
[1:38:27] center that was part of my nature
[1:38:29] i was going and gagging as a baby then i
[1:38:30] became a liar and i just be you know all
[1:38:32] the sins of us that a sinner would do
[1:38:34] and he says and you know i remember his
[1:38:36] land as a little boy and
[1:38:37] he said mom and dad would drink and
[1:38:39] party all night and come home and he
[1:38:41] says i remember you know one winter i

[1:40:03] placed
[1:40:04] in there not by his mother not by his
[1:40:06] father
[1:40:07] not by his good house or a bad house or
[1:40:10] good raising
[1:40:11] or bad raising but by god before the
[1:40:14] foundation of the world and it came
[1:40:16] through the fire
[1:40:17] it came through the winter and it
[1:40:19] survived amen
