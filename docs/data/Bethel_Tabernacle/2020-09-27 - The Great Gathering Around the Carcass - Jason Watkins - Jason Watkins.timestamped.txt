[42:01] when you therefore shall see the
[42:02] abomination of desolation
[42:05] spoken of by daniel the prophet stand in
[42:08] the holy place
[42:10] whoso readeth let him understand
[42:13] then let them which be in judea flee
[42:15] into the mountains
[42:17] let him which is on the housetop not
[42:20] come down to take anything out of his
[42:22] house
[42:23] neither let him which is in the field
[42:25] return back to take his clothes
[42:28] and woe unto them that are with child
[42:30] unto them that give suck in those days
[42:33] but pray ye that your flight be not in
[42:35] the winter neither on the sabbath day
[42:38] for then shall be great tribulation such
[42:41] as was not
[42:42] since the beginning of the world to this
[42:45] time
[42:46] no nor ever shall be and except those
[42:50] days
[42:50] should be shortened there should be no
[42:53] flesh there should no flesh be saved
[42:57] but for the elect's sake those days
[43:00] shall be shortened aren't you glad for
[43:02] that then if any man shall say unto you
[43:05] lo here is christ or there believe it
[43:07] not
[43:08] for there shall arise false christ
[43:12] and false prophets and shall show
[43:15] great signs and wonders insomuch that if
[43:18] it were possible
[43:20] they shall deceive the very elect
[43:24] wherefore if they shall say unto you
[43:26] behold
[43:28] behold i have told you before i'm sorry
[43:29] verse 25 behold i have told you before
[43:31] verse 26
[43:33] wherefore if they shall say unto you
[43:35] behold he is in the desert
[43:37] go not forth behold he is in the secret
[43:40] chambers
[43:40] believe it not for as the lightning
[43:43] cometh out of the east
[43:45] and shineth even unto the west so shall
[43:48] also the coming of the son of man be
[43:51] for wheresoever the carcass is
[43:55] there will the eagles be gathered
[43:58] together
[43:59] amen i want to speak to you today on
[44:02] the great gathering around the carcass

[44:17] lord well aware painfully aware of my
[44:20] inability lord to
[44:22] help anyone on an eternal level i can't
[44:26] reach that soul
[44:27] lord i can there's plenty to say lord
[44:30] that could
[44:31] that could entertain people that could
[44:33] be interesting that could be intriguing
[44:35] that would
[44:36] tickle their ears or engage their their
[44:39] spirit lord
[44:41] but father to reach that soul i'm
[44:43] helpless to do that it takes you
[44:46] you're the only one your word is the
[44:48] only thing that can divide us under soul
[44:51] and spirit
[44:52] and reach down to the very mire of the
[44:54] bone so lord
[44:55] we confess our dependency on you today
[44:59] may you come now as you always do come
[45:03] to your word
[45:04] lord grant your anointing both on the
[45:07] speaker
[45:08] and upon the hearer bless all of those
[45:10] here in attendance
[45:12] the visitors here with us today and
[45:14] those who are streaming
[45:15] lord and so i committed all to you now
[45:18] in jesus name
[45:20] amen god bless you friends you can be
[45:22] seated
[45:30] my
[45:41] in the breach brother branham
[45:44] begins to make several very important
[45:48] points
[45:48] that are for the church so that's us
[45:52] are you the church amen and there's
[45:55] there's two
[45:56] very important points that he's going to
[45:58] make just as he's getting
[46:00] started i'm going to rehearse those to
[46:02] you presently
[46:03] one we talked about a service or so ago
[46:06] and the other one i want to really
[46:08] emphasize today
[46:10] now brother branham one of the points
[46:13] that he makes that we've dealt with
[46:15] prior is that
[46:19] that you have to wait on god's timing of
[46:22] things
[46:23] you can't run ahead of him that that has
[46:26] caused more problems in fact
[46:28] is that was the uh part of the main
[46:31] problem that eve did she ran ahead
[46:34] of the plan of god he said you know the
[46:37] church
[46:37] pentecost has always done that that's
[46:39] been the mistake
[46:40] that they've made and you have to wait
[46:43] and it's not always easy to wait
[46:47] you know we're we have been here for
[46:50] more than half a century since the
[46:53] opening of the seals
[46:54] more than half a century since the
[46:56] departing
[46:57] of the prophet who operated under the
[47:00] ministry of elijah william branham
[47:03] and we we have seen the world falling
[47:05] apart
[47:06] we see it today we see it on an epic
[47:08] scale we see it on an unprecedented
[47:11] scale
[47:11] and we look back and you know i can
[47:14] remember
[47:15] you know coming up through the 70s and
[47:17] 80s we saw madness in the world
[47:19] chaos and craziness and we thought
[47:22] surely
[47:22] it's going to have to come soon and then
[47:25] the 80s rolled in and we thought okay
[47:27] well now
[47:27] absolutely it can't go any longer and
[47:30] everybody had their prediction you know
[47:32] and
[47:32] everybody put many put all their eggs in
[47:35] 77
[47:36] which well you know which i'm not
[47:38] preaching on today but certainly hit
[47:40] right on the money just not like we
[47:41] thought it would
[47:43] and so um but it but it did hit exactly
[47:46] how brother branham said it would
[47:48] and i challenge anybody to prove that
[47:50] wrong
[47:51] you can't prove it wrong if you look at
[47:52] everything he said about it
[47:54] it hit on the money but not like we
[47:57] wanted to believe it would be
[48:00] and so we realized that that you know
[48:03] then
[48:03] you know the 90s and the year 2000 and
[48:07] there was no way it could go beyond that
[48:09] until it did
[48:11] amen you know it can't happen until it
[48:14] does
[48:15] and so but you know brother branham you
[48:17] know these were the times where
[48:20] we had to go back and look closely again
[48:23] at things that he said and when we did
[48:26] that you know we come across
[48:27] messages like you know brother branham
[48:29] taking and coming preaching
[48:31] a sermon not just one but you know by a
[48:34] particular title but
[48:35] but many times took this theme that he
[48:38] would talk about how that an unexpected
[48:41] god
[48:41] would come in an unexpected way or
[48:45] he would talk about an unexpected god
[48:47] coming in an unexplainable way
[48:50] and so we realize that god has
[48:53] everything in his sovereign control
[48:56] i'm so glad i'm so glad because
[48:59] one one of the things that we have
[49:01] learned is that we
[49:04] we had more to learn and the more we
[49:06] learn
[49:07] the more we realize we don't know and
[49:10] you know what people say you know what
[49:13] what's what are you doing i'm just
[49:15] i'm just i'm just going along
[49:18] amen i'm just letting god be in control
[49:20] how about we do that
[49:22] how about we just let the sovereign god
[49:24] i'm just happy to be part of the bride
[49:27] and you know my my dad who went on to
[49:30] his reward
[49:31] thought surely he would never raise
[49:32] children to see school days
[49:35] there was it was impossible for me to
[49:37] imagine that i
[49:38] ever would and now his children's
[49:42] children are raising children in school
[49:46] so you know you know i say you know
[49:49] okay tell us now do you when do you
[49:51] think it's going to come
[49:52] in the hour you think not
[49:54] [Laughter]
[49:57] that's for sure in the hour that you
[50:00] think not i remember years ago
[50:02] brother lee vale you know people's false
[50:04] teeth fell out he got up in front of an
[50:06] audience and he said
[50:07] i realize that brother branham talks
[50:09] about you know no man can know
[50:11] you know um you know we're we're talking
[50:13] about the year and people want to
[50:15] predict the year
[50:16] and he said i'm going to tell you you
[50:18] know brother branham said you know
[50:20] the day or the hour he said but i'm
[50:22] going to go beyond that today i'm going
[50:23] to tell you the very moment that he's
[50:25] going to come and everybody's like oh
[50:27] boy
[50:27] and he said he's going to come in the
[50:29] moment you think not
[50:31] in the hour you think not in the minute
[50:33] you think not
[50:34] and so you know i i'm just happy to be
[50:38] in i'm just happy to be in
[50:42] i'm glad i see it i'm glad i believe it
[50:44] because
[50:45] i can tell you as a human being you
[50:47] don't it's impossible
[50:49] to to to believe what anything about god
[50:52] except by god's grace and god's favor
[50:54] and god's election
[50:56] so you know i just realized this that i
[50:59] didn't put me in it
[51:00] i can't get me out he put me in and
[51:03] nobody can take me out
[51:06] but brother branham said you know you
[51:08] can never run ahead of him and you
[51:09] shouldn't try and that's
[51:10] that's a lot of times even the camps
[51:13] that we've had
[51:14] you know in the message of the hour and
[51:15] i you know i've
[51:17] i have lately began to reflect and
[51:20] it's astounding to me when i when i say
[51:22] to myself
[51:23] that i'm 50 am i 57 i think
[51:28] years old and uh you know i i don't i
[51:31] don't feel like that i used to ask my
[51:33] dad
[51:33] said wow dad how does it feel you know
[51:35] to be in your 70s and almost 80s he's
[51:37] when he when he was in his late 70s i'd
[51:39] say how does it feel to be in your 70s
[51:41] he'd say i don't know
[51:43] say why not he said i don't feel like
[51:44] i'm in my 70s
[51:46] i said really he said no he said i still
[51:47] feel like a young man he said now my
[51:49] body tells
[51:50] me otherwise but in my mind i still feel
[51:52] like i'm in my 20s and
[51:54] i think we can all relate to that some
[51:55] of us you young
[51:57] young people y'all don't know nothing
[51:59] about that but
[52:01] you ain't you ain't been through enough
[52:03] yet to know anything from anything
[52:05] but so so just just listen to your holy
[52:08] ghost-filled parents
[52:09] and obey them that have the rule over
[52:11] you as the bible says
[52:13] uh they're here to guide your soul and
[52:15] so make it easy on them will you
[52:17] amen make it easy on the ministry how
[52:19] about it
[52:20] make it easy on parents amen and so you
[52:23] know we're we're we we didn't volunteer
[52:25] for this position we were conscripted
[52:27] and drafted and
[52:28] you know can't get out of it and so um
[52:31] so if i got to do it well
[52:33] then i'm going to do it if i got to do
[52:36] it i'm going to put the pedal to the
[52:37] metal i ain't going to pull any punches
[52:39] because i didn't want to do it already
[52:42] so you know if i got to do it then you
[52:44] know
[52:45] if you've got to be a believer then be
[52:46] one
[52:48] be one be happy to be one be willing to
[52:51] be
[52:52] one see so so we realized that
[52:56] you know uh we're we i i realized that
[53:00] you know my life
[53:02] it's a privilege in one sense that you
[53:04] know i was born into this
[53:06] movement and as a minister today you
[53:09] know my parents were in the meetings
[53:12] and that's that's not that's not a
[53:14] wholesale thing that's kind of rare
[53:16] uh you know to have pastors who can say
[53:19] i was you know i didn't come into this
[53:21] in the 70s or when i was a teenager i
[53:23] was born and raised up in it my parents
[53:25] i sat as a baby in the prophet's
[53:27] meetings and so while i realized that
[53:29] that is
[53:30] a privilege i also am beginning to
[53:33] absorb the weight of responsibility
[53:36] because you know i can i'm like peter
[53:38] i'm sorry like
[53:39] like luke when luke writes he said luke
[53:42] felt a responsibility to say having had
[53:46] perfect understanding from the start
[53:49] you know so he said because of that i
[53:50] write unto the old theophilus so
[53:52] you know i realized today friends my
[53:55] obligation to you because i've
[53:56] i grew up in this thing i've seen it all
[53:59] i i was a young boy
[54:00] you know in the late 60s and coming up
[54:03] in the 70s i was a
[54:04] uh you know growing and becoming a
[54:06] teenager and attended the brandon
[54:07] tabernacle
[54:08] and and so i i i guess i'm i'm not
[54:11] bragging i'm just saying i've been
[54:12] around a while
[54:14] and i've seen the folly of running ahead
[54:18] i've seen men run ahead and i've seen
[54:20] the folly that causes
[54:22] and it's just often more often than not
[54:25] sadly it's pride and
[54:26] a sense of kingdom building and men
[54:28] trying to oh i've seen them come up i'm
[54:30] so glad for brother eddie
[54:32] wow you just don't know what a rock of
[54:34] gibraltar ed watkins was
[54:36] he didn't have that much time for men
[54:39] who tried to make themselves something
[54:40] more than the prophet was
[54:42] he didn't have time for anybody who
[54:44] didn't say what was on those tapes
[54:46] and i tell you what brother eddie kept
[54:48] us right right focused on the word of
[54:50] god and i was raised eating those tapes
[54:52] for a living
[54:52] and today i stand here and i feel the
[54:55] value of that in my life
[54:58] say did you have your times of course i
[55:00] had to be born again i had to come to a
[55:02] new birth as well just like you
[55:04] but but i have the benefit and i and i i
[55:07] just say to myself lord
[55:09] help me to take what i got and bring it
[55:11] to bear as a weapon upon the enemy
[55:14] help me to help your children help me so
[55:16] i can help them
[55:18] and so so when we when we when i
[55:22] you know when i when i bring a certain
[55:24] angle you have to understand this is
[55:26] going back
[55:27] decades of experience decades of
[55:29] watching
[55:30] of watching when i even
[55:33] even by the time i was in my 30s and
[55:36] began pastoring this church
[55:37] 25 years ago my goodness
[55:41] and you know i got i got seven grandkids
[55:44] that didn't even exist in the world
[55:46] they weren't anywhere they didn't exist
[55:49] see still in the loins of my sons
[55:52] and so but even at that time people say
[55:55] well did you know how to how to operate
[55:57] a church goodness no but i sure knew how
[55:59] i didn't want to do one
[56:02] i'd sure seen enough to know not how to
[56:05] do it
[56:06] i sure had seen enough errors and
[56:08] mistakes to and i'd seen enough
[56:09] balance and i'd seen the right way of
[56:11] doing it in the wrong way of doing it
[56:13] and i'm here to tell you something
[56:14] friends one of the we've said it before
[56:16] brother eugene
[56:17] taught it to us years ago one of the
[56:19] first signs of insanity
[56:21] is trying to go the same way and expect
[56:23] to arrive at a different place
[56:26] that's one of the first signs of
[56:27] insanity keep doing something the same
[56:29] way you've always done it and then
[56:30] expect it to come out different it won't
[56:34] when you sow to the wind you're always
[56:35] going to reap a whirlwind when you sow
[56:37] to the word you're always going to reap
[56:39] christ
[56:40] so let the word be your absolute have
[56:43] christ
[56:44] as the center of your life i could never
[56:46] preach a greater
[56:47] message than that
[56:50] and so you know the whole idea of of
[56:53] running ahead brother branham even said
[56:55] even in a vision
[56:57] that you can't he said i can see that
[56:59] the child is going to be healed
[57:00] but in the vision there's a hat laying
[57:02] there and he said i gotta wait for
[57:05] somebody
[57:06] because when she got healed the hat got
[57:08] moved and he said i didn't see who moved
[57:10] it i just saw that it was moved now i'm
[57:12] in the i'm in the room and there's the
[57:14] child
[57:14] hears everything but the hat's in the
[57:16] wrong place he says
[57:17] i gotta wait he said now a couple of
[57:21] things
[57:21] he said i can't move the hat myself
[57:25] neither can i tell somebody else to move
[57:28] it
[57:29] you understand friends that when god
[57:31] sent us this
[57:32] message he used a prophet and
[57:36] put him through the ringer
[57:39] him don't get in the way
[57:44] stay out of the way just be the vessel i
[57:47] can
[57:48] speak through and brother branham
[57:49] suffered a lot of
[57:51] hard crushing to get to that point
[57:55] because he in his early days he tried to
[57:59] run ahead of moving the hat and the
[58:00] child almost died
[58:03] but he had to wait on god's timing and
[58:05] you know if
[58:07] if 50 plus years since a profit has been
[58:10] gone
[58:11] i think if it's trained the bride in
[58:13] anything and all of the camps that have
[58:15] rose up and all the men who rose up
[58:17] kingdoms himself and all the crashing
[58:18] and burning
[58:19] that went on there and all the people's
[58:21] lives were blown up and young people
[58:22] blown up
[58:23] thank god in his mercy he gets all of
[58:26] his children back anyway
[58:28] so i'm glad the devil don't get any
[58:30] victory
[58:32] god just snatches it right out of his
[58:34] hands thank god friends
[58:36] you ought to thank god for that today it
[58:38] doesn't matter what the devil has put
[58:40] you through god won't lose you
[58:42] he finds a way to get you back even
[58:45] sometimes in spite of you he had to
[58:48] capture you
[58:48] handcuff you and drag you back but
[58:51] that's the love of god as brother brad
[58:53] was singing
[58:54] amen and so
[58:58] we find that we've had to learn to wait
[59:02] on god now
[59:05] the next thing that brother branham
[59:07] points out in the breach which is such a
[59:09] monumental sermon
[59:12] because if you he's going to go in and
[59:16] now he's going to bridge
[59:18] between the ages and the opening of the
[59:20] seals
[59:21] and there was a necessary bridge to
[59:23] explain
[59:25] because we're not going to go out of the
[59:28] church age because
[59:29] the bride leaves the seventh church age
[59:31] and goes into a rapture
[59:33] but there has to also be a spiritual
[59:35] understanding
[59:36] that the ages that that christ can't
[59:40] he's put out of the church ages and
[59:42] therefore that if the bride is going to
[59:45] uh continue on she's got to arise
[59:49] that's isaiah 60. arise shine
[59:53] and so we realized that that now there's
[59:55] a
[59:56] there's a there's a spiritual opening of
[59:58] the word of god and it's not
[1:00:00] mysteries explained in symbolism it's
[1:00:02] christ
[1:00:03] coming present among us and so
[1:00:06] we're we we've learned to think not
[1:00:10] differently as much as with greater
[1:00:13] precision and greater clarity
[1:00:17] all right so you you find that
[1:00:21] that brother branham you know he he he
[1:00:23] will go back and i'm going to read a few
[1:00:25] quotes here this this morning but so let
[1:00:28] me just lay some groundwork you're gonna
[1:00:30] if you go back and you look and i know
[1:00:32] there's this whole concept
[1:00:34] of you know the bright age and and is
[1:00:37] the bright age and then an eighth day
[1:00:38] and then
[1:00:39] all these kinds of different things and
[1:00:41] and that's just because you know a lot
[1:00:43] of time there's there are confusions
[1:00:45] about that because sometimes
[1:00:46] people look at them with a dishonest
[1:00:49] motive and i'm sorry to say that
[1:00:51] but it's it works to the advantage
[1:00:54] if a man wants to build a kingdom to
[1:00:57] himself
[1:00:58] it's an advantage to believe that the
[1:01:01] eighth day is a
[1:01:02] is a new day and therefore if it's a new
[1:01:04] day we gotta have a new messenger and
[1:01:06] well
[1:01:06] i'm just all too happy to jump in
[1:01:11] feel me you understand me
[1:01:14] so so so we find that
[1:01:17] the devil has used that and that and
[1:01:20] that when
[1:01:21] when we take and then then you know to
[1:01:23] take the message
[1:01:24] and well you know it's more than what
[1:01:27] paul
[1:01:28] understood and you know what that has
[1:01:30] done
[1:01:31] that's not true and that has that has
[1:01:33] been the very scaffold work
[1:01:35] that men have built the platform that's
[1:01:38] that's the very platform that they've
[1:01:40] used to step
[1:01:41] up on to say you know we've got to go
[1:01:44] beyond what paul because you know the
[1:01:46] next thing and it always happens
[1:01:48] well we've also got to go beyond brother
[1:01:50] branham
[1:01:52] and i've had the ministers look me in
[1:01:54] the eye and say that to me i'm not
[1:01:56] you know speaking of things i don't know
[1:01:58] what i'm talking about i've confronted
[1:02:00] them
[1:02:00] with their doctrines that a prophet
[1:02:02] never taught with their beliefs and ways
[1:02:04] of looking at the scripture and two
[1:02:06] lords and two souls and perusia and all
[1:02:08] these different things
[1:02:09] certainly there's an element of truth to
[1:02:10] all those things that's why it deceives
[1:02:13] because there's an element of truth to
[1:02:14] it but the
[1:02:16] but the but a lot of times the one
[1:02:18] promoting it there's a spirit behind it
[1:02:20] and sometimes it's innocent man i've
[1:02:21] known it to be innocent men
[1:02:23] who ended up later repenting and saying
[1:02:25] i came to my senses
[1:02:26] you know and and so so we're not talking
[1:02:29] about the man we're talking about the
[1:02:30] spirit that
[1:02:31] because the devil is so crafty
[1:02:35] he's been practicing on humans for 6 000
[1:02:38] years
[1:02:39] he knows how you tick you understand he
[1:02:43] knows the levers and wires to pull
[1:02:45] he knows our characteristics and our
[1:02:47] makeup and our
[1:02:48] our you know uh what type of nature that
[1:02:52] we have
[1:02:52] and so we find that you know he
[1:02:56] and i'm just trying to go along by
[1:02:58] inspiration this morning is that okay
[1:03:00] i haven't gone off my first line of my
[1:03:01] notes so it's okay
[1:03:03] don't worry i'm not i'm not a marathon
[1:03:05] preacher don't don't worry
[1:03:07] you know know me by now because i don't
[1:03:09] want you to lose
[1:03:11] some of the very things i want you to
[1:03:12] keep and if i oversponge you i
[1:03:14] i'm always um you know thinking of that
[1:03:18] so so so now we find then that
[1:03:22] you know god is is going to have to have
[1:03:26] a balance and
[1:03:27] and think these things are are so often
[1:03:30] taken out of balance and
[1:03:32] and you know i've i've i've been
[1:03:34] watching these things my whole life
[1:03:36] growing up in churches
[1:03:37] becoming entering into the ministry
[1:03:39] traveling around the world
[1:03:41] preaching you know on on every continent
[1:03:44] except antarctica in this in this world
[1:03:47] and i've met a lot of people i've been
[1:03:48] in a lot of regions
[1:03:50] i'm so glad that i can report to you
[1:03:52] today that the holy ghost always builds
[1:03:54] the same kind of person
[1:03:57] take it from me i've been there i it
[1:03:59] doesn't matter what race
[1:04:01] what color what culture what nation what
[1:04:03] continent what region
[1:04:05] well the raising doesn't matter you know
[1:04:08] god
[1:04:08] always builds the same kind of believer
[1:04:12] and and that and i can go overseas and
[1:04:14] meet people who i've never met in my
[1:04:16] life
[1:04:16] and in five minutes i would be ready to
[1:04:19] entrust my life to their care
[1:04:22] you can't explain that that's god that's
[1:04:24] the holy ghost
[1:04:27] and so so we realized that that there
[1:04:30] had to be
[1:04:31] this breach preached to to get the bride
[1:04:35] introduced because
[1:04:37] i'm going to take some quotes here in a
[1:04:38] minute out of uh out of some messages
[1:04:41] all the way back from the 50s and i i
[1:04:43] started to lay them all out here all the
[1:04:45] way through 1965 there's no need to do
[1:04:47] it i can just
[1:04:48] refer you to them because i'm not really
[1:04:50] preaching on that today
[1:04:51] but you know the the when people there's
[1:04:55] a lot of confusion about a bright age
[1:04:58] to which i just say look and brother
[1:05:01] matt and i were talking about this the
[1:05:02] other day
[1:05:03] that the reason people get confused is
[1:05:05] because they don't take
[1:05:07] the quotes back to the scriptures they
[1:05:09] don't follow brother branham in the
[1:05:10] bible
[1:05:12] they they they're they're you know
[1:05:14] they've got it they've got a motive that
[1:05:15] they want to do something and be
[1:05:17] something
[1:05:17] and if the quotes get in their way
[1:05:20] and and they have and i've confronted
[1:05:23] these men with their
[1:05:24] with their weird teaching and say but a
[1:05:27] prophet said
[1:05:28] well but brother you know sometimes if
[1:05:31] we're not careful
[1:05:33] we make the prophet say things he didn't
[1:05:34] even mean
[1:05:37] i'm like okay i don't think anybody
[1:05:40] knows what that means what
[1:05:42] what do you mean that he didn't mean
[1:05:44] that you mean what do you mean
[1:05:47] and and then you keep pressing them
[1:05:49] until they finally admit and i've had
[1:05:51] them
[1:05:51] say it to my face we are beyond brother
[1:05:55] branham
[1:05:56] we're in the bride age the bride is the
[1:05:59] final voice to the final age
[1:06:01] but they leave off the fact that she's
[1:06:04] the final voice to the final age
[1:06:06] under her messenger under her messenger
[1:06:10] she's the final voice to the final age
[1:06:13] and then they don't even understand why
[1:06:14] they're the final voice to the final age
[1:06:16] that's one thing that makes cracks me up
[1:06:18] is you start talking to people about
[1:06:20] what is that you think that's a cliche
[1:06:22] you know why why do you think you're the
[1:06:24] final voice to the final age
[1:06:26] well because a prophet you know said we
[1:06:28] we would be
[1:06:29] okay well why did he say that he was a
[1:06:31] he was a bible prophet
[1:06:33] so he had to have that somewhere out of
[1:06:35] the bible that principles
[1:06:37] he can't invent that you know what do
[1:06:40] you think this message is the opinion of
[1:06:41] a man
[1:06:43] it's not the opinion of a man a prophet
[1:06:44] is like a microphone that's why god uses
[1:06:47] a prophet
[1:06:48] he's perfectly mute until god speaks
[1:06:51] through him
[1:06:52] and what when you hear you hear him
[1:06:55] preaching but when he's
[1:06:56] when he's when the spirit is on him and
[1:06:57] it's thus saith the lord and he's
[1:06:59] teaching the word
[1:07:00] of god and even if he makes a mistake
[1:07:02] the holy spirit comes back and stops him
[1:07:05] see i i understand that he that you know
[1:07:08] we're not we're not saying that
[1:07:09] you know when brother branham coughs
[1:07:11] that's thus saith the lord well that's
[1:07:13] stupid
[1:07:14] to say that brother branham says you
[1:07:16] know i i and that's attributable to
[1:07:18] verily verily verily that's silly
[1:07:22] brother branham would find that silly
[1:07:24] that anybody would believe that
[1:07:26] he was never intending for people to
[1:07:28] believe that you know but
[1:07:29] but but at the same time he would turn
[1:07:31] around and say i am god's voice to you
[1:07:35] see this is why the message can't just
[1:07:37] be doctrine you've got to have a
[1:07:38] relationship
[1:07:40] with the author of the message of the
[1:07:42] hour
[1:07:44] and we're not afraid of this friends
[1:07:46] you're well taught we have mature
[1:07:47] ministry here i'm not afraid to talk
[1:07:49] about these things
[1:07:50] and so so you've been well taught in the
[1:07:53] bible for years
[1:07:55] and so we we see our position and so
[1:07:59] when you when you come to these kinds of
[1:08:01] things and we realize that
[1:08:03] that he's the we're the final voice
[1:08:07] to the final age because the
[1:08:10] alpha message under paul has been
[1:08:13] restored
[1:08:14] and paul was the final voice to
[1:08:18] all the ages you understand
[1:08:22] paul the bible teaches you that that
[1:08:25] that paul said if even if an angel
[1:08:28] come and teach any other thing even if i
[1:08:31] come back and try to change it
[1:08:33] you understand then let him be a curse
[1:08:36] paul said in the day
[1:08:38] when god will judge the world by jesus
[1:08:40] christ
[1:08:41] he will judge them according to my
[1:08:43] gospel my
[1:08:44] interpretation of who he is paul was the
[1:08:47] final voice to all the ages
[1:08:49] his teaching could not be countermanded
[1:08:52] even
[1:08:52] by god because god gave him the message
[1:08:55] and god is the same yesterday today and
[1:08:58] forever
[1:08:59] and he cannot change his own word or
[1:09:01] have a new idea
[1:09:02] so when the omega comes and we get a
[1:09:04] restored message quite
[1:09:06] naturally we're back to the original and
[1:09:09] we're now the final voice
[1:09:10] to the final age
[1:09:14] amen these things aren't hard to figure
[1:09:17] out if you just connect
[1:09:18] brother branham's teaching back to the
[1:09:21] scripture
[1:09:22] next time you open a message book or
[1:09:23] turn on a tape get your bible
[1:09:25] because brother branham will take you on
[1:09:27] a journey he'll take you on a journey
[1:09:30] through the scriptures
[1:09:33] he was a master at it
[1:09:37] and so we find then that that brother
[1:09:40] brown talks about it this
[1:09:42] this breach and so when he comes to the
[1:09:45] breach
[1:09:45] i mean the beauty the
[1:09:48] beauty of the mind of the holy ghost and
[1:09:51] the breach between the
[1:09:53] ages and the seals you know what he's
[1:09:55] gonna do
[1:09:56] he's gonna go all the way back to the
[1:09:58] old testament
[1:10:00] and he's gonna pick up the story of ruth
[1:10:02] and boaz and naomi
[1:10:05] do you realize that nobody in the bible
[1:10:10] not jesus not the apostles not even
[1:10:13] saint paul ever taught on ruth
[1:10:19] do you know the name ruth only it only
[1:10:22] appears in the genealogies
[1:10:24] you can read and the name boaz you only
[1:10:26] get it if you go into matthew and luke
[1:10:28] and he's
[1:10:29] talking about the genealogies of christ
[1:10:31] you'll find it there
[1:10:33] you'll find one reference back in the
[1:10:34] old testament where when solomon erected
[1:10:37] a
[1:10:38] a a a brass i think it was brass um
[1:10:41] pillar like 24 feet high 13 feet in
[1:10:44] diameter
[1:10:45] and he called one of them i think one
[1:10:47] name and called the other one boaz
[1:10:49] other than that there's no reference to
[1:10:52] it
[1:10:53] you understand jesus doesn't go back and
[1:10:55] use it as an analogy
[1:10:57] paul doesn't use it as an analogy the
[1:10:58] apostles don't use it as an analogy
[1:11:00] that story's never told anywhere in the
[1:11:03] new testament
[1:11:04] or the gospels do you know why
[1:11:09] because it was a harvest time message
[1:11:12] brother branham teaches that in 1954
[1:11:15] it's a harvest time
[1:11:16] ruth came at harvest time hallelujah
[1:11:19] naomi's not not mentioned
[1:11:21] you don't even hear naomi talked about
[1:11:23] anymore why
[1:11:24] because it would only become relevant at
[1:11:26] harvest time
[1:11:28] and so a prophet has got to make a
[1:11:30] junction between the ages and the seals
[1:11:32] and he goes back to get naomi because
[1:11:35] that's who he's going for into moses
[1:11:36] elijah
[1:11:37] and he she brings ruth along who marries
[1:11:39] boaz
[1:11:40] because there would be a bride at the
[1:11:42] last day hallelujah
[1:11:45] who would be unique as that sermon was
[1:11:48] unique
[1:11:51] that's the mind of christ
[1:11:55] and so we find that the next point that
[1:11:58] brother branham makes i got to get off
[1:12:00] my first line
[1:12:04] the next point brother branham would
[1:12:06] make in the breach
[1:12:08] after he really drills it down that you
[1:12:12] can't run ahead of god's program
[1:12:14] because we have to wait he talked about
[1:12:16] world events he said but you got to wait
[1:12:19] don't run ahead and god will get
[1:12:22] everything
[1:12:22] in his time don't try to put him in a
[1:12:25] box and force him
[1:12:27] he says the next thing now is he tells
[1:12:30] of a vision
[1:12:32] when he's in the west and he has his
[1:12:35] hands up praying
[1:12:36] that did we ever get that sock for this
[1:12:38] i can hear my breath hitting that
[1:12:40] so if you think about that brother kev
[1:12:42] so
[1:12:43] so we find that he's praying
[1:12:46] and he's kneeling down and he has his
[1:12:49] hand in the air
[1:12:51] and he says something struck my hand
[1:12:54] and he says i looked and he said and it
[1:12:57] was a sword
[1:13:00] sword he said beautiful pearl handle
[1:13:02] over the guard he said
[1:13:04] and he said it was made of silver
[1:13:06] double-edged
[1:13:08] razor sharp because
[1:13:11] and he said my he said isn't that
[1:13:13] beautiful wow
[1:13:15] it just fits my hand so
[1:13:18] perfectly and he said a voice
[1:13:21] he said i you know i i i said a voice
[1:13:24] said
[1:13:25] that's the king's sword and he said i
[1:13:28] thought well
[1:13:29] if it had a said a king's sword but it
[1:13:32] didn't say
[1:13:33] a king's sword it said the king's sword
[1:13:35] he said the only
[1:13:36] the king's sword is the word and and
[1:13:39] and that's exactly because and and even
[1:13:42] even that the blade was made of silver
[1:13:44] because silver represents redemption in
[1:13:45] the old testament
[1:13:47] oh friends do you understand that this
[1:13:49] word that came in this hour was sent to
[1:13:51] redeem a bride
[1:13:52] out of the ages to bring it right here
[1:13:55] in a breach
[1:13:55] going into the opening of the seals to
[1:13:57] call a bride
[1:13:59] out of the church the only thing that
[1:14:01] could divide
[1:14:02] the bride from the church is the word
[1:14:06] and when it divides it it's redemption
[1:14:09] and if you come with it you're redeemed
[1:14:11] and if you don't you're not
[1:14:13] period it's the only way to get
[1:14:16] redemption
[1:14:18] and so we find here that he talks about
[1:14:21] the handle
[1:14:23] and he says now the handle he says
[1:14:27] it's to protect your hand and he said
[1:14:30] now when you're dueling
[1:14:32] and he said you lock swords and both
[1:14:35] swords are locked at the handles
[1:14:37] and he said then your sword is pushing
[1:14:40] right toward your enemy's heart
[1:14:42] and his sword is pushing right toward
[1:14:44] your heart
[1:14:45] and he says he says it takes even though
[1:14:48] the sword be the word
[1:14:51] it takes the hand of strong faith to
[1:14:54] hold it there
[1:14:55] to bring it to the heart of the enemy
[1:14:59] and so therefore we you know everything
[1:15:02] brother branham went through
[1:15:04] on a personal level every
[1:15:07] all the crushing it was all so that he
[1:15:10] could have a stronger hand
[1:15:12] than lucifer oh friends i'm here to tell
[1:15:16] you i don't i'm not glad
[1:15:18] that brother branham suffered so bad i
[1:15:20] hear life story
[1:15:21] i hear him break down to this day i
[1:15:24] guess i've heard that sermon
[1:15:26] 50 or 100 times over my lifetime i
[1:15:28] always am a blubbering mess at the end
[1:15:31] he's crying i'm crying i can play in the
[1:15:33] church and everybody be crying
[1:15:35] where none of us are happy for what a
[1:15:37] prophet had to endure
[1:15:39] but i'm glad it made his hand of faith
[1:15:41] strong
[1:15:42] to hold the word because he had to bring
[1:15:45] it to the heart of the enemy or
[1:15:47] the enemy would bring it to the heart of
[1:15:48] the prophet and that couldn't happen
[1:15:50] because he had to be the vassal on the
[1:15:53] earth to find a bride
[1:15:56] so you can rest assure that this message
[1:15:59] didn't come by
[1:16:00] accident it didn't fall out of a tree
[1:16:02] and hit somebody in the head it wasn't
[1:16:04] no he didn't have a he didn't have a bad
[1:16:06] dream like like
[1:16:07] like like uh his um dr um uh roy
[1:16:11] roy uh i forget the baptist preacher
[1:16:14] who ordained him um but he's but it
[1:16:16] wasn't about that he said billy you had
[1:16:18] a bad dream no he said i didn't he said
[1:16:20] i spoke
[1:16:21] he said i spoke to a being he talked to
[1:16:24] me
[1:16:25] he said billy you're crazy he said i'm
[1:16:26] not he said it wasn't a dream
[1:16:29] he talked to me i spoke to him he came
[1:16:31] and he came where i was praying
[1:16:34] and so so we find then that we have
[1:16:37] you know we have been placed on notice
[1:16:40] you know in the breach that something
[1:16:43] more
[1:16:44] is coming for the bride of jesus christ
[1:16:47] and you should be glad
[1:16:49] because you need it
[1:16:52] a place and an ability by the word
[1:16:56] that will manifest for you and i a
[1:16:59] season of perfect faith
[1:17:02] and we've looked for it a faith that
[1:17:04] will that will
[1:17:07] it'll culminate in the change of your
[1:17:09] mortal body
[1:17:11] it'll literally change you and
[1:17:14] the the thing that we have to realize is
[1:17:16] is that a prophet
[1:17:18] when he comes with this kind of an
[1:17:20] understanding he's he makes a statement
[1:17:22] to say
[1:17:23] i'm not coming i'm not here to tell you
[1:17:25] he's coming
[1:17:27] he said i'm here to tell you he's here
[1:17:30] this one i that i was speaking of in the
[1:17:33] breach
[1:17:34] is now among us it's the kingdom coming
[1:17:37] in
[1:17:38] and you're and he keeps going on he
[1:17:40] keeps preaching
[1:17:41] until he gets to a certain sermon and
[1:17:42] says i don't even call you church
[1:17:44] anymore i call you bride
[1:17:47] you understand so this is a a a
[1:17:50] a very clear line of demarcation this
[1:17:53] this is a moment
[1:17:54] where something transitions now
[1:17:58] we still believe as brother branham did
[1:18:01] to his dying day
[1:18:03] that that does not circumnavigate the
[1:18:06] corporal appearing
[1:18:07] of christ he said i believe in the
[1:18:09] physical
[1:18:10] return of the lord jesus all right so
[1:18:14] but but if you're going to see the
[1:18:16] physical return of the lord jesus
[1:18:18] you're going to have to have a body
[1:18:20] likened unto his glorified body
[1:18:22] and the only way you're going to get
[1:18:23] that is perfect faith and the only way
[1:18:25] you get
[1:18:26] that is i by a faith in the revealed
[1:18:28] word to give you that perfect faith
[1:18:33] so we find that we see that things are
[1:18:36] going on in the world and we wonder
[1:18:39] why it hasn't happened yet we wonder has
[1:18:42] it happened yet
[1:18:43] we wonder are we in it is there more yet
[1:18:46] to come
[1:18:46] all of these questions that we've asked
[1:18:48] ourselves for more than half a century
[1:18:51] and they've they've had every kind of
[1:18:53] thinking you know well when he stepped
[1:18:54] forward
[1:18:55] you know in in revelation 4 and
[1:18:58] revelation 5 and i don't
[1:19:00] i don't understand myself why
[1:19:03] why people have why they somehow
[1:19:07] disconnect chapter four from chapter
[1:19:09] five it's all one event
[1:19:11] only men only man hundreds of years
[1:19:14] later added chapters and verses
[1:19:16] if you look at the events beginning with
[1:19:18] chapter four verse one
[1:19:20] and a door is opened in heaven and of
[1:19:21] course that's christ and john is called
[1:19:23] up into
[1:19:24] a christ because he's not in the ages
[1:19:26] perfectly
[1:19:27] that's why he's alpha and omega you
[1:19:29] remember i taught you on that that
[1:19:31] brother branham makes the point about
[1:19:32] about teaching you that
[1:19:34] that that the he's alpha and omega he
[1:19:37] doesn't he said not everything in
[1:19:38] between
[1:19:39] see now you you say well christ is in
[1:19:42] the middle of the seven lampstand sure
[1:19:44] christ is in the in between but after
[1:19:47] the church
[1:19:48] falls and before she gets restored
[1:19:51] he is in the in between but not
[1:19:53] everything in the in between is him
[1:19:56] because men have started adding in their
[1:19:58] own thinking and their own ideas and
[1:20:00] and distorting it and messing it all up
[1:20:02] and you don't even you can't even go
[1:20:03] past irenaeus and have the correct
[1:20:05] interpretation
[1:20:06] brother brown said he was the last one
[1:20:07] to understand the godhead perfectly
[1:20:11] see and so as i was i was i i think i've
[1:20:14] taught on this i don't know i get
[1:20:16] sometimes it if i if you hear me
[1:20:18] repeating stuff it's because i preach
[1:20:19] every day
[1:20:20] uh on on a phone hookup and i'm teaching
[1:20:22] the book of revelation to brothers in
[1:20:24] california
[1:20:24] a whole group of us and different ones
[1:20:26] and so i know sometimes i don't remember
[1:20:28] did i say that on the broadcast or did i
[1:20:29] say that in church
[1:20:30] so just bear with me will you do it
[1:20:34] so so we find then that that he's
[1:20:37] he's that the omega is the restoration
[1:20:40] of the alpha
[1:20:41] and so the the ages can't receive them
[1:20:44] seals brother branham said they couldn't
[1:20:46] laodicea pentecost couldn't receive them
[1:20:48] they put christ out serve him with an
[1:20:50] brother prophet serves him with an
[1:20:52] indictment
[1:20:53] you're guilty of the second crucifixion
[1:20:54] of christ
[1:20:56] and therefore john is you know caught up
[1:20:58] into christ and
[1:20:59] and i i understand that when the bride
[1:21:02] goes out of chapter three she goes in
[1:21:04] the rapture
[1:21:05] of course she does physically but that
[1:21:07] doesn't stop the compound spiritual
[1:21:09] application
[1:21:10] because we certainly believe in the
[1:21:12] spiritual application of chapter five
[1:21:15] i sure hope so because there's there's a
[1:21:18] strong angel represented our prophet
[1:21:20] john who represented the bride and the
[1:21:22] strong angel is saying
[1:21:24] who's worthy to take the book that is
[1:21:26] paramount to us who's worthy let him
[1:21:28] come and a prophet says
[1:21:30] let him now come or forever hold his
[1:21:32] peace
[1:21:33] and so why why people don't want to take
[1:21:36] the spiritual side of chapter four
[1:21:38] when chapter four simply setting up
[1:21:40] chapter five
[1:21:42] it's just simply it's it's the whole
[1:21:44] thing is starting he's showing
[1:21:45] he's and that's why brother branham says
[1:21:47] in when he's teaching on revelation 5
[1:21:50] he says here he begins to show
[1:21:53] he said chapter 3 ends the church and
[1:21:56] she goes in the rapture and she's not
[1:21:58] seen again until revelation 19 when she
[1:22:00] comes out of
[1:22:01] heaven with christ riding on white
[1:22:03] horses as the army
[1:22:04] that's true physically that's true
[1:22:06] naturally
[1:22:07] but then he comes back and he says now
[1:22:09] in chapter five he's going to start
[1:22:11] showing how he did it how he pulled it
[1:22:14] off how did he get a bride
[1:22:16] through all of that time of man's ideas
[1:22:19] and man's uh distortions of the word why
[1:22:22] because there was a lamb interceding for
[1:22:25] their ignorance
[1:22:28] see they were already buried uh
[1:22:32] by by the time of the second age they
[1:22:34] were already dead
[1:22:35] and finally they're crowned with a with
[1:22:38] a triple crown
[1:22:39] and then there it's the church has
[1:22:41] already went into the ground at that
[1:22:42] point
[1:22:43] and then she's going to come back out in
[1:22:45] a restoration under luther
[1:22:46] but luther didn't know that he was an
[1:22:50] unbeliever in sanctification
[1:22:52] luther didn't know that so god couldn't
[1:22:55] condemn him for that
[1:22:57] the blood is interceding on behalf of
[1:22:59] his ignorance because you can't
[1:23:00] disbelieve what you don't know
[1:23:02] and when when wesley comes on the scene
[1:23:05] he's got a further revelation than
[1:23:07] luther and everybody who stuck with
[1:23:09] luther now had to move into wesley
[1:23:11] but john wesley didn't know he was an
[1:23:13] unbeliever in the restoration of the
[1:23:15] gifts
[1:23:16] when they when their people would pass
[1:23:18] out in their meetings they'd throw water
[1:23:20] in their face thinking the devil was on
[1:23:21] them
[1:23:23] and they didn't know that that was the
[1:23:25] approaching of the restoration of the
[1:23:27] outpouring of the gifts
[1:23:28] the pentecostal the azusa fathers they
[1:23:31] they didn't realize
[1:23:32] that they were unbelievers in the
[1:23:34] perfect word they denominated
[1:23:36] around the gifts they didn't realize
[1:23:40] you know and but yet god still had
[1:23:42] people in there and still kept saving
[1:23:44] them that's why
[1:23:44] even brother willard collins even his
[1:23:46] dad under that old
[1:23:48] under that old movement couldn't see the
[1:23:50] message and brother of them said don't
[1:23:51] worry brother willard he's a lap over
[1:23:53] he's lived he's actually from another
[1:23:54] age
[1:23:55] he's he's graded on a curve oh
[1:23:57] hallelujah
[1:23:58] hallelujah but today friends we've been
[1:24:01] caught up
[1:24:02] we've been called out and called up
[1:24:04] hallelujah and it's time to come to the
[1:24:06] full
[1:24:07] understanding of the mind of christ
[1:24:09] we're going to need this perfect faith
[1:24:14] so has it happened yet are we in it is
[1:24:16] there more yet to come yes
[1:24:18] yes and yes
[1:24:22] see the enemy knowing this confusion
[1:24:24] would be here and he's always trying to
[1:24:26] run ahead and muddy the waters
[1:24:28] and he certainly i hate to say it but he
[1:24:31] certainly found
[1:24:32] plenty of willing vessels who think a
[1:24:34] little more highly of themself
[1:24:36] than they should i'm not here to
[1:24:39] question the motives
[1:24:40] i'm not here to judge them at all to
[1:24:41] their own master paul says in the 14th
[1:24:44] chapter of romans
[1:24:45] to their own master they rise or fall
[1:24:49] you know um and i can't think of myself
[1:24:52] also i can't follow the same folly of
[1:24:55] thinking of myself more highly
[1:24:56] than i ought i constantly have to come
[1:24:59] back and
[1:25:00] i you know your your your life as a
[1:25:02] believer
[1:25:04] is constantly repenting
[1:25:07] brother branham said that's the spirit
[1:25:09] on the bride of the last is to repent
[1:25:11] the spirit on the bride is to say i'm
[1:25:14] wrong
[1:25:15] in other words i can't get me there lord
[1:25:17] you're going to have to get me there
[1:25:18] you're going to be able to sing jesus
[1:25:21] led me all the way
[1:25:23] hallelujah we don't get cocky we don't
[1:25:26] we don't
[1:25:26] become prideful we walk in humility
[1:25:30] we're constantly owning our re our
[1:25:33] reliance
[1:25:34] upon the holy ghost hallelujah
[1:25:40] and so everything everything that we
[1:25:44] talk about including the third pull the
[1:25:47] the refilling of the holy ghost the
[1:25:48] fresh surge just coining phrases the
[1:25:50] prophet used
[1:25:52] the body change all of these things can
[1:25:55] only come and unfold
[1:25:57] in their order and you can't make them
[1:26:00] happen
[1:26:01] we're not even to try to make them
[1:26:03] happen we're supposed to walk humbly so
[1:26:05] that we
[1:26:06] allow them to happen you understand the
[1:26:09] revelation of this message is an event
[1:26:11] it's not gaining knowledge
[1:26:12] it's a happening something happened to
[1:26:15] them in the upper room
[1:26:18] see so we found out you know that
[1:26:22] um we've got a bride he starts to
[1:26:25] separate if you follow that and i was
[1:26:27] just going over this quickly
[1:26:29] just with brother matt the other day we
[1:26:30] were and i was saying look
[1:26:32] if people just go back and they they
[1:26:35] they cabbage down on the bright age the
[1:26:36] bright age of bright days and i
[1:26:37] certainly believe we're in a bright age
[1:26:39] in balance like a prophet taught it
[1:26:43] see uh but he also called it a bright
[1:26:46] time
[1:26:47] you find in the bright age isn't a term
[1:26:50] he even uses until 1965
[1:26:52] and he uses it six times across five
[1:26:54] sermons in 1965
[1:26:57] but if you but he also if you go back
[1:27:00] and include 64 and 65
[1:27:02] he'll call it and he'll interchange it a
[1:27:04] bright time
[1:27:05] see in other words it's a time where
[1:27:09] the bride has been called out of the
[1:27:11] church she's
[1:27:12] she's under the restoration of the full
[1:27:15] word
[1:27:16] christ is among her she's she's
[1:27:18] receiving perfect faith she's walking by
[1:27:21] faith
[1:27:21] daily she's under full redemption she's
[1:27:24] not under the law anymore it's not about
[1:27:26] her works
[1:27:27] she's not under false teaching even even
[1:27:30] if she commits a transgression it don't
[1:27:32] even count against her because she's
[1:27:33] immune
[1:27:34] she has complete diplomatic immunity she
[1:27:36] can't even being prosecuted indicted or
[1:27:38] even charged
[1:27:40] you understand she's in christ
[1:27:43] hallelujah and so we find then that
[1:27:47] that that if you that if you keep going
[1:27:50] back
[1:27:50] you find brother branham just going
[1:27:53] backwards i said if you go backwards
[1:27:54] from bride time
[1:27:56] he calls it seed time and then he'll
[1:27:58] interchange it seed time pride time
[1:28:00] pride age
[1:28:01] because he's recognizing that it's come
[1:28:04] back to the full grain
[1:28:06] now he didn't recognize that at first
[1:28:09] and and and
[1:28:10] and the quotes i have i won't even
[1:28:11] bother trying to read them it's all in
[1:28:12] my mind and my heart anyway
[1:28:14] but but i have them maybe we'll get two
[1:28:16] of them when we can slow down next time
[1:28:17] we cover this
[1:28:18] because we're not going to finish today
[1:28:19] for sure but if you go all the way back
[1:28:22] to 1954
[1:28:23] then you find brother branham you know
[1:28:25] what he calls it harvest time
[1:28:28] and he keeps using that all the way
[1:28:30] through 1965 and by the time you get
[1:28:32] into the late 60s after the seals
[1:28:34] he's saying bride time harvest time seed
[1:28:37] time bride age
[1:28:39] he's trying to identify you understand
[1:28:42] you've been called out of something
[1:28:44] hallelujah you've been caught up into an
[1:28:46] order of ascending
[1:28:47] you're already revelation 5 has already
[1:28:50] happened listen friends
[1:28:51] revelation 5 has already happened
[1:28:54] the book was taken who is worthy did
[1:28:57] someone show up yes
[1:28:59] did he take the book yes did he lose the
[1:29:01] seals yes
[1:29:02] when he does that mercy's over christ
[1:29:05] has left the throne
[1:29:07] but is mercy over no
[1:29:10] there it is is there is there still
[1:29:13] blood is there still an atonement is
[1:29:14] there still a mediator
[1:29:15] no of course yes no
[1:29:19] yes no there's not
[1:29:23] there is of course there is you know why
[1:29:26] because there's a separation in the ages
[1:29:29] is there any more atonement under that
[1:29:31] teaching no
[1:29:32] he's done he's not depositing mercy that
[1:29:34] blood doesn't count for that anymore why
[1:29:36] because that blood now has stepped
[1:29:39] forward and now it's a bleeding word
[1:29:41] and so you've got to take a hold of the
[1:29:43] bleeding word and there
[1:29:44] there is redemption no more man-made
[1:29:48] theory
[1:29:48] mercy's over for that he won't wink at
[1:29:50] their ignorance any longer
[1:29:52] hallelujah he requires all men to come
[1:29:54] and repent
[1:29:57] see so we don't get confused on these
[1:30:00] things
[1:30:02] so we realize that that that mercy is
[1:30:05] now
[1:30:07] in the ministry of the son of man
[1:30:11] aaron couldn't go into his presence
[1:30:14] without blood
[1:30:15] unless he was with moses
[1:30:18] he goes into the presence of god without
[1:30:20] the blood of the lamb he dies
[1:30:23] but then god tells moses go down and get
[1:30:25] aaron and bring him back up here
[1:30:27] he didn't bring an offering he didn't
[1:30:28] bring a lamb he didn't bring blood
[1:30:31] didn't have to he didn't have to adam
[1:30:34] didn't have to carry blood
[1:30:36] you understand adam didn't need blood
[1:30:39] before the fall
[1:30:40] the the first blood sacrifice came after
[1:30:42] the fall to to redeem his family through
[1:30:45] and you get me and so when moses
[1:30:49] brings aaron back up into the shekinah
[1:30:50] they walk in and out of the cloudy
[1:30:52] pillar
[1:30:52] aaron doesn't die you know why he's with
[1:30:54] moses
[1:30:56] and moses is a is a prophet
[1:30:59] and a prophet is a minister of the son
[1:31:01] of man it's an office of the son of man
[1:31:03] and the office and the ministry of the
[1:31:05] son of man
[1:31:06] is a ministry of atonement amen
[1:31:09] you understand so what have you what is
[1:31:11] it that you are feeding on when you're
[1:31:13] feeding on the body word of the son of
[1:31:15] man
[1:31:15] you're you're eating atonement you're
[1:31:17] eating mercy you're eating the sacrifice
[1:31:20] christ is the sacrifice she is him you
[1:31:23] are the blood of god by the spirit
[1:31:28] hallelujah now how much responsibility
[1:31:30] do you feel
[1:31:31] to tell everybody that you can don't
[1:31:33] keep this thing a secret
[1:31:35] they can't find redemption outside of
[1:31:37] this word and this word is now in the
[1:31:39] bride hallelujah
[1:31:42] oh my i hope i'm not blowing your fuses
[1:31:44] today
[1:31:50] so we find that you know he's
[1:31:54] he's we found out he's coming after the
[1:31:56] jews
[1:31:57] everything that we have is what
[1:32:01] israel rejected everything that we
[1:32:05] that we got the jubilee the the
[1:32:08] abstract title the the heart of flesh
[1:32:13] that was all to israel that's why it's
[1:32:16] going to return to israel under moses
[1:32:18] and elijah
[1:32:20] you understand but israel as a nation
[1:32:22] rejected it so it went to the gentiles
[1:32:25] that's why god knew that would happen
[1:32:27] that's why he gave joseph
[1:32:29] aznath joseph didn't go get her pharaoh
[1:32:32] gave
[1:32:32] her to him and because god knew that
[1:32:36] they would reject him and they did
[1:32:38] and the gospel went to the went to the
[1:32:40] went to the church went to the gentile
[1:32:42] church and we've
[1:32:42] operated for 2 000 years it's got to go
[1:32:45] back to israel
[1:32:47] and he's coming to destroy the earth
[1:32:49] that has rejected him that a prophet
[1:32:51] indicted but
[1:32:52] oh hallelujah you have to understand
[1:32:55] that
[1:32:56] that though he said i will destroy the
[1:32:58] earth with the curse
[1:33:00] he said but i'll send elijah i'll slip
[1:33:03] him in before that coming of that great
[1:33:05] and dreadful day of the lord
[1:33:06] what is that ministry of elijah going to
[1:33:08] do it's an injunction
[1:33:10] god is putting an injunction upon his
[1:33:13] own self he's the only one who can
[1:33:15] that he won't destroy it until elijah
[1:33:18] gets in grabs a bride
[1:33:19] a shout goes and we gather around the
[1:33:22] carcass of the word
[1:33:24] and that's our scripture today and the
[1:33:26] bride gathers around the carcass of the
[1:33:29] word
[1:33:29] what is it doing you're eating the body
[1:33:31] word of the son of man
[1:33:33] what is it doing you are the blood of
[1:33:35] god by the spirit
[1:33:36] it's bringing perfect faith that's how
[1:33:38] you're staying separated from the world
[1:33:39] that's how you're going in a rapture
[1:33:41] hallelujah that's why the devil can't
[1:33:44] touch you
[1:33:44] that's why you're predestinated not to
[1:33:47] fall
[1:33:48] you're the only church in all the ages
[1:33:51] that is predestinated by god
[1:33:53] not to fall he'll come and take you
[1:33:57] before that could ever happen
[1:33:59] even though the deception would be so
[1:34:01] close it would deceive the very elect
[1:34:04] if that was possible
[1:34:08] so every promise to israel i gotta i
[1:34:10] gotta find a stopping point
[1:34:14] was inherited by the gentile bride
[1:34:17] and so you know the the the alpha church
[1:34:22] there's so much that she failed to
[1:34:25] accomplish so when people say
[1:34:26] well we we're we're going to be more
[1:34:29] than that church
[1:34:30] okay in a sense
[1:34:33] in a sense i can go along with that but
[1:34:35] don't tell me
[1:34:36] that it's because some eighth messenger
[1:34:40] brought us a new revelation that's
[1:34:42] greater than william branham who
[1:34:44] are greater than paul oh we got to go
[1:34:46] beyond that brother jason not
[1:34:48] find me the scripture that tells me
[1:34:49] we'll do that every scripture i find
[1:34:52] tells me it's a restoration back to the
[1:34:54] original
[1:34:55] now if you want to talk about
[1:34:57] manifestation now we can talk about it
[1:35:00] because because the the abstract
[1:35:03] that the holy ghost was to give them uh
[1:35:06] uh
[1:35:06] new bodies which they never came to why
[1:35:09] because they fell away
[1:35:12] you understand so they got so far going
[1:35:14] toward a rapture
[1:35:16] uh and and and that's why and i don't
[1:35:18] even have time to really get down into
[1:35:19] the scriptures of that maybe next time
[1:35:21] but paul picks that very thought up and
[1:35:24] he's actually talking about
[1:35:26] about people who are already under the
[1:35:29] grace of god
[1:35:30] already baptized with the holy ghost
[1:35:32] until paul starts talking about
[1:35:34] about a grace that's going to come at
[1:35:36] the appearing of jesus christ
[1:35:38] well wait a minute we've already why do
[1:35:39] we need more grace because it wasn't
[1:35:41] talking about his days talking about our
[1:35:43] day
[1:35:44] so there's a grace that comes with the
[1:35:46] revelation of jesus christ
[1:35:48] that grace seals you in
[1:35:52] that grace makes up for all of your
[1:35:54] mistakes that grace covers you
[1:35:56] i'm here to tell you god's got your back
[1:35:58] it doesn't matter what the devil does
[1:36:00] his grace covers you he won't lose you
[1:36:04] that's what the bleeding word has
[1:36:06] accomplished in our lives
[1:36:07] because we believe it that gives me
[1:36:11] authority over the devil
[1:36:13] i don't don't lose that friends you
[1:36:16] don't have to be under the bondage
[1:36:18] of satan in this laodicean age and
[1:36:21] whether it's a physical
[1:36:22] bondage a mental bondage an emotional
[1:36:26] bondage
[1:36:26] it doesn't matter what kind of bondage
[1:36:28] the jubilee has
[1:36:30] sounded and you can be free you don't
[1:36:33] even have to wait
[1:36:34] for the service to be over you can reach
[1:36:37] out and take a hold of it right now
[1:36:43] why why would you sit in misery
[1:36:47] and not make a claim
[1:36:50] oh friends make a claim today
[1:36:54] wow i gotta skip so much
[1:37:02] so brother branham comes now
[1:37:09] with man you know here we are in this in
[1:37:12] this day
[1:37:17] we find the world
[1:37:20] it's in a catastrophe
[1:37:24] i mean it's it's what's happening now
[1:37:29] was unimaginable only a decade ago
[1:37:33] you know brother branham talks about how
[1:37:35] that
[1:37:36] uh let me let me i i know what i'm gonna
[1:37:38] do now let me let me just skip down
[1:37:41] uh i finally figured it out thank you
[1:37:43] lord all right i'm gonna skip a lot
[1:37:45] we'll come back and catch it
[1:37:47] so brother branham comes now in
[1:37:50] the church age book
[1:37:53] and make sure that's where i'm supposed
[1:37:55] to be correct
[1:37:57] correct correct okay
[1:38:00] you got 10 more minutes
[1:38:04] all right
[1:38:08] so we find that
[1:38:12] that let let me come to this
[1:38:17] so i was saying a while ago you know how
[1:38:19] you can track it
[1:38:20] back through his ministry and when you
[1:38:22] go back into the 50s
[1:38:24] you you get brother branham calling it a
[1:38:26] harvest time
[1:38:27] and he comes to the story of ruth and he
[1:38:29] says see ruth came at harvest time
[1:38:32] and and so we there's 1954 and then he
[1:38:36] he goes from harvest time and he through
[1:38:39] 55
[1:38:40] through 56 because he knows america
[1:38:43] is coming to her her line in the sand
[1:38:47] that if she crosses this line she's
[1:38:49] going to join the rest of the world in
[1:38:50] judgment the rest of the world's already
[1:38:51] under judgment
[1:38:52] no way no way to get it back america is
[1:38:55] the furthest west
[1:38:56] once you go to the west coast of america
[1:38:58] you're going to start heading back
[1:38:59] toward east again
[1:39:00] and so we realized that hollywood sits
[1:39:02] right on the west coast and
[1:39:04] that's why brother said it's so evil
[1:39:05] because there's like a barrier
[1:39:07] and and sin is heaped up like if you saw
[1:39:10] if you're at a river and they had a
[1:39:11] great wall
[1:39:12] and the water washes all the trash right
[1:39:14] up to the wall
[1:39:15] so we find then that he
[1:39:18] he comes through 54 55 and he's talking
[1:39:22] about the general
[1:39:24] harvest time he says you know he says
[1:39:27] the the church that went down comes back
[1:39:29] up at the end and
[1:39:30] and he says we find that he said if you
[1:39:33] look at
[1:39:34] at the story of ruth and he said she
[1:39:36] came at harvest time and then he goes to
[1:39:38] the political side and he says
[1:39:40] did you notice the jews coming back to
[1:39:42] palestine
[1:39:43] and so he's looking at all these world
[1:39:44] events and he says for the first time
[1:39:46] the six point star of david and brother
[1:39:48] branham has got this global world view
[1:39:51] that
[1:39:51] we have arrived at harvest time he's
[1:39:55] speaking to the
[1:39:56] he's interdenominational himself
[1:40:00] and he they wanted him to take sides he
[1:40:02] wouldn't take sides people want to do
[1:40:04] that today
[1:40:04] all you got to choose you got to take a
[1:40:06] side i mean it even goes on in the
[1:40:07] message today
[1:40:09] and we've got we've got to say well you
[1:40:11] know they're doing this over here and
[1:40:12] you know in in in jeffersonville and
[1:40:14] they're doing this over here in south
[1:40:16] africa and they're doing this up here in
[1:40:17] this city in this state and
[1:40:19] and you know i'm going to tell you you
[1:40:20] got to you got to choose a side you
[1:40:21] gotta pick a side
[1:40:24] well i don't have to pick a side i pick
[1:40:26] jesus
[1:40:28] this isn't dante's inferno you're not
[1:40:29] virgil i don't have to choose a side
[1:40:32] i i can i can choose christ there's
[1:40:35] nothing wrong
[1:40:36] with choosing christ hallelujah
[1:40:40] and so we find that he comes now but
[1:40:43] then
[1:40:44] he goes to 1956 and then in 1957 and now
[1:40:47] america sealed away her doom
[1:40:48] 58 59 and then he starts he's still
[1:40:51] calling it a global harvest
[1:40:53] he's still calling it a global harvest
[1:40:55] time and then in 1961
[1:40:58] suddenly you can tell he's it's not
[1:41:01] crystallized in his mind just yet he
[1:41:04] he starts using language like seed time
[1:41:07] it goes from harvest time to seed time
[1:41:09] and he's starting to realize
[1:41:11] wait a minute there's something that
[1:41:13] should be happening here at the end time
[1:41:15] that should be different than the rest
[1:41:18] of
[1:41:19] christianity he's not sure what it is he
[1:41:21] keeps studying it he keeps talking about
[1:41:23] it by the time 1962 rolls around
[1:41:25] he comes to the pulpit and he says now
[1:41:27] today he says i'm going to explain
[1:41:30] you're going to understand today
[1:41:32] why i've said the things i've said and
[1:41:34] why i've done the things i've done
[1:41:36] and he takes a six-hour series called
[1:41:38] the spoken word
[1:41:39] is the original seed and now he's
[1:41:43] starting to understand
[1:41:45] hold on this whole global harvest time
[1:41:48] we need to we need to focus focus
[1:41:52] get your focus start looking a little
[1:41:53] closer that we got it we got a
[1:41:55] there's a separating line in there that
[1:41:57] he's starting to see he said now let
[1:41:58] look he said you know they they've had
[1:42:01] their
[1:42:02] former rain they've had their teaching
[1:42:05] rain
[1:42:05] and he said what did they do they sowed
[1:42:07] the seeds he said billy graham
[1:42:09] sowed his seeds you know and then he
[1:42:11] said then oral roberts sowed his among
[1:42:13] the pentecostals
[1:42:14] and he said but now what else has
[1:42:16] happened he said there's also been a
[1:42:18] word
[1:42:18] seed sown to the people because now here
[1:42:22] he is with the
[1:42:23] with the with the revelation of jesus
[1:42:25] christ series he's already went back
[1:42:26] into the church jesus and took out all
[1:42:28] the errors and put back in everything
[1:42:29] they
[1:42:30] left out of the word of god and fixed it
[1:42:31] all up but the seals still aren't open
[1:42:34] but he's starting to realize
[1:42:35] hold on there has to be an event coming
[1:42:37] up here
[1:42:38] and he starts to say you know you you
[1:42:41] you've had your
[1:42:42] former rain and there'll have to come a
[1:42:45] lot of rain he said we've had the former
[1:42:47] rain of the word
[1:42:48] the planting the teaching rain and
[1:42:50] that's what you do when you're planting
[1:42:51] a crop you have a planting rain
[1:42:53] and it makes the ground ready for
[1:42:55] planting and then and then when the seed
[1:42:57] starts coming up
[1:42:58] there comes a last rain to carry it to
[1:43:01] harvest called
[1:43:02] a harvest rain or a latter rain i'm
[1:43:05] talking in nature
[1:43:06] now when that harvest rain comes then
[1:43:09] you don't want another rain after that
[1:43:12] because now the grain starts going
[1:43:14] forward the shock pulls back the grain
[1:43:16] goes out into the presence of the sun
[1:43:18] it was that harvest rain that allowed
[1:43:20] that
[1:43:21] and now all you want is to have sunny
[1:43:23] skies
[1:43:24] and let the sun bake out all the
[1:43:26] immaturity and break all the green out
[1:43:28] of that grain
[1:43:29] and get it ready for harvest time listen
[1:43:32] friends
[1:43:33] our latter rain when the seals were open
[1:43:35] and christ is among us
[1:43:36] what more revival are you looking for
[1:43:40] what more do you think god can do than
[1:43:41] he's already done
[1:43:43] we're not looking for something coming i
[1:43:45] don't need an eighth messenger i don't
[1:43:46] need a new doctrine
[1:43:48] i already have the revival the bride's
[1:43:51] revival
[1:43:53] why am i still here 50 years later
[1:43:54] because we're still getting the grain
[1:43:56] baked out
[1:43:57] we're still being matured and guess what
[1:43:59] the world is also
[1:44:01] showing its fruit because they also had
[1:44:04] their latter rain also
[1:44:06] and that's why you see the madness today
[1:44:11] today you see a line of demarcation
[1:44:13] between the bride and the rest of the
[1:44:15] world more sharply than it's
[1:44:16] ever been we're becoming so stand out
[1:44:19] now
[1:44:20] you can't even hide it anymore in fact
[1:44:23] is if people don't know you're different
[1:44:25] you are backslid
[1:44:28] i just say it to your face and to the
[1:44:31] camera
[1:44:31] if people don't know that you follow a
[1:44:35] unique
[1:44:36] message for this hour you are living
[1:44:39] backslid you have failed to go
[1:44:42] on in christ so that because you're
[1:44:45] supposed to be
[1:44:46] a ripe harvest ready for the grain and
[1:44:48] people should be able to see that
[1:44:50] they might not understand it but they
[1:44:52] should be able to notice it
[1:44:56] so so we that's that there there you
[1:44:59] come today
[1:45:00] that's where we're at and then brother
[1:45:01] branham so then he goes
[1:45:04] from now he said now he's dividing the
[1:45:06] seed it's not just global harvest it's
[1:45:08] not just global seed
[1:45:09] now wait a minute we got to dissect this
[1:45:11] there's a seed under billy graham
[1:45:13] there's a seed under pentecostalism
[1:45:15] there's a seed of the word
[1:45:17] they all got a form of rain they all got
[1:45:18] a ladder rain
[1:45:20] and now if that's true then they're all
[1:45:22] in harvest time
[1:45:24] the tares don't forget the tares
[1:45:28] are binded bound for the burning
[1:45:31] before the grain goes to the garner
[1:45:34] what are you seeing in the world today
[1:45:36] you're seeing the gathering
[1:45:38] of the tares but there's a bread
[1:45:41] gathering around the carcass
[1:45:43] of the word hallelujah
[1:45:46] and so you you you've got
[1:45:49] he talks about billy graham and what was
[1:45:51] his ministry
[1:45:52] now if you're loved billy graham i don't
[1:45:55] mean to hurt your feelings brother
[1:45:56] branham didn't
[1:45:57] wasn't disparaging billy graham he
[1:45:59] thought he was a great man of god
[1:46:01] but you understand his message was sent
[1:46:04] on purpose to blind the last day people
[1:46:10] i never got that
[1:46:13] i thought he's preaching salvation
[1:46:17] how does that blind the people until i
[1:46:18] went to his billy graham libraries
[1:46:20] museum
[1:46:21] in near charlotte north carolina and
[1:46:23] when i toured that place and i see all
[1:46:24] these pictures
[1:46:26] i see billy graham and he's with all of
[1:46:28] the hollywood elites and all the
[1:46:30] political elites and he's with jfk and
[1:46:31] he's writing in a card
[1:46:33] all the presidents from then on every
[1:46:34] president wants to talk to him
[1:46:36] you know his son today is leading a big
[1:46:39] prayer
[1:46:40] vigil on the capitol wonderful nothing
[1:46:42] evil to say about any of that
[1:46:44] but you have to understand that it
[1:46:47] blinded the people
[1:46:49] because billy who i my own personal
[1:46:52] opinion is he certainly had an
[1:46:53] experience with the lord
[1:46:55] but at least to the level that god would
[1:46:58] allow it whatever it was i'm sure he's
[1:47:00] saved now whether he
[1:47:01] you know is he gonna be part of the
[1:47:03] bride i don't think so but
[1:47:04] he that that doesn't mean he can't be
[1:47:06] saved you understand
[1:47:08] that just comes down to election friends
[1:47:09] you can't choose that
[1:47:11] you don't even choose christ christ said
[1:47:13] you haven't chosen me
[1:47:14] i chose you for the bride the elected
[1:47:18] lady she doesn't really have a choice to
[1:47:20] make her only choice is
[1:47:22] once she's taken as a wife her only
[1:47:24] choice is then
[1:47:25] as brother matt was preaching this
[1:47:26] morning in sunday school is to surrender
[1:47:29] and let the word let her allow her life
[1:47:32] to be
[1:47:32] uh to be come the visible word of god
[1:47:37] and so so he he took them to
[1:47:42] see they were blinded because
[1:47:45] that they they took it to mean
[1:47:50] that all i have to do is confess that
[1:47:53] jesus christ is the son of god who died
[1:47:55] for me
[1:47:56] and i'm i'm in i'm in dr graham
[1:47:59] that's right you're in i just have to
[1:48:01] have faith that's right
[1:48:03] through faith apart from your works
[1:48:05] that's all true
[1:48:07] that's all true but what what
[1:48:11] caught them was that they
[1:48:14] took that to mean a mental experience
[1:48:18] that that that it was a mental
[1:48:21] acceptance
[1:48:22] it wasn't a revealed truth because
[1:48:25] he he told them there's no
[1:48:28] need to go on to the holy ghost
[1:48:32] and so they don't they don't believe
[1:48:35] they need to
[1:48:36] they believe all i got to do is confess
[1:48:39] but but
[1:48:40] i mean if they would just go back i
[1:48:42] don't know i mean i mean
[1:48:43] you know it's such a blinding doctrine i
[1:48:45] look back and i go how could
[1:48:47] even dr graham not see if you go back to
[1:48:49] the book of leviticus which is
[1:48:51] which is the old testament version of
[1:48:53] the four gospels because the whole
[1:48:54] thing's about christ
[1:48:56] and so if you go into leviticus 6 you
[1:48:59] know one of the things they were
[1:49:00] commanded to do
[1:49:01] that this fire that is on the altar
[1:49:04] these sacrifices have to be burned
[1:49:07] and you can never let this fire go out
[1:49:10] told them three different times in the
[1:49:11] sixth chapter
[1:49:12] this fire is perpetual don't ever let it
[1:49:14] go out
[1:49:16] and so we find that then you go to
[1:49:18] chapter nine
[1:49:20] and you find that it's that the the
[1:49:23] presence of god
[1:49:24] comes out of the holy place and and puts
[1:49:28] the fire on the altar so it's it's
[1:49:30] actually
[1:49:31] the fire the fire indicates uh god's
[1:49:34] presence
[1:49:35] because and and when they so when they
[1:49:38] bring
[1:49:38] their sacrifice the first thing you've
[1:49:40] got to do is you
[1:49:42] you've got a a a brazen altar and then
[1:49:44] behind that you've got a brazen labor
[1:49:46] and that's where the priest washes so
[1:49:48] you've got to be
[1:49:49] justified sanctified you've got to be
[1:49:51] baptized i mean to say
[1:49:53] and then you go into the holy place and
[1:49:55] in the holy place you have the menorah
[1:49:57] you have the table of shoe bread you
[1:49:58] have all these things because that's
[1:49:59] sanctification
[1:50:00] it's candle light it's it's church ages
[1:50:03] light you understand it's not
[1:50:05] that that'll church age light isn't
[1:50:07] shining in beyond the veil
[1:50:09] beyond the veil is shekinah beyond the
[1:50:11] veil is christ beyond the veil is
[1:50:13] revelation 4 revelation 5
[1:50:15] isaiah 60. hallelujah you've got to go
[1:50:18] beyond that veil you can't just come
[1:50:21] and and and the pride and soul so so
[1:50:23] it's showing
[1:50:24] that that when they bring their offering
[1:50:27] and if you look
[1:50:28] if you go back and read i'm not going to
[1:50:29] take the time to read it today
[1:50:31] but if you go back and you read chapter
[1:50:33] 9 of leviticus
[1:50:35] you find that when they come in here's
[1:50:37] the bullock
[1:50:38] you've got to take the offering go take
[1:50:39] the fat and the kidneys and it's got to
[1:50:41] be burned
[1:50:42] and then and then with the blood without
[1:50:43] the camp and it comes all the way down
[1:50:45] and then then here comes god to testify
[1:50:48] in the last verse of chapter 9
[1:50:50] he comes roaring out can you give me
[1:50:52] leviticus 9 the last verse brother kevin
[1:50:54] i think is verse 24.
[1:50:56] i just want to read it for the people
[1:50:58] the last verse of leviticus 9.
[1:51:00] this is all from memory i hope i'm
[1:51:01] correct
[1:51:03] yeah and there came a fire out from
[1:51:06] before the lord
[1:51:08] and consumed upon the altar
[1:51:11] notice consumed upon the altar
[1:51:14] the burnt offering and the fat which
[1:51:16] when
[1:51:17] all the people saw they shouted and fell
[1:51:19] on their faces
[1:51:20] so the fire of god's presence
[1:51:24] consumes an offering that was
[1:51:27] already partially burnt
[1:51:31] when it came in it got put on the altar
[1:51:34] you understand when you repent that's a
[1:51:36] work of the holy ghost
[1:51:38] you understand this is all a work of the
[1:51:39] holy ghost but you can't stop there
[1:51:42] the holy fire had to come out because
[1:51:45] the presence of god
[1:51:47] it's not going to leave you partially
[1:51:48] burnt it's going to consume you
[1:51:52] it's going to completely annihilate your
[1:51:55] old nature
[1:51:56] and you're going to become a brand new
[1:51:58] creation in christ jesus
[1:52:01] and that fire followed them the entire
[1:52:03] 40 years and even after the wilderness
[1:52:06] because they were still offering
[1:52:07] sacrifices on the other side all the way
[1:52:09] up to solomon's day
[1:52:10] in second chronicles and when solomon
[1:52:12] built the temple
[1:52:13] the fire of god came out again and lit
[1:52:16] the altar
[1:52:17] hallelujah and that's where billy graham
[1:52:20] didn't take them to
[1:52:21] he took them to a repentance and their
[1:52:23] offering was brought and they really
[1:52:25] meant
[1:52:25] it and it was even partially burned but
[1:52:27] it wasn't consumed the holy ghost
[1:52:31] consumes you
[1:52:37] and so today they're blind they don't
[1:52:40] know
[1:52:41] i gotta they're they're still living in
[1:52:43] their old nature
[1:52:45] they've just been reformed
[1:52:49] and then as if poor mankind
[1:52:52] as if that ain't bad enough then oral
[1:52:55] roberts and that whole pentecostal
[1:52:56] movement
[1:52:57] they start they start telling them that
[1:52:59] you know extravagant wealth is the
[1:53:01] answer and they start chasing money in
[1:53:02] big buildings and big programs
[1:53:04] satellite tv and all kinds of you know
[1:53:06] jazz and
[1:53:08] pizzazz and big lights
[1:53:11] and money money you know wealth
[1:53:14] indicates spirituality
[1:53:16] name it claim it you know and that's why
[1:53:18] you see around the pentecostal movements
[1:53:20] of today
[1:53:21] that's why you see all these charlatans
[1:53:23] flying around in their learjet
[1:53:25] and they only fly around and lear jet a
[1:53:27] because learjet b's getting an oil
[1:53:29] change
[1:53:29] and and and and then and then they're
[1:53:32] driving around in their big limousines
[1:53:33] and their big motorcades and oh i have
[1:53:35] to do it because
[1:53:36] if i had to if i couldn't fly everywhere
[1:53:39] i just have to stop
[1:53:40] my ministry what vomit
[1:53:43] what vomit and they get up there and
[1:53:45] shake things and signs and wonders and
[1:53:47] pentecost will jump around them
[1:53:48] and so today today you know what you got
[1:53:53] today you've got a a political system
[1:53:55] because brother branham said
[1:53:56] that it's a try it's a it's a triple
[1:53:59] union
[1:54:00] of religious power political power
[1:54:04] and demon power and so
[1:54:07] here you've got a president and he's got
[1:54:09] evangelicals in one ear telling him all
[1:54:11] he's got to do is say jesus was the son
[1:54:13] of god
[1:54:14] and then you've got pentecostals in the
[1:54:15] other ear saying hey you're a rich man
[1:54:17] you're wealthy you're savvy you must be
[1:54:18] a christian
[1:54:22] and and and uh and the whole evangelical
[1:54:24] and pentecostal world
[1:54:26] puts a whoremonger in the office
[1:54:29] they don't care that he's a vile man
[1:54:32] they don't care that he
[1:54:33] the of the nasty horrible things that he
[1:54:36] does
[1:54:37] and and they they tell him you're our
[1:54:39] man you understand what brother branham
[1:54:41] was talking about
[1:54:42] brother branham said you've sowed to
[1:54:44] that that's what you wanted that's what
[1:54:46] god gave you now what are you going to
[1:54:47] do with it
[1:54:48] oh i'm saying and then on the other side
[1:54:50] you've got this communist movement
[1:54:51] and everybody's worried about that and i
[1:54:53] just hear a prophet saying
[1:54:55] ah communism ain't nothing it said
[1:54:58] what what they don't understand is
[1:55:00] they're all in the bed together
[1:55:02] and rome built the bedroom and rome
[1:55:06] built the bed
[1:55:07] and they're all rolling around under the
[1:55:09] covers together
[1:55:10] no wonder i'm not a part of it no wonder
[1:55:13] i don't care
[1:55:14] what happens in this political climate i
[1:55:16] don't care who's elected
[1:55:17] i'm not part of that that's not my life
[1:55:19] let them let them go let them have it
[1:55:22] i'm i've been founded on the word of god
[1:55:25] hallelujah i only care about the word of
[1:55:27] god
[1:55:28] thank god we have a an hour that we have
[1:55:31] arrived at
[1:55:32] where this is supreme in the mind of
[1:55:34] god's elected people
[1:55:36] hallelujah i don't care what they do it
[1:55:39] doesn't matter to me who's going to get
[1:55:41] elected whoever god needs to be in the
[1:55:43] office
[1:55:44] he's going to do exactly what god wants
[1:55:46] him to do they're all
[1:55:47] puppets in the hand of my father
[1:55:50] hallelujah i'm glad there's a word
[1:55:52] revival in this hour
[1:55:54] i'm glad there's a perfect faith that
[1:55:56] can lift you up out of the shadows
[1:56:01] you think you think they care they don't
[1:56:04] care
[1:56:05] it's all political they got they got
[1:56:08] black lives matter political movement
[1:56:10] they don't care that much about black
[1:56:12] lives
[1:56:15] all they've done is they did that in the
[1:56:17] 1960s
[1:56:18] women's liberation hijacked the civil
[1:56:20] rights movement
[1:56:22] go read your history women started going
[1:56:25] in the street and offended
[1:56:26] african-americans i
[1:56:28] if you've ever read dr steele's book uh
[1:56:30] on shame
[1:56:32] and he breaks this down he's an
[1:56:33] african-american scholar
[1:56:35] and he breaks it down and he's saying
[1:56:37] listen
[1:56:38] listen my people he calls him his people
[1:56:40] that's not me that's him
[1:56:42] and he says they've been lying to us all
[1:56:44] along
[1:56:45] he said what happened and he tells the
[1:56:46] story he said that women's lib
[1:56:49] saw the success of the civil rights
[1:56:52] movement
[1:56:54] and even and even brother branham talks
[1:56:55] about how that communism had infiltrated
[1:56:58] it
[1:56:59] and it was inspired by communists and so
[1:57:02] so we find but yet it's still a noble
[1:57:04] cause equality
[1:57:06] under the law and justice for all is a
[1:57:08] noble cause
[1:57:10] on any planet at any time that's a noble
[1:57:13] cause
[1:57:14] and we support that noble cause there
[1:57:16] should be equality thank god there's
[1:57:18] coming a millennium
[1:57:19] and there's gonna be equality and
[1:57:21] justice for all
[1:57:23] you're never going to get peace till
[1:57:24] jesus comes and and so you find then
[1:57:27] that
[1:57:27] that that that he says the the women's
[1:57:30] liberation movement
[1:57:32] saw that and they jumped on board and
[1:57:34] started marching in the streets
[1:57:35] and started carrying their their you
[1:57:37] know their we wanted quality too
[1:57:40] you know we wanted quality too and the
[1:57:41] reason they needed to to say that and
[1:57:43] the reason
[1:57:44] our only reason a woman would feel that
[1:57:46] way she's not wired to feel that way
[1:57:47] the only reason she time starts feeling
[1:57:49] that way is when she gets abused by men
[1:57:54] because men are supposed to live like
[1:57:56] jesus
[1:57:57] and if she lives like if men live like
[1:58:00] boaz
[1:58:01] ruth isn't worried about equality she
[1:58:03] knows that if she gets boaz
[1:58:05] she gets the whole field the whole
[1:58:07] estate in the whole kingdom
[1:58:09] she doesn't have to fight for any rights
[1:58:11] boaz can't do enough for her
[1:58:15] now just remember that's how he feels
[1:58:17] about you as his bride
[1:58:19] you don't have to march and hold up
[1:58:21] signs jesus
[1:58:22] you promised to heal me now come and
[1:58:24] heal me now you don't have to beat on
[1:58:26] the doors of heaven
[1:58:27] you don't have to break things down all
[1:58:29] you got to do is raise up your hands and
[1:58:30] say lord i surrender all
[1:58:32] give me every promise in the word give
[1:58:34] me let it pour out upon my family
[1:58:37] upon my life upon my health hallelujah
[1:58:40] this is the privilege that we have today
[1:58:42] why would you live
[1:58:44] underprivileged people do it all the
[1:58:47] time
[1:58:48] sons and daughters of god live
[1:58:50] underprivileged
[1:58:52] victory right in front of you and won't
[1:58:53] reach out and take it i feel sorry for
[1:58:56] you
[1:58:57] hallelujah and so so we find that
[1:59:00] that that dr shield starts talking about
[1:59:02] how that they hijack that movement
[1:59:04] see that's what they always do that's
[1:59:06] what they've done today they take a
[1:59:08] they take an extension of the civil
[1:59:10] rights movement crying for justice and
[1:59:12] equality
[1:59:12] and and antifa jumps in and all the
[1:59:15] political now the whole thing becomes a
[1:59:16] political quagmire
[1:59:18] and this one's lying they're all lying
[1:59:21] all of them the the the race that's
[1:59:25] being happened today is who can lie the
[1:59:26] fastest
[1:59:29] who can tell the biggest one and make
[1:59:31] people believe it
[1:59:33] come on friends that's the truth
[1:59:36] that's the truth you two might not allow
[1:59:37] that on their side they might throw this
[1:59:39] this sermon off but that's the truth
[1:59:41] anyway they're all lying republic cons
[1:59:44] and democrats and independents it
[1:59:46] doesn't matter the only truth in the
[1:59:48] world today is christ
[1:59:50] hallelujah he's that's the only truth
[1:59:52] that's left there's the mind of christ
[1:59:54] the only thing that can guide you
[1:59:59] they even started carrying a sign dr
[2:00:01] steele starts talk about how that they
[2:00:02] carried a sign
[2:00:04] that that that uh repressed women
[2:00:07] are the new n word except they spelled
[2:00:10] out the word
[2:00:12] and the black people started going hold
[2:00:14] on y'all that's going a little too far
[2:00:16] but they didn't care by that time they
[2:00:18] didn't care about civil rights they only
[2:00:20] cared about
[2:00:20] their rights you understand
[2:00:24] and so you find that that
[2:00:27] okay let me let me i gotta find a
[2:00:28] stopping place
[2:00:31] so here we come 21st century
[2:00:36] half century after the seals more than
[2:00:38] half century more than half a century
[2:00:40] after the prophet's gone what are we
[2:00:42] doing what's it all about why are we
[2:00:43] still here
[2:00:44] are we waiting on something is something
[2:00:47] moving
[2:00:47] amongst us has something already
[2:00:49] happened yes yes
[2:00:51] and yes i'm waiting on a body change i
[2:00:54] don't have it yet
[2:00:56] i ain't stop until i get it don't bring
[2:01:00] me a fancy doctrine telling me
[2:01:02] that ain't coming if i'm in the
[2:01:04] millennium now
[2:01:05] i want a refund
[2:01:10] i want my money back all you people that
[2:01:13] have been paying ties so faithfully for
[2:01:15] years if i get up here and preach the
[2:01:16] millennium's past
[2:01:18] you need to demand a refund
[2:01:22] hey man and i'll run for the hills
[2:01:26] because i already gave it all away sorry
[2:01:28] i haven't gave your money all the way
[2:01:29] ain't got any more of it
[2:01:32] amen so so we find that that here we are
[2:01:37] in the harvest time now we're in the
[2:01:39] real harvest time
[2:01:40] i'm so glad because this is the real one
[2:01:43] this is the real one this is the one the
[2:01:44] whole church has waited on for years
[2:01:48] and and if you if you just look because
[2:01:51] remember jesus
[2:01:52] shows as the light and of several things
[2:01:54] as the lightning cometh out of the east
[2:01:56] shineth unto the west
[2:01:57] so shall it be the coming of the son of
[2:01:59] man this is the time when the
[2:02:01] eagles would gather around the carcass
[2:02:03] then he goes into
[2:02:04] luke as it was in the days of noah as it
[2:02:07] was in the days of lot
[2:02:08] and if you look at lot brother branham
[2:02:09] draws that so clearly and i don't have
[2:02:11] time to get into it today
[2:02:12] he draws that so clearly in spoken words
[2:02:14] original seed
[2:02:15] of of how that abraham stayed up there
[2:02:18] with melchizedek
[2:02:19] lot was down there in the city he got
[2:02:21] see lot got involved in politics he
[2:02:23] became like a judge
[2:02:25] you know he he he set on the supreme
[2:02:27] court there
[2:02:28] and so you know he's like a ruler he's
[2:02:30] like the mayor of the city he sits in
[2:02:32] the gate and
[2:02:32] makes and judges that's the way the east
[2:02:34] that's the way they did it in the east
[2:02:36] so he's all involved he's in the
[2:02:38] trenches of it
[2:02:39] and you say oh yeah that was all just
[2:02:42] that was all just homosexuality it was
[2:02:44] way more than that well it was
[2:02:46] perversion of
[2:02:47] at every level the homes were out of
[2:02:49] order children were out of order
[2:02:51] families jobs government laws everything
[2:02:54] and and if you i mean if you notice when
[2:02:58] the angels come into sodom
[2:03:01] here you've got one side of the
[2:03:03] government you know what he's you know
[2:03:05] what you know what lot's message was to
[2:03:06] them
[2:03:07] hey listen uh it's almost dark things
[2:03:09] get a little crazy at dark you can't
[2:03:11] stay out here on the streets
[2:03:13] because you need to come inside because
[2:03:15] when it gets dark
[2:03:16] rioters come they start breaking down
[2:03:18] doors they start crashing through things
[2:03:20] we've got a big political upheaval in
[2:03:23] come inside
[2:03:24] they will abuse you and you know what
[2:03:26] happened
[2:03:27] sure enough as soon as sun went down the
[2:03:30] rioting started
[2:03:32] the looting the burning they're trying
[2:03:33] to break in now you talk about looting
[2:03:35] they're trying to break in
[2:03:36] they don't want to steal uh you know
[2:03:40] they don't want to steal mp3 players and
[2:03:42] computers and flat screens
[2:03:44] they want to steal two men so they can
[2:03:47] have relations with them out in the
[2:03:49] street
[2:03:50] you're talking about this is the spirit
[2:03:52] that's on the
[2:03:53] age today at night time it's not even
[2:03:56] safe to be on the streets in some cities
[2:03:58] in the daytime you've got people quietly
[2:04:02] protesting that's their right that's
[2:04:04] what we want to allow them that's what
[2:04:05] america is about
[2:04:06] but at night then you get these hired
[2:04:08] activists who get bussed in and shipped
[2:04:10] in
[2:04:11] yeah you see and they've already proven
[2:04:12] all that i'm not here to preach on
[2:04:13] politics
[2:04:14] i'm just here to tell you you you need
[2:04:16] to be thanking god
[2:04:17] that you've been called up above it
[2:04:19] you've been called out of it friends
[2:04:21] praise the name of the lord you've been
[2:04:23] called out of it you know what we see it
[2:04:25] for what it is the world is in fear not
[2:04:27] the bride
[2:04:28] say the world said what is going on the
[2:04:30] bride goes well come here and i'll show
[2:04:32] you what's going on
[2:04:33] oh that can't be right really it's
[2:04:36] always been
[2:04:38] everything you're afraid of it describes
[2:04:41] it tells where it came from how it got
[2:04:42] here what's going to happen how it's
[2:04:44] going to go and what's going to happen
[2:04:45] to you if you stay in it
[2:04:47] thank god it also tells about that one
[2:04:49] came and took the book and opened the
[2:04:50] seals and loosed the seals
[2:04:52] and came down to a prophet and a prophet
[2:04:54] gave a message to a bride
[2:04:55] and a bride is eating the book
[2:04:57] hallelujah
[2:04:58] why because i'm not planning to stay
[2:05:00] here i'm not involved with here
[2:05:01] i'm going home i got a body change
[2:05:04] coming
[2:05:05] i got perfect faith surrounding me an
[2:05:07] atmosphere
[2:05:08] of perfect faith why because i've been
[2:05:10] made a partaker
[2:05:11] of the eternal flame i've had the fire
[2:05:15] of god
[2:05:16] that came out and consumed me
[2:05:20] that fire indicates the presence of god
[2:05:23] that's what it indicated
[2:05:25] because because they knew from
[2:05:27] deuteronomy uh
[2:05:29] i think four maybe by the jd my uh that
[2:05:32] god is a consuming fire
[2:05:34] i think deuteronomy 4 my god is a
[2:05:36] consuming fire so they
[2:05:38] they they know that the fire represents
[2:05:42] god's here because it's consuming the
[2:05:44] offering
[2:05:45] and i mean that that's why that john
[2:05:50] when he's preaching to the people
[2:05:52] baptizing
[2:05:53] he says when he comes he'll baptize you
[2:05:56] in
[2:05:57] fire and in the upper room guess what
[2:06:00] showed up
[2:06:01] fire tongues of fire what did it did
[2:06:04] what did it indicate
[2:06:05] the presence of almighty god
[2:06:09] was among the church that's what a
[2:06:12] prophet is sent for a prophet is sent to
[2:06:15] conduct you into the presence of god
[2:06:17] and so god sends a prophet because he's
[2:06:19] got to be here
[2:06:20] as a facilitator of a marriage
[2:06:24] what happens there's going to be an
[2:06:26] invisible union that the world doesn't
[2:06:28] know nothing about
[2:06:29] but who the married ones are we know
[2:06:31] what it's all about
[2:06:34] hallelujah oh stand up friends let's

[2:07:14] i know there's madness on the streets i
[2:07:16] know it's chaos i know it's
[2:07:18] listen relax breathe it's supposed to be
[2:07:22] here
[2:07:24] say what's happening everything this
[2:07:25] said would
[2:07:27] what do we do everything this said do

[2:07:33] worry
[2:07:35] we already got the script i knew it was
[2:07:38] coming before it got here
[2:07:39] i know what it is now that it is here i
[2:07:42] know where it'll end up
[2:07:45] it'll end up in a tribulation period
[2:07:48] why am i not afraid of that because when
[2:07:51] i read in here i go oh
[2:07:52] okay i don't go to that i i go out and
[2:07:55] rapture okay i'm good
[2:07:58] i'm good whoo i don't
[2:08:01] buy i don't go down with this ship i go

[2:08:07] started going up i'm already in an order
[2:08:09] of ascending
[2:08:11] already ascending the devil's already
[2:08:13] descending he wasn't in revelation 5.

[2:14:03] just lay it aside
[2:14:04] what difference does it make so
[2:14:07] we've got a sickness or an illness so
[2:14:09] we've had a
[2:14:10] suffered a loss so what i get it all
[2:14:12] back anyway i'm going to heaven i'm
[2:14:14] going in a rapture what difference
[2:14:16] what why why do i care what the devil
[2:14:18] has done
[2:14:19] whatever my father allowed him for my
[2:14:22] good
[2:14:22] teach me a lesson grow me mature me
[2:14:24] whatever it is
[2:14:26] lord let us just lay anything that's
[2:14:28] hindering our heart
[2:14:30] and our mind anything that's hindering
[2:14:32] us to have free worship
[2:14:34] to have free love for you to have the to
[2:14:37] be a
[2:14:38] conduit of the flow of the
[2:14:41] of the love of god may you just cleanse
[2:14:45] us
[2:14:45] of it lord a lot of times father
[2:14:48] [Music]
[2:14:49] trials can be so severe that's hard to
[2:14:51] do
[2:14:52] sometimes wounds can be so deep it's not
[2:14:55] it's easier said than done
[2:14:57] you know where you want to be mentally
[2:14:59] but getting there
[2:15:01] so lord we're asking today for a measure
[2:15:03] of that grace that was promised to us
[2:15:06] at the appearing of christ now we know
[2:15:09] we have his appearing we know it's that
[2:15:10] day it's that
[2:15:12] it that's what makes this day one of the
[2:15:13] things that makes it unique from all the
[2:15:15] other ages
[2:15:19] we don't have a further understanding
[2:15:24] of the revelation of jesus christ than
[2:15:26] the
[2:15:27] early church had they and paul
[2:15:30] understood all of that paul understood
[2:15:32] the rapture mystery
[2:15:33] he understood who melchizedek was he
[2:15:35] understood election
[2:15:37] there's nothing that that we even
[2:15:39] believe nothing a prophet even brought
[2:15:41] or ever preached
[2:15:42] that wasn't based on paul's teaching
[2:15:47] we do have a unique day there's never
[2:15:50] been a day
[2:15:51] quite like this one because now
[2:15:54] we are to finish fulfilling the
[2:15:57] unfulfilled parts that church fell away
[2:16:00] we're predestinated not to
[2:16:02] [Music]
[2:16:03] we will finish accomplishing that
[2:16:06] perfect
[2:16:06] image of christ and it will change
[2:16:10] our mortal bodies
[2:16:14] so we we know that we're in an
[2:16:17] age like has never been there's never an
[2:16:19] age promised
[2:16:20] to where satan was would be called the
[2:16:23] god of the age that was never paul's day
[2:16:25] there was never no it took a prophet in
[2:16:27] this day to
[2:16:29] to call the world condition satan's eden
[2:16:33] well it couldn't have been back two
[2:16:35] thousand years ago because
[2:16:36] satan needed six thousand years to
[2:16:38] accomplish it he didn't have it done in
[2:16:40] four thousand years he was just getting
[2:16:41] started
[2:16:42] so so there's never been a day like this
[2:16:45] day
[2:16:47] there's never been a people who will
[2:16:49] globally around the world
[2:16:51] this elect lady will take a flight
[2:16:54] she'll she'll be changed in a moment
[2:16:58] in the twinkling of an eye the dead in
[2:17:00] christ shall rise and we which are alive
[2:17:02] and remain
[2:17:04] there will be some who are alive and
[2:17:06] remain
[2:17:07] i plan to be one of those i'm alive
[2:17:11] and i remain a believer i am steadfast
[2:17:15] more today than
[2:17:16] at any other day of my life
[2:17:20] i feel like sometimes i feel like wow i
[2:17:22] have more failures than at any time in
[2:17:24] my life
[2:17:25] but lord the bar has been moved up but
[2:17:28] the grace is here
[2:17:30] so we all we have to do is avail
[2:17:32] ourselves of that love of god
[2:17:34] that grace that's here it is here it's
[2:17:37] among us i'm not waiting on it it's here
[2:17:39] now
[2:17:39] i don't need another revival i i i have
[2:17:42] the
[2:17:43] revival of the word
[2:17:48] so lord we just carry on day by day
[2:17:52] i i every day want to separate myself
[2:17:57] more and more from this world
[2:18:00] and all of its pursuits devices
[2:18:04] applaud its accomplishments i don't care
[2:18:07] about it lord
[2:18:08] i care about the people in it that i
[2:18:10] might win some
[2:18:12] that i might tell everybody
[2:18:15] about somebody who can help anybody
[2:18:19] grant that to us today lord god
[2:18:23] the word we've heard lord was covered a
[2:18:26] lot of ground
[2:18:27] and didn't cover anything exhaustively
[2:18:30] but it was the burden of the word on my
[2:18:32] heart and i feel satisfied
[2:18:34] that i've unburdened myself now maybe
[2:18:36] next time we can slow down and teach it
[2:18:39] and bring the quotes and the scriptures
[2:18:40] and draw it out
[2:18:42] lord because teaching establishes the
[2:18:43] church we need to know what it is we
[2:18:45] believe
[2:18:46] and why we believe it but lord we love
[2:18:49] you today
[2:18:50] for what you've given us today we want
[2:18:52] to rededicate our hearts and minds to
[2:18:54] say my goodness
[2:18:56] this thing's this thing's bigger than
[2:18:57] what i thought and i'm really involved
[2:18:59] in something here
[2:19:00] i really need to get on with it so help
[2:19:03] us lord today
[2:19:04] give us that zeal that we so need father
[2:19:08] that zeal
[2:19:08] for the word for the spirit of god
[2:19:12] we commit ourselves into your hands in
[2:19:14] jesus name
[2:19:15] amen do you love him sing it for us
