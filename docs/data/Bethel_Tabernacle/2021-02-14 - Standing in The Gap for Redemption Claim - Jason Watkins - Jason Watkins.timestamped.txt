[39:37] gland
[39:39] that they i'm not going to try to
[39:40] pronounce that word they think is
[39:43] that word it is rare but usually benign
[39:46] we are waiting
[39:47] on more labs and i have a pet scan on
[39:50] march
[39:50] 3. even if it is not this they are
[39:53] recommending surgery based on its size
[39:55] please pray
[39:56] that if it's god's will it will shrink
[39:58] or totally resolved by the time of the
[40:00] skin
[40:01] it's also causing pain man when i read
[40:03] that i read that i was driving to church
[40:06] i just thought about how many times over
[40:08] the years i have seen
[40:10] god just take these kind of things and
[40:11] just dissolve them
[40:13] they just simply go out of existence you
[40:15] can't even hardly account for it other
[40:16] than it's a miracle
[40:18] by the hand of the lord so amen we're
[40:21] going to join and pray
[40:22] with our sister over this need as well
[40:26] that's all that i saw that came in to me
[40:29] i i can't remember if there were others

[40:53] wow so brother jd's in california
[40:55] [Music]
[40:57] and uh ministering to saints out there
[40:59] it's a real mission field here
[41:01] it's a real mission field here in
[41:02] california you better not get any ideas
[41:05] amen um my lots of hurting people due to
[41:09] lots of false teaching and nicolaitanism
[41:11] very sad

[41:41] we sure won't that can happen i think
[41:44] they've got it beaten it's not quite

[42:04] amen after this verse 1
[42:08] revelation 4 1 after this i
[42:11] looked and behold a door was opened in
[42:13] heaven
[42:14] and the first voice which i heard was
[42:18] as it were of a trumpet talking with me
[42:21] which said come up hither and i will
[42:24] show thee things which
[42:25] must be hereafter we're going to read
[42:29] from chapter
[42:30] 5 but let's pray and we'll let you be
[42:32] seated
[42:34] master we're thanking you for the
[42:36] reading of your word we thank you for
[42:39] our
[42:39] sunday school class this morning i thank
[42:41] you for my
[42:43] bible study that i taught early this
[42:45] morning lord we're
[42:47] thanking you for now coming again lord
[42:50] again for the third time to to bring
[42:53] your word to
[42:54] hungry hearts lord we are trusting you
[42:57] for the
[42:58] evening fellowship lord where we'll
[42:59] bring it a fourth time
[43:01] lord my heart is just so filled with
[43:03] your presence and
[43:05] i feel that i know exactly what you want
[43:08] for us today and so master i the best
[43:11] thing i can do quickly
[43:13] as i've done since early morning's light
[43:15] is just surrender and step
[43:16] out of the way let you be the speaker
[43:19] lord
[43:20] i thank you master for the two services
[43:22] already and we're asking that you be
[43:24] mighty in this one and master
[43:26] we are asking prayer for our special
[43:29] needs
[43:30] for the unspoken request of brother
[43:32] donald lord for
[43:34] rhett jackson lord and for beaufort
[43:37] taylor and his
[43:38] family for our sister chastity lord
[43:41] we're trusting you for brother jason
[43:43] lord
[43:44] uh in the mission fields lord and uh
[43:47] and needing needing the holy spirit to
[43:49] move in a mighty way we're thinking of
[43:51] brother longoria
[43:52] this morning father we're asking for
[43:55] your mercy
[43:56] in all of these cases we ask because we
[43:59] believe that you'll move
[44:01] if we didn't we wouldn't bother praying
[44:03] because the
[44:04] the apostle has taught us that if you
[44:06] don't believe
[44:07] you need not think you'll get anything
[44:09] from god so
[44:10] we are coming with faith believing that
[44:12] you hear our prayers
[44:14] lord and may you bring all of these
[44:15] things to pass according to your riches
[44:18] in glory
[44:19] we commit it to you now in jesus name
[44:21] amen god bless you as you're seated
[44:27] and we'll turn right away to chapter
[44:31] 5. praise the lord
[44:45] yeah okay brother jason clarifying
[44:48] the one of the problems is the church
[44:51] has has been without a pastor
[44:53] and so that was his comment you know
[44:55] there's no leadership
[44:56] ministry there in the ministry because
[44:58] they've been without a pastor for many
[45:00] years
[45:01] so we're just wanting to keep
[45:02] remembering that amen brother jd we sure
[45:05] will do it
[45:06] now one
[45:09] i want to by the help of the lord today
[45:13] to take a title standing in the gap
[45:16] for redemption's claim standing in the
[45:19] gap
[45:20] for redemption's claim there's a lot of
[45:22] places i'm going to take us to
[45:25] um in the scripture today we probably
[45:28] won't turn
[45:29] beyond what we're reading now because i
[45:31] won't think sir i want to move
[45:33] oh happy to have brother anthony's
[45:34] family here uh with us today
[45:37] so uh sister alicia i think praise the
[45:40] lord happy to have you sister god bless
[45:42] you
[45:42] and um amen that y'all got quite an
[45:45] announcement
[45:46] this morning amen praise the lord amen
[45:49] praise the lord
[45:50] so uh congratulations brother luther
[45:53] amen just listen
[45:54] melissa will be praying for you and
[45:59] amen
[46:00] [Laughter]
[46:03] amen so it's not every day you get to
[46:06] uh marry an ex-mafia hitman and
[46:09] luther denies that but we don't believe
[46:11] it amen
[46:12] we we we know what we see
[46:17] happy to have that announced this
[46:20] morning that was a secret that was hard
[46:22] to sit on
[46:23] felt like blowing up into outer space
[46:25] with it amen
[46:26] so we are delighted and thrilled
[46:28] couldn't be more thrilled
[46:30] so um we're going to go
[46:34] several places in the scripture today
[46:36] and
[46:37] so since i'm not going to turn i'll just
[46:38] do a lot of storytelling
[46:40] i love telling the stories of the bible
[46:42] i learned that from my mom
[46:44] she was a master storyteller and uh
[46:47] and i love telling stories out of the
[46:48] bible and so
[46:51] we find that that in this whole idea of
[46:54] standing in the gap
[46:56] for redemption's claim now
[47:00] one of the things as i just lead in to
[47:03] this thought that it's going to be
[47:06] important for you to understand
[47:08] about the verses in chapter four
[47:11] that we read chapter four
[47:15] is is the beginning of a of a
[47:18] of an event that happened where john was
[47:22] caught up into the throne
[47:24] room of god now
[47:27] when john tells the event he tells it
[47:30] across chapter 4 and chapter 5. now this
[47:33] is a super important point
[47:35] he tells it as one narrative now
[47:39] hundreds of years later when the
[47:41] translators
[47:42] constructed the bible you have they put
[47:45] it in
[47:46] individual chapters john didn't do that
[47:48] you understand
[47:49] jaundice wrote a letter to the church
[47:51] saying here's what happened to me
[47:53] and he said there after he looked at the
[47:56] the ages uh how how god
[47:59] raptured his church at the end of
[48:01] chapter 3
[48:03] then brother branham would make a
[48:04] statement when he's teaching on
[48:07] in the breach from chapter five because
[48:09] that's where he's gonna go because he's
[48:10] gonna pick up
[48:11] boaz and boaz was a redeemer he was the
[48:14] one who was going to redeem
[48:16] ruth and then get naomi
[48:20] amen so so we realized that
[48:23] uh he was going to redeem naomi and then
[48:25] he gets ruth as a bride
[48:27] to be his wife and so we realize then
[48:30] that he's a perfect type of christ he's
[48:32] the goel g-o-e-l
[48:35] and it means an intermediary it means a
[48:38] a redeemer it means somebody who stepped
[48:41] in between
[48:42] all right and that's going to be
[48:43] important because i'm going to tell you
[48:46] something friends
[48:47] you needed somebody to stand between you
[48:49] and a holy god
[48:50] because the problem was you you love god
[48:54] and god loves you
[48:55] but you're born in sin and you live in a
[48:58] body that's still in a fallen condition
[49:01] and so there's no way that you know
[49:04] that you could ever be pleasing no
[49:06] matter how
[49:08] well you observed legalistic codes in
[49:10] the scripture it wouldn't even matter
[49:12] your your best effort of righteousness
[49:15] would be filthiness
[49:16] still to him you understand that
[49:19] so so we find that there had to be
[49:22] a worthy one step in between you
[49:26] john was standing here in the scripture
[49:28] and you're going to read it here in a
[49:29] minute when we get to chapter five i'm
[49:30] just
[49:31] giving you some foundation that that
[49:33] you're gonna find that
[49:34] john is destroyed by what he sees
[49:39] he he saw his last scene that he saw was
[49:42] christ walking in the midst of the seven
[49:45] lamp stands
[49:46] and then he saw a terrible scene at the
[49:49] end
[49:50] of the last age he saw christ put out of
[49:52] his own church
[49:54] and standing knocking asking for
[49:57] entrance into people's hearts
[49:59] individually
[50:00] and so the next thing he says after this
[50:03] i
[50:04] i he says looked and behold a door was
[50:06] opened in heaven
[50:08] and the first voice which i heard was as
[50:10] it were of a trumpet talking with me
[50:13] which said come up hither and i will
[50:15] show thee things
[50:16] which must be hereafter all right
[50:20] and immediately i was in the spirit
[50:23] and behold a throne was set in heaven
[50:26] and
[50:26] one sat on the throne now go to chapter
[50:28] 5 verse 1
[50:30] you'll see the continuation and i saw in
[50:32] the right hand of him that sat on the
[50:34] throne
[50:35] amen you see that flow see that
[50:39] he he was caught up and one seated on
[50:41] the throne
[50:42] and i saw in the right hand of him that
[50:46] sat on on the throne a book
[50:49] written within and on the backside
[50:51] sealed with seven seals and i saw a
[50:54] strong angel
[50:55] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[50:59] worthy
[50:59] to open the book and to loose the seals
[51:02] thereof
[51:03] and no man in heaven nor in earth
[51:05] neither under the earth
[51:07] was able to open the book neither to
[51:09] look thereon
[51:10] and i wept much because no man
[51:14] was found worthy to open and to read the
[51:17] book
[51:18] neither to look thereon one of the
[51:21] elders
[51:22] saith unto me weep not behold the lion
[51:25] of the tribe of judah
[51:27] the root of david hath prevailed to
[51:30] open the book and to loose the seven
[51:32] seals
[51:33] thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst
[51:36] of the throne
[51:37] and of the four beasts and in the midst
[51:39] of the elders stood a lamb
[51:42] as it had been slain having seven horns
[51:45] and seven eyes
[51:46] which are the seven spirits of god sent
[51:48] forth into all the earth
[51:50] and he came and took the book out of the
[51:53] right hand of him
[51:54] that sat upon the throne and when he had
[51:57] taken the book
[51:58] the four beasts and four and twenty
[52:00] elders fell down before the lamb
[52:03] having every one of them harps and
[52:05] golden vials full of odors
[52:07] which are the prayers of the saints and
[52:10] they sung
[52:11] a new song saying thou art
[52:14] worthy now we went from weeping much to
[52:17] singing
[52:18] see thou art worthy to take the book
[52:22] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[52:25] was slain
[52:26] and has redeemed us to god by thy blood
[52:29] out of every kindred and tongue and
[52:32] people
[52:33] and nation see you get that and has
[52:36] made us unto our god kings and priests
[52:40] and we shall reign on the earth right
[52:43] and i beheld
[52:45] and i heard the voice of many angels
[52:47] round about the throne and the beast
[52:49] and the elders and the number of them
[52:52] was
[52:52] ten thousand times ten thousand and
[52:55] thousands
[52:56] of thousands saying with a loud voice
[53:00] worthy is the lamb that was slain to
[53:03] receive
[53:04] power and riches and wisdom
[53:07] and strength and honor and glory
[53:10] and blessing do you wish all of those
[53:13] upon him
[53:14] today amen and every creature
[53:18] which is in heaven and on the earth
[53:21] and under the earth and such as are in
[53:24] the sea
[53:25] and all i mean john's not leaving
[53:27] anything out and
[53:28] all that are in them heard eyes
[53:31] saying blessing and honor and glory
[53:35] and power be unto him that sitteth upon
[53:39] the throne
[53:40] and unto the lamb forever and ever now
[53:43] the angels are already making a
[53:47] loud noise but yet john says
[53:50] as loud as they were everybody heard me
[53:55] what i was doing was even louder amen
[53:58] and so so so you've got voice of
[54:02] many angels and then you've got you've
[54:04] got
[54:05] how is one man out shouting
[54:08] the voice of many angels and ten
[54:11] thousand
[54:12] times ten thousands and thousands and
[54:14] thousands of others
[54:16] how is john's voice louder than theirs
[54:19] i'm here to tell you something this is a
[54:20] happy man
[54:21] [Music]
[54:21] [Applause]
[54:22] this was a happy man over over one
[54:25] somebody
[54:26] taking that book so i want you to absorb
[54:29] that today
[54:30] you talking i mean that you you've never
[54:32] been in a in a rally
[54:34] this loud this deafening all right
[54:37] and so he says and the four beasts said
[54:41] amen i mean that's all they could say
[54:44] everybody's shouting and rejoicing
[54:46] and everybody's just saying power and
[54:48] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[54:50] and glory and blessing
[54:52] and john is saying blessing and honor
[54:54] and glory and power
[54:55] and they're all agreeing and and what
[54:57] can the four
[54:58] creatures do but agree and say amen what
[55:01] they say amen
[55:03] i'm going to tell you those four living
[55:04] creatures are the anointings
[55:06] that are upon the church and there is an
[55:08] anointing falling on you to say
[55:10] amen to every word and when you start
[55:13] rejoicing there's an anointing behind
[55:16] that
[55:16] and that's why you feel it and the world
[55:18] says what's your problem
[55:20] and you say i'm rejoicing because i
[55:22] ain't got a problem you're the one with
[55:24] the problem
[55:25] somebody took my problem
[55:27] [Applause]
[55:32] wow oh my
[55:37] so we find that you're seeing this
[55:40] one you know
[55:44] th this is this is a continuous
[55:47] epic event that john
[55:50] is witnessing john goes from
[55:55] much weeping and brother branham talks
[55:58] about how that
[55:59] the reason that he was weeping is
[56:02] because
[56:04] when john's there expecting
[56:07] i mean the last thing he saw was christ
[56:09] put out
[56:11] now you could imagine that he he's
[56:13] already upset
[56:14] and then he gets caught up into an open
[56:16] door which an open door is always a
[56:19] further revelation of jesus christ it's
[56:20] always that in the bible it's never not
[56:22] that
[56:23] and so we find that of course chapter
[56:26] four
[56:27] is the bride going into rapture as it
[56:29] relates to the bride leaving the last
[56:31] age she certainly does do that
[56:33] chronologically in time over time she
[56:35] leaves and heads into the millennium at
[56:37] the end of the seventh age we don't need
[56:39] an eighth age we don't need an eighth
[56:40] messenger
[56:41] we've got the messenger and that's
[56:43] christ all right
[56:45] so but brother branham explains in the
[56:47] breach he says now what he's doing in
[56:49] chapter
[56:50] chapters by the end of chapter three the
[56:52] church goes in the rapture but in
[56:54] chapter five and we have to include four
[56:57] i just proved it four is the same story
[57:00] he says in chapter five he's showing how
[57:04] he did it
[57:05] it showed that he the bride does go up
[57:07] at the end of the seventh age and now
[57:09] he's going to show how he pulled it off
[57:11] all right
[57:12] because there was no way for that church
[57:15] to go in the rapture brother branham
[57:16] said the church can't go in the rapture
[57:20] and she can't get any better and now
[57:23] she's put christ
[57:24] out now she really can't get any better
[57:27] you understand so
[57:28] so if there hadn't have come a message
[57:31] that's why god says
[57:32] i'll send you elijah before the coming
[57:35] of the great and dreadful day of the
[57:36] lord lest i smite the earth with a curse
[57:38] in other words
[57:39] i already know they're going to kick me
[57:41] out i already know there's no way to get
[57:43] them in a rapture
[57:44] and so it instead of just wiping it all
[57:47] out i'll first send elijah
[57:49] and he'll gather a bride hallelujah
[57:51] there'll be a message to go around the
[57:53] world
[57:54] and i'll get it i'll get me a queen
[57:56] [Applause]
[57:58] and you're it and here we are and you're
[58:01] living here
[58:04] you're a believer today because this
[58:06] happened amen
[58:08] and john saw it in the future it
[58:10] happened in mine in your day amen
[58:12] amen and it caused john to rejoice i
[58:15] don't know
[58:16] how you look at life but john was
[58:19] rejoicing
[58:21] john wasn't absent of problems
[58:24] john had his eyes put out he's now blind
[58:28] he's on a prison island but he's
[58:30] rejoicing
[58:32] so unless you're blind sitting on a
[58:35] roman and had your eyes
[58:37] gouged out while you were alive
[58:40] and on a prison island unless that's
[58:44] your life today you should be rejoicing
[58:48] for what christ john john got excited
[58:52] just knowing he's going to do it
[58:54] you're living in the age where he'd done
[58:56] done it
[58:59] so he's showing here in chapters 5 and
[59:02] 4.
[59:03] how he pulled it off and then he's gonna
[59:05] begin to go into six
[59:07] through the through the seven seals and
[59:09] chapter seven he's gonna catch the 144
[59:11] thousand you're gonna see a congregation
[59:13] in heaven
[59:14] there's an interval of time and and
[59:16] chapter eight is going to pick up the
[59:17] seventh seal and
[59:18] and the seven trumpets and on and on it
[59:21] goes until you find it in chapter 10
[59:23] where you now have this book which was
[59:26] closed in chapter 5 is now
[59:28] open in chapter 10 why because of
[59:31] everything you just read leading up to
[59:32] 10.
[59:34] amen this is why denominational man-made
[59:37] systems can't help you
[59:38] because they don't have the opened book
[59:41] they don't have the unsealing and what
[59:44] is what is
[59:45] the unsealing it is the mighty god
[59:48] unveiled and now we know who he is
[59:52] he we know he's he can't be found in a
[59:55] creed
[59:56] he's not a creed he can't be found in
[59:58] organized religion
[1:00:00] they booted him they gave him the
[1:00:04] left buddha fellowship
[1:00:07] amen and the only way you're going to
[1:00:11] have access to this open book is you've
[1:00:13] got to be caught up into the spiritual
[1:00:15] revelation that john caught
[1:00:17] and you've got to say amen and agree i
[1:00:20] mean there is an anointing on your life
[1:00:22] friends
[1:00:23] and this isn't in my notes but i tell
[1:00:25] you the lord's been dealing with me all
[1:00:26] morning
[1:00:27] and i i don't even i can't account i
[1:00:30] can't stand here today i told the sunday
[1:00:32] school class
[1:00:33] you know it's all about priorities
[1:00:34] letting god lead your life
[1:00:36] and sometimes you go through things in
[1:00:37] life and you say brother jason
[1:00:39] why and that's the it's the question
[1:00:41] that has plagued mankind since the
[1:00:42] garden of eden why
[1:00:44] kids start out asking why soon as you
[1:00:46] won't give them something why
[1:00:47] well something happens to him why and
[1:00:50] that's just in man's nature
[1:00:52] and so you you might have questions here
[1:00:54] today and say i'd like to know
[1:00:56] why this happened it didn't happen to
[1:00:57] her it didn't happen to him why did
[1:00:59] why god let it happen to me there are
[1:01:01] things that are happened to you
[1:01:02] and may happen yet in this life and
[1:01:05] there won't be an answer to you get on
[1:01:06] the other side but here's what i can
[1:01:08] promise you here's what i can
[1:01:10] tell you if you let him be the lord of
[1:01:12] your life
[1:01:13] it'll all come out you'll be happy you
[1:01:16] won't regret that you let him be the
[1:01:19] lord
[1:01:21] the people who gnash their teeth
[1:01:23] together in bitter anguish
[1:01:25] are the ones who wouldn't do that
[1:01:28] see and so you you find
[1:01:31] that that that while you're in your life
[1:01:35] and you're going through whatever it is
[1:01:38] you're going through and listen
[1:01:39] you're looking at a man who's been
[1:01:40] through quite a bit and i've had my
[1:01:42] share of severe hard
[1:01:45] seemed to seem like it would finish me
[1:01:48] trials
[1:01:50] multiple times i you know i i've been at
[1:01:53] this a while and
[1:01:54] and and and and i could tell stories and
[1:01:56] everybody in here could stand up and
[1:01:58] tell stories
[1:01:59] and we'd hear one story we'd go oh my
[1:02:02] and then we'd hear another one go
[1:02:04] oh my and you hear another one it's like
[1:02:06] wow
[1:02:08] but you know something i want to say
[1:02:09] this that
[1:02:11] those anointings those four living
[1:02:14] creatures
[1:02:15] i don't care what's befalling you or
[1:02:17] what may happen to you
[1:02:18] you're being anointed to say amen to it
[1:02:21] amen
[1:02:23] you're being anointed to say not my will
[1:02:26] god's will be done and it might cost you
[1:02:29] and it might
[1:02:30] hurt you and you might you might end up
[1:02:32] seemingly
[1:02:33] you know uh getting the short end of the
[1:02:35] stick and you might get the next 100
[1:02:37] short ends of sticks
[1:02:39] but i'm here to tell you there's an
[1:02:40] anointing on you that's saying
[1:02:42] say amen but lord this is hard it is but
[1:02:45] i got it say amen
[1:02:47] why do you need me to say amen because i
[1:02:49] need you to agree with my vision for
[1:02:51] your life
[1:02:53] and whatever i have called you to do i i
[1:02:55] never
[1:02:56] promised you it would be easy it wasn't
[1:02:58] easy for me
[1:03:00] but i haven't promised you it would be
[1:03:02] easy i
[1:03:03] have only promised you it will be worth
[1:03:06] it and it will amen
[1:03:11] it will it is it already is
[1:03:16] and all the things i've suffered in it
[1:03:19] baffles the devil
[1:03:21] that the more discouraging trials he
[1:03:24] sends on you the stronger your faith
[1:03:26] gets
[1:03:27] amen i mean the devil can't win for
[1:03:29] losing
[1:03:30] i mean he could actually win if it
[1:03:32] wasn't for losing
[1:03:35] i tell him that all the time you could
[1:03:36] win if you weren't losing poor guy
[1:03:40] so even things that look like you've won
[1:03:43] and you find out you just had strings on
[1:03:45] you
[1:03:45] and a ring in your nose and my father
[1:03:47] was causing you to do that me to go that
[1:03:49] way
[1:03:50] and then he was going to redeem me out
[1:03:52] and i'm still standing by him
[1:03:54] and you're still on the outside looking
[1:03:55] in you had your chance and you blew it
[1:03:57] i'm not here i'm i'm here to say amen to
[1:04:00] every word of god in my life
[1:04:04] it's the quickest way to joy we read
[1:04:06] that in in the psalms this morning that
[1:04:08] in the presence of the lord is joy
[1:04:11] there's no joy in your bank account
[1:04:13] being big
[1:04:14] or you know the finest home or the
[1:04:16] finest car the finest education the
[1:04:18] finest job in career
[1:04:20] there's no joy in that there's plenty of
[1:04:22] pleasure
[1:04:23] the the sin is pleasure that that's what
[1:04:27] the bible says they
[1:04:28] they have this the pleasure of sin for a
[1:04:30] season so there's lots of pleasures
[1:04:32] listen young people there's plenty of
[1:04:34] pleasures in ungodliness
[1:04:36] but there's no joy there there's no
[1:04:39] contentment there's no peace there's no
[1:04:41] real happiness there
[1:04:43] the only time and all you'll do is
[1:04:45] you'll chase that and chase that and
[1:04:47] chase that till you chase it into a
[1:04:48] devil's hell
[1:04:51] and when he slams your cell door shut
[1:04:53] and you'll be there bound over for trial
[1:04:55] until the great white throne judgment
[1:04:58] when you hear that door clink closed in
[1:05:00] those regions and you'll hear him going
[1:05:02] off
[1:05:02] laughing i've got another one you're
[1:05:04] going to feel like a fool
[1:05:07] that you set and heard preaching and saw
[1:05:10] the god
[1:05:10] prove his word and never would surrender
[1:05:13] and let god be the master of your whole
[1:05:15] life
[1:05:17] oh my and so we find then that there is
[1:05:22] this
[1:05:23] this whole concept of
[1:05:26] you know nothing can happen and
[1:05:30] and brother branham says john was
[1:05:32] weeping
[1:05:33] because john knew
[1:05:36] that if no one is found worthy to take
[1:05:39] the book
[1:05:40] then it's all for naught and john is
[1:05:44] saying
[1:05:44] i i mean john was at calvary john was on
[1:05:48] golgotha
[1:05:49] actually the lord spoke to him that's
[1:05:50] how close he was in earshot
[1:05:52] and john saw that you're not going to
[1:05:54] convince john he didn't didn't
[1:05:55] experience that
[1:05:57] but yet john knows as he's living and
[1:05:59] breathing and standing here right now
[1:06:00] if somebody don't take that book that
[1:06:03] trip to calvary was for nothing
[1:06:06] because that's a purchasing act but what
[1:06:08] about the claiming act
[1:06:10] if you buy something never go pick it up
[1:06:13] amen and so what good does it do you do
[1:06:16] i bought it
[1:06:17] so christ bought he paid the price once
[1:06:19] for sin
[1:06:20] and he dieth no more but there's got to
[1:06:22] be a claiming work in redemption that's
[1:06:24] redemption is always in two parts so
[1:06:26] he's got to have a purchasing time at
[1:06:28] calvary he's got to have a claiming time
[1:06:30] at the end of the ages i mean listen
[1:06:33] friends
[1:06:33] you can say well but god sent us a
[1:06:36] prophet
[1:06:38] that prophet was standing beside him
[1:06:41] and preaching and calling he's right
[1:06:43] here in the breach saying let him come
[1:06:46] and brother branham catches that
[1:06:48] and identifies himself with that strong
[1:06:50] angel he's not the mighty angel
[1:06:52] that's an error he's not the mighty
[1:06:54] angel he's a strong angel
[1:06:56] and he's standing there calling for a
[1:06:58] worthy one
[1:07:00] you say oh i got a prophet i believe a
[1:07:01] prophet but but if that book is not
[1:07:04] claimed and the seal's not broken the
[1:07:06] calvary
[1:07:07] won't work a prophet won't work nothing
[1:07:09] can save us
[1:07:11] now how much do you want to rejoice and
[1:07:13] say i'm so glad
[1:07:14] in 1963 in a little little no
[1:07:18] nothing town in a little church five or
[1:07:20] six hundred people the most epic event
[1:07:22] of history is taking place
[1:07:25] and the world looks on it as nothing and
[1:07:27] we look on it as everything
[1:07:30] it's everything
[1:07:34] there's something about the attitude of
[1:07:36] john
[1:07:38] and there's why i really want to zero in
[1:07:40] today i think that's why
[1:07:41] sister ruth's song meant so much to me
[1:07:44] because the real cry of the heart of a
[1:07:47] real believer
[1:07:48] those words were so amazing
[1:07:52] if we go back and here's where we're not
[1:07:54] going to turn in the scriptures but you
[1:07:56] just you just follow along with him i'm
[1:07:57] going to go into very familiar places
[1:07:59] things you've learned since sunday
[1:08:00] school
[1:08:02] we go back to travel to genesis 18
[1:08:06] and here you find abraham
[1:08:09] standing in the door of his tent in the
[1:08:10] cool of the day this is the evening time
[1:08:14] and you know it's the end it's
[1:08:16] representative of the end of the ages
[1:08:18] and here's going to come the king of
[1:08:19] salem again abraham had met him one time
[1:08:22] before
[1:08:22] served him communion and abraham paid
[1:08:25] him a tenth of all
[1:08:26] and uh and but now he's coming
[1:08:30] as a human being he's going to show a
[1:08:31] little bit of a difference now
[1:08:33] because now he's coming as a human being
[1:08:35] he's actually going to sit down
[1:08:36] and eat a meal he didn't do that when he
[1:08:39] came in theophany
[1:08:40] when he came his melchizedek and
[1:08:42] theophany he served abraham communion he
[1:08:44] didn't take it he didn't need anything
[1:08:45] but now he's in a human body see often
[1:08:48] he's don't eat
[1:08:49] and so now he's in a human form and he's
[1:08:51] not the he's not the begotten of the
[1:08:53] father that's coming
[1:08:55] that means born of a woman so so
[1:08:57] melchizedek is not
[1:08:59] the begotten of the father he's not born
[1:09:00] of a woman brother branham describes it
[1:09:02] how
[1:09:02] that he just took the 16 elements of the
[1:09:05] earth and
[1:09:05] calcium potash and cosmic light and
[1:09:07] balled it all up and build a body and
[1:09:09] just stepped right into it
[1:09:10] and built another body and another body
[1:09:12] and stepped messengers in
[1:09:14] one on his right and one on his left
[1:09:15] their mission is going to be to go to
[1:09:16] sodom
[1:09:17] it's going to be two messengers going to
[1:09:19] sodom but he's coming to abraham and if
[1:09:21] you'll notice
[1:09:22] when he comes to abraham abraham abraham
[1:09:25] is
[1:09:26] abraham has had the the mighty god
[1:09:29] unveiled that's what the seals are it's
[1:09:31] the unveiling of god
[1:09:33] jesus brother brahm says christ broke
[1:09:35] those seals off of himself
[1:09:37] it's not doctrine it's not theology
[1:09:41] it's an unveiling of a being
[1:09:44] that that can that can that wants to
[1:09:46] live inside you and
[1:09:48] change you amen and and literally take
[1:09:51] you off of the earth
[1:09:52] not just figuratively here but he wants
[1:09:55] to see
[1:09:55] uh revelation 4 1 fulfilled naturally
[1:09:59] when a bride goes into glory
[1:10:01] and the world don't see her again
[1:10:03] naturally until genesis
[1:10:04] i'm until revelation 19 when she comes
[1:10:07] back see
[1:10:08] but but in order to get to that natural
[1:10:10] going up
[1:10:11] you've got to have this spiritual
[1:10:13] unveiling you've got to stand yourself
[1:10:15] there and identify yourself with
[1:10:17] john and john is standing by his
[1:10:19] messenger
[1:10:20] many have walked away from the messenger
[1:10:22] thank you i'll stand right by you
[1:10:25] and i will identify myself with him and
[1:10:27] when he calls for a one to come and then
[1:10:29] i
[1:10:30] see one come and then i and he's he
[1:10:32] opens book and it becomes open
[1:10:34] and it and and john is rejoicing and the
[1:10:36] angel rejoicing and thousands and
[1:10:37] thousands are rejoicing
[1:10:39] and then i find when i get in the
[1:10:40] message i start rejoicing
[1:10:44] [Music]
[1:10:46] what caused me to love god so much the
[1:10:48] word
[1:10:51] it caused me to come out of her my
[1:10:54] people
[1:10:55] that you be not a partaker of her sins i
[1:10:58] willingly came out he didn't pull me out
[1:11:01] he called to me
[1:11:02] and i gladly came out i looked at an
[1:11:05] open book
[1:11:06] i looked at a creed and i said no that's
[1:11:07] not even a question
[1:11:09] there's no decision to make see
[1:11:12] so so if he's called to you today
[1:11:16] don't spurn mercy he's only even
[1:11:19] obligated to call you once
[1:11:21] but the fact that he's called to you
[1:11:24] obviously means he wants you
[1:11:27] he's called you to come because he wants
[1:11:29] you to come
[1:11:31] so the only decision to be made is yours
[1:11:34] because you already know his
[1:11:36] amen so there's no blaming god you
[1:11:39] already know god's intent god wants you
[1:11:41] to come out so that you don't get
[1:11:42] destroyed come into christ
[1:11:44] hallelujah so so we find
[1:11:48] that that now he's coming to abraham in
[1:11:52] a human form
[1:11:54] because he's got to have a type of
[1:11:56] what's going to come
[1:11:58] at the end time because that genesis 18
[1:12:00] that's what that's typing sodom's about
[1:12:02] to be
[1:12:03] destroyed two messengers about to go in
[1:12:05] his bible fire and brimstone rain rained
[1:12:07] on it from heaven
[1:12:08] amen so it's an end time event amen
[1:12:11] that for sodom this is this is an
[1:12:14] extinction event
[1:12:15] coming to sodom and and that you know
[1:12:18] what they're doing
[1:12:19] they're just like the days of noah
[1:12:20] they're just going about buying and
[1:12:22] selling building and
[1:12:23] marrying giving in marriage and
[1:12:24] perversions of all kind and they don't
[1:12:26] they don't all they think that life is
[1:12:28] just going to go on and go on and go on
[1:12:30] and go on and go on and go on
[1:12:31] and it and it was going to go on until
[1:12:33] it wasn't
[1:12:35] and two messengers are going to show up
[1:12:37] and lead a small party of people out of
[1:12:39] there
[1:12:40] which was a type of the foolish virgin
[1:12:42] because they will be saved they're not
[1:12:43] saved in the tribulation they're already
[1:12:45] righteous people
[1:12:46] say you want to keep that straight
[1:12:47] they're already righteous people they
[1:12:49] already have a heart for god
[1:12:50] so it's not ungodly people that's not
[1:12:52] the foolish virgin the foolish virgin
[1:12:55] are virgins and they're righteous and
[1:12:58] the bible says the king
[1:12:59] in matthew 25 the king shall say unto
[1:13:02] the righteous
[1:13:03] and then it says and the righteous shall
[1:13:04] say to the king see
[1:13:06] there there's there was people in
[1:13:08] matthew 25 that had all kinds of
[1:13:10] church works and they did all kinds of
[1:13:14] things that looked like it outstripped
[1:13:15] and outpaced
[1:13:16] the these people who are getting life
[1:13:18] and they're not getting eternal life
[1:13:20] and these people who look like they
[1:13:21] didn't weren't even as good or getting
[1:13:23] eternal life
[1:13:24] why because all of these works were done
[1:13:26] in iniquity
[1:13:27] they they were man-made and brother
[1:13:29] brown said the church is no longer his
[1:13:30] voice she's become her own
[1:13:32] voice and therefore he says he's going
[1:13:34] to confound that church with his
[1:13:36] with his prophet and uh and his bride
[1:13:39] under her prophet
[1:13:40] under her messenger will be the final
[1:13:42] voice to the final age amen
[1:13:44] this is how it's all playing out you
[1:13:46] can't make this stuff up friends
[1:13:47] it you can't make it hit like that this
[1:13:50] thing just
[1:13:51] it just just purrs this engine just
[1:13:53] purrs all
[1:13:54] everything is hitting exactly how it's
[1:13:56] supposed to hit
[1:13:57] and it agrees with every type there
[1:14:00] that's where abraham is in the evening
[1:14:01] time and that's when the mighty god is
[1:14:03] unveiled
[1:14:05] and what's the sign that he sees he sees
[1:14:08] god
[1:14:09] operating through a man and and then
[1:14:13] at the time when sodom's ready to be
[1:14:14] destroyed and then what do you know
[1:14:16] here we come to the time when sodom's
[1:14:18] ready to be destroyed and a prophet is
[1:14:20] standing on the scene
[1:14:21] and he says now notice he sat in the
[1:14:24] tent with his back to the tent
[1:14:26] and sarah in a tent behind him and he he
[1:14:28] gives forth the prophecy
[1:14:30] and sarah lab brother brandon said she
[1:14:32] kind of in
[1:14:33] kentucky english she laughed up her
[1:14:35] sleeve it's an old colloquialism that we
[1:14:37] say she laughed up her sleeve
[1:14:38] man she didn't think nobody would hear
[1:14:40] that and he says why did sarah left
[1:14:43] she immediately i didn't laugh oh
[1:14:46] you did for you said in your heart it
[1:14:50] might never come across your lips
[1:14:52] but your attitude toward my promise
[1:14:55] we got a problem your attitude toward my
[1:14:58] word this is causing a problem
[1:15:00] and at that point sarah would have had
[1:15:02] no way
[1:15:04] to e no way to stay alive
[1:15:09] just like eve eve had no chance to live
[1:15:12] god would have burned her with the
[1:15:13] serpent
[1:15:15] amen but eve
[1:15:19] sarah you and me
[1:15:22] you know why god couldn't touch her
[1:15:24] because she was part of abraham
[1:15:26] abraham had already taken her christ has
[1:15:28] already taken you
[1:15:30] and yes i fail and yes you fail but he
[1:15:33] can't hurt me because i'm in christ
[1:15:36] he can't kick me out because i'm in him
[1:15:38] hallelujah
[1:15:39] there's only one elected son and that's
[1:15:41] christ and i'm in him
[1:15:43] hallelujah and so we find that's why
[1:15:45] brother brown will say it's not the man
[1:15:47] that comes elected it's the seed that's
[1:15:49] inside the man
[1:15:50] i'm here to tell you something friends
[1:15:51] you want to have something to rejoice
[1:15:53] over
[1:15:53] rejoice over this that you weren't smart
[1:15:55] enough to find god but god found you
[1:15:58] and you were too thick and dumb to
[1:16:00] accept him but god has accepted you
[1:16:03] and jesus said you haven't even chosen
[1:16:05] me like you think
[1:16:06] i chose you and i've called you for a
[1:16:11] purpose
[1:16:13] that that negates and invalidates
[1:16:17] any mistake satan has ever caused
[1:16:20] in your life i don't care if the mistake
[1:16:24] was 30 minutes ago it is invalid when it
[1:16:26] goes into the blood of the lord jesus
[1:16:28] christ
[1:16:30] any charge against god's family is
[1:16:33] illegitimate
[1:16:34] after the seals are opened amen because
[1:16:37] we're in christ
[1:16:39] there's no way calvary
[1:16:42] in matthew 27 and matthew 28
[1:16:45] and the events of revelation 4 and 5
[1:16:48] invalidate
[1:16:49] any charge against god's family and
[1:16:52] that's why paul could say
[1:16:54] that that there is now therefore no
[1:16:57] condemnation to them which are in christ
[1:17:00] jesus
[1:17:02] and so we find that here
[1:17:06] abraham i'm watching my time carefully
[1:17:10] here he's coming to abraham and
[1:17:14] and he's and why did sarah laugh i
[1:17:15] didn't you did for this what you said in
[1:17:17] your heart and he heard words she never
[1:17:18] uttered
[1:17:20] but she's in abraham so she's protected
[1:17:23] it's like eve
[1:17:24] adam took eve quickly because he knew
[1:17:25] god would destroy her
[1:17:27] and so quickly he knew god couldn't
[1:17:28] destroy him because he was the son of
[1:17:30] god
[1:17:31] the bible doesn't even call him a son of
[1:17:33] god it caused him the son of god
[1:17:35] so he's the first adam and and and and
[1:17:38] when his
[1:17:39] when his bride fell into sin he stepped
[1:17:42] into sin to redeemer the problem with
[1:17:44] adam was he was immortal
[1:17:45] and he couldn't he tried to get back out
[1:17:47] he couldn't get out himself
[1:17:49] so you were off in the ditch and then he
[1:17:51] brought his big four by
[1:17:52] off in the ditch to get you out and both
[1:17:54] of you got stuck
[1:17:56] so the beauty of the second adam is is
[1:17:58] that he had power over death
[1:18:01] and hell and the grave and when he
[1:18:04] stepped into sin and he did he took your
[1:18:07] sin
[1:18:07] and god condemned him and judged him as
[1:18:09] a sinner and sent him to hell but david
[1:18:11] said hell can hold him the great
[1:18:13] couldn't hold him hallelujah
[1:18:15] oh my because he's all power in heaven
[1:18:18] and earth he ascended up out of there
[1:18:19] broke the seal
[1:18:20] of the tomb in matthew 28. death could
[1:18:24] not
[1:18:24] hold him and as soon as he got out of
[1:18:27] the tomb he reached back in and starts
[1:18:29] pulling his bride out with him
[1:18:30] he's been pulling him out ever since did
[1:18:32] he pull you out has he pulled you out
[1:18:34] today say i remember the day
[1:18:36] when he pulled me out hallelujah oh my
[1:18:40] send it up on high gave gifts unto men
[1:18:43] sent his spirit back into the church
[1:18:48] so we find that that he
[1:18:51] he comes to abraham now i want you to
[1:18:53] see this same correlation that you see
[1:18:55] in john you're seeing in abraham
[1:18:57] who's the father of the faith because
[1:19:01] there's there's a uh just just like you
[1:19:04] and i
[1:19:05] we read in the book of revelation
[1:19:08] about the plagues coming upon the earth
[1:19:11] and
[1:19:11] it's nothing but doom and gloom i mean
[1:19:14] it's morbid it's
[1:19:15] it's ominous it gives you cold chills
[1:19:18] say goodness
[1:19:19] i don't want to even be anywhere near
[1:19:21] when that happens believe me you don't
[1:19:23] they aren't going to go through a
[1:19:24] tribulation like she's never known
[1:19:26] mankind
[1:19:27] for his rejection of the lord is going
[1:19:29] to have to uh he he chose his master and
[1:19:32] there you go that's the choice he made
[1:19:34] brother braham said that's what you
[1:19:35] wanted that's what god gave you so now
[1:19:36] it's going to do with it
[1:19:38] you wanted a denomination you you wanted
[1:19:40] a crooked
[1:19:41] politics you wanted a crooked church you
[1:19:43] wanted a false pastor
[1:19:45] you wanted somebody with itching ears
[1:19:46] that would let you do whatever and
[1:19:48] brother branham said god just gave you
[1:19:49] the desire of your heart
[1:19:51] you can't blame god your brother said
[1:19:53] okay there you go there you go
[1:19:54] there you go pentecost there you go your
[1:19:57] assemblies
[1:19:58] you won this you pc there you go
[1:20:01] god sends a message you didn't want that
[1:20:04] you wanted a system of man she could
[1:20:06] rule over one another and draw lines and
[1:20:08] put people in and out and live any old
[1:20:10] way said okay fine there you go that's
[1:20:12] what you wanted that's what god gave you
[1:20:13] now what you're going to do with it
[1:20:14] you're headed into a tribulation
[1:20:18] i tell you what nothing doing for me i'm
[1:20:21] running to christ
[1:20:22] when i heard the words come out of her
[1:20:23] my people you don't have to ask me twice
[1:20:25] i'm out
[1:20:26] hallelujah when i come out of something
[1:20:28] i'm going into something
[1:20:30] i come out of that to go into him
[1:20:31] hallelujah
[1:20:33] amen i want nothing to do with this
[1:20:35] sinful world i can't stand this sinful
[1:20:37] world it's
[1:20:38] it's it's i it's not native to me
[1:20:40] anymore
[1:20:41] holiness is native to me hallelujah
[1:20:43] righteousness is native to me uh
[1:20:46] godliness that's my intrinsic my every
[1:20:49] every fiber of my inside
[1:20:51] i i i loathe the ungodliness perversion
[1:20:54] that i have to rub
[1:20:55] shoulders with say well why are you a
[1:20:58] preacher
[1:20:59] because i why do you deal with it why do
[1:21:01] you keep going into the heads in the
[1:21:02] highways because i know god still got
[1:21:04] some names on that book
[1:21:06] i don't know who they are but i'm just
[1:21:07] broadcasting the seed everywhere
[1:21:09] god will find his people that's what
[1:21:11] jesus told those fishermen
[1:21:13] i'll make you fishers of men and you'll
[1:21:15] go and you'll bring in all kinds every
[1:21:16] kind bring in all kinds i'll separate
[1:21:18] them later
[1:21:20] i'll sort them out later hallelujah
[1:21:23] that's what he's done that's what he's
[1:21:24] doing
[1:21:26] and so we find that here you are at the
[1:21:28] end time again
[1:21:29] end time end time genesis 18 revelation
[1:21:33] chapter
[1:21:34] 4 5 and after that the tribulation
[1:21:36] starts setting in
[1:21:37] and here genesis 18 you're at an end
[1:21:39] time for sodom we're at an end time for
[1:21:41] sodom
[1:21:42] amen and the messengers head on down
[1:21:47] and now god's got a secret but i want
[1:21:50] you to notice the heart of abraham
[1:21:52] now we're talking about where is your
[1:21:54] heart where's your relationship
[1:21:56] with god because abraham is so
[1:21:59] amazing in his relationship to god
[1:22:03] that when he when he hears the story
[1:22:07] when god un unlocks the seal and tells
[1:22:10] him
[1:22:11] what i'm about to go do and and bro
[1:22:14] draws him in catches him up into a
[1:22:17] revelation i'm about to destroy this
[1:22:19] place
[1:22:20] and he's he's realizing wait a minute
[1:22:22] there's good people down there
[1:22:24] and so he he's coming you you read the
[1:22:27] story and he's coming in genesis 18
[1:22:29] and he's coming and he's saying lord
[1:22:33] will you destroy the righteous
[1:22:38] will you will you destroy the righteous
[1:22:40] with the wicked
[1:22:42] that be far from thee now i want you to
[1:22:45] really catch this friend abraham is not
[1:22:48] and he says not be far from the
[1:22:50] abraham's not not berating god
[1:22:52] he's not trying to browbeat him he's not
[1:22:54] trying to you know
[1:22:55] you know shame on you that'd be far how
[1:22:57] dare you you'll never do something like
[1:22:58] that
[1:22:59] that's not his attitude you have to
[1:23:01] understand this is the man
[1:23:03] who had become the friend of god and god
[1:23:06] even testifies
[1:23:07] can i hide anything from abraham oh
[1:23:10] there was no secrets he he to his friend
[1:23:13] that's why jesus said i've called your
[1:23:15] friends he
[1:23:15] he said i reveal my secrets to you
[1:23:18] because you're my friends how many like
[1:23:20] being the friend of god
[1:23:22] oh my this is a this is a love affair
[1:23:25] abraham loves this man this man
[1:23:27] loves abraham this is his god
[1:23:30] this isn't a man born of a woman this is
[1:23:32] jehovah this is
[1:23:33] elohim amen
[1:23:36] and abraham comes with this knowledge
[1:23:40] because he knows this god
[1:23:43] he he he's saying lord i know you
[1:23:48] you would never oh no no no no no
[1:23:52] no destroy the righteous with the wicked
[1:23:54] i know that's what it looks like
[1:23:55] i know you lord you can't fool me
[1:23:59] i know you i've learned you i've grown
[1:24:03] we've grown close
[1:24:04] you would never do a thing like that
[1:24:08] now abraham didn't start out with that
[1:24:11] kind of insight
[1:24:12] abraham had to learn that through trial
[1:24:14] and error
[1:24:16] abraham had i know hebrews 11 is the
[1:24:20] the book of champions i know it's the
[1:24:22] hall of fame
[1:24:23] and in there abraham is spotless never
[1:24:25] doubted never wavered never
[1:24:27] never disbelieved god but but i can read
[1:24:30] in genesis before calvary
[1:24:32] which took all that away i can read
[1:24:33] before calvary did that
[1:24:36] that abraham backslid left the promised
[1:24:38] land
[1:24:39] brother bram said any time of julie's
[1:24:40] promised land he's backslid goes down
[1:24:42] into egypt
[1:24:43] lion cheating can ivan almost gets
[1:24:44] himself killed almost loses his wife
[1:24:48] ends up a complete criminal and liar
[1:24:51] ends up leaving rich
[1:24:52] okay that's just god
[1:24:56] spoils the whole nation to protect his
[1:24:59] son
[1:25:00] and abraham leaves with great wealth and
[1:25:03] and you know what he does
[1:25:04] then later on you think oh i'm sure
[1:25:06] abraham will never do that again boy he
[1:25:08] learned a hard lesson
[1:25:09] boy that was close he'll like to lost
[1:25:10] sarah until he gets over and gets in a
[1:25:13] jam again
[1:25:14] oh it's fine let me tell you something
[1:25:16] you can serve god
[1:25:17] all you want in your own willpower but
[1:25:20] you'll come up on a trial where you
[1:25:22] won't
[1:25:24] you'll come up on a trial friends that
[1:25:26] that ticking time bomb of that little
[1:25:28] fallen nature that's still down in you
[1:25:30] that the only way you get rid of that is
[1:25:32] a new birth by the holy ghost
[1:25:34] so i'm a christian while you are now
[1:25:37] let's see let's see a few more turns of
[1:25:39] the moon might what it might do to you
[1:25:41] we've we've had people before who we
[1:25:43] thought we've had ministers
[1:25:44] who we thought before were solid come to
[1:25:47] find out wow they never even had the
[1:25:48] thing they claimed
[1:25:50] they never even were born again at
[1:25:53] say that's how you're going to judge
[1:25:55] them i'm not the bible
[1:25:57] says that nobody's speaking by the
[1:25:59] spirit of christ caught
[1:26:00] nobody's speaking by the holy ghost
[1:26:02] calleth jesus accursed
[1:26:04] because the holy ghost can't deny his
[1:26:06] own word
[1:26:08] you can't come against the word and say
[1:26:10] i'm anointed of christ
[1:26:12] to be against his word because nobody
[1:26:15] speaking by the holy ghost
[1:26:16] calleth jesus accursed you understand
[1:26:20] so it's obvious it becomes evident that
[1:26:23] they never had the experience they
[1:26:25] claimed they had
[1:26:26] maybe it's still open to them thank
[1:26:28] goodness i'm not the judge i don't want
[1:26:29] to be an arbiter of stuff like that
[1:26:31] i i'm just here to keep spreading the
[1:26:33] seed keep spreading the seed
[1:26:35] keep spreading the seed how about we
[1:26:36] have a how about we have a heart like
[1:26:38] abraham how about that bethel tabernacle
[1:26:41] how about we have a heart like abraham
[1:26:42] says lord
[1:26:43] but if there's 50
[1:26:47] i'll spare it what about 40
[1:26:51] i know you're pretty good i'll spare it
[1:26:54] 30
[1:26:54] yep 20 yep
[1:26:58] okay nobody else would have the guts to
[1:27:01] do what i'm about to do
[1:27:02] but a bride who knows her husband really
[1:27:05] well knows how far she can push it
[1:27:10] what about 10 abraham
[1:27:14] i i wouldn't even tell anybody else what
[1:27:16] i'm going to do but you
[1:27:18] i wouldn't even have this kind of
[1:27:19] conversation but
[1:27:21] me and you are tight abraham i know your
[1:27:24] heart for me
[1:27:25] because i can see inside it oh my oh
[1:27:28] you'll never
[1:27:29] doubt my word abraham you'll always
[1:27:31] believe me and i'll tell you something
[1:27:32] friends he was there to confirm the son
[1:27:34] hallelujah they had to have a body
[1:27:36] change you'll never see the lord
[1:27:38] in the air without a body change
[1:27:41] hallelujah you've got to have a body
[1:27:43] change just like abraham and sarah
[1:27:45] and what it say what's the message doing
[1:27:47] to me right now it's confirming the
[1:27:49] covenant
[1:27:50] the covenant was made in here jesus made
[1:27:52] the covenant to you in the scripture
[1:27:54] he that believeth on me has passed from
[1:27:56] death into life and shall never come
[1:27:58] into the judgment
[1:27:58] that's a promise he's here in this last
[1:28:01] day to confirm that to you
[1:28:03] and he sent the sign of melchizedek with
[1:28:05] a prophet who could discern the very
[1:28:07] secrets of people's hearts who were
[1:28:09] behind him
[1:28:11] come on friends let us not be thick
[1:28:13] let's realize what god has done in this
[1:28:15] hour
[1:28:16] let's have a heart like john let's
[1:28:17] rejoice for what god has done
[1:28:20] amen abraham
[1:28:23] with that heart and and god is saying
[1:28:26] yeah i won't do it you know
[1:28:28] what what abraham is praying because
[1:28:32] you can't you should never pray contrary
[1:28:35] to god's will
[1:28:39] the apostle teaches you that that's why
[1:28:41] you don't get your prayers answered
[1:28:43] because you pray asking amidst that you
[1:28:44] just want to reap something upon
[1:28:46] your own desires and lust it says but
[1:28:49] when you pray
[1:28:50] you are to pray according to the word
[1:28:53] see when when israel
[1:28:55] went into 70 years captivity god's word
[1:28:57] said you'll be there 70 years
[1:28:59] they didn't want to do that i mean who
[1:29:01] would
[1:29:02] gonna be here 70 years are you kidding
[1:29:04] i'll grow old and die here
[1:29:06] and and another prophet comes by with a
[1:29:09] false message gave everybody a lot of
[1:29:11] false hope not two years lord told me
[1:29:12] two years
[1:29:13] everybody's rejoicing jeremiah says well
[1:29:18] all i know is what god told me and then
[1:29:21] he goes home that day
[1:29:22] god comes to him in the evening says now
[1:29:24] tomorrow you go you find that guy again
[1:29:26] and you tell him to prove it that that
[1:29:29] you're the prophet jeremiah not him
[1:29:31] to prove it tell him in front of
[1:29:33] everybody you're going to die within a
[1:29:35] year
[1:29:37] guess how long that man lived not a year
[1:29:43] guess how long israel was in captivity
[1:29:46] 70 years
[1:29:48] you know why so so so when they prayed
[1:29:52] you go into the into the scripture when
[1:29:54] they prayed they had to
[1:29:56] they had to change their prayers to pray
[1:29:59] according to his decision
[1:30:02] you can't pray and ask god for things
[1:30:04] that aren't his will for your life
[1:30:07] you understand that you're you're never
[1:30:09] going to get god to move in that kind of
[1:30:11] a way
[1:30:11] you you say well i got a situation
[1:30:14] brother jason i don't even know
[1:30:15] i i look in the word i can't discern and
[1:30:17] i don't even know what his will is well
[1:30:20] well then fall back on the on the fails
[1:30:22] on the failsafe
[1:30:24] be like jesus and just say not my will
[1:30:26] thine be done
[1:30:28] hallelujah amen
[1:30:31] but it's the heart of abraham that i'm
[1:30:33] emphasizing because
[1:30:35] that's how john felt john was standing
[1:30:37] there
[1:30:38] and he's weeping and he's broken-hearted
[1:30:40] because this
[1:30:41] is over and everybody's going to be
[1:30:43] destroyed and nobody yeah i got a
[1:30:45] prophet
[1:30:45] you know calling for it but now we
[1:30:48] looked everywhere we've looked above
[1:30:49] heaven through heaven bleep below heaven
[1:30:51] under everywhere we can't find it we
[1:30:52] turned over every stone there's nobody
[1:30:54] worthy
[1:30:56] and yeah well let's let's just not use a
[1:30:58] man no you have to use a man
[1:31:00] why because he's a human what does that
[1:31:02] got to do with it well you're a human
[1:31:04] so the only way a redeemer can be a
[1:31:06] redeemer's got to be kin to you
[1:31:08] so uh there's there's no way a bull
[1:31:11] or a lamb or a dove his life can't come
[1:31:15] on you he's not
[1:31:16] kin he's not human you've got to have a
[1:31:18] redeemer that's kin to you
[1:31:20] it's got to be a human being and there
[1:31:22] isn't anybody
[1:31:24] until god become a man hallelujah
[1:31:27] he didn't just build a body and step in
[1:31:29] it he came upon a virgin
[1:31:31] and spoke his word and she believed it
[1:31:33] and god created in her
[1:31:35] a human male hallelujah and she and as
[1:31:39] an incubator
[1:31:40] but literally so so human god built his
[1:31:44] body out of the elements of the cursed
[1:31:46] earth
[1:31:46] and brother brown talks about the
[1:31:48] potatoes marian the the calcium and the
[1:31:50] things that
[1:31:51] you know the carrots and different
[1:31:52] things and travel through the placenta
[1:31:54] and into the child and
[1:31:56] and it pushes out arms and pushes out
[1:31:57] fingers and pushes out a nose and
[1:31:59] and starts to develop and this is a man
[1:32:02] and he's born a baby and he has to grow
[1:32:06] and he's gotta
[1:32:07] he's like you know just like abraham
[1:32:09] like like jesus
[1:32:10] abraham had to grow to learn how to be
[1:32:14] god's friend gee the bible says the
[1:32:17] child speaking of jesus the child
[1:32:19] had to submit himself to his earthly
[1:32:21] parents and the bible says he grew
[1:32:23] in wisdom that's why that's why
[1:32:27] the the apostle would say that jesus
[1:32:30] learned obedience he learned obedience
[1:32:32] by the things he
[1:32:33] suffered don't don't go after god in
[1:32:36] anger because of your life
[1:32:37] let if you don't like your life let god
[1:32:40] change it
[1:32:41] let god make it beautiful i don't the
[1:32:43] circumstances don't have to change you
[1:32:45] can be
[1:32:46] in one circumstance and not born again
[1:32:49] and hating your life
[1:32:51] the next moment you can be in the
[1:32:53] identical same circumstance
[1:32:54] but born again and you'll raise a hand
[1:32:56] and say glory to god glory to god glory
[1:32:59] to god
[1:33:00] circumstances mean nothing to you the
[1:33:02] only thing that matters is he opened the
[1:33:04] book

[1:33:07] i'm rejoicing hallelujah
[1:33:11] amen it's all about your willingness
[1:33:14] david peter said to the only day of
[1:33:16] pentecost
[1:33:17] you you destroyed him the prince of life
[1:33:20] but i'm here to tell you that god catch
[1:33:22] these words
[1:33:23] god hath made him both lord and christ
[1:33:28] so there had to be a growing there had
[1:33:30] to be a development
[1:33:32] developing into that he didn't come as a
[1:33:34] baby and ready for calvary
[1:33:37] he's not going to get baptized by john
[1:33:39] and go straight to calvary
[1:33:41] before he goes to calvary's got to go to
[1:33:42] the wilderness oh my
[1:33:44] well we all want to be in a rapture
[1:33:46] yesterday but i'm going to tell you
[1:33:47] something friends we still got some
[1:33:48] learning
[1:33:48] we've still got some growing we still
[1:33:50] got some finding we still got some
[1:33:51] preaching
[1:33:52] you need to say a few more amens there
[1:33:55] needs to be a few more prayers go up
[1:33:57] there needs to be a few more baptisms
[1:33:59] and hallelujah we're baptizing them
[1:34:00] around the world
[1:34:02] for everyone that jumps out we baptize
[1:34:05] 20. there you go

[1:34:10] 50 more
[1:34:12] hallelujah this is the lord's doing
[1:34:14] glory to god
[1:34:16] oh my you're not going to stop it i'm
[1:34:18] here to tell you something friends take
[1:34:19] some advice from me
[1:34:21] if god is determined to do something in
[1:34:23] you with you
[1:34:24] through you in you you're not going to
[1:34:27] stop him
[1:34:29] if he's determined to do something
[1:34:31] you're not gonna stop it
[1:34:33] and i'm here to tell you on the flip
[1:34:34] side if he's determined something ain't
[1:34:36] gonna happen
[1:34:37] bring all the king's horses and all the
[1:34:39] king's men you want you're not gonna
[1:34:41] make it happen
[1:34:43] you ought to be glad and you ought to
[1:34:45] rejoice because one who knows the end
[1:34:47] from the beginning
[1:34:48] is the lord and master over all my life
[1:34:52] it's that heart that john had it's that
[1:34:56] heart
[1:34:56] that abraham had it's that heart that
[1:34:58] esther had when she comes
[1:35:00] there in in esther 4.
[1:35:04] and here here you go end of the world
[1:35:08] the jews are all going to be slaughtered
[1:35:09] for the jews it's an extinction event
[1:35:12] just like sodom just like tribulation
[1:35:15] now the jews are done for how this
[1:35:17] happened the conniving
[1:35:19] haman who represents the devil
[1:35:22] well how in the world well who who gave
[1:35:24] him the death sentence the king
[1:35:27] wait what i thought the king was god
[1:35:29] represented god he does
[1:35:31] oh whoa well then how'd the king get
[1:35:33] tricked into
[1:35:35] giving a death sentence to the jews just
[1:35:38] like paul
[1:35:39] paul says i mean that wasn't the king
[1:35:41] wasn't intending to kill esther and all
[1:35:43] her people
[1:35:45] through trickery yeah through conniving
[1:35:49] go into the book of romans and paul says
[1:35:52] now i found out here's something i found
[1:35:54] out
[1:35:55] that the law was good the law is not bad
[1:35:58] problems me i can't keep it there's
[1:36:01] nothing wrong with the law the law came
[1:36:03] to give life that's why it came the law
[1:36:06] was given
[1:36:08] to to help you to guide you through life
[1:36:11] but but
[1:36:11] paul says but satan now taking the
[1:36:14] commandment
[1:36:16] that's all well and fine it's great news
[1:36:19] but the problem is i've got a fallen
[1:36:22] condition
[1:36:23] i'm born wrong so now satan uses the law
[1:36:27] which was
[1:36:28] for my good and he turns it in a in a
[1:36:31] in a in a crafty move
[1:36:34] he turns it against me and now it
[1:36:36] becomes my death sentence because i
[1:36:38] can't keep it
[1:36:39] and even if i could i still wouldn't
[1:36:41] escape death because i'm born in death
[1:36:44] you see so you you can see haman
[1:36:47] moving there so it's god letting it
[1:36:48] happen it's that's how god
[1:36:51] set up redemption that that you came
[1:36:54] that's why brother branham would say
[1:36:56] this is an astounding statement
[1:36:58] you ought to see the times i've preached
[1:37:00] funerals and i was preaching to
[1:37:01] somebody who wasn't even a christian at
[1:37:03] all and i'm trying to give the family
[1:37:05] some kind of hope and
[1:37:06] and man and and oftentimes i use that
[1:37:08] wonderful saying brother eddie said
[1:37:10] years ago well
[1:37:11] they'll get a fair trial i can promise
[1:37:12] you that every man will get a fair trial
[1:37:15] but i but here's another comfort that i
[1:37:17] can give him i can say and this
[1:37:19] on the authority of a prophet god will
[1:37:20] never condemn a man for being a sinner
[1:37:23] man i was born a sinner he didn't he
[1:37:26] didn't volunteer
[1:37:27] bible says he was subjected to it we
[1:37:29] didn't volunteer to come like this
[1:37:31] we were subjected to it it's all part of
[1:37:33] god's plan of redemption
[1:37:35] you understand so brother brown says god
[1:37:36] will never condemn a man for being a
[1:37:37] sinner
[1:37:38] it's not his fault he was born a sinner
[1:37:40] he had nothing to do with it
[1:37:42] he i wasn't there when adam and eve did
[1:37:44] that
[1:37:45] you understand i there was no way for me
[1:37:48] to get here outside of a union between
[1:37:50] my mom and dad
[1:37:51] and though and though the bed was
[1:37:53] undefiled and the marriage union is
[1:37:54] blessed of god i still get born
[1:37:56] sinful because that's coming the wrong
[1:37:58] way
[1:38:00] i'm coming by that tree of knowledge of
[1:38:01] good and evil you understand
[1:38:04] and so so god's not going to condemn me
[1:38:07] for that
[1:38:08] brother brandon says what will condemn
[1:38:10] the man is that he remained a sinner
[1:38:13] when he didn't have to that christ
[1:38:16] that day on calvary provided a way that
[1:38:19] a man can escape that and if he don't
[1:38:20] take it
[1:38:21] then it's not god condemning him he's
[1:38:23] condemning himself
[1:38:25] god never brings judgment without first
[1:38:27] offering mercy
[1:38:29] hallelujah thank god so when it comes
[1:38:32] down to it when the
[1:38:33] when the spirit of god knocks on your
[1:38:35] heart my goodness throw up both hands
[1:38:37] and
[1:38:37] say i surrender lord i surrender all
[1:38:40] take me i'm yours take me this day
[1:38:43] i might make other mistakes but i'm
[1:38:44] still his
[1:38:46] i've passed from death unto life
[1:38:50] here's esther at the end of the world
[1:38:53] this is a terrible thing
[1:38:55] this haman this wicked haman he's going
[1:38:57] to bring about their destruction
[1:39:00] and mordecai comes to esther i'm going
[1:39:02] to close with this one
[1:39:04] mordecai comes to esther you have to go
[1:39:06] in to see the king
[1:39:08] why me you're the queen there's no one
[1:39:12] else
[1:39:13] qualified there's no one else qualified
[1:39:16] i can't do it there's no one else it's
[1:39:19] not anybody's role but yours
[1:39:21] but i but i haven't been summoned esther
[1:39:24] you're going to have to realize
[1:39:25] something
[1:39:26] but as the queen you don't always have
[1:39:28] to wait
[1:39:29] for the call you already know he loves
[1:39:32] you
[1:39:33] you already know esther here's what
[1:39:35] you're gonna find out esther
[1:39:37] you can enter boldly into the throne you
[1:39:40] can enter boldly and bring your
[1:39:42] your your petitions to god that's the
[1:39:44] provision that calvary gave you as god's
[1:39:46] bride
[1:39:48] paul says that inner boldly it's what
[1:39:50] mordecai's saying go in
[1:39:52] and she says oh my she says i'll go she
[1:39:56] says
[1:39:57] tell all israel tell all the jews tell
[1:39:59] everybody
[1:40:00] to fast and pray for me for three days
[1:40:02] and i'll
[1:40:03] i and my maidens will all fast and pray
[1:40:06] and i'll go to see the king
[1:40:08] and if i if i perish i perish but i'm
[1:40:11] going to see the king
[1:40:13] she's the only one now it's it's by
[1:40:16] design
[1:40:16] god has designed it listen friends we
[1:40:20] we would love for jesus just to come
[1:40:22] down and prove himself to the whole
[1:40:25] world again though he did it and it
[1:40:26] didn't work then it won't work now
[1:40:28] he's looking to prove himself through
[1:40:30] you
[1:40:32] you and and she says i can't do it and
[1:40:33] mordechai says how do you know esther
[1:40:36] but what you've been called
[1:40:37] you've been born you've been brought to
[1:40:39] here for such a time as this
[1:40:42] listen friends i don't know why how you
[1:40:44] became a believer i don't know the trail
[1:40:45] of your life i don't know the miseries
[1:40:47] you've been through
[1:40:47] i don't know the battles you're facing
[1:40:49] right now but how do you know say
[1:40:51] my life's so unfair how do you know that
[1:40:53] god has got you in that spot
[1:40:55] so that you can then be a witness to
[1:40:57] somebody in that same spot
[1:40:59] i don't know i can't explain your whole
[1:41:00] life i can't explain mine
[1:41:03] i've asked god many times lord why'd you
[1:41:05] let that happen it caused such a problem
[1:41:06] i've had such a weakness
[1:41:07] why'd you let that happen why'd you let
[1:41:09] this happen and god is just saying my
[1:41:11] grace is sufficient for you
[1:41:12] just keep walking just keep trusting
[1:41:15] just keep feeding i got this i got you i
[1:41:17] got it all
[1:41:21] she steps into the throne room and
[1:41:22] immediately the law of god the
[1:41:24] law of god said she's got to die
[1:41:28] because there's no way that you can come
[1:41:30] into the presence
[1:41:32] of god a sinful creature without a body
[1:41:35] change i can never go into its presence
[1:41:37] without a body change
[1:41:39] see because he's a holy god and i've got
[1:41:42] a sinful body
[1:41:44] and i can't take it into his presence
[1:41:48] there had to be somebody stepped between
[1:41:51] me
[1:41:52] and that god on the throne there you are
[1:41:55] in revelation 4 revelation 5
[1:41:57] there was no way john was finished it
[1:41:59] was all done it didn't matter what he
[1:42:00] done from
[1:42:01] what he ever had done or what he would
[1:42:02] do from there on
[1:42:04] but somebody stepped and came in between
[1:42:07] him
[1:42:08] and the one seated on the throne took
[1:42:09] the book out of his hand
[1:42:11] and opened it and john broke into
[1:42:14] revival the whole angels and ten
[1:42:16] thousand times ten thousand and
[1:42:18] thousands of thousands
[1:42:20] are breaking into revival and the four
[1:42:22] living creatures are screaming amen to
[1:42:24] the whole
[1:42:25] the to the whole thing and and and it's
[1:42:27] because that's somebody and see when
[1:42:29] esther comes
[1:42:30] that she there's no way she can come
[1:42:32] into his presence like that
[1:42:33] and and so unless the king reaches forth
[1:42:36] his scepter
[1:42:38] because the scepter now is going to be
[1:42:39] between him and her amen you understand
[1:42:42] that's christ that's the redeemer that's
[1:42:43] the lamb
[1:42:44] hallelujah that's abraham
[1:42:48] abraham was portraying christ to
[1:42:50] melchizedek
[1:42:51] abraham is a redeemer he's trying to
[1:42:54] redeem me that he's got family down
[1:42:56] there he's got loved ones down there
[1:42:58] he's he's a goal boaz was the redeemer
[1:43:01] to redeem naomi and ruth
[1:43:03] you understand the scepter is a redeemer
[1:43:05] the lamb was a redeemer
[1:43:07] something that could come between the
[1:43:08] sentence of death
[1:43:10] and a needy person
[1:43:13] but you know what just because he
[1:43:17] extended it
[1:43:18] they didn't kill her but there's no
[1:43:20] conversation yet
[1:43:22] there's nothing being granted yet you
[1:43:23] know why she's got to
[1:43:25] go forward the bible says she put on her
[1:43:29] royal apparel
[1:43:31] you wouldn't even have that friends you
[1:43:33] wouldn't even have royal apparel to go
[1:43:36] into the presence of the king
[1:43:37] you you couldn't even go in and
[1:43:40] intercede for your children
[1:43:41] if you didn't have the royal apparel you
[1:43:44] couldn't go in and intercede for your
[1:43:45] family and your loved ones
[1:43:47] if you hadn't dressed yourself in the
[1:43:48] royal apparel of god's word
[1:43:51] oh could we rejoice today bethel
[1:43:53] tabernacle
[1:43:54] this is this isn't god sent us a message
[1:43:56] and a prophet we got 1200 tapes and
[1:43:58] we've gotten a bunch of books and
[1:44:00] we say god's in a private it's so that's
[1:44:02] so shallow that's so
[1:44:04] that's just the initiation of it all
[1:44:06] hallelujah this is god
[1:44:08] revealing himself you're caught up in an
[1:44:10] epic moment in history the end of all
[1:44:12] time and you're a main player
[1:44:15] how because you've like esther you've
[1:44:17] got you've you've robbed yourself
[1:44:19] in the garments of his word and now you
[1:44:21] can pray according to his will because
[1:44:23] the bride
[1:44:23] knows what she wants done she knows what
[1:44:27] he wants done
[1:44:28] with his word siesta knew he didn't want
[1:44:30] to kill her
[1:44:32] esther knew he didn't want to kill all
[1:44:34] the jews esther knew this was a trick
[1:44:36] that that evil haman had pulled it off
[1:44:39] he'd he had used the
[1:44:40] the king's love against her
[1:44:43] she comes now she's got to walk forward
[1:44:46] and she's got a layer hand the bible
[1:44:48] says she touched with her finger the tip
[1:44:51] every eastern monarch with his with his
[1:44:54] scepter
[1:44:55] it has a a crown jewel some type of head
[1:44:58] upon it
[1:44:59] if you see any type of eastern
[1:45:01] monarchist his scepter has a
[1:45:03] has a head on top and has a crowned head
[1:45:05] on top
[1:45:06] and when he extends that to her she's
[1:45:09] got to
[1:45:09] lay her hand that's that's like when the
[1:45:12] jews brought their lamb
[1:45:14] to to the priest to offer him the man
[1:45:17] had to lay his hand on the head of the
[1:45:19] lamb
[1:45:20] he had to identify with the sacrifice
[1:45:23] she has to come up
[1:45:24] it's not just offering it thank god i'm
[1:45:25] free no she's got to go forward
[1:45:27] and identify herself she's got to make
[1:45:31] contact are you still here she's got to
[1:45:34] make
[1:45:34] contact and when she did i love this i
[1:45:37] preached on it many times before around
[1:45:39] the world
[1:45:40] if you'll notice when she did that
[1:45:44] now now you're going to see it go the
[1:45:46] other way before it was going this way
[1:45:48] when abraham said you will never do that
[1:45:54] god hasn't even uttered a word abraham's
[1:45:56] already talking that be
[1:45:57] far from the you you'll never do you
[1:45:59] would never i know you
[1:46:02] now you've got xerxes looking at his
[1:46:05] queen
[1:46:06] she doesn't utter a word but he says
[1:46:09] what is thy request queen esther and thy
[1:46:12] petition
[1:46:13] it shall be how'd she know he how did he
[1:46:15] know she needed anything
[1:46:17] you know why her actions spoke louder
[1:46:19] than her words
[1:46:21] that she had came into his presence that
[1:46:23] she had donned her royal apparel that
[1:46:24] she had walked forward
[1:46:26] and put her hand on the head of the
[1:46:29] redeemer
[1:46:30] and now the king says ask anything to
[1:46:33] the half of my kingdom
[1:46:35] doesn't mean we're going to split it 50
[1:46:36] 50. that's a recipe for
[1:46:38] disastrous marriage if you're living in
[1:46:40] a 50-50 deal
[1:46:42] because you're both crooks and nobody
[1:46:43] will keep 50.
[1:46:46] you better if you're going to live that
[1:46:48] way if you're going to live in legalism
[1:46:50] then at least move it to 90-10 and each
[1:46:53] one of you give
[1:46:54] 90 and only expect and you might have a
[1:46:55] shot at it maybe you might make it pull
[1:46:57] it off
[1:46:58] but don't try 50 50. you're gonna
[1:46:59] cheated both of you you'll cheat and get
[1:47:01] cheated
[1:47:02] and so he wasn't offering her a 50 50
[1:47:04] deal he's offering her 100 percent of my
[1:47:06] whole kingdom
[1:47:07] i will 50 50 share it the whole thing
[1:47:10] with you
[1:47:11] ask me anything i'm going to tell you
[1:47:14] something friends
[1:47:15] that heart of esther that heart of the
[1:47:17] king that heart of abraham that heart
[1:47:19] and melchizedek
[1:47:20] that heart of the lamb that heart of
[1:47:22] john that's what sister ruth was singing
[1:47:24] about today
[1:47:25] that's where we've got to live friends
[1:47:27] that you you you remember
[1:47:29] you remember when when brother branham i
[1:47:32] thought about this
[1:47:33] this morning and i'm going to close with
[1:47:36] this
[1:47:36] i think i already said that once be like
[1:47:39] brother diggs
[1:47:40] don't don't get scared i'm fitting to
[1:47:41] close
[1:47:44] so when brother branham goes into that
[1:47:48] cafe
[1:47:50] you remember and here's a
[1:47:54] state trooper playing a slot machine got
[1:47:56] his arm around some young girl probably
[1:47:57] under age
[1:47:58] back in here some teenage boys being
[1:48:01] stupid and listening to
[1:48:02] boogie woogie music and all that and
[1:48:04] here's an old hag of a lady
[1:48:06] he said you know she's she's playing the
[1:48:08] part of an ill-famed woman she's got
[1:48:10] her two guys sitting there with her at
[1:48:12] the table and they're laughing and
[1:48:13] carrying on
[1:48:14] and brother branham just walks in here's
[1:48:16] a man of god
[1:48:17] who lived half of his life in the
[1:48:19] supernatural presence of the shekinah
[1:48:22] and he walks into that he's just trying
[1:48:24] to get a get up a breakfast
[1:48:26] and he walks in on that and he looks
[1:48:28] around
[1:48:29] and he says lord why
[1:48:33] don't you just destroy it just
[1:48:36] burn it how do you tolerate this it got
[1:48:39] on his
[1:48:40] under his skin so bad and then a vision
[1:48:43] begins to break
[1:48:44] and he says out in front of me he says i
[1:48:46] see a world turning and he steps back
[1:48:48] behind the door oh goodness the lord's
[1:48:49] talking to me
[1:48:51] and he says i've seen a world and he
[1:48:53] said around that world
[1:48:55] was a ring of blood and he said i saw
[1:48:58] sins i saw sins coming up from the earth
[1:49:02] headed toward god's throne but every
[1:49:04] time they would hit that bumper of blood
[1:49:08] they couldn't get past it here comes a
[1:49:10] sin it's going to
[1:49:11] for sure if this gets to the king he's
[1:49:13] going to kill that guy
[1:49:14] and boom it hits that bumper of blood
[1:49:17] can't make it
[1:49:19] and then he sees the lord jesus and the
[1:49:21] lord jesus is standing there
[1:49:23] and he says he sees something hitting
[1:49:26] him
[1:49:27] and he said when it hits him he said
[1:49:29] spit and blood just fly
[1:49:32] and it comes again and hits him again
[1:49:34] and he just flies
[1:49:35] because he's that bumper he's that
[1:49:38] bumper and every time a sin
[1:49:39] goes up that would get to god you've got
[1:49:42] an intermediary you've got one standing
[1:49:44] between the two hallelujah
[1:49:46] somebody's standing between you and me
[1:49:48] to take that blow that it doesn't get to
[1:49:50] god
[1:49:51] and brother branham catches a revelation
[1:49:53] and he says lord
[1:49:55] and the lord starts talking to him and
[1:49:58] he says now
[1:50:00] you you wanted me to destroy them
[1:50:05] and yet hear your sins
[1:50:11] my sins yes the only ones you're seeing
[1:50:14] are yours
[1:50:16] you mean the ones that are making your
[1:50:17] blood fly every time i do something
[1:50:20] a wrong thought wrong attitude wrong
[1:50:22] action wrong reaction that's
[1:50:24] hitting you yes and you want me to
[1:50:28] destroy all of these and yet i'm
[1:50:29] standing here blocking every
[1:50:31] transgression
[1:50:33] and brother branham says lord forgive me
[1:50:36] forgive me just forgive me you know what
[1:50:38] had happened
[1:50:39] he he says and when he asked the lord to
[1:50:42] forgive him he take
[1:50:43] jesus standing there holding a book and
[1:50:45] it says on the book
[1:50:47] the sins of william branham and he said
[1:50:50] when brother branham asked for
[1:50:51] forgiveness
[1:50:52] said jesus reached in his wounded side
[1:50:55] and took out some blood like an inkwell
[1:50:57] took blood on his finger and wrote
[1:51:00] across the book
[1:51:02] pardoned and he said he pitched it off
[1:51:04] behind him in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:51:06] to never be remembered against him no
[1:51:08] more
[1:51:09] and now he's got an attitude adjustment
[1:51:11] now he goes and
[1:51:13] he begins to talk to this woman and
[1:51:14] those men the lord arranged they go away
[1:51:16] he's starting to talk to her
[1:51:18] and when he starts talking to her and
[1:51:19] they start praying and the trooper stops
[1:51:21] playing the slot machine the boys settle
[1:51:22] down in the back the men come out nobody
[1:51:24] knows what to do
[1:51:25] the presence of god has locked the place
[1:51:27] up and here's brother branham he's not
[1:51:29] leading her to the seventh seal he's
