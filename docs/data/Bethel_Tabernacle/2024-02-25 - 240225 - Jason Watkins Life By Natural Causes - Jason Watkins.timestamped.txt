[32:03] so just trust me my church knows
[32:05] that amen uh but uh we love the Lord and
[32:10] um uh today I I thought to myself I was
[32:13] in the back room and I said you know I
[32:15] think I'm going to come out and start
[32:17] some new doctrines in the
[32:20] message and I'm GNA figure out how to
[32:22] line up some scriptures and line up some
[32:24] quotes and put them all together and I'm
[32:26] going to call the first do
[32:28] do uh the brother Steve and sister Emily
[32:31] can't go to Idaho for a month
[32:36] [Applause]
[32:41] Doctrine and the next one and this one's
[32:44] probably going to get me in more trouble
[32:46] The Bowman should live in buur
[32:50] [Applause]
[32:53] Doctrine
[32:55] amen well praise the Lord amen so we're
[32:59] we're happy in the Lord amen oh yeah
[33:02] that's right Ike and Daniel are here
[33:03] today where you at guys here's Isaac
[33:05] Daniel I'd have them stand up but they
[33:07] would make the lights go dim if they
[33:09] stood up so amen so we praise the Lord
[33:12] for that amen and um happy to have all
[33:17] of you here and visiting with us amen
[33:20] God bless you now I want to look back um
[33:24] in our verses that we were reading for
[33:29] our opening text and in just in a moment
[33:32] um sister Esther just in a moment we're
[33:34] going to catch Philippians 4 but just
[33:36] wait for my
[33:38] signal so I you know I I I I would I
[33:43] would say today that this sermon is a
[33:45] little bit
[33:46] different in that for a number of
[33:49] reasons I'm preaching on Life by natural
[33:53] causes now it's odd because I I gave up
[33:57] that title months and months ago even
[34:00] last year and said hey I'm working on a
[34:02] sermon I'm going to call it life by
[34:04] natural causes but I and I made some
[34:07] points out of that and I don't know if
[34:09] I'm going to repeat some of them today I
[34:10] didn't go back because I don't even know
[34:12] where I said that but I know I didn't
[34:14] preach what I'm going to be preaching
[34:16] today um and I and just the way it came
[34:19] so this has probably been one of the
[34:21] longest building sermons in a long time
[34:25] and I found it striking
[34:28] um and I can just only say
[34:30] Supernatural uh that brother Matt would
[34:34] preach the Sunday school class he
[34:36] preached today and I told him I said
[34:39] because I I walked in after he' read his
[34:41] text I said Matt did you read out of
[34:43] Romans s because if he had said yes I
[34:46] was going to accuse him of
[34:48] thievery I was going to I said well the
[34:50] only thing he didn't and I said what did
[34:52] you I said' what was your opening text
[34:54] and he was back in in the Old Testament
[34:55] I said 'w did you get to Romans 7 no I
[34:58] said ' good I said so I was either
[35:01] concluding after listening to his sermon
[35:03] this morning for the Sunday school class
[35:05] that either he is a hacker and he hacked
[35:08] my computer or the same being that has
[35:12] been dealing with me went to see him as
[35:14] well so I'm going to go with the
[35:17] ladder amen although it's flipped upside
[35:21] down he got to start so um we're we're
[35:24] going to just build off of that and so
[35:27] having taken this many months all the
[35:29] way from last year to develop this
[35:31] sermon you can imagine how ironic it
[35:33] feels to me that did I use the ironic
[35:36] correctly Uriah Uriah and I have been
[35:39] having this discussion over the use
[35:41] proper use of the word ironic but to me
[35:44] you know uh it just seems bizarre let me
[35:46] change it that way but I I just conclude
[35:49] that it's the Lord and I want you to
[35:51] notice in in Colossians 3 and you don't
[35:55] have to turn back there we're getting
[35:56] ready to go to Philippians 4 but the the
[36:00] point is and this is another reason why
[36:03] this sermon is a little bit different
[36:05] for me be and I it's the kind I enjoy
[36:08] it's a little more on the Practical side
[36:10] those are actually my favorite kind of
[36:12] preach and I don't often get to preach
[36:13] them and so uh but you know it starts
[36:17] out with you talking about something
[36:18] practical whatsoever you
[36:21] do or
[36:23] say everything that you say and do ought
[36:27] to be able to be uh approved by the Lord
[36:33] Jesus Christ and you ought to be able to
[36:35] put his name as a stamp of approval on
[36:38] your actions so that means and that
[36:42] that's you say oh goodness brother Jason
[36:44] you're going to get into our business
[36:46] today Paul already
[36:47] did I'm just stirring you up by way of
[36:50] remembrance Paul already told you this
[36:53] 20 centuries ago that however you live
[36:56] however you address how wherever you go
[36:59] whatever you do whatever you say ought
[37:02] to have the stamp of approval of the
[37:05] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen now
[37:09] remember that a manifestation of the
[37:12] name of God is the word
[37:14] interpreted so God interprets his word
[37:17] by bringing it to pass so by the way you
[37:21] claim to be Christian and the way you
[37:22] live and do and think and say uh that
[37:26] you're saying to the world I am the
[37:28] interpretation of the name of God and if
[37:31] that's not true brother brandom said
[37:33] then stop calling yourself a
[37:36] Christian see because you end up
[37:38] bringing a disgrace and so he but I but
[37:42] I I want to Leap Frog over that today
[37:44] I'm not going to cabbage down on that it
[37:47] Paul's words here need no addition
[37:49] they're pretty
[37:50] straightforward but what he ends with is
[37:53] do all in the name of the Lord Jesus and
[37:56] then he has this in them giving thanks
[37:59] to God and the father by him so and then
[38:03] when he goes into Colossians 4 continue
[38:06] in
[38:07] prayer and watch in the same with
[38:11] Thanksgiving all right so there there so
[38:14] now Paul is starting to tell us in my
[38:16] mind he's telling us not just how to act
[38:20] and how to speak but how to think that
[38:24] we ought to have grateful Hearts to the
[38:26] Lord and our lives ought to be an
[38:28] expression of our gratitude would you
[38:31] agree with me amen so then you know
[38:34] Peter gives us these very comforting
[38:37] words cast all your care upon him for he
[38:40] careth you now the reason I'm
[38:41] emphasizing that scripture is because
[38:45] you know if you heard brother Matt's uh
[38:48] Sunday school class and you're about to
[38:50] hear me going into this you know we
[38:52] you're going to find out and you have
[38:54] already found out you're going to find
[38:55] out more that even with a new birth the
[38:59] sin nature remains in your
[39:01] flesh amen and that's the problem as as
[39:06] as the old uh you know the old saying we
[39:08] have seen the enemy and it is
[39:11] us you know the the man in the mirror is
[39:14] brother brandom said that's my biggest
[39:16] enemy is that guy and he said if if I
[39:18] can just get him out of the way then the
[39:21] Lord can can direct things according to
[39:23] His glory so you know and that really is
[39:26] the rub that's what causes the believer
[39:29] so much anguish of soul is that you know
[39:34] we find ourselves falling short of the
[39:37] mark of the prize of the high calling
[39:41] and we find ourselves not really living
[39:43] to the standard of a high calling and
[39:46] that's Grievious to a born again child
[39:49] of God so you know that then it comes
[39:52] back around full circle what do I do
[39:54] about it casting all your care upon him
[39:58] for he carth for you as brother Matt was
[40:02] saying this morning he knows that's your
[40:04] condition you didn't even volunteer to
[40:06] come that way the Bible says you were
[40:08] subjected to it by him see so God in
[40:12] order to be a re brother Brandon would
[40:14] say it like this and it's a profound
[40:16] statement that God would predestinate a
[40:19] man to need salvation in order to give
[40:22] himself reason and purpose for
[40:25] being see so so th this is all you just
[40:29] remember this is all his plan it's all
[40:31] his message you're his people uh it the
[40:34] whole thing is about him and and I'll
[40:37] promise you that living for him Jesus
[40:40] never said it would be easy but he did
[40:43] say it would be worth it and I will
[40:45] promise you that it's worth it no matter
[40:47] what labors you have to endure here no
[40:50] matter what part of the Satan's Eden you
[40:53] have to write off and forget it and let
[40:55] the world call you crazy for doing it
[40:57] but you've already set your vision to
[40:59] things above you've your heart is
[41:01] already there and you're ready to work
[41:04] for the master and I can tell you as
[41:06] I've often said the retirement is out of
[41:09] this
[41:11] world
[41:13] Amen so all right sister Esther
[41:16] Philippians
[41:17] 4 verses
[41:22] 4-7 rejoice in the lord
[41:25] always again I will say
[41:30] rejoice now I I'm reading from the uh
[41:33] the uh New King James Version so if you
[41:36] have that sister Esther if you can flip
[41:38] that for me the N the
[41:40] nkjv the the nkjv I want to read that I
[41:43] meant to tell you that
[41:45] already I'm GNA start
[41:47] again rejoice in the lord always again I
[41:52] will say
[41:54] rejoice let your gentleness be known to
[41:58] all men the Lord is at hand amen all
[42:02] right so now I let me say it like this
[42:07] that that if this these passages that
[42:11] you're
[42:12] reading and we're going to find out that
[42:14] the Lord is at hand and he's going to
[42:16] emphasize that more on down in verses
[42:19] eight and what more but I want you to
[42:21] realize that these are instructions for
[42:24] when the Lord is at hand these are
[42:28] instructions for the end time now
[42:30] they've been instructions for the church
[42:32] don't get me wrong they've been
[42:34] instructions since since Paul pinned
[42:36] them to the Philippian church but
[42:38] everything we read you're you're living
[42:41] in the age of of a Zenith of everything
[42:45] everything comes to full maturity in
[42:47] this age the church the world Christ the
[42:51] word the Antichrist the antiw word the
[42:55] the the faith
[42:57] goes perfect the minds of men go
[43:01] insane you understand Satan takes over
[43:05] the world Christ takes over his
[43:07] bride the world has the mind of Satan
[43:10] the bride has the mind of Christ amen so
[43:14] it's a stark difference that's why that
[43:17] that's why it is uh it is
[43:21] it what word would I want to use and not
[43:24] sound harsh or insulting but let me just
[43:27] say that there's no way given what I
[43:31] just
[43:32] said the the the difference is so Stark
[43:36] they're reaching such a Zenith they have
[43:38] grown so far apart amen Christ and the
[43:42] Antichrist are so polarized at this
[43:45] stage now in the ages it was uh it was
[43:48] mongolz it was a hybrid it was an ad
[43:52] mixture to use brother brenham's word of
[43:54] Truth and error and Christ winked at
[43:56] that sitting in the eternity's
[43:58] interceding for his church but he cometh
[44:01] like Paul said to the Jews at the end of
[44:03] their age at there was a time when he
[44:05] winked at that that ignorance you kept
[44:07] bringing in bulls and goats and turtle
[44:09] doubs and lambs and all that kind of
[44:11] stuff and he sanctioned it but you were
[44:13] never supposed to stay there that was
[44:15] only speaking of the Lamb that would
[44:17] come and now that he's come you actually
[44:20] now need to come to the New
[44:22] Birth and 1,600 years of animal
[44:26] sacrifice is now going to be moved it's
[44:28] going to be done away with it's no
[44:30] longer going to count and I won't I
[44:32] won't acknowledge your observation under
[44:35] that old system you've got to come up to
[44:38] where the lamb is now and be born again
[44:41] you must
[44:43] repent see so well didn't they have to
[44:46] repent in the Old Testament it wouldn't
[44:48] have mattered because they they they
[44:50] brought their lamb and they got a a you
[44:53] know a
[44:54] substitution where God just covered over
[44:57] over their sin and and and his grace
[45:00] stayed on them but those animal
[45:02] sacrifices never converted them amen it
[45:06] never so repent means to turn and go the
[45:08] opposite direction if you don't have a
[45:10] new birth you can't sustain that very
[45:13] long see you've got to have a nature
[45:16] change on the inside you are a Triune
[45:19] being you've got a flesh that has your
[45:22] your your brother Bram called them
[45:23] inlets and outlets and you know you have
[45:26] the inlets of your of this you have your
[45:29] touch and your eyesight and your hearing
[45:30] your smell and your taste but then you
[45:33] also have outlets in your spirit which
[45:35] is memory affection conscience
[45:38] imagination I mean all of these things
[45:40] conscience memory affection imagination
[45:42] these things are are Outlets that that
[45:46] steer the body and you make those
[45:48] decisions in your heart where the spirit
[45:50] lives see and inside of that spirit is
[45:53] either a fallen nature that you were
[45:55] born with or it or it's that old Nature
[45:58] has been annihilated by the holy ghost
[46:00] in a new birth and now there's a new
[46:03] nature which is no longer the one you
[46:05] were born with that soul that new nature
[46:08] is now the life of God himself and now
[46:12] you're thinking is informed by your new
[46:14] nature and thus you act different live
[46:16] different go different speak different
[46:18] whatsoever you do in word or deed you do
[46:20] all in the name of the Lord Jesus isn't
[46:23] that easy that's not complicated
[46:30] so so we we we're going to get to Romans
[46:33] 7 here in a
[46:34] minute excuse me so so but here in
[46:38] Philippians 4 where we're at right
[46:42] now let your gentleness be known to all
[46:44] men the Lord is at hand so the point I
[46:48] wanted to make was that there's just no
[46:51] way given the Stark difference between
[46:55] being born again and what the world is
[46:59] there's really no grounds for living a
[47:03] half Christian
[47:05] Life you're just not born
[47:08] again see or if you've ever had a new
[47:11] birth experience you've let it get
[47:13] you've let that flame get so low and
[47:15] you've so cold because you've let you've
[47:17] let Satan entice that man in the mirror
[47:20] to fill up your life with carnality
[47:23] blocking out the sunlight of God's word
[47:25] and you've been excellent and doing it
[47:27] and now your life is filled with
[47:29] carnality see and so you know I I I I
[47:33] want to keep going I don't want to get
[47:35] ahead of myself so we're looking now at
[47:39] the end time the end time calls for you
[47:41] to be either hot or
[47:44] cold so he says in verse six be anxious
[47:48] for nothing but in everything by prayer
[47:53] now the King James says be careful but
[47:56] the new King James James if you look at
[47:57] the Greek the anxious is actually a
[47:59] better word be anxious for nothing but
[48:02] in everything by prayer and supplication
[48:05] with Thanksgiving let your requests be
[48:07] made known to God and the peace of God
[48:10] which surpasses all understanding will
[48:13] guard your hearts and Minds through
[48:15] Christ Jesus so that is a sure sign that
[48:20] the peace of God is working in your
[48:22] heart because it surpasses understanding
[48:26] you're situation that's causing you the
[48:29] anxiety may not have changed at all but
[48:33] somehow you have the peace of God in all
[48:35] of it your circumstance may may may not
[48:39] have abated in fact is you want to talk
[48:42] about something that's hard to explain
[48:45] and this is the uh this is what gives
[48:47] the devil a migraine is that the harder
[48:50] he makes it on you the more peaceful you
[48:52] become the more you trust
[48:55] God and that is so counterintuitive to
[48:57] him he cannot figure that out see and
[49:00] that's why brother Brenham said he
[49:02] cannot impersonate that life he can
[49:04] impersonate any of the gifts but he
[49:07] cannot impersonate the new the new
[49:09] birth and he he
[49:12] doesn't understand how that that life of
[49:16] God gets inside of you he reads the
[49:18] doctrine he knows how it happens
[49:20] doctrinally you understand how it
[49:22] happens doctrinally I understand how it
[49:24] happens doctrinally I had a gene of God
[49:27] and two omnipotence met and the life in
[49:30] the seed came to life annihilated the
[49:32] old nature I understand that doctrinally
[49:34] but it's a whole new world when it I
[49:36] experienced
[49:41] it I I I read books about having kids
[49:45] but when I had my own children it was a
[49:47] whole new
[49:49] world and every grandparent knows that
[49:51] opens a door you didn't even know was
[49:53] there and you thought there all the all
[49:56] your doors of Love were open and then
[49:58] grandkids come along and you wonder if
[49:59] you've ever loved
[50:04] anybody it's the
[50:06] truth my grandkids know it take
[50:08] advantage of
[50:13] it I'm definitely a a stap and I love it
[50:18] not planning to
[50:21] change verse 7 and the peace of God
[50:23] which surpasses all understanding will
[50:25] guard your heart and Minds through
[50:27] Christ Jesus now I want to look into
[50:31] Romans 7 uh
[50:37] 14 and we will go down through I'm not
[50:41] going to read it all let me just go down
[50:43] uh go 14 through uh maybe 24 25
[50:47] somewhere down in there 14 for we
[50:51] know that the law is spiritual but I am
[50:55] carnal so under sin you get that Paul is
[51:00] just saying because Paul's born again
[51:02] here this isn't this is not prior to
[51:05] Paul's New Birth experience Paul is
[51:08] saying this to Believers he's he's
[51:10] acknowledging all he's he's not he's not
[51:13] saying I'm a secret sinner he's saying I
[51:15] still got sin in my flesh I still have
[51:17] the greatest battle ever fought to
[51:21] fight just because I got the Holy Ghost
[51:24] I can't just it's not a vacation from
[51:26] here as I've heard me say I'm not going
[51:28] down to the docks uh to wait on The Old
[51:31] Ship of Zion and set on my luggage I
[51:35] I've got to fight if I must win amen
[51:38] shall others as brother Bram talks about
[51:41] that great poem you know they sell the
[51:44] the bloody Seas you know shall I have a
[51:46] life of ease While others fought to win
[51:48] the prize and sail through bloody
[51:51] Seas would you even want that I don't
[51:54] want that I want to do my part I want to
[51:58] stand in that redeemed crowd on the
[52:00] other side and say I fought
[52:03] also Hallelujah I don't want to be
[52:06] wishy-washy I don't want a shortcut I
[52:09] don't want a treaty with the devil I
[52:10] don't want a truce or an arm assist or a
[52:13] ceasefire if he stops shooting I'll keep
[52:16] [Applause]
[52:19] shooting wow say why are you so mad at
[52:22] the Devil I want him
[52:24] dead he's tortured God 's family long
[52:30] enough so Paul is breaking into this
[52:33] fact that the sin nature even after the
[52:35] New Birth remains in your flesh and you
[52:37] have to keep your guard up over it
[52:40] you're born with different propensities
[52:42] to various weaknesses we're all like
[52:44] that and and and a lot of times they say
[52:47] well this certain thing the person was
[52:49] born with it you know it's in their
[52:51] genes sure in your Fallen nature of
[52:54] course you need reged amen see so we all
[52:58] have certain propensities to certain
[53:00] different things I've went through that
[53:02] before and explained it uh for we know
[53:05] that the law is spiritual but I'm carnal
[53:08] sold under sin so that's the rub that's
[53:10] the that's the grind the law is
[53:13] spiritual but man this carnal
[53:16] flesh for that which I do I allow not I
[53:20] in other words I do things I know better
[53:22] than for what I would that do I not the
[53:26] things I know I ought to do I find
[53:28] myself too lazy to do them see but but
[53:32] what I hate that do I I mean can you can
[53:36] you just you know I just know how when I
[53:38] read that and I just say
[53:41] yep I can just see Paul laying down his
[53:46] pen see so here's some logic if then I
[53:51] do that which I would not if I'm
[53:53] constantly doing what I know better I
[53:55] shouldn't do it then I consent to the
[53:58] law that it is good in other words I
[53:59] know there's a higher power and a higher
[54:01] life that I ought to live and it bothers
[54:04] me when I
[54:06] don't
[54:07] see I consent to the law that it is good
[54:11] now so so and the next point is that
[54:15] Paul is taking
[54:17] ownership and he's he's exonerating
[54:23] God because the fact that I know I
[54:25] shouldn't do it then I know God is Holy
[54:27] and I can't blame him
[54:31] see now then it is no more here's his
[54:34] relief this is his relief valve this is
[54:36] how he lets off the pressure if then I
[54:39] do that which I would not I consent to
[54:41] law this good verse 17 now then it is no
[54:44] more I that do it but sin that dwelleth
[54:46] in me that's good I can get some
[54:48] separation there see I can go to the
[54:52] Lord and in prayer and say Lord you know
[54:54] I didn't mean to do that I got trapped
[54:56] in into it I was weak a moment of
[54:57] weakness maybe I wasn't prayed up enough
[54:59] maybe whatever but I don't want to be
[55:02] like that forgive me and the Bible says
[55:05] if we ask for his forgiveness he is
[55:08] faithful and just to forgive am
[55:11] see for I know that in me that is in my
[55:15] flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will
[55:19] is present with me but how to perform
[55:23] that which is good I find not for the
[55:27] good that I would I do not but the evil
[55:30] which I would not that I do now if I do
[55:36] that now if I do that I would not it is
[55:40] no more I that do it but sin that
[55:42] dwelleth in me take that Satan amen I'm
[55:46] a
[55:47] Believer I don't want a sinful life say
[55:51] you now now that you're a Christian can
[55:53] you do anything you want you better
[55:55] believe it I only do what I want and the
[55:58] only time I do what I don't want is when
[56:00] I Stumble and make a
[56:02] mistake living the life of a Christian
[56:04] is joy
[56:06] unspeakable and full of
[56:10] Glory so Paul says here's my conclusion
[56:13] I find in a law this is helping you ex
[56:17] this is going to help you understand
[56:19] you I find a law that when I would do
[56:22] good evil is still present with me see
[56:25] still right here for I Delight in the
[56:29] law of God after the inward man the
[56:31] inward man is a different man than the
[56:33] outward man see but I see another law in
[56:37] my members that he's already identified
[56:39] that's his flesh Waring against the law
[56:42] of my mind that that that converted
[56:45] nature and and that's why brother
[56:47] Brandon would say this this that or the
[56:49] other my Holy Ghost would keep me from
[56:51] that of course he will doesn't mean he's
[56:54] going to force you to not stumble but
[56:57] he's never going to go never going to go
[56:59] along with it right and he's going to
[57:02] convict you constantly not the Lord
[57:05] doesn't condemn his family he condemns
[57:08] sin you've already passed from Death to
[57:10] life you're no more can come to the
[57:13] Judgment sin is no longer he that's he
[57:16] that's born of God hath no more
[57:18] conscience of sin see his Nature's been
[57:21] changed he has no more desire of sin but
[57:24] but yet it still exists in the flesh but
[57:27] I I I don't take my delight in living
[57:30] carnally I take my delight in living
[57:33] spiritually but I do see another law in
[57:36] my members Waring against the law of my
[57:40] mind and bringing me into captivity to
[57:43] the law of sin which is in my members
[57:47] now verse
[57:52] 24 excuse me that's a a call from
[57:56] several weeks ago I can't seem to get
[57:57] rid of
[57:58] it but the devil's a liar
[58:01] anyway so so
[58:05] now you know some people are are known
[58:09] to have quite a high estimate of
[58:12] themselves and for those this 24th verse
[58:15] will help
[58:17] you oh Wretched Man that I am who shall
[58:23] deliver me from this body of death when
[58:25] you're filling all self-righteous and
[58:27] everybody around you is a bunch of
[58:28] Sinners can you please go read this 24th
[58:32] verse so we don't have to suffer through
[58:34] your arrogant
[58:38] self-righteousness oh Wretched Man that
[58:40] I am who shall deliver me from the body
[58:44] of this death I thank God thank God
[58:46] there's an
[58:47] answer this he didn't leave us in a
[58:49] conundrum he gives an answer I hate it
[58:51] somebody gives me a problem don't give
[58:52] me the answer why'd you give me the
[58:54] problem now I'm gonna lose sleep give me
[58:56] the answer I thank God through Jesus
[58:59] Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I
[59:03] myself serve the law of God but with the
[59:05] flesh the law of
[59:07] sin
[59:09] amen now the the the the beauty let
[59:14] let's go on down into
[59:17] chapter8 um sister Esther let's let's go
[59:19] into chapter 8 I love this having said
[59:23] everything that he has said he's now
[59:26] about about to tell you this is why
[59:29] there's no condemnation now for you even
[59:33] if you have made a mistake because you
[59:36] can
[59:37] repent so he says there is therefore now
[59:40] no
[59:43] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[59:46] Jesus amen who walk not after the flesh
[59:50] but after the spirit Rejoice friends
[59:53] Rejoice just Rejoice let off the
[59:55] pressure
[59:56] I could dismiss right here with M with
[59:58] Matt Smith's Sunday School in this
[1:00:01] lesson to this point and and I and I've
[1:00:03] only been going 28 minutes uh you can
[1:00:06] just let off the pressure there is now
[1:00:08] therefore no condemnation to them which
[1:00:11] are in Christ you are quite
[1:00:14] unindictable that's right amen amen
[1:00:17] because you've already passed from Death
[1:00:19] to life and the only thing the Lord is
[1:00:22] convicting you for is to bring you back
[1:00:24] to fervency amen
[1:00:27] amen so for the law verse Two for the
[1:00:31] law of the spirit of life in Christ
[1:00:35] Jesus hath made me free from the law of
[1:00:39] sin and death for what the law could not
[1:00:41] do and that it was weak through the
[1:00:43] flesh God sending his own son in the
[1:00:46] likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[1:00:48] condemn sin in the flesh in other words
[1:00:50] he knew I couldn't keep the law and
[1:00:53] that's why God gave it to man to prove
[1:00:55] to him he couldn't keep it
[1:00:57] the the law was a a decision the people
[1:01:00] decided they wanted brother brandom said
[1:01:03] they left the Egypt under the pillar of
[1:01:05] fire that A Cloud by day a fire by night
[1:01:07] that's the angel of the Covenant that's
[1:01:09] the angel of the Lord in the camp God
[1:01:12] had God knew they were stiff necked he
[1:01:14] knew they weren't born again of the Holy
[1:01:16] Ghost he he tells Moses I can't you know
[1:01:19] I can't live among them or I'll I'll
[1:01:22] slay everybody but I'll send my angel
[1:01:24] and he'll come among you see
[1:01:26] so that that's the difference you get
[1:01:28] over the Book of Revelation after the
[1:01:30] Millennium and the new heavens and the
[1:01:31] new Earth the Bible finally says finally
[1:01:34] at the end of the Bible God himself
[1:01:37] shall dwell so he doesn't need an office
[1:01:39] to do that anymore and so the the whole
[1:01:42] earth is redeemed the people are
[1:01:43] redeemed the atmospheres are redeemed
[1:01:45] the heavens are redeemed Satan's dead
[1:01:47] his demons are dead sin is gone Sinners
[1:01:49] are gone
[1:01:52] Hallelujah so right now we need the Holy
[1:01:55] Ghost living inside of us
[1:01:57] see so he says
[1:02:01] so so now the the law couldn't the the
[1:02:05] Paul takes that up on into Romans how
[1:02:09] that Satan that crafty Slicker used the
[1:02:13] word of God that was meant for life he
[1:02:16] took the law something that was good it
[1:02:18] came from God for goodness sake and it's
[1:02:21] all good Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt
[1:02:23] not lie Thou shalt not bear false
[1:02:25] witness Thou shalt not adultery those
[1:02:26] steal all these different things and and
[1:02:29] honor your father and mother and all
[1:02:30] these things keep the Sabbath holy these
[1:02:32] are all good things they're meant for
[1:02:33] life but Satan knowing how the science
[1:02:37] worked he knew that you that God's
[1:02:40] people even God's people even Moses even
[1:02:43] Joshua were living in a sinful body that
[1:02:47] didn't have a new birth on the
[1:02:50] inside and therefore so so Paul says he
[1:02:54] he he took advantage AG there was
[1:02:57] nothing wrong with the law the problem
[1:02:59] was within the people God's family and
[1:03:03] so he says that thing which was meant
[1:03:05] for life became death unto
[1:03:08] me so that's why Jesus the beauty of the
[1:03:12] scripture is is that for what the law
[1:03:14] could not do and that it was weak
[1:03:16] through the flesh God sending his own
[1:03:18] son in the likeness of sinful flesh and
[1:03:20] for sin condemn sin in the flesh he took
[1:03:24] all your bad that you've ever done will
[1:03:26] do in the future and nailed it to his
[1:03:29] cross and he took the law the book of
[1:03:32] ordinances that was against me and
[1:03:33] nailed it to his
[1:03:36] cross it's why brother Brandon would say
[1:03:38] the most astonishing statement a
[1:03:40] preacher of the Gospel could say and he
[1:03:43] said God will never condemn a man for
[1:03:46] being a
[1:03:47] sinner
[1:03:50] amen cuz he was born a sinner God's not
[1:03:54] evil he's not
[1:03:57] unjust he'll never condemn a man for
[1:03:59] being a sinner the man was born a sinner
[1:04:01] God knows that he said what will condemn
[1:04:03] the man is that he remained a sinner
[1:04:05] when he did not have to that Christ came
[1:04:09] and for sin condemns sin so that you
[1:04:12] could be free and he went to Calvary and
[1:04:15] and Prophet said God convicted him
[1:04:17] condemned him convicted him as a sinner
[1:04:19] and sit him to hell so I won't have to
[1:04:21] go so you won't have to go your family
[1:04:23] won't ever have to go the love of God
[1:04:27] shed
[1:04:34] abroad see verse four that the
[1:04:36] righteousness of the law might be
[1:04:38] fulfilled in us who walk here's the key
[1:04:41] who walk not after the flesh but after
[1:04:44] the spirit those who have been willing
[1:04:45] to be born again and then let the spirit
[1:04:48] of God lead their
[1:04:50] life for they that are after The Flesh
[1:04:53] do mind the things of the flesh that's
[1:04:55] pretty obvious to
[1:04:56] see that's pretty
[1:04:58] blatant that's the thing that keeps
[1:05:00] pastors up at night and keeps them on
[1:05:03] their
[1:05:03] knees is is God's family living after
[1:05:06] the Flesh and minding the things of the
[1:05:08] flesh when they ought not
[1:05:10] to but they that are after the spirit
[1:05:13] the things of the spirit for to be
[1:05:15] carnally minded is death stay you know
[1:05:19] just don't come to the New Birth and
[1:05:22] that's
[1:05:23] death bhet said you're not even living
[1:05:25] until you are born again you're just
[1:05:28] dying say well I am I am not you are too
[1:05:34] you're dying physically you're dying
[1:05:37] you're perishing you don't have eternal
[1:05:39] life this body is going to lay down the
[1:05:41] only people that that won't ever lay
[1:05:43] down in death are those who are alive
[1:05:45] and remain at the coming of the Lord
[1:05:48] every man born has an appointment with
[1:05:50] death see and so if you never give your
[1:05:54] heart to the Lord and never let him
[1:05:55] convert that nature you're just going to
[1:05:57] go on to where you're already going but
[1:05:59] if you let the Lord but to be
[1:06:02] spiritually minded is life and peace
[1:06:05] amen that's life when you allow the Holy
[1:06:08] Spirit to re recreate you and make you a
[1:06:11] brand new unit not join a church that
[1:06:15] can almost make you worse because then
[1:06:18] you're just piling up stones of
[1:06:19] unconverted people and probably said
[1:06:22] you'd be better to leave them out there
[1:06:23] because then they know they're wrong and
[1:06:25] can deal with them you bring them in a
[1:06:26] church put their name on a book shake a
[1:06:28] preacher's hand put them in the choir
[1:06:30] they think they're saved when they're
[1:06:31] not and then God can't even help them
[1:06:33] and deal with them because they already
[1:06:34] think they have it they're blind see
[1:06:38] that she's she's she's blind and says I
[1:06:41] have need of nothing that's the spirit
[1:06:43] of the age Thou Art wretched and poor
[1:06:45] and miserable and blind and naked and
[1:06:46] you say I have need of nothing when
[1:06:48] actually you have nothing
[1:06:51] right because when you have eternal life
[1:06:53] you have everything even if in this
[1:06:56] fleshly life you have nothing you have
[1:07:01] everything
[1:07:03] so so he
[1:07:06] says here here it is verse seven because
[1:07:10] the carnal mind is enmity against God
[1:07:14] for it is not subject to the law of God
[1:07:16] neither indeed can be see so you you
[1:07:20] can't know God just by a mental
[1:07:23] experience amen you You' got to do more
[1:07:26] than just admire the fine qualities of
[1:07:29] Jesus and call yourself a
[1:07:32] Christian because the carnal mind is
[1:07:34] enmity against God so it for it is not
[1:07:36] subject to the law of God neither indeed
[1:07:37] can be it's enmity it's it'll never
[1:07:39] agree with God's word see verse eight so
[1:07:42] then they that are in the flesh cannot
[1:07:44] please God it wouldn't matter your Works
[1:07:47] wouldn't matter how many hospitals and
[1:07:49] orphanages you build it wouldn't matter
[1:07:52] how how honest you are on your taxes or
[1:07:55] you feed the neighbor's dog that's not
[1:07:57] going to help you with eternal life
[1:07:59] you're going to reap you'll you you sow
[1:08:01] you reap if you sow good you'll reap
[1:08:04] good you give God will command people to
[1:08:06] give to you but as far as Eternal value
[1:08:09] again you've got to be Jesus said you
[1:08:11] must be born again amen
[1:08:15] amen so then verse eight so then they
[1:08:18] that are in the flesh cannot please God
[1:08:19] verse n but ye are not in the flesh but
[1:08:22] in the spirit if so be that the spirit
[1:08:24] of God dwell in you now if any man have
[1:08:26] not the spirit of Christ he is none of
[1:08:30] his that's tough man that's
[1:08:33] tough that's just
[1:08:35] straight If any man have not the spirit
[1:08:38] of Christ he is none of his and if
[1:08:41] Christ be in you now he's going to flip
[1:08:43] it to the other side if Christ be in you
[1:08:46] the body is dead because of sin all your
[1:08:48] desires are now for Christ just like a
[1:08:51] the a lot of times marriages are end up
[1:08:56] on the Rocks because first on the man he
[1:09:00] he never actually leaves father and
[1:09:02] mother and Cleaves to his wife on
[1:09:06] Amen and he lets Mom and Dad run his
[1:09:09] marriage on the girl she never accepts
[1:09:14] God's word that her desires are to be to
[1:09:17] her
[1:09:18] husband and all of her dreams and all of
[1:09:20] her plans even her La even her name
[1:09:23] become now changed and subject to his
[1:09:27] leadership so you've got men falling on
[1:09:30] one side women falling on the other side
[1:09:32] that is a recipe for disaster
[1:09:35] amen so so so that that's a that's an
[1:09:39] important point for brothers and for
[1:09:42] sisters your identity is lost in the
[1:09:45] identity of a godly man if he's not a
[1:09:47] godly man don't marry
[1:09:50] him don't marry him that's a recipe for
[1:09:53] hell on Earth
[1:09:56] so so and and that's and that's and
[1:09:58] that's exactly why it is the I'm here to
[1:10:01] tell you something 75 this is statistic
[1:10:05] 75% of all divorces are initiated by the
[1:10:08] wife three out of every four see what
[1:10:12] does that say about the weakness of men
[1:10:15] that they're married to and and a woman
[1:10:18] is naturally wired to be led that way
[1:10:20] she might be a women's Li but the holy
[1:10:22] spirit will take that out of her and
[1:10:24] show her her real nature see wo got
[1:10:27] quiet let me move on Lord
[1:10:29] please that wasn't in my notes that's
[1:10:32] free thank
[1:10:34] you all
[1:10:36] right if Christ be in you the body is
[1:10:38] dead because of sin the spirit of life
[1:10:40] and but the spirit of
[1:10:43] life is is life because of righteousness
[1:10:46] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:10:49] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:10:52] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[1:10:53] also Quicken your mortal bodies by his
[1:10:55] spirit that dwelleth in you that's not
[1:10:57] just on Rapture Day that's not just
[1:10:59] changing your your body that's bringing
[1:11:01] your body now subject to the word of God
[1:11:06] willingly freely of your own new will
[1:11:09] right see not against your
[1:11:12] will
[1:11:14] so so it becomes pretty clear thank you
[1:11:17] sister Esther so it becomes pretty
[1:11:19] clear that if
[1:11:21] you're it's clear that you're going to
[1:11:24] need a new life inside of you if you
[1:11:29] plan to walk in and out of the city of
[1:11:33] God Amen I don't I didn't know how to
[1:11:36] put it pler so that's how I wrote it
[1:11:39] it's pretty clear that you're going to
[1:11:42] need a new life inside of you if you
[1:11:44] plan to walk into the city of God Walk
[1:11:46] in walk out walk back in that's what I
[1:11:50] want that's the life I'm looking for
[1:11:52] it's what I'm living for it's what
[1:11:55] Abraham was looking for a city whose
[1:11:58] Builder and maker was God see so Paul
[1:12:03] makes it clear that that the life from
[1:12:06] your natural birth is no good and since
[1:12:10] the and and not only that the life and
[1:12:12] catch how I say this not only is the is
[1:12:16] the the life of your natural birth no
[1:12:20] good it's going to require a super
[1:12:25] natural
[1:12:28] experience because the life of your
[1:12:30] natural birth is no good for getting
[1:12:33] into the city of God you're going to
[1:12:35] have to have a
[1:12:37] supernatural
[1:12:39] experience and of course the leading
[1:12:42] question of
[1:12:44] Believers gracious since the first make
[1:12:47] Believers showed up in the early Church
[1:12:49] in Jerusalem ananas and
[1:12:52] Safara uh the leading question of
[1:12:54] believers for 20 centuries has been what
[1:12:58] is the experience of the baptism of the
[1:13:01] Holy
[1:13:02] Ghost and and what am I looking for and
[1:13:06] how do I know when it happens young
[1:13:08] people have this question and this
[1:13:11] question is needlessly hard and
[1:13:13] difficult it's needlessly difficult
[1:13:16] because the promise is easy and God
[1:13:17] wants to give that to you more than you
[1:13:19] want to receive it all you have to do is
[1:13:21] repent and and that means make a
[1:13:24] complete willing to die out to
[1:13:27] everything of the world and say Lord I'm
[1:13:29] tired of being me I want to be you I
[1:13:31] don't want to be me anymore I want a
[1:13:33] completely new life I'm repenting I'm
[1:13:35] turning away from all my former life and
[1:13:38] then Peter said then the promise is to
[1:13:41] you and it'll work for your children
[1:13:43] it'll work for theirs and as many as the
[1:13:46] Lord Our God shall ever call for 2,000
[1:13:48] years that'll always be the formula it's
[1:13:52] not hard to get it it's just been
[1:13:54] there's been so much uh confusion and I
[1:13:57] I'm not here to condemn you know uh I
[1:14:00] grew up through a lot of confusion and
[1:14:02] and and things and the reason I can see
[1:14:04] why it is because you have to understand
[1:14:06] that the early church started with the
[1:14:09] pure word we've had to be restored back
[1:14:11] peace meal through hundreds of years so
[1:14:14] we had to come through Luther's
[1:14:16] justification and Satan had a 100 years
[1:14:18] to cl to muddy the water then Wesley
[1:14:21] sanctification and Satan's had hundreds
[1:14:23] of years to muddy the water then the iso
[1:14:25] experience and Satan's had uh more than
[1:14:27] a 100 years to muddy the water and then
[1:14:30] the opening of the word and now Satan is
[1:14:32] still muddying the water amen see so so
[1:14:36] I get it but you know what am I looking
[1:14:38] for and how do I know when it happens
[1:14:40] can I can I make a statement to you I
[1:14:43] don't know if I would make this
[1:14:44] statement in in another man's pull pit
[1:14:46] unless I just knew him very well but I
[1:14:49] have a right to say it here seeking a
[1:14:52] preconceived experience is folly
[1:14:55] amen
[1:14:57] amen expecting to come up and I'm going
[1:15:00] to have this kind of a sensation or this
[1:15:02] kind of an emotion or if I have this
[1:15:04] experience if I shout brother brandham
[1:15:06] says will I shout he said you might do
[1:15:08] that and you might not will I speak in
[1:15:10] tongues you might do that and you might
[1:15:11] not will this happen you might that
[1:15:13] might and it might not he says but one
[1:15:16] thing for sure is you will come subject
[1:15:19] to the word of God so I would say to you
[1:15:22] today that seeking a preconceived
[1:15:24] experience is folly it's
[1:15:26] counterproductive it's distracting and
[1:15:29] ultimately self-defeating and I've seen
[1:15:32] young people defeated by it decade after
[1:15:35] decade after decade let me tell you I'm
[1:15:37] going to set the record straight what do
[1:15:39] I seek for brother Jason seek from the
[1:15:42] Lord an experience which will change
[1:15:45] your old nature and place the love of
[1:15:48] God in your heart and change your
[1:15:52] desires and your whole life
[1:15:56] am something that will put the love of
[1:15:59] God in your heart you might sit here
[1:16:00] today and say but I already love God
[1:16:02] listen to
[1:16:07] me you
[1:16:11] listening there is a lifechanging
[1:16:13] difference is that a big one would that
[1:16:16] be pretty big in your mind if it's
[1:16:18] lifechanging there's a life-changing
[1:16:20] difference between having a love for God
[1:16:22] and having the love of God hallelujah
[1:16:28] I'm I'm telling you get the love of God
[1:16:30] say I already have a love for God
[1:16:32] there's a big difference between having
[1:16:35] a love for God charismatics have a love
[1:16:39] for God Pentecostals have a love for God
[1:16:41] evangelicals have a love for God they're
[1:16:43] not faking that that's real they have a
[1:16:46] love for God but that's a big difference
[1:16:48] a
[1:16:49] lifechanging there's a lifechanging
[1:16:51] Grand Canyon between having a love for
[1:16:54] God and having the love of God only the
[1:16:57] love of God Bridges the chasm and puts
[1:16:59] you back on the other side in Heavenly
[1:17:02] places in Christ
[1:17:04] Jesus with the you know go go to God for
[1:17:08] that experience and I would say it is an
[1:17:11] experience and go to God for that
[1:17:12] experience don't go to God for some
[1:17:14] preconceived experience go to God with
[1:17:17] your mind made up that I want to be
[1:17:19] changed I want to be I want to be a
[1:17:21] brand new person and go to him for that
[1:17:24] EXP experience and don't stop till you
[1:17:27] get
[1:17:28] it and you might get it in 5 minutes or
[1:17:32] it might take you five hours or five
[1:17:34] days but don't
[1:17:35] stop until something has changed you
[1:17:39] from the inside out and then whatever
[1:17:42] manifestation that brings to God be the
[1:17:45] glory why is that so
[1:17:47] complicated I've never understood that
[1:17:50] why do we see such a Thrust on our young
[1:17:53] people to have some type of emotional
[1:17:56] experience I and and I'm not against
[1:17:58] praying to speak in tongues that's the
[1:18:00] Bible I'm not against seeking to know
[1:18:02] God in those kinds of ways I love them I
[1:18:04] get to experience it every time I preach
[1:18:06] I'm in another world even if I walk out
[1:18:09] here sick I suddenly feel like a million
[1:18:11] bucks it doesn't even matter and I'm
[1:18:14] here to tell you I know what it is to be
[1:18:16] in the presence of God but but that
[1:18:18] presence of God comes and goes you're
[1:18:20] going to want to live in his presence
[1:18:23] always yes you're going to want to have
[1:18:27] something down inside you that not only
[1:18:29] has a love for God but loves his word
[1:18:32] and loves to keep it and wants to keep
[1:18:34] it and are sad when you don't keep it
[1:18:39] see so go to God for that
[1:18:43] experience with the love of God living
[1:18:46] in Your Heart by a new birth you can
[1:18:49] serve the Lord with your whole soul and
[1:18:50] you can overcome the sinful world that's
[1:18:53] how you'll know you've been changed
[1:18:57] I'm preaching about life by natural
[1:18:59] causes and it caused me to to think of
[1:19:03] the term death by natural causes and I
[1:19:06] did a little bit of research not being a
[1:19:08] medical
[1:19:09] professional but there's plenty of good
[1:19:11] sources and I've used them before and uh
[1:19:15] there's mayo and there's John Hopkins
[1:19:17] and different things and and you can you
[1:19:19] can verify all this yourself but you
[1:19:22] know what is the meaning now cat it
[1:19:24] because I'm going to use a contrast okay
[1:19:27] I I'm using a contrast death by natural
[1:19:30] causes all right so what is the broad
[1:19:35] meaning of the term death by natural
[1:19:38] causes and that is a very broad much
[1:19:40] broader than I thought it was but when
[1:19:43] when death is attributed to natural
[1:19:46] causes It generally means that the
[1:19:48] person died from you know died from a a
[1:19:53] medical condition or even perhaps an
[1:19:56] illness rather than some external Factor
[1:20:00] like homicide or suicide or an accident
[1:20:04] you weren't
[1:20:05] killed see but actually it can include
[1:20:09] diseases see and organ failure and other
[1:20:11] internal conditions basically natural
[1:20:14] causes are medical conditions that arise
[1:20:18] naturally in the body and progress to
[1:20:20] the point of death as opposed to an
[1:20:23] external Force causing the death and as
[1:20:27] I said and and this is what I found that
[1:20:29] it's a it's a bit of a broad category
[1:20:31] but it basically rules out un unnatural
[1:20:34] causes like homicide suicide or
[1:20:37] accidents so so then we ask ourselves
[1:20:41] and I I thought about this you know I
[1:20:42] thought about brother brandham talks
[1:20:44] about brother Bosworth and he died
[1:20:46] healthy 88 years old John Wesley the
[1:20:49] same thing he didn't have anything no
[1:20:51] diseases nothing was wrong with him
[1:20:53] brother Bram heard he's dying he races
[1:20:55] and almost wears his tires out getting
[1:20:57] there and burst in brother Bosworth
[1:20:59] what's wrong nothing well they said
[1:21:01] you're dying well I can't die I died
[1:21:03] years ago he said Billy I'm just going
[1:21:06] home that's it I'm just going home see
[1:21:11] so so he just died of old age and what
[1:21:14] what would the medical community call
[1:21:16] that when someone dies and there are no
[1:21:18] medical problems and there are no
[1:21:21] external forces causing their death and
[1:21:24] so there really isn't uh a a specific
[1:21:27] term for dying of old age but doctors
[1:21:30] will sometimes use the phrase death by
[1:21:33] natural causes in cases where there's no
[1:21:36] specific medical condition to point to
[1:21:38] essentially they're saying that the
[1:21:40] person simply died because they were old
[1:21:42] and their body couldn't maintain itself
[1:21:44] anymore all right and they have a term
[1:21:47] for this sometimes it's called old age
[1:21:49] sence or I didn't know what that meant
[1:21:51] but it's old age
[1:21:52] Frailty and so it just means the
[1:21:54] person's body simply wore out and
[1:21:57] couldn't keep going uh it can be one
[1:22:00] source said it can be the result of
[1:22:02] gradual deterioration of body systems
[1:22:04] like the heart or lungs or it could be
[1:22:06] because the person was no longer able to
[1:22:08] fend off infections or maintain proper
[1:22:10] nutrition the person died as a result of
[1:22:13] the natural aging process it's actually
[1:22:16] quite common but not easily defined and
[1:22:20] is considered a natural part of the life
[1:22:23] cycle amen
[1:22:26] amen so I I thought to myself how
[1:22:29] remarkable it is that with all of our
[1:22:32] scientific knowledge and advancements
[1:22:34] that we have there's still this gray
[1:22:36] area this murkiness when it comes to
[1:22:38] explaining death in old age they don't
[1:22:41] understand you know and and and it's
[1:22:43] like our bodies have an expiration date
[1:22:45] that we can't quite pinpoint see but but
[1:22:50] but I thought to myself well then what
[1:22:54] would life be by natural causes brother
[1:22:57] Jason isn't that your title why are you
[1:23:00] it's getting morbid you're talking about
[1:23:01] death I thought your your title was Life
[1:23:04] by natural causes yes and and and that
[1:23:07] works great life works great up until
[1:23:10] you're about
[1:23:11] 25 remember brother brandham you know
[1:23:14] and he started he he asked Dr Sam adir
[1:23:16] who was a good friend of his and we uh
[1:23:19] we had dealings there when I was a boy
[1:23:21] growing up I think Sam was still alive
[1:23:23] how long did or I think sister Jean I
[1:23:25] don't know if she's here today but uh
[1:23:27] but but I we we knew uh Dr Sam so so he
[1:23:33] asked him he said you know you you he
[1:23:36] said Sam he said how is it that I I up
[1:23:39] until I was 25 I ate carrots and
[1:23:41] potatoes and beef and chicken and and I
[1:23:45] drank water and put all these nutrients
[1:23:46] and vegetables and he said and it kept
[1:23:48] building blood cells and I kept getting
[1:23:50] stronger and I kept getting stronger I
[1:23:51] kept growing kept growing he said and
[1:23:53] then I passed 20
[1:23:55] and he said I'm still eating the same
[1:23:57] chicken and beef and corn and potatoes
[1:23:59] and carrots and I'm still doing the same
[1:24:00] thing but I'm dying now I'm putting it
[1:24:03] in it's like I'm pouring it in a glass
[1:24:05] and it's just running out faster than I
[1:24:07] can pour it in and and Dr Adair told him
[1:24:09] said well Billy if we could answer that
[1:24:11] we'd understand the medical secret of
[1:24:13] life itself see so so you find that that
[1:24:17] with a good diet and physical fitness
[1:24:19] you can slow its effect and improve your
[1:24:21] quality of life while you're aging but
[1:24:24] you're still moving on
[1:24:27] Amen it's hard for young people to get
[1:24:29] their mind around that but as you get
[1:24:31] older you start thinking about that and
[1:24:34] I I I know there will be a people who
[1:24:36] are will be alive and remain when Christ
[1:24:39] comes and they'll never see death in the
[1:24:41] body and and and I'm and I'm trying to
[1:24:44] get there myself and I hope to I'd love
[1:24:47] to be alive and remain at the coming of
[1:24:50] the Lord hallelujah see but but but you
[1:24:55] know I I I know that I'm I'm living my
[1:24:58] last promised
[1:25:00] 10 you're you know the promised 70 I'm
[1:25:03] in my last 10 if I live all the way out
[1:25:05] to the promise and I might exceed that
[1:25:07] my dad did my mom has my brother didn't
[1:25:11] see I know many a 16-year-old never made
[1:25:14] it to
[1:25:15] 17 many famous people they just had a
[1:25:17] famous one in the news recently dead at
[1:25:20] 50 another one another one another one
[1:25:23] this famous movie star this famous
[1:25:25] sports star this famous person this
[1:25:27] politician and they lived out their
[1:25:29] whole life and ran like crazy and then
[1:25:31] they
[1:25:33] died as Melia Jackson said what
[1:25:36] then what then what are you going to do
[1:25:38] then when the preacher when you've heard
[1:25:40] the preacher preach the last sermon
[1:25:42] you'll hear what
[1:25:45] then you know when when when everything
[1:25:47] is finished and it's all said and done
[1:25:49] what then see and so a lot of times they
[1:25:52] don't they don't think enough ahead you
[1:25:54] know I I was showing you here uh Serv
[1:25:57] service or so ago that I mean 70 years
[1:26:01] is only 3600 weeks a little over 3652
[1:26:05] weeks I mean what's 3600 weeks it was
[1:26:07] just last week the other day and and
[1:26:09] weeks go by like that and you only get
[1:26:12] 3,600 of them what are you doing with
[1:26:13] your
[1:26:14] life see so you
[1:26:19] know what if you didn't need to worry
[1:26:21] about an expiration date
[1:26:24] oh some expiration date of my body I
[1:26:27] don't have to worry about it because I
[1:26:29] I'll I'll I'll try to stay fit I'll try
[1:26:32] to stay healthy that way I improve my
[1:26:34] quality of life but I'm not worried
[1:26:36] about it's going to finally go down to
[1:26:38] the ground because there's an inner life
[1:26:39] in me a different me uh that's far more
[1:26:43] real far more important and that and
[1:26:46] that me is is being purged of death and
[1:26:49] is being filled up with
[1:26:52] life Hallelujah I'm trying to fill this
[1:26:54] body with life but it's full of death
[1:26:56] but I got an inner man that I'm filling
[1:26:59] it up with life and it's pushing death
[1:27:05] aside
[1:27:07] Hallelujah even as your flesh is is
[1:27:10] aging out you've started moving forward
[1:27:12] to more life every dayl amen it's
[1:27:16] reversing course
[1:27:18] yes when I thought about it like that
[1:27:21] then I take the words of the Lord and
[1:27:23] the chapter of Matthew fear none of them
[1:27:27] which kill the body but are able to kill
[1:27:30] the soul uh but are not able I'm sorry
[1:27:33] let me read again and fear not them
[1:27:35] which kill the body but are not able to
[1:27:37] kill the soul you don't fear that but
[1:27:41] rather fear him which is able to destroy
[1:27:44] both soul and Body in hell I'm going to
[1:27:47] tell you something friends I decided to
[1:27:50] stop dying and start living that's why I
[1:27:53] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:27:56] now I'm a human being and I might be
[1:27:59] dying of natural causes but I'm also
[1:28:02] living by a new natural cause I've had a
[1:28:07] nature change and no one forces me to
[1:28:09] live like a Christian should I'm living
[1:28:12] by natural
[1:28:16] causes when my mind was enmity against
[1:28:19] God if yours is still enmity against God
[1:28:23] you're not living by you're not living
[1:28:25] eternal life by natural causes you're
[1:28:27] forcing yourself to do it in
[1:28:30] legalism but when you're born again now
[1:28:33] although this flesh is still perishing I
[1:28:36] don't live after the life of the outer
[1:28:38] man I live after the life of the inward
[1:28:42] man see you you you I mean listen this
[1:28:46] is why we have the promises of God you
[1:28:48] can't effectively work uh effectively
[1:28:51] for the Lord if you're sick and so I am
[1:28:55] the god that Health all thy
[1:28:57] diseases if you're sick in your body if
[1:29:00] you're sick you can't effectively serice
[1:29:02] serve god with a nervous breakdown I I
[1:29:05] think of sister Brenda Lewis when she
[1:29:07] wrote we've got rights in the Holy
[1:29:10] Spirit you've been given full Authority
[1:29:13] in his name there's no time now left for
[1:29:17] there's no time left now for crying and
[1:29:20] it's a shame to complain kick the devil
[1:29:24] fall off of your Mountain you're
[1:29:26] predestined and ordained don't you know
[1:29:29] that you're a soldier in the army of the
[1:29:34] [Applause]
[1:29:37] king Hallelujah that's an end time word
[1:29:40] that sister Brenda gave the Bride of the
[1:29:43] Lord Jesus
[1:29:45] Christ when we come to I want to turn
[1:29:49] the corner and race for home you still
[1:29:53] good you know when Paul comes to our
[1:29:57] text in in Philippians 4 where we were
[1:30:01] previously and I'm not going to reread
[1:30:03] it but where we were rejoice in the lord
[1:30:06] always remember I say rejoice let your
[1:30:08] gentleness and the Lord is at hand and
[1:30:10] all of that be anxious for nothing uh
[1:30:12] the peace of God which surpasses
[1:30:15] understanding will guard your hearts
[1:30:16] Minds you remember that remember us
[1:30:17] reading that so when when we're looking
[1:30:20] at it like this you know Paul PA
[1:30:25] literally gave the the church real
[1:30:30] ammunition you know real positive
[1:30:34] exhortations they they all result in the
[1:30:38] maintenance of Peace in the body so the
[1:30:40] so the Saints can work together
[1:30:42] effectively as partners in the gospel
[1:30:44] amen because that's what you're called
[1:30:46] to see and and that's what the new birth
[1:30:49] brings you into a partnership you were
[1:30:52] Heirs of God but now you're join AES
[1:30:55] with Christ you're a partaker see you're
[1:30:59] a partaker amen you get me so so we find
[1:31:05] then that that he gives these five
[1:31:08] positive exhortations in our reading and
[1:31:10] we're not going to go back and try to
[1:31:12] break it all down but but just I want to
[1:31:15] say this statement again they result in
[1:31:17] the maintaining of peace in your life if
[1:31:19] you're born again by the spirit of God
[1:31:22] there's a way to keep peace in your life
[1:31:24] am there's and I'm talking about in your
[1:31:26] body and healing in your body and
[1:31:27] healing in your mind and and that way
[1:31:30] you can work effectively as partners in
[1:31:32] the gospel even in even in the midst of
[1:31:35] unbelief even in the midst of Satan's
[1:31:38] Eden see God hasn't left us without a
[1:31:41] remedy so I mean you have goodness we
[1:31:46] have what they had we have the
[1:31:48] antagonism of
[1:31:50] unbelievers we have the woke Community
[1:31:53] against us us if if if if we went out
[1:31:56] here on the street trying to preach some
[1:31:58] of the things that I'm preaching in my
[1:31:59] Pulpit I got a little bit of protection
[1:32:01] here the law will allow us to preach it
[1:32:04] here and not allow them to come in here
[1:32:06] and try to disrupt us and if they do
[1:32:08] brother Luther and brother Tony will
[1:32:10] drag them out legally see but now if I
[1:32:14] go down on the public Street and start
[1:32:15] doing this then they've got a right to
[1:32:17] stand on the other corner and hold up
[1:32:19] their signs see and so so and I'm not
[1:32:23] saying we shouldn't do we've held
[1:32:24] outdoor meetings and might again but the
[1:32:26] point I'm making is that there's an
[1:32:29] antagonism of unbelievers in the world
[1:32:31] on the outside and we you can't escape
[1:32:34] that and it it's just here it's Satan's
[1:32:36] Eden but greater is he that's in me than
[1:32:38] he that's in the
[1:32:39] world see I mean it's it's bad enough
[1:32:43] let me say this now I'm probably going
[1:32:45] to quiet you down with this one but it
[1:32:48] it's bad enough that we have
[1:32:50] antagonism from
[1:32:52] without among unbelievers but then you
[1:32:56] know you have the attacks from legalist
[1:32:58] on the
[1:32:59] inside I mean right right in the ranks
[1:33:02] of God's family thankfully we've cut the
[1:33:04] head of that thing off at bethl
[1:33:06] Tabernacle years ago and then it took me
[1:33:08] many more years to get it purged out of
[1:33:09] the bloodstream that's why we have a
[1:33:12] church that just Schism can never get
[1:33:14] started say better be careful the devil
[1:33:16] hear that he already knows it he already
[1:33:19] knows we're lovers of the word that
[1:33:20] we're all together we're all in this
[1:33:22] together he already knows it's all for
[1:33:24] one and one for all that's how we
[1:33:27] roll that's my speech that everybody
[1:33:30] gets when they're going to think about
[1:33:31] moving here is you better be real cuz if
[1:33:34] you're not bethl will see right through
[1:33:36] it and you'll never fit in just let your
[1:33:38] hair down take your facade off and just
[1:33:41] be who you are we'll love you we'll
[1:33:43] respect you if you got problems we'll
[1:33:45] pray with you we got problems
[1:33:49] too pretense we hate that
[1:33:52] here see and so you've got antagonism
[1:33:56] from the beli the unbelieving world
[1:33:57] outside you get attacks from legalists
[1:34:00] on the inside we have the shame that we
[1:34:03] have to bear uh from irresponsible
[1:34:07] supposed to be fervent believers who
[1:34:09] live in open
[1:34:11] carnality told you you'd get
[1:34:14] quiet amen
[1:34:17] sure have the antagonism of Believers
[1:34:20] have the antagonism of unbelievers
[1:34:22] outside
[1:34:24] our ranks
[1:34:25] the attacks from legalists on the
[1:34:29] inside the shame that we have to bear
[1:34:32] from
[1:34:33] irresponsible supposed to be fervent
[1:34:36] believers who live in open carnality
[1:34:38] amen and as if stupidity hasn't reached
[1:34:41] its height posted online for the world
[1:34:43] to
[1:34:45] see I'm going to say like brother Donnie
[1:34:48] some people are too dumb to be on
[1:34:50] Facebook that's right that's amusing but
[1:34:53] it's the
[1:34:55] truth they bring shame on the gospel
[1:34:57] bring shame on Jesus personally who has
[1:35:00] done so much for
[1:35:05] them that's what that's how I get when I
[1:35:08] have brought shame on the Lord when I
[1:35:10] have lived carnally I say Lord how can
[1:35:12] you even still love me you've done so
[1:35:15] much for me do you ever feel like that
[1:35:18] for you to say Lord I'm so sorry for my
[1:35:21] carnality you've done so much for
[1:35:26] me so then of course you you get Satan
[1:35:29] always trying to stir up friction among
[1:35:32] members in a church you're always going
[1:35:34] to have that Paul said in 2 Corinthians
[1:35:36] 7:5 we were troubled on every side
[1:35:39] without were fightings within were fears
[1:35:43] so Paul's remedy was then as it is now
[1:35:46] rejoice in the Lord that's where we read
[1:35:50] in Philippians verse in fact is if you
[1:35:53] go home today and you read verse eight
[1:35:55] where we didn't read but it the opening
[1:35:57] word is finally so I realized that the
[1:36:00] context of vers of verses four five 6 7
[1:36:04] and 8 are are are the Holy Spirit
[1:36:08] emphasizing this is what you're going to
[1:36:10] need to do especially when it's
[1:36:13] finally especially when you're at the
[1:36:15] end time you're going to need to rejoice
[1:36:17] in the lord
[1:36:20] always see so these are inred obedience
[1:36:24] for overcoming The Darkness at the end
[1:36:26] time rejoice in the lord always you
[1:36:28] can't listen you can't do that with the
[1:36:32] you you you you know you can't do that
[1:36:33] without the life sustaining presence of
[1:36:36] God in your heart it's
[1:36:38] impossible sister hope you all have a
[1:36:40] safe trip God bless you they're having
[1:36:42] to leave early Jeff good to have you
[1:36:43] buddy God bless you I've got to catch
[1:36:48] flight there's no way Rejoice always in
[1:36:51] the lord always there's no way to to to
[1:36:55] do that without the life sustaining
[1:36:57] presence of God in your
[1:36:59] heart it's impossible friends you can't
[1:37:02] hold up you you can't keep the you know
[1:37:05] you you you get you get like you see you
[1:37:08] see this happen to people where if you
[1:37:11] look in the Book of Revelation this is
[1:37:12] off off the beaten path today I was
[1:37:15] covering this on my recent Bible study
[1:37:17] online that when you look at the church
[1:37:20] ages you found that that that white
[1:37:23] horse riders showed up with deceit in
[1:37:25] that first age and they were aimed at
[1:37:28] but then they relaxed and they lost
[1:37:30] their first love so that was the first
[1:37:31] effect of the deception they lost their
[1:37:34] first
[1:37:35] love and then the next the next Church
[1:37:38] age which was Smyrna meant
[1:37:40] bitterness and then the Third Church age
[1:37:43] pergam meant married see and so it's
[1:37:47] just like in the Garden of Eden you have
[1:37:48] Eve and she's already got a husband but
[1:37:51] Satan deceives her into taking a
[1:37:52] different husband amen and sometimes and
[1:37:55] that's what happens in churches that
[1:37:57] that people they they come to Christ
[1:37:59] thinking that this is really him and
[1:38:01] then they find out that they've believed
[1:38:03] some denominational theory that doesn't
[1:38:05] add up and the Holy Ghost won't have
[1:38:06] nothing to do with it and then what
[1:38:08] happens they they they they realize
[1:38:10] they've never came to Christ in a new
[1:38:12] birth they they're married to some other
[1:38:14] guy they thought was Jesus you remember
[1:38:17] Paul said that was his fear that you
[1:38:19] would follow another Jesus whom I have
[1:38:21] not preached amen and they they end up
[1:38:24] with a false Jesus and then what happens
[1:38:27] they get bitter they get disillusioned
[1:38:29] they lose their first love they get
[1:38:31] angry they get resentful and the next
[1:38:33] thing you know they're off marrying
[1:38:34] somebody else in
[1:38:36] adultery there's no way to sustain it
[1:38:38] friends you've got to have the
[1:38:39] lifegiving stream of the Holy Ghost down
[1:38:42] in your heart you must be born again see
[1:38:46] and that that's exactly why you have the
[1:38:48] world uh you know the world's view when
[1:38:52] they would say re Rejoice always really
[1:38:55] you know what what an what an absurd
[1:38:57] notion you're going to Rejoice even in
[1:38:59] bad in bad times and to them it's almost
[1:39:02] Preposterous given the realities of what
[1:39:05] they see on the news Well I see what
[1:39:07] they see on the news but I still Rejoice
[1:39:10] always I know the world thinks I'm nuts
[1:39:12] and that's okay because the I've got the
[1:39:15] comfort of the Holy Spirit and that is a
[1:39:18] fuel to my faith we've got the shout of
[1:39:22] a king in the camp I know the world is
[1:39:25] falling apart but I've got a king in the
[1:39:28] camp I've got the love that passes all
[1:39:31] understanding I've got peace in my
[1:39:35] heart prophecy shows us that at this
[1:39:38] time Satan's Eden the mind that that
[1:39:41] that that as I said earlier you also
[1:39:43] have the mind of God the mind that was
[1:39:46] in Christ Jesus has given to his family
[1:39:49] to sustain
[1:39:52] them I hope I've made my case today I'm
[1:39:55] going to finish it with two Psalms
[1:39:58] sister Esther let's first start in
[1:39:59] Psalms

[1:45:05] heart cuz the nature you're born with is
[1:45:08] no good you're dying let's bow our heads
[1:45:13] father I've so enjoyed bringing this
[1:45:17] thought today it's been a long time
[1:45:19] coming and I've been thinking about it
[1:45:21] for quite a while and I I really feel
[1:45:25] like that the Holy Spirit guided it
[1:45:28] along and I believe it was received
[1:45:30] father with Open Hearts and Minds now
[1:45:33] Lord maybe there's someone
[1:45:37] here who would just say brother Jason
[1:45:41] I uh I I do have a love for God but I'm
[1:45:46] not so sure that I have the love of God
[1:45:50] and I want you to pray that the Lord
[1:45:52] will move me in that direction you want
[1:45:54] to raise up your hand to the Lord right
[1:45:55] now say father move me in that direction
[1:45:59] where I don't just have a love for you
[1:46:00] but I have a I actually have your love I
[1:46:03] have your life the Bible says that the
[1:46:05] love of God is poured into us by the
[1:46:08] Holy Ghost that's the only way it comes
[1:46:11] friends young people heads
[1:46:13] bowed if you are wondering
[1:46:18] today do I have it how do I know I have
[1:46:21] it don't don't chase some precon
[1:46:22] conceived notion stop chasing that you
[1:46:26] need an experience but the experience
[1:46:28] that you need is to come to God that's
[1:46:31] part of your experience come to God and
[1:46:33] say Lord change my whole life change my
[1:46:36] whole heart make me a new creation in
[1:46:38] Christ Jesus I Repent of all my sins all

[1:46:44] want to be you I want you to live inside
[1:46:47] my heart the Lord will do that young
[1:46:48] person you don't have to come and look
[1:46:51] for some preconceived whatever how
[1:46:53] however however God whatever happens to
[1:46:56] you at that initial moment and it might
[1:46:58] surprise you but somewhere down the road
[1:47:00] you might experience some of those
[1:47:01] things you were chasing at the initial
[1:47:03] moment but the Lord has a life-changing
[1:47:07] experience ready for you if you're ready
[1:47:09] to accept it you don't have to fret over
[1:47:12] it or struggle all you have to do is
[1:47:15] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ repent
[1:47:18] of all your sins take his name take his
[1:47:21] life let him be the Lord of all your
[1:47:23] life may allow him to completely change
[1:47:27] you totally From the Inside Out the Lord
[1:47:30] is faithful to do that oh my and then
[1:47:34] you talking about feelings and
[1:47:36] Sensations that can come on as you grow
[1:47:39] in as you grow in Christ as you learn to
[1:47:43] draw near and your prayer life increases
[1:47:45] and you just get lost in the Lord oh
[1:47:48] every day the sun is brighter every day
[1:47:51] the breezes are warmer every day you're
[1:47:53] closer to Zion than when you first begun
[1:47:56] the love you have for God down the road
[1:47:58] is almost
[1:47:59] incomparable L to to love that you had
[1:48:03] at that initial moment loving the Lord
[1:48:06] is the most beautiful thing having the
[1:48:09] love of God in your life and the beauty
[1:48:11] of Holiness having a Sanctified mind and
[1:48:14] a clean heart something yes you still
[1:48:18] have a weaknesses in your flesh but now
[1:48:20] you've got a strength that can overcome
[1:48:22] them all you got to do is grow it all
[1:48:23] you got to do is build it all you got to
[1:48:25] do is add to it strengthen it the Lord
[1:48:28] the Holy Ghost feeds on the word of God
[1:48:31] draw yourself into his presence daily
[1:48:34] love him with without reservation don't
[1:48:36] hold back if you hold back anything in
[1:48:38] your repentance he will not seal you but
[1:48:39] he absolutely will not you cannot you
[1:48:42] cannot come to him 99% you have to have
[1:48:45] 100% repentance or or all the devil will
[1:48:49] do is he'll just back into his castle
[1:48:51] roll up his draw Breck and wait you out
[1:48:54] and that one little percent that you
[1:48:56] left there unsurrendered to God when
[1:48:59] it's all said and done and the the music
[1:49:01] is ended and the hoopla is over and
[1:49:03] you're no longer excited he'll just
[1:49:06] lower his drawbridge Walk Right Back
[1:49:08] across and start on that one point you
[1:49:10] left uncommitted to God and he'll just
[1:49:12] build his whole Kingdom right back from
[1:49:14] that it's got to be repentance thorough
[1:49:18] complete repentance you've got to mean
[1:49:21] business with God God that you are no
[1:49:24] longer wanting to be of this world you
[1:49:26] want to be a Christian full of the faith
[1:49:31] and virtue of the Holy Ghost it's a
[1:49:34] definite experience and you can have it
[1:49:37] today Lord I pray having delivered this
[1:49:40] message I feel the Holy Spirit has
[1:49:42] delivered it clearly
[1:49:45] unambiguously and Lord I pray that you
[1:49:47] will now move on hearts and Minds if
[1:49:49] anyone who doesn't know you in the power
[1:49:51] of your Resurrection may they know you
[1:49:53] that way today not only in your power
[1:49:56] but your power and your Resurrection May

[1:50:08] and be resurrected like you were
