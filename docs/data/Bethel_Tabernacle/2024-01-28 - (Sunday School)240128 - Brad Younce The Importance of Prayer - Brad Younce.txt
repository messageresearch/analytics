TRANSCRIPT
========================================
father we just thank you for this opportunity Lord to come back in your presence Lord in your house together with people that believe the same way father Lord I just pray that you just be with us today Father you see what I have before me may you anoint my lips father anoint their ears father may we get a benefit of being here today Father may you be with the rest of the service the the singing the special singing the most of all the minister in the word father I pray may we place this service today into your hands in Jesus name I want to read in uh one scripture to start with in uh James chapter 5 I'll read verse 16 it says confess your faults one to another pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much you may have your seats put a title to this I want to put under the title the importance of prayer you know prayer is the most important thing in our life you know we can't live without it you know like food and you got to eat to live you got to drink to live you got to rest sleep to live that's important we need that as as human beings but as Spiritual Beings we need prayer prayer more than anything prayer is the most important thing in our life you know we need we need prayer to survive you know you can eat too much you can drink too much you can sleep too much you can talk too much you can shop too much but you can never pray too much 1 Thessalonians 5:17 says pray without ceasing as to pray to pray and to pray again it's praying all day long it's when you're at Walmart even when you're at Walmart you got a prayer on your heart that's what prayer you don't have to need to be on your knees to be to be praying without ceasing you know when you're cleaning house when you're cooking you got a prayer on your heart we're praying pray without ceasing but what is prayer I know this is going to be simple but it's good to be reminded every now and then prayer is giving our attention to God in a two-way spiritual Rel relationship where we talk to God and we listen we're not doing all the Talking you we know people that way you have a conversation with people and you barely can get a word in you know what I'm talking about you barely can get a word in so what's what we don't need to be doing that with God when we're praying it's a two-way conversation it's like a kid it's like your child they come to you they want come for advice they're W to ask for something I need a new pair of shoes they're coming to you asking that's what we need to come to God asking God for things it's our conversation with him but we got to have to stop long enough to hear God's response sometimes we don't we just want to pray pray pray pray pray pray and we get up and okay I got my prayer in for a day and I'm done what we need to do is kind of wait you know be like Elijah waiting there for something because sometimes God ain't going to come in a fire god ain't going to come in a storm but he's going to come in that still Small Voice we just sit silent long enough we'll be able to hear from him we just want to pause long enough that we can hear him speak you know you heard that saying that it used to be a Sweet Hour of Prayer it's now turned into a little talk with Jesus prayer is like a child's conversation I just said that what's it mean to pray pray is to intreat or implore it's often used in introducing a question a request or a plea to get or bring by praying what do you have need of praying brings it on to make a request in a humble manner it's not getting up there when you get on your knees God I need this right now God's just going to sit back and let you just go you can't demand God of what you want we he he ain't going to answer us if we start demanding acting like we're all something but humble manner to address god with adoration confession supplication Thanksgiving Worship in that little list I didn't hear anything I didn't read anything about asking yet sometimes that's what we do I'm guilty a lot of times we'll sit there especially if you have a need it's pressing you'll start your prayer father I love love you Lord I need Lord can I have this right now I need this I need that I need this but there's an approach to God it's not Our Father which art in Heaven this is what I want Matthew 6:5 he's going to tell us how to pray when thou prayest Thou shalt not be as the Hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men because verily I say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet amen and when thou H has shut the door if you don't have a closet big enough it's not necessarily be a closet you just get in and shut the world out amen turn off your phones turn off the internet turn off everything get in a quiet place with God get away from family get away from your husband get away from your wife get away from your children get back in there behind the holiest of holies where God could speak to us where it's just be just you and God that's what happens when the priest when they went behind the veil they took the needs of all the people they crossed behind that Veil it was just them and God Amen pray through is praying until you get the victory I tried to find the quote I I don't think I was typing it in right but you hear preachers say it all the time brother BR says that a Christian should pray through every day amen amen what's praying through praying through until you get the victory over something praying through until you get an answer to a problem if you got a even if you got a question about this message is it right or wrong get in your closet and pray until God reveals it to you hallelujah what they need is an old fash said what they need is an oldfashioned prayer altar where they pray until they pray through until they lose themselves come and pro God's provided way until they free themselves from the world am again he's talking about the children of Israel if they faed to eat the Mana they died if we fail to eat on the Holy Ghost we die if we fail to pray through daily wow there it is put that in this morning I didn't even recognize it if we fail to pray through daily all the time keep under the blood you'll wither up and die in your Christian experience he says he's living where the man is fresh all the time where it isn't a burden to get out and pray through today pray through tomorrow brother stay with him all the time in the holiest of holies can a person live that way absolutely he says that's what Jesus died for when thou prayest enter into thy closet when thou has shut the door pray to the Father which is in secret and thy father which in seeth in secret shall reward thee openly but when you pray use not vain repetition which is stuttering we get that way sometimes we said well I got to pray you're like I don't really know what to say and you get down there and you just start don't even make any sense amen if y'all not like that pray for me to stutter or repeat say the same things over and over we find ourselves doing that Lord father forgive me of my sins and you'll go pray father forgive me my sins pray father forgive me my sins you don't ask once that's all you need to ask well that's all right brother JD will be back next week to use many Idle Words the words we use have tremendous power the Bible says that life and death are in the power of the tongue you know I believe our prayers would have more power and a greater anointing when our everyday life is filled with words that can uplift and bring Grace to others wow Power of Words we have so much power that whatever we say will come to pass amen ask what you will when you pray and it shall be done Ephesians 4:29 sayso not let any UNH wholesome talk come out of your mouth but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs that it may benefit those who listen a holy life is powerful when it comes to seeing answers to prayer even Jesus had to submit because Hebrews 5:7 says during the days of Jesus life on Earth he offered up prayers and petitions with fervent cries and tears to the one who could save him from death and he was heard and he was heard because of his reverent submission Jesus had to submit himself to the father we're no different we're not special we even more so have to submit ourselves to the father if we submit ourselves to him we will see our prayers answered amen righteous living and right speech come from a right heart before God so it's important for all of us who want to have an effective prayer life is to watch our speech watch what we say okay we'll move on from that there's a lot of things you get in with a tongue but when you pray use not vain repetition has Heathen do for they think they shall be heard for they're much speaking we've heard that we've been in places me and my wife was somewhere not too long ago with a a brother who's you say one of the main Ministers of the message we was at this church where he was ministering and this brother gets up and prays and we're kind of looking at each other like what and is he trying to prove he was trying to be so elegant try to lift himself up make him sound like he was something we've seen it people pray so loud that nobody else can pray there's nothing wrong with that but are you doing it for the right reason amen are we praying for the right reason be not ye therefore like unto them for your father here it is your father knoweth what things you have need of even before you ask you know disciples like wow teach us to pray they they seen the Pharisees and the Sadducees and all those people that does stuff like that they seen them pray yeah so when Jesus comes and says this they're like uhoh we don't even know how to pray so teach us okay Jesus says well after this manner When you pray Our Father which are in heaven you start praising him Hallowed be thy name amen thy kingdom come thy will be done are we praying for his kingdom to come right we should be praying for his kingdom to come every day even so Lord Jesus come quick you haven't asked for a need yet thy will be done amen so you mean some of my prayers are not going to be answered thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven amen give us this day our daily bread did y'all get up this morning pray for the service this morning you can pray for your pastor give us this day our daily bread because he has spiritual food in due seasons for us forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespassed against us it says depths but it's the same thing we can't even forgive we can't ask God to forgive us until we forgive our brother my goodness and lead us not into temptation but Deliver us from evil Lord the devil's going to be sting a trap out for us he he does it every day but how many times has God steered you around that trap you may not have know it you're like why am I going this way why am I late for work why could I get my car started until later God looking out for you lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and he ends it with an amen that's there's your pattern for prayer that's a quick prayer you can add to it just pray this is this is your order right here of prayer James 5:13 it says is if any is any among you Afflicted let him pray is any Mary let him sing Psalms is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him amen anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of the faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he had committed sins they shall be forgiven him amen and then are open confess your faults one to another pray for one another that ye may may be healed because the effectual fervent effectual is producing or able to produce a desired effect fervent is to be active efficient are we efficient in our prayers to be operated to be at work to put forth power is your prayer full of power to work for one of the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man ath much aaop is to have to exercise force to be strong to have power to have power has shown by extraordinary Deeds so that's what a effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much amen if you're praying and you're a fervent prayer it's going to Avil you much yeah brother says the prayer of the faith shall save the sin an individual prayer the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much only if you knew that in your hand Christ has gave us the authority with his name by being Christians the most powerful weapon the world has ever known prayer it even changes everything amen it'll even change the mind of God you know I seen this the other day and I I just wrote it down just just one little line pray about it as much as you think about it if we have problems how how many how how long how many hours a day do we sit and think about that problem instead of think about just pray it just pray about it commit it to God brother said the prayer is the most powerful weapon that was placed in the control of the human beings and expectation he says prayer is the key it's the answer Prayer Changes Things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in control of the human being there's no atomic bomb or no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer amen you know how powerful atomic bomb is you know happened in World War II when they dropped that bomb over Japan it destroyed everything in its path that's what prayer is when you go down to your knees I don't care if you're the weakest Christians because we know when the weakest Christian gets down on their knees the devil trembles amen but what a weapon we have what are you praying about that's how much power you have you know we're like in B52 bombers we're loaded down with bombs I've read where this B52 they can carry up to 880,000 lbs of bombs at a time yeah and fly over 8,000 miles before they refuel so you're loaded down with bombs this morning your prayer will fly over the Enemy what is it you have need of what's bothering you what are you praying about if you got lust and you're praying about it fly over that let your prayer throw that and a bomb will drop and totally destroy it amen you got depression or anxiety just start praying God that prayer will fly over that and a bomb will drop on it and destroy it sickness will be destroyed but we don't use this weapon enough you know prayer will even change the mind of God prayer changes things we know the story about King Hezekiah he was sick God told Isaiah said hey go over there and tell that man that he's going to die so Isaiah goes up to the king says Hey King thus sayith the Lord you're going to die so what Hezekiah do he got out his pen and paper my last will in Testament I leave my entire Kingdom to my firstborn I leave my wife this I leave my kids this I no as soon as he got the word he turned his face to the wall and he prayed unto the Lord saying I beseech thee Oh Lord remember now how I have walked before thee in truth when with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and Hezekiah wept sore then the next verse says that it came to pass Isaiah hadn't even gotten his Chariot yet and got down the driveway and God says stop Isaiah turn around and go back in there that's how quick Prayer Changes Things Isaiah had already told him what God had said and Isaiah had even left the house yet because the Bible says he was he had got through the middle court before God stopped him go back there and tell him I'm will give him 15 more years but I thought God's will was for him to die oh he's going to die eventually but he asked God for 15 more he asked God to spare his life give him more time amen God says okay I'll give you 15 more years that's powerful we could be on our death bed we could be dying with cancer or whatever some kind of disease and our prayer can have so much power it can actually go to God and say oh I'm gonna give them a little more longer to live yeah they might be 95 but hey let's see if they can make it to 110 Lord I don't want to live to be 110 if I'm the way I am now I hate to see when I'm 100 but that's how quick prayer changes things you can never pray too much we can't be afraid to pray either remember Daniel we heard it Wednesday night they want to get Daniel for his prayer they won't get Daniel in trouble CU he's the favor of the king amen he said I don't care I if I pray I'm going to get in the lines then he'll just go right up open wide his window and said hey guys I'm fixing the pray watch me prayer saved him in the Lion's Den when they threw him in there they come up to him like little kittens and he's sitting there petting them they was just meowing did God told him you're going no I'm not you'll find yourself in the belly of a fish then Jonah says okay I'm going to pray now that's what we we do we wait till we get in trouble and then we start praying we wait until we get in trouble before we start praying John 14:14 says ye shall ask anything in my name I will do it when you pray he will do it prayer changes the mind of God you believe that God is wanting us to pray but there's things that you can do that God cannot do brother Caleb read this Wednesday night it's funny he sent it to me we talked about it at the the shower brother Caleb I said send me that quote because I'm I might do a thing on prayer on the Sunday school he sent it then he reads it Wednesday night it's okay he did a lot better job than what I'm going to do with it but I want to remind us what it says do you know there's some things that we have to do that God cannot do until we do it amen he says we're are the branches he's the vine but the vine can't bear fruit it's the branches that bear fruit is that right he furnishes the energy he gives you the ability but we've got to do the job you get what I mean the holy spirit's here as you see him each night and he knows you but the only way he speaks is through us is that right our hands are his hands our eyes are his eyes notice he gives us things so Jesus will stand there one day looking upon the Harvest do you believe do you believe he was the lord of the Harvest and he looked out upon the Harvest and said ye pray to the Lord of the Harvest he just telling disciples hey pray to me that I'll send Reapers to the field he's trying to tell them you you got something you need to do I mean I can do it God could do it but he wants you to do it he wants to use your mouth to pray When you pray believe that whatever you pray is going to happen that whatever you say is going to happen he says you ask the lord of the Harvest because the Harvest is ripe the labors are few in other words you ask me to do what I know ought to be done God knows it ought to be done God knows your need needs to be met he knows your sickness needs to be healed he he knows it but he just waiting on you to ask him simple thought the importance of prayer the most important thing in our life we can't we can't live without it am we've got to have it that'll be it for today 1057 y'all love the Lord very simple thought but we need it I need it we all need prayer every day pray without ceasing am God bless you [Music] [Music]
