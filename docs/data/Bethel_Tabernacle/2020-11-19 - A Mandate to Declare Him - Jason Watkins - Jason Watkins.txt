you in the name of the lord happy to have you out i don't say that just to say it i sincerely mean it amen we're happy to have you out on a wednesday night and uh amen i was getting a haircut today and some guy from up north said man it's as cold down here as it is where i'm from and i said no it's not don't even try it and i said besides it'll come in a few weeks from now maybe less than that i'd be back in the 60s again so we usually enjoy good indian summer all the way through december so amen praise the lord hebrews chapter 2 i want to take tonight and just begin a thought we're going to go um we're going to put start at verse 8 in hebrews chapter 2. i want to start a ser not a series but at least a two-part that i will get to part one of it tonight i want to take a mandate to declare him a mandate to declare him and as a subtitle tonight that we want to concentrate on because i'm going to enlarge on this whole thought on sunday lord willing but as a subtitle tonight i'd like to aim at certainty in a time of uncertainty i'm glad that there's a certainty even in a time of uncertainty amen and these are very uncertain times for the world quite a fearful time but my what a peace that the bride has in the word of god in this hour let's catch from chapter 2 verse 8. speaking of christ of course thou has put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one do you believe that amen i mean he's literally put you on the same boat with jesus all right all right for which cause he christ is not ashamed to call them that's us brethren saying quite catch it verse saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church i will sing praise unto thee let's bow our heads now master we thank you for this word now lord i'm just going as you've led me throughout the day lord i've had this thought simmering lord for some number of days and i felt the time was right lord to move into this material this evening so i pray now master you know who would be here you know he'd be listening you know what needs to be said i don't but you do so i i know that i have your inspiration upon me so i commit myself into your hands on this wednesday night lord we're going to go to prayer just in a little bit father and so we want to look into the word of god something to encourage our faith lord something to challenge us something to challenge us to believe every word of god master there must be a people there must be in this day and hour that we live in there must be a people who are not ashamed to declare the whole council of god to the world grant it to us master we desire it of thee in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated certainty in a time of uncertainty as my subtitle tonight on this um two-part at least a mandate to declare him so you know paul is making it clear that that jesus was going to make a declaration his whole life was a declaration and he declared a lot of things he declared you know his identity to the world some believed most did not he declared why he was here some believed a few but most didn't believe that they didn't accept the message uh his his declaration of who he was and why he had came now you know the world today is in a very great state of confusion and uncertainty fear perilous times the bible calls it and we know that men's hearts are even failing for the fear that they're in and you hear it today you hear it all over the news unsettling times and you know strange and uncertain times but you know it's it's interesting to me how that i was thinking about this you know you know this evening was just pondering this and i thought lord you know what it for me in my heart if i would really preach my heart tonight that's why i took the subtitle that right here in an age uh where everything is uncertain i want you to know there is a certainty there is a certainty that is among us you can enjoy it or not you can partake of it or not it's up to you if you wanna now here's what you can't escape perilous times you can't escape that you're the judgments are falling upon the world hey guess what you live here now we'd all like to already be gone in the rapture before covet 19 hit but we didn't we're here and it's here and here we are amen there's turmoil in the land social turmoil social unrest political unrest political turmoil they're they're you know they're in great fear today i was sitting in you know in the barbershop and well if you want to hear every kind of conversation sit in a barber shop and and and and so they were they were just you know going on about the political landscape and what we're looking at and and i tell you you know i i i even found myself sitting there saying my goodness what what might be about to happen because you know there are there are statements being made and on both sides all of them are making their statements and some of them are saying oh you know there's no evidence of this and the others are saying we got tons of evidence and you know i said well you'll have your day in court yeah we will have our day in court we'll find out you know and i sit there going my goodness wow am i ever glad i'm not living my life based on what this world is gonna you know they they figure that they can elect somebody and that's gonna solve all their problems and i'm already knowing it can't i'm already knowing that that that that's why i said to you on election day you know the day after i said i said my candidate won i voted for jesus and he voted for me and we both were elected to sit at a table thousands of miles long so i'm glad for that today i'm glad for the certainty of the word and you know it is a perplexing time i get it we're not you know making light you know men's hearts are indeed failing for fear we don't make light of that you know mankind is in a dark day and gross darkness is upon the people and so you know to me i'm not here to ridicule or make light or judge you know mankind humanity is in a sad state of affairs i you know i just say lord how can i help how can i help what good does it do me to tell them you know you got a problem if i don't have an answer and so you know i'd like to be able to walk up to a conversation and have an answer to say yeah you're right that's true that's going on this is real yeah that's not your imagination troubling times are everywhere but hey there is an answer to it and i happen to know what it is sit down and i'll tell you about it i'm glad for that friends i'm glad that we have not believed cunningly devised tales because you can be you can actually be in the truth and somewhere down the road the truth you started out with you end up in and it's just fables because it went off the rail you know and and very very often it's it's almost imperceptible in fact is in the scripture where it talks about people who were led you know led away from the truth and that's the sad part to me is that one time they were feasting on the truth and then you know it's turned into fables but actually if you look at the greek word between you know the greek word for fable is muthas and actually muthas and logos in the beginning mean the same thing they both mean word or thought expressed but then and when they're together they're in they're you know indistinguishable they're saying the same thing but a little ways downrange and and one starts to veer and you almost don't notice it and then a little further downrange it's a little more remember how brother bam talked about in target shooting and you're you're way up here you know with your rifle and your target is downrange 100 you know meters or 200 meters and you know if you're if you're just a half an inch up here by the time that thing gets downrange you might not even hit the target at all you might hit a tree and so you know it that that's how it ends up you you start on the truth and then you allow a little bit of variation and a little bit and it doesn't seem like a lot at first people get trapped in that and they they start to dabble into a little bit of carnality it's not harmful it's so kind of okay it's not out and right sinful i know it's not exactly spiritual well i'm here to tell you something friends keep going and downrange it'll be into something very very unspiritual because the devil you know one of the things that that that that i suppose we could say at least one thing that god and the devil share as an objective is to not leave you how they find you amen and one moves you upward and one moves you downward but both of them have an aim to move you both of them you know one of them loves you too much to leave you like you are and one of them despises you too much to leave you like you are and i'm here to tell you something friends there's only those two powers you're either influenced from above or from beneath and the world is overran with influence from below and that's why there's chaos it's not a secret why there's chaos it's not a mystery why there's madness on the streets and turmoil in this you know in the very framework of the nation and not just this nation the whole world amen it's not a mystery because they for so long have rejected god's word and god's way of doing it it was inevitable that we arrive where we've arrived both the world and the bride because we literally the world has literally fed and eaten their way to where they are because you are what you eat you assimilate it what you feed on and the world you know has fed on the anti-word for so long that they literally have assimilated anti-word for so long they've become manifested anti-word and that's why you're different you're not different because you got a book of laws or codes or rules has zero to do with that you you cannot uh stick peacock feathers in the tail of a black bird and call him a peacock he's still a black blackbird you've got to have a complete nature change and then it has nothing to do with rules it has everything to do with love has everything to do with your heart's desire being changed brother branham says in the adoption series a lengthy series that he preached in 1960 broke it into four lengthy parts but he makes this statement here and i'm going to come to this again on sunday perhaps not these exact quotes but moving from this direction he says now in genesis 2 when he made man so jehovah he says and now he starts talking about yahweh the the hebrew word i am uh yahoo of yahweh jehovah and he spells it out he says what did it mean here's what it means i am the all-existent one who created something off of myself see so so you you find you know that god how that he operated when he you know when he wanted to create fish he spoke to the sea amen when he wanted to create trees he spoke to the earth when he wanted to create man he turned to himself hallelujah you understand now he's going to bring something that is that is actually an expression of him he's going to he's going to extend or further himself into his creation it's all with a grand plan because he sees in his mind a whole economy a whole kingdom of saints a whole family governing a universe that defies even comprehending amen i sent a um a science article to brother mark here the other day and i said i said are you buckled up i said you're going to need to be because when i i read this it blew my mind i thought i was reading something wrong and uh when they literally now you know we talk about our milky way galaxy and you know how many some kid tell me how many planets we got well pluto got it taken out then it got put back in so it was a has been now it's a now it's a planet again and so you know you've got your mars and venus and earth and mercury and saturn and jupiter and pluto and uh maybe i'm forgetting one and yeah did that say mercury yeah okay now catch this you say wow you know we got a bunch of planets in the milky way and we know the milky way is one of the smallest galaxies well guess catch this now they have now discovered that just in our milky way i think the number was maybe 300 million earth-like planets in the milky way alone now we already know by science that there are more galaxies not planets galaxies there are more galaxies and here's one little one with 300 million planets there are more galaxies than all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the earth there's more galaxies that they can see than every grain of sand on all the beaches and this god back at the dawn before time even began created it spoke it and then conceived of a kingdom of saints that would that would be a an economy of god to say what are we going to do i don't know but i want to be there hallelujah you realize when you start thinking like that you start realizing how how insignificant you are and how little this little short vapor of a life really means i'm here to tell you something friends what are you living for and and i see people today and they're consumed they are consumed with the political landscape it's everything it's every waking moment and they're mad one minute and upset the next and mad again and upset the next and talk to one guy and they're ready to fight and talk to another guy and they're ready to have coffee and you know i mean my goodness i what a what a small life what a small life i my i i realized that that i i'm i'm did not just start here i'm not finishing here as i've said it so many times you know something friends uh god has a great plan and he has a family who he has given a mandate to declare that to the world that hey what you think about this life it ain't all that amen we have a mandate and we're the only ones who do only his family does every other voice trying to declare god is an illegitimate voice it is unauthorized it is illegitimate and it has no it has no because it doesn't speak by revelation the only one that can speak by revelation is somebody with a gene of almighty god and you're speaking from your gene pool you're speaking from experience you're speaking from nature and so we find here he says watch now watch this it's going to really bend your mind so here's the all existence one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or amateur little one of mine glory why he gave man jehovah means he gave man to be an amateur god amen amen [Music] amen what because he is father god and he made a man an amateur god so he so he isn't self-existing anymore he exists with his family see and so jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family god made to be the predominant over all the earth he had dominion the earth was man's dominion is that scripture then if that's his dominion he was god over the earth he could speak it be so he could um uh whatever he would he would speak this and it would be so old there is god jehovah the one who once existed in self-existence but now exists with his family and his little ones with him he so he says there you are so so how did i get here that's the question how did i get you say well you know i was the son of of this man and this woman who were the sons of this man and this woman who were the sons you know and i would just simply say to you that is such a shallow understanding of how you got here and why you're here and what you do no wonder people don't catch what they're to be doing because they don't have a concept of even how they got here and they think i came here by natural procreation you're here because you were one of his little ones you were one of his little ones and i get that there's a whole creation of humanity and there are background players and god gives them all a chance for salvation but he has an elect family that is spun off of himself an expression of himself and he's making a declaration jesus made a declaration now you're making a declaration amen every day in your life when the world is in fear and you're not you're declaring amen every day when they are in despair but you've got faith you're declaring amen every day when they're angry and nasty and you're kind and pleasant you're declaring amen every day when they're having panic over wall street or panic over the congress or panic over some foreign nation and you know what while the world i don't i don't tell you some friends if if suddenly if suddenly we had a interruption you know what is that emergency broadcasting and all of a sudden you're listing or radio or watching this is an emergency broadcast and you know we have satellite confirmation that icbm missiles are headed toward america right now and they will be here in 12 minutes i would go wow 11 minutes to the rapture nice amen and the world be running around screaming we have 12 minutes to live i go no i got 11 minutes and i'm out of here hallelujah because i already know by a prophet before the first bomb ever falls i'm gone hallelujah friends say if they told me tomorrow this is what we can know by the word if they told me we have passed a law tomorrow and now the world council of churches is going to take over at noon tomorrow and you won't be able to buy or sell except you belong to the world council i'd say hey church we're going home tomorrow because i already know the bride don't see that fulfillment she's already gone in the rapture and and for this kind of thinking the world thinks you're crazy and and we think they're crazy and we kind of giggle and go yeah who's crazy now so we find out that there's such a contrast you know i i so appreciated some statements brother diggs made last time he was hearing we was talking about how that moses followed the teaching of his mother you know he chose that you remember that over egypt's teaching he had the wisdom of egypt in one ear and his mother and another ear but you're a special child you're chosen you're a deliverer and brother diggs brought out how that he followed he followed the teaching it's one thing to say this is what i believe well let me see what you do moses actually took footsteps and he put action so now when moses said you know when the bible says that he looked out upon him and you know he he counted the sufferings of christ of greater value than all the riches of egypt that wasn't just fancy words moses didn't just write that in some declaration moses life declared that he actually put took footsteps and actually moved out and actually intervened and tried to bring their freedom of course in a human way he couldn't do it and had to run for his life but but he was god's man and god got a hold of him and they got delivered see and so so we find out that that he followed the teaching of his mother over egypt over egypt's teaching because that's who he really was and that's what brother diggs was bringing out and so he says you know we couldn't abide you know uh you know the denominations of the world i i couldn't i couldn't abide a baptist lodge or a methodist lodge or a catholic lodge or upc lodge because that's not who i was why do you have to have the message because that's who i am is that because it's eagle food and i am an eagle and i'm sorry but i can't eat the carrion of the world and so you know he he he forsook all the comforts of egypt to suffer with christ and i here today i'm here to tell you that nobody makes me nobody denies me the comforts of laodicea i could have all of them that i want i have means and resources that i could i could tap into all the comforts but i don't want those comforts i choose nobody makes it makes me do it i choose to renounce the comforts of this life because i count the sufferings of christ to be of greater value say why do you do that are you crazy i'm crazy by the world standards because i don't think like them i don't act like them i don't want to act like them i don't react like them because it's almost always our reactions that get us in trouble more than our actions no one sets out no real christian gets up in the morning and go wow i think i'm going to go tie one on and sin and really have a you know really go off the rails today you know we don't determine that action but a lot of times the devil comes in sets something there's a certain contact a certain thing you hear it you see it you're right there and now what is your reaction to it amen see and so brother branham says here in the uh in the in the fourth seal and i i uh where he talks about how that he says you know in the third seal we had him we had him coming last night let me catch it he says now we had him coming last night that was in the third seal this is now in the fourth seal he said we had him coming last night with his great sword to kill we find out that he gets killed with the sword too the sword of the word i'm going to large on that sunday i don't want to go too deep into it tonight but god's word sharp two-edged sword remember that it's a two-edged sword all right slays him that's the devil puts him right down and he says wait to them seven thunders utter their voices to that group who really can take the word of god and hand it there now this goes a little bit into the ministry of moses and elijah because he says it'll slice and cut and they can close the heavens and they can do this whatever they want and when he gets to the sixth seal he makes it clear that that's the ministry of moses and elijah which we're not here for so so don't don't mix up our ministry with their ministry okay i'm just just making that point but but there is a group who are here now when the seventh under mystery out of the seals is being made known it is being declared say oh is it is it some some lesson some sermon some great bible teachers teaching it no it's being declared behind skin the seven thunder mystery is being declared in people and that's what makes it undeniable because you can argue it and debate theology but you cannot debate you cannot argue against the literal life of almighty god you might not want it but you can't defeat it because the life proves what it is even the devil that's that's it i've said this before it must be terribly perplexing to the devil that the more trials he puts on you the stronger you get and the more sorrow and sadness he hits you with the greater your faith i mean can you imagine trying to plan for that can you imagine that you're the you're the devil and you've got to go how can i get this person you know to to renounce god i'm gonna i'm gonna torture him and the more he pours it on the higher the more they praise god and then he backs off and god blesses them he says well let's do the opposite let's let them get a blessing and then they get a blessing and then they realize that's god and then they rejoice in that as well i'm here to tell you some friends the devil could actually win if it wasn't for losing and that's the old statement you can't win for losing and i say you could actually win oh boy if you weren't losing but guess what he's losing on me he's losing on you because god's already won i've already made my decision god's already made his decision my life is here to be a declaration of this word and i'm not interested in declaring for hollywood i'm not interested in being a billboard for them i'm not interested in being a billboard for for uh spoiled rich ballplayers i'm not interested in being a billboard for them i'd like to be a billboard for the word of god i'd like for people to see that something is real and it's not just a it's not just a testimony from the mouth all right go to this church i belong to that church i've done this i've done that i'd you shouldn't even have to open your mouth your whole life should be a declaration of god i was thinking you know and brother branham says here he says now this group that can handle it i love the fact that he said it that way who can really take the word of god and hand it there not handle it in other words you know let me give it to you like this the other day brother mark came to my house and he was installing something for sister debbie and she broke her lazy susan and i said honey you can't pow you know 9 000 cans on the back of it you got to distribute out she said but then we figured out it was 20 years old and so she deserved to break it and get a new one so brother mark is there and he come quickly and he brought a drill but it was the wrong one a little impact drill and he he needed a big house of a nice drill we were gonna drill and we're gonna put some piece of trims up and i said hey you want to drill it he goes yeah all i got is i said oh i got a drill and so i go out to my i have so many things that i probably never use except when somebody comes that knows how to use them and so i go out there and i get my drill and i bring it in and i open up and brother mark takes it in his hand now here's a real craftsman here's a man who knows this tool to me it's yellow it goes around and around you can you can tighten it's a screw or a screwdriver or drill into it and drill something if your fingers out of the way and brother mark holds that up and he goes whoa dewalt and i'm like yeah that's right is that good oh yeah oh yeah that's right yeah i know it's good and i just thought you know what it what it means to be the right kind of tool in the hand of a man who knows how to use it i felt glad that i wasn't bringing some chintzy little chinese-made toy you know i was bringing him a drill he recognized the name he recognized it took he fit his hand he it did the job and i just thought here's here's people who are going to be here in the earth imagine how much pleasure god takes in the fact that i know i got some tools down there and they'll get in my hand and they'll do the job it's not it's not something cheap it's not somebody flim-flam up and down in and out wishy-washy i got a family and they're and they're quality family and they're a tool how many want to be a tool in the hand of the lord to be something of value to him brother branham says here in the message lean not to thy own understanding now watch this i'm going to come down to where we live can we go there you're not afraid of the word are you watch this brother branham says he says i think it would be a good exhortation today if we said to our sons and to to the sons of god that it's all right to have an education there is nothing against that amen but when now watch but when that education is contrary to the word here's a prophet's advice then lean to the word and let your education go that's simple see because the word see and education will stand now watch this now watch this here's a here is a reasonable man who's a human being lives in the world understands what it means to live he says education will stand and will give you a good job probably a good standing amongst intellectual people and that's all right see which will probably be a great help to you in your financial and your livelihood make a living maybe a little better for you but remember one thing ready you ready education is fine it can help you make a good living for you no problem but remember one thing my son you've got to die amen no matter how much education you've got how much culture you're able to accumulate you've yet got to face death because it's written that men must die and after that the judgment and watch what he says here now death is not so bad but coming to the judgment that's the bad part see now you can die but after that the judgment now watch this god is not going to inquire of you how much schooling you got when you were here on earth watch how much knowledge you accumulated whether you got your bachelor of art or whatever degree you might have been even as a minister it's not going to be required of you at the judgment all right but it's going to be required of you hear it hear it ready it's going to be required of you what you did about the understanding of god's word amen now you're talking about a prophet now who's zeroing down on what really matters get a bachelor of art have an education that's great it could help you make a better livelihood living for you puts you in elite company can help you in life but remember one thing we remember you still got to die and after the death the judgment see so he says none of that's going to be required of you what's going to be required of you is what did you what you did about the understanding of god's word that's where here's a prophet that's where the requirement comes because of that your education is fine amen now watch this ready your education is fine but the word of god is life that's a big jump that's a big jump education is fine so no no problem say what about education it's fine but the word of god is eternal life that's like grand canyon style difference yes amen see and so he says my word is life and to know it is life and he said to know him because he is the word now we find the results of this watch now watch the pursuit of education in the world it plunged the whole human race to death because the first mother on the earth leaned to her own understanding contrary to the word of god and it plunged the whole human race to death now do you believe that that's the word see so a church today can accept a bunch of dogmas and creeds and plunge the whole congregation in a separation from god those people who adopt those things in the stead of the word of god are just like eve it's here's a statement he makes it's been done over and over till it's got this whole generation plunged away from the word of god so now we're back now we've come full circle why do we see the madness why is there such social turmoil political turmoil national turmoil global turmoil there and and and here's the simple answer has it been here's a here's a fair question maybe they haven't heard and the prophet says oh no no no their sound went into all the earth god has circled the globe and is circling the globe right now on every medium and every in every format into all the jungles all the most remote parts of the earth and that's where jesus said it would be that way that that that the gospel that he was standing there declaring that there would be a declaration in all the world and then the end would come amen so have they not heard yea the prophet said oh they've heard their sound went into all the earth see but what we find is is that when they were presented with the word of god they made a choice that eve made they leaned to their own understanding amen and it literally here's what he said now and this is amazing because this is 1965 cub scout days see it it it until it's got the whole generation plunged away from the word of god there was one man watch this there was one man who did lead to his own understanding his name was judas iscariot brother brown says i don't see how he could have done it amen he walked face to face with christ just like eve did in the beginning he seen the vindication he looked at god in the face like eve did in the cool of the evening he even he eve looked at christ in the cool of the evening in the garden and judas had sat in the cool of the evening in the garden of gethsemane in many places he looked at the same christ and heard him teach proved himself by the word vindicated to be a prophet that moses had spoke would raise up and told them in the scripture who he was and all about it they had seen it proved by god that he was and then he leaned to his own understanding now here we are friends eve lee uh saw it and made a decision when christ was visible in the evening time judas saw christ in the evening time and it became very visible and there's we made his choice and you're here today and you're back to the evening time of the history of mankind and i'm here to tell you christ is visible among us his word is plain it's pure it's in your face where you've got a whole family of god declaring it to be so amen so what are you what's your decision because depending on the decision you make it'll plunge you into chaos or take you into glory amen and you don't get a greater contradistinction than between heaven and hell amen how could he do it see watch how could he do it brother brown lays out the case when he was there and he saw him and he fell to believe and saw him in the face and saw him saw the miracles and he knew the word and all of this thing here's here's the answer he's going to answer his own question see how could he do it he didn't know in the scripture that he had raised up to take that same place that the scripture had foretold about him see and neither does the people today realize what condition they are in it's ordained for this laodicea church to be in this condition putting christ on the outside and him knocking trying to get back in no cooperation nowhere though see so it was prophesied you know two millennia what we would see today said what did it say about today that christ would be put out of the church amen that that that he would become obviously declared to the people the seven seals would be open a prophet would be standing on the earth they couldn't deny it brother branham challenged him you're afraid of that light that light showed before the world the cameras took pictures of it a prophet had it all in tens and tens of thousands of times they're not the world's not innocent you could we can feel sorry for them we do feel it's a great tragedy i feel sorry for mankind and and and it doesn't make me go it makes me go lord give me feeling of responsibility increase it upon me that i can be a brighter light somehow that i can declare him more brightly more vividly maybe they haven't seen enough example of the true word of god but they put him out you know i was thinking about the social upheaval we see in the streets today national turmoil and strife and they're saying that within just the next couple of weeks things could go sideways real bad real bad i mean you know you you've got you've got one side saying and you know i always during this time and and it's unavoidable the topic's unavoidable because we're at the end time and that's part of it so i'm constantly feeling like i have to have a disclaimer to go i'm neither one can i talk about it without you thinking i'm taking either side because i'm not either one i'm a christian but what you see happening is not an accident say who's going to get inaugurated in january i don't know i don't know you got one side saying oh we've already got it we've got the votes we're going to do it and you've got another side saying we're going to get that negated and it's going to be overturned and they're going to well you've got no evidence they're going to we got lots of evidence and y'all are going to all be in jail and it's it's such a such a din you hardly know what to believe and and you know what i just simply sometimes i just close my eyes and go thank god you're in control lord oh i'm so glad you're in control oh because the madness is maddening and and the voices and they're all back and forth and all a bunch of talking heads and you know if we're not careful now this is something that i thought it was kind of amusing to me as i thought about it and i thought you know i get it i mean i get the whole thing of that sure i'm i would never even if i wasn't a christian i could never vote for partial birth abortion i could never vote for anyone who stands for that i could not i mean they're talking about babies that come to term and are born and they kill them and i and and and no wonder brother branham talks about that that party uh sold their birthright when they elected the first catholic president back in the 60s and you know that brother branham in in 33 years of ministry so every four years he would have got to vote what about seven or six or seven eight about eight different times in his life and out of 33 years of opportunity he voted once to me that is so amazing because which one did the lord have him go vote for he comes down to a president where they're going to elect a catholic and god sends elijah to the po to the voting booth and elijah votes against that the only time he ever voted but it's as if god was saying i'm going to i'm going to show the world a sign i'm going to take my prophet and i'm going to have him now the whole world should follow him and whoever he votes for should win the election by a hundred percent and he shouldn't he should win 100 to zero because that's my prophet how many believe he was and here he sends his prophet to vote for the one that the whole world should have followed suit on and that guy lost he say what gives i just think this is just brother jason i think that on that day god needed that as a as a method as a justification to to judge the world to say i sent my prophet to show you what not to do but like every age you did exactly the opposite of what my prophet did and your and your and now what kind of chaos and now we've got another catholic president-elect say is he going to get it is it going to be the woman vice president i don't know it's on track to be will he make it will republicans win will the supreme court overrule it will it go to the house of representatives i don't know say do you care i care in this regard that the crazier it gets i start getting a smile i start realizing almost home almost home almost home and people are out on the street i'm going almost home almost home you crazy bunch of people i'm almost home oh go ahead throw it over a cliff because i got a chariot ride waiting on me and sure i'm never going to vote for that liberal socialism i if i wasn't a christian i couldn't vote for that i couldn't vote for for the things that they stand for you say oh that's right brother jason you must be a republican i'm not i'm a christian [Laughter] you're not either amen no no no you're not you're not you're not a conservative republican in the political party no you're not i don't care what you think i don't care how you voted you're not one i can prove it we get so invested in this political upheaval you know shaking the nation and if you think about it like this now here's a prophet who got to a point in his life by the end of his ministry he said i don't even pray for this nation anymore he don't even pray for it and in fact when he referred to a baptist methodist as a church holy spirit corrected him said stop calling it that and he thought he heard something he said what was that must have just been me and he started mowing his grass again and he heard the voice again said don't call them a church those are lodges those are not churches see now you know let's be real let's be real for a minute friends do we imagine for even one minute that the republican conservatives party would endorse you saying that homosexuality is a moral sin and people who live that lifestyle are going to go to hell unless they repent do you think that donald would back you on twitter if you said that you think lindsay would you got to be kidding you think tucker would back you if you if you said tucker i want to come on your show sean hannity i want to come on your show i'm a republican conservative give me a platform to say that you think sarah palin would come over here are all those republican
