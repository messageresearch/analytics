========================================

And why does God let troubles come? God harnesses trouble, puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him. Those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God. There had been no rainbow until the flood came. But after Noah was pressed into that condition that he was in the boat 40 days and nights in a storm and a little heart ditching up and down in the water, it was after the flood was over that he saw the rainbow for its first time. It was Daniel who hath purposed in his heart that he not defile himself with the things of the world and was forced to have trial whether he'd pray to God or go to a lion's den. After the heat was put on and he was thrown into a lion's den, he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the midst of him. Oh, if the church could only wake to itself today to find that after the troubles and trials and laughs and made fun of that we see God in our midst doing great signs and wonders, after it's all passed, then we shall see Jesus at last. Oh, don't let the devil tell you that you just might as well give up. You're already overcoming him by being here tonight. You're already overcoming him by staying with the word. Oh, don't let the devil take your ground. You're still here. You're still You would have given up, but you're still here. Why are you still here? Because something greater in you has brought you here above all of the chaos of the world. You have every reason in the world not to be here, but you're here. We've seen too much. If we wanted to go by man's laws, I could have gave up because of that. I could have gave up because of that. I could have gave up because of that. But you're still here tonight because something in you is crying out. Something something deep in you is crying out for something greater. And there's a deep responding back to you speaking the same language. There's something greater here than Paul Fontaine. There's something greater here than you. There's something greater that's here that's bigger than your problems, bigger than your storm. Somebody is here that's greater than all your past hurts and pains. You got hurt. You got pain. You feel distant from God. There's somebody here that knows everything about that. Never put his seal on that part. He knew he wanted overcomers. So he leaves twothirds of you not yet fully redeemed. But the oneird that is redeemed way out does the other two/3s that ain't redeemed if you'll get it in harmony with God. Don't you see? He wants us to overcome. He's not going to pull us through a pipe and pull us out on the other side and say, "Blessed are they that overcome." I believe the young people in this generation have got more to overcome than any generation that's ever been. And no doubt the Lord Jesus has already told the devil, "Listen, devil. I've got some young people in the message in the last day. They will not bend. They will not bow. They will not compromise. They'll believe my word. They'll defeat you and every one of your demons. There's nothing you can do to stop them, Satan. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Mark your calendars. Bethl Youth Camp returns this fall.

This year's speakers include Brother Donnie Reagan, Brother Paul Leaf Fontaine, and Brother Ronnie Long with breakfast devotionals led by Brother Abraham Myra. Join us October 16th through the 19th at Carolina Point for our fifth fall youth camp. Registration opens June 30th and the cost is $299 per person.

We're gathering with great expectation for a time of powerful preaching and teaching, heartfelt worship, and personal transformation in the presence of the Lord. We're praying again for another outpouring of the Holy Ghost to fill, to restore, to deliver according to every promise in God's word. Don't miss what God has in store this year. We'll see you at Bethl Youth Camp 2025. I surrender and I'm going to give you everything in this place.
