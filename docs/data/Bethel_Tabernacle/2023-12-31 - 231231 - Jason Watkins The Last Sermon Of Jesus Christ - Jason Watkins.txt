praise the Lord amen anytime we don't have a midweek service it feels like forever since I've seen all y'all amen amen praise the Lord but we're uh planning to have a afternoon late afternoon early evening service this evening and um for our communion and foot washing amen last day of the year amen praise the Lord so we don't uh we're not doing a watch night per se we're just starting at 5:00 amen we're happy to have you all here in the house of God today turn around shake hands with somebody say God bless you amen praise the Lord goodness see praise the Lord Brother the uh bman here the

that you singing sister Lily praise the Lord I thought amen making sure she got that in amen so God bless you happy to have other visitors here with us today amen praise Lord we have heat praise God Amen I thought I might have to preach in a high gear today get everybody shouting and jumping and get us all warmed up but uh we um we have our service text up over over your head working amen we got it we got it going praise the Lord we're going to um look right into the word of God this morning and I just you know um just been trying to make sure I find the exact mind of the Lord I've had this thought on my heart for quite some time actually and um just trying to figure out exactly what all the Lord wants to cover today I don't think we can get it all but we want to make sure we have exactly what the Lord wants I want to speak to you today on the last sermon of Jesus the Christ amen amen praise the Lord we're on the last day of the year amen so I thought and I didn't plan it that way honestly um I had probably several as you know I was finishing that series and I probably had more than half a dozen I did have well more than a half a dozen sermons simmering on the back burner amen and so when I saw the Lord bring this one to the Forefront I was I thought how ironic on the last day of the year I would preach the last sermon of Jesus the Christ amen praise the Lord Jeremiah chapter 30 amen we're going to uh sorry to leave you standing we're going to catch three different places and just a reminder that uh we will be having um afternoon service starting at 5 o' communion foot washing and uh we're we're going to kind of abbreviate everything we'll just have a few songs to open up with and then we'll go right to the scripture reading amen and have the communion and then uh watching amen so that'll be starting at 5 o'clock this afternoon amen Jeremiah chapter 30 and I just want to catch these verses 1 through 7 and then we're going to head to Luke's gospel but let's catch this one first Jeremiah chapter 30 verse one now before I read I want the reason I'm taking three and that's unusual for me uh I I'm following a theme and you're going to catch it and I want to just go ahead and tip you off so that you will catch it as we read where you know but really only one being with all power amen any real power as far as unlimited power there's only one amen praise the Lord so I want you to absorb brother I enjoyed that song God bless you see you standing there welcome today others different ones with us um you you you're I want you to observe that who's really in charge of everything hey Michael praise the Lord God bless you bud happy to see you here wow thought I know that brother wow praise the Lord all right still seeing visitors let me Brothers in the back God bless you happy to have you all the different ones here today we got some good news for sister Smith that's right praise the Lord we're happy and the Lord for her amen and sister Jean is recovering amen her buddy's here Sister Evelyn but sister Jean is getting stronger and stronger and stronger amen all right back to the scripture all right amen praise the Lord so uh you know there's all kinds of people step up and claim Authority but there's really only one and I'm going to take three passages and I want you to notice who's really in charge all right verse one Jeremiah 30 and the the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying thus speaketh the Lord God of Israel saying write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book for Lo the days come saith the Lord that I will I will bring again the Captivity of My People Israel in Judah sayeth the Lord and I will cause them to return to the land I will cause them to that I gave to their fathers and they shall possess it and these are the words that the Lord spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah for thus sayith the Lord we have heard a voice of trembling of fear and not of Peace ask you now and see whether a man doth travail with child wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins as a woman in travail and all faces are turned into paleness alas for that day is great so that none is like it it is even the time of Jacob's trouble but he shall be saved out of it that's quite an authoritative statement would you agree Jacob's trouble of course is the tribulation period Luke chapter 19 it's uh we call it the tribulation period and the Bible calls it the great day of tribulation but in there in the Old Testament it's referred to as the time of Jacob's trouble Luke chapter 19 just two verses there want to catch verse 26 and 27 now this of course is where a king went into to a far country to receive a kingdom and he left uh his servants in charg amen and when he went away the people the citizens sent a sent a message after him saying we will not have you or your servants to rule over us all right now let's catch it he comes back you know the story one had brought forth this meaning one had brought forth that meaning one had not brought forth any verse 20 six for I say unto you that unto everyone which hath shall be given and from him that hath not even that he hath shall be taken away from him but those mine enemies which would not that I should Reign Over them bring hither and slay them before me amen 1 Timothy chapter 6 and this will be uh the last last place that I I want to read amen praise the Lord first Timothy Paul's first pastoral letter after he writes lengthy letters to the Thessalonian church he writes to Timothy in chapter 6 and we're going to just catch verses 13 to 16 I give thee charge in the sight of God who quickeneth all things and before Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession that thou keep this commandment without spot unrebuked until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ which in his times he shall show who is the blessed and only potentate amen the king of kings and Lord of lords who only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen nor can see to whom be honor and power Everlasting amen let's pray father we commit ourselves into your hands now Lord and I pray that you'll just let My Heart Lord be led by the thee as we've looked much Lord at this thought trying to discern exactly the the the where the spirit is leading so now I I'm committed into your hands in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated amen praise the Lord don't know how far we'll get but we'll get as far as we can how's that yes I I greeted them in there is coming a day when Jesus will preach his last sermon to the masses amen and we're going to look at that just in a moment we won't we won't um go too far into it but I but I but I do want to just and you won't even have to turn and don't try to follow me Noah because I'm going to move quickly uh but we're going to refer to Matthew 25 just in a moment just as a reference and in fact is uh just just to uh all right no I've changed my mind already Matthew 25 amen praise the Lord I think I I think this would be a good idea for you to catch this and uh now that you're seated amen Matthew 25:31-46 when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left now catch this 34th verse then shall the king say now I'm reading you you the text of the last sermon to the masses of Jesus Christ and I'm actually already have his sermon notes then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I was hungry and you gave me meat I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying when Saul we thee hungry and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King shall answer he's continuing on in his sermon now the king shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you in as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me then shall he say unto them on the left hand depart from me you cursed into Everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels I think it's a sad final judgment yeah on Humanity that ends up going to a place that was actually prepared for the devil and his angels and people who lament that God sends people to hell I'm glad a prophet cleared the air on that God doesn't send anybody to Hell men send themselves there hell was not created for humans and fact is Hell hath enlarged itself because it became an overcrowded prison it was never designed and built originally for humans it was built for the devil and his angels sadly people down through Millennia have allowed the devil to influence them just like those Fallen Angels did and now they're headed to the same place amen prepared for the devil and his angels for I was hungry and you gave me no meat I was thirsty and you gave me no drink I was a stranger took me not in naked you clothed me me not sick and in prison and you visited me not then shall they also answer him saying Lord when saw we thee hungry or thirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not Minister unto thee then shall he answer them saying verily I say unto you in as much as you did it not to one of the least of these you did it not to me proving that those who are the family of God who house the word of God that when the enemy bothers you he's bothering God Amen praise the Lord and these shall go away into Everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal now this of course is at the end of the great uh it's at the end of the tribulation it's at the end of the Thousand-Year Millennium this is this is why I called it the last sermon of Jesus the Christ it's the last time he's going to preach to the masses and we we realize that on that day when he begins to announce his judgment and and all of his judgments are are pure all of his words are true all of his ways are just there's nobody you know you you first have uh the the iniquitous people who rise up and say wait a minute hold on did not we preach in thy name and do all kinds of things in thy name and that's when Jesus will say depart from me you worker of iniquity I never knew you now it's interesting that they that they try to claim to say hey we did all of these works in your name we we we we acted like Christians we went to church like Christians we read bibles like Christians yeah but he will say yes but you did it but your heart was always evil you it was never it was never in your heart to do that you say well then how would they have such an audacity to stand in front of the judge of all men's hearts and try to claim such a technical take such a a legal argument uh and I will tell you why they do it then because that's what they do now and they've been used to doing that they've been used to just joining a church and everybody think they're a Christian they've been used to just quoting out of the Bible or singing gospel songs and pretending to be something they weren't and everybody went along with it so now they're coming forward they're all they're doing is what they've always tried to do and they've got by with it but nobody is going to escape this judge nobody is going to get by with a insincere confession of Christ those days here are done that's it there's nobody going to make that claim and in in in perfect contradistinction you have the unwise Virgin and and the different ones who of a pure heart who may be who may be never did the works or the exploits of all of these people who build all of their big worldwide iniquitous Ministries but yet in their heart they observe good and in their heart as best they could they were righteous people and the Bible calls them righteous the righteous shall shall say to the king this isn't the bride the bride are on the throne the bride aren't being judged we're already judged now we're already standing before the Judgment seat of God of Christ and we're being judged now by the word I don't want to go there and be judged then I'll take it right here and right now but we find that the righteous shall say to the king and the King shall say to the righteous and that and then in the Book of Revelation they're actually called saints Saints means Sanctified one amen so it's not going to do you any good uh to to try to be in a church or call yourself a Christian if you're not even going to allow common decency and sanctification to work in your life I'm sorry those people by the billions are going to perish but I'm glad that Jesus you know looks beyond just his elected family just his elected bride and Jesus would say blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy blessed are the meek and and and they shall inherit the earth so God is Not unaware and I'm glad he's the Arbiter of every man's heart I'm so glad that I don't have to figure all that out all I got to do is work out my salvation with fear and trembling in his presence all I my job is to preach the gospel to tell you to p a token your home I'm here to tell you God will figure it all out I'm so glad that I don't have to determine that we'd get it wrong we surely would so there's coming this day when Jesus will preach his last sermon to the masses and this will certainly be the largest audience of all time it will literally be the audience of all time amen and on that day he's going to prove beyond all doubt that he is first of all very real and all the critics who said he wasn't real are they ever going to get a surprise he's going to prove that he's not only very real but that he alone is the only being that has real unlimited power moreover it's it's going to become clear that that that no matter really what has happened down through history that really that he had all power and was always in control was always true and it's going to become clear that he alone will have the final say I'm glad to know that my future goes on from that sermon I'm glad to know that my life is not ending at that time I'm glad to know that my future is clear and that my future is bright brother brandham was told this he worried about his ministry and worried about his life and worried about his mistakes boy we do that don't we and he's coming to God and he had made a mistake and he had disobeyed the Lord amen do we do that and he's got the question that we have often had for our own selves and because we've also made mistakes and we've also missed opportunities and brother bradam did both missed a great opportunity and as great as his Africa campaign was how much greater it would have been had he obeyed the Lord and how much less how how he would not have had to suffer had he not let preachers take him aside and and we've had that we've come to God in Repentance and say Lord I'm so sorry I did the wrong thing I I knew you were telling me different and I did it anyway please forgive me I'm glad I'm hearing the same message your future is clear my future is clear your future is clear I say it all the time our future is bright friends when that when that when that trial is over when that last sermon of Jesus the Christ is preached to the masses and he separates the sheep from the he separates the good from the bad as a Shepherd would separate sheep from goats and I you know and and and and those who are cast into to uh destruction with the devil and his angels I I'm glad that 10,000 years will just be started am I love that old song I woke up this morning had to play it and I at 10,000 Years the song says we have just begun the battle will be over and the Victory will be won 10,000 years and we will have just begun I just say today take courage friends let come what may let the Heathen rage the Heathen will always rage 10,000 years I'll still be going strong when Jesus preached his second to last sermon to the masses I'm talking about to the masses he preached all through his ministry three and a half years uh on a Roman Calendar three years on a Jewish calendar and he he preached you know on the the Mount of Olives he preached in the temple he preached in the porch area he he preached in homes he preached in synagogues crowd here crowd there sometimes the crowds were so much so that he had to get in a boat and push off a little bit because they filled the bank but but that's that's not like when he descended into the lower parts of the earth amen this was like the great white Throne judgment that we read about in in Matthew 25 we're going to find that that's his last sermon to the masses his second to last sermon to the masses is when he descended into the lower parts of the earth to preach to souls in prison Bible declares that that he that ascended is the same that first he that ascended first descended into the lower parts of the Earth the Bible says he preached to those souls in prison who repented not in the days of Noah I want to tell you something never never was it more true at that moment that he spoke to a captive audience a captive audience and and and and at that moment people who had not repented from the time of of Cain all the way back who who arrogantly decided to go his own way and reject God's mercy in his word God's Mercy is always in his word it's always where you find it and it it went on from Cain and you can see it in his descendants and Cain is you know he put a mark and anybody that destroys him will be destroyed and and then you go on through his lineage and you come to the fourth chapter of Genesis and you find lch now there's you know Cain chose you see those names you see Enoch and limi on on Cain's side and then Enoch and all of these on on uh Seth's side that's just because civilization was just beginning to burgeon through the Earth and you find that this descendant of Cain a direct descendant of Cain in Genesis 423 and 24 we're not going to read it today but you know the problem was was his arrogance you know all the because he said you know if if this is what happened to Cain you know then then seven times I uh seven times upon me and the problem was not what he had done he had actually killed a man to his wounding meaning was killed him in self-defense a young man tried to kill him and he defended himself that wasn't the problem God I don't think would have condemned him for defending his life but that he boasted about it that he was arrogant about it that it was still that same Defiance I did it my way I'm going to live my life and nobody's going to tell me what to do with my life what I'd like to know is who told you it was your life did you give it to yourself can you keep it that can you keep the air in your lungs right now if it wasn't for God no wonder the Bible says let everything that has breath praise the Lord old ma Jackson used to always say if you're not going to praise him stop breathing because you're breathing his air that he gives you I'm here to tell you something friends we ought to praise the Lord hallelujah so here Jesus goes down and he descends into the lower parts of the earth he's preaching to all those from Cain to lmch and all the way up through to the days of Noah and even Beyond those who repented not and and the sad part to me about that verse is those who repented not in the longsuffering days God God started pronouncing judgment on the world but he waited and kept Noah preaching for 120 years my goodness you're talking about a god rich in Mercy to pre to have him preach for 120 years and and and and and here he is now and then not only those but those who were lodged on the sides of the pit that Isaiah and Ezekiel spoke of Isaiah when he discerned the heart of Lucifer how that Lucifer you remember in Isaiah 14 Lucifer his desire was to ascend above the Stars which was the sons of God was the family of God don't don't lose sight of it that God that Satan wants to have a position higher than you don't lose sight of that now he now there's he can't climb higher than you so what he does is he tries to pull you lower than him don't let him resist the devil submit yourself to God resist the enemy and he will flee from you Hallelujah see so he says I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high Isaiah says Isaiah gives him a reality check says yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit Jesus was preaching to those who were lodged on the sides of the pit Ezekiel Saw it in Ezekiel 32 the strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him they are gone down no go ahead and give me Ezekiel 3221 to 23 I think I'd like to read that I'd like to have you read it with me Ezekiel 32 21 one the strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him they are gone down they lie uncircumcised slain By The Sword Asher is there and all her company his graves are about him all of them slain Fallen By The Sword whose graves are set in the sides of the pit and her company is round about her grave all of them slain Fallen By The Sword which caused Terror in the land of the living amen why brother brandom said don't ever let anyone tell you the devil's not real right don't ever let anyone tell you hell is not a real place it's real and open for business now amen Jesus went there and preached to souls in prison captive audience who had no chance to get out because they repented not when God was longsuffering amen people who wouldn't hear his servants though he sent them continually they killed his servants actually people who wouldn't come to church people who would walk out while the word was being preached come on here's something they didn't like and turn around and and and and and and I remember a testimony I forget the sister's name elderly sister was there I believe I believe it was in choosing of a bride I'm pretty sure if that might stand correction I believe it was choosing of a bride and um and and at the end you you can hear Brother R becomes very emotional you know he's warning Hollywood you know repent Los Angeles and your honeycomb is right under you and he's crying out there and uh and and and and we we find that he had really been hard on on how people dress and and he had really went after you know women with high heeled shoes and he went to the scripture and pointed out that this the Bible talks about in the last days that women would mince as they walk clearly showing that their their high heels are so high they're they're walking funny and and and the way high heels cause a woman's figure to be accentuated and it's all done on purpose amen and it wasn't just the women it was men and different things and and and that's why I said you know even the foolish virgin were sanctified people see so so we find that that they when you can hear all the people screaming and crying in a pandemonium the anointing is there so strong and this sister h a minister asked her what were the people doing we can hear all of the commotion she said half the audience was on their face crying out to God in Repentance and the other half had got up spun around and clicky clacked their high heels right out the door they didn't want to hear that kind of word I I recently preached a funeral first time it's ever happened to me in my entire in 35 years of preaching funerals I'd always said that I one of the things I like about preaching funerals is you can say whatever you want nobody walk out cuz it's a funeral that's the truth and and and I just preach a funeral broke my 35 year record and I'm not all I'm doing is talking about something so glorious something so wonderful that a prophet gave an assurance to mothers with wayward children and said that wayward child said all right here's what you do sister you claim them you take the same faith that you believe for yourself and you claim that child and said and don't you and you claim it and said and if you never see it and you go to your grave and you never see it on the resurrection when you come up that faith will still be burning in your heart CU you come up like you went down and he said and at that time God will have to answer to that faith and he cannot lie and he'll have to bring them in what a glorious promise can you imagine that that would make somebody so angry that they would jump off the front row and try to Barrel out the side door and make a scene unfortunately the Lord locked the door and they couldn't get out and embarrass themselves kicked at it and Shook at it and banged on it and finally sat down red in the face oh my I'm G to tell you something friend there going to be a lot of embarrassed people on the day of judgment amen they'll hear this sermon that we read about in Matthew 24 I'll promise you that nobody's going to walk out on that sermon they'll hear that sermon till the last word when you get a convicted felon who's already convicted you ever notied that they stand up very respectfully to to hear their sentence you know why they do that because they know that the judge just might have a little bit of Mercy on them they're already convicted they're definitely going to prison but but the judge hasn't yet sentenced them and so they stand up and they're they're terrible person but they're very respectful because they want to see if maybe just maybe he'll have a little bit of Mercy I'm here to tell you something friends these people are going to stand at attention they won't walk out of that sermon there ain't nowhere to walk to Hallelujah they'll stand there till the last minute the ministry of the Lamb that we see in the life Liv of the people will go all the way down to the last days don't ever lose sight of the fact that your life itself is a sermon to the world Amen Satan had made his boast that he would ascended above the family of God but I'm I'm going to tell you something friends I've thought about this and the imagery has been in my mind since I was a very young man started preaching I just see that day when Jesus preaches his last sermon to the masses and when the and the Bible and I could go into all kinds of different scriptures that that talks about how that his enemies shall be brought before the son and they shall be slain in his presence there are scriptures that talk about Satan being brought forward and the people shall narrowly look upon him we could have read it in some of the things we read and how that they will even be astonished is this the man that caused Nations to tremble are you mean I fell for this guy and now I'm doomed cuz I listened to him and I rejected the King on his throne oh friends it it makes me shiver to think but I I can just see I can see in my mind's eye I can see Christ I read you some of his sermon material already oh it's going to be a a sad day for the unbeliever but a happy day for those who stayed humble before the Lord that's when he steps off of his throne before Satan is carried away this is my own license but I just see Christ one last time saying Lucifer you see this bride seated with me on this throne and you said you would Ascend above her that's not going to happen you said you would be like me that's not going to happen I let you have it all satan I let you have the government I let you have the education I let you have science I let you have entertainment I let you have pull pits I let you have families and when you were at your Zenith I took my word and I perfected my bride right under your nose I didn't sucker punch you I didn't catch you looking away I didn't wait for you to be in a weak moment when my bride was weak then I was strong and I have perfected her today I'm so happy to be a part of that number friends are you happy to be a part of that number hallelujah oh my Satan had made his boast he's always bragging he's always boasting oh I can hear him declaring you know Christ declaring how that he was always in control of his bride he allowed Satan to afflict them sure he allowed it he allowed Satan to afflict them with Oh my he Afflicted them with persecutions and and sickness and and I I mean Cancers and tuberculosis and all kinds of diseases and crippling and some of them God healed you know why you know why think God healed some of them to show Satan you don't matter and then others as the Bible says others he allowed to have cruel cruel mockings and he allowed them to go down and and they even refused Deliverance of of whom the Paul says the world was not even worthy think of a life that the world isn't even worthy of friends oh my he's not talking about Perfect People he's talking about people who had perfect fath fath in a perfect God hallelujah I don't claim to be a a perfect person but my faith in his word is perfect that's the faith of Abraham not that Abraham wasn't a perfect person Abraham made mistakes the Bible doesn't say Abraham never stumbled the Bible says Abraham never stumbled at the promise it didn't matter what mistakes he made he just kept going forward with the promise oh my goodness some of them he some of them he allowed to go through tragedy some of them he allowed to go through sickness some of them he allowed to go through suffering and then you know what he did he let Satan torment him and make him suffer and have tragedy and then he snatched them and brought him home you know why he did that you know why he let him die under that cancer under that tuberculosis or under that Co you know why he did that to show Satan again you don't matter I can still bring him home he doesn't matter friends he doesn't matter he he runs nothing in the kingdom of God hallelujah I know my redeemer [Applause] liveth The Sinner arrived at his at his judgment bar by a refusal to have the word rule over his life amen many even after being given opportunity to serve serve God uh chose as did Judas to betray the word and join the I call them the going going gone crowd they're going to go out of existence let them rage all they want let them jump up and down turn blue in the face I don't care they're part of the going going gone crowd Hallelujah he warned them we read it in Jeremiah 30 we we we you know he talks about in 1 Thessalonians 2:4 he said how that they they killed the Lord Jesus and they killed their own prophets and they persecute us and they Paul talks about to the Thessalonian Church they even forbid us to speak can you imagine I mean it's bad enough that you reject the word of God and then try to get somebody else to stop preaching it amen my goodness I mean how what kind of insanity is that and I it's fine if it's not for you then go on live in peace do all you can be all you can this is all you'll ever have God bless you carry on see brother brandham even talks about it's right on tape said people with their cigarettes and their alcohol brother said don't take that from them that's the only happiness they'll ever know amen see I'm not trying to reform people I'm trying to get them the gospel see that that's all they'll ever have and and and so you know I'm trying to persuade them to give their heart to Christ and then they won't have to preach about cigarettes and booze the Holy Ghost cleans up lives I don't have to stand up here and and and take it in that direction see of course there's nothing wrong with gun barrel preaching I get it so so we find then that that they they this increasing Madness that that is I think we could fairly say is infecting the minds of all Humanity and it was prophesied that the whole world whose names are not in the book of life would take the mark of the beast whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world all of them will worship the Beast although it seems impossible that that would happen because when you when the description of the Beast is so clear and what he'll do and what he'll be you think ahead and you go nobody would fall for that but they will and the reason they will then is because they're already being drawn in condition now see by by the by the things of the world the Bible doesn't call it Jacob's trouble for nothing it's it's kind it it's called a tribulation period and you know the the Bible declares that that it'll be a day like has never been and will never be again those aren't Idle Words those are not idle words words in the end you know to be and I guess for me this is always the most heartbreaking part this is the part where I see weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth in its greatest fulfillment is that they will for a brief time be able to see what they've missed out on it's it to me when they see the bride on the throne and when they see the king and when they have their life played back and they can see that they had opportunity after opportunity after opportunity and God gr was willing to even grade them on a curve they even if they couldn't see the message of the hour if they'd just be a Sanctified person that's all that he may he'd find a way he even he even offered Cain all you got to do is act like your brother off find a way for you am and when they stand there and they they saw the example of the true word of God and to realize that they they destroyed their own self because they wouldn't accept it amen and and then not only that but then to see what the bride because he in their presence he says to the even the foolish virgin enter into the joys of the Lord prepared for you before the foundation of the world and they going to have to stand there and see that to me that's the most horrible part I I've talked about you know the a horrible part about you know in a in a sermon I preached years ago leaders die last and because and that was just taken from the principle of the Book of Joshua where they they go to army they go to war with five Kings and when they're fighting the five kings run into a cave and hide and then Israel you know routes the enemy and and God gives them great Victory and they come to Joshua and they say we got the Kings trapped in a cave they went in there and Joshua says all right listen just just block it up put stones in front of it so they can't escape go ahead and finish the war go ahead and finish the battle kill all the enemy and uh and even God come down and helped them and killed more than they killed yeah God stoned them from Heaven amen and he said then we'll come back and deal with these leaders because leaders get killed last see and so so I I I was showing just showing how that you know brother Bram talks about Elvis Presley and all the millions of young teenagers that he sent helped send to the Lake of Fire leaders in this world great leaders who think they have all this power and great political power and great economic power and the Brain Trust of the world and and they're going to be the ones responsible for Armageddon yes yes that's the madness that they're literally going they're so the insanity is going to and it's already merging now it's already happening now I I'm here to tell you something friends there is there is change coming there I brother Mark and I were we were sharing this this thing that we uh together uh on on technology and on AI and different things like that and I'm not here to preach with science lesson but I'm just here to tell you that that even the experts are they know that they're headed for Destruction but they but everybody's got to be the first one so everybody just got I know we're killing ourselves but I can't get beat feet and that's the insanity and it's and the Bible tells me say oh you're Doom and Gloom I'm not I'm just a Bible reader and I know that they come and destroy themselves God doesn't destroy the world God loves The World God loves life he doesn't even he doesn't even take pleasure in the death of The Sinner he would let all men come to repentance mankind is going to destroy himself say why because he's determined to am I'm so glad I got a different kind of a mind I'm so glad something came into my heart and I said I'm not of this world this world is not my home Hallelujah I got another one coming amen Jacob's trouble and that they will have to you know and and so for for every leader for every parent who pushed their innocent children into Beauty pageants and talent shows and get on there and win the big title America's got this and Britain's got this and every country's got their this now and parents literally literally prostituting their children to make them famous in the world I'm here to tell you when those children are being led to the Lake of Fire Mom and Dad will have to back up because leaders die last and you're going to stand there and you're going to hear the screams of that child this isn't a fairy tale or a horror story this is real this what the Bible foretells and they're going to have to stand there and hear the screams of their children as they're cast in Elvis will have to stand there and hear the screams uh presidents will have to stand and hear the screams of the people leaders die last and how they have to stand there and see what they missed out on to see the eternities to see that bright new world to see the king ready to get on with it and all that's doing is he's just eliminating all just like we read in Jeremiah he's eliminating he's establishing his family which he was always going to do matter what anybody did that was always going to end that way he gave everybody an an opportunity everybody got a fair Square chance everybody gets a fair trial no that's why I've said in Matthew 25 go to Matthew 25 read all through it go go to the Book of Revelation go into 181 19 20 21 read all through there read read what happens in 19 and 20 you don't find anybody carrying signs or marching you don't find anybody crying foul or in Injustice right because there's a knowing at that point that everybody standing there in the presence of that judge knows very well that they are guilty and everybody goes to their fate not kicking and screaming but with their head bowed and to see what they're going to miss out on to me that to me that's the that's the gritting of the teeth that's the because when when something is so bitter when when a disappointment is so bitter that it you just grind your teeth over it and people just agonize and one of the greatest agonies is what it didn't what could have been that I I lost it all and it need not have been I didn't have to lose it all I could have gained it all and it's not my fate I I'm here to tell you you know you you can say what you want and condemn me if you want but to me I think the Lake of Fire that'll finally take them out of existence will be Mercy to know that to know that I could have had that and I missed out on it because I wanted my own way oh friends the the gospel comes with Mercy to you today don't leave this building without the mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ he calls to you from a from a heart that loves you and wants to give you a new life and give you a new world and save you from destruction he's not evil God he's a loving God it's the devil trying to kill you it's the devil trying to destroy you it's the devil that hates you to be gone forever and miss out on the grandest purpose of life oh my when everything is stripped away as I said here recently and there's only remaining pure life I'm looking forward to that friends I'm so looking forward to that Amen brother randam says in the message Investments and I'm going to turn a corner here and make a run for the Finish Line in Investments it's a good sermon Investments you want to make sure you're investing in the right thing he says that's where people have got to we we've joined Church which is all right we do those things but you say are you a Christian I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist I'm a presbyterian Pentecost or something it's just a tradition there's no entering in sincerity anymore they won't move up cope with the scriptures and things they just live any way they want to if they got a pastor tries to correct them they out him they have nothing to do with him if he can't bring Hollywood in the church parties bonco parties soup suppers and everything else now you know we live in a more modern day you know so I mean I I I have a hard time talking about bonko party soup suppers I don't even know what that is maybe they still do that but I think it's a much more you mind if I modernize it just a little bit here you know if we can't have modern worship with lights and effects and have the men looking like beatniks with sissified hairstyles and gold chains if we can't have the women standing on the stage with their ripped up jeans and their Jezebel appearance from head to toe if we can't have that we don't want it I say I don't want that I don't ever want that I want nothing to do with Hollywood see Jezebel Styles head to toe that's not a phrase of speech I literally mean all the way out to their fingers and toes Jezebel Styles enough said and let brother Bram says and let the women act any way they want to dress any way they want to immorally anything sex appeal becomes a Modern Trend here's what a prophet said in 1964 that I agree with in 2023 it's a disgrace he says in God of this evil age 1965 this is the West Coast over here furthest west you can go now the sin barrier has thundered down beneath the Earth and she's sinking places in Los Angeles and Hollywood sinking so many inches per hour no way to stop it yeah we're here most any time we'll hear the summons see he says in spiritual Amnesia I can imagine he says I can imagine seeing on one hot day in Samaria there the one of the greatest tourist cities of the world of that day it's it's something on the order of we'd say Miami or Hollywood or Los Angeles some of them places like that some great place for tourists and we can just imagine him seeing him th about Amos here and he had never been in such a city but he had the word of the Lord and he was coming to this great City where sin was heaped up on every side the ministers had all got away from the word of God and they hadn't had a profit in long years Brothers we must never get away from the word of God bethl Ministry team we must never get away from the word of God if we get away from the word of God then God's people will get away from the word of God and that's on us I'm here to tell you st stand strong my brothers Hallelujah the people will love you for it on that [Music] day spiritual Amnesia I thought what a title I thought to myself spiritual Amnesia you know I thought about this I thought spiritual Amnesia really is the is the global pandemic not covid oh yeah spiritual amnesia Jesus had said in Matthew 10 fear now catch this catch it real close fear not them which kill the body what everybody was afraid of in Co fear not them which kill the body fear not them fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and Body in hell I could hardly believe how men and women who were supposed to be Believers were so afraid of what covid-19 could do to their bodies that they stopped coming to church for months even after it was even after it had just reduced itself to just a a mild illness globally and they still stopped coming see even after it had mut mutated into into just a a mild flu at best now listen I mean and and then of and you know but Gathering everywhere else was fine come on all come on don't leave me up here by myself there was no problem to go to restaurants go work in other people's homes go to go to go to ball games and concerts and places of entertainment and Recreation that's no problem but I can't go to church amen see now look I'm not here I'm not here on this last day of the new year to be nasty or to brow beat you or to you know to uh make this a bully pull pit it's not it's not what I'm preaching on today I get there was a time for C yeah I understand that people died when it first started I I understand that you know I I I I I and we did you know and we said and we did we said we will act in prudence and we did sure sure you know we observed and we took prudent steps for safety we had our brothers uh install high-tech air purification systems in our hva HVAC system so that it constantly purified the air we we red reduced the Gathering even for several weeks to a when it was at its peak and we reduced it to a skeleton broadcast crew we asked people you know for a while to wear mask as they entered or exited the building we did that for weeks we social distance inside and we went to fist bumping and we didn't even assemble on Wednesday nights up here together so I get it we did that there there was nothing wrong with that we acted responsibility we acted responsibly and we acted prudently there there's nothing wrong with acting responsibly and prudently you should but we kept saying to you but not in fear act responsible but not in fear you say brother Jason why is this important why is it important today because I said to you then that this is one that's coming and there'll be five more behind that and 10 more behind that and I'm here to tell you something friends the world is falling apart and there's going to be more coming why am I preaching on it today why did I think to bring this up today because the world there's more coming and I want to tell you today don't act in fear we have don't you know and what wasn't shocking to me it was so shocking I found it amazing how little to no regard there was for the lack of assembling at the house of God and what it was doing to their soulen and to The Souls of their children amen and it still is amen and even with all the signs of the near end falling all around us there's there's such an Affliction of spiritual Amnesia among some of God's best and brightest amen some of God's best and brightest yeah hey there's a compliment for you see I'm not up here to make you feel bad you're God's best and brightest amen and I don't want to see you act in fear over something about your body at the expense of your soul my goodness friends I mean are you not aware what a rarity you are in election have you lost that deeper sense of what you are in Christ are you do you remember that the Lord has set you free from sin don't do things that would harm your soul at trying to save your body let my body go to the grave but let my soul be humble before the Lord I want to accomplish the mission he desires me to accomplish you know how is it that we find ourselves in this day when we see what's happening in the world and the it's it's Dreadful in one sense and it's exhilarating in another brother the mark and I were talking about this this morning talking back and forth over over a a published um news news report and you can see that the world is headed towards self-destruction and that you should say how can you be happy over that well I'm not happy that the world is being destroyed I'm not happy that people are going to suffer that's terrible that's Dreadful it's why I preach and try to get them to not go through that you don't have to go through that there's a way out you can get a token you can get on board you don't have to stay here see it's terrible for the people who stay here but it's exhilarating for me to think because Jesus said when you see these things happening look up lift up your head your Redemption draweth nigh hallelujah how my how is it that we look at a world you know so forlorn and there's such doom and and yet I I still look to the future with great excitement I think I said to brother Mark I think we've already subconsciously let go of this world and realize we're part of another one how many are part of another one friends while the world literally tumbles into headlong self-destruction we we will not only survive we will Thrive I'm not going to be a Survivor I'm going to be a thriv Hallelujah we have the tools here and I'm going to close on this point we have everything here on this last day of the new year you know I I I I wouldn't want you to go out of this year into the new year with threats and worries and guilt of 2023 I want to say to you today friends let 2023 and all of its shortcomings and all of its mistakes and I made plenty of them let them go let them go let them go with the with a new year coming start again say oh I wish I hadn't done this so do I I wish I hadn't have done that so do I oh brother Jason but if you only
