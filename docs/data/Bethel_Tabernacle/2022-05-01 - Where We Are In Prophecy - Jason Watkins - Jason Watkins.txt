it it's only a couple of slides so we want to put that up but first we want to uh stand this morning i'm going to turn to the book of second timothy amen jason uh demars and i are swapping duties today uh brother matt and we will be praying for him he woke up sick and so we're just trusting the lord to touch him but i'll explain a little more later during the main service why brother jd and i are swapping out today amen second timothy chapter 3 know this also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good now you would you would think after that kind of a bullet list man how much worse could it be well hang on it gets worse but wait it gets worse traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away now i also want to um read a little further on but we will just uh pray and i'll let you be seated there for for just in just a few minutes let's pray father we thank you lord for your word your revealed word to us in this hour we ask now lord that you give us the unction of the spirit that we might deliver a burden of the word on our heart for the people we commit it to you now in jesus christ's name god bless you you can be seated friends god bless you amen amen praise the lord amen oh yeah here we go uh second let's go right to the next chapter please um g-man 2 chapter 4 2 timothy chapter 4. continues on with some other admonitions i charge thee therefore before god and the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lust shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables but watch thou in all things amen now by the help of the lord i i want to speak to you this morning let's okay let's have it let's have it up get in there's only two slides so you can just run it for me i want to take a little sunday school lesson this morning on tribulation approaching where we are in prophecy and just hold right there on the title slide where we are in prophecy it is interesting to me and this thought actually came on my heart uh from when brother diggs was preaching the last wednesday and i thought he read actually read this passage that we read in 2 timothy 3 i'm sure it's still fresh on your mind but as he was reading it one of the points that brother diggs pointed out was that having a form of godliness but denying the power this is people who literally go to church but yet but yet they're everything above that list they're everything above they go to church but the people that i'm talking about are lovers of their own selves and covetous and boasters and proud and blasphemers people that go to church are traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god they do go to church they do have a form of godliness but they deny the power brother adam said they deny the reality of the living god to live in their lives and everything becomes just a uh just becomes works and becomes a you know some kind of a standard i was i was speaking to my son chris and i we were out exercising the other day we were walking the bridge and it's a wonderful time of fellowship for he and i and i keep telling chris chris when are you going to bring some of these thoughts and teach a sunday school class for us uh because man it just it just comes out of that guy it just flows and i get plum excited and i start preaching next thing you know we're having a jubilee trying to walk and exercise so we're we're you know bodily exercise profiteth a little right but spiritual exercise is much better and you know we got to talking about the difference between the religions in the world and having traveled the world i have met and nearly come you know come into contact with certainly with all of the leading religions of the world the major ones that we would talk about of course would be christianity and then there'd be the the religion of islam there would be buddhists there would be hindus there would be you know various many many many others down the line after that and you know i was saying to chris i said you know that if someone were to ask me you know why do you choose christianity over islam or over the buddha or over any of these other religions and my answer as a world traveler would be very authoritative i could say listen you know the the the message of islam uh the religion of islam when it's kept in its purest form is a very noble religion they i've been around the muslims who are real muslims now i'm not talking about radical islam just like we have radical christians and radical catholics but i'm talking about real true muslims real true buddhists real true hindus they are they i have found them to be very noble very very they actually talk about the in betterment of living a life of righteousness and holiness they believe in that they believe in holiness standards they believe in in living righteousness i mean that's the whole philosophy of buddhism is to overcome this flesh and through enlightenment see through enlightenment to put this flesh under control so that you can live you know a higher level of human life islam is the same way they have they share many of the same tenants and same goals they believe in a paradise that after you leave here you'll go to a paradise now they don't mention a lot about a resurrection and things like that uh they believe that their elijah muhammad will their prophet elijah muhammad will resurrect of course he hasn't in all of these thousands of years but but but nonetheless the parallels are very striking when you are between being a real christian being a real muslim being a real buddhist uh now so then so then so then the question comes back well then why would you choose christianity because that in christianity jesus christ promised something that none of the others even even even aim at and that is that he said i will be with you even in you and and paul said i become a new creation in christ the old me passes away only christ offers you to have the very god of creation living inside you and to change your nature in your soul the other religions while they have very noble aspirations it's all about willpower it's all about legalism it's all about works it's all about hampering you know putting this flesh under my feet i'm glad i don't have to do that i'm glad the holy ghost done that for me and so jesus so christianity has a natural advantage over all other religions in that it changes you into a brand new person so that now it's not hard to desire holiness you wake up desiring it it's not hard it's not difficult to to disdain sin and ungodliness your nature within you now sure you've still got this flesh to deal with of course we still have to overcome but i'm glad that in the soul realm which is the real man that man in the engine room that's the man who really controls everything i'm glad that there's a power in me that helps me to bring this flesh under subjection now then now there's a second layer so then my my my argument then goes further to say since jesus christ made that promise and he's the only one who did he's the only one who even offered to do it and then he actually did it he said how do you know because he did it to me he did it inside of me then quite naturally i'm gonna go back and believe everything else he said i mean if he said i'll come in and change your nature and he did and he came in and he changed my nature then why would i not believe him when he said i am the way the truth and the life why would i doubt that i mean here is here is some here is a man who offered to do something inside of a human being that is impossible to do for yourself and there's no other human being can do it for you to you in you through you what jesus simply was promising could only be accomplished by the supernatural power of almighty god and since that has happened inside of me then that informs my thinking as to his identity and when he says he's the son of god yeah i'm gonna believe that when he says i'll i'll i'll come into you and i'll sup with you and and you with me i believe that i see it and when he says i'm the way the truth and the life i i'm sorry but there's no way i could accept islam or buddhism or hinduism or anything they don't even offer me that and there's no evidence that anything they say is even true but christ proves his word by by performing in you and i and we all know that no one could make us this we all know we can all look each other in the eye and say it's not me it's him it's by his grace see and so so for me christianity is the very obvious choice so now you've got so now you come to a further category and can you imagine for a moment that people would choose christianity but choose to not let it have its greatest effect and main purpose for even being amen they would take a form of christianity but they would keep their their their traitor attitude their headiness their high-mindedness their lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god they're proud blasphemous boasters incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good they would choose as brother branham said the fine qualities of jesus christ but deny the power deny the reality of the living god which is the very reason christ came that's the reason the holy ghost that's what the holy ghost is given for is not to just have you join a church and not to just have you live a certain standard but to literally change your inner nature so that you crave to be like this and it comes out of you automatically amen so when we come to this term and paul begins to say they won't endure sound doctrine they'll they'll be turned aside from from truth unto fables it's an interesting term because the word fable is very similar it's a greek word muthas which is very similar sounding to the term we're more familiar with logos and we all know what the logos was it was that which came out of god and was god it was god taking a form all right now in fact is not only do muthos and logos sound the same and that's why paul used them because one is truth and one is a fable but they're both a story or words or declaration but one is the truth and one is a fable and in fact is muthus and logos when they begin mean the exact same thing word but what happens is though they begin identical once they start going a little while down the road and mutha starts just you can't hardly tell but it just starts a little bit of a turn and then as it goes further it turns more and as it goes further it turns more and finally downrange you know like you're trying to zero in a gun and and you're you're you might be an inch off at the barrel but by the time you get 200 yards downrange you're going to be feet off and by the time it gets down to the end of the line muthost has completely twisted around until finally it's nothing but a fable it's so completely mongrelized the truth and paul is saying now i want you to grasp this paul is saying that people were actually following the truth and god turned aside unto fables i mean that to me that is that would be so devastating on the day of of of of the the judgment and uh you know the disclosing of all men's hearts to stand there and realize and see it played back that god actually revealed his truth to you and you believed it and walked in it and you're standing there now and you're standing under a fable you completely walked away from the word i mean that takes my breath away when i think about that i say lord god help me ever to stay true to the truth that's why i'm so thankful for a message that's why i'm so thankful that uh god would send a prophet with the express purpose to take all of the man-made debris and clutter and move it away and and get rid of it so that you could actually see the scriptures the amen like me too brother joe amen and that is what god has done now when i come to this idea of this scripture as it relates to tribulation approaching i had this thought wednesday night when we read these words about how that it's perilous times and it goes down this long list i mean it's like as if wow paul you just like emptied the dictionary on bad things i don't you didn't hardly leave it nothing left i mean i don't think it could possibly excuse me i don't think you could possibly have a a more bleak picture of the end time amen now here's the here's here's the catch what the day he was talking about you're living in it it's now and sometimes i wonder if people really believe what paul is saying sometimes the way and you know even within my own self i've had to say at times you know here you are and this is going on and this is going on are you really grasping the gravity of what he's saying this age would be does it sink in on you that this age is completely anointed it's anointing humanity don't know why my throat is doing that it worked fine on my bible study this morning amen but praise the lord we're going to carry right on probably because i'm trying not to preach and usually when i preach i blow it white out and then i'm good to go so i'm trying to hold my horses a little bit this morning but we find that that when you really take in the gravity of the words and then you see the way that people live brushing rubbing shoulders with carnality in their lives and listen friends i mean let let let it let the chips fall where they fall in us today we're sitting here listening to this i mean have you grasped but i had to ask myself those who might be streaming today have you fully grasp i had to look at myself in the mirror of god's word and say jason have you fully grasp do you realize how just how dire a picture paul is painting because there's this tendency just to carry on into the world as if carnal things don't matter it just doesn't matter i can dabble in this i can dabble in that i can let my children do this church doesn't mean all that much i don't even need to be there it's not all that important if my children are even there and people who operate that way would never openly say well that's not even true it's important to me that i'm at church and it's important to me that my children are church well then why aren't you and why aren't they and why why is their appearance rare and why is their appearance late and why is their appearance you know uh why what then why is the appearance of the world lingering i mean these are serious questions friends that we really need to ask ourselves because i'm here to tell you there's a tribulation approaching i wonder give me my my next slide i think it's the only one i got brother jackson i wonder if people really realize what this means right amen do you really comprehend this is a headline from a major news organization and this one if i read you the article the whole thing that western powers are scrambling over is there in fear that vladimir putin will use nuclear weapons now it's good that they fear that because he will he's i don't know if it'll be him particularly but brother branham said thus saith the lord russia will drop a bomb on the vatican and the bible in the book of revelation records that her her torment and her end came in an hour and that shipment and captains and seafaring people will be out at sea and they can't come in for nuclear because of the fear they the bible says the fear of her torment which is nuclear fire and there and nuclear radiation and they're going to lament because rome is the hinge pin they're the they're the they're the the hub that makes western civilization go a lot of people don't aren't aware of that but that is absolutely provable and i'm talking about the the capitalism and world commerce and through craft and the bible says that the that the roman system will lead the whole world and rule the whole world through that commerce and craft through these things and here you're going to drop an atomic bomb on the very heart of western civilization and set off no doubt chain reaction leading to armageddon so the thing about this is sometimes we we need to look at a headline like this and there might need to be a time where you need to shake yourself and say my goodness i i actually live in bible times i really have arrived at the time that brother branham said the world is crazy and he says i'll prophesy to you it will get worse and worse until it goes completely insane and he talks about people losing their mind in their imaginary mind seeing creatures roam the earth and fly through the heavens unimaginable of unimaginable scale and and and these things are going to actually happen in people's imaginary mind and brother ramsay they're going to run and scream and be crazy and friends we're here i mean if there was ever a time when parents need to pinch their conscience when old people young people married people single people boys girls men women little children need to be understanding this that the the tribulation is approaching and as i've said to you before the only way out is up and i want to go up friends when i look at these scriptures in these verses i my recommendation to you today is go home and read this third chapter of ii timothy and read where we read into the fourth chapter and sit down quietly and talk to the lord and say lord what does this mean for me what does this mean for my home what does this mean for my family what does this mean for my relationships what does this mean in my career and my job and my pursuits of excellence where where does this awareness fit in my plans don't let me just go off living life and not paying any attention to the most important book ever given to humanity amen we are approaching a tribulation it's time friends to take a hard look at the scriptures and the prophecies i didn't even get to go into chapter 15 this morning i thought i might go into revelation chapter 15 and show you those seven angels bringing those seven last plagues under the vials friends that you have arrived there it that is being marshaled right now that the staging is happening for that believe me when i say the staging for the tribulation is already underway amen brother branham didn't use that exact words but that's what he called it that's how he described it it's preparing right now i say what what what what's the main atmosphere of the earth uh in in the in the day that i live it's it's getting ready for judgment amen there's not another revival or anointing coming to the to the christian community the next revival is to israel and i'm here to tell you some friends don't be asleep at the switch don't be asleep at the switch don't get dull of hearing and let your senses get dull pinch yourself and ask god i invite you today everyone under the sound of my voice who will hear this live or hear it by archive or hearing you might be hearing it streaming go home today and read second timothy 3 and 4 and ask the lord what does this mean to me what do i need to do that my life appears to be accounting for what i'm reading because if your life isn't accounting for what you're reading then you're asleep at the switch you're you're you're you're gonna impale yourself on this world and everyone that you love and the things you love the most are going to impale themselves on this world this is not a joke this is for real this is happening this is happening in real time go back to my first slide jackson brother jackson this is happening in real time yeah this is happening right now the thing that has that that the ages had to go forward but we have hit an acceleration friends prophecy has hit the accelerator and it's put it to the floor and we're hurtling toward this you can believe that let's stand god bless you father we thank you we thank you father for your word today thank you for the believers lord who are able to be here and those listening lord over across the air i pray master that you will let this grip the people's hearts as it has gripped mine i pray you will grant it my lord i commit it to you in jesus name amen god bless your friends we'll have our intermission we'll start up again shortly [Music] [Music] you
