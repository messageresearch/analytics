And um you know, you think about come up here and pray. And thing is, we don't battle flesh and blood, principalities and powers, dark places. And if you're any kind of a student of the message of the hour, you know, it's not going to be any kind of political thing.

And do you trust him this morning? Amen. God bless you. Oh, that's an applause for him. He's certainly worthy of it. Amen. God bless you this morning. We greet you in the name of the Lord. Turn around and shake hands with somebody standing near you. Amen. Praise the Lord. Happy to have you on the house of God today. Amen. Praise the Lord. Happy to have Sister Hope here visiting with us in town and her daughters on both sides and family and the newlyweds here. Most of y'all don't know it. We had a wedding here yesterday. Amen. I told them they broke a alltime record. I'd never seen people get married on Saturday, be in church on Sunday. So, so you're you're the first one to ever do that. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. We're going to invite you right into the scripture this morning. Um want to start in the Gospel of Luke, chapter 10. Amen. Praise the Lord. Luke chapter 10. I I've got just a couple of announcements. one I'm um one I decided to um wait and just um um send out. Just be looking for it. Um at the end, Brother Kenny, don't let me forget, we're going to call you up and get a prayer cloth prayed for your mom. Um and then um another note, just be on the lookout for it. Uh it's a one of those common things you remember here a week or two ago we had to just remind you about you know electronic device usage you know we we have teams that use to communicate from up here to back there different things going on and sometimes people use their electronics for taking notes I get it just be careful remember there's an allseeing eye uh knows what you're really doing. Amen. And then um and those are just um items of maintenance. you you you make those kinds of statements every so often. Every so often, we have to remind people, you really should get to church early. Now, that one wasn't on my mind, so that one's free. Um, but we've had a little bit of um we've had to do this over the years. Every time we have a baby wave, I don't know, something gets in the water and we have a baby wave. Uh, we have to remind um people to say, "Look, the nursery is for mothers with nursing. Babies are very small children. It's not a playroom, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. Amen. And um it's not a place for grandma, &gt;&gt; you know, and so it's a place for mothers. And here's the here's the real takeaway. Here's the real takeaway. Church order is in no way diminished in the nursery at all. The same way you would never carry on a conversation and here that is not relaxed in the nursery. Amen. So just a reminder of that. And uh and I get grandma's help. I I get that. But that's not a place for grandmothers to pile up back there. That's for nursing mothers. It's not even for older children who just want to go in there and play. You know, by the time they get up to that age, they are more taught that to sit still in church and behave themselves. And that's something we learn at home. I'm going to send a note just to remind you just so when you see it, you'll know what's up with that. Amen. God bless you. I don't want to take more more time than that on that this morning. We have a wonderful atmosphere. Um, Amen. Praise the Lord. Wonderful atmosphere. Amen. Amen. Amen. So, let's look in our scripture in Luke chapter 10. I sure appreciate the wonderful atmosphere that you sit, the singing and the worship. I was enjoying Brother Jason's class this morning. Amen. Luke chapter 10. And I'll read this and then we have some more to read. will let you be seated. Luke chapter 10. We're going to start at verse 21 and we're going to catch 21 through 24. And um I don't know. I may have sent something different to the to the booth. I'm not even sure if I sent a opening text. Ah, okay. I'm in the clear. I said TBD. Okay. Well, there it is. That's the text. Amen. Luke 10:21-24. In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said,"I thank thee, oh Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and has revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight." And all verse 22, all things are delivered to me of my father. And no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son. And he to whom the son will reveal him. And he turned him unto his disciples and said privately, blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see. For I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them, and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Master, I stand before you today completely dependent upon you. And Lord, this is um a thought that I want to take my time on, Lord, but yet I want to um get through to a certain point. So, I'm just I'm just trusting in you. I know nothing more to do than just to give it into your complete control. I'll go as I feel led and say what I feel led to say, Lord, and we'll skip along and pass by what we don't feel a direct anointing for. I know that everything you reveal to me and I put in my notes is not necessarily everything I have to say to the people. Sometimes it's not necessary. Lord, we're going to say everything that you want said. So, I just commit myself to that end to you and to your wonderful hands in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you friends. You can be seated. Now, um, Gideon, we're going to go to, uh, Matthew chapter, uh, 11 and just get that ready. I'll give you the verses just in a moment. Um um so go ahead and put up Matthew 11:25. Let's do that. And then we'll go from 25 through30. But before I start reading in Matthew, you're reading the exact same event. And you can see right there in the 25th verse, at that time Jesus answered and said, "I thank thee, oh father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes." Right? Hold right there, G. So today I want to speak on a sermon I'm going to title um uh let me see get it exactly how I sent it to the booth. Redemption God's great drama. Redemption. God's great drama. So one of the couple of things that I want you to notice before we move on into our text here in Matthew 11 is where we read in Luke 10. You're finding out a number of things that that Jesus is thanking the father that he hides things and only reveals them in as he chooses. He actually says that the father thinks that's a good idea. So, so it's uh you know when we begin to say look you the spirit of God has to reveal the word to you or you'll never get it. And a lot of times people don't want to believe it like that. They want to believe that I can study it or I can go to Bible school or I can memorize verses and I can know it as good as anybody. Well, I'm not saying you can't acquire the data, but I'm here to say and you're going to acquire data today, but nonetheless, God thinks it's a good idea to withhold understanding from who he chooses to and to reveal it to whom he chooses to. And that's not my idea or William Brandham's idea. That's what Jesus says. The father says that's a good idea. I'm going to make it. I'm going to set up the mystery of myself that the only way anyone can discover me is if I reveal myself to them. Therefore, it's grace. &gt;&gt; It's grace. It's mercy. It's not him that willth or him that runth. It's not that you built hospitals or schools. It's that God showed mercy. &gt;&gt; See? And so, so, you know, we find that you say, "Well, how many will believe on him?" Because St. John 3 tells us that whosoever believes and that's certainly a true statement. It doesn't St. John uh 3:16 doesn't say who will believe. In fact is it doesn't even say anyone will. It just says whoever does that they'll re that that's the path to eternal life. You're going to have to believe the word of God. We you have to go over into the book of Acts where it says as many as were ordained believed. SO GOD HAS ALL OF THIS UNDER his complete control. He's never rolling dice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, and it's not a lottery at pick and it's not lucky. You're not fortunate because you're a believer. It's because God knew you before the foundation of the world and put your name in his book and HAS DETERMINED YOU'RE HIS CHILD, NOT YOU. HE DETERMINED IT. when he comes to Abraham, brother Brandham says he didn't he didn't come to Abraham to say, you know, Abraham, this is what I I want to do and this is what I'm going to do. He he came to Abraham to say, I'M JUST HERE TO NOTIFY YOU WHAT I'VE ALREADY DONE. &gt;&gt; You're going to be the father OF MANY NATIONS. THAT'S IT. DONE. FINISHED. FULL STOP. AND NOTHING YOU DO OR DON'T DO IS EVER GOING TO MAKE THAT GO OR NOT GO. IT IS MY PLAN. It's for MY GLORY. IT'S MY FAMILY. IT'S MY HEAVEN. IT'S MY WORLD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE? SO, SO NO WONDER Jesus would turn to HIS DISCIPLES AND SAY, "BLESSED ARE YOUR EYES. &gt;&gt; You see in your ears and you hear." And and I CAN TELL YOU THAT MANY GREAT PROPHETS AND MANY GREAT KINGS DESIRED TO SEE the day THAT YOU'RE SEEING NOW. AND IT WASN'T GRANTED TO THEM. SEE, and that was in the days when Jesus WALKED THE EARTH. SO CAN I SAY THIS TO YOU today to remind by way of rem stirring you up by way of remembrance. DON'T DON'T DON'T BE CASUAL THAT GOD CHOSE YOU. DON'T JUST BE HO HUM. WE SHOULD REJOICE. LET EVERYTHING THAT HATH BREATH PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; WE SHOULD BE CONSTANTLY GRATEFUL AND SAYING LORD HOW CAN I DO MY PART IN THE PLAN THAT YOU CHOSE ME AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO OPEN MY EYES. YOU COULD HAVE EASILY PASSED ME BY. THE WORLD I WAS LIVING IN WAS WRETCHED, POOR, AND BLIND. BUT THEN I HEARD RECOGNIZING YOUR DAY. SERPENT SEED AND PERFECT FAITH, THE BREACH AND THE MESSAGE OF GRACE. &gt;&gt; AND LORD, FROM MY WHOLE HEART AND MY WHOLE LIFE, I THANK THEE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THAT'S WHAT LUKE brings out. LUKE WANTS PEOPLE TO HAVE A DOCTOR. HE WANTS THEM TO HAVE A, you know, uh, in their spirit, IN THEIR HUMAN SPIRIT, A THANKFULNESS AND A GRATITUDE. DON'T EVER, THIS IS WHY THE WORLD NAUSEATES GOD with lukewarmness. &gt;&gt; Amen. because you mean after all that he's done and he he gave his WORD AND HE SENT JESUS AND SENT GIFTS INTO THE CHURCH AND HIS SPIRIT WAS DIVIDED AND AND PEOPLE STILL DON'T BELIEVE OR THEY OR THEY JUST HAVE A A CASUAL CHRISTIANITY &gt;&gt; RIGHT &gt;&gt; WHERE BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THEY JUST ADMIRE THE FINE QUALITIES of Jesus &gt;&gt; THAT'S A FAR CRY from what the church had &gt;&gt; they had the living power they had the very literal life that was in Jesus living in them. HE GOES ON NOW, NOW ONE OF NOW MATTHEW'S GOING TO PICK up a different angle because Luke is a doctor. Matthew's a TAX COLLECTOR. ALL RIGHT, WATCH. And he go, we've read it. Verse 25 26. Even so, Father. Matthew 11:26. For so it SEEMED GOOD IN THY SIGHT. All things are delivered unto me of my father. And no man knoweth the Son, but the Father, neither knoweth ANY MAN THE FATHER, SAVE THE SON, and to he whom THE SON WILL REVEAL HIM. SO, &gt;&gt; SO I I'M SAYING TO YOU, &gt;&gt; THIS IS JESUS SAYING TO HIS DISCIPLES, I AND THE FATHER ARE ONE. &gt;&gt; YOU IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD. IT WAS WITH GOD AND WAS GOD. AND NOW THAT WORD HAS BEEN MADE FLESH. AND YOU CAN'T SAY I KNOW JESUS WITHOUT SAYING I KNOW THE FATHER. AND YOU CAN'T SAY I KNOW THE FATHER WITHOUT SAYING I KNOW HIS SON. YOU CAN'T SAY I KNOW THE WORD EXCEPT THAT THE THAT THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST HAS REVEALED HIMSELF TO YOU. &gt;&gt; This is him in another form. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so then the so then the new birth by THE SPIRIT OF THE HOLY GHOST REVEALING HIMSELF to you is the new birth. &gt;&gt; IT IS A PERSONAL REVELATION OF THE SPIRIT OF HIMSELF TO YOU &gt;&gt; AND YOU'RE BORN AGAIN. AND YOU SAY, "WELL, WHAT'S THE X'S AND O'S? HOW DID WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE? WHAT DID THAT WORK OUT?" THERE WAS A GENE OF GOD DOWN INSIDE YOU AND THE LIGHT WHICH CHRIST WAS THE LIGHT. IN HIM WAS LIFE AND THAT LIFE WAS THE LIGHT OF MEN. RIGHT? AMEN. AND THAT LIGHT FLASHED ACROSS THE SEED AND LIFE THAT WAS ALREADY IN THE SEED CAME TO LIFE &gt;&gt; AND YOU ARE BORN AGAIN. AND IF THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED, IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF THE HOLY GHOST REVEALING HIMSELF TO YOU PERSONALLY, THEN YOU I'M NOT SAYING YOU HAVEN'T HAD EXPERIENCES WITH THE HOLY GHOST. BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. WHEN YOU HAVE PASSED FROM DEATH UNTO LIFE, YOU ARE A NEW CREATION IN CHRIST JESUS. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE FAR BEYOND. YOU'RE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE FURTHER HIGHER UP THE MOUNTAIN THAN JUST MERE SALVATION FROM DESTRUCTION. YOU'VE BEEN REDEEMED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND SO MATTHEW GOES ON, "COME UNTO ME ALL ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give YOU REST. TAKE MY YOKE UPON YOU AND LEARN OF me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest to your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light. SEE FRIENDS SO MATTHEW IS POINTING OUT AND connecting you know LUKE CONNECTED TO THE FACT THAT ABOUT YOUR STATE OF MIND REGARDING THE WORD. YOU SHOULD REJOICE AND BE GLAD FOR MANY DESIRED IT. BUT YOU GET IT. BUT MATTHEW TAKES ANOTHER THING, SAYS, "LISTEN, IF YOU, BY THE WAY, IF YOU WANT PEACE, REAL PEACE, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO COME THIS PATH. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A REST IN YOUR SOUL, &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET REST IN YOUR SOUL IS TO FOR THE HOLY SPIRIT TO REVEAL HIMSELF TO YOU." AND THEN WHEN THAT HAPPENS, IT MAKES THE YOKE EASY AND THE BURDEN LIGHT. THIS IS EXACTLY WHY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT BORN AGAIN BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD live a CHRISTIAN LIFE, BUT THEY DON'T LIVE ALL THE WORD &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S TOO HEAVY. &gt;&gt; IT'S TOO DIFFICULT. AND SO THEY CHOOSE EASY BELIEISM AND EASY STREET. I REALLY DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE ANYTHING. I CAN STILL BE THE SAME TATTED UP HEATHEN THAT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN. &gt;&gt; I CAN STILL BE THE SAME UNGODLY PERSON. I DON'T NEED TO CHANGE MY DRINKING HABITS, CURSING HABITS, CHURCH HABITS, DRESS HABITS, UH APPEARANCE HABITS. ALL I HAVE TO DO IS BELIEVE IN A HISTORICAL MAN. &gt;&gt; SEE, BECAUSE TO DO ALL THAT STUFF, TO TO BE A REAL CHRISTIAN, A REAL ONE, AND LIVE LIKE A REAL ONE, LET ME SAY IT THAT WAY. TO LIVE LIKE A real Christian WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST IS HEAVY and hard to do cuz you're a weirdo. YOU'RE AN ODDBALL. YOU'RE AN OUTCAST. YOU DON'T FIT IN AND YOU HARM YOURSELF. YOU OPEN YOURSELF UP TO PERSECUTION. NOT ONLY THAT, THAT YOUR YOUR DOG ON FLESH, YOUR STINKING FLESH IS A CONSTANT BATTLE FOR YOU AND YOU'RE ALL THE TIME FIGHTING IT. SO JESUS SAYS, "DON'T DO THAT BECAUSE MY YOKE IS EASY. MY BURDEN IS LIGHT. HOW DO I GET THAT? BY THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; YOU YOU YOU YOU BECOME BORN AGAIN OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. SO IN REVELATION CHAPTER 1, GIDEON, let's go there. REVELATION CHAPTER 1. Now catch it. VERSE ONE. THE REVELATION OF JESUS Christ which God gave to him to do what? Keep it to himself. NO, TO SHOW IT TO HIS SERVANTS, things which must SHORTLY COME TO PASS. And moreover, HE SENT AND SIGNIFIED IT BY HIS ANGEL UNTO HIS SERVANT JOHN, WHO BEAR RECORD OF THE WORD. SO THIS THING IS SO SECURED AND DOUBLE SECURED AND triple secured. WHO BEAR RECORD OF THE WORD OF GOD AND OF THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS CHRIST AND OF ALL THINGS THAT HE SAW. SO IF YOU BELIEVE JOHN WAS a real Christian, you can believe the book of Revelation &gt;&gt; because he's writing what he saw and heard. &gt;&gt; Blessed is he that readeth and they that hear THE WORDS OF THIS PROPHECY AND KEEP THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE WRITTEN FOR THE TIME IS AT HAND. NOW LET ME SAY IT LIKE THIS. SO THE THE BOOK OF revelation arriving uh you know to the early church very late in its in ITS DEVELOPMENT BY THE TIME THE JOHN COMES BACK. HE'S AN OLD MAN. HE'S THE LAST LIVING APOSTLE. THEY'VE ALL BEEN KILLED. HE'S THE LAST ONE ALIVE. PAUL'S LONG AGO GONE. THEY'VE ALL JAMES WAS PUT TO THE SWORD. PETER HAS BEEN CRUCIFIED. THOMAS WAS, YOU KNOW, lanced in IN INDIA FROM BEHIND AS HE WAS PRAYING. THEY and and you can go read the history. Some of them were flayed alive. I THINK BARTHOLOMEW AND DIFFERENT ONES. JOHN IS THE LAST ONE. HE COMES BACK FROM PATMAS WITH THIS BOOK. AND SO WHEN WE WHEN WE REALIZE THAT THE BOOK OF revelation that arrived to the church very late in its in the development of the church and that when it arrived IT ARRIVED SEALED FROM UNDERSTANDING. SO IT ARRIVED LATE. THE MESSENGER IS ALREADY GONE. &gt;&gt; PAUL CAN'T EVEN PREACH FROM IT. &gt;&gt; YOU YOU GET ME? &gt;&gt; SO IT ARRIVES LATE. PAUL'S ALREADY GONE. THERE'S NO ONE TO UNLOCK IT. IT'S SEALED UP FROM UNDERSTANDING SO THAT IT SHOULDN'T SURPRISE US. IT SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISING OR DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT THAT THE BOOK OF REVELATION IS A BOOK FOR THE END TIME BRIDE TO RECEIVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; See uh and and and AND UNDER PER AND WITH PERFECT CLARITY SEE OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD. AND NOT ONLY NOT ONLY TO RECEIVE IT IN THE END TIME WITH PERFECT CLARITY CUZ NO AGE HAD REMEMBER IT CAME LATE. &gt;&gt; IT WAS ALREADY SEALED. &gt;&gt; PAUL'S GONE. SO AND THE AND THE AGES ONLY WENT FURTHER AWAY FROM THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; SO IT BECAME WHAT ONCE ONCE THE BOOK ARRIVED THERE WAS ALREADY LESS THAN NO CHANCE FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT CONTAINED THINGS OF PROPHECY THAT THEY DID NOT EVEN KNOW THEY WERE GOING TO BE FACING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THOSE THOSE CHURCH AGES MEANT REALLY THEY COULD READ WHAT PETER WHAT JOHN WROTE MEANT NOTHING TO THEM. THEY READ ABOUT YOU KNOW I SAW AND I WAS IN THE THRONE ROOM AND ONE SAT ON THE THRONE AND THERE YOU KNOW THERE'S LIVING CREATURES AND THERE'S SEVEN STARS IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND YOU KNOW AND AND IF YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN STANDING THERE GO LISTEN HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. CHURCH IS GOING TO FALL AWAY. There's going to be seven ages of seven messengers. you're going to restore it back under, you know, as a caterpillar. What? What? What? Huh? &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; THEY WOULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT AT ALL BECAUSE IT DIDN'T APPLY TO THEM. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID JESUS DIDN'T EVEN LET THEM KNOW. &gt;&gt; SEE, &gt;&gt; SO THERE WAS SO MUCH THEY THEY THEY THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT it would mean that the seven seals would be open at THE END TIME. THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHY IT WAS SEVEN SEALED. &gt;&gt; WELL, WHAT'S WHAT'S THE WHOLE SEALING ABOUT? AND SO YOU KNOW WHY WHY IS THAT ONE STANDING THERE AND JOHN SAID I WAS CRYING AND THE THEOPHONY SAID TO ME DON'T WEEP THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH. I'M NOT SAYING THEY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND AND SEE LITTLE PORTRAITS OF CHRIST BUT THAT BOOK WAS HELD TO THE END TIME FOR THE BRIDE OF CHRIST TO RECEIVE THE UNSEALING OF THE BOOK AND IN SEE UNSEALING IT SHE CAN KNOW WHO BY REVELATION THAT CHRIST IS. AND WHEN YOU KNOW THAT THEN YOU UNDERSTAND WHO YOU ARE AND THEN YOU UNDERSTAND THE DRAMA. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU LOOK BACK UNDER THAT WHITE HORSE RIDER AND ALL THE EARLY CHURCH AND THE MARTYRDOM AND THE red horse and the black horse and Luther AND ALL AND THE MAN age and the eagle age and YOU GO, "WOW." &gt;&gt; IT MAKES SENSE TO ME. IT'S A DRAMA. IT WAS A DRAMA ALL ALONG IS BEING PLAYED OUT LIKE A PLAYWRIGHT WROTE IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I JUST WANT THAT IN YOUR MIND SO YOU CAN FOLLOW ME MORE EASILY. SO WE WE CAN SEE THEN THAT THE BRIDE OF THE END time would literally BE BIRTHED BY THE OPENING OF THESE mysteries contained IN THIS SEALED UP BOOK. AND SHE WOULD ACTUALLY WITH THAT OPENING RECEIVE HER MARCHING ORDERS FOR HER DAY CUZ SHE'S GOT MARCHING ORDERS. &gt;&gt; There's other marching ORDERS THAT WERE HISTORICAL THAT APPLIED TO THE TO THE OTHER CHURCHES THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY ANY BEARING ON. HERE'S THE ONLY BEARING THAT THOSE PAST AGES HAVE ON YOU. EVERYTHING THAT SATAN WAS IN THE DECEPTION OF THE WHITE HORSE, EVERYTHING HE WAS IN THE TYRANNY OF THE RED HORSE, EVERYTHING HE WAS IN THE DARK AGE BLACK HORSE IS ALL BOUND UP TOGETHER. AND YOU'RE FACING IT IN THE DAYS OF THE PALE HORSE. &gt;&gt; BUT THANK GOD, EVERYTHING THAT THE CHURCH WAS UNDER THE LION AND UNDER THE OX AND UNDER THE MAN AND UNDER THE FLYING EAGLE, WE HAVE THE DEVIL'S ANSWER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND WE'VE COME DOWN AND THE WHOLE THING HAS BEEN A DRAMA PLAYING OUT ACROSS 20 CENTURIES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOTHING BY ACCIDENT. HOW COULD YOU LOOK AT THAT AND SEE HOW IT OVERLAYS WITH HISTORY? AND WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM took the book of Revelation and laid it over with history and you could see it all PLAY OUT, THEN HOW WOULD YOU THINK THIS HAS NOT BEEN AN EXACT SCIENCE? &gt;&gt; THIS HAS NOT BEEN FUZZY MATH. THIS HAS BEEN AN EXACT SCIENCE. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU TODAY, GOD HAS EXACTLY HIS BRIDE. HE HAS EXACTLY HIS WORD. HE HAS EXACTLY THE HOLY GHOST. YOU'RE GOING TO EXACTLY BE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. YOU'RE YOU'RE EXACTLY GOING TO BRING THE DEAD OUT OF THE GRAVE. YOU'RE EXACTLY GOING TO BE CAUGHT UP IN A RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; THIS HASN'T BEEN LEFT TO GUESSWORK OR SOMEBODY FLIPPING A SWITCH. THIS IS GOD DOING IT. AND AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THEY PAUL LOOKED BACK ON THE OLD, YOU KNOW, ON THE SAINTS BEFORE AND SAID, "THEY WITHOUT US COULDN'T BE MADE PERFECT." WELL, HEY PAUL, YOU WITHOUT US CAN NEVER BE MADE PERFECT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS ABOUT THE FIVE STARS LINING UP AND THE APPROACH OF THE SEALS. HE SAID, "WHAT IS IT ANNOUNCING? AN INFANT BRIDE? &gt;&gt; It's announcing her approach." SO, SHE'S BIRTHED BY THE END TIME WORD BEING BEING brought to light. She's receiving her marching orders. Her day would be the last day. What's called the last day. In fact, is not merely the end time, but the end of the end time. The final parts to be played out in God's great drama of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To redeem a gentile bride. matching Joseph having Azeneath. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; So, Brother Dale AND I WERE JUST DISCUSSING THIS THIS MORNING. YOU KNOW, YOU you you LOOK REMEMBER AS I'VE SHOWED YOU that those four living creatures around the throne. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The the the lion, the ox, the man, the eagle. &gt;&gt; And they were around the throne. They were they were spirits OF GOD. AND SO THEY WERE ANOINTINGS FOR EACH AGE, FOR HISTORICAL AGES, and and each and it AND IT KEPT COMBINING AND THE NEXT AGE AND THE NEXT AGE TILL FINALLY WE'VE GOT ALL OF THAT. SO WE FIND OUT THAT WHEN the bride goes up in a rapture, and this is rudimentary to you. I've taught it to you for years. When the bride goes up, that eagle ANOINTING DOES NOT FLY BACK TO THE THRONE. IT FLIES EAST. IT PICKS UP MOSES AND ELIJAH AND GOES TO THE 144,000 WHICH IS TYPED IN THE BIBLE AS BENJAMIN. SO IT'S 12,000 OUT OF EACH TRIBE, RIGHT? AND SO YOU SO AND BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS ABOUT HOW THIS BENJAMIN WHO WAS BORN IN JOSEPH'S ABSENCE. NOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM IS IS NOT CONTRADICTING THE SCRIPTURE. WE KNOW THAT BENJAMIN WAS A LITTLE BOY WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN INTO CAPTIVITY. THAT THAT'S NOT A CONFLICT BECAUSE THAT MATCHES THE THE NEW TESTAMENT GOSPELS PERFECTLY BECAUSE THOSE TRUE BROTHER BRAM SAID THOSE TRUE JEWS IN THE DAYS OF JESUS WOULD HAVE BELIEVED HIM BUT THEY WERE BLINDED. NOW WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE PHARISEES. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT PHARISEES AND SADDUCEES AND AND AND AND THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRUE JEWS. YOU SEE THEM LATER UNDER THE FIFTH SEAL. THEY GET ACCUMULATED UNDER THE UNDER THE NEW TESTAMENT ERA UNDER THE ERA OF OF CHRISTIANITY WHICH IS THREE AND A HALF YEARS OF JESUS MINISTRY AND THEN SEVEN CHURCH AGES OF THE ERA OF THE HOLY GHOST UNDER 2,000 YEARS AND THE FIFTH SEAL THERE IS PILED UP UNDER THE THRONE AND AND AND AND WE SEE THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE TRUE JEWS WHO DID NOT HAVE THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS. &gt;&gt; THEY HAD THE TESTIMONY THAT THEY HELD WHICH WAS THE LAW OF MOSES BUT THEY'RE GOD'S TRUE FAMILY. THEY'RE DESTINED TO BE IN THE MILLENNIUM BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO SET UP JERUSALEM AND ISRAEL IS GOING TO BE THE LEADING NATION OF THE WORLD AND FROM THERE THE KING AND THE QUEEN WILL REIGN AND THROUGH A THOUSAND YEARS OF MILLENNIUM HIS JUSTICE AND HIS LAWS WILL BE SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD AS NATIONS RISE. YOU FOLLOW ME? &gt;&gt; SO, SO YOU REALIZE THEN THAT IT IT SO SO SO IT'S NOT THAT BENJAMIN WASN'T ACTUALLY BORN. IT'S THAT BY THE TIME BY THE TIME JOSEPH GOES INTO CAPTIVITY, THEY'VE HAD NO RELATIONSHIP. JUST LIKE JESUS, HE WAS ALIVE. THEY WERE ALIVE, BUT THERE WAS NO RELATIONSHIP CUZ THEY WERE BLINDED. THE TYPE FITS PERFECTLY. BUT NOW, AFTER 2,000 YEARS, SOMETHING IN THE LOINS OF JOSEPH, SOMETHING DEEP WITHIN HIM WAS BURNING. I WANT TO KNOW BENJAMIN. I WANT TO KNOW THOSE 144,000, 12,000 OUT OF EACH TRIBE BECAUSE I'VE GOT A WHOLE PLACE UNDER THE ALTAR, UNDER THE FIFTH SEAL WHERE THEY'RE HELD THERE. AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE JUST LIKE THE BRIDE'S PERFECTION TO RAISE THE DEAD FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF GENTILES. IT'S GOING TO TAKE THE BENJAMIN PERFECTION TO BELIEVE THE MESSAGE AND RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST. AND THEN THAT'S GOING TO EMPTY OUT THE SOULS UNDER THE ALTAR AND THEY'RE GOING TO COME BACK TO EARTH WITH US IN A MILLENNIUM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YES. &gt;&gt; SO YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT UP. THAT FITS SO PERFECTLY IN THE SCRIPTURE. SO, SO WHEN WE LOOK AT IT IN THIS WAY, WE SEE FOR THESE BLESSED IS HE THAT readeth verse three of uh Revelation 1. AND THEY THAT HEAR THE WORDS OF THIS PROPHECY AND KEEP THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE WRITTEN. NOW, I've already proved to you this is you for the time is at hand. So, the real meat of this book of Revelation is to be lived out when the time is at hand. &gt;&gt; NOW, I GET IT. 2,000 YEARS IS ONLY TWO DAYS WITH GOD. I understand all of that. But let's let's BE FOR REAL. I MEAN, I I'M NOT 2,000 YEARS AWAY FROM THE FROM THE MILLENNIUM. I'M NOT 2,000 YEARS AWAY FROM A RAPTURE. I DON'T BELIEVE I MIGHT NOT BE TWO YEARS. WE MIGHT NOT BE TWO MONTHS OR TWO WEEKS. OUR HOMECOMING IS SOON. AND THIS IS THE TIME. THE TIME IS AT HAND. AND WHEN THE TIME IS AT HAND, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE A PEOPLE WHO HEAR THE PROPHECY AND KEEP THOSE THINGS &gt;&gt; WHICH ARE WRITTEN. &gt;&gt; SO THIS IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THE TIME TO BE GETTING SLACK. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THE TIME TO be carnal. &gt;&gt; This is the exact opposite OF THAT TIME. WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IS IS THE CUTTING EDGE ON FIRE. DO YOU HONESTLY THINK that when they're at the last STAGE OF THE TRIBULATION PERIOD, MOSES AND ELIJAH ARE GOING TO HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, FUMBLE AROUND WITH THOSE JEWS BEING CARNAL? &gt;&gt; YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CONSTANTLY TELL THE WOMEN HOW THEY SHOULD DRESS AND HOW THE MEN SHOULD DO AND ACT AND HOW TEENAGE YEAH, I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO ANY OF THAT. THERE'S GOING TO BE A ZEAL. THEY'RE GOING TO BE READY. WE'LL ALREADY BE AT A MARRIAGE SUPPER. OH, HALLELUJAH. WELL, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, FRIENDS, THAT MARRIAGE SUPPER IS RIGHT UPON US. AND THIS IS NOT A TIME TO BE CONSTANTLY LIVING ON THE EDGE OF CARNALITY. YOUR REDEMPTION DRAWETH NIGH. [Music] &gt;&gt; SO, IT BE THE LAST DAY. AND SO, THE FINAL PARTS OF THAT BOOK ARE TO BE PLAYED OUT IN GOD'S GREAT DRAMA OF REDEMPTION. You know, you can you can see and I AND I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY THE THE THE MILLIONS THAT WILL NO DOUBT FILL THE MILLENNIAL WORLD. Uh even heathens raised UP TO HEAR THE GOSPEL. IT WON'T TAKE LONG TO POPULATE. Go back to the days of Noah. It was just a couple of generations. They were already forming nations. &gt;&gt; This nation's 250 whatever years old. And look, I mean, we look back on George Washington, man, that was ages ago. To us, it was. IMAGINE IF YOU WERE IF THAT WAS RIGHT NOW, WE WOULDN'T EVEN BE A QUARTER OF THE WAY &gt;&gt; through the millennium. SO, YOU UNDERSTAND? TRY TO GET YOUR MIND AROUND THOUSAND YEARS IS A LONG TIME. AND SO, AND THEN, OF COURSE, AFTER THAT, WE KNOW THAT THAT UH THE JUDGMENT WILL COME AND and the dead, both small AND GREAT, WILL STAND. THE SEA WILL GIVE UP ITS DEAD. THE GRAVES, ALL THE GRAVES WILL THERE THERE'LL BE A SECOND GENERAL RESURRECTION. AND WE KNOW THAT THAT the new heavens and the new earth WILL BE FILLED WITH MANY MILLIONS, NO DOUBT, WHO NEVER WERE ELECTED BRIDE. THEY NEVER COULD SEE THE MESSAGE. BROTHER BROWN TALKS ABOUT THE FOOLISH virgin who go through THE TRIBULATION FOR THEIR SIN OF REJECTING THE MESSAGE CUZ SEE THE MESSAGE WOULD HAVE GAVE THEM THE NEW BIRTH. YEAH. &gt;&gt; SO, THEY HAD A AN OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT ON THEIR FLESH AND ON THEIR on on THEIR FLESH AND THEIR SPIRIT. AND THE PROOF OF that is THAT THEY LIVED SANCTIFIED LIVES. &gt;&gt; THEY THEY DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE TRUTH, BUT THEY WERE RIGHTEOUS LIVING PEOPLE. THE BOOK OF REVELATION CALLS THEM SAINTS. MATTHEW 25 CALLS THEM RIGHTEOUS, YOU KNOW. AND AND I AND AND AND I HEARD BROTHER JD THIS MORNING TALKING ABOUT THE SAD DEATH OF CHARLIE KIRK. LISTEN FRIENDS, THAT IF THAT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR YOU, IT SHOULD SHOW YOU IT THAT IT'S A PRECURSOR TO THE RIGHTEOUS REMNANT OF THE WOMAN'S SEED IN THE TRIBULATION WHO WILL BE HUNTED DOWN LIKE DOGS AND KILLED. &gt;&gt; AND I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT, MAN, HOW'S THAT WITH OUR CONSTITUTION IN THE CIVILIZED WORLD? HOW ARE THEY GOING TO HUNT DOWN GOD'S THE REMNANT OF THE WOMAN'S SEED, THOSE UNWISE VIRGINS? HOW ARE THEY GOING TO BE HUNTED DOWN AND KILLED? I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE SAW AN EXAMPLE, A PRECURSOR OF IT. YEAH. &gt;&gt; SEE, &gt;&gt; SO YOU KNOW, UM, WHEN THAT HAPPENED, BROTHER JASON PUT IN OUR BETHL MINISTRY TEAM CHAT. UM, he said, "WITHIN MINUTES, I SAW THE FOOTAGE ON X AND KNEW HE WAS DEAD. I BROKE OUT INTO TEARS. IMMEDIATELY WE WATCHED HUNDREDS OF HIS VIDEOS AS A FAMILY. BETWEEN THIS AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THE UKRAINIAN girl on the train IN CHARLOTTE, THE STAGE IS BEING SET FOR A FULL UNITING OF CATHOLICS AND PROTESTANTS TO JOIN TOGETHER TO FIGHT COMMUNISM. EVEN ELON MUSK IS CALLING FOR RELIGIOUS REVIVAL. THE STAGE IS BEING SET FOR A MAJOR CRACKDOWN BY THE RIGHT. When when I read that, BROTHER BRANDHAM'S QUOTE POPPED INTO MY MIND FROM THE BOOK FROM HIS SERIES ON Hebrews 1957. Now remember THIS IS 57 THE FIRST THIS IS YEAR ONE OF AMERICA IN JUDGMENT. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; SHE HAD FOR ALL OF THOSE YOU KNOW for for HUNDREDS OF YEARS SHE HAD BEEN A NATION BLESSED BY GOD. BUT NOW 1956 WAS HER LAST OPPORTUNITY AND SHE REJECTED IT AND NOW SHE'S UNDER JUDGMENT AND THAT WAS THE LAST NATION. &gt;&gt; ALL THE OTHERS HAD ALREADY REJECTED IT AND AND HAD ALREADY BEEN PUT UNDER JUDGMENT AND NOW AMERICA NOW THE WHOLE WORLD. &gt;&gt; NO WONDER A PROPHET COULD COME AND SAY I INDICT THIS GENERATION. &gt;&gt; NOT TALKING ABOUT THE GENERATION THAT lived 2,000 YEARS AGO. I'M INDICTING THIS GENERATION for the second crucifixion of the Lord Jesus because they crucified his word. THIS IS 1957, FIRST JUDGMENT, year one. GREAT PERILOUS TIMES ARE AT hand and more trouble laying in the road. Boy, wouldn't we love to go back to the perilous times of 1957? Amen. &gt;&gt; Goodness, GREAT PERILOUS TIMES ARE AT HAND. OKAY, BROTHER BRANDHAM, I get it. Boy, if you see our day, AND MORE TROUBLE IS LAYING IN THE ROAD. AND HOW? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And we know, AND YOU WEREN'T WRONG, BROTHER BRANDHAM. You weren't wrong. We're witnesses. You weren't wrong. AND WE KNOW THAT THERE WILL NEVER BE BETTER TIMES. &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT WE'RE AT THE END. AMEN. &gt;&gt; FROM 1957, YEAR ONE OF JUDGMENT, TIMES WILL CONTINUE TO GET WORSE AND WORSE UNTIL JESUS comes according to the scripture. And I wrote a response when brother Jason wrote that in. I said, I have surmised for some time now from various scriptures and things. Brother Brandham said that the that the that Brother Brandham said that the RADICAL LEFT WOULD DRIVE THE PROTESTANTS AND CATHOLIC CHURCH together uh to crush THE LEFT WHICH WOULD ULTIMATELY WEAPONIZE THE BEAST TO CRUSH ALL OTHER DISSCENT GOING FORWARD. WE KNOW THE WORLD IS ON A ONE-WAY ROAD TO ARMAGEDDON AND MUST get worse and worse. SEE BECAUSE THE BINDING OF THE TEARS, THEY DON'T NEVER UNBIND. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? THEY GO TO THE BURNING BOUND. &gt;&gt; SO ONCE THE ONCE THIS UNION OF THE BEAST AND THE CHURCH FORMS, IT WILL NEVER UNWIND UNTIL HUMANITY SELF-DESTRUCTS GLOBALLY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You still got me? Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm watching my time and I want to I'm trying to pace myself. I want to get so far and I don't want to hurry too much. BROTHER BRANDON MAKES A REFERENCE to you know many Bible stories and we could spend the whole rest of the services going over them in depth. Brother would take one and preach a whole sermon on it. you know, uh, when he talks about, uh, having conferences and he talks about the Eden conference and what are we going to do about sin and, uh, the family of God has fallen AND BROTHER BRANDHAM DESCRIBES THAT AS A AS A DRAMA. And I mean, it's it's it's riveting. I mean, you want to talk about MAKE FOR GOOD READING, GO LISTEN TO THE TAPE. IT'S IT'S IT'S SPINE TINGLING, BROTHER BRANDON. AND I CAN'T EVEN DUPLICATE THE WAY HE SAYS IT. UH, WE MIGHT HAVE PLAYED A SOUND BITE HERE. I SOMEWHERE I RECENTLY PLAYED A SOUNDBITE. GOD KNEW THAT THAT SHOCKING STATE WHEN GOD KNEW THAT THAT SHOCKING STATE OF EMERGENCY. HE SAYS IN ANOTHER PLACE WHEN WORD REACHED GOD THAT HIS CHILDREN HAD FALLEN. &gt;&gt; HE SAID HE DIDN'T SEND AN ANGEL DOWN. HE SAID HE STEPPED OUT AND WENT DOWN HIMSELF. AND HE SAYS, "GOD, WHEN GOD KNEW THAT THAT SHOCKING STATE OF EMERGENCY, I SUPPOSE THE FIRST EVER CAME TO HEAVEN, WAS WHEN HE HEARD THAT HIS children was lost, he came frantically up and down the garden. ADAM, MY SON, ADAM, WHERE ART THOU?" THAT HE SAYS, "THE THE FATHER, THERE STOOD ADAM AND EVE, THEIR FIG LEAVES SEWED TOGETHER BEHIND A BUSH, AND THE FATHER GOING BACK AND FORTH SCREAMING, WHERE ARE YOU? WHERE ARE YOU?" AND I AND I AND I THINK THE LAST TIME I BELIEVE IT WAS HERE WHERE I WAS SHOWING YOU THE INFLECTION WHERE HE SAYS, "WHERE ARE YOU? WHERE ARE YOU?" &gt;&gt; AND YOU GO LISTEN TO THE TAPE, THAT'S HOW HE SAYS IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT ADAM, I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE. I'M GOD, BUT YOU'RE HIDING AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE. IT'S NEVER going to BE THAT. IT'S GOD WHO HIDES THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS. BUT IT'S NE THERE'S NOTHING YOU WILL EVER DO. DAVID SAID, "IF I MAKE MY BED IN HELL, HE SEES ME. IF I TAKE THE WINGS AND SOAR INTO THE WILDERNESS, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, THOU ART WITH ME. I'M SO GLAD FOR THAT. AND SO HE SAYS, HE WHERE ARE YOU? IT'S NOT WHERE ARE YOU? I CAN'T FIND YOU. IT'S WHERE ARE YOU, ADAM? HOW DID YOU GET INTO THIS FALLEN STATE? HOW DID YOU LET THAT HAPPEN? &gt;&gt; IT'S THE IT'S THE SAME MESSAGE TO THE BRIDE TODAY. HOW ARE YOU FIND YOURSELF CARNAL? &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR PRAYER LIFE? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR CHURCH ATTENDANCE? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FAMILY? COME ON. WE'RE AT THE END TIME. THIS ISN'T A TIME TO BE WALKING AROUND IN THE WILDERNESS. THIS A TIME FOR GOING HOME. &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE YOU, ADAM? &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT WAS A DRAMA. HE TALKS ABOUT THE DRAMA AT KADES. HE SAYS, "A GREAT DRAMA OF THE BIBLE." THEY HAD TO MAKE A DECISION THERE. HE COMES TO THE JUNCTION OF TIME, THE COMING DRAMA. NOW, WATCH THIS. HERE'S A COMING DRAMA IN THE FUTURE. We're going into the millennium. That's right. TIME WILL CEASE AT THIS JUNCTION AND ETERNITY will begin FOR US AND NEVER NO MORE. AND IF THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH ALL OF THESE THINGS when all the world's history is climaxing in this great drama and he's talking about going into the millennium. &gt;&gt; You're talking about a drama for the ages. a climaxing final scene. The last scenes OF FALLEN MAN, HIS 6,000-YEAR RUN IN A FALLEN condition coming to an end. And Armageddon is on the scene. And Christ has come out with his bride. And Moses and Elijah have been killed and resurrected. The 144,000 KILLED AND RESURRECTED. AND NOW HE COMES BACK AND THE WORLD GOES DOWN INTO NUCLEAR ANNIHILATION. AND THE BRIDE STEPS OUT ON THE ASHES OF THE WICKED TO REBUILD the earth AND START IT AGAIN. YOU TALKING ABOUT A DRAMA. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A FINAL SCENE IN THE CLOSING SCRIPT. THAT'S THE PART I WANT TO BE AT. HALLELUJAH. I DON'T WANT TO BE IN THAT ONE THAT GOES DOWN IN NUCLEAR FIRE. I WANT TO BE THAT ONE THAT IS RIDING RIGHT BESIDE OF CHRIST. AND YOU SAY, "WELL, HOW DO I KNOW HIM?" THE BIBLE SAYS HIS NAME WAS THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A MYSTERY TO US WHO HE IS. IT'S A MYSTERY TO THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S BEEN REVEALED to us. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO THAT'S NOT JUST TO FILL US WITH SUPERNOWLEDGE. &gt;&gt; IT'S TO MAKE A SUPER CHURCH. IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S TO BE A MANIFESTATION. YOUR KNOWLEDGE IS SUPPOSED TO SUPPOSED TO ACT ITSELF OUT. &gt;&gt; JUST LIKE JESUS ACTED OUT THE LIFE OF GOD, YOU'RE TO ACT OUT THE LIFE OF CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So then WE COME TO OUR HERE. I'M JUST GIVING YOU EXAMPLES OF DRAMA. HERE'S PRESENT DAY DRAMA THAT'S UNFOLDING RIGHT NOW. HE GOES ON IN THE JUNCTION OF TIME. WHAT'S THE MATTER? What makes people so nervous? WHY IS IT EVEN PSYCHIATRISTS ARE COMING TO BE PRAYED FOR? WHY IS IT THE WORLD IS IN A NERVOUS AGE, &gt;&gt; A NEUROTIC AGE? AND THAT'S THE end the the beginning of 56, the last year of mercy, &gt;&gt; THE LAST YEAR OF GRACE. AND PSYCHIATRISTS ARE ARE ALREADY COMING FOR PRAYER. THE LAST YEAR OF GOD'S GRACE AND IT'S ALREADY A NERVOUS age and a neurotic age. HE SAYS, "WHAT'S THE MATTER? THERE'S a great drama being set." &gt;&gt; That's right. And the lion hungered nations are RAVISHING IN. BUT JUST BEFORE HE GETS ABLE TO TAKE IT, God will take his church. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO YOU UNDERSTAND FRIENDS, THAT'S THE DRAMA THAT'S SETTING IN UPON US RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS IN THREE KINDS OF BELIEVERS 1963 HE GOES AND REFERENCES MATTHEW 16 and you know who do men say that I the son of man am? You've read it and well some say Elias or Jeremiah one of the prophets but who do you say that I am? And Simon said those notable unforgettable words thou art the Christ the son of the living God. And there's where you remember Jesus says blessed art thou Simon and I've shown you it from the Greek that is a word mccarius which doesn't it means anything but fortunate a lot of times it I remember spirit zodiatis the the eminent Greek scholar and and my first bible was edited by him uh key greek key Greek Hebrew key study Bible and he says it's it's it's sad that sometimes that word blessed art thou Simon gets translated as fortune he says not fortunate at all. It has nothing to do with being lucky. &gt;&gt; What he's saying to Peter McCarius, he's saying, Peter, there is something in you possess the characteristic of deity. And that's how you know who I am cuz we have a mutual father and we're of the same bloodline. And you know who I am and I know who I say thou art Peter AND UPON THIS I'LL BUILD MY WHOLE CHURCH UPON THE REVELATION OF WHO I AM THAT GOD HAS GIVEN US. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. FRIENDS, YOU REALIZE THAT YOU ARE GOD'S VALIDATION IN THIS DAY OF HIS REVELATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BLESSED ART THOU SON OF JONAS. SEE, THOU ALONE, PETER SAYS, THOU ALONE HAS THE WORDS OF LIFE. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE. SEE? And so, SO, SO BROTHER BRANDHAM GOES ON. I'M JUST SKIPPING DOWN. THEN, YOU KNOW, HE go when when many leave him, says, "Will you go also?" And there comes Peter again. Lord, where will we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS, YOU KNOW, HE PICKING UP HERE, THOU ALONE HAS THE WORDS OF LIFE. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE. NOT ONLY DID HE HAVE THE WORDS OF LIFE, HE WAS the word of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, it was revealed to him. It was revealed to Peter that Jesus was that living word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, that's a genuine believer. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a genuine believer. &gt;&gt; Yes. When it's revealed to you that he's a living word, that is never true unless he's living the word in you. &gt;&gt; If the word is not living in you, I understand we make mistakes and flub ups and trip and fall and stumble, but I can't live there anymore. I can't stay there. I can't stay down. I got to repent and get back up because I got to live the word. I can't help myself but be a Christian. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; See, it was revealed to him that he was that LIVING WORD. NOW, THAT'S A GENUINE BELIEVER WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT, NOT SOME PERSUADED BY ANOTHER PERSON, NOT NOT BY SOME OTHER THING. BUT, YOU KNOW, I WAS I WAS SPEAKING TO UM SARAH VLAD IN A IN IN a conversation pre premarital counseling and I and I WAS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE MESSAGE AND I SAID, "LISTEN, I SAID IT'S NOT DIFFICULT TO PERSUADE YOU of the of the message doctrines because they're easy to prove in the Bible. That's easy. That's the THAT'S THAT'S THE THAT'S THE sugar on top. That's not hard to do. We take all comers, all challengers, all questions, no no hesitation at all. We can easily defend the doctrines and the message of the hour, but that wouldn't give you a correct understanding of doctrine wouldn't give you the new birth. &gt;&gt; It the the CORRECT UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORD EQUIPS YOU WHEN YOU'VE HAD the new birth. &gt;&gt; So then you KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW, YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S UP. YOU CAN SEE YOU HAVE THE ANSWERS THAT THE WORLD IS LOOKING FOR AND YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND YOU ALREADY RECOGNIZE YOUR PLACE AND YOUR POSITION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SEE? &gt;&gt; SO HE SAID IT'S NOT PERSUADED BY SOME OTHER PERSON OR SOME OTHER THING, BUT WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT, HERE'S WHAT YOU SHOULD LONG FOR. IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD THIS EXPERIENCE, HERE'S WHAT YOU SHOULD LONG FOR. NOT TO MEMORIZE DOCTRINE, BUT WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS REVEALED TO YOU the word itself and you SEE THE WORD MADE PLAIN VINDICATED, THEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD COME AND GET INTO THAT AGE FOR THE WORD FOR THAT AGE and make IT MANIFESTED. THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE PASSED FROM DEATH TO LIFE. WHEN ALL YOUR WHOLE DESIRES OF EVERYTHING ARE CHANGED AND YOUR LIFE BECOMES A NEW MANIFESTATION, YOUR LIFE GETS A NEW SCRIPT AND YOUR LIFE IS A NEW DRAMA THAT'S BEING LIVED OUT AND IT GOES ALL THE WAY AND IT HAS AN ENDING SCENE. YOU GO UP, &gt;&gt; SATAN COMES DOWN AND A TABLE THOUSANDS OF MILES LONG. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE CLOSING SCENES OF MY DRAMA TODAY. &gt;&gt; OH MY. SO HE SAYS, "HOW COULD A MAN KEEP FROM BELIEVING Luther Wesley?" The same way they THEY HAD TO BELIEVE IT. THAT WAS THE MESSAGE TO THAT AGE. HERE WE ARE NOW. HERE WE ARE DOWN TO THE LEODYSIAN AGE. AND WE'RE TAUGHT IN THE LEODYSIAN AGE THAT CHRIST WAS PUT ON THE OUTSIDE OF HIS CHURCH. THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE. You can see that. AND WAS EVEN KNOCKING ON THE DOOR TRYING TO GET BACK IN. SO WHEN WE SEE THAT HAPPENING, WE KNOW WHAT AGE WE'RE LIVING IN. THEN WE'RE AT THE CLOSING HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THE BOOK IS NOW BEING FINISHED. THE LAST LINE WILL BE WROTE. YES, SIR. I WILL. I GOT TO BACK UP. I'M SORRY. THEN HE SAYS HERE, THIS IS HOW I GOT TO READ IT AGAIN. I'M SORRY. I'M under direction here. HE SAYS, WHEN WE SEE THAT HAPPENING, WHAT HAPPENING? WHEN WE CAN SEE CHRIST BEING PUT OUT OF THE CHURCH, &gt;&gt; WE CAN SEE THAT. WE CAN SEE THAT THE THAT THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH CERTAINLY HAS PUT CHRIST OUT. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS THAT'S WHEN WE SEE THAT THAT'S HOW WE KNOW WHAT AGE WE'RE LIVING IN. WHEN YOU CLAIM TO BE A MESSAGE BELIEVER AND YOU ARE NOT LIVING ACCORDING TO WHAT THE MESSAGE HAS BROUGHT TO US. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE NOT MANIFESTING THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR BEHIND SKIN. THEN IT'S LIKELY BECAUSE THAT YOU STILL SEE THAT CHURCH AS JUST FINE &gt;&gt; AND THAT WE'RE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A TIGHTER VERSION OF THAT, BUT WE'RE ALL GOING TO HEAVEN AND JESUS LOVES EVERYBODY, WHICH IS A PATENT LIE. THAT IS NOT TRUE. NONE OF THAT IS TRUE. IT'S ONLY TO WHOM THE SPIRIT WILL REVEAL IT AND THOSE HAVE TO BE ORDAINED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AND SO WHEN WHEN I WHEN I NO WONDER THAT SOMETIMES OUR SISTERS DON'T DRESS LIKE THEY SHOULD AND OUR BROTHERS DON'T AND CONDUCT THEMSELVES THE WAY THEY SHOULD IS BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE. GOD THE HOLY GHOST HAS NOT COME INTO YOU TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU WE ARE DIFFERENT. WE ARE NOT THAT AT ALL. WE HAVE BROUGHT CHRIST INTO OUR HEARTS AND WE ARE A DIFFERENT KIND OF PEOPLE. AND THAT'S WHO'S GOING IN THE RAPTURE. AND NO ONE &gt;&gt; ELSE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE ONLY THING THAT CAN GO IN THE RAPTURE IS HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT. IT'S NOT THE MAN THAT COMES PREDESTINATED. IT'S THE seed in the man. &gt;&gt; See, SO YOU REMEMBER THAT THE THAT THE BRIDE IN BROTHER BRANDHAM'S PREVIEW OF THE BRIDE, SHE GOT OUT OF STEP. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "Watching that other church, &gt;&gt; with her boogie woogie dance Christianity, &gt;&gt; with her rock and roll Christian music, &gt;&gt; WITH HER STRIPPING OFF THE women indecent and call themselves Christians &gt;&gt; and IT CAUSED THE SEE, THE BRIDE CAN'T BE DECEIVED, BUT SHE CAN SOMETIMES ALLOW THE CARNAL EDGES, ALLOW SATAN TO PULL HER AWAY AND LOOK AT THE WRONG THING." AND SHE STARTED GETTING OUT OF STEP AND IT TOOK A PROPHET TO SCREAM OUT, "GET BACK IN STEP. GET BACK IN LINE. I WANT TO TELL YOU TODAY, WE'RE ALMOST HOME. GET BACK IN LINE. QUIT WATCHING THE OTHER THING. THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY GO OFF A CLIFF. I UNDERSTAND GOD'S GONNA GIVE THEM MANY OF THEM SALVATION. THEY'RE THERE. MANY OF THEM GOING TO BE IN THE NEW HEAVENS AND THE NEW EARTH. PROBABLY MILLIONS OF THEM. BUT THAT'S A REMNANT OF THE WOMAN'S SEAT. DON'T CONFLATE THAT WITH A TOMMY ROD AND THE HYPOCRISY OF WHAT'S CALLED TODAY THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. THAT'S FILTH BEFORE GOD. THAT'S A HARLOT DAUGHTER TO THE HARLOT MOTHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I MAY NOT GET DOWN TO IT IN MY NOTES FAR ENOUGH TODAY, SO I'M GOING TO SAY IT NOW. We can WE CAN WE CAN HAVE ALL KINDS OF DEBATES, BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, YOU KNOW, EVEN EVEN WITHIN THE RANKS OF THE BRIDE, IT'S TOO BAD AND TOO SAD THAT SOMETIMES WE SPEND OUR OUR CURRENCY. YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR CURRENCY IS? YOUR LIFE SORT YOUR LIFE. YOUR TIME. YOU CAN'T GET IT BACK. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT CURRENCY IN YOUR BANK. &gt;&gt; That's going to go up in flames. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about the value of your home. That's going to go. The antichrist is going to take that. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about real currency. &gt;&gt; Where Jesus said, "Buy of me gold. Tried it in the fire." See, that you might be really rich. &gt;&gt; The one thing you can't get back is time. The one thing you can't get back is life. You're burning like a candle. You're burning it every day, and it's getting lower and lower and lower. That's your currency. How are you spending your currency? It's too bad that, you know, even within the ranks of the message, we we spend our currency ARGUING OVER WHAT HAPPENED ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST AND AND YOU KNOW, AND THE AND THE ARGUMENT IS, WELL, WHAT HAPPENED? AND AND WHEN IT COMES, WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE AND WHAT WILL IT DO AND WHAT WILL IT MANIFEST AND WHAT GIFT AND WHAT'LL HAPPEN? AND AND THIS ONE ARGUES AGAINST THAT ONE. AND AND AND THAT THAT AR NOW LISTEN THAT ARGUMENT IS ONLY RELATIVE THAT ARGUMENT IS ONLY RELATIVE IS ONLY IMPORTANT TO THE BRIDE TO THE TO THE DENOMINATIONAL WORLD. THAT ARGUMENT IS moot completely. &gt;&gt; SCRIPTURAL DOCTRINE ARGUMENTS AND DEBATES IS A MOOT POINT TO THE DENOMINATIONAL CHURCH BECAUSE EVERYONE WHO IS FOUND INSIDE OF A DENOMINATION WILL TAKE THE MARK OF THE BEAST. THE DENOMINATIONS ARE THE HARLOT DAUGHTERS &gt;&gt; OF THE GREAT &gt;&gt; AND AND AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE THE FOOLISH VIRGIN, THE ONLY THING THAT'LL SAVE HER SKIN IN THE TRIBULATION IS SHE WILL COME OUT OF THAT AND NOT TAKE THE MARK OF THE BEAST. SO THE ONLY WAY THEY EVEN ARE GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE IS LISTEN, EVERYBODY THAT WANTS TO BE IN HEAVEN IS GOING TO HAVE TO COME OUT OF HER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE PRIVILEGED TO COME ALL THE WAY OUT OF HER AND RECEIVE THE ENGRAFTED WORD. &gt;&gt; BUT EVERYBODY, CHARLIE KIRK AND ALL OF THEM WOULD HAVE TO COME OUT OF EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY DENOMINATION BECAUSE DENOMINATION, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID IT, TAUGHT IT, THUS SAYITH THE LORD, IT WILL LEAD YOU TO THE MARK OF THE BEAST AND THERE'S NO COMING BACK FROM THAT. &gt;&gt; IN FACT IS HE SAID, "OH, PEOPLE SAY, "OH, WELL, BROTHER BRANDHAM, I'LL GET OUT WHEN I SEE IT." HE SAID, "NO, YOU'LL YOU'LL FIND OUT. YOU'RE ALREADY TRAPPED IN IT. &gt;&gt; You're already marked. HE SAID, "YOU GET OUT NOW." SO, SO, SO THOSE KIND OF ARGUMENTS ARE REALLY ONLY RELATIVE TO THE BRIDE ANYWAY, YOU KNOW. AND I WOULD JUST SAY TO THE BRIDE AROUND THE WORLD WHO MAY BE LISTENING, CAN WE CAN WE SPEND OUR OUR CURRENCY ON BETTER THINGS? COULD I SPEND MY CURRENCY ON JUST MAKING SURE I HAVE THE EXPERIENCE AND LET GOD DECIDE HOW IT'LL MANIFEST IN WHAT GIFT AND HOW HE'LL GIFT THE CHURCH SEVERALLY AS HE WILL AND WHO WILL PROVIDE WHAT WHAT WHAT YOU KNOW UH THE THE JOINT THE PART THAT EVERY JOINT SUPPLY IT IT IT LET GOD DECIDE WHO'S GOING TO SUPPLY WHAT JOINT TO THIS PART OF THE CHURCH. LET GOD DECIDE HOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. JUST MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE EXPERIENCE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; USE YOUR CURRENCY DOING THAT. &gt;&gt; INSTEAD OF THE SILLY ARGUMENTS THAT GO BACK AND FORTH. &gt;&gt; I THINK IF YOU REALLY SPEND YOUR CURRENCY CORRECTLY, YOU WON'T BE A PARTY TO nonsense arguments like that. I think you'll be you'll be looking in the book going, "Lord, HOW CAN I MANIFEST YOU MORE?" AND WHATEVER way you want to, how you ever you want to gift THE CHURCH SEVERALLY AS YOU WILL. However you want EACH JOINT TO SUPPLY ITS OWN PART, HOWEVER YOU WANT IT TO MANIFEST IN ME, THAT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FROM MY NEIGHBOR OR DIFFERENT IN ONE CHURCH and different AT THIS CHURCH AND OR VICE VERSA. AND IT MIGHT BE ONE THIS MONTH AND FLIP TO THE NEXT MONTH. I DON'T KNOW. IT DOESN'T MATTER. I JUST WANT TO KNOW HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO KNOW HIM AND THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE'RE IN A DRAMA AND IT'S ALMOST OVER. WE'RE AT THE CLOSING SCENES. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THAT HERE. WE'RE AT THE CLOSING OF HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THE BOOK IS NOW BEING FINISHED. THE LAST LINE WILL BE WROTE ACROSS IT SOMEDAY AND SHALL BE closed up. Then time shall be no more. And there is a great drama being set and angels ARE STANDING OVER THE SKIES WATCHING. YOU KNOW WHAT A DRAMA IS? THE ACTORS ARE READY. You can see them acting. You can see the evil one acting. You can see the villain of the play. HOW HE'S COME ON THE scene with his cunningness to deceive. And and you REMEMBER BROTHER BRANDON TALKS ABOUT SHAKESPEARE AND MCBTH and Carmen. And I think Rebecca played in Carmen. AND AND BROTHER BROWN SAID, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WHEN WHEN he wrote that for the king of England, he Shakespeare did not believe in witches, but the king of England believed in witches. So Shakespeare to make the king happy had to include witches inside of his play. AND SO THERE AND BROTHER BAM TALKS ABOUT HOW THAT THEY HAD JUST HAD IT AT JEFF Jeff High AND I'VE I'VE BEEN TO Jeff High and they have really tremendous productions there. Uh it's kind of one of THEIR THINGS. AND SO HE SAID AND SO BROTHER BRANDHAM HAD SEEN IT HAD SAW EVEN REBECCA PLAYING A PART. HE SAYS you can see the evil one acting. You can see THE VILLAIN OF THE PLAY AND NOW HE'S COME ON THE SCENE WITH HIS CUNNINGNESS TO DECEIVE, BUT YOU CAN ALSO SEE THE RAPTURED CHURCH MAKING HERSELF READY. IT'S A GREAT SCENE. &gt;&gt; Oh man, it's a great scene. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SEE THE PRESENCE OF GOD VINDICATING AND MAKING THE DRAMA THAT'S FORETOLD here in this Bible TO ACT ITSELF OUT. WHAT A TIME TO LIVE. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU AMEN THAT TODAY? WHAT A TIME TO LIVE. THE MOST GLORIOUS TIME. THE MAN OF ALL AGES HAS LONGED FOR THIS TIME. THE PROPHETS OF OLD LONGED TO SEE THIS HOUR, BUT WASN'T PRIVILEGED. &gt;&gt; But you have been privileged to not only see it, but to and to believe it, but to be it. &gt;&gt; How many beers are here today? &gt;&gt; How many believers? How many beers? &gt;&gt; HOW MANY WANNABE BEERS? &gt;&gt; COME ON, STAND UP. STAND UP TO YOUR FEET WITH ME. RAISE UP THOSE HANDS SO THE LORD CAN SEE IT. I WANT TO BE THE WORD, LORD. I WANT TO FULFILL MY PART OF THE DRAMA. I WANT TO LIVE OUT. I WANT THE SCRIPT. I WANT MY LIFE TO BE MATCHING THE SHEETWORK. I DON'T WANT TO BE FIGURING MY OWN SELF OUT. THE WORLD'S GOING TO GO INTO CHAOS AND IT'S ALREADY GONE INTO CHAOS AND I DON'T WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT. I want to be in that number. I'm in that number. Come on, musicians. Anthony, come on.
