========================================

praise the lord so brother kevin we're all straight then ah you got it perfect that's excellent brother all right so i want then to rather that since i'm only using slide one and slide two brother kevin then to our very first slide uh the very next slide and uh should be the other day when i was driving in the other day when i was driving in streaming brother jason to mars and i hit a certain part in the it froze up on me because i'd like to get that audio signals going up and down plus you're not distracted all right so we want then to look at this very first verse we're still on it this is part six but imagine we're still on verse one the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pain job a little bit how i'm going through this book of revelation i realized that even with today being part six the way i'm going about it i mean just to get through the first couple of verses of the very first set in on teaching ministry before i have the entire collection uh for that brother lonnie jenkins preached on back in the late 90s and early 20s and early 2000s and so it should be and so we're we're but but if i'm going that methodically um it's going to take it could take a year now i want to announce that on our podcast that we are beginning to stream we have finished our introduction video we're now going to begin uh holding the podcast i am planning to go through the book of revelation like i have been very methodically and if it takes me 500 recordings to do it i want to go through the entire book but here because our sunday school class is limited to just 25 minutes i want to just do it a little bit more an overview i still plan to stop and hover over parts that i think are very very important last time we had the church understanding that we we brought it down to to the bride and i was making this a fading out of one a starting up of another and a different star different messenger with a different mission and a different and a further understanding of the word and so because of that that all of those ages unbeknownst to them because god because if you you know brother branham uh talks about how that the lord would not really let them know that it was going to be 2 000 years that would have discouraged them because you know as well as i know that that a belief in the immediacy of christ's return is strengthening and uh i don't think the lord wanted to them to lose that i think in every age he wanted to believe he wanted them to believe that his return was imminent now we can look back in hindsight over 2000 years of history we now have the restoration of the original teaching of the apostles by the opening of the seals and not a new gospel not an addition to the gospel but a full complete unveiling of god with and including parts that the bride body of christ were to fulfill that the very first original age was not able to do and so they began to fall away we've taught on that many times and how that our our our mission then becomes slightly different because we are the church that will not taste death we are the last age and the bride leaves the ages at the end of chapter 3 and she goes into a rapture and brother branham said she's not seen again until revelation 19. now then chapter 4 picks up a transition of the opening of the word it moves right into the throne room scene of the sealed book and a strong angel calling for a worthy one to come john representing the bride and then from there you know chapter 6 7 8 goes on starts talking about the the seven sealed mystery chapter 10 has him coming with an open book with a messenger on the earth who who is the facilitator brother branham was not the interpreter only christ could open the seals brother branham being a prophet was a facilitator for god because god only reveals these great things through prophets and then the prophets give it to the people and that's exactly what happens uh john representing the bride is commanded to go and ask for the little book he does he's given it but said you must eat it because you're going to have to become it so we realize that that's the age that we have come into and we realize that this is the age of the catching away where the world has returned to a sodom and gomorrah condition and and we realize that the bride is going to step into another dimension she's not uh you know going beyond the milky way and going way off into the reaches of space she's simply transitioning into another dimension when the when the saints from the ages resurrect they will be very much real but they will be operating in a dimension that the world cannot see and so it's not to say that that couldn't happen because brother branham talks about how that when abraham was raised at the first part of the first resurrection that he and sarah while touring jerusalem got spotted and i don't know that he got clearly identified brother branham uh is somewhat ambiguous on that but just you know telling the narrative said abraham said oh sir we got to go we've been spotted so i don't know listen friends there's some of this that we don't know and all the teaching in the world isn't going to bring it to us what we have found in this first verse of the book of revelation there's been a number of things that i think that we can well establish and that is that this would not be the book of revelation was written for the church uh that's why jesus doesn't outline its mysteries in the gospels paul doesn't outline its mysteries in his letters we find that john brings it back from his prison imprisonment on patmos and it is a book to the church uh and it's a revelation which means an uncovering on an apocalypse it's an uncovering and what it simply is and the simplest way to say it and understand it it is that this is the continuation of jesus christ in his church not the continuation of the nail scarred man the nail scarred man fulfilled his destiny in the earth paid redemptions price at calvary that body was laid on an altar as brother branham says over and over again as a perpetual atonement his blood speaking for us but that life that was in christ that lived in that nail scarred man has been returned back to the church and it's the same jesus it's not a different jesus in fact is when paul encounters him on the road he's already in that form of the pillar of fire and accuses paul of persecuting jesus but paul never never persecuted jesus but he was persecuting the church and thus persecuting jesus because the lord jesus was now living in his church the same jesus that paul speaks of in ephesians 3 who created the whole world the same logos that john identified was god and all things were made by him and not anything was made that was made he made everything and there was nothing made that he didn't make and so now the book of revelation is the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show the servants so now it's a it's a unlocked mystery to us and we look at it in perspective it gives us context now to how that christ operated down through the ages that it was christ in his church manifesting himself in flesh and when you see that then you begin to understand who jesus was in a much broader sense you realize that jesus christ was not just the man that walked the shores of galilee jesus christ primarily is the word in whatever manifestation the word comes to in your age that's jesus to your age so when people today try to claim that jesus christ is their lord and that they are christians and yet you don't see my sins and thus and god who couldn't die in spirit form inhabits a human body that he creates from his own word both both seed and egg created in the womb of the virgin and therefore he is the word made flesh but what the book of revelation was going to bring us to understand that it would be this this was this was what paul referred to as the great mystery and the only thing paul says about it is that it's christ in you the hope of glory and so the book of revelation now is all about that mystery that we find out that as god as the logos as jesus the eternal god and that he come in his father's name his name at all has always been that and we when we find out that he lived in a single body that walked the shores of galilee and they wanted to make him a king but we realized that jesus showed them that that couldn't be because a seed that didn't die abideth alone and but if it die then it brings forth much and so when when people look simply back to a historical jesus and they and they realize that that's the fullness of the godhead bodily the reason that they're missing the baptism of the holy ghost and the full new birth is because they don't see that same jesus now living in a mini-membered body whereas that that logos that dwelt in one body now lives in many membered body and brother branham uses that very exact language that this bride globally by the token the book of revelation is all about and that's why the world is missing it they don't realize that that same historical character lives today and he's he's the same yesterday today and forever he was alive yesterday he's alive today he was alive before he lived on the earth born of a virgin he was alive before there was stardust it's the same god unfolding himself unfolding himself and that's the great mystery of the godhead so you always want to remember when you're trying to explain that to somebody that he is primarily the word he's not merely a historical figure that's what verse 1 is telling you that's what the the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants catch it things which must shortly come to pass and and and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john so he had an angel messenger a prophet in the first age the apostle paul and he bookends the ages at the end time with another prophet an angel messenger so that the so that the fullness of the word reformers could never get there the fullness of the word has to come to pass because the book of revelation is declaring and showing how that that same jesus who lived would die be buried resurrect empty paradise take the old testament saints home lay that body on an altar descend back into the earth come into his church and then synchronously live in his church through seven contiguous not only continuous they were contiguous in that they butted up against each other there was no in between space in the church where jesus wasn't active that's that's the contiguousness of the ages but they were also continuous and overlapping so that they overlapped as we've talked about the olympiad where uh uh uh uh the the relay runner takes off running and the man's coming behind him reaching forth with the baton he takes it the man behind fades off the man with it now runs forward until he gets to the next man this is why paul would say that we're you know everyone enters a race but only the ones who finish it win the race and so paul even uses the the olympics there in greece and the games that they had there uh to illustrate the the journey that the church is on and so we realize then that we are the last leg of the relay we run all the way to the body change or you could call it part two of the first resurrection because part one of the first resurrection was when christ dis ascended up with the old testament saints emptying paradise and this is why the bible talks about that that the ones who are redeemed and made part of the first resurrection and go in the rapture at the at the day and hour that we live in these are the ones upon whom the second death hath no power there's a general resurrection for judgment but we're not part of that because uh we're part of the first resurrection we're taught on this extensively uh in the in the podcast i'll go into it more with more detail but we've taught on it extensively that you only come to the new birth by a revelation of jesus christ who is the word and it's a they asked brother branham he says brother branham would speaking in the third person would say you say brother branham what is the new birth and he says it is a revelation of jesus christ personally to you to you personally and so christ is his word and so every time that god reveals by his spirit his word his personage in his word to someone and they accept that and amen that then that is their pathway that is god's provided way to the new birth god only has one provided way and that's through the blood of his son and that's why the john would say that if we walk in the light who's the light christ what's christ the word in him was life and that life not merely the historical figure that's that's necessary but it's not merely that that if we fail you could stand all day long and agree that the man who hung on calvary was god in flesh his words were true and you believe it absolutely but if you then rejected the doctrine and teachings of the apostles there would be no way to stand in the presence of god accepted you couldn't do that you couldn't come up to god and say lord i was at golgotha i saw you die i followed you i believed you i heard your teachings i accept you but this peter guy and paul and john and james i you know and jude i i don't need them i don't need them telling me i just want jesus but you would never be stand in the presence of god acceptably with that kind of an attitude neither can you do it today you have to receive god in christ in his word and thus john would say if we walk in the light the revealed word christ in the form of his word revealed if we walk in that light as he's in the light as he's revealing it then then the blood of jesus cleanses us from all sin then we have fellowship one with another why because we are the unified family of god birthed by faith in the word which is christ all right so we find then that that his form in this age of the book of revelation that his form the form of christ is the true church that when you have christ embodied in a believer by the holy ghost that's the true church that's why that in the in the early era uh in the early years the spirit of antichrist rose up trying to build a church and and called themselves the true church the periclesia and called the true church false and called themselves who were false true and god just simply came down and says all right fine if you're going to take that label then i'm going to require it of you and if you and if you don't come my provided way then i'm gonna judge you for that because even you see that principle in the gospels false teachers and lawyers and woe unto you and you know and you're full of dead men's bones and men walk over the top of you and don't realize they're walking over over tombs and here these holy men say you know are we blocking you of sin because you can't disbelieve what you don't know but because you say we see your sin remains and so we find that right here coming into the early ages that the false church rose up saying we're the church and jesus says fine that's the way you want to play that's the way we'll go and that's why he's going to judge her as a at the end time because she prostituted herself claiming to be his wife claiming to be his bride but prostituted the word of god and adulterated the word of god and went whoring with the sins of the world but in every age god maintained a true bride christ walking in the midst of the seven lamp stands and so we're going to pause there today uh from this at this point in the podcast we will go deeply into the mystery of the godhead we don't need to do that here uh we've covered the godhead extensively here preaching brother jason to mars has covered it very extensively we don't need to cover that portion of it i would like to get to verse two uh so hopefully verse 2 will be able to begin with on next sunday i hope that covers verse 1 thoroughly uh the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto its servant john so it's going to be the revelation of christ that he gives to the church of his movements through 2000 years seven contiguous church ages and we're at the last one we're at the capping we're at the wrapping up we've already had the seventh star in the right hand of god it's all the stars have been deployed they've all been used they've all been recalled and now the bride is eating the book because you are what you eat and so we're becoming because what we're eating is christ the word not a man we're not feeding on a man we're feeding on the body word of the son of man so god bless you today let's let's pray father we thank you for our sunday school class today and i pray that you will give understanding and open the eyes lord and not just in a theological way but i i might my goal is that the church can see their part in all of this this is why brother branham would call it a great drama and lord i feel privileged to be a part of it today may you bless the teaching of your word in jesus name amen god bless you saints brother sister you can sit right there the church this regular service will begin in five or ten minutes or so or you can take a break it's like a little intermission it's up to you god bless you amen
