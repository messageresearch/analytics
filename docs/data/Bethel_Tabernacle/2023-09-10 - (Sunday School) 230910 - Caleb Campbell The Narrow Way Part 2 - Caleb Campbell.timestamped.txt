[0:02] presence here Lord
[0:03] father God many times Lord as a speaker
[0:06] father we can get in our own way father
[0:08] Lord but I pray that the same amount of
[0:11] inspiration Lord and anointing that you
[0:13] laid on my heart for this Lord would
[0:15] Lord come off of the page and into the
[0:18] hearts of your people here this morning
[0:21] Lord we love you and again and we just
[0:23] invite your presence Lord the most
[0:24] important thing here father in the name
[0:27] of Jesus Christ amen
[0:29] amen Saints let's open and open to our
[0:31] Bibles here in the Book of Matthew this
[0:34] is going to be a part two from last week
[0:37] so uh
[0:38] Matthew the seventh chapter
[0:41] Matthew 7 we're going to read just two
[0:43] two verses here
[0:45] Matthew 7
[0:47] 13 through 14.
[0:51] amen
[0:53] it says enter ye at the Straight Gate
[0:55] for wide as the gate and Broad is the
[0:57] way that leadeth to destruction and many
[0:59] there be which go in there at because
[1:02] straight is the gate and narrow is the
[1:04] way which leadeth unto life and few
[1:07] there be that find it now if we turn
[1:10] over into the Book of Numbers way back
[1:12] numbers 14
[1:14] and 41 we're going to read a few verses
[1:16] there to tie in to our part 2 here
[1:20] numbers 14 and verse 41 says as Moses
[1:24] said wherefore now do ye transgress the
[1:26] Commandment of the Lord but it shall not
[1:29] Prosper go not up for the Lord is not
[1:32] among you
[1:33] that ye be not smitten before your
[1:35] enemies for the amalekites and the
[1:37] Canaanites are there before you and ye
[1:39] shall sword because ye are turned away
[1:42] from the Lord therefore the Lord will
[1:44] not be with you but they presumed to go
[1:47] up under the hilltop nevertheless the
[1:49] Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and
[1:51] Moses departed not out of the camp then
[1:53] the amalekites came down and the
[1:55] Canaanites which dwell in the hill and
[1:57] smote them and discomforted them even
[1:59] unto horma
[2:01] amen you can be seated this morning as
[2:02] the Lord
[2:03] blesses the reading of his word the
[2:06] subject was the narrow way with a
[2:09] subtitle today we're going to subtitle
[2:11] emphasizing the message and I have a lot
[2:14] a lot of material again this morning but
[2:15] I don't have a lot of time to recap last
[2:17] week's but we'll make some references as
[2:19] we go along there in numbers it talks
[2:22] about how the people came to Moses
[2:25] and Moses gave them this direction to go
[2:28] not up for the for your for the Lord is
[2:30] not going to be among you and you're
[2:32] going to be Smitten by your enemies but
[2:34] even though they add the word of the
[2:36] Lord and they had this message from
[2:38] their Prophet at the time they presumed
[2:40] to go up under the hilltop anyway and
[2:43] brother random picks that up in that
[2:45] sermon presuming he preaches a few times
[2:47] and that word presume is to be to
[2:49] supposed to be without proof supposed to
[2:52] be true without proof to take for
[2:53] granted Webster says it means to venture
[2:56] without actual Authority or to take it
[2:58] for granted to do something before you
[3:00] were authorized to do it and without the
[3:01] actual authority to do it the Israelites
[3:04] were here went off to a place where
[3:05] Moses said the Lord wouldn't be and he
[3:07] warned them don't go up there
[3:09] but they did it anyway and they left the
[3:11] prophet and the Ark there they left the
[3:13] word and the only thing that it was the
[3:14] only thing that protected him the whole
[3:16] their whole journey and they left it
[3:18] somewhere and went on their own way and
[3:21] we touched on this last week but you
[3:22] know that's a big portion of the modern
[3:24] gospel today they pursue because they
[3:26] they take a part of what the Bible says
[3:28] but they're venturing out on the on
[3:30] their own for the rest of it they think
[3:32] they're on the right path but it's
[3:33] actually a path to destruction
[3:35] he says and he doesn't want to go out on
[3:37] that you know the quote we read last
[3:39] week got Christ as the mystery of God
[3:41] revealed God doesn't want anybody to go
[3:43] out on that path he he says that quote
[3:46] literally says that the Gates of Hell
[3:47] have to spread open to receive them
[3:50] brother Branham says in presuming 1962
[3:52] he says you hear so much today I say
[3:53] again about being a good god there was a
[3:56] teenage boy I said not long ago you know
[3:57] the Lord just loves me so well he lets
[3:59] me do anything my friends he is a good
[4:02] god and I'll admit that but he is a God
[4:04] of Justice he is a God that requires
[4:06] Justice how can that be just and how can
[4:08] he be just and disobey his own laws how
[4:11] can he defile his own holy laws if he is
[4:13] just he has to stick by what he said if
[4:15] he will require this of you and you
[4:17] don't come to that point if he isn't
[4:19] just then why didn't he let Eve get by
[4:21] with that one little misconstrue of the
[4:23] word and one of the one of the
[4:25] misconstrues of that when they're up on
[4:27] that Hilltop you know he's not trying to
[4:29] be uh you know uh you know trying to put
[4:32] his put his fist on you and say don't do
[4:34] this he says no I'm warning you I can't
[4:36] go into this place with you don't go
[4:39] don't go on your own way you know you
[4:43] know God isn't isn't a mean God he's a
[4:46] loving God he wants to do everything for
[4:48] you he wants to give you a word he wants
[4:51] to give you Revelation but sometimes we
[4:53] go and we presume to go on our own way
[4:55] without our own in our own thinking but
[4:58] there's only one way we can go John 3 5
[5:00] says verily verily I say unto you except
[5:03] a man be born of water and of the spirit
[5:04] he cannot enter into the kingdom of God
[5:07] that another quote there in paragraph
[5:10] 165 of presuming says and that's what's
[5:12] the matter of today you're trying to
[5:14] preach the gospel with soft gloves on
[5:16] and presuming it's all right what the
[5:17] church needs today is to be shut down
[5:19] come back to the gospel you're presuming
[5:22] it's all right I'm Pentecostal I'm this
[5:24] that or the other that's all right it's
[5:26] not all right it's not according to the
[5:28] word you've got to come to the word such
[5:30] a good God they don't presume that he is
[5:32] a God of Justice moving further into
[5:34] what brother Branham says here moving
[5:36] past just denominations because I
[5:38] believe many of us here probably have
[5:39] never been to a denominational Church
[5:41] you know they didn't we didn't come out
[5:43] of denominations we we've grown up but
[5:45] that same exact construct can take place
[5:48] in a message church we can't presume
[5:51] that it's all right to live any old way
[5:52] and then come to church or to live a
[5:54] watered-down version of the Gospel is
[5:57] our life matching up with the word
[6:00] brother random says if it's not all
[6:02] right it's not according to the word
[6:03] you've got to come to the word the
[6:05] prophet says brother Jason preached a
[6:07] sermon a few weeks ago that marveling
[6:09] into mystery and he talked about the
[6:11] importance of emphasizing God's word
[6:13] through his prophet in our lives and Ma
[6:15] what a sermon
[6:16] um if you didn't if you didn't listen
[6:17] definitely go listen just to give some
[6:19] reference from Material there
[6:21] from part one the Lord spoke to a man
[6:24] some thousand years ago his name was
[6:25] Noah he sent him a message build a boat
[6:27] preach it live it and construct it just
[6:30] the way I tell you to do it with these
[6:32] instructions with these material with a
[6:34] specific type of wood and we've read
[6:36] that Sunday School Story you know our
[6:38] whole lives you know God sent a flood
[6:40] but the only thing that people seem to
[6:42] remember about that story is that there
[6:44] was a rainbow after it happened and even
[6:46] that beautiful representation of God's
[6:48] promise to us is now misrepresented in a
[6:51] culture of sinful living you know they
[6:53] wave this rainbow they stole that from a
[6:55] holy God and just like Satan does they
[6:57] perverted it the Lord spoke to a prophet
[7:00] in our day he gave him the materials to
[7:03] get us out of our our way of thinking
[7:05] and our way of life so that we could get
[7:08] home and I believe that that message
[7:09] that he gave is what we should eat and
[7:11] breathe
[7:13] I believe with all my heart we ought to
[7:15] get back to emphasizing the importance
[7:18] of this precious message listening to it
[7:20] studying it reading it you know I wasn't
[7:22] sure on how to go with this but I was
[7:23] just so inspired to go down this simple
[7:25] path studying the message should be such
[7:27] a priority in our lives those that have
[7:30] gone before us you know they lived and
[7:32] they they breathed this message my
[7:34] grandparents you know they were around
[7:35] before we had instant access to the
[7:38] messages you know at the click of a
[7:39] finger they were there when they were
[7:41] still transcribing the books and you
[7:43] know they would get a month's worth of
[7:44] books and you know my goodness they
[7:46] would dive into those things this was
[7:48] God's word this is this is fresh to us
[7:50] it was God's message you know and
[7:52] brother Branham was the one that God
[7:54] sent to give it the vessel the voice of
[7:56] which he chose to use Matthew 10 40 says
[7:59] he that receiveth you receiveth me he
[8:01] that receiveth me receiveth him that
[8:03] sent me he that receiveth a prophet in
[8:05] the name of a prophet shall receive a
[8:06] prophet's reward and he that receiveth a
[8:08] righteous man in the name of a righteous
[8:10] man shall receive a righteous man's
[8:12] reward you know young people middle-aged
[8:15] people old people I hope this can stir
[8:17] our hearts this morning the message
[8:18] studying this message is is way better
[8:21] than than binge watching TV shows it's
[8:24] way better than video games it's way
[8:26] better than those things I promise you
[8:27] you get to witness the supernatural in
[8:31] our in our day do you have those slides
[8:32] brother if you could bring those slides
[8:33] up the first the first one you go read
[8:36] in Life Magazine I had a friend of mine
[8:38] uh give give me an actual copy of this
[8:41] and it's a it's a printed copy in 1963 I
[8:44] know we're probably all familiar with it
[8:46] but Dr James McDonald's a meteorologist
[8:48] at The Institute of the atmospheric
[8:50] physics in Tucson did trigonomic
[8:52] calculations and discovered that the
[8:54] cloud was 60 or 26 miles high and 30
[8:57] miles across and it was titled A Kai
[9:00] cloud ring of mystery these kind of
[9:02] things this is God appearing to his
[9:04] bride these kinds of things are exciting
[9:05] the next slide you know what about the
[9:08] time that Jesus in the form of a pillar
[9:10] of fire comes and allows a camera to
[9:12] take a photo of them and with the
[9:14] prophet at the Houston Coliseum I don't
[9:16] know if you have that next slide brother
[9:16] that photo still sits in the Library of
[9:19] Congress my parents went there and
[9:21] actually saw it for themselves and I
[9:23] love that picture because it hangs in my
[9:25] house not because it's just a picture of
[9:27] the Prophet it's a picture of the Lord
[9:29] Jesus himself pictured with the prophet
[9:31] that's why it's so important and it's
[9:33] documented scientific proof that it's
[9:35] unexplainable something Supernatural but
[9:38] we can explain it thank the Lord and it
[9:41] was Jesus himself
[9:43] what about the time that you know
[9:44] brother Branham was up there in Sabino
[9:46] Canyon and the sword appeared into his
[9:48] hands you know just to dramatize here
[9:50] for a minute brother Benham does it the
[9:51] best he says and I had my hands out and
[9:54] all at once there in the seventh seal
[9:55] something hit my hand I don't know I
[9:57] can't say it did I go to sleep I don't
[9:59] know did I go into a trance I don't know
[10:01] was it a Division I can't tell you only
[10:03] thing I can say is just the same thing
[10:05] like them Angels was it struck my hand
[10:08] and looked and it was a sword it had a
[10:10] pearl handle real pretty and had a guard
[10:12] over it with gold the blade looked like
[10:15] something like a chrome or like silver
[10:16] it was real shiny it was so feather edge
[10:18] sharp oh my I thought isn't that the
[10:21] prettiest thing just fit my hand I
[10:22] thought that's awful pretty I said hey
[10:24] I'm always afraid of them things a sword
[10:25] I thought well what will I do with it
[10:27] and just then a voice shook down through
[10:29] there rocked across the Rocks it's the
[10:32] sword of the king and then I came out of
[10:35] it the sword of the king now if I said a
[10:37] sword of the king but it said the sword
[10:39] of the king now there is only one the
[10:42] king he says and that that's God and he
[10:44] has the sword and his sword that's what
[10:46] I've lived by so help me God standing
[10:49] over there his holy desk with this holy
[10:50] word laying here it's the word amen what
[10:53] we're doing is we're what a day we're
[10:55] living in what a great thing oh the
[10:57] mystery and the secret the handle was
[10:59] made of pearl the guard was gold the it
[11:02] was razor sharp glistening silver a
[11:05] voice that shook down oh my Saints I
[11:07] don't know about you but this kind of
[11:08] stuff gets me excited it gets me
[11:10] thinking about man the lord loves us so
[11:12] much that he's doing these things in our
[11:14] lives and he's he's showing it and he's
[11:16] allowing these things to happen in our
[11:18] lives and this is the god that we read
[11:20] about in the Bible he's moving in our
[11:23] day
[11:24] you know what about the the light if we
[11:26] have that third picture the light I sent
[11:28] this uh there's a testimony of this
[11:30] there's a light that that comes across
[11:32] after brother Brandon preaches the
[11:34] church ages that draws the each of the
[11:36] moon phases there at the back of the the
[11:38] the Tabernacle there you know brother
[11:40] brother branham's deacon at the time
[11:42] told a story to his son it was a
[11:43] first-hand account this is like the
[11:45] Bible times when Daniel in the Book of
[11:47] Daniel when the hand appeared and
[11:49] supernaturally wrote on the wall many
[11:51] many tarkle a Parson and that was a hand
[11:54] of warning at the time but this was a
[11:56] hand of vindication confirming to the
[11:58] people that this is my word
[12:00] you know that picture hangs you know in
[12:02] many churches
[12:04] um you know some of these things these
[12:06] are just these are just the highlights
[12:08] these are just these are just Parts this
[12:09] is just a part of it and I don't want us
[12:12] to ever fall into the state and I know
[12:13] that we're we're all guilty of this to
[12:15] fall into a state where this is common
[12:17] stuff this is Supernatural this is God
[12:19] sent this is powerful and it's more than
[12:22] just some awesome historical events or
[12:24] Supernatural events laid within it is
[12:27] depths of a revelation that God wants to
[12:30] give to us at every time in our lives we
[12:32] have a question about it we have we have
[12:34] uh we have questions in our hearts we we
[12:36] pray for things and and then something
[12:38] is laid upon someone's heart to maybe
[12:40] Minister that thing and then he uses a a
[12:42] quote from the prophet at this time to
[12:45] minister this and then that answers
[12:47] something in your heart everything that
[12:49] God ever has is laid within his word and
[12:51] everything that he has for you is
[12:53] already there for you somewhere it's
[12:55] just the right time in the right place
[12:57] and the right season that it has to come
[13:00] Jesus says there in Matthew 13 verse 11
[13:03] he answers the son of them because it is
[13:05] given unto you to know the mysteries of
[13:07] the kingdom of heaven but to them it is
[13:09] not given but blessed are your eyes for
[13:12] they see in your ears for they hear for
[13:15] verily I say unto you many prophets and
[13:17] righteous men have desired to see those
[13:19] things which you see and have not seen
[13:21] them and to hear those things which you
[13:22] hear and have not heard them many will
[13:25] see and not understand or hear and not
[13:28] grasp what's laid within the word but
[13:30] thanks be to God we are a people that do
[13:33] and many people desired to see the
[13:37] things that we've seen and I'm just so
[13:40] thankful for it I believe that any
[13:42] Divine message that the Lord wants to
[13:43] give to me I believe it's important and
[13:45] it's something that I want to hear amen
[13:48] now if we're honest with ourselves we
[13:51] can just transition here for a second if
[13:52] we're honest with ourselves how many of
[13:54] us have listened to more than one
[13:56] message this week
[13:58] and going even further than that if we
[14:00] did listen to a message was it just on
[14:01] in the background or was it something
[14:03] that you listen to that you studied that
[14:06] you gave your heart to now this is
[14:08] convicting this is convicting to me too
[14:09] what distracts you what takes your time
[14:12] lay it down Saints it's not worth it we
[14:15] have to the scripture says we have to
[14:17] lay down those weights we have to stop
[14:18] making excuses you know I can be the
[14:20] most guilty of the bunch but I believe
[14:22] we ought to be honest with ourselves and
[14:24] really get back to the basics of Walking
[14:26] with God you know brother Branham is one
[14:28] of the best preachers you'll ever listen
[14:29] to if you go through one of his messages
[14:31] a majority of his messages are titles
[14:33] from scriptures to the word and then he
[14:36] expounds and he brings those scriptures
[14:38] to life even in just preparing for this
[14:40] Sunday school I was going through two or
[14:41] three sermons there mostly in 1963
[14:45] and he references at least a dozen
[14:47] scriptures in each sermon and when he
[14:49] references it I open up my Bible or my
[14:52] Bible app and I go and I read that
[14:53] scripture and I make a study out of it
[14:55] sometimes then by reading those
[14:57] scriptures then it inspires me to read
[14:59] the rest of the chapter and then by
[15:01] reading the rest of the chapter the
[15:02] Bible turns into a study and that study
[15:04] turns into some Revelation that the Lord
[15:05] has been wanting to give to me and so
[15:07] listening to One message becomes an
[15:09] entire Bible study so that's that's the
[15:12] way God wants to do it in our lives he
[15:14] wants us to read the word he wants to
[15:16] make a study he wants to give you
[15:17] Revelation but he wants us to make an
[15:19] effort to do it amen
[15:24] he loves speaking to us through his word
[15:26] he loves to do that but there are so
[15:30] many distractions that can take take our
[15:32] mind away from just the basics of of
[15:34] Bible study you know Mike I was just
[15:37] fellowship with my uh my cousin the
[15:39] other day and we were just talking about
[15:40] it and you know there the book of Acts
[15:44] when they had to you know sit there for
[15:46] 10 days and wait imagine the
[15:48] distractions now we can't even sit for
[15:50] 10 hours and if that was if 10 hours of
[15:52] waiting you know if we were able to do
[15:54] that in today's world it would be an
[15:56] absolute miracle and it's true it's
[15:57] funny but it's so true it's you know
[15:59] there's so many things that lay there
[16:01] but this message is God's material
[16:05] touching back on last week we talked
[16:07] about the Rich Young Ruler you know
[16:10] presumed the rest of his life that if he
[16:12] kept on living the same way that he had
[16:14] been living that it would probably be
[16:15] okay but scripture says that he ended up
[16:17] in hell
[16:19] we can't let a modern Social Gospel
[16:21] deceiving us into thinking that the gate
[16:24] is now any less narrow than it was when
[16:27] Jesus preached that Sermon on the Mount
[16:28] he's the same yesterday today and
[16:31] forever in Noah's time brother Brenham
[16:33] says in 1962 presuming he says in Noah's
[16:36] time they presumed if it came uh if it
[16:39] came up come a flood like Noah said it
[16:40] would do well the only thing they'd do
[16:41] is jump in their own boat but there was
[16:43] only one boat that was God constructed
[16:46] we can't jump in our own boats this
[16:48] morning even in our lives you know we
[16:50] take something God says and maybe we
[16:52] compromise it with it not even realizing
[16:54] sometimes we do we let reasoning step in
[16:56] and say well that's not exactly like the
[16:59] world and and you know and what I dress
[17:01] or in in the decisions I make or what we
[17:03] allow to enter our homes or in our in
[17:05] our team in our entertainment excuse me
[17:08] and we compromise a reason and say that
[17:10] it's you know it's really not that bad
[17:12] but if you're not careful you become
[17:14] exactly like those Israelites standing
[17:16] up there and says well you know your
[17:18] word says this but you know we're living
[17:20] we're living in this modern time now so
[17:22] I think it's probably okay to go and do
[17:24] this well that's not what the word says
[17:26] that's not that's not what the Bible
[17:28] says the Bible says that he is the same
[17:31] yesterday today and forever and he has a
[17:33] way and he doesn't want anybody to go a
[17:35] different way he has that it's it's a
[17:37] narrow way but it's the way of Jesus
[17:39] Jesus is the way he is the truth he is
[17:42] the life
[17:45] he goes on to say in paragraph 212 of
[17:47] that same sermon he says but what would
[17:50] they do they don't try to have wisdom of
[17:51] their own they can't figure it out
[17:52] you're not supposed to figure it out
[17:55] you're just supposed to believe it say
[17:57] when he's referring to Noah he says said
[18:00] take shitam wood it's just as light like
[18:02] a sponge but now notice after he got all
[18:04] the of wood destroyed destructed
[18:07] constructed rather he said go and take
[18:08] pitch and soak it up how did they get
[18:11] pitch in them days they took another
[18:12] kind of tree pine tree they beat it
[18:14] until the pitch run out of it what's it
[18:17] a type of the Timber God has got today
[18:20] empty out all your old fanatic stuff
[18:22] empty out all your organizations get
[18:24] real light and just lay before God
[18:28] then he beat one of us he was wounded
[18:31] for our transgressions bruised for our
[18:32] iniquities he was beaten wounded bruised
[18:34] recovery that his Spirit might pour upon
[18:37] you when you have nothing
[18:39] the next the next paragraph he says and
[18:41] then that boat the ark when he set up
[18:43] there even a nail couldn't be driven
[18:44] into it that's the reason the big logs
[18:47] hitting against it wouldn't bust a hole
[18:48] in it why Oak Pine or nothing else would
[18:51] not hold like that see it was already
[18:53] soaked and the pitch was already inside
[18:55] and out that's right that's the way a
[18:58] Christian is he empties himself
[19:00] I don't want to know what anybody I want
[19:02] to know what the Lord I want to know you
[19:05] I want you your life
[19:08] then God just soak up in Christ here's a
[19:12] real simple yet a profound lesson from
[19:14] the the prophet just soak up in Christ
[19:17] how do we how do we soak up in Christ
[19:19] it's not you know just manufacturing
[19:21] something it's not trying to force
[19:22] yourself into this life it's it's laying
[19:26] before the the lord it's it comes with
[19:28] these instructions verse uh Ephesians 4
[19:30] from the word says but ye have not so
[19:33] learned Christ if so be that ye have
[19:36] heard him and have been taught by him as
[19:37] the truth is in Jesus that ye put off
[19:41] concerning the former conversation of
[19:43] the old man which is corrupt according
[19:45] to the deceitful lust and be renewed in
[19:49] the spirit of your mind that ye put on
[19:51] the new man which after God is created
[19:54] in righteousness and true Holiness so
[19:57] you put on a new man you put on a new a
[20:00] complete new person and that is the
[20:03] person the Bible says that God creates
[20:05] in righteousness and in true Holiness so
[20:07] there there's a way to have true
[20:09] Holiness there's a way to have
[20:10] righteousness in this life and it's
[20:12] through God it's through his spirit that
[20:14] be you put it on you put it on a new man
[20:16] what is Paul saying there how do you how
[20:18] do you put on your new man you learn the
[20:20] things of the Bible some basic Bible
[20:23] instructions here Ephesians 5 1 be
[20:25] therefore followers of God as dear dear
[20:28] children and walk in love as Christ hath
[20:31] loved you and hath given himself for us
[20:33] as an offering for us as a sacrifice to
[20:36] God for a sweet smelling savior be their
[20:40] followers of God learn the word learn
[20:42] the message soak it up soak up Christ
[20:45] every time you can any any opportunity
[20:49] you get to to even listen to a few
[20:51] minutes and and dive into the word and
[20:53] dive into what God has said in our day
[20:55] through the message of the hour those
[20:57] kind of things are what soak up Christ
[20:59] in US
[21:02] and then uh Ephesians 5 going on it says
[21:05] about fornication and uncleanness or
[21:07] covetousness let it not be once named
[21:09] among you as become a Saints neither
[21:11] filthiness nor foolish talking nor
[21:13] jesting which are not convenient but
[21:15] rather giving of thanks for this she
[21:17] know that no whoremonger nor unclean
[21:19] person nor covetousness man who isn't a
[21:22] dilator hath any inheritance into the
[21:25] kingdom of Christ and of God and let no
[21:27] man deceive you with vain words for
[21:29] because of these things cometh the wrath
[21:31] of God upon the children of disobedience
[21:34] Galatians 5 16 says this I say then walk
[21:38] in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill
[21:40] the lusts of the flesh for the flesh
[21:43] lusteth against the spirit and the
[21:45] spirit against the flesh but these are
[21:47] contrary to one one to the other so that
[21:50] ye cannot do the things that you would
[21:52] but if ye be led by the spirit ye are
[21:55] not under the law so you can't even do
[21:58] the things that you want to do without
[22:00] the spirit of God so you need to have
[22:02] the spirit amen now the works of the
[22:04] flesh are manifest which are these
[22:05] things adultery fornication uncleanness
[22:08] lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft
[22:10] hatred variance emulations wrath Strife
[22:14] seditions heresies envings murders
[22:16] drunkenness revelings and such like all
[22:18] of those things those are just your
[22:20] former life if you're not sure if what
[22:23] your former life was is in there
[22:25] uncleanness anything unclean that's your
[22:27] former life and it says uncleanness in
[22:29] there of which I tell you before as I
[22:32] have told you in times past that they
[22:34] which do such things shall not inherit
[22:36] the kingdom of God but
[22:39] the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[22:41] peace long-suffering gentleness goodness
[22:44] Faith meekness Temperance and against
[22:47] such there is no law and they that are
[22:50] christs have crucified the flesh with
[22:54] the affections and the lusts it says and
[22:56] if we live in the spirit let us also
[22:59] walk in the spirit
[23:02] some of these some of these closing
[23:04] argument quotes here from
[23:06] a couple of messages straight As the
[23:08] gate 1959
[23:10] paragraph 102 says didn't Jesus say that
[23:13] the spirit speaks expressingly in the
[23:16] last days that they would be heady
[23:17] high-minded lovers of pleasure more than
[23:19] lovers of God truce Breakers incontinent
[23:22] Fierce and despisers of those that are
[23:24] good having a form of godliness now
[23:26] there's so many classifications laid
[23:28] within that that those verses there the
[23:31] lovers of lovers of pleasure more than
[23:33] lovers of God lovers of pleasure just
[23:35] means that you love entertainment more
[23:37] than you love spending time with the
[23:38] Lord you enjoy you know you enjoy
[23:41] watching movies you enjoy playing video
[23:42] games you enjoy these things more than
[23:44] you enjoy the things of God truce
[23:46] Breakers incontinent Fierce despisers of
[23:49] those that are good and having a form of
[23:51] godliness remember but denying the power
[23:53] of God having a form of godliness going
[23:55] to church doing these things but then
[23:58] not having the spirit of God put on that
[24:00] new man inside of you
[24:03] speak with tongues he says you can shout
[24:05] you can speak with tongues faith will
[24:06] cast out devil see but that ain't what
[24:08] we're talking about then you would say
[24:10] to me brother Branham what is the mark
[24:12] of a Christian who will be saved will
[24:15] you brother Branham I'm trusting that to
[24:17] God I don't know I'm believing that I am
[24:19] listen to this but I'm comparing my life
[24:23] daily with the word
[24:25] if it don't live up to this word then
[24:28] there's something wrong I've got to go
[24:30] back and get right
[24:33] yeah that is just some basic
[24:34] instructions right there I am comparing
[24:37] my life not weekly not monthly daily
[24:40] with what the word and if something
[24:43] doesn't live up to the word then let's
[24:45] go back and let's get it right find out
[24:47] what it is find out where it is you know
[24:50] and even even when you're born again of
[24:52] the spirit of God there's still things
[24:53] that line up without the word so that's
[24:55] why we you know we have a walk with
[24:58] Christ and he he puts up puts things on
[25:00] our hearts and he convicts us and says
[25:02] don't do this or maybe go this way or
[25:04] there's things that you can do there's
[25:06] growth there's every stage you are at in
[25:09] your Christian walk there's there's
[25:10] growth unless you're walking with God
[25:12] like Enoch there is growth for you to
[25:14] have in your life and if there's
[25:16] something in your life that doesn't seem
[25:18] to be matching up exactly if there's
[25:20] ever a question in your heart or in your
[25:22] mind even a just a slight question go
[25:25] compare it with the word and if it even
[25:27] just slightly sits on the edge Give It
[25:30] Up
[25:31] give it to the Lord I've got to go back
[25:33] and got to get it right there's nothing
[25:35] more important than that life in Christ
[25:37] are you comparing your life daily with
[25:40] the word
[25:41] he says this in the next paragraph which
[25:44] is night uh paragraph 130 this is The
[25:46] Showdown this is the time when God is a
[25:49] doing things this is when the Messiah is
[25:52] on Earth this is when the power of God
[25:54] is moving in his people they call them
[25:56] holy rulers crazy insane such as that
[25:59] but the hour is here there is sure going
[26:02] to be some great disappointments at the
[26:04] Judgment now when we opened up our text
[26:07] last week that you know in Matthew 7 he
[26:10] says they're going to come in that time
[26:11] and say did not I prophesy in your name
[26:13] did not I did not I cast out devils in
[26:16] your name but he says depart from me you
[26:18] workers of iniquity because in their
[26:19] hearts they didn't ever had a true
[26:21] relationship with God they wanted to do
[26:23] the works of God but they didn't have a
[26:25] true relationship with God
[26:27] The Bootlegger oh he knows where he's
[26:29] going to be at judgment so does The Beer
[26:31] Hound and know he's going to be so does
[26:33] the prostitute know where she'll stand
[26:34] so does the Gambler know where he'll
[26:35] stand so does the drunkard know where
[26:37] he'll stand he'll not be disappointed so
[26:39] the unbelievers know where they're going
[26:40] to be it's the make-believers so but
[26:43] when
[26:44] paragraph 133 but where the disappointed
[26:47] is going to be is those who thought they
[26:49] were right those were the disappointment
[26:51] when they got up there and said sure we
[26:52] cast out Devils we're preachers we
[26:54] belong to certain churches we we've done
[26:56] great Miracles we preach why I've been a
[26:58] steward in the church I've been a I've
[27:00] been a bishop I've been this he'll say
[27:02] depart from me you workers of iniquity I
[27:04] never knew you there you are that's the
[27:06] discipline he said the children of their
[27:08] children will come in
[27:10] set down in the kingdom and said we've
[27:12] got a right to be here and they'll be
[27:14] cast into outer Darkness where they'll
[27:15] be weeping and wailing and gnashing of
[27:18] teeth straight is the gate and narrow is
[27:20] the way that leadeth to life and few
[27:22] will be that find it
[27:24] here's just one more quote here he says
[27:26] to you my dear people this morning
[27:29] listen to this I've never made this up
[27:31] I'm responsible for telling it that's
[27:33] all I'm responsible for if I never
[27:35] preach another sermon in my life this is
[27:38] the truth there's just going to be a few
[27:40] people saved now just remember that just
[27:43] a very few so you he he makes a
[27:45] statement there and then there's a
[27:47] period and then you read that and you're
[27:49] like
[27:49] man there's just a few he says but you
[27:52] be one of them
[27:53] amen so it doesn't matter where your
[27:55] brother or your sister you be one of
[27:57] them you put on the mind of Christ you
[28:00] put on that new man you walk with God
[28:02] you start listening to the messages
[28:04] don't worry about what your friend or
[28:06] your brother you do it you put on these
[28:09] things amen
[28:10] who are they brother Benham I don't know
[28:12] nobody else knows but we work out our
[28:15] salvation with fear and trembling
[28:17] Philippians 2 says that work out your
[28:19] salvation with fear and trembling
[28:22] he says but you be lined up with God if
[28:25] your heart doesn't beat just right with
[28:26] that Bible then there's something wrong
[28:28] there's something wrong no matter what
[28:30] the church says you go you can't go in
[28:32] by that you go in by what God says this
[28:35] is the book you'll be judged for from
[28:37] the Bible stay right with it if your
[28:40] hearts don't be just right with the
[28:43] Bible then there's something wrong this
[28:45] is the book he says if I don't ever
[28:47] preach another sermon there'll just be a
[28:50] few but you be that for you
[28:53] amen let's just stand
[28:56] and just
[28:58] closing he says from that other quote he
[29:01] says let's compare our life daily with
[29:03] the word and if we don't lived up to it
[29:06] then I've got to go back and I've got to
[29:08] get it right let's have that some
[29:10] instructions this morning

[29:22] Lord uh just a correction father it was
[29:25] a correction for me father but I pray
[29:27] that it would just be life to us Lord
