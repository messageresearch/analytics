wonderful day laid out and looking forward to all of it had a nice time in sunday school glad to see a nice crowd out for that and after today we've got a fellowship on the grounds afterward uh you

access to prepare food inside the fellowship hall we the team worked wonderful and uh spectacularly till way late and uh there were several people involved i know that brother matt and sister rachel i

fellowship and chairs and lights and bonfire and amen looking forward to it amen praise the lord uh we're going to take a couple of prayer requests that i had sent to me um and as we read our scripture happy to have uh brother law and sister heather with us here amen from tucson god bless you um you're very familiar oh yeah okay never mind oh yeah okay i see you he's standing beside all right praise the lord and every other different one of you god bless you we're happy to have you in the house of god today me praying for uh brother jason damar's sister amy and the kids i don't see the family so i'm sure he took them with him to preach in saint augustine today amen i want to take these requests one from sister jean this is apparently i have an uh an aunt who has a sister so it's my aunt's sister her name is francis she's in the hospital with three infections mine the doctors don't know what they are they haven't been able to identify them so my aunt twala has asked that we please pray for that need brother kenny brother anita sister anita and brother ken got back yesterday but brother kenny you know that mask thing causes him a lot of sinus issues uh ever since they did that surgery it causes him to be super susceptible to that when he breathes in and out of that mask and so he's suffering today under that i told him and i said hey if you feel like it later and you feel up to it come on man we'll have an outdoor you'll be in the breeze you want to worry about infecting anybody amen we won't even make him wear a mask praise the lord sure would love to see him again like to hear about their trip amen happy to have brother get him back in one piece he was away at a church camp uh school school slash camp that they have every year so we're happy to have him back all in one piece i see he's still as one big peace as he used to be praise the lord all right we're going to go to the lord in prayer and let's open our bibles we'll combine our prayer over the scripture with our reading let's go to hebrews chapter four in hebrews chapter four we're just going to catch maybe two verses here let's catch verse 9 and 10. didn't get that to you again did i forgot to get my scripture sorry josh i usually inspect what i expect and i failed to do either so my apologies uh hebrews 13 9 and 10. did i yeah um sorry i said hebrews 4 didn't i well i was wrong hebrews 13. thank you brother michael hebrews 13. amen hebrews 4 be a good one amen a lot of a lot of paul teaching us on the everlasting rest that we have in christ and so but let's catch hebrews 13 this morning i want to continue on my subject from last time this will be no place at the altar part two and i have a subtitle that you'll see momentarily on the powerpoint once we have that up and i'll need you to run that for me brother josh i didn't load it into the presenter up here verse 9 be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle father we thank you for your word today and i just settle my heart and my mind in now lord to take take this this solemn obligation lord to stand here father and not take my own thinking but just as you have delivered it to me i am determined to do that lord because i know that i really can't help anybody but i know you can help everybody so it's you lord that we're calling you we are calling jesus on the scene to take his own word and break it to the people may it be a revelation in our hearts lord may it may it may it strike that place deep down in the heart that it has uh lord that it's not just uh lord to affect the people but to effect change in their lives every day that we live lord we must come more and more into your divine image that's why we're here so help us today to check up as we look at these things that come to us from thy apostles through the scriptures and things our prophet has taught us we're humbling ourselves now and preparing our hearts and minds to receive everything that you have for us today i pray a special prayer lord for my aunt's sister who has asked to be remembered in the hospital with three infections lord our sister gene turns in this request to the whole family here and we're joining with her lord we're joining our faith lord with her faith and brother branham said you'll join your faith to our faith and then push that promise right through to completion so we commit it to you lord may the woman be well i don't remember ever knowing her but lord you know her and i'm praying for your mercy today we're asking for your touch on brother ken lord and that's terrible sinus infection lord that we we we know how that devil works using to get in on that but father we're just condemning it in the name of jesus christ and i ask for you to recover our brother rapidly father that we might lay eyes on him again lord among the saints father we thank you for all of your tremendous blessings that you have poured out upon us and master in this day where we've gathered all together again we're asking for thy great mercy now to overshadow us lord keep us safe this of course will still amid a pandemic and we want to have our trust and faith completely in you we're taking steps that we feel are prudent and that are in compliance with lord of at least the recommendations of science but lord we're looking so so much further than science we're looking to you lord though we're not looking to the tree of knowledge we're looking to that which passeth knowledge lord all the fullness of god that it dwell in you that was paul's great desire that all the fullness of god which passes knowledge might dwell in you grant it to us lord today bless our visitors bless those who are not able to be here who perhaps are still streaming brother jason ministering away in saint augustine this morning may you bless him and the audience there abundantly we commit ourselves into your hands for service in jesus name amen god bless you as you are seated um so i guess i could run from this yeah the powerpoint from this okay awesome so perfect let me green means go okay that's actually not rendering correctly but it's good enough hopefully it won't cut off any of the wording because i ran it right to the borders right to the edges let me see what's gonna happen here uh looks like we're gonna be barely okay okay good deal all right amen the last time when we were bringing this thought to you if i might um just background just for maybe the first five or six minutes or so um we were taking you to paul's teaching there in the 13th chapter of hebrews because remember that he's writing his letter to hebrews these are jews and so and so he's writing to his countrymen and he's you know trying to get them to understand that 1600 years of animal sacrifice had come to an end and that now god while it's true as he told the church in the 17th chapter of acts that there was a time when god winked at their ignorance and allowed that kind of thing but now he required all men to repent and repent means you can't just say i'm sorry repent means to stop turn around and go the other direction so there's no your repentance thank you brother tony your repentance is not at all sincere nor is it effective if you fail to do that many times i remember some years ago brother matt uh brought a thought to us how that very often times people are very sorry for the situation that their sin has got them in they're very sorry for the result that they're in but they're not exactly repentant of the sin itself and so they're just very uh regretful over what it's caused israel did that to god constantly he would bring judgment upon them they would straighten up and then he would you know take the judgment away and they would backslide again and and so we find that this is the way of the unregenerate man you can't listen friends you don't have enough willpower to get yourself to heaven amen you just don't have enough willpower to do that it's going to take you're going to have to surrender to the grace of god and let him change your heart change you from the inside out and so we realized that that you know they were the jews were having such a hard time getting rid of that you you find that um in in galatians where judaizers had come among the galatians who paul had won to the lord and began to get them to you know want to take a a way of legalism and they they somehow they had it this this desire that they wanted the the ceremony of the old testament back they wanted to go back to the law they wanted to have these do's and don'ts and you know paul just popped brilliant just such a brilliant beautiful mind that the apostle paul has paul's apostle paul says he just he takes them back to sarah and hagar and he says so which kind of child do you want you know do you want a child born free or do you want a child born of a promise or do you want a child born in slavery because hagar was a slave and in and in the old testament the condition of the mother passed to the son amen see so if she was a slave he was a slave and so so paul has said why would you why would you refuse the promise which came through sarah which is by grace and you're actually asking to take the route of hagar who was a slave who had a slave you know he he brought him to jerusalem he said he said okay which which jerusalem you want the one we're in now we're slaves to the romans the roman government runs our city you know the roman government gives us our laws is this the jerusalem you want or would you rather have the jerusalem above which is free see and so and and then other examples also that paul used there to make his case and so you know he said you know you've been bewitched to think that you can earn it through works you know it's it's it's you started by grace you're gonna have to finish by grace and grace doesn't ever turn into disgrace we're talking about the real goods where you literally get the life of christ inside you and then it's no longer you that live it's christ living it has nothing to do with your willpower you understand you grit your teeth all day long the devil will finally get you come into a service get under the condemnation or the conviction of the holy spirit make a pledge to god i won't do that again it won't be long you know when you get all revived like that but you lack the new birth you know what happens the devil just the devil's still in there that evil nature's still there yeah see that snake hasn't been gotten rid of yet and all the devil does is just retreat into his castle pulls up the drawbridge and doesn't wait you out and as soon as the revival fires are gone because you're you're you're a camp star remember brother branham preached that in in uh and and the hidden uh uh the interval i think they renamed it to why people are so tossed about but uh and and then you're just a camp star you know you you're in the camp but you're out there living just by the stars and you know at one time you got daylight and then the next time you got nighttime and you might have stars but you might not you can't see your way clear and then some people come in you know they come in to live by the menorah by the seven golden lampstands he said but you know the problem with that you try to stay down into that into that way of the ages and sometimes those candles smoke out they have to be they have to be clean those lamp stands those wicks have to be trimmed but you know what happens if brother branham was trying to say but if you just go one more step into the third realm if you become a third realm dweller then you're in the shekinah you've got a golden pot of manna that never fails if you need healing get take out and start eating out of that pot if you need deliverance just start eating the the aaron's rod blossoms blooms and blossoms in the presence you'll always have the presence of god in your life amen and so paul was saying finally saying to the hebrews here listen if you're going to if you're going to go that way and stay with that ceremony of altars and temple worship and animal sacrifice then i'm here to tell you that in christ we have an altar that you even don't even have a right to eat at amen if you're going to stay back there in the tabernacle you don't even have rights to this altar the only way you have rights to this altar is to come out of that old system the only way you have rights to christ is to be born again of the holy spirit see it's not gonna it's not going to get you to heaven just because you believe that the the bible is true or that the message is true or that jesus was the son of god or that brother branham was a prophet of the age because i got a sad news for you all you've done in doing that is join satan's club he believes all of that amen amen amen he believes it absolutely believes it how would he not be pretty crazy to not because both jesus in his earthly ministry and jesus in his last day messenger the devil took such a beating he'd be crazy not to believe amen so it's it's not just about mentally believing it you've got to become it this word came to become this word arrived on the scene it's christ in you that's the hope of glory so you have no right to eat the world in their in their organized way of christianity they have no right to eat at our table yeah amen and it's that is so established with god that when he comes into the first part of the book of revelation you'll find that he he talks about how that that that they they they have they're dealing with this name of blasphemy and of course it's singular and the name of blasphemy brother branham taught us was that trinity baptism and father son holy ghost trinity teaching but you'll notice that by the time it gets all the way over uh to the 17th chapter now it's not a singular name of blasphemy it's names because why this this this mother of harlots has had children so now it's names of blasphemy and brother branham called it because he looks brother the lord the lord is dealing with him in in his yard i think he's mowing his grass and says you know brother brad i'm talking about the catholic church and the spirit of god says don't call that that and brother brown says what do you mean he says that's not they're not a church they're a lodge amen so he said you don't have a a catholic church you have a catholic lodge you don't have a methodist church you have a methodist lodge you don't have a upc church you have a united pentecostal whatever you would rather have said call it what you want church god church christ doesn't matter it's a lodge and it's part of the harlot daughters because because and the holy spirit directed him to the greek in his diaglott it doesn't say names of blasphemy it says blasphemous names and brother said that's a big difference from names of blasphemy so what started out singularly in the church when it invaded the church as a name of blasphemy by the time you get to the end time it's got 2 000 years and it has accumulated daughters and they're all blasphemous names and they they can they can it doesn't matter that they read from this book or sing our same songs i'm not talking about the people i'm talking about their system people who abide that system have no right to the table where you sit they have no right to the altar they're they and and that you know what that means that means they they can't get born again right amen because they have no right to the altar and that's why it comes all the way at the end in chapter 17 at the end time and the lord by the time we get to now by the time we get to now that god's not dealing in those ages like that anymore he has called the bride come out of her my people arise shine thy light has come and so we've been caught up now to the opening of the book and now we're we're not eating on the body of a man on the words of a man we're eating on the body word of the son of man amen and that's our table that's our altar there's where forgiveness of sins exists scripturally scripturally see so there was a time when he gave that system a space to repent and that time is over amen so he said i'll cast her into a bed of death and her children with her yeah see and so you you you have to that's why today that i take this title no place at the altar and for a subtitle god declaring a difference and calling for separation amen my sermon today might seem hard against against denominations please bear in mind we're not preaching against people we're preaching i'm trying to help those people by identifying that their system is leading them to the mark of the beast if you love them you'll do the same if you've got christian friends who are caught in that system and you claim that they're your friend you claim that you have affection and love for them then you will surely tell them that friend my oh i love you and i want you to know that if you stay in that system you will take the mark of the beast that's right say well i don't i don't i don't want to rock the boat well then they'll die without mercy and it'll be on you see so you're you're you're here you're not your own you're here to be a messenger you're here to be a witness god gave you eternal life so you could tell others about it god's not santa claus you know he didn't just hand out gifts you know some big jolly thing that you know the more he piles on you the more you love him generally the more a kid gets piled on them the more spoiled they get but he's not that kind of father he's a father who loves correctly and so he he has placed us here and given us the gift of eternal life we made the analogy last time and i i thought i i didn't feel i even sufficiently got the burden of my heart off and thought i might touch it again today where we were saying you know i made the reference how that you know there's plenty of churches around just our little seaside city there's plenty that will let you sisters wear short skirts never say anything to you other than they might compliment you they'll let you brothers take social drinks and get mad and cuss and maybe smoke on the side and gamble and do all kinds of things they'll let you men get out here and run around naked also and they'll tell you you're a fine christian and they'll make you feel good and they'll pat you on the back they might even make you put you in the choir amen so why would you come here where all of that stuff is blown up amen the truth so why are you here you there there's way more churches that you could that church could be a much more fun experience for you say well when i get old enough that's exactly what i'm going to do some have some have that doesn't stop the parents or the pastor from praying for them see and believing and and and i'll tell you like brother branham told billy he said you know he said you know you're standing like a cross and he said you've went down this wrong way he said but somewhere down that line god will turn you around because i've already claimed you for this side now the priest say well that's wonderful no there's a caveat the rub is brother branham said but to get back might be a long road hole and you wish you had it never went down that way because daddy and mama and pastor aren't going to let you get off of this one and so you know it's you you you you gotta you gotta understand that that's how god loves but but my point to you friends is listen the point is so if you're going to come here and you're going to subject yourself to gun barrel straight preaching if you're going to come here and say i'm a christian then be one amen if you're gonna say i'm a believer then be one because you're crazy you're crazy to come here and not be amen you're nuts you should go somewhere where you don't get beat up all the time you should go somewhere where they just let you do whatever you want see you're nuts to come here because that's never going to happen as long as this is on the pulpit so if you're going to come here as a believer and you say i say why do you come here you know what you could say to me and i would say the same thing to you i you know if god came down and his voice thundered through this building today how many believe that could happen god spoke right out people thought it sounded like thunder that's the voice of god rolling around and let me tell you something jesus turned to a crowd and he turned to his own when 70 left him because they didn't like getting beat up and he turns to the to the his 12 and says why don't you go too to paraphrase way brother branham coins it why don't you go too will you go also jesus said and they had that wonderful answer lord where in the world would we go i'm here for life i'm here because i want life where else am i going to find life so you know i'm here to tell you something friends if the voice of god would thunder in this building today and i'd and you'd hear the words of the lord to say will you go also you're looking at one boy who would raise up both hands and say lord where would i go you have the words of life i want to be right here i don't like getting beat up either so so you know i've always said this if the shoe fits weird i had i've had people stand me up before were you preaching against me yep yeah really yep it's preaching everybody you're in the crowd yes and i was preaching to you yeah no no no no i mean were you preaching exactly to me sure no i mean particularly to me [Music] you know but no i mean i said no hold on hold on let me clarify it for you so you don't have to keep going around the world if the shoe fits wear it yeah and if you don't like the shoe grow and it won't fit right it's all you got to do grow she won't fit no more amen hallelujah so so we find that that we we come to this place and and watch let me now let me take some scriptures here i'm going to have to get moving oh the lord is dealing with me so early this morning and i just cannot can i just take my time even if i don't finish i won't wear you out we'll stop and we'll make a third part if we have to make it 30 parts if we have to um all right so so now we find then that here's a point that i want to make before we go to our very first scripture make sure it's right yep before we go to our very first scripture i want you to catch something in the bible all right how many like to do that here it is god has a different lens that he looks through you might look through it and you might see it as a certain thing just be aware that god looks through a different lens see you you can look you know as a human being we can look at people and go well wow that's a pretty good person you know i mean they love the lord they go to a church but you have to understand that what might look good to them it obviously does why they're there and it might look fine to you god uses a different lens see and so you're going to have to accept his view of things and you know something friends humanly speaking from a from just a straight up human living in a body that's still not yet converted that can still get mad right right amen sure that can still get disappointed that can still stumble in their faith hey we're all in this thing together aren't we come on all you holy people let's admit it let's just take ownership of that today we're we don't always get it right but i know i always want to and when i don't i'm always repenting see say why do you repent because i didn't want to do it that way i wanted to do it his way that that more than any other thing shows my heart's been changed because you can't want that naturally the human the human spirit the human mind is enmity against god it could never agree with god and never desire what god desires it can be afraid of hell it can be afraid of the tribulation and not want to go there and try to serve god out of fear it can it can serve god out of guilt see i know this is wrong i know i know i shouldn't do it i know god's against it i know i was raised different you know i just feel so guilty i'm going to comply you know you're wasting your time too what you why are you here if that's all you're ever going to come to let me tell you something friends why do we preach why do we have a church why do we gather to change us into him you can't go to heaven in your condition and you can't improve it's only only he the only life he can accept is his own see and so that's got that has to be what is on display in your life so now you're ready to look through god's lens that's weak wow you ready to look through god's lens amen all right second corinthians 6 14-18 be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship here is a very good question this is a question you ready to answer it in your heart for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness now the only answer that you could give me that would be a positive answer to which i would say amen go for it is if you're saying i'm trying to witness and win win them and if you're doing that well and good but that don't take years that don't take months a lot of times it don't take weeks you understand don't let the devil fool you into thinking that you know it's okay to have this relationship with this person and you never tell them the truth you understand all right watch what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness is that a valid question isn't that logical and what concord hath hath christ with belial belial is something worthless what concord would you have with that what agreement would you have why would you interlace and intermingle yourself with something worthless right amen and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god so if what agreement would the temple of the living god have with idols amen so then what's those things in your life that shouldn't be there amen i might get quiet it's all right if i can get myself to go in here and try one more time here we go as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them did i say that or did paul say it amen amen reject me all you want disagree with me all you want i didn't say it he said it right i will be and he's he's he's only speaking to you the voice of god wherefore come out from among them see and be is separate paul quoting the scriptures saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty so how many want to be sons and daughters of the almighty amen let's go to peter but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you see ah who privately shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves bring upon themselves swift destruction and many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of not sad amen verse 9 the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished but chiefly them that walk after the flesh and the lust of uncleanness and despise government presumptuous are they self-willed they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities but these as natural brute beasts you know what made them a brute beast say well they just became a horrible person they didn't become a brute beast they were born a brute beast that's why god can have mercy on them that's why brother branham would say god will never condemn a man for being a sinner right not a beautiful thing god will never condemn a man for being a sinner because the man was born a sinner see god knows that god the bible says man was subjected to it the creature was subjected to it not willingly he is the way we came it's part of god's plan of redemption brother branham said for that reason god will never condemn a man for being a sinner because he was born a brood beast see by your by the way you were born and so the only way to undo that is to get the holy ghost and then it's no longer you the brute beast living it's christ so i'm not i'm not up here today you know you know just trying to crush everybody that doesn't believe the full word of god that's not even what this sermon is about this sermon you know what if i had a a church full today who were not believers at all and had never really heard about the message i wouldn't be preaching this sermon to them no nor would i want you to i'd want you to go out and tell them about hey i know you think what you got is great but let me tell you there's something more you know give them something to love give us show them something i'm preaching this sermon to you because you're already supposed to be believers you're already supposed to know that we have no fellowship or concord with darkness and if you want to be pleasing to the lord god who bought you then give your life to him and get rid of idols and get rid of your idols in association and in your recreation and in your lifestyle and in your habits come on amen amen amen amen see say oh you'll never win anybody preaching this kind of sermon i wouldn't be preaching this kind if i was in a crusade somewhere see i'd sure not hesitate to tell them about a god of i wouldn't hesitate to tell them there is a lake of fire but i'd also tell them that there's jesus who saved them from it if they wanted but i'd make it clear that they understood that jesus is his word that a simple belief in a historical figure is not going to be sufficient alone to give you a new birth because you have to come to where he's at now this is the same one that died on calvary only this is more of him amen you understand that so so you have the one at calvary that's that that that occupies about that occupies about that much in this book the man at calvary there's a lot more than the man at calvary amen so if you really love them you want to tell them about everything that god has for them but these as natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed speak evil of the things that they understand not do you know why that sounds so harsh because you say wow wow god is just like really harsh he's talking to people who chose this yes they chose this god will never condemn a man for being born like this but he said what will condemn the man is who condemned himself because he remained this when he did not have to god coming in the likeness of his son paid the price for you to be redeemed and it's free what would you pay i mean look at what they pay these days they they take a man because that he can bounce a ball and get it to go through a hoop better than anybody else and they pay him more money one man than probably all the all the income of the of the entire globe you know or at least america uh 200 years ago yeah amen they pay one man to do that what so so if if they're willing to pay that kind of money to somebody who can put a basketball through a hoop what would you value eternal life at all i mean when you can't get that ball through the hoop anymore eternal life is still going strong when you don't spend all that money and all your fame and nobody even remembers you anymore eternal life is still shining so what would you pay what would you pay if you're if you're willing to say yeah i think that athlete deserves that 50 million contract well then what would you pay the lord jesus to give you eternal life well good news it won't cost you a dime hallelujah it's free you can have it all you got to do is accept it oh my gosh and shall utterly perish in their own i'm going to add this on the authority of other verses their own willful corruption amen because god doesn't delight in the death of anybody even a sinner he goes on peter's not done with us having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable souls a heart they have exercised with covetous practices cursed children which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of balaam the son of boser who loved the wages of unrighteousness that is for lack of a better term stunning you know it's interesting that and and don't forget that my subtitle is that god is calling for a separation see god is calling for a separation from these things and so here's here's a clue to something that they did they followed the way of balaam that peter's saying the people today are following in the same way that the people followed balaam back there in fact as you'll notice that they do that again in the pergamon church age that they have the they have this whole thing of balaam you know and and and you'd be amazed at how brother branham deals with this a lot in the church age book and and the series how that balaamism and nicolaitanism are so intertwined and i never understood quite why that was such a connection to brother branham until i started doing a little bit of research on this on this whole thing of balaam or balaam-ism and so here's some commentary from bible knowledge commentary one of my favorites and so there whether you're talking about israel in the wilderness in the book of numbers or whether you're talking about peter in his day or whether you're talking about the pergamy and age down through the ages whether you're talking about now the principle's always the same and one of the things that that the bible knowledge commentary points out is that balaamism refers to a sub that people were guilty of a severe compromise that's what was happening in pergamus especially that they that they were guilty of making a very severe it wasn't a light thing it probably started that way but they were making a severe compromise and and and you have to understand what was happening in in pergamus at that time that the church because pergamos means married and so now the church is really coming into that state of matrimony with the false antichrist church it's only going to be one just by the next age they're going to crown a false prophet put a triple crown on his head and plunge head long into the dark ages all right amen so we find that that it had gotten to the point around the christians around the real true believers that that you know it's it's all about balaamism and eating meat sacrificed unto idols and committing fornication that's what balaamism was they invited them in the feast of bel peor to eat meat sacrifice to idols and to commit fornication because the the temples in those days in in order for you to have a spiritual experience supposedly you had to go in and have carnal relations with a priestess and so they had prostitutes in the temple of these heathen churches and and then you've got to realize that people in mass overwhelming numbers who would go to those temples then they carry that out in their daily life around and they're coming around the believers just like they do today your children go to school with people who who who eat who prostitute the word of god with the same spirit of adultery and your children go to schools and public schools i've i was from the day i raised my children i still stand on it i don't condemn you you're welcome to do however you choose i stand opposed to public school for kids i'm against it was against it back then i'm against it to this day thank god we've got some charters and private schools and christian schools if we didn't have those my goodness we'd be forced with no other option but to homeschool and i'm i'm certainly in in in favor of women getting enough education so they can homeschool if they need whatever arise don't let me get on that i'm not here to preach on that today i don't even know why i said that amen but it's out there anyway the public schools are nothing but demons and devils and it's to the teachers the students the faculty the agenda the government the policies it's all behind it it's that's that's so ironclad you you'd never survive an argument with me on that because i can prove it by by statistics and what more that it proves what their true agenda has been and it's not much better it's worse probably in the colleges and that's why that's why if somebody's going to go to college i'm not opposed to that but get home go to a college where you can be home where you can still come to church where you can still be around your godly family this world is nothing but poison amen it's particularly rough on girls i appreciate the sisters that we've had who've went to college and held their head up high and got their degree and came out of college just as much of believers they were when they went in glory be to god it hasn't happened on all of them sadly but i appreciate the ones that it has happened on and so so we find then that here was a condition that was happening in in pergamus now catch this because this is what happened to the believers when they went to the feast of bel pior this is what was happening in the days of the apostles this is what was happening in pergamus this is what's happening now because that the false churches are so prevalent in overwhelming numbers because the believers are such an a tiny fraction less than one percent of a population generally speaking and and and the condition began to be from bible knowledge commentary to where any social contact at all with the world involved idol worship that's how bad it got amen to where the pergamy and believers couldn't go to any social event without it involving idol worship it was literally the public was so polluted with it that no matter where you went and we have that today you can't even go to a mcdonald's or to a walmart without seeing half-dressed women and and half-dressed men and rock and roll music you can't go anywhere it's pervasive it's on the streets it's in the schools you know don't you think you think i'm kidding go go make a seven-year-old mad who goes to a public school you'll get cussed out i bet it happened words i didn't know a seven-year-old could even know that's happened more than one time that's that's where we are today friends make no mistake this world is toxic poisonous and if it and it's in total darkness and gross darkness upon the people do you think that's a prophecy for some day coming no that's now and your only way to survive it is to come up higher come up into the light come to the brightness of his rising because i will promise you that you can't go in public you can't socialize without running into idol worship amen amen your children can't do it no way can they do it amen that's why i say to parents for goodness sake scrub them up every day when they come in yeah so a little bit too big for me to throw in the bathtub i ain't talking about bathroom water i'm talking about this one take them and wash them that's good come on parents what do you think you think they stand a chance especially if they don't if they're not born again and you're not lit and you're not every single solitary day scrubbing them head to toe in this and they don't even know that this never even gets opened maybe twice a week if you're if you're streaming a service or bring them to the house of god come on friends you understand we're in satan's eden and you know what you say brother jason why are you so hammering on this because we're the rapture's close we're almost home and not only that i say it could be another 20 years fine another 20 years i can do it i can do 20 more years as long as i know that we got a church where the power of god is moving we got a church where signs and wonders happen we got a church where devils are defeated we got a church where people get the holy ghost i can do 10 20 or 30 more until the day i die but what i will not do and lay back and just let our young people blow into the world and parents that don't care i'm here to tell you something friends care have a care i care god cares amen [Music] take them to every let me get off of that anyway i know you love your children i'm so thankful for that i'm so thankful you know and i i can't i i'm so thankful for the parents in here that love their kids i'm so thankful my grandkids are raised i'm so thankful i raised my kids in the love of god i'm i'm on the backside of that i'm telling you it was worth it it was worth it to have them in church every service it was worth it to have the bible read in our home it was worth it to play tapes when they were growing up i see the effects of word raising in my grandkids and if the lord tarries and they have kids i hope it keeps continuing but it got that's where it got to that any social contact at all you could not you couldn't have any social contact without some form of idolatry and usually there was they they go on to say in the history and pergamos that usually meet in the marketplace had even been offered to idols earlier i know paul dealt with it i'm not not trying to qualify that or disqualified today i'm just simply saying that it's siege of discrepancy and you understand that you and your family go out into the world and interact and you do you have to you know why because we don't build a commune we don't live like that i haven't went out anywhere and bought 100 acres and put put big walls around and cloistered us all in we're not interested in that we're interested in going out into the hedges and the highways but just understand that that that everything that you contact out there is something sacrificed to idols and it's it's laced with idolatry this is serious friends this is serious and so it it seems that sin had crowded in so tight there in pergamum that you know that contact with it became more and more impossible you know it kept accumulating until we've accumulated today at unprecedented levels you're everywhere you go brothers and sisters you brothers three quarters of us are self-employed business owners every time you go in somebody's home you know something you make sure that your light is brighter than their darkness you young people you go to school you make sure your light is brighter than the darkness you're going into mom dad when you get them home shine some light on them hallelujah i was looking at a study here recently and uh it caught my attention because elon musk was involved in it starting a year ago and is rather secretive they didn't say a whole lot about it it's just starting to come out now and because he's i have a lot of interest in things that he's doing and he got involved in a project to where they were they they've taken laboratory mice and they've they put electrodes inside their brain now it's not not you can't totally correlate that to a human because a human has a much larger far more complex brain than a mouse but but they're just showing you know proof of concept that that they actually uh took the mice and put something to scare them like some image that they would be afraid of a natural predator and the mouse would freeze in fear like my like mice do when they get afraid they'd freeze and then they would take the image away and the mouse is going about his business and those electrodes indicated on their on their devices what that fear looked like and they recorded it and then they waited and a couple days later they let the mouse run around in his cage he still got those electrical wires in his head and they just played it back to him and without the image at all he froze in fear and they were literally able to plant a thought in his head and and they and they've realized now that they can they can plant happiness they can defeat depression they can defeat all these it's just cutting edge of science and that was a year ago and they hoped within maybe 10 years to get to where they could lose the wires they didn't need 10 they only needed one yeah and you know how they do it now late they literally shine a light in intensely and and like fiber optic networks that travel by light they shone the light on the on the head of the mouse with no electrodes anywhere streaming from him he's got receptors still in his brain and they just shine the light and immediately they can get him to play be afraid be happy scream they can get him to eat they can get him to eat from which bucket they want all by light i sit there thinking brother mark i thought let this mind which is in christ jesus being you how does it come friends from the light of god's word oh don't underestimate the light of god's word you got a problem in your life you need more lights you got problems and fears and anxieties and weaknesses you're in bondage today get under the light open your mind and your heart to the light of god's word and let god channel and fix those things inside you amen so we find i'm i'm i'm going to have to find her i'm not going to finish but it's okay interestingly the bible knowledge commentary goes on to say and this is as far as i went with it it talks about how that the problem in pergamus was compromised with worldly morality and pagan doctrine said it was prevalent in the church especially in the third century when christianity became popular that always happens when you're involved with a christianity that's popular true christianity is never popular so if you find yourself in a christianity that's palatable and popular to your associates you're obviously projecting the wrong idea about christianity get mad if you want that's the truth and so it says so compromise with with pagan here's what happened when christianity becomes popular compromise with pagan morality and a departure from biblical faith soon corrupted the church and lastly they make this point that i thought was astonishing and and let me know why brother branham connects it so closely to nicolaitanism that that the that the the nicolaitans this is actually dr constable from dr constables notes actually he says the nicolaitans evidently regarded these sins as acceptable under the pretense of christian liberty don't they do the same thing today oh jesus just loves me it doesn't matter how i live doesn't matter how i dress doesn't matter what i do i love jesus jesus is cool why'd they kill him why do they hate him in the form of his word today see if you've got a jesus that people are in love with and they're unconverted you're showing them the wrong jesus the only way they're going to love the jesus is if you're converted and they get converted and they'll love that jesus and i do love that jesus the more you look like this the more i love you amen that's what makes us love one another that's why you ever wonder why the family of god can actually get conceived you might have a blood family that are not born again not in the message not in not even in christians you ever notice that the family of god becomes closer to you than your own blood family what's up with that how is that even possible because it's the love of god moving among us it's real this isn't this isn't some imagination this is real and tangible you can actually possess the love of god hallelujah see and and so we find then he says he says interestingly dr constable says interestingly balaam in hebrew can mean swallow the people i've never heard that below it can mean swallow balaam can mean in the hebrew one of its renderings swallow the people so dr constable says so the ideological connection between balaamism and nicolaitanism which is conquer the people and and balaam which is swallow the people no wonder they're so connected no wonder god is saying it in the scripture because you know what you know what ends up happening friends is that you associate with the world and in spite of the fact that you try to stay free of it you get too close you you rub shoulders with it's idolatry you eat off of its poisonous toxic tables you have it in your homes and your car in your associates and your recreation and your activities you get a little bit of washing once or twice a week if you come to the house of god and and then you know what ends up happening balaamism swallows you amen and the next thing you know it's nicolaitanism because it conquers you and here you come to church week in and week out sometimes year in and year out and bound with the same thing the same thing and you never get free i'm here to tell you something friends there's a remedy for you today but it's going to take your willingness to surrender and let god live inside you you can't do it on your own and if and if you don't do this you're going to end up like that it's inescapable amen i'm going to stop with this with this statement i'm just going to it's going to stop anthony bring your team and come back constable concludes with this i want you to listen to this lest you think in your mind william branham was just an old fogey you know that's a 50-plus year old message and we're we're living in a modern day well let's go outside the ranks let's here here's one of the most respected scholars uh from dallas theological seminary all right listen to what dr constable says the main facet of the doctrine of balaam which is being promulgated in the churches today amen is the teaching that equal future blessings and rewards have been set aside for every christian solely on the basis of christ's finished work on calvary and the christians position positional standing in christ thus all christians here's the thinking all christians regardless of their conduct during the present time will receive crowns and positions of power and authority with christ in the millennial kingdom that's what dr constable says that's what's wrong he said this is what's broken in the world he said that everybody's got this idea every christian solely on the basis of christ's finished work what he did and and what his what he did gives me my position in christ and because i say he was the son of god took away the sins of the world and i go to a church then i'm going to get equal authority and blessing and power in the millennial world listen to what he goes on to say however the teaching throughout the word of god is to the contrary the israelites did not sin with immunity and neither can christians sin in the camp of israel re resulted in the israelites being overthrown in the wilderness short of the goal of their calling and it will be no different for christians no different amen perhaps you know you've seen maps sometimes where you they're old ancient maps where they didn't have the whole world mapped and you'll see a ship going across the ocean and they'll have you know water waves and here's a land mass and over here is like uh they're not sure what it is but they've gotta they'll they'll they'll they'll you'll see like a sea monster coming up because it it's it's indication that they don't know what's there and it's pretty spooky it's probably bad and and they'll they'll have the term here be dragons you ever seen that on an old map you'll have a ship going across and way over here in uncharted waters it'll say here be dragons they they even they they have that's in in in latin and hebrew that i can't dare pronounce but and then and then the romans the romans and medieval uh cartographers you know they they would use a different version of of literally uncharted lands they would say here be lions they'd show a commander here's your map here's what you're doing here's where we are here but over here here be lions here be lions or if you're if you're a mariner here be dragons yeah amen i'll tell you something friends satan has got the world in such a condition mankind plodding along blindly eating eating from tables of adultery eating from tables of idolatry and it's in every it's in the social fabric it's embedded in society and there's no way for you to even live anymore outside of it unless you went and lived in a commune and then you might still have three kinds of believers in there goodness we have three kinds of believers in here god forbid but we could i hope we don't i hope you're an unbeliever you'll give your heart to the lord today and i hope if you're a make-believer i'm what i'm preaching will give you a concern will give you a pause to say wait a minute i better make sure i got the real goods because i'm going to tell you something friends what's out there in the world here be dragons make no mistake here be lying say what's out there oh if i could just get my education and get out of this home and get out from under my parents and i go make my own life hey there's dragons out there there's lions out there waiting to devour you don't do it friends give your whole heart give your allegiance to jesus christ we're almost home we're almost home you're right at the finish line there's a world waiting on you in a life waiting you can't even describe don't let the devil fill you with some vision out there that remember i don't care what it looks like to you god looks to a different lens and you better not trust yourself you better trust him let that mind which was in christ jesus amen be in you amen let's stand sing for us brother anthony holyness holiness
