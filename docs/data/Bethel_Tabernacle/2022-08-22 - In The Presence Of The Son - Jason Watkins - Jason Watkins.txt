god happy to see you all out in the house of god today amen looking forward to the word of god are your hearts ready amen they need to be ready the lord is uh mindful of those who come prepared and who desire the word of god amen i desire it it's my it's my daily bread it's my water it's my life it's my everything amen praise the lord we're gonna invite you this morning right to the scripture i want to get started we're going to go right to the 10th chapter of the book of revelation god bless you as you turn and they put that on the screen and we're going to read the 11 verses that are there it's extremely familiar to us but i have a purpose in doing it and um i believe a purpose the lord is behind and i want to take today a title in the presence of the sun s-o-n in the presence of the sun and as a subtitle i'm taking a rational look at revelation chapter 10. now that's not the whole of my sermon and it was going to be the main body of my sermon but i don't always get to choose that so we're going to have to go over it quickly and get to the real burden on my heart today say well why why not just jump to that well because i i feel led to do it this way amen there's a number of things that we want to say uh that are really the the burden of our heart hence the title in the presence of the son you'll see why just in a few minutes in fact as i'll tip you off now where brother branham talks about that that's where we are is laying in the presence of the son amen and so from that i want to take in the presence of the son and that's my real burden but to really have it be effective i we we want to look and establish some things that we know uh probably would take the first 15-20 minutes and just go over things that we know but i want to go over it slowly and i'll go over it rationally and uh and i just want to get you thinking would that be all right amen i want to put your minds in gear in the scriptures today revelation chapter 10 we'll begin verse 1. and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his fetus pillars of fire being a bible student and teaching on these kinds of things i always want to go down rabbit trails but i'm not going to do that we've got to just get right through this and verse 2 and he's and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and square by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings let's pray father we commit ourselves into your hands having read your word now lord master laying underneath my bible on purpose are pillowcases father that were sent to me by a sister who has a friend lord with cancer in in her brain and she asks specifically would you have my pillowcases prayed over so lord while we are ministering the word oh master anoint them father according to the book of acts in may when she lays her head upon these pillowcases may the enemy get scared and run for it lord may she be well for your glory in the name of jesus christ we commit it to you in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated so if you will please this morning give me your undivided attention and i will try to go as quickly as i can i have a mountain of material to cover and uh i i'm a lot of different quotes i want to put up on a powerpoint and i'd very much like to get to all of it today and so you just be a little patient you know i'm not a long-winded preacher so i'll go quick uh so if you don't pay attention you'll get lost in the shuffle amen and so um we want to go studiously uh forward so we found out um last time and i'm not continuing my series i i feel like we found the stopping point to take that series on the seven vowels of revelation but one of the last points that we were making that is in turn relevant to what i want to say today is we found out that god sends forth his word to those who were in the mind of god before the foundation of the world and those people run towards it you remember that now you were shouting at the end of the last service when we said that so you run towards the light amen as a believer you run towards it and and that has been in every age it doesn't matter when the word uh for the age comes uh to them we found out that like mary when they hear the prophecy and they hear that they are a part of it they just say amen and as we've said to you before that's really all a believer is capable of saying when they're confronted with the word of god i i i challenge any believer to try to say otherwise than amen even if you have to say amen oh me amen oh my amen help me lord but there's something inside of a believer that will not let you deny the word of god and as we've said then also we find that as soon as a believer believes god's word then god is incapable of doing anything other than bringing it to pass it you're a man your belief in the word since he made the promise and you believe it then you took him at his word now he takes you at your word and then what does he do he brings it to pass and so we find that it's quite unstoppable and that's a real big point that you want to absorb today because it doesn't matter you know we said last time as we were closing out there are 200 million demons as brother matt was preaching on wednesday they're not headed to to the jews anymore the hitler's gone eichmann's gone stalin's gone where they have now turned their attention to is the elect lady to the bride of jesus christ but it doesn't matter if there's 200 million 400 million 900 million a hundred hundred million a billion nothing can stop you believing god's word and god bringing it to pass in your life it is quite unstoppable the word made flesh is happening and there are not enough power not enough demons in all of hell to prevent it i take comfort in that i don't know about you but that just fills me with courage today because i realize that even i can't stop it say why are you worried about you because i'm my greatest enemy but but when i know that my greatest enemy can't even stop it that it will bring even my greatest enemy subject to the word of god then you can imagine why i'm quick to say amen amen we find that in the marriage of the lamb and i don't have this one if you just leave that screen right there we find that in the marriage of the lamb uh brother joe carter sent me this weeks ago and i held on to it because it's meant a lot to me brother branham says israel was promised a promised land but they had to fight for every inch of it now i hope you're ready to be a fighter today if you want your inheritance you're going to have to fight for it because the devil's not going to surrender it just willingly see and so so if he's on your property today he will have to be thrown off all right and so this is the age where god is calling for champions who are ready to take the promise of god storm the gates of the enemy overthrow his works and take the land say why should we do that because we own it it's ours by inheritance brother branham said they were promised the lamb had to fight for every inch of it what wherever the souls of your foot treads upon that have i given you god said to joshua it was all there which means everything is in the place you got to fight there's nothing on this side of the not fighting everything is in the fighting side all right so it's all there the land was there and god gave it to them but they must fight for it the same way it is about divine healing and you're going to see here in a minute it doesn't matter what i mean the word of god has helped all your flesh so whether it's your mind or your body or your soul amen see uh it the the the say it's all you're going to have to fight brother branham says it's the same way about divine healing god watch this now god has got the power to heal you if you've got the courage to accept it now how many champions we got in here today say i have the courage oh my oh i want to say to that sister have courage today because god has the power to heal you to fix you and i i often need fixed i don't know about you but i'm all the time meeting fixed and repaired and i know he has the power but you've got to have the courage to accept it and but you'll fight every inch of the way that's a pretty devastating statement every inch every inch see god all right god has got amazing grace to save you and two things he will do it he will do it because you can't do it and not only he will do it but he will do it god has amazing grace to save you and he will do it but you'll have to fight every inch of your way hallelujah how many are saved by the blood of the lord jesus christ you're born again of the spirit of god you're looking to make heaven your home amen you're looking for a rapture you're looking for a body change you're ready to get out of this old pest house ready to say trouble's over well i'm here to tell you you better be a champion today because you're going to have to fight and if you don't have the courage to fight you're going to be a real big underachiever brother branham says i've been behind the pulpit going on 31 years this was in uh 1962. i've been behind the pool but going on 31 years and every inch of it has been a fight constantly it certainly has but we must fight if we must reign so we find out that the bride has to make herself ready all right now i'm going to get get ready to tell you how to fight because i'm not here to just you know amp you up in a fighting spirit all right i'm here to tell you that the only way you're going to be successful as a fighter is you're going to have to surrender what kind of army is this so we find out that the bride now he's just been finished saying you're gonna have to fight for every inch so we find out that the bride has to make herself ready is that the bible the bride hath made herself ready see so but i thought jesus saved me he's got power to save you he's got power to heal you but you've got to have the courage to accept it see and then when you're going to accept it then you're going to have to be ready to fight and your be your first your first your first training in fight school is to surrender be willing to lay aside every weight that does so easily beset us that we might run with patience the race that is set before us we must lay them aside ourself we must lay our self aside ourself all right we can't say god you come and lay them aside for us we got to do that everybody say ourself we got to do that ourselves see so we find then that this is the age that we have come to so whether in whatever way you're defending the gospel whatever way that that you are uh living a testimony whatever way that whatever victory that you hope to have in your life in your marriage in your family in your children it's going to have to take courage a willingness to fight and fighting your first fighting technique is to get you out of the way so the first enemy you gotta wipe out is that's the first guy's got to go no need to claim great promises of god and i'm here to tell you something friends now i i believe me as many quotes as i've got i want to look at i left off a ton and so i left off so many our this this is slide 43 i'm starting from so 42 of them i spared you okay so we spared you 40 the first 42. and i and i i'm not sure how many are behind this not that many but not 42 but but but no matter what we're when we start to look at these things and we we're moving into this territory a lot of the ones that i spared you are brother branham and i'll just give you the theme of all 42 of them that there's promises that the church ought to be experiencing in the last day and brother branham's concern when he's preaching to the to the pentecostal movement to the remnants of what was left of the azusa revival it all denominated and fractured and split apart and all this kind of stuff and they had allowed sin and the bars were lowered and now all kinds of things were going on that were not allowed in the early days and brother branham is trying to show them that you started out with all kinds of power you were healing the sick and you were raising the dead and people were getting the holy ghost and i don't just mean they joined a church they actually got born again teenagers were born again old people were born again didn't matter how old they were they could be born again and brother branham says now look at you now you're all split up and powerless say yeah but that was to them but brother branham is those principles still apply to us and those same principles brother branham said we ought to be way further up the road and he goes all the way into 1965 saying that that we ought to be seeing the dead raised among us we ought to be seeing the days of ananias and sapphira we ought to see devils put to flight we ought to see the holy ghost and the token on display what's wrong why don't we what hinders it you say well we do see some miracles you're right we do but why would i why would i be if you know i i realized that that it that jesus said you know some will be 30 some 60 some 100 okay so fine so i'm not i'm not ever gonna maybe i'm not okay i'm not a prophet of the age okay i'm not a dispensational messenger okay so maybe i'm not a hundred and and maybe i'm not even a sixty say maybe you're only a 30. okay then let me be a hundred percent of a 30. what i don't want to do is come up in 18 or 22 if i'm supposed to be at 30 if i'm supposed to be a 50 i don't want to be a 41. hallelujah i want to i want to have everything that god has for me so i if i want to maximize everything in our that that is promised of god then there's a way it takes a champion to do it you've got to have a champion's heart you've got to be willing to fight you've got to be willing to eliminate you from the equation as long as you're in the equation you'll never reach your 30 or you're 40 or you're 50 or 60 or 80 or 90 or whatever you whatever god has ordained for you to be that's one way of looking at that parable that's not the only way you could extrapolate it in a different way i'm perfectly aware of that just for purposes of example today so we realize that we've got to do that ourselves these promises are ours the the i'm going to tell you something friends the the gifts of the spirit belong to you divine healing belongs to you amen hallelujah the the the the not only you know the the gifts but the virtues of christ of faith and virtue and meekness and temperance these things belong to you because you've been born again of the spirit of god now your old flesh can't hold you back anymore unless you let him see and so it's about putting him under under the under your feet first and foremost and then that way god can move in your life and you can be an overcomer and a victor and that's what god is looking for in this day he says unto the angel of the church we didn't read it today but under the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness and it's a fair question you know this book of revelation because and we have to connect chapter 3 to our text of chapter 10 because chapter 3 holds the seventh angel and you see him again in chapter ten same same exact angel earthly messenger so if it's if it's given unto this last day messenger uh that he's he's written to this particular angel and his message is what i'm about to say to you uh you know what these things sayeth the amen the faithful and true witness now that's christ so then it begs the question why was this addressed to a single messenger i mean what he's going to hear is of monumental importance i mean it has it has titanic implications to the world what what what is promised and what god is because i mean this is the seventh age where they're putting christ out of the church now they're basically eliminating themselves from going in a rapture i'd say that's pretty huge i'd say that's headline the church worldwide by putting christ out because they put the word out they have eliminated themselves from going in the rapture and so you're not going to get a bigger story than that and so so what what is the message from the messenger i counsel of thee by of me i sav that your eyes may see in gold tried in the fire that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear these are promises that god has given the earth that if you'll just follow the word then you'll find redemption and so why was this addressed to a single messenger i think the obvious answer is because he was the only one capable of receiving it if you read the bible because it's it's it had to be an earthly messenger at the end time because he's going to book in the ages with the prophet so it has to be naturally then it follows bible teaching that the that the angel the seventh messenger of revelation 10 7 is also going to have to be a prophet because that's how god brings his word to the earth he's always done that down through the bible and can can i just say to you here today that that that is not a new truth that is a restored truth that's not a new truth people say oh you believe in the prophet you had that said lord come with a message that's not a new truth that's simply a restored truth he's always done it that way see so he'd say well we got good preachers aaron was the great priesthood but god couldn't allow aaron to call joshua to the tabernacle of the congregation in the book of deuteronomy moses had to do that why because moses was a prophet a prophet had to call joshua on the scene that matters that matters see it's very obvious then in the bible of course that the angel of revelation 3 14 is the same angel seen in revelation 10 7. i don't really see how someone could miss that you know could miss that the that the mighty angel of revelation 10 1 you know he's going to give these mysteries of the kingdom to this strong angel uh who then who who then is going to bring it to the to the family of god because and and then if you if you'll notice that he hears a voice from heaven now that's the same thing in revelation 18 4 that he heard a voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that's the messenger of the earthly angel come out of her my people and and and then when he's standing there receiving these mysteries john hears a voice saying now go ask the angel with his foot on the land on the sea and that's christ say well he doesn't go ask the seventh angel for the book that that's that's how the world misses it because they isolate a scripture right there and say see it couldn't have been that way but if you go back through the bible from genesis to revelation god always uses a messenger a prophet he doesn't come and and direct lip to ear with his family he uses a prophet and and the voice that's in that prophet's message is the voice of christ it's not they're not the man you understand it's not the man william branham was a man like me born in sin had to be born again of the spirit of god had his ups and downs like i got like you got like elijah had but it's the position that he holds in the scripture otherwise if he doesn't it has no life but i but as i eat it i get life so i know it must be true so the narrative makes it pretty clear that that john you know he he's got to have some some intermediary that that he can commune with it's got to be a a person it's got to be that's why an earthly angel is a man see and so so we find out that it's got to be someone god had to send the kind of a messenger that was that was kin to us as humans that someone who could instruct us how to uh partake of the open book of life and i'll tell you something friends you know as a student of the of the scripture just since a young boy i you know i feel the bible makes such an overwhelming case that this is none other than the elijah of malachi 4. i as a student i can't possibly miss that it's too plain and you know i mean as a lover and as a student of history especially correlating world history to bible prophecy you know a history of the 20th century really leaves no doubt in my mind that this prophecy lived itself out in the ministry life and ministry of william branham i'm just saying that as a historian as i look at history and i look at modern events and they're made clear to me in prophecy and i look at that ministry it has to be because there's not even another one even mildly remotely even close see so people can people can say what they want but i think that logic uh is certainly on my side see i mean my goodness how how blind would someone have to be so once the understanding then of revelation 10 uh the 10th chapter becomes clear to you and as such you must conclude that this ministry would then be the only authoritative voice in the earth for a rapture now i'm only using logic i'm only connecting dots i'm not making some big sweeping claims that i'm not laying the groundwork for i mean all we're doing is looking at the bible and we're putting it all together and it draws a picture see so hence this is a rational look at revelation chapter 10. and i'm only bring brief overview i promise you i could spend days just just teaching out of that one chapter and so so we find that that sense it would be the ministry of christ again in the ministry of the son of man now remember the son of man means working through flesh prophetically all right and so therefore it would it would facilitate the voice of the resurrection that's that's how it's going to come to us which is going to be the voice of christ that's why we say the elijah of this day brother branham said it the elijah of this day is the lord jesus christ see but god but christ comes working through his prophets do you you know i love the balance of that i love the fact that i can say he was a an ordinary man like me but he held a special office that god could step in and speak to us and yet it's the voice of a man he didn't save me i don't get baptized in his name i don't pray to him he's my brother but yet i can put my soul in the soul of everybody i love based on that voice and say that voice will get you home i don't know why people get out of balance on that to me it's the simplest thing in the world it's beautiful so so you know that the end time voice would end up being the voice that god would use then to also indict the generation for the this generation for the second crucifixion and as we've said the ominous words to you before according brother branham i do this in the presence of the judge so this ain't no joke the indictment was serious business i'm here to tell you the supreme court of heaven it was on their docket that day it was on god's docket that day and he had a prophet and god comes down to oversee the trial and he has a prophet standing there and says i indict this generation for the second crucifixion of the lord jesus christ as calling him your husband and you have been an adulterous woman adulterating the word of god and not believing it and and he wasn't he wasn't saying the people because you haven't believed i'm a prophet believed i'm the messenger he was saying because you have denied the very scriptures that you claim to be following hallelujah you see discernment you call it telepathy you you you you sis the sick healed and you said oh it's witchcraft oh it's all kinds of things the days of miracles is past and false baptisms and false godheads and you have denied and god has came down and proved it no wonder the indictment was legit now so logically then then then it then it should stand that all dissenting voices would have to be deemed illegitimate would have to be because this prophet has the authority of the scripture and he had he holds a position granted to him by god and so any dissenting voice then has to be deemed illegitimate it has to be see because this earthly angel having received the open book given into his hand by the mighty angel of revelation 10 1 which again is christ see because christ is the only one worthy to claim the book of life amen christ is the only he's the only one the book of light he's the only one who can open it who can take it who can claim it who can reveal it he's the only one who can give you life he's the only one who can redeem you see so this is god's provided way to redemption by the blood i mean that should make sense to you i mean you have no access to the physical blood so how's the blood going to save you you can't even get it you don't even know where in the world you can go to get it i don't have it don't come to my house the vatican don't have it it's not in israel the chemistry went down the cross and hit the earth and claimed the earth you understand but brother branham said but it's the life that's why jesus said this is my blood in the new testament it's the life coming it and it's your and how does the life come by a revealed word how do you get the life by believing the revealed word it's a revelation god gives it to you you accept it you believe it you're a seed gene of god comes to life and you're a new creation in christ and now the blood has been applied to you because you found it through the bleeding word oh my how how beautiful i mean it took a god to put that together i mean i mean the veins of jesus would have only held enough blood for a number of people yeah well you couldn't have painted every human being that would ever live with if you had all of his blood drained out of him in a paintbrush i couldn't cover i couldn't cover the current world in in that see so how are you going to do it so you have no physical access to the blood of christ so it's the life in the word is acquired by faith in the revealed word of your hour entitling you to a token and a new birth experience that this is a rational look at revelation 10. it's not a new truth it's a restored truth but brother m says in the literacy in church age god will confound them all this is the last quote i'll read that's not on my slides god will confound them all meaning the church world yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god pardon my voice it is its own mouthpiece so god is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her see yes it is for it says in the last chapter of revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from god as at pentecost the original one but of course of course of course of course that word bride will be repudiated as she was in the first age they didn't believe that she was the bride they didn't believe jesus was the son of god see so it stands to reason oh friends the value of knowing how to find favor with god in these kinds of times in this day there don't undervalue god revealing himself to you in his word oh don't take it for granted whatever you do i'm tell you something friends a lot of times as ministers we we be we and there's a quote i may get to it i'm not sure my time is burning up quickly but we find that you know this word has the ability to inspire faith and and healing and deliverance but you know sometimes a point needs to be made because a lot of times when we're when we're speaking on those kinds of things then everyone wants you know the fishes and the loaves but then when the word starts telling men how they should act and think and look and move and do and it starts telling women how they should act and look and think and move and do how where how they should dress how they should conduct themselves men the same way i mean it's so personal it's so personal that brother branham says to a man you talking about invading somebody's space he says get them bangs out of your face that's pretty flat that's that's a lot of audacity who's this kentuckian think he is i mean he's going to tell me how to comb my hair yep he's going to tell women he's going to talk about you know shorts and shorts on a woman say understand this and please hear me out don't throw something at me shorts on a woman are not ungodly under her skirt shorts are her underneath garment that's historically accurate not only i don't say that because william branham said that i study history that's historically accurate shorts were her underneath brother ram says at all times shorts are a woman's underneath garment no wonder a man is a city when he puts him on your pants don't come all the way down what's wrong with you what happened to you you want it you want to know the history just in the turn of the first turn of the 20th century just no longer ago than that it would have been unthinkable for a grown man to wear shorts in public you know who did that boys boys hysteria historically boys did that you know how you know who the first one to bust that the head of the boy scouts of america he come out and said oh you know it's part of a uniform and but but historically speaking no further back than just 1910 1911 1912 no further back than that that boys wore shorts because they were immature men they were boys and a and a and a and they they waited you're talking about waiting on a birthday boys watch the calendar and measure their height on a wall waiting for the day when they get to go out in public in pants it was a huge thing it was like his it was like his his crossing over i'm no longer a boy i got pants on [Music] mama said i could wear pants today see so you can imagine why brother branham would say and you know women would come to brother branham and say oh brother branham i don't wear shorts i wear slacks brother branham said that's worse because britches are a man's garment and that's an abomination to god it means it's nasty it stinks it's filthy it's vile shorts are not indecent under her garments that's her underneath garment so worn outside then she's indecent she's got an adultery spirit on her because men look at her and lust to have her because she's walking around outside with her in underneath clothes on the outside and she's exposing her nakedness so it's just okay i'll go put on pants no that's worse that's you'd be better to be indecent because wearing pants is an abomination to god and and and and listen women come to william branham they come to me they come to william branham it's i'm no different they called paul a woman hater because he said they shouldn't do this and shouldn't do that and they come to brother brandon they come to me they'll come to you these preachers in here have to brother jd sat in in turkey one time or egypt somewhere and just trying to go over these fundamentals of the scripture and women in the back you know are laughing and brother jason where was it jay's turkey or egypt in egypt and brother jason he didn't get mad he didn't blow us he didn't blow a stack he just he just cautioned him he said you know he said all i'm doing is reading the bible to you i'm telling you what the scripture says he said i wouldn't want to be the person on the day of judgment who has found and have a replay that you said and heard the bible read and you laughed at it you know what those women quit laughing immediately and you can you can you can get mad as you want to but this is what a prophet taught and and and women came to him and said oh well my preacher said it doesn't matter and william branham said one of the most terrifying statements i've ever heard in my life it sends chills every time i hear it he just said quickly he'll suffer for it in the regions beyond my preacher said it doesn't matter he'll suffer for it in the regions beyond now if the man who told you that is going to suffer where's it going to put you lady where are you going to be sister when you when you when you wear and dress indecently and put on garments pertaining to a man and call yourself a christian brother branham said you're not even a lady not even a lady would do that right see so now you can see why friends this age calls for champions it's not calling for wimpy people men men or women this is calling for people who are brave people who got courage people who say i will take the way with the lord's despised few i will change my life and change my wardrobe and change my i'll change a career i'll change a career path i'll do whatever i got to do i'll give away everything i just gotta have christ [Applause] because that's the secret to bringing the power of all these promises back into the church when we wanna see the dead raised and we wanna see the power of god move and we want to see the days of ananias and sapphira amen amen amen i may not get to that but i'm i'm in it's okay it's okay don't worry i don't close without permission ever ever ever ever i never step away from this pulpit without permission so you just don't worry about that you let me deal with that amen so there's a value in knowing how to find favor with god in this maddening age of insanity the problem comes in our hearts the sin in the hearts of people you know let me tell you something friends the only thing you say brother jason you you overvalue this message well can i just take you back to a story in the bible that should be familiar to you since your days of sunday school the only thing that kept tamar alive was the things that judah provided her with his ring and his staff and it was a it was a a mischievous underhanded thing that she did and judah was somewhere he shouldn't have been i get that's that should give us all courage that if something out of something like that an adulterous affair you know addressing and acting like a hooker and playing the part of it and judah taking that i mean and yet that and yet and yet it became the line of christ now you say would jesus be associated with that thank god yes thank god there's hope for us all no matter how vile we've ever been no matter where you are today he he can put you in his favor today he can erase all your sins and all your past and all your mistakes and completely throw him in his forgiveness and even god can't remember it oh i just say hallelujah glory to god that's the kind of god i want to serve and if believing this word gets me to that god then let me believe every line every verse every word about it don't let me deny or argue with any of it it was the only thing that kept tamar alive otherwise she would have been burnt but she pulled out a ring and a staff she said the man who gave me these and when they looked as judas and judas judah said she's been more righteous than i have the only thing keeping you from the tribulation was bound up under seven seals amen the only because the tribulation wasn't going to come in the first second third fourth fifth sixth age it was going to come in the seventh age and when you read we we read it in the book of revelation that that that the book was sealed in the time of john's writing he sealed it up why because the church had backslid it was going off paul had died paul had went home now john's the last one he's on an island of patmos as a prisoner and he gets this great revelation and it comes that's why you don't find qual paul or any of them quoting from the book of revelation they're already gone the church is already trending to to uh failure and it gets sealed up and it stays sealed and instead of christ being able to come and take a bride home he must now sit back down in the eternities and intercede for her ignorance because he can't lose her but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel i'm gonna unseal it all back again i'm gonna bring back the original word because i've got to have that original alpha bride back i'm talking about before she started descending in into idolatry he's got because she was supposed to go on to a rapture she couldn't she fell so now we have been restored back and now we're carrying on to a rapture and our obedience to the word that they failed to keep is what will bring them out of the depth out of the grave it'll bring every age imperfection from the grave that's a big deal that ain't no light thing a message come and a bride's believing it she's not just believing it mentally she's becoming it that's the evidence she believes that's the evidence it's a revelation is that it's actually becoming her life and the word is not just written here but it's written behind skin because brother man said once the books are closed for the last time then the word will be flesh see so so we find that it's the only thing people don't want it people deride it and reject it they attack it talking about disingenuous attacking something that you know makes good people and good lives and good families i mean if you don't believe it why in the world you attack that that's just crazy it calls for decency and holiness and honesty and integrity and responsibility and reliability and and and and righteousness and i mean good grief what's there to attack see and so so we find that it is the the thing that's keeping us out of the tribulation period it's the only thing that keeps us from idolatry and crucifying jesus the second time if it wasn't for this message and god revealing it to you you would be right there with the other crucifiers you'd be right there with them see don't those weren't all bad people they they were devout jews when they came in there peter was preaching to devout men devout jews they weren't hooligans and whoremongers they were devout jews and peter said you with wicked hands and determined counsel crucified the lord of glory so so we're not we're not saying they're horrible people we're not i'm not i'm not judging people today i'm just saying god has sent a word that is mercy to the world and and we find out that it is the very thing keeping us from crucifying christ the second time because you know why because you know why because the idolatry is in their hearts that's the real key that's the real purpose of a spiritual new birth amen you understand that god has to change the nature because the idolatry is in people's hearts so he sent i will send unto you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the hearts see what is keeping where's what's the idolatry it's i mean it's not i'm we're we're not suggesting that that these denominations and countless thousands of independents are going home and praying to idols catholics do that i'm not saying protestants do that they came out of that under luther's reformation that that's not the kind of idolatry it is it's it's it's the only reason that catholics pray and have idolatry with statues is because their heart is unconverted the only and and you say well the protestants don't do that the protestants have different kinds of gods they they bow to and ungodliness and and cares of the world and riches and that becomes their god and they forsake brother branham goes into i think satan's eden or god of this evil age i don't remember one of those barn burners and he says oh they say that they love the lord jesus says but they they don't they love satan and he says their life proves they love satan they hate christ because they say they love him but they hate him because they hate his word and and satan has somehow got them to divorce christ from his word and he's made them two different things so and there's an advantage in doing that satan's not a dummy if he can get people to separate that then they can they can deny this while still believing the historical man i believe that historical man 2000 years ago well but here's what his word oh no no no but i believe him and then satan was successful and that's why william branham one of the simplest things he kept telling them is he said christ is his word and you can't separate him you can't separate the message from the messenger and the messenger in the latter reign is the lord jesus christ see and so we find that the idolatry is in people's hearts hear me today hear me today friends because and and and then you you look at what they do they heap to themselves teachers who will tell them those things are okay teachers having itching ears as i've said to you twice already i'll say a third time today if you somehow were asleep at the switch when i said it the first two times that if you are unconverted then the bible says your natural mind is enmity against god it can never believe god it won't it can never agree with him it has to die that old nature has to die that if you don't get a new birth then you will hunt around you'll leave the message and you'll hunt all over the world until you find the version of the gospel that you want to be true and you'll stick with that when there's a teacher who'll tell you this is the one but when you're born again that stuff's barnyard nonsense you can't even touch it you gotta have eagle food after that see so you know the the the big building and money grabbing uh ministry that's not the idolatry that's just a consequence like brother m said lying cheating gambling adultery he said that's not sin that's just a consequence it's an attribute it's a byproduct of unbelief you're not born again you're not converted so that's why you do those things see and so so we find that the that in the same way the big building schemes and money grabbing ministry that's not the idolatry the idolatry is in their heart just like lot's wife just like lot's wife she she fled i mean she packed up and fled her cosmopolitan city she believed the message she believed those messengers it's gonna the world's coming to an end and she ran for it with her husband she left that city we left all of her social standing and and her fashionable lifestyle and yet she perished uh still for looking with a longing to go back see so she came out with lot but the problem was she had all she left sodom but sodom wasn't really the problem she had already allowed satan to build a metropolis in her heart in her heart so so what did she left a city but it was in her heart this this this metropolis was in her heart and it was everything to her so much so that she turned with longing eyes knowing it was doomed knowing the sentence of god was upon it and she longed to go back there you're talking about madness and people when you when you stay unconverted when you have not allowed when you have not allowed the lord god to come in and change your heart and make you into a new creation in christ jesus you might walk away from the bar rooms but you'll still long for them you might walk you might walk away ladies you might walk away from your britches you'll long for them still you you men you might you might you might walk away from beer and walk away from fast living and walk away from lusting but i'll tell you something if that metropolis is still in your heart you'll look right back longing to go there you might be too afraid to go there but eventually it's going to be your undoing satan knows how to get you he plays the long game he's not worried that you come into church and get all excited and get all enthused he's not worried that you he doesn't care how religious you are he doesn't care he's not afraid of the fact that some of you have been born and raised in this message you think he's afraid of that he wasn't even afraid of jesus he doesn't care how religious you are he doesn't care even how right you are in your doctrine what he's trying to prevent is your heart to be changed he knows it that if you can if you miss that life you won't come up anyway and that's what he's trying to keep you from i just say today this age calls for champions how many champions are in the building today to say i will not go down with this burning ship i'm going to take the way with christ i'm going to run to calvary i'm going to put my arms around the cross hallelujah oh my how about we all acknowledge we're in a fight today how about we all acknowledge how about we all acknowledge that we're all in this thing together oh what a contrast to this age you gotta you gotta a dying world headed to death and you and and and you got a living bride headed to life i'd say that's a pretty big contrast oh my humanity humanity going all in on laodicea and a bride coming all out i'm all out how many with me i'm all out i'm all out i don't i don't care for this world's vain riches because i know it's a siren song it leads to a it's a death trap it's a death trap you can't change yourself it's so pointless to even all you're doing is fighting an uphill battle you'll finally tire out and tumble back down the hill again anyway why don't you just surrender your life and to say lord jesus today i've heard all i got to hear i came to church and i heard a rational look at the revelation chapter 10 and maybe today i see it in a different light maybe today i see my error maybe today i understand a little more why i have never had the kind of overcoming power that i see in the bible and i i hear of the promises of god and i i see what they did in the book of acts and i want that kind of life and today i've heard about how i can get it today are you here today as that person in this building today to say that's the life that i want that's the life that i crave that's the life that i'm willing to stake everything upon today see we know that we're not looking i'm gonna i'm gonna close here in just a few minutes we know that we're not looking for another revival as as i mean we always want revival but i'm talking about a revival to the age the last revival has happened the opening of the seals for the gentiles but there is another revival but it's to israel not to you and me there is another one coming but that's to israel under moses and elijah we'll be gone and we we showed you that that because grace is grace is the encampment of the redeemed once the gentile bride once the queen leaves to heaven then grace is taken from the earth it left with her see and so for the gentiles there's no more grace and there's no more mercy and yet brother branham said they'll they'll keep coming to church they'll they'll keep coming to the altar they'll keep repenting thinking they're getting saved say well who in the world that's a ton of audacity who does william branham all he's doing is teaching the scriptures that's why he that's filthy will be filthy still and we find that that that's why friends that that god comes down into our lives and and sometimes we we we have to find ourselves in a spot where god is just not going to accept any more excuses amen he's not going to accept any more excuses he's going to call you and say now i i've waited long enough and you're going to surrender or else and that's the love of god amen see you say the judgments of god remember remember remember the bible judgments of god on his children are not penalty it's impossible because brother brown says and i have it on on the slide we'll get to it next time brother brown says at calvary god made me pay for all my sins in him he suffered the penalty so judgments that come upon our lives as children of god are not a penalty they're sent to invoke repentance the only time you don't find that changed until revelation 17 and tribulation when judgments are coming and now it's not to invoke repentance because nobody can repent mercy's over you understand it's not coming for repentance then it's coming for penalty it's coming for judgment right now god comes down into our lives and and and sometimes we we go under the severity of the loving hand of god and i'm here to tell you friends just remember it's there for repentance and you might be here today and you might be just smelling pretty and right as rain and all the world is good and everything's coming up roses and so i don't really feel the need uh to make all these changes you're talking about i'm pretty happy with my life in sin i'm pretty happy with my carnality no you won't be you won't be if you're a child of god you mark it down now that brother jason told you on this date in history you won't be because he's not going to lose even one and he will do whatever he's got to do by any means necessary you say you shouldn't threaten that is not a threat when i say that to myself i say thank god he'll do whatever is necessary what if i get out of line he'll use any means he doesn't matter and i just say yes lord yes lord pour it on lord don't let me stray don't let me stray if i can't if i don't got the strength to overcome it then you knock me down do what you got to do but i want to be pleasing that's that sounds crazy but that's my love for almighty god that's my love for his life that's my love i don't want to be wrong and and and sometimes i'm weak but i know that when i'm weak he's strong there's ever there's many people in here today i'd say the better part of this congregation even even some teenagers in here today and probably every old person in here uh older than a teenager quits could stand to their feet and say that's the truth i learned that the hard way a few times and there's even teenagers in here who ain't hardly old enough for nothing and they've already found that out the hard way that god's not going to lose his family and he'll do whatever he's got to do now do i got any witnesses do i got any witnesses look at all those hands look at them everywhere young and old alike we have found that to be true oh my everything you have needed for a rapture is in you now oh wow we were rejoicing wednesday brother matt brought that out everything that was needed for a body change was in the beast right then hallelujah because he was built with certain characteristics to to live outside of the barn oh i've got to live outside the barn i don't want the delicacies the world's going to suffer atomic annihilation because of the delicacies of the roman church and i don't want nothing to do with that oh i just say almighty god strengthen my life today let me be a real champion we got champions here today friends oh let's stand up all over the building we've got champions here today say i'm gonna i'm a champion i want the lord to notice me i'm a believer in his word oh come anthony bring your team and let's let's sing and praise the lord what an hour what a day that we live in friends think of the privilege that god has given us think of the privilege that you are enjoying today
