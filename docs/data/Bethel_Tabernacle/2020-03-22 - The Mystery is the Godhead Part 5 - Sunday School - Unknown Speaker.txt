school for the few that are here let's stand and pray gracious father we just come to you now Lord and that we ask that your spirit would be with us Lord here in the service and those who are streaming live now may your hand be upon each one Lord may the spirit of Revelation Lord come forth upon your people Lord that they would know you in the power of your resurrection Lord in this hour that were dark hour that we're living in Lord speak to our hearts may the truth be told and may hearts be ready to receive it father write your word within us by revelation Lord not by knowledge but by an intimate or relationship with you personally we ask these things in Jesus name Amen we are going to continue on our subject of the mystery of the Godhead this is part five and we are going to continue on there's a lot of different aspects you'll notice that the subtitle has changed before it was why the Trinity is false we're still kind of dealing with that but we're examining Trinitarian terms and misinterpreted verses and we'll spend some time and look at that and we'll look and see what even scholars today are finding out as they study deeper into the history and understanding of the scriptures that they're actually going back and create correcting some of the past false interpretations because of Trinitarian doctrine so we thank the Lord for his truth it's been revealed to us in this day I pray that continuing on the subject of the Godhead wouldn't be something that's boring if you'd want me to just move on or something like that I hope not but it's going to be a long-term study we're gonna continue probably a few more on looking at why the Trinity is false but then we have some topics like the attributes of God and then looking closer at to what the message teaches about the Godhead of course we've been looking at that through that time but then you know sometimes when you look at a topic in response to another topic that's false you don't get the full picture and so we want to eventually we'll move beyond this topic of responding to Trinitarian doctrine and go deeper into what the scripture actually says and how it actually defines it that's the problem sometimes when you approach a subject that's like an argument between two parties the one party responding to another party he's always going to be shaped by what the other party says just like just like today our news media sets what the topic is and the government has no choice but to respond to what the media is saying because there's an outcry from everyone it's on social media it's on the media and so forth well we don't want to just follow the devil's agenda we want to set follow God's agenda God's truth and so we might we might be responding to the false Trinity doctrine now but we want to move out move on from that into looking at okay what is this what is the scripture really teach so we're doing that now but we want to do it in a little different fashion as we move forward we've we've read this the last few services Galatians chapter 3 verse 20 in the King James it says now a mediator is not a mediator of one but God is one in the amplified version it says now a go but go between intermediary has to do with and implies more than one party there can be no mediator with just one person yet God is only one person and we'll skip the last part of that there Dodd is only one person this is a this is a Bible interpretation put together by Trinitarians and in it they have to admit that the Bible itself says God is only one person about they reinterpret that and and and look at it from this angle from that angle and now no longer means God is one person it means God is three persons but yet the Bible itself explains itself God is one person a verse very frequently referred to in the times that I've spoken with Trinitarians is Genesis 1:26 and 27 and we'll read that and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth so God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them so when we look at this verse the first thing a Trinitarian says what this speaks of at least two persons there's got to be multiple persons in the Godhead and then they'll take you to the term Elohim Elohim in Hebrew is a plural term for God it can either be translated as God or depending on the context or it can be translated as gods anytime you have the team at the end of a word in Hebrew it speaks of a plurality so Trinitarian say this means there's more than one person in the Godhead however it the Jewish people never understood this verse this way there's absolutely no evidence in fact over and over and over again to the tune of tens of thousands of times when the word Elohim is used in the Old Testament it's it's used in conjunction with a singular personal pronoun so if that's the case this plural what what is the plural plural of persons it's never taught in the Old Testament Trinitarians admit that over and over again the Trinity is not taught explicitly in the Old Testament so what is it what is it speaking of let us make man in our own image Elohim you know it's speaking every every Jewish scholar and today now Trinitarian scholars admit Elohim simply means the plural of Majesty it means it means that we're talking about the greatest most powerful it's trying to say this is the highest God there's no one but there's no gods above this God you know the children of Israel made a calf here's here's an example of misinterpreting misinterpreted theology the children of Israel made a calf how many calves did they make one and what what did the interpreter say these this well the this is what the scripture itself says this is your Elohim that brought you out of Egypt what do the interpreters say in that verse in the Exodus these be thy God's how can these be thy gods when there's only one calf they don't understand this is your God is what what they're saying that brought you out of Egypt a bull well it's the plural of Majesty there's one God and he's he's he's the highest God but let's look at this let us make man in our image I'm not gonna try to go into a teaching on this of what how we understand how I understand it I'm simply gonna leave you this is what important Trinitarian theologians write Gordon Wenham he writes Christians have traditionally seen Genesis 1:26 as wow this is a fancy word Adam Brading foreshadowing the Trinity it is not universally admitted that this was not the plural meant to the original of author in other words what is he saying this the original author of Genesis well who's the original author of Genesis God that God inspired it he did not intend to say that there's multiple person in the Godhead he did not intend to say that there's a Trinity from this verse I want you to see what the NIV Study Bible contains on this note us our our God speaks as the creator King announcing his crowning work to the members of his heavenly Court and then they offer multiple verses throughout the scriptures that bear record to God speaking in plural to his heavenly court and so I again I'm not trying to go into my doctrine about this verse or our doctrine about this verse and the message I'm simply saying this is what important scholars are saying today is that this verse has nothing to do with multiple persons in the Godhead John one and one this is probably the main verse that caused Greek scholars in the early church to come to this conclusion that there's two persons there's a second person each that is eternal in the Godhead a misinterpretation of John 1 verse 1 in the beginning was the word that's Greek logos and the Word was with God and the Word was God they took this verse and they said this is speaking of a second co ternal person with God that's what the Nicene Creed is saying so the word and God are two different persons is what they're saying so if we take this this is a little slightly confusing but if we take this and put on top of it their interpretation Trinitarian interpretation this is what we arrive at in the beginning was the son som the son of God and the son was with the Father but then the last part it says the Word was God so and the word the son was the father what it doesn't work it doesn't make it is there's no there's no logic behind interpreting this as a second person in the Godhead co-equal and coeternal with God if signifies one person and God signifies another person then how can the word be God the word would have to not be God but the scripture says the Word was God so now we shouldn't we should see it a little bit in a different light so they say the the word is eternal even even to the Farsi translations today in other translations says and in eternity was the word that's how they interpret that verse but the word in greek is NRK there's no no possibility of saying any that are K means eternity our K means beginning always it's always translated as beginning it is never translated as eternal so even they will he'll be guilty of adding to the word putting in the Bible a word that's not even there a complete false interpretation it says in the beginning was the word that begs the question what about before the beginning there's two parts to the logos when we look at it really there's the thought the intent the plan right and then there's the expression which is the action the work the manifestation so there's two parts two logos it's the inner part and then it's the outward part and if we look at this this is how the early church understood it before the development that led to the Nicene council to make two co-equal persons in the Godhead proverbs 8 22 and 23 now some in the early church took logos and wisdom from the Old Testament and they separated those out they said the logos is Jesus Christ and the wisdom is the Holy Spirit I don't believe you can arrive at that the reason why they do that is because in proverbs 8 it refers to the the wisdom in the female with female pronouns now if you've been if you've been around the message for a while the light belt should be going hot so we have the logos and wisdom they're the same they're the same one is Christ one is his bride Ephesians chapter 1 tells us that God has chosen us the bride in Christ before the foundation of the world so lady wisdom was there in Christ not as this not as another person but in him so this is from the ESV proverbs 8 22 and 23 the Lord possessed me at the beginning of his work the first of his acts of old so the Lord possessed me literally the Lord entered in and dwelt within wisdom ages ago I was set up the word set up there means to be poured out so he was he was poured out from something so in other words he was in something and then he was poured out from that the logos was at the further ages ago I was set up at the first the word means concealed at the first so in other words he was concealed and then poured out before the beginning of the creation so we have eternity wisdom the logos was in God as a thought a plan a purpose and an intent but then just prior to creation the logos went out of God and it became the very expression the body theophany of God it says the Lord possessed me God entered into this it said this is me manifested to the world early church fathers spoke of this as well and I'm I'm Way too tight here up here and even that's cut off but this is dr te pollard a theologian and also do you still gonzales who's a church historian right like Hippolyte Hippolyta's Tertullian starts from the idea of god solitariness before the creation of the world before all things God was alone because there was nothing external to him yet God was not alone for he had reason within him the ratio the reason which is his logos and by God's simple will the logos springs forth sound familiar this is the teaching of Tertullian in the early church Bernard loss and other historian writes IRA næss Bishop of Lyons and his doctrine of God first spoke of God's inner being and second of his progressive self disclosure in the history of salvation IRA næss was of the same opinion as the apologist of the ancient church especially Theophilus of Antioch that when he taught that God has with with him from all eternity his word and his wisdom God brought them forth from himself before the creation again it was with God it was in God as a thought as a plan then it went out of God as his self revelation his self-expression this is what they taught before Nicaea and and the development up there it didn't just arrive at Nicaea and instantly they had a new doctrine no they went from this and they this true understanding and they developed something further that the church previously didn't believe here's what brother Branham said in Hebrews sermon as we had it the other night God in the beginning was spirit and then from God went out the logos for the theophany which was a form of a man called the son of God prefigured so I'm just gonna stop there for a minute this is what the Trinitarians have taken and perverted they developed a new understanding of John one and one and the result was that now you have two gods now of course they reject that terminology but let's call a duck a duck we don't need to call a duck some kind of strange winged creature that flies over water and swims is is he a duck is he a fish let's reinterpret this for a little while a duck is a duck and though you say you don't believe into two or three gods when you make a second co-equal Co eternal person you're making a second God and in fact honest theologians in the early church literally said that said it was a second God Justin Martyr who didn't believe in a co-equal Co eternal person still because of false interpretation part of the development away from the truth called Jesus the logos a second God the fact is the logos is simply God expressing himself first it's in God and then it goes out of God when it goes out of God now it's with God but it doesn't become less than God it God is a spirit right he's invisible you can't see him well now God becomes invisible well that logos is it really God sure absolutely it is and yet it's an expression of him it's it's it's with him it's two but not two persons that's why it's with him it's God in his body you are three but one person body soul and spirit and so these things with the spirit of Revelation are simple but without a spirit of Revelation an exulting reason that's what Greeks did they exalted reason Jews exalted revelation they wanted it revealed they wanted a prophet to come and make the truth known to them they prayed for that they waited for that true ones false ones they set up their own interpreter they set up their own denomination and when God came to interpret the word they said that's not God that's the devil and what do Greeks do they turn around and do it even worse they make completely nonsense philosophy exalt reason above revealed truth now we're going to use reason to understand revealed truth instead of using what God has provided which is the scriptures and the Spirit of God prayer waiting on the Lord now it's politics philosophy reason death that's really what the ultimate reality that came forth from that Hebrews 1:1 through three start this and we'll probably finish when we're done with these verses God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the father's by the prophets hath in these last days spoken to us by his son whom he has appointed heir of all things by whom also he has made the world's who being the brightness of his glory and the Express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high so when we look at Trinitarian terminology they're using these terms persons and they're using the term essence three persons in one essence now can we arrive there from Scripture the word that we talked about before that they use for persons not exactly the word persons in Greek but it's very similar it means it's who post a cease and so they say three who post a cease in one lucia does the scripture speak of three distinct who post a cease anywhere in one essence so we saw that see in that scripture it says who's the being the brightness of his glory and the Express image of his person is who post a cease so Jesus is the Express image that word literally means the exact imprint like a coin you you want to make an imprint on a coin of a of the Emperor of the president you you make you make an original which is based on what what he really what what the president looks like now you make an original and then you stamp the coin so you have the original which is the stamp itself and then you have the metal which is shaped now that you make the stamp now that stamp is exactly or that coin is an exact representation of what the stamp is so the Son of God the visible manifestation of God is the exact imprint of God's who post a cease so who post a see speaks of a foundational nature or essence so Christ is the perfect expression of the invisible God's nature or essence he's the exact imprint he's when you see Jesus said when use when you see me you see the father amen so it isn't to hypo States who post a cease between father and son there's one who post a cease and there's one expression of that hoop of Stacey's not to God is invisible he has an eight he has a nature he has an essence God is made visible is there another nature in essence is there a second nature is there two natures between God and Christ no when we're talking about humanity humanity and and spirit God who is a spirit and and a man yes in that sense there's two natures but is the fundamental nature of who Jesus is as a man what he expresses what is he what does he express is he like us he sometimes expresses his fleshly side and sometimes Express there's one nature that's God's very nature expressed completely through Jesus Christ not to some people in the message say there's two persons there's not there's not two persons in the Godhead there's one God who's invisible manifested perfectly through Jesus Christ who is the visible expression of him who is invisible all right second Corinthians 4:6 for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face piroso pone of Jesus Christ another word often means and then translated has been reinterpreted that's some of the problem that's happened with languages the Vic the person who wins a victory whatever victory that would be whether it be theological or political he starts to define language the way he wants to define the language and so the the theological Victor's which were Trinitarians begin to reshape the meaning of language but prosopon does not mean person there is a word for person in Greek it's persona but preso pone means something different means the front towards the view it would be similar to image only it has a different connotation prosopon speaks of the mask so in a in a drama in those days when someone was playing a part he didn't just play the part and look where his normal face he actually wore a mask sometimes you play multiple parts within that within that particular drama and so he played those multiple parts change the mask it's the same person behind that it's the same persona behind that but the pro so pone is different so got the glory of God when you hear the glory of God what do you what are you here the Shekinah the supernatural light the logos that which is emanating from God making him visible is revealed in the pro so pone of Jesus Christ so the glory of God took on God Himself took another mask to play another act in his drama so what Jesus is not a second person what is he he's the very he's the mask that God entered in and played hid that role in the plan of redemption again all these things they get redefined they get changed reinterpreted but when you look at the scripture itself look at the history itself you'll understand something completely different if you read and we'll read further to about some things that Tertullian said said the same thing you use the same terminology there's three Pro soap bones and one person three masks one person again well with we have a lot more to cover we'll continue on but let's let's stand up and pray before we dismiss sunday-school father we thank you so much for your goodness your mercy to us Lord that the eyes of our understanding are opened up Lord I pray father that this could be used Lord for people to share this message with those have not heard yet Lord increase our burden for that take this word Lord and make it become a revelation to people's heart we want your word we want their true revelation and understanding of your reality and we want that reality to be expressed through us Lord the same reality that was in Jesus Christ to be in us and manifested through us lord help us to raise higher in our faith and in our walk with you Father we commit ourselves to you we ask you bless the worship and the preaching of the word today may it come forth with power into people's homes and lives we ask in Jesus Christ's name Amen god bless you
