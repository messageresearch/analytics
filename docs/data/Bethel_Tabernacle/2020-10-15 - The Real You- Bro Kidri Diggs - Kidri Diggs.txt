turn order the service of concerning this coming sunday and this is for if you all those online before our whole assembly we want to have something we've had upon our heart here just for the last little bit uh with our fellowship hall and i know that uh that's real important to our church and it's been uh quite depressing not to have it and not to be able to fellowship so we want to do a uh a fellowship hall just a little differently than how we've been doing it we are going to have a fellowship just casual nothing structured nothing formal just like we do after every sunday afternoon before covent we want to have it but we're going to do it outside the weather be praying but the weather right now looks pretty decent hopefully it gets just a couple more degrees drop and it's going to be should be in the low 6 low 70s for sunday evening and so the fellowship poll will be off limits uh except to authorized personnel that's brother charles and my wife who's going to agree to do coffee and so uh so they're gonna do it's not gonna be uh you know if you wanna bring some food or you wanna bring that or snacks or whatever you wanna do feel free to we're gonna buy two bonfire pits and set them up out here right outside the pavilion brother john has agreed he's going to come and play his guitar and any other musicians who want to bring instruments maybe just have some fellowship amen would that be nice amen i know it would be i know everyone enjoy that so that'll be this sunday um probably you know being that you can't get into the fellowship hall we're not going to set a time but just if maybe after you go and eat lunch come back yeah i don't know what time that would be sometime after you eat your lunch want to come back if you want to come back and bring your food uh you know something you want to go get and have it right here these picnic tables everything outdoor is um is totally fine nothing off limits at all masks are not going to be required it's outside you know as always someone wants to wear masks they're welcome to but outside nothing we have no rules no nothing so you are welcome to come amen and i hope that you do i know we plan on being there and i've heard from a lot of people they want to they plan on being there amen they love the lord amen i don't have any other announcements why don't we invite brother diggs amen to come at this time how great is our god sing with me [Music] is [Music] me amen praise the lord and we serve a great god tonight amen that's about his amen lord jesus father here we are again in the house of worship lord and just to know that these walls are walls of clay but the real house of worship is within us lord from our hearts lord and our souls lord and father we pray lord that the worship continues lord through the preaching of the gospel lord that we just continue to pull on the gift that's given before the foundation of the world lord we pray to bless each and every hear as they hear lord give the spirit of understanding lord god and just help us not to just be hear us but be doers also of the word lord continue to bless this church not even be with all those or that may be streaming lord

lord to just be a vessel lord we thank you for all things in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen [Music] so it's good to be here we certainly appreciate brother jason amen we pray all as well with him amen sister watkins hallelujah it's good to see you good to see everybody amen let's just um take our bibles let's turn to um hebrews the 11th chapter hebrews 11 praise god hebrews 11. hebrews 11 let's start reading that verse 24. hebrews 11 and 24. let's start at 23. amen the bible says he was 11 and 23 the bible says by faith moses when he was born was his three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment and by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter choosing whether to suffer affliction with the people of god then to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward let's go to saint john the sixth chapter saint john 6 and let's start at verse 64. it says but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and who should betray him and he said therefore said and he said therefore said i unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father from that time many of him many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him then said jesus unto the twelve will ye also go away then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go thou has the words of eternal life and when and we believe and are sure that thou art the christ the son of the living god jesus answered them have not i chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil and you read the lord and bless you is where you can have your seats amen by the grace of god i want to use for a subject tonight the real you amen the real you you know and and and if i could just start this way we know uh because of our christian journey that this flesh is not who we really are amen this flesh is just it's this flesh is here to connect with us earth hallelujah but there's a part of you as you go on your journey that remains to be revealed but one thing i wanna i wanna uh deal with tonight if we can just catch it you know if you look at the scriptures right here it says listen to jesus talking to all these people and he says but there are some of you that believe not see jesus you know he let people gather among believers you know the bible says let the two be grown together let the two raise up together and he said when that time come he's gonna separate them amen but you know you and i it's not our job to find out who is who our job is to live what we believe hallelujah but you know we spend so much time being distracted by the unbeliever being revealed right we are not to be distracted by that because jesus already knows who believes and who doesn't as long as you are sure who you are that's what counts amen but you know he said you know that that and you know the thing about the scripture when you watch jesus talk and even the prophet said jesus would throw things out there just to thin down the crowd he'd say things just so the real people can come out and show themselves hallelujah he'd say things that would be a stumbling block to some and be a blessing to others amen even our prophet did the same thing you know we got things on record where he said 737 000 but you know he wanted to go back and correct it and god said leave it alone why did god say leave it alone because he knew there was going to be some intellectuals in the midst of this simple bride that would take something like that that doesn't mean the hillary beings like you ain't never made a mistake i ain't never made a mistake we all have made mistakes but that doesn't change who we are all right the mistake does not change hunger the embedding of the seed that god put inside of you before the foundation of the world yeah amen what we do we see people make mistakes and all these things and then we start wavering and you know what i love about god god will let the superstars in your wreath fall he'll let those people uh that you respect those people that you put on a pedestal seem and look like they're crazy so you could worship him and him only amen but you know when we look at becoming the real you and and even in in matthew uh 24 let's go there right quick matthew 24. matthew 24 and verse 24. this is what the bible says he says are you with me amen hallelujah he says for there shall arise false christs and false prophets it shall show great signs and wonders if so much that if it were possible look if it were possible let's not change the scripture he didn't say it was possible he said if it were possible hallelujah that they shall deceive the very elect now listen church god let unbelievers walk right among believers and do signs and wonders heal the sick raise the dead even preach the message of the hour amen but the supernatural does [Music] just another prophet he was walking with god himself yes and that didn't change who he was he wasn't feasting on just a partial revelation he was fishing on thus said the lord he was under ministry without mistake and he still couldn't turn amen he was under ministry that knew no wrong and done no wrong and he still couldn't be converted amen amen see when it's time for the real you to come out you gonna blossom you're gonna blossom me no matter what your surroundings are it don't matter how long you've been in the world whatever the case might be when your time comes you will blossom whether it be a good tree bringing forth good fruit because you know what my bible says a good tree can't break for a bad fruit [Music] neither can an evil tree bring forth good fruit that tree breathes forth of the life within honor think about it let's look at judas for a second can you imagine honey look at it you talk about a hypocrite sure can you imagine walking with the church being something that you're not walking with the church hallelujah seeing people receive grace and mercy and all these things knowing hallelujah that you don't believe it hey man that was judas now remember my topic my thought the real you hungry church no matter how how much he would have wanted to believe he couldn't because the real him was an unbeliever and it doesn't matter hallelujah how many quotes you got how many scriptures you got if you're not ordained before the foundation of the world with the life of christ what is the life of christ zoe god's very own life inside of you it don't matter how long you've been in church 30 years later the real you will come out amen amen i just want to let you know right now we're in a time where you can't hide right and god has allowed these kind of things to take place the pandemic and so forth so the real you can come out some people are staying home and they're saying because we went mass at church i ain't coming that's the real them right it ain't the mask that made them feel that way no that's who they really are when people turn around on god and they point their finger at mattel brother chisholm or brother jason with the ministry no you ain't mad at me it's just the real you coming out hallelujah so curtis every life breaks forth of his own kind the scripture says whose seed is in his head so we have to think twice when we have certain actions and we do certain things all right hallelujah what are we projecting are we protecting christ are we rejecting something else amen because you can only hungry bring forth the life that's within you and if this pandemic has stopped you from coming to church if jesus was in front of you you steal amen amen you know what people say all the time brother man oh boy if i was in jesus dead man we'll be in revival we're in jesus day right now and what you're doing now is what you'll be doing if jesus was standing right in front of you preaching because we preached by the same spirit amen hallelujah he said oh if i was his dead i have more love no you wouldn't cause you got to realize yeah those same spirits were back then why do we think paul had to take chapters on preaching about love amen because there were people back then who could love so if you get love right now don't tell me if you were back then you would do it those scriptures was written about that spirit yeah right and that same spirit is still moving upon the earth just like back then there are scriptures of faith if you're operating now on those scriptures of faith you'll be back there operating the little scriptures of faith time does not change we're changed by what we believe we're changing hallelujah by what we receive you know look at the scripture you know i just want i just want to hit some things some things that keep me on my knees listen to this the bible says in first peter first peter uh chapter four listen it says and if the righteous scares me be saved you me us who consider ourselves to have the holy ghost serving the lord the bible says if we scarcely be saved amen amen he says where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear for those people who take things in his bible and put it aside and say well i love god you know my heart if the righteous barely make it in how you people amen amen how are the ones who don't have that consecration how are the ones who don't have that dedication how are the ones who can't accept the word for what it is gonna make it easy how are the ones who can take different things in the bible and take it out holiday and consider themselves serving god making him according to the scripture it says the righteous scarcely make it in yeah amen god allows these things to make sure listen to me to make sure we are in desperation look if certain things have to happen to put you in desperation you're you're a step behind amen you should already be in desperation this hour is calling for you to be desperate because you don't want to get caught down here you don't want to be left down here because we all got things in our lives that we're praying about we all got shortcomings we all got things that we're not happy about but do you sell them come on with those things in your life yes amen hallelujah let's look at the real you for a second look the bible says by faith moses he refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter right how did moses get to that place well let's backtrack look pharaoh sent out a degree that he gonna kill all the young babies right talk to me church he's gonna kill all the young male babies all right so anytime y'all know i love preaching about pressure i love pictures about trials and tribulations because we think sometimes because we bribe we're supposed to go through nothing right we think sometimes because we know the seals are opening we know uh the church ages and we we know the mysteries of god that they're still not a perfecting for us they're still perfecting amen amen hallelujah and if you want to be like god you're going to be tried until you get out of here amen but i want to look at my child how god looks at him oh yeah and god looks at him as a blessing god puts certain things in our lives to make us stronger god puts certain things our lives so our eyes can come open hallelujah god put certain things in our lives so you can get rid of the stuffiness the dryness the anger and all these other things that's hindering our walk [Music] that's good so god put pressure on you what is he doing he's trying to bring out the real you listen church without cold days that tree will never grow amen that tree needs a cold dry season a season where it looks like there is no life looks like it has nothing to give looks like it's all alone looks like it's bad but it needs that to bring forth life [Music] and in that time when that tree looks like it's struggling the roots are going deeper amen right that's why the bible says count it all joy when you're tempted no count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations holy amen because the bible says with every temptation he's made a way of escape amen so god will let you fall into things that he know you can get out of it so you can call for mercy then god comes and shows you mercy so the next time you ever get into something you know that there is a way out hallelujah god has two twins sitting there by his side waiting to be dispatched for our lives those twins are named grace and mercy [Music] and with every trial god sees those twins by our way to give us grace and mercy amen thank you but we go through and we say lord why me don't you want to be real amen amen for something to be real it has to go through a trial and era oh yeah right sure like i said every vehicle i did in the parking lot on that side of the side they had to go through a crash test your field can be your vehicle can be 30 thousand dollars more than mine but it still had to be wrecked yeah right before it even was used it had to be wrecked before the passengers ever got inside it had to be wrecked hallelujah but what god did but look at what they did what they did was when they wrecked it they put a dummy inside of them amen something that resembles you something that looks like you something that has your same weight class to some of you young people hallelujah to my daughters some of you to your children we've already been your crash dummies yeah come on so you will know hallelujah what not to get into hey man let's look josephine and amaram they hear that the king wants to kill their son now do some pressure everybody else look at all the other sisters grabbing their babies taking them babies just throwing them in the river i don't want to die i can have another child later just throwing me everybody picking up babies throwing them in the river joshua said not me i ain't throwing my talent remember i'm saying i don't blame you we're going to believe god we're going to believe god and we're going to stand fast they say well what about what about the decree you know they're going to come check every house she said i'm going to believe god yes what do you do hallelujah when you get to a situation hallelujah when you got to either believe or you got to turn around and this situation arose they were more than just israelites you know what they were they were parents of a deliverer right in this situation made the real film come out and in that moment hallelujah they began to operate in a supernatural channel because of the pressure and listen let me tell you something if you ever get inspired most of the time is scriptural ain't that right amen if you get inspired right right but you watch amram and joseph bed getting inspired she said okay i'm gonna take my baby and i'm gonna put him in an ark look at her she tapped into the inspiration of noah her struggle her challenge her tribulation her trial hallelujah put her in a position where she could tap into the word but she can tap into the supernatural that god did before her date holiday what do you do what is your point of reference when you go through a trial amen look at it she caught the instagram remember that messed up preacher catching the inspiration she got the inspiration hallelujah that our art is deliverance so she put a baby in the ark and she pissed it within and without and sitting down the knowledge but god so rich in mercy oh god so good in grace he let that he let that that baby go down now and what i love about god he's always working on both ends earlier right hallelujah she told she told miriam you're gonna follow the child and see where he end up now miriam is on the sideline tiptoe going down the river watching her brother and then she's looking at her brother going to the enemy's camp amen you think god is aware when we go into the enemy's camp he still has his hands of protection on us and i'll tell you something even better he's controlling your enemy oh yeah all right amen this is the turf the devil ain't now he's doing whatever he wants he has restrictions right that's right amen and i don't know about you when it comes to me my family anything i own that's already signed on it that says no trespass so he can't get to me unless it's okay with god he can't get to my children unless it's okay with god so if they fall it was okay with god if i fall it was okay with god preaching brother that's right so you have to believe and know who you are if anything happens to you it's for the betterment of who you are it's for the strength of your journey but elijah was oh god why'd you let this happen so the real you can come out right see if there's no pressure a lot of times we'll just stay relaxed we'll just become cool be in church dead as can be nice and quiet but you you come here every time there's a service but what do you do when you're here come on come on hey man there you go are you receiving right are you receiving to live by or are you just here because it's a duty amen we're talking about the real you tonight what's making you come to church is it because hallelujah you don't want brother jason to look at you differently because you may skip a service or two is it because you were raised in this church is it because you just ain't got nothing else to do on a wednesday night come on or do you come hallelujah with the intent to hear from god do you come with the intent to have fellowship tell me who the real you are oh amen tell me what's your purpose amen because look if you come here and don't have a purpose those words you're hearing cannot hold you that's right amen it has to be a change on the inside it has to be something worth living for hallelujah it has to be something you're hungering after hey man i don't know about y'all but i stay hungry i'm ready to eat right now stay home and i ain't like some of y'all most people that come to church they own a diet we got 30-minute diets 45-minute diets music too loud diet music too fast diet on right got all these kind of diets brother won't be still dying can't you stay behind the pulpit diet all these kind of restrictions on the meal right all these kind of restrictions on the girls hallelujah you know hallelujah if there's no challenge there is no change a lot of times god will do things to challenge what you believe [Music] moses is in it moses in the boat he's he's he's he's he's in the ark he's going down harley he winds up right there pharaoh's daughter but look when you read the scripture when she went to the ark she went through the bassinet or whatever you want to call it when she got there she opened it up she was no dummy she looked at the baby what she said this is a hebrew child yeah right and you know what she was supposed to do she was supposed to grab moses and take them on yeah [Music] [Applause] [Music] right in his territory but because god had a purpose he could not drown me he could not kill me hallelujah all right some of us at one point or another we ran right into the devil's hands [Music] amen can you imagine it she should've grabbed moses and just took him under wouldn't have been nothing nobody's been able to do yeah right miriam what was she gonna do she would just sit there and watch her brother die joseph and amram was at the house probably praying oh whoa lord protect my child right lord he in your hands father god i don't know where his journey is going but he in your hands maybe sometimes you ain't supposed to be there you're supposed to be praying yeah man amen amen hey listen in a time when it looked like there should have been no more moses his life was just beginning amen seemed like he was from under all the protection he needed and he was down here with the enemy but the enemy was going to protect him yeah amen same thing he's smarter than god amen god let us go right holly listen to me real good god let most of us be raised up with shock shock that we respected there was some shock and even witness to us look when she should have killed moses the bible said she had compassion oh glory to god my god is good see church even though she was an egyptian in that moment the real hair came out what was she she was a woman that wanted a child amen god know what he doing amen why didn't he sing why didn't he send the baby to pharaoh's daughter hands me no it went straight to pharaoh's daughter because the handmaid wouldn't have the compassion that she would have had amen so now look at her church she runs up to to pharaoh's daughters hey you want me to go get one hebrew mothers come on what are the chances that she can go find a woman that just had a baby or go find a woman that's willing to nurse the child yeah amen what are the chances see she had to be connected some kind of way so she goes and say okay i'll go get one of the hebrew mothers i'll go get one of them for you to go nurse she said yes my child go through that and she said i'm gonna get my momma gonna get my momma let me ask you something when you dedicate your life to god what is satan going to do with the gods you serve [Music] he's always looking out for you when you think things are going wrong it's going just right [Music] amen all god is trying to do is break out the real you now look at she gave up moses only to get him back but this time she's grateful because look because she was willing to be vulnerable with god and give up the child god later raised her child better than she could yeah instead of now maybe in one of the israelites in hebrew 10th she's raising that same child in the palace amen well everyone would have to go out and hunt all day now she has food coming to her out of the kitchen amen but she would have to wait till they killed something and then it together so they can have clothes now the clothes were coming to them in packages oh yeah all right look at god church we underestimate how good we got it's right think about how you living right now think about how you living right now anybody blessed amen at least thought everybody was gonna say man think about it if you didn't know the god like you know now would you be living this good could the job you may have had using the world take care of you like it's taking care of you now come on it's only the grace of god and people looking back at the world talking about i'm coming back you better get them doors and slams and on the other side of the door is a sign up that says no entry amen what about you right do you have days when you think about what you used to be holding when i was in the world just i was in the world those thoughts shouldn't make you smile yeah right shouldn't make you smile what you are now should make you smile amen but listen church now joseph man is raising her son in the palace he got the best clothes the best food the best teaching everything and look church if she would have been obedient to her heart look at the real her coming out if she would have been obedient to her heart look she like most of us parents honor she getting paid to raise her child that's right boy you just don't know how much your mama wish she was getting erasure god man but look because she gave him up she got him back with benefits see it profits you to be real with yourself hallelujah amen hallelujah let me read something to you i could be to as long as y'all know about clothes listen he says he says and then after a while you heard the gospel can i get amen amen maybe you went to church you picked out this and that and went from denomination to denomination but one day you being a part of god that's what this is all about right that's why you could no longer be a baptist or a methodist or a pentecostal because one day you heard the real gospel and that gospel is god and you being a part of god something begins to rise up in you what was it when you heard this message what was it it was connecting with the real you [Applause] amen that's why you and i some of you are much older but some of you are older than me honestly some of you were in the day of the problem in 1965. you know what i've never seen them i was never at the church i never even been to jeffersonville so why am i connected to this message yeah come on amen because you being a part of god you had to be a part of the word and when you heard the word you hallelujah known where you come from hallelujah i don't come from jeffersonville i don't come from south carolina i come from the mind of god so what does this message do this message brings the real you out that's why people leave because the real them won't the world [Music] you tell me where is there any fault in god amen no this he says that when you heard the word you knew where you come from you knew what was what was the truth you were always the seed was in you always the word listen what happened church when we came in contact with this message of the hour when we came in contact with the revelation for our day this is what the prophet of god said he says hallelujah the word sings the word the reason why i can follow it because i am what it is the reason why you can follow it because you are what it is you are a part of the scriptures that's why people can't follow it because they can't see themselves being a part of god that's why judas didn't go to the upper room because he could see himself with the holy ghost the word seen the word and that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you he said then you come to it the reason why we're here because we heard what we are and we come to it this message was my magnet you know the magnet is you just walk by they go have it on the wall somewhere you just walk by just suck it in that's what happened to us church hallelujah we were minding our own business and we heard one day and next thing you know it ain't even making no sound it's just a magnetic pull hallelujah you didn't have to stream you'd have to shout it was a pull y'all keep this up somebody's gonna be holding my mule man just in case you understand what i'm saying there was a man named shouting john who was out in the field and he was plowing one day he had his mule and he was in the field plowing and the deacons came up to him and told him say john you got to stop shouting in the church they told john john you're distracting the young people you making them think that church is emotional you're making them think that we just get happy when we come to church john we need you to stop dancing and shouting in the church john said look at here deacons listen here brother deacons you see all that land over there god gave me that land he said you see all those crops god gave me those crops he said you see that house god gave me that house you see that family i got god gave me that family hold my meal i don't need no church i shout right here right in your face hallelujah i know some of y'all can't believe it i'm shouting in church but i am worship dancing is a part of god oh brothers i'm just quiet by nature you still holding on to that you're gonna be messed up when we make it to heaven and everybody around you shouting you to my i'm quiet by nature yeah i know jesus is here but i'm just quiet by nature i know i can never die i got eternal life but i'm just quiet by nature i know i can never get sick again i'm just quiet by nature i know i can never have high blood pressure again i'm just quiet by nature i can never get tired again i'm just quiet by nature if that's how you feel i feel sorry for you because that kind of thinking won't be in heaven [Music] oh i'm gonna see you shot one way or another i'm gonna see if you plan on being in heaven i'll walk right up to you i'm gonna say i knew you had it in you i do you had come on i knew you had it in you i told y'all about that rumor that rumor's still going around i think that rumor still going around and only black people shout that's a rumor y'all don't believe that rumor do you that's one of the biggest lies the devil ever told amen that's had an experience with god they can't help but do wrong you know sometimes i'm riding down the road in my car and i just started thinking about what god did for me and i just yeah i just had to lift my hands yeah for the grace of god as a large and worthy of all the prayers church moses was raised up in a house where he could have anything he'd ever want amen and his mama was there and brother branham said his mama would always remind him that there was something special about him while she's raising him and he's getting all the teachings of of the egyptians and all these great things to be a mighty military man and all these things she'll come to him and say son you know you don't need all that all you need to do is trust in jehovah wow remember hallelujah when moses met ramsey i believe was ramses when he came back he says who is god i'm god see they didn't even know of them they didn't even know about god but moses hallelujah is getting their teaching and his mother's teaching and her teaching one day is going to overpower everything else that they taught him in egypt why because that's who he really was he was connected with the teachings of his mom and what was that the teachings of jehovah catholic doctrine but when we came into the light of the truth the truth overpowered everything else that we known we were raised in the world and all these things but holiness hallelujah overrode everything else that we've ever known righteousness overruled everything else we've ever known what was it it was the real you coming out let's look at the scene before we close the bible says in exodus the second chapter exit is 2. x is 2 and 40. it says x is 2 and 10 i'm sorry it says in the town grew talk about moses now and the child grew and she brought him up to pharaoh's daughter and he became her son and she called his name moses and she said because i drew him out of the water and it came to pass in those days when moses was grown now he ain't a child no more right he said when moses was grown look that he went out into his brethren and looked on their burdens and he spotted an egyptian how did he know he was a brother to the slaves amen moses was grown then he went out unto his brothers and looked on their burns why was he burning for the slaves it was the real hymn coming out he couldn't be connected with the egyptians because he wasn't an egyptian even though he had no reason whatsoever to dislike an egyptian all right amen from the day of his birth the egyptians were good to him yeah amen let's go back to it he probably was eating chipotle grass fed he was eating good uh-huh he wasn't eating all this steroids pumped up no he's eating grass feed very healthy he had the best you drinking well water thinking real good he would usually probably sometimes just keep back relax and drink some real wine not just colorize stuff that people drink now to get high but he was you know moses as an egyptian he lived good so what reason did he have to ever dislike the egyptian yeah can you explain it you can't explain pharaoh's daughter had compassion on him and she raised him like her own son and you know what i love about the movie the 10 commandments hallelujah when they get to the spot when moses is gone and i believe a cleopatra whoever she was she comes in and she's talking to pharaoh and he's all sad and she said there's only one name that can bring him joy it's the name of moses if you feel like that's a little early i get that out the message because the prophet said he liked that movie also he said it was the closest thing to the scripture and she said she said there's only one name that can ring in his ear there's only one name that can make him smile it's the name of moses so as far as being an egyptian he had no reason to have any hate towards them they were nothing but good church look at it he was next in line to take the throne so why wasn't he being identified he was being identified now with the real hymn [Music] the scripture says now he's grown hallelujah hallelujah he says that he look he let me back up he says most was grown then he went out until his brother and then looked looked on that bird he looked on that bird he was supposed to be over them he was supposed to be whipping them and and making them work but he got burdened because of that burden where is it coming from yeah he's connected wow he's connected when they heard he hurt hallelujah where's that coming from that's not an egyptian cycle coming out of him right he's he's being reminded hallelujah on the inside of his birthplace he's coming out of his spiritual amnesia pharaoh he didn't know pharaoh's uh daughter didn't know how nobody knew moses now on the inside he got a war going on because he's been raised as an egyptian but he didn't fell in love with the slaves amen well what is it it's the life of the seed okay now let's flip over to hebrews 11. let me finish that let me finish that scripture right there give me the next part brother to that scripture it says that he looked this way in that way and when he saw that there was no man he flew an egyptian and hit him in the sand how could moses have so much hate towards the people that raised him throws the people that did nothing but good for him yeah he's going the complete opposite hebrews 11. see when the real you begins to come forward nothing can stop it [Music] it doesn't matter where you come from it doesn't matter where you are now it doesn't matter how somebody treated you when the real you start to come forth it will connect with your purpose it will connect with your destiny it will connect with what god saw hallelujah before the foundation of the world glory amen listen hebrews 11 and 23 it says by faith moses when he was born he was here three months of the parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandments by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter why when she did nothing but good sure right think about that parents you didn't raise your child you gave them everything you can have and now that child turns around and walks away from you wouldn't that hurt you moses did that what was it the real him was coming out he was connecting hallelujah with his predestination you see the power of the seed yes amen are you with me church you see the power of what god put inside of you honey you may was in the bar you may was in the club you may was living a ratchet life but when that seed connected with his purpose the bar couldn't stop it the internet couldn't stop it pornography can't stop it depression can't stop it cancer can't stop it aids can't stop it the pandemic won't stop it amen listen he says he refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction why would this man want to choose to suffer we didn't have to yeah he had everything of egypt at his fingertips he's turning down that life you know what that sounds you know what that sounds like sounds like brian material to me some of us have had this world at our fingertips good jobs and all these good things that the world has to offer but we choose rather to suffer affliction amen with the people of god then you enjoy the pleasures of sin forces and look what moses did moses went and grabbed that egyptian popped his neck buried him in the sand and ran for his life what was happening he was awakening he's on the run but now he's awakened right he's no longer in the palace trying to be something he's not right but now he's on the run i wonder how many of us they got tired of the palace we rather go out here and rough it to see god moving our lives moses he left all that he went on the run but look all that stuff he felt what was happening the real hymn was coming out amen because of that pressure of killing the egyptian running on his life he met his wife [Music] hallelujah amen and all of this was a process to wake up the real moses you know moses hallelujah he had a temple he popped a man net for no reason so he met a woman whose temple was just as worse than he is god know what he's doing god led him right to a woman that can calm him down so god can use him see he's getting awakened all over again then he isolated and put him on the back side of the desert so god can talk to him put him alone hallelujah so god could talk to him and made him hallelujah made him sensitive to the spirit so he could hear a voice coming out of a bush glory amen amen he would have never heard that in egypt amen but now god put him in a atmosphere he wouldn't question my head no did you notice he didn't walk up to the bus and say what is this ain't no bush supposed to be speaking ain't no bush supposed to be on fire not consumed but this place moses in now he was able to experience the supernatural and become one with it and now he goes back to godhood god comes down god hears the cry of his people he comes to moses moses i've chose you to be this first thing moses said lord i can't talk you see what that woman did to him she calmed him all the way down he was the egyptian you tell me shut up sit down i'm the king i have to shout do what i say a couple years with his apartment he was done oh going to god lord i can't die she worked on them in such a way that the testimony of moses the bible says there'll never be a man more meekly moses you may say what am i going why am i going through this maybe god is trying to calm you down come on maybe he's trying to pull some things out of you that's been buried inside but he want to get to the real you look church god can call you he can choose you knowing that there are mistakes to be made inside of you right i'm running out of time think about it church god chose david knowing he was going to commit adultery knowing he was going to pre-meditate murder knowing he was going to try to be sneaky and get out of it and listen that god's testimony about david he's a man after my very own heart he was a man of god's very own heart with those things inside of him but wasn't gonna do god let him fall so he can wake him up and you notice once david failed he was so angry when nothing came to him you told the man had 500 wives why do you have to have one more right god was going to use that experience to bring out the real david why i love reading about david one of my one of my favorite characters in the scripture that's my brother hallelujah because david doesn't present a life of all glory and triumph and no growth every victory david had he worked for him natural and spiritual he worked for it listen church david go seek bathsheba hallelujah you know what when nathan came to him and told my david david they say she knew i was up there i'd go there every day the same time every hour she did that on purpose why didn't she do like why didn't he do like saul he was the people because the real david was coming out just like saul a real saul was coming out a man that couldn't obey god amen but look at david and his point listen i want you to realize these moments are moments when we meet god yes this was david's moment to meet god and listen what he did hallelujah once nathan showed him all the stuff he did david was so mad david said i'm gonna kill him where is that i'm gonna kill him ain't never going back to his church he must be surprising that what we do and then said david that man issue why didn't they say but i'm the king he didn't do that the scripture said david repented right see that was the real david even though he was a king he had a heart to make things right with god that's why god chose him [Music] and as i'm coming down look the real you should do like david did when you're caught up amen look at what he did he repented and from there he received the twins in his life grace and mercy and from that point church you never heard about david doing anything like that again because when you truly repent hallelujah that spirit leaves your life that's why people are going around in circles because they haven't repented once you repent give it to god it be gone amen why he chose not to to be identified and choose to suffer affliction and all these things when you meet your awakening what is it is you meeting god the real you coming out you look at god or let you look like you're on a pathway or right and you're really on the pathway of wrong remember saul saul was going out there persecuting the church he thought he was right and what happened he met god amen and when he met god the real paul came out changed his name from saul to paul it goes like that in all the scriptures i mean you take jacob jacob was tricking people he was tricked his daddy tricked his brothers had his mama a part of his father went down to treat his father-in-law with the cows and all these things he trick trick trick trick but now he's getting to a place where god want to wake him up huddle god want to show him who he really is he went down there he got four women fighting over him i want his baby i don't want his baby no i want his baby no i'm having a baby y'all know that right he had four different women see these spirits these spirits ain't uh ain't uh nothing new man we're folding from baby mamas every seed starts in genesis right that's right but now he got to a place to where he couldn't he couldn't trick his way out of normal he got to go back because he upset his father-in-law he's leaving boy leaving esau coming holly and that trial holly forced him to do what fallen on his knees and the real jacob came out a man that would fight for god's presence a man that would fight her to be blessed by god he said lord i ain't gonna turn you loose until you bless me and when god blessed him god changed his walk wow not on his walk but god changed his name amen changed his whole identity then the real him came out he was no longer a shy stuff but now he's a prince come on music let me close church we may look around and it may look like some people that you know were here and going and all these things don't let none of that stuff stumble you come on don't don't don't look just imagine we on 95 we got somewhere to go this is not a time in day to be a rubber this is not the time to be a rubber necker slowing down because somebody else got an accident look if you ain't gonna stop and help keep on pushing because you're gonna slow the person up who got some way to go [Music] you ain't gonna stop and help no rubber neck wondering what's happening wait did they call you that'd be the problem people people getting accidents put the whole church on breaks everybody no this ain't the time to be rubbernecking let's keep pushing hey man let's keep moving we got somewhere to go the speed limit is up there for a reason if you slow down too much you're gonna cause another accident let's take the time to be slowing down we got to keep pushing amen church it's time for the real you to come out and that's what this day this time and i was doing don't be holy you better examine this a little bit more don't get caught up with these different laws that given out with the pandemic it's molding people into a certain character one of my friends told me that they was voting to have to come back to church because they were letting them come back to church and all these things and and they got to voting should they come back to church so they stay streaming they voted to stay streaming lord have mercy in the day where the bible says as we see that time approaching we ought to fellowship them all right right people feeling like they want to stay home that ain't scripture so where is that coming from where is it coming from if you have a desire to stay home where is it coming from it ain't god that's right amen god said he want us together he wants us to gather he wants to pull off each other and just because we can't stay home we're staying home church we we're not in the days of the law this is mercy come to church and experience god's yeah mercy laws say you can stay home but we're not living under the law i take my chances with god's mercy [Music] glory if he healed me before he can heal me again and you know what let's make a declaration in this church harley you can't die i can't die i can't get sick you can't get sick unless god allows it look here you can't get nothing unless you chose it you got to be chosen by god that anything happened to you because remember the devil was going to and fro trying to get to somebody and god said amen he got a hedge around him don't even think about it see you got to be chosen and some of you don't even realize it god will choose you just to shut the devil up amen hallelujah church espresso it's time for the real you to come out and with situation this atmosphere we have in the world today it's time for real believers to come out you know what you're gonna do if our president get four more years [Music] right here man this is my own personal opinion when i hear a man say those people those ku klux klan they're good people [Music] i don't know about that one but there's all kind of things that's gonna rise you out to show who you really are and we're gonna be looking at you like what really that's who they are but i ain't gonna stop i'm gonna keep on pressing you do you do according to however you're being led but i want to be led by god i want to find myself i don't want to be one of those ones who bury what god gave me but know if he gave me two i want to bring back two more he gave me one i want to bring back one more hallelujah but he gave me five there's an ability in me to bring back five whatever god gave you you're supposed to bring back interest off that amen amen let's pray keep playing lord jesus follow me thank you for your word we pray with something sad to help your people lord and we don't want it to seem like we're fussing but lord if we can just look at how you allow certain things to happen lord it is only to strip off our spiritual amnesia like moses lord he had no reason to feel the way he felt to the egyptians because they were good to him what was it was the seed inside coming to life and he couldn't see himself being identified with that when he was a hebrew lord and the real him began to come out and begin to be identified with the affliction and persecution and all those things why because you made him a deliverer so for there to be deliverance they have to be bondage and moses saw the bondage which which brought forth the real hymn deliverance lord we thank you for this church thank you for the pastor lord the people the atmosphere lord we pray that you just continue to move in our lives like only you could in jesus christ's name we pray thank you the church amen [Music] is he's got it all in control say it again i put my life i put my life in his head yes lord i put my life in his head so every road i walk down i'm sure it's in his plan i put my life in his hand sing it again now my father knows my father knows what i need yes you do lord my father knows what i need and everything i go through he knows what's best for me my father knows he's got it all in control oh he's got it all in control yes lord he's got it all in control he put that reassurance way down in my soul [Music] he's got it all in control [Music] amen do you appreciate the word tonight my i certainly did bro diggs i was just right with you the whole time so good amen that's just exactly i'll just testify thank you lord that's exactly what i needed to hear tonight amen appreciate brother diggs for surrendering he always does just uh and brother diggs always it just and my memory it's just every time we have brother diggs it's always there's something that's said that it's just such a confirmation that was from the holy spirit for me amen so i certainly appreciate that i thought of so many examples um that that that brother diggs used and then your mind just starts going the real you you know brother digs i thought about one man in the bible and i've i've shared this before who the bible uh tells a story in mark i think it's chapter five where a man named legion remember that story and and i i think it's amazing because i i just was hearing brother dick's preached tonight and i thought you know you look at moses you look at jacob you look at david look at all these examples he gave there's always an example of who you really are and who you really aren't and you know and sometimes it's amazing because we can see you know whether it's a loved one a family member a child maybe even our own selves and we can go down paths in our own life and sometimes we got to remind ourselves this ain't really me amen you get you get tripped up in something something you shouldn't be in the lord just reminds you hey that's not who you are i thought about legion because you know the bible talks about how that jesus goes on the other side and there comes a man and if you if you read mark chapter 5 when jesus speaks to him and he says what what is thou to do with us you know that wasn't the man and the holy spirit told me i was reading mark five one time and i and i preached this and i said you know a lot of times you take a loved one who's maybe addicted to some drugs or maybe has some addiction in their life you take some situation and you got to be so careful that you don't confuse the spirit with that person and you gotta never get that mixed up because if you go read that story of legion he says what is your name and then this not the man but the spirit speaks and says my name is legion which legion just meant a roman army was meant a vast uh meant a lot of people two or three thousand people and so jesus says what is there what is your name and he says my name is legion that's that wasn't his name that wasn't the real him the real him was not an alcoholic it wasn't a he wasn't addicted to drugs he wasn't a man in the tomb that was a if you go read and brother brandon picks up the story he's a husband he had a wife at home had children at home and he was a father that was the real him he was a real son of god it wasn't the spirit and don't ever let no matter what situation you go through this is what spoke to me brother dave no matter what you see in your family your loved one don't ever let the devil tell you that that's them that's not them that's the spirit they're under and you say lord let the real film that seed of god that's down inside of them amen let them surrender to that when legion was free the bible says he comes back to himself he comes back into uh comes back to his family and there's his mother and and he says that all the children and mother gets scared and he says no no and and brother traumatized he says daddy's different now and brother adam said see what made the difference he had been with jesus and brother branham said you take any daddy any mommy any son he said let him get with jesus amen the real you will come out amen praise the lord thank you brother diggs for that we have some prayer requests we want a prayer request we want to look at we're going to just take up here let me just get them here pulled up brother tony sent this in says please pray for my
