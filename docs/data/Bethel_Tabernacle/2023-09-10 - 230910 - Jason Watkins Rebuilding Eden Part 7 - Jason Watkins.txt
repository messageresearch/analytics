accumulates when you're on a plane and someone's scared because there's turbulence then you start getting scared that another person gets scared well the same opposite's true in church when you have faith to reach out and grab a hold of the promise it'll give somebody else faith when you say Hallelujah to the word of God it gives somebody else Faith to say I can I can reach out and break Beyond

Lord this morning happy to have you here amen with us by the time you're still hanging out amen praise the Lord with his word he's going to go back home today and I told my wife I said man he's going back home in just the most where the best weather's starting to weave its way in uh feel a little warm this morning but it gets pretty Millennial around here brother so amen we uh we we love that Finders Keepers losers weepers things so we were hanging we'll hang on to you amen I'll send a note to brother Donnie no worries he's he's a pile he amen praise the Lord praise the Lord a man says Kate amen amen praise the Lord Julia amen amen all right there you go Misty it's a unanimous it's unanimous amen praise the Lord God bless you we want to look today I want to continue by the grace of God in my series on rebuilding Eden this will be part seven and man I thought that it might be the last but it looks like I won't be able to get to everything today and that seems to be by design of the Holy Spirit that's not just me deciding that amen so um we want to read from Luke 17 and then we will let you be seated starting at verse 20 and we're going to read down through 27 a little lengthy but we'll go quickly Luke 17 verse 20. and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation well that that blew their minds that's not the answer they were expecting neither shall they say Lo here or low there for behold now here's why the kingdom of God is within you see so Jesus was introducing a whole different concept from what Israel had thought the kingdom of God would be brother Branham shows how that they were expecting at any day Messiah to come and he would be a great War General and he would you know come on the scene and he would rally an army of Israel and he would route the Romans and and brother Brandon said what they wanted was a great General and what God sent him was a baby and brother Brown says I love how brother Ram says that he said God did that to humiliate amen praise the Lord I'll tell you if it if it requires my humiliation to make me a believer in the Lord pour it on is that your desire today friends oh we don't want to hide behind anything I want to say pass me not old Gentle Savior amen we want the Lord to you know I I the Bible talks about how that you know people come in they hear the word of God and then they go out and straight away they forget what manner of man or person that the word showed them they were they said it's like looking in a mirror and and when you do the word shows you the real you and then they go right out and forget it just it goes right out of their mind what the word had shown them about themselves and they never make any changes and I just say Lord don't let that be me I I want to be ex I want me exposed to me I don't want to be wrong I don't want to be have have something the the Lord has against me I want to know a man that I am that on that day I can hear him say Well done amen praise the Lord let's finish our reading verse 22. now notice here's he's going to make a make a change here he's gonna just finally he gives the Pharisees an answer that they can't comprehend and he doesn't explain it he turns to his church he turns to his disciples he turns to his family and he starts to explain it more deeply and he said unto his disciples the days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man you shall not see it and they shall say to you see hear or see there go not after them nor follow them for as the lightning that lightness out of one part under Heaven shineth unto the other part unto heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day so there's going to be an initial illumination of the ministry of the son of man that's going to begin in that was in Jesus and it's going to be it's going to transition to his church with the upper room experience right and that's going to run for a while that's the ministry of the son of man but then that church is going to backslide the disciples go off the scene and all the apostles die off and then it goes into the into Through the Ages comes up and at the end as the lightning started in the east in Jerusalem it comes back again to the full ministry of the son of man in the west at the end time the beginning of the ages the ending of the ages right all right so that's why he said you're going to desire to see one of these days but you won't because it and and that's a that's a little forecast about what's going to happen he with this and gives a lot more detail in Matthew 24 but I didn't read it on purpose today I want to stay right here all right now verse 25. or verse 24 again for as the lightning that lightneth out of the one part under Heaven shineth unto the other part unto heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man now watch the description they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage just normal life is going about their life until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drink they bought they sold see how similar it is they they eating they're drinking they're buying and selling their plant they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed in that day he which shall be upon the Housetop and and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field led him likewise not return back remember Lot's wife whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it now these are critical guidelines for us at the end time amen amen remember Lot's wife he's talking he's talking about his second coming in most of this some parts of it are are you have to be very careful thankfully we have a prophet to lay it all out for us but but he's he's preaching on his second coming because the question was what about the kingdom of God when is that coming see and so his second coming is what's going to set up the kingdom of God and so one of the things he's warning you as is to look around in the age and when you see the days of Noah and lot repeating be careful remember Lot's wife don't lose sight of that at the end time remember Lot's wife all right whosoever here's another one whosoever can I say it like this whosoever in the last days particularly whosoever as it gets near the Finish Line particularly shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whoso right here at the finish line shall lose his life shall preserve it I tell you that I tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other left two men shall be in the field and the one taken be taken in the other left and they now watch this is curious and they answered and said unto him where Lord now that's strange instead of wind they're asking him where and he said unto them wheresoever the body is thither will the Eagles be gathered together so what's going to bring the kingdom the body word and the Eagles will gather around it because the before the kingdom comes on Earth the kingdom is within you how does that work a body word that the Eagles gather see and it's going to separate it'll separate two men and two women and two men again it separates before he separates you physically from the Earth in a Rapture he's separating you from the world while you're here right at the Finish Line he finishes that all right we're rebuilding Eden got me let's pray father we thank you for your word this morning I thank you for these divinely revealed truths Lord that come to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers Lord if it weren't for that we would we would as the Bible says we James said we even even we would be all together like an under Sodom and Gomorrah Lord we would have no way to know we'd be victims of the blindness that's upon the age just like everyone else but I'm glad Lord that you uh uh you you you impose an injunction against your own judgment you're the only one who could do that Lord that's why it was an angel Who Rose from the East with the Seal of the Living God it was very clear Lord It's the holy spirit because he's the only one who can give the seal and he imposed a temporary stay of execution to give himself time to seal away his Gentile bride and to seal away his his his hundred and forty four thousand so father we're in that little interval of time now where we realize you are doing this finishing work work and your bride you are separating her from man-made ideology separating her from the social status and structure of the world you're separating her Lord from everything of the world and you're drawing her aside unto yourself Lord that she could be a holy a chaste virgin a bride a queen fit to stand by the side of the king Lord I pray today that you'll be our helper as we look into the word in these things in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated so I am you just keep me in prayer the devil sure has fought this sermon this morning tried every possible way with technical difficulties to um amen calls it to not be as effective as it could as it could be but I'm grateful to the Lord as I just began to pray and Lord begin to Prevail and I'm just trusting in his in his wisdom right now even the order that I want to go I'm I'm just before him so you just be praying for me will you do it amen amen when we think about the rebuilding of Eden we have said to you in previous installments how that the first thing that he would need to do in the rebuilding of Eden would be to rebuild Adam and Eve who had fell by sin in the garden who had lost the Consciousness that they had ever had that kind of relationship who had you know brother Branham when he's when he's talking about the threefold about the singular uh goal that God had in the back part of his mind which was expression that was his one goal in all the Bible but that how that he would unfold his one goal in three phases that first he would he would restore the first Adam see because remember that when he restores first he's got to he's got to uh come and be the full manifestation of all the upon of all the prophets and Priests and kings and so he's got to First fully restore and show Christ he's got to return back to where the Son of God because that's what the Bible says Adam was Bible doesn't even call Adam a Son of God it calls him the son of God so that that whole image of the Son of God has first got to be re-established and he lived that out and brother I'm sitting in all the lives of all those Old Testament people that's what he's doing and he's living out the you you remember that I'm saying to I've said it here before her brother and I were just discussing it recently how that brother Brandon would say Jesus Christ is in every verse of the Bible now that's a strange statement because I can read verses I can't see him really I can read how you know I can read about murder and I can read about adultery and I can read about incestual relationships and I can read about heinous deeds and worshiping you know of false gods and I I can't reconcile that with Jesus but yet I've got a prophet saying he's in every verse and if you don't see it you missed it go back and read it again so I did that and I still didn't see it and this was years ago the Lord helped me with this and I went back and I read those passages again and I still I said Lord I can't see you and you know I can see David taking another man's wife and having her husband murdered and I I can see Israel worshiping false gods and I can even your servants are making mistakes and even Aaron is building a calf while Moses is in horrib and and he he's at Sinai and he's building a calf and that children of Israel are worshiping false gods I can see I can see all of these heinous deeds and acts of God's family and I said Lord I just can't see Christ there and the Holy Spirit just said what did a prophet say and I said well the prophet said read it again he said or read it again so I read it again and again and I finally I said Lord I can't see because the Lord said why can't you see it and I said because I can't see that that you did any of these things and the Lord's and the Holy Spirit spoke right to my just a very young man and he said that's correct I didn't but you have done them and my family has been guilty of them and I took your sin upon me so yes you can read me into every verse and every line whether it was a great Victory or whether it was God rich and mercy redeeming his family who brother Brandon said he would not he's God and he will not be defeated I'm so glad and so once he re-establishes Adam in the life of Jesus now the ministry of the Son of God is reestablished in the earth now part now now we can get back to bringing the kingdom because that's what Adam and Eve were going to do originally be fruitful and multiply and brother Brandon we've been uh the brothers here we've been going through spoken word as Original Seed and brother Branham is making that so clear Christ was the child Eve would have had had she waited see it the Adam and Eve were the beginning of a whole Kingdom a whole Kingdom of Sons and Daughters of God but they fell and so now God's got to re bring it back and so the first thing he's got to do is get Adam re-established then he's got to get even brother Branham said now that's the second phase of his ministry to have preeminence over his church his body right so that comes in the upper room the Holy Ghost comes and now the ministry of the son of man is now working in the bride she's carrying on that's why brother Branham said it's a continuation he was the beginning of that of the creation of God and you are the continuation of that same creation man so so these things are Elementary to us and so so we realize that she is carrying on in his stead we we talked about it last time you see it in the in the ministry of Melchizedek you see because that's the scripture that two two places where brother Branham constantly went more than any other place and one is the woman at the well and the other is Abraham sitting in a tent and Melchizedek with his back discerns the heart of Sarah and the prophet went there almost more other than perhaps Hebrews 13 8 he went to those scriptures more than almost any other scripture combined and and because it's showing that the ministry of the son of man is now working in the in the body because that's his second phase first to re-establish Christ and and bring forth the image of the Lamb of God second to gain preeminence in his body the church and third to now what are we doing restore the kingdom can I say it rebuild Eden restore the kingdom back to its rightly position I know your lives are wrong now I know you've made mistakes but all wrongs are gonna be made right thank God Hallelujah there's nothing that follows me into that new world I have a body that's never failed I'll have a mind that's never been on pure Hallelujah nothing hangs on me going there thank God thank God thank God oh my think of it friends think of it today sometimes we we loathe our past failures think of a body that's never failed think of a mind that's never had a wrong thought oh think of a there that that that that that body that I'm gonna give it's never been envious it's never been jealous it's never hated it's never failed to forgive it's never lusted it's never been been weary it's never it's never been a failure oh my God so he's rebuilding Eden he's rebuilding Adam and Eve he's so that he can bring forth the kingdom of God so they're asking him they're not the only ones the church wanted to know the Pharisees that representing the nominal churches we have that today they just don't call them Pharisees and Sadducees they call them Catholic and methodists and Presbyterian Lutheran and Baptist and UPC and all these other things brother Branham he said you shouldn't you shouldn't be so Politically Incorrect I'm sorry let me clean it up brother Branham called it names of blasphemy so if we're going to be politically incorrect let's just go all the way their names of blasphemy see brother that's what the Book of Revelation calls them names of blasphemy brother Branham called him in his Kentucky English Blasphemous names see it's blasphemy to to to to to say you know the Church of God as a denomination that's blasphemy to the Holy Ghost because the Church of God is not a denomination the Church of Christ is not a denomination I defy that lie Pentecost is not a denomination that's a lie of the devil it's a living breathing experience that you need an I need and we not only need it once I need it many times I need fillings and refillings and refillings why because I'm growing I'm growing I'm growing so he's it requires it's it's now leading to the complete restoration of the kingdom of Christ and you are invited today to be a part of that that's what's at stake yeah that's what's up the choice is yours that's what's up the kingdom is being restored what's at stake your Eternal destination to either be a part of that Kingdom let me tell you something friends there's no as brother Jack Duff says so poetically you're never going to hear the voice in Revelation 4 that says come up unless you first hear the voice of Revelation 18 that says come out you're going to have to come out if you want to come up see and so you're never going to inherit that Kingdom without a new birth and without not not in the position of the Bride Anyway by no means I understand that the granting of eternal life to the foolish virgin but boy don't ever get those confused with the nominal uh debauchery you see these days that is so the church so-called the foolish virgin are first of all righteous people second of all they're saved that's probably first they're saved they're not they're not born again that's redeemed born again is redemption and that's further than salvation but they have trusted in Christ for real and there God has has granted them the work of the Holy Spirit upon their life has forgiven all of their sins and has Sanctified them and that's why they're they're called righteous in Matthew 25 and they're called Saints in the Book of Revelation and Saint means Sanctified one see so don't don't get those confused when we think about lot and his DOT wife and daughters his wife and daughters don't represent the foolish virgin they represent the nominal Church his wife got destroyed and and he said well his daughter survived only for a while only to complete God's word because there had to come a moabite a woman named Ruth who came out of Moab and became the wife of of Boaz who would bring forth Jesse who would bring forth David who would bring forth Christ and when God was done with that the moabites in the ammonites were all assimilated by conquering Nations and they no longer exist as a culture anywhere in the world you understand so so so you you you've got to keep all that straight so so that's what's at stake it's high stakes decisions you know what when we're when we're preaching on this subject I I would say to you today that what I'm preaching on and have been preaching on in this series uh is is high stakes Ministry and and not to not to mean that the what I'm preaching is is is so high but what it's implying and what it's identifying that you're living in I mean it should it should be capturing your laser focus because we're at the finish line and this is the whole ball of wax this is all or none see you you're not going to be able to go into the Rapture if you're if you're not if your life is refusing to say Amen to every word of God now I understand we fail I get that that's no problem that don't even count there is no more condemnation to them which are in Christ you can't be indicted for your mistakes and failures the the Perpetual atoning blood the voice of Christ constantly speaking and Satan can't even get into the courtroom to accuse you because the The Blood Brother Branham said Christ died for me and the blood speaks for me and God can't see my sin hallelujah we're not talking about your failures past present or future the things that you are sorry and you repent over we're talking about the willful Disobedience to the word that God sent in this hour and if you are not willing to line up every aspect of your life to the message that William Branham brought you will miss the rapture there is no chance for you to go unless your whole life is willing to say Amen now the application of it we stumble and fall don't worry that's fine you're going to get you get credit for his life on that but you can't be in Defiance you can't say I'm just I just think that was William branham's opinion and I just don't think I have to do that you're going to be left behind now hey Bethel Tabernacle in 28 almost 29 years have you ever caught me in a lie I've never lied to you I'm telling you parents children teenagers young people old people married people single people the people who go in a Rapture are people who say Amen to every word and whether I can apply it successfully that's on God I already know I can't that's just on the Holy Spirit to get me there amen and he hasn't uh amazing imaginative ways of of getting you there he won't do it against your will he just has ways of changing your will but listen friends it's high stakes because we're talking about your Eternal destination and being a part of the first resurrection so while the world is going through a time of cataclysmic tribulation you can be safe in glory it's not like I'm offering you a bad deal I'm offering you the best deal that's ever been offered to people who are the most unworthy say why am I so unworthy because you're a human born in sin see you're the you're the offender the animal world didn't offend God humans did yeah see so so we realize that the life ahead of you know we have a life that's ahead of us friends that defies all attempts to describe it It's So Glorious and I as I've said to you before brother Branham when he came back from Beyond the curtain of time he had little trouble telling us what he saw described it in in panoramic detail he had no trouble telling us what he heard but what he couldn't describe was how he felt and he said if you just if you believe me to be a prophet he said you just believe this that just beyond this last breath just beyond this Veil is a world you can't even begin you have no idea he said I can't even describe it I don't even have the words to describe it so the stakes be higher amen so maybe maybe you will love me more for taking seven and probably eight maybe nine and ten parts getting us home even if it steps on some toes will you love me even more I'm trying to get us home Hallelujah ah true I could almost speak in tongues my goodness wow get it wrong steaks are so high to get it wrong will cost you everything you if you try to go in at 99 you'll fail and lose all the 99 you achieved this is all or none you're either in or you're out you're either there's no brother Brandon said there's no black white bird or no white black bird it's it's you're in or you're out you're a Believer or you're not Stakes couldn't be higher see so how sure you know I I mean brother Jason how are you how how are how are you so convinced you know you know how how are you to be how am I let me let me speak for you how how are we gonna be sure to make the same choice to make the same choice to make the right choice the same choice that God's family has made down Through the Ages see because if you're if you're uncertain of what is right then there's no way to be certain what's wrong all right so don't imagine God would have left us in the large like that he has sent us what is right and if you and if you have a a problem with what is right you're never going to be able to avoid what's wrong and when he comes if you're found in the wrong you miss everything you lose everything Jesus said if they knew when when the master would return they they would have not got caught unawares don't get caught unawares we're at the Finish Line it's going home time so you forgive me won't you please if I seemed to drive home so strongly this warning that I keep coming to every time I come into this Pulpit on this series and I keep warning us that we must not compromise with the impersonation of Christianity amen so don't don't don't don't think of it as beating a dead horse the stakes are too high see a true and a full experience of the Holy Ghost in the in what we would call the new birth versus the what brother Branham would call living in varying degrees of sanctification is so close those two things are so close see and I'm talking about the real fire breathing experience of the Holy Ghost versus living in varying degrees of sanctification those are both the work of the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost in justification it's the Holy Ghost in sanctification but that's a that's the that's a millennial leap from being born again and the difference is the born-again go in the first resurrection all who are who just stop at varying degrees of Sanctified life and believe in believing God sent a prophet camp out with the foolish virgin in the tribulation Jesus said to her so close it would deceive the elected if it was possible you say wait a minute I thought that's I thought that's the nominal Church what that's not going to fool any Christian good grief the the Tommy rot like the nonsense I showed that's not going to fool us the Asbury Revival is not going to fool me I I I'm not doubting their sincerity but I still see women in jeans and cutting their hair I still see men smoking drinking and cussing it's not going to trick me there's no chance that's not close what is so close that it would deceive the very elected is that fine line between believing what God has done in this day and allowing sanctification to come into your life but never coming to the full surrender say how do I get there you got to repent which means you got to say Amen to every word there's no accepted repentance outside of that so the stakes are high friends so don't feel bad at me if I'm in my seventh part still drilling this trying to trying to get it into the church see because varying degrees of sanctification I mean brother Branham said it'll it'll make you clean up your life it'll make you start going to church it'll make you stop your lying and stop your cheating and and you'll even say oh I believe the message brother Brandon says that right on tape he says you know he says remember Satan believes and brother Branham says he doesn't make believe he actually believes but he's not born again because he knowing the will of God knowing the word of God he refuses to do it see but he certainly believes that the Apostle said you believe in God you do well so does the devil it'll make you start going to church it'll make you it'll make you a believer of what God has done in this day and brother Brandon would say you say oh brother Branham I believe it he says but I'm asking you will you do it because it's hearing recognizing and acting on the word of God I'm not going to be guilty friends I'm not going to stand there on that day I'm sorry I'm not willing to stand there on that day and with a broken heart that any of you missed it because I didn't tell you I already know I have passed from Death to life I'm already sealed in the Kingdom I'm already in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I'm not worried about my destination but I want to make sure you get to go with me Hallelujah so I'm never going to stop preaching and pleading and praying I'm never I might have to preach I might I'm on part seven today I might need 107 but I gotta get this to where the nail clinch is we are believers and that calls for a very distinct separation from the world there's no marginalizing there's no there's no gray areas of it I mean you're either a Believer or you're not a believer because as I said brother Branham talks about that sanctification will make you clean up your life it'll make you stop lying and cheating it'll you'll start going to church and you'll even agree with 99 of the word for your life so can you see why the Holy Spirit keeps bringing me back to it again and again and again I promise you I'm not short on material I got files and files of stuff I want to preach on but I don't get to choose that so I think that I dealt with the impersonation of Christianity very sufficiently some Wednesday nights ago so much so that I I believe it should be a Hallmark for this church for the rest of our days and one of the things that I have kept emphasizing to you is that I'm preaching to Believers this series is not a Outreach series to the Lost I'm preaching to believers see we can see according you know to Bible prophecy that as bad as the world is right now it's going to get much worse much much worse you see and and we've we've ministered before that if you can't win against the footman how are you going to handle the horsemen how are you going to run against how are you going to fight against the horse if the footman take you out come on this is your daily everyday walking around life if the simple things of laodicea keep you from having a spiritual experience with Christ you ain't even seen nothing yet it's going to get much worse than it is right now it's and we're now and and that you say are you trying to scare us maybe I don't know but we got little children in here and so I have no qualms of saying to you parents come on come on we can't afford we gotta have we want our children with us I don't want to see my children and my grandchildren cry go out into the world thinking that's okay it's not okay and all the ones who are out there I want them all back whoever Satan is holding prisoner of war I want him back Hallelujah and I will not rest until we have them back in the fall glory to God we concluded some Wednesdays ago I felt very much led to the Lord you know to Amen brother to wreck men to those uh who struggle you know with these things and then I made this recommendation to you I if you find yourself struggling with saying Amen to every word that came by a prophet then go back and reevaluate your confidence in the in the message and the messenger and go to God in prayer and say Lord make this a reality to me not just something I've been taught but I don't just want to know your your your your acts and your history I want to know your ways so we we want we might need to reevaluate our confidence in the message and the messenger God sent in these last days to teach us the word and to interpret the word of God to us for this unprecedented hour you know it's amazing if you you you would absolutely agree if I was if I was uh ministering you know to to a Muslim and you were standing there and and I would say to the Muslim that do you believe that Jesus was a true Prophet the Muslim was absolutely because the Quran speaks of Jesus in that way and so do you believe he was a true prophet of God yes well he said he is the way and the truth and the life and no man comes to God except through him now is he a true Prophet or not right so so so so so then you know when when uh when when we come to the scripture where you know it talks about how that you know let a man work out his own salvation and fear and trembling and brother Branham says that's only until the Holy Ghost comes see once the Holy Ghost comes then you got your will is gone and brother Branham talks about how that that the the word is interpreted to us that the word is of no private so do you believe William Branham was a prophet do you believe he was the Elijah that was to come just like I would say to the Muslim do you believe Jesus was a prophet well here's what he said Do You Believe William Brandon was God's Prophet for this last day well here's what he said when he went to that scripture that no scripture is of private interpretation and brother our Prophet said that's because God sends a prophet and gives you the interpretation there's no private you don't get to have your own private interpretation you don't get to water it down or make a message like we had one voice that gave us the interpretation of the word and there's nobody authorized to go behind him and vet his teachings see so we see the day approaching more and more that Paul spoke of so clearly I'm trying to watch my time very carefully amen excuse me I'm gonna have to make an adjustment here here we find that and don't don't don't follow it uh in the booth so let me just let me just quote these out because I'm going to move quickly but Paul makes the statement in second Timothy chapter three you can go home and read it verses one to four that Paul talks about the in the last days perilous times shall come see and as I've said to you before it wasn't that they didn't have perilous times in their day but you're at an unprecedented level there's never been an age like this day you're in the worst age of all it's it's went beyond even a prophet thought 1977 it went so dark nobody could survive that yet here we are and I would like to say we are surviving but in the last days perilous times would come he warned that there would come blasphemers he warned that there would be false accusers he warned that there would be despisers of those that are good so it shouldn't it shouldn't stun you that God's messenger gets attacked in this day it shouldn't stun you that the world thinks you're Politically Incorrect because this is the age where people are despisers of those that are good this is the age where false accusers come on the scene this is the age where blasphemers come what age perilous age see this is the time he goes on to show in the fourth verse that we will have traitors come on the scene so you've got you've got perilous times you've got blasphemers you've got false accusers you've got despisers of those that are good you've got traitors heading high-minded you've got lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God now that that implies that you do have a certain amount of love and affection for God that's not the issue the problem is you just don't love him as much as the world lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God here's a here's a here's a crippling one that has fallen Upon Us in this day and and why I had to make a clear Line in the Sand on the video I showed yeah because you've got those coming in the last day having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof in other words brother Branham said they're never willing to allow the Holy Ghost to come they're they're denying the life they have a form of godliness they sing songs and have churches but they don't allow the life of the word to come into their life and you can see it you can see that they're not living in the image of the Bible I'm not insulting them I'm not attacking them I'm warning you perilous times are here and these are the kind of things that that that false church is never willing to allow the Holy Spirit to come and give them a life-changing power see and and they attack they even attack the truth of those who carry it I was somebody was telling me just recently that they somebody I don't remember now the story they got witnessed to and and they seemed very receptive until they went over to our mega church and sat down with that Pastor and he told them that I was a false teacher and William Branham was a false prophet and we were a bunch of cultists my goodness if this produces a cult then thank God I'm one of them I'm so glad I can say I'm not one of them amen I'll take the life of the Bible any day it'll get me home it's my ticket home see so they attacked the truth of those who carry it it's not a it's not a new tactic by the enemy listen it's not a new tactic by the enemy to attack God's Messengers you realize from the scripture that's not novel that's not new that's first thing I tell them yeah you're you're not original you're not novel in any way don't think too highly of yourself you're simple that's been going on for 2 000 years you know and so you realize that from the scripture they they did the exact same thing to Paul it's in the Bible they did the exact same thing to John the the Apostle of love come on if you're gonna attack John what kind of monster are you is the Apostle of Love he's known throughout the land as the Apostle of Love loves everybody little children love one another if you say you love God but hates your brother you lie you've got to repent of that and yet you've got you've got people rising up writing letters and sending it to the churches they didn't have the internet so they couldn't get on YouTube and do it but they wrote letters and sent them out to other churches saying don't have anything to do with John he's a false teacher don't hear him Paul all Paul is nothing in his letters he's very bold but we met him the other day and he was a wimp he's nobody so that's that's not new they they attacked their Doctrine my goodness they attacked their their credibility they attacked the authority of the Apostles they even they even attacked their character my goodness so so you can read that in the New Testament in numerous places in church history I'm not going to get go down that rabbit hole today but you know and it is true historically factual they did public publish it and circulated it and you know my I I I I just say you know as a I I can say to you today friends thank God I look back on my life I look back as just a boy and just small five six years old and would watch preachers in the pulpit and knew someday I'm going to do that I sat in the woods as just a very young teenager 14 15 years old just like I am right now with my Bible open in my little hiding spot asking God about my life and my Ministry I have studied this this book this grand old book for years decades and decades and I've studied and I and I intentionally didn't go the way of theology you know why I didn't do that you know why there was nothing in me to go to theology school because my mom I was witnessing to my history teacher one time and uh seventh uh I don't remember what grade but anyway I I loved her she was a very kind-hearted woman she was a very good history teacher and I started witnessing to her she was a nominal Christian I started witnessing to her about the truth she seemed very interested I said can I give you a book I'm just a kid in school can I give you a book sure be happy to I go home I find one I bring it to her I remember now what it was and I I you know and I I took it to her and I was had I went to bed that night with such hopes and my goodness maybe she and when I came back you know the next day and I waited she didn't say anything as you would imagine and I waited till after class Miss player what did you think about the book and she she snared and she held up the book and she said how much education does this man have I was struck my heart she said how much theology did she was just you know disparaging him and disrespecting him this this guy is a an idiot how much theology I could never I can still remember how much Theology and she she gave me that sideways look of Victory like she had just wanted to debate silly child how much theology did he have and I I just took the book back from her and went home and I told my mom what happened and she said what you should have asked her is how much neology did he have and that stuck in my mind and I never forgot and I said Lord I don't need theology but I do need neology I need to that's where you get down on your knees before God and I'm here to tell you something friends I've studied that with this book open and the seals book opened and the church age book opened my whole life I found never a discrepancy it's it's on you you cannot resist the message if you're using the Bible it is the absolute word of God not only do I see that as a student but I see what it has done to my life and your life and all of our Lives they'll come from the East and West Hallelujah East and West to dine with the Kings who sent us his guest oh my I want to be part of that number friends it will be I can tell you this for sure that the teaching that Elijah brought us in this day of how to live our lives and conduct ourselves here at the end time it will be the measuring standard for right standing with God at the end time because he's taking us back to Saint Paul's teaching and that is incontrovertible it will absolutely be the qualifier for all who are taken off the Earth at the resurrection mark it down you know I I can't always spend the very limited and very valuable uh Pulpit time that I have preaching this kind of thought there's so much many other things to preach but I I just tell you something friend that that is just burning in my heart and I truly believe it's because it's an it's indicative of how close we are to going home and how much I still yet see in my life and your life I still see too much me I still see too much you and I'm pleading and I'm preaching as hard as I can and studying day and night I I told Brother Matt I said you want to burn burn a four-hour flight in 20 minutes start studying a sermon on the flight and we lifted off it at San Diego and we flew four hours to Atlanta and it felt like 15 or 20 minutes while I went through this sermon I'm preaching the continuation of today I don't know of anything more I could do or say that hasn't been said yet there is more to say that I know I won't get to today but I'm very grateful and I'm very grateful I want to say that I'm very grateful for the overwhelming majority uh uh in fact is it's been unanimous it's not even overwhelming majority I've had such unanimous uh statements and texts and emails and phone calls and people saying from around the world from other states from across the ocean saying brother Jason this series you're on is so vital and so rich and so exactly what what I needed in my life and I just say well brother then we're in the same boat because it's what I need in my life my my my how about you friends see I remain deeply concerned I remain deeply concerned as much as I'm glad for that I still find myself deeply concerned with the few too many because one's too many with the few too many under my care who continue to live on the edge and uh to I guess alter a common phrase one-third carnality and eat it too you know I realize that's altering the phrase but you know I as I've said before and I say again I have great concern for those kinds of people come wraps your day and I'd be dishonest if I didn't say that when the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more and that morning breaks Eternal bright and fair when the saved of Earth Shall Gather over on the other Shore and the role is Called Up Yonder I'll be there will you be there on that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall rise and the glory of his resurrection share when his Chosen One Shall Gather to their home beyond the skies and the role is Called Up Yonder will you be there Hallelujah can I have 10 more minutes maybe I I don't need it thank you but I don't need a half an hour I can I can get it if I go half an hour I'd need an hour and if I win an hour I'd need 90 minutes so let me stop in 10 to 15 minutes here I wanna I wanna make a few comments on our text that we read you know the Nazarite it's interesting because the Nazarite vows the Bible says in numbers 6 4 all the days of his separation shall he nothing that is made of the vine tree from the kernels even to the husk so when he's in a Nazarite battle and a Nazarite vow you don't have to be a Nazarite you you can anybody can do a Nazarite Val it's no set time it's however time you decide to take a vow before the Lord men can do it women can do it but don't break it if you make a vow to God you're better to not make it than make it and break it and so you know when when you talk about the Nazarite because the reason I'm bringing this up is because brother Branham said you know that's what we are in a sense we are nazarites to the word of God our failure is notwithstanding come on our failure is notwithstanding I am a Nazarite see and and that's why that every aspect of our life has to say Amen to every word I'm going to read you this little short thing that Spurgeon said about the Nazarite and I want you now to think about what I'm preaching that I'm making the statement to you that you can't just take 99 of the word for your life and lose confidence in the other one percent for your life your life needs to toe the mark with everything that came to us in this day here's what Spurgeon said concerning a Nazarite now listen close nazarites had taken among other vows one which debarred them from the use of wine all right now that's their vow you got me I'm a Nazarite I'm not going to touch wine all right good now the Lord here's what the Lord said okay I'll accept your vow how long you going to do it 30 days okay noted let the angel record it all right now I've got to say something to you if you're going to make this vow to me you can't just avoid wine that won't you'll fail Lord what about what else do I need to know all right if you take a vowel then this particular vowel it's going to debar Spurgeon says it's going to debar them from the use of wine and in order that they might not violate the obligation they were forbidden to drink the vinegar of wine or strong Liquors and to make the rules still more clear they were not to touch the unfermented juice of grapes nor even eat the fruit either fresh or dried see so we're talking about things that you know contaminate our lives and break our our allegiance to God as nazarites and we sometimes we so lament our failures but I'm gonna say I'm gonna Spurgeon is going to help me suggest to you that you might be failing in your vow as a Nazarite to God because you're you're not shunning the very appearance you're not leaving off the things that lead you to that you're I'm not going to do that but I'm going to dance around with all this carnality are that Carnell is going to suck you right in and you're going to break it see so in order for them not to break it God says now look in order for you to make sure you don't break it you're going to have to go above and beyond and you're gonna have to have some things in place like what don't even touch it don't even don't even you know drink the vinegar of it in fact is if somebody lays grapes in front of you dried or fresh don't don't touch them don't eat them well I only made a vow not to drink wine I know but if you do that that'll lead you there watch they were not to eat the fruit either fresh or dried in order Spurgeon says in order all together to secure the Integrity of the vowel now look at these levels so so the first one is is that in order that they might not violate the obligation and then it goes another level to make the rules still more clear see and then now it's going to go to all together to secure the Integrity of the vowel they were not even allowed anything that had to do with the vine at all in fact they were in fact to avoid the appearance of evil don't even go near the vine stay out of them or church don't go to the vineyard in order all together to secure the Integrity of The Vow they were to avoid even the appearance of evil surely Spurgeon says surely this is a lesson to the Lord's separated ones are you that is that you teaching them to come away from sin in every form to avoid not merely its grosser shapes but even its spirit and similitude strict walking this blew my mind the SE is written in the 1800s you got a seat belt on you ready get some smelling salts out you might need them this is written in the 1800s strict walking is much despised in these days oh what to God I could have those despised days but rest assured dear reader it is both the safest and the happiest he listen now listen to his final shot he who yields a point or two to the world is in fearful peril he who eats The Grapes of Sodom will soon drink the wine of Gomorrah this ain't no joke this is serious and you're living in a serious hour and God is a serious man and he has sent us a serious word he's very serious about his word that's why it's not up to our interpretation of it God sent us a messenger who gave us the interpretation of it and it's ours to Simply say Amen to every word and if you and if you you say but I just can't quite say Amen because that would be a vowel and I just know I'll break it then then at least if you can't say old man as the old as they used to say if you can't say old man to say oh me or oh my or God help me or something just whatever you do don't leave here like you came have some kind of determination to say Lord I'm going to press towards the mark a little harder I'm going to reach and aim a little higher you see the the question I'm gonna I mean I'm gonna stop with this the question from the Pharisees as I said to you it concerns the arrival of the coming kingdom of God and in fact is you know that that once he turns to his disciples and he just leaves those denominations you know blinking and trying to figure out what he meant by that the kingdom of your God is within you it's not like it's not coming with observation like you think that's coming there will be a real king and a real Kingdom in a real world but before he can restore that he's got to restore this see so the kingdom is being restored only in the upper room say what happened the kingdom was being restored what's happening today with this message the kingdom is being restored why do I need the token the kingdom is being restored and so you realize that that that that that that that this Kingdom that he's been Gathering as he across two thousand years as he said as the lightning starts under the eastern part of the heavens and shineth all the way to the western part of the heavens and you can see that historically and geographically the word of the original Apostles has migrated to our day to our lands and that's why you find America in Revelation chapter 13. and when you find her there she's under the control of a beast power don't don't think that's not happening see and so you have you have a number of things that are blending in and incorporating the first age and the last age in some ways they're they're quite a bit of like they're quite uh alike and in other ways you have to separate it out you know that the you know for instance the the characteristic of it being the days of Noah and the days of lot are specifically for the last day whereas when he said if you're on the rooftop you see the armies don't go down and grab anything if you're in the field you see the armies just go take off running run as fast as you can don't don't grab anything just go teach your children teach your family that way if you're in the house and they're in the field or vice versa or they're in town and you're not with them teach your family how to escape the judgment I'm here to tell you something friends we see the Winds of judgment moving on the earth the seventh vial has already been partially broken open and where it's already infecting the minds of mankind with Madness flee run teach your children run from this so where do I tell them to run to run to the word it's the it's the covert from Storm it's a safety see now in contrast to that you you have the both ages and all ages uh are judged because of their rejection of the word both at the beginning and the ending and so when we see the separating and we we came down to the separating that started in verse 34 and and 37. um I I don't think I want to well let me just sketch it here I tell you and that night there shall be two remember you got two in the bed two in the field two in grinding and and and you've got to want to be taking the other left and then they answer where Lord and he says wheresoever the carcasses so once you start with this kind of a separating found in Verses 34 to 37 we realize that the separating is to the word where the Eagles gather before the Rapture that's the separating two men here two women here two men here I'm gonna take one leave one take one leave one he's separating now as I said the Rapture is the ultimate separating we literally leave and meet the Lord in the air aren't we looking forward to that but before you get there you've got to be separated here and and that's why he doesn't say when they say where and he gives them the answer where the word is how do I get how do I make sure I'm the one that gets taken and not left go to the word gather around the word and if you eat on the word you'll be taken you won't be left oh hallelujah thank God for what he said in this hour my it's such a Perfection of I never caught this till today when I was studying early this morning we can talk about Revelation 13 we've read it many times but Ezekiel so so brings out uh brother brother Gideon give me Ezekiel 16. I just want to read two three verses there I promise I'm going to quit here just in a minute I'm just trying to get to this last thing Ezekiel 16 48 now this is a perfect description of the United States as you see it described in Revelation 13 also but he says here he's saying this to Israel as I live saith the Lord God Ezekiel 16 48. just just pay attention as I read till they get it as I live saith the Lord God Sodom thy sister hath not done he She nor her daughters as thou has done thou and thy daughters see that was our text we read about as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of Sodom all right so that's why we're reading this verse 48 again as I live saith the Lord God Sodom my sister hath not done nor She nor her daughters as thou has done thou and thy daughters verse 49 behold this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom here was her iniquity Pride fullness of bread remember I'm rich and increased with Goods I have need of nothing is there any people so infected with poisonous Pride than the United States see I have need of nothing I'm rich and increased with Goods well if you have need of nothing you don't need God for sure see so behold this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom Pride fullness of bread and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and the needy and they were haughty and committed Abomination before me therefore I took them away as I saw good now brother Branham makes a notation and I didn't put it on a PowerPoint I'm going to read it for you brother Branham makes a notation um in the message hearing recognizing acting on the word of God from February 1960 February 21. he starts talking about how he's reading in Matthew Matthew 24 because Matthew 24 is the parallel to Luke 17 30 all right Matthew 24 has quite a bit more details all right that's uh that's where he says it'll be so closer to see the very elected if it were possible and many false christs will arise and deceive many that's Matthew 24 right so but but the reason we're stuck with Luke 17 is because that's the ministry of the son of man and in fact is brother Branham notes in in Matthew 24 that the days of lot now catch this because this is really something the days of lot are not even mentioned only the days of Noah and in fact is in all the gospels only Luke Mark Miss doesn't mention lot John doesn't mention lot Matthew who seems to record everything doesn't mention a lot ha only Luke because now we're talking about the transference of the ministry of of the son of man and brother Branham says the reason that he doesn't mention I'm going to read you the quote is because it's going to be left to Revelation see it's it's a it's literally prophetic in fact as I said a lot in his family are not mentioned at all in the gospels of Mark and John and you have this one mention here in Luke 17 alone where you where you get just this little short list of characteristics in fact as half of which are is just a repeating of what he said about Noah and so so brother Branham so so what happens is is that you have brother Branham indicates that it's because that the full disclosure of Sodom is left for Revelation coming at the end time see and so so Jesus doesn't really talk a lot about it none of the other guys even write about it since it is connected since it's connected to the lightning that starts in the East and finishes in the west then it's connected to the second coming is that easy you're with me you're with me all right I can't lose you in the shuffle this is too important all right now so brother Branham is indicating that it's it's because it's going to be left to Revelation the understanding would be given at the end time to the end time Messenger to to you know to to the time of the messenger of the end time so that the bride living in the end time could know what to watch out for you need to know what to watch out for now here he says it's just one paragraph listen close hearing recognizing acting on the word of God did you notice Jesus in his speaking of the coming Second Coming he said as it was in the days of Noah they'll be eating drinking marrying and giving in marriage but when he spoke of the days of lot he never said nothing about it and that's true in Matthew and Mark and John he didn't see he never said anything about never spoke of the days of lot he never said nothing about it as the days of lot that's for revelation see now that's that's not different than when Paul goes back and speaks of Melchizedek and Paul starts to describe characteristics about Melchizedek that aren't anywhere in Genesis and nowhere in the Bible Paul had no no authoritative verse he could stand on when he said things like this Melchizedek having no beginning of days and no ending of life this Melchizedek who had no father who had no mother who abideth forever a priest continually Paul had no Authority except his prophetic office to make that statement see so now when Jesus speaks in three gospels it's not even mentioned and brother Branham reading from Matthew 24 says notice he doesn't mention it and then when we come to Luke Luke gives a few descriptions and it's really only tied to half of what was happening in the days of of Noah so it's going to take a prophet under Revelation when the when the lightning is in the West to show us what to look out for so reject him at your own peril if you don't take what's right you'll never be able to tell what's wrong see and so the first thing brother Branham describes when he comes to lot first he describes him as a leader brother Branham says perhaps a mayor of Sodom now that's that part's not novel The Bible gives some indication that lot was a leader in Sodom in Genesis 19 1. you can read about it how that it says lot was sitting in the Gateway of the city and when he saw the two angels who who came to warn him you know of that impending destruction and in Bible days the Gateway we've taught on this before the Gateway of the city is a place where important people such as Elders I'm reading this right from um uh right from lexical AIDS such as Elders judges rulers would sit and conduct business administered Justice and welcome guests see so that's not novel when brother Branham said when brother just like Jesus in The Book of Luke does give a few he says well they were buying and they were selling so that's a little different they're not just you know doing this and eating and drinking they're also they are marrying and giving in marriage but they're also buying and selling see but now brother Branham is going to come down with the last day Revelation and he's going to show how that he's going to break down the family and he starts out with saying you know lot was like a leader he's like the mayor perhaps of Sodom which as we've shown you that's not the novel part but then he goes on by now by direct Revelation we're going to start to get an inside look at how it devastated how that lot making that decision to live and down in the fertile Plains and left Abraham the who was a representative who's the one who received Melchizedek and he looked at the fertile planes of the valley and he said I'm going to go down and live down near there and he ended up getting elected his mayor and sat in the gate as a judge see how see how the devil just pulled him in and got him got him all twisted and don't you think he's not trying to do that to you don't you think he's not trying to do that to you you you you college kids who are in University God bless you don't lose sight of that they're going to try to twist you and pull you into that we we have college graduates here who can testify to that and and then and you we're we've got to be in business we've got to have schools we've got to raise families we've got to pay bills we we do live here we're not going to a commune I'm not going to build a wall around this place and we're all going to live here as a commune that's not the idea of the Gospel the gospel is I have sent you a sheep Out Among Wolves the gospel is you can't go out of the world just make sure you understand you're not from here you're not staying here see and that's what you should be teaching your children see so brother Branham now is going to take a real inside look at how it devastated his life and and the life of his family he breaks down the Family Affair how he says here that that Mrs lot now here's here's a prophet under Revelation he talks about how Mrs lot was a leader in society she was a a leader of the the president of all these Social Clubs and women's society and this society and that society and her husband is a judge and a mayor and he sits in the city gate and and brother Branham goes on to describe how that down through the family that that even her daughters it affected the daughters and how they ended up marrying into celebrity and the corruption that that the corruption that comes with that kind of worldly entertainment see he picks it up here watch what happened in the days of lot there was a lot down there in Sodom well settled down intellectually become the one of the big men of the city the judge said in the gates and judged the people his wife belonged to all the societies this is like Paul talking about Melchizedek here's here's Elijah at the end time talking about The Insider now he's giving you an inside view to the family his wife belonged to all the societies there was of the city that's a lot she she belonged to all the societies of the city and his daughters and all of them married among the celebrity intellectual Highly Educated smart witty you see you see how lot's decision permeated his family you see how that was just a trickle-down economy to ungodliness you see why we need praying families with praying parents we need a spiritual church and if you're going to have a spiritual church you got to have spiritual families and if you're going to have spiritual families you've got to have spiritual daddies God's spiritual husbands you got to have wives who know their place and stay in their Lane and pray for their husbands Pastor the children you got to have a Ministry who'll tell you the barefested truth you got to have the power of God that knows he can come down and move freely and I want him to know he can move freely he can go up and down these aisles he can come all over the platform he can take me he can take you how many would like to have that in your life today we can sin lot was I mean think of where this Got to Now now think about American fathers but the spirit of America and mothers who dress their little innocent children up as hookers and put them in beauty pageants put them on singing contests and and stand in the wings and cry because their little baby is being applauded and the little babies being molested by the devil and ruining that child notice that lot was not even hesitant to give up his daughters and he said to those evil men don't touch these angels but here have my daughters you see now this goes to show you because this this this should inform your thinking where the daughters were living don't forget come on let's be adults here these are the same two girls who would later get him drunk and have incestual affair with him to Bear children these aren't good girls these are girls who their daddy didn't care enough to keep the world out of the house and lot doesn't even have a hesitation to offer them see apparently I mean to me I'm thinking Lots lot's basically saying he probably had him before because my daughters basically are just little Street walkers you see and here he is now to save his own hide ready to do what he's been doing give up his daughters to Sodom is that tough is that hard you still love me this is the truth of God's word friend this is a serious hour and we can't play around with this we've got to have the power of God in total freedom it needs to move in my home in your home needs to move in this church it needs to move on our children we need to see the Holy Ghost I want to see all of our young people full of the Holy Ghost and on fire Hallelujah we want nothing to do with the world if you drink the if you drink the the the the grape of Sodom you'll drink the wine of Gomorrah see and so yeah and as far as his wife my goodness she never made it out entirely her heart was so completely engrossed in Sodom that she looked back longingly and God destroyed her and all of this we see lot you know as a as a type of the foolish virgin that had a righteous soul that sin vexed him brother Branham said it like this and I hope to God no husband or dad or man has this happening in his life the Bible says the sins of Sodom vexed his righteous Soul daily when brother Branham ran that through his Kentucky grammar he said it it it grieved him but he just didn't have the plain nerve enough to stand against that's putting it on the brass tacks say God give me courage give me give these men courage give these parents give these young people courage if Mom and Dad won't be spiritual young person you be spiritual if the fire's going out into home start one yourself Hallelujah I've seen young people get on fire and catch mom and dad on fire Hallelujah the power God can use anybody all he needs is one person under his complete control this is what would happen and we see that so perfectly that nominal Church that foolish virgin and we see Abraham up there on a mountain separate living separate from lit from laodicea from Sodom from Gomorrah oh friends is this the kind of life we want to have like Abraham had why don't you stand up with me and let's see if the Lord will will like to hear you say would like to see you raise your hand say Lord I want to be like Abraham I don't want to be like lot I don't want to be living down God bless those hands everywhere I don't want to be living like that
