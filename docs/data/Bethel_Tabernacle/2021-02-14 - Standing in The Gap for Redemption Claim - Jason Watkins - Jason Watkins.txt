course if i don't get through it and break down it'd be your fault amen amen god bless you this morning we greet you in the name of the lord we're so happy to have everyone here amen i've got a couple of prayer requests i want to pray over when we go to pray over the word and let me just pull this real quick so uh brother kevin continues to ask as an unspoken prayer request some devil just trying to complicate things for him and just asking prayer unspoken prayer request so we're just going to believe with our brother brother donald writes brother jason please continue praying for rhett he's in much much pain when the meds wear off we think we found the right combination of meds to work to give some relief as what the hospital sent did not help but praise the lord he wants to give his life over to the lord hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the man brother donald writes i'm emotional just writing this now i can well imagine he cannot put any weight on his foot for three months so it's going to be quite a drawn out period of time perfect that's perfect don't tell him i said that amen amen we might have to edit the video real quick oh they might be streaming okay well [Music] well um brother michael gonzalez writes a prayer request for beaufort taylor and family now these people brother mike sister one have known for many years brother beaver was your former pastor hey wonder um so prayer request for beaufort taylor and family chris and alicia they have been fighting flu symptoms for almost two weeks found out yesterday it was coveted beaufort passes church in panama city has heart issues everyone is very concerned thank you sister chastity asked prayer she had brother jason good morning i have a prayer request i i guess i can read this sister chastity it's okay i have a nodule on my adrenal gland that they i'm not going to try to pronounce that word they think is that word it is rare but usually benign we are waiting on more labs and i have a pet scan on march 3. even if it is not this they are recommending surgery based on its size please pray that if it's god's will it will shrink or totally resolved by the time of the skin it's also causing pain man when i read that i read that i was driving to church i just thought about how many times over the years i have seen god just take these kind of things and just dissolve them they just simply go out of existence you can't even hardly account for it other than it's a miracle by the hand of the lord so amen we're going to join and pray with our sister over this need as well that's all that i saw that came in to me i i can't remember if there were others but amen we want to pray over those as we pray just in a moment want to read our scripture first and we're going to invite you to revelation chapter 4 verse 1. brother jd writes um oh my this is the weekend wow so brother jd's in california [Music] and uh ministering to saints out there it's a real mission field here it's a real mission field here in california you better not get any ideas amen um my lots of hurting people due to lots of false teaching and nicolaitanism very sad not any genuine spiritual leadership my so keep me and the saints here in prayer [Music] i think that's the only ones that i had oh no there was one for brother homer longoria's in the hospital went by ambulance last night difficulty breathing they think maybe they sent him home too soon the pneumonia may be still rocking in his lungs so we sure won't that can happen i think they've got it beaten it's not quite gone so we want to pray for brother homer this morning these are great needs let's read in our scripture revelation chapter 4 verse 1 want to pray for travis and deb i think are traveling today or or they're out of town and so amen after this verse 1 revelation 4 1 after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter we're going to read from chapter 5 but let's pray and we'll let you be seated master we're thanking you for the reading of your word we thank you for our sunday school class this morning i thank you for my bible study that i taught early this morning lord we're thanking you for now coming again lord again for the third time to to bring your word to hungry hearts lord we are trusting you for the evening fellowship lord where we'll bring it a fourth time lord my heart is just so filled with your presence and i feel that i know exactly what you want for us today and so master i the best thing i can do quickly as i've done since early morning's light is just surrender and step out of the way let you be the speaker lord i thank you master for the two services already and we're asking that you be mighty in this one and master we are asking prayer for our special needs for the unspoken request of brother donald lord for rhett jackson lord and for beaufort taylor and his family for our sister chastity lord we're trusting you for brother jason lord uh in the mission fields lord and uh and needing needing the holy spirit to move in a mighty way we're thinking of brother longoria this morning father we're asking for your mercy in all of these cases we ask because we believe that you'll move if we didn't we wouldn't bother praying because the the apostle has taught us that if you don't believe you need not think you'll get anything from god so we are coming with faith believing that you hear our prayers lord and may you bring all of these things to pass according to your riches in glory we commit it to you now in jesus name amen god bless you as you're seated and we'll turn right away to chapter 5. praise the lord yeah okay brother jason clarifying the one of the problems is the church has has been without a pastor and so that was his comment you know there's no leadership ministry there in the ministry because they've been without a pastor for many years so we're just wanting to keep remembering that amen brother jd we sure will do it now one i want to by the help of the lord today to take a title standing in the gap for redemption's claim standing in the gap for redemption's claim there's a lot of places i'm going to take us to um in the scripture today we probably won't turn beyond what we're reading now because i won't think sir i want to move oh happy to have brother anthony's family here uh with us today so uh sister alicia i think praise the lord happy to have you sister god bless you and um amen that y'all got quite an announcement this morning amen praise the lord amen praise the lord so uh congratulations brother luther amen just listen melissa will be praying for you and amen [Laughter] amen so it's not every day you get to uh marry an ex-mafia hitman and luther denies that but we don't believe it amen we we we know what we see happy to have that announced this morning that was a secret that was hard to sit on felt like blowing up into outer space with it amen so we are delighted and thrilled couldn't be more thrilled so um we're going to go several places in the scripture today and so since i'm not going to turn i'll just do a lot of storytelling i love telling the stories of the bible i learned that from my mom she was a master storyteller and uh and i love telling stories out of the bible and so we find that that in this whole idea of standing in the gap for redemption's claim now one of the things as i just lead in to this thought that it's going to be important for you to understand about the verses in chapter four that we read chapter four is is the beginning of a of a of an event that happened where john was caught up into the throne room of god now when john tells the event he tells it across chapter 4 and chapter 5. now this is a super important point he tells it as one narrative now hundreds of years later when the translators constructed the bible you have they put it in individual chapters john didn't do that you understand jaundice wrote a letter to the church saying here's what happened to me and he said there after he looked at the the ages uh how how god raptured his church at the end of chapter 3 then brother branham would make a statement when he's teaching on in the breach from chapter five because that's where he's gonna go because he's gonna pick up boaz and boaz was a redeemer he was the one who was going to redeem ruth and then get naomi amen so so we realized that uh he was going to redeem naomi and then he gets ruth as a bride to be his wife and so we realize then that he's a perfect type of christ he's the goel g-o-e-l and it means an intermediary it means a a redeemer it means somebody who stepped in between all right and that's going to be important because i'm going to tell you something friends you needed somebody to stand between you and a holy god because the problem was you you love god and god loves you but you're born in sin and you live in a body that's still in a fallen condition and so there's no way that you know that you could ever be pleasing no matter how well you observed legalistic codes in the scripture it wouldn't even matter your your best effort of righteousness would be filthiness still to him you understand that so so we find that there had to be a worthy one step in between you john was standing here in the scripture and you're going to read it here in a minute when we get to chapter five i'm just giving you some foundation that that you're gonna find that john is destroyed by what he sees he he saw his last scene that he saw was christ walking in the midst of the seven lamp stands and then he saw a terrible scene at the end of the last age he saw christ put out of his own church and standing knocking asking for entrance into people's hearts individually and so the next thing he says after this i i he says looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter all right and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne now go to chapter 5 verse 1 you'll see the continuation and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne amen you see that flow see that he he was caught up and one seated on the throne and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy now we went from weeping much to singing see thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation see you get that and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth right and i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beast and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing do you wish all of those upon him today amen and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all i mean john's not leaving anything out and all that are in them heard eyes saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever now the angels are already making a loud noise but yet john says as loud as they were everybody heard me what i was doing was even louder amen and so so so you've got voice of many angels and then you've got you've got how is one man out shouting the voice of many angels and ten thousand times ten thousands and thousands and thousands of others how is john's voice louder than theirs i'm here to tell you something this is a happy man [Music] [Applause] this was a happy man over over one somebody taking that book so i want you to absorb that today you talking i mean that you you've never been in a in a rally this loud this deafening all right and so he says and the four beasts said amen i mean that's all they could say everybody's shouting and rejoicing and everybody's just saying power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and john is saying blessing and honor and glory and power and they're all agreeing and and what can the four creatures do but agree and say amen what they say amen i'm going to tell you those four living creatures are the anointings that are upon the church and there is an anointing falling on you to say amen to every word and when you start rejoicing there's an anointing behind that and that's why you feel it and the world says what's your problem and you say i'm rejoicing because i ain't got a problem you're the one with the problem somebody took my problem [Applause] wow oh my so we find that you're seeing this one you know th this is this is a continuous epic event that john is witnessing john goes from much weeping and brother branham talks about how that the reason that he was weeping is because when john's there expecting i mean the last thing he saw was christ put out now you could imagine that he he's already upset and then he gets caught up into an open door which an open door is always a further revelation of jesus christ it's always that in the bible it's never not that and so we find that of course chapter four is the bride going into rapture as it relates to the bride leaving the last age she certainly does do that chronologically in time over time she leaves and heads into the millennium at the end of the seventh age we don't need an eighth age we don't need an eighth messenger we've got the messenger and that's christ all right so but brother branham explains in the breach he says now what he's doing in chapter chapters by the end of chapter three the church goes in the rapture but in chapter five and we have to include four i just proved it four is the same story he says in chapter five he's showing how he did it it showed that he the bride does go up at the end of the seventh age and now he's going to show how he pulled it off all right because there was no way for that church to go in the rapture brother branham said the church can't go in the rapture and she can't get any better and now she's put christ out now she really can't get any better you understand so so if there hadn't have come a message that's why god says i'll send you elijah before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord lest i smite the earth with a curse in other words i already know they're going to kick me out i already know there's no way to get them in a rapture and so it instead of just wiping it all out i'll first send elijah and he'll gather a bride hallelujah there'll be a message to go around the world and i'll get it i'll get me a queen [Applause] and you're it and here we are and you're living here you're a believer today because this happened amen and john saw it in the future it happened in mine in your day amen amen and it caused john to rejoice i don't know how you look at life but john was rejoicing john wasn't absent of problems john had his eyes put out he's now blind he's on a prison island but he's rejoicing so unless you're blind sitting on a roman and had your eyes gouged out while you were alive and on a prison island unless that's your life today you should be rejoicing for what christ john john got excited just knowing he's going to do it you're living in the age where he'd done done it so he's showing here in chapters 5 and 4. how he pulled it off and then he's gonna begin to go into six through the through the seven seals and chapter seven he's gonna catch the 144 thousand you're gonna see a congregation in heaven there's an interval of time and and chapter eight is going to pick up the seventh seal and and the seven trumpets and on and on it goes until you find it in chapter 10 where you now have this book which was closed in chapter 5 is now open in chapter 10 why because of everything you just read leading up to 10. amen this is why denominational man-made systems can't help you because they don't have the opened book they don't have the unsealing and what is what is the unsealing it is the mighty god unveiled and now we know who he is he we know he's he can't be found in a creed he's not a creed he can't be found in organized religion they booted him they gave him the left buddha fellowship amen and the only way you're going to have access to this open book is you've got to be caught up into the spiritual revelation that john caught and you've got to say amen and agree i mean there is an anointing on your life friends and this isn't in my notes but i tell you the lord's been dealing with me all morning and i i don't even i can't account i can't stand here today i told the sunday school class you know it's all about priorities letting god lead your life and sometimes you go through things in life and you say brother jason why and that's the it's the question that has plagued mankind since the garden of eden why kids start out asking why soon as you won't give them something why well something happens to him why and that's just in man's nature and so you you might have questions here today and say i'd like to know why this happened it didn't happen to her it didn't happen to him why did why god let it happen to me there are things that are happened to you and may happen yet in this life and there won't be an answer to you get on the other side but here's what i can promise you here's what i can tell you if you let him be the lord of your life it'll all come out you'll be happy you won't regret that you let him be the lord the people who gnash their teeth together in bitter anguish are the ones who wouldn't do that see and so you you find that that that while you're in your life and you're going through whatever it is you're going through and listen you're looking at a man who's been through quite a bit and i've had my share of severe hard seemed to seem like it would finish me trials multiple times i you know i i've been at this a while and and and and and i could tell stories and everybody in here could stand up and tell stories and we'd hear one story we'd go oh my and then we'd hear another one go oh my and you hear another one it's like wow but you know something i want to say this that those anointings those four living creatures i don't care what's befalling you or what may happen to you you're being anointed to say amen to it amen you're being anointed to say not my will god's will be done and it might cost you and it might hurt you and you might you might end up seemingly you know uh getting the short end of the stick and you might get the next 100 short ends of sticks but i'm here to tell you there's an anointing on you that's saying say amen but lord this is hard it is but i got it say amen why do you need me to say amen because i need you to agree with my vision for your life and whatever i have called you to do i i never promised you it would be easy it wasn't easy for me but i haven't promised you it would be easy i have only promised you it will be worth it and it will amen it will it is it already is and all the things i've suffered in it baffles the devil that the more discouraging trials he sends on you the stronger your faith gets amen i mean the devil can't win for losing i mean he could actually win if it wasn't for losing i tell him that all the time you could win if you weren't losing poor guy so even things that look like you've won and you find out you just had strings on you and a ring in your nose and my father was causing you to do that me to go that way and then he was going to redeem me out and i'm still standing by him and you're still on the outside looking in you had your chance and you blew it i'm not here i'm i'm here to say amen to every word of god in my life it's the quickest way to joy we read that in in the psalms this morning that in the presence of the lord is joy there's no joy in your bank account being big or you know the finest home or the finest car the finest education the finest job in career there's no joy in that there's plenty of pleasure the the sin is pleasure that that's what the bible says they they have this the pleasure of sin for a season so there's lots of pleasures listen young people there's plenty of pleasures in ungodliness but there's no joy there there's no contentment there's no peace there's no real happiness there the only time and all you'll do is you'll chase that and chase that and chase that till you chase it into a devil's hell and when he slams your cell door shut and you'll be there bound over for trial until the great white throne judgment when you hear that door clink closed in those regions and you'll hear him going off laughing i've got another one you're going to feel like a fool that you set and heard preaching and saw the god prove his word and never would surrender and let god be the master of your whole life oh my and so we find then that there is this this whole concept of you know nothing can happen and and brother branham says john was weeping because john knew that if no one is found worthy to take the book then it's all for naught and john is saying i i mean john was at calvary john was on golgotha actually the lord spoke to him that's how close he was in earshot and john saw that you're not going to convince john he didn't didn't experience that but yet john knows as he's living and breathing and standing here right now if somebody don't take that book that trip to calvary was for nothing because that's a purchasing act but what about the claiming act if you buy something never go pick it up amen and so what good does it do you do i bought it so christ bought he paid the price once for sin and he dieth no more but there's got to be a claiming work in redemption that's redemption is always in two parts so he's got to have a purchasing time at calvary he's got to have a claiming time at the end of the ages i mean listen friends you can say well but god sent us a prophet that prophet was standing beside him and preaching and calling he's right here in the breach saying let him come and brother branham catches that and identifies himself with that strong angel he's not the mighty angel that's an error he's not the mighty angel he's a strong angel and he's standing there calling for a worthy one you say oh i got a prophet i believe a prophet but but if that book is not claimed and the seal's not broken the calvary won't work a prophet won't work nothing can save us now how much do you want to rejoice and say i'm so glad in 1963 in a little little no nothing town in a little church five or six hundred people the most epic event of history is taking place and the world looks on it as nothing and we look on it as everything it's everything there's something about the attitude of john and there's why i really want to zero in today i think that's why sister ruth's song meant so much to me because the real cry of the heart of a real believer those words were so amazing if we go back and here's where we're not going to turn in the scriptures but you just you just follow along with him i'm going to go into very familiar places things you've learned since sunday school we go back to travel to genesis 18 and here you find abraham standing in the door of his tent in the cool of the day this is the evening time and you know it's the end it's representative of the end of the ages and here's going to come the king of salem again abraham had met him one time before served him communion and abraham paid him a tenth of all and uh and but now he's coming as a human being he's going to show a little bit of a difference now because now he's coming as a human being he's actually going to sit down and eat a meal he didn't do that when he came in theophany when he came his melchizedek and theophany he served abraham communion he didn't take it he didn't need anything but now he's in a human body see often he's don't eat and so now he's in a human form and he's not the he's not the begotten of the father that's coming that means born of a woman so so melchizedek is not the begotten of the father he's not born of a woman brother branham describes it how that he just took the 16 elements of the earth and calcium potash and cosmic light and balled it all up and build a body and just stepped right into it and built another body and another body and stepped messengers in one on his right and one on his left their mission is going to be to go to sodom it's going to be two messengers going to sodom but he's coming to abraham and if you'll notice when he comes to abraham abraham abraham is abraham has had the the mighty god unveiled that's what the seals are it's the unveiling of god jesus brother brahm says christ broke those seals off of himself it's not doctrine it's not theology it's an unveiling of a being that that can that can that wants to live inside you and change you amen and and literally take you off of the earth not just figuratively here but he wants to see uh revelation 4 1 fulfilled naturally when a bride goes into glory and the world don't see her again naturally until genesis i'm until revelation 19 when she comes back see but but in order to get to that natural going up you've got to have this spiritual unveiling you've got to stand yourself there and identify yourself with john and john is standing by his messenger many have walked away from the messenger thank you i'll stand right by you and i will identify myself with him and when he calls for a one to come and then i see one come and then i and he's he opens book and it becomes open and it and and john is rejoicing and the angel rejoicing and thousands and thousands are rejoicing and then i find when i get in the message i start rejoicing [Music] what caused me to love god so much the word it caused me to come out of her my people that you be not a partaker of her sins i willingly came out he didn't pull me out he called to me and i gladly came out i looked at an open book i looked at a creed and i said no that's not even a question there's no decision to make see so so if he's called to you today don't spurn mercy he's only even obligated to call you once but the fact that he's called to you obviously means he wants you he's called you to come because he wants you to come so the only decision to be made is yours because you already know his amen so there's no blaming god you already know god's intent god wants you to come out so that you don't get destroyed come into christ hallelujah so so we find that that now he's coming to abraham in a human form because he's got to have a type of what's going to come at the end time because that genesis 18 that's what that's typing sodom's about to be destroyed two messengers about to go in his bible fire and brimstone rain rained on it from heaven amen so it's an end time event amen that for sodom this is this is an extinction event coming to sodom and and that you know what they're doing they're just like the days of noah they're just going about buying and selling building and marrying giving in marriage and perversions of all kind and they don't they don't all they think that life is just going to go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and it and it was going to go on until it wasn't and two messengers are going to show up and lead a small party of people out of there which was a type of the foolish virgin because they will be saved they're not saved in the tribulation they're already righteous people say you want to keep that straight they're already righteous people they already have a heart for god so it's not ungodly people that's not the foolish virgin the foolish virgin are virgins and they're righteous and the bible says the king in matthew 25 the king shall say unto the righteous and then it says and the righteous shall say to the king see there there's there was people in matthew 25 that had all kinds of church works and they did all kinds of things that looked like it outstripped and outpaced the these people who are getting life and they're not getting eternal life and these people who look like they didn't weren't even as good or getting eternal life why because all of these works were done in iniquity they they were man-made and brother brown said the church is no longer his voice she's become her own voice and therefore he says he's going to confound that church with his with his prophet and uh and his bride under her prophet under her messenger will be the final voice to the final age amen this is how it's all playing out you can't make this stuff up friends it you can't make it hit like that this thing just it just just purrs this engine just purrs all everything is hitting exactly how it's supposed to hit and it agrees with every type there that's where abraham is in the evening time and that's when the mighty god is unveiled and what's the sign that he sees he sees god operating through a man and and then at the time when sodom's ready to be destroyed and then what do you know here we come to the time when sodom's ready to be destroyed and a prophet is standing on the scene and he says now notice he sat in the tent with his back to the tent and sarah in a tent behind him and he he gives forth the prophecy and sarah lab brother brandon said she kind of in kentucky english she laughed up her sleeve it's an old colloquialism that we say she laughed up her sleeve man she didn't think nobody would hear that and he says why did sarah left she immediately i didn't laugh oh you did for you said in your heart it might never come across your lips but your attitude toward my promise we got a problem your attitude toward my word this is causing a problem and at that point sarah would have had no way to e no way to stay alive just like eve eve had no chance to live god would have burned her with the serpent amen but eve sarah you and me you know why god couldn't touch her because she was part of abraham abraham had already taken her christ has already taken you and yes i fail and yes you fail but he can't hurt me because i'm in christ he can't kick me out because i'm in him hallelujah there's only one elected son and that's christ and i'm in him hallelujah and so we find that's why brother brown will say it's not the man that comes elected it's the seed that's inside the man i'm here to tell you something friends you want to have something to rejoice over rejoice over this that you weren't smart enough to find god but god found you and you were too thick and dumb to accept him but god has accepted you and jesus said you haven't even chosen me like you think i chose you and i've called you for a purpose that that negates and invalidates any mistake satan has ever caused in your life i don't care if the mistake was 30 minutes ago it is invalid when it goes into the blood of the lord jesus christ any charge against god's family is illegitimate after the seals are opened amen because we're in christ there's no way calvary in matthew 27 and matthew 28 and the events of revelation 4 and 5 invalidate any charge against god's family and that's why paul could say that that there is now therefore no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus and so we find that here abraham i'm watching my time carefully here he's coming to abraham and and he's and why did sarah laugh i didn't you did for this what you said in your heart and he heard words she never uttered but she's in abraham so she's protected it's like eve adam took eve quickly because he knew god would destroy her and so quickly he knew god couldn't destroy him because he was the son of god the bible doesn't even call him a son of god it caused him the son of god so he's the first adam and and and and when his when his bride fell into sin he stepped into sin to redeemer the problem with adam was he was immortal and he couldn't he tried to get back out he couldn't get out himself so you were off in the ditch and then he brought his big four by off in the ditch to get you out and both of you got stuck so the beauty of the second adam is is that he had power over death and hell and the grave and when he stepped into sin and he did he took your sin and god condemned him and judged him as a sinner and sent him to hell but david said hell can hold him the great couldn't hold him hallelujah oh my because he's all power in heaven and earth he ascended up out of there broke the seal of the tomb in matthew 28. death could not hold him and as soon as he got out of the tomb he reached back in and starts pulling his bride out with him he's been pulling him out ever since did he pull you out has he pulled you out today say i remember the day when he pulled me out hallelujah oh my send it up on high gave gifts unto men sent his spirit back into the church so we find that that he he comes to abraham now i want you to see this same correlation that you see in john you're seeing in abraham who's the father of the faith because there's there's a uh just just like you and i we read in the book of revelation about the plagues coming upon the earth and it's nothing but doom and gloom i mean it's morbid it's it's ominous it gives you cold chills say goodness i don't want to even be anywhere near when that happens believe me you don't they aren't going to go through a tribulation like she's never known mankind for his rejection of the lord is going to have to uh he he chose his master and there you go that's the choice he made brother braham said that's what you wanted that's what god gave you so now it's going to do with it you wanted a denomination you you wanted a crooked politics you wanted a crooked church you wanted a false pastor you wanted somebody with itching ears that would let you do whatever and brother branham said god just gave you the desire of your heart you can't blame god your brother said okay there you go there you go there you go pentecost there you go your assemblies you won this you pc there you go god sends a message you didn't want that you wanted a system of man she could rule over one another and draw lines and put people in and out and live any old way said okay fine there you go that's what you wanted that's what god gave you now what you're going to do with it you're headed into a tribulation i tell you what nothing doing for me i'm running to christ when i heard the words come out of her my people you don't have to ask me twice i'm out hallelujah when i come out of something i'm going into something i come out of that to go into him hallelujah amen i want nothing to do with this sinful world i can't stand this sinful world it's it's it's i it's not native to me anymore holiness is native to me hallelujah righteousness is native to me uh godliness that's my intrinsic my every every fiber of my inside i i i loathe the ungodliness perversion that i have to rub shoulders with say well why are you a preacher because i why do you deal with it why do you keep going into the heads in the highways because i know god still got some names on that book i don't know who they are but i'm just broadcasting the seed everywhere god will find his people that's what jesus told those fishermen i'll make you fishers of men and you'll go and you'll bring in all kinds every kind bring in all kinds i'll separate them later i'll sort them out later hallelujah that's what he's done that's what he's doing and so we find that here you are at the end time again end time end time genesis 18 revelation chapter 4 5 and after that the tribulation starts setting in and here genesis 18 you're at an end time for sodom we're at an end time for sodom amen and the messengers head on down and now god's got a secret but i want you to notice the heart of abraham now we're talking about where is your heart where's your relationship with god because abraham is so amazing in his relationship to god that when he when he hears the story when god un unlocks the seal and tells him what i'm about to go do and and bro draws him in catches him up into a revelation i'm about to destroy this place and he's he's realizing wait a minute there's good people down there and so he he's coming you you read the story and he's coming in genesis 18 and he's coming and he's saying lord will you destroy the righteous will you will you destroy the righteous with the wicked that be far from thee now i want you to really catch this friend abraham is not and he says not be far from the abraham's not not berating god he's not trying to browbeat him he's not trying to you know you know shame on you that'd be far how dare you you'll never do something like that that's not his attitude you have to understand this is the man who had become the friend of god and god even testifies can i hide anything from abraham oh there was no secrets he he to his friend that's why jesus said i've called your friends he he said i reveal my secrets to you because you're my friends how many like being the friend of god oh my this is a this is a love affair abraham loves this man this man loves abraham this is his god this isn't a man born of a woman this is jehovah this is elohim amen and abraham comes with this knowledge because he knows this god he he he's saying lord i know you you would never oh no no no no no no destroy the righteous with the wicked i know that's what it looks like i know you lord you can't fool me i know you i've learned you i've grown we've grown close you would never do a thing like that now abraham didn't start out with that kind of insight abraham had to learn that through trial and error abraham had i know hebrews 11 is the the book of champions i know it's the hall of fame and in there abraham is spotless never doubted never wavered never never disbelieved god but but i can read in genesis before calvary which took all that away i can read before calvary did that that abraham backslid left the promised land brother bram said any time of julie's promised land he's backslid goes down into egypt lion cheating can ivan almost gets himself killed almost loses his wife ends up a complete criminal and liar ends up leaving rich okay that's just god spoils the whole nation to protect his son and abraham leaves with great wealth and and you know what he does then later on you think oh i'm sure abraham will never do that again boy he learned a hard lesson boy that was close he'll like to lost sarah until he gets over and gets in a jam again oh it's fine let me tell you something you can serve god all you want in your own willpower but you'll come up on a trial where you won't you'll come up on a trial friends that that ticking time bomb of that little fallen nature that's still down in you that the only way you get rid of that is a new birth by the holy ghost so i'm a christian while you are now let's see let's see a few more turns of the moon might what it might do to you we've we've had people before who we thought we've had ministers who we thought before were solid come to find out wow they never even had the thing they claimed they never even were born again at say that's how you're going to judge them i'm not the bible says that nobody's speaking by the spirit of christ caught nobody's speaking by the holy ghost calleth jesus accursed because the holy ghost can't deny his own word you can't come against the word and say i'm anointed of christ to be against his word because nobody speaking by the holy ghost calleth jesus accursed you understand so it's obvious it becomes evident that they never had the experience they claimed they had maybe it's still open to them thank goodness i'm not the judge i don't want to be an arbiter of stuff like that i i'm just here to keep spreading the seed keep spreading the seed keep spreading the seed how about we have a how about we have a heart like abraham how about that bethel tabernacle how about we have a heart like abraham says lord but if there's 50 i'll spare it what about 40 i know you're pretty good i'll spare it 30 yep 20 yep okay nobody else would have the guts to do what i'm about to do but a bride who knows her husband really well knows how far she can push it what about 10 abraham i i wouldn't even tell anybody else what i'm going to do but you i wouldn't even have this kind of conversation but me and you are tight abraham i know your heart for me because i can see inside it oh my oh you'll never doubt my word abraham you'll always believe me and i'll tell you something friends he was there to confirm the son hallelujah they had to have a body change you'll never see the lord in the air without a body change hallelujah you've got to have a body change just like abraham and sarah and what it say what's the message doing to me right now it's confirming the covenant the covenant was made in here jesus made the covenant to you in the scripture he that believeth on me has passed from death into life and shall never come into the judgment that's a promise he's here in this last day to confirm that to you and he sent the sign of melchizedek with a prophet who could discern the very secrets of people's hearts who were behind him come on friends let us not be thick let's realize what god has done in this hour let's have a heart like john let's rejoice for what god has done amen abraham with that heart and and god is saying yeah i won't do it you know what what abraham is praying because you can't you should never pray contrary to god's will the apostle teaches you that that's why you don't get your prayers answered because you pray asking amidst that you just want to reap something upon your own desires and lust it says but when you pray you are to pray according to the word see when when israel went into 70 years captivity god's word said you'll be there 70 years they didn't want to do that i mean who would gonna be here 70 years are you kidding i'll grow old and die here and and another prophet comes by with a false message gave everybody a lot of false hope not two years lord told me two years everybody's rejoicing jeremiah says well all i know is what god told me and then he goes home that day god comes to him in the evening says now tomorrow you go you find that guy again and you tell him to prove it that that you're the prophet jeremiah not him to prove it tell him in front of everybody you're going to die within a year guess how long that man lived not a year guess how long israel was in captivity 70 years you know why so so so when they prayed you go into the into the scripture when they prayed they had to they had to change their prayers to pray according to his decision you can't pray and ask god for things that aren't his will for your life you understand that you're you're never going to get god to move in that kind of a way you you say well i got a situation brother jason i don't even know i i look in the word i can't discern and i don't even know what his will is well well then fall back on the on the fails on the failsafe be like jesus and just say not my will thine be done hallelujah amen but it's the heart of abraham that i'm emphasizing because that's how john felt john was standing there and he's weeping and he's broken-hearted because this is over and everybody's going to be destroyed and nobody yeah i got a prophet you know calling for it but now we looked everywhere we've looked above heaven through heaven bleep below heaven under everywhere we can't find it we turned over every stone there's nobody worthy and yeah well let's let's just not use a man no you have to use a man why because he's a human what does that got to do with it well you're a human so the only way a redeemer can be a redeemer's got to be kin to you so uh there's there's no way a bull or a lamb or a dove his life can't come on you he's not kin he's not human you've got to have a redeemer that's kin to you it's got to be a human being and there isn't anybody until god become a man hallelujah he didn't just build a body and step in it he came upon a virgin and spoke his word and she believed it and god created in her a human male hallelujah and she and as an incubator but literally so so human god built his body out of the elements of the cursed earth and brother brown talks about the potatoes marian the the calcium and the things that you know the carrots and different things and travel through the placenta and into the child and and it pushes out arms and pushes out fingers and pushes out a nose and and starts to develop and this is a man and he's born a baby and he has to grow and he's gotta he's like you know just like abraham like like jesus abraham had to grow to learn how to be god's friend gee the bible says the child speaking of jesus the child had to submit himself to his earthly parents and the bible says he grew in wisdom that's why that's why the the apostle would say that jesus learned obedience he learned obedience by the things he suffered don't don't go after god in anger because of your life let if you don't like your life let god change it let god make it beautiful i don't the circumstances don't have to change you can be in one circumstance and not born again and hating your life the next moment you can be in the identical same circumstance but born again and you'll raise a hand and say glory to god glory to god glory to god circumstances mean nothing to you the only thing that matters is he opened the book and loosed the seals and i'm like john i'm rejoicing hallelujah amen it's all about your willingness david peter said to the only day of pentecost you you destroyed him the prince of life but i'm here to tell you that god catch these words god hath made him both lord and christ so there had to be a growing there had to be a development developing into that he didn't come as a baby and ready for calvary he's not going to get baptized by john and go straight to calvary before he goes to calvary's got to go to the wilderness oh my well we all want to be in a rapture yesterday but i'm going to tell you something friends we still got some learning we've still got some growing we still got some finding we still got some preaching you need to say a few more amens there needs to be a few more prayers go up there needs to be a few more baptisms and hallelujah we're baptizing them around the world for everyone that jumps out we baptize 20. there you go you think something's collapsing nothing doing everyone that jumps out we baptize 50 more hallelujah this is the lord's doing glory to god oh my you're not going to stop it i'm here to tell you something friends take some advice from me if god is determined to do something in you with you through you in you you're not going to stop him if he's determined to do something you're not gonna stop it and i'm here to tell you on the flip side if he's determined something ain't gonna happen bring all the king's horses and all the king's men you want you're not gonna make it happen you ought to be glad and you ought to rejoice because one who knows the end from the beginning is the lord and master over all my life it's that heart that john had it's that heart that abraham had it's that heart that esther had when she comes there in in esther 4. and here here you go end of the world the jews are all going to be slaughtered for the jews it's an extinction event just like sodom just like tribulation now the jews are done for how this happened the conniving haman who represents the devil well how in the world well who who gave him the death sentence the king wait what i thought the king was god represented god he does oh whoa well then how'd the king get tricked into giving a death sentence to the jews just like paul paul says i mean that wasn't the king wasn't intending to kill esther and all her people through trickery yeah through conniving go into the book of romans and paul says now i found out here's something i found out that the law was good the law is not bad problems me i can't keep it there's nothing wrong with the law the law came to give life that's why it came the law was given to to help you to guide you through life but but paul says but satan now taking the commandment that's all well and fine it's great news but the problem is i've got a fallen condition i'm born wrong so now satan uses the law which was for my good and he turns it in a in a in a in a crafty move he turns it against me and now it becomes my death sentence because i can't keep it and even if i could i still wouldn't escape death because i'm born in death you see so you you can see haman moving there so it's god letting it happen it's that's how god set up redemption that that you came that's why brother branham would say this is an astounding statement you ought to see the times i've preached funerals and i was preaching to somebody who wasn't even a christian at all and i'm trying to give the family some kind of hope and and man and and oftentimes i use that wonderful saying brother eddie said years ago well they'll get a fair trial i can promise you that every man will get a fair trial but i but here's another comfort that i can give him i can say and this on the authority of a prophet god will never condemn a man for being a sinner man i was born a sinner he didn't he didn't volunteer bible says he was subjected to it we didn't volunteer to come like this we were subjected to it it's all part of god's plan of redemption you understand so brother brown says god will never condemn a man for being a sinner it's not his fault he was born a sinner he had nothing to do with it he i wasn't there when adam and eve did that you understand i there was no way for me to get here outside of a union between my mom and dad and though and though the bed was undefiled and the marriage union is blessed of god i still get born sinful because that's coming the wrong way i'm coming by that tree of knowledge of good and evil you understand and so so god's not going to condemn me for that brother brandon says what will condemn the man is that he remained a sinner when he didn't have to that christ that day on calvary provided a way that a man can escape that and if he don't take it then it's not god condemning him he's condemning himself god never brings judgment without first offering mercy hallelujah thank god so when it comes down to it when the when the spirit of god knocks on your heart my goodness throw up both hands and say i surrender lord i surrender all take me i'm yours take me this day i might make other mistakes but i'm still his i've passed from death unto life here's esther at the end of the world this is a terrible thing this haman this wicked haman he's going to bring about their destruction and mordecai comes to esther i'm going to close with this one mordecai comes to esther you have to go in to see the king why me you're the queen there's no one else qualified there's no one else qualified i can't do it there's no one else it's not anybody's role but yours but i but i haven't been summoned esther you're going to have to realize something but as the queen you don't always have to wait for the call you already know he loves you you already know esther here's what you're gonna find out esther you can enter boldly into the throne you can enter boldly and bring your your your petitions to god that's the provision that calvary gave you as god's bride paul says that inner boldly it's what mordecai's saying go in and she says oh my she says i'll go she says tell all israel tell all the jews tell everybody to fast and pray for me for three days and i'll i and my maidens will all fast and pray and i'll go to see the king and if i if i perish i perish but i'm going to see the king she's the only one now it's it's by design god has designed it listen friends we we would love for jesus just to come down and prove himself to the whole world again though he did it and it didn't work then it won't work now he's looking to prove himself through you you and and she says i can't do it and mordechai says how do you know esther but what you've been called you've been born you've been brought to here for such a time as this listen friends i don't know why how you became a believer i don't know the trail of your life i don't know the miseries you've been through i don't know the battles you're facing right now but how do you know say my life's so unfair how do you know that god has got you in that spot so that you can then be a witness to somebody in that same spot i don't know i can't explain your whole life i can't explain mine i've asked god many times lord why'd you let that happen it caused such a problem i've had such a weakness why'd you let that happen why'd you let this happen and god is just saying my grace is sufficient for you just keep walking just keep trusting just keep feeding i got this i got you i got it all she steps into the throne room and immediately the law of god the law of god said she's got to die because there's no way that you can come into the presence of god a sinful creature without a body change i can never go into its presence without a body change see because he's a holy god and i've got a sinful body and i can't take it into his presence there had to be somebody stepped between me and that god on the throne there you are in revelation 4 revelation 5 there was no way john was finished it was all done it didn't matter what he done from what he ever had done or what he would do from there on but somebody stepped and came in between him and the one seated on the throne took the book out of his hand and opened it and john broke into revival the whole angels and ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands are breaking into revival and the four living creatures are screaming amen to the whole the to the whole thing and and and it's because that's somebody and see when esther comes that she there's no way she can come into his presence like that and and so unless the king reaches forth his scepter because the scepter now is going to be between him and her amen you understand that's christ that's the redeemer that's the lamb hallelujah that's abraham abraham was portraying christ to melchizedek abraham is a redeemer he's trying to redeem me that he's got family down there he's got loved ones down there he's he's a goal boaz was the redeemer to redeem naomi and ruth you understand the scepter is a redeemer the lamb was a redeemer something that could come between the sentence of death and a needy person but you know what just because he extended it they didn't kill her but there's no conversation yet there's nothing being granted yet you know why she's got to go forward the bible says she put on her royal apparel you wouldn't even have that friends you wouldn't even have royal apparel to go into the presence of the king you you couldn't even go in and intercede for your children if you didn't have the royal apparel you couldn't go in and intercede for your family and your loved ones if you hadn't dressed yourself in the royal apparel of god's word oh could we rejoice today bethel tabernacle this is this isn't god sent us a message and a prophet we got 1200 tapes and we've gotten a bunch of books and we say god's in a private it's so that's so shallow that's so that's just the initiation of it all hallelujah this is god revealing himself you're caught up in an epic moment in history the end of all time and you're a main player how because you've like esther you've got you've you've robbed yourself in the garments of his word and now you can pray according to his will because the bride knows what she wants done she knows what he wants done with his word siesta knew he didn't want to kill her esther knew he didn't want to kill all the jews esther knew this was a trick that that evil haman had pulled it off he'd he had used the the king's love against her she comes now she's got to walk forward and she's got a layer hand the bible says she touched with her finger the tip every eastern monarch with his with his scepter it has a a crown jewel some type of head upon it if you see any type of eastern monarchist his scepter has a has a head on top and has a crowned head on top and when he extends that to her she's got to lay her hand that's that's like when the jews brought their lamb to to the priest to offer him the man had to lay his hand on the head of the lamb he had to identify with the sacrifice she has to come up it's not just offering it thank god i'm free no she's got to go forward and identify herself she's got to make contact are you still here she's got to make contact and when she did i love this i preached on it many times before around the world if you'll notice when she did that now now you're going to see it go the other way before it was going this way when abraham said you will never do that god hasn't even uttered a word abraham's already talking that be far from the you you'll never do you would never i know you now you've got xerxes looking at his queen she doesn't utter a word but he says what is thy request queen esther and thy petition it shall be how'd she know he how did he know she needed anything you know why her actions spoke louder than her words that she had came into his presence that she had donned her royal apparel that she had walked forward and put her hand on the head of the redeemer and now the king says ask anything to the half of my kingdom doesn't mean we're going to split it 50 50. that's a recipe for disastrous marriage if you're living in a 50-50 deal because you're both crooks and nobody will keep 50. you better if you're going to live that way if you're going to live in legalism then at least move it to 90-10 and each one of you give 90 and only expect and you might have a shot at it maybe you might make it pull it off but don't try 50 50. you're gonna cheated both of you you'll cheat and get cheated and so he wasn't offering her a 50 50 deal he's offering her 100 percent of my whole kingdom i will 50 50 share it the whole thing with you ask me anything i'm going to tell you something friends that heart of esther that heart of the king that heart of abraham that heart and melchizedek that heart of the lamb that heart of john that's what sister ruth was singing about today that's where we've got to live friends that you you you remember you remember when when brother branham i thought about this this morning and i'm going to close with this i think i already said that once be like brother diggs don't don't get scared i'm fitting to close so when brother branham goes into that cafe you remember and here's a state trooper playing a slot machine got his arm around some young girl probably under age back in here some teenage boys being stupid and listening to boogie woogie music and all that and here's an old hag of a lady he said you know she's she's playing the part of an ill-famed woman she's got her two guys sitting there with her at the table and they're laughing and carrying on and brother branham just walks in here's a man of god who lived half of his life in the supernatural presence of the shekinah and he walks into that he's just trying to get a get up a breakfast and he walks in on that and he looks around and he says lord why don't you just destroy it just burn it how do you tolerate this it got on his under his skin so bad and then a vision begins to break and he says out in front of me he says i see a world turning and he steps back behind the door oh goodness the lord's talking to me and he says i've seen a world and he said around that world was a ring of blood and he said i saw sins i saw sins coming up from the earth headed toward god's throne but every time they would hit that bumper of blood they couldn't get past it here comes a sin it's going to for sure if this gets to the king he's going to kill that guy and boom it hits that bumper of blood can't make it and then he sees the lord jesus and the lord jesus is standing there and he says he sees something hitting him and he said when it hits him he said spit and blood just fly and it comes again and hits him again and he just flies because he's that bumper he's that bumper and every time a sin goes up that would get to god you've got an intermediary you've got one standing between the two hallelujah somebody's standing between you and me to take that blow that it doesn't get to god and brother branham catches a revelation and he says lord and the lord starts talking to him and he says now you you wanted me to destroy them and yet hear your sins my sins yes the only ones you're seeing are yours you mean the ones that are making your blood fly every time i do something a wrong thought wrong attitude wrong action wrong reaction that's hitting you yes and you want me to destroy all of these and yet i'm standing here blocking every transgression and brother branham says lord forgive me forgive me just forgive me you know what had happened he he says and when he asked the lord to forgive him he take jesus standing there holding a book and it says on the book the sins of william branham and he said when brother branham asked for forgiveness said jesus reached in his wounded side and took out some blood like an inkwell took blood on his finger and wrote across the book pardoned and he said he pitched it off behind him in the sea of forgetfulness to never be remembered against him no more and now he's got an attitude adjustment now he goes and he begins to talk to this woman and those men the lord arranged they go away he's starting to talk to her and when he starts talking to her and they start praying and the trooper stops playing the slot machine the boys settle down in the back the men come out nobody knows what to do the presence of god has locked the place up and here's brother branham he's not leading her to the seventh seal he's leading her to christ hallelujah you know what it happened friends i gotta stop i gotta stop i gotta stop you know what had happened this might choke you brother branham had become that bumper he had become that blood bumper why god it's christ in you son of man that's what the seals were open for so that you could be the final voice so that you bloody gospel to the world don't don't condemn them be this be the sacrifice let your life let your life be a life worthy of the gospel of the lord jesus christ let's stand friends that's what that's what god is after to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers oh my hallelujah why don't you bow your head with me all over the building today maybe with your heads bowed now eyes closed no one looking around please even i won't look around to hear a word like you heard today i know that the word sent out abroad enough it was a broad enough word that it would have touched nearly everyone if not everyone in this building and all everyone under the sound of my voice no doubt is god calling on you today has this message to think about where the heart of john was where the heart of abraham was where was the heart what was going on in the heart of esther what was going on in the heart of brother branham from one minute to the next god revealing himself the love of god shown to the world
