bless you we're going to turn right into the Book of Genesis this morning amen I was certainly appreciating brother Jason's Sunday school class good to have him back in the saddle teaching again and uh he and I were uh I sent my scriptures to the booth and he sent back big eyes like what like sorry I didn't mean to plagiarize your scriptures today and I said I said no you you didn't know what I was preaching on today so we were just remarking in the back how similar the foundation of our thinking is and so covet your prayers today I have this ninth uh installment of rebuilding Eden I think it looks to me like I have one more part that I'll get to next time amen be I'll be in North Carolina ministering meetings at Brother Scott Smith for Brother Scott Smith in Lenor North Carolina on that'll be Saturday and Sunday of next week Jason will be covering for us here so you have brother Jason this won't be this one Amen brother Matt will be ministering also for brother Josh Bennett on that same weekend so we greet you God bless still got some visitors with us here today by the time you're hanging in there buddy praise the Lord amen happy to have sister Wanda's mom here with us all the different ones amen God bless you and so um maybe have one more part to get to and was just trying to really weigh in my mind uh which part today and next time how the Lord wanted me to go and so I believe we have it stacked correctly today amen you love the Lord amen did that um get announced uh I don't know if that okay let me let me yeah okay let me let me just grab it right quick uh oh yeah so um apparently there's a shirt order for Camp you need to get that done if you didn't get your shirt order before Camp it's closed you can still place it sister Rachel she'll be submitting the order oh my tomorrow so it's going in and uh we won't be able to add anything to it so if you'd like one I get with her today praise the Lord amen Lord Brother Bob wave at me oh see you standing in front of me so I didn't see you you hear everybody laughing I do that all the time amen I'll be saying I didn't see brother Josh Buckman today here he is so u i do that constantly amen so we're happy to have you and your family here today amen and uh you young people know that U you're um commandant sister Deborah has got your skit practice ready church today so don't forget it because I've given her amen authority to execute capital punishment amen so she was happy so uh anyway Genesis chapter 1 real familiar reading for us and I want to I'm going I send it to the booth specifically because we're going to have to skip a little bit and I'm not going to read everything in order to be too much but we want to catch verse 24 of Genesis chapter 1 verse 24 and God said let the Earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind and it was so and God made the Beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and everything that creepeth upon the Earth after his kind and God saw that it was good amen chapter 2 verse 8 I did not I'm sorry let's go finish back in chapter one verse no oh yeah let's read verse 26 chapter one and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea so you can see why that it there should there's no ambiguity in what a child of God is they're made in His image so that you've heard me talk about when I'm speaking at Men's meetings and I'm speaking to young men I'm saying remember it's an office manhood is an office not not an entitlement because of a gender not just because you're a male as brother brandham said I've seen men 200 pound 6 foot 200 pounds didn't have anounce of man in him because what is a man it's a man living in the image of his maker right but he made male and female made he them and so made he him and so it's it's that's the image of God if you're a child of God you live in the image of God which means you live you look like the word you talk like the word you think like the word you dress like the word you act like the word you react like the word which is what generally gets us in more trouble than our actions our reactions amen amen so uh it's very clear it's it's in pretty clear language to me and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea so it's so your dominion and your Authority and everything is all tied in the proper image of the word and what your faith is and how you conduct yourself is that easy over the foul of the air over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so that's what he did he thought it was a good idea so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and then God blessed them and said be fruitful and multiply replenish the Earth and subdue it have dominion and he goes on and on there so so the The Authority just like I was preaching Wednesday that your we are made made Kings and Priests and the authority of your kingship is grounded in your priesthood because Jesus being the King of Kings yet he's a priest he abideth continually a priest Forever After the order of mzc which was a type of the Bride that's why brother Bram went there constantly to show what you're seeing is the word made flesh now in the body of Christ amen simple stuff all right now chapter 2 verse 8 and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he formed and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now drop down to verse 15 and the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die all right amen let's pray father we thank you for your word today and I ask for your divine blessing upon it bless both speaker and hearer we humble ourselves we have humbled ourselves and as brother Brenham said I humbled myself again Lord I stand here and fresh now I humble myself again before your great presence we commit all the teaching of the word into your hands teach us Lord in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you friends you can be seated if you will allow me just right quick before I get going I want to fix a little um a little statement I made almost like a typo in speech I knew it when I I actually knew it but I didn't catch it until after I got home and I woke up Monday morning and my eyeballs came straight awake and I went oh my gosh did I say that no that's not scriptural and so and so I bounded out of the bed and ran quickly and please please tell me I didn't say that tell me I didn't say that and sure enough I did so uh I just wanted to make a quick correction I like I say I knew it from childhood from Sunday school we all knew that the two daughters that lot remember he had more than the two daughters living at home brother Brown talks about he had married daughters who had married among Society but he had two daughters at home that the Bible cus them maidens they had not known a man and I kind of used a wide brush and washed all the daughters painted all the daughters in the same light and that wasn't actually scripturally accurate not that brother brandham said that but I said it and uh it was um presumptuous and incorrect so I just wanted to fix that right quick just in case uh someone might hear that and wonder and say hey that's not according to Genesis and it's not so now the the point I was making is still valid because they they they were of a of a character like all the rest of the family the point I was making was that here was the point I was making not to be lost on the misspeak uh is the point I was making is that the family of lot became poisoned and contaminated by lot's decision to live in Sodom that's the point and you see that their son-in-laws you know took it all as a big joke and a big haha his wife turned to a pillar of salt his daughters who even the even the ones who married among Society they didn't leave with him and the ones who did got him drunk through through through uh an incestuous affair and and then we realize that even those Nations later on cease to exist okay so we were showing the the difference there between lot as a foolish virgin because he did have a righteous soul and we learn by Matthew 25 that that was the differentiating mark between those who had done all kinds of work works for God and and but it was iniquitous and they were destroyed and those who really couldn't remember doing anything for God but they got eternal life because they were righteous so you you don't you don't you you you don't refer to lot's whole family as foolish virgin only lot as far as I can see in the Bible nonetheless uh I just wanted to make that quick correction now recapping if you will give me just a minute I just want to take maybe five or 10 minutes to recap from part eight because I'm really going into it today more deeply and the point that we were making as we were finishing part eight and I know this because I went back and looked to see what I had said there in the last 10 15 minutes uh that we were we were making the point that that Godly morals and this is really wow is this a big point so I really want to just launch with this one I want it just burned into your mind that that Godly morals and Holiness are embedded in the love of God see so and I say that to counteract the poisonous ideology of today that Godless loves us and it doesn't matter how we live amen like the whole world's going to heaven because we love God and people can live like filthy Sinners but because they say I love Jesus or because they as brother Brandon would say admire the fine qualities of Jesus and they have a a beautiful thought about Jesus and they talk you know very beautifully about him and the love of God and the forgiveness and you know but but yet there's no effective change in their lives and the point to be made is that that that's not the love of God that's a man-made watered down error God's love is even corrective brother brandham called the even the terrible torment that befell the Jews during the second world war as the tender hand of Jehovah love of God is corrective the house this is this is a house of correction see but we do it by showing you that God loves you too much to leave you like he found you man so and and I and I and I really want to show and demonstrate that that the fact that morals and Holiness are embedded in his love that that is actually part of an eternal teaching that's not a new teaching uh that's not even a restoration back to uh uh not that's not even just the restoration of the message of the hour back to the faith of the fathers it even predates the fathers it goes all the way back to the Eden story in Genesis and so we were we were ending part eight uh saying how that that the real correct version of God's love flies in the face face of a modern interpretation of it it brings literally making the statements that I'm making it literally br brings the true word of God into direct conflict with the message of the modern church amen uh about God so loving the world and so he did so love the world that he gave his only begotten son but not to just leave it like it is see so I'll keep going all right let me just keep moving so and then the second point that I made right as I was ending part eight was that the word word of God being Eternal you remember we broke that down there's no old word it's just either original or not original so brother brandham didn't come and preach the spoken word is the old seed he preached the spoken word is the Original Seed so there's no oldfashioned it's just the word it's the same today as it was yesterday and it'll be the same tomorrow and for as many tomorrows as are remaining and then when tomorrows are a thing of the past see brother Jason was making that so clear today in what in the world that we're going to and so we realize that that that being the case and now here I'm really coming to a real theme in my heart that I want to spend some time on is that since the word of God is eternal then that invalidates any idea it invalidates any teaching that came to us from Elijah the prophet Propet in our day the the teachings that he taught about decency and morality and Holiness the fact that the word not just what he taught but the example he lived I'm I'm gonna keep preaching whether I don't get many amens or not and and not only the way he lived but the plain instructions for the way that we should live yeah in this modern world they are it because the word is eternal it it invalidates any argument that would try to say well what he said in 65 is not valid in 2023 it's not incumbent upon us we can water it down this is a modern day that was just his opinion and I end I ended by pointing you back to the Paul to the Apostle Paul saying that this is me not the Lord I think I have the mind of the Lord but here's my advice on it and this is me not the Lord do you think you can toss that out because Paul said this is me not the Lord see so they're just as valid today as they were in 65 so when he went down the line uh to of of what correct decency and morality and Holiness is and how we should conduct ourselves the things that we uh should and shouldn't participate in all the way down to how we dress how we act whether in church whether in public Even in our homes yes because if you're a Christian there's nowhere the Holy Ghost isn't so why would it matter whether you were in church in front of Believers or in the privacy of your home or on a street where you you think no one's watching you know I mean if you think you're born again if you believe that then the Holy Ghost is is abideth it abides forever see and so and I and I I was making the point and this is my last recap point and I'm going to move forward that the teaching if you w to humanize overh humanize now a healthy amount of humanizing William brandom is a good thing because you've got to separate the man born in sin amen the man who ran from the presence of God and laid there with slim playing that that handmade you know where he had a read through a comb and and played it down at the cross where my savior died and 18-year-old Billy brandham looking at those stars above him and he could said I it's like I could hear in the wind Adam son where are you and he said I I I I quickly covered my head I didn't want them to see me crying and I said please sir don't destroy me until I can find out who you are yes see and so we we we realize that you you you've got to think about the office that he had and the fact that he's a man that had flaws and ups and downs and like passions like me and like Elijah who was a man of like passions brother Bram said that many he had his ups and downs oh that's so comforting I'm sorry that that brother Brenham outed Elijah like that but the Apostle had done it before brother brandham did so Elijah just have to deal with it I'm sorry great prophet but we happen to know you got outed you had your ups and downs too like me but you loved God like me and you kept coming back like me and he kept forgiving you like me Hallelujah but we find that that office had a certain degree a an authority so much so so much Authority did this Kentucky hillbury born in sin with ups and downs so much Authority did God place in the office he held that he was empowered to authoritatively indict the entire world as guilty of the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ and said I do this in his name in the presence of the judge himself amen he was the certifying Angel sent to John the angel sent to John clearly was a prophet from the future John was transported to the day of the Lord and to the to the time of judgment and he he tries to worship this certifying Angel who is a prophet from the future and and we we realize then that you can say well he was just a man or he had just an opinion but I'm here to tell you his teaching and his lifestyle and what he said about us was certified by the angel of the Lord by his presence who fellowshipped this Prophet on a regular basis so I denounce as heresy any idea that we can water down what a prophet taught when it comes to Holiness standards and morality and our responsibility to God if you're going to be a believer then please be one all the way and if you if you if you make mistakes well you're like me just Own It repent for it and go on but don't let your life be a statement that is contrary to what has been taught I get we make mistakes I understand that that's not what I'm talking about so did brother Brandon make mistakes that's not what we're talking about we have human Frailty so did he we're not talking about that I'm talking about what's the desire of your heart in your heart do you believe uh do you believe what has been sent they asked Jesus how do we do the works he said here's how you do it believe on him whom God has sent say that was Jesus who do you think was in Elijah who do you think's in you amen Lower Court decisions can only be changed altered or countermanded by higher courts yes until finally you get all the way to what we call here our Supreme Court and it's commonly a western term our supreme court whether you have you know whether you have uh uh a democracy or whether you have a theocracy like or you know like they have in the middle midd East uh they have a supreme decision and and that's it and so you have the Supreme Court and so so anyone coming along now to to overturn the standards of the Believers here at the end time those those claims are invalid see because we already have the decision vision from the unchanging Supreme Court of Heaven now mankind has that's not a That's Not Unusual that's not bad I'm not it's not I'm not even saying something polit Politically Incorrect for goodness sake mankind has sought to bring forth Law and Order since the beginning of time the most ancient civilizations the most ancient dynasties have attempted uh in various ways to make their laws unchangeable immutable and irreversible that's not a new thing man is made in the image of God see so they would they would carve them in solid Stone they would write them on parchment and store them in Secure vaults you can read these things and you with a study of history you find um especially if you read in the book of Ezra about the and the Book of ES and and these various places you'll find that the laws of the mes and the Persians was supposed to be immutable and unchangeable and in fact is that worked in Ezra's favor Ezra and Nehemiah when they went back to rebuild that we found that a former King had given them permission had given them a building permit something we can't seem to get but they gave he gave them a royal building permit and gave them money from the treasury government Treasury and in fact is the Ezra was of such high caliber Ezra had such a reputation uh among the Royal Court that they he was told you don't even need to keep receipts Ezra our trust in you is in emphatic you don't even need to return a report here's the money and here's a letter to all the governors and Mayors and police and everybody where you go if anybody gets in your way I will kill their family I'll kill them I'll kill their animals I'll kill everybody that's how much the king respected so when they then that King passes away and another one comes in who don't know nothing about that and then when the political movement starts up up against Israel rebuilding they start writing letters you need to stop this your majesty these are rebellious people if they get inside of a w city you'll never get them out and you know this king is shocked oh my goodness we we better do something about this and and so they send a cease and desist you got to stop right now well Ezra just writes back and says but we have documentation from your predecessor well when he hears that he's terrified because now he knows oh my goodness I've violated the unviable I'm changing the laws of mes and Persians and quickly go search the records quickly go go over to the uh to the to the Vault and and see if this is valid and they come back and they said indeed it is that that a former King uh he gave permission for this he said well and he tore up the the uh the the order the cease and desist and he reestablished that the these people were to be left alone to finish their job so so you read that I mean all the way back to Magna Carta you can find mankind trying to preserve the idea that we need let's come up with a onized fits-all law that will cover everything we can face and if we ever come up to a situation we'll come back to this document and this will give us guidance the problem is that here we have no continuing City so it didn't matter that the ancient Babylonians did it or the Egyptians did it or the mes and Persians did it or or the you know the English courts in the Middle Ages or our founding fathers you know we don't have a continuing City mankind is perpetually getting worse see and so even the last attempt attempt to establish uh the best government on Earth which of course would have been as the lightning had traveled from the East to the west and come here in America and God establishes our founding fathers to establish a constitutional republic people think we're democracy that's in some ways true it's a bit of a misnomer we're actually a constitutional republic when Ben Franklin left uh there in in Philadelphia and walked out on the street after all of the deliberation and Lady asking this a fact his fact of history uh Mr um Franklin what do we have he says Madam you have a republic if you can hang on to it if you can keep it I think were his words so and because you know it's a constitutional republic a democracy basically just saying um I mean if if if if the whole nation votes you know that that we Le let's let's let's go back to a heinous time if the whole nation votes that we should have slaves and every minority black and brown and yellow should serve the whites if the nation votes for that in majority than a democracy that's it that becomes the law but a constitutional republic says just a second we're going to write a document that's going to fly in the face of that you're going to have to establish it and they made a they made a gallant effort to do that and Men of God uh Men Christian men tried to establish it but the problem was sin problem is sin that's why when Israel wanted a law and and and God gave them a law just to prove to him they couldn't keep it see and and Paul said you know sin took advantage of the law and took advantage of me was the law that was supposed to be for my good ended up being for my death God didn't design it that way the problem wasn't with God or his word the problem was with me I was sinful and so sin took advantage and slew me that's why Jesus came and put us Above the Law and set us up in Grace but I'm here to tell you that's only valid in your life when you're born again of the spirit of God you don't get that by just admiring the fine qualities of Jesus and joining a church you don't get that because you even if you say God sent a prophet his name was William brandom and I believe it the devil knows that and believes the same thing but I'm here to tell you the baptism of the the holy spirit in the New Birth makes you a new creation in Christ Jesus no bones about it aren't pulling any punches it makes you a different person will you do still because you're you're still in a fallen body more about that in a little bit but and and that's why it's the greatest battle ever fall but in your heart your whole desires have turned northward you're looking for the kingdom whose Builder and maker is God so the latest attempt to establish the best government on Earth uh a constitutional republic actually was an experiment I don't know if you realize that but that's it was actually an experiment it never been tried and and and and Lincoln actually at Gettysburg wasn't even sure it could survive he's the one who coined that phrase a government of the People by the people and for the people that's not actually in the constitution of the Bill of Rights that's what Lincoln said and they adopted and said that's what we are and Lincoln is standing there not sure but he hoped that it would never perish from the earth he he makes that clear in his Gettysburg address we we're here to see if this form of government can survive and we see that the last you know here here's the problem that that we were the last best chance for it they' been trying it since ancient Babylon been trying it since nimrod understand they realized that every man just doing what was right in his own eyes coming out of Eden that wasn't working out so good the world you know uh ended up in an anti- deluvian destruction and so after the flood man or begins to organize and Nimrod is actually the first one to do that he's the first one to carry War to his neighbors and and so you're you're seeing civilization and and they're trying to establish it we get all the way down to our to our last day and the lightning has landed here in the west and it's it's it's on the east coast and on the west coast and after you go beyond that you're headed back East again and so the last best chance to get it right after thousands of years since the flood and the last best chance we see that the last best chance is swung you know uh from the left back to the right and then back to the left again all by politics and public opinion so that even your Supreme our Supreme Court can't even establish a law it's only there as long as the political ideology of the day allows it and supports it as soon as men change their mind the Supreme Court gets its its its decisions changed and overturned say well if it's a bad one shouldn't it be overturned sure that's the whole point is that yeah I get it it's it's it's the best way that we can come up within the earth a constitutional republic with three separate branches of government trying to balance each other out but but my point is the best laid plans of mice and men has failed there's only one Supreme Court there's only one supreme judge and we had the highest judge uh send the last star in his right hand this was the last one he had he had already deployed six of them and he's got the last one left and he sends him into the Earth and he establishes h an unchangeable code of what real Holiness is what real morality is what real Christianity is what really the Holy Ghost is and God Vindicated his ministry there's not another star coming there's no further discussion to have or decision to be made or standard to hold our standard to change you know we have the absolute last will and testament of the Angel of the Lord on how we should conduct ourselves as Believers so you disregard those teachings at your own peril yes sir if you don't conduct your family if fathers aren't in their homes conducting themselves in the office the way the message taught then you do that at your own Peril if mothers don't Pastor their children according to the standards that God sent from that last star in his right hand then if you don't follow that you do so at your own Peril say can God still rescue thank God he can can he still help me praise God he can he does he because none of us get it right all the time but I'm glad of God is rich in Mercy it's not what I'm preaching on today I'm preaching on the fact that we cannot move aside you can't move the ancient landmarks God has established the last will in Testament and it's never going to change and I and you say is the rapture coming soon I believe it's already overdue and should be here by tomorrow but if it's not here for another hundred years and I pass away my last breath as a pastor is going to be you can't change the decision [Applause] made that's right see can't change it the great principle and it's it's such a a disease that we're facing in this hour and it was the devil's intentional plan to try to raise and discredit the messenger that's what you do when you've got an unimpeachable witness you try to impeach him when you've got an actual eyewitness which is what William Brandon was he was an eyewitness to what God wanted he was he spoke to the angel of the Lord face to face on many occasions and he his message was certified by an Angel so Satan what what can Satan do he can't it wouldn't do him any good to attack God so he attacks the star and he tries to invalidate so that it puts it in people's mind his his his listen friends his plan was never so grandiose as to think that he was going to get the bride around the world to abandon the message that would have been sheer stupidity Satan's not a dummy but what he did is like in like with balum and the Feast of B peor he he discredited the messenger in in the minds of enough people to where they begin to say well his teachings don't exactly matter it's not incumbent upon me I can wear short skirts trim my hair paint my face up I can drink casually and cuss and run around it it doesn't matter and that's what they do and it's called message light it's a watered down version It's it come from the devil it's going back to the the devil oh I've said it before a woman cutting her hair and wearing pants is not a William brandham teaching the fact that he came and is gone you won't have to face him on that day if you do it sister a woman not cutting her hair is a Paul Doctrine a woman not putting on a garment that pertains to a man is a Moses doctor you're not going to have to worry about brother brandham uh saying why did did you not listen to me you're going to have to face Paul and Moses good luck with that I don't expect that to end well for you I don't care what you've accomplished or what you claim to be your life speaks louder than your words so it's all about the great principle of spiritual warfare in rebuilding Eden that's what this sermon series has been about it's all about being in in Christ as an overcomer overcoming uh spiritual warfare of course starts it has to it it does it not just has to it does factually start with the new birth that's where the spirit the greatest battle ever fought begins it's with the new birth in your soul and and so now here's the rub because while you are born again in your soul the reality is that that that at the same time that my soul is a new creation in Christ I'm still actively living in an unconverted flesh yes amen and that's why it's a Warfare It's The Inside Man fighting daily against the outside man in the greatest battle ever fought see and so what is the war brother Jason I will tell you what I'm fighting for now I don't know what you're fighting for but I'm here to tell you what I'm fighting for and once I tell you maybe you'll understand why I'm at nine Parts deep into this series and with another one in the wings is because to me it's a war to bring my whole being subject to every word of God I'm striving now to be that which will be all natural to me over there yes there's a theophany of me in another realm and that's a word body and I'm fighting every day there's another me I you have heard from your theophany there's another me and I'm fighting every day trying to let God's word be accomplished on Earth as it is in heaven be accomplished on Earth as it is in heaven I'm trying to get to that image that's what the war I'm here to tell it's wor worth fighting for it's worth fighting for friends as I said is your priesthood that that is the grounds and the authority of your of your kingship because your Authority towards men and the the the world the the devil and the Flesh and sin but you're a priest toward God because you're an intercessor and your life lives out a spiritual sacrifice before God and it is in your success as a spiritual sacrifice to God that God then gets behind your Authority and you have authority over sin the World the Flesh and the devil if you're not willing to be a sacrificial uh priest then you'll never have authority and you'll wonder forever why your life can't have any Victory and any power and Everything You Touch uh gets ruined I'm here to tell you there is a real power that God wants to bring upon us and have us work working sir there's no way to do it if your priesthood isn't in place with the help of the Holy Ghost we become willing to die to self daily amen with the help of the Holy Ghost I willingly lay aside the weights and sins that pull at the sinful nature of My unconverted Flesh if I don't do that if I give my eyes and ears to the things of the world then I'm not laying aside the things that beset me and if you choose to live that way don't be amazed that you get beset and there's nothing I can do for you all I have all I see friends you're so nice to me all these years and the respect that you've given me I was I I I was just there U among the uh black churches there all the many of the Colombia churches had gathered around and brother Benny Perry's meetings it was so good to renew old acquaintance and my goodness the hospitality was just at another level and I just was I came to the pull pit on Sunday to express my gratitude you know the way I would express my gratitude to you today and say I I wish I could give you something back for all the years of loyalty I wish I could repay you uh for all of your kindness and your Allegiance and how many how you pray for me and and and you love me and you love my family and and and and and I think what what's the greatest thing the greatest thing that I that if I could give you anything that's the the the greatest possible thing would be to give you eternal life however that's not mine to give I'm not in a position to give you eternal life but what I can do is give you that which will lead you there I can give you the word and that word if you'll believe it and follow the word you'll get home see so we must make these decisions to lay us aside the things don't you know don't don't wait to lay aside a sinful thing lay aside the thing that leads you to the sinful thing don't wait for the carnality lay aside the thing that bait you toward it see when you when you can look into the mirror of God's word and I'm watching my time I'm just going to try to get so far today friends when you can look into the mirror of God's word and and this is the mirror of God's word it shows a man or woman what they really are whenever that happens to you and you come here and the Lord reveals to you who you really are under the anointing right now cuz see right now I've already cast out a bunch of devils I've been standing here for the last 40 minutes that's what I've been doing brother M said the the preaching of the Gospel cast out Devils cast out demons another place he said the preaching of the Gospel drives back spirits of unbelief so I've shoved them out the door and squeezed them out the windows now you can make an honest decision but whatever the Lord has showing you right now while you're sitting here in his presence don't go out that door and forget the person that the word showed you you really were with all of the holes and your and your deficits and the Holy Spirit is showing you what you need to fix and you go right out out the door and forget that you even needed to fix them you forget that you even had them to fix see so because when you can look in the mirror of God's word and you can see that you are allowing ungod ungodly carnality see and and yet brother Brandon would say remember Sister say I've got the Holy Ghost he said just think about what you're saying remember Sister he's a holy spirit he's not a filthy spirit and again I I'm not talking about stumbling at it which we always do uh you know but I'm talking about when you when you can in real honesty and you can see that you are allowing that thing to live on your surface come on friends that's why we have the house of God it's a house of judgment it's a house of correction I'm here to condemn it I'm trying to wash you clean by the washing of the water of the word don't resist it don't resist at whatever you do don't feel hard at me don't feel bad at me just say Lord help me so you might want to sometimes I wonder and again I and I've grappled with this question I'm sure it's some of both there's no way it wouldn't be but I'm in preaching this series I've said repeatedly I'm preaching to Believers Now by that I mean people who are born again and I don't just mean people who say they are I really believe I'm preaching to Born Again people but but I'm here to tell you that the evidence of the new birth the best evidence that the angel of the Lord told the signifying Angel to tell you and me was that the ability from your heart to say Amen to every word is the evidence of the new birth you understand so I I get that we stumble I get that we make mistakes but I just want to say to you friends if you find yourself like Jesus said that in your heart the desire of the world is still there and you're only obeying it because you don't want to go to hell or you don't want to miss the Rapture or you know you should do right but that desire I'm not talking about your flesh gets tempted with I'm talking about your desire to be clean before God or not and you don't you you're just grinding it out by your own uh willpower listen friends that's what we have an altar for and this altar is today and I don't care if you've been in a message church or even this message church since its Inception if the love of the world is still in your heart it's because you've never come to a full new birth and you've never you've never repented sufficiently for God to see that it was sufficient to give you the sealing experience of the Holy Ghost that's the plain teaching of the word of God you need a deeper revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally see and so because you you just might be missing a level you think you have but don't see because the true revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally that is the new birth and it and it does bring your will subject to every word it does it's not it's I fail to let it bring it to my flesh but he has not failed to bring it to my heart you understand see so according to the Bible only those say why did you make the statement you fear for people like that who maybe sit in message churches but they never really uh you never see the carnality leave you never you never really see the decision made and you see them accepting a watered down you say I fear I've said I fear for you come Rapture time so why why would you say that brother Jason because according to the Bible do you believe the Bible according to the Bible only those who have the full experience of the new birth only those who are sealed into the kingdom by God by the Holy Ghost are the only ones going in the rapture they're the only ones because they're part of the first resurrection they've passed from Death to life and can never come into the judgment and they achieve this by a heartfelt willingness to say Amen to every word of God without exception which is what true and full repentance is this is the level of repentance that entitles you to the token see the the only requirement was to repent that was it what shall we do they said to Peter repent see because because repentance is your willingness to completely die say well I did repent but I still didn't get it I still have these dis that's because you didn't repent far enough if you leave even one grain in your heart the devil will just start back there and rebuild his whole Kingdom again you've got to come to the point where you have met Christ and you don't want to be you anymore you want to be him and the every every fiber of your being you're not perfect you got sins you've got weaknesses yes yes yes yes get that I understand that the Lord understands that don't worry he'll take you on from repentance to baptism and he'll take you from baptism to church and he'll start teaching you the word and cleaning you up and you'll get strength but you first got to repent fully see you'll never do that doubting the word are trying to water it down you'll go your whole life you'll come to this church and the Rapture will come and you'll still be at this church so that's that's the level that entitles you to the token and of course need I remind you the token is your ticket to the old chip um your token is what allows you to get on the glorybound train because you've heard the voice of the resurrection and so I I I don't remember if I've made this statement in the series prior but if I have the holy spirit's prompting me to say it again there's a great distance between knowing him and knowing about him amen there's a great distance between knowing him and knowing about him we read uh it was remarkable to us all I two or three parts ago I forget part 5 six somewhere around in there best I can remember where he was saying remember Lot's wife and that was a prophecy for us at the end time remember Lot's wife don't get tricked don't get fooled yes she got out but her heart was still back there remember Lot's wife see to know him because because to know him is life you understand to know him is to know him in the power of his resurrection to know him is to know him in the fellowship of his sufferings to know him is being made conformable unto his death Paul said that I may know him a big difference from that to knowing just knowing about him that's part of the suffering that's part of the priesthood when you're willing to die with Christ and you're willing to become an outcast from the world you are or you aren't how many today are willing to say I will take the way with the Lord's despise few and I will be an outcast because I'm looking for another world this is exactly why see the you you you no longer want to be like Lot's wife this is exactly why God sends forth his faithful ministers this is why they call for surrender service after service they constantly cry it's why I constantly cry for sincerity and dedication before the Lord see because I know that the modern influences of Sodom are constant I know they're constantly upon you and they press upon us and and even Believers and even his true family are not exempt from that see they press upon us and and so his true ministers can never and may I say to my own team here we can never Brothers we can never and we must never stop compelling greater sincerity and greater dedication because the assault from the Sodom uh uh age affects our minds it affects your children it affects children who maybe aren't even born yet and so for as long as we stand in this pull pit we've got to hold up the Blood Stained banner and declare what God has said and that the family of God are made in the image of God amen amen they're made in the image of God I've been about exactly one hour I want another 15 minutes you good I going to take it regardless but I just want to ask you so let's have my uh PowerPoint guys rebuilding Eden this is part nine almost home brother brandham says um let's see whoops I turned it off I don't have anything on that screen so if we can figure that out so I can read it from there what is it oh okay never mind then I'll just I'll just turn here all right so brother brandham says here in the adoption series but the Believers the Caleb and Joshua outfit want to be a part of that amen praise the Lord that was going on to the promise they moved on over into the land and took the land and settled down in the land as a possession and we never stop at justification sanctification let's go on to the baptism of the Holy Spirit let's not stop at Believing on the Lord Jesus being baptized let's not stop stop because he cleaned us up from a life of sin but now we press on into a possession did I uh uh into a position to a promise there it is into a position to a promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost now so so I I want you to notice this so so what a prophet is trying to get you to understand here's one of the points is that when you think of the term position we press on into a position to a promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost so the baptism of the Holy Ghost equals position easy that's not Einstein formula that's just baptism of the Holy Ghost equals position see so the position uh the position is what gives me you know it's it's what gives me The High Ground in this war that's what Caleb when he took the mountain then he had The High Ground then when somebody comes to try to take it from him he's got The High Ground I'm here to tell you that your baptism and the Holy Spirit yes it's a greatest battle it's the greatest battle ever fought but you're holding The High Ground this is this is the position that makes me a high priest and if I'm a high priest then I have Authority for my kingship see this is the position that gives me Rank and Authority in the chain of command this is what enables me to have power over the devil and the world and sin in the flesh because I've come into a position in Christ Jesus so he goes on and oops how how how do we get there uh I must not have put that last part in let me just read it before we switch so he says so Ephesus here sets us like Joshua positionally you notice Joshua after crossing over the land and taking the land then he divided the land Ephraim here Manasseh here and this one here and Gad here Benjamin here see divided lands he's got Authority because he's got a position cuz he crossed over you see so we teach that moving on to the promised land of the Holy Ghost is the full birth it's the seed coming to life in manifestation that's what the new birth is brother brandom I'm going to give you from 1965 who is this mzc to settle this issue of what is when we say the baptism of the Holy Ghost please tell me that in planer language that's a broad term what does that even mean all right thank God we've got a prophet and then when you become subject to that Spirit it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that Spirit now this is the new birth and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest or quickened Hallelujah Made Alive and when the Bible said don't do this that body quickly turns to it there is no question and what is it it's the earnest of the Resurrection this body will be raised up again because it's already started what a beautiful way to say it see it was once subject to sin and mire and Corruption but now it's got the earnest it's turned Heavenly now that's the earnest that you're going in the Rapture it's the earnest so it's a gene seed of God that has been quickened by a revelation of the word and it's a a new creation inside you the old nature of the spirit is annihilated and you've got a war on your hands cuz now there's an inner man saying to the outer man Shape Up and the outer man says but I still I don't want to shape up but the inner man says greater am I than you because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world greater is he that is in my soul than he that is in my flesh all I got to do say well how do I make that army WR strong he feeds on the word lay aside the things that weaken him am see lay aside the things that weaken him so this is why I keep saying that the lon share of this series is preached more to believers who are already born again see uh but but listen let me just say it like this even if that's true and even if you've crossed into the promised land they still had to fight Caleb still had to take his Mountain you understand the Holy Ghost New Birth gives you the rights to it but you still got to go get it you still got to lay aside the weights and sins you still got to add to Faith and virtue knowledge you still got to bring every thought subject to the spirit you still got to cast down vain imaginations Paul said to Born Again people who had been born again for 30 years I would that you'd be filled with all the fullness of God see so they still to be born again the Bible says to fight the fight of Faith give me uh brother Mark give me first Timothy 6 I want to read this before I close and we'll grab one more scripture and then we're then we're done for today I want to make this statement we're going to 1 Timothy 6 because we're about to make a statement where the Bible tells you to fight you born again people fight the fight of Faith 1 Timothy 6 verse 11 and 12 but thou oh man of God flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness Faith love patience and meekness if they can't get it it's all right I'm quoting it to you so now here's the first thing he doesn't open up with but thou sinful man he opens up with but thou oh man of God well I'm already born again well oh good now start fleeing man of God start fleeing these things and follow after righteousness God and his faith love patience meekness why would Paul need to say that see because you've crossed over but you still got to take a mountain and then you got to hold that mountain don't think the devil's just going to walk away verse 12 fight the good fight of Faith lay hold man of God lay hold on eternal life I thought I already had it we're now moved to another section you got to fight the fight of Faith man of God daughter of God you're born again of the spirit of God now get Fighting fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life wherein to Thou Art also called and H has professed a good profession before many witnesses pressing toward the Mark is that's all brother Mark pressing uh pressing toward the Mark I was going to read Philippians 3:12 we've read it plenty of times pressing toward the Mark is not said to unbelievers pressing toward the Mark is not s head to the unconverted because first of all that would be the cart ahead of the horse it's not pressed for a new birth but it's those who have been born again who are believers reach for the mark for the prize of the High Calling take your Mountain it's a high calling it's a high ground it's a place of authority see that's why brother Brandon would say we need more Queens of Sheba we need Queens of Sheba we need dedicated Joshua and Caleb's amen praise the Lord Brother Bob I preached recently on girl power I took the you should have seen all these young sisters sat straight up in their seat preached on girl power preached on the Queen of Sheba we preached on Rahab the Harlot Hallelujah God bless you stand to your feet with me we'll stop right there today amen all friends I want to see us press toward this Mark Press toward this High Calling do you want to press is that you today oh to say Lord help me give me courage give me strength maybe you came here today A little foggy on where you are and what you need to be doing you know something's not exactly right amen I want to live the way he wants me to live brother Andrew brother Tony bow your heads with me all over the [Music] building thank you Lord thank you for coming and being the preacher today you saw the little bit of tension I was under trying to figure out between what exactly you wanted for this day for this audience I don't even know who'll be here next time when we bring that what looks to be that 10th and final part but I know that everybody that you wanted to be here today and everybody that's streaming you saw before the foundation of the world I want to thank you for helping me Lord I want to thank you for helping these people I want to make I want you to Lord move on further now because I'm taught to ask you for big things and so I know that I a little fish need not worry about draining the ocean a little mouse under the under the Grainer of Egypt need not worry about eating he can

Lord I'm asking you to do even more now I'm praying Lord God that the word of God will have such a profound effect it'll answer questions it'll move aside confusion and debris it'll make the word clear and plain Lord the let the people who now see themselves in the image of God's word don't let them go out of here and forget what type of person the word showed them that they were may they make that that necessary adjustments that necessary change that necessary death that necessary repentance Lord we're going to sing the songs of Zion here just in a moment but I'm praying that all we're doing now from here the word has been preached it's gone forth It's a seed it's good seed you said it was Jesus you called it a seed and it's good seed it'll grow if it's planted in in the heart and watered and cared for and nurtured it'll grow it'll turn our lives into a Garden of Eden Lord we're rebuilding Eden we know the Millennium will be Eden continue it continued Eden part two Lord I I long for that day but I know that the bride that's taken from this world will already be very close to that life and so I pray you will help us now to get closer and closer under rededication water
