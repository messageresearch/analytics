It's good to be here tonight. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's been a long time. Uh it's been a [music] while. I think the last time I was here maybe was like 2016 [music] or 2017, but we're happy to be here and we bring you greetings uh from a little church um on the other side of Charlotte, North Carolina. Uh Mount Olive, North Carolina. The pastor there is Leon Vanard and uh we're a little small church over there most time our pastor said u it's a little hole in the wall but we love the Lord over there and God has been wonderful to us and uh it's and [music] uh thank God for my wife to come with us as well. Amen. So we won't do no any singing. Uh uh I know it's a little different from some of you normally [clears throat] &gt;&gt; love for me to sing, but perhaps uh after we we finish uh I know it's Wednesday night and and I I want to consider that. Amen. And we just appreciate brother pastor giving us this opportunity. &gt;&gt; Amen. To spend with you tonight. You love the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have uh we have uh three passages of scripture, but we'll just read one scripture and we let you be seated. Would that be all right? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's Luke the 18th chapter and we read from verse 1 to verse 8. Amen. You have it by saying, "Amen." [clears throat] &gt;&gt; I'm good. I'm good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everyone hears me? Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Right. There we go. There we go. It's on. It's right now. &gt;&gt; Is it on now? &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. uh you there by saying amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Luke the 18th chapter verse one and it reads and he spake a parable unto them to the end that man ought always to pray and not to faint. Saying there was in a city a judge which fear not God neither regard man. And there was any and there was a widow in that city. And she came unto him, saying, "Avenge me of my adversary." And he would not for a while, but afterward he said within himself, though I feared not God, nor regard man, yet because this widow truth me, I will avenge her. I I will avenge her, lest by her continually coming she weary me. And the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust judge said. And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cries day and night unto him, though he beared long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speededly. Nevertheless, when the son of man cometh, shall he find faith &gt;&gt; on the earth. &gt;&gt; Let us just bow our heads again. Kind heavenly father, Lord Jesus, we thank you, Lord Jesus, for uh for being here, Father, we just thank you for the reading of the word. Father, we just pray, oh God, that you bless the hears tonight, Father. Lord, you said we that have an ear to hear. Oh God, let us hear what the spirit have to say into the church. Father, will you take these dry lips of clay and Father, may you speak to our hearts, Father. You know the condition of your people, Lord. You know what they need, Father. And Lord, we depending on you tonight. We thank you in advance. We thank you for deliverance. We thank you for setting the captain free. We thank you for just being God. Thank you for your presence here tonight, Lord. Lord, you said in your word where there's two or three, you're in the midst. And so, Lord, we believe that. And Father, we act upon it this. We asking G asks in Jesus name by saying, "Amen." You may uh take your seat. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, my brother. Amen. It's wonderful to be in the house of the Lord. My thought tonight [clears throat] by the help of the Lord uh bless the Lord. Uh my thought is uh it's revelation pardon me Luke the 18th chapter in the 8th verse and I read it again and here Jesus saying and I tell you that he will avenge them speededly nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth. So my thought tonight is shall he find faith on the earth? Now while we uh you still have your Bible, let's turn to uh Malachi 4, if you will. Malachi 4, you familiar with that scripture, I'm sure. Mal Malachi 4 and verse 5. Malachi 4 and verse 5. And it reads, "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. How many you believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to the father, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now we turn to last scripture. We turn to Revelation uh 10. Uh you familiar with that as well. Revelation 10 and uh we start from verse one and to verse 7. Would that be okay? And it reads, "And I and and I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillow of fire. And he had in his hand a little book open, and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth. And he cried with a loud voice. And when he had and when and when a he cried with a loud voice as when a lion royeth. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. And when the seven thunder had uttered their voices, I was about to write. And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, "Seal up those things which the seven thunder uttered, and write them not." And the angel which I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven, and swear by him that liveth forever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are in the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which there are therein, that there should be time no longer. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when it shall begin to sound, when he begin to sound, the mysteries of God should be finished. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So tonight, uh praise [clears throat] the Lord. Uh again, my my thought is uh when [clears throat] uh shall he find faith on the earth? It's talking about this earth. &gt;&gt; It's talking about where you and I live &gt;&gt; when he return. Will he find faith? Now you know uh uh Jesus uh many of time when Jesus will will will uh talk to his believers uh he will mention more about his second coming than when he was on earth. But the thing was, when I return, will I find faith on the earth? That's that's the thing. &gt;&gt; And he didn't say, "When I come to church, well, I found uh people at the altar praying." &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "When I come to church, uh uh will I will I find people uh uh uh praising the Lord? Will I find the church filled up? Uh will will I will I find uh the podium filled up with ministers?" Uh he didn't say none of that. He said when I return will I find faith? That's the thing. So uh we realize that uh Jesus uh you know the question is will I find faith and we know that the prophet of God taught us faith is a revelation and how we really need revelation in this hour brother and sister. You know, we're living in an hour where, you know, when you talk about the Bible, this this B IBL E, you know, it's the basic instruction before we leave the earth. But when you talk about the Bible, now Satan, he hates the Bible or he just hate the Bible. But there's one uh there's two particular scriptures that he hate the worst. The prophet of God taught us that is Genesis and is Revelation. So we realize that Genesis is a sea chapter. Amen. It tells the beginning. Amen. But Revelation tells the end. Amen. And by Revelation being revealed to us. Amen. We begin to realize who we are and what we are raised up for. You know, brother and sister, I'm just not here tonight uh just to say, you know, I want to come and preach here. I believe with all my heart we're here to do the king's job. Amen. We're not here just to say, you know, Brother Jason, uh, he's my friend. I love Brother Matt. We all that's been done away with. We want to be led by the Lord. The Bible say they that are led by the spirit, they are the sons of God. And brothers and sisters, I believe tonight that I'm speaking to people here tonight that actually come from God. I believe brother and sister we I'm talking to people tonight that was in the very PART THE VERY back part of God's mind but now you are being made manifested do you believe that tonight &gt;&gt; will I find faith on the earth Jesus asked the question when I when I return shall I find faith on the earth oh praise the Lord and you found out that when Jesus was on the earth amen he began to talk with it disciples. And uh when he began to talk to disciples, you found out in Luke, you don't have to turn Luke 17 and verse 22, he said and he said unto his disciple, though those was the elected one, those was chosen. He said, "The days will come when you shall desire to see one of the day of the son of man, &gt;&gt; and you shall not see it." Wow. Ye shall desire to see one of the days of the coming of the son of man. Are you with me tonight? Now Jesus was saying something but he told disciples you know he says and brothers and sisters the thing that we are being witnessing of the thing that God has began to show to us. Amen. These are the things that prophet desire to look upon brother and sister with this is one of the greatest hour of all time. You know I don't understand why sometime you know I can't wait till Wednesday night come because amen I feel THE URGE AND AMEN I just can't wait till THOSE DOORS OPEN JUST TO hear what God have to say because BROTHER AND SISTER I I'M NOT PLANNING ON BEING HERE. I was telling the pastor in the back, I was telling the pastor in the back, you know, I was talking to uh uh my wife's uncle the other day and he was talking about just a few days ago and he said, you know, I don't the way things going on and all the killing and and and and the filth and and all these things happening on the earth. And he began to say, you know, he said, I can't see we being here another 50 years. I don't even want to hear that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was my wife and I, we was fortunate enough to have six grands &gt;&gt; and you know I one of our grants live with us and she nine years old and her name is Hadassa. I don't want to look at her and say Hadasa I can't wait to see you graduate from college. &gt;&gt; She only n years old. You know how much it's you you think about from 9 years old until she get out of college and you see how terrible &gt;&gt; this world has become. &gt;&gt; Brother, I don't understand you know why people are looking for a long stretch out now. I'm not trying to tell you and you know I'm not trying to tell you YOU KNOW TO START PLANNING. WE SHOULD. BROTHER BRANDON SAID AMEN. IF WE going to DIG TERS KEEP DIGGING TERS. IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANOTHER ROOM ON THE HOUSE, ADD ANOTHER ROOM. ARE YOU HEARING ME? BUT ALWAYS LOOK FOR HIM TO COME. AMEN. CUZ I BELIEVE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, WE ARE JUST THAT CLOSE. &gt;&gt; IT'S NO TIME TO BE PLAYING CHURCH. I BELIEVE WE ARE SO CLOSE, CHURCH. I'M LOOKING FOR HIM AT any time. &gt;&gt; That's the God heaven truth. Now, I'm going to say something. Y'all may think I'm crazy, but I really don't care. &gt;&gt; I've been through enough. I really don't care. I'm not a man pleaser. I'm going to preach what I got to preach. I'd reckon we could go back in the hotel AND MY WIFE AND I, WE GOING BACK NORTH. BUT I want to tell you, church, I'm I'm living in a time, church. It's time to get real serious with God. &gt;&gt; Now, when Paul said in I think in 2 Corinthians 13 and5, if I'm not mistaken, he said, "Examine yourself." &gt;&gt; Examine yourself. Now, the word of God did not tell me uh to examine brother Matt's life. &gt;&gt; God didn't tell me uh to go by his house and see how he's treating his wife. That's not in the word. &gt;&gt; He didn't tell me to find out, go on YouTube and go on the church channel and watch the service and see how they're worshiping. &gt;&gt; That's your business how you worship. But the Bible tell me to examine yourself &gt;&gt; and see whether you &gt;&gt; be in the faith. &gt;&gt; Now let's stop there a minute. Examine yourself &gt;&gt; and see rather Paul said that you be in not a faith &gt;&gt; but the faith. &gt;&gt; Faith has a level. Now brothers and sisters, the faith that Jesus was talking about, he said, "When I return back to earth, will I find faith?" &gt;&gt; You know, and you know, if if we talking about uh a a faith, you know, that you know, pastor, you know what the Lord did for me? What pastor, I've been praying and uh my credit's not real good. And believe it or not, pastor, I had faith. And I went on that parking lot and I claimed it in the name of Jesus. And guess what? Before I know it, I was riding in that car. &gt;&gt; And the pastor said, "Oh my God, that is faith." That's good. &gt;&gt; But that's not the faith I'm talking about. If that's the faith, then uh the witch doctor has faith. &gt;&gt; Denomination has faith. &gt;&gt; So that's a different faith we talking about. &gt;&gt; So it look like God is trying to tell us this faith it had to be contended for. &gt;&gt; This faith has to be restored. Amen. &gt;&gt; This faith have to be RESTORED BY MALACHI 4. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So, brother and sister, that's what we want to know. That's I'm going go ahead and take this jacket off. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That faith has got to be restored back. So Jesus was saying, "When I return, will I find faith on the earth?" But how many are so happy to know? Amen. We don't have to be worried about a thing. We don't have to wonder uh will I be left behind. &gt;&gt; Don't have that type of mind. &gt;&gt; I want to believe tonight that he can't leave without me. &gt;&gt; I believe, brother and sister, I believe that I was in in the back part of God's mind before there was a world. Are y'all hearing me tonight? Before there was a star. BEFORE THERE WAS A MOLECULE, before there was anything, I was in the back part OF GOD'S MIND. SO WHEN I WAS IN GOD'S MIND, BROTHER, SISTER, we were the very attributes of God. And you know what GOD DID, BROTHER? YOU AND I WAS IN HIS MIND. Can I preach a little bit? Can I just preach tonight? Amen. Now, WE WAS IN THE MIND OF GOD. BUT WHEN GOD GAVE BIRTH TO HIS TO THAT THAT GENESIS GENESIS 1 AND THREE, AMEN. WHEN GOD SAID, "LET THERE BE LIGHT." BROTHER BRANDON SAID THAT LIGHT CAME OUT. &gt;&gt; WHERE WAS YOU and I? &gt;&gt; Who said that? &gt;&gt; You was a part of him. &gt;&gt; You were his thought. &gt;&gt; You know what I love about God? God don't change his mind. &gt;&gt; We stumble. We mess up. We get discouraged. We allow we allow what Paul said, condemnation just get you to feeling guilty. But let me tell you what, church. Let me tell YOU WHAT. THE DEVIL CANNOT stop a true bride of Christ when you begin to recognize who you are and what you are RAISED UP FOR. THE DEVIL IS in trouble. &gt;&gt; You young people, you understand what I'm saying? I don't want to preach. I I I want to go I want to kind of uh go a little deep tonight, but I'm going to see where the Lord take me. I don't know. I hope you hang in with me. We're going to go for a ride, sir. &gt;&gt; But do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Oh, man. I feel at home. I'm going to tell y'all something. I'm going to say it. I didn't want to say it. Uh I called the pastor and I hadn't been here since 2017. And uh you know uh brother Brandon says, "Was a dream, tell it like take is a dream." You know, I ain't trying to make nothing out of that cuz dream is not always an absolute. But I just want to say that the dream came to pass. So in my dream uh I was dreaming and in the dream I saw a burgundy Ford pickup. Then when I saw the burgundy Ford pickup and next from the burgundy Ford pickup the scene changed. And guess what I saw church? What I saw? I was looking from this direction and this is what I saw. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I had been here about eight years. But from the Ford truck, I saw this. &gt;&gt; I I got up out of the bed. My wife was asleep. I said, "My the devil said, "Don't call him. Don't call him. He's not going to let you preach. Don't call him. Don't call him." But see, I didn't pay him no attention. &gt;&gt; I got out of the bed. I took my phone and I shot him a text. about eight years now. &gt;&gt; So, I went back in the bedroom and I told my wife, I said, "Honey, I said, uh, I just shot a text to a pastor." I said, "I hadn't been there in a long time." So, she named a couple of pastors. I said, "No." And, uh, I said, "I hadn't been there in a long time." And uh, and I said, "Well, we going to try the spirit." I said, "We have to go from there." Then I heard my phone saying bling. I go and pick it up. He said, you know, he's he'd be more than happy to have me, you know. So we here tonight. So that being said, I believe I'm in the perfect will of God. &gt;&gt; And you know, and I I I believe church Jesus was very concerned because he saw the condition of time. Remember now what Jesus was talking about. He said, "When the son of man come," now now I'm not a son of man. Are you hearing me? But what Jesus saw was his returning back. And he said, "When I come back, will I find faith?" &gt;&gt; So, we're living in an hour where people are really actually cooling off. &gt;&gt; OH MY MY. CAN YOU IMAGINE? We're living in an hour when people are really cooling off. Brothers and sisters, there's no time to cool off. There's no time to uh look back. We got to move forward because I believe with all of my heart, I believe we are so close. &gt;&gt; Now, now, now I'm going to say something and you young people going to really think I'm crazy. Now, I'm going to tell you where I'm at right about now. I'm so much looking for, you know, a lot of time you say you you you it's okay to come down here. &gt;&gt; I I need some walking room. &gt;&gt; Next time we're going to have to move some of these things cuz I just love to walk. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you know, a lot of time we we you know, people people will say, you know, uh I'm I'm ready to go. I want to see Jesus and and I I you know, I'm ready for the rapture to take place because I just want to see Jesus. You know, I just want to look upon his face. But you know, we all want to do that, right? &gt;&gt; We all would love to. How many would love to look upon his faith? How many would love when this rapture take place? The first faith, the when this rapture take place, when the changing OF THESE BODY, HOW MANY WOULD JUST LOVE TO look at Jesus face? BUT I GOT GOOD NEWS FOR YOU. THE FIRST FACE YOU WILL SEE WILL NOT BE JESUS. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT THE BIBLE SAY. IF YOU GOT A BROTHER, OH, YOU GOING TO SEE GRANDPA. ARE YOU HEARING ME? THE FIRST FACE YOU WILL SEE IS YOUR LOVED ONE. You said, "WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT, BROTHER CHILDREN?" PAUL SAID, "AMEN. THE DEAD IN CHRIST SHALL RISE WHAT?"

Next time I come back, I hope I can come back. This I preach. One brother told me, "Brother Matt, I might have to get that mic." Huh? This ain't gonna It don't work with a preacher like me. I was at brother Don Reagan. I was dragging the microphone on the floor and and I was wondering what was going on. I I thought someone was cutting me off, but Amen. &gt;&gt; alive and remain. &gt;&gt; Alive and remain. There's a lot of people, they're alive, but they're not remain. &gt;&gt; They're not remaining in the truth. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So, people are looking for the coming of the Lord. THEY'RE LOOKING BUT A LOT OF FOLKS. BROTHER BRANDON said there's going to be millions that's going to be mimics and sell there's going to be a lot of people that's going to be ACTING CHRISTIAN. NOW YOU KNOW BROTHER Brandon said there's two type of Christian. How many you know that? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; How many know that? You know that sister. Oh praise. There's two type of Christian. There's one with the Holy Ghost and the other don't. &gt;&gt; Huh? But because the word Christian is Christlike. SO YOU CAN COME TO CHURCH with a long dress on, long hair. That don't mean it's in your soul. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN HE COME BACK, I WANT TO BE READY. ARE you hearing me? I WANT TO HAVE ON MY WEDDING GARMENT BECAUSE church look &gt;&gt; since you know what been happening. Well, you got a smile on your face. I'm telling you. I thank God you're in the front cuz I don't need nobody sad up here. I need all happy face. Happy face. Happy face. Are you hearing me? SO WE LIVING IN AN HOUR, CHURCH. IT'S SO CLOSE TO THE COMING OF THE LORD. AND YOU MIGHT BE think I'm crazy, but I'm looking now BECAUSE WHAT GOD HAS BEEN REVEALING to me when God, you know, the Bible, brother brother Matt, the Bible has become a a what? &gt;&gt; Talk to me. &gt;&gt; I I love for y'all to Oh my. The Bible had become a what? &gt;&gt; A new book. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; But you know, a lot of people still don't understand. But I thank God that God sent a prophet in this hour. Amen. Oh, praise the Lord. You know, a lot of people don't like you to preach that way, but I feel like I'm at home. Amen. Amen. So, let me tell you, church, it's getting to a place now. God started revealing this word. And I feel in my heart that we are so close until just the OTHER DAY, I WAS IN MY CLOSET AND I DECLARE I THOUGHT I SAW SOMEONE IN THE CORNER. OH, YOU MIGHT BE THINK I'M CRAZY. LOOK, [screaming] I AM LOOKING FOR MY MAMA. &gt;&gt; MY MOTHER BEEN GONE FOR 34 YEARS. BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHAT, WHEN SHE COME, I'M GOING TO RECOGNIZE HER. BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHAT, BUT BEFORE SHE COME, WHEN CHRIST COME, HE GOT TO FIND SUCH FAITH ON THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; My faith on the earth. People can't ought to heal the headache. &gt;&gt; My but I'm coming back shall I find faith on the earth. &gt;&gt; Jesus began to talk to the disciples and we realize that the coming of Christ comes three times. Are y'all with me? &gt;&gt; He come the first time as a redeemer, right? And the second time is the rapture, right? And the third time, if that's when he comes and he reigns, he sits on David's throne. That's right. &gt;&gt; Are y'all with me? I love you. I love it tonight. Amen. But let me tell you what, Jesus, there is there is three comingings of the son of man, right? &gt;&gt; And I love that. Y'all talk back to me. Man, I feel so good tonight. Oh, Lord have mercy. How many of you got to go to school tomorrow? Could you miss one day? [snorts] But see, there are three comingings of the son of man. Lord help us tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I thank God that it the Bible said, you remember in Matthew the 13th chapter and probably verse 10 uh and disciples Jesus was talking with the the believers of that day. And Jesus said, Jesus began to tell them was talking to them in parables. &gt;&gt; And the disciples asked him a question. They said, "Why do you you you talking parables and and things of that nature." But what Jesus said, "It is given to you &gt;&gt; to know the mystery." You know what I found? A lot of people, brother Matt, you know, WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT MYSTERY, THEY turn you off. I had somebody told me, "We don't need to know all those mystery. We just need to know that Jesus died on the cross and you know and all that. You know what you got? You're going to be preaching that kind of revelation. You're going to be right here. &gt;&gt; We need revelation more than you can imagine. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? IT'S GOT TO BE REVEALED to us. Brother Brandon said the bride of Christ will be waiting on the revelation of the rapture. ARE YOU HEARING ME? I BELIEVE BROTHER AND SISTER WE ARE LIVING IN THOSE HOUR. THIS IS THE HOUR WHERE GOD IS LOOKING FOR A CHURCH. AND TO THINK ABOUT IT, HE SAID, "WHEN I RETURN, WILL I FIND A CHURCH ON FIRE?" &gt;&gt; WILL I FIND A CHURCH ON FIRE? YOU SAID, "WAIT A MINUTE, brothers and children." So, what you want us to do? You want us to get say amen and holler and and scream, "No, you don't have to do a thing, but just pull. &gt;&gt; Will I find a church &gt;&gt; on fire?" &gt;&gt; So, we see the coming of the son of man. Now when Jesus was on the earth, we look at in the book of Luke, he began to talk with his disciples. He began to tell them different thing and and when Jesus came on the earth, he was fulfilling scripture. &gt;&gt; He knew exactly who he was. &gt;&gt; Do you know who you are? So Jesus would tell the disciples uh Jesus knew that it was prophesized of him in Deuteronomy the 18th chapter and I believe the 15th verse where he said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like unto me. So when Jesus was on the earth he was a prophet. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But he began to talk with his disciples. He began to work with his disciple. But let me come on down now. One thing I love about Jesus, Jesus had three pull to his ministry. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right, sister. &gt;&gt; He had three pulls. Boy, I love this. I love when the young people can shake their head. Oh my. I know I got to preach tonight. Amen. Jesus had three pull to his ministry. He had a first pull. That's all right. He had a second pull. And he had a third pull. That's right. His first pull, he did miracles. He did signs and things of that nature. And his second pull was Amen. Oh, praise the Lord. His second pull was what? Church of the living God. You know &gt;&gt; exactly what it was. He was discerning the heart. &gt;&gt; And his third pull &gt;&gt; was preaching to the total lost. &gt;&gt; That was the third pull. Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Amen. But as he began to preach, now remember, I want y'all to follow me real closely now. Get get real close up to me. You already heard these things, but I just love talking about them. Now, think about when Jesus was here on this earth as a as a physical man when he would do I I think one of the time he turned the water into wine. Y'all remember that? Can you imagine? Can you imagine a wedding getting ready to start, brother? and you you you know you at a wedding and and and and and there's there's the water that the the pots has no more wine in it. It ran out of wine and you got all your guests there and a big wedding and it ran out of wine. But can you imagine Jesus didn't panic a bit &gt;&gt; because he he knew who he was. But what he did, he said, "Bring them, FILL THEM UP." AND WHAT HE DID, he turned the water into wine. But now when Jesus did things like that, a lot of people I could imagine they began to follow him because they love that miracles. You know, they they you know, some of them just say, "My God, can you imagine a lot of them lay down at night and you say, "My, do you saw Jesus turn that water into wine? You know what? I got a need myself. You know, I need a better job. You know, I need a better house. I saw this house on the hill. You know, I'm going to follow Jesus and tomorrow when I go to his meeting, I'm going to tell Jesus I'm gonna let his lay his hands on me. Now remember NOW THAT WAS JESUS FRESH POOL. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So when Jesus did his first pull, he turned the water into wine. And one DAY HE HE SOUGHT THEM DOWN IN IN hundreds and tens and five. Are y'all with me? And and brother brothers, you know WHAT HE DID WHEN HE SAW HIM DOWN? CAN YOU IMAGINE the disciples must have looked at him and said, "Man, this is so embarrassing." I mean those folk was coming from all over the hillside and he only had two little fishes and five loaves of bread. &gt;&gt; But see, he was a creator. He was a prophet, right? Right on the earth. So what did he do? He sought them down and he be fed fed all those people with two little fishes and five loaves of bread and the crowd began to grow. Oh, everybody love the word got around. You heard about this man named Jesus. Oh my. Everybody want to talk with him. Everybody want to see him. Oh my. They just just love being in his presence. Amen. Because of the uh the loaves and the and the miracle cuz I mean be honest church. Who wouldn't follow a man that could just speak the word and and things happen? You know, you you got a need and you got a financially need and you just be in the presence of Jesus and he just speak. Just think about Jeriah's daughter was sick. Amen. And Jesus just told the told the family member just to go out the room. Amen. But he be to speak, Amen. life into the little girl. Are you hearing me now? Who want to be in a church like that? Oh my. They begin to follow him and church of the living God. I can imagine. Amen. Jesus church was filled up. Oh my. They love him because of his miracles and and things of that nature. And I found a lot of time, you know, [snorts] you go to churches a lot of time if you could just get the people just jumping and holling and shouting and screaming. Amen. They'll go back home and SAY, "DIDN'T WE HAD A GOOD TIME?" OH MY. YOU ALMOST ASK THEM, "WHAT DID THE preacher preach on?" I don't know. But God knows we had a good singing. GOD KNOW. OH MY. I DIDN'T KNOW THE PASTOR COULD SANG MIND. You seen that sister shout. OH, THE LORD IS in our church. Oh, they love the fishes and the bread. But let me TELL YOU, CHURCH. OH MY. THAT JESUS WAS GETTING READY TO TURN A CORNER, BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW IT, CHURCH. AND JUST AS IT IS TODAY, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOT READY TO TURN A CORNER. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So Jesus done those miracles and my they will follow him because of the miracle. Amen. But then then it came a time and it's first and he discerned their heart. He began to tell them what they was talking about. Jesus perceived their thoughts. Amen. Can you imagine? You know that must was a scary thing when when he could look at you and tell you what's on your mind. &gt;&gt; You know, you know that's amazing. if he could look at you and tell you what you was going to do before you left the house, but you went and put it on the kitchen table, but you took it off the kitchen table and you ke it in the bedroom. You look at your wife and said, "How did he know that? We know what we need to go to his church." I mean, this is God. We love going to his church. You know, this man could mind, I've never seen nobody that concerned. I mean I mean I had some problem was going on in my life and how in the n you know I have been to places brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brothers I've been to places where get the ministering I was at a church a few months ago and I'm I've never done this before and I preach a lot of time I take a brother and I demonstrate with him you know but y I tell him to stand up And I began to demonstrate with him. But this particular time, I'm not g not gonna get you. I I I read you. I just deserve your heart. Huh? I'm not going to do that. So, I was at this church and and [snorts] God knows I've never will ever do something like that, but when the Holy Spirit had me to do, I was like, "Lord have mercy. This is a female. Lord, what are you telling me to do? This sister was sitting and I said, "My sister," I said, "Jesus love you." And I said, "Stand up, my sister." And I took her by the hand. I was like, "Lord, what in the world?" But pastor, I got nervous. I said, "Lord, it's a female. Lord, what you getting ready to tell me to do?" You know, everybody look. I asked her to stand up. I said, "You know what, sister?" I said, "I want to tell you something." I said, "My" I said, "Church," I said, "Don't she have beautiful hair?" I was like, "This getting a little too touchy here." I was nervous. I said, "Don't she have beautiful hair?" And she and I just took her and and she kind of did her hair like that long, beautiful hair. I was like, "Lord, what are we doing here?" And the Lord just like keep on. And I said, you know, sister, I said, you know, I said, "What the devil would love to do with you?" I said, "He would love to get you out of church." I said first of all what the devil will want to do I said he will turn you against somebody in the church once he turn you against that individual NOW THE DEVIL DON'T CARE THE DEVIL NOT GOING TO SO MUCH TURN you I mean most time people won't stop going to church because of the deacon now &gt;&gt; huh they they most people don't stop going to church because uh uh the musician uh uh the song leader most people are y'all with me &gt;&gt; y'all know where I'm going right most people are quit church because of who? Y'all talk back to ME. I TOLD YOU TO TALK to me now. Who? &gt;&gt; The who? &gt;&gt; The pastor. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. The truth. That's your target. And when he's a God man, the devil go and what and I told those things. I SAID THE first thing the devil want to do, he want to turn you against the pastor. Once he locked that communication, then he could work with you BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HEAR. said there be a pastor, a shepherd. And how can you hear except he's been set? &gt;&gt; YOU THERE'S GOT TO BE SHEPHERD. I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE, how long you look, I've been preaching now about 42 years, but guess what? I need a shepherd. &gt;&gt; The thing that God would tell my pastor that he won't tell me, God made him the ox of the team. Are y'all with me? Oh, I'm writing something right now. And sometime you feel like you could do like you want but no brothers and sisters, you need a pastor. &gt;&gt; You need A SHEPHERD. &gt;&gt; LOOK CHURCH, WE LIVING IN THE HOUR NOW. Don't don't lead yourself. You say what we need the Holy Ghost for. &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost is for. &gt;&gt; Don't don't get it wrong, brother Young. There ain't no man can teach you nothing. That ain't that nothing. The Bible said, uh, John 14:26, it say the comforter that teach you and lead you and guide you. Right? Brother Brandon says the inside teacher, right? Now, you can hear the voice of your pastor. But if God don't reveal it to you, you'll be like Matthew. Are you hearing me? It'll be like Matthew the 13th chapter, I believe about the 16th verse. Jesus said, "Blessed are your eyes." &gt;&gt; How many you thank God for your eyes? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Put your hand on your eyes. what I'm talking the eyes I'm talking about. Praise the Lord. Jesus said, "Blessed are your eyes." What eyes were Jesus talking about? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's talking about those. Huh? Now, Paul said in Now, I'm going somewhere else now. Huh? My goodness gracious. And I come down here. I But Paul said in I think it's in uh I think it's in Corinthian. And I just go ahead and quote Paul said the things that you see with the natural eye, they are temporal. Right? But he said the things that you you know you can't see are eternal. &gt;&gt; So he TALKING ABOUT PAUL TALKING ABOUT the inner man and the outer man. So brother Brandon says brother Brandon said we we think we brother Brandon said we look with our eyes. &gt;&gt; He said but you see with your heart. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So I can show you something ALL DAY LONG, BUT I'm talking about when it come to the revelation, YOU CAN'T SEE IT WITH the natural eyes. You got to see it. You'd say, "Wait a minute, brother children. I thought you see I thought we see with eyes." Sure you do. God gave you five outlets so you can see with these eyes. But I'm talking about a spiritual see. If God don't show it to you, then you won't see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me finish this. So I pulled the sister to the side. I said like, "Lord have mercy." I was like, "Lord have mercy." And I look back at the pastor. I was like, "Man, I'm getting in trouble." And the pastor just looking at me with a look on his face that that that that uh uh uh a artist couldn't paint. So I knew something was going on. Now the Holy Spirit is is is is a discerner. The word is a discerner &gt;&gt; of the heart, &gt;&gt; right? It is EARNED A THOUGHT. THAT'S how really it live. A lot of people still don't believe it. You know, SOMEBODY ASKED ME SUNDAY. They said, "I I I preach a message." I said, "We're turning a corner." And somebody told another brother say, "Brother children must watching that brother from Trinidad." I said, "No, I don't even listen at other preacher." The most preacher I listen at, I probably listen at my pastor. Don't get wrong now. &gt;&gt; And I will listen at the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Because a lot of time when I when I listen at ministers and when I go to that church, it'll be direct target what someone just preached. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So if brother Matt was preaching uh uh Sunday night and he would say, "Brother, you need to do such and such with your wife." And I come right in here and me and brother Matt come out the back and he got a smile on his face. Then I walk up to you and say, "Brother, you need to do such and such with your wife." The first thing the devil gonna tell you, Matt told him that. &gt;&gt; BUT SEE, THE HOLY SPIRIT IS A DISCERNER. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So I said, the first thing the devil want to do, I said, "Sister, first thing he going to do, he going to get you from out of church. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me, young people?" I said when the devil get you out of church, I said the first thing he do, he get you from around the anointing. &gt;&gt; Then he put a religious spirit on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a religious spirit, brother Brandis said, is five time worse than any spirit there is. Right? &gt;&gt; SO WHEN HE PUT THAT RELIGIOUS spirit on you, then you feel like you okay. AND SOMEONE WOULD CALL YOU AND SAY, "SISTER, where you at? Or brother, where you at?" "Oh, I'm good. I'm just praying. and I'm listening that tape. That's what the devil want you. We ain't listening at no tape ministry. &gt;&gt; You got to have a pastor. &gt;&gt; I DON'T BELIEVE IN STAYING HOME AND PUSHING THE TAPE. AMEN. SOMEBODY TOLD ME, SOMEBODY TOLD ME THEY PLAYING THE TAPE. I SAID THAT'S WHAT WE GOT A FIVEFOLD MINISTRY FOR. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? They said, "No, we play the tape. We listen and that." I ain't going to get into that. I don't know why I got there, but let me tell you what. Maybe somebody else need to hear it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I know y'all don't push play in here. Amen. Huh? And I said, "Sister, the first thing the devil want to do? He want to get you out. Then you going to get religious." &gt;&gt; And you know what I told her? She had long beautiful hair like you. I said, "The first thing he's going to take you when you get from out of the church from under to protection." I said, "The first thing he going to take you straight to the barberh shop." &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Huh? I said, "You're going straight to the barber shop." I said, "From the barber shop?" The old Oh, he ain't finished with you. You going on a You going on a tour from the barberh shop? You going where? You going straight to the department store and you going in the section where the men's britches are. And then he gonna put pants on you. Are you hearing me? [snorts] &gt;&gt; People, you know, you said, "Brother children, why should you preach stuff like that? We in the medicine. Let me tell you what, church. I've seen I've seen I've I've seen and and I I I remember I've been at this church and this sister every time she get ready to sing, she tell one of the most beautiful testimony almost make you want to cry and and you know she just got a long testimony. Then she get long beautiful hair and long beautiful dress. But as soon as she left the message, the first thing she did, Amen, she cut her HAIR AND SHE PUT ON PANTS. NOW, the first thing the devil would do with THE YOUNG PEOPLE, FIRST thing he carries them to the barberh shop from the next THING HE PUT THEM ON PAN AND THE NEXT THING Y'ALL KNOW WHERE HE GO, HE CARRY YOU STRAIGHT TO THE TATTOO HOUSE. &gt;&gt; AH, do you love the Lord tonight? Hallelujah. But guess what, church? When I said that to that sister and she sat down, I just kept on preaching. I won't go into all of it. But after the service, the pastor looked at me and we went in the back and I was just I mean the anointing was still in the back and I just sat back there and I tears in my eye. When I finally calmed down, he says he said, "Brother Chis," he said, "I got something to tell you." I said, "What's that?" He said, "You know the sister that you told to stand up?" I said, "Yes." He said that sister family just left the church a few weeks ago and and her sister just left and they say the message ain't right and the first thing she did was cut her hair and she told her sister said girl you need to cut your h your hair is too long and she was just about to cut her hair but let me tell you what church let me tell you what I believe THE LORD LOVE SO I WENT BACK TO THAT CHURCH A FEW WEEKS AGO and the THE FAMILY IS PART OF THE FAMILY CAME BACK and she had me to talk to her father and I be TO TALK WITH HER FATHER AND I I SAID BROTHER WHAT ARE YOU doing he said well we home now we listen that taped I said brother that is not going to work I don't know why I'm on that for I said brother that is not going to work I said let me tell you something brother you're going to answer for your wife I said you home LISTEN THAT TAPE I SAID YOU NEED TO GET HER back in CHURCH AND SHE STARTED CRYING AND THE NEXT SUNDAY THEY WAS BACK IN CHURCH OH PRAISE THE LORD SEE WHEN HE COME HE WANT TO FIND FAITH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; But they follow Jesus. They follow Jesus. Let me hurry with this. Hurry up. They follow Jesus. His first and second pull. But when it got to his third pull of his ministry, what he do was church, he started telling them, "Can y'all eat my flesh and drink my blood?" &gt;&gt; What they did? They walked away. That was the third pull of his ministry. They walked away. They didn't want anything to do with him, right? &gt;&gt; They they put him away. They got upset with him. They they they should start closing the church door. Have y'all ever seen something like that happen in this generation? They start closing the church doors. They didn't want Jesus back anymore. Amen. So, it got to a place, long story. Let me HURRY UP. YOU KNOW, GOT TO A PLACE WHERE THEY DIDN'T WANT him no more and they they they they killed him. Are you hearing me? But it's one thing about the love of God. IF YOU A PART OF GOD, GOD GONNA GET YOU ONE WAY OR OTHER. AND I THANK GOD FOR HIS GRACE IN THIS HOUR, BROTHER YOUNG. I THANK GOD FOR HIS GRACE. BECAUSE IF IT WASN'T FOR THE MERCY OF THE GOOD LORD, I WOULD STILL HAVE BEEN A LOST RANKED CHRISTIAN. AMEN. I WOULD HAVE STILL BEEN IN CHURCH SHOUTING, SPEAKING IN TONGUE, AND JUST GOING TO CHURCH AND READY FOR A TIME FIRE. BUT I THANK GOD FOR THE GRACE IN THIS HOUR, WHAT HE DID FOR ME, AND I'M HAPPY ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN THEY KILLED HIM, CHURCH, WHEN THEY CRUCIFIED HIM, WHAT DID HE DO, CHURCH? HE GAVE UP THE GHOST. HE DIED AND HE WENT BACK TO WHAT HE WAS FROM THE BEGINNING, &gt;&gt; a pillar fight, right? BUT THEN HE CAME BACK ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, NOT AS SON OF MAN. HE COME BACK AGAIN WHAT? AS SON OF GOD, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? OVER THE CHURCH AGES, RIGHT? THEN THE SON OF GOD, THAT PILLIFY WAS THE ANOINTING, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? THAT PILLAR FIRE WAS THE ANOINTING. &gt;&gt; But I thank God, Brother Youngs, God opened my eyes. You know, a lot of people got they have problem, you know, when you call the prophet name. I don't have a problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Now, now I can say, brother Matt, I I've seen where people think if they just quote &gt;&gt; that's going to make them important. &gt;&gt; The devil will beat your brains out. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Ys, a long time ago, you know, when we was coming up in Pentecost, brother, before you could be a minister, you had to learn how to quote the Bible, huh? I mean, we started quoting at a young age. I mean I when I get to Genesis and Exodus and Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy, Joshua, Jud, Ruth, first, second, Samuel, 1, second, King, Israel, Nehemiah, Extra, Joel, Songs, Proverb, and Ecclesiastes and songs of Solomon, Isaiah and Jeremiah and Lamentation, Ezekiel. Woo boy, he's a man of God. I can do all that quoting and can't even love my wife. &gt;&gt; Woo, that's a deep preacher there, boy. I want to grow up like him. No, you don't. You be like Jesus. SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY, YOU CAN SPIT OUT ALL THE QUOTES you want. IF YOU AIN'T GOT A LIFE BEHIND IT, YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME, MAN. LET IF I QUOTE SOMETHING, LET ME HAVE A REVELATION OF WHAT I'M QUOTING. ARE YOU HEARING ME IN THIS HOUR? SO IN JESUS MINISTRY, AMEN. HE COME BACK TO OVER THE CHURCH AGE as son of God. And I was telling somebody the other day, y'all, y'all ride with me? Y'all ride with me? I was talking to somebody the other day and when I was talking with them, uh, brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother I was telling them and I was talking about the son of man the spirit of the spirit of God the spirit of Christ and the minister looked at me he said what he said don't tell me you going to say u uh that was Jesus in revelation I said, "What do you mean? I thought you were calling William Brandham Jesus Christ." I said, "Come on, bro." I said, "But what was when he came back on the day of Pentecost? Was it the true pill of fire?" Huh? same pillar of fire that Moses saw. &gt;&gt; The same pillar of fire that Paul met on the road to Damascus. And I believe it's the same pillar of fire that came in our generation. Right? &gt;&gt; So it was a pillar of fire which was the anointing. It was over the church. A it was a true pillar of fire that was with Paul. Right? The same pillar of fire that with Irene and Martin and so on. I said now brother I said that anointing when it fell it fell on the seventh angel. Right? And the Bible said unto the angel of the church of what? Leia. Right? So I asked the brother I said I said now when the angel of revelation three and verse 20 it says what? Behold I stand at the door and knock. Right? I asked him I said I said who was that? He said that was Jesus. I said okay. I said, "Did he had robes on and long hair?" And what did he look like? He was in a vessel. Huh? But see, people don't have problem. Are y'all with me? I'm not saying nothing wrong. I'm in the Bible. Huh? Now, when when you could say Paul, it's okay. But when you say Irene, it's okay. But when you say Luther and Wesley, it's okay. But when you say William Brandon, wait a minute. You worship a man. Well, you tell me who was Revelation 3 and and and 14 and to the angel of the church of Leosa. NO, THAT WAS NOT JESUS CHRIST, BUT IT WAS THE ANOINTING THAT WAS UPON HIM. Are you here? Are we y'all with me? But see, PEOPLE CAN'T SEE THAT. SEE, LET ME TELL YOU, CHURCH, A LOT OF PEOPLE, THE ONLY THING THEY COULD SEE IS God sent a prophet. God sent a prophet. The devil knows that. You got to know more than that. Let me tell you what. The the prophet of God said the messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 COME TO DO TWO THINGS. FIRST, THEY come to turn their hearts. How many you glad your heart been turned? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. Give me a hand raised. Oh my. You glad your heart been turned? But let me tell you what, there's a lot of people that's around this message. You know why they going back to the world? You know why they going back to Pentecost? You know why? BECAUSE THEIR HEART hasn't been turned. JUST THEIR HEAD HAS BEEN TURNED. A LOT OF people turn because they saw the miracles that brother Brandley was doing. Are you WITH ME? THEY SAW THAT ALL THESE THINGS. BUT NOW, NOW WE COMING TO THE CRUNCH NOW. AND NOW PEOPLE ARE GOING BACK BECAUSE THEIR HEART HASN'T BEEN TURNED. BUT BROTHER AND SISTER, I THANK GOD. MY HEART HAS BEEN TURNED. BECAUSE WHEN YOUR HEART IS TURNED, THEN YOU CAN SEE CHRIST. CUZ WHAT HE'S COME TO DO, HE COME TO REVEAL TO YOU REVELATION 10. AND THAT'S none other than the Lord Jesus Christ. No Jesus, he come as son of man, right? Then he's to come as son of God. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. So far, &gt;&gt; then he to come and to sit on David's throne. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The son of man. Then he come at son of God through the church age. Right. Right. than he to come uh in the millennium as the son of David. But because of Revelation uh Revelation 10 uh uh uh Malachi 4 and and Luke 17:30, the Bible said, "As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the day when the son of man is be revealed." So in other words, God has to come back again as a prophet. BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHAT NOW WHAT THEY DID AND LEO SEAL THEY DIDN'T WANT HIM ANYMORE CHURCH Y'ALL FOLLOW ME NOW WHAT DID LEARD SEAL DID LE PUSHED HIM OUT &gt;&gt; LE WAS THE ONLY AGE DIDN'T WANT HIM ANYMORE &gt;&gt; LE WAS THE ONLY DAY ONLY AGE THAT PUT HIM ON THE OUTSIDE AND WHEN THEY PUT HIM ON THE OUTSIDE THEN GOD SAY YOU KNOW WHAT I GOT TO COME BACK AGAIN I'M GOING TO COME BACK IN THE FORM OF a prophet RIGHT IN A FORM OF PROPHET TO CALL A GROUP OF PEOPLE OUT. HOW MANY YOU SO glad about it tonight? Oh, I'm happy about IT TONIGHT. I THANK GOD THAT GOD SENT A PROPHET IN THIS HOUR BECAUSE IF GOD DIDN'T SEND A PROPHET, I'LL STILL BEEN IN THE SYSTEM thinking that I'M ALL RIGHT. BUT I HEARD MY name was called. I HEARD MY THEOPHONY WAS CALLING. YOU KNOW, IT TOLD ME TO COME OUT OF HER MY PEOPLE. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT, CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. I FOUND OUT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE COME OUT OF EGYPT. &gt;&gt; SEE, when Moses went down to Egypt, he brought a nation from out of nation. But in this hour, the Holy Spirit is coming in this hour is to bring a a bride from out of A CHURCH. SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY, ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT COME out of Egypt, church, let me tell YOU WHAT, THEY COME OUT OF EGYPT. BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHAT, EGYPT coming out of Egypt. Brother Brown says, "Let me slow down. I'm getting too old to be wide open like this. Let me drink some water. It's all right. &gt;&gt; I ain't mean to hold you long. &gt;&gt; I told my wife I was going to preach long. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Where was I, brother Matt? &gt;&gt; Thank you. Brother Brandon said Egypt is a type of the world or an organization. Now a lot of people have come out of Egypt but Egypt is still in them. &gt;&gt; We got to come completely out of the world. &gt;&gt; We got to come completely out of Leosia. This is a bride age. Can I say that, brother? Huh? This is a bride age. And I believe that he's called us out to take us into a bride age. So they put him on the outside. So he come back as what? Son of man &gt;&gt; to reveal. A son of man come to reveal what? &gt;&gt; Oh, I love the way y'all talk. I'm so Let me Let me tell you something. Let me let me let me let me tell you something. I've been to a lot of churches that got the Hoffman head. They got these same picture. When you preach these kind of thing, they look at you like you your face is orange. So what they want? They want me to work with their emotions. &gt;&gt; No, they want that first and second pull. Boy, I love I You know what been happening now? I've been going to places now. I wouldn't preach at a church. I preach a message basically like that. A brother told me after church, he said, "Brother children, I thought you going to drop the hammer." You know what he want me to do? He want me to run the aisle. Just a lot of holling. Ain't saying no nothing. &gt;&gt; You remember brother Brown said I was preaching and that Baptist preacher told him to say Bill to do that at funeral. Lawyer does things like that. I want to bring the word church and people DON'T UNDERSTAND. THEY so used to me running and running ALL OVER THE PLACE. IT'S GOT THE PEOPLE ALL HOOPED UP. I'M NOT COMING HERE TO GET YOU HOOPED UP. BUT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU, HE IS GETTING READY TO TAKE A BRIDE OFF OF THIS EARTH AND WE MUST BE READY. &gt;&gt; SO LET ME TELL YOU WHAT, CHURCH, IF HE DIDN'T COME, BROTHER YOUNG, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST AND LAY out of seal. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; I CAN IMAGINE THE PASTOR COMING OUT WITH A ROBE ON HIM AND THE BISHOP COMING OUT. BUT DO YOU BELIEVE CHURCH PEOPLE ARE GOING BACK TO EGYPT? ARE YOU HEARING ME? DO YOU KNOW MOSES BROUGHT THEM OUT? BUT WHEN THEY GOT IN THE WILDERNESS, THAT'S WHERE A lot of people ARE TODAY. PEOPLE HAVE COME OUT OF THE WORLD. AMEN. BUT THERE'S ONE THING, brother and sister. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAS COME OUT, BUT BROTHER YS, they had to enter into &gt;&gt; There's got to be another Ephesian, &gt;&gt; huh? There's got to be an Ephesian. There's got TO BE A JOSHUA. THERE'S GOT TO BE A HOLY GHOST THAT'S GOING TO LEAD US IN. LOOK, I WANT TO BE LED BY THE HOLY GHOST. ARE YOU HEARING ME? LOOK, CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, I DON'T WORSHIP WILLIAM BRANDON, BUT WILLIAM BRANDON WAS MY PROPHET. HE WAS THE PROPHET OF THIS GENERATION. AND LET ME TELL YOU WHAT, WITHOUT THAT MESSAGE, I WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST TODAY. &gt;&gt; BUT BY THE GRACE OF GOD, I HAD EYES THAT I COULD SEE THE REVELATION. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT, GOD SHOWED ME THE REVELATION THAT CHRIST HAD TO COME. GOD HAD TO COME back at the end. &gt;&gt; Not just a spirit, but he had to come back in flesh. &gt;&gt; Huh? And that's when he stepped in flesh and he began to pull out. &gt;&gt; It's all right, brother Young. Y'all with me, right? &gt;&gt; Think about it. Can Can I say something? I don't know how long I've been up here. How long I've been up here? About what? 20 minutes. 20 22 23 What? 24? What you got? 25. Who got 22? Now we sound like we auctioned, right? But see, Christ had I have to be like that sometime, you know, just be human sometimes. That's all right. But see, Christ had uh Brother Brandon had three pull to his ministry. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. Brother Brandon, let me let me go back a little bit. Y'all remember when brother Brana uh was going to this Pentecostal church and uh one was speaking in tongue and the you remember and and brother Brandon said, "Wow." He told his wife, "Honey, you need to come down there." Said, "I ain't never seen a gift like that." One spoke in tongue and the other interp. Brother said it was right on key. Oh, man. Was amazing. But but you know, he would go back to those little meetings. He just had his t-shirt and trousers on or whatever. Amen. He was sitting there and one of the guys said, "Anybody knows about uh uh uh William Brandon? Anybody know?" And brother, brother Brandon told the little guy he was sitting beside, he said, "Uh" he said, little guy said, "Do you know where he's at?" Brother Brand said, "I'm going to tell you something. I'm here." He said, "Go." Brother Brand said, "I can't go up there like these trousers and t-shirt on." He said, "Oh, go on there. Them people don't care nothing how you look." That's how he said, "I love it." Amen. He said, "Those people don't care how you look. Go on over there." Brother Bon said, "Don't tell it." And the man said it again. and say he pulled a little microphone say anybody know about Sir William Brandon and little guy said HERE HE IS HERE HE IS SO BROTHER BRANDON ministry start growing because I MEAN WHAT A POWERFUL MINISTRY I mean healing campaign and I mean 32,000 blanket natives I MEAN WHO WANT TO FOLLOW A GIFT LIKE THAT I MEAN SUPERNATURAL little boy from Finley amen on the side of the road amen brother Brandon had it in his fly leaf he saw this little boy on HOW THE ROAD ALL BROKE UP AND EVERYTHING AND BROTHER Brown remember. Amen. This is what he saw in THE VISION. HE SPOKE THE WORD AND THE LITTLE BOY THAT WAS ALL BROKE UP CAME BACK TO LIFE AGAIN. OH MY. BROTHER BROWN THE name went all around the world. PEOPLE BEGIN TO FLOOD THE PLACE OUT BUT IT GOT TO THE PLACE THAT LOVE THE MIRACLES. &gt;&gt; SEE GOD CHANGES HIS HIS HIS GOD CHANGES HIS MATCH. GOD CHANGES HIS FORM, BUT GOD NEVER CHANGE HIS NATURE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU GOT THE SAME HOLY GHOST THAT the early CHRISTIAN HAD OR YOU GOT THE HOLY GHOST. IT WILL IDENTIFY WITH HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; SO CHURCH OF LIVING GOD, THEY LOVE THE PROPHET OF GOD. OH MAN, THEY WANT to fly him all over the place. &gt;&gt; They told him said, "We really love you. We really believe you a man of God. We just love you." But just kind of quiet down on you know you preaching on these women with haircut and you know this you know you called to be a prophet and you know and lay hands on brother Brandon said how can I teach them adal when they won't even learn the ABC right so they love him because of the miracles but see then it came a time in our prophet life where God began to his ministry began to be a progressive minister God began to open his eyes out and let me tell you what church I'm so happy to know that God opened his eye because God knew that I would been coming along in this dark layout of sea and age. Amen. No wonder the prophet of God said, "Amen. Things looked so bad." He said in 1977, he said, "I predict, not thus said the Lord, but I predict by 1977." And I believe, brothers and sister, it got so DARK TILL THE PROPHET of God SAW LIGHT THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE END. BUT I believe by the GRACE OF GOD, GOD PUT A LITTLE GRACE THERE BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT I WAS GOING TO COME ALONG. GOD JUST HELD BACK THE WINDS OF HELL. BUT LET ME TELL YOU, BROTHERS AND SISTER, THE AMERICA, THE WHOLE WORLD IS HANGING BY ROTTEN THREAD ANY MOMENT. GOD GOING TO SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, CHURCH. THERE'S TOO MUCH KILLING. THERE'S TOO MANY RAPING. THERE'S TOO MUCH GOING ON IN A LOT OF CHURCHES. BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHAT, but I'm so thank God that he pulled us out. Are y'all happy about it? &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm going to I'm coming on down. I'm not going to say I'm I'm closing now. I was preaching out of church years ago. I might have told you I preaching out of church and I preached real hard that that Sunday and the pastor he he's gone now. This elderly pastor, his wife came up, brother Matt, I was standing at the front desk right there, you know, anointed service and people praise the Lord. him and his wife walk up to the front and just look at me. And I said, "Well, praise the Lord." You know how us minister feel? We feel like we did something, right? Somebody come up for prayer. So, man, this going to be real good. So, I'm getting ready to pray and I like, "Brother, you know what you want." And he looked at her and she looked at him. He said, "Go ahead, honey." No, you go ahead. He said, "Well, brother Chisum, we just want to tell you, brother, my wife and I, we just watch you just lied in the pull pit. How you think I felt?" I said, "Excuse me?" He said, "You just sat up there and brother, you lied. You just flat lied, brother. You're a liar." I said, I said, "What I did wrong?" I said, he said, "Brother, you said you were going to stop and you kept on preaching." He said, "That broke me right there now." I said, "I'm condescending. I'm just coming down." Huh? I'm trying to watch the clock on the wall. My God, that's the time there. Lord have mercy. I'm sorry. I mean to be out here by 8:30. What time? I don't know what time I got up here. Hallelujah. Now I I I I can't preach it all, but let Oh my. How are you enjoying this right now where I am? Don't turn me off yet now. But let me tell you, church of the living God. Let me tell you what. I'm going show you important of Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Wasn't for that church, we' have been lost. &gt;&gt; We would have BEEN LOST. &gt;&gt; BUT BY THE grace of God, God had us in his mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; So they was flying brother Brandon from place to place but after a while his ministry start changing. &gt;&gt; God start showing him more. Then I believe in 1947 I think that when the angel dropped down right. Amen. Began to tell him you going to go before monarchs and potentates and king. Then his ministry start flying around. Oh my. But after a while things start slowing down from the miracles discerning the heart. Amen. what they wanted to keep him. Brother Brandon talk about in the message end time evangelism. What they want to keep him, you know, brother Brandon was told to do the work of an evangelist. Are that that's right? To make full proof. But see, that's what they wanted. Those long Nothing wrong with that. Now, don't take me wrong. What they wanted is those long prayer lines. Are y'all with me? &gt;&gt; Huh? They wanted those long prayer lines. They want someone to lay hands on them. Are you hearing me? And that's what they wanted. Sometime people don't feel like God touched them unless they could come up in a prayer line. BUT LET ME TELL YOU CHURCH, I'M NOT FIGHTING AGAINST THAT. BUT THIS IS A GENTILE AGE. WE ARE NOT JEWS. WE ARE GENTILE. THE GENTILE ACTS 10:44 THE BIBLE SAID AND PETER SPOKE THOSE WORD AND THE HOLY GHOST FELL IN THERE. WE'RE IN THE AGE OF THE SPOKEN WORD. YOU COULD be healed right there at your seat. Now, somebody said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Now you trying to take away from prayer lines." No, I didn't say that. &gt;&gt; Did I say that? &gt;&gt; Paul said, "Therefore, leaving the principle of THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST OR WATER BAPTISM or laying on the hand." BUT HE SAID, "BUT THIS WHAT WE WOULD DO IF GOD PERMIT." BUT SEE, EVERYBODY FAITH IS NOT LIKE THAT. NOW, IF PEOPLE NEED HANDS LAID ON BY GOD, I'LL BE GLAD TO lay hands on. BUT IF YOU GOT THAT FAITH, AMEN, JUST SPEAK THAT WORD AND SAID, I BELIEVE IT RIGHT WHERE I'VE SAID, I CLAIM MY HEALING RIGHT now in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; But in brother Brandon ministry begin to change. After a while, he start seeing things different. God start dealing with him. He was talking to his his pastor, I think, and they began to tell him that something was wrong with his mind. he going to lose his mind and all of this, you know, but God had to deal with him. Y'all know this story, and I ain't going to hold you long, but as brother Brandon ministry begin to change, oh my, after his ministry began to change, but in 1962 when he had this vision uh of a visitation of angels, right, and what God was getting ready to do is change his ministry. But let me tell you church, a lot of people, amen, they didn't understand. Amen. The prophet when he turned the corner, brother Brandon said, Brother Brandon said, "You could have a stone, but it take a stonemason &gt;&gt; to lay that stone." &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Any Oh my god. Let me tell you what, BROTHER BRANDON SAID, ANYBODY COULD BROTHER BRANDON SAID, "WHAT GOOD IS IT TO HAVE A STONE AND YOU DON'T HAVE A STONEMASON?" ARE YOU HEARING ME? SO YOU WANT SOMEBODY THAT KNOW HOW TO LAY THAT STONE. ARE YOU HEARING ME? AND ANYBODY, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHY IT TAKES IN THIS HOUR, WE HAD SOMEBODY, WE HAD A PROPHET IN THIS HOUR, HE WAS ABLE to lay this THE ST CORNERSTONE FOR THE BRIDE. HE WAS ABLE TO TURN THE CORNER. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOT ready to turn the corner. &gt;&gt; We getting ready to go home. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God knows. I believe with all my heart, church, we are getting close. Come on, &gt;&gt; mother. Let me tell you what. When I was looking at you, you know, I thought about you on the way coming here. But when I looked at you, when I pulled up in the yard and I saw you, I looked at you, I was saying to myself, I remember your husband. I remember some of the words he told me. But when I was looking at you when I came in, I said, "It won't be long." I believe that church &gt;&gt; know people could come to church. You know people come to church and you know they said well I got the Holy Ghost but Paul said have you received the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Not when you believe. &gt;&gt; But since you believe. &gt;&gt; What is the Holy Ghost? It's the very life of God. &gt;&gt; It it'll it'll take the world completely out of you. And in this hour, I want to know without a shadow of doubt. &gt;&gt; You know, brothers and sisters, I was preaching out of church one time, and I'm condescending. I was preaching out of church one time, and I said, you know, a lot of people, they think they going to go in off of their pastor revelation or their coattail. &gt;&gt; I was preaching at a church and a grown man came up to me. He said, "Brother Chisum, I was looking to make it off of my pastor." I said, "Brother, you'll be left right behind. &gt;&gt; You got to get the revelation." &gt;&gt; How important it is is it wasn't for the grace of God in this hour. If God didn't send us a prophet in this hour, &gt;&gt; Amen. And I heard my name being called. And what he cried out, church, come out of her, &gt;&gt; my people, &gt;&gt; and be not partaker of her sin. And I'm happy about it tonight, church, to know that when he come, let me tell you what, church. He brought faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He brought that faith. Brother Brandon said he had done those things to elevate our faith. He brought that faith to give us rapturing faith so we could get out of here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, this is no time to be lukewarm. This no time. You say, "Brother children, why you saying that?" I feel good. But let me tell you what, church. This is the time, if I don't say nothing else, this is the hour I believe that we need to take inventory. &gt;&gt; I only say that because I feel as a musician, get ready to come up. Okay. I I want to stop, but I I feel the urgent. I want to share something with you. Hope my wife don't mind this. A few years ago, I was coming out from church and something happened. Someone things got out of order and the individual told me said they were they would kill me and we are very close. Brother was a man. We are very close. But God already showed me years ago, but I didn't know it was to this magnitude. But I say that to say this now. When the individual told me said, "I'll kill you." It messed with me real bad. I said, "How how could they ever think of something like that?" &gt;&gt; But then I thought about Paul says, "All things, not something." All things work together to the good to them that love the Lord and that are called according to his purpose. See, when God called you, he going to try you. You're going to know God. And I'm going to say something. But then I rode that thing for a while. But brother Matt, God was telling me, let me demonstrate it here. Let me get up here so you all could see it. God was telling me, let it go. God was telling me, "How you going to preach perfect love on this journey? You can't have nothing." When I said nothing, I mean nothing. You talking about agape love, not just filio love. But I said, "But Lord, but Lord, Lord said, you got to let it go." This what I did, church. I let it go. This it said, "Let it go." But you know what I did? I tore part of it all. I said, "I let it God said, "No, you got to let it all go." &gt;&gt; But I fa to come I'm f to say something. And then it came to my heart. We talking about a perfect love. And brother Brandon said, "Only perfect love is going to be on the other side." &gt;&gt; So my wife and I was coming home from church on a Wednesday night. It's in January, February. It was very cold. Lord is laid on my heart. Brother Matt says, "Let it go." I told my wife, I said, "Honey, I'm letting it go." She said, "What are you talking about?" And I told her, she said, "Really?" I said, "I'm letting it go." And when I forgave, I mean, when I forgave, I called the individual, the person on the phone. I said, "Look, I forgive you. It was nothing but the enemy. I know it wasn't you." and I said, "I love you." Then when I saw, I put my arm around him. I invited them to my house. But after that, God began to open up things to me like never before. It was almost like God saying, "Look, if you just trust me, if you just do what I tell you, you don't know what's waiting on the other side. First of all, you got to pass this. It's about to be a rapture. You could run the aisles and talk about Jesus all you want, but if you ain't got that perfect love, you're not going nowhere. So the Lord was telling me, you got to let it go. And that, brother, brother, pastor, after I let it go, guess what? The wonders of heaven opened up to me. God began to reveal some things to me like never before. Things I've been seen, I've never thought I could ever see. You know what? I had to let it go. And I'm going to tell you tonight, church, if there's anything on your heart that's bothering you, you don't want it on your heart. &gt;&gt; You want to let it go. &gt;&gt; If if your wife, you got a problem, something happened in the past with you and husband, you got to let it go. &gt;&gt; Because he is here, church, and he's looking for a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. without spot a ranker or any such thing. You young people with me tonight, I love you tonight, young people. I have six children at the house. You know, it doesn't it doesn't matter the colors of your skin cuz when we get on the other side, we're going to be brothers and sisters &gt;&gt; like we are now. You know, I'm I'm I'm I'm telling you the truth, church. People need to examine their hearts and make sure they they have what it takes. Now, what if God would have came and got me a long time ago? I want to share something that because I feel I feel the urge to tell you that. I just want you to examine your art. I just want you to look down in your heart. I was uh y'all remember it was in the 90s and don't get me wrong now. I'm just going to preach, brother man. Y'all remember in the 90s when I think when they talking about the ferret flag? So, oh boy, where he going with that? It's okay. Y'all remember that? Okay. We was on the job. See, I I just I need to tell you truth. I'm following the Lord. I I have no choice with that. But I The Lord is trying to talk tonight. And they were talking about the federal flight. But there was this brother I'm be Jason. I'll be honest with you. There was this white guy on the job and uh when they was talking about taking the flag down, guess what I guess what I did? I walked up to him. He said he said, "You know what? The flag is going back up." You know what I did? I walked up to him. I said, "Brother, let me tell you something." I said, "That flag is coming down." I said, "You hear what I said?" He looked at me and I and I just took the fear out of his heart. I said, "The flag is coming down." You know, I almost say, "Look, we not riding on the back of the bus no more. What? What? What is going on? I'm a Christian. I'm dead from politic. &gt;&gt; I supposed to be a Christian. I What are you doing thinking like that?" You know what I did? Brother Jason, I felt good. He just He just weaning right on down. Now, I know the history of the of the flag, but see, I had the wrong spirit on me. Are y'all with me? At least I'm honest. &gt;&gt; You're my brother and sister now, but I don't tell you the truth. But I told him the flag is coming down. And I walked off. Brother Jason, when I walked off, I was bad. I put fear in him. But the Holy Spirit grabbed me in my collar and snatched me around. And I ran back to that guy and I dropped on my knees. I said, "Man, I'm sorry. What?" He looked at me like I was crazy. I said, "Man, I'm sorry. What did I just say?" I said, "Look, man, I'm not in politics, man. I'm I'm sorry." He looked at me like I was crazy. But see, God had to examine me. I had to make sure that there's nothing. Are y'all with me? &gt;&gt; I had to make sure that there was nothing in my heart. Church, I don't want to stay here. &gt;&gt; That's your phone, sister. What if what if we was in church tonight or what what if it be a day I ain't gonna say you I don't say Jill over here. What if what if Jill was in church one night and her phone someone sent a message breaking news. What if she look on her phone and it said there's two men over in Israel just was killed laying down in the street of Jerusalem. Think about it. &gt;&gt; You know what? You know what happened? Somebody played church. &gt;&gt; I don't want to play church. I want to make sure that I'm ready. &gt;&gt; Someone Someone was arguing with me. Musician, come on up. Someone was arguing to me.
