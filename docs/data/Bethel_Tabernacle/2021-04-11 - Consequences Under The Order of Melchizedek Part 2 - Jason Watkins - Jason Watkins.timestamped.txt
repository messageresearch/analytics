[42:39] feedback from you and
[42:41] people abroad and so we're just thanking
[42:44] the lord
[42:45] for that and so um let's see
[42:49] i will uh hmm i think maybe i'll do it
[42:52] let me see here is this
[42:53] that's not the one oh this is it
[42:57] ah some fiend has stolen my
[43:00] receiver
[43:04] you got it no wow okay whoever's guilty
[43:08] we're going to be killing you
[43:10] amen all right brother brad you'll have
[43:14] to
[43:14] you'll have to control it from there
[43:15] thank you buddy amen
[43:18] so we want to look here and this is
[43:20] where we were
[43:21] last time now as you can see i've
[43:24] changed the subtitle
[43:26] to the results of opening the seven
[43:29] seals
[43:30] now i'm going to read the verses four i
[43:33] think through
[43:34] six um from the king james and then i
[43:37] want to go back again
[43:40] to that oh yes four through six in the
[43:44] king james and then i want to read from
[43:45] that other translation that i'm really
[43:46] enjoying
[43:48] so let's read together slide one brother
[43:50] brad
[43:52] all right here we go wherefore now watch
[43:55] what's paul instructing here
[43:56] wherefore my brethren ye also
[44:00] are become dead to the law by the body
[44:03] of christ
[44:04] that ye should be married to another
[44:07] even
[44:08] to him who is raised from the dead
[44:11] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[44:13] god
[44:14] verse 5. for when we were in the flesh
[44:18] the motions of sin which were by the law
[44:21] did work in our members to bring forth
[44:24] fruit unto death
[44:26] verse 6 but now now everybody say but
[44:30] now
[44:31] but now we are delivered from the law
[44:35] that being dead wherein we were held
[44:38] that we should serve in newness of
[44:41] spirit
[44:42] and not in the oldness of the letter
[44:46] now before we switch to the next slide
[44:49] let's pray
[44:51] father we thank you for your word today
[44:54] and i completely surrender myself into
[44:56] your care now
[44:58] you know the desire of my heart lord and
[45:01] i meant it quite sincerely
[45:03] i want you to take the material and
[45:05] deliver it today as you see
[45:06] fit lord i have found that that is the
[45:09] most productive way if i can just
[45:12] get out of the way shut up and let you
[45:15] be the preacher
[45:17] grant it lord i commit it to you and
[45:19] commit myself to this
[45:20] end in jesus name amen god bless you as
[45:23] you're seated
[45:24] and now we're going to take the next
[45:26] slide and we're going to go back
[45:28] to the the the alternate translation
[45:33] all right paul's saying so this is the
[45:36] point
[45:37] that's a great way to start it isn't it
[45:39] so this is the point
[45:42] death ended your relation
[45:45] to the law because
[45:48] i'm glad there's a because because you
[45:51] died to its power
[45:54] when you died with christ on the cross
[45:58] and now everybody say and now
[46:02] you have a spiritual union with christ
[46:06] who was raised from the dead and you
[46:09] with him
[46:10] as a result all right so my
[46:14] subtitle is the result of opening of the
[46:17] seven seals
[46:18] as a result you can reproduce
[46:23] the full life of christ i
[46:26] love that as a result of what he did
[46:30] now you have the ability now
[46:34] you actually can if you humble yourself
[46:37] to it
[46:38] reproduce the life reproduce
[46:42] the full life of god
[46:45] now i can tell you that is the last
[46:49] thing in the world satan
[46:52] wants you to do he already
[46:56] took a thrashing when he only had to
[46:59] fight one jesus
[47:01] if he has to fight thousands more
[47:05] who are who are also reproducing the
[47:09] full life of god
[47:10] he's got no answer for that he don't
[47:13] have enough demons he couldn't knock the
[47:15] lord off in his day
[47:17] and now that christ lives in you this
[47:20] is how this is how and only how
[47:24] you as the bride are an invincible army
[47:29] all right now next slide for
[47:32] when we were controlled by the sinful
[47:34] man boy we're going to amen this one
[47:36] for when we were controlled by the
[47:38] sinful nature the sinful passions and
[47:41] appetites
[47:42] aroused by the law were at work in our
[47:44] bodies and how
[47:48] so that we bore fruit unto death
[47:51] man oh man amen i don't want to hear
[47:53] about your fruit
[47:55] i'm going to tell you mine but we all
[47:58] were bearing fruit unto death
[48:01] look at the next one but now by say but
[48:03] now
[48:05] but now that we have died with christ
[48:08] the law wherein we were held fast has
[48:12] lost its hold upon us so that we are
[48:15] no longer in the old bondage
[48:18] of the letter but in the new
[48:21] service of the spirit
[48:25] blessed be the name of the lord
[48:28] now we were just hold right there
[48:30] brother brad and i'll give you the high
[48:31] sign when to go to the next one
[48:34] so so we we were talking about last
[48:37] time how that what was important and
[48:41] here's where
[48:42] we finished off last time where brother
[48:45] branham talks about
[48:46] how that just the same way that the evil
[48:50] spirited church you remember
[48:52] from the laodicean church age just as
[48:54] that evil spirited church
[48:56] full of iniquity is revealed at the end
[49:00] time or
[49:00] in other words she's made manifest at
[49:03] the end time
[49:05] that it was that little mustard seed
[49:07] that started
[49:08] all those centuries ago that looked
[49:10] harmless
[49:12] see and that it actually grew into a
[49:15] tree
[49:16] where lodge the fowls are the demons of
[49:18] the air people don't get that
[49:20] people don't all people do not pay
[49:23] enough attention to sowing seeds of
[49:27] discrepancy
[49:29] everything you do is a seed everything
[49:32] you think and
[49:33] say and do is a seed and so
[49:36] we should paul said think on things that
[49:39] are lovely
[49:41] think on things that are a good report
[49:44] control your
[49:45] thinking you are in a day that is going
[49:48] to require
[49:49] supreme thought control to not
[49:52] buy into the lie of laodicea
[49:56] which is a homogenation hybridization
[49:59] amalgamation uh all this blending of
[50:02] light and darkness and compromising on
[50:04] the word
[50:05] don't fall for it
[50:09] god is only going to take a perfect
[50:11] people in the rapture
[50:14] now there's no way physically for you to
[50:16] get to perfection
[50:18] you can get to maturity and you're
[50:20] expected to
[50:21] but there is the beauty of what we found
[50:24] brother branham going on to say
[50:26] just as that as that antichrist that
[50:30] evil spirited church has become made
[50:33] manifest and i want to make a point
[50:34] because that's a big point
[50:36] when we talk about revelation
[50:40] okay let me just give you a for instance
[50:43] so
[50:43] when we look at paul's day and paul's
[50:47] ministry
[50:48] now contrast paul's day
[50:52] to our day now you'll find
[50:55] and this is provable in the bible that
[50:58] there is not
[50:59] any doctrine not a single
[51:02] teaching that william branham brought
[51:06] that is not founded on what paul taught
[51:10] so this day was a restoration
[51:13] of that day you understand say but but
[51:17] aren't we to go
[51:18] further so you've got to be careful how
[51:20] you interpret further revelation
[51:23] so revelation as it would relate to
[51:27] paul's understanding of the mystery of
[51:30] god
[51:31] your brother branham's brother branham's
[51:34] understanding as elijah
[51:36] would not exceed paul's understanding
[51:39] but it is true that in manifestation
[51:42] this last day church becomes more of a
[51:46] manifested reality of the revelation
[51:49] than the first age who fell away
[51:51] amen so that first age was running and
[51:54] tracking along for the first couple of
[51:56] decades
[51:57] until they started to get relaxed and
[51:59] started to backslide
[52:00] this age picks up by
[52:03] the restoration of the original word
[52:06] which was the
[52:07] the the mighty god unveiled the the word
[52:10] of god was not sealed to paul
[52:14] not at all the seven seals came on the
[52:18] book
[52:18] because christ couldn't come for a
[52:20] church she backslid
[52:21] and so he binds it up in seven seals to
[52:24] live to run out through seven ages and
[52:26] sits back down to intercede
[52:28] instead of coming for his church you
[52:30] understand
[52:31] but in the end time he promised i'm
[52:33] going to unseal it back again
[52:35] and i'm going to restore the original
[52:37] faith of the fathers
[52:39] and then that will bring a bride out of
[52:42] the age of the church who has kicked
[52:44] christ out
[52:45] who is no longer his mouthpiece who has
[52:47] become her own mouthpiece
[52:50] and therefore god has called a bride out
[52:52] of a church a church out of a church
[52:54] you understand and has sent down has
[52:57] unsealed now when he unsealed the seven
[52:59] seals
[53:00] you're seeing a symbol you're seeing a
[53:02] book
[53:04] you're seeing a book in the hand of him
[53:05] and it's sealed and christ takes it and
[53:07] unseals it
[53:08] but you but you but we've come to
[53:10] understand that
[53:11] and brother branham is the first one to
[53:13] call that a book of redemption he titles
[53:15] it that
[53:17] the bible calls it a seven sealed book
[53:18] brother adam says the book of redemption
[53:20] because it's all the family of god and
[53:22] all the mystery of god
[53:24] because and and therefore we find then
[53:27] that the that the
[53:28] book is the bible particularly the new
[53:31] testament that's why jesus would say
[53:33] this is my blood in the new testament
[53:35] because it's his life
[53:36] it's the holy ghost when he uns that's
[53:39] why brother brandon would say when he un
[53:40] when he broke the seals
[53:42] he didn't break them off of a figurative
[53:45] book brother branham said he broke them
[53:47] off of himself
[53:48] amen and another place he says
[53:52] brother brahm says christ broke the
[53:53] seals out of himself
[53:55] so what was it the the breaking of the
[53:58] seventh seal was the
[53:59] opening of the word the revealing of the
[54:01] mighty god
[54:02] the unveiling of god in the word
[54:06] hallelujah and then christ according to
[54:09] revelation 10
[54:10] takes that open book that opened word
[54:14] that all all the mysteries now unveiled
[54:17] back to the faith of the fathers and
[54:19] gives it to a messenger
[54:21] with strict instructions to tell the
[54:24] people to eat it
[54:25] because they'll eat it they'll become it
[54:28] and you're eating your way to a body
[54:29] change
[54:30] because that's the result of the
[54:33] unsealing of seven seals
[54:37] so today we have access back to the mind
[54:40] of god and that's the only access
[54:44] there is no access back to god
[54:47] through a sealed word for the token
[54:50] every age received the god always made
[54:54] sure he got his family into the first
[54:56] resurrection
[54:58] condition but you have to understand
[55:00] that that what they had was a dip
[55:02] under partial light but we now have the
[55:05] return
[55:06] of what paul had the jubilee the
[55:08] abstract
[55:09] which searches the history all the way
[55:11] back to the mind of god
[55:15] that that's why that's why you can go
[55:17] into the old testament
[55:19] and in genesis you find
[55:22] you don't find a perfect abraham you
[55:25] find a liar
[55:29] twice over a cheater uh
[55:35] bringing forth children after fl after
[55:38] the flesh
[55:38] after desires you understand
[55:41] and so lying and conniving his way
[55:45] to pharaoh into the to the philistine
[55:48] king
[55:49] but but but by the time you get over to
[55:52] the book of hebrews
[55:54] all of that record has been expunged
[55:58] amen it's not recorded say
[56:01] god was being courteous no no he
[56:04] recorded everything in existence
[56:05] that no longer existed you understand
[56:09] the abstract searches it all the way
[56:11] back to the mind of god
[56:12] it doesn't just go back to what abraham
[56:14] did and go okay we're just gonna
[56:16] i'm just gonna forgive you for this and
[56:18] we're not gonna hold it against you no
[56:20] it goes on back past the failure of
[56:22] abraham all the way back to the mind of
[56:23] god
[56:23] and in the mind of god abraham never did
[56:25] do those things
[56:26] so the abstract searches it all the way
[56:29] back and that's what happened in this
[56:30] day
[56:31] when a prophet said now the abstract is
[56:33] returned to the church
[56:35] and it searched you all the way back to
[56:37] the mind of god and a prophet could say
[56:39] you actually never sinned in the first
[56:41] place
[56:43] because your first place was in him
[56:47] so the record is not it's not just that
[56:49] he was found not guilty
[56:51] it's not you say well he was found
[56:53] innocent it's not even just that
[56:56] it was expunged judicially that
[57:00] it takes a judge to do that when a judge
[57:03] judicially expunges your record
[57:06] it even removes the record that you were
[57:09] ever even
[57:09] charged it removes the indictment it
[57:13] removes the charge it removes
[57:14] all history as if you never did it
[57:18] in the first place this is the result
[57:21] of seven seals being broken and christ
[57:24] being revealed to the bride
[57:26] and sent down to you and you're eating
[57:29] upon your perfection
[57:30] and therefore because of your faith in
[57:32] it like abraham god imputes perfection
[57:36] to you
[57:37] [Applause]
[57:39] and you stand today not just forgiven
[57:42] but
[57:42] completely exonerated as if you
[57:46] never ever did it there's no
[57:49] record of anything you ever did under
[57:51] the blood of jesus
[57:56] so hebrews 11 wasn't omitting
[57:59] hebrews 11 was only recording everything
[58:01] in existence
[58:03] and the only thing in the existence that
[58:06] remained after god got finished
[58:08] after jesus said this is my blood in the
[58:10] new testament
[58:11] once paul came under once paul comes
[58:13] under that and writes about abraham in
[58:15] the hall of fame
[58:16] the only thing left after expungement
[58:18] was abraham staggered not of the promise
[58:24] it only expunged the bad it left the
[58:27] perfect
[58:29] oh hallelujah friends and so we found
[58:31] brother branham last time we found him
[58:33] saying
[58:34] that this this bride church as she
[58:38] matures her ripenesses and
[58:39] identification with her lord
[58:42] catch it now by means of the word
[58:47] not because you checked all the boxes
[58:51] or got an a on your report card
[58:54] but by means of the word by means of
[58:58] your faith
[58:59] that's how powerful the
[59:02] unsealed book is it has the ability
[59:07] to completely in the even standing here
[59:11] in real time
[59:12] i already look perfect to god
[59:16] amen say what about my sins he don't see
[59:18] him
[59:19] do you know the only thing he sees my
[59:21] faith in his word
[59:23] my faith in his word that's all he sees
[59:26] that's all he hears my faith in his word
[59:29] as far as as far as a human record he
[59:31] looks at christ
[59:33] and christ certainly lived the
[59:34] perceptive perceptive side of the word
[59:37] on my behalf
[59:38] he never made a mistake and so when god
[59:40] looks at you he says you never made a
[59:42] mistake
[59:44] that's what your faith in this unsealed
[59:48] book
[59:49] does say that's a lot that's only the
[59:52] start
[59:54] what it will eventually do is change you
[59:56] at the atomic level
[59:59] and there is not enough devils in hell
[1:00:01] to stop it
[1:00:03] if the devil can't make you disbelieve
[1:00:06] his word he can't stop your body change
[1:00:09] understand that your failures will never
[1:00:12] stop it if the devil can't stop your
[1:00:14] faith in the word
[1:00:16] he can never stop your body being
[1:00:18] changed
[1:00:19] because the faith the word that faith
[1:00:21] you have in the word you have
[1:00:24] is pregnanted itself with changing power
[1:00:27] and you are taking in by by this by
[1:00:30] partaking of this word of this end time
[1:00:32] you are you have passed from death unto
[1:00:34] life and you are eating your way to a
[1:00:36] body change
[1:00:38] see and that's why brother branham we we
[1:00:40] ended it last time when he says
[1:00:42] then as she nears the headstone and i
[1:00:45] emphasize this
[1:00:46] becoming like him through the word
[1:00:49] jesus will come that the bride and groom
[1:00:52] may be for every united as one
[1:00:54] and so i i i'm i'm not here
[1:00:57] perfect as paul said i don't count
[1:01:00] myself to have apprehended it all yet
[1:01:03] see but here's what i do i'm becoming
[1:01:06] i'm pressing why are you pressing
[1:01:08] because i'm becoming
[1:01:10] and when i cross the finish line i'm
[1:01:11] going to be in a dead run
[1:01:13] a sprint i say why are you running
[1:01:15] because i'm becoming
[1:01:17] hallelujah i'm not going to stagger
[1:01:19] across the line nothing doing
[1:01:20] i'm going to be running full steam when
[1:01:22] i cross that line
[1:01:24] hallelujah because that's the only life
[1:01:26] worth living
[1:01:33] so we allow one of the last things we
[1:01:35] said you last sunday
[1:01:38] we talk about the consequences under the
[1:01:41] order of melchizedek
[1:01:44] if it wasn't for this
[1:01:47] restoration of melchizedek paul said i
[1:01:49] got a lot to tell you
[1:01:51] but see the church was already getting
[1:01:52] dull they were already the disciples are
[1:01:55] already having to
[1:01:56] sit under oil lamps and write to the
[1:01:59] church you need to earnestly contend for
[1:02:01] the faith once delivered come on
[1:02:04] you know they were already drifting even
[1:02:06] while the disciples were alive
[1:02:08] gnosticism was already taking root they
[1:02:11] were already looking at christ in a
[1:02:13] weird way
[1:02:14] and and john has to write listen let me
[1:02:17] make it clear
[1:02:17] whoever doesn't confess that jesus
[1:02:19] christ came in the flesh is antichrist
[1:02:21] dot period who do you think he's talking
[1:02:24] to
[1:02:25] gnostics unbelievers running around
[1:02:28] even while william branham was alive
[1:02:30] wasn't and trying trying to change the
[1:02:32] doctrines today
[1:02:33] they try to change they claim they're in
[1:02:35] the message they're not in the message
[1:02:37] they're not in the message i don't care
[1:02:39] what they claim
[1:02:40] when you're living a life that's
[1:02:43] contrary to the word that restored
[1:02:46] you're not in the message the message is
[1:02:48] the revealed word
[1:02:50] and when you take a part of the revealed
[1:02:52] word and say it's not applying anymore
[1:02:54] you're out of the message
[1:02:56] i don't care who you are what your
[1:02:58] surname is
[1:03:00] i don't care what country you're living
[1:03:02] or what city or what heritage
[1:03:04] or how long you've been a been carrying
[1:03:06] message books
[1:03:07] when you deny the word of god
[1:03:10] when you deny the restored word you're
[1:03:13] not in the message
[1:03:15] you're you're you're you're you're a
[1:03:17] sidetrack of it
[1:03:18] see i'm not even suggesting you're lost
[1:03:21] i'm just simply saying you're not in the
[1:03:23] mainstream of the message
[1:03:26] god knows those that are his and
[1:03:27] sometimes even god's family gets trapped
[1:03:29] up in misinterpreted theology
[1:03:32] god won't lose them find word about it
[1:03:36] see but i just want to make that clear
[1:03:37] you're definitely not in the message you
[1:03:39] do not represent the teachings of
[1:03:40] william branham
[1:03:41] when you change the bible
[1:03:45] that's it say it again listen out over
[1:03:48] the airwaves
[1:03:49] you are not representing the message of
[1:03:51] william branham when you change the
[1:03:52] bible
[1:03:54] when you try to do away with ephesians
[1:03:56] chapter four and the fivefold ministry
[1:03:58] you are out of the bible
[1:04:00] you are not in the message you do not
[1:04:02] represent william branham
[1:04:05] you represent yourself see
[1:04:08] so this message came to turn our hearts
[1:04:11] back to the faith
[1:04:12] of our fathers and that's why brother
[1:04:15] branham would stand on the other side
[1:04:16] and say i only ever preached what paul
[1:04:18] preached but we acknowledge
[1:04:20] that there is yet manifestations that we
[1:04:22] are coming to have come to and will come
[1:04:24] to
[1:04:25] that that early church couldn't because
[1:04:26] they fell away and that was all in the
[1:04:27] plan of god
[1:04:28] that wasn't satan sucker punching god
[1:04:30] i'll promise you that was all in the
[1:04:32] plan of god
[1:04:34] but we find out friends that i mean if i
[1:04:37] just tell somebody look if you have a
[1:04:38] hard time with that aspect
[1:04:40] that we're to produce more by
[1:04:43] in other words not revelation as in
[1:04:45] understanding but revelation as in
[1:04:47] manifesting
[1:04:48] becoming the word then then that church
[1:04:51] didn't take a body change you will
[1:04:54] so if you can't see that principle in
[1:04:56] any other way just see it there
[1:04:58] that church did not take a body change
[1:05:00] but you will
[1:05:02] there will be a people on the earth who
[1:05:04] are alive and remain
[1:05:05] at the coming of the lord i'm glad today
[1:05:09] i am alive and remain
[1:05:11] [Music]
[1:05:13] the devil took his best shot missed
[1:05:17] angels interdicted kept me here i figure
[1:05:20] i'm on grace time now
[1:05:22] i figure every moment since i already
[1:05:24] shouldn't be here i'm just going to live
[1:05:25] on grace
[1:05:27] hallelujah i should have already been
[1:05:29] gone but god kept me here
[1:05:30] therefore what am i going to be afraid
[1:05:32] of
[1:05:34] i'm not afraid of nothing i already
[1:05:36] shouldn't be here
[1:05:37] but i am here and therefore i'm going to
[1:05:40] carry on and preach the gospel
[1:05:43] amen and so we found that we are
[1:05:47] becoming and that's really what matters
[1:05:50] because then
[1:05:52] then then then the consequences of
[1:05:54] melchizedek this mystery of melchizedek
[1:05:57] that why brother bradham felt the need
[1:05:58] to bring it was because
[1:06:01] that was the model that every son and
[1:06:03] daughter of god is going to come to
[1:06:05] the word made flesh that's that and
[1:06:08] that's why brother branham would go back
[1:06:10] to that visit
[1:06:11] when he would stand in a prayer line and
[1:06:13] he would say now he had his back to
[1:06:14] attend
[1:06:15] to to to sarah and he said i'll turn my
[1:06:18] back to the audience and he duplicated
[1:06:20] that sign
[1:06:21] he was joining that sign to this hour
[1:06:24] paul
[1:06:24] tried to do it in his day and he
[1:06:26] couldn't he said i got a lot to tell you
[1:06:27] but you're already dull of hearing but
[1:06:30] this bride
[1:06:31] is predestinated not to fall not to be
[1:06:34] deceived
[1:06:35] and she's hearing and living the
[1:06:37] consequences
[1:06:39] the result of calvary the result of
[1:06:41] seven seals
[1:06:42] the result of the son of man the result
[1:06:45] of melchizedek
[1:06:48] this is what makes her unstoppable
[1:06:51] amen so that means because that all of
[1:06:56] that is true
[1:06:59] then i get to live a different set of
[1:07:03] consequences than the ones i created
[1:07:06] and that is the beauty of it because
[1:07:09] there's consequences with everything
[1:07:12] everything you do has a consequence and
[1:07:15] if i
[1:07:15] today had to think about my future
[1:07:19] that i've got all kinds of consequences
[1:07:21] laying in my path for things that i did
[1:07:23] in sin i'm going to tell you i'm going
[1:07:25] to be walking around in fear i'm going
[1:07:27] to be walking around apprehensive i'm
[1:07:29] going to be afraid to jump step
[1:07:31] move i won't know whether to come here
[1:07:33] or sick them i won't know what to do
[1:07:36] but today because of that day on calvary
[1:07:41] what a resurrection that was and because
[1:07:44] of today
[1:07:46] what a resurrection this is that we've
[1:07:49] come up out of cold formal
[1:07:50] denominationalism to be a part of the
[1:07:52] living god
[1:07:54] then i don't have to live the
[1:07:56] consequences i created i get to live a
[1:07:58] whole new set of consequences
[1:08:00] based only on one thing i believe the
[1:08:02] word
[1:08:04] and i tried my best because now i've got
[1:08:06] a fighting chance
[1:08:07] because now i'm no longer married to the
[1:08:09] law married to christ
[1:08:10] so now i actually have a chance to be
[1:08:13] all i can be
[1:08:14] before you even had no chance so
[1:08:18] so we find then that that i am
[1:08:22] becoming brother branham says here all
[1:08:24] right brother brad let's go to the next
[1:08:25] slide should be i think slide seven
[1:08:27] probably
[1:08:30] so ah
[1:08:36] stand by i might be have a mix up here
[1:08:44] all right i do have but uh it's okay
[1:08:49] okay now yes i see what i did wrong
[1:08:54] okay let me let me fix something stand
[1:08:56] by everybody good
[1:08:57] just breathe you'll be okay just calm
[1:08:59] down
[1:09:01] all right
[1:09:08] okay brother brad go to slide 12
[1:09:11] and we should have it
[1:09:15] okay that's the one thank you sir all
[1:09:18] right
[1:09:19] so brother branham says here
[1:09:22] the bible said there is one god not
[1:09:25] three
[1:09:25] amen you believe it you can't
[1:09:29] get this straightened out and have three
[1:09:31] gods
[1:09:32] you would never sell a jew that i'll
[1:09:34] tell you that
[1:09:36] one who knows better he knows there's
[1:09:39] only one god notice like the sculpture
[1:09:43] he hides with a mask over it
[1:09:47] that's what god has done to this
[1:09:50] age next slide it's been hid
[1:09:55] all these things has been hid and is
[1:09:57] supposed to be revealed in this age
[1:10:01] now the bible says they will be revealed
[1:10:04] in the latter times all right now now
[1:10:08] now all right now let me make a point
[1:10:10] okay
[1:10:11] so if you in certain quotes like this it
[1:10:14] looks like
[1:10:16] that the that the mystery of god
[1:10:19] that the seven sealed book has been
[1:10:22] sealed since the dawn of time
[1:10:24] and it can look like that and understand
[1:10:27] you
[1:10:27] there again we gotta watch the
[1:10:29] difference between
[1:10:30] a revelation of understanding and a
[1:10:32] revelation of manifestation
[1:10:35] yes what this bride is becoming
[1:10:39] today has been sealed since the dawn of
[1:10:42] time
[1:10:43] satan has had ideas of what it of what
[1:10:46] god was
[1:10:47] after god shows the pattern in the book
[1:10:49] of genesis
[1:10:50] but we realize that the word of god was
[1:10:53] not sealed to paul so you have to
[1:10:55] acknowledge
[1:10:56] that paul had the mystery otherwise why
[1:10:58] are we restored what are we restored
[1:11:00] back to a partial understanding
[1:11:02] say well yes but then brother branham
[1:11:04] got more well that's not scriptural
[1:11:06] there's no there's no prophecy that
[1:11:08] tells me an elijah would come with
[1:11:11] greater revelation
[1:11:12] what i every scripture tells me is he'd
[1:11:14] restore me back
[1:11:16] but it is true that the manifestation
[1:11:19] side of it
[1:11:20] has been sealed up and it's been a
[1:11:21] mystery and and this is why
[1:11:23] satan can't stop it has never been able
[1:11:26] to stop it
[1:11:27] and can't stop you and won't stop you
[1:11:29] and you're going in a rapture
[1:11:31] and you can't stop it
[1:11:35] see so he says it's like a sculptor's
[1:11:40] keeping his piece of work all covered
[1:11:42] over
[1:11:44] until the time he takes the mask off of
[1:11:47] it
[1:11:48] and there it is in other words once he
[1:11:49] takes the cover off it's already built
[1:11:53] by the time satan figures out how i'm
[1:11:55] going to get changed i'm gone
[1:11:58] remember brother rem said and taught us
[1:11:59] just when they think they've got to shut
[1:12:01] up
[1:12:01] then we just go up amen see
[1:12:05] all right next slide and that's what the
[1:12:08] bible has been
[1:12:10] it has been a work of god that's been
[1:12:14] covered up
[1:12:15] see and it's been hid since the
[1:12:18] foundation of the world
[1:12:20] and it's seven-fold mystery
[1:12:24] see those seven spirits of god had to
[1:12:26] live
[1:12:27] out through the ages for the mystery to
[1:12:30] unfold
[1:12:31] it's not a lack of understanding in
[1:12:33] paul's day but it's a lack of
[1:12:35] manifestation it has to go
[1:12:37] brother brown said that early church had
[1:12:38] to die because that corn of wheat had to
[1:12:40] go into the ground
[1:12:42] it had to come back out in stages and
[1:12:44] now
[1:12:45] we're at this time and there ain't no
[1:12:46] more ages there ain't no more stages
[1:12:50] the next thing happens to this bride is
[1:12:52] a body change and she's caught away
[1:12:54] we don't need another revelation there's
[1:12:56] not another revival coming
[1:12:58] the next revival is to israel you're in
[1:13:01] the bride's revival
[1:13:02] it's happening right now i know the
[1:13:04] world looks crazy you might feel as
[1:13:06] unspiritual
[1:13:07] as a bump on a log not on a logger
[1:13:10] but i'm here to tell you you're in a
[1:13:11] revival as i said you last week
[1:13:14] if you're laying back on the comfort of
[1:13:15] carnality get up
[1:13:17] get up get up go forward go forward
[1:13:22] this is no time to be relaxed
[1:13:26] it's time for earnest sincerity
[1:13:31] and god promised in this day
[1:13:35] at the age of this laodicean church he
[1:13:37] would take the mask off the whole thing
[1:13:42] and we could see it what
[1:13:45] a glorious thing what
[1:13:49] are glorious i want you to look at those
[1:13:50] last word four words
[1:13:52] what a glorious thing
[1:13:58] say oh what's glorious
[1:14:03] me you
[1:14:08] that's what he's talking about the
[1:14:10] sculptor
[1:14:11] has had a covering over the perfection
[1:14:15] he's bringing in the bride but at the
[1:14:17] last day
[1:14:18] he he unveils himself she takes the book
[1:14:22] eats the book is transformed she's now
[1:14:25] in the image of christ
[1:14:26] she is him the the cover's been thrown
[1:14:29] off and the devil's looking at you going
[1:14:31] how did you get to be this why are you
[1:14:35] not out there with the rest of the world
[1:14:37] because i've eaten the book
[1:14:39] hallelujah i've become the book
[1:14:41] hallelujah i've i've been made manifest
[1:14:43] what a glorious thing
[1:14:44] you me you're the sculpture
[1:14:48] you're the thing he's been building
[1:14:50] since the dawn since the foundation of
[1:14:53] the world
[1:14:55] he already built christ that's why
[1:14:56] brother brandon said
[1:14:58] in christ is the mystery the threefold
[1:15:00] plan he says
[1:15:01] in this way the entire bible
[1:15:06] genesis of revelation is one goal
[1:15:10] amen amen one
[1:15:14] and he says and a little bit here we're
[1:15:16] going to see what that one goal is
[1:15:19] and when he begins to bring it all
[1:15:21] forward he takes us right to
[1:15:23] the answer expression it's all been
[1:15:27] about god
[1:15:28] expressing himself in a family
[1:15:31] so god doesn't just create a family god
[1:15:34] doesn't just
[1:15:35] materialize a bride in front of him
[1:15:37] because if he did it that way
[1:15:40] she'd have a start date and a shelf life
[1:15:44] see brother branham said you can't
[1:15:46] annihilate anything
[1:15:48] you take a piece of paper and say i'll
[1:15:49] burn it he said you haven't annihilated
[1:15:51] it
[1:15:52] all you did was turn it back to its
[1:15:53] original gases he said if time would go
[1:15:55] on long enough
[1:15:56] he said that those gases could become a
[1:15:58] tree again and get manufactured into
[1:15:59] paper again
[1:16:01] you can't annihilate anything only god
[1:16:04] can do it whatever god put together at
[1:16:07] the molecular level he can just take it
[1:16:08] apart
[1:16:09] you understand and so so so now we find
[1:16:13] that he created
[1:16:15] hell hell had a start time
[1:16:18] hell has a shelf life you understand it
[1:16:21] has an ending date an expiration date
[1:16:23] and we find out that that's that that's
[1:16:26] not that's not what god was
[1:16:28] ever intending god doesn't just
[1:16:31] create a bride out in front of him
[1:16:33] because then she would she if time would
[1:16:35] go on long enough she could come to an
[1:16:37] end he'd be alone again have to start
[1:16:38] over
[1:16:39] rather than creating a family god
[1:16:42] became a family god expressing himself
[1:16:47] through all time space and eternity
[1:16:50] expressed in earth expressed a universe
[1:16:52] for this family
[1:16:53] to be priests and kings in hallelujah
[1:16:57] so you understand that that this is why
[1:16:59] you're just as eternal as him you're
[1:17:00] just as much a part of the word as him
[1:17:02] he can't lose you lest he lose himself
[1:17:05] you can't not believe because you don't
[1:17:07] have a choice
[1:17:08] there's something inside you that
[1:17:10] overrules you it even goes beyond your
[1:17:14] understanding
[1:17:16] even when you see things and hear things
[1:17:18] you don't understand and i cannot answer
[1:17:20] it for you
[1:17:21] you come away and say well i'm still a
[1:17:22] believer
[1:17:24] so what about this well i don't know but
[1:17:26] i know about this
[1:17:28] i don't know about that i don't know
[1:17:29] about that but i know about this
[1:17:31] i am a believer and i can't be otherwise
[1:17:33] i'm sorry
[1:17:34] well you're a miserable failure that
[1:17:36] might be but i'm a believer
[1:17:38] hallelujah i am marching to zion i am a
[1:17:42] part of god i do recognize it and i
[1:17:44] can't help myself
[1:17:48] so what am i looking at what is this
[1:17:50] glorious thing
[1:17:51] is you it's it's me
[1:17:56] not the guy you see in the mirror in the
[1:17:58] bathroom
[1:18:01] not that guy that that that why do you
[1:18:04] think they call that a vanity i didn't
[1:18:05] talk about that
[1:18:08] i'm not talking about that i'm talking
[1:18:10] about this mirror
[1:18:12] god is not looking in that mirror god's
[1:18:14] looking in this mirror
[1:18:16] and says you're perfect i see no fault
[1:18:19] in you you believe my word
[1:18:21] it's accounted to you for righteousness
[1:18:23] how much righteousness do i get
[1:18:25] everything christ accomplished goes to
[1:18:28] you
[1:18:29] hallelujah what about all my sins god
[1:18:31] took all of yours and put them on christ
[1:18:33] and he paid the price for you he went to
[1:18:36] hell and god judged him as a sinner
[1:18:38] and sent him to hell he who knew no sin
[1:18:41] became sin
[1:18:42] was sent to hell why why why so i don't
[1:18:45] ever have to go
[1:18:47] [Applause]
[1:18:52] hallelujah
[1:18:54] oh my
[1:18:58] see so it's not about that man in the
[1:19:02] mirror in your bathroom that guy's full
[1:19:04] of sin
[1:19:05] that's the worst trouble you got
[1:19:08] see the real me is at war with that man
[1:19:13] the real you is at war with that guy
[1:19:16] see and so what so we find then
[1:19:20] that that it's a glorious thing
[1:19:23] because the lord is looking at the same
[1:19:26] mirror of his word
[1:19:28] and the book of hebrews proves that as
[1:19:32] we dealt with abraham's failures
[1:19:34] previously it ex it didn't just find him
[1:19:37] innocent
[1:19:37] it expunged his record so
[1:19:41] fortunately the lord's looking in that
[1:19:43] same mirror amen amen praise the lord
[1:19:46] so it's not a doctrinal understanding in
[1:19:49] the word
[1:19:50] see because
[1:19:53] paul already had that see but it's a
[1:19:57] it's a manifestation in the bride body
[1:20:01] it's never been seen at this level
[1:20:06] see never been seen at this level no one
[1:20:09] say
[1:20:10] well how is that so because no one
[1:20:13] has ever had to wade through this much
[1:20:16] unbelief
[1:20:17] before you are living in the convergence
[1:20:22] of everything under the white horse
[1:20:24] everything
[1:20:25] under the red horse everything under the
[1:20:27] black horse
[1:20:28] you're living under the convergence of
[1:20:30] everything
[1:20:32] of babylon and everything of persia and
[1:20:34] everything of greece and everything of
[1:20:36] rome you're living under the combined
[1:20:38] forces of everything in noah's day and
[1:20:41] everything in lot's day
[1:20:42] 200 million special demon
[1:20:46] chargers have been released from
[1:20:48] euphrates to do what
[1:20:49] they drove the jews back to the homeland
[1:20:52] but when that job was over
[1:20:54] 80 70 80 how many years ago what did
[1:20:56] what did those guys do
[1:20:58] they turned and came after you they were
[1:21:01] already hot on our
[1:21:02] on our heels before the seals were even
[1:21:04] open but
[1:21:05] god was able to preserve even that bride
[1:21:08] even before the seals imagine what you
[1:21:10] have now
[1:21:12] imagine how helpless the devil is
[1:21:14] stopping you
[1:21:16] he owns the government he owns the
[1:21:17] education system he owns all the schools
[1:21:19] he owns all the social
[1:21:21] fabric he owns the entertainment he owns
[1:21:22] everything but yet
[1:21:24] and it burns him he's got all the
[1:21:26] churches all the pulpits all the people
[1:21:28] but it burns him that he don't have that
[1:21:30] little tiny group scattered around the
[1:21:32] world
[1:21:33] hallelujah i'm happy to be a burn to him
[1:21:36] i'm happy to be a thorn in his side
[1:21:39] amen i'm happy
[1:21:42] that i stop letting stop letting him
[1:21:46] threaten you
[1:21:48] remind him that he can't even ride his
[1:21:51] last horse until
[1:21:52] i'm gone amen
[1:21:56] satan i don't care who you want in the
[1:21:58] white house you ain't going to get
[1:21:59] control till i'm out of here
[1:22:02] china north korea i don't care
[1:22:06] russia i don't care i i
[1:22:09] am satan look me in the eye lucifer i'm
[1:22:11] stopping you
[1:22:13] i'm stopping you so how you stopping
[1:22:16] because i got the holy ghost in me
[1:22:17] and he can't ride till the holy ghost is
[1:22:19] gone
[1:22:20] hallelujah oh my
[1:22:25] no wonder we could say today what a
[1:22:27] glorious thing i want you to
[1:22:28] i want you to think about yourself as a
[1:22:30] believer and just say
[1:22:32] what a glorious thing
[1:22:37] uh we're not glorying in our failures
[1:22:39] i'm glorying in his victory
[1:22:43] that regardless of my failures his
[1:22:45] victory is not upended
[1:22:49] next slide i think probably slide 15.
[1:22:51] now we
[1:22:52] read over here in
[1:22:55] revelation the 13th chapter the eighth
[1:22:58] verse
[1:22:59] that the beast that comes upon the earth
[1:23:02] in these last days
[1:23:04] will deceive all those people on the
[1:23:07] earth
[1:23:08] whose names were not written in the
[1:23:11] lamb's book of life
[1:23:13] before the foundation of the world next
[1:23:16] frame
[1:23:17] think of it before jesus was
[1:23:21] ever born 4 000 years before he come on
[1:23:25] the earth
[1:23:26] and several thousand years before you
[1:23:29] come on the earth
[1:23:30] jesus in god's mind died
[1:23:34] for the sins of the world and the book
[1:23:37] of life was made
[1:23:39] and your name was put on that book of
[1:23:42] life
[1:23:42] before the foundation of the world
[1:23:47] next slide that's the bible truth
[1:23:51] see your name was ordained of god
[1:23:55] and placed on the book of life before
[1:23:57] the foundation of the world
[1:23:59] you were there in his attributes you
[1:24:02] don't remember it
[1:24:03] no because you're just a part of his
[1:24:07] life
[1:24:07] you are a part of god when you become a
[1:24:11] son or daughter of god next slide just
[1:24:14] as you are
[1:24:15] a part of your earthly father that's
[1:24:17] right you are
[1:24:19] the male carries the hemoglobin the
[1:24:21] blood and when that
[1:24:23] when that has gone in the egg then you
[1:24:26] become a part of your
[1:24:27] father and your mother is a part of your
[1:24:30] father
[1:24:30] also so you're all part of your father
[1:24:34] glory that lets the denomination out all
[1:24:37] together
[1:24:37] certainly does god in all the only place
[1:24:43] so you can see why that would let out
[1:24:46] every denomination
[1:24:48] because because the only
[1:24:52] access now to the unveiling of god
[1:24:57] is thus saith the lord and this
[1:25:00] is what the seven seals restored
[1:25:04] to the church thus saith the lord
[1:25:07] you understand because the problem is
[1:25:10] without that
[1:25:11] you'll always lean to your tradition
[1:25:15] and that's what the church has been
[1:25:16] built brother jason demars has taught us
[1:25:18] that so clearly
[1:25:20] on teaching on the trinity doctrine how
[1:25:21] it was a a cumulative
[1:25:23] derived worked on you know
[1:25:27] and i forget the first several or
[1:25:30] a couple or several hundred years was it
[1:25:32] brother jd the holy ghost wasn't even
[1:25:34] included in the trinity
[1:25:35] that correct wasn't even included
[1:25:38] they added him later oh you know we
[1:25:40] better put the holy ghost in there too
[1:25:41] really
[1:25:44] and it's just become more and more
[1:25:45] babylonian is all it is
[1:25:48] it's all it is that that's the question
[1:25:50] i i ask our
[1:25:51] our you know our mega church on on the
[1:25:54] radio
[1:25:55] spouting his nonsense things he's saying
[1:25:57] going to suffer for in the regions
[1:25:58] beyond
[1:26:00] and saying that william branham was in
[1:26:03] hell because he doesn't accept the
[1:26:04] trinity and i called him up and said he
[1:26:05] certainly does accept the trinity
[1:26:07] just not the catholic version he
[1:26:10] certainly believes in the trinity
[1:26:12] the trinity of god one god in three
[1:26:14] offices god in multiple manifestations
[1:26:16] just like brother branham says his
[1:26:18] daughter becky you know when when
[1:26:20] they're doing the play
[1:26:21] at jeff high which they used to do that
[1:26:23] all the time i used to sit in in the
[1:26:24] auditorium and watch those same plays
[1:26:26] and and that's where my sister attended
[1:26:29] high school
[1:26:30] and and she was doing they were doing
[1:26:32] the play of carmen and
[1:26:33] and brother branham says that one actor
[1:26:37] played
[1:26:37] two or three different roles one time
[1:26:40] he'd come out as a hero one time he'd
[1:26:41] come out as a villain next time he come
[1:26:42] out is another villain next time he
[1:26:44] and he just all he did was saying god
[1:26:45] just went back and changed his outfit
[1:26:47] changed his mask put on different
[1:26:48] clothes and came back out and played a
[1:26:49] whole new role
[1:26:50] and he said that's what god did in
[1:26:51] christ that's what god did in
[1:26:53] melchizedek that's what he that's what
[1:26:54] he did in ezekiel and isaiah and david
[1:26:56] that's what he did in malachi that's
[1:26:58] what he's doing in paul that's what he's
[1:26:59] doing in you
[1:27:00] he's just playing another role
[1:27:02] hallelujah
[1:27:04] and so we find that that that that i
[1:27:07] said he
[1:27:07] certainly believes in the trinity he
[1:27:09] just doesn't believe the catholic
[1:27:11] version of the trinity
[1:27:13] and so and that's why you you can't even
[1:27:16] come anymore
[1:27:17] there's no way to get redemption
[1:27:19] believing that there's no way to get
[1:27:21] redemption in that false baptism there
[1:27:23] was a time when god would wink at that
[1:27:26] but no longer he now requires every man
[1:27:28] to repent and come to the knowledge of
[1:27:30] the truth
[1:27:31] and so that's why the church is no
[1:27:34] longer his mouthpiece she's her own
[1:27:36] mouthpiece
[1:27:37] he she kicked christ out the bride came
[1:27:38] out with him and now she has thus
[1:27:41] saith the lord that's the only access to
[1:27:45] re
[1:27:45] being redeemed thus saith the lord
[1:27:48] because every man i don't care how good
[1:27:49] of a preacher he is how good of a
[1:27:50] reformer he is
[1:27:52] he he'll add his own thinking a prophet
[1:27:55] is unique
[1:27:56] he has specifically designed and
[1:27:59] engineered by
[1:28:00] god that is just like this microphone
[1:28:03] this microphone has no ability to
[1:28:05] project words unless i
[1:28:06] speak into it and all it's doing is
[1:28:09] transmitting my words
[1:28:10] through electronic speakers into you but
[1:28:13] it can't tell you anything it has no
[1:28:14] mind of its own that's what
[1:28:16] that's the advantage of a prophet that
[1:28:18] when he comes he's
[1:28:20] he's not coming with i think that's what
[1:28:22] it is or this might be what it is
[1:28:23] you know you shouldn't do this you
[1:28:24] shouldn't do that a prophet has thus
[1:28:26] saith the lord
[1:28:30] and that alone gives you access to
[1:28:33] eternal life
[1:28:34] even if it wasn't william branham you
[1:28:36] better get busy finding who it is
[1:28:39] because that's the only way god he says
[1:28:42] i will do
[1:28:43] nothing i won't restore the church i
[1:28:45] won't take her in a rapture
[1:28:47] i won't do anything until i reveal it to
[1:28:49] my servants the prophets
[1:28:53] so we find then that we have been
[1:28:55] restored
[1:28:56] to thus saith the lord
[1:29:00] all right now next next one
[1:29:03] 19 i think when abraham met him all
[1:29:06] right now watch
[1:29:10] this is who we really are
[1:29:13] and who will really be when abraham met
[1:29:17] him
[1:29:18] he was melchizedek he unfolds here
[1:29:22] what all the attributes remember you're
[1:29:25] the attributes
[1:29:26] will do in the final end every son of
[1:29:29] abraham
[1:29:30] every son of the faith will absolutely
[1:29:33] do the same thing
[1:29:34] but i want you to watch how we have to
[1:29:36] come now he goes on explaining how you
[1:29:38] bypass it the often and come straight
[1:29:40] from
[1:29:40] the thoughts of god to flesh and and and
[1:29:43] and so but then you
[1:29:44] return back if you die before the
[1:29:46] rapture you go into a theophany body
[1:29:48] if you're alive and remain that
[1:29:50] theophany comes
[1:29:53] in the rapture that theophany leaves
[1:29:55] come picks up the body
[1:29:57] that's why when i put brother eddie in
[1:29:59] the ground
[1:30:00] i i said to my family i said to sister
[1:30:03] mom
[1:30:04] i said mom listen darling we're only
[1:30:06] we're only storing him
[1:30:08] this this i'm just storing his temple
[1:30:09] that's this isn't him i'm just storing
[1:30:11] his temple
[1:30:12] and he'll be back here and and when it
[1:30:15] when the trumpet sounds
[1:30:16] he'll come right back here he'll find it
[1:30:18] right where we put it and
[1:30:19] it'll resurrect it'll become glorified
[1:30:21] he won't be 80 anymore he'll be
[1:30:23] 18 or 19. i'll tell you heaven's going
[1:30:25] to be the biggest youth meeting you've
[1:30:26] ever attended
[1:30:29] what a youth camp hallelujah oh my
[1:30:33] joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:30:36] and so so that that that's all that's
[1:30:38] happening if you're alive and remain you
[1:30:40] take your body to that theophany and
[1:30:42] then it's glorified it's changed in a
[1:30:43] moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:30:46] see and so so we find that
[1:30:49] every son so who we
[1:30:52] really are and who will really be
[1:30:56] i i am a son of abraham
[1:30:59] and i am coming under the order of
[1:31:01] melchizedek what is the order of
[1:31:03] melchizedek
[1:31:04] the word made flesh
[1:31:08] god tabernacling in human form
[1:31:12] you understand so so now we we we go to
[1:31:16] the next slide what is possible
[1:31:19] in these dying bodies brother jason
[1:31:20] let's be real we are still dying all
[1:31:23] right
[1:31:24] a sick person laying dying
[1:31:27] nothing left but death that's all can
[1:31:30] happen
[1:31:30] i've seen a shadows of people don't eat
[1:31:33] up with cancer and tuberculosis and
[1:31:35] see them persons a little while after
[1:31:38] that
[1:31:38] perfectly normal and strong if there's
[1:31:40] no divine healing then there's no
[1:31:41] resurrection
[1:31:42] because divine healing is the earnest of
[1:31:44] the resurrection amen
[1:31:46] so you understand even if you get sick
[1:31:49] even if even if you're
[1:31:50] at death's door god can still overrule
[1:31:54] and bring you right back
[1:31:56] look at the next one what if death takes
[1:31:59] me
[1:32:00] 800 years later on mount transfiguration
[1:32:03] here stood those two men
[1:32:05] moses's body had been rotten for
[1:32:07] hundreds of years
[1:32:09] but here he was in such a form till even
[1:32:12] peter
[1:32:13] james and john recognized him amen
[1:32:16] if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved
[1:32:19] if you're an attribute of god expressed
[1:32:21] here on earth
[1:32:22] you've got a body waiting here after you
[1:32:25] leave
[1:32:26] this world so you know what i
[1:32:29] say friends it just don't
[1:32:32] matter what this life is or what satan
[1:32:36] does it don't matter he don't matter
[1:32:40] only this matters my faith in this is
[1:32:43] all that matters
[1:32:45] nothing else matters
[1:32:49] this is why we shouldn't be afraid of
[1:32:51] the world or stressed out over life
[1:32:54] this is why we should never have schisms
[1:32:56] and and arguments and funny feelings and
[1:32:59] and and and let things happen between
[1:33:01] believers my goodness you're born again
[1:33:04] amen what are you doing carrying an
[1:33:07] attitude you're going to heaven
[1:33:09] what are you upset about oh i hurt my
[1:33:11] feelings so what
[1:33:14] guess what they're going to heaven too
[1:33:18] and their offense and your your hurt
[1:33:20] feelings ain't gonna stop
[1:33:22] either of you oh for goodness sake
[1:33:24] there's always gonna be disputable
[1:33:26] matters we're human beings but
[1:33:28] come on friends we're all for one and
[1:33:30] one for all we're all in this thing
[1:33:32] together
[1:33:33] and we're all marching to zion
[1:33:36] so a lot of times i find it necessary to
[1:33:38] say to even a believer hey get over
[1:33:40] yourself
[1:33:44] you know look in this mirror one time
[1:33:46] this will tell you how to act how to
[1:33:47] think how to do
[1:33:48] how to react and the reaction is what
[1:33:50] usually gets us in trouble anyway
[1:33:52] this is the time where brother branham
[1:33:54] said this day this scripture the sign of
[1:33:57] sodom
[1:33:58] say the sign of sodom is great but
[1:34:00] there's also the sign of the supersede
[1:34:03] understand that friends you are the
[1:34:05] super seed
[1:34:07] you're the super sign we're not chasing
[1:34:10] some other revival we're not chasing
[1:34:11] preachers right chasing men
[1:34:13] i'm here to tell you the kingdom
[1:34:14] building in this message the bride is
[1:34:16] done with that
[1:34:18] she's done with that people who are
[1:34:20] still pursuing that aren't even in the
[1:34:21] message
[1:34:22] this message exalts the lord jesus
[1:34:25] christ and him alone
[1:34:27] hallelujah
[1:34:31] so we find that our record is expunged
[1:34:35] the abstract
[1:34:36] searched our history all the way back
[1:34:42] it didn't need to search back all of my
[1:34:44] failures
[1:34:45] it just jumped it all and went back to
[1:34:47] the mind of god
[1:34:49] and said what's the record there
[1:34:51] perfection okay
[1:34:53] that's what we're going to write about
[1:34:54] him perfection
[1:34:56] so what about all this that don't even
[1:34:57] exist anymore
[1:34:59] because that was never part of the
[1:35:01] original
[1:35:03] vision so we find then friends that
[1:35:11] the world though it is in a chaos
[1:35:16] and it is that's my last slide brother
[1:35:20] brad you can take that down
[1:35:22] the world is in a chaos
[1:35:26] but that's not new god handled that in
[1:35:29] genesis
[1:35:31] i promise we can handle this again he's
[1:35:33] been there done that
[1:35:36] he understands how to settle chaos he
[1:35:37] understands how to separate light from
[1:35:39] darkness
[1:35:40] he understands how to lift his people up
[1:35:42] in faith he understands how to get you
[1:35:44] past fear
[1:35:45] he understands how how to god
[1:35:48] understands how to heal you
[1:35:51] god understands that he can take one
[1:35:53] child and heal him it with a miracle
[1:35:56] because that that child has nothing to
[1:35:58] learn this is just a trick of the devil
[1:36:00] and god's not gonna put up with it
[1:36:01] another child has got some lessons he
[1:36:04] needs to learn and that's why the things
[1:36:05] on him in the first place
[1:36:07] and god's gonna heal him if he'll just
[1:36:08] keep walking and not faint just keep
[1:36:10] going and
[1:36:11] learn the lesson
[1:36:14] and then god will heal him sometimes
[1:36:16] people come up to the altar for the holy
[1:36:18] ghost
[1:36:18] and god will give him the holy ghost on
[1:36:20] the spot boom bang filled up done
[1:36:22] finished you're off to glory and then
[1:36:25] somebody else has to come and cry and
[1:36:27] moan and go
[1:36:27] weeks and months and sometimes years and
[1:36:30] you say well
[1:36:30] is god respective persons no but he's a
[1:36:33] wise heavenly father
[1:36:35] he knows if he gives this one the new
[1:36:37] birth right away this one go forward
[1:36:38] he'll never look back he'll run for
[1:36:40] he'll run for he'll be running for his
[1:36:42] life running pressing toward the mark of
[1:36:43] the high calling forever
[1:36:45] over here he knows this guy's still got
[1:36:46] some issues he knows this guy is still
[1:36:48] ain't full surrendered
[1:36:49] so he's going to make him wait
[1:36:53] and i promise you he can wait you out
[1:36:57] and if you get going too slow he'll
[1:36:59] narrow your path and you'll speed up
[1:37:02] he'll get you where he needs to get you
[1:37:06] but he's always his words are always
[1:37:08] true
[1:37:09] and his ways are always just
[1:37:12] do you believe that friends a lot of
[1:37:15] times our life we don't realize
[1:37:18] is more about stewardship than it is
[1:37:20] ownership
[1:37:21] [Music]
[1:37:22] you just need to realize that i was
[1:37:24] preaching along those lines wednesday
[1:37:26] night
[1:37:26] i i hope that was a blessing to you it
[1:37:28] was sure a blessing to me
[1:37:30] to preach it i was just being
[1:37:32] transparent telling you some
[1:37:34] things out of my own heart things that
[1:37:36] the lord taught me
[1:37:37] in a deep trial and and i i don't ever
[1:37:41] want to have to go
[1:37:42] and learn all that again see but calvary
[1:37:46] has made all this possible see so what
[1:37:49] an easter
[1:37:50] that was what a resurrection that was
[1:37:53] and what a resurrection this is
[1:37:57] an understanding of the word see that's
[1:38:00] the understanding of the word's not in
[1:38:01] question it's a divine declaration
[1:38:04] it's thus saith the lord we have the
[1:38:06] devil's answer
[1:38:07] before he even has the question
[1:38:10] the purchasing work of calvary and the
[1:38:13] claiming work in revelation 10
[1:38:16] brings this bride to the full perfection
[1:38:19] of god's kingdom saints
[1:38:21] of priests and kings
[1:38:24] i'm glad to be in that number i hope
[1:38:28] that you
[1:38:28] understand that you know you
[1:38:32] you that this nature change that paul
[1:38:36] spoke about in our opening text in
[1:38:39] romans 7
[1:38:41] that that you have to have this nature
[1:38:44] change and
[1:38:45] that nature change is what sets you free
[1:38:49] to try to live right and and actually
[1:38:52] have a
[1:38:53] fighting chance to live the only life
[1:38:56] that counts
[1:38:58] his that's what
[1:39:01] paul is saying to you in romans 7.
[1:39:04] before
[1:39:05] the word of god came you don't even have
[1:39:06] a chance you're just a prisoner to your
[1:39:09] fallen nature
[1:39:10] see now you're still in a fallen body
[1:39:12] even when you're born again
[1:39:14] but now the inside man his desires are
[1:39:16] different now
[1:39:18] now he's fighting that guy the guy in
[1:39:20] this mirror fights the guy in your
[1:39:22] bathroom mirror
[1:39:24] see this guy wants domination that guy
[1:39:27] wants domination
[1:39:28] see and you got to decide to take the
[1:39:31] way with the lord's despised few and
[1:39:33] press
[1:39:34] toward the mark press toward that prize
[1:39:37] let me say to you today in this age i
[1:39:40] mean you're already
[1:39:41] impossible you're already
[1:39:44] you're living in an age impossible it's
[1:39:47] impossible to be an overcomer there's no
[1:39:48] way
[1:39:49] it's too dark there's too much unbelief
[1:39:51] that satan has too much control
[1:39:52] he's had a zenith he this is satan's
[1:39:56] eden you don't stand a chance
[1:39:58] only by the revealed word of this hour
[1:40:01] to give you a nature change and then
[1:40:03] guide you through life do you have even
[1:40:05] a fighting chance
[1:40:07] and so brother branham says he says it
[1:40:09] this way
[1:40:10] then the one that left home
[1:40:14] i love that word that's what you find
[1:40:16] out see
[1:40:17] you find out that you're the one who
[1:40:19] left home
[1:40:20] i only left home
[1:40:24] say why does that matter because i got
[1:40:26] failures but
[1:40:27] i look at my failures and i just go well
[1:40:30] i only left home and i i regret that
[1:40:34] i repent for that but that ain't going
[1:40:36] to hinder me i only left home that's how
[1:40:38] i got here i didn't bring me here
[1:40:39] i left home god put me here
[1:40:43] i came from god i go back to god
[1:40:46] see there's nothing that can stop that
[1:40:49] and so we find that the bride
[1:40:52] she is the final interpretation of the
[1:40:55] promise
[1:40:56] to the last day people that's what
[1:40:59] proverbs
[1:41:00] 4 18 says but the path of the just is as
[1:41:04] a shining light that shineth more and
[1:41:06] more
[1:41:07] unto the perfect day there's where we
[1:41:10] are
[1:41:11] we're shining a light god get it get
[1:41:15] this understanding clear
[1:41:17] god has already secured you
[1:41:21] you are signed sealed and delivered
[1:41:24] already in heavenly places
[1:41:26] in christ jesus because of that day on
[1:41:29] calvary his purchasing work
[1:41:31] and what he did by claiming the book and
[1:41:34] losing the seals
[1:41:35] sending it down to a messenger who gave
[1:41:37] it to you and you fed on it and you've
[1:41:39] believed it
