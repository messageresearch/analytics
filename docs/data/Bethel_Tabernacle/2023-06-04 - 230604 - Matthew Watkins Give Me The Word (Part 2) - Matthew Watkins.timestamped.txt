[5:49] Christians when we walk out this morning
[5:52] I ask these things in the name of Jesus
[5:55] Christ
[5:57] amen amen you can have your seat say
[6:00] brother Luther's coming
[6:02] around uh brother Jason asked me to give
[6:05] a little a little update this morning
[6:09] did you get that PowerPoint Ethan if you
[6:11] don't mind putting it up for me I don't
[6:15] know is this thing on how's it work or
[6:26] anything so as many of you as you know
[6:29] that
[6:30] at about a little over a year ago we we
[6:34] we started um talking
[6:37] about doing some updates to the church
[6:41] and I got up before the church and
[6:43] shared the vision of the leadership of
[6:45] the church and that that Vision that the
[6:49] leadership has doesn't do anything if we
[6:52] don't put action to it we is the body
[6:56] and um so I shared this scripture taking
[6:59] ownership of the vision but Proverbs
[7:01] 29:18 where there is no vision that
[7:03] people perish and um we've been a little
[7:08] quiet the last little bit but it isn't
[7:10] because we haven't been working and
[7:12] there's been a lot of work in the
[7:14] background going on and um you know the
[7:19] planning the getting the pricing for the
[7:21] materials getting quotes from the
[7:24] different contractors and
[7:26] subcontractors um and the biggest thing
[7:29] was the the permitting getting that all
[7:31] done well we're about there um I believe
[7:33] next week we're going to we should be
[7:35] having the permits in our hands so
[7:38] therefore we're ready to start phase one
[7:41] of the project and I just put this
[7:44] together you know and um I had many
[7:46] people come to me during this quiet time
[7:48] and we're like where are we at brother
[7:50] Ken and I really didn't have answers
[7:52] other than we're working in the
[7:54] background there's a lot of work going
[7:56] on but the scripture says that to every
[7:59] thing there is a season and a time to
[8:02] every purpose under the
[8:04] heavens well it's that season for us now
[8:08] now is our time and the season to break
[8:10] ground on our new building
[8:12] project so um we're finally ready to
[8:16] move forward with phase one of the
[8:18] construction plans are permitting took
[8:20] us quite a while so phase
[8:23] one uh is going to be the buildout of
[8:25] the fellowship hall um the plan will be
[8:28] to Worship in the Fellowship Hall during
[8:30] the continuing phases of the
[8:33] project um once the once the sanctuary
[8:36] is finished we'll move back into the
[8:39] sanctuary but I want to remind everyone
[8:42] that we'll progress in construction
[8:44] according to everyone's giving so and
[8:47] what we're able to raise as a church
[8:49] because brother Jason is um he's pretty
[8:53] committed to not going into debt as a
[8:55] church and so um if we can if we can
[8:59] move this project along in a timely
[9:02] fashion then um that's our goal is to
[9:05] not to have to get alone and to uh you
[9:09] know raise this within ourselves we've
[9:11] seen it through other churches other
[9:13] believers um have you know offered have
[9:16] given um offerings to us and brother
[9:19] Jason says that there's more out there
[9:21] that want to help with the project but
[9:24] that's all secondary this is our church
[9:26] so we need to we need to do our part God
[9:29] is our provider and he'll provide us the
[9:32] energies he'll provide us the ideas to
[9:35] move forward with those with um you know
[9:38] with with uh fundraisers and he'll he'll
[9:41] bring people to those fundraisers he'll
[9:43] do all that but we have to be an active
[9:45] part of that and I just want to remind
[9:47] everybody
[9:48] that so the per permitting processes
[9:51] complete this coming week and we're
[9:53] ready to pour out the concrete pad for
[9:56] the new Fellowship Hall so June 10th
[9:59] which is next Satur this coming Saturday
[10:02] there'll be a small uh work party just a
[10:05] short one maybe four hours brother Matt
[10:07] said um for site prep we're going to
[10:10] remove um the awning out here the shed
[10:14] and remove some existing plumbing and
[10:16] underground move the HVAC units so forth
[10:20] like that so any brothers that want to
[10:23] come out this Saturday get with Brother
[10:25] Brad and brother Matt let them know that
[10:28] you'll be coming out to help that'll be
[10:31] this
[10:32] Saturday um then on Sunday next Sunday
[10:35] one week from today June 11th we'll be
[10:37] having a special kickoff offering um to
[10:41] ensure that we have enough cash flow to
[10:43] complete this lab we are almost there we
[10:45] are just on the cusp of having enough to
[10:47] complete that with the building fund
[10:50] that we've raised so far so we just need
[10:53] a a little push to get over top and give
[10:55] us a little um cash flow for anything
[10:58] the unforeseen that come up so there's
[11:01] going to be an a special offering taken
[11:03] so and then after that we're going to
[11:05] ask the church for pledges so even if
[11:09] you're not a tithe payer and you want to
[11:11] make a pledge or if you are a tithe
[11:13] payer and you consider this your home
[11:14] church we ask that you would pray about
[11:17] the special offering and about the
[11:19] pledges and the pledges are meant to say
[11:23] yes this is my home church this is the
[11:25] ministry God has me under and I see the
[11:28] need for um some improvements and maybe
[11:31] some um you know growth in our in our
[11:33] size of uh space and um I want to be
[11:37] behind that so the pledges are going to
[11:40] be um private we're not going to say $50
[11:44] anyone $50 anyone $25 it's what you can
[11:48] afford a month but what we do want what
[11:51] we do need is for everybody next Sunday
[11:54] brother Luther will have a little piece
[11:56] of paper and he's going to give every
[11:57] every person that comes in the door or
[12:00] every tithe pay uh family member uh a
[12:04] slip of paper and what we would like you
[12:06] to do is being honest and what the Lord
[12:09] has given you just write an amount we
[12:11] don't have to write your name you don't
[12:13] have to write nothing else just an
[12:14] amount that you can that you feel that
[12:17] you can give over and above the giving
[12:19] that you're doing now so we don't want
[12:21] to rob from Peter to give to Paul in
[12:24] other words if you're giving $25 a week
[12:27] or $100 a month in offerings don't back
[12:31] off and give $75 a month in offerings
[12:33] and 25 to the building fund because that
[12:35] doesn't that doesn't solve the
[12:38] problem um so this is over and above
[12:41] everything that you're doing now some of
[12:43] us won't be able to do as much as others
[12:46] but that's where you'll have your
[12:47] opportunity to be involved more with the
[12:50] fundraising if you have more time than
[12:52] you do money to help then get involved
[12:55] with the
[12:57] fundraising um yeah and so with that
[12:59] little piece of paper you'll write it on
[13:01] there and at the end of service you'll
[13:02] drop it there'll be a little box in the
[13:04] back drop your paper in the box and this
[13:07] is just so that the trustees have a
[13:10] number to work with on when they build a
[13:13] when they when they're building their
[13:14] you know their project plan and their
[13:17] schedules and all that they'll have an
[13:18] idea of the funds that are going to be
[13:20] coming in every month and when you do
[13:23] that that that amount make sure it's a
[13:25] monthly amount not a weekly amount a
[13:27] monthly amount
[13:30] um and brother Jason would also like to
[13:33] have a dedication of the property in
[13:35] addition uh before the actual concrete
[13:37] por so once this slab is ready all the
[13:41] once all the site work is done out here
[13:43] this Saturday and then we're ready to
[13:45] move forward with the poor um we'll
[13:48] we'll have the church assemble brother
[13:50] Jason will announce a date or a time
[13:52] brother Matt or brother Jason will and
[13:54] we're going to invite the whole church
[13:56] and anyone else who's interested in
[13:57] coming for the dedication we're going to
[13:59] dedicate the the new addition and and
[14:02] all the work moving forward to the Lord
[14:05] because it's his it's not
[14:07] ours and um brother Jason and brother
[14:10] Matt will determine that time and date
[14:13] uh soon okay so here we have je Jehovah
[14:17] Gyra he's still our provider and I just
[14:19] listed out some of the things that you
[14:22] know he's going to provide through our
[14:25] giving our fundraising ideas our
[14:28] fundraising activ ity and other giving
[14:31] we must play our part and walk in the
[14:33] vision so that all being said if you
[14:37] have an idea of a fundraising um
[14:40] opportunity that you would like to not
[14:42] head up or if you want to head it up you
[14:44] can if there's some idea you have write
[14:47] it down I've had a lot of people come up
[14:49] to me and just tell me their ideas but
[14:51] then I got to go back and remember it
[14:53] and write it down so I'm pretty busy and
[14:57] that makes it difficult sometimes I make
[14:59] uh I'll forget or I'll just won't write
[15:01] it down right if you have an idea we'd
[15:03] appreciate you to write your ideas down
[15:06] bring it to me or brother Matt or
[15:08] brother Jason we'll we'll um move
[15:10] forward with those but we really wanna
[15:12] we really want to start to move forward
[15:15] with that we bu we did a big buildup of
[15:17] that and then we didn't
[15:20] realize that there was I guess we
[15:23] realized it but we thought maybe the
[15:24] Lord would get behind it move it faster
[15:26] but again this is all God's timing not
[15:29] our
[15:30] timing so I just want to say thank you
[15:33] for your time God bless you and
[15:36] Shalom amen and that's uh that's the
[15:40] final
[15:41] project amen all right thank you

[38:12] want to give you everything that I've
[38:14] got amen for he's completely worthy of
[38:17] everything that we have amen let's turn
[38:20] to the Book of Ezekiel chapter two if
[38:21] you have your Bible I'm just going to
[38:23] minister to you here out of this
[38:25] book and as catch this we have a few
[38:28] Services coming up Lord willing uh I'll
[38:31] be speaking this Sunday uh Wednesday
[38:34] this coming Wednesday um and then so I
[38:37] think the next Sunday as well so we have
[38:40] a little bit of um well brother Matt
[38:42] that's a good reason that means you
[38:43] don't have to be so long-winded this
[38:44] morning you have plenty of services to
[38:47] stretch your thought out so uh and I say
[38:50] Amen Lord will you pray for me the Lord
[38:52] will help me do that I realized a long
[38:54] time ago I'm not a I'm not a good
[38:56] preacher brother Brandon said a good
[38:58] preacher holds a sermon you know about
[39:00] 30 40 minutes and I saidwell I'm not a
[39:02] good
[39:03] preacher and I uh I want to be a better
[39:05] one though I'm striving to be a better
[39:07] one amen this morning verse two I'm
[39:10] going to minister to you and I'm I took
[39:12] a thought a title a couple Sundays ago
[39:14] give me the word we're going to preach
[39:16] part two of give me the word and he said
[39:19] listen let's just begin reading here at
[39:20] verse one and he said unto me son of man
[39:24] stand up stand upon thy feet and I will
[39:27] speak unto thee now Isaiah or Ezekiel
[39:30] sorry had fellen fall to had fell to his
[39:32] feet you know people talk about brother
[39:34] Matt do you believe in being slain in
[39:36] The Spirit Well ananas and saf were
[39:39] slain in the spirit quite
[39:43] literally you want to be slain in the
[39:45] spirit have Peter as your pastor and lie
[39:47] about how much money you put in the
[39:48] offering plate you'll get slain in the
[39:50] spirit but this kind of slain in the
[39:52] spirit is completely different actually
[39:54] the presence of God has the power to to
[39:57] literally knock a person down to their
[40:00] feet and that's the power of God now
[40:02] that that people can can get an in an
[40:04] emotional realm and God moves through an
[40:06] emotional realm but this is literally
[40:09] the glory or the awe or the presence of
[40:11] God that has knocked Ezekiel down to his
[40:14] feet and God says get back up I'm not
[40:16] finished talking to you got more to say
[40:19] notice here in verse two and the spirit
[40:21] entered into me when he spake unto me
[40:24] now that's important not education not
[40:27] intellect not academic understanding but
[40:31] God but Ezekiel is going to speak and
[40:34] what's going to fuel what the words he's
[40:37] going to speak is not understanding or
[40:39] what he learns or even what he felt
[40:42] emotionally but the spirit of God is
[40:44] going to enter into his body and speak
[40:47] out of his mouth I want to say Lord let
[40:49] me be a vessel that can be that can the
[40:53] Lord can speak to me enter inside of me
[40:55] and then speak out of me
[40:58] and he said and he set me upon my feet
[41:00] that I heard him that spake unto me and
[41:03] he said unto me son of man I send thee
[41:07] to the children of Israel to a
[41:09] rebellious nation that hath rebelled
[41:12] against me they and their fathers have
[41:15] transgressed against me even unto this
[41:18] very day for they are impudent children
[41:22] and stiffe hearted I do send thee unto
[41:25] them and thou shalt say unto them thus
[41:29] saith the Lord God and they notice
[41:34] whether they will hear or whether they
[41:38] will forbear for they are a rebellious
[41:41] house yet shall
[41:43] know that there hath been a prophet
[41:46] among
[41:48] them now notice there's a very big
[41:50] difference in distinction that God makes
[41:53] of hearing the word of God literally
[41:56] physically through your eardrums and you
[41:58] hear a voice and when you hear the word
[42:01] of God into your heart because when you
[42:03] really hear the word of God you heed the
[42:06] word of
[42:07] God and he says and whether they will
[42:09] hear whether they will forbear verse six
[42:11] and thou son of man be not afraid of
[42:13] them Be not Afraid wait wait wait wait
[42:16] this isn't Hittites and jebusites this
[42:18] isn't even Nebuchadnezzar this isn't the
[42:21] Assyrians this is the condition of
[42:24] church for the Israelites
[42:27] God is actually having to tell his
[42:29] preacher don't be afraid of the
[42:31] people now you want to talk about a
[42:33] Jezebel spirit brother Bram said what is
[42:35] a Jezebel spirit it's when a spirit gets
[42:38] upon people to try to control by
[42:41] pressure or attitude what the preacher
[42:45] preaches from the pull pit I say God
[42:48] keep that away from us and now son of
[42:51] man be not afraid of them neither be
[42:53] afraid of their words though briers and
[42:56] thorn be with thee and thou doest dwell
[43:01] among scorpions be not afraid of their
[43:04] words nor be dismayed at their looks
[43:08] though they be a rebellious house Lord
[43:12] Jesus we just take Lord everything that
[43:15] we have here this morning God and we as
[43:18] a people as a group Lord I stand in here
[43:21] amongst them Lord who am I father to
[43:24] address or to stand Lord here before
[43:27] your children I'm counted Lord as just
[43:30] one of them Lord as we stand here before
[43:33] your holy word Lord and we don't
[43:36] approach it today father from a an
[43:39] opinion Lord or from idea that we have
[43:43] Lord father but we check all of our
[43:46] ideas we lay them and surrender down all
[43:49] of our opinions Lord and God we want to
[43:52] become subservient to your word this
[43:54] morning I pray God that you would take
[43:56] every Spirit Lord that's in this
[43:59] building today under your control for
[44:01] the glory of God use my vessel Lord use
[44:04] the words that I'll speak father to
[44:06] bring freedom to your children we humble
[44:09] ourselves now together Lord in your
[44:12] house father we're so grateful to be
[44:14] pull up a chair Lord that's what we want
[44:16] to do this morning just to pull up a
[44:18] chair to your table and dine Lord as
[44:21] your guest you've invited us Lord God
[44:23] and we're so grateful to be here in your
[44:25] presence now God May you come Lord as
[44:28] you always do so faithful Lord and may
[44:30] you move me the speaker out of the way
[44:33] Lord and those that are your bride Lord
[44:35] this morning Sons and Daughters of God
[44:37] May father we may you allow us Lord to
[44:40] remove every distraction to remove every
[44:43] kind of hindrance Lord that maybe would
[44:45] get in the way from us hearing your
[44:47] voice clearly and reing God may we
[44:50] surrender now to it Lord in the name of
[44:52] the Lord Jesus
[44:54] Christ amen you can be seated
[44:58] I want you just to look very closely
[44:59] with me in this chapter that we're
[45:02] reading out of Ezekiel chapter 2 and I'm
[45:05] just going to take a few more verses I
[45:07] just want you to read them carefully as
[45:09] it weighs so much upon my heart in this
[45:12] thought and the burden that the Lord has
[45:14] put upon me uh for this morning's
[45:16] service and what we'll carry over in the
[45:18] coming Services just pick it up here
[45:20] again at verse 6 together if you have
[45:22] your Bible uh just open that up if you
[45:25] could and your phone if that's your
[45:27] Bible you got permission to open it up
[45:28] there as well and those that don't have
[45:30] either you can look on the screen look
[45:32] at verse 6 thou son of man be not afraid
[45:35] of them neither be afraid of their words
[45:39] though briers and Thorns be with thee
[45:42] and thou does dwell among scorpions be
[45:46] not afraid of their words nor be
[45:48] dismayed at their looks though they be a
[45:51] rebellious house and thou shalt speak my
[45:55] words unto them whether they will hear
[45:59] or whether they will forbear for they
[46:02] are most rebellious he repeats these
[46:05] words to Ezekiel and he says whether
[46:08] they will hear or whether they will
[46:10] forbear for they are most rebellious
[46:13] this is the condition that the prophet
[46:15] of God is going to have to speak to
[46:17] these people and God says here in verse
[46:20] 7 Thou shalt speak my words unto them
[46:22] and he says in verse n and when I looked
[46:25] behold I hand notice this and behold a
[46:30] hand was sent unto me and lo a roll of a
[46:34] book was therein now it's pretty amazing
[46:37] when you study the Book of Ezekiel and
[46:40] you find here and you could read the
[46:41] first parts of this book and then the
[46:43] latter the very first parts of this book
[46:46] start off so Bleak and Isaiah or Ezekiel
[46:49] sorry is coming and and everything just
[46:51] feels to have such a negative
[46:54] connotation and that's really very much
[46:57] like uh The Book of Ezekiel at the very
[46:59] first few chapters because of the
[47:02] rebellion and because of the condition
[47:05] of this nation and then later on we
[47:07] we're going to look here in just a
[47:09] moment that God sends uh Nebuchadnezzar
[47:12] and he sends the Assyrians and they take
[47:14] the northern 10 tribes and then they
[47:16] come later and the the last two
[47:18] remaining tribes of Benjamin are
[47:20] captured and taken into ultimate
[47:22] captivity but and then Ezekiel changes
[47:25] his entire prophecy pH y you know the
[47:28] prophecy or the words that are being
[47:30] spoken by the Oracle of God is always
[47:33] going to be determined by the condition
[47:36] or the need that's in God's family now I
[47:39] hope you heard me this morning I hope
[47:40] you're not distracted because I'm just
[47:42] going to lay some very key principles to
[47:45] this thought that I'm preaching to you
[47:47] the Oracle or the prophet or the
[47:48] ministry that God puts inside of a body
[47:51] put to a nation it put a prophet and God
[47:54] the words that would come from that from
[47:56] the Throne of God to the heart of that
[47:59] Prophet that he would speak to those
[48:00] people would always be based upon what
[48:03] he would say would be determined by the
[48:06] condition or the need that God seen
[48:09] rising in the nation that he was going
[48:11] to speak to and so anytime that God's
[48:14] people are in consecration anytime God's
[48:17] people are in are in Consecration and
[48:19] dedication to the to the Lord and and
[48:22] the fathers are in their place and
[48:24] mothers are in their place and and and
[48:26] the people of God or have a repentant
[48:28] heart and they're in tune with the heart
[48:29] and the mind of God then the prophecy or
[48:32] the message that would come across uh
[48:34] the Oracle of God to the people would be
[48:36] words of encouragement it'd be words of
[48:39] of Hope it'd be words of Thanksgiving
[48:41] and he would say no weapon formed
[48:43] against you shall prosper for I am the
[48:46] Lord of hosts who shall defend you and
[48:48] rebuke the devour for your sake I'll
[48:51] pour out a blessing upon you that the W
[48:53] that the the windows I'll open the
[48:55] windows of Heaven heaven and I'll pour
[48:58] out a blessing upon which you can't even
[49:00] contain you say why were some of those
[49:02] words spoken to God's people because the
[49:05] condition of the people were in tune to
[49:08] receive a blessing and so anytime your
[49:10] life is in tune or in harmony or in
[49:13] dedication or consecration to uh to the
[49:16] Lord then you're lining yourself up for
[49:19] God to send a blessing to your life and
[49:22] and even send a miracle to your
[49:24] life but oh quite the contrary when our
[49:28] life is like many of us here today and I
[49:30] stand as just one one amongst uh all of
[49:33] us here when our life is in disarray or
[49:36] disharmony with the word of God or we're
[49:38] out of sync with the plan of God or our
[49:41] lives are not in in in harmony with the
[49:43] spirit of God let me just say that
[49:45] friends your life can become in harmony
[49:47] or out of harmony with the word of the
[49:50] Lord and you can be a Christian and be a
[49:52] believer and love the Lord and have the
[49:54] table have the Bible in your home and
[49:56] have the message books are scattered all
[49:58] over your home and and have all of the
[50:00] pictures and know all of the know all
[50:02] know all of the ideas and and and be as
[50:05] much a Believer as as Abraham was a
[50:08] believer in the faith of God but be Out
[50:11] Of Tune and out of sink and out of
[50:13] harmony with what the spirit of the Lord
[50:15] has
[50:16] saying and when you're when our lives
[50:19] become misaligned and that that when our
[50:21] lives become out of Harmony or out of
[50:24] syn with the with the spirit of the Lord
[50:26] and our lives begin to get what US call
[50:28] it what it is backsliding from the
[50:30] presence of God and church is not
[50:32] important and prayer is not important
[50:34] and listening to the to the tapes of
[50:36] God's Prophet become a third and fourth
[50:38] priority and and church attendance
[50:40] becomes a fifth and sixth priority and
[50:43] and prayer meeting uh on Thursday night
[50:45] becomes a 10th or 11th priority when
[50:47] though when when when these kind of
[50:49] things get out of Sinker out of Harmony
[50:52] of Our Lives we're not setting ourselves
[50:54] up to receive a blessing from the Lord
[50:57] but we're setting ourselves up to
[50:59] receive chastisement and correction and
[51:02] a curse upon our
[51:05] life you say God will bring a curse upon
[51:08] my life absolutely there's a law of
[51:10] tithing and there's either a a law that
[51:13] comes of blessing or cursing that comes
[51:15] upon your
[51:17] life hello and so you you do you do we
[51:21] realize that our conduct our activity
[51:24] our Behavior where we are in the har of
[51:26] the of God's program determine whether
[51:29] we are setting ourselves up for a
[51:31] miracle or setting ourselves up for a
[51:34] catastrophe you'll never find this more
[51:36] true in Ezekiel and I'm preaching to you
[51:39] on give me the word and you're going to
[51:40] see here just in a moment why we've why
[51:43] we're carrying on in This Book of
[51:45] Ezekiel but it's a it's an amazing
[51:48] parallel uh to to the to the word of God
[51:51] that you find the the law of contrast in
[51:54] the law of God of blessing and csing and
[51:58] and Ezekiel uh starts off his book and
[52:01] he shows a he shows a side of God's
[52:04] character that most people don't like to
[52:06] look at if I'm being honest here today
[52:08] I'd even go as far as to say that I
[52:10] don't like to look at that my human
[52:12] nature doesn't like to look at this side
[52:14] of God we want to look and and Fa and
[52:17] and focus on the good things and we want
[52:19] the blessings of God and we want the The
[52:22] Hope and the and the joy and and just
[52:24] give me give me give me give me
[52:28] because that's how our nature is our
[52:29] carnal nature we don't like to see the
[52:32] severity of the C of of the the severity
[52:36] of God but let me just remind you in
[52:38] Romans 11:22 the Apostle Paul actually
[52:41] picks up and shows the law of contrast
[52:43] that you will never know who God truly
[52:46] is until you see both sides of
[52:51] God you will never truly know the the
[52:54] character or the nature of your Heavenly
[52:57] Father until you see the severity and
[53:00] the goodness you can't just have the
[53:03] goodness and not the
[53:07] severity you got to have the severity
[53:09] with as we've preached here before
[53:11] you'll never understand the grace of God
[53:13] until you know the wrath of God you'll
[53:16] never know the diamond when that Jeweler
[53:18] puts that beautiful Diamond 10 karat
[53:20] diamond and you're looking at the beauty
[53:22] it's just glistening and sparkling
[53:23] listen You'll never see the real beauty
[53:25] of that diamond until that Jeweler puts
[53:27] a black velvet cloth and he sticks that
[53:30] diamond over top of that black velvet
[53:33] and behind the black wrath you can see
[53:35] the beauty of the
[53:37] diamond and until you know the severity
[53:40] you'll never know the
[53:42] grace Paul says in Romans 11:22 behold
[53:45] therefore the goodness and severity
[53:49] somebody say this with me let's read
[53:51] this verse together behold therefore
[53:55] let's read this verse
[53:57] together behold therefore the goodness
[54:02] and severity of
[54:05] God so Paul says upon those who fail
[54:10] severity but towards the
[54:13] goodness if thou continue in his
[54:17] goodness
[54:19] amen otherwise thou also sh be cut
[54:24] off now this is applies to our lives
[54:27] friends upon those who fail severity in
[54:31] other words what's he saying the the the
[54:33] the the blessing or the cursing or what
[54:36] is with the what what you are setting
[54:38] yourself up for severity or goodness
[54:41] will be based upon your
[54:46] conduct and he says if thou continue
[54:49] isn't we always always these ifs in the
[54:51] Bible but we stop reading short of those
[54:54] ifs if goodness to thee we read that and
[54:58] we say but but but goodness uh he says
[55:01] on them which fell severity but towards
[55:03] thee goodness close the Bible that's all
[55:05] I needed to read I don't need to read
[55:06] anything
[55:09] else if thou
[55:12] continue in his goodness amen there's
[55:16] always this law of give and take even in
[55:18] the book of Jude you know the B that
[55:20] there comes that Bible where it says
[55:22] that that verse in Judah uh way down
[55:24] towards the end of the book of Jude that
[55:25] last little book book before Revelations
[55:27] and he says he says uh unto God who is
[55:31] able to keep thee from
[55:34] falling and we say praise God he's able
[55:37] to keep me we love quoting those verses
[55:40] uh go God who is able to keep that which
[55:42] I have committed unto him right we love
[55:45] those verses the god who's the keeper
[55:47] but do you realize right before God says
[55:49] unto him who's able to keep thee right
[55:51] before that he says keep
[55:54] yourselves in the love of God so God
[55:56] says keep yourselves and God will be
[55:59] able to keep you the Apostle Paul says
[56:02] he's he's able to keep that which I have
[56:04] committed unto him but just a few verses
[56:06] before that he says I have kept the
[56:10] faith so Paul says behold the goodness
[56:14] and the severity on the on them which
[56:16] fail severity but towards thee goodness
[56:20] if thou continue I want to continue in
[56:23] his goodness amen
[56:27] and so Ezekiel comes to this amazing
[56:29] parallel and it's you can always
[56:30] approach the Bible and as we said we
[56:33] love to hear our nature loves to hear
[56:34] about the goodness we don't like to hear
[56:36] about the severity now it's the same
[56:38] exact way if you're a legalistic person
[56:41] you love the severity of God and you
[56:43] listen if you only focus on the Book of
[56:45] Ezekiel and you only get the severity
[56:47] you'll never know the
[56:50] goodness and let me just say you've got
[56:52] to know
[56:53] both you've got to know I want to say I
[56:56] I want to know all of God I want to know
[56:58] every part of God I don't just want to
[57:01] Center and focus in the devil or always
[57:03] try to get us to focus in on one thing
[57:06] to keep us from the whole
[57:08] thing oh I just want to say Lord don't
[57:11] let the devil distract me on one thing
[57:13] let me see it all let me see all of the
[57:16] plan of God let me see all of the
[57:18] picture of God don't let me ever get
[57:20] into one side and a ditch over here only
[57:22] to miss the middle of the road and then
[57:24] get on the middle of the road you know
[57:25] how how many times this is the tactic of
[57:27] the enemy to push us into ditches to
[57:30] keep us on extremes and out of the
[57:32] middle of the
[57:33] road I'll even go as far as to say don't
[57:36] you realize that's exactly been the
[57:37] tactic of the devil in the in the end
[57:40] time trying to get people to focus and
[57:42] major on one thing and fail to see the
[57:45] other
[57:46] thing but listen Paul said I've not shun
[57:49] to declare unto you the whole counsil of
[57:53] God so it's not not either one you can
[57:56] you can you can cut out one thing and
[57:58] miss the other that's the tactic of the
[58:00] devil you can cut out the love of God
[58:02] and only see the severity of God you
[58:04] could cut out the severity and only see
[58:06] the love but I believe the real true
[58:09] bride of Christ let me just say I
[58:11] believe a True Believer says God I want
[58:13] everything that you are I want all of
[58:16] your character I want all of your word I
[58:19] don't just want a piece of it or a
[58:21] portion of it or a favorite pet Doctrine
[58:23] over here favorite thing I like to hear
[58:26] I want to say God I open up my heart to
[58:29] receive all of the person of Christ I
[58:32] welcome him into my life I welcome him
[58:35] into my home I welcome him into my
[58:37] church I want to say Lord I want to
[58:40] welcome the fullness of the
[58:42] word oh I'm not just preacher just for a
[58:45] moment I don't want to cut out any part
[58:47] of God I don't want to I don't want to
[58:49] sell myself short of any piece of the
[58:52] Holy Spirit I want all of the Holy Ghost
[58:56] some people just like to feel him I like
[58:58] to feel him I also like to know him
[59:02] right here you say in your mind I like
[59:03] to know him in my mind the devil puts
[59:05] enough in your mind I want to fill up my
[59:08] mind with the word of God the thoughts
[59:10] of God the knowledge of God the word of
[59:13] God and I don't want to camp down or or
[59:16] focus on one thing I you know the seaa
[59:19] effect I'm just following the Holy
[59:20] Spirit here this morning the seol effect
[59:23] will always push you to the other side
[59:25] and when you see something so out of
[59:27] line and so wrong and so over to the
[59:30] devil will always put a scarecrow in
[59:32] order to balance that out you go to The
[59:34] Other
[59:36] Extreme all right I'm going to take off
[59:38] my jacket so I can
[59:41] fight you'll always go to The Other
[59:44] Extreme that's the tactic of the devil
[59:46] to make you
[59:49] extreme now I believe a real believer of
[59:51] God is an extreme person they're
[59:54] extremely in love with God they're
[59:56] extremely passionate about the Holy
[59:58] Spirit they're extremely passionate
[1:00:00] about the word of God they're extreme in
[1:00:02] the way that they live because they love
[1:00:05] they serve a god who's very detail
[1:00:07] oriented and what's pleasing and what's
[1:00:09] not pleasing to him but it's the tactic
[1:00:12] of the devil to always push us to one
[1:00:14] side of the other and we always if if we
[1:00:17] see it going too wrong this way in our
[1:00:19] family to correct that we'll put some
[1:00:21] harsh measures to try to correct it if
[1:00:24] you're not careful you
[1:00:27] overcorrect and many times it's the
[1:00:29] overcorrection that ends you up leads
[1:00:31] you your car flipped over in a ditch not
[1:00:34] going off the road and veering off onto
[1:00:40] the and you know many times in our life
[1:00:42] Our Life Starts going sideways and
[1:00:44] that's what we
[1:00:46] hear and things are falling apart and
[1:00:49] children are backsliding and the home's
[1:00:50] falling apart and there's arguments and
[1:00:52] hostility in the home and and suddenly
[1:00:54] your health is attacked and your body's
[1:00:56] attacked your business is and what is it
[1:00:58] and that suddenly because of that that
[1:01:00] instability to bring an overcorrection
[1:01:03] or to correct it we go extreme and go to
[1:01:05] the other
[1:01:08] side and that overcorrection causes us
[1:01:11] more Calamity than going off the road in
[1:01:13] the first place ever would have many
[1:01:15] times if you'll just let go if you if
[1:01:17] you'll just keep your hands on the wheel
[1:01:19] and slow
[1:01:21] down all right that's for
[1:01:24] somebody that devil always wants us to
[1:01:27] teeter totter on one way or the other to
[1:01:29] go the opposite way why do you think
[1:01:32] there would be a movement trying to come
[1:01:33] and attack our message of push play and
[1:01:36] Obey why do you think that there would
[1:01:38] be such a movement H that that the devil
[1:01:41] has tried to launch an assault of all
[1:01:43] you need is tapes and all you need to do
[1:01:45] on Sunday mornings as a good preacher
[1:01:47] five-fold ministry will point the people
[1:01:49] back to the tapes and they'll play a
[1:01:51] tape they'll shut up they'll sit down
[1:01:53] they won't preach their own idea their
[1:01:55] own thought We Don't Preach our idea our
[1:01:57] own thought we say what the tape
[1:01:59] says but why do you think there'd be a
[1:02:01] movement trying to get us to push play
[1:02:04] so that the True Believer as a reaction
[1:02:07] of that will then deemphasize the
[1:02:13] tape because it's always the tactic of
[1:02:15] the devil to push us into
[1:02:18] ditches you see some who have cut out
[1:02:20] emotion and say we don't need emotion we
[1:02:23] just need the word the word and the word
[1:02:25] only it's just the word of God away with
[1:02:27] experiences for measuring line they'll
[1:02:29] use all of their favorite little things
[1:02:30] that brother bam said that that feed
[1:02:32] into their pet doctrine of their or
[1:02:35] their idea well away with experiences we
[1:02:37] don't need any kind of you can have the
[1:02:39] Holy Ghost all the days of your life and
[1:02:40] still go to hell yeah brother brandham
[1:02:42] said that but brother brandham very
[1:02:44] clearly taught that that what he was
[1:02:46] referring to what comes on your flesh to
[1:02:48] a Pentecost who would speak in tongues
[1:02:50] and he says I've seen Devils speak in
[1:02:52] tongues but it's what's on your soul
[1:02:54] that's important he wasn't saying that
[1:02:56] you can have the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:58] Ghost in your soul and go to hell
[1:02:59] brother bam said you can't be lost no
[1:03:01] more than God could be
[1:03:04] lost that's the Assurance of the
[1:03:06] believer but what would the devil try to
[1:03:08] get us to do he would try to Major on
[1:03:10] something we don't need any gifts of the
[1:03:11] Spirit anymore that was the that that
[1:03:14] which is perfect is when that which is
[1:03:15] perfect has come that which is in part
[1:03:17] is done away with which is a completely
[1:03:19] Mis misapplied scripture totally
[1:03:21] completely if that's the case then at
[1:03:23] the that the time when the Apostle spoke
[1:03:25] that then there would have been no more
[1:03:27] miracles or that no more gifts or no
[1:03:29] more prophecies or no more tongues but
[1:03:31] yet there
[1:03:32] was we've seen some cut out emotion
[1:03:35] others say we don't need to teach the
[1:03:37] word of God anymore we don't need
[1:03:39] teaching we just need redac screaming
[1:03:42] and and I'm all for that listen it's my
[1:03:44] preference to have inspired preaching
[1:03:46] and to have inspired men of God who
[1:03:48] preach with a burden that's I believe I
[1:03:50] believe a real teacher teaches from a
[1:03:53] burden but to say that all we need is
[1:03:55] one kind and one type and listen don't
[1:03:58] you realize God's a god of
[1:04:01] variety God is a god of
[1:04:04] variety okay Lord I'm here and you I'm
[1:04:07] just going to follow you now God's a god
[1:04:10] of variety 1 Corinthians 12411 now there
[1:04:13] are
[1:04:14] diversities of gifts somebody say
[1:04:18] diversities there are diversities
[1:04:21] meaning that not everyone is the
[1:04:23] same not all of us are the same same not
[1:04:26] all of us not even even ministers are
[1:04:28] not all the same the preaching that you
[1:04:30] heard uh Wednesday night brother Brad is
[1:04:33] different brother brother Joe Howell is
[1:04:35] different brother Matthew's different
[1:04:36] our pastor's different brother Jason's
[1:04:39] different God uses different gifts
[1:04:41] because there's div there's diversities
[1:04:44] of gifts and you don't just need
[1:04:50] one you need them
[1:04:53] all my goodness I never not one time did
[1:04:56] I ever come to Christmas and only pick
[1:04:59] the biggest largest gift that I thought
[1:05:01] was the greatest and say I don't need
[1:05:02] any of the rest of them and just leave
[1:05:04] them covered up and never open them up
[1:05:06] and only take that one has anybody here
[1:05:08] ever done
[1:05:09] that no what do you do you take all of
[1:05:12] the
[1:05:13] gifts you open up every single one of
[1:05:15] them you but but because why because
[1:05:17] they're all for you someone bought them
[1:05:20] for you someone thought of you and said
[1:05:22] you need this and God said I'm gonna
[1:05:24] send you not just one not just one style
[1:05:27] not just one gift I'm going to give you
[1:05:28] gifts to the
[1:05:31] body there's diversities but here's the
[1:05:34] important part this is 1 Corinthians
[1:05:37] 12:4 there are diversities of gifts but
[1:05:41] the
[1:05:42] same someone say it with
[1:05:45] me the Same
[1:05:50] Spirit notice and there are differences
[1:05:54] of Administrations
[1:05:56] but the same
[1:05:59] Lord
[1:06:00] hallelujah there are diversities of
[1:06:03] operations but it is the same God which
[1:06:06] worketh
[1:06:08] all in
[1:06:10] all but the manifestation of the spirit
[1:06:13] is given to every man to profit with all
[1:06:17] so who is the manifestation of the
[1:06:19] spirit given to the
[1:06:23] preacher just the preacher
[1:06:26] just the pastor just the musician just
[1:06:28] the Deacon just the you know just the
[1:06:31] officer no the manifestation of the
[1:06:34] spirit is given to every

[1:10:14] elected bride you have something
[1:10:17] different on the inside of you you're
[1:10:20] not the same don't ever let the devil
[1:10:22] tell you that you're the same you're not
[1:10:23] the same God God makes a difference he
[1:10:27] puts a difference do you believe that
[1:10:30] this
[1:10:31] morning God makes a difference I'm just
[1:10:34] going to read you something here and I
[1:10:36] just feel the leading of the holy spirit
[1:10:38] so just just give me a moment just to
[1:10:40] find this you notice here you're not the
[1:10:42] same as them listen to what listen to
[1:10:44] what brother bandom says here and he
[1:10:46] says see he's a god of he's the god of
[1:10:47] variety that's the way leave it alone
[1:10:50] you go to tampering with nature you
[1:10:51] pervert it just leave it the way it is
[1:10:55] it's always
[1:10:58] better other words don't try to be me
[1:11:01] and I won't try to be
[1:11:05] you brother Maron made this comment he
[1:11:07] and he makes it over and over and over
[1:11:09] again through the message he said God
[1:11:10] dealt with Israel as a nation but he
[1:11:14] deals with his gentile people as
[1:11:20] individuals that's
[1:11:23] powerful you got to be so careful with
[1:11:26] that he dealt with with Israel as a
[1:11:29] nation but he deals with Gentile his
[1:11:33] elected as
[1:11:38] individuals you say brother mat thought
[1:11:40] we believed in harmony we do thought we
[1:11:42] believed in the unity of the church we
[1:11:45] do so long as each individual agrees to
[1:11:50] the word We're In
[1:11:52] Harmony but when one individual if it's
[1:11:55] the pastor if it's brother Matt if it's
[1:11:58] if it's the Deacon I don't care if it's
[1:12:00] your daddy or your
[1:12:01] mama when they disagree with the word
[1:12:04] you're no longer a unified
[1:12:07] group God isn't going to Rapture us as a
[1:12:10] church Bethal Tabernacle is not taking a
[1:12:13] churchwide Revival it's not taking a
[1:12:15] churchwide Rapture it won't be a
[1:12:17] churchwide body
[1:12:20] change all right we're in somewhere
[1:12:23] now it's not a churchwide Rapture it's
[1:12:27] not a message wide Rapture because you
[1:12:29] stream this brother and you're listen
[1:12:31] friends God it's the tactic of the devil
[1:12:34] to try to make us all unified under one
[1:12:36] one click or one group or one clan I'm
[1:12:39] part of this listen I'm glad to be part
[1:12:41] of this church I'm glad I got friends
[1:12:43] and family but I don't belong to any of
[1:12:45] you and you don't belong to me I belong
[1:12:47] to Jesus Christ I have one person who
[1:12:50] has my allegiance I am faithful to one
[1:12:53] person and that's his word word and if
[1:12:56] you leave the word I leave you and I say
[1:12:58] if I leave the word you ought to leave
[1:13:00] me if listen friends God says I I come
[1:13:03] to bring a
[1:13:04] sword that sword cuts through families
[1:13:06] cuts through mothers and fathers
[1:13:08] brothers and
[1:13:09] sisters I believe in unity but I believe
[1:13:12] that Unity comes under the revealed word
[1:13:14] of the hour and when you disagree with
[1:13:17] the revealed word of the hour I leave
[1:13:21] you
[1:13:23] hello come on some somebody help me
[1:13:26] preach now we find out bam he couldn't
[1:13:28] see it he went and looked under the
[1:13:29] people now just a minute we're great big
[1:13:32] people up here we're just scattered
[1:13:34] we're just a scattered Bunch we all
[1:13:37] believe the same that's true they all
[1:13:40] believe the same God they all worship
[1:13:42] Jehovah look at balam's sacrifice even
[1:13:45] brother Brandon begins to deal with this
[1:13:46] with Moses J of and balum and balum says
[1:13:48] you know what let's just build seven
[1:13:50] altars brother Manon said see
[1:13:52] fundamentally he was right seven altars
[1:13:55] representing seven churches uh it it all
[1:13:57] looked good it sounded like the message
[1:13:59] of the hour sounded
[1:14:01] good bam Brother s said let's build
[1:14:04] seven altars fundamentally he was just
[1:14:07] as fundamentally fundamentally right as
[1:14:10] Moses was you see you say then what was
[1:14:13] the difference the pillar of fire was
[1:14:15] the
[1:14:17] difference you say what was the
[1:14:19] difference their teaching no what was
[1:14:22] the difference their intellect no their
[1:14:24] charisma no their gift No in fact balam
[1:14:28] was a very Gifted Man in so much he
[1:14:31] Enchanted all of God's
[1:14:33] people he was charismatic he was gifted
[1:14:37] he was listen friends it doesn't matter
[1:14:39] how charismatic or how gifted a person
[1:14:42] is or how eloquent they speak you don't
[1:14:44] judge a man by how much he shouts or
[1:14:46] screams or how anointed you think he is
[1:14:48] you judging by the word of God this is
[1:14:51] your only measuring line
[1:14:55] you're judgeing by the word that's why
[1:14:57] Paul says be careful of the spirits for
[1:14:59] there are many spirits false Spirits
[1:15:01] have gone out into the world so try the
[1:15:04] spirits see whether they be of God or
[1:15:06] not you say brother man how we going to
[1:15:07] try them we've got a word and we've got
[1:15:09] a Vindicated interpretation of this word
[1:15:12] that means you don't need my opinion you
[1:15:14] don't need a brother a down the street
[1:15:16] that you can listen to on the internet
[1:15:18] you've got the Vindicated voice of God
[1:15:20] that's already revealed the word of God
[1:15:22] and you judge it by that
[1:15:28] amen we believe the same fundamentally
[1:15:31] he was right but what was difference
[1:15:33] there was a Divine Vindication upon
[1:15:34] Moses they were both
[1:15:38] prophets but under Moses's Ministry
[1:15:41] there was a pillar of
[1:15:42] fire there was a light that hung on you
[1:15:45] think that Pillar of Fire brother Bram
[1:15:47] has taken his the photograph is taken in
[1:15:49] Houston Coliseum of the Angel of the
[1:15:51] lord of the pillar of fire the the same
[1:15:53] fire that was over Moses over the
[1:15:55] children of Israel was photographed in a
[1:15:57] picture listen friends do you realize
[1:15:59] that's not the only time the pillar of
[1:16:01] fire brother Brandon would over and over
[1:16:02] and tape and say you know that picture
[1:16:04] that you see of that Pillar of Fire and
[1:16:06] you see that picture he says I see it
[1:16:08] right now in the audience that same
[1:16:10] Pillar of Fire that's in that picture is
[1:16:12] right now hanging over that person over
[1:16:14] there on the back
[1:16:15] row what was the
[1:16:19] difference he said there was a
[1:16:21] supernatural Pillar of Fire a light that
[1:16:23] hung with the camp there was Divine
[1:16:26] Healing there was a shout of the king in
[1:16:28] the camp Great Signs Divine Healing
[1:16:30] wonders and things performed among them
[1:16:33] it was a sign of a living God among his
[1:16:36] people fundamentally they were both
[1:16:40] right and so what did Bam try to do he
[1:16:42] tried to persuade them look guys we're
[1:16:44] all the same we all serve
[1:16:47] Jehovah you guys don't have to be so
[1:16:51] weird why you got to make yourself so
[1:16:53] odd
[1:16:56] I you got to make yourself so different
[1:16:58] because God said we're
[1:17:00] different why you got to make yourself
[1:17:02] so OD because God said you're my
[1:17:04] peculiar
[1:17:06] treasure it's like a man who finds a
[1:17:09] treasure there's all kinds of treasures
[1:17:11] but when he finds that peculiar one it's
[1:17:14] different than all of the
[1:17:16] rest it doesn't mean the rest isn't
[1:17:19] treasure it just means he found his
[1:17:22] treasure and he says why you why come on
[1:17:25] guys you don't need to be so odd we're
[1:17:26] all the same we all quote from the same
[1:17:29] Bible we all read the same words well
[1:17:31] listen we all believe in the deity of
[1:17:33] Jesus Christ as long as we agree upon
[1:17:35] that aren't we Brothers as long as we
[1:17:37] all agree as long as we all long as we
[1:17:40] all Quote the same Prophet long as we
[1:17:42] all wear the same clothes and look the
[1:17:45] same fundamentally they they look the
[1:17:48] same fundamentally they was both right
[1:17:51] and so balam Bewitched the people why
[1:17:55] how could Israel get to such a place
[1:17:57] that they were Bewitched by a gift that
[1:17:59] God put in the man's life you say God
[1:18:02] put that gift in balam's life every good
[1:18:04] gift comes from God the Father of
[1:18:07] Lights and so he bewitches them because
[1:18:10] why you say brother Matt how could God's
[1:18:13] family become Bewitched by a false
[1:18:15] prophet because they got their eyes off
[1:18:18] of the word and they started looking to
[1:18:21] a
[1:18:23] man right Amen brother math that's the
[1:18:26] truth they got their eyes off of the
[1:18:29] word listen when you take your eyes off
[1:18:32] the word you're opening yourself up to
[1:18:34] receive any kind of spirit I say keep
[1:18:37] your eyes on the word keep your eyes on
[1:18:40] what's Vindicated keep your eyes on what
[1:18:42] the pillar of fire has backed
[1:18:45] up they got their eyes off of the word
[1:18:48] and they started look into a
[1:18:49] gift and he bewitches them
[1:18:55] you say when did this happen brother
[1:18:57] Matt just 3 days before they cross into
[1:19:01] the promised land
[1:19:03] imagine three more days of following the
[1:19:06] Vindicated word and they would have
[1:19:08] ended up in the promised land but three
[1:19:10] days before they cross over a bewitching
[1:19:13] spirit tells the people to get your eyes
[1:19:15] off the word and start looking at a
[1:19:19] gift I heard that brother Luther amen
[1:19:25] I heard that online too God bless you
[1:19:27] thank
[1:19:28] you amen say Amen to the word of God he
[1:19:33] says but now he says I I've read he says
[1:19:35] but now I'm afraid this is a hard listen
[1:19:37] what brother random says this is 1965
[1:19:39] modern events made clear by prophecy but
[1:19:41] now I'm afraid he says this is a hard
[1:19:43] statement to make and one of these days
[1:19:45] I'll be shot for
[1:19:50] it you say brother Matt what did that
[1:19:52] ever happen it's happening today
[1:19:55] remember this the churches are being
[1:19:59] Bewitched am now this is what brother
[1:20:01] bam says was going to get him shot the
[1:20:03] churches not this not not the bars not
[1:20:07] those there on the street not the
[1:20:09] Heathen but the churches from the pull
[1:20:12] pits you see the pull pits the weakening
[1:20:15] of the pull pits has been Satan's number
[1:20:18] one
[1:20:19] goal if he can weaken the pull pit if he
[1:20:22] can shut the mouth of the preacher to
[1:20:25] dilute the word of God it would change
[1:20:27] and affect the people in such a way to
[1:20:29] where they're Bewitched by an evil
[1:20:34] spirit he says there're being Bewitched
[1:20:36] forgive me for keeping tucking my shirt
[1:20:37] and I lost some weight since I bought
[1:20:39] this
[1:20:40] suit trying to keep this belt nice and
[1:20:42] cinched
[1:20:44] up he says the churches are being
[1:20:46] Bewitched and he says by The ecumenical
[1:20:49] council he's taking you right into it to
[1:20:51] say you're the same group you're not the
[1:20:54] he says yeah you're you're just the same
[1:20:56] the prophet of God cries out and says
[1:20:57] you're not the same group come out from
[1:21:00] among that stuff and be
[1:21:04] separated or to keep away from that
[1:21:08] stuff as far as you can from it and I
[1:21:14] believe a real believer won't Buck
[1:21:16] against that or fight against that or or
[1:21:17] resist that kind of preach him a real
[1:21:19] believer will say Amen brother Matt I
[1:21:22] want to stay far away from it
[1:21:25] amen keep away from that stuff as far as
[1:21:30] you can from it you say brother Matt why
[1:21:31] cuz you don't need it listen to me
[1:21:34] Church of the Living God you don't need
[1:21:37] it you've got all that you need in the
[1:21:40] word you've got all that you need for a
[1:21:42] body change it's laying down on side of
[1:21:45] the seed show us the father it will
[1:21:47] suffice us brother random says
[1:21:48] everything that you have need of for
[1:21:50] this life's journey is already in the
[1:21:53] seat of God that's been quickened by the
[1:21:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost even the body
[1:21:59] change I say
[1:22:01] hallelujah you say then what do I got to
[1:22:03] do just believe the word Sarah believe
[1:22:06] who made the promise is able to keep the
[1:22:08] promise stop looking at your
[1:22:10] circumstances and look to the word stop
[1:22:13] looking at what you feel and look to the
[1:22:15] word I say stop looking at what you feel
[1:22:17] or you don't feel stop looking at what
[1:22:20] you think or you don't think and what
[1:22:22] comes in your mind and look to the
[1:22:23] unfailing word of
[1:22:27] God and he says how can to this listen
[1:22:30] brother balum says you know what we're
[1:22:32] we're the same let's marry let's
[1:22:34] intermar let's just let our children
[1:22:36] marry
[1:22:38] together after all we believe the same
[1:22:42] God I'm going to give you very simple
[1:22:44] words of Jesus how can two walk together
[1:22:48] unless they be
[1:22:51] agreed how can you walk with God you say
[1:22:54] walk with God how do you walk with God
[1:22:56] and disagree with his
[1:22:58] word you can't you're kidding yourself
[1:23:01] you're lying to yourself you've deceived
[1:23:03] yourself if you say you walk with God
[1:23:06] and deny any part of his word you don't
[1:23:08] walk with God I don't doubt you walk
[1:23:11] with a religious spirit I don't doubt
[1:23:13] you walk with a with a spiritual spirit
[1:23:15] I don't doubt any of
[1:23:17] that but what's the proof brother random
[1:23:21] says give it the word test you say
[1:23:24] that's not just to your brother and your
[1:23:25] sister no that's not to your brother and
[1:23:26] sister that's to you that's to me that's
[1:23:30] why the Bible says make your call in an
[1:23:31] election sure see whether you be in the
[1:23:34] faith or not I say it's high time we
[1:23:36] reckon ourselves with the word of God
[1:23:39] and say Lord is my life lining up with
[1:23:41] the word am I intertwined am I in
[1:23:44] agreement does my life walk with the
[1:23:46] word or is there a part of me that
[1:23:50] doesn't want to see that side of God
[1:23:53] amen amen
[1:23:56] brother renom says how can you add
[1:23:57] Creeds when you're ordained not to do it
[1:24:00] and commanded not to do it you can't do
[1:24:02] it there's no way of doing it brother or
[1:24:04] sister you can't mix that leaven with
[1:24:06] the unleavened oil and water won't mix
[1:24:10] Darkness and Light Won't mix hear me
[1:24:13] young person Darkness and Light Won't
[1:24:15] mix you want the word of God in your
[1:24:18] life then pour your life pour the word
[1:24:20] of God into your life you want the power
[1:24:23] of God in your life you can't mix it
[1:24:24] with the evil things of the world and
[1:24:26] expect the power of
[1:24:28] God o water won't
[1:24:31] mix and let me just say this light is so
[1:24:34] much more powerful than
[1:24:36] Darkness man light is so much more
[1:24:39] powerful than Darkness you let the light
[1:24:41] of the Gospel of Jesus Christ shine in
[1:24:43] your heart and watch what things will
[1:24:45] take place in your life it'll overtake
[1:24:48] all of the darkness the devil has poured
[1:24:50] in you for 20 years it'll dispel all of
[1:24:53] your doubts and all of your complexes
[1:24:55] and all of the all of the the things
[1:24:57] that you hate about yourself let the
[1:24:58] light of the word come in your heart
[1:25:01] accept the word of God in its
[1:25:06] fullness say brother Matt but I've done
[1:25:09] that I've accepted the Lord Jesus I've
[1:25:12] accepted him with all of my heart oh

[1:25:24] famous painter who's painted that

[1:25:28] heart and the man says you painted it
[1:25:30] all wrong that you there those there's

[1:26:34] and he says now now there's doors inside
[1:26:37] of door once you open that door to the
[1:26:39] Lord Jesus and he says when you go

[1:26:45] heart surgeon tell you about your
[1:26:48] heart let him diagnose you brother

[1:27:15] on the right's another
[1:27:17] door and he said and that's the door of
[1:27:22] Pride and he says and we've all got that
[1:27:25] door of
[1:27:26] Pride that Pride that raises up and says
[1:27:29] I don't like what's being
[1:27:32] preached that's not what that that's not

[1:28:05] God come to you and and and and sharply
[1:28:08] correct something that maybe you're
[1:28:09] proud over are you wanted to hold on to
[1:28:11] so bad and something raises up within
[1:28:13] you and says I don't know that's a
[1:28:15] little bit
[1:28:17] much I think I'll stick with what I you
[1:28:20] know what you're doing you're allowing
[1:28:21] Pride to get in the way of welcoming the
[1:28:23] Lord into your
[1:28:27] house and brother ROM says there's that
[1:28:29] little door of Pride and you tune him
[1:28:32] out you don't want to hear that you just
[1:28:34] tune that voice
[1:28:37] out and he says then you go into that
[1:28:39] little door that little door of Pride
[1:28:41] and he says and you watch people we had
[1:28:43] this but I don't want to even take the
[1:28:45] time I'm just all over the place so just
[1:28:46] forgive me this morning but brother
[1:28:48] random says he says in that message do
[1:28:50] is and door in Slide Five and he says
[1:28:53] maybe you might say preacher I just did
[1:28:55] that I I opened my heart I let Jesus
[1:28:58] come in I did that 10 years ago I 20
[1:29:01] years ago well that may be exactly right
[1:29:03] but is that all you
[1:29:05] done I want to ask you now if you would
[1:29:08] invite somebody in your house and then
[1:29:10] when you got inside the door somebody
[1:29:13] invited you rather say come in now
[1:29:15] listen to what brother bandam says you
[1:29:17] invite them to your house and then they
[1:29:19] knock on your door and you say come in
[1:29:21] and he says that's the way a lot of
[1:29:23] people accept Christ see I belong to
[1:29:26] church I belong to so and so down here

[1:29:32] biggest church the mayor goes there

[1:29:36] church they let him in just that
[1:29:40] much yeah I'll accept him see for a
[1:29:44] personal
[1:29:45] game but when he says but but what then
[1:29:48] when Jesus comes into the heart many
[1:29:51] people accept him because they don't
[1:29:53] want to go to heaven hell but when Jesus
[1:29:55] comes into your heart he wants to be
[1:29:58] Lord not just a savior but Lord also
[1:30:03] Lord is
[1:30:05] rulership amen he comes in to take over
[1:30:10] I believe a real believer says take over
[1:30:12] Lord take over Lord take over my mouth
[1:30:16] take over my mind take over my wardrobe
[1:30:20] take over every thought that oh hands

[1:30:29] aside everything I might have thought
[1:30:31] before and I welcome the word in my
[1:30:34] life if it comes to correct me to cut me
[1:30:37] then I welcome the
[1:30:41] word brother Ron says and you knocked at

[1:30:55] want you meddle around in my
[1:30:59] house you stand right there at the
[1:31:06] door this is about as far as some people
[1:31:09] get I've accepted amen I go to church
[1:31:11] don't I I say I believe the message
[1:31:14] don't I I say I accept God sent a
[1:31:16] prophet don't I but do you do you invite
[1:31:18] the Lord do you welcome the whole
[1:31:20] word into your heart even the the parts
[1:31:24] you understand and the parts you don't
[1:31:26] understand even the parts your carnal
[1:31:29] nature agrees with and the parts that
[1:31:30] your carnal nature disagrees with do you
[1:31:34] welcome all of the
[1:31:36] word or do you just hold him at Bay
[1:31:39] right
[1:31:40] there yeah come on in I don't want you
[1:31:43] meddle around nothing in my house you
[1:31:45] stand right there at the door now inside
[1:31:48] the human heart there's many little
[1:31:50] doors little doors covers up a lot of
[1:31:52] things just just let him in that isn't
[1:31:55] all of it when he does come in them
[1:31:57] brother ROM says he says this in the
[1:31:59] message thirst them disciples couldn't
[1:32:01] understand it but they believed it
[1:32:03] that's right if you can't if you believe
[1:32:05] it I can't understand many things I
[1:32:08] believe it anyhow because God said it
[1:32:10] was so brother ROM says them disciples
[1:32:13] couldn't understand it knowledge you
[1:32:15] know Satan's gospel is knowledge did you
[1:32:18] know that he preached it in the Garden
[1:32:20] of Eden to Eve and she was deceived by
[1:32:22] his knowledge of God
[1:32:24] by his knowledge gospel and has polluted
[1:32:27] the whole human race with it they've
[1:32:29] took educational programs put them in
[1:32:31] the church they're all right though he
[1:32:32] says they're all right out there but not
[1:32:34] in God's word no sir you don't know God
[1:32:37] by education you don't know by knowing
[1:32:40] and learning mathematics and pronouncing
[1:32:42] big
[1:32:43] words Paul was a smart was a smart man
[1:32:46] but when he come to Christ and received
[1:32:48] the Holy Spirit went to the Corinthians
[1:32:50] he said I never come to you with
[1:32:52] enticing words of man's Wisdom wisdom
[1:32:54] though he could have done it he said I
[1:32:56] come to you in the power and
[1:32:58] manifestation of the Holy Ghost that
[1:33:00] your faith would be in God not in the
[1:33:03] wisdom of some
[1:33:05] man now sometimes we make the church
[1:33:08] programs they also call their pastor
[1:33:11] church goes to vote the pastor they say
[1:33:12] well this pastor now he's got two
[1:33:15] degrees in college he learned four years
[1:33:17] of psychology he took this that and the
[1:33:19] other and they'll vote that kind of a
[1:33:21] man in why instead of a pastor who
[1:33:25] believes in God's word being inspired
[1:33:28] and being God and will preach the word
[1:33:31] regardless of how people feel about
[1:33:35] it God told Ezekiel he said preach that
[1:33:39] whether they believe it or not you
[1:33:41] preach it
[1:33:42] anyhow whether they accept it or not
[1:33:45] they didn't accept Jesus he went right
[1:33:47] on preach and see it's just the same and
[1:33:49] if a real Pastor will really preach the
[1:33:52] word and believe in God they try to
[1:33:54] bring little intellect the man who's got
[1:33:56] the best education the man who can stand
[1:33:58] in the pulpit and take just about 15
[1:34:00] minutes so they can go home right quick
[1:34:03] and go do something
[1:34:07] else oh oh so you mean that spirit that
[1:34:11] gets on me in church when I go man how
[1:34:13] long much longer is he going to be you
[1:34:16] mean that came from the pits of hell
[1:34:21] yeah how much longer can we get you give
[1:34:24] me somebody that'll just preach me a
[1:34:25] 15minute sermon brother B says go home
[1:34:28] right quick Ricky can get his hot ride
[1:34:30] and start out and they can go to twist
[1:34:31] parties and everything oh it's just
[1:34:33] nothing else but a hybrid educational
[1:34:35] pollution just exactly what is right
[1:34:37] that's right but what is it what is it
[1:34:40] why do they do that because it satisfies
[1:34:44] their
[1:34:45] taste it
[1:34:47] satisfies a worldly Church member's
[1:34:50] taste oh but can I just stay say this to
[1:34:53] you it don't satisfy a believer's taste
[1:34:56] it don't satisfy a real bride member of
[1:34:59] Jesus Christ she says give me the word
[1:35:01] give me all of the word don't give me
[1:35:03] some educational system give me the
[1:35:06] power of God demonstrated by the
[1:35:08] quickening power oh how many Believers
[1:35:10] are here with me will say give me the
[1:35:12] word give me all of the word I don't
[1:35:15] want some program I don't want some
[1:35:17] intellectual system I want the power of
[1:35:19] the Living God to tell me when I'm wrong
[1:35:22] to pick me up when I'm down to encourage
[1:35:25] me when I'm
[1:35:26] discouraged I want all of the word of
[1:35:30] God I don't satisfy a Saint's taste
[1:35:33] he'll take the word every
[1:35:39] time you see you can't mix it with your
[1:35:42] idea if you mix it with your idea you'll
[1:35:45] abort its effects
[1:35:49] amen I said if you mix the message with
[1:35:52] your own idea it will abort the effects
[1:35:55] of the message you say what is the
[1:35:58] effect of the message to change you to
[1:36:01] reconstruct everything that you think to
[1:36:04] to to annihilate all of your old
[1:36:06] Concepts and ideas and to give you the
[1:36:08] mind of
[1:36:10] Christ what's the effects of the message
[1:36:13] to change your body to change your
[1:36:15] spirit to change every part of you but
[1:36:18] if you mix it with our ideas if we mix
[1:36:22] it and hybrate it we abort its effect on
[1:36:25] our
[1:36:26] life you can't mix leaven with the
[1:36:31] unleaving the world Jesus said what
[1:36:34] Fellowship does was does God have with
[1:36:37] Mammon or does the s or or to B they
[1:36:41] don't they don't mix there's no
[1:36:44] mixing you can't mix the bride you can't
[1:36:48] mix the bride's word and the
[1:36:50] denominational word it won't mix
[1:36:55] you can try to organize it it won't
[1:36:58] organize you can become a one man
[1:37:00] denomination a oneman
[1:37:03] organization when you camp around your
[1:37:05] idea but listen you can't mix it with
[1:37:08] the word it won't
[1:37:12] mix oh can I just preach by the
[1:37:14] inspiration of the Holy Spirit you can't
[1:37:16] mix your psychology with it you can't
[1:37:19] mix your education with it you can't Mi
[1:37:22] mix your emotion with it you can't mix
[1:37:24] your doubt with it you can't mix your
[1:37:27] fear with it it won't
[1:37:30] mix you say then what do we got to do we
[1:37:32] got to welcome the pure unadulterated
[1:37:35] word of God just say give me all of the
[1:37:38] word the unadulterated word of God give
[1:37:41] me the pure word of
[1:37:43] God I want to just encourage you here as
[1:37:45] we close because this is really my my
[1:37:48] thought that the Lord really has
[1:37:50] burdened me with and it's it's just so
[1:37:52] over the last my goodness 9 10 days it's
[1:37:56] even been confusing to me I come back to
[1:37:58] something so simple something so
[1:38:02] simple I I just want to share because
[1:38:04] I'd be disobedient to the Lord not to
[1:38:06] share it with you something so simple
[1:38:08] the Lord just just continually night and
[1:38:11] day put in upon my heart and I want to
[1:38:14] say it to this whole church and I want
[1:38:15] to really the young people to tune
[1:38:20] in it is the devil's tactic
[1:38:24] to push us into ditches to make us
[1:38:27] extreme on one thing and not so extreme
[1:38:30] on the other and as we said and we took
[1:38:33] a minute just to say that we've seen
[1:38:35] some cut out emotion others say we don't
[1:38:37] need teaching some cut out dancing in
[1:38:40] the spirit to say we don't need to dance
[1:38:41] in the spirit then others cut out and
[1:38:43] say we don't need brotherly love we just
[1:38:45] need the bare-fisted gospel I believe in
[1:38:47] all of those things we don't need to
[1:38:49] love each other some say we don't need
[1:38:51] the tapes anymore we don't need to quote
[1:38:53] the the prophet
[1:38:55] anymore others say all we need is the
[1:38:57] prophet we don't need preachers all we
[1:39:00] need don't you realize What's Happening
[1:39:03] Here we we don't we don't need the
[1:39:05] message we just need the Bible just give
[1:39:08] me the Bible I don't need the
[1:39:10] message just give me the Bible and then
[1:39:12] others say I don't need the Bible just
[1:39:15] give me the
[1:39:17] message it's one side of the other am
[1:39:20] it's always the devil's tactic to push
[1:39:23] into ditches some cut out repentance and
[1:39:27] say you don't need the The Cutting word
[1:39:29] of God
[1:39:30] anymore others believe in The Cutting
[1:39:32] word of God but they don't believe in
[1:39:36] grace it's always the tactic of the
[1:39:39] devil to push us into
[1:39:42] ditches but brother random says but the
[1:39:44] true bride will draw from both ditches
[1:39:47] and walk down the middle of the
[1:39:50] road you say brother Matt what are we to
[1:39:52] be we're to be the first
[1:39:54] church you say the first church that's
[1:39:57] exactly right as brother Henry green
[1:39:59] would say God started his church how he
[1:40:01] wanted it now he wants it as he started
[1:40:03] it we're to be restored back to what a
[1:40:07] book of Acts again an Apostolic Faith
[1:40:10] with Apostolic power and Apostolic signs
[1:40:13] and Apostolic
[1:40:16] life and what part of the apostolic life
[1:40:20] all of it
[1:40:22] hallah every bit of it not just one part
[1:40:27] of
[1:40:28] it then what did the first church have
[1:40:30] let me tell you what the first church
[1:40:32] had the first church had the
[1:40:34] knowledge of the word of
[1:40:36] God because they read the word of God
[1:40:40] Amen the Bible says they continued
[1:40:41] steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine
[1:40:43] reading the word of God studying the
[1:40:45] word of God they had the revelation of
[1:40:48] the word they taught it and they
[1:40:50] preached it and more importantly than
[1:40:52] teaching it and preaching it the gospel
[1:40:55] needs to be
[1:40:56] lived they didn't just teach it and
[1:40:58] preach it on Sundays and Wednesdays they
[1:41:01] lived the
[1:41:03] gospel I say we don't just need to teach
[1:41:05] the message and preach the message we
[1:41:08] need a church that says let me live the
[1:41:10] message let me live it in my life let it
[1:41:13] take on
[1:41:15] skin let me live it out in my daily life
[1:41:19] they lived it the first church had the
[1:41:22] power and Dem demonstration of the Holy
[1:41:24] Spirit they had the manifestations of
[1:41:27] all of the gifts of the Spirit not just
[1:41:30] Paul not just Peter not just Barnabas
[1:41:34] not just the APO listen it wasn't just a
[1:41:36] few men it was the whole
[1:41:39] body they had the entire body was
[1:41:42] operating the gifts the Ley in the
[1:41:46] church had the demonstration of the Holy
[1:41:49] Ghost they weren't just absorbers
[1:41:50] brother Matt they didn't just sit there
[1:41:52] and listen
[1:41:53] no they weren't listeners they were
[1:41:56] doers we've got enough listeners we need
[1:41:59] some
[1:42:00] doers doers of the word of God they had
[1:42:04] the divine nature of Jesus and dwelling
[1:42:08] their bodies on a daily basis they were
[1:42:12] not just strong fisted iron hearted
[1:42:16] non-compromising non jellyfish they were
[1:42:19] also kindly affectionate in love and
[1:42:23] Grace one with
[1:42:25] another you can be hard fisted and bear
[1:42:29] and solid in your stand for the word of
[1:42:31] God you don't have to be a jellyfish to
[1:42:33] love
[1:42:36] somebody you can be strong and bold on
[1:42:39] the word of
[1:42:41] God and have love and grace for others
[1:42:44] in fact if you really love someone you
[1:42:46] will tell them the
[1:42:48] truth as brother bham says they get mad
[1:42:51] at me for preaching on women and how
[1:42:52] women dresses and cutting their hair and
[1:42:54] wearing pants and putting on makeup he
[1:42:56] says they you're just a woman hater
[1:42:57] brother BR says no I'm not I'm just
[1:42:58] trying to keep you out of Torment in
[1:43:00] hell that's real love Real Love is when
[1:43:04] you know the condition of someone will
[1:43:06] lead them to hell and so you have enough
[1:43:08] love for their soul whether it's your
[1:43:11] child your mother your father your
[1:43:13] brother your boss or your coworker you
[1:43:16] love their soul not their feelings you
[1:43:19] love their soul enough to say brother
[1:43:21] I'm going to tell you the truth in love
[1:43:25] they were kindly affectionate one for
[1:43:28] another this is what the word not
[1:43:31] emotion not a gift not Charisma not a
[1:43:35] organization not a movement not a cult
[1:43:37] not a click not a Brotherhood it's not
[1:43:40] what the message is it's the word made
[1:43:45] flesh and when the word's made flesh it
[1:43:49] operates I'm going to make a very
[1:43:51] important distinction you say brother
[1:43:52] Matt do you mean that you've preached on
[1:43:54] shouting and jumping and dancing and
[1:43:55] speaking in tongues or you mean that
[1:43:57] every believer should shout and jum
[1:43:58] dance no you don't have to ever shout
[1:44:00] you don't ever have to jump you don't
[1:44:02] ever have to speak in tongues in fact
[1:44:04] you don't have to do any of that but let
[1:44:06] me make a very important clear
[1:44:07] distinction if the Holy Ghost wants to
[1:44:09] do that you better not restrict him from
[1:44:12] doing
[1:44:14] it because often times the reason people
[1:44:17] don't speak in tongues is because of the
[1:44:19] pride human pride of what others will
[1:44:21] think and you are just as much
[1:44:24] subverting the word of God as a person
[1:44:26] who says I don't even believe in
[1:44:28] tongues most people never dance in the
[1:44:30] spirit because they're ashamed of what
[1:44:32] might others might think of them and
[1:44:34] change their social status most people
[1:44:36] let me just tell
[1:44:38] you anytime you ever dance in the spirit
[1:44:40] or speak in tongues it's because of one
[1:44:42] thing you bypassed the veil of Pride
[1:44:45] you've went beyond the pride the the the
[1:44:47] veil of what others might think and you
[1:44:49] get to the point and say I don't care
[1:44:51] what they might think I don't don't care
[1:44:53] what they might say I'm going to react
[1:44:56] because the Holy Ghost is in my
[1:44:59] body most of the time people never do is
[1:45:01] because they don't you say what is that
[1:45:03] brother mat that's not accepting the
[1:45:05] word in its
[1:45:09] fullness cuz when you accept the word in
[1:45:12] its fullness and you don't hold him at
[1:45:13] the door you say you're Lord of all Lord
[1:45:16] and you do anything you want with this
[1:45:18] Tabernacle you say whatever you want to
[1:45:21] say with this Temple
[1:45:23] amen they were they they had the word
[1:45:27] they were kindly affectionate one to
[1:45:29] another with brotherly love the ministry
[1:45:33] had Brotherly Love they spoke the
[1:45:37] truth
[1:45:38] Amen in love
[1:45:42] amen they spoke it in
[1:45:45] love not as a
[1:45:48] bully not as a
[1:45:50] bully the bullies have no place in the
[1:45:53] pull pit bullies have no place in a in a
[1:45:56] Believer they didn't speak it harshly
[1:45:59] just to tear somebody
[1:46:00] down but they spoke the truth with love
[1:46:04] does that mean they danced around their
[1:46:05] feelings
[1:46:08] no but they spoke the truth the first
[1:46:12] church had the gifts of the
[1:46:14] Spirit they had the gifts of the
[1:46:19] Spirit
[1:46:21] Faith they had the work in of Miracles
[1:46:24] they had wisdom what are the gifts of
[1:46:26] the Spirit they had Faith wisdom
[1:46:28] knowledge they spoke in tongues they
[1:46:31] interpreted in tongues they interpreted
[1:46:33] tongues they had the gifts of healing
[1:46:36] they had the working of Miracles they
[1:46:38] had the gifts of Prophecy they had the
[1:46:40] Discerning of the spirit why did they
[1:46:42] have that because the word is what they
[1:46:44] crowned the word is what they put on the
[1:46:47] throne and when the word is on the
[1:46:49] throne all of his gifts are available to
[1:46:52] the rest of the
[1:46:55] Kingdom oh I'm so glad they had the
[1:46:57] gifts I want the gifts let me tell you
[1:46:59] what else they had they had the
[1:47:03] fruits and you can't have the gifts if
[1:47:06] you don't have the
[1:47:08] fruits in fact the most perfect gift is
[1:47:11] the fruit of
[1:47:13] love
[1:47:15] love not worldly love real love Jesus
[1:47:21] love they have the fruits of the spirit
[1:47:24] you say what are those love joy peace
[1:47:26] longsuffering meekness Temperance
[1:47:29] godliness
[1:47:31] Faith they had the gifts they had the
[1:47:35] fruits they had the preaching they had
[1:47:38] the teaching they had varities and
[1:47:41] varieties and diversities of people
[1:47:43] because not everybody's the same nor
[1:47:45] does God want us to all be the
[1:47:47] same and God help us if we've got to the
[1:47:49] place to where we've tried to make all
[1:47:51] of our churches the same and make all of
[1:47:53] our preachers and think we all need to
[1:47:54] be at one church under one Ministry
[1:47:56] listen there's only one worldwide
[1:47:58] Ministry and it was William branham's
[1:48:01] Ministry it's not the ministry of a
[1:48:03] brother of a of a of a of a of a mega
[1:48:06] message church or a small little
[1:48:08] storefront God needs them all God needs
[1:48:10] all of the body to work in Harmony and I
[1:48:13] say God let me be in my position let me
[1:48:16] find my place in the body let me accept
[1:48:19] the word in its fullness with its gifts
[1:48:22] and it's fruits oh do I have a church
[1:48:24] that'll say God make me what you made me
[1:48:27] to be let me surrender my vessel to
[1:48:30] accept the
[1:48:32] word to welcome him in every door of my
[1:48:37] heart not to Camp down on one side or
[1:48:41] the other side and if there's ever a
[1:48:43] scarecrow that's been given listen we do
[1:48:45] not battle I'm just going to be straight
[1:48:47] up and be honest with you we do not
[1:48:49] battle a spirit of deifying brother
[1:48:51] brandom in this church right say we
[1:48:54] exempt from that Spirit no we're not
[1:48:55] exempt you're not exempt from any Spirit
[1:48:57] any Spirit can come in here but let me
[1:48:59] just say every church has its own
[1:49:00] battles they have their own Wars brother
[1:49:02] Brandon would even say Nations have have
[1:49:04] spirits and every nation has to battle a
[1:49:06] different Spirit America is a hahhaa
[1:49:09] hahaa laughter joking everything's a
[1:49:11] joke and he said that was the American
[1:49:13] Spirit that's what you've got to
[1:49:15] fight but I don't fight the spirit on
[1:49:17] Finland I don't fite the fight the
[1:49:19] spirit that a a brother a believer in
[1:49:21] Germany he has a spirit he's got to
[1:49:22] fight fight and I'll go further and say
[1:49:24] every church has a spirit that they've
[1:49:25] got to fight and War and contend against
[1:49:27] I'll go further and say every family has
[1:49:29] a strain in their family they've got to
[1:49:31] fight and War and contend and always
[1:49:34] keep in
[1:49:36] check and I'm not going to fight your
[1:49:38] battle so don't try to fight mine and
[1:49:40] I'm not going to tell you how to fight
[1:49:42] yours you don't tell me how to fight
[1:49:43] mine I say everybody needs to be
[1:49:45] fighting their own battle they're on
[1:49:47] post of
[1:49:50] Duty and not looking to the left or to
[1:49:52] the right as a group this is an
[1:49:55] individual
[1:49:56] Affair we've lost our identity as
[1:49:59] Believers we're not careful we mix up
[1:50:02] our identity that we're a big group we
[1:50:04] are a group we are a church God does
[1:50:05] have local bodies but God's not dealing
[1:50:09] with bethl Tabernacle as a group he's
[1:50:12] dealing with us as
[1:50:17] individuals I tell you who I've seen at
[1:50:18] the men's prayer meeting on Thursday
[1:50:20] nights as brothers who are in
[1:50:22] individually concerned with their own
[1:50:25] desperation of their own
[1:50:29] family or they're individually concerned
[1:50:32] with the burdens of their own hearts and
[1:50:34] own needs that's why they come to a
[1:50:37] Thursday night men's prayer meeting cuz
[1:50:39] they're desperate for something they
[1:50:41] want more of the power of God they want
[1:50:43] more dedication they want more
[1:50:45] consecration I believe that should be
[1:50:47] the Cry of every man in this church to
[1:50:50] say God give us a church that that's on
[1:50:53] fire with the fire of God I know we're
[1:50:55] not a group but I'd like to have a group
[1:50:57] with me I'd like to have Believers uh
[1:50:59] with me that are on the same page are
[1:51:01] fighting the same battle that have the
[1:51:03] same desire to say Lord we want to see
[1:51:05] you in our midst we want to see you in
[1:51:08] our music we want to see you in our
[1:51:09] young people oh can I get somebody who
[1:51:12] would agree with the preaching today and
[1:51:14] say I want to see the Lord all of the
[1:51:16] Lord in my body in the music in the
[1:51:19] young people in the pullit in the church
[1:51:22] in the ly I want to see God having full
[1:51:25] operation and full
[1:51:29] Sway and if the devil could do anything
[1:51:32] we do not battle a spirit of deine the
[1:51:35] tapes or push play that's just not our
[1:51:38] battle I would go darce to say that that
[1:51:41] wouldn't be the Battle of any I could be
[1:51:42] wrong that wouldn't be the struggle with
[1:51:44] anybody if I'd preach on a spirit trying
[1:51:46] to deify our spirit trying to get us to
[1:51:48] shut up preachers and push play in the
[1:51:50] pull pit you can preach that all day
[1:51:52] long come to our church and preach it to
[1:51:53] red in the face and preach it for an
[1:51:54] hour and you'll get amens but I
[1:51:57] guarantee you you're not going to find
[1:51:58] many with that spirit inside of
[1:52:01] them you say brother matth then what is
[1:52:03] the spirit I guarantee you we got one
[1:52:06] that may not be our battle if anything
[1:52:07] our battle is to deemphasize the tape if
[1:52:11] anything if the devil can do anything to
[1:52:13] our churches and our young people is to
[1:52:15] deemphasize the voice of God's prophet
[1:52:18] and I'm going to come down a little bit
[1:52:20] closer because I feel the holy H Spirit
[1:52:23] right now want to say something if
[1:52:25] anything we battle at bethl Tabernacle
[1:52:28] at our church in our youth and our young
[1:52:30] people in my own life and our lives if
[1:52:33] anything if the devil's not going to get
[1:52:35] us brother Brandon said if he can't make
[1:52:37] you uh uh go follow he says fall on the
[1:52:40] cliff on this side he'll push you to the
[1:52:42] other side and just kick you over the
[1:52:43] edge on the
[1:52:45] opposite and if anything we've done is
[1:52:47] we've deemphasized listen to me and my
[1:52:49] brother my sister I want to make my
[1:52:51] burden so C clear to you this morning
[1:52:53] because it's so personal to me if you
[1:52:56] are not listening to the tape voice if
[1:52:59] you are not feeding on the tape voice
[1:53:02] you will have no faith for a body change
[1:53:04] or a
[1:53:06] Rapture you say well my daddy and my
[1:53:08] mama don't that don't matter you're an
[1:53:10] individual and God will not judge you
[1:53:12] based upon your mom and your dad God
[1:53:15] will judge you based upon you and it
[1:53:18] doesn't matter what others are doing
[1:53:20] around you if you are not hearing the
[1:53:21] voice of indication and that's not
[1:53:24] brother Matt and that's not brother
[1:53:27] Jason that's not any brother there's one
[1:53:30] voice of vindication and if you're not
[1:53:32] feeding on the word of the hour I am I
[1:53:36] am fully persuaded more than ever before
[1:53:39] if our people would hear the voice of
[1:53:41] God's Prophet more on a daily basis we'd
[1:53:44] have 90% of the spirit and problems
[1:53:47] destroyed in the church today if our
[1:53:50] churches were hearing stop fighting War
[1:53:52] Wars that don't belong to you stop
[1:53:54] fighting battles that have nothing to do
[1:53:56] with you if you would hear the voice of
[1:53:59] vindication and stop questioning
[1:54:01] everything we'd have 90% of our battles
[1:54:04] and our families and our homes and our
[1:54:06] young people would be
[1:54:12] gone now that's just for here those on
[1:54:14] the live stream if you don't like that I
[1:54:16] apologize I'm just preaching to our
[1:54:18] church right
[1:54:19] here if anything more than ever before
[1:54:23] we need to be hearing the
[1:54:26] voice that God sent in this
[1:54:29] generation there's only one voice that
[1:54:31] can turn your heart back and it's not
[1:54:34] enough to hear Brother Matt put it on
[1:54:36] Powerpoints and slides it's not enough
[1:54:38] listen friends you can treat the word so
[1:54:40] many different ways some people treat
[1:54:42] the word of God like a horoscope and
[1:54:45] they get their daily dose that's okay
[1:54:46] I'm not saying you can't do that but
[1:54:49] some people open up the Bible I'm just
[1:54:50] going to be practical can I be PR
[1:54:52] practical and we'll close don't get
[1:54:54] scared I'm
[1:54:56] closing some people treat the word of
[1:54:58] God that way and they treat their I'm
[1:55:00] not I'm not even saying that you can't
[1:55:01] do that but some people they this is how
[1:55:04] they treat the word it's it's all in how
[1:55:06] you approach the word everybody has a
[1:55:09] different approach to the word you
[1:55:11] approach the message differently and you
[1:55:12] approach the Bible differently some
[1:55:14] people look for one sentence just one
[1:55:17] word they open their Bible and just give
[1:55:19] me give me a word for the day it's like
[1:55:21] a horoscope
[1:55:23] hope and I'm not saying there's not
[1:55:25] value in that a lot of times I'll Do
[1:55:27] Lord I'm going through a situation just
[1:55:28] give me one little son God will give me
[1:55:30] one little
[1:55:31] verse but listen friends if you really
[1:55:33] want to get to know
[1:55:35] him you've got to find more than just a
[1:55:39] quote or more than just a verse the word
[1:55:42] is so much more than just a daily
[1:55:44] horoscope it's more than just your daily
[1:55:47] dose of the
[1:55:49] word you've got something to live listen
[1:55:53] it's good to have things to live by
[1:55:55] that's that's how that's how many people
[1:55:57] you read the Bible and you want good
[1:55:58] sound advice that's good but let me just
[1:56:00] say there's a person in this Bible
[1:56:04] there's a person on those tapes who is
[1:56:06] speaking there's a voice that's speaking
[1:56:08] to your soul and it's more than just a
[1:56:11] daily dose or a word of
[1:56:16] advice people treat it like medically
[1:56:19] the medicinal approach just a little bit
[1:56:21] you know one ver a day keeps the devil
[1:56:24] away just one quote a day keeps the
[1:56:26] devil away and if I just hear that one
[1:56:27] quote I just got it playing while I'm
[1:56:29] sleeping and though I don't hear listen
[1:56:31] that's wonderful there there's value I'm
[1:56:32] not I'm not disparaging any of that
[1:56:35] there's value there's Great Value in
[1:56:37] just hearing the words hearing the
[1:56:38] prophet's voice reading your Bible and
[1:56:40] just to read it just devotional
[1:56:42] devotional reading is good not
[1:56:45] discouraging that but friends he's more
[1:56:47] than a
[1:56:49] devotion he's more than a devotion he's
[1:56:52] more than your favorite uh uh uh meme
[1:56:55] he's more than you you have you Facebook
[1:56:57] and Instagram and I'll put up a quote or
[1:56:59] put up a picture put up a little
[1:57:00] oneliner and it's wonderful and I love
[1:57:02] him but let me just say he wants to come
