[5:51] usually is streaming our Wednesday night
[5:54] services.

[6:16] my heart.
[6:18] How a holy being could look down on a
[6:20] man, a human being.
[6:24] And Father, you bridged that gap.
[6:29] And you're looking at your son, the
[6:31] price that you paid.
[6:33] And Lord, by faith, I'm walking in that.
[6:36] And so are these that are here, all

[6:45] one word, maybe a whole bunch of words,
[6:48] but touch our hearts this evening, Lord.
[6:51] Anoint us. Anoint the speaker. Anoint
[6:53] the words that come forth. Father, as we
[6:56] collect the tithes and offerings,
[6:58] Father, we pray that you bless the
[6:59] cheerful giver.
[7:02] I pray that you would look down, help us
[7:03] to worship you in spirit and in truth,
[7:05] and that you would be pleased with us,

[30:26] he estimates that right when they're
[30:29] starting to pray for run their prayer

[31:01] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[31:04] day. And Adam and his wife hid
[31:07] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[31:09] God amongst the trees of the garden. And
[31:13] the Lord God called unto Adam, and said
[31:15] unto him, "Where art thou?" And he said,
[31:19] I heard thy voice in the garden, and I
[31:22] was afraid, because I was naked, and I
[31:25] hid myself. And he said, Who told thee
[31:28] that thou was naked? Hast thou eaten of
[31:32] the tree whereof I commanded thee that
[31:35] thou should us not eat? Let's pray.
[31:39] Father, we thank you for your word
[31:41] tonight, and we look to it with earnest
[31:44] hearts for all that you will have for
[31:45] us. Lord, it's been a thrill for me
[31:48] throughout the day today to look and
[31:50] study and prepare for this next part,
[31:52] Lord. And I I saw began to look at it
[31:56] even from Sunday. And Lord, you're just
[31:58] so kind to us with your word. So we
[32:00] thank you. We ask that it be effective,
[32:03] Lord, that the spirit of God give us
[32:05] hearing hearts tonight and willing. May
[32:08] we be willing hearts tonight, ready to
[32:10] say amen to every word. Grant it, Lord.
[32:13] Don't let us come up short, Father.
[32:15] Because we realize, Lord, that that you
[32:18] have you have supplied us amply. And if
[32:21] we come up short and don't get what we
[32:23] need, then that's not on you. It's on
[32:25] us, Father. So help us tonight, Lord. We
[32:28] commit it to you in Jesus name. Amen.
[32:30] God bless you friends. You can be
[32:31] seated.
[32:42] All right. Um, Gideon, so let's have my
[32:45] PowerPoint up, please.
[32:47] Amen. We'll get the title screen.
[32:59] Amen. I sent it to the Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
[33:02] Good deal.
[33:06] So, I wanted to take and recap just for
[33:08] a few minutes. I want to I've got I'm
[33:11] only going to use this PowerPoint for
[33:12] recap. In fact, because I don't want to
[33:14] be slowed down when I get uh beyond the
[33:17] recap. And I just want to look at
[33:19] Sunday. We were talking about uh various
[33:22] dramas. And so tonight we're going to
[33:25] take a subtitle, face tof face with God.
[33:28] And you'll understand that a little more
[33:31] as we go along. We picked up Sunday and
[33:34] from Sunday we had the garden drama.
[33:37] You'll remember brother Brandham says
[33:38] here when God knew that that shocking
[33:40] state of emergency, his children was
[33:43] lost and he came frantically up and down
[33:45] the through the garden. He went looking
[33:47] under every bush. Adam, oh my son, Adam,
[33:52] where art thou? We went from there and
[33:55] we looked briefly at the at the drama
[33:57] that unfolded at Kadesh Barnea. Brother
[33:59] Brandham calls it at that's his words
[34:01] there, a great drama of the Bible. And
[34:05] from the scripture here, brother
[34:07] Brandham uses this scripture. And Caleb
[34:10] stilled the people before Moses and
[34:13] said, "Let us go up at once and possess
[34:16] it for we are able to overcome it." And
[34:19] that was a big deal. That was a big
[34:21] drama that was being played out. And you
[34:24] talking about drama and some drama
[34:25] queens that were there. And all of those
[34:28] drama queens were saying, "Oh, they're
[34:30] like we're like grasshoppers. They're
[34:32] giants. There's no way. we don't stand a
[34:34] chance. And Caleb, Caleb didn't just,
[34:37] you know, come and say, "Fellas, I
[34:39] really think we can do this. Come on."
[34:41] Rah rah rah. Caleb just said, "Let us go
[34:43] up at once
[34:45] &gt;&gt; immediately. This conversation needs to
[34:48] stop right now. Let's go." God gave it
[34:50] to us. We've already seen it. We know we
[34:52] can take it. I mean, listen, we couldn't
[34:54] get ourselves out of Egypt. God got us
[34:56] out. So, why would we think we couldn't
[34:58] get ourselves in the promised land? God
[35:00] can get us in. See? So I'm I'm here to
[35:03] tell you something friends. Nothing that
[35:04] you face from the cradle to the grave.
[35:07] I'm here to tell you God has the
[35:09] solution. God has a plan. It's a
[35:11] meticulous plan and it involves you.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; See, and so but we we here is here's the
[35:19] rub to that is it's that it's that can
[35:22] we get past our own human frailty? Can
[35:25] we believe tonight that I am
[35:28] predestinated before the foundation of
[35:31] the world? Can I accept that I am
[35:33] predestinated not to fall? I understand
[35:36] I got all kinds of failures. But can I
[35:39] believe what the word has said about me
[35:41] and what God has already prophesied
[35:44] would happen.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; Now you say, "Well, absolutely. Anybody
[35:48] should be able to do that." Well, here
[35:50] was two and a half million people and
[35:53] only two people thought they could.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; Even though God had brought them out of
[35:59] Egypt. Impossible.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; They had been trying to get out of there
[36:03] for 430 years.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Finally, they get out under a mighty
[36:07] hand. They pass through the Red Sea. God
[36:11] and and you know, and they're they're
[36:13] running up down the bank shouting and
[36:15] jumping and playing a tambourine. And
[36:17] suddenly everything is going along.
[36:19] They're everything's uh exactly moving
[36:22] at God's exact pace. And suddenly they
[36:25] get to something that took them by
[36:27] surprise. They weren't expecting to see
[36:29] giant. They didn't expect to feel like
[36:31] grasshoppers
[36:33] &gt;&gt; in the sight of these people. They were
[36:35] looking in the word. They knew it was a
[36:37] land flowing with milk and honey. And
[36:39] God actually proved it to them.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; He actually let them go in and they came
[36:45] back and they said, "It is exactly what
[36:48] God said it would be." Only God didn't
[36:50] tell us about the giants. I'm here to
[36:53] tell you something, friends. I get a big
[36:54] description about what the millennium
[36:57] will be and I and I get I get in the
[36:59] Bible that you there will be perilous
[37:02] times. We of course we know that. I get
[37:04] in the Bible that that we're coming to a
[37:06] time like has never been. But we're
[37:08] constantly running into things that we
[37:10] did not expect to run into. And my
[37:13] question is to you tonight, are you
[37:14] still willing to press? Are you still
[37:16] willing to believe what God has said
[37:18] about you
[37:20] &gt;&gt; and your part in the inheritance?
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:26] The future drama. We touched on this
[37:28] one. From the junction of time, we're
[37:30] going into the millennium. You believe
[37:32] that?
[37:35] &gt;&gt; It's a prophet.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; We're going into the millennium.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Time will cease at this junction. That
[37:45] junction where this world's 6,000year
[37:49] run in a fallen condition expires. I
[37:52] want you to understand that the earth
[37:55] has an expiration date.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; The earth always had a shelf life. Once
[38:02] sin started, it was only going to go so
[38:04] long. And God was going to use these
[38:07] dramas to bring about redemption. This
[38:10] is all about God redeeming his family.
[38:13] And he's never failed to redeem it. It's
[38:15] incredible that we would imagine that
[38:17] somehow right here at the finish line,
[38:19] he got us all the way to here over 2,000
[38:22] years and he kept the church going and
[38:24] somehow we won't make it. I'm here to
[38:25] tell you we will make it. I say tonight,
[38:27] let us go up at once and take the land.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are more ca Caleb said we
[38:33] are more than able
[38:36] &gt;&gt; to do it.
[38:38] And so he says here, "Eternity will
[38:43] begin for us and never no more." Now, we
[38:47] realize the earth in the millennium is
[38:48] still living out its seventh day, that
[38:50] seventh day, that last 1,000 years that
[38:54] that Adam and they fell before that that
[38:56] day could be lived out. And so, we're
[38:59] going to go back and get a restored
[39:00] Eden. And that's what the millennium
[39:02] will be. And that's going to be really
[39:04] big and loom large here in just a few
[39:06] minutes. So now that's our future. So
[39:09] we've looked at a garden drama, how it
[39:11] all got started.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; We looked at what Paul said were our
[39:16] examples at Kades Barnea and Paul said
[39:19] we're supposed to learn from that.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; We're not The whole reason that story is
[39:24] in the Bible is so you don't repeat it.
[39:27] So we don't get here right at the
[39:28] crossing overtime and somehow doubt that
[39:31] God can get me there.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; I'm not doubting it. I'm going to go up
[39:34] at once because God said I could do it.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; And we then we're given a future promise
[39:41] of a millennium coming. And I live for
[39:43] it. I look for it every day. Oh, I I I
[39:46] want I just say, "Oh, for the
[39:48] millennium."
[39:50] &gt;&gt; But at the same time, you've often heard
[39:54] me say, "I don't want a shortcut."
[39:58] &gt;&gt; I want to finish my course. I want to
[40:01] finish my course. I'm not looking for a
[40:03] shortcut. I'd like to be there
[40:05] yesterday, but if I still need to be
[40:07] here tomorrow and next week and next
[40:09] month, then I'll say I'm going to stay
[40:11] here and I'm going to fight. And when I
[40:12] cross the line, I'll still be busting
[40:14] devils in the head and running full
[40:17] steam.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; I tell you, you know, couple of weeks
[40:23] ago, you know, brother Matt and I, he
[40:26] and I love how concerned he stays over
[40:28] me. He's worries over me almost more
[40:30] than his mama. and he was with he wanted
[40:33] to go with me to see the cardiologist.
[40:34] No, Dad, I'm going. I'm You don't Oh,
[40:36] I'm going. Okay, you're going. So, we're
[40:38] meeting there. And uh when I got done
[40:41] with all my questions and I and the
[40:43] doctor was pretty well spent at that
[40:44] point because he walks in the office, he
[40:46] goes, "Why are you here? I just checked
[40:49] you out of the hospital. You're fine. Go
[40:50] home." And I said, "Well, I had I had
[40:53] some questions I want to ask you." Okay,
[40:54] ask. You know, um you know what exactly
[40:57] happened? Nothing.
[41:00] Well, I had some kind of distress. Yeah,
[41:02] it was nothing. Don't worry about it.
[41:04] You're fine. I said, so
[41:07] what what about, you know, I'm I'm
[41:09] thinking, do I need to scale back on my
[41:11] preaching? Do I need to worry about
[41:12] exercise? He says, I'm putting no
[41:14] restrictions on you.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; You have need of no restrictions. And so
[41:18] I, you know, I come around and in a long
[41:20] circle back around, I managed to ask him
[41:22] that again. And he said, and this time
[41:24] he wouldn't even let me finish. I said,
[41:26] "Well, what about?" He said, "I have no
[41:28] restrictions on you."
[41:30] &gt;&gt; So, tonight, friends, I'm free.
[41:34] And when I got done, then Matt pulls out
[41:36] his list. Well, I've got some some more
[41:38] questions.
[41:40] And I seen my poor doctor breathe a
[41:42] sigh. Okay. And then he Matt rattled off
[41:45] his four or five or 30 questions. I
[41:47] don't remember how many it was. And he
[41:49] just said, "Well, I've already answered
[41:51] that. I've already answered that. I've
[41:52] already answered that." And by the
[41:53] before Matt could even finish, he was
[41:55] standing up, walking. I think he was
[41:56] just going to walk out on us, wasn't he,
[41:57] son? He was like, "Goodbye. I've got
[41:59] other patients that actually need my
[42:01] help today."
[42:03] So, I'm happy to report to you tonight.
[42:05] I'm ready to go take it at once.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to go take it at once. I'm I'm
[42:10] not interested in in in taking a
[42:13] shortcut. I want to see the bride of
[42:15] Christ attain obtain every ounce of
[42:18] victory that is promised to her.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; And I want it for myself. And I want it
[42:22] for you. I want it for your families. I
[42:25] want it for your children.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Do you fault me for wanting it for your
[42:28] children?
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to see us all make it home.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; So, we've got a future drama coming. I
[42:41] hope you're living for it. But not so
[42:43] much that you're not living for the here
[42:45] and now because we also got a present
[42:47] drama of our day unfolding now.
[42:51] That means it's happening in real time.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "What's the
[42:56] matter?" This is the last year before
[42:58] judgment set in on the nation. This is
[43:01] this is Cub Scout days. What's the
[43:04] matter? What makes people so nervous?
[43:07] Why is it even psychiatrists are coming
[43:09] to be prayed for? You remember we read
[43:11] this Sunday. I think I read over it. I
[43:13] don't I didn't use any I didn't put any
[43:15] slides up. Why is it that the world is
[43:17] in a nervous age, a neurotic age?
[43:21] Now he says in three kinds of believers
[43:24] that's a genuine believer when the Holy
[43:26] Spirit not some persuaded by some other
[43:30] person not by some other thing. It
[43:32] doesn't take very long to to for the for
[43:36] the word to find you out whether or not
[43:38] you've just been persuaded into this
[43:41] truth or whether it's actually been
[43:42] revealed to you. Amen.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; See, not by some other thing, but when
[43:47] the Holy Spirit has revealed to you the
[43:51] word itself and you see the word made
[43:54] plain, vindicated, then the spirit of
[43:57] God come and get into that age for the
[43:59] word for that age and make it
[44:02] manifested. And that is what I
[44:04] underscored on Sunday. The whole point
[44:07] is to make it manifested. It's it's the
[44:11] devil doesn't care that you can quote
[44:13] it.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; He's not worried, you know. He will
[44:16] he'll let you go to church. He'll let
[44:18] you call yourself a believer. It's the
[44:20] life. He doesn't care how religious you
[44:22] are. And he's not afraid of how right
[44:25] and correct you are in your doctrine.
[44:27] Because brother Brandham said he has a
[44:29] secret. What he has a great military
[44:31] secret that what he knows is is even if
[44:33] you are religious even very religious
[44:36] and have and understand all the
[44:37] mysteries but if you miss that life you
[44:40] won't come up in the resurrection
[44:42] anyhow.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; And so he wins by default unless you
[44:47] push on to the Holy Ghost.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost is something worth
[44:52] pursuing.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you he be not far
[44:55] from any of us. It's not hard to get.
[44:58] All All it requires is a full a full
[45:02] unequivocal, unconditional, no holds
[45:05] barred, nothing held back, a complete
[45:08] surrender and repentance and faith in
[45:10] God and the Holy Ghost is promised to
[45:12] you.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; People don't get it sometimes because
[45:16] they repent 99.99%.
[45:21] And the devil only needs an
[45:22] infantismally small part to get a tow
[45:25] hold on and rebuild his castle right
[45:27] back inside you again.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; It might take him a month or a year or
[45:32] five years, but he'll get that thing
[45:33] rebuilt. And you'll say, "Man, what
[45:35] happened to those days when I love the
[45:37] Lord and my prayer life was on I was on
[45:39] fire for God?" Oh, I'm here to tell you
[45:41] something, friends. That can listen,
[45:42] that can even happen to people who are
[45:45] born again of the spirit. What chance do
[45:46] you have if you've never come all the
[45:48] way in Christ? See, no wonder the the
[45:51] gospel seems difficult and hard. It's
[45:54] not supposed to be. As we read Sunday,
[45:56] Jesus said, "My yoke is easy. My burden
[45:58] is light." See, of course, it would be
[46:01] light. Listen, friends, if I have to
[46:04] lift this pull pit and move it over
[46:06] there, do you know how do you know how a
[46:09] captain gets a flag pole moved in the
[46:12] military?
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Exactly, Mo. He says, "Private, move
[46:17] that flag pole.
[46:19] That's how he does it. And if I need to
[46:22] get this pull pit moved, I got people.
[46:24] Do you think I'll struggle moving it?
[46:27] I'll get it moved. I'll move it. But I
[46:30] won't struggle doing it cuz I'll say,
[46:32] "Brother Luther, come up here. Brother
[46:33] Matt, come over here. Get in. Get up
[46:35] here. Get up here and get this thing
[46:36] moved for me." And and and I'll walk
[46:39] right behind him like as if I'm
[46:40] involved. Okay. Right over here. Right
[46:41] over here. And set it down right there.
[46:43] And let me make sure my toes are out of
[46:44] the way. And I won't break a sweat. I'm
[46:47] here to tell you. He says, "My my yoke
[46:49] is easy. My burden is light." Cuz I'll
[46:51] do all the work. I'll do all the
[46:53] lifting. I just need your whole heart
[46:55] and mind completely committed to my
[46:58] word.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; The Christian life is not hard.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; It's not. It's the grievous part to a
[47:04] Christian is when we don't do that and
[47:06] then we stumble and we fail. That's
[47:08] where that's where we really find
[47:11] ourselves in in despair.
[47:14] So he goes on, it's manifested and then
[47:17] we're at the closing of the history of
[47:20] the world. The book is now being
[47:22] finished. The last line will be wrote
[47:24] across it someday. Hear a prophet. Hear
[47:26] him. Hear him. Don't miss this.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; The last line will be wrote across it
[47:34] someday. It has a shelf life.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. the the the earth in its current
[47:40] condition, the kingdoms of this world
[47:43] are to become the kingdoms of our Lord
[47:46] and his Christ.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; So, Satan's Eden has an expiration date
[47:52] known to God.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; And I don't want to be here when it
[47:55] expires, friends. Not not at least not
[47:57] on that side of it. I want to make sure
[47:59] that I rode out of heaven with Christ in
[48:01] Revelation 19 and his name is the word
[48:04] of God. And that's good for me because
[48:06] I'm also a part of the word of God.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:10] So he says it'll ride across it someday
[48:13] and she'll be closed up. And there is a
[48:17] great drama. See, he keeps going back to
[48:19] this. Brother Brandham says in one place
[48:21] and I think it's in shalom to God. It's
[48:24] all of it's all a drama. All of
[48:25] redemption is a drama being played out.
[48:28] And he says, "And there is a great drama
[48:31] being set and angels are standing over
[48:33] the skies watching." You know what a
[48:36] drama is? The actors are ready. You can
[48:38] see them acting. But you can also see
[48:41] the raptured church making herself
[48:44] ready. It's a great scene. You can see
[48:46] the presence of God vindicating,
[48:49] vindicating, vindicating, and making the
[48:53] great drama that's foretold here in this
[48:55] Bible to act itself out. Oh, I I love
[48:59] that last line. What a time to live.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; What a time to live. Don't let that be
[49:06] lost on you. You're you're coming to the
[49:08] time where the future drama is ready to
[49:11] unfold. You're coming to a time where
[49:13] the last line of code is being written
[49:17] for this age. And after that, once that
[49:20] expires, the program's done and the
[49:22] whole thing gets deleted and a new world
[49:24] begins. Oh, what a time to live. What a
[49:28] time to be alive. Oh, do you feel that
[49:30] down inside your heart tonight, friends?
[49:33] &gt;&gt; What a time to live.
[49:36] So when we come then and we pick up our
[49:40] text tonight because what they heard him
[49:43] in the eth verse and they heard the
[49:46] voice of the Lord God walking in the
[49:48] garden. I want you just to pay real
[49:50] close attention because I want to make
[49:52] some some real uh incredible statements
[49:54] that have been incredible to me and I
[49:57] would not by any means make them nor
[50:00] would I be able to make them nor would I
[50:02] have any valid or vindication or
[50:03] validation. They would be
[50:05] unsubstantiated if I if it weren't for
[50:07] the fact that I'm only going to be
[50:09] saying what a prophet said.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; The voice of the Lord God walking in the
[50:15] in the garden in the cool of the day and
[50:17] Adam and his wife hid themselves among
[50:19] the uh from the presence of God amongst
[50:22] the trees of the garden. So the Bible
[50:25] describes here a time in this in this
[50:29] part of the early early part of the
[50:31] drama. The Bible is describing a time
[50:34] when Adam experienced God's presence in
[50:38] a very personal way.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; And then sadly, we go on down to the
[50:45] ninth and 10th and 11th verse and
[50:48] suddenly there's a problem. Adam, it
[50:50] it's not like it's been before. God
[50:53] would come down in the cool of the day.
[50:56] And that and even in the Hebrew that
[50:58] word the cool of the day uh literally
[51:01] means it's sometimes even translated as
[51:03] an evening breeze or a gentle wind. You
[51:06] know you know that time in the evening
[51:08] when sometimes and especially in the
[51:10] fall when we have our beautiful
[51:12] millennial weather and it's it's perfect
[51:14] outside and there's no humidity and bugs
[51:16] and you can just walk out in the evening
[51:17] and there's that nice evening breeze
[51:20] &gt;&gt; moving through the air and you just feel
[51:22] like oh my what what a wonderful time.
[51:25] how good it is to be here. I just enjoy
[51:27] this so much. And that's when you can
[51:29] really enjoy nature. All the stifling
[51:30] heat and humidity of summer is gone. And
[51:33] and that and so that's what it means.
[51:35] And friends, that's that's that's what
[51:38] that's what the millennium holds for
[51:40] you. Do you understand that? every every
[51:42] minute of every hour of every day for a
[51:45] thousand years is going to be a
[51:46] wonderful breeze. And you're going to
[51:48] sit back and enjoy the beauty of a
[51:51] millennial world.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Unencumbered by sin, unencumbered,
[51:56] unpolluted,
[51:57] &gt;&gt; uncontaminated.
[51:59] No more people cursing. No more
[52:01] half-dress. No more beer bottles. No
[52:03] more nothing. No more traffic. No more
[52:05] horns. No more sirens.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[52:10] And so, so we we see that this was a a a
[52:15] time where God would on purpose at the
[52:18] end of a day would come down and they
[52:20] would have like a a little evening
[52:22] devotional time. And it's something
[52:25] that's always good to have before you go
[52:27] to sleep. I want to tell you something.
[52:29] You really you really should practice.
[52:31] Let me let me tell you. Uh it's a it's a
[52:34] great practice uh to go to sleep talking
[52:36] to the Lord and wake up talking to the
[52:39] Lord. I can tell you from years of doing
[52:41] it, there's nothing like it. There's
[52:43] nothing like shutting my eyes and the
[52:45] last thing I remember, I was talking to
[52:48] the Lord and I'm waking up the next
[52:49] morning and I just pick up the
[52:51] conversation again.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's nothing like being a
[52:54] Christian. Like brother Bam said, if I
[52:56] couldn't be a Christian, I just don't
[52:57] even know what I would do.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful life.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; And so we find that there's an
[53:06] interruption now. Something's not the
[53:09] same as as it had been day after day,
[53:12] year after year, for however many
[53:14] hundreds of years into that seventh day,
[53:16] they were able to uh enjoy. Uh but at
[53:20] some point, we find verse nine and now
[53:23] God, they're not where they're supposed
[53:24] to be.
[53:26] And God says, "Where art thou?" See, so
[53:29] it's not he can't find them. It's that
[53:32] hey, for every evening at this time, you
[53:36] come to church. Why are you not here
[53:38] anymore?
[53:40] &gt;&gt; You knew that I would be coming. It's
[53:42] church time. Adam, where are you?
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, I I'd say tonight add to the Adams
[53:48] that should be here and aren't here.
[53:50] Adam, where are you?
[53:52] &gt;&gt; See,
[53:52] &gt;&gt; the presence of God is here. And Adam
[53:56] says, you know, he I heard the voice in
[53:58] the garden. I was afraid. It goes on
[54:00] down because I was naked. Who told you
[54:03] you were naked? Have you eaten of the
[54:05] tree? Where have I commanded thee that
[54:07] thou shouldest not eat? This is a
[54:08] federal case. This was serious business.
[54:12] This was going to break the world if
[54:14] true.
[54:16] This wasn't a light thing. God said,
[54:19] "Surely,
[54:20] surely you haven't done the
[54:23] worldbreaking thing."
[54:25] Adam, where are you at? What has
[54:28] happened? How did you let yourself get
[54:31] into this situation? I put the world
[54:34] under your care and you're about to hand
[54:36] the book of life over to the devil.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Fortunately, Satan's greedy hands
[54:42] couldn't hold it and it went back to
[54:43] God. I'm so glad cuz my name was in that
[54:46] book and I needed it back in God's
[54:48] hands, not the devil's hands.
[54:51] So, these verses, especially, you know,
[54:55] verse eight, they show that God was
[54:59] literally present in the Garden of Eden.
[55:02] Now, of course, we have to weigh that
[55:04] against the the scripture because and
[55:06] and and I don't have all the answers. I
[55:08] can tell you and Brother Brandham didn't
[55:09] give us all the answers and and and
[55:11] there's lots of parts about the
[55:13] millennium we don't even understand to
[55:14] say nothing of the new heavens and the
[55:16] new earth. I don't I can't fully explain
[55:18] to you even what that means that in the
[55:21] new heavens and the new earth in the
[55:22] last chapter of the book of revelation
[55:24] finally for the first time in the whole
[55:26] Bible and it says and God himself shall
[55:29] dwell with man
[55:30] &gt;&gt; and that's never been said until after
[55:32] the millennium and we go into a new
[55:34] heavens and a new earth and God himself
[55:36] shall dwell here is a here is God
[55:40] visibly talking interacting and you're
[55:43] going to see it's astonishingly personal
[55:46] and even physical contact is had
[55:49] according to a prophet describing it.
[55:51] So, but yet I've got the Bible saying no
[55:53] man hath seen God at any time. So, so we
[55:56] realize that God, Brother Brandham
[55:58] taught us and this is where a prophet
[55:59] comes in. He said he took a form
[56:02] something that could be seen. Yes.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; See,
[56:06] &gt;&gt; so he has appeared in theophonic
[56:08] appearance and and all down through the
[56:10] ages and sometimes he was in a
[56:13] theophony, sometimes he was actually in
[56:15] a human body that he built for a
[56:17] temporary like when he met Melzdc there
[56:20] um um in Genesis 18.
[56:23] So, so we find then that that verse 8 is
[56:26] literally showing that there's a literal
[56:28] presence of God in the garden walking
[56:31] and interacting with Adam and and Eve
[56:35] and in the cool of the day. And it was,
[56:38] as I've said already, I'll say it again.
[56:41] It was a very direct, very, you couldn't
[56:44] get more direct. And I'm going to read
[56:45] you the quote here in a minute. Just
[56:47] hang on. It was a very direct. It was
[56:51] exceptionally intimate relationship and
[56:55] it was astonishingly
[56:57] literal and actually physical as brother
[57:01] Brennham will describe.
[57:05] Now, the beauty of this, even if I can't
[57:09] explain every jot and tit to you, just
[57:13] take this home with you that this this
[57:16] is the level, whatever you whatever this
[57:19] was, this is the level it will be in a
[57:22] restored earth when God brings Eden back
[57:25] to the earth again in a millennium.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the whole purpose in the
[57:31] millennial world to come where Jesus
[57:34] dwells in the in the flesh glorified and
[57:38] moving among among his family who are
[57:41] also in glorified bodies.
[57:46] But after we find in that after verses
[57:49] 9, 10 and 11 and sin enters the world,
[57:54] then that level of fellowship and that
[57:57] contact was broken and Adam and Eve hid
[58:01] themselves because of their shame.
[58:06] Brother Brandham says here in what does
[58:09] it take to make a Christian life?
[58:12] January 1957.
[58:16] He's describing this scene that we're
[58:19] reading
[58:20] prior to the fall.
[58:23] He's re he's going to describe to you
[58:25] and only a prophet could do this. Look,
[58:28] I figure if Ezekiel can go up there and
[58:30] see all that he saw and wrote about it,
[58:31] and I believe it, and I can see that
[58:33] Moses went up there and saw a
[58:35] tabernacle, and God said, "Make sure you
[58:36] build that one like the one you saw in
[58:38] heaven." Amen. If John can write that he
[58:40] went into the throne room of God, I
[58:42] believe John.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; I believe Moses. I believe, you know
[58:45] why? Because I believe vindicated
[58:47] prophets.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham says, "I can hear."
[58:53] Now, this is their church service. This
[58:55] is the evening time when God would come
[58:57] down for however many hundreds of years,
[59:00] the unbroken years, however many there
[59:03] were. In that first part of that seventh
[59:05] day,
[59:07] I can hear the loving voice of the
[59:09] father say, "Now, we're going to break
[59:10] in on the church service. You ready?"
[59:12] They're they're they're having a little
[59:14] evening devotional right before bed. All
[59:17] right.
[59:18] I can hear the loving voice of the
[59:21] father say, "Children,
[59:23] have you enjoyed yourself today? Papa
[59:27] has come down to kiss you good night and
[59:30] lay you down for the night and a kiss
[59:32] upon the cheek of Adam and a kiss upon
[59:34] the cheek of Eve. And as he lays his big
[59:38] arm out and she lays her head, little
[59:40] dainty head upon his arm as a pillow,
[59:42] they went to sleep and perfect. Nothing
[59:46] can bother them. Few months later, why
[59:49] some people can't keep the victory. I
[59:51] think it's incredible that he's using
[59:54] this to describe in the sermons what
[59:56] does it take to live a Christian life
[59:58] and why some people can't keep the
[59:59] victory. Maybe you need this kind of
[1:00:01] relationship like Adam had. And I'm here
[1:00:04] to tell you in Christ that's restored.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; And when God looked upon Adam, brother
[1:00:12] Brandham uses the analogy. He said
[1:00:13] sometimes my wife and I will go into the
[1:00:16] room at night and little Joseph, I think
[1:00:18] he's about nine years old. Well, let's
[1:00:19] see here. would have been even younger
[1:00:21] than that, maybe six years old, five or
[1:00:23] six years old. Actually, probably four
[1:00:25] years old. And and brother Brandham said
[1:00:28] they would go in there and and pray with
[1:00:30] him and kiss him good night and tuck him
[1:00:32] in. And he said me and mother would
[1:00:34] stand back many times and say, "Oh,
[1:00:35] isn't he adorable? Isn't he beautiful?
[1:00:37] He looks like you, Billy. He looks like
[1:00:38] this one. Looks like this one." And
[1:00:41] brother Brandon moves from there. He
[1:00:42] says, "And when God looked upon Adam and
[1:00:45] Eve and seen it was, they resembled him,
[1:00:49] for they was made in his image, how he
[1:00:52] kissed them, and how his great heart
[1:00:55] must have felt." Here's a dad looking
[1:00:57] down at his son who's in his image. And
[1:01:00] knowing how he feels, he said, "How much
[1:01:01] more God must have felt when he come
[1:01:04] down into the cool of the evening, and
[1:01:05] there was his son and his son's wife in
[1:01:08] church, right where they were supposed
[1:01:09] to be, worshiping the Lord. And you were
[1:01:12] to hear it. I I left off a lot of the
[1:01:14] description. Go back and and catch what
[1:01:16] does it take to make a Christian life
[1:01:18] and why some people can't keep the
[1:01:19] victory January and March of 57. And
[1:01:22] brother Brandham talks about that God
[1:01:24] would come down and they would they had
[1:01:26] a forest church and they would go to the
[1:01:29] altar and there they'd begin to commune
[1:01:31] and God would come. He said the thunder
[1:01:33] would clap and and the wind would blow
[1:01:35] and here he would come down through the
[1:01:36] woods and drop right down in among them.
[1:01:38] Why? because he's coming in to tuck them
[1:01:41] in for sleep. He's coming to kiss him on
[1:01:43] the cheek. This is a very personal God.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; This is how God wants your relationship
[1:01:49] to be with him. Make no mistake about
[1:01:51] it. This is what you're learning from
[1:01:53] Genesis.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; He's not impersonal. He's not a way off
[1:01:57] somewhere. He's not on a vacation. He's
[1:01:59] very present. He wants to be very
[1:02:02] present and very real and very literal
[1:02:04] in your life.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:08] I thought to myself today when I read
[1:02:10] this these quotes I thought what a
[1:02:13] different kind of conversation
[1:02:16] is found in Genesis 3 9-11. Adam, where
[1:02:21] art thou? What a different kind of a
[1:02:25] conversation from however many years it
[1:02:28] was into that seventh day that that
[1:02:30] before the fall. However many years that
[1:02:33] was or how many days we don't I don't
[1:02:34] know I don't know if brother Brandham
[1:02:36] ever said and I I don't know of a
[1:02:38] scripture that that identifies it just
[1:02:40] somewhere in that seventh day. I know
[1:02:41] they didn't get to finish it out but
[1:02:44] what a difference it was.
[1:02:47] Listen friends,
[1:02:50] God made a way to get Adam and Eve back.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; There was a time when you made in his
[1:02:58] image were a part of God and you had
[1:03:01] fellowship with the father. Brother
[1:03:02] Brandham said, "You don't remember it
[1:03:03] because there's a veil over your
[1:03:05] memory." And then son, then one day we
[1:03:07] were born here in the earth and we were
[1:03:09] cut off from God, but God got us back.
[1:03:12] God came back and pulled you back into a
[1:03:15] relationship with him again.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, but but I don't I don't
[1:03:21] have that physical contact." You're
[1:03:23] mistaken.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; You are the physical contact. It's the
[1:03:28] Holy Ghost living inside you. You're He
[1:03:30] has no hands but your hands.
[1:03:34] This is the beauty of Christianity in a
[1:03:36] lost world that God like in Genesis is
[1:03:41] giving sinful people the opportunity to
[1:03:44] contact God.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; To literally come and and respect you
[1:03:50] and believe you and have faith in you
[1:03:53] and for no other reason and based on no
[1:03:56] other contingency receive eternal life
[1:03:58] for it.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't underestimate
[1:04:03] what God has in in plans for daily
[1:04:07] usage. You say, "I'm a nobody. God can
[1:04:09] never use me." You are so wrong. You
[1:04:11] couldn't be more wrong than that. See,
[1:04:15] so how sin
[1:04:18] had changed that perfect setting in
[1:04:20] Eden, that perfect life, that that
[1:04:24] perfect product of the word. And brother
[1:04:27] Brandham teaches us that as long as the
[1:04:30] as long as the word was followed, it
[1:04:34] would have remained perfect forever. And
[1:04:37] and so that's what I was saying earlier.
[1:04:40] I don't want it to be lost on us tonight
[1:04:42] that this time of of perfection that a
[1:04:45] prophet is describing because you don't
[1:04:47] you don't get so much of that detail. It
[1:04:49] took a prophet in this day to give you
[1:04:51] detail that Moses didn't include. and
[1:04:53] and and this this perfection that they
[1:04:56] had is literally a reflection of how
[1:04:59] close God desires. Brother Brandon
[1:05:02] wasn't giving us those details to give
[1:05:04] us more theology. He was pointing to the
[1:05:07] fact that this is how God wants to have
[1:05:09] a relationship with me and you.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; That's why he's willing to come to you
[1:05:16] in the morning if you'll meet him.
[1:05:18] That's why he's willing. If you're in a
[1:05:20] crisis in the day, you can step aside
[1:05:22] and say, "Father," and he's so quickly
[1:05:24] ready to help you. That's why at night
[1:05:27] you can go to sleep talking to him, wake
[1:05:29] up talking to him. He's a real person.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; And I get it, friends. We're sometimes
[1:05:40] we have doubts of our own our own
[1:05:43] position. and you're we we get like
[1:05:46] Sister Georgie Bruce and I you're going
[1:05:48] to love me uh referring to you as Sister
[1:05:53] Georgie Bruce. And the reason you're
[1:05:55] going to love it is because she was uh
[1:05:59] she was a real Christian lady. And
[1:06:00] Brother Brandham testifies to that on
[1:06:02] tape. A very godly sister, a real
[1:06:05] Christian, full of the Holy Spirit. And
[1:06:07] Brother Brandham told her, he says,
[1:06:09] "Sister Georgie," because she's back
[1:06:10] there at an interview. But brother
[1:06:12] Brandham, I just I I don't know if I'll
[1:06:14] make it. I I want the Holy Ghost. And
[1:06:16] Brother Brandham is trying to let her
[1:06:17] know. Sister, you've been a Christian
[1:06:19] for years. You've long ago had an
[1:06:21] experience. What are you so worried
[1:06:23] about? And just keeps talking to her.
[1:06:24] And he keeps letting her talk and he
[1:06:26] keeps talking and she keeps talking and
[1:06:28] and he he's trying to he's trying to
[1:06:30] position her in the word of God. But
[1:06:32] sister, he you're a great sister. I've
[1:06:34] known you. I've watched your life. I've
[1:06:36] watched your life for years. I've never
[1:06:38] known you to be anything other than a
[1:06:40] gallant Christian sister. And you know
[1:06:41] what she did? She came back with what we
[1:06:44] often come back to God with. But I but
[1:06:46] brother Brandham, I make so many
[1:06:49] mistakes.
[1:06:52] Can I give you a prophet's response to
[1:06:54] her?
[1:06:55] That's why Jesus had to die.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he didn't give a a
[1:07:02] theological exit Jesus. He didn't write
[1:07:04] an essay. He didn't he didn't pull out
[1:07:06] the Greek and the Hebrew. He said,
[1:07:08] "Sister, but Brother Brandham, I make so
[1:07:10] many mistakes. I just want to say, Lord,
[1:07:12] but I make so many mistakes. How do you
[1:07:14] keep loving me? That's why I had to die,
[1:07:17] son. Because I saw you and I'm not going
[1:07:19] to lose you and I love you." I'm going
[1:07:21] to here to tell you tonight, you bring
[1:07:22] your so many mistakes to the Lord. And
[1:07:25] he'll forgive you for every last one of
[1:07:27] them tonight.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; If we confess our sin, he's faithful and
[1:07:31] just to forgive us. that you remember I
[1:07:33] I was at you remember years ago, many of
[1:07:36] you probably wouldn't remember it. We
[1:07:38] played the video testimony of brother
[1:07:39] Dawson Riley and he was the the the lion
[1:07:43] hunter that took brother Brandham on
[1:07:44] lion hunts and they would lay out in the
[1:07:46] wilderness and and and and he gave a
[1:07:48] testimony how that one time he he he he
[1:07:51] got tangled up and I think it involved a
[1:07:54] you know some bad situation with some
[1:07:56] illicit uh woman and and it just it just
[1:08:00] he was so destroyed over it. He he
[1:08:02] couldn't believe that he had let
[1:08:04] himself, you know, and not not talking
[1:08:06] about adultery. Wasn't a married man.
[1:08:07] Not talking about that. But but he had
[1:08:09] he had he had been where he shouldn't
[1:08:11] have been and was involved in things he
[1:08:12] shouldn't have been. And and he just
[1:08:14] felt so bad cuz now he's got to be with
[1:08:16] brother Brandham. And he said, you know,
[1:08:17] you can't hide things from a prophet.
[1:08:19] And he said all day long, he said, I I
[1:08:21] tried to hide it. I tried to keep it
[1:08:23] down. He said, but but he said, it just
[1:08:24] got me. And he said, finally, he said,
[1:08:27] brother Brandon begin to talk about it.
[1:08:28] He said, I knew he knew what was
[1:08:30] happening. And he said, "We stopped the
[1:08:32] car and he said,"I just had to get out.
[1:08:34] I couldn't sit there in the presence of
[1:08:36] that prophet knowing he could see my
[1:08:37] whole life." And he said, "I got out and
[1:08:39] I walked back and I sat down on the
[1:08:40] guardrail, I believe it was." And he
[1:08:42] said, "Brother Brandom, come walking
[1:08:44] back there just like I would or you
[1:08:46] would." I'm glad God sent us just a real
[1:08:48] man.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; He just sent us a real man. He wasn't
[1:08:51] some great king. He wasn't some monarch.
[1:08:54] He was just a sassifrass homegrown
[1:08:56] hillbilly. and he just walks back there
[1:08:59] with with such authority and he says,
[1:09:01] "Brother Dawson, Satan set a trap for
[1:09:04] you and you fell for it." Now, you would
[1:09:07] think, "Oh my goodness, then I'm doomed
[1:09:09] for sure." His very next words,
[1:09:11] according to Brother Riley, God will
[1:09:13] forgive you if you'll ask him. Oh, he
[1:09:16] said, "Ask him. Oh Lord, will you
[1:09:18] forgive me?" And he said, "At that
[1:09:19] moment, God forgave me and I was
[1:09:22] completely restored." I'm here to tell
[1:09:24] you, I got so many mistakes. You got so
[1:09:26] many mistakes. Bring your so many
[1:09:28] mistakes to the King of Kings. He wants
[1:09:31] you to come to him.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Don't go the opposite direction. Come
[1:09:37] toward him.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; That's what the Israel did when he came
[1:09:42] down on the mountain and they retreated
[1:09:44] back and Moses ran to him. Said, "Don't
[1:09:46] back up. Go forward. He He wants to talk
[1:09:49] to you. No, we're too sinful. He's too
[1:09:52] scary. No, you've got him all wrong. He
[1:09:54] wants to be a father to you. He's got a
[1:09:56] He got a promised land. He loves you.
[1:09:59] You're you're you're his family. And
[1:10:02] somehow they had a hard time believing
[1:10:04] that. Oh, don't you have a hard time
[1:10:06] believing that tonight, friends? The
[1:10:08] whole reason you're able to comprehend
[1:10:10] the love of God is because you're part
[1:10:13] of God's family.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:10:19] Once we start to believe
[1:10:23] the eternal truth that is
[1:10:27] it is it is unviable. It cannot be
[1:10:30] violated. It cannot be altered. It
[1:10:32] cannot be changed when you tonight can
[1:10:35] accept the eternal word that God knew
[1:10:38] you before the foundation of the world
[1:10:40] and will not lose you. Full stop.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Full stop.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Come on. Don't Don't let the devil add
[1:10:48] an addendum to that. Don't let you don't
[1:10:50] let your own weary mind add an addendum
[1:10:53] to that. He knew me before the
[1:10:54] foundation of the world. He sent Jesus
[1:10:57] to die. The blood speaks for me. Brother
[1:10:59] Brandham said, "How can he see me? How
[1:11:01] can I be guilty a sinner when he can't
[1:11:04] even see my sin?"
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; This is the drama.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; This is part of the redemption drama.
[1:11:13] You're part of the redemption drama.
[1:11:16] Amen.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Oh my. This isn't just Bible stories.
[1:11:20] You're writing a second book of Acts.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; And that's not just the second book of
[1:11:25] Acts. The book of Acts isn't just about
[1:11:27] miracles. The book of Acts is about
[1:11:29] sinners repenting.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; The book of Acts is people who didn't
[1:11:32] have the Holy Ghost came to Christ and
[1:11:34] got the Holy Ghost. This last day church
[1:11:36] is writing an entire book of Acts behind
[1:11:39] it.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:43] So, I'm so glad he sees it like that. I
[1:11:46] I don't know what I would do. Brother
[1:11:47] Brandham says here, he says, "And God
[1:11:50] wanted us to be uh earthly creatures."
[1:11:54] This is from Shepherd of the Sheepfold,
[1:11:57] 1956. He said, "God wanted us to be
[1:12:00] earthly creatures." It was, you see,
[1:12:05] that's why there's a millennium.
[1:12:08] That's why you're going to be there
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; cuz God wanted you to be earthly
[1:12:13] creatures.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; He's got a heaven full of angels. He
[1:12:17] wanted sons and daughters to be earthly
[1:12:20] creatures.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham explains that. I I I
[1:12:23] just got a little bit of a snippet here,
[1:12:24] but if you go back and listen to that
[1:12:25] message, he explains it in detail. God
[1:12:28] wanted us to be earthly creatures.
[1:12:31] It was sin that made us die and go off
[1:12:34] this earth. See, when we die, we we
[1:12:36] leave the earth. God put us here to be
[1:12:38] here forever. You understand? That's
[1:12:41] what the millennium restores. That's
[1:12:42] what the new heavens and the new earth.
[1:12:44] God didn't you weren't you weren't
[1:12:46] created to die. That's that wasn't God's
[1:12:48] doing. That's sin doing that. See, it
[1:12:52] was sin that made us die and go off the
[1:12:54] earth. It's sin that brought old age and
[1:12:56] sickness on. But when all that's done
[1:13:00] away with, his creatures and his
[1:13:03] delegates of his great domain will be
[1:13:06] just like they was in the Garden of
[1:13:10] Eden,
[1:13:12] without sin, without death. He says in
[1:13:16] 1965, "Things that are to be, but we're
[1:13:20] going to a real place where we're going
[1:13:23] to do things. We're going to live. We're
[1:13:26] going to work. We're going to enjoy.
[1:13:28] We're going to live. We're going to life
[1:13:32] to real eternal life. We're going to a
[1:13:36] heaven, a paradise. Just like Adam and
[1:13:40] Eve worked and lived and eat and enjoyed
[1:13:42] in the Garden of Eden before sin came
[1:13:45] in. So based on that, I can say just
[1:13:48] like Adam and Eve worked and lived and
[1:13:50] enjoyed and worshiped and prayed and got
[1:13:53] kissed good night and had a personal
[1:13:55] relationship with Almighty God walking
[1:13:58] among them. That's what he's restoring
[1:14:00] back to us in Eden.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Just like Adam and Eve before sin came
[1:14:06] in, we're on our road back there again.
[1:14:09] There's your drama. We're on our road
[1:14:11] back there again. Right. Right back. Oh,
[1:14:14] I'm so glad, friends, he sent us a a
[1:14:16] perfect word to take us back to that
[1:14:18] perfect Eden. You're talking about an
[1:14:20] end of darkness. Think about that.
[1:14:22] You're here you are. You're coming up on
[1:14:24] the age and and and how we should be
[1:14:27] rejoice. You are the you the Bible says
[1:14:29] this is the generation upon whom the
[1:14:32] ends of the world will come. You're
[1:14:34] going to see the end of darkness. Oh, I
[1:14:36] want to see that. I want to see the end
[1:14:38] of darkness. I want to see myself in a
[1:14:40] new body. I want to see you in a new
[1:14:42] body. I want to see a new earth. Oh,
[1:14:44] hallelujah. The end of all darkness, the
[1:14:46] end of all thread, the end of all of
[1:14:48] that stuff.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, the second Eve. Think about it,
[1:14:53] friends. The second Eve now with a
[1:14:56] commission to bring Christ back,
[1:14:59] predestinated not to fall, ordained and
[1:15:02] chosen to believe every word of God. You
[1:15:06] see, you see, when you think about it
[1:15:08] that way, you realize that in the
[1:15:11] millennium, we we walk out upon the
[1:15:14] ashes of the wicked to rebuild the
[1:15:17] earth. And you say, "Hm, wonder what
[1:15:20] that's going to be like. I mean, we're
[1:15:22] going to rebuild the earth. Uh, so we're
[1:15:25] going to have tools and equipment or is
[1:15:27] it going to be spoken word? Is it are we
[1:15:29] going to wave our hands? Are we going to
[1:15:30] have magic wands? I mean, what how what
[1:15:33] do you mean we're going to rebuild the
[1:15:34] earth?" Well, can I just say to you
[1:15:36] today that the equipment has already
[1:15:38] been field tested with a prophet in the
[1:15:40] woods when he said, "Say where they'll
[1:15:42] be. You don't have to worry about
[1:15:44] rebuilding Eden." I'm here to tell you
[1:15:46] the power of the spoken word has already
[1:15:49] been identified among us. It's already
[1:15:51] been field tested. It's already passed
[1:15:53] the test. It creates things.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; It doesn't just renew. It doesn't just
[1:15:58] rebuild. It doesn't just restore. It
[1:16:00] takes nothing and turns it into
[1:16:03] something. Oh, I'm so glad for a perfect
[1:16:05] word that could take a nothing and turn
[1:16:08] me into something. Not not patch me up,
[1:16:10] but make me a new creation in Christ
[1:16:13] Jesus.
[1:16:15] This is exactly what brother Brandham
[1:16:17] was showing us because we already know
[1:16:19] it works. A a prophet has already showed
[1:16:22] it in operation. Brother Brandham says
[1:16:23] it like this and look away to Jesus. He
[1:16:26] says, "So now, oh, I got to I got to
[1:16:28] close. Let me close with this. So now
[1:16:30] I'm going to say something to you now
[1:16:32] that I haven't said all along. And this
[1:16:35] is 1963, December 1963. Look away to
[1:16:38] Jesus.
[1:16:41] And this is the thing that we have
[1:16:43] looked forward to for so long.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; He's talking about the third pull.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; And an element of the third pull of
[1:16:51] course is the open word. The element of
[1:16:53] the third pull is the power of the
[1:16:55] spoken word. The ele the third pull is a
[1:16:57] broad term. And I'm not here tonight to
[1:16:59] dissect it all down, but let just
[1:17:01] suffice to say that it's the it's the
[1:17:04] word in the mouth of the bride.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom describes that in the
[1:17:09] fourth seal. If you go there and he says
[1:17:12] like from God's mouth to Moses mouth
[1:17:15] said, Moses, you go out there. He said
[1:17:18] because God uses man and you call for
[1:17:20] this and you call for that. And he said
[1:17:22] it'll happen because it'll be the mouth
[1:17:24] of God
[1:17:26] speaking through the the mouth of Moses.
[1:17:29] See, so it's the power of the spoken
[1:17:32] word. Now watch.
[1:17:34] So he says this is the thing we have
[1:17:36] looked forward to for so long.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; And he says for at least many years,
[1:17:42] four or five years or maybe longer. And
[1:17:45] that's exactly right because brother
[1:17:47] Brandham in 1959 he's already tested it
[1:17:51] in the woods of Indiana and two weeks
[1:17:53] later testes it again in the woods of
[1:17:55] Kentucky and God just says say where
[1:17:58] they'll be and he says he'll be right
[1:17:59] there and there he was and then when he
[1:18:02] shoots one and can't find it and brother
[1:18:04] and God just says we'll just say where
[1:18:05] it'll be. Oh, I'm here to tell you
[1:18:07] something friends. Brother Brandham
[1:18:09] almost felt like he was losing his mind.
[1:18:12] I've preached on that before. He was, he
[1:18:14] thought he was going crazy. And the next
[1:18:16] thing you know, he's in the woods
[1:18:17] screaming out, "Where are you? What do
[1:18:18] you want?" And he said, "Usually I see
[1:18:21] that light. I hear a voice and I see a
[1:18:22] light. This time I just I'm hearing
[1:18:24] voices. Am I going crazy? Who are you?"
[1:18:27] And it was because God was not going to
[1:18:30] let him take that scripture. If you say
[1:18:33] to this mountain, "Be moved." And
[1:18:34] brother Brandon wouldn't preach on that.
[1:18:36] He said, "Because I did not understand
[1:18:38] how if I said because I thought
[1:18:41] everything had to be in the atonement,
[1:18:43] meaning that it would be Christ saying
[1:18:45] it. I couldn't say that. Everything had
[1:18:47] to be in the atonement." So, Brother
[1:18:48] Brandham said, "I just made up my mind
[1:18:51] that if somebody ever asked me, well,
[1:18:53] what about that?" He said, "I would just
[1:18:55] say, well, that was before Calvary, so
[1:18:57] that was before the atonement." Which
[1:18:59] was a perfectly good Baptist answer, but
[1:19:02] it's not one that God was going to let
[1:19:03] him get by with. And God takes him into
[1:19:05] the woods and almost drives him to the
[1:19:07] point of insanity to show him that God
[1:19:09] meant exactly what he said. If you say
[1:19:12] to this mountain and brother Brandham
[1:19:14] when he couldn't get it, oh, I'm so glad
[1:19:17] I I forgive me for saying it this way.
[1:19:19] I'm so glad brother Brandham couldn't
[1:19:21] get it.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he just had a hard time
[1:19:26] believing it.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Did I say that out loud?
[1:19:32] Go listen to it yourself. I invite you.
[1:19:34] go back and listen to the tapes. Go back
[1:19:36] and listen to him tell the stories. And
[1:19:38] and and he he he's he's struggling with
[1:19:41] it. He's doubting it. He's admitting
[1:19:43] he's doubting it. He can't he's not
[1:19:44] doubting God's word. He just can't. He's
[1:19:47] doubting that it could possibly be true
[1:19:49] about him.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what we doubt? We don't doubt
[1:19:53] God's word, but we doubt that it could
[1:19:55] be true about me.
[1:19:57] And God just said to him, you know, when
[1:19:59] you know the secret of people's hearts
[1:20:01] and you're able to cast out devils and
[1:20:04] do do you think that's you doing that?
[1:20:05] And brother Brandham caught it. Oh, all
[1:20:08] he needed was that example. And he said,
[1:20:09] "No, Lord, that's you." He said, "I
[1:20:12] realize then that any man, any son and
[1:20:15] daughter of God who's willing to live in
[1:20:17] those high atmospheres, if you say to
[1:20:20] this mountain, oh, and don't doubt it in
[1:20:22] your heart. I'm here to tell you
[1:20:23] something, friends. you you're hearing
[1:20:25] God say tonight, "Do you think it's you
[1:20:27] that makes you overcome sin? Do you
[1:20:30] think it's you that makes you a believer
[1:20:32] in 2025 when the world is abandoning it
[1:20:34] and the world is crazy and you're still
[1:20:36] here a bunch of weirdo oddball
[1:20:38] believers?"
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you, it's not you doing
[1:20:42] it. It's Christ in you doing it.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; And it's that same Christ where he says
[1:20:47] here, and that was in 1959. And even
[1:20:50] prior to that, God had already told him
[1:20:52] about his the next phase of his ministry
[1:20:55] coming. So, brother Brandham says this
[1:20:57] is this is 63. So, he'd had the
[1:21:00] squirrels in 59. I think it's around 57
[1:21:02] 58. He was told about his another his
[1:21:04] next ministry, the third pull. And he
[1:21:06] says, "For at least, this is what we
[1:21:08] have looked forward to for so long. For
[1:21:11] at least many years, four or five years
[1:21:13] or maybe longer. Hang on, I'm almost
[1:21:16] done. The third pull has now been
[1:21:19] vindicated.
[1:21:21] And I'm sure you all know what it is.
[1:21:25] See, and he says, he says, "Now
[1:21:27] remember, there'll never be an
[1:21:29] impersonation of that."
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Cuz it can't be. See,
[1:21:36] do you realize how secure God's word is
[1:21:41] from the third pole is from the devil
[1:21:43] impersonating it?
[1:21:46] People who don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:21:48] can't even impersonate a real Christian.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Satan can't even get an impersonation of
[1:21:56] a real Christian. How's he going to get
[1:21:58] an impersonation of the spoken word of
[1:22:00] God? Oh, hallelujah. He says, remember,
[1:22:03] there'll never be an impersonation cuz
[1:22:06] it can't be. See, it cannot be now. It's
[1:22:10] inexistent. And I am warned of this that
[1:22:13] soon, right at this time now, it's just
[1:22:15] happened. So here's why. So it could
[1:22:18] identify its presence among you. But it
[1:22:22] will not be used in a great way until
[1:22:24] the church until the council begins to
[1:22:26] tighten up. And when it does, the
[1:22:28] Pentecostal and so forth can almost
[1:22:29] impersonate anything can be done. But
[1:22:31] when that time comes, when the squeeze
[1:22:34] comes down, then you'll see what you've
[1:22:36] seen temporarily be manifested. There's
[1:22:39] that. There's that word again. Be
[1:22:41] manifested in the fullness of its power.
[1:22:45] Oh my precious brother and sister. You
[1:22:48] say when the squeeze is coming, whatever
[1:22:50] you do, don't go singing the song
[1:22:53] somewhere over a rainbow. I'm here to
[1:22:55] tell you the squeeze is upon us
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; and the world is falling apart. And even
[1:22:59] the whole world knows it. Even even this
[1:23:01] this this shocking assassination of of
[1:23:04] Charles Kirk and and and the airwaves
[1:23:06] are filled with people and they're and
[1:23:08] they're they're they're running have
[1:23:10] never read a Bible. And I and I saw one
[1:23:12] one guy he was he was showing all of

[1:23:23] church. I'm going to church tomorrow.
[1:23:25] And the whole world is saying
[1:23:26] something's happened. Something's
[1:23:28] changed. We're We've c you know, it's
[1:23:29] almost like they they realized they went
[1:23:31] beyond the Rubicon. I'm here to tell
[1:23:32] you, they went beyond it a long time ago
[1:23:34] and the world is only now in its last
[1:23:36] throws. Oh, rejoice because the marriage
[1:23:39] of the lamb has come and the bride has
[1:23:42] made herself ready. Why? She's the
[1:23:44] manifestation of this third pull.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; It's unstoppable. You are unstoppable.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; The the devil can't stop it. Assassin's
[1:23:55] bullets can't stop it. Even you can't
[1:23:57] stop it. Nothing can separate me from
[1:24:01] fulfilling God's plan for glory.
[1:24:03] Hallelujah. Oh, let's stand to our feet,
[1:24:06] friends. I want the devil to know. I
[1:24:07] want the whole world to know I am a
[1:24:09] believer. I will never not be a
[1:24:11] believer. I'm saying daily, Lord God,
[1:24:14] let your word come to pass in my life. I
[1:24:18] want to be part of the drama.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; How many want to be part of the drama?
[1:24:26] I want to be part of the drama.
[1:24:30] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Praise the
[1:24:33] Lord, Brother Kenny. Whatever's on your
[1:24:34] heart, let's sing it. Amen. We're going
[1:24:37] to It's already 8:30. I'm going to get
[1:24:38] to my prayer list. Amen. As they begin
[1:24:41] to play and sing, y'all come on up here
[1:24:43] and gather, and I'll keep preaching to
[1:24:44] you while you're coming. That'll give me
[1:24:46] an excuse to keep preaching.
[1:24:48] Come on and gather, friends. We're
[1:24:50] called to this hour
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; to be believers of the entire word.
[1:24:56] We're called to this moment. Don't let
[1:24:59] this moment slip past you. This is
[1:25:02] you're not here by accident. I'm here to
[1:25:05] tell you, you can't accidentally get a
[1:25:07] revelation.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; They don't come accidentally. They don't
[1:25:11] fall out of trees. The only people who
[1:25:14] can receive the inspiration of the word
[1:25:17] are the people who are inspirable.
[1:25:19] Inspiration only strikes the people who
[1:25:21] are inspireable.
[1:25:23] The the world, there'll be millions of
[1:25:25] people there, the remnant of the woman's
[1:25:26] seed. There'll be many people. God will
[1:25:28] grant them eternal life. But I'm here to
[1:25:30] tell you something, friends. I want to
[1:25:32] be part of the drama that takes a
[1:25:33] rapture. I want to be part of the drama
[1:25:36] that lives in the millennium. I want to
[1:25:39] be part of the first resurrection. I I
[1:25:41] get there will be millions saved in the
[1:25:43] second resurrection at the judgment bar.
[1:25:45] However many, I say millions, we don't
[1:25:47] even know. might be five, might be a
[1:25:49] billion. I don't know. All I know is
[1:25:50] when I read the scripture, there were
[1:25:52] some who were set on the right side and
[1:25:54] entered into the joys of the Lord.
[1:25:56] That's what the Bible says. That's what
[1:25:57] I know is true.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know that the that the
[1:26:01] that the books were open. I know the the
[1:26:03] heavens peeled back like a scroll. I
[1:26:05] know that cuz that's what the Bible
[1:26:06] tells me. I know that the that the the
[1:26:08] sea gives up its dead. I know that the
[1:26:10] dead, both small and great, stand there.
[1:26:12] I know that the books are open and
[1:26:14] another book is open, which is the book
[1:26:15] of life. I know that the people are
[1:26:17] judged out of the books and I know this.
[1:26:19] Everybody will get a fair trial.
[1:26:24] [Music]
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, it's not so bad." Well,
[1:26:28] if your case if you win, it's not so
[1:26:31] bad, but you don't get a lawyer and you
[1:26:34] can't appeal and God judges you based on
[1:26:37] your heart. I'm so I I'm I'm just glad
[1:26:40] at the end of the day that I'm not
[1:26:42] standing there being judged. I by the
[1:26:45] because when I got there, they just
[1:26:47] handed me a ticket and said, "You're

[1:26:52] See, I've already got my seat ready
[1:26:54] because my sins went ahead of me and
[1:26:55] were met in Christ. And when I arrive,

[1:30:09] for the three children who wish to stay

[1:30:14] choices if they are asked to testify in
[1:30:16] court if it can't be resolved in
[1:30:18] mediation. Thank you for your prayers
[1:30:20] during this important decision. They are

[1:31:55] tonight. Lord, this affliction on his
[1:31:57] back, you've already healed him of it
[1:31:58] one time before in the mighty name of
[1:32:01] the Lord Jesus Christ. May that thing
[1:32:03] drain. May our brother, Lord, be
