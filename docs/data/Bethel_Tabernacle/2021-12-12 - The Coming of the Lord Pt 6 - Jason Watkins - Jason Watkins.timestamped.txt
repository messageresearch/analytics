[15:17] sister phyllis um
[15:19] uh sent and i thought that i
[15:22] had it right there
[15:24] oh yeah here we go
[15:26] um
[15:29] prayer request for my youngest sister
[15:31] jackie
[15:32] she was
[15:34] uh this is from sister phyllis this is
[15:36] her sister
[15:37] she was in an
[15:39] uh car accident and or in an accident is
[15:41] it an automobile accident sister yeah
[15:44] and uh my having major surgery on both
[15:47] legs today
[15:49] she has an ongoing drug addiction
[15:51] problem and i've been praying for her
[15:53] life for her life to change and believe
[15:56] this situation has to
[15:58] has to do with that although the
[16:00] circumstances are very bad you know it's
[16:03] interesting how that the bible's a lot
[16:04] of times
[16:06] people um are misunderstanding that all
[16:10] things you know are supposed to be
[16:13] good but actually the bible doesn't
[16:15] prophesy that it says all things work
[16:18] together for your good so a lot of times
[16:21] things happen to us you go where's the
[16:22] good in that well just hang on
[16:25] wait for the rest of it to come together
[16:27] amen you don't eat the individual
[16:29] ingredients of a cake till it's put
[16:31] together and baked and then it's
[16:32] delicious
[16:33] but you wouldn't like it eating just the
[16:35] individual ingredients
[16:37] but let's just pray for this need and
[16:40] she says although the circumstance is
[16:42] very bad she has a broken kneecap on her
[16:44] left leg and broken bones on her right
[16:46] lower leg
[16:48] amen uh pray for her all around healing
[16:51] amen do you know it's the exact same
[16:54] healing that heals the body heals the
[16:55] soul
[16:57] amen
[16:58] it's the same word uh
[17:00] divine healing whether it's in the soul
[17:02] the spirit the mind the flesh
[17:05] the bible says that the word of god is
[17:07] health to all your flesh
[17:09] everything that makes up you
[17:11] is healable by the word of god
[17:15] amen praise the lord so many um
[17:18] participated so we won't want to take
[17:20] that request to the lord this morning
[17:22] but i just want to say one last time
[17:25] how thrilled i was with yesterday so
[17:27] many people made that possible so many
[17:30] brothers and sisters working behind the
[17:32] scene my goodness and today we have a a
[17:35] little bit of a special service we've
[17:37] got a um
[17:38] a production that our youth are going to
[17:40] put on for us
[17:42] and um
[17:44] okay that's fine the offering basket
[17:46] will be in the back as you go out they
[17:48] didn't get time we've been pre so
[17:50] pressed for time this morning uh but
[17:51] it'll be in the back uh for you as you
[17:54] as you go out
[17:55] um
[17:56] we've got a production today and got all
[17:58] these actors up here praise the lord
[18:03] amen praise the lord so they're going to
[18:05] be little preachers today amen and so
[18:08] we're happy for that we want to give
[18:09] some time for that but i think that we
[18:11] want to get the most important part
[18:13] which is the preached word
[18:16] from from
[18:17] a minister standing in the pulpit
[18:20] there's nothing the lord doesn't replace
[18:22] that with anything all the way until the
[18:24] body change amen it's live
[18:27] five-fold ministry preaching uh until
[18:30] the body change now that's the scripture
[18:32] some people have decided that they'll
[18:34] just stay home and play tapes that's
[18:36] fine but that's not the scripture
[18:39] for the complete picture and so the
[18:41] completed picture
[18:43] is that
[18:44] we do all of the above we read our bible
[18:46] we we pray we listen to the tapes we
[18:49] come to church we have fellowship
[18:52] we participate
[18:54] i got you you got me amen we need one
[18:57] another i need you you need me
[19:00] don't deny me you
[19:02] come on i need you i won't deny you me
[19:05] see i'll work hard and be sincere before
[19:08] the lord and we will we will come
[19:10] together but it was it was such a
[19:12] multi-effort for yesterday and today if
[19:15] i start naming names we'll we'll sure
[19:18] leave somebody out but let's go to the
[19:20] lord in prayer just now
[19:23] brother andrew just give me a court of
[19:25] only believe as we pray
[19:27] amen father
[19:30] how we thank you lord for this wonderful
[19:32] privilege to come into your house
[19:34] to be your manifestated manifested bride
[19:38] in the earth today
[19:40] lord we're
[19:41] we're it it where it leaves us
[19:43] dumbfounded at times how that we could
[19:45] have been
[19:46] lord with such a position and it's all
[19:49] your grace and your mercy lord father
[19:52] that that word of god is a sharp
[19:54] two-edged sword but lord we know
[19:57] according to the bible that that as that
[20:00] sword swings yes lord there is a law to
[20:02] it but there's a grace to it lord and we
[20:05] realize that father even under moses
[20:08] came the law but under elijah came grace
[20:10] lord and father under christ which is
[20:13] the elijah for this day we're swinging
[20:16] that sword today father and it's to cut
[20:19] down the enemy father to your to your
[20:22] to the enemy it's death it's a death
[20:24] blow but to your to your family when we
[20:27] swing the sword back and forth back and
[20:29] forth it's crying mercy grace mercy
[20:32] grace mercy grace lord we're thankful
[20:35] for that today
[20:36] i pray now that you will let it come to
[20:38] us in such a way heal our sick and
[20:40] afflicted lord we have this request from
[20:43] sister phyllis lord we're believing you
[20:45] for that request right now believing
[20:47] that you will grant this lord just as
[20:50] it's been asked of thee lord may there
[20:52] become great healing all the way down in
[20:54] her soul to to lord fix her life you're
[20:57] the only one who can fix broken lives
[21:00] lord i pray uh for sister kathy that you
[21:03] will continue to strengthen her lord by
[21:04] the power of your might and all the
[21:06] saints of god we commit it to you today
[21:09] in jesus name bless your word now both
[21:11] speaker and hearer bless our little
[21:13] preachers that'll come after after me
[21:15] lord and i pray all this whole day and
[21:18] the balance of it will be under your
[21:20] leadership and your approval in jesus
[21:22] name amen amen god bless you friends
[21:24] we're going to look at first
[21:25] thessalonians 4
[21:28] and we want to just read 13-18 we'll let
[21:30] you be seated but i would not have you
[21:32] to be ignorant brethren concerning them
[21:34] which are asleep
[21:36] that you sorrow not even as others which
[21:38] have no hope
[21:40] for if we believe that jesus died and
[21:42] rose again
[21:43] even so them also which sleep in jesus
[21:46] will god bring with him
[21:48] for this we say unto you by the word of
[21:50] the lord that we which are alive and
[21:53] remain
[21:54] unto the coming of the lord i'm
[21:56] preaching today on the coming of the
[21:58] lord part 6
[21:59] that we which are alive and remain unto
[22:01] the coming of the lord shall not prevent
[22:04] them which are sleep for the lord
[22:06] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[22:08] shout with the voice of the archangel
[22:10] and with the trump of god and the dead
[22:13] in christ shall rise first then we which
[22:16] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[22:18] together with them in the clouds to meet
[22:20] the lord in the air and so shall we ever
[22:23] be with the lord i love this 18th verse
[22:26] wherefore comfort one another with these
[22:29] words amen praise the lord that's that's
[22:32] comforting what we just read may god
[22:34] bless his word you can be seated
[22:40] so i i want to ask you to uh please have
[22:43] your attention very quickly at hand here
[22:45] and and others are coming in the
[22:47] musicians are transitioning but they'll
[22:49] get to hear because we've got sound all
[22:51] through
[22:52] um our neighbors get to hear singing and
[22:54] preaching amen and we've had a number of
[22:57] times where we called him standing
[22:59] outside listening so i just say blessed
[23:01] be the name of the lord amen amen you
[23:03] know you say um are you sure you sure we
[23:06] should do that yeah we should probably
[23:08] turn it up
[23:09] amen make it even louder so amen i
[23:12] appreciate the lord but we want to move
[23:14] right straight into to this segment
[23:17] today of the coming of the lord that i
[23:18] want to speak to you on my heart there
[23:20] be another portion yet we'll get to it
[23:24] as the lord allows but we're going to
[23:26] get at least try to get to a certain
[23:28] spot this morning so now you've you've
[23:30] all you're all very familiar with
[23:32] mechanics and dynamics and of course
[23:34] brother branham talks about
[23:37] that the mechanics are the word that are
[23:39] that you're storing up in your heart
[23:41] you're coming here today and you're
[23:43] storing mechanics and and there's coming
[23:46] a an outpouring of the dynamics which is
[23:49] not just something to say well somewhere
[23:52] over rainbow it's coming those dynamics
[23:54] are already happening now but what when
[23:57] we say mechanics become dynamics we're
[24:00] meaning that time when the trumpet of
[24:02] god shall sound and the dead in christ
[24:04] shall rise and and and that's what i'm
[24:07] particularly referencing right at this
[24:09] moment so don't don't you don't want to
[24:11] look down the road and say somewhere
[24:13] over a rainbow uh i'll finally get the
[24:15] holy spirit moving in my life you need
[24:17] to have him moving in your life now
[24:20] and we realize that i want to expand now
[24:23] your thoughts on mechanics and dynamics
[24:25] and now it's an important part to
[24:27] understand
[24:29] that it's it's it's not exactly the full
[24:32] picture
[24:34] if you're looking at it to say well
[24:36] right now it's mechanics
[24:38] but someday it'll be dynamics
[24:41] uh
[24:42] and then but then brother jason you've
[24:44] confused me because you're you're
[24:45] talking about how that it's already
[24:47] transitioning so the best way to
[24:49] understand it is the way brother branham
[24:51] described it mechanics become dynamics
[24:56] so it transitions just like brother
[24:58] branham said you take gasoline and you
[25:00] put fire to it now the gasoline is the
[25:03] mechanics
[25:05] see just like the word the fire you're
[25:08] holding in your hand is the dynamics
[25:10] that's the holy ghost now when you put
[25:12] this fire onto that gasoline
[25:15] the you don't somehow over here get a
[25:18] second episode where now you've got you
[25:21] know
[25:23] mechanics burning as soon as this
[25:26] dynamics touches mechanics mechanics
[25:28] become dynamics the whole thing becomes
[25:31] fire so it is transitioning but again
[25:35] we're focusing right at this moment on
[25:38] the completion on the fullness of
[25:41] adoption which is the change of our
[25:43] bodies now i want to expand your
[25:45] thinking just a little bit on mechanics
[25:47] because the bride is not the only one
[25:50] storing mechanics
[25:53] the bride is not the only one the
[25:55] antichrist has got mechanics
[25:58] and the antichrist is actually being set
[26:00] in order for his dynamics
[26:03] amen and we realize that when his
[26:05] dynamics come
[26:07] that it will be the antichrist mechanics
[26:11] will become dynamics in an incarnation
[26:14] of a man that the antichrist spirit will
[26:18] become a man satan will indwell uh where
[26:21] there's a demon as as a placeholder in
[26:23] the false prophet presently right now he
[26:26] has many demons that are placeholders
[26:29] waiting for lucifer himself when the
[26:31] bride goes up lucifer's kicked out and
[26:34] he comes down and he and he runs out the
[26:37] demons who are place holding and he
[26:39] fills that spot and then the the false
[26:42] prophet becomes the beast
[26:45] personified as a human you understand so
[26:49] so we're looking then that that you know
[26:52] and this is how that you know the
[26:54] antichrist system even through
[26:56] politics and through ecumenical
[26:58] movements remember that the power of the
[27:00] antichrist is trifold it is political
[27:03] power religious power and demon power
[27:07] all right and so you realize that satan
[27:10] the antichrist system has been working
[27:12] in the church for millennia but he's
[27:14] coming to a time and it's very near it
[27:16] now where he's going to take the full
[27:18] reigns the only thing holding him back
[27:20] is you
[27:22] see but we realize that he works through
[27:24] politics he works through pulpits he
[27:26] works through you know he even even if
[27:28] you look at unions and i'm not here to
[27:31] preach for against unions i'm neither
[27:32] republican or democrat i'm a christian
[27:35] but but you realize that that a lot of
[27:37] times the unions allow him to very
[27:40] quickly make a maneuver pull a little
[27:42] string and suddenly millions of people
[27:44] line up
[27:45] to a direction
[27:47] and i'm not saying they're good or bad
[27:48] i'm not i'm not talking about that i'm
[27:50] talking about it's something like
[27:52] pulpits that satan uses not saying
[27:54] pulpits are bad or people who are bad or
[27:56] preaching false doctrine i'm saying the
[27:58] enemy has control of something
[28:01] amen and can use that something you know
[28:03] that that's what elon musk right now is
[28:06] arguing against you know the president's
[28:09] plan
[28:10] for
[28:11] you know to give you incentives
[28:13] government incentives if you change to
[28:15] electric vehicle
[28:16] and but the catch is that he'll give 12
[28:20] 500 if if the vehicle you buy was built
[28:23] by a union worker
[28:25] in the united states and if it was built
[28:27] by a non-union worker they only you only
[28:29] get half the credit and so musk is
[28:31] saying hey that's not fair and it's not
[28:33] fair but that's that's politics you
[28:36] understand and so you don't want to be
[28:38] unaware of of satan's politics we're not
[28:41] up here to con to preach conspiracy
[28:44] theory i'm not preaching theory and
[28:45] preaching prophecy
[28:47] and there's plenty of conspiracy to go
[28:49] around and i don't i don't i don't like
[28:51] the the wild side of that it gets on my
[28:54] nerves really and i'll quickly walk away
[28:56] from someone who gets on a roll with
[28:58] that but i but i'm also not unaware of
[29:00] the satan's devices
[29:03] and you need to be aware that this ain't
[29:04] no this isn't this isn't cub scouts this
[29:07] is real time this is the antichrist
[29:09] taking over the world in real time
[29:13] in the exact same way that the elect
[29:16] lady is getting all of her mechanics set
[29:18] up uh for the dynamics which brother
[29:20] branham said will be a refilling of the
[29:22] holy ghost to do what to quicken the
[29:25] word that you're storing in your heart
[29:27] right now as you're believing this word
[29:30] this is why you hear brother jason say
[29:32] god is doing more in you than you're
[29:33] aware as you are storing up the word i
[29:36] promise you you're giving more uh you're
[29:39] giving more food you're giving more
[29:41] power you're giving more mechanics for
[29:44] the holy ghost to anoint in your life
[29:46] not in a tribulation not when the saints
[29:49] come back but right now
[29:51] in your life in real time it is to
[29:54] quicken the word that we've held in our
[29:56] hearts by faith
[29:58] and so you know we we think about you
[30:01] know what is your expectation what is
[30:04] your expectation as we near uh the body
[30:07] change you know and i and i and i want
[30:09] to try to answer that for you today and
[30:11] let you know that the only thing we are
[30:14] given to expect is the promised word
[30:17] what god has promised and so so then
[30:21] because that's true
[30:22] if you don't have faith in the word of
[30:26] this end time hour then how would you
[30:29] expect anything you know uh uh
[30:33] as far as the bride leaving here
[30:36] how would that be part of your
[30:38] expectation
[30:39] if you don't have a full faith in the
[30:42] word sent to help you leave here
[30:45] to give you a body change i i think
[30:47] you're seeing my point there's no way if
[30:49] if the devil is able to to weaken your
[30:53] faith in the message of this hour which
[30:56] was sent for the express purpose to
[30:59] restore the faith
[31:02] see the faith of the early apostles
[31:05] which they had enough faith to go in a
[31:07] rapture but the church backslid now
[31:10] we've come back we've had a message
[31:12] restored and i'm here to tell you it's
[31:14] our lives picking up where they crested
[31:17] over and began to decline we take it on
[31:19] to the body change
[31:20] but it is that if the if the if the holy
[31:24] ghost anointing the mechanics is what
[31:27] brings your body change how do you
[31:29] expect a body change if your faith is
[31:31] not in the mechanics
[31:33] if you're questioning the mechanics if
[31:35] you think it's a it's an outdated
[31:37] message if you think it was just a man
[31:39] he's just a prophet he's full of
[31:40] mistakes and a lot of it's just his
[31:42] opinion i'm here to tell you i'm nervous
[31:44] for you when it comes body change time
[31:48] i'm here to say lord you sent me thus
[31:50] saith the lord it's not about me trying
[31:52] to figure out who's right i'm not here
[31:54] to qualify a prophet i'm here to accept
[31:56] thus saith the lord and then you
[31:58] promised that you would anoint that word
[32:01] that i'm believing in my heart see
[32:06] so the lesson then in this question
[32:09] the lesson to be learned is that your
[32:10] faith had better be in the rapturing
[32:13] word that was promised for this day see
[32:16] the mechanics for the gentiles and for
[32:19] israel are being set in order israel is
[32:21] fully a nation they have their own
[32:23] borders they have their own money they
[32:25] have their own flag the six point star
[32:27] of david their full nation recognizing
[32:30] and that was not true for thousands of
[32:32] years but it only came to pass in the
[32:35] late 20th century and so we realized
[32:38] then that you have the antichrist system
[32:40] with her mechanics you have the gentile
[32:43] church that will be left behind with
[32:45] their mechanics the ecumenical movement
[32:48] you have israel with their mechanics and
[32:50] the bride has got her mechanics set up
[32:54] you believe it church nominal has
[32:56] mechanics the antichrist system has
[32:59] mechanics and they're all we're we're
[33:02] all
[33:03] waiting for our dynamics
[33:06] you understand that
[33:08] so you understand they say well we're
[33:11] here getting ready for something so is
[33:13] everybody else that's right
[33:15] they have a misunderstanding in their
[33:17] expectation their expectation is that
[33:20] when the rapture comes the nominal
[33:22] church has an expectation they'll go in
[33:24] the rapture and i'm not and i'm and my
[33:27] message to them is you're you're going
[33:29] to miss it but not because you're bad
[33:31] people you're going to miss it because
[33:33] you haven't received the rapturing word
[33:36] which would give you rapturing faith
[33:39] see
[33:40] and so so we realized that then this is
[33:42] why the unwise virgin this is why she is
[33:46] unwise
[33:47] because she refuses the message that was
[33:50] brought to give her the faith for a body
[33:53] change
[33:54] and so when the appointed hour arrives
[33:57] which i'm going to tell you something
[33:58] friends is going to be a morning just
[34:00] like any other morning and things are
[34:02] going to happen very quickly
[34:04] i want you to be aware of that today
[34:06] young people you'll see it in your
[34:08] lifetime on that morning
[34:10] when the dead in christ rise things
[34:13] globally are going to happen very
[34:15] quickly
[34:17] mechanics will transition rapidly into
[34:20] full dynamics of the holy ghost and it
[34:23] will manifest all the seed of all the
[34:26] groups that are holding
[34:28] seed in their heart holding of faith
[34:30] whether their their faith is in science
[34:33] that'll have a dynamic
[34:34] whether their faith is in an ecumenical
[34:36] denominational system that'll have a
[34:38] dynamic you see that'll have a result
[34:40] that'll grow a crop that'll come to
[34:42] fruition
[34:43] remember that when they sowed they they
[34:47] sowed tares among the wheat and jesus
[34:49] they said jesus shall we take them pull
[34:51] them up no he says let them grow
[34:54] together and at the harvest now watch
[34:56] the first thing that happens you say oh
[34:58] can you just get to the part where the
[35:00] grain is taken to the garner we're going
[35:02] to get there but do you know what
[35:04] happens ahead of that the tares have to
[35:07] first be bound together for the burning
[35:10] then we go in the rapture and that
[35:12] scripture is happening right now
[35:15] i'm here to tell you dynamics are
[35:16] already binding them together and
[35:19] setting a platform for satan to to enter
[35:22] to tabernacle inside a false prophet and
[35:25] become a beast system
[35:27] and take the world into destruction
[35:29] while a bride is seated at a table
[35:31] thousands of miles long
[35:33] this is reality friends this isn't a
[35:35] story this is actually not something
[35:37] that's going to happen it's happening
[35:40] right now it's already underway
[35:44] see
[35:46] and so there it's going to transition
[35:48] very rapidly we can look at a few places
[35:51] in the scripture proverbs 6 14 to 16.
[35:55] watch watch how solomon uh treats the
[35:59] forward person which is a person with a
[36:01] perverted heart all right
[36:03] so frowardness in his heart
[36:06] speaking of a man with frowitness in his
[36:08] heart he deviseth mischief continually
[36:11] he soweth discord
[36:13] therefore catch it shall his calamity
[36:16] come suddenly
[36:19] suddenly shall he be broken without
[36:21] remedy the sixth so these six things
[36:25] doth the lord hey yeah seven aren't
[36:27] abomination in him so so we're we're
[36:29] finding that that there's a thing that's
[36:32] coming where when it happens it's going
[36:34] to move rapidly i you know they don't
[36:37] have it back there i didn't tell them
[36:38] but let me just read that same passage
[36:40] from the nlt their perverted hearts plot
[36:42] evil and they constantly stir up trouble
[36:46] but they will be destroyed suddenly
[36:48] broken in an instant beyond all hope of
[36:51] healing
[36:54] that's the person who has perverted evil
[36:57] in their heart when because the the
[36:59] perverted evil is the mechanics they're
[37:02] building up perversion and evil in their
[37:04] hearts because why they've trusted in
[37:06] the arm of flesh they've trusted in
[37:08] science they've trusted in man-made
[37:09] religion they've trusted in politics
[37:12] they maybe maybe they they've trusted in
[37:14] some energy something they don't even
[37:16] know what it is but i'm here to tell you
[37:17] i have trusted in the revealed word of
[37:20] this hour
[37:21] and when this happens and it moves
[37:22] quickly
[37:24] we're going to leave quickly they're
[37:25] going to transition quickly satan's
[37:27] going to move rapidly and the whole
[37:29] world is going to descend and go from
[37:31] existence that has lasted 6 000 years
[37:36] to being snuffed out in 42 months
[37:40] that's a rapid decline isaiah 47 look at
[37:43] it again
[37:45] 47 7-11 man i got to hurry
[37:48] and thou
[37:49] i will be a lady forever so that thou
[37:51] didst not lay these things to thy heart
[37:53] neither disremember the latter end of it
[37:55] in other words this is a this is a
[37:57] people who didn't take the prophets
[38:00] seriously they didn't believe don't read
[38:02] ahead of me they didn't believe the
[38:04] message that the prophet brought them
[38:06] and they didn't think they needed it and
[38:08] their their testimony was you said i'll
[38:11] be a lady forever so that thou didst not
[38:15] lay these things to thy heart neither
[38:17] disremember the latter end of it
[38:19] therefore now hear this
[38:21] you who rejected it watch
[38:23] now hear uh now therefore hear now this
[38:27] thou that art given to pleasures that
[38:30] dwell us carelessly thou sayest in thine
[38:33] heart i am and none else beside me see
[38:35] you're your own you're your own boss
[38:37] i shall i shall not sit as a widow
[38:39] neither shall i know the loss of
[38:41] children but these two things shall come
[38:43] upon thee in a moment in one day the
[38:47] loss of children and widowhood they
[38:49] shall come upon thee in their perfection
[38:52] for the multitude of thy sorceries and
[38:55] for the great abundance of thine
[38:57] enchantments for thou has trusted in thy
[39:00] wickedness thou has said none seeth me
[39:03] thy wisdom and thy knowledge it hath
[39:05] perverted thee and thou has said in
[39:07] thine heart i am and none else beside me
[39:10] therefore shall evil come upon thee thou
[39:13] shalt not know from whence it riseth and
[39:15] mischief shall fall upon thee thou shalt
[39:18] not be able to put it off and desolation
[39:20] shall come upon thee suddenly which thou
[39:23] shalt not know
[39:26] so it appears then that with the very
[39:29] same outpouring that is literally going
[39:32] to bring a manifestation in the bride
[39:35] will also bring a manifestation in the
[39:37] church we'll also bring a manifestation
[39:40] in israel we'll also start toward the
[39:43] manifestation of the antichrist coming
[39:46] into a personification
[39:48] coming into the full beast and so the
[39:50] mechanics of every group
[39:53] is almost at this time right today in
[39:56] 2021 we're almost done with this year
[39:58] i'm here to tell you all of these
[40:00] mechanics for everything that needs to
[40:02] happen is already in place now
[40:06] and every 24 hours it takes closer and
[40:09] closer to an inevitable irreversible
[40:12] irrevocable
[40:14] i mean listen friends i read in the book
[40:17] of revelation
[40:18] you think i and you think i'm not don't
[40:20] have a heart for for people i've
[40:23] dedicated my whole life to the service
[40:25] of fallen man
[40:27] i'm trying to tell everybody as brother
[40:28] fred says trying to tell everybody about
[40:31] somebody who can help anybody
[40:34] a man and and and you think i don't read
[40:37] the things that jesus prophesies that
[40:40] are coming on the earth terrible you
[40:42] think i don't read the book of
[40:43] revelation and the things that are going
[40:44] to be fall
[40:46] children and old people and the and it
[40:49] doesn't matter it's not going to it's
[40:51] not gonna be racial it's not gonna be
[40:53] national it's not gonna be gender
[40:55] specific it's not gonna respect age and
[40:57] and millions millions and millions and
[41:00] billions even brother brown said are
[41:01] gonna perish according to the book of
[41:03] revelation and i'm here to tell you that
[41:06] breaks my heart that makes my heart
[41:07] bleed but i'm sorry i can't stop it
[41:12] i would
[41:13] if i could hold it back i would the only
[41:15] thing i can do is live here and try to
[41:17] find as many as i can and give them the
[41:20] hope that is in the word of this hour
[41:23] because the mechanics have reached a
[41:25] point now to where everything is set in
[41:28] order you're not you don't have to worry
[41:29] about a future of things coming into
[41:31] order they're in order
[41:32] now malachi 3 1 watch this because
[41:36] here's the other side of it here's the
[41:38] good side malachi 3 1 behold i will send
[41:40] my messenger and he shall prepare the
[41:43] way before me and the lord whom you seek
[41:46] shall suddenly come to his temple even
[41:49] the messenger of the covenant whom you
[41:50] delight in behold he shall come saith
[41:52] the lord of hosts so so we realize
[41:55] friends that that i'm i'm reading these
[41:57] scriptures to show you that
[42:00] that when the trumpet of god sounds and
[42:02] we're already well in through the shout
[42:05] well into the stage of the voice and the
[42:07] trumpet of god when that sounds and the
[42:09] dead in christ rise first things are
[42:11] gonna go at lightning speed
[42:13] now you know what the world won't quite
[42:15] realize it they won't realize that
[42:17] they've just been reduced from 6 000
[42:19] years to 42 months but things will start
[42:22] transitioning so quickly it'll make
[42:24] their head spin they think the world's
[42:25] going crazy now it's cub scouts now
[42:28] compared to what it's going to be i'm
[42:29] here to tell you you don't want to be
[42:30] here i don't want to be here during that
[42:32] time hallelujah
[42:34] we find that laodicea as an age to the
[42:37] world as time is history it doesn't end
[42:39] until the bride goes because the bride
[42:42] is actually the holder of the spirit
[42:44] she's the holder of the word she's the
[42:46] holder of the blood and god's wrath
[42:49] which must come on the gentiles it must
[42:52] come on the gentiles in the form of a
[42:54] great tribulation but it cannot come on
[42:57] the gentiles as long as the gentile
[42:59] bride is here on earth because god
[43:01] cannot pass judgment through blood and
[43:04] prophet said you are the blood of god by
[43:07] the spirit see
[43:09] so the life that was in the blood how
[43:11] did that work how did that happen the
[43:13] life that was in the blood is in her by
[43:15] the baptism of the holy ghost she is the
[43:18] salt of the earth that's how you're the
[43:19] salt of the earth that's how you're the
[43:22] savior that's how you're the
[43:23] non-corrupter that's how you're the
[43:25] preservative because the you have
[43:27] received you are the blood of god by the
[43:30] spirit and god can't unleash judgment
[43:33] and cross over blood
[43:34] you see
[43:35] but once the bride is gone the pr and
[43:38] the preservative is gone
[43:40] oh my that's that's going to be that's
[43:42] going to be a time you're going to find
[43:44] during that time that when moses and
[43:46] elijah go forward you're going to find
[43:48] an unwise virgin that gets left behind i
[43:52] i think that those those unwise virgins
[43:54] are going to gain a lot of strength and
[43:56] a lot of courage from those two
[43:57] international prophets if you ask me i
[43:59] think that god has done it that way on
[44:01] purpose and that uh you say well might
[44:04] they find a message book or might they
[44:06] be somebody we live near might there be
[44:08] a family who knows about the message
[44:09] yeah all all
[44:11] all possible
[44:12] but i'm here to tell you that i think
[44:14] they're going to gain a lot of courage
[44:16] to not take the mark of the beast when
[44:18] they see those two international
[44:19] prophets moving
[44:21] oh my that that gives me a little bit of
[44:23] hope but it also says to me oh if they
[44:25] could just believe now if they could
[44:27] just receive it now my but we find that
[44:31] it's all going to happen friends they
[44:33] may gain strength the message of moses
[44:35] and elijah
[44:36] will so sweep the world that even the
[44:39] the unwise virgin would gain strength
[44:41] from it and and realize enough not to
[44:44] take the mark of the beast you know
[44:47] when we when we think about what god is
[44:50] calling us to when we talk about the
[44:53] dynamics now i want to take my last just
[44:55] my last ten minutes i'm trying to get
[44:57] out of the way quickly because i gotta
[44:58] i'm gonna carry this on in part seven
[45:00] don't worry you're not gonna miss
[45:02] anything but i want to come to this
[45:04] today
[45:06] is that when we talk about the dynamics
[45:09] all right of the holy ghost
[45:11] being a refilling brother man called it
[45:13] a fresh surge
[45:15] he called it a refilling it talks about
[45:18] a dynamics outpouring and a lot of times
[45:21] we we want to look at the supernatural
[45:23] side we want to look at the creation of
[45:25] squirrels and the cursing of a storm and
[45:28] the cursing of a tumor and there's our
[45:30] children being brought to eternal life
[45:32] granted the salvation of our children
[45:34] and and and you know and and all of
[45:37] these various ways that the third poll
[45:39] manifested itself but let me tell you
[45:41] something friends that that what what is
[45:44] is really a more important thing than
[45:47] all of that is that when christ came
[45:50] down one of the last things i mean he
[45:53] had expressed lots of power
[45:55] but one of the last things he expressed
[45:57] was a death and gusting
[46:01] amen
[46:02] see
[46:03] a death in gethsemane it was a a
[46:06] gethsemane death of a total
[46:10] life of commitment a surrendered life of
[46:14] total commitment see not not
[46:17] demonstrations of power like the world
[46:19] looks for because first of all that's
[46:21] already been done
[46:23] i get it i know sometimes i see such
[46:26] hypocrisy you see things you go my
[46:28] goodness if we just had the days of
[46:30] brother branham back again we could go
[46:31] in there and prove it to him brother
[46:32] branham did that seven times around the
[46:34] world for 33 years
[46:36] and he said every time i come to
[46:37] california they're worse
[46:39] and he would go back again and discern
[46:41] their hearts and heal their sick and
[46:42] preach the gospel come back again in
[46:44] their worst
[46:45] so we're not we're not i'm not i'm not
[46:47] denying that that about brother branham
[46:50] speculated possibly missing limbs power
[46:53] of creation i get that and and don't
[46:55] forget in gethsemane jesus operated the
[46:58] power of creation not saying it's absent
[47:01] jesus literally through the power of
[47:02] creation re restored an ear that simon
[47:05] had cut off
[47:07] simon had cut off and jesus just put it
[47:09] back
[47:10] and and healed the man i i heard a
[47:13] preacher saying one time he said i'll
[47:15] promise you simon wasn't aiming for his
[47:17] ear
[47:20] but he got his ear and jesus just said
[47:22] you know put your sword away because
[47:23] simon this is a different hour this is
[47:26] i'm getting ready to go to calvary and
[47:29] there if i if i hope to be successful at
[47:31] calvary i got to be successful at
[47:33] gethsemane
[47:35] i got to be able to lay my life down
[47:37] because the world is looking for a
[47:39] demonstration of power uh you know but
[47:42] but but we find that you know jesus had
[47:45] power to
[47:46] to restore an ear jesus had power to
[47:49] call 12 legions of angels
[47:51] remember that so we're not talking about
[47:53] an absence of power we're not talking
[47:55] about oh i'm not here to disappoint
[47:56] today to say hey no power's coming what
[47:59] i'm here to do today is get you to see a
[48:01] vital part of the opening of the seven
[48:04] seals and that is to bring you to a
[48:06] surrender in gethsemane
[48:09] to where you can get to this greater
[48:11] accomplishment for us to be able to say
[48:13] like the lord when the lord said when
[48:15] the lord said not my will thine be done
[48:21] this was a time i mean jesus had power
[48:25] on the cross
[48:26] to win the thief
[48:29] so you understand
[48:31] even within the third pole yeah there's
[48:33] power there's power for healing
[48:35] there's power for salvation amen there's
[48:38] power for deliverance
[48:40] he healed an ear he could have called
[48:42] angels he saves the thief
[48:44] so you get power for healing in the
[48:46] third pool you get power for deliverance
[48:48] in the third pool you get power to lead
[48:51] the dead and sin to life
[48:53] in the third poll but but on the cross
[48:56] we find that his greatest accomplishment
[48:59] was to say father
[49:01] into thy hands i commend my spirit
[49:05] [Music]
[49:08] see
[49:09] to commend means to place with someone
[49:12] it means to give in charge it means to
[49:15] commit it means to entrust it's very
[49:18] similar to first peter chapter 4 verse
[49:21] 19 wherefore let them that suffer
[49:23] according to the will of god
[49:26] commit the keeping of
[49:28] their souls to him in well-doing as unto
[49:32] a faithful creator so when jesus says
[49:35] father i entrust my spirit that's why
[49:38] the nlt renders it that way father i
[49:41] entrust my spirit into your hands and
[49:45] with these words
[49:46] he breathed his last
[49:49] and i just wrote that this morning and i
[49:50] thought about that as i read that and i
[49:52] said lord let me have that same
[49:54] testimony and and and breathe my last as
[49:57] me and say father i commend my life into
[50:01] your hands let me awake and find that
[50:04] i'm you oh god let me have a gethsemane
[50:07] let me have a calvary that's one of the
[50:10] greatest effects that the opening of the
[50:12] seals has done is to bring a bride into
[50:15] the very image
[50:16] of christ as i've said to you over and
[50:18] over and over again it's not about
[50:20] increasing your theology it's about
[50:22] bringing you into his image
[50:27] and that's our greatest that was the
[50:28] greatest purpose in opening the seven
[50:31] seals was to restore the body and blood
[50:33] of christ to the earth that's what as i
[50:36] said to you wednesday that's the very
[50:38] thing that's what connects john 6
[50:40] except you eat my flesh and drink my
[50:42] blood you have no life in you
[50:44] that's what connects john 6 to
[50:45] revelation 10 9.
[50:47] go and eat and ask for a little book and
[50:50] and i went and asked and he said you
[50:51] must eat the book this is the same this
[50:53] is the same one this is what jesus was
[50:54] prophesying would come because we're
[50:57] realizing that his body was meat indeed
[51:00] and his and his blood was drink indeed
[51:02] he says for i came down from heaven not
[51:06] to do my own will but the will of him
[51:08] that sent me and this is the will of him
[51:10] that sent me that everyone which seeth
[51:13] the son and believeth on him may have
[51:15] everlasting life and i will raise him up
[51:17] at the last day and that's why jesus
[51:20] constantly was saying to them i am the
[51:22] living bread he just kept repeating it
[51:24] kept repeating it i'm the living bread
[51:26] which came down from heaven if any man
[51:28] eat of this bread he shall live forever
[51:30] and and and the bread that i give is my
[51:32] flesh which i will give for the life of
[51:35] the world and the jews were stunned at
[51:38] that you know and
[51:39] and said among themselves man how can
[51:41] this man give us his flesh to eat and
[51:43] the world today is once again just as
[51:46] confused on what he means in revelation
[51:49] 10 9 about eating the book they're just
[51:52] as confused today but to us who
[51:54] understand it to us who have had their
[51:57] word revealed
[51:59] this is our life this is only this is
[52:01] what makes life worth it
[52:04] verily verily i say to you except you
[52:06] eat the flesh of the son of man and
[52:07] drink his blood you have no life in you
[52:09] who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[52:11] blood hath eternal life i'll raise him
[52:12] up the last day for my flesh is meat
[52:14] indeed and my blood is drink indeed
[52:16] so this is
[52:18] this is the true message
[52:20] restored under the opening of the seals
[52:24] this passage in john 6 is a direct link
[52:26] to revelation 10.
[52:28] because jesus is saying you've got to
[52:30] eat it and the angel which is christ
[52:32] again saying you've got to eat it see
[52:35] and so it's not it's not when we find
[52:37] where he says here watch this
[52:39] he that he's my flesh and drinketh my
[52:41] blood dwelleth
[52:42] in me
[52:43] and i in him now now you have no excuse
[52:46] to say oh this is only a passage about
[52:48] him no
[52:49] the whole point was to get into you
[52:52] see he that eateth my flesh and drinketh
[52:54] my blood dwelleth in me and i in him as
[52:57] the living father hath sent me and i
[52:58] lived by the father so he that eateth me
[53:01] even he shall live by me this is that
[53:03] bread which came down from heaven not as
[53:05] your fathers had eat manna and are dead
[53:07] he that eateth of this bread shall live
[53:09] forever so it's not getting people to
[53:12] receive our life
[53:14] or receive our thoughts it's but but
[53:17] what it is you know it's not about us
[53:19] lifting ourselves up
[53:21] that's not what it is it's it's it's not
[53:24] you know i'm not trying to get you to
[53:25] have part of my life i'm not here in
[53:27] other words the seventh seal has
[53:29] revealed to me that i'm not here to be
[53:31] about me
[53:32] it's not about my goals it's to lift him
[53:35] up
[53:36] our life is hid in christ and all of my
[53:40] goals are surrendered to christ
[53:43] see
[53:45] it's not a challenge that many can
[53:46] embrace winding down
[53:49] it's not a challenge that many can
[53:50] embrace that even some sadly who've said
[53:53] in the ranks of measures assemblies for
[53:55] years and generations even
[53:57] but for the ones who can
[54:01] for the ones who will
[54:03] these are the ones that are going in the
[54:06] rapture
[54:08] i want to tell you that friends it
[54:09] doesn't matter if you have accepted the
[54:11] theology under the opening of the seven
[54:13] seals and you can quote it forwards and
[54:15] backwards satan doesn't care how right
[54:17] you are in your doctrine
[54:19] you've got to have that gethsemane
[54:21] surrender you've got to be on calvary
[54:23] with christ and you've got to be able to
[54:25] say lord my whole life today everything
[54:27] about me i commend my life into your
[54:31] hands this is what i've been restored to
[54:33] it's all about his goals and his dreams
[54:36] because we we showed you wednesday that
[54:38] that the only that the only eating after
[54:41] that in the whole book of revelation the
[54:43] only eating and drinking is that when we
[54:46] find and we're not going to turn but in
[54:47] revelation 17 you find that that that
[54:50] that the the ten horns that thou sauce
[54:53] upon the beast will hate the and
[54:55] eat her flesh revelation 19 how that uh
[54:59] fowls were called to eat the flesh of
[55:01] kings and and and you realize of course
[55:04] now when you read that you realize
[55:05] that's that's paul's reference in
[55:08] galatians 5 2 devouring one another
[55:10] remember paul says for off for all the
[55:13] laws fulfilled in one word even this
[55:15] that thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[55:17] thyself remember love is the person
[55:18] that's the capstone
[55:20] you can't get that love without his life
[55:22] because
[55:23] real love's not a feeling or an emotion
[55:26] now you have a feeling and emotion that
[55:27] we call love but that's just human
[55:29] sensation see that can change in a
[55:32] moment you'll love me until i won't
[55:33] until i stop doing things for you or
[55:36] until i come against you then you won't
[55:37] love me much anymore but this is a love
[55:39] that passes understanding that even when
[55:41] i'm in a trial i know he loves me
[55:43] even when things even when i pray a
[55:45] prayer and things get worse i still know
[55:46] he loves me you understand this is how
[55:49] god operates this is what god is doing
[55:51] in our lives and paul says paul says it
[55:53] that way thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[55:56] thyself but if you do if you bite and
[55:58] devour one another take heed that you be
[56:00] not consumed one of another this is
[56:02] exactly what happens in the tribulation
[56:04] period to kings and to antichrist
[56:07] because they they they rejected the love
[56:10] of god they rejected the capstone they
[56:13] rejected the opening of the seals and
[56:15] they they did not come into the image of
[56:17] christ they didn't leave the earth when
[56:19] the bride left and they're left here and
[56:20] you know what they do they eat and
[56:22] devour one another
[56:24] the only drinking that takes place is in
[56:27] revelation 14 where they literally drink
[56:29] the
[56:30] wine of the wrath of the fornication of
[56:33] the system
[56:35] oh but i'm going to tell you something
[56:36] friends there is one more drinking that
[56:38] takes place and that is jesus said to
[56:40] those who overcome i'll grant to to
[56:43] drink from the river of what river of
[56:45] life that's the drinking that i want my
[56:47] precious friends that's the hour that we
[56:50] have arrived at that's what god has
[56:52] brought us to in this hour and so so we
[56:56] find that this is the critical critical
[56:59] thing brother brown says this and watch
[57:00] this i'm going to read this and we'll
[57:01] we'll stop
[57:04] in the message turn on the light in 1964
[57:06] he says i speak in the name of the lord
[57:09] you watch and see if it isn't true
[57:11] the light
[57:12] of the hour
[57:13] those cold creeds can never bring a
[57:15] harvest we've got to have a church
[57:17] that's washed in the blood of the lamb
[57:19] and become one with the word be the
[57:21] church see
[57:22] church glares of this day jesus said our
[57:25] very deceiving almost the elected if it
[57:27] were possible
[57:29] just the elected but as it was in the
[57:31] days of noah when eight souls were saved
[57:32] so shall it be the coming of the son of
[57:34] man and brother iran says very very few
[57:36] will be saved at that time
[57:39] see i'll tell you something friends
[57:41] think about this
[57:44] there's precious little difference
[57:45] between
[57:47] the wise version virgin and the unwise
[57:49] virgin
[57:52] they they both come from the same piece
[57:54] of goods
[57:56] they're it's one piece of fabric and
[57:58] there's a pattern in in inside his
[58:00] election outside his remnant just like a
[58:01] woman that sews she cuts around her
[58:04] pattern but she still has a remnant it's
[58:06] all the same material you understand
[58:09] they have the same material brother
[58:10] branham even talks about they're
[58:11] receiving a seed meaning the word of god
[58:14] but but because they don't receive the
[58:16] engrafted word because they don't
[58:18] receive the living seed and
[58:20] and they don't get the moisture to make
[58:22] it grow they can't
[58:23] because the holy ghost in this age can't
[58:26] anoint a false word
[58:28] and so we we've got to have first of all
[58:30] the restored word and then the dynamics
[58:32] can come and anoint that and change our
[58:35] lives i'm here to tell you something
[58:36] friends
[58:37] you know you look at the foolish virgins
[58:38] say well in the in the in the
[58:41] tribulation she'll probably end up
[58:43] believing this message probably so but
[58:45] it won't help her
[58:47] you understand see you say today say why
[58:50] do you say that brother jason because
[58:51] you might see it today and say well i
[58:52] believe the message
[58:53] well
[58:54] so will she
[58:56] but it won't help her
[58:57] see
[58:58] because she because why brother brown
[59:01] says she never received the moisture to
[59:03] make it grow
[59:05] you've got to have the holy ghost you've
[59:07] got to have that personal experience
[59:08] it's got sitting in message assemblies
[59:10] your whole life multi generations you
[59:12] might have been raised up and be second
[59:14] third and fourth and fifth generations i
[59:16] don't know you might was coming off the
[59:18] street yesterday but i'm here to tell
[59:19] you you've got to have a personal
[59:21] experience with christ that's what the
[59:24] seven seals did that's what the opening
[59:26] of the word
[59:27] accomplished see
[59:30] and and i and i realize of course i'm
[59:32] not here to i mean i realize that that
[59:35] that election uh is the end of it all it
[59:37] trumps everything
[59:39] and i realize that you know there's not
[59:41] going to be any extra placemats at that
[59:44] table thousands of miles long i realize
[59:45] there's also not going to be empty
[59:47] chairs any empty chairs
[59:49] and i'm glad for that
[59:51] but you know something friends
[59:55] when i think of it that way
[59:58] then i i realized wow
[1:00:00] then if god's not going to be defeated
[1:00:03] and he's not going to lose you
[1:00:05] and yet you sit in a message assembly
[1:00:08] and you haven't really eaten the book
[1:00:10] you haven't really had that gethsemane
[1:00:12] surrender of all your life and all your
[1:00:14] goals and all your dreams you haven't
[1:00:16] been able to say father and to thy hands
[1:00:18] i commend my spirit
[1:00:22] i put my whole life in your hands
[1:00:25] and and and you know that when you won't
[1:00:28] come to that and yet then god won't lose
[1:00:30] any of his own then i'm going to say i'm
[1:00:33] going to say it like this friends you
[1:00:34] will come to it
[1:00:36] or you will be brought to it
[1:00:39] by the tender hand of jehovah
[1:00:42] i don't want to go that route
[1:00:44] i want to say father i surrender
[1:00:46] right now i surrender listen friends
[1:00:49] he's restoring
[1:00:50] garden of eden life
[1:00:53] that's why brother branham called it a a
[1:00:55] bride age a bride time
[1:00:58] a harvest age a harvest time a garden
[1:01:02] age a garden time
[1:01:05] what is he doing he's restoring garden
[1:01:08] life to his family
[1:01:10] that's what the millennium is all about
[1:01:13] going back to finish that seventh day
[1:01:16] he's not merely restoring deep
[1:01:18] understanding of mysteries no no he's
[1:01:20] restoring garden life and we're we're
[1:01:23] now today privileged to be a partaker
[1:01:25] today you have an access if you want it
[1:01:28] you can partake directly of the tree of
[1:01:31] life
[1:01:32] oh my that this is just as much to do
[1:01:36] with the coming uh of the lord as the
[1:01:38] dead saints rising
[1:01:41] i'll say that again what i'm preaching
[1:01:43] on
[1:01:44] today
[1:01:45] is just as much a part of the coming of
[1:01:47] the lord it's just as much a part of
[1:01:50] that coming
[1:01:51] as as the dead saints rising out of the
[1:01:54] ground
[1:01:55] you're you're
[1:01:56] if you're missing any part of it you're
[1:01:58] never going to get to see that dead
[1:02:00] saints rising if this part isn't in your
[1:02:02] life remember there'll be a very very
[1:02:06] few at that time there be
[1:02:09] one of the places there'll be very few
[1:02:10] make that rapture i want to make it
[1:02:12] friends
[1:02:13] i'm in it to win it i'm in it to win the
[1:02:16] prize i'm running this race that's the
[1:02:18] reason i'm running see
[1:02:20] amen stand to your feet with me god
[1:02:22] bless you this morning we'll stop right
[1:02:24] there
[1:02:25] amen that's as far as i needed to get
[1:02:27] and we'll carry on
[1:02:29] um
[1:02:30] next service so
[1:02:32] i want you just to bow your heads with
[1:02:34] me all over the building we don't want
[1:02:35] to
[1:02:36] switch preachers up here till i've given
[1:02:38] you an opportunity
[1:02:39] to have your heart humble before the
[1:02:41] lord just something tender brother
[1:02:43] andrew
[1:02:45] with all your heads bowed now
[1:02:48] father
[1:02:50] a rushed and
[1:02:51] hurried lesson today but
[1:02:54] it was an important lesson
[1:02:56] and and i know that you know all things
[1:02:58] and i know that you
[1:03:01] you caused lord your people to come to
[1:03:03] your
[1:03:04] fountain you caused them lord to keep
[1:03:06] your statutes that was your promise to
[1:03:08] ezekiel i'll put my spirit in them and i
[1:03:11] will cause them to keep my word
[1:03:14] i'll cause them to keep my statutes i'll
[1:03:16] cause them to do it
[1:03:18] lord today we all confess that we're
[1:03:20] weak mortals and we need the cause of
[1:03:22] the holy spirit to come upon us
[1:03:24] lord i raise up my hands and i realize
[1:03:27] that that father while we're looking for
[1:03:30] the dynamics of power and miracles and
[1:03:32] great signs that's not going to change
[1:03:34] the world
[1:03:35] that was just something you did
[1:03:36] privately you had already spent a life
[1:03:38] of doing miracles lord it hadn't changed
[1:03:40] israel it hadn't brought them to
[1:03:42] national repentance you you came in our
[1:03:44] day you went around the world seven
[1:03:46] times over three three decades that
[1:03:48] didn't bring the world to national
[1:03:49] repentance it only has gotten worse
[1:03:52] but lord in gethsemane that was a
[1:03:54] private time that was you and your
[1:03:55] disciples there's where you demonstrated
[1:03:58] you still had power to heal oh yes
[1:04:01] you still had power for deliverance you
[1:04:03] could have called for 12 legions of
[1:04:04] angels you still had power
[1:04:07] right before it was over right near the
[1:04:09] finish line you were still in full
[1:04:12] possession of
[1:04:13] power to redeem the lost
[1:04:16] and a dying thief
[1:04:18] said lord remember me and you said today
[1:04:21] you'll be with me
[1:04:23] so lord it's not that we're lacking a
[1:04:25] power but in the
[1:04:26] in the expectation of power
[1:04:29] that's so easy human beings tend to that
[1:04:32] they love sensationalism we're built
[1:04:34] that way but lord what about gethsemane
[1:04:37] what about the surrender of our will in
[1:04:39] gethsemane what about the surrender on
[1:04:42] the cross when you said father into thy
[1:04:45] hands i commend my spirit
[1:04:48] that's part of the that's part of the
[1:04:50] coming that's part of the restoration
