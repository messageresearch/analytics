[Music] [Music] [Music] first john chapter 2. we'll just begin reading that verse we'll just start here verse 18. amen god bless you good to be here in sunday school this morning i'd like to speak and teach on the antichrist spirit at work that's my title for today the antichrist spirit at work little children it is the last time and as you have heard the antichrist spirit shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time first john 4 verse 1. just turn two chapters over there one more scripture beloved believe not every spirit now this is tied in in conjunction with the scripture we just read little children it's the last time you've heard the antichrist shall come but even now there are many antichrists now listen to his his word here in verse 1. beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know you the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world you can be seated we're going to have some quotes here we'll save just for a moment we read just two scriptures but if you go through your bible and you study your bible you'll see a character in the bible who emerges uh constantly and he's called by different names but it's referring to the same individual and it's a person and we speak of a spirit that's what we're teaching on this morning but we first want to identify the person of that spirit so he's called in one place the son of the morning another the son of perdition another the prince of darkness and another the man of sin these are what he's this some of the titles that he's uh referred to and the book of revelation especially covers and speaks a lot about this individual and he's uh mystified in a lot of people's minds and there's been a lot of uh movies made about him and a lot of conspiracy about the antichrist spirit and it sort of falls and people sometimes lump those things into that category of uh people who are uh you know end time prophets of doom and gloom and destruction and conspiracy and it sort of all falls in that same exact category and so as as christians we have to be careful that we don't lose interest in what the the biblical teaching of what the spirit of christ and the spirit of antichrist is just because it's been polarized are misused by people and so the book of revelation reveals excuse me i'm very congested this morning that this man has had a huge part to play in the world and the history of the world and the entire framework of the world in fact this man was at the very beginning of of your bible you read in in the book of genesis we believe that jesus christ is living today we believe he's a real person now we know that we have the spirit the bible says you have the spirit of christ in your heart and that's why you cry abba father so we know that we have the spirit of christ living inside of us but just as much as there's the spirit of christ that dwells in you jesus is also a real person a real actual person and when we meet him that day we won't meet a spirit or a spirit that lives within us but we'll meet the real man christ jesus just as much as we believe that today there's a real person named the devil but if there's a person named the devil then there's also the spirit of the devil so if you have christ who's a real person and then this spirit that lives and works in the world and has been working since the new testament church since this day of pentecost then also we must realize that there's a spirit of the devil spirit of christ and a spirit of antichrist galatians 4 6 you don't need to turn wit because you are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father so that spirit that's at work in the world the antichrist is a spirit and just as much as christ has given us the spirit and enable that spirit enables us to do what we do as christians to live a christian life that's the only way you can live a christian life is the spirit of christ anything outside of that is false and manufactured but the true true uh life of christ is by is led as lived by a spirit the same exact way that what operates in the world today to accomplish the purpose of the antichrist is a spirit that gets on people and it gets on churches and it gets in politics and it gets in religion and we have to be very careful that we always try the spirits as first john said beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits because spirits are real and spirits are influential and spirits change your mind and they view they change your entire perception so we should always be aware that there's a spirit of christ that's at work in our lives and there's also a spirit of the antichrist at work in the world i'm just going to read it again this is that spirit of antichrist wherever you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world and so the antichrist what we realize because people have looked at it as a man and the bible speaks of the man of sin that that that actual substantive person of satan incarnate uh they're looking for that man of sin to be revealed but what they miss is that the antichrist is not going to suddenly appear one day but he's on the scene right now in the form of a spirit and his spirit is mysteriously working setting up his kingdom and you say brother matt where is he setting up his kingdom in the hearts of cold lukewarm make believers that's where his kingdom is built in religion and so when the man of sin is revealed publicly just as when christ when all eyes shall see him and behold him when he's revealed publicly the hearts of of his people of the world the children of disobedience have already been prepared to receive him that's why they accept him because their hearts are already being prepared now and they don't even realize it the world doesn't even realize that they're that things uh in this world very real things very things that we interact with daily are being used by the spirit of antichrist to prepare the hearts of people paul warned of this and he said that in the last days false prophets would infiltrate the church remember brother bannon preaches the message the invasion of the united states and he's not talking about an army physical army or communism but he's talking about the spirit of antichrist invading the united states and paul says that false prophets would infiltrate the church preaching another gospel so what is his doctrine what is what is his purpose is it uh you know where where do we it's important that we identify where it's at it's a religion it's a false religion but it's a religion and it's it's it's it's uh it's mixed in with with uh with the church and so he said it would infiltrate the church preaching another gospel another jesus many such false prophets uh let me just read this here is paul speaking it says let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called god or that is worshipped so that he as god sitteth in the temple of god showing himself that he is god so what is the spirit of antichrist doing it's opposing not the church it's not opposing religion the devil doesn't oppose religion he's not against church at all he's not against you saying you're a christian against people saying they're a christian or a christian nation we're a christian nation we're founded on christian principles judeo christian that the devil loves that loves it because it's it's his form of deception so he's not opposing religion he doesn't oppose religious music worship music he doesn't oppose religious christian gatherings he has no problem with that he loves that he doesn't oppose church growth he loves it he doesn't oppose churches mega churches getting bigger and larger and larger you think the devil's warring against that no it's the very foundation and framework that he's built and worked on since the garden of eden and now it's in its glory and so it says he opposes then exalteth himself above all that is called god or that is worshipped listen to some of this because i want to make sure we get to it we don't miss it um some of these quotes if you could just have that ready just for a moment and so we see that in genesis 3 15 there's a reference made the first reference made to the serpent seed and that doctrine is what we believe on the original sin and the serpent seed is not what we're referring to today but it's speaking about the you you'll find in genesis 3 15 a reference made to the serpent seed that uh that seed that beginning was what we're speaking about when we say a spirit that would oppose the spirit of god and so it was in opposition to the seed of god it was the spirit of anti of the antichrist in the very beginning in the garden of eden that spoke to eve that was the spirit of antichrist opposing the whole word of god now listen to this very closely that's that serpent that was speaking to eve was the spirit of antichrist in a beast trying to uh trying to and notice what he was challenging not the word but the whole complete word of god so what is the devil against but the bible says just add one word or take one word away so to not believe every word of god is death spiritual death to take 99 of it and leave out one percent is the spirit of antichrist and so it was in that spirit trying to question the authority the absolute authority of the whole word of god given to adam and eve in the garden it was that same spirit that spoken the beast to eve was the same spirit that was in cain opposing the revelation of the only god's only provided way of worship it was the same spirit that was in cain that killed his brother abel and opposed abel's sacrifice and his worship and brother branham says that spirit has followed the seed of god that false church and true church like two vines and he said like intermingled twined all throughout the biblical record and all throughout history it always follows that seed and so if it followed at the beginning you can guarantee it's following the true church today and so that spirit is always following that seed and always it always has a mission to not reject you see the devil is much more interested in getting to corrupt your understanding of the word of god he's much more interested in corrupting the church and what we believe than doing away with it he's much more interested in keeping it but corrupting what you believe and so he's always attempting to pervert it or brother branham would call it high bread hybrid religion and he's always attempting to take what's pure and hybrid it to lead people to influence lives and to destroy the holy spirit that's working in the church what is the devil's number one goal to destroy the holy spirit in the church he doesn't want to destroy the church he doesn't want to destroy the framework he just wants to remove the spirit of god out of it listen to some of these i'm going to read them now brother getting if you put that up the powerpoint that we had maybe the screen's not on i don't know no the screen's not on i can see it it's on okay good i'm okay the devil ain't gonna win we're gonna read it and so we see this it goes all the way just as they're pulling that up in revelation in this in the book of revelation chapter two uh and actually in chapter two and in chapter three uh there's a revealing of that spirit that's in the it's been at work in the church in the age of ephesus you'll read in the book of revelations chapter two we'll get that in a second in the in the book of ephesus in the book of revelation that spirit in the first church age this the ephesian church age the bible speaks about false prophets and and deeds let's just read it in revelations chapter 2 you can just turn in your bible revelations 2 chapter 2 unto the angel of the church of ephesus right these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i know thy works this is revelations 2 for those of you turning i know thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou can not bear them which are evil now has tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars and has borne in his patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless i have somewhat against him because thou has left thy first love remember therefore from where thou art fallen and repent do the first works or else i will come quickly and remove that candlestick notice verse 6 but this thou has that thou hate the deeds the deeds so notice that important word here if you go through your church age book you'll remember brother brandon points at this and says this is the beginning of the antichrist spirit it this is where it starts before it's a false prophet crowned in a before it's crowned than a false prophet it starts as a saying remember stars is just the saying in the church and then it moves from a saiyan to deeds and then it moves from deeds i think to works and then into a doctrine and then it's the and then it's the irrefutable uh uncompromisable unnegotiable that's what they call it then they call the unnegotiables that's what our church's big mega churches here in town preaches today the unnegotiables of the faith and nothing against the man or the pastor but the spirit that they're under is the spirit of revelations chapter 16 when it speaks of the the three evil spirits that went out of the mouth of the dragon that's revelation 16 13 and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet where did this come from rome it came from romans the spirit of the antichrist that would create a doctrine called the trinity that would lock and bind all denominations though they not don't agree on much they agree on this one thing it's an unnegotiable and this is what it is in revelation 16 it's spoken of and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet so it's it's it's an it's it starts with a saying and then it's given a doctrine then it's unnegotiable doctrine then it's crowned in a false prophet and so we see it here as deeds in the beginning this is just the beginning in ephesus remember when the church falls away starts to fall away as in ephesus goes through seven church ages till it's restored in this last age through a vindicated prophet i'm glad we we have received a vindicated prophet to restore to us the original faith but in ephesus it's the beginning the deeds of the nicolaitans and it rises out of the church so important and it's remember it's just a perversion to to pervert the true gospel as just as satan did in the beginning he tried to pervert the true gospel to eve now he's perverting it through a doctrine the deeds and the second age smyrna and we won't take time to read it but in smyrna it speaks of the synagogue of satan so notice how it moves from deeds to now it's a church now it's a temple now it's a synagogue now it's in the church the synagogue of satan and so it's the beginning the forming and that submergent age satan now has a building natalie has a framework now that's more than a saying more than a deed corrupting through through through doctrine but now he's got a sin now that's the synagogue of satan it's the spirit of brother adam says within the framework of the true christian church there's two spirits within the framework of the church is two spirits the false false vine and the true vine judas and jesus jacob and esau twins cain and abel all throughout all the way till now listen to what brother adam says here i'm just going to read these and it's not this isn't working so if you can just advance the slide here's what it is listen this is in three witnesses in 1951 here's what it is the antichrist spirit is not the communistic spirit the antichrist spirit is a religious spirit go on demonology religious realm in 1953. you see what i mean about demons they are working they are very religious just as religious oh they go to church every sunday and they don't stop at bethel tabernacle no they come right in this building trying to influence the true church what what what why waste your time on a deceived church down the road why waste your time on deceived people and deceived churches that are already in the system but the spirit of antichrist comes to attack the true church and the true seed trying always to remove the spirit of god why do you think sometimes it's so hard and you feel that cold spirit or dead spirit always trying to creep into the church you think that's the spirit of christ no that's why we fight against it that's why we stand against it that's why we just keep singing even if we don't feel like keeping on singing that's why we just keep on worshiping even when we don't feel like it because we know that though we don't feel like it the spirit of christ in us wants to worship the lord he says they go to church every sunday let's go and let's move on uh to the next slide there brother branham you mean that's the truth that's the kind of spirit that brother madam says that's the kind of spirit that hung jesus christ to the cross what kind of spirit a religious spirit and jesus said you're of your father the devil keep going a little faster now now some of them said oh russia's the antichrist never russia is not the antichrist the antichrist is going to be so religious it will fool the very elect if possible next remember god takes his men but never spirit the devil takes his man but never his spirit now there they are suit yourself i'm only responsible for the truth this is the invasion of the united states 1954. don't you see how religious the devil is the devil is not no anti-great big thing like communism all against christianity that's not that's of oh well well of the devil sure but it's not the antichrist the antichrist is very religious very religious it was a religion it was a religious spirit that crucified jesus it's always been a religious world a religious people that crucifies it's the religious people that was against the true christ it was the religious prophets that was against maika it's the religious people of the day that's against the message of god you want to know who opposes what we believe religion religious people keep going that's fine and the mark of the and this is the junction of time 1956 and the mark of the antichrist is to reject that holy ghost so simple my goodness what that's it after all this build up and all this teaching and all the antichrist and we're going to expose him we're going to reveal him and where's he at for the man let's find him let's play a video let's let's get into somewhere in the news or somewhere in the media somewhere in washington the mark of the antichrist is to reject the holy ghost just that simple and you don't reject it by saying i don't want it you don't reject it by saying i don't believe in it you don't reject the holy ghost listen friends it's not those who don't the antichrist is not not having the holy ghost you may not have the holy spirit you may never been born again born of the spirit of god by the baptism of the holy ghost we have a church and there's in a church there's people who are born of the spirit there's some living in justification who've never went to sanctification some have went to sanctification has never went to the filling of the holy ghost that's a fact and they're not just young some of them are old some of them are middle aged doesn't matter what your age is so it the antichrist is not not having the holy ghost it's rejecting the holy ghost and then rejecting it reject it and say i don't want it i don't believe in it i don't accept it it's it's rejecting the holy ghost it's simply not valuing or not putting importance or explaining away or saying it's not necessary that's rejecting the holy ghost why do you think that there would be this spirit that comes around the church that says oh we just been preaching on the holy ghost for years and get the holy ghost and get the holy ghost let's just move on beyond that hold on a minute let's not move on beyond that you can't move beyond that and the mark of the antichrist is to reject that holy ghost which you're sealed outside of the kingdom forever with no no way that will ever be forgiven the seal of god is the baptism of the holy ghost and the mark of the antichrist is to deny it now you're marked one way or the other don't you want to have the holy ghost today next slide that's it let's stand to our feet we're out of time lit when just a little bit over time but i'm leading worship today so that's all right lord we thank you for this morning's teaching lord we didn't we didn't father have any agenda or any purpose in our heart lord just other than just to be pleasing to you it's what you laid upon my heart this morning i pray father that you would bless it those that heard it here those that will hear it by archive or those that listen live we pray lord that you bless it because it's your word father in your words a seed and we believe when it's planted on good ground it brings forth what you intended bless the music the worship the remaining of this service in jesus name amen
