[0:48] good morning everyone god bless you
[0:51] let's stand
[0:56] heavenly father we just come to you and
[0:57] we ask that your holy spirit would come
[0:59] and be the teacher in our hearts today
[1:01] lord just pour your spirit out upon us
[1:04] and
[1:06] teach us of thy word and draw us closer
[1:09] to you we ask you jesus
[1:12] we're going to continue on part 3 of the
[1:14] priesthood of all believers
[1:16] and i'm going to start with the
[1:18] scripture first peter
[1:19] 2 verse 5.
[1:25] he also as lively stones are built up a
[1:28] spiritual house
[1:30] a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:32] sacrifices
[1:34] acceptable to god by jesus christ amen
[1:37] and then verse nine
[1:39] but you are a chosen generation a royal
[1:41] priesthood
[1:42] a holy nation of peculiar people that
[1:44] you should show forth the praises of him
[1:47] who have called you out of darkness into
[1:50] his marvelous
[1:52] light lord
[1:59] finishing up this series on the
[2:02] priesthood of all believers i want to
[2:04] answer the question
[2:05] why we are all priests and then secondly
[2:09] what are we to accomplish as priests
[2:13] amen
[2:14] so obviously it's clear from the
[2:16] scriptures we've just read
[2:18] it's there's not a there's not a holy
[2:20] priesthood order
[2:22] and then a lay of people order
[2:26] we're all spiritual priests amen
[2:29] we're all called to opera spiritual
[2:31] sacrifices
[2:34] we're all called to be in the priestly
[2:37] order
[2:38] so why are we priests under the new
[2:40] covenant number one
[2:42] the blood of christ was shed once for
[2:44] all
[2:45] we don't we don't have any need of a
[2:46] continual
[2:48] sacrifice over and over again every year
[2:51] throughout the year anytime we sin we
[2:54] don't have any need
[2:55] for that continual sacrifice that's all
[2:57] been finished and accomplished
[2:59] by jesus christ two under the new
[3:03] covenant
[3:04] it's not an outward teacher
[3:07] under the old covenant we have the two
[3:09] distinctions on the old covenant there's
[3:11] an outer teacher
[3:13] an outer mediatorship an outer
[3:16] intercessor saying know the lord under
[3:19] the new covenant
[3:21] there's an inside teacher amen that
[3:24] comes inside of you
[3:26] that teaches you personally to know the
[3:28] lord
[3:29] apart from any uh amen amen
[3:36] we'll talk more about that in detail in
[3:38] a moment three
[3:40] we are all called to ministry the
[3:42] priesthood is a ministry
[3:43] yeah so we're all called to ministry
[3:45] through the spirit
[3:47] dwelling within us four the true church
[3:51] is an invisible
[3:52] mystical body of christ we'll talk about
[3:55] that later
[3:56] there's a visible church amen us
[3:58] gathering here
[4:00] in this place is a visible church to
[4:02] other people around the world there's
[4:04] a catholic church a baptist church a
[4:06] methodist church
[4:08] a pentecostal church that's a visible
[4:12] church but that's not the same thing as
[4:14] the true church
[4:15] the true church is invisible it's
[4:18] mystical why because it's only made up
[4:21] of those who are filled with the spirit
[4:23] who are part of the body
[4:25] of christ amen number five is we are all
[4:28] equal
[4:30] in christ so let's get looking at us
[4:33] we've already covered the blood of
[4:35] christ was shed once for all
[4:36] in that aspect of the priesthood so
[4:39] let's look at jeremiah 31
[4:43] 31-34
[4:47] we're gonna have to you're gonna have to
[4:48] go old school we don't have the
[4:50] scriptures up yet
[4:51] just had some technical difficulties
[4:54] this morning
[4:55] so jeremiah 31 verse 31
[5:00] behold the days come saith the lord that
[5:02] i will make a new covenant
[5:03] in the house of israel and the house of
[5:06] judah
[5:08] not according to the covenant that i
[5:09] made with their fathers and the day that
[5:11] i took them by the hand
[5:13] to bring them out of the land of egypt
[5:14] which my covenant they break
[5:17] although i was a husband unto them save
[5:19] the lord
[5:20] but this shall be the covenant i will
[5:22] make with the house of israel
[5:24] after those days saith the lord i will
[5:27] put my law in their inward parts
[5:29] and write it in their hearts and will be
[5:31] their god and they shall be my people
[5:33] and they shall teach no more every man
[5:36] his neighbor
[5:37] and every man his brother saying know
[5:39] the lord
[5:40] for they shall all know me from the
[5:42] least of them unto the greatest of them
[5:44] saith the lord for i will forgive their
[5:46] iniquity
[5:47] and i will remember their sin no more
[5:50] of course we remember we understand
[5:52] through reading the book
[5:53] of hebrews that in hebrews
[5:57] we see that if there's a new covenant
[5:59] there's a new priesthood
[6:01] there's a new sacrifice for sin and that
[6:04] high priest is jesus christ and we have
[6:07] one mediator
[6:09] between us and god and that's jesus
[6:11] christ
[6:12] all right amen but there's something
[6:15] else
[6:15] different going on here there is now an
[6:18] inward work
[6:19] they shall teach no more every man his
[6:22] neighbor
[6:23] now this is not meaning that there's not
[6:26] an office of teacher pastor
[6:29] prophet et cetera that is necessary
[6:34] however that isn't the primary means
[6:37] of god getting to you under the new
[6:39] covenant
[6:40] that is no longer the primary means
[6:42] under the old covenant
[6:43] that was the only means the bible said
[6:47] they told they were told you circumcise
[6:50] your heart
[6:50] someone came read the bible to them they
[6:53] listened to it they became convicted
[6:55] under the new covenant it's different
[6:58] it's diff it's completely different
[7:00] now god himself is coming to you
[7:04] and teaching you let's break that down
[7:06] for a second what does that mean
[7:09] revelation what is the foundation that
[7:12] the church is built upon
[7:14] revelation what is the church and
[7:17] expression of
[7:18] the new covenant so put those two things
[7:21] together
[7:22] the teacher now is inward he says i'll
[7:25] send the spirit of truth
[7:27] who will lead you into all truth brother
[7:30] branham picks that scripture out and
[7:31] says
[7:32] you see that's the evidence of the holy
[7:34] spirit receiving the word
[7:36] for your day right so what is the
[7:39] evidence
[7:40] of being a partaker of the new covenant
[7:43] god is writing his word in your heart
[7:47] not just the word for another age but
[7:49] the word for
[7:51] today that portion of the word which is
[7:55] allotted
[7:56] for today which is the full word the
[7:59] full restoration of the word so he's
[8:01] taking his by the spirit and writing
[8:04] that
[8:04] word in our hearts is there teachers
[8:06] yeah
[8:07] i'd be out of a job if we took this
[8:09] scripture
[8:10] incorrectly right and and if if we took
[8:13] it
[8:14] if that's what it meant there's no more
[8:15] teachers then we all just sit down
[8:18] we don't we don't have a five-fold
[8:20] ministry we don't even play tapes
[8:23] right so we don't we wouldn't do any of
[8:25] that those things
[8:27] so the reality is yes there is teachers
[8:30] there is a
[8:31] there is a ministry but we are all part
[8:34] of it
[8:35] it's one body and all gifts differ
[8:39] again we i've said this before and we
[8:41] all do this
[8:43] and it's not necessarily completely
[8:46] wrong
[8:46] but we talk about the ministry and the
[8:48] lay people however
[8:51] however we are all called to ministry
[8:55] we've talked about that in ephesians 4
[8:58] ministry for the equipping of the saints
[9:01] for the work of the ministry
[9:02] that's the job of the preachers is to
[9:05] equip or dress
[9:06] the saints for what the work
[9:10] of the ministry so all saints are called
[9:13] to
[9:13] be ministers of jesus christ
[9:17] all right so i'm skipping around here
[9:19] but every man
[9:20] we won't we have an inner teacher under
[9:23] the new covenant
[9:24] god himself is to come and teach us
[9:26] personally
[9:29] he's writing the word directly
[9:32] in our hearts not
[9:36] not through mediators
[9:40] not through a holy priesthood but in
[9:43] your
[9:44] soul directly personally if you don't
[9:47] have
[9:48] that the spirit of god dwelling in your
[9:51] soul
[9:51] writing the word right there
[9:55] then you're not a part of the new
[9:56] covenant you have to have
[10:00] the inward teacher something that god
[10:03] is doing personally directly in your
[10:06] heart
[10:06] it's not enough to send sit under
[10:10] a good minister you're under the old
[10:12] covenant still
[10:14] you've got to come under the new
[10:16] covenant so that god himself
[10:19] in the secret place is writing the word
[10:22] in your heart amen
[10:25] that's why it's not enough to have a
[10:27] relationship
[10:28] with a church or a pastor they had that
[10:32] under the old covenant
[10:34] and we found what what what did we find
[10:35] under the old covenant
[10:37] that wasn't good enough the old covenant
[10:41] proved we were sinners that we were all
[10:44] sold out
[10:45] completely under sin so it's not going
[10:48] to be good enough just to have an
[10:50] outward person standing behind a pulpit
[10:54] teaching you the word of god that's not
[10:56] going to be effective under the new
[10:58] covenant the new covenant is
[11:00] god himself comes down from heaven
[11:04] takes a portion of himself enters into
[11:06] the soul of man
[11:08] takes over the control tower and begins
[11:11] to write that
[11:12] word in your heart personally
[11:16] otherwise you're dead i'm dead
[11:19] apart from that you say i go to brother
[11:22] donnie's church i go to brother i listen
[11:24] to brother donnie every week
[11:27] i listen to brother paul lafontaine
[11:30] every week
[11:31] sorry that doesn't that's not going to
[11:33] get it done
[11:35] now of course these brothers are point
[11:36] pointing you to the baptism of the holy
[11:38] ghost
[11:39] but it isn't just enough to look at the
[11:41] sign
[11:42] you've got to go to the destination you
[11:45] have to have the holy spirit yourself
[11:47] that's leading you teaching you guiding
[11:49] you correcting you
[11:51] not just someone going to someone else
[11:53] and say hey what should i do about this
[11:55] situation
[11:56] oh do this and this and this
[11:59] no you have to have something on the
[12:00] inside i'm not speaking against
[12:03] getting getting people's opinions and
[12:06] thoughts but that's what it is
[12:08] opinions and thoughts we are we need to
[12:10] have the mind of christ
[12:12] and be personally led by him
[12:19] first corinthians 12 7
[12:23] but the manifestation of the spirit is
[12:25] given to every man
[12:26] to profit with all the word profit with
[12:30] all it
[12:30] simply means the common good or the
[12:32] common
[12:34] benefit so think about this the
[12:37] manifestation of the spirit
[12:40] is given to every single person every
[12:44] member of the body of christ
[12:47] to do what for the common benefit of
[12:50] everyone
[12:51] in other words it's not just for your
[12:53] benefit you've
[12:54] been given the spirit of god to benefit
[12:58] other people and he wants to manifest
[13:00] himself
[13:01] through your life and the gift that he's
[13:03] placed in your life
[13:06] for his glory now again we understand
[13:09] gifts can get the gifts of the spirit
[13:11] when we're talking about the nine gifts
[13:12] of the spirit
[13:13] you can operate one one time and then
[13:16] never operate it again in your life then
[13:17] you might operate another one
[13:19] goes that's not the same that's not a uh
[13:21] the gift
[13:23] when i first ran into missions work that
[13:25] was one thing misunderstanding
[13:26] now what give what of the which one of
[13:28] the nine gifts of he uh do you have
[13:30] do you have the gift of healing do you
[13:32] have the gift of this i said i have
[13:33] access to the spirit of god which means
[13:36] i have access to every gift whenever he
[13:39] wants to operate them the way
[13:41] he desires to he can amen
[13:44] and each of us each of us it's the same
[13:48] that's not just for the preacher the
[13:50] missionary
[13:51] that's for every single believer
[13:55] man woman young person that has
[13:59] been filled with the spirit of god now
[14:01] if you haven't been filled with the
[14:02] spirit of god
[14:03] then you're not subject to the gifts of
[14:05] the spirit
[14:07] then you don't have the manifestation of
[14:08] the spirit in your life so
[14:11] get it get that inside teacher
[14:14] then you'll have the manifestation of
[14:16] the spirit for
[14:17] for the common good so again it's a
[14:21] spiritual
[14:22] priesthood ministry to represent
[14:26] god before a dying world amen
[14:29] that's the reality of what we are called
[14:32] to
[14:33] so let's look at this ministry brother
[14:35] branham speaks of this ministry
[14:37] of worship to god
[14:40] this is from the ephesian church age
[14:44] in the church ages book paul saw it
[14:47] coming but he warned them
[14:49] about this subtle priesthood that would
[14:51] come
[14:52] and take over with false doctrines he
[14:55] knew they would implement a way of
[14:56] worship that excluded
[14:58] the people from any part in a holy
[15:01] spirit
[15:02] ministry wow and even right today among
[15:07] those who claim to be free and full of
[15:10] the spirit
[15:11] there is not too much freedom in the
[15:13] laity
[15:15] and the best we can see is a few
[15:18] preachers with inspired preaching while
[15:19] the flock just sits there
[15:21] and tries to absorb that does that
[15:27] that hits home a little bit right there
[15:30] this is a far cry from paul who said
[15:32] that when all came together
[15:34] all had the leading of the spirit and
[15:36] all participated
[15:38] in spiritual worship i want you to look
[15:40] at that all participated
[15:42] in spiritual worship as the spirit gave
[15:46] utterance
[15:48] and the church corporate has never
[15:50] learned this lesson from the scripture
[15:52] nor from history every time god gives a
[15:55] visitation of the holy spirit and people
[15:57] get free
[15:58] after a while they bind themselves right
[16:00] back to the very thing they came out of
[16:03] when luther came out of catholicism the
[16:05] people stayed free for a while
[16:07] but when he died the people simply
[16:09] organized what they thought he believed
[16:11] and set up their own creeds and ideas
[16:14] and repudiated anyone who said opposite
[16:16] to what they said
[16:18] they went right back to catholicism with
[16:20] a little different
[16:21] form and right today many lutherans are
[16:24] ready to go all the way back
[16:27] oh yes in revelation 17 that old
[16:29] had many daughters
[16:30] these daughters are just like mother
[16:32] they set the word aside
[16:34] deny the work of the spirit of god
[16:36] subjugate the laity
[16:38] and make it possible for the laity to
[16:40] worship god
[16:42] make it impossible for the laity to
[16:44] worship god unless they come through
[16:46] them
[16:47] or through their pattern which is
[16:49] nothing but a blueprint
[16:50] of unbelief from satan himself
[16:56] i want to go back to that
[16:59] quote it just really struck me that
[17:01] portion of the quote
[17:03] he knew that they would implement a way
[17:05] of worship
[17:06] that excluded the people from any part
[17:09] in a holy spirit ministry
[17:11] and even right today among those who
[17:13] claim to be free
[17:14] and full of the spirit there is not too
[17:16] much freedom in the laity
[17:18] and the best we can see is a few
[17:20] preachers with inspired preaching
[17:22] while the flock just sits there and
[17:23] tries to
[17:25] absorb it this is a far cry from paul
[17:28] who said that when all came together
[17:30] all had the leading of the spirit and
[17:32] all participated in spiritual
[17:34] worship
[17:39] when we come together what is our
[17:40] expectation what is in our heart
[17:43] is our expectation that we just bought
[17:45] tickets to the football game only this
[17:47] is
[17:47] a sanctified version we're coming to be
[17:51] see what happens instead of participate
[17:54] in the spirit there's a big difference
[17:57] there's a big difference we're not
[17:59] called to be spectators on a seat
[18:02] we're called to operate in the spirit of
[18:04] god but we come
[18:05] expecting what to sit
[18:10] not to not we're not even listening for
[18:13] god to guide us
[18:14] we're not even asking lead us and direct
[18:17] me
[18:18] give me a word that would be an
[18:19] encouragement that doesn't mean you have
[18:20] to come up and say it here
[18:22] it might be you say it afterwards but
[18:25] don't
[18:25] come to church as a spectator this isn't
[18:29] a sanctified version of a basketball
[18:31] game
[18:34] you are to participate and be a part of
[18:36] this why because the manifestation of
[18:38] the spirit is given
[18:39] to every man and that means mankind not
[18:42] just
[18:43] males every man to profit with all
[18:48] it's for the common good
[18:52] we would see jesus brother branham 1958
[18:55] says then the church
[18:56] is in this building the church is not a
[18:58] building anyhow
[19:00] it's a people a called out the word
[19:02] church means called out and so we are
[19:04] the people of god
[19:05] by the grace of god the called out
[19:07] tonight that's assembled ourselves
[19:08] together in this
[19:10] place in five definite
[19:13] identifications of the true church of
[19:15] the living god
[19:16] in 1960 he says the messianic empire
[19:19] therefore
[19:20] the church is not an organization the
[19:22] church is not a gathering
[19:24] of people the church is the people of
[19:26] god that's been called out of the world
[19:28] to serve
[19:30] in another kingdom amen to serve in
[19:33] another kingdom
[19:35] in the pergamon church age brother
[19:37] branham says you will recall that i
[19:39] brought out in the ephesian age that the
[19:41] word nicolaitan comes from the two greek
[19:43] words
[19:44] nikao which means to conquer and lao
[19:47] which means the laity
[19:48] nicolaitan means to conquer the laity
[19:51] now why is this such a terrible thing
[19:54] it is terrible because god has never
[19:56] placed his church in the hands of an
[19:58] elected leadership
[19:59] which moves with political mindedness
[20:03] amen he has placed his church in the
[20:06] care of god
[20:07] ordained spirit-filled word living men
[20:10] who lead the people through feeding them
[20:12] the word did you
[20:14] did you hear that how are we to lead the
[20:18] p how is the
[20:19] the preachers of the word to lead the
[20:21] people by force
[20:23] by manipulation by saying uh
[20:26] brother mark you can't go on vacation
[20:28] unless you ask me okay
[20:31] we laugh but that's a reality in
[20:34] so-called message churches but they're
[20:36] not message churches they're
[20:37] they're they're from another direction
[20:42] so how are we to lead the people
[20:46] through feeding them
[20:49] the word he's not separated the people
[20:52] into classes
[20:54] so that the masses are led by a holy
[20:57] priesthood that that's something we got
[20:58] to be careful about
[21:00] because that's the com that is the
[21:02] comfort
[21:04] of people we want to merely be led
[21:08] by some people that we can put
[21:10] confidence in
[21:13] that is not the new covenant that is not
[21:16] the gospel of christ
[21:18] that's organization that's the great
[21:22] and it's a spirit and even if you're not
[21:26] formally a denomination you can be under
[21:28] that same kind of spirit
[21:30] and that's why you see this
[21:32] nicolaitanism
[21:33] and it's it's frankly in in a way it's
[21:36] quite rampant
[21:38] around the message movement i i don't
[21:40] like saying the around the message
[21:42] because
[21:43] the message is jesus christ but around
[21:46] the message
[21:47] the people that have congregated around
[21:50] this message but yet have not learned it
[21:52] yet let's put it that way
[21:56] he's not separated the people into
[21:58] classes so that the masses
[22:01] are led by a holy priesthood it is true
[22:03] that the leadership must be holy but
[22:05] then so must
[22:06] be the whole congregation further
[22:08] there's no place in the word where
[22:09] priests or ministers or such
[22:11] mediate between god and the people nor
[22:14] is there a place where they are
[22:15] separated in their worship of the lord
[22:18] god wants all to love and serve him
[22:19] together nicolaitanism destroys those
[22:22] precepts and instead
[22:24] separates the ministers from the people
[22:26] and makes the leaders overlords
[22:28] instead of servants now this doctrine
[22:32] actually started as a deed in the first
[22:34] age we understand that is the
[22:36] white horse rider that's how it started
[22:40] in the beginning and this is such
[22:43] this is a danger for every believer that
[22:46] they
[22:47] they take the leadership that they
[22:50] should have
[22:51] from the holy spirit and place it on to
[22:56] someone else god uses people right
[22:59] he uses people he uses gifts of the
[23:02] spirit
[23:03] in my in my personal calling the lord
[23:06] used three different people in three
[23:07] different ways
[23:09] to speak to me about leaving my job and
[23:11] going
[23:12] into missions full-time but they didn't
[23:14] even know what they were doing
[23:16] they had no clue they were just being
[23:18] obedient to the lord
[23:21] and it was god's personal leadership
[23:24] to me and god can use and
[23:28] one of them was a minister and the other
[23:29] two were not our preacher i should say
[23:32] they were all ministers but only one of
[23:35] them was a preacher
[23:37] and so each of you
[23:40] god wants to use god wants to speak
[23:42] through god wants to use you to
[23:44] in in a different way that he's made you
[23:48] in order to accomplish his purpose
[23:52] right and it's not it's not that you've
[23:54] got to go through so and so to get your
[23:56] leadership of the holy spirit no
[23:58] you don't you go to god personally
[24:01] he can speak to you
[24:04] as easily as he can speak to me he can
[24:08] guide you
[24:09] as easily as he can speak guide your
[24:12] pastor
[24:13] that is a great difference between
[24:15] nicolaitanism
[24:17] and the true bride
[24:20] of christ now
[24:23] that doesn't mean that the lord doesn't
[24:26] call ministers to give you
[24:27] counsel but again you have to be led
[24:31] by the spirit of god
[24:34] we're all called to be in connection
[24:36] directly with him
[24:40] not in not not in connection
[24:43] through again that's this concept the
[24:46] priesthood of all believers
[24:48] you're all called to a ministry i'm just
[24:50] going to skip ahead because i've got to
[24:51] close
[24:52] i've got a ton more scriptures but i've
[24:55] covered the concepts
[24:57] so how are we priests we all have the
[25:00] spirit of god
[25:01] equally and personally
[25:05] equally and personally
[25:09] which empowers us to a ministry to the
[25:12] world
[25:13] in finding the lost sheep
[25:16] and edifying the body of christ
[25:20] it isn't just the preacher's job to go
[25:22] after the lost sheep
[25:24] it's each one of us do you have the
[25:26] spirit of christ
[25:28] the spirit of christ goes after the lost
[25:30] and the broken
[25:33] and the edifying of the body of christ
[25:36] the whole body
[25:37] every portion of the body is to build
[25:39] itself up
[25:41] in love not just a few
[25:44] holy priests to build you up holy
[25:47] five-fold ministry men
[25:48] put it that way in message terms to
[25:51] build up the people
[25:52] everybody is called
[25:55] to edify and build up the body of christ
[25:58] it's not a mediatorship for affecting
[26:02] a sacrifice for sins that's finished
[26:04] that's accomplished that's done
[26:06] there's only one mediator between god
[26:09] and men
[26:10] but you've heard of the term
[26:11] intercessory prayer
[26:13] that comes there from romans 8 i think
[26:16] 26
[26:17] and and 27 speaking about that
[26:20] but the spirit speaks with words that
[26:23] cannot be
[26:24] uttered to who to us
[26:27] it's to us so that we know how to pray
[26:31] the spirit is interceding right
[26:34] through who you every believer every
[26:38] part of the body of christ all of us
[26:41] are participants of this interceding by
[26:44] the spirit
[26:45] because ultimately what is it it's the
[26:47] spirit of god
[26:48] working in a body of people to build
[26:50] itself up in love
[26:52] and to find those lost sheep those pre
[26:55] those last predestinated seed
[26:57] that need to come in and that is not for
[27:01] a holy priesthood a holy ministry it's
[27:04] for
[27:05] the priesthood of all believers
[27:08] everyone has the spirit of god and
[27:11] everyone is called
[27:13] to affect ministry unto others
[27:16] let's stand and pray
[27:20] heavenly father we're so thankful for
[27:22] this high and holy calling which you've
[27:24] called
[27:25] every single spirit-filled believer to
[27:29] help us lord to see particularly what
[27:33] you would want us to do lord not
[27:35] not as though we have to have some great
[27:37] title
[27:38] or great position there's nothing to do
[27:40] with that
[27:41] it has everything to do with having a
[27:44] heart
[27:45] for the the lost the broken the hurting
[27:50] for our friends for those around us
[27:53] that we can truly by the holy spirit
[27:57] minister the word to them so that they
[28:00] themselves
[28:01] can enter into this priesthood
[28:05] lord thank you thank you for your love
[28:08] thank you for your leadership in our
[28:10] lives lord we commit
[28:11] the worship and the preaching of the
[28:14] word to you

[28:18] have full control and that you would
[28:19] speak
