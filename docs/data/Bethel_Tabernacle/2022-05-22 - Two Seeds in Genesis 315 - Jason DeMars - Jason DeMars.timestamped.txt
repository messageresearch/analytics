[2:12] morning everyone
[2:13] god bless you
[2:15] we can
[2:16] stand and pray and we'll read our
[2:18] scripture
[2:23] heavenly father we just come to you now
[2:24] lord and we're so thankful for your
[2:26] goodness
[2:27] for your mercy to us lord i just pray
[2:29] that you'd
[2:30] guide and direct our hearts in the word
[2:32] lord we pray that the anointing of the
[2:34] holy spirit would come upon each one of
[2:36] us lord that we would
[2:38] lord receive from you this morning
[2:41] keep your hand on us lord we
[2:43] we need you every every hour every
[2:45] moment
[2:48] so we're looking to you this morning we
[2:50] ask in jesus name amen
[2:52] amen god bless you i'm going to be
[2:54] speaking on
[2:56] serpent seed um
[2:59] looking at the two seeds in genesis 3 15
[3:03] and
[3:05] if you have the you have the powerpoint
[3:07] brother it should be in the email
[3:11] so we have a
[3:15] just to set the scene we have a strange
[3:17] story
[3:18] in the book of genesis about
[3:20] trees that can give eternal life or or
[3:23] death
[3:24] about a talking snake
[3:27] see something that seems somewhat
[3:30] incongruous and unusual
[3:33] based on
[3:34] uh a thorough
[3:36] reading of the entire scripture
[3:38] so let's with that in mind we'll read
[3:41] our opening scripture and we'll go from
[3:42] there genesis 1 26 and 27. as they're
[3:46] pulling up the power point i'm just
[3:47] going to go ahead and read if you want
[3:48] to grab that in your bibles
[3:52] and god said let us make man in our
[3:54] image after our likeness and let them
[3:56] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[3:58] and over the fowl of the air
[4:00] and over the cattle and over all the
[4:02] earth and over every creeping thing that
[4:04] creepeth upon the earth
[4:06] so god created man in his own image in
[4:08] the image of god created he him
[4:10] male and female created he them
[4:14] and verse 28 and god blessed them
[4:17] and god said unto them be fruitful and
[4:19] multiply and replenish the earth and
[4:21] subdue it and have dominion over the
[4:23] fish of the sea and over the fowl of the
[4:25] air and over every living thing that
[4:27] moveth upon the earth may the lord add
[4:29] the blessing to the reading of his word
[4:31] you can be seated
[4:35] so here we see god setting the
[4:39] setting the vision of what he has for
[4:44] his creation
[4:46] now this is of course
[4:47] the pinnacle you got it thank you
[4:50] i don't have control over it so you're
[4:51] just going to have to follow along
[4:54] the pinnacle of his creation is when he
[4:56] created man and here we understand he
[4:58] created them in spirit form
[5:00] understanding that potentially they were
[5:03] all they were going to be
[5:05] in bodily form but when he says make
[5:06] that when they're going to come after
[5:08] his own image his own likeness we
[5:10] understand that's in spirit form
[5:13] okay and so when man was to replenish
[5:15] himself he was to replenish himself
[5:19] after his own kind genesis 1
[5:22] 11-12
[5:25] so if you forward through that enough
[5:26] you'll get to that
[5:28] and god said let the earth bring forth
[5:30] grass the herb yielding seed and the
[5:32] fruit tree yielding fruit
[5:34] after his kind whose seed is in itself
[5:37] upon the earth
[5:38] and it was so and the earth brought
[5:40] forth grass
[5:41] and herb yielding seed after his kind
[5:44] and the tree yielding fruit whose seed
[5:46] was in itself after his kind and god saw
[5:49] that it was good this is god's
[5:51] principle of reproduction
[5:54] it's not just in trees and herbs
[5:58] of the garden it's in
[6:00] everything all life
[6:02] the seed is in itself
[6:04] and it's to come forth after it's kind
[6:07] so god made
[6:09] what did he what did he do he made
[6:11] something off of himself he made an
[6:12] offspring
[6:14] so if if he was
[6:16] god
[6:17] who is spirit he made a spirit
[6:20] being off of himself
[6:24] but even further than that
[6:27] what did he do he made someone with his
[6:29] nature
[6:31] right his characteristics
[6:32] they were man is supposed to be a
[6:35] reflection
[6:36] of god himself so when he says to
[6:38] multiply and replenish the earth
[6:41] god's vision isn't just multiply and
[6:43] replace punish human beings
[6:45] it's multiplying his own life
[6:48] on the earth all the other
[6:50] creation there's no there's no
[6:52] connection like this
[6:54] yes god god made them god has a purpose
[6:57] for all of them but only mankind did he
[7:00] say you're made in my image and likeness
[7:03] and being made in his image
[7:05] and likeness they have a special place a
[7:07] special purpose that was to reproduce
[7:10] god's own life
[7:12] little gods
[7:13] right
[7:15] little little elohim
[7:17] you know
[7:18] that sounds like a strange statement but
[7:20] if you understand
[7:22] you know to our modern
[7:24] way of thinking in theology to say man
[7:26] was made to be a little g.o.d first time
[7:30] i heard brother branham say it my brain
[7:32] went
[7:32] what
[7:33] coming from a background in theology
[7:36] but as you understand jewish history
[7:39] it's very clear that the term elohim
[7:41] doesn't only apply to yahweh
[7:45] there's lots of different
[7:47] orders of being that receive this title
[7:51] elohim even the angels themselves
[7:53] receive this title of elohim
[7:56] so
[7:56] them us us being made in his image would
[7:59] of course
[8:01] be an extension of him of his own life
[8:05] and we would be
[8:06] little gods
[8:08] perfectly scriptural so that was what
[8:10] just to reproduce in the earth we're
[8:12] going to keep this going so that the
[8:14] earth is filled up all the seed come
[8:16] forward and then god is all in all he's
[8:19] perfectly manifested on a perfect earth
[8:22] this is god's purpose and intention
[8:25] all right so but he said something there
[8:28] in genesis 2
[8:29] verse 9
[8:32] and out of the ground made the lord god
[8:34] to grow every tree
[8:36] that is pleasant to the sight and good
[8:38] for food the tree of life also in the
[8:41] midst of the garden
[8:42] and the tree of the knowledge of good
[8:45] and evil
[8:47] so let's
[8:49] let's let's comment on it this way
[8:51] scripture
[8:52] is to be taken literally
[8:54] okay we don't take a scripture and read
[8:57] it and say it's all figurative
[9:00] some scripture can be figurative
[9:02] and some and most scripture is literal
[9:05] how do we know the difference context
[9:09] the context tells us whether we take it
[9:10] literally or whether whether we take it
[9:12] figuratively and a huge thing to
[9:15] understand when we're looking at the
[9:16] book of genesis and a huge red flag is
[9:19] when people look at genesis as
[9:21] figurative and they take it and they say
[9:24] oh
[9:25] creation's not literal evolution is true
[9:28] and they'll take take it a million miles
[9:30] there wasn't a real adam and eve a
[9:32] literal adam and eve it's just a figure
[9:35] figurative for mankind and they go on
[9:37] and on and on and on about this
[9:40] dismissing the power and authority of
[9:43] scripture
[9:46] this is not
[9:47] our intent that wasn't brother branham's
[9:50] intent
[9:51] but we look at the scripture
[9:55] and i think it's very
[9:57] clear
[9:58] and easy to understand
[10:01] that this is
[10:02] allegorical for something
[10:04] it's not really clear without revelation
[10:08] what it is allegorical about
[10:11] but it's clear
[10:12] trees that are
[10:14] that are good for food we get that trees
[10:17] that are pleasant to the site that makes
[10:19] sense
[10:20] tree of life in the midst
[10:22] of the garden and tree of knowledge of
[10:25] good and evil what exactly would that be
[10:27] what kind of fruit would that produce
[10:30] why is it spoken of as being in the
[10:32] midst of the garden the other ones are
[10:34] pleasant to the site and good for food
[10:37] but this these ones are in the midst of
[10:39] the garden what does that mean
[10:41] what does that look like i'm not going
[10:42] to answer that right now i'm just
[10:44] sitting before you
[10:47] what is this what's what's happening
[10:49] here
[10:52] genesis 2 16-17 and the lord god
[10:55] commanded the man saying
[10:57] of every tree of the garden thou mayest
[10:59] freely eat
[11:01] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[11:02] and evil thou shalt not eat of it
[11:04] for in the day thou eatest thereof thou
[11:07] shalt surely die
[11:09] it is
[11:10] it should be a very strange scripture it
[11:14] should make us stop and say what's going
[11:16] on
[11:18] i'm just saying of course
[11:20] i'm looking at everybody here you're
[11:22] message believers you probably most of
[11:23] you grew up
[11:24] in the message it's not strange to you
[11:27] but i'm trying to bring this out to
[11:28] somebody that may not have
[11:30] heard it before or help you to be able
[11:33] to present it in a way to people
[11:35] that have never heard it before
[11:37] but this should just it should just
[11:39] arrest us immediately and say
[11:41] wait a minute what's happening
[11:44] this seems more like a
[11:46] a movie or something or or ancient
[11:48] mythology
[11:50] then it seems like
[11:52] scripture scripture is so practical so
[11:54] real so about our lives
[11:58] what in the world is a tree
[12:00] a magical tree that can
[12:02] make you die
[12:05] or a magical tree that can give you
[12:07] eternal life
[12:09] so could it be figurative
[12:11] of course it could be figurative does
[12:13] the bible speak about them the tree of
[12:15] life and the tree of the knowledge of
[12:16] good and evil is there context in
[12:18] scripture that we could say ah the the
[12:21] authors of scripture also saw it as
[12:24] figurative
[12:25] absolutely next slide
[12:28] revelation 2 7 says he that hath an ear
[12:30] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[12:33] the churches to him that overcometh will
[12:35] i give to eat of the tree of life which
[12:37] is in the midst of the paradise of god
[12:40] this is jesus speaking
[12:42] his promise to the church
[12:45] and he says if you overcome i'll give
[12:46] you the tree of life and that tree of
[12:48] life is still in the midst of the
[12:50] paradise of god
[12:53] so where is it
[12:56] right
[12:57] so we understand the story of the fall
[13:00] god placed
[13:01] god placed a fence and an angel guarding
[13:04] the tree of life so that man wouldn't go
[13:07] to that tree of life and eat it and live
[13:09] where
[13:12] is it in turkey
[13:16] syria
[13:17] iraq
[13:20] israel
[13:21] is there a little literal place of real
[13:23] estate
[13:25] that we could know as the paradise of
[13:26] god
[13:27] that man does not have access to that if
[13:29] he went there an angel would a sword of
[13:31] an angel would crush you and stop you
[13:33] from going in
[13:36] no there's no literal place like that
[13:38] it's a it's a figure of
[13:41] speech
[13:42] what it what is what does it mean that
[13:44] he's going to give us to eat of the tree
[13:46] of life which is in the midst of the
[13:48] paradise of god
[13:49] speaking of eternal life
[13:52] living in
[13:54] eternity in the new heaven and the new
[13:55] earth
[13:56] what was god's purpo again what happened
[14:00] what what literally happened you know we
[14:02] have the story we have the tree of life
[14:06] they didn't eat of the tree of life they
[14:07] ate of the tree of knowledge they fell
[14:09] they're blocked from going to eat of the
[14:10] tree of life
[14:11] in in in the garden of eden the paradise
[14:15] so what what actually happened they
[14:17] sinned and they separated themselves
[14:20] from god
[14:21] so what was earth supposed to be
[14:24] earth was supposed to be
[14:25] combined with heaven
[14:28] it was a place where god would dwell
[14:29] with man and live with man that's what
[14:32] adam and eve's experience was and
[14:34] they lost that fellowship that
[14:36] fellowship was broken by sin
[14:39] and so what is jesus saying here i'm
[14:42] going to give you to eat of the tree of
[14:44] life which is in the midst of the
[14:45] paradise of god he's telling you it's
[14:47] going to be restored which we understand
[14:48] that's the whole purpose of history of
[14:50] redemption
[14:51] is he's going to redeem not only his
[14:54] people his elect but he's going to
[14:56] redeem this earth so you have a perfect
[14:59] people
[15:00] living on a perfect earth
[15:02] that's what jesus is saying
[15:04] he's not saying that there's going to be
[15:05] a little literal tree where we go pick
[15:07] literal fruits that are going to make us
[15:09] live for eternity he is the tree of life
[15:14] he is the one that we eat of and live
[15:18] so does it speak is the tree of life
[15:21] spoken in scripture figuratively
[15:23] 100
[15:25] it is
[15:26] jesus uses it here figuratively so we
[15:29] can go back and look in genesis
[15:32] chapter two and chapter three and say
[15:36] this these tree these two trees
[15:38] are not literal trees they are
[15:40] figurative trees
[15:43] all right genesis 3 14 and 15 says
[15:47] and the lord god said unto the serpent
[15:49] because thou hast done this thou art
[15:51] cursed above all cattle
[15:53] and above every beast of the field
[15:56] upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust
[15:58] shalt thou eat all the days of thy life
[16:00] and i will put enmity between thee
[16:02] and the woman
[16:04] and between thy seed
[16:06] thy offspring
[16:08] and her offspring
[16:10] it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[16:12] bruise his heel we're going to come back
[16:14] and go over that in more detail
[16:17] but i want to look at the at
[16:19] um
[16:22] what the lord says to eve
[16:24] genesis 3 16
[16:26] says unto the woman he said i will
[16:28] greatly multiply
[16:29] thy sorrow and thy conception
[16:32] in sorrow thou shalt bring forth
[16:33] children and then i desire shall be to
[16:36] thy husband and he shall rule over thee
[16:39] so
[16:40] strange we have god saying in the
[16:42] beginning multiply and replenish the
[16:44] earth then he says don't eat of the tree
[16:46] of knowledge
[16:48] then he says there's two offspring
[16:52] that are going to have
[16:53] enmity with each other
[16:56] then he goes forward and tells the woman
[16:59] that
[17:00] you're the
[17:01] you're going to be your reproductive
[17:03] process
[17:04] is going to be under a curse
[17:08] so
[17:10] one of these things doesn't fit
[17:12] and
[17:13] we've proven already it's figurative
[17:16] it has to be figurative
[17:19] so what does it mean then
[17:21] is could it be connected together these
[17:23] things
[17:24] could the context of context of
[17:26] scripture
[17:27] inform us
[17:29] about what it means to eat of the tree
[17:30] of the knowledge of good and evil
[17:32] yes yes it does so when when i say we
[17:36] believe scripture
[17:38] we're not making scripture into a bunch
[17:40] of figurative nonsense
[17:42] and we're dismissing the authority of
[17:44] scriptures what i'm saying is scripture
[17:46] interprets itself
[17:48] right
[17:50] scripture interprets itself and so
[17:53] if there's something that doesn't seem
[17:54] to fit
[17:56] you don't major on that
[17:58] and then minor on everything else
[18:01] if there's a broader context in the
[18:03] scripture
[18:04] then we have to look at that broader
[18:05] context and if there's something that
[18:06] doesn't seem to fit
[18:08] then we have to look at what doesn't fit
[18:12] in the context of the rest of scripture
[18:15] same thing that we do when you look at
[18:18] let us make man in our own image or
[18:22] matthew 28 19 father son and holy spirit
[18:24] we don't take one or two scriptures and
[18:27] reinterpret the rest of the bible
[18:30] we look at those scriptures and say amen
[18:32] i believe that that's the truth how do i
[18:35] understand this in the context of the
[18:37] rest of the bible so when we see a tree
[18:39] of knowledge of good and evil how do we
[18:41] understand that in the context of the
[18:42] rest of the bible well the rest of the
[18:44] bible tells us that god is going to
[18:47] multiply his image on the earth we know
[18:50] that the devil is already his enemy so
[18:53] the devil is going to come and fight
[18:55] that and block that how does he block
[18:57] that he's got to inject something that's
[19:00] not
[19:01] an offspring of god
[19:03] into
[19:05] that
[19:06] humanity something that's so close
[19:08] that there's the seed of
[19:10] the serpent
[19:11] and the egg of the woman could mingle
[19:13] together
[19:15] in order to stop
[19:17] the purpose of god on the earth
[19:20] but satan's so foolish to re to to miss
[19:22] the fact that he was playing right into
[19:24] god's purpose because there has to be
[19:26] something that's
[19:28] sinful
[19:29] sick
[19:30] polluted in order to experience
[19:33] the fullness of who god is
[19:38] all right now let's look at the serpent
[19:40] he wasn't a snake
[19:42] he became a snake
[19:44] but he wasn't starting a snake
[19:48] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[19:50] beast of the field which the lord god
[19:52] had made
[19:53] and he said unto the woman
[19:55] yea
[19:56] hath god said
[19:58] you shall not eat of every tree of the
[20:00] garden
[20:01] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[20:02] meet we may eat of the fruit of the
[20:05] trees of the garden
[20:07] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[20:08] the midst of the garden god has said you
[20:10] shall not eat of it
[20:12] neither shall you touch it lest you die
[20:15] and the serpent said unto the woman you
[20:16] shall not surely die for god doth know
[20:19] that in the day you eat thereof then
[20:21] your eyes shall be opened and you shall
[20:23] be as elohim knowing good and evil
[20:31] so looking at
[20:32] this verse i want to read to you
[20:35] what
[20:36] uh bible commentator adam clarke
[20:40] wrote in the late 1800s
[20:42] about the serpent
[20:44] he's so
[20:45] before we get to that place the word
[20:48] for serpent is the word nakhash
[20:52] and if you look in the scripture
[20:55] it's spoken of
[20:58] it's interpreted many different ways
[21:00] it's spoken of as brass it's spoken of
[21:02] as uh
[21:04] fetters or like what we would call
[21:05] handcuffs
[21:06] it's spoken of as an alligator
[21:08] hippopotamus
[21:10] many many different ways that the word
[21:13] nakhash is
[21:14] spoken of and so we understand that the
[21:17] context
[21:19] of scripture informs us
[21:21] what exactly a nakhash is
[21:24] it also can mean a snake
[21:26] but again the context of scripture
[21:29] informs us what it is
[21:31] otherwise you couldn't go from a
[21:35] a crocodile down to a
[21:37] brass fetters that doesn't make sense so
[21:39] obviously you you get you derive its
[21:42] meaning from scripture
[21:44] in the context
[21:47] so adam clark writes this that whatever
[21:49] one whatever this nakhash was
[21:52] he stood at the head of all inferior
[21:54] animals for wisdom and understanding i
[21:57] think you can go on to the next screen
[21:58] gideon and i'll have that there
[22:01] two that he walked erect for this is
[22:03] necessarily implied in his punishment on
[22:06] thy belly i.e on all fours shalt thou go
[22:09] three that he was endued with this gift
[22:11] of speech for a conversation is here
[22:13] related between him and the woman
[22:16] that he was out for that he was also
[22:18] endued next screen the with the gift of
[22:20] reason for we find him reasoning and
[22:23] disputing with eve five that these
[22:26] things were common to this creature the
[22:28] woman no doubt having often seen him
[22:30] walk erect
[22:31] talk and reason and therefore she
[22:33] testifies no kind of surprise when he
[22:36] accosts her in the language related in
[22:38] the texts and indeed from the manner in
[22:40] which this is introduced it appears to
[22:42] be only a part
[22:43] of a conversation that got that had
[22:45] passed between them on the occasion yea
[22:48] hath god said etc
[22:51] had this creature never been known to
[22:53] speak before his addressing the woman at
[22:55] this time and on this subject it could
[22:58] not have failed to excite her surprise
[23:00] and to have filled her with caution
[23:03] though from the purity and innocence of
[23:05] her nature she might have been incapable
[23:08] of being affected with
[23:10] fear
[23:11] so my goodness this is quite the
[23:15] profound statement that adam clarke is
[23:17] using let me break it down in really
[23:19] simple terms he said
[23:22] the serpent was
[23:23] upright on two feet he could speak
[23:26] and he could reason and this was normal
[23:29] this is what was experienced continually
[23:32] by both adam and eve that the serpent
[23:34] was able to do this
[23:36] wasn't a snake it was an upright
[23:38] creature that had similar capabilities
[23:41] to
[23:42] adam and eve only it wasn't made in the
[23:45] image and likeness of god
[23:47] apparently was made in the image of man
[23:51] so
[23:52] just as brother branham says in 1954
[23:54] questions and answers number one and the
[23:56] serpent was not a reptile the curse made
[23:58] him a reptile he was just like a man he
[24:01] walked upright and he was with this
[24:02] woman out there
[24:03] and she committed this adultery and
[24:05] brought forth her first son
[24:07] which was cain the nature of his daddy
[24:11] all right
[24:12] i just have a few more minutes
[24:14] and
[24:16] i want to close on a good point because
[24:17] i'll have i'll have i'll continue this
[24:20] the next time so
[24:22] let's see
[24:25] go to the
[24:26] next screen and then the next one after
[24:28] that yeah
[24:30] so god's command to them is multiply
[24:34] and replenish the earth
[24:36] then god commands them not to eat of the
[24:38] tree of knowledge
[24:39] then god puts enmity between two genetic
[24:42] lines
[24:43] then god curses the birth process
[24:47] and puts eve's
[24:49] desire
[24:50] towards her husband
[24:52] so
[24:53] all of all of these things are clear
[24:56] obvious
[24:58] clues
[24:59] i i find it very interesting two things
[25:02] in the message
[25:03] that you share with people that elicit
[25:06] very emotional responses
[25:08] and that's
[25:09] the godhead
[25:10] and serpent seed
[25:12] and it's it's it's strange because
[25:16] uh i understand the trinity because it's
[25:19] like it's basically saying
[25:20] your whole world view is needs to be
[25:23] refined
[25:25] and that's a shock it was a shock for me
[25:30] serpent seed seems weird
[25:32] very weird it was weird to me the first
[25:34] time i heard it
[25:35] but as you examine scripture it becomes
[25:38] more and more obvious we haven't even
[25:39] covered
[25:41] a quarter
[25:42] of what i'm going to cover in the future
[25:44] but you see just from the beginning of
[25:47] the book of genesis
[25:48] and surrounding context a small
[25:51] surrounding context of scripture
[25:53] is quite
[25:54] obvious that the original sin produced
[25:58] two genetic seed lines
[26:01] he's going to put enmity between two
[26:02] seed lines then the story continues in
[26:05] genesis
[26:06] 4 5
[26:07] and and on and the whole story what is
[26:09] the story up through verse chapter 10
[26:12] basically it's two seed lines
[26:16] in enmity against each other
[26:18] from the very beginning cain kills abel
[26:21] if that's not a immediate clue you're
[26:23] not even reading
[26:25] and then continuing on it speaks of two
[26:26] different seed lines doing two very
[26:28] different things
[26:30] one's calling on the name of the lord
[26:32] and one is setting up their own kingdom
[26:35] and their own cities and their own
[26:37] their own
[26:38] vision of life right
[26:41] and then you come and you see these two
[26:42] seed lines mixed together and god says
[26:44] well this is
[26:46] this is not right i'm going to bring
[26:47] judgment upon it and start over again so
[26:50] um
[26:52] scripture is so beautiful
[26:55] and once you un can unlock the key
[26:58] of serpent seed
[27:00] you you really unlock many many things
[27:02] throughout the scripture so let's stand
[27:04] we're going to dismiss
[27:10] heavenly father we thank you for your
[27:12] word
[27:14] we thank you lord that you revealed it
[27:16] to us
[27:17] lord and
[27:19] in this day
[27:21] lord that you took a
[27:23] humble humble man of god
[27:26] lord and you
[27:27] you vindicated his ministry so clearly
[27:30] and then you brought these incredible
[27:32] truths to us lord
[27:34] lord truths that
[27:37] they are incredible they're they're
[27:38] they're amazing they're wonderful to
[27:40] feed on but
[27:41] it's truth that has actually changed our
[27:44] lives and is still changing our lives
[27:46] and
[27:46] ultimately is going to change our bodies
[27:49] lord
[27:50] just continue to unfold yourself to us
[27:52] make yourself more real to us
[27:54] bless the service lord the worship the
[27:56] preaching of the word may you be
[27:57] glorified
[27:59] may you be the center of our hearts and
