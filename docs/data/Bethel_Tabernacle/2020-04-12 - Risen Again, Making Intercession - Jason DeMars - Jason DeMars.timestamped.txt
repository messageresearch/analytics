[30:59] happy easter everyone so glad to be in
[31:03] the house of the Lord and my goodness I
[31:07] just miss everyone so much and on the
[31:14] one hand it sure doesn't feel like
[31:16] Easter on the other hand shouldn't every
[31:19] day feel like Easter amen because we're
[31:22] risen and walking in newness of life in
[31:25] Christ and so I'm so excited he is risen
[31:29] he's the same yesterday today and
[31:31] forever his mighty works are still going
[31:35] forth throughout all the earth we might
[31:39] be meeting in just small groups or
[31:40] there's churches that are just simply
[31:43] doing zoom meetings all around the world
[31:46] or Facebook live or however they're
[31:49] doing it but people are coming together
[31:50] and God is not limited by our location
[31:54] he's he's everywhere he's dwelling in
[31:58] the heart of every believer and we we
[32:03] can know him outside of a church
[32:06] building and he moves in a supernatural
[32:11] way outside of a church building and
[32:13] we're discovering that again and people
[32:17] are they're still healings going forth
[32:19] there's still supernatural move of the
[32:22] Spirit going forth in people's lives and
[32:25] oh my goodness it's just a wonderful
[32:28] hour to be alive we can be frustrated we
[32:32] can study about all the conspiracy
[32:34] theories we can look in and see and say
[32:37] oh the government should have done this
[32:38] or should have done that and that's
[32:39] that's alright thank the Lord we can
[32:42] still speak about speak against the
[32:45] government in this country
[32:48] but there's places where you can't do
[32:51] that so we can disagree with what a path
[32:56] and what approach to the government
[32:59] local government federal government has
[33:01] taken that's alright
[33:02] but the thing it is not so much that we
[33:05] need to be thinking about that it's we
[33:08] need to be thinking keeping our eyes and
[33:10] our focus on Christ in this hour and
[33:14] what a fitting time for all these things
[33:16] that happen to remind us in today Christ
[33:20] is risen
[33:21] he's on the throne and he's the same
[33:26] yesterday today and forever amen
[33:29] I just want to pray father we love you
[33:34] so much
[33:35] we're so thankful Lord for this day Lord
[33:39] though every Sunday we honor the
[33:41] resurrection to for this day to just
[33:44] take a special time to think about what
[33:47] the resurrection has done for us Lord
[33:50] and there's many many things we could
[33:54] speak about regarding that Lord and I
[33:56] just have something specific in my heart
[33:59] to talk about regarding that Lord one
[34:03] aspects of that Lord but believe it's an
[34:07] important subject for this our Lord and
[34:11] I don't even pretend to understand
[34:13] everything their Lord but we want to
[34:17] just continue walking in the light every
[34:20] step Lord and you're doing that with
[34:23] each believer and you're doing that in
[34:27] each Minister that's called to the
[34:30] fivefold ministry or you're teaching us
[34:32] you're leading us you're guiding us and
[34:34] it's doing it Lord for your glory for
[34:37] the equipping of the Saints for the
[34:39] building up
[34:41] Lord of their lives of their faith Lord
[34:45] none of us exist for ourselves so Lord
[34:48] let us each one get ourselves out of the
[34:50] way Lord we just asked for a
[34:52] supernatural spirit of peace in every
[34:55] home that's tuning in now we know how it
[34:59] goes Lord with little kids and and
[35:01] things it's it's not easy to sit in your
[35:06] comfortable home where the kids play and
[35:08] do things on a daily basis and now they
[35:12] have to sit down and be quiet and watch
[35:16] watch the service Lord I pray that you'd
[35:18] help each mother each father
[35:21] each child Lord just calm their spirits
[35:24] father and may your presence come may we
[35:27] be able to tune in and focus Lord we
[35:31] know that with social media with with
[35:35] the devices that we have sometimes it's
[35:38] it doesn't lend itself to really
[35:40] focusing lord help us to overcome Lord
[35:44] our location our device how we're
[35:46] watching this Lord and really be able to
[35:48] get in tune with the Spirit of God we
[35:51] need you Lord we just want to commit
[35:54] ourselves to you in Jesus name Amen amen
[35:59] musicians I'm just gonna go ahead and
[36:01] dismiss you I'm going to take a few
[36:02] minutes to lay the groundwork and get to
[36:04] my scripture so I'm not sure if we got
[36:08] the PowerPoint up there but my subject
[36:11] is risen again making intercession and
[36:18] so I just want to kind of lay the
[36:22] groundwork for this as we go into it I
[36:24] know it can sometimes be a controversial
[36:28] subject talking about the mercy seat and
[36:31] and the mediator ship of Jesus Christ
[36:35] and it shouldn't be but because of
[36:39] misunderstandings on things that
[36:40] sometimes becomes that I'm not here to
[36:44] solve everybody's problem I'm not here
[36:48] to bring you the definitive definitive
[36:51] answer on this subject
[36:55] I don't I'm not qualified to do that I
[36:59] don't believe I am
[37:00] I consider this that the Lord has given
[37:03] me another step in my personal walk and
[37:07] revelation and understanding this is
[37:10] maybe just one step part of that and I
[37:14] it's been a blessing in my life pray
[37:16] pray it's a blessing in your life
[37:20] I consider that there's much more to
[37:22] learn about this I don't believe that
[37:24] there is more revelation to come to us
[37:30] in the sense that there's gonna be
[37:32] another messenger or that brother
[37:35] Branham is gonna return to bring us more
[37:37] revelation but I do believe there's more
[37:40] revelation for us contained inside of
[37:42] the message that God delivered and I
[37:47] believe that the Lord is gonna place
[37:49] that in the scripture that's what he
[37:51] that's what he always does you know he's
[37:53] gonna give us the Lord will give us a
[37:55] balanced understanding so what often
[37:58] happens too often happens is I you go
[38:02] through it all the time when you have
[38:03] online ministry you have one side they
[38:05] want to take one aspect of it and then
[38:09] they then there's the other aspect of it
[38:11] and they say let's let's have a fight we
[38:15] fight with both aspects and I want to
[38:17] say yes that's that's right but it's
[38:20] also written Jesus did the same thing
[38:23] there's a way to place these things in
[38:25] order and in pop proper perspective in
[38:28] the message in the scripture without
[38:30] saying I'm throwing this away now
[38:33] understand there's a progression there's
[38:35] a progressive revelation that brother
[38:37] Branham had there's a process that he
[38:39] had where he even said I was wrong about
[38:41] this subject in the past and so I'm just
[38:43] trying to kind of lay the foundation
[38:46] this is a little thing that the Lord
[38:48] helped me with I'm not trying to make a
[38:50] grand revelation out of it I just
[38:53] believe I believe there's a scriptural
[38:56] point here that can be a blessing to us
[38:58] in this hour where we're we're we're
[39:00] thinking about the resurrection of Jesus
[39:02] Christ so with that that said I'm gonna
[39:05] go to my opening scripture Romans 8:30
[39:08] three and thirty four who shall lay
[39:12] anything to the charge of God's elect it
[39:15] is God that justifieth who is he that
[39:17] condemneth it is Christ that died hey
[39:20] rather that is risen again who is even
[39:23] at the right hand of God who also maketh
[39:25] intercession for us Amen may the Lord
[39:29] had the blessing to the reading of his
[39:30] word you can be seated
[39:34] so our security from condemnation that's
[39:42] what this is speaking about is in the
[39:44] fact that jesus christ's rose from the
[39:47] dead and is at the right hand of god
[39:50] making intercession for us so it starts
[39:54] out who can lay anything to the charge
[39:55] of who is gonna come before god's court
[39:59] and make a charge against the elect who
[40:03] can do it if it's God that justifies who
[40:08] is gonna supersede his decision Hafiz
[40:12] the question is obvious no one or the
[40:15] answer is obvious it's no one who is the
[40:17] one that condemns so who is going to
[40:19] stand and say I bring charges and I'm
[40:22] going to condemn this person before
[40:25] God's court of law
[40:28] Paul answers it's Christ that died yay
[40:34] rather that is risen again who's even at
[40:37] the right hand of God who also makes
[40:39] intercession for us a crucial part why
[40:44] was Jesus raised from the dead for what
[40:46] purpose what how does that impact you
[40:48] and me think about that for a minute if
[40:50] he doesn't raise from the dead he cannot
[40:53] make intercession for us he cannot
[40:55] present himself before God and say Here
[40:59] I am the intercessor the representative
[41:02] of all the elect of all the ages he
[41:05] can't do that
[41:06] so God raises him from the dead and
[41:08] brings him there and he's at the right
[41:11] hand of God making intercession for us
[41:15] thank you Jesus
[41:18] hebrews chapter 7 verse 22 through 25 by
[41:27] so much was Jesus made a surety of a
[41:30] better Testament and they truly were
[41:33] many priests because they were not
[41:34] suffered to continue by reason of death
[41:37] but this man because he continued with
[41:39] ever hath an unchangeable priesthood
[41:42] wherefore he is able also to save them
[41:45] to the uttermost that come unto God by
[41:48] him seeing he ever liveth to make
[41:51] intercession for them he ever lives for
[41:57] what purpose to what end
[41:58] why does he ever live why was he raised
[42:01] from the dead to make intercession for
[42:04] them
[42:05] thank you lord so there's lots of terms
[42:08] in these verses that I really want to
[42:10] look at and pay attention to and dig
[42:13] into on a deeper level first one is
[42:15] surety there's the word Testament or
[42:18] covenant and there's intercession all
[42:22] these terms are critically important
[42:25] when we're understanding this topic
[42:28] scripturally so first one we have is
[42:31] surety a surety means a person who takes
[42:35] responsibility for another's performance
[42:38] or an undertaking for example their
[42:41] appearing in court or the payment of a
[42:45] debt so Jesus has become the surety of a
[42:50] better Testament or covenant okay so a
[42:54] better one so he's referring back to the
[42:56] Old Testament the Old Covenant and he's
[42:59] saying it's a better one we'll talk more
[43:01] about that as we go forward it this is
[43:03] this one is improved this one is new and
[43:07] it's improved and the problem was not
[43:11] with the one who started the Covenant
[43:13] I'm getting ahead of myself again the
[43:16] problem was not with God this makes it a
[43:20] better covenant because it takes it out
[43:23] of our hands it puts it back in the
[43:28] hands of God and then God says you know
[43:31] what
[43:32] I can't take you directly if I take you
[43:37] directly you will fail again I'm not
[43:41] gonna not gonna make this covenant
[43:42] directly with you why because you'll
[43:46] fail you proved before that you will
[43:49] fail so he's gonna take a surety so when
[43:54] when you take a surety you're you're
[43:56] saying I want someone to guarantee this
[43:59] for me so a young person wants to go in
[44:02] and I definitely don't ever suggest
[44:04] doing this being a cosigner but but
[44:08] parents will will come and they'll take
[44:10] take a child in and become a cosigner
[44:13] for the loan what happens in that
[44:15] situation you are responsible for that
[44:18] loan well I'm just a cosigner
[44:21] you are responsible for that loan if the
[44:26] your child does not pay it it will
[44:28] impact you and so here in this situation
[44:32] God says you know what I'm just gonna
[44:34] bypass you guys cuz you will fail I'm
[44:38] gonna make a covenant and I'm gonna make
[44:40] a covenant with Jesus Christ because I
[44:43] know he's perfect I know he's sinless I
[44:45] know he will not fail and he will stand
[44:49] in your place
[44:50] he'll pay your debt he will appear in
[44:53] court for you so when we're called and
[44:55] before God and in the court of heaven
[44:59] who's who's gonna come Jason to Mars
[45:02] know Jesus Christ is gonna appear in
[45:07] court for Jason to Mars
[45:09] Jason to Mars can stand and watch the
[45:12] proceedings God says okay Jason to Mars
[45:15] I want to call you up to judge you
[45:17] and I will say will you I'm just gonna
[45:21] stay here go ahead and up rise as my
[45:24] attorney and he says I'll I'll pay the
[45:28] debt I stand as his representative and
[45:32] God says it's finished if you're perfect
[45:35] he's perfect there's no debt owed it's
[45:39] it's complete
[45:40] so that's God made a covenant with us
[45:44] with Christ
[45:46] as the guarantor of that covenant what a
[45:48] good deal what a good deal I'm gonna
[45:53] take that deal Hebrews 8:6 through ten
[45:59] but now hath he obtained a more
[46:01] excellent ministry by how much also he
[46:04] is the mediator of a better covenant
[46:05] which was established upon better
[46:08] promises for if that first covenant you
[46:11] see why it's better you understand it's
[46:13] better they're better promises amen
[46:17] for if that first covenant had been
[46:19] faultless then should no place have been
[46:22] sought for the second ooh is Paul saying
[46:25] that the God that God who made a
[46:27] covenant made a mistake well no for
[46:34] verse eight for finding fault with them
[46:37] he didn't find fault with himself he
[46:41] said I found there's a Fault in this
[46:43] covenant and it's you because what is a
[46:46] covenant it's a green agreement between
[46:47] two parties so there's a problem in the
[46:50] Covenant the problem is you he saith
[46:54] behold the days come saith the Lord when
[46:56] I will make a new covenant with the
[46:58] house of Israel and with the house of
[46:59] Judah not according to the Covenant that
[47:01] I made with their fathers in the day
[47:02] when I took them by the hand to lead
[47:04] them out of the land of egypt because
[47:06] they continued not in my covenant and i
[47:08] regarded them not saith the lord for
[47:11] this is the covenant that i will make
[47:13] with the house of israel after those
[47:14] days saith the lord i will put my laws
[47:16] into their minds and write them in their
[47:19] hearts and i will be a god be to them a
[47:21] god and they shall be my people
[47:28] so christ was our surety
[47:32] he wasn't god's surety god is perfectly
[47:37] faithful God is completely righteous he
[47:40] always fulfills his word he needs no
[47:43] surety however you and I do as I was
[47:46] just talking about Christ is our surety
[47:49] Christ as our guarantor he takes
[47:51] responsibility for our performance
[47:56] for our perfor how we live how we act
[48:02] the way the way we sin the way we
[48:06] disbelieve God's Word and in times that
[48:10] we have struggles in our lives where we
[48:12] fall off the the correct path or we make
[48:16] the choices that are against God's Word
[48:19] Christ says I take responsibility for
[48:21] that I stand in their place but not only
[48:25] do I stand and stand in their place I'm
[48:28] gonna work in their lives I'm gonna
[48:31] change them I'm gonna transform them I'm
[48:34] gonna put the law of God in their hearts
[48:37] and in their minds I'm gonna write the
[48:39] word in their hearts why so they have a
[48:42] knowledge know so that they have a life
[48:44] the life of God lived through them so he
[48:47] takes the responsibility for our
[48:49] performance he takes our place in the
[48:52] divine court of law
[48:53] and he pays our debt the fault was in us
[48:59] the fault was in man for the Old
[49:01] Covenant so he makes a new covenant he
[49:04] makes that agreement between two parties
[49:06] again the agreement is between God and
[49:09] the elect but he doesn't deal with us
[49:12] directly now think about a covenant the
[49:16] new covenant what is the new covenant
[49:19] well really it's the it's the shedding
[49:22] of Christ's blood the application of
[49:25] that through the baptism of the Holy
[49:26] Ghost right so this is God's covenant he
[49:31] puts his Spirit within us and he writes
[49:33] the word and he transforms us and that
[49:35] is how the blood works within us there's
[49:38] no literal blood anymore that took place
[49:43] at Calvary that was finished Christ was
[49:47] resurrected with a new body
[49:48] he went he ascended he presented himself
[49:54] before the Father and say here's here is
[49:57] the sacrifice and-and-and-and and then
[50:01] he is the intercessor so he stands in
[50:03] the presence of God and he's our
[50:05] representative in heaven
[50:10] and then he has that high priest is
[50:14] interceding for us and we remember in
[50:16] the script in the book of Hebrews he can
[50:18] go and read it he's not offering
[50:21] continual sacrifices it's not necessary
[50:25] he offered one perfect sacrifice once
[50:30] for all of us and his literal body is in
[50:35] heaven and he's literally there
[50:40] interceding for us you know in
[50:45] intercession that word means the action
[50:47] of intervening for someone else
[50:49] so he's intervening for us he ever lives
[50:53] to make intercession for us so that that
[50:56] life that he lives there he stands there
[50:58] and any intervenes for us and it also
[51:04] says he's the mediator of a better
[51:05] covenant first Timothy two were five and
[51:11] six for there's one God and one mediator
[51:14] between God and men the man Christ Jesus
[51:17] who gave himself a ransom for all to be
[51:21] testified in due time a mediator is a
[51:25] person who stands between two parties
[51:27] involved in a conflict so yes two
[51:35] parties were involved in a conflict
[51:37] there was a conflict between God and us
[51:43] we were God's enemies let's read the
[51:47] scripture on that you say well I was
[51:49] elect that was never his enemy well
[51:51] let's read the scripture Colossians 1 21
[51:54] and 22 and you that were sometime
[51:57] alienated and enemies in your mind by
[52:00] wicked works yet now hath he reconciled
[52:04] in the body of his flesh through death
[52:06] to present you holy and unblameable and
[52:09] Unruh provable in his sight we were
[52:13] enemies we were a lien ated from God and
[52:17] we needed Christ
[52:21] to stand in our place to represent us
[52:24] before God so that there could be a
[52:27] reconciliate er makes peace through the
[52:31] blood of his cross first Corinthians 15
[52:36] 20 through 22 but now is Christ risen
[52:40] from the dead and become the firstfruits
[52:42] of them that slept for since by man came
[52:45] death by man came also the resurrection
[52:48] of the Dead for as in Adam all die even
[52:51] so in Christ shall all be made alive
[52:54] amen so that's the that's the elected he
[52:58] is our head Adam was the was that was
[53:02] our head to start with and he by sin
[53:05] fell and he he he brought death on the
[53:11] whole human race and so he brings death
[53:15] to the whole human race Christ brings
[53:17] life to the whole human race and he is
[53:21] our representative and he stands there
[53:24] and he takes he takes it all every every
[53:28] punishment that we deserved he took it
[53:30] every the wrath of God that was supposed
[53:33] to be poured upon us he took it and then
[53:37] through his resurrection we were in him
[53:40] we were his bride we are his bride but
[53:45] we were his bride then too why because
[53:48] we were chosen in Christ in his mind in
[53:51] the mind of God before the foundation of
[53:53] the world when he went to the cross we
[53:55] went with him when he was buried we were
[53:57] buried with him when he rose up we rose
[54:00] up with him we're made alive in him and
[54:05] so brother Branham says this in the
[54:09] sixth seal you cannot let me go forward
[54:13] here yeah
[54:15] you cannot intercessor limp unless there
[54:17] is blood there yes sir there's one
[54:20] mediator between God and man and that's
[54:22] Christ Jesus that's what the scripture
[54:24] says there he stands until the last soul
[54:27] has been redeemed and then he comes
[54:30] forth to claim what he has
[54:34] that's he until that last soul has been
[54:38] redeemed he will stand and intercede
[54:41] he's the mediator of a better covenant I
[54:44] have a question is the new covenant
[54:46] still in effect or did it be passed to
[54:49] another covenant if we passed another
[54:54] covenant what Scripture do you have for
[54:56] it as I understand in the dispensations
[55:01] in the scripture you have the church age
[55:05] dispensation and then after that is
[55:08] completed God turns and begins to deal
[55:11] with the Jews through the two witnesses
[55:13] and he calls the 144,000 and they theirs
[55:18] they received the seal of God so they
[55:21] are they become a part of the New
[55:22] Covenant but he stops dealing with the
[55:25] Gentile bride and he turns to begin to
[55:29] deal with the Jews and that's that's
[55:31] something separate that God is doing for
[55:33] for Israel and yet they do receive the
[55:36] Holy Ghost and so Christ has to stand
[55:40] there as an intercessor as he reveals
[55:43] himself it's they say who are these who
[55:46] where'd you get these scars from where
[55:52] who pierced your hands who pierced your
[55:53] feet out with I got it in the house of
[55:55] my friends and so is he interceding for
[55:59] the Jews then or does he stop
[56:01] interceding sometime long before he
[56:05] deals with the Jews you you answer it I
[56:11] I know what I believe now Christ is not
[56:19] continually offering his blood upon the
[56:21] mercy seat he's not taking a knife and
[56:24] dropping blood that's not what it's
[56:27] that's not what his intercessory work is
[56:30] about he shed his blood the work is
[56:33] finished it was completed at Calvary the
[56:37] blood has done its work has accomplished
[56:40] its purpose but then he has to make
[56:43] intercession for us he has to stand in
[56:45] our place
[56:47] the covenant that he made it's still in
[56:50] effect he's the guarantor he continues
[56:52] to be the guarantor he continues to be
[56:54] the surety and until every elected one
[56:58] is saved completely saved washed and
[57:02] given the Spirit of God to write the
[57:04] word upon their heart as we sin as we
[57:08] make our confession to God he ever lives
[57:11] to make intercession for us
[57:13] he's a go-between by virtue of his life
[57:18] he's resurrected and this is our
[57:20] guarantee of forgiveness and
[57:22] resurrection both it's like our
[57:25] guarantee of our forgiveness but also
[57:26] our resurrection our own resurrection
[57:28] both in the inner man and the outer man
[57:32] and the culmination of Christ's work as
[57:37] a mediator I believe is to take and
[57:42] claim the book of Redemption I didn't
[57:46] say the end of it
[57:47] I said the culmination of all that he's
[57:51] done and then he takes the book he takes
[57:56] that book of redemption he opens the
[57:57] seven seals now I want you to look and
[58:00] see what brother Branham said yeah
[58:16] yeah The Voice is a thunder the voice
[58:19] came from where from the throne where
[58:21] the lamb had just left as intercessor
[58:23] now he is standing here to take his
[58:26] position in his claims but that thunder
[58:29] came from the inside of the throne
[58:31] thundered out and the lamb was standing
[58:34] out there the thunder where the lamb had
[58:36] left left the father's throne to go to
[58:38] take his own throne glory now don't miss
[58:41] it friends we all know as Christians
[58:43] that God swore to David that he would
[58:45] raise up Christ to sit on his throne and
[58:47] give him an everlasting Kingdom here on
[58:51] the earth he did it
[58:52] and Jesus said he that overcomes the
[58:55] antichrist and all the things of the
[58:56] world shall sit with me in my throne as
[58:59] i have overcome and have sat down on my
[59:03] Father's throne
[59:05] amen amen
[59:09] so again the process he's going to rise
[59:14] up from his mediators the throne and his
[59:19] Father's throne and he's gonna go and
[59:22] take his own throne seems complicated
[59:26] but not really what where is his
[59:31] Father's throne that's in heaven that's
[59:33] the that's the very throne of God that's
[59:35] where Christ is seated and in process of
[59:38] time what does he do he has three
[59:40] different offices Christ has he's a
[59:43] prophet he's a priest and he's also a
[59:46] king so when he makes the transition
[59:49] from priest to King he rises up and he
[59:53] takes his throne when he becomes king
[59:56] okay so it's it's if you look there's
[1:00:00] always an hour of transition between the
[1:00:05] offices read John chapter 17 look at
[1:00:11] that it's called the high priestly
[1:00:13] prayer of Jesus Christ he begins
[1:00:16] interceding but I want you to notice is
[1:00:19] he did he stop being a prophet no he was
[1:00:23] still a prophet he even had things where
[1:00:26] he foretold things after that where he
[1:00:30] told the secrets of the heart after that
[1:00:32] but there was an hour of transition
[1:00:35] where he was going to the cross and
[1:00:37] becoming our intercessor and to be the
[1:00:40] priest that is our mediator standing as
[1:00:44] our surety so there was a transition and
[1:00:46] even now there's a transition between
[1:00:50] offices he's claiming his bride
[1:00:58] he's joining in an invisible union with
[1:01:01] his bride there's something today we
[1:01:03] understand that's unique
[1:01:05] you know he's took the book he broke the
[1:01:08] seals the mighty angel came down put his
[1:01:12] foot on the land on the sea with an open
[1:01:14] book he cries with the loud voice seven
[1:01:15] thunders out of their voices and the
[1:01:18] seventh angel finishes that mystery it's
[1:01:21] an hour of transition brother Branham
[1:01:23] says we're turning a corner it doesn't
[1:01:26] he doesn't say well that is over with
[1:01:28] it's done and now we're on another thing
[1:01:31] but he says we're turning a corner not
[1:01:35] we've turned a corner we're turning a
[1:01:37] corner in the sermon proving his word
[1:01:41] brother Branham says now that that's a
[1:01:47] that's a big word predestinate but we
[1:01:50] all know that it's the truth we
[1:01:51] absolutely know that the infinite God
[1:01:53] predestinated all things by
[1:01:55] foreknowledge before the foundation of
[1:01:57] the world even the lamb was slain and
[1:01:59] every name that would ever be on the
[1:02:00] book was put on the book before the book
[1:02:02] was ever written
[1:02:02] now how many knows that's true and Jesus
[1:02:05] came to redeem those that were in the
[1:02:07] book in the Bible the lamb came from
[1:02:12] behind the curtain and taken the book
[1:02:14] and opened the seals that it was sealed
[1:02:18] with for he came to claim all he has
[1:02:20] redeemed
[1:02:20] he's the intercessor now an intercessor
[1:02:23] making intercession for those he has
[1:02:25] redeemed all whose names was written on
[1:02:27] the Lamb's Book of Life is redeemed so
[1:02:36] notice what he said he said he came
[1:02:42] he taken the book and open the seals
[1:02:44] that it was sealed with for he claimed
[1:02:47] he came to claim all he had redeemed
[1:02:50] next next sentence what does he say he's
[1:02:54] the intercessor now he didn't just leave
[1:02:58] it at he's the intercessor so that we
[1:03:00] could be open to interpretation he what
[1:03:04] you know what would he maybe he meant he
[1:03:05] was the intercessor in the past he's the
[1:03:08] intercessor now an intercessor making
[1:03:10] intercessions for those who he has
[1:03:12] redeemed
[1:03:14] so again redemption Christ paid the
[1:03:18] price at Calvary he has to make the
[1:03:21] claim the first start of making the
[1:03:24] claim is taking the book the second part
[1:03:27] of finishing that claim is actually
[1:03:29] physically descending from heaven
[1:03:33] leaving that throne descending from
[1:03:34] heaven meeting us in the air resurrected
[1:03:38] raptured Saints will meet the literal
[1:03:41] physical body of Jesus Christ in the air
[1:03:44] and we'll go to the marriage supper and
[1:03:46] then he'll turn and make himself known
[1:03:48] to the Jews so brother Branham had no
[1:03:51] problem saying the seals are open he
[1:03:53] broke the seals and saying he's an
[1:03:56] intercessor now it's a process he takes
[1:04:02] them he took the book in 1963 he broke
[1:04:04] the seals in 1963 he's still interceding
[1:04:08] for us he's still a high priest that can
[1:04:10] be touched by the feeling you can do
[1:04:11] these searches you could see them
[1:04:12] yourself and did he did he again did he
[1:04:21] take his Millennial throne I know some
[1:04:24] people claim that but he hasn't taken
[1:04:27] his millennial throne he will literally
[1:04:28] do it literally on this earth from the
[1:04:32] literal City of Jerusalem
[1:04:36] he hasn't done that yet so he took the
[1:04:40] book he broke the seals brother Branham
[1:04:42] I have 17 pages because some people were
[1:04:45] saying only six seals rope I have 17
[1:04:47] pages of quotes brother Branham speaking
[1:04:49] about seven seals are opened so they're
[1:04:53] opened
[1:04:54] and he's interceding for us why because
[1:04:57] the New Covenant is still in effect do
[1:05:00] you have a new covenant without a
[1:05:01] mediator of the Covenant that's crazy
[1:05:06] where is the body of Jesus Christ did
[1:05:10] he's still in heaven the literal
[1:05:16] physical body of course we understand
[1:05:17] the body of Christ is the bride all
[1:05:23] right Hebrews 9 23 and 24 this was
[1:05:26] something that really struck me because
[1:05:28] it it matters where Jesus Christ is I'm
[1:05:32] not I'm not talking about the spirit of
[1:05:34] Jesus Christ we understand that he's
[1:05:37] here with us now I'm talking about that
[1:05:39] literal body the man Christ Jesus who's
[1:05:43] our mediator
[1:05:44] where is he because that will tell us
[1:05:47] what stage were at it was therefore at
[1:05:50] Hebrews 9 23 and 24 it was therefore
[1:05:52] necessary that the patterns of things in
[1:05:54] the heavens should be purified with
[1:05:56] these but the heavenly things themselves
[1:05:58] with better sacrifices than these for
[1:06:01] Christ is not entered into the holy
[1:06:03] places made with hands which are the
[1:06:05] figures of the true but into heaven
[1:06:07] itself now to appear in the presence of
[1:06:11] God for us so where is he appearing for
[1:06:18] us well he's appeared in spirit form
[1:06:21] here well we're not talking about pure
[1:06:23] spirit form we're talking about the man
[1:06:24] Christ Jesus where is he is he on some
[1:06:28] spiritual throne in Jerusalem ruling
[1:06:31] over some ridiculous Millenium
[1:06:35] no no he's literally still in heaven in
[1:06:42] the presence of God for us he didn't
[1:06:47] enter the holy places made with hands
[1:06:49] which are the figures of the true he's
[1:06:53] in heaven itself to appear in the
[1:06:56] presence of God he's standing for us
[1:06:59] he's standing for me that's my surety if
[1:07:04] he's not standing for me I'm completely
[1:07:07] lost
[1:07:08] he stands there for me he's still in
[1:07:12] heaven however we understand he did take
[1:07:14] the book
[1:07:14] he started his claim for his bride to
[1:07:17] take us that process has begun from the
[1:07:26] indictment and I'm looking at my time
[1:07:28] here from the sermon the indictment now
[1:07:33] in Christ is God's provided Lamb
[1:07:37] notice how appropriate was now brothers
[1:07:41] and sisters I just want to say I was so
[1:07:44] nervous when the Lord spoke to my heart
[1:07:46] that I was supposed to speak on this
[1:07:47] subject because this this could be just
[1:07:50] such a quagmire to wait into and I I
[1:07:53] don't want to wait into a quagmire I'd
[1:07:56] rather have a brother Jason wait wait
[1:07:57] into a quagmire and I'll just support
[1:08:01] him in it but the law I know when the
[1:08:05] Lord speaks to my heart I'm growing
[1:08:08] enough to the place where I say don't
[1:08:10] I'm not gonna resist that as you in the
[1:08:14] past usually I had another sermon
[1:08:15] prepared and this one there and I just
[1:08:17] walk up to the pulpit feeling terrible
[1:08:20] and saying okay I'm gonna preach on this
[1:08:21] but I'm sure it's gonna be terrible yes
[1:08:28] I have no confidence in myself and
[1:08:32] that's not a bad thing I have confidence
[1:08:35] in Him who called me and he'll take care
[1:08:37] he'll take care of everything but I want
[1:08:40] to be careful in how I'm communicating
[1:08:41] this because I don't want to go I'm
[1:08:43] trying to stay just as balanced as I can
[1:08:47] not to take one side and run like crazy
[1:08:50] or another side and run like crazy let's
[1:08:53] say let's say Amen to both sides so this
[1:08:58] is from the indictment now and Christ is
[1:09:00] God's provided lamb
[1:09:02] notice how appropriate was now showing
[1:09:04] that all that that Jerusalem was ceasing
[1:09:07] when it was an infected tell that hour
[1:09:09] the blood of the lamb was alright until
[1:09:11] that day but now at the crucifixion it
[1:09:14] changes the old system is done there's a
[1:09:16] new one and the lamb was at the
[1:09:18] sacrifice the land the sacrificial lamb
[1:09:20] was on the grounds
[1:09:21] they were condemning and doing the very
[1:09:23] thing there they they had to do that's
[1:09:25] right
[1:09:26] God be blessed for seeing this wonderful
[1:09:28] heavenly light in this day because the
[1:09:31] churches is doing the same thing today
[1:09:32] until the hour that organization
[1:09:34] organization religion is condemned and
[1:09:37] proved to be sacrificing Christ's word
[1:09:38] from then on comes the word and the word
[1:09:42] only from the old Paschal Lamb passed
[1:09:44] away in Christ become our lamb at the
[1:09:47] day of the crucifixion and the day that
[1:09:49] the denomination crucified the Word of
[1:09:51] God and accepted a Creed in the stead of
[1:09:54] the word that's the day the word come
[1:09:57] into a full effect that's just been
[1:10:00] recently so is the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:10:06] no longer in effect and we now have a
[1:10:09] bloodless faith it also says it is also
[1:10:14] written and we have to take that also
[1:10:17] written we don't just take this quote
[1:10:19] and say the rest of what he said just
[1:10:21] throw it out we can't do that because
[1:10:24] over and over again he speaks about the
[1:10:26] blood of Christ after this quote and so
[1:10:29] there then that means there's we don't
[1:10:32] dismiss this one either there's a way to
[1:10:35] look at both sides and I'm not saying I
[1:10:39] have the perfect way but I I feel like
[1:10:43] there's more but I feel like the Lord
[1:10:46] starting something so invisible Union of
[1:10:50] the Bride of Christ your first wedding
[1:10:52] was annulled it was you've never done it
[1:10:54] in the first place because there's only
[1:10:55] one thing could do it that would be God
[1:10:57] come down himself and took your place in
[1:11:00] the form of the Son of God Jesus Christ
[1:11:02] and wash you by the water of the washing
[1:11:04] of the water by the word the word not
[1:11:06] the denomination the word washed you but
[1:11:09] if you won't stand in the water of the
[1:11:10] word how are you going to be washed
[1:11:12] you're still as spotted as Eve was oh
[1:11:15] dear now look at this this is what he
[1:11:19] sings oh dear dying lamb thy precious
[1:11:22] precious blood shall never lose its
[1:11:24] power till all the Ransom church of god
[1:11:27] be saved to sin no more what is sin sin
[1:11:30] his unbelief unbelief in what the word
[1:11:32] unbelief in God which is the word pure
[1:11:35] an adult
[1:11:35] Oh hallelujah leaving soon for the skies
[1:11:38] amen
[1:11:40] standing ready think your garments
[1:11:42] washed by the water of the bleeding word
[1:11:45] the word become blood the word bled for
[1:11:49] you and you are washed in the bleeding
[1:11:50] word the word bleeding the life of God
[1:11:52] in the word and the word was blood for
[1:11:54] you that you might be washed from the
[1:11:56] filth of these prostitutes and be
[1:11:58] cleaned and sanctified by the washing of
[1:12:00] the water of the word and makes your
[1:12:03] mind and heart stayed on God and His
[1:12:07] Word so that's that's what he said it
[1:12:16] goes from the blood to the word and the
[1:12:18] word comes into a full effect and that
[1:12:20] was just recently and he said were
[1:12:22] washed by the water of the bleeding word
[1:12:24] so the blood is connected to the word on
[1:12:29] one sense it always was it always was in
[1:12:34] another sense there has to be a
[1:12:37] restoration of the original faith and
[1:12:40] that has to be presented to the church
[1:12:44] world so if you're gonna be washed by
[1:12:48] the water of the word if you have an
[1:12:50] imperfect word a perverted word can you
[1:12:54] truly receive that spotless without spot
[1:12:57] or wrinkle he's gonna present a bride to
[1:13:01] himself a church without spot or wrinkle
[1:13:03] and so that church needs to be washed by
[1:13:06] the Paul says calls it washed by the
[1:13:09] water of the word and so it's gonna have
[1:13:11] to be a perfect restored word to make a
[1:13:14] perfect spotless bride and so that word
[1:13:18] is restored and then it's presented and
[1:13:21] guess what happened
[1:13:22] it got crucified so now God looks at
[1:13:28] things differently and as you read
[1:13:31] brother branham's message he begins to
[1:13:33] make a transition
[1:13:47] so here we have in the first seal notice
[1:13:50] these type the reason they die out they
[1:13:53] go through the purging of trial of the
[1:13:55] tribulation because they're not actually
[1:13:58] under the blood they claim they are but
[1:14:02] they're not how can they go through a
[1:14:04] trial to purify them when there is when
[1:14:08] the bleach blood of Jesus Christ takes
[1:14:11] every symptom of sin and stuff away from
[1:14:14] you and you're already dead and your
[1:14:16] life is hidden him through God and
[1:14:18] sealed in there by the Holy Ghost what
[1:14:20] are you going to be judged for where are
[1:14:22] you going to get your purification what
[1:14:24] do you have to be purified from when
[1:14:25] you're perfectly in Christ sinless
[1:14:28] what's the judgment for but it's the
[1:14:30] sleeping bunch that then people can't
[1:14:33] make out so he says that group that that
[1:14:37] group the the the foolish virgin in this
[1:14:43] place he says they're not under the
[1:14:45] blood in this Plitt in this place he
[1:14:47] says that and so you see when when and
[1:14:52] we're getting into many details but when
[1:14:54] the message is presented and if the
[1:14:57] people reject it what happens it it goes
[1:15:00] from the blood to the word doesn't
[1:15:05] dissing all the blood it never can write
[1:15:09] but what it does is now God applying
[1:15:12] that blood is only through the restored
[1:15:16] word upon the bride so god changing
[1:15:22] changing turning corners there and of
[1:15:26] course that gets into another thing and
[1:15:27] there's something to balance out even
[1:15:29] with that with those things as well but
[1:15:31] just to understand these are the things
[1:15:33] that the prophets said regarding this
[1:15:35] subject and we don't want to take one
[1:15:38] and take the other and and and and get
[1:15:40] get ourselves in a fight within
[1:15:42] ourselves the blood is applied to the
[1:15:46] bride via the perfect restored word
[1:15:50] during a dispensational transition
[1:15:54] there's a transition period time that's
[1:15:56] happening that's taking place we're not
[1:15:59] just we're not in an eighth age is
[1:16:03] there's only seven Church ages there's
[1:16:05] not eight straight changes we're in the
[1:16:07] seventh church age but brother Branham
[1:16:10] says within the seventh search age you
[1:16:12] have the Pentecostal age and you have
[1:16:14] the bride age that's within Laodicea
[1:16:16] that time period the seventh church age
[1:16:18] there's a bride age why because there's
[1:16:21] a trick there's a calling of the bride
[1:16:22] within the seventh church age Christ has
[1:16:25] put on the outside and now he begins to
[1:16:27] call and say come commons and and and
[1:16:31] feast with me and we'll be joined and
[1:16:35] we'll be made one and so that's that
[1:16:37] transition period of time from Christ as
[1:16:41] the mystery of God revealed and the body
[1:16:43] must follow the head as the wife follows
[1:16:45] the husband husband being that Adam was
[1:16:47] not deceived he walked out with Eve Eve
[1:16:49] was deceived she was in the
[1:16:51] transgression or the entire resurrection
[1:16:53] of the whole body would come for that
[1:16:55] the day of the Lord Jesus when he come
[1:16:57] forth at the grave but he had to redeem
[1:16:59] her which is his body she had to be be
[1:17:01] redeemed in order to come to him do you
[1:17:04] see it
[1:17:05] oh my see it couldn't have happened then
[1:17:08] listen to what he says it couldn't have
[1:17:10] happened then when Jesus died and was
[1:17:14] raised from the dead it couldn't have
[1:17:17] happened then the redemption is going on
[1:17:22] look look at his next phrase now you see
[1:17:26] the seals the redemptions going on now
[1:17:31] now you see the seals when he's in his
[1:17:33] mediatorial work back they're redeeming
[1:17:35] but someday he comes forth to get this
[1:17:37] book that he's redeemed and all that's
[1:17:39] in this book would would be him for
[1:17:43] that's the believer the words in the
[1:17:45] book and the word is him and all that
[1:17:47] all that's in that he come forth for the
[1:17:50] book of redemption whose names are
[1:17:51] written on the book before the
[1:17:52] foundation of the world when he was
[1:17:54] slain as a lamb and here he is today in
[1:17:58] his word manifesting the same thing that
[1:18:00] he did there
[1:18:01] she can't recognize another headship no
[1:18:03] sir there's nobody
[1:18:04] no-nothing she recognizes one headship
[1:18:06] headship that's Christ and Christ is the
[1:18:09] word oh my I love that yes sir as the
[1:18:12] head was took up from the grave so must
[1:18:14] his body follow him into Eden
[1:18:16] therefore the body cannot recognize any
[1:18:19] other headship but the headship of the
[1:18:22] word wow there's so much there but I
[1:18:27] just wanted to capture that one spot the
[1:18:30] redemption is going on now now do you
[1:18:32] see the seals it's going on he doesn't
[1:18:37] say it's over with it's done Mercy's
[1:18:40] over he's off the mercy seat there's no
[1:18:43] more no he doesn't say that he says it's
[1:18:45] going on there's a transition from one
[1:18:48] dispensation to another there's a
[1:18:50] preparation in stee when he opened those
[1:18:53] seven seals a transition began it isn't
[1:18:58] as though okay 1963 happened we cut it
[1:19:03] off and start something new you can't
[1:19:05] find that in what brother Branham taught
[1:19:07] you don't see that anywhere but you can
[1:19:10] definitely see that there's a there's
[1:19:12] something very distinct happening Christ
[1:19:17] has descended in spirit form with an
[1:19:20] open book to reveal that open book to us
[1:19:23] that content to produce rapturing faith
[1:19:26] well if rapturing faith is in the
[1:19:29] message why are you still here because
[1:19:31] rapturing faith has to go from the
[1:19:33] message that was preached to us to have
[1:19:37] its effect inside of us he said the
[1:19:40] church is starting to get the message
[1:19:41] only thing left is what do they need to
[1:19:43] do they need to lay in the presence of
[1:19:45] the son to ripen so I just want to bring
[1:19:53] it kind of to a not a full conclusion
[1:19:57] because I imagine there's there's more
[1:19:59] that I'd like to cover but musicians if
[1:20:05] you would would come up and cry
[1:20:13] still stands in the presence of God for
[1:20:15] us he still remains our surety our
[1:20:20] guarantor our mediator his blood is
[1:20:23] still in effect but it comes via the
[1:20:26] fully restored word he took the seventh
[1:20:29] sealed book and he opened it not he
[1:20:31] didn't open six seals and wait 50 60
[1:20:35] years to open the seventh seal he's
[1:20:37] opened the whole thing to us because
[1:20:39] brother Branham said again and again
[1:20:41] it's become a new book to me well if
[1:20:43] it's still closed it can't be a new book
[1:20:45] it has to be completely open that mighty
[1:20:48] angel came down what did he have in his
[1:20:49] hand open book seven thunders out of
[1:20:52] their voices brother Brandon brought
[1:20:54] that revelation to us to finish the
[1:20:57] mystery of God but then there's one step
[1:20:58] further now we have to take the book and
[1:21:00] eat the book and prophesy again not a
[1:21:03] new prophecy but to say what he said
[1:21:10] he's in the process of changing Thrones
[1:21:15] he hasn't changed Thrones yet but he's
[1:21:18] in the process of doing it and he will
[1:21:20] do it but that process has started when
[1:21:23] he opened the seals and it will be
[1:21:25] completed when he descends with his
[1:21:27] bride to literal Jerusalem Redemption is
[1:21:33] going on now there's a final stage of
[1:21:36] redemption we didn't get to the
[1:21:38] scripture but in first Peter I think
[1:21:41] it's one verse five that there's a
[1:21:42] salvation that's ready to be revealed at
[1:21:45] the last time they will probably talk
[1:21:47] about that next time but Redemption is
[1:21:50] going on now there's a salvation that's
[1:21:52] going on right now something distinct
[1:21:55] from the cross something that's too to
[1:21:59] wash us by the water of the word mercy
[1:22:02] is still in effect because the mediator
[1:22:07] stands and mediates for us he's in the
[1:22:10] presence of God for us amen let's pray
[1:22:16] gracious father were so thankful
[1:22:20] that you raised up the Lord Jesus and
[1:22:22] that you'll raise us up also Lord and he
[1:22:26] stands as the guarantee of that before
[1:22:29] you how grateful Lord we should be lord
[1:22:35] I pray that the the presence of your
[1:22:37] Holy Spirit would be upon us continually
[1:22:40] Lord in this hour Lord of confusion Lord
[1:22:44] just settle each of our spirits Lord
[1:22:46] that we might have clarity and
[1:22:48] understanding father we love you
[1:22:52] help us not to run to and fro and just
[1:22:56] even in our mind in our own homes we run
[1:22:58] to and fro mentally going here going
[1:23:01] there and it just robs our peace Lord
[1:23:03] may the peace which passes all
[1:23:05] understanding be upon everyone listening
[1:23:08] in may we seek your face may we enter
[1:23:12] into that closet Lord and seek you in
[1:23:15] secret that you might manifest the
[1:23:20] answer openly Lord we commit ourselves
[1:23:23] to you father we ask that you be
[1:23:27] glorified in all things in Jesus name
[1:23:29] Amen amen brother Jason
[1:23:42] amen praise the Lord God bless you man
[1:23:46] we're happy to have brother Jason
[1:23:49] deliver that today I'm just saving my
[1:23:53] voice a little bit for tonight it's a
[1:23:55] little bit ratty and so I was trying to
[1:23:59] save my strength and actually I was
[1:24:02] supposed to be in New Zealand so brother
[1:24:04] Jason was actually scheduled for the
[1:24:07] service here today so it just worked out
[1:24:10] fine too sly him right back in there but
[1:24:13] I I thought that I would like to just
[1:24:15] make a small short address to you being
[1:24:19] that it is Easter morning for us we were
[1:24:23] I was actually preaching my Easter
[1:24:24] message last night a man because we were
[1:24:27] doing it via through digital means
[1:24:31] through the internet but this is a
[1:24:33] glorious day
[1:24:34] a man I've got a little bit of an echo
[1:24:36] back up up here brother Joe maybe take
[1:24:39] the monitors down to still be bit
[1:24:40] perhaps and and so we were really
[1:24:46] enjoying that last night and I certainly
[1:24:48] enjoyed what I heard this morning I
[1:24:50] thought it's profound and I
[1:24:52] wholeheartedly endorse it I think that
[1:24:55] it's a very amazing subject when we
[1:24:59] really begin to back up and take it in
[1:25:02] from a high altitude and look at the
[1:25:05] plan of God whenever I do that I always
[1:25:07] get astonished at God's plan of
[1:25:10] redemption
[1:25:11] amen that that what it looks like when I
[1:25:14] back up and look at how he mapped it all
[1:25:16] out from Genesis all the way through
[1:25:18] revelation and then see it play out in
[1:25:20] history and see it having effect in our
[1:25:24] lives today amen I you know I I want to
[1:25:29] just take they're saying my mic needs
[1:25:32] turned up just a little bit brothers on
[1:25:34] the stream amen so I wanted to take just
[1:25:39] a few minutes and just kind of go over
[1:25:42] some things and just take a few minutes
[1:25:45] if I can to thank the engineering team
[1:25:49] and all the brothers and musicians and
[1:25:52] who have made these services possible in
[1:25:57] case I forget to say that tonight I want
[1:26:00] to say it to them now it's been a flurry
[1:26:03] of activity and you know I just want to
[1:26:06] thank them for their capital job that
[1:26:09] they've done it hasn't you know there's
[1:26:12] technology as filled with gremlins and
[1:26:14] brother Murphy hangs out at every
[1:26:17] service and so he's always messing
[1:26:20] things up but we've got through it and
[1:26:23] it's it's been going good we even today
[1:26:27] we had trying to switch back and forth
[1:26:29] between working with the team in New
[1:26:32] Zealand and back on to our regular
[1:26:34] service today you wouldn't you wouldn't
[1:26:36] believe the flurry of activity that goes
[1:26:38] on I'm really ready to get back to
[1:26:42] normal I'll just tell you I am ready to
[1:26:44] get back to normal because you know the
[1:26:48] we we we had so much going on today and
[1:26:51] messages are flying back and forward and
[1:26:54] you don't even see it on camera I know
[1:26:56] that that some you know perhaps when you
[1:26:58] you you all you see is the problems with
[1:27:01] the sound or the video or this that or
[1:27:03] the other and believe me the team sees
[1:27:06] it too and right away they start getting
[1:27:08] bombed and everybody's bombing them and
[1:27:11] I'm getting bombed and I'm saying
[1:27:13] they're working on it they're saying
[1:27:14] we're working on it and oh my it is it
[1:27:16] is it can really get topsy-turvy I had
[1:27:21] to quickly run out today we had a
[1:27:22] microphone that brother Matt needed for
[1:27:25] his Tucson service preparing while this
[1:27:27] was going on and I don't even think you
[1:27:29] saw it I uh I hope brother George had
[1:27:32] the camera angled up brother Joe was
[1:27:34] actually on the floor here on his hands
[1:27:38] and knees
[1:27:38] sneaking under brother Jason to Mars
[1:27:40] taking equipment out of here
[1:27:42] transferring it back to there oh my
[1:27:45] goodness friends it's it's been a it's
[1:27:47] been a it's been a doozy and so you know
[1:27:51] we we did our best and if we if we you
[1:27:55] know made mistakes and I got caught with
[1:27:58] an embarrassing mistake I'm glad I got
[1:28:00] to delete it probably for most of you
[1:28:02] all even got to see it but a man I had
[1:28:04] sent a message to my son
[1:28:05] johnathan it turns out funny but it's
[1:28:07] also embarrassing and I think Lord was
[1:28:09] teaching me
[1:28:10] you know you're not supposed to be
[1:28:11] texting in church hey man I preached
[1:28:14] that so I got to live by it myself but
[1:28:16] sometimes I am because I'm talking to
[1:28:18] the booth if you ever see that happening
[1:28:20] a man it's it's it's usually almost
[1:28:23] always in relation to church someone's
[1:28:26] asking about a problem on the stream
[1:28:28] I'll be glad when we get to heaven and
[1:28:30] you know there I used to hear brother
[1:28:33] Ed's say all the time
[1:28:34] there'll be no wires in heaven and I'm
[1:28:38] so glad for that there would be no wars
[1:28:40] in heaven and there would be no wires in
[1:28:42] heaven amen and we won't need these
[1:28:45] silly devices a man to text back and
[1:28:48] forth or whatsapp back and forth and so
[1:28:51] I just wanted to just give a pen arose
[1:28:54] on the team the musicians the worship
[1:28:57] leaders the technical people a man it's
[1:29:01] just been a whole team effort I sure
[1:29:05] couldn't have got started doing it amen
[1:29:08] if I didn't have these brothers willing
[1:29:09] and it's believe me as frustrating as
[1:29:12] sometimes it can be to you out there
[1:29:13] it's very frustrating to them when
[1:29:17] equipments not working or a piece of
[1:29:18] software isn't working or Internet's not
[1:29:20] working and it can be rather maddening
[1:29:24] but I hope that you will continue to
[1:29:27] have patience we're still working on
[1:29:30] things looks like we are going to get
[1:29:31] the fiber optic line from har gray
[1:29:35] they're gonna bring it down this road it
[1:29:37] doesn't exist right now they've agreed
[1:29:39] to build it and bring it down just to
[1:29:41] connect to our church so I think that's
[1:29:44] an answer to prayer amen our brothers
[1:29:47] who are in the know on that kind of
[1:29:50] thing know that that's going to cover a
[1:29:53] multitude of problems
[1:29:54] amen just that by itself you know we
[1:29:58] never thought that we would experience
[1:30:00] you know the loss of assembly when
[1:30:03] brother Branham talked about some day
[1:30:05] you won't be able to worship like this
[1:30:07] we never really thought it would be like
[1:30:09] this and you know we we followed the
[1:30:13] request of the government and you know
[1:30:17] some some chose not to
[1:30:19] even even a few pastors you see it on
[1:30:22] the news there's even a very small
[1:30:25] amount of pastors even within the
[1:30:27] message who felt you know not not to do
[1:30:31] that not to follow those guidelines and
[1:30:33] I'm not here to judge another man's
[1:30:36] servant
[1:30:37] you know III will say I don't want to
[1:30:39] see anybody cashing a stimulus check
[1:30:41] that didn't follow the government's
[1:30:43] recommendations if you didn't shelter
[1:30:45] with all of us then don't go running the
[1:30:47] bank cashing that stimulus check give it
[1:30:49] to somebody who did a man so but anyway
[1:30:53] praise the Lord let me let me move on
[1:30:56] amen so you know but it's interesting
[1:31:01] because normally you know on Easter if
[1:31:04] you think about it historically speaking
[1:31:06] my wife and I were talking about it this
[1:31:08] morning and normally you you you have to
[1:31:11] set out extra chairs on an Easter
[1:31:14] service think about that normally you
[1:31:16] have to set out extra chairs and and
[1:31:19] even even they make jokes about it even
[1:31:21] preachers you know there's the old
[1:31:22] running joke to say I just want to say
[1:31:25] you know Merry Christmas Happy Birthday
[1:31:27] and Happy New Year because I know I
[1:31:30] won't see you again for another year
[1:31:31] next Easter so let me just go ahead and
[1:31:34] get wish you happy birthday Merry
[1:31:35] Christmas and Happy New Year and if you
[1:31:36] married happy anniversary amen now so
[1:31:39] but and I say that just for the irony of
[1:31:42] it all that that for the first time in
[1:31:45] our generation anyway in our generation
[1:31:48] at least here in the privileged land of
[1:31:51] America you know for the first time
[1:31:54] Easter can't be about a new dress or a
[1:31:57] new outfit or a new hat or setting out
[1:32:01] chairs for people that come once a year
[1:32:03] you know it's it's not about any of that
[1:32:06] kind of stuff we're finally back to the
[1:32:08] actual book of Acts when they celebrated
[1:32:11] Easter before it was ever called Easter
[1:32:13] amen
[1:32:14] think about what that church was doing
[1:32:16] on the first year anniversary of his
[1:32:19] resurrection you know what the Bible the
[1:32:22] book of Acts says they were going house
[1:32:23] to house so you and your home's today
[1:32:27] you're more in line with the book of
[1:32:29] Acts than we've ever been
[1:32:31] a man so I appreciate the Lord you know
[1:32:34] I I remember brother Matt ministering
[1:32:38] early on when we first had to start you
[1:32:42] know keeping it limited and we were we
[1:32:45] were a little bit over our gbbw today we
[1:32:47] had one extra person and so we were
[1:32:50] sending certain ones home we had to send
[1:32:52] a couple of musicians home and we're
[1:32:55] happy for everyone and we'll have to you
[1:32:57] know we're having to figure out the
[1:32:58] schedule and that's another maddening
[1:32:59] thing for me to have to figure out daily
[1:33:01] and you know you're always in a flurry
[1:33:04] of texting back and forth or you on are
[1:33:06] you in or you out are you on and and and
[1:33:09] and and so you get that aspect of it and
[1:33:12] so you know I remember brother Matt
[1:33:15] talking about he had commented on I had
[1:33:19] made a comment about if one thing that
[1:33:21] this virus situation has done is it took
[1:33:26] us off the treadmill because you know it
[1:33:28] made everything stop America as a nation
[1:33:31] just stopped business stopped commerce
[1:33:33] stopped everybody's stay home
[1:33:35] everybody's shelter in place you know no
[1:33:37] more social distancing don't meet in
[1:33:39] groups of more than ten and I mean you
[1:33:42] know you can get you can still find
[1:33:43] grocery stores and pharmacies and you
[1:33:46] know I think they call that and they've
[1:33:48] got another word essential businesses
[1:33:51] but I mean all of the places where you'd
[1:33:53] normally shop you can't go in there
[1:33:55] anymore they might have a curbside
[1:33:57] service they might not you know and so
[1:34:00] we we've been home with our families and
[1:34:03] you know I said what a what an amazing
[1:34:06] thing it is hey guess what you're off
[1:34:08] the treadmill take some time use this
[1:34:12] time and brother Matt was speaking about
[1:34:14] that and he made a comment you know
[1:34:16] after going down that whole line of
[1:34:18] thinking to say listen you know this is
[1:34:20] the time brother Diggs was preaching
[1:34:22] about it how many remember that Amen
[1:34:24] that you know spend the time with your
[1:34:26] family that you never had before slow
[1:34:28] down back up you know dust off the
[1:34:31] Bibles restart family altar pray you
[1:34:35] know pray together come together and and
[1:34:37] it's so stuck with me the statement
[1:34:39] brother Matt made about hey don't come
[1:34:42] back
[1:34:42] after this don't don't don't be the
[1:34:45] person that that after this is all over
[1:34:48] and you're back on the treadmill and you
[1:34:51] didn't use that time and you didn't take
[1:34:54] advantage don't come back after all this
[1:34:56] and you still are no better off than you
[1:34:59] ever were before and you know you're
[1:35:02] you're that take the time let me just
[1:35:05] say it again we don't know how much
[1:35:06] longer this will go on we know it's
[1:35:09] gonna go through the end of April for
[1:35:11] sure
[1:35:11] the president is talking about trying to
[1:35:13] open or partially open our phased
[1:35:16] opening of the country back we don't
[1:35:18] know what that's going to look like this
[1:35:20] may go into long-term through April even
[1:35:22] in to me it's quite possible the team
[1:35:25] the ministry team and I andhe and the
[1:35:28] elders the deacons and trustees we've
[1:35:30] talked a little bit about long-term
[1:35:32] plans we've still got to do some more
[1:35:34] discussion on that prayerfully make some
[1:35:36] decisions going forward so I just want
[1:35:40] to kind of bring you up to speed today
[1:35:42] Church and say god bless you
[1:35:44] we're we're praying let's be praying one
[1:35:47] for another and let's be you know all
[1:35:50] for one and one for all let's where I
[1:35:52] say at all the time we're all in this
[1:35:54] thing together and I I've been when I
[1:35:57] watch the the nightly news on the
[1:35:59] Internet Archive I've been hearing the
[1:36:01] leading news lady for CBS I think and
[1:36:07] she's constantly looking in the camera
[1:36:09] going hey y'all we're all in this
[1:36:11] together and I'm going she's been
[1:36:12] listening to my sermons man she must be
[1:36:15] on our church archive because I say that
[1:36:16] all the time we're all in this thing
[1:36:18] together amen and so let's continue to
[1:36:22] have patience and pull and pray and and
[1:36:25] and you know the Lord will put us back
[1:36:27] together in His perfect will I'm glad
[1:36:30] for the technology I'm glad we have
[1:36:33] these silly devices I you know you know
[1:36:36] even if I stumble and trip and embarrass
[1:36:39] myself but I'm still glad I got it
[1:36:41] amen I'm glad I can communicate and I'm
[1:36:43] glad we can fix problems if there's a
[1:36:45] problem we can fix it
[1:36:46] you can let me know you know
[1:36:49] and and we're doing the best that we can
[1:36:51] Amen with what we have and it looks like
[1:36:54] the Lord's given us quite a bit so that
[1:36:56] we can work and make it good and make it
[1:36:58] right but friends don't rely you know I
[1:37:03] remember making a statement that I heard
[1:37:05] brother Paula Fontaine make recently you
[1:37:08] know how that you know how do you expect
[1:37:12] to fight a devil who comes after you
[1:37:15] daily if all you ever arm yourself with
[1:37:18] is a two or three days a week and he
[1:37:21] fights you daily how you going to
[1:37:24] overcome if you're only once or twice or
[1:37:27] three times a week and you're against a
[1:37:29] devil who fights you who doesn't sleep
[1:37:31] and he comes to try to Infant invade
[1:37:35] your sleep your waking your moving he he
[1:37:39] has no respect you can come to the house
[1:37:41] of God and he'll come right and try to
[1:37:43] invade your mind and I'm gonna take
[1:37:45] something friends we've got to have a
[1:37:48] lifestyle that is daily as Jesus said
[1:37:51] take up your cross daily amen and so you
[1:37:57] know that that is a that is that is a
[1:38:00] prerequisite that is a very necessary
[1:38:03] element so just a reminder again take
