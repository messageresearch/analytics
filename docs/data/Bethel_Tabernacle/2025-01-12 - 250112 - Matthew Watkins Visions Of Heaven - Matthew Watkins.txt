Bible go straight to the 2 Corinthians chapter 12 and then we'll go straight to the word this morning amen 2 Corinthians chapter 12 good to be here Amen in the house of the Lord God bless uh you to all of our visitors I know brother Nathan uh kled where's he at he's here okay they're in the back he's here and also uh some of his family so um we just want to say welcome to them amen and brother Benton's family also here so God bless you amen good to have you amen here this morning we just want to touch Jesus don't we amen how many want to just touch him you know that as the song says that's all that really matters man you come to church you sing you prepare you get dressed you put on a tie um some of you uh but you get in your Sunday attire you you know the AV Team Works the sound crew the musicians Play We Gather but this is all that really matters is that we touch him amen I just want to say Lord I want to touch you this morning you know brother Bram said there's more than just touching him is more than just physical touch remember brother brandham said that woman with the blood issue he said that you know everybody when Jesus said who touched me as disciples said Lord what are you talking about everybody's touching you but brother bam says but she touched him in a way that nobody else was touching him she Drew with that touch amen I believe we can do that this morning 2 Corinthians chapter 12 amen I'm going to talk to you about something here today that's a subject that uh the Lord just laid real heavy upon my heart and uh just uh feeling the heaviness of it this morning uh after we lost a dear family member of ours um and the Lord just began to give me inspiration and I carried it and spoke it was uh there in Tennessee at the winter youth retreat and so the Lord just brought that inspiration back today so uh you know it's a subject that no one likes to talk about but let me just say it's good news it's really good news it's you know the the the promise of the believer amen is really good news I want to speak to you and I'm going to title this visions of heaven or visions yes visions of Heaven 2 Corinthians chapter 12 then we'll read one more scripture in Matthew 6 and we'll let you be seated Paul says it's not expedient for me doubtless to Glory I will come to visions and Revelations of the Lord I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago and this is the Apostle speaking of himself whether in the body I cannot tell or whe whether out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth such a one caught up to the third heaven and I knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth how that he was called up into paradise and heard unspeakable Words which is not lawful for a man to utter of such a one will I Glory yet of myself I will not Glory but in my infirmities for though I would desire to Glory I shall not be a fool for I will say the truth for now I for forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me let's go to Matthew chapter 6 just turn back there in your Bible Matthew chapter 6 amen and let's just read it real familiar your scripture Matthew 6 and verse 19 through 21 Jesus says lay not up for yourself Treasures upon Earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourself Treasures in Heaven whether neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also Lord Jesus we just give you thanks One More Time Lord as we just open these words I can hear your Prophet say Lord one day we'll open this Bible for the last time one day Lord we'll sit in a church for the last time one day Lord God the last sermon will be preached could it be today today Lord could today Father be that last day we know there will be Lord if it is then God I just want to raise hands and say Jesus let your Holy Spirit scan every part of my being my body my soul my spirit Lord and if there would be anything that would be unlike you Lord would you purge it and take it from me just now God I pray that you would sanctify us Lord father I pray that your word would just come and speak to the hearts of your people let it Jesus we pray in Jesus name amen you can be seated amen these are real familiar words that we read here in Mark chapter 6 and uh I just want to pick up just here for a moment and we have some uh brother Mark or sister Esther you could put that up if you could just on the display we know that brother deals with this dimension of heaven and we could we we could look in many places throughout the Bible to speak about it and about life and where a person goes when they die I think it's amazing because you can see that you are as a person caught in between a dimension of heaven and a dimension of hell I love how brother Brandon makes it so simple and he says you are either influenced from heaven or you're influenced from Hell there's there's really no other influence that comes there's only two places that a person can dwell and that is either when they die and that is either heaven or hell and all influences in life come from either place even brother brandham would break down angels and beings and creatures that we don't have you know all we have is depictions of imagery and pictures with wings and things like that using descriptors that the Bible gives us but even the Bible says that Paul says that uh I hath not seen Nor Ear heard uh neither has it even entered the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them who love him and so we know that the battle that we're in is a very spiritual battle it's a very it's a it's a it's a it's not a flesh and blood struggle but our life is caught between two dimensions a dimension or we could say voices or visions from heaven and also would be on display visions from hell I think it's amazing because you can think of this this this uh this this life and the life that we live and the breaths that we're breathing that one day we'll breathe our last breath on this side of Eternity and I know it's not a I know it's not a very popular or you should not even shouldn't say popular but it's not a very uh comfortable subject that we like to speak about when we talk about death but I think it's amazing that it takes the death of of someone for us to contemplate how fragile life is and how fleeting really life is uh you you you know even your steps the the Bible talks about that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord that means God's in control of your life he's in control of your steps that you take he ordained your first step on Earth he ordained the age that you would live in he he ordained the family you would be born in he ordained the struggles that he would put in your human vessel that you would have to overcome because God as he said about Moses god equipped Moses for everything Moses needed was already inside of him right and so we look at this and and our life is even just a moment away even here today this morning as I speak and it just as I just want you to to let it Dawn on you the way that it dawned on me that after today that this could be your last day on this side of Eternity think about that just for a moment that that someone could walk out these Church doors for the last time there will be a last time and life is just that way it's it's so fragile David begin to contemplate this and and he and he realized that his life was so fragile and it was so fleeting it's a really profound thought when you think about that that in this this moment here you could be on this in this dimension of Earth in between influences and then in the next moment when you walk out the door you don't know what's waiting for you down the road uh uh you know not to not to uh you know to think in some kind of Bleak you know dark way but sometimes we ought to contemplate that of how fragile our life really is and and and let me just say this that the only way that you can go to heaven how many want to go to heaven there's only one way to go to to heaven and that's death now think of that just for for a moment the only way for you to go to heaven is that you die the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 12 begins to talk about the distinctions of bodies he talks about the Earthly body body and how that it's made of Flesh and fleshy and and he talks about the body of animals and the body of different creatures and creation then he talks about the bodies of heaven and he points to the stars and he points to the moon and the planets in the in the atmosphere and he says those are the bodies of heaven but the bodies of of of of the heavens but he says then there's the spiritual body Paul says it's a theophany body a body not made with hands one that's prepared for you Eternal in the Heavens to be absent he says from the Lord is to be present to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord and so there's only one way out of here we're all going to face death in one way or another say brother Matt well I believe that I'll you know go into translation aren't you uh leaving off first Thessalonians 4 you know aren't you leaving off that there will be a Rapture no I'm not leaving any part of that you see all of us will die some of us will die a mortal death where we breathe our last breath in this Mortal body others as brother brandham said that Cocker that's made up and he said that seed Gene of God is inside of that Cocker life and he says now that cockabur the body on the outside is not the germ of life it's just a vehicle it's just a holder of the real you of who you really are but he says one day you'll bury that cocko Barrow enough either PL it in the ground or you bury it with the word and brother bandam says and you bury that with the word and with the word and with the word to one day what is the translation or the body change it's this body becoming so under control of the Holy Spirit and so dead to the things of the world and this atmosphere in lady AA that the body changes from to what the soul represents on the inside of you which is who you really are before the foundation of the world and so the only way out of this life is death can you say Amen the only way out of this life is death I want to say it as as clear and as plain and I'm just feeling the weight of this sermon as I preach it today I want to say it as clear as I've ever said it before the only way out of this life is death imagine that imagine just for a moment because it's taken the life of many people young young people that never thought that they would be dead or gone from this life before they turned 25 years old 18 years old before they ever turned 18 they they never would have imag IM that their life would come to an untimely death or a tragic end whatever you want to call it you think of how many people get up every day and we live life and go through the motions of life and go through the motions of what we call you know almost like autopilot what we do every day in our daily rout routines am amen and we never imagine you never imagine you know you never imagine that but let me just say death can come suddenly death can come instantly death can come unexpectedly at any moment and I just want to say as I say it under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost are you ready to die amen are you ready can we ask ourself that question this morning on this Sunday morning beautiful day in January are you ready should you breathe your last breath on this side as brother bam says when you breathe that last breath you don't go Million Miles Away you simply change dimensions and what you are here is what you are there and he says the only thing that you'll take is your character the only thing that you'll take is the character that's been molded In You by submitting and repenting by submitting and repenting by submitting and repenting you see that's the life of a Believer the life of a Believer is repenting and submitting and repenting and submitting and I don't say Lord I want to die as Paul said daily I want to repent and submit to the word of God and so it comes unexpectedly it can come very suddenly and it doesn't take a there's no how can I say this it it doesn't it doesn't there's death is no respector of persons kings die Queens die rich die poor die the educated die the uneducated die the college educated the Theologian doesn't doesn't matter who you are or what your status is or who your friends are or who the club that you you're part of who your dad is who your mom is what your last name is it doesn't matter how much money you have in the bank it doesn't matter how healthy you are how strong you are how much you can brinch press come on somebody amen amen death doesn't discriminate and one day Hebrews 9: 27 says it is appointed once unto man to die and then after the Judgment we will answer I I just want to stop here for a moment because I'm just feeling the the breakes of the Holy Spirit sometimes the holy spirit says go other times it just says stop here for a moment amen all of us will stand Paul says and give an account to God for the life that we lived all of us will stand and give an account all of us will stand before the Judgment seat of Christ some will stand before a white Throne judgment others will stand before the Judgment seat of Christ which is the word judging your life now I want to stand now I don't want to stand there I want to stand now and I know not preaching this today but I I'll just say it here again as I said last Sunday everybody will either come under the anointing of The Sixth Seal which is tribulation or the seventh seal which is the coming of the Lord all Humanity will fall under one of those two seals can you say amen and so we know this that all of us will stand there on that day and nothing nothing you can do nothing nothing no good gift no good work no good track record nothing can get you access into heaven uh let me say Church uh what church you're part of won't get you into heaven your status in life even me as a minister of the Gospel will not give me access into heaven come on somebody doesn't matter your money won't get you into heaven your your education won't get you into heaven how good and how much much you know the Bible won't get you into heaven how much you know the message won't get you into heaven there's one thing that will get you into heaven and that is the blood of Jesus Christ and it washes the Violet sinner clean it takes the darkest and the coldest and the the most hopeless and it transforms their life oh my brother my sister what we need is not a Reformation to make better people and better looking and better dress code and better Behavior we don't need a formation I say we need a transformation that starts in the very soul and the heart of a man who says God I'm willing to repent and submit yes Lord yes Lord there is no other way there is no other life there is no other name whereby men can be saved but the name of Jesus Christ Jesus said he says I go to prepare a place it's a real place uh he says he says you you you believe in God believe also in me behold I go to prepare a place and in my father's house are many mansions what's he doing he's describing using the scriptures to say this is a very real place it's not a figment of your imagination it's not something that you just dreamed up or something you've seen in a movie or something that you're you know that you just imagine in your mind but I want you to think here just for a moment that heaven is a very real place it has real people there's real mountains There's real valleys there's there's a real Sky there's a real there's there there there there's roads come on somebody there's roads there there there's there's highways it's a very real place Paul says I have not seen nor ear heard neither has it even listen neither has it even entered the heart of man what's he say and use your wildest imagination amen and you still wouldn't be able to Fathom what awaits those I'm talking about those who are believers who are who die in this life but they die a Christian amen they go into a place of rest Paul says that that uh uh Jesus says it that way it's a place of rest it's a place where he says I go to prepare let me just say there's a life that's beyond this life there's a dimension that's beyond this Dimension and in this Dimension we live with time and I forgot thank you Lord I'm going to set it for less than an hour I won't tell you how much less but I'm going to set it for less than an hour you love him praise God and so notice this here it's a real place I I I just want to stop here for a moment and just pause here for a second and I want to come to my slides if you have that sister you could you could display that and I'll be able to control it from here because before we can talk about heaven we must also talk about hell If Heaven is a very real place hell is every bit as much as real even brother bandham says that about the core of the earth and underneath us he says you know just underneath us is fire that's belching and the core of the earth you know coming from the Sun and and and you know and and and and all of that that it is and he but he says that you know that it's a it's a very real place even in Ephesians 6 you know the bi the the scripture very well when Paul says we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of Darkness against wickedness and he uses these words in high places that word is not altitude that is not height like up in the heavens but actually if you go and look at the meaning of that word it is speaking that our battle that we wrestle against is in high atmospheres or other dimensions other environments other other worlds that are Beyond this world that we see with our five senses Beyond just the brother bam would say just beyond the the realm of the chasm of this life and he he goes and he says that them over there on the other side he says sight is not exactly as we think it is as we see here with our own eyes but he says the contact that they have through sight is so much greater than anything that we have here it's a real Dimension it's a real environment we spoke last time about that fourth dimension how that that fourth dimension was representative of Science and diseases flow through that Dimension television R radio waves even through even e you know even uh technology and and flows through that fourth dimension brother bam says that was the traveling or communication Dimension where Spirits could travel it's something that you can't see as brother digs preached it's something you can't hear you can't you can't because you can't tune into that but brother bham would say that even Jesus Christ the son of God who died for your sins is standing there with his arms outstretched and brother bam says if you could ever get so in tune with God you'd see the appearance of Jesus and so it's a very real place it's a dimension man lives in this multi-dimensional environment and so we know that the struggles that come to us in life are not human they're not they may have human uh you know attributes you may have very substantive things that you could talk about and so uh yes thank you brother Brad thank you for reminding me that I did not send my slides this morning that's okay I'll get them sent really quick I'm not a good multitasker so you'll just have to bear with me here just for a moment um thank you Lord you love him amen amen and so notice this here it's a very real Dimension as let me make sure this is corrected as it'll be called something else but you can just display it it's fine it's a very real place so Paul says our our battle is not against flesh and blood but against princes and principalities and rulers of Darkness of this present world and then Paul says so you're to do what you're to take on the full armor of God so that you can withstand the battle that is Raging the one that you can't see now I know a lot of times we put flesh and blood on it we put you know addictions you think of people that are addicted to alcohol and then you treat that as a very substantive problem and so what will you do for that person you'll do everything you can if all you have to deal with is just the flesh and blood disease uh whether it's cancer doesn't matter what disease it is brother bam says what do doctors do they use their medicines they use chemo they use instruments that God has given them and brother bam says and if they can fully eradicate that sickness then praise God that's wonderful and he says but beyond that outward physical battle or physical tumor if you want to call it cancer and he says living on the inside of that is a supernatural being called an angel that has fallen from heaven and he's a demon spirit that is now living on the life and that life or that person is just the host or the house that he lives in now if it's that way with cancer wouldn't it be the same way with depression wouldn't it be the same way with anxiety wouldn't it be the same way with sex or pornography or drugs it doesn't matter what what what you want to name here today malice Envy jealousy Strife cont ition don't you know that Paul said for those things will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven murdering Envy malice hatred he puts hatred and Malice right there with murdering and so all of those things are only outward manifestations of an inward struggle or battle that is taking place in the in inside of a human vessel and then we call it alcoholism so then we give them self-help book and Alcoholics Anonymous and AA and all of those things nothing wrong if that's all the tools that you have to fight with and that's you better use what you got but I'm so glad God didn't just stop with human me men men's instruments and men's tools because many times doctors don't have an answer for cancer many times they don't have anything to say but go home and prepare your things because your life is going to end I'm so glad that my life is not in the hands of a doctor it's not in the hands of medicine it's not in the hands of science but my life is in the hands of Jesus and until he says it's over Satan can't even touch me Hallelujah you ought to rejoice in that today and May so we we use many different tools and instruments that we have to try to help the problem but what we need to recognize is that it's not a flesh and blood issue it is actually a supernatural battle that because of unbelief cuz brother Adam said that was the only only way the devil could have access to a Believer it's through the channel of doubt and he uses fear and oh boy does he ever use fear amen and he generates pictures images things that have never taken place oh yes and he used this fear in our mind of what would happen maybe what's waiting down for you and you know come on friends I'm not the only one who does that to you know you get a little pain in your body and and something weird and you you immediately like the devil just starts big creating an entire story of how your life's going to end and it because it's from another atmosphere it's from a we used this here you know the other day it's a demonic real I love chat GTP for what it can be used for good things I said chat create me an image of a demonic satanic Army that was bound at the river Euphrates in Revelations 9 and poof this came up like it did a pretty good job amen I showed that had that but before me that winter you or chat I realized after a while it was really getting some young people you know they staring at the image but this is what the devil does he creates and generates images in our mind things that have never taken place things are stories that will never unfold but the devil's job is to get you to believe them and then live in them and it's something that will never happen in your life it's something that will never oh you're God's you know what's going to happen because you did this and Satan begins to argue and begins to ra you know wrestle with your mind oh because you did now you got cancer now that's going to happen now your child's going to leave you yeah this is going to take place that child you know because you did this and you did that they'll never come to God they'll never serve the Lord you know you'll die in that condition you know this is what the devil does he generates and paints pictures and he reads dramas and stories and then we believe them and if we don't ever believe them then we start to commune with them in such a way to where it affects our attitude it affects our worship it affects how we treat other people come on and we get depressed and we get anxiety and then we go on pills and all the while it was never a flesh and blood struggle it was a supernatural battle taking place in another dimension Paul says we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities so you can look at addictions and think the problem is physical but it's not it's in another dimension it's in an underworld because it's a demon Spirit that's been given access through unbelief in that person's Spirit through some stronghold Maybe by doing something brother man said how do they get there brother Matt Maybe by you looking at the wrong thing and continuing to look and continuing to look and continuing to look and then you like Eve stick your head out from the protection of the word and then Satan builds a complex and then he uses that complex to infect the entire life and he'll destroy you if he can listen friends I realized a long time ago the devil can never take me out of Heaven because my soul's already been translated there and one day my body will be there but what he will try to do is destroy my life here on Earth so that I can't serve him in the way that God's ordain me to serve him and so we as Believers need to understand these aren't Flesh and Blood issues drugs addictions and you take that person who tries so hard to overcome that yet they go back to it and you try to help them and you try to help them you do everything you pour some of your life into them praying for them believing for them and if you could if you could you would deliver them of that drug addiction amen if you could you would push a button and it'll all be gone no different than you would cancer or any other kind of disease that's right yeah amen but the way that God has so structured it it takes the individual it takes the person with their own free moral agency his brother brandham is praying for a man and he you can go and listen to one of the most powerful sermons uh I'm TR trying to remember the name I was just listening to it the evidence of of maybe it was the presence of God recognized and brother Adam comes to to that prayer line and he begins to talk to his sister and he and and he just stops right in the middle of of of discernment and he gets real soft somber and he says sister and he goes and grabs her by the hand and he says you got cancer and yes yes he says now Sister oh it's much worse than you think it is and he says and God can deliver you of that and he said now I can pray for you and he says and I could actually take that cancer and destroy it out of your life life and he says but I can't keep it gone am amen it'll take you confessing I am I will I do believe that Jesus heals me now it'll take your confession to hold on to that healing that God gives you praise God and so this is the way God designed it even in Jude we can look through this and you could find this that this is a real spiritual battle a real army we use this picture here to describe that just as there's an army of of demons I love this so much because in Revelations 9 we read it the other day and it and it depicted these uh what do we read 200,000,000 200 million demons you say brother Matt that sounds like a lot of demon Spirits yeah but I want you to catch something they have a number they're numbered there's actually a quantity but did you know the Bible doesn't give a quantity to angels in other words that may sound massive but my God Is Bigger the angels and the armies of the Living God are innumerable and David says he's the Army he's the god the Lord of hosts that word means the God of angels or the God of Angel Armies Hallelujah and so notice this here this is this is what you find even in the book of Jude you find this in Ezekiel and it speaks about Lucifer says you were the signant of perfection let me pull it up on mine says you were the signant of perfection full of wisdom perfect and Beauty you were e in the garden of God every precious stone was your covering you were an anointed Guardian cherub I placed you you were on the Holy Mountain of God in the midst of the stones of fire you walked you were blameless in your ways from the day you were created until unrighteousness was found in you so this is who your enemy is he was an anointed cherub you know brother mam says a lot about this in and greatest battle ever fall I could just preach a whole sermon on that but it was the anointed cherub you you say what is a demon spirit it's just a fallen angel even Jude speaks of this here and you know the scripture really well it says and the angels who did not stay within their own positions that King James says who did not keep their first estate of authority but left their proper dwelling he has kept in Eternal chains under gloomy Darkness until the Judgment of the great day amen did you know that even as there's angels that are Supernatural and then there's angels that are very natural as the Bible says Messengers and brother Adam picks that up about Messengers and he says notice unto the angel of the Church of Sardis right so you have you you have to realize that the Bible speaks of angelic supernatural beings as Angels but it also speaks of men who are messengers listen friends when you are carrying the message of God to people you are an angel messenger amen amen listen sometimes we it's not an Angel like a supernatural being but Angel simply means messenger and so a demon just as a person can be a messenger for the throne of God so also can people become Angels or let me tell you how the Apostle Paul says it he says even Satan does transform his Messengers into angels of light say who who are they some can be preaches yes that's right hello amen some can be people even brother Bandon when he talks about in Revelations 12 and it speaks about the dragon who was cast out the Michael the Archangel and all of this war that took place in heaven and then you go read Revelations 12 and it says and the dragon Drew with his tail and it took a third part of the angels of the Stars right amen hello somebody read your Bible do I have it there yeah it was Revelations 129 the Great Dragon was thrown down the ancient serpent but notice this pick this up here he says and the Great Dragon with it who's the dragon Lucifer the devil the serpent the enemy the anointed cherub don't think of a ghoulish you know kind kind of creature these are just descriptors the dragon it was his description but the Bible says he drew a third part of the stars with his tail but brother Brandon picks it up under prophetic vision and says it wasn't his t a i l it was his t a l e because it was his tail it was what he preached to them to get them to believe in brother ROM says an angel has free moral agency and it chose to believe Lucifer's lie and you know who brother brandham calls those third part he says notice Abraham's promise that your seed shall be as the stars of the heavens they're innumerable and your seed shall possess the Gate of your enemy and brother Brandon says notice who those stars were they were sons of Abraham and the dragon because he told them his tale is t l e he deceived a third part of the stars of Abraham and brother bham says it was those sons of Abraham who crucified Jesus was the third part of the stars of Heaven that Revelations 9 speaking of Amen so people listen people not talking to this about angels and demons somewhere in another dimension but those Spirits influence people and those people become messengers of God or messengers of Satan that's right amen second Peter two for if God did not spare Angels when they sin but cast them into hell and commit them in to change of Darkness to be kept into the Judgment the Great Dragon we read about it was cast down and so this is the the battle that that that is Raging this is what's taking place it's a it's a just for a moment a vision of heaven and a vision of Hell two influences and your life is caught in the middle amen and you will decide not if you will be influenced by an Angel you'll only decide what angel will influence you cuz you will under the influence of one or the other and notice this here as brother bam says light matter time and brother man begins to break down the seven dimensions and he says now light matter time our five senses even light being something that Thomas Edison didn't discover was electricity it was the electromagnetic field discovered way before him men knew even by lightning what was light it was something greater than what man could even today they don't they you can't harness the power in in the way that the the way that God ordained or designed it from the beginning we only have scratched the surface yes amen and the that what you see in this world with light light bulbs and lightning and and and and and all of those things are only a just a a shadow of what the real is so brother B says light matter and time and our five senses contact them dimensions and listen to what he say here brother digs read this on Wednesday night and our feeling contacts matter and so forth now but we have contact through science the fourth dimension as it was becoming because coming right through this P building right now comes pictures voices of radio we heard that and I won't do it again the Dick's phone playing the music but it's there all the time I want you to wake up to a reality here today that the voice of influence from hell is there all the time but I want you to also Rejoice that the influence and the vision and the voice from Heaven is there all the time brother Ram says notice what is that feeling that you get sometimes and you just do the wrong thing you don't know where it came from that came from an influence from hell and if you listen to that as James 2 says when lust every man is tempted when he is Led away after his own lust he's enticed but then when that's that's one thing none of us can can can get rid of that but you can stop it right there because then the Bible says but then when lust has conceived it brings forth sin and When sin is finished it brings forth death and so light matter in time our senses we have contact through the fourth dimension cuz coming right through this room right through this building right now is the voices of people and listen what brother vam says he says you ever feel that feeling you know you make a mistake and you don't even know where that came from he says then you notice other times you're in church and the the maybe just the music maybe just the singing maybe you're singing you know as brother Tony was singing it today all my life you have been faithful all my life you have been so so good your goodness is running and brother man says you feel that atmosphere you feel that he says all of the sudden out of nowhere you just feels like you just want to cry maybe at the preaching of the word and he says there's a something in you that's just belching just coming out and he says you just want to cry other times you want to shout it'd do you some good sometimes if you did sometimes you just want to get out of your seat and stand up and raise your hands and say Amen to the word of God brother B says what is that he says that's that other Angelic Dimension and you're bumping into it and he says what is it it's Angels trying to energize your faith he says they have a tube or Crystal that pick fix that up and he says so you see right in this building right now is live actions of people voices they're here we know it they're absolute the truth the only thing you do is they catch it I understand the mechanics of those things science has invented but we know that it proves us there's a fourth dimension let me get through some of this now The Fifth Dimension is where the sinner the unbeliever dies and goes to so brother Baron takes a long time to break this down and he says if you're a Christian if you're a Believer now not that you put your name on the book not that you shook a preacher's hand amen not that you just go to a message church but if you have died in Christ I'm not talking about you know so many times we point we want to point to so many things what what what was it you know that what what was the experience where I knew I was filled with the Holy Ghost and so many times we point to so well it was what maybe we want to point to experience es maybe a feeling a sensation that's all wonderful and God can do that in the book of Acts they were the Bible says that God confirmed them with signs and wonders but can I tell you just where my heart has been lately I think if we're going to point to any moment in time when when God changed our life we shouldn't look at some outward expression of emotion but we should be able to point down to an altar maybe not a physical one but a moment where you repented amen amen because you can have all the experiences in the world but if there's no repentance there's no change is that clear can I make that clear I'm not I'm not against experiences I'm not against people pointing to where they spoke in tongues that's wonderful I'm not pointing to you know to say anything against any sensation but I feel sometimes we've become like the Pentecostals who brother Ram says they were missing something and what were they missing they were missing an altar repentance where they died where they were changed where they lost their hatred they lost their malice they lost their jealousy they lost their eny amen come on somebody those things are important amen but if you're a Christian a real believer and you've been born again brother bam says when you breathe your last breath you go into that sixth Dimension and he says it's a paradise and and I was just hearing brother brandham just this morning and he says if you die and you're a Believer and you breathe your last breath you go into that sixth Dimension and he says it's a place of paradise where the dead in Christ go and he says and he says and you live in a Celestial body waiting for the day for the Lord to come and return in a Rapture yes amen and he said and and then you go back and pick up that mortal body you put in the ground Paul says it this way he says that when you a Believer dies he says when a Believer dies and you bury them you're literally burying a seed in the ground amen and he says and at the resurrection that seed that you buried will come up out of the ground oh friends I just am so glad that I can say I've been buried in Jesus amen I've been brought to newness of life and he says you go back he says you come back into a glorified body and you'll rule with Christ in the Millennium for a thousand years in a new Heaven and a new Earth brother bam says but if you're a sinner and you die and you say what was it brother Ram says if you never heeded the call not talking about whether you're on a bar stool this morning you could be sitting in a church and you never surrendered you say well I don't know really where it ever happened do I have it do I don't I don't I don't have an exact moment exact spot you know where I felt something that's okay you know where I I didn't feel any kind I didn't jump and run around the church that's okay but do you I want to ask you today do you have a moment where you know that your life changed amen where you repented of your sins as Peter says men and Brethren they said what shall we do repent that's the first step right amen repent I just feel the weight of this moment here as I just come to this part of my sermon because I think of how much with realities I have now of people who have lost what would I say to them now what could I have done what what words could I have spoken what what things could we say to so present Jesus in such a way to to present him and communicate him into such a way that would make a a sinner come under condemnation of their sins and want to serve him the rest of their life Prophet says if you die and you don't know the Lord you never received Jesus in your heart you never received him as your lord and savior then you go to a place when you breathe your last breath called The Fifth Dimension it's where the souls of the wicked are imprisoned awaiting the day of that great white Throne judgment to be judged according to the Deeds that were in your body done in your body brother Bram says oh I got it here and I'll read it The Fifth Dimension is where the sin of the unbeliever dies and goes to it's kind of well the horrible Dimension when a Christian dies he goes to the sixth and God is in the seventh you see when a Christian when he dies he goes under the altar of God right into the presence of God under the altar I love this and he's at rest to break it down when a man has a nightmare he's not altogether asleep neither is he awake he's between sleep and awake and that's what makes him have a horrible shaking and screaming because he's not asleep he's not awake and to take that shows where a man goes when he dies unconverted he's lived his time up he's dead on Earth and he can't go into the presence of God because he's not fit to go there without the blood and he's caught he's caught he's stuck he's in a nightmare he can't go into the presence of God to rest he can't come back to earth because his time's up he's in a nightmare and there he stays until the day of judgment a horrible thing to be and oh if I could just say this here today and let my voice ring out and and say that if you if you do anything in your life doesn't matter what education you get Release Yourself of your goals and worldly Ambitions just for a moment and understand that meeting Jesus is the most important thing that you can ever have in your life and nothing will mean anything there on that day other than do you have do you know him prophet of God says oh when I was a little boy he says I saw a vision of hell and brother Bron begins to talk about it how that he was shot and he doesn't tell it many places but he says I think it's in present stage and he says I he says I was there I was shot laying in a field and he says he says I seen that vision of hell and you remember he talks about those those women that were there and and and and he says painted like a wolf just paint all over their face what brother bam says you remember years later I think it was just maybe just not very long after that you know he has this Vision but but after he tells the story just later he's at in two on it I think it's JC Pennies and he sees those women coming down the escalator speaking Spanish and brother bam says and that Vision broke again and I could see them that makeup that was on their eyes you see you reflect something you reflect one place or the other place your life is just a reflection where you live here will determine where you will live there it's only a representation do you live in heaven here or do you live in hell here brother Adam says I've never told this before he says I was laying there shot dying in a field and and he says the only ple I could say to God is a little boy was Lord I've never committed adultery that's what brother bandam says he says a little boy even 15 years old he said I you know I tried everything I could to live right he says I couldn't hardly get a word out of my mouth blood you know just gushing he says Lord I H I've tried everything I can do to live right and brother bam says and he says I was I was laying there dying in a hospital I always knew there was a God and he says I remember that first prayer that I ever tried to pray the only thing I could say he says the only thing he said I could say was Lord I've just tried to serve you the best I've tried to live clean the best that I could and he says then laying there the do doctor walked away from the room and he says and then I fell into it and he saids say I started sinking below the bed and he says and I sank and I begin to fall and he says as I fell he says I could just he says I could just he says it would just looked like so dark all around me just darkness everywhere and he says I began to holler for Papa but there was no papa there I begin to holler for Mama and he says but there was no mama there and brother B there was no mama there to pray for me no mama there to help me there was no God there amen to talk to brother bam says oh I it was just he he says it was just endless just falling and falling and falling and a nightmare burning blazing hell and the prophet says falling I thought oh my over and over like this I he says I got into a place somewhere there was smoke and and he says there was fire and it was dark and there was just sickness all around oh he says such a fing it was you never imagine this but brother bam says this is what death felt like feels like for an unbeliever and he says I he says I could just see those women coming running up to me isn't it amazing that both hell and heaven there's women running up to him but these women are not the women in white gowns with long flowing hair saying our precious brother brother bam says these women had makeup mascara just all painted all over their faces and he says he says I could see them pain on their eyes remember that's been 45 years about 40 years ago anyhow going they was going ooh ooh and brother brandham says I stopped and I said am I to be here forever forever I said oh God if you'll let me me out of this place if you'll deliver me from this place I'll serve you my whole life he says I'll never be ashamed of you again Lord he says the first thing you know I felt myself coming back up starting to raise back up and he says the doctor was alarmed cuz my heart was beaten 17 times a minute I'd unbled on my blood out and everything I was laying in my old Blood Brother bam de begins to tell Al he goes to JC Pennies and he sees them speaking and he says brother sister let me tell you something it may seem funny now but once you get there it's a serious thing don't you ever go that way amen amen me as an old man a minister I preached around the world got millions of friends get away from the things of the world and if there's something in you and you still want to act like the world and do the things of the world remember you're none of gods you might be a church member right but until that deep calls to a deep and you respond brother bam talks about Lazarus I'm just taking here just a couple minutes talks about Lazarus and and how that the rich man in Lazarus and there's a goal fixed between us and brother B says I know people claim they pray you out of those places but don't you never believe it that's contrary to the word of God the way the tree tree leans is the way it falls Jesus said there was a gulf when when a man died went to hell he could not never come to Heaven no man ever crossed it and never would that settles it as far as I'm concerned when Jesus said that was it that's all of it so just remember now somebody say now now is your chance amen and it may be your last opportunity you say to me preacher is there remembrance of hell do you remember things oh yeah oh yeah Jesus said that there was he said talks about Lazarus the rich man and he says that you know Abraham he he says the rich man lifted up his eyes and in hell he saw Abraham and Lazarus in his bosom and said remember in your lifetime so there's Remembrance in heaven in hell as as how the law he says what an awful thing it would be to know that the great meetings that they had sat in and heard the mighty sermons of the anointed Ministers of God do we I stopped when I read this I said Lord are we cognizant of how many times Grace knocks on our door are we aware of how many times Grace just keeps reaching out trying everything to pull you in and while Heaven's pulling hell's pulling and brother bam says oh he says don't you ever think of how many times how many sermons they've heard how many anointed meetings they've been in to see the Wonders God's performed amongst his people and then remember all of those things and still somehow be lost it would haunt them forever brother Brandon begins to talk about this and he says and in this Vision I believe I was caught to that sixth Dimension looking back down here I could see back see sight isn't exactly with the eyes that's Earthly but sight is a greater thing the sight that they have there their contact is far beyond any contact that our natural senses would contact so notice as brother Brandon begins to describe this place and then brother bam has a vision I know we've talked about it here before I'm just going to close on this he talks it's not a vision he actually talks to a a girl and he and he's in a he's in a trying to think of the city there in Ohio and and brother benham's there at the insane asylum and and and he says and I'm there he says and oh man people just out of their minds he talks about you know one guy over the over against the wall just banging his head against a concrete wall and blood coming out some of them in straight jackets and he says and and he says they were just a haunted house just I sounds so haunted and he says oh I just began to get overwhelmed me a preacher a prayer of the sick and I'm there to pray for people and he says and I stopped and I said Lord where do I even start and brother Ram says a little girl said sir I wish you would start with me and brother bandam says you little woman and he says you surely you're not a patient here she says oh brother brandom I I am I wish you'd hear my story for a moment I thought I thought about that story so many times he preaches that message from that time and I thought to myself did she ever imagine did she ever as a little girl did she ever imagine while she sat in church maybe in Sunday school and her mother telling her about the things of God did she ever imagine when she was playing with dolls imagine and picturing her life how she would be married and have children and live in a home could she have ever imagined that her life would end and be in an insane asylum out of her mind alcoholic a prostitute had solded herself on the street did she ever imagine she would be there i' thought about that so many times sitting at that stoplight and there's a man on the side of the stoplight and he's holding a sign a beard you know down and scraggly and a disheveled look and I just have so many times looked into the eyes of that person and I thought where was you when you was when you was just a little boy amen amen you know many of them never would want to end up where they're at amen but the cruelty of sin got a hold of their life sold them a pize and they believed it right used messengers of Satan called friends amen amen and you thought they were friends and they weren't and every time you fed on that and you fed on that and you fed on that you got in their company and you got in their company listen friends it doesn't have to be a physical friend it could be a video game it could be a website it could be an app that you download I don't care what it is there's some Spirit that's constantly trying to feed you and fil and and and influence you in some way to believe that lie amen I never would even imagine he thinks to himself I never would even imagine I'd be here addicted to some drug begging on the side of the street but I just stopped for a moment and thought God no man no man would not have an opportunity of mercy no human no life no man no woman somewhere in their life somewhere God's grace reached out to grab them amen and maybe they never turned it down or said I don't want nothing to do with it or ah maybe another time may they I'm not saying that they rejected it but the prophet of God said you being apathetic to it or just well you know maybe not right now he said that's the same as rejecting him yeah amen and he says you she says oh I wish youd listen to my story he says I she says I was I was raised in a good home had a good mother taught me not to do wrong and to shun evil and turn away from sin she said it and she says oh but I got mixed up with the wrong boy got mixed up with the wrong boy and you know he's preaching from that time and brother bam says somewhere you could point back and say there that's when it all changed amen and he she says I got mixed up with the wrong boy and he slipped something in my drink and she says the next thing I know I become an I threw my arms out of him the next thing I know I became an alcoholic and and she says then they pick me up and took me to some Catholic institution good Shepherd's home and converted me to a Catholic then she goes from there and you know has a little start kept starting that's what brother Ram says you keep starting so many people just start and and he says then they reformed from there to a Protestant and she says then took me to the Baptist church and then they released me she says and maybe a year or two you know I was okay but then I found myself right back into alcohol she says then I I was in the correction intitute for maybe served a year or two in prison chaplain tried to reach me changed me back to a Protestant and she says and I come out and try it again but I went right back into it what is it that they just can't break away from it they Tred so hard triy so hard she tried so many starts brother brandom says this lady he says what about your mother dead what about your father dead I said well what do you think they would think about you now she says oh oh if I could only go back if I could only go back to that time when she had a loving mom and a loving dad loving home oh if I could only go back I said oh a lovely young woman like you don't you desire to be married and have babies and mothers and so forth she she said oh I would love to sir but look at me what can I offer to anyone I said sis oh I love this so much there's only one thing you can offer she says what's that brother bam says sister she says look at me what could I offer them and brother bham says brother bham says she says they wouldn't have me they wouldn't have me and brother bam says oh but the Lord Jesus he says the Lord Jesus will have you and she says what can I offer to him and brother bam says there's only one thing you have to offer him your soul she says oh he wouldn't receive it I said yes he will she said how do you know he would I tried I said yeah you're just turning Pages she says oh but what could he even do with me I said he'd make a lady out of you she said not me I'm too far gone oh how many people have felt that way in their life and believe the lie of the devil I'm too far going it's too late I done messed up brother Ram says oh no sister he can take you back to the time when you was a virgin innocent girl the blood of Jesus Christ is sufficient and Powerful to transform The viest Sinner to a blood-washed saint Guiltless before God you ought to give the Lord a hand clap of Praise right there he's worthy of it the blood of Jesus [Applause] blood of Jesus prophet of God begins to tell and he tells about and I won't I won't save time because I'm about to lose it now I got 13 minutes about now is about 1 hour need to close and Prophet Prophet begins to describe that other place he tells about it I won't take all the time but it tells about it I love it so much I'm just going to read just a portion of it I I I won't I'll just paraphrase it he talks about that place and he heard that voice say keep pressing keep pressing you remember that how many remember that brother man's laying on his bed and oh Lord he says would you voice spoke to me and said would you like to look beyond the curtain he says oh it would help me so much and he says and there I I begin to fall asleep and he says I don't know asleep awake almost like Paul in 2 Corinthians 12 you know whether a vision or not I don't know and he says I he says I was there and he says I I placed my hands behind my head and begin to relax on my pillow The Voice begin to say keep pressing you're just starting I laid there pondering those words I thought I again that voice said press the battle keep going keep going keep going brother bam says oh I'm home homesick and blue begins to sing I want to see Jesus I would like he says I would like to hear those Harbor bells chime it would brighten my path and banish all fears Lord let me look past the curtain of time brother man says there was what happened he says I can't say when the body out of the body whether it was translation I don't know it was like it was unlike any Vision I'd ever seen I could see a place which I was taken I could see myself laying back there on the bed looking at my body and he says and I thought this is a strange thing he says there was a great number of people they came running to me crying oh our precious brother am first came young women apparently in their early 20s as they would embrace me and said our precious brother young men of Brilliance bright and he said Young Manhood with eyes glistening stars like stars in their eyes and he says on a darken night white teeth you might have yellow ones here but they'll be white there amen hallelujah amen and he says like white teeth do glisten in the sun men begin to brilliant strength and strong begin to run and embrace me and said our precious brother I noticed I had become too young also brother B looks at his own body and he's young also and he says oh what is this I looked myself turned look back at my body old body laying there on the bed and he says my hands and says I don't understand this I begin to try to comprehend brother BR says I begin to try I begin to realize there was no yesterday here think about that there's no tomorrow here there's no yesterday here there's no problems there's no worry there you're not troubled over anybody either amen you're not troubled over anyone brother B says as a multitude he says and he says I begin to young women I discovered there was a great love that overwhelmed me and no physical attraction is in the human behavior I noticed these young women their hair down waist to their waistline skirts went down to their feet he says after this here come hope here was his first wife hugged me and said my precious brother another young woman hugged me I turned and hugged and young woman I don't understand this is entirely different I don't want to go back to that old body on that bed a voice spoke to me and said this is what you preached this is the Holy Ghost Hallelujah this is perfect love nothing can enter here without it prophet of God begins to try to describe this place he tells it another place he he tells about he says oh what a day that will be and he talks about his mother who's went on before and he says oh I he says I could just imagine my mind on Resurrection morning he says I begin to think about it and he says the faces of those who I've loved so dear what a difference he says on that morning when we shall see our loved ones oh to watch what they'll be then all the Affliction will be be taken away you ought to Rejoice all the Mars of suffering will be done no more place of death No More Tears the resurrection promises there will be no more funerals no more patting the baby on the cheek that's like a piece of stone where the undertakers and bombed and pushed out he's talking about his little baby and put P so forth and not even look natural it'll never be needed again I think of myself I think of it when I see them standing Yonder our mothers our friends our loved ones and Immortal bodies watching their character seeing how they conduct themsel with that sweetness and quietness no more nervousness no more frustrations standing see them standing in the likeness of the Lord that'll be all each one of us in our minds anticipating that longing longing for that hour of consolation when we meet them each one thinking of their loved one maybe their mother that's gone what a day when you see her again and to Dad and to brother and to all the loved ones brother says oh I'm thinking of that Resurrection morning perhaps the first one will come to me will be my little Sharon Rose no brother B says she won't be shaking because the devil can't enter that place no menitis can ever touch that land she won't be waving goodbye to me those little blue eyes will be dancing as she throws her arms and screams Daddy I'll be glad to see her to know that she'll never die again to know that it's all all over why I preach Resurrection so hard is because the hope that the resurrection brings is that all that I've ever loved will be in that place on that day all that I've Ever Wanted will be in that place on that Resurrection morning amen can I go just a little further oh he says then I'll see mother and Billy and my boy and lots of memories that'll Linger on he talks about his mother and he says down the road and I just want to skip some of this ought to be a joy to see your she won't have bony hands neither will them cheeks be sunk in she'll be standed in the celestial body the Queen of Heaven of a Queen of Heaven A mother her black eyes black as Raven's Wings will be dancing with joy she won't be stooped over or that devil of TB will never enter that land but Immortal will stand in his likeness I suppose next coming up after Sharon after mama he says here will come Edward we called him humpy for a short name this is what he called him brother brandham says little little little guy listen to how brother Bram describes this man's life on this side of life was troubled on this side of life had issues disease but brother bandam says but over there he says oh he was the first the big nine link chain chain of the Brandon family he was the first link to break the one next to me Al see Edward running to me he died as a boy 1900 years old when I take him back by his hand I'm sure will have lots of things to talk about about Boyhood because we were Chums we stuck together he let me wear his suit and his things like real brothers be it'll be a pleasure to see him and I can hear him say something like this I love this he says I can hear him say something like this did you get my word Bill brother bam says we were working on a cattle ranch at the time of my go at the at the time of his brother Edward dying working on a cattle ranch and he says Bill did you get my word in the hospital when I was dying I sent word back tell Bill everything is all right I'll be glad to say yes I got your word out on the Prairie Eddie then I suppose next will come my dad he was the next link to go I think Charles was next a younger brother he had an automobile accident just a little boy he was always drug his right leg as he walked you know when I see him he won't be dragging that right leg anymore it'll all be done away with will stand in the splended Splendor of a young man he'll say to me oh he'll say to me something like this as he smiles he'll say yes Bill there are no accidents up there I remember the night before I was taken in the automobile accident bill you talked to me standing in the little Arch where a little humble home looking on the top of the eight he says looking above you now you talked about the Lord just a few hours before me going and you were in the pull pit preaching about him when I left then will come dad oh I can see him though he's giv me Min of hard weapons Prophet said just exactly what I needed but I'll see that shock of black wavy hair more brilliant than ever on that day and he'll look at me and say my boy you know Daddy will never get up from the table here anymore hungry to let his children eat for we have plenty here there's never a want here to see him when he would work at some 50 or 75 cents a day and then get up from the table so children could eat go back and work again he worked so hard till his shirt would sunburn to his back and Mom would cut it Loose with scissors I'll hear him say something like this bill you remember that night you and brother George come to pray for me when I was going you know I told Mama that there were two white angel standing at the bed and a red Angel at the foot and the red Angel was trying to get me but the white angel stood between him they finally packed me home Bill oh he says then also the next in the link to go come Howard I'll see Howard as we Chum together across the lands everywhere called to be a minister great personality but his associates kept him back last talk I that I had with him he said bill when I go I saw him going by Vision about 14 years before he went told him I seen pop Markus grave and say that they would say that and say that was the next and he said there's one thing I want you to do for me this is what it Howard says to him I have muddied up my life I've been married and everything I don't know what's happened I said but Howard do you believe him now this is says he's dying it muddied up his life he says but Howard did you believe him now do you believe him now he said with all that's within me I believe him and about two or three days before he left he made his peace with God brother Neville and them said there's one thing I want you to do when I go Bill have them sing for me he'll understand and say Well done God will understand your muddied up life God will understand all of the mistakes that you ever made in your life that you think you made a mess out of it but one day he'll understand and he'll wipe every tear tear away from your eye oh I believe before I shake Howard's hand he'll I'll hear him stop and look at me and say Bill he understood oh friends let me just preach here as I as I close just say this last thing worse than that place that we described couldn't imagine myself in that place brother Bram describes dark smoke fire pit sickness ooh ooh ooh those voices could imagine anything worse but can I just preach and maybe if you're unsaved and and maybe you've never surrendered and submitted to God let me preach to you there's a there's something worse than going to hell it's having to be there and see my loved ones it's having to be there there something worse than going to hell to see people that I knew I could have made a difference in their life my voice could have been used as a voice of con not of it's okay and God will tolerate you and God loves you and it's all right but I could have been used as a voice of conviction amen I could have been used as a voice to say get right brother get right with God before it's too late you say brother Matt worse than going to hell there's something worse than going to hell it's those that my life influenced cuz whether you realize it or not your life is influencing those around you come on somebody and help me preach our life has a has has a testimony what our convictions are what standards we hold what we allow what we don't allow listen our church attendance we show people what is important in our life and it's a Ministry can I get an amen from the whole church there's something worse than going to hell it's those who would be there with me worse worse couldn't imagine the opportunities I had at people the opportunities I had to preach the opportunities I had to say something the opportunities I had to reach out to them it'd be worse than going to hell oh but can I just stop here for a moment and say there's something better also than going to heaven you say brother Matt something better than going to hell yeah but there's also something better than going to heaven you say I couldn't imagine what would be better than going to heaven brother Matt I just feel like sometimes I want to be there so bad and just if I could just cross the finish like oh it's going to be wonderful my brother no more sickness no more sorrow no more pain no more backache no more heartache but can I tell you there's something greater it will be all of my family and all of my children and all of my loved ones it won't be what is there it'll be who is there I say God I claim every person in my life do you want to do that today I claim every person under the blood of Jesus to be there on that day with me oh stand to your feet and give God praise he's worthy of it give him a hand clap of Praise give him a real praise offering this morning church Hallelujah musicians could you come brother bam says oh after that will come brother Seward brother Frank brother Bry brother George Arc all the resur Resurrection means a lot to me I'm anticipating on that great crowning hour and as the light begins to spread we'll know as we are known we'll understand and we'll remember our acquaintance the one that's been there you got wavered loved ones Amen Let me give you the words of Jesus lay up your Treasures in Heaven I got Treasures on this Earth say brother Matt what are you doing everything in my life the way I live my convictions that I hold the standards that I hold are for one reason I'm laying up my treasures not in this Earth but I'm laying them up in heaven amen prophet of God says and many he says oh there will be that light it begins to spread you imagine it on that day as light begins to spread and brother bam says then we will be known I love this we'll know as we are known we'll understand how many want to have that how many want to say Lord I'll lay aside everything in this life as brother Adams told how many will do it as brother Adam's told lay aside everything until you get perfect love then let me do it God prophet of God comes to that other dimension and says whatever you do lay aside anything but don't miss this don't miss this moment when all Darkness flees and all trouble flees and no more hospitals and no more funerals and no more sorrow and no more trouble oh it's a wonderful place oh but can I read you this favorite part of this quote brother bam says and many there'll be many there that day when we look around that we didn't even think would be there amen for you know it's at that time that I believe that the bread that we have cast upon the human Troubled Waters will return to us on that day when we see the effects of Our Testimony on people that we didn't understand their actions towards it they'll probably be there what a day to see the seeds that we have SED not even thinking that they would do but here they are would you close your eyes and raise your hands with with me here today every head bowed and say God I'm going to sew my seed I heard a vision I Heard a Voice from Heaven I've caught a vision of Heaven this morning Lord I've caught a vision of how important that place is how special that place is it's not that I don't want to go to hell it wasn't hell it was that there was no God there so God today I'm casting my bread upon the human Troubled Waters might be children might be an uncle might be an aunt might be a dad a mother a father and say God I am laying up my treasures in heaven where moths and rusts don't corrupt where thieves don't break in nothing could ever take them from me that day prophet of God has given a voice there at that end of that he says I he says I begin to move from that joyful every head bowed now every eye closed as I began to move from that beautiful joyful place as far as my eyes could see people were coming towards me to embrace me suddenly I was back on the bed again I said oh God and I wonder if maybe you'd pray this I'm going to give you an opportunity to identify and lift the hand and say Lord that's my prayer maybe you'd pray with the prophet and say oh God help [Music] me never let me compromise with the word let me stay straight on the word I don't care what anyone else does God let me press on to that beautiful joyful place I am more convinced than ever in my life that it will take perfect love to enter that place there was no jealousy there there was no tiredness no sickness no old age no death only Supreme Beauty whatever you do lay aside everything until you get perfect love get to where you can love everybody even every enemy no matter if the plane is rocking the Lightning's flashing The Guns of the enemy are upon you these things do not matter get perfect love if you're not saved accept Jesus Christ as your savior I'll give you that opportunity today I'm not asking if you ever had a shouting experience or running experience or speaking in tongu that's wonderful but I'm asking you do you ever do you have a moment where you said God I Repent I Repent of my sins I ask you to purge me of everything that's unlike you oh listen friends today is the hour make your calling an election sure work out your own salvation with fear and trembling the Bible says whatever you do if you don't know him accept Jesus as your savior right now if you not been born again baptize in water be baptized don't wait if you've not received the baptism of the Holy Spirit receive it now press on press on Church oh I raise hands and say I'm pressing Lord I want to press on to perfect love which will take me to that beautiful place and joyful place just beyond the curtain of time I want to go there Lord It's a real place real people real life real Joy oh yes Lord that's my prayer God I I don't know how us to stop other than just to pray and say Lord I raise my hands say that's my prayer Jesus I want to lay aside everything in my life there is nothing more valuable there is nothing more important there's nothing that means anything more oh as the song says only what you do for Christ will last time will come time is fleeting time is going and only what you do for Christ last want to surrender now I wonder if you'd want to surrender fresh and say Lord I just want to have a this January we're still just at the beginning of a of the year I want to close yesterday's chapter oh how many want to do that and say God I got yes last year was maybe full of troubles and things I didn't do and things I messed up on and allow the devil but I want to close that book I want to say like Paul I forget those things which are behind me and I want to press let this year be a year of of more dedication more sincerity surrendering and dying out to myself Lord I want a fresh consecration let me be at an altar again maybe just the altar of my heart to have a fresh renewal let it be Jesus the blood of Jesus you say brother Matt I might have might have send my dead Grace away might have might have been me too far away from God listen friends it's never too late God it's God says it's never Grace is still here Mercy is still here he's
