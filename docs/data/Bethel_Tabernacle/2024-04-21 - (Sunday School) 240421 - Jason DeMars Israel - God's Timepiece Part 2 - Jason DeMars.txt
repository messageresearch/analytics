========================================

uh Israel God's time piece and uh the last time as we talked about how God had promised that he would bring Israel a second time uh back into the land that he has promised and that there is a number of promises that go along with that and that's going to be what we look at in future times this time I want to go through Romans 9 through 11 as much as I possibly can get through this time in order to show what God's purpose is for Israel see um through her church history you know sometimes we take things for granted through church history um the Catholic Church the Orthodox Church even some uh Old Line Protestants believe that the church actually replaces Israel in God's program God turned from Israel and now went to the Gentiles meaning he will never return back to Israel that's the Viewpoint of of historically of Catholics Orthodox lutherans Presbyterians that we are living in a uh some sort of Millennium now and this Millennium everything is spiritualized and the purpose of the church is to christianize the world and once the church fully christianized all the nations as in even their governments then Christ will return and set up the new Heaven and the new Earth so this is so sort of um the idea that many of the churches it's it's part of the falling away and so God purposed to restore the church back to the original faith and as we as we read as we read last time in the scriptures and as we'll see Paul speaking is that God turns away from Israel he blinds them so that he can turn to deal with the Gentile bride yes of course there's still Jews that come to Faith get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you know will be raised up and raptured and so forth Absol absolutely but it's just a small Remnant God will turn again to deal with Israel as soon as the Gentile bride is out of the way so obviously as we start this Romans N9 Paul is coming with the understanding that the Jews have rejected Christ as we as we as you read through the book of Acts we know that thousands became Christians but even within that they they were so dedicated to the law that they would hardly leave the Gentiles alone just to receive the Holy Ghost and walk in the spirit they wanted many of those Jewish Christians quote unquote as we call them that turned to Christ and that were in the church in Jerusalem wanted to force Judaism the the observance of the law on the Gentiles and we understand we know that that God sent Paul and Barnabas to the Gentiles he never sent them with a message to convert to Moses he sent them with the message of faith in Christ that they were to be be the CH become the children of Abraham who is justified by faith not by The Works of the law and so again there was that battle of the Jews against the truth even though they came they came in to the church brother brother brother Paul the Apostle Paul calls them Brethren who have come out snuck into the church unawares that they've come in to spy out our Liberty in Christ and so it's hard for an Israeli to move away from the law and to come into Christ they always want to be under the law and they've remained this way even if we look at history 70 AD 70 AD is when Judaism when the Jewish religion Ended as we know it there's no more there's no one on the earth who's following the Torah anymore you say yes the Jews are where's their Temple where is the levitical sacrifices they're not what they have done is in in response to the Gospel of Jesus Christ they have created their own version of religion that they've been cast out of the land that's what happened when Paul is writing in Romans this is before the temple was over when Paul writes the book of Hebrews this was before the temple was destroyed so Temple worship was still going on but 70 AD was prophesied by the Lord Jesus Christ that they would be carried out out of the land why because they rejected the Messiah all right so that's where we pick up Romans 9:1 I say the truth in Christ I lie not by conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost that I have great heaviness and cons continual sorrow in my heart for I could wish that myself were a cursed from Christ for my brethren my Kinsmen according to the flesh so this is Paul's heart for the Lost he knows his Brethren according to the flesh the nation of Israel is lost and he's saying I would sacrifice my own self for them to be saved he says who are Israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises whose are the fathers and whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God bless forever amen see Paul even at this point in time speaks of them that the promises belong to them it's not as though this they rejected the Messiah and God has cast them away forever no they're still God's chosen people they the adoption belongs to them or the placing as children of God the glory the covenants the giving of the law the service of God even at that time they were still in the temple and the promises so they they are blessed and as we remember all through Paul's Epistles when he speaks of the Gospel it says to the Jews first and also to the Greeks the gospel was to go first to the Jewish people what did they do in the book of Acts at the end of books of Acts what do we witness Paul says you've counted yourself Unworthy of the Gospel so because of that I I I wipe the dust off of my feet and we go to the Gentiles who will hear it gladly so all all of these things are placed there and planted there in the scriptures for us to see that God is was turning away from them this is where Paul is breaking it down for us making it clear to us what is happening if Paul wants to say God has done with Israel this is where he's going to say it he's done with Israel forever the church replaces them if he wants to say that he certainly can say that and this is the place where he explains it not as though the word of God hath taken none effect for they are not all Israel which are of Israel neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called again pointing out that just because a person is of the Seed of Abraham doesn't mean they're the children of Abraham Jesus speaks about this in John chapter 8 if you remember he calls them the children of the devil and the word he uses is techon techan speaks of a close relationship and fellowship a and uh sort of like the I the concept of the Apple doesn't fall far from the tree in other words you take after you take after the nature of your father Jesus said tells the Pharisees you're of your father the devil you're the the techan of the devil you're not the techan of Abraham because Abraham didn't do this Abraham didn't act this way yes I know that you're The Offspring of Abraham but not all Israel is Israel that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah will have a son again Abraham had a number of children apart from Sarah but none of them were to obtain the promise only the elected in the family were to obtain the promise Esau by right should have obtained the promise but he wasn't elected that's what he's going to talk about here and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that cth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God God forbid for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth mercy so salvation is based on God's choosing God's predestinated plan it's not based on your will it's not based on your works but it's based on God's Sovereign will making his choice and saying I will have mercy on this one and I will pass over this one now now people will say what kind of God is that that would just choose to have mercy on some well here's the problem with that line of thinking is that Mercy is not deserved Mercy is undeserved to get what we deserve don't think anyone wants that all of us have sinned all of us have fallen short of the glory of God all of us are worthy of hell but and and the fact is that all of us left to our own selves would turn away and reject and hate God but instead God by his Mercy comes and says I I will I will open your heart to the word of God that you can receive it and I can have mercy on you for the scripture saith unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth therefore hath he Mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth so he's saying I choose the one to have mercy and I choose to harden the hearts of others see this is God he predestines to Salvation and he also pred predestines to damnation that's his sovereignty thou will say then unto me why do he yet find fault for who has resisted his will this is Paul's answer and ultimately this is God's answer back to us neid oh man who art thou that repliest against God shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast Thou made me thus and again we often take these verses and we just apply it to personal salvation that's correct we should do that however if you see the bigger picture of Romans 9 through 11 you can understand it a little bit better when you see that he's actually still talking about Israel and the Gentiles naid oh man who are you that reply against God shall the thing form say to him that formed it why hast Thou made me thus in other words had not the PO power over the clay of the same l to make one vessel un honor and another un dishonor what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had a four prepared unto Glory even us whom he hath called not of the Jews only but also of the Gentiles now I want to I want to take a minute to speak about this we I talked about it last time and I want to bring it up again he Paul writes of make sure that you give we give no offense to the Jews to the Gentiles or to the Church of God so when we look at the world the world looks at there's this nation there's that Nation there's Jews there's Muslims there Christians God looks at it this way Jews gentiles Nations the Church of God those are the three things that we should keep in our mind God is dealing with the Church of God now God has a purpose for the Jews he's brought them back to their Homeland but he's not dealing with them in Redemption of course there's individuals I I know I know I know some that have received the message that have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they're Jewish that's that's the that's that's a rem that's a small amount but as a whole as a nation God is not bringing salvation to the Jews he will do that as soon as the Church of God the Gentile bride is called up in the Rapture then he turns the two witnesses come and the Seal of the Holy Ghost comes to the 144,000 but now he's not dealing with them that way with Gentile Nations how we we know not only the Gentiles but also the Jewish political all these nations are ruled by the devil the Jewish nation is not yet ruled by the Messiah I wish it was if it was they'd be all Christians but it's not they're all under the the prince of the power of the air you can read go read in the Book of Revelation Jerusalem is called the city that is spiritually Sodom and gomorra and to this day every year they have a gay pride event right in Jerusalem so God says it's spiritually Sodom my goodness so even Israel politically speaking is under the control of the enemy though God has a purpose but he has a purpose with America and Russia and everyone it's it's going to be Destruction for all it's as though God is going to the Messiah is going to sweep down and say oh there's my servant Netanyahu and the knesset you all are my you are all the people that I chose no that's not what he's doing it's going to be Christ and the bride that return and who is going to rule over it's not going to be the knesset it's not going to be Netanyahu it's going to be the TW Apostles that will rule over the TW tribes of Israel all right so here as we look at this understand those three types of people Jews Gentiles and the church the called out ones they're called out of Gentiles they're called out of Jews to form one new man you can read that in Ephesians 2 and three and these are the these those are that's the place where the Holy Spirit that's probably the better way to put it is that's the place the holy spirit is working holy spirit's not falling upon Jews right now God is working to set things in order but the B ISM of the Holy Ghost is not available there unless they come to this seventh Angel's message and receive it then they can get the baptism of the Holy Ghost but through the to the Jewish Nation spiritually speaking God is not working with them that way Romans 9:25 as he saith also in Hosea I will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved that's that's us we were not beloved he's called us beloved not yes yes Gentiles but Gentiles who repent and receive the Gospel who become the called out ones and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them you are not my people there shall they be called the children of the Living God that's the church Isaiah also crith concerning Israel though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea a Remnant shall be saved for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth I believe this is speaking of the future still in that time just that short period of time three and a half years where he deals with Israel through those two witnesses it would be a short work but only even then though there be millions and there are millions of Israelites today still only a Remnant will be saved think about what 144,000 is there it would only be considered a blip on the radar in Israel if you were to spread that out throughout Israel not me it's not a huge massive amount of people amongst their population and Isa and as Isaiah said before except the Lord of sabba oath had left us a seed we had been as Sodom and made like unto gomorah what shall we say then that the Gentiles which followed not after righteousness we were pagans as brother brandham said we had a we had a club on our backs and we were Idol worshippers we have attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of Faith but Israel which followed not after the law of righteousness hath not attained to the law of righteousness that's strange I thought they were following the law the law of sin and death the law of Works they were following not the law of righteousness what is the law of righteousness Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by The Works of the law for they stumbled at that stumbling Stone as it is written behold I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and rock of a fence and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed who's The Stumbling Stone who's the rock of offense Christ Christ crucified to the Jews what foolishness a stumbling block they can't understand that they're expecting a king to overthrow a governmental system that's still in their minds they're still they're not looking for a sacrifice even many of them are not even looking for a rebuilt Temple they don't want it we think oh the Jewish nation is just waiting for the chance to tear down the Dome of the Rock no very very few Jewish people want to see the temple rebuilt they're they're afraid if you go if you go to the temple if you try to go to the Temple Mount there's a big sign from two both the major the sapharic and the ashkanazi rabbis with their picture saying do not go to the Temple Mount you're not allowed to under Judaism you might step on the holy of holies so but many still go but nevertheless those in power they don't want it they don't want to upset what what's happening there it's it's a blindness has happened to them and the truth is they're they they most Orthodox and serious religious Jewish people are Antichrist that's just a fact they they hate Christians they hate the gospel God have mercy upon them they need to repent they'll have their time to repent but it'll be through two witnesses two two two prophets Moses I believe men after the spirit and power of Elijah and Moses though some people think it'll literally be Elijah and Moses that's not a matter of Salvation so don't let's not argue about it but but uh following God's principle these men will raise up and begin to prophesy and their message will be Vindicated but it'll be a message to the world of judgment they'll be smiting the Earth with plagues this is part of their Vindication just as Moses did and just as Elijah did but what was it it was proving who the true and living God of Israel is and it's it's not it's it's not what they think it is who is it the Lord Jesus Christ the living God made manifest in human flesh and until they turn to him him they're walking in blindness and they need to repent though they be God's chosen people Brethren my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved so why is he praying why is he praying if they're already saved they're they're not saved they're lost why because they're blind they've rejected Jesus Christ and when you reject Jesus Christ you have rejected salvation and so here they are in this condition and and Paul's heart's desire and prayer is for their salvation is it a hopeless thing Paul no no it's not for I bear them record that they have a Zeal of God but not according to knowledge they're lacking what not merely human knowledge they have all kinds of knowledge what are they lacking spiritual Revelation that brings them into an experiential knowledge of who God is you can be zealous for God but not know God At All by Revelation for they being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God isn't that amazing to think their Zeal for the law I mean if you read in the book of Acts Paul returns from his missions trip to the Gentiles and the all they gather together and what do they say look at all these people that have turned to the way and they're all zealous for the law my my they were so proud of themselves God's heart was bleeding you don't see it you don't get it you don't understand what happened in Christ you're missing it completely you've not submitted yourself you're still trying to establish your own righteousness for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believes amen Christ is the end of the law once you have received Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost into your heart what is it the law is now living inside of you the nature of God which is manifested in the law is is on on the inside working out the righteousness of God in you for Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law that the man which doeth those things shall live by them now again we go back to the context Romans Chapter 2 Romans chapter 3 both prove that the Jewish people need Christ as much as the Gentiles they're all under both Jews Paul says we've determined before that both Jews and Gentiles are all sold under sin all under the Dominion of sin if you break one of the laws you're a breaker of all the laws and he proved that the all every Jew is breaking the law so they try to live by them but can they live live by them no one can but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise ah it speaks say not in thine heart who will Who who shall Ascend to Heaven that is PR Christ down from above or who shall it descend into the deep that is to bring up Christ again from the dead but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach what is the word of faith that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus or if if really the right way for that is confess with thy mouth that Jesus is Lord and Shall Believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved amen it's by faith alone that we're saved it's not by The Works of the law it's by by believing in the Lord Jesus Christ and making your confession and really what is the way that we outwardly make our confession that Jesus is Lord by being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's what that's that's right there it's another way of putting acts 238 repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for with the heart man believeth under righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed amen so we're going to have to quit there probably have to go back over some of this as we go just to get the get the uh feeling and the understanding of he's not really he's partially left talking about Israel and the Gentiles but he not really left it he's trying he's trying to show the distinction why is Israel in trouble why are why is God dealing with the Gentiles and how will he restore Israel so let's pray Heavenly Father we come before you Lord and we ask that your Holy Spirit would be with us Lord in the worship and in the preaching of the word today Lord pray that you'd be glorified pray for all those traveling now Lord that you'd keep your hand upon them Lord and bless them wherever they're at we ask in Jesus name amen
