[1:24] do
[1:29] [Music]
[3:30] so
[3:34] hey man good morning god bless you we're
[3:37] going to read right from our
[3:38] reading in the book of revelation
[3:40] chapter 2. greece in the name of the
[3:42] lord and happy to have you here in class
[3:44] this morning i came aware that
[3:47] the live class might be a bit small
[3:50] today but that's all right
[3:52] we've got a number of people out of town
[3:55] a little bit of sickness
[3:56] going around and we have kind of a
[4:00] moratorium on coming to church six so
[4:03] we've asked
[4:04] everybody if they're feeling the least
[4:05] bit down not to do that
[4:07] and so some my family my sister rachel
[4:11] some of the kids
[4:12] woke up went to bed last night woke up
[4:14] this morning not feeling
[4:16] too great and so i just advised him to
[4:18] stay back but the jd's out of town also
[4:20] ministering brother matt
[4:21] is away ministering in arizona and uh
[4:24] other different ones but we're here
[4:26] praise the lord and uh we all i i see
[4:29] enough
[4:30] uh on our facebook page to know that we
[4:32] have
[4:33] always a nice size um
[4:36] virtual audience amen on there who are
[4:38] streaming so we're going to look right
[4:40] at uh chapter two we got into the
[4:44] first church age on our last lesson
[4:47] let's pick up at verse one unto the
[4:50] angel of the church of
[4:51] ephesus right these things saith he that
[4:53] holdeth the seven stars in his right
[4:55] hand
[4:56] who walketh in the midst of the seven
[4:58] golden candlesticks
[5:00] i know thy works and thy labor and thy
[5:02] patience
[5:03] and how thou canst not bear them which
[5:06] are evil
[5:07] and thou has tried them which say they
[5:09] are apostles and are not
[5:11] and has found them liars and has borne
[5:14] and has
[5:14] patience and for my name's sake has
[5:17] labored and has not fainted nevertheless
[5:21] i have somewhat against thee
[5:23] because thou has left thy first love
[5:26] amen we'll cease reading there today and
[5:29] move right into
[5:31] our lesson we came covered quite a bit
[5:34] of ground
[5:35] last time and i'm definitely not looking
[5:37] to
[5:38] go back over that material because we're
[5:40] in a series so if you missed it
[5:42] you can just get the archive
[5:46] all right so when we look at the church
[5:49] ages one of the things that we should
[5:51] point out
[5:52] is that god in the book of revelation
[5:56] and in and in the i should say not just
[5:59] in the book
[5:59] as it's written but in the ages
[6:02] themselves
[6:04] follows the pattern from genesis chapter
[6:07] 1
[6:08] in that in verse 5 of genesis 1 and god
[6:12] called the light day and the darkness
[6:15] he called night and here it is and the
[6:18] evening
[6:18] and the morning were the first day so
[6:21] that you can see that brother branham
[6:23] points out to us how that in every age
[6:26] god brings the messenger at the
[6:29] end of a previous age when it has gone
[6:32] into darkness
[6:33] and so thus you can see that paul comes
[6:35] on the scene
[6:37] at the very close at the very darkness
[6:40] of the jewish age and he comes in then
[6:43] to usher in the next stage
[6:45] and that cycle continues all the way
[6:49] to laodicea now when it gets of course
[6:52] to layer to see and this is jumping
[6:53] ahead a little bit we'll cover this a
[6:54] little more thoroughly when we get to
[6:56] that age
[6:57] but when you get to laodicea then you
[6:59] have to have a change
[7:01] you know otherwise you would have the
[7:02] messenger coming at the end of the
[7:05] wesleyan age which we know that brother
[7:07] branham did not do that
[7:09] he actually didn't come on the scene
[7:11] till the middle of the 20th
[7:13] century and so and he even described his
[7:17] ministry
[7:18] as one born out of season now the reason
[7:20] he would say that
[7:22] is because the pattern had always been
[7:23] that he should have been back there but
[7:25] we realize
[7:26] that laod the laodicea age opens with
[7:30] the azusa revival
[7:32] which would be something that would look
[7:34] very much like
[7:36] the last day message which is why you
[7:38] would think we would have needed our
[7:40] profit right then
[7:41] to usher that age in but the very fact
[7:44] that he wasn't
[7:45] born at the end of the wesleyan age and
[7:48] he did not
[7:49] usher in the azusa revival is indicative
[7:53] it indicates to us that that that
[7:56] that the azusa revival was not and could
[8:00] not have been
[8:01] the restoration of the message
[8:04] of the original uh word that it was the
[8:07] long-awaited restoration it was not
[8:09] we have discussed many times the further
[8:12] evidence that it was not that long
[8:13] awaited restoration was the fact that
[8:16] they denominated as had
[8:18] luther's age as had wesley's age
[8:21] and as would azusa the revivalist and by
[8:25] the time brother branham
[8:26] arrives on the scene late to the party
[8:29] it they're already fractured and brother
[8:31] branham even says
[8:32] when i found them uh he said i found
[8:35] that they were just as fractured as we
[8:37] baptists were
[8:38] and that troubled his mind but you have
[8:40] to realize that
[8:41] that in the last day there's the
[8:44] prophecies from the old testament
[8:46] is that he would there would be a former
[8:48] rain there is a ladder rain but the
[8:49] prophecy concerning the restoration
[8:52] was that he would bring the former and
[8:54] the latter reign at the same time right
[8:56] in the same
[8:57] age in the same time frame and so uh
[9:00] it winds up very uniquely with
[9:03] with christ being put out of the church
[9:06] and thus the age of the church ends
[9:09] because christ is no longer there to
[9:11] represent it
[9:12] and we find that that uh the bride then
[9:15] is brought on the scene by the word now
[9:18] again i don't want to get too far ahead
[9:20] we'll cover that more thoroughly
[9:22] at laodicea but what we do find out then
[9:25] is that this is why paul would come
[9:28] upon the scene and he's going to
[9:31] introduce this next
[9:33] coming age the the age of the holy ghost
[9:36] not the christian
[9:38] um era because that's during the time
[9:41] of the lord jesus earthly ministry of
[9:43] christ
[9:44] but this is the era of the holy ghost
[9:47] which is going to move christ the man
[9:51] moving in the body misses jesus christ
[9:54] and we've talked about that
[9:56] extensively and we don't want to uh just
[9:58] go back to
[10:00] too much into that that's why you know
[10:02] that that
[10:03] pre um that pre-restoration message
[10:08] time of laodicea brother branham refers
[10:11] to that
[10:11] and just simply calls it nearly he said
[10:14] it could almost be called an extension
[10:16] of the philadelphian aids because it was
[10:18] accomplishing things in prophecy
[10:20] so we find then that when he comes here
[10:23] paul comes to this age uh we come down
[10:26] to
[10:27] verse 2 i know thy works and thy labor
[10:30] and thy patience and how thou canst not
[10:32] bear them
[10:33] which are evil thou has tried them which
[10:36] say they are apostles and are not has
[10:38] found them liars
[10:39] so he says here i know thy works and thy
[10:42] labor and so brother branham
[10:44] begins to point out to us as he's
[10:46] teaching on this age
[10:48] that you can see that legalism is
[10:51] already starting to creep into the
[10:53] church
[10:54] which which you have to take this into
[10:56] account
[10:58] that if brother branham is indicating
[11:01] that here is where legalism is starting
[11:05] to creep into the church
[11:07] then you can know by brother branham's
[11:09] statement
[11:10] that the the the opposite of that would
[11:14] would have to mean that the church was
[11:16] not
[11:17] ever founded on legalism that if if it
[11:20] was founded on legalism
[11:22] then you would either have to say
[11:23] legalism is continuing
[11:25] or legalism is starting to fade but
[11:27] actually
[11:28] he notes their their works and their
[11:32] labor
[11:32] in the first age don't forget that this
[11:35] is the age that starts in
[11:37] in 80 53 once the church starts to fall
[11:40] away brother branham doesn't
[11:42] associate those first couple of decades
[11:45] with the age of the church because
[11:48] that's the ministry of the son of man
[11:50] the ministry that was in christ is now
[11:52] moving perfectly
[11:53] into his church when it moves into the
[11:56] chur age of the church
[11:58] and we find that they start to backslide
[12:00] they start to get cold
[12:01] then christ has to begin his
[12:03] intercessory work
[12:05] on behalf of their ignorance now it's
[12:07] not to say he wasn't interceding already
[12:09] for their transgressions just like today
[12:12] he's not interceding
[12:14] for ignorance anymore but thank god he's
[12:16] interceding for my transgressions
[12:19] so we do find out that he doesn't need
[12:21] to mediate for the age anymore and he's
[12:23] not mediating for the age anymore
[12:25] but he is mediating for his family so
[12:27] don't ever let anyone tell you
[12:29] that he's not still the lamb of god as a
[12:31] mediator for his family
[12:33] brother branham said he must continue in
[12:35] that office
[12:36] until that last name is brought in
[12:39] so but that brother branham is clear i
[12:42] know some men have
[12:43] tried to make strange doctrines out of
[12:45] that but i you excuse me
[12:47] if i just stick with what a prophet
[12:48] taught us would that be all right beth
[12:50] tabernacle
[12:51] and so we find then though that now that
[12:54] this is the age that
[12:55] they've began to lose their first love
[12:58] and he's noticing its
[12:59] works and labor brother branham points
[13:02] out to legalism creeping in
[13:05] and so we we find out that that by
[13:08] that by you know by by our human nature
[13:11] we fall into legalism it's human nature
[13:14] to think of
[13:15] keeping a scorecard on your own life and
[13:18] so we have to continually
[13:20] be reminded of the grace of almighty god
[13:25] paul spends a lot of time peter john all
[13:27] of them jesus spent a lot of time
[13:30] talking about the grace that comes from
[13:32] god and we were told
[13:34] particularly of a prophecy of the end
[13:36] time
[13:37] that we should be prepared for the day
[13:40] in the revelation of jesus christ for
[13:42] the grace that will be received i'm glad
[13:45] to know today friends
[13:46] that in the then the most wicked age of
[13:49] all time
[13:49] where we very likely have more missteps
[13:52] than any other age
[13:55] there is a grace promised to us as the
[13:58] as the headstone comes crying grace
[14:02] grace unto it so it was relaxed it was a
[14:05] relaxing time we've talked about that
[14:08] i don't want to go back over all that
[14:09] again but they were beginning to relax
[14:11] the standards
[14:13] of what the new birth meant and what it
[14:15] would take to receive the new birth it's
[14:18] false doctrine is already
[14:19] coming already starting to creep in
[14:22] individuals are already starting to make
[14:24] something
[14:25] you know more out of themselves and you
[14:27] get kingdom builders already rising up
[14:29] and john
[14:30] had a particular issue with a man who
[14:33] who who anybody that went to hear john
[14:36] preach that man would excommunicate him
[14:38] from his church can you imagine
[14:40] and that was going on right in the time
[14:41] when john was still alive and so
[14:44] then you know to say nothing of of the
[14:47] the things that peter had to face
[14:48] you know when here's ananias and
[14:51] sapphira his wife or when he's facing
[14:53] simon the sorcerer who had all this
[14:55] influence among the people
[14:57] or when paul has to constantly battle
[14:59] against the judaizers
[15:01] and their influence in the church was so
[15:04] strong
[15:05] that in the book of galatians you find
[15:07] peter and barnabas even get swept up in
[15:09] it
[15:10] and paul has to rebuke him openly and
[15:12] say my goodness
[15:13] you know we're not we're not that's not
[15:15] what calvary came for
[15:17] the the the grace of god if you're gonna
[15:19] live by that legalistic code
[15:21] then you're making the cross of christ
[15:23] vain so you can see
[15:25] that by the time paul is going long gone
[15:29] and the church now is receiving
[15:32] its its message as it's began to decline
[15:37] not
[15:37] not before the decline but in the
[15:39] decline god
[15:40] in prophecy would already be telling
[15:43] them
[15:44] here's going to be your problem paul
[15:46] called it grievous wolves coming in not
[15:48] sparing the flock
[15:49] the holy spirit interprets it in john's
[15:51] prophecy
[15:52] that you're going to leave your first
[15:54] love you're going to start to
[15:56] have legalism come in you're going to be
[15:58] you're going to get all about works by
[15:59] the time you get to
[16:01] thyatira that's that's all they got left
[16:04] i mean
[16:04] they've only got their works and god
[16:06] says look the age is so dark
[16:08] i won't even put anything else upon you
[16:10] just you know just carry on as best by
[16:12] your works
[16:13] and uh and in fact is the last vestige
[16:17] that luther was uh compelled luther was
[16:20] compelled in his ministry
[16:22] to take a hold of the last thing which
[16:24] was about to die
[16:25] it's the last vestige of true
[16:27] christianity which was
[16:29] that calvary made a way that man
[16:32] could have direct access to god through
[16:34] jesus amen
[16:36] but the catholic church had turned it
[16:38] into wax candles and purgatory and
[16:41] praying to saints and rosary beads and
[16:43] virgin mary and all this stuff
[16:45] and so luther's given a given a command
[16:47] get a hold of that last element
[16:49] that that the just shall live by his
[16:52] faith in christ
[16:53] and and strengthen that which is about
[16:56] to die and of course luther
[16:58] uh accomplished his his task because
[17:02] that uh that the just shall live by
[17:04] faith has never been threatened again
[17:07] uh since the dark ages because
[17:09] protestantism that's what all
[17:11] protestantism
[17:12] is established on so they've never been
[17:15] able to threaten it again
[17:16] but he says here you know this is the
[17:18] age where verse 3
[17:21] where you find them or verse 2 you found
[17:23] them has tried them which say they are
[17:25] apostles and are not
[17:27] and so you know he's commending the
[17:29] church
[17:30] that they're still willing to go back
[17:33] and try the spirits according to the
[17:35] word not by experience
[17:37] but by the word brother branham would
[17:39] say away with experiences
[17:41] as your measuring line i was reading uh
[17:44] this morning
[17:45] a story that um that uh wigglesworth
[17:48] told about how that
[17:50] he was you know him and his wife were
[17:52] visiting two young sisters
[17:54] and um and suddenly while he's talking
[17:57] to them one of them says a voice is
[17:59] talking to me
[18:00] and the other sister's like oh what is
[18:02] it and says well it's a secret and says
[18:03] well you
[18:04] but i can tell you and as she begins to
[18:06] tell it there's brother wigglesworth
[18:07] and his wife listening and they're
[18:09] supposed to go and to the to the train
[18:11] depot and they're supposed to buy a
[18:13] ticket to a certain
[18:14] place to glasgow i think and when you
[18:16] buy it you're going to have exactly six
[18:18] pence left and
[18:19] when you get on the train there's going
[18:20] to be a man seated who's going to give
[18:22] you all the money you ever need and
[18:23] there'll be a woman across from him with
[18:25] a nurse's cap on and
[18:26] and brother you know wigglesworth says i
[18:29] could tell immediately
[18:30] that this whole thing was of the devil
[18:32] he said it didn't witness with my spirit
[18:34] at all but
[18:35] the the story goes that those ladies got
[18:37] there and sure enough
[18:38] they bought a ticket and sure enough
[18:40] when the change come back they had
[18:41] exactly
[18:42] six pence and now they're running all
[18:43] over the place you know god has spoken
[18:45] to us we're gonna go
[18:46] be great missionaries and when the train
[18:49] pulled up there was no man there was no
[18:51] nurse there was no nothing
[18:52] and then then one of them says oh the
[18:54] voice is talking again
[18:56] and it's going to be on the next train
[18:58] and so they wait and they're running all
[19:00] up and down the depot and wigglesworth
[19:01] said he's watching the whole thing
[19:03] and they got on train after train after
[19:04] train and never found that
[19:06] and he said they went on until after
[19:07] nine o'clock that night and he said it
[19:10] just goes to show you that if they would
[19:12] have went back to the word
[19:14] and tested their voice by the word they
[19:16] would have never fell victim to that
[19:18] and so he says here you know you you
[19:21] you have those who say the apostles but
[19:24] you found them liars and brother branham
[19:25] said the way they did it
[19:27] was that they they would judge them by
[19:30] what paul
[19:31] taught were they teaching and if they
[19:33] weren't that would be the indictment
[19:35] you're
[19:36] not teaching what paul taught i think
[19:39] that's our
[19:40] measuring line today friends we have a
[19:42] message that came to us
[19:44] and anybody that teaches contrary to
[19:47] that message
[19:48] is not teaching what paul taught because
[19:51] this message that came to us
[19:53] is the restoration of paul's teaching
[19:55] completely
[19:56] verse 3 and has borne and has patience
[19:59] and for my name's sake
[20:00] has labored and has not fainted so he
[20:03] goes all down you know for my
[20:05] for my namesake that's interesting
[20:07] because you know
[20:08] when when you it you know
[20:12] what they're what they're battling there
[20:14] in the beginning in this early age
[20:16] you know everybody is baptized in the
[20:19] name of the lord jesus christ so he says
[20:22] for my name's sake so you're taking a
[20:25] stand for true christian baptism
[20:27] later in subsequent ages he'll come and
[20:31] say
[20:32] you have a name by which you think
[20:34] you're saved but you're dead
[20:36] because by that time now the trinity had
[20:38] taken over
[20:39] and so but in this first age you find
[20:42] out
[20:43] that they they they would come later and
[20:44] have a name that you live but you're
[20:46] dead
[20:47] because you know baptizing those titles
[20:49] of father son holy ghost
[20:50] but here in ephesian church age they're
[20:54] saying that
[20:54] for my name's sake has labored and has
[20:57] not fainted
[20:58] so verse 4 nevertheless i have somewhat
[21:02] against thee
[21:03] because thou has left thy first love all
[21:05] right so your first love now
[21:07] it's interesting because when we talk
[21:10] about
[21:11] the love affair of god you know
[21:15] i i when you i i heard a brother
[21:18] um this morning uh brother tim calhoun
[21:21] was teaching
[21:22] not on this particular passage he was
[21:24] actually teaching
[21:26] on the philadelphian church age but he
[21:28] went back and and
[21:30] founded you know because in the first
[21:32] age they're leaving their first love
[21:34] in the sixth age the it's the age of
[21:37] brotherly love where love is being
[21:39] restored and that's of course restore
[21:41] restoration of the bride tree that makes
[21:42] perfect sense
[21:44] and so we find that brother tim went
[21:47] back to leviticus and i was astounded
[21:49] because
[21:50] i realized that when you look at
[21:53] the book of leviticus and you've heard
[21:55] me say it before
[21:57] to me the book of leviticus is the
[21:59] gospels of the old testament
[22:02] in the new testament you have matthew
[22:03] mark luke and john in the
[22:05] old testament you have the book of
[22:06] leviticus because why
[22:08] the entire book of leviticus is the
[22:10] story of jesus
[22:12] it's all about appro getting the
[22:14] approach to god
[22:15] and the sacrifices it takes and the step
[22:17] by step and the priesthood
[22:19] and and coming to the shekinah and the
[22:21] high priest and the
[22:22] lamb sacrifice and the sprinkling of the
[22:24] blood so that whole book of leviticus
[22:27] is the old testament gospels to me and
[22:30] and so when you start thinking about
[22:34] men now you watch what the catholic
[22:36] church did this is an interesting point
[22:39] because the catholic church
[22:42] what they literally have done is taken
[22:45] the old levitical
[22:48] worship those standards of you've got to
[22:52] do this and bring this and have this and
[22:53] there's got to be this and this
[22:54] and it's all very meticulous and they
[22:57] have literally
[22:59] taken that style of worship
[23:02] and overlaid it into christianity
[23:06] and that's why you have people today
[23:08] they first have to come light a candle
[23:09] then they have to go have the eucharist
[23:11] and then they
[23:11] you know they have to say the rosary and
[23:13] they have to hold their bees and have to
[23:14] pray to a saint
[23:15] it's all about these approaches and then
[23:17] they have to go into the confessional
[23:18] and the priest has to forgive them
[23:19] you can see that what they've done is
[23:22] take the free access
[23:24] that god made that christ made to god
[23:27] and and brought it back to steps and
[23:30] ritual and works and legalism and this
[23:33] and it and you know what it ends up
[23:35] being it ends up being
[23:36] a an overbearing burdensome
[23:40] guilt-ridden penitence and you know
[23:44] uh lashing themselves and works and
[23:47] crawling on glass and all of these
[23:48] things and and
[23:50] and and and they they've made and
[23:52] they've literally turned
[23:54] the old testament law into something
[23:57] that it never even was to begin with
[24:00] you have to remember that in the garden
[24:02] of eden
[24:04] when fellowship is lost between god
[24:08] and his and his children
[24:11] adam and eve aren't the only ones out
[24:15] they're not even the main ones the one
[24:17] that's hurt the worst
[24:19] is god because now the whole purpose
[24:23] that he made man
[24:24] he's cut off from it his whole thing was
[24:27] he
[24:27] loved fellowship brother brown talks
[24:29] about that god was lonely he didn't like
[24:31] that he said it's not good for a man to
[24:33] be alone
[24:34] so he he creates him a family and a
[24:36] kingdom
[24:37] and so now you find that god who
[24:40] loved fellowship now it's cut off and
[24:42] brother branham would say
[24:44] that immediately he began to make a way
[24:46] back he would not
[24:47] see his masterpiece laying there face
[24:50] down in the dirt
[24:51] broken ruined he said he began in
[24:54] masterpiece to build it back
[24:55] immediately he said because he's god and
[24:58] he won't be defeated
[24:59] and so you realize that what's the first
[25:01] thing he does he
[25:02] gives a revelation to abel to take a
[25:05] lamb sacrifice it
[25:06] kill it on a rock and offer it to god
[25:10] because what is this doing this is god
[25:12] trying to get restored he's trying to
[25:14] say
[25:15] i've lost fellowship with you now i
[25:17] can't have it back perfectly until the
[25:19] lamb of god comes at calvary
[25:21] but i'll give you a substitutionary way
[25:25] i'll give because i want you to be in
[25:28] fellowship with me and i don't want to
[25:30] wait 4 000 years
[25:31] for calvary you see my point so
[25:35] so when this is why
[25:38] this is exactly why sons of god
[25:42] never had a problem with the law that's
[25:45] why david had no problem with it david
[25:47] said
[25:47] i love the law see so
[25:50] to david to men of god the law that came
[25:54] from sinai was never a burdensome thing
[25:57] never a loathsome
[25:58] it was not like the catholic church has
[26:00] it set up it was
[26:01] this was our opportunity they would read
[26:04] the word in the days of ezra they just
[26:06] read the word and they read it all day
[26:07] and the people stood there and just
[26:08] rejoiced at just hearing it read
[26:11] the law and they and they they had a
[26:14] desire to change their lives they had a
[26:17] desire to undo
[26:18] the things that had separated them from
[26:20] god and so
[26:21] you know that's why brother branham when
[26:23] he comes to
[26:24] the statue of a perfect man and he goes
[26:26] to peter peter
[26:28] saying that by these precious promises
[26:32] you might be a partaker of the divine
[26:35] nature
[26:36] so that's the good news that's not
[26:38] legalism that's that's why the law
[26:40] wasn't ever designed now
[26:42] the those false jews they wanted it to
[26:45] be that way that's why brother branham
[26:46] said it was a
[26:47] rational decision because god was
[26:49] looking at their heart at their motive
[26:51] they
[26:51] they wanted to be able to not they
[26:54] wanted to be able to dot all the eyes
[26:56] and cross all the t's of the requirement
[26:58] but not have to have a relationship with
[27:00] god
[27:01] but relationship is what he was after
[27:03] that's why he gave the law you
[27:05] understand that's why it was never a
[27:07] problem
[27:08] to a son of god to a daughter of god
[27:10] they loved
[27:11] the law of god david said i hide it in
[27:13] my heart that i sin not against it
[27:15] that wasn't fear that was love
[27:18] in fact his brother branham said the
[27:21] thing that wearied david
[27:22] in his heart was that he had hid the law
[27:25] in his heart
[27:26] put it between his eyes tied it to his
[27:28] bedpost
[27:29] meditated on it day and night but
[27:31] brother branham said because he didn't
[27:32] have the holy ghost and couldn't get a
[27:33] new birth
[27:34] the thing that weared him was he never
[27:36] could make that
[27:37] word live in his life and that was a
[27:40] dread to david
[27:41] it's a dread to us amen friends because
[27:44] why we're afraid we'll miss the rapture
[27:45] afraid we'll go to hell no because i
[27:48] love god's righteousness his law is my
[27:52] delight
[27:53] amen and so so so you know
[27:56] i think here some time ago we made we
[27:58] made the point
[27:59] that you know if you consider the
[28:03] where your relationship is with god
[28:06] today
[28:06] and we would ask the question to say
[28:09] when was
[28:10] when since the day you gave your heart
[28:13] to the lord
[28:14] when is when has the your relationship
[28:17] to god been the sweetest
[28:19] and and if you're if your answer is not
[28:22] right now then you need to get to
[28:24] praying see
[28:26] just like in the my own wife the love
[28:29] affair that we have
[28:30] i mean i loved her the day i married her
[28:33] amen
[28:34] and then we began to have children have
[28:36] a family and made me love her even more
[28:38] but if you ask me today brother jason
[28:40] did you love her the most when you first
[28:41] met her
[28:42] i would say i loved her but not that
[28:44] wouldn't be the most what about when you
[28:45] married her and stood at an altar and
[28:46] said
[28:47] till death to his part yes of course i
[28:48] loved her. but what about when he
[28:50] started to have children oh it became
[28:52] even more
[28:53] but if you ask me when do you love her
[28:55] the most i would say right now
[28:57] those times can't even combined can't
[28:59] compare
[29:00] to how i feel about her right now and
[29:02] and that's that's
[29:03] our relationship to god and that's why
[29:06] the problem in the first age was you've
[29:09] left your first
[29:10] love and so it wouldn't be very hard for
[29:13] rome to talk everybody into
[29:15] let's make it a legalistic let's make it
[29:17] a ritualistic
[29:18] let's make it spiritualism because
[29:20] that's that's
[29:22] what was uh what israel done they tried
[29:25] to make
[29:26] it like that and that was never god's
[29:27] plan god came down
[29:30] to be their god and to talk to them and
[29:32] to have fellowship and they ran and
[29:34] moses
[29:35] pleaded with them don't go backward he
[29:37] wants to talk to you come forward and i
[29:39] don't know moses
[29:40] no we don't want that level we don't
[29:42] we're not here for that level just give
[29:44] us a do's and don'ts list
[29:46] you know we're not we're not interested
[29:47] in that kind of a level we're perfectly
[29:50] happy
[29:50] you know with the life that we have and
[29:53] so
[29:54] so you see that that this is god
[29:57] complaining to the church you're you're
[30:00] falling away from the purpose i died
[30:02] you're falling away
[30:04] from grace you're falling away from the
[30:06] fact that i love you and
[30:07] you're trying to serve me by works
[30:09] you'll never do it
[30:10] israel couldn't do it i i only gave them
[30:14] the law to prove to them they couldn't
[30:15] keep it
[30:16] see man shall not live by bread alone
[30:19] why did he
[30:19] why did he why did he do that so that
[30:22] why did he give them manna
[30:24] to prove to them they had so much mana
[30:26] they got sick of it
[30:28] and the and and the reason that he did
[30:30] that was to prove to them
[30:32] you think you need bread but i'm here to
[30:34] tell you you need more than bread
[30:36] you can't live by bread alone so there's
[30:39] a there's a whole
[30:40] heaven of blessing and anointing and
[30:43] righteousness and love and
[30:45] and and the love of god that can pass
[30:47] all understanding
[30:49] so that'll take us down to to verse five
[30:51] we're still working our way
[30:53] through um the ephesian church age
[30:56] amen let's stand father we thank you for
[31:00] our
[31:00] lesson today and we take took just
[31:03] another
[31:04] step lord and i i'm grateful to you
[31:07] lord jesus as i stand here today so
[31:09] grateful
[31:10] that you bring these things out to us
[31:12] and make them live
[31:13] we see you more clearly as we study your
[31:16] word
[31:17] so we commit it to you now in jesus
