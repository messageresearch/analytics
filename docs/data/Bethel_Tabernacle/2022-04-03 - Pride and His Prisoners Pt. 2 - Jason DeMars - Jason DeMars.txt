TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good morning everyone god bless you let's stand and pray gracious father we come before you and we want to dedicate this time to you lord and ask that your holy spirit would come and move amongst us and speak to us this morning lord we ask that your name would be lifted up and be glorified help us to step out of the way and let your spirit have full control and access to our hearts we ask these things in jesus name amen let's continue on our subject from last month pride in his prisoners proverbs 16 5 is the scripture i want to open with everyone that is proud in heart is an abomination to the lord though hand joined in hand he shall not be unpunished amen can be seated if you're listening in brother brad the monitor is a little hot if you could turn it down just a bit so it's a there's a there's a certain amount of things in the bible that are an abomination to the lord it's it's something it speaks of something that he he detests he hates he despises and if you look all through scripture as we did the last time i spoke on it is you see over and over again that god treats the proud as an enemy and and you know we can we can look at this in in two ways right so on on the one hand all of us we're christians we're born again of the spirit of god and yet we can still battle against and struggle with pride so it's god is working a process i think i preached on humility quite a while ago and i talked about a thermometer and how as the thermometer goes up you know the mercury gets goes up in it and that's pride that's more of you that's self the level of self is being measured so the more self there is the more pride there is the less self there is the more humility more emptying out and the more humility there is and so when you when you look at this in the perspective of we're christians oh i'm a christian i've humbled myself to believe in god well that's good that's that's because there's people that don't even humble themselves to even believe in god i've humbled myself that i've repented i've humbled myself that i've turned away from my denominational thinking and i've accepted the message that's wonderful but we can still be in in our personal lives struggle with and be even captives to pride it doesn't mean that you're possessed by the devil it means the devil is oppressing you from the outside and bringing circumstances and conditions in your life that you're falling victim to the attacks of the enemy and giving way to self and so that's the process god is taking us through a process in our christian walk to humble us that's that's one key feature if you realize if god is working in your life he is going to work to humble you and if you don't see that he's working in your life to humble you it should cause a great deal of concern and and worry you know i'd say we're not supposed to worry there's only really for me one thing maybe two things i worry about and that i feel like that's okay one is am i in the middle of the god's will yeah that's that's my main concern am i doing the will of the lord or am i going on doing his will doing and trying to do him a service without it being his will and secondly the thing that i'm worried about is is i'm am i getting full of myself am i getting is my head puffing up that those are the things that make me worry that keep me awake at night i mean there's other things too but those are the main things that i feel like should keep me awake at night and that are okay to be very deeply sincerely concerned about and so don't don't grab these scriptures and just say well that's for the unbelievers because god resists the proud that's a scripture that i have further ahead but i'm just going to bring it right now and i'll go back this is from the west expanded translation james 4 6 moreover he gives greater grace for this reason he says god sets himself in battle array against the arrogant and haughty but gives grace to the humble and lowly so god sets himself in battle array you say i'm a christian god will never set himself in battle array against me are you sure are you sure god has two purposes if he's setting himself in battle array against someone who is condemned that's that's his wrath right when god sets himself in battle array against you christian who's full of pride it's in order to perfect you and grow you but i still don't want that i don't want god to be actively working against me but his working against me is really for me okay you understand what i'm saying i want to be blessable i want to be in a position and a condition where he can say i can flow through you i can work through you i can entrust you with more responsibility that's the position i want to be in i don't want to be in the position where god's saying look i'm going to i'm going to ruin your life i'm going to destroy your life but i am not going to let you continue with poor character and pride and he'll humble us he will take out his sword and he will humble us and it won't be fun and it won't be pretty but if you're a child of god he will accomplish it that's that's his love you think god's going to be defeated by your pride no no he's not but we should have a healthy understanding of how wicked and evil pride is we too often we pet it we baby it we turn it into our our favored friend and we encourage it and we do all the things that we should not do and someone speaks against us and what's the very first thing is we think of ourselves to me pride is the greatest vice that leads to every other sin pride made the devil the devil humility is the root and the foundation of all godliness and so you know if you get if you have a get a catch a revelation of those two things and then can honestly observe your own life you're you're going to go great places with god because we'll be challenged god will put circumstances that will challenge this i started studying it and god started putting lots of circumstances of challenging the pride that was still in me and he sufficiently humbled me over and over again and things that things that broke my heart but that's good that's good it needed to be broken so that god could build it the right way so let me go back brother branham in the sermon pride said oh pride's such a cursed thing so awful so evil is pride it's an astounding statement it is it that's exactly what made satan rebel in the beginning that's what exactly what will prevent us from our growth in christ um let me get this my eyes don't work as good as they used to for that in the back i'm going to read this one satan knows the will of god this is from god's power to transform 1965 satan knows the will of god yes but just refuses to do it sometimes we're in that condition we know what the right thing is but we enjoy the wrong thing so much that we continue doing the wrong thing and it god comes against us god strikes against us notice he had seen god vindicate abel's message now i want you to think use your thinking man's filter now for a minute abel's correct message that god vindicated to be the truth are you drawing now uh-huh abel's message had been received and cain saw it and knowed that god had vindicated that message right but he just couldn't do it his pride kept him from it that's right his pride kept him from doing it he's seen god vindicate the message so it seems to be now so hard for people to humble themselves to the word of god they just don't want to do it they'll humble themselves to the creed of the church sure but not to the word of god what a danger and don't don't shovel that on to denominational people because you see that well i don't hold to the creeds i'm not holding decreeds well we can turn the message into a creed we can we can turn it into a tradition we can turn it into something that that though it has life in it for us it doesn't because we have we have taken the power of god out of it and and so we want to keep going here and god doesn't call man to judgment without first warning him now we find out that our proud america is not going to escape the wrath of god as i spoke one day since i've been here i'm sure it was here of everything at the end you know i can't see nothing to build to you can't build the can't build the politics it's gone you can't build the social life because it's so demoralized there's nothing that you can build to here to to there and you can't put no hopes in nothing how about the church well you can't do nothing with the church it's so formal and gone there's nothing left they've done sold out their birthrights for a mess of pottage and they're just waiting judgment the holy spirit has crossed this nation showing his signs and wonders and they continually spurn his grace he vindicates himself and proves by his great of indication that he's the word of god manifested in this day and they still turn it down see there's nothing left now you just can't always do that to god see wow so you know to give a broader commentary on our world today is you look at you look at christian television let's put it that way you look at christian television how much time they spend talking about politics i i believe in speaking against evil 100 percent but it's all the time politics and this politician and trump this and biden this and it's it's what are they dressed what are they dressing themselves in what are they robbing themselves in well the prophet had a vision what are they what did they dress them themselves in newspapers current events politics that's what they that's the dress that they were dressed in it wasn't the word it was it was politics shameful and so many times we as message believers can get caught up because we appreciate our country we're thankful for our country and yet we don't understand the evil that it plays in the world okay you get so proud of yourselves i remember going back and forth with iranians about their country and my country and they said well your country is the second beast in revelation 13. so i'm not sure why you're so proud of it and i was humbled i wasn't proud of it anymore i was like that's correct and i have to be careful because i want to go down a whole tirade but my point being is the church has sold itself to politics and that's what they that's what they want to change and that's what they want to transform they don't they they sort of have an idea that they want to transform people's lives but the main focus is politics and it's shameful and it's it's shows why they're clothed in the prophet's vision with a newspaper in god revealing himself to his people says our heavenly father by your spirit look down through the stream of time oh you're here dear jesus you're so lovely and kind and we love you with all of our heart and our sister standing here has been bound by an oppression of satan foul spirits have tried to put pride upon her but thou art here to remove this curse of the enemy for you said the last words from your sacred lips as you were leaving the world you said these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils help me dear god this duel of faith against the enemy so incredible incredible identifying what is behind pride so like i said at the very beginning i don't believe a born-again christian and i don't think we can scripturally prove that born-again christian would ever be possessed by an evil spirit of pride but for certain can be oppressed by an evil spirit of pride and even put put under chains in their christian walk by that spirit of pride you become a prisoner to it so we read that scripture god this is god's attitude this is god's heart against pride he sets himself in battle array and you can read all through if you do a search in your bible search about pride you can read through the whole old testament and over and over and over again it shows god makes himself an enemy against pride brother branham says and we would see jesus he come stomping up there with his chest out and throated out you're all from probably familiar with the story and even made fun of them and everything but when he did he found out it didn't go so good so he found out he was wrong he closed up his books and walked down with his shoulders down humbly walking down there was old sate sitting over in the corner punched the one next to him said if he would have went up the way he came down he he'd come down the way he went up so that's about right that's key we hear that story oh it's funny that's nice let's move on but i want i want to linger on that because it's it's a whole attitude it's a whole mindset that we have as christians what in the world why would you why would you come up to a pulpit thinking oh i'm so intelligent and i can get this across to the people it when we know scripturally speaking it's not intelligence that changes people's lives usually intelligence puts them further away from god not that we're against education not that we're against knowledge the bible spends a lot of time speaking about true understanding revealed truth coming to our minds and changing our lives but mere knowledge puffs up that's what scripture says but love edifies if if if the disposition of that man's heart was right from the beginning it would have been love and thinking this people needs to be fed how could i do that how am i sufficient for that the only hope i have is if i get this guy out of the way so that one can speak through me to the people and feed their hearts that's humility you know it's crazy what we think sometimes it's crazy how we get going in our minds and we get on a little tangent and my goodness then out you open your mouth and express it to somebody and you think what what's going on inside of me you know but thank the lord we have good people in our lives that we can talk to and hopefully they can metaphorically slap us upside the head metaphorically i said but we need each other as the body of christ in love say brother sister i was confused by what you said it's so it's so easy for a guy from minnesota to want to stuff stuff whatever has happened and not confronted anything not confront issues that's just our style for minnesota that's not the christian style it's not the christian culture if we're confused if we have a misunderstanding pick up the phone don't text pick up the phone texting usually continues the misunderstanding just talk to people invite them to your house say i was confused about this thing you said or you know how many times that usually draws people's hearts closer together well the devil's trying to prevent that in the first place so when you when something comes in your mind just pick up the phone and say hey you said this what were you meaning by that and then let them talk and then say then usually you say oh you were meaning something very different than what i thought but what what prevents us from doing that pride we think we know sometimes we do sometimes we have a spirit of discernment and we we do know but many times it's not that um man my eyes are bad i need to go get glasses amy i can't i can't see that back there and then if i go away from this i don't have a mic on so i'm just gonna turn this way and hopefully you can hear me oh i read that one likewise first peter five five likewise you younger submit yourselves unto the elder yay all of you be subject one to another yay all of you be subject to one another is there any exceptions to that and i'll ask for everybody in the in the body of christ what is it it's submitting to the leadership of the holy spirit it's submitting to the gifts that god places in the body that he works through and be clothed with humility to be clothed with means to become that you can be you can clothe yourself with pride or you can clothe yourself with humility you know this the i i forget which scripture it is but paul writes put on the put ye on the lord jesus christ and make no provision for the flesh in other words yours to become what you put on so be clothed with humility you're supposed to become humility four again quoting the same scripture as james for god resists the proud and gives grace to the humble second peter 2 3 and through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingers not and their damnation slumbers not amen so we see this pride sometimes come out even in the ministry even in in in preachers and that's what peter is talking about here and through covetousness shall they with feigned words feigned means fictitious words in other words lies what happens in our in our world today that preachers will do they'll they'll tell you lies a either to comfort you and control you or b they will try to use the preaching of the word to bring a manipulation upon people's lives or or you know you've seen it where preachers will just start calling people's names over the pulpit so and so did this and this this guy has got tv in his house and that guy's i've seen him over at such and such a place and they think that's the anointing of the lord they're just trying to control people through fictitious words what do they do they make merchandise of you what is merchandise it's a it is it's a product you're actually it's saying that the preacher is turning you into a product a commodity to use to trade what do you use a commodity for you sell it in order to gain a profit so what do what will preachers do in order to make sure they're still getting ties and offerings they're just using people as commodities their their purpose isn't to help them grow they help them increase in their faith but their purpose is to have a job and you know this you can take this in a in a in a big denominational sense but you can take this in the horrifying experiences people have had um around the message in preachers that were never called to do what they they were doing and they were just bringing damage to people's lives but the preaching of the word is not to control your behavior right it's not to speak in such a way to draw just the right crowd and the right people and to get sponsored and supported by them the purpose of preaching is to transform lives by the power of god from the inside out it's not to control from the outside it's to give you something that changes your life that causes you to grow that's the fruit that's supposed to follow ministry growth stability strengthening learning more how to follow the leadership of the holy spirit growing in a greater revelation of the word having a deep roots of foundation where the power of god is living continuously in your life that's the purpose of ministry that's the purpose of preaching it's not for money it's not for power it's not for fame i think sometimes even preachers in the message they start getting proud of themselves i've it's blown me away sometimes you know you come from a denominational background you go to a church that has twenty thousand people and then somebody's like there oh there's a real big message church it's got eight hundred in it that preacher's so proud of himself for what it's a tiny little church but in the message it's giant it's so huge let's let's not be ignorant of satan's devices because a person could get pro his church grows up to 60 people and all of a sudden he's full of pride it's ridiculous but that's what that's what that's what can happen and it can happen even in the members of the church about the church and again it's not about that it's not about a building it's not about a redoing our building it's about serving people and glorifying god as we serve people and help them to grow and you know all the cameras and speakers and buildings and all that stuff is a means to serve god's people and if it's not then just throw it all out there's it's it's pointless and and so our i know our desire as a ministry team is to see all of us grow in the lord and that's that's our only purpose is to make a people ready for the rapture so i'm going to close let's stand heavenly father we we desire to see you lord we we love seeing each other we love the fellowship lord but our our purpose at being here this morning is to see you and to be changed into that same image from glory to glory lord i pray that you would just manifest yourself through the through the music through the singing through the preaching of the word lord show yourself present amongst us today our thirst our hunger our passion is for you lord we we want you to be glorified amongst us we ask these things in jesus name amen amen we'll take a short break and service will start in about 10 minutes so so [Music]
