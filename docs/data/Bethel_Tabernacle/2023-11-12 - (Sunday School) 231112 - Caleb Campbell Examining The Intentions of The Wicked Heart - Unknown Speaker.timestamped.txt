[5:02] amen God bless you Saints let's all just
[5:04] stand and have a word of prayer this
[5:09] morning amen let's just bow our
[5:11] hearts Heavenly Father Lord we're so
[5:14] grateful and so thankful Lord Jesus just
[5:16] to be gathered in your house this
[5:18] morning Father we pray that Lord you
[5:20] could be with us here Lord as we open up
[5:22] your word father we pray that you could
[5:24] be with Lord Pastor as he brings the
[5:26] word later on father I just pray that
[5:28] you'd be with the the listeners father
[5:30] the Lord the speakers father we love you
[5:32] now we ask all these things in the name
[5:34] of Jesus Christ amen amen if we'd like
[5:37] to turn in our Bibles we're going to go
[5:40] to Jeremiah the 17th chapter this
[5:43] morning Jeremiah
[5:45] 17 we're going to read actually two
[5:48] portions of scripture out of
[5:51] Jeremiah
[5:53] amen so Jeremiah 17 we're going to start
[5:56] in the ninth verse and it says the the
[5:59] heart is deceitful above all things and
[6:02] desperately wicked who can know it I the
[6:05] Lord search the heart I try the Reigns
[6:09] even to give every man according to his
[6:11] ways and according to the fruit of his
[6:13] doing and if we turn over in Jeremiah
[6:16] the 29th chapter just a few pages
[6:19] over it says Jeremiah 29 and
[6:23] vers um we'll start at verse 10 it says
[6:27] for thus saith the Lord that after 70
[6:29] years
[6:29] be accomplished at Babylon I will visit
[6:31] you and perform my good word toward you
[6:34] in causing you to return to this place
[6:35] for I know the thoughts that I think
[6:37] towards you sayeth the Lord amen
[6:39] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[6:42] give you an an expected end then shall
[6:45] ye call upon me and you shall go and
[6:47] pray unto me and I will hearken unto you
[6:50] and ye shall seek me and find me now
[6:52] listen to this principle when you search
[6:54] for me with all of your heart and I will
[6:58] be found of you sayeth the Lord and I
[7:00] will turn away your captivity and I will
[7:02] gather you from all the nations and from
[7:04] all the places whether I have driven you
[7:06] sayeth the Lord and I will bring you
[7:08] again to the place where I caused you to
[7:10] be carried away captive God bless you as
[7:13] you take your seats this morning I'm
[7:14] going to take a thought out of those two
[7:16] scriptures uh the thought is going to be
[7:19] examining the intentions examining the
[7:21] intentions of the wicked
[7:23] heart in the Book of Daniel which is the
[7:27] Captivity that Jeremiah is talking about
[7:29] here Daniel comes in the very beginning
[7:32] of the book with one of the most
[7:33] critical principles that we're supposed
[7:35] to take as Believers Daniel the first
[7:37] chapter the Lord actually had set things
[7:40] in motion for Daniel to have a position
[7:42] in the King's house I know some of us
[7:44] may be familiar with the story but the
[7:46] king had this decree to give them a
[7:49] daily provision of meat and wine and
[7:51] then at the end of the three years to
[7:52] bring the appointed ones before me but
[7:55] Daniel took the position in Daniel the
[7:58] 1st chapter: 8 he said said but Daniel
[8:00] purposed in his heart that he would not
[8:02] defile himself with the portion of the
[8:05] king's meat nor with the wine which he
[8:07] drank therefore he requested of the
[8:10] prince of the Unix that he might not
[8:12] defile himself he purposed in his heart
[8:15] to serve the Lord and he chose the
[8:17] harder way in doing that and then
[8:19] throughout all the rest of Daniel's life
[8:21] this principle stayed with him the whole
[8:23] time brother enam says in the
[8:25] handwriting on the wall 1956 he said oh
[8:28] how tricky the devil is how Sly he is
[8:31] Friends watch him out in the scope of
[8:33] the little Ministry that the Lord has
[8:35] given me around the world in different
[8:36] nations and seeing that Sly hand of the
[8:39] devil so tricky how easy he can upset
[8:42] you and make it look like it's the truth
[8:45] yes sir the biggest lie that was ever
[8:47] told had the truth in it the first lie
[8:50] that was ever told had truth in it the
[8:52] first lie the devil told Eve had a lot
[8:54] of Truth in it said she would be open
[8:56] dyed she would have she would be wise
[8:58] she'd have more knowledge and all that
[8:59] was true then he said surely you'll not
[9:01] die but God said you would die so that
[9:05] just settles it keep true to the word
[9:08] and Daniel was going to purpose in his
[9:09] heart that he would be true to God and
[9:12] God's word and while he was down there
[9:14] the Lord could use him see how brother
[9:16] Bon put it while he was down there the
[9:18] Lord could use him why could he use
[9:19] Daniel because he had purposed in his
[9:22] heart and if you want to be used of God
[9:25] purpose in your heart that you'll love
[9:28] him and that you'll serve him and
[9:30] everything will be just fine
[9:34] amen Psalms 119 says wherewithal shall a
[9:39] young man cleanse his way by taking heed
[9:42] there unto according to the word with my
[9:46] whole heart have I sought thee oh let me
[9:48] not Wonder from thy Commandments Thy
[9:51] word have I hid in my heart that I might
[9:54] not sin against thee blessed art thou oh
[9:56] Lord teach me thy statutes and with my
[9:58] lips have I declared all the judgments
[10:00] of thy mouth and I have rejoiced in the
[10:03] way of the of thy testimonies and as
[10:06] much as in all riches I will meditate in
[10:08] thy precepts and have respect under thy
[10:11] ways I will Delight myself in thy
[10:13] statutes I will not forget Thy word so
[10:16] the psalmist here
[10:18] declares you know how can I cleanse my
[10:20] way how you know he's this young man how
[10:23] can I how can I live an undefiled life
[10:25] you know I I have this yearning in my
[10:27] heart which I'm sure every one of us do
[10:29] this morning you have a yearning in your
[10:31] heart you want to live but for the Lord
[10:33] you want that Lord how can I do it how
[10:35] can I cleanse my ways it's one of the
[10:37] most simple yet most important
[10:39] principles of living that Christian Life
[10:42] it's laid within that verse it says take
[10:45] heed according to Thy Word in another
[10:47] translation it says by guarding it
[10:50] according to your word in other words
[10:52] staying focused tying it to your bed
[10:54] post as David would put it you know just
[10:57] as as uh the opening scripture says says
[10:59] in Jeremiah seeking him with your whole
[11:02] heart the Amplified Bible puts it like
[11:05] this with my whole heart have I sought
[11:08] you this is Psalms 119 the 10th verse in
[11:11] the Amplified with my whole heart have I
[11:14] sought you inquiring for and of you and
[11:17] yearning for me or yearning for you now
[11:20] look at how they put this next verse oh
[11:22] let me not Wonder or step aside either
[11:26] in ignorance or willfully from your
[11:30] Commandments in ignorance or
[11:33] willfully just laying this kind of a
[11:36] foundation here if we if just kind of
[11:38] going to bounce around here if that's
[11:39] all right but God looks at the heart the
[11:41] Lord came to Samuel the prophet in the
[11:43] Old Testament while he was searching for
[11:45] the right king of Israel he told him
[11:47] don't look at the countenance of a man
[11:49] don't look at the outward but rather
[11:50] know that I look at the heart of a man
[11:53] 1st Samuel 16:7 says but the Lord said
[11:55] unto Samuel look not on his countenance
[11:57] nor the height of his stature because
[11:58] because I have refused him for the Lord
[12:00] seeth not as a man seeth for a man
[12:03] lookth on the outward but the Lord
[12:04] lookth on the heart thank the Lord for
[12:07] that I know you know I'm I'm jumping
[12:09] around here
[12:10] but we're going to look at a man in the
[12:13] Bible there was a man in the Bible by
[12:14] the name of balum that I'd look at like
[12:16] to look at this morning balum actually
[12:18] had a prophetic gift of operate you
[12:21] operating in his life and at that time
[12:23] in history just to set the background of
[12:25] events for a moment Israel was on the
[12:27] move and the rumor of the victories that
[12:30] the Lord had manifested among them were
[12:32] beginning to spread through those
[12:34] neighboring Nations the battle the
[12:36] battles won against the Canaanites and
[12:38] the amorites had spread through the land
[12:40] and the Israelites were actually in
[12:42] route to the land of Moab and the moabit
[12:45] king at the time was a man by the name
[12:47] of Balo son of zippor and he was
[12:50] desperately afraid the Bible says of the
[12:52] Israelites because of their numbers and
[12:54] because they he knew that they had
[12:56] defeated those neighboring Nations so he
[12:59] heard of a prophet that had a good
[13:01] reputation numbers 226 says come now
[13:04] therefore I pray thee curse me this
[13:06] people for they are too Mighty for me
[13:09] per Adventure I shall Prevail that we
[13:10] might Smite them that and I and that I
[13:13] may drive them out of the land for i w
[13:16] that ye whom thou blessed is blessed and
[13:19] whom thou cursed is cursed so he
[13:21] recognized the gift that was operating
[13:23] in balam's life and he said I know that
[13:25] whatever you bless balum is blessed and
[13:27] I know whatever you curse is cursed so
[13:29] I'm going to take that gift I I I want
[13:31] you to come to my nation and I want you
[13:33] to curse this nation that's going to
[13:35] come up a rise rise against me Bayo Bao
[13:38] knew Bayo knew from the beginning what
[13:41] his intentions are he he said from the
[13:43] from the beginning I want you to curse
[13:45] this
[13:46] nation and balum started off with what
[13:50] seemed to be right he inquired of the
[13:53] Lord and the scripture says the message
[13:58] of the message message from God was
[14:00] plain and simple God said unto balum
[14:02] Thou shalt not go unto them numbers
[14:04] 22:12 Thou shalt not curse this people
[14:08] for they are blessed so he got the word
[14:10] from the Lord he inquired of the Lord he
[14:12] got the word of the Lord and he told uh
[14:15] balum told The Messengers look I can't
[14:17] go what God God says is blessed I can't
[14:21] go and curse What God Says is blessed so
[14:23] he sent the messengers away um but that
[14:26] didn't stop the the king of Moab so then
[14:29] he sent I know this is probably a
[14:30] familiar a familiar story for most of us
[14:32] but he then sent another group of
[14:34] Messengers over to balum but for this
[14:36] time he had a more enticing offer I will
[14:38] promote you he says to unto great honor
[14:41] and I will do whatsoever thou sayest
[14:42] unto me come therefore I pray thee and
[14:45] curse me this people and you see this
[14:47] the request was the same as before but
[14:50] this time he came with something greater
[14:52] you know I I I'll I'll give you what you
[14:55] want I'll give you I'll give you land
[14:56] I'll give you riches I'll give you these
[14:58] things
[14:59] and instead of balum sticking to what
[15:01] God had said the first time he inquired
[15:03] of the Lord again this time the Lord
[15:06] said to balum go ahead and go and
[15:09] brother Brandon picks this up and shows
[15:11] that you know God's word the first time
[15:13] was God's perfect will and his word the
[15:16] second time was his permissive will
[15:18] because he wanted to balam obviously had
[15:20] it in his heart to go and so the Lord
[15:23] wasn't going to wasn't going to stop
[15:25] that he just said now look brother
[15:26] Brenham says in the children of Israel
[15:28] 19 47 now look there is a perfect will
[15:30] of God there's a permissive will of God
[15:32] and God permitted his Prophet to go yet
[15:35] it wasn't his perfect will it was his
[15:38] permissive will and that's because God
[15:40] doesn't want to force us any into
[15:42] anything he told he said bam you can go
[15:45] and you do this but if you choose to do
[15:47] that you can only prophesy the words
[15:50] that I give unto you you see the Lord
[15:52] searched the heart and the intentions of
[15:55] Bam's heart and brother Brenham refers
[15:57] to Bam and we know know this probably uh
[15:59] very familiar he refers to him as a
[16:01] hirling prophet even though out of his
[16:03] mouth were coming words of Prophecy that
[16:06] what the Lord had said um his actions
[16:08] proved that somewhere in his heart he
[16:10] wanted to go down to Moab he wanted to
[16:12] go do that and uh you know his heart
[16:15] wasn't focused on the the right thing
[16:17] you see that's why we can't ever base
[16:20] our uh base things solely on feelings or
[16:24] base things on intentions because you
[16:26] could have the purest of intentions
[16:29] and it not being according to the word
[16:31] right you could have the purest
[16:32] intentions in your heart maybe you know
[16:34] just to bring it down to our level maybe
[16:36] to be in a relationship with someone who
[16:37] doesn't know the Lord and you have
[16:39] intentions in your heart that you know
[16:41] down the road that you know I want this
[16:42] person to be of God but and those
[16:44] intentions are good but it's not lying
[16:47] up with what God's word says be not
[16:49] unequally yolked you want them to come
[16:52] to the Lord and that you know that old
[16:54] saying follow your heart you know that's
[16:56] just a lie from the enemy Jeremiah
[16:58] teaches us as we read that your heart is
[17:01] deceitful and wicked above all things
[17:03] you see and even when you're born again
[17:05] of the spirit of God brother Matt was
[17:08] talking on it Wednesday night wonderful
[17:09] sermon you you still have that sticky
[17:12] nature right you still have that thing
[17:14] and sometimes your flesh man the Fallen
[17:17] nature that you still live in sometimes
[17:19] it leads you somewhere and thinking you
[17:21] know the whole time that it's the right
[17:23] decision and you have the purest
[17:25] intentions but it's out of God's perfect
[17:27] will even when you're born again of the
[17:29] spirit of God because we live in the
[17:31] Fallen nature that we live in right so
[17:34] and then you can enter into the land of
[17:36] God's permissive will I know I never
[17:38] want to be in that land
[17:41] um just to go through some of some more
[17:43] of the story with Baum he says um after
[17:47] going back to the Lord and asking again
[17:49] again the Lord allows him to make his
[17:51] own decision so scripture says that he
[17:52] saddled his donkey he departed towards
[17:54] Moab and it says that the Lord's anger
[17:57] was kindled against BM and you know just
[18:00] to take that from a different angle for
[18:02] a moment you know the Lord's anger was
[18:03] kindled against him because God cares
[18:06] about you he cares about the decisions
[18:08] you make he cares about the path that
[18:10] you take he doesn't want you to go down
[18:13] his permissive will because he sees his
[18:15] thoughts are higher than our thoughts
[18:16] his ways are higher than our ways so he
[18:18] sees that that path is going to lead to
[18:20] something so destructive in your life so
[18:23] his anger was kindled against balam
[18:24] because maybe you know he saw what was
[18:26] going to come about this later on read
[18:28] balam ends up being on the side of Moab
[18:30] and being being slain with with the
[18:33] enemies in the enemy's land and in the
[18:35] Book of Revelation you know it he's made
[18:38] an example of you know he he was just
[18:40] used used by the
[18:43] enemy God cares so much about you
[18:47] scripture says he formed you before
[18:49] before he formed you in the womb he knew
[18:51] you and he crafted out your life so
[18:54] going further with the story you know
[18:57] the angel of the Lord anoints the eyes
[18:59] of a donkey you know the donkey saw the
[19:02] angel standing in the way and three
[19:03] different times the donkey turned aside
[19:05] from the path three warnings from the
[19:07] Lord to stay clear of this destructive
[19:10] path but balam's eyes were so fixated on
[19:14] something that you know maybe he thought
[19:16] in his own life would have been you know
[19:18] something constructive but he was so
[19:20] fixated he had the wrong int maybe he
[19:23] had the right intentions but his heart
[19:25] was in the wrong place maybe maybe he
[19:27] thought the Lord could use this
[19:28] situation for good and finally after
[19:31] striking the the the donkey several
[19:33] times starting to kill it know that
[19:35] story quite a funny story actually the
[19:38] Lord anointed the donkey to speak to
[19:41] balam and while he was speaking to the
[19:43] donkey the Lord actually opened balam's
[19:46] eyes to see the angel numbers 22 it says
[19:49] the Lord opened the mouth of the ass and
[19:51] he said unto balum what have I done unto
[19:53] thee that thou smitten me these three
[19:55] times bam said to the ass because thou
[19:57] has mocked me I would that there would
[19:59] be a sword in mine hand for now I would
[20:01] kill thee and the ass said unto balam am
[20:04] I not an ass upon that thou which has
[20:05] ridden ever since I was thine unto this
[20:08] day was I ever want to do so unto thee
[20:11] and he said nay then the Lord opened the
[20:14] eyes of balum and he saw the angel of
[20:17] the Lord standing in his way and his
[20:19] sorn drawn in his hand and he bowed down
[20:22] his head and fell flat on his face and
[20:24] the angel of the Lord said unto him
[20:26] wherefore H hast thou smitten thine n
[20:28] these three times behold I went out to
[20:30] withstand thee because look listen to
[20:32] this because thy way is perverse before
[20:36] me and immediately balam fell to the
[20:38] ground he worshiped the Lord and just to
[20:41] uh save just some time here the Lord
[20:43] asked him why are you going to go into
[20:45] this place when I clearly told you the
[20:47] first time not to go um you know balam's
[20:50] answer spoke of his intentions if it
[20:52] displeases you Lord then I can turn
[20:55] around but you see all those warnings
[20:57] all those things
[20:58] you know God still let him chose his own
[21:01] path bam said unto the angel of the Lord
[21:02] I have sinned um and the angel of the
[21:06] Lord said unto balum go with the men but
[21:08] only the word that I speak unto you Thou
[21:10] shalt speak so balum went with the
[21:12] princes of baac and he went there and we
[21:15] see where it led balum eventually he
[21:17] gave in he helped the moabites give
[21:19] counsel against the Israelites and what
[21:21] happened to balum not much later we find
[21:23] him on that side slain um numbers 31 and
[21:27] they slew the king of Midian um five
[21:29] Kings of Midian balam also the sons of
[21:31] beor they slew with the sword um Joshua
[21:35] 13 says balum also the son of beor the
[21:38] soothsayer the Bible says did the
[21:39] children of Israel slay with the sword
[21:42] among them that were slain by them and
[21:44] they were slain by the Israelites and we
[21:46] find him in Revelation 2 as an example
[21:48] he it says because but I have a few
[21:51] things against thee because thou Hast
[21:53] there them that hold the doctrine of
[21:55] balum who taught Balo to cast a
[21:57] stumbling in Block before the children
[22:00] of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto
[22:02] idols and to commit fornication so you
[22:04] see now in Revelation years later that
[22:08] what had happened is that balum had
[22:10] actually given in and and given Bayo
[22:13] something to to cast a stumbling block
[22:16] before Israel
[22:18] right what did balum do in this story is
[22:21] he didn't hold the word of the Lord he
[22:24] didn't take heed according to the word
[22:26] as that scripture says and it wasn't
[22:28] first and foremost in his life a
[22:31] commentator writes God sees your heart
[22:33] so heed his call and this Wayward uh
[22:36] bent of balam's heart that continued in
[22:38] wickedness is a telling tale of the
[22:41] inability to hide our hearts from god
[22:45] wow even in the New Testament we see the
[22:47] true character of balum recalled in
[22:49] first second Peter the second chapter um
[22:53] but he was rebuked for the wrongdoing by
[22:55] a donkey an animal without speech who
[22:57] spoke with a human voice and restrain
[23:00] the prophet's Madness second Peter
[23:01] chapter 2 so he sees your heart amen and
[23:05] he knows that there will be times where
[23:07] it does Lead You astray because he knows
[23:10] that we live in that Fallen flesh but he
[23:13] doesn't leave you there to stay thank
[23:15] the Lord Psalms 139 says oh Lord thou
[23:20] has searched me and known me search me
[23:23] oh God and know my heart try me and know
[23:27] my thoughts and see if there be any
[23:30] wicked way in me and Lead Me into the
[23:33] way Everlasting amen look at David's
[23:37] attitude there Lord search me know my
[23:39] heart try me try my thoughts I you know
[23:41] I have this I have this thought on My
[23:43] Heart Lord I have this intention and
[23:45] Lord it seems to be pure it seems to
[23:48] line up with your word it seems to be
[23:50] pure to its core but Lord I'm going to
[23:52] check it with your word anyway Lord
[23:54] please just come and come and manifest
[23:56] yourself to me and make sure that there
[23:58] wouldn't be any wicked way found in me
[24:02] amen cuz the Lord sees the path he sees
[24:05] the beginning of the path and he sees
[24:07] the end of the path so maybe he can
[24:09] discern something in your life that will
[24:11] cause you to not stumble down the road
[24:16] amen the Lord so often times sends his
[24:19] word to correct our path you know he
[24:21] makes his he makes it straight you know
[24:23] but God doesn't ever Force his word on
[24:26] us just just as we read in there in with
[24:28] balum he you know he sent the prophecy
[24:30] he sends the angels to warn him then he
[24:32] anoints the animal but he still chose
[24:34] his own way and in those situations
[24:37] where you know you think that you're
[24:39] just you're on that path we have to
[24:42] Humble ourselves enough and keep our
[24:44] pride in check in those situations and
[24:46] be ready and willing to make those paths
[24:48] straight amen and because our intentions
[24:51] even though driven by the sincere heart
[24:54] and the psalmist says how can a young
[24:55] man cleanse his ways take heed
[24:58] according to the word even if it stops
[25:01] you in your tracks take heed according
[25:04] to the word and do what Daniel did and
[25:07] purpose in Your Heart Take Jeremiah's
[25:09] instruction seek him with your whole
[25:11] heart this story actually reminded me of
[25:14] the the Rich Young Ruler when brother
[25:16] Brenham dives into that story and shows
[25:18] that the rich man that looked up from
[25:20] Heaven uh you know that was correlated
[25:22] with the Rich Young Ruler the Lord
[25:24] searched out his heart and there was
[25:26] something in there that was
[25:28] taking him from fully surrendering we
[25:29] did a Sunday school on it several weeks
[25:31] ago but he searched his heart saw his
[25:33] possessions held a higher standard in
[25:35] his life than the Lord did and he never
[25:37] did surrender to that thing and then one
[25:39] day the Lord saw uh saw him looking up
[25:42] begging for a glass of cold water and he
[25:45] he asked Abraham please send someone to
[25:47] warn my brothers Abraham said if they
[25:49] won't believe the
[25:51] prophets they'll never believe me if I
[25:53] send someone from the grave Luke 16 he
[25:55] says I pray thee father that thou would
[25:57] send some someone to my father's house
[25:59] for I have five Brethren that he may
[26:00] testify unto them lest they come under
[26:03] this place of torment and Abraham said
[26:05] they have Moses and the prophets let
[26:06] them hear that and they said nay Father
[26:09] Abraham but if one went up from the dead
[26:12] they will repent and he said if they
[26:14] hear not Moses and the prophets neither
[26:17] will they be persuaded though one raise
[26:20] from the dead the Lord sends his word he
[26:23] you know he sent his word to balum he he
[26:25] sends everything that he can according
[26:27] to the word he even opens up the eyes of
[26:29] balum on his path to see the angel of
[26:31] the Lord and yet balum still did not
[26:34] surrender and heed to that word you know
[26:37] the rich man tried to send someone from
[26:39] the grave to to to to to warn his
[26:42] brothers but we can see that you know
[26:45] their even if even if someone rose up
[26:48] from the grave Abraham said if they
[26:49] won't take heed according to Thy word
[26:52] from the prophets and from the word that
[26:54] I give on the earth even if I raise
[26:56] someone up from the dead they won't give
[26:58] heed to it you know and
[27:02] um it
[27:04] says that scripture that to try your
[27:08] Reigns that scripture means to examine
[27:13] your secret
[27:14] motives and interestingly enough it's
[27:17] the verse right after the Lord tells us
[27:21] that our heart is deceitful and wicked
[27:23] above all things so he gives us the the
[27:26] word and and then he gives us the answer
[27:29] to the word and each and every time if
[27:32] we can take heed according to that word
[27:34] and examine our hearts Jeremiah 15:16
[27:38] says thy words were found and I did eat
[27:41] them and Thy Word was unto me the joy
[27:43] and the rejoicing of my heart for I am
[27:45] called by thy name oh Lord God of hosts
[27:48] that that scripture your words were
[27:50] found and I ate them I read this
[27:53] commentary and it really struck me the
[27:55] other day it says I have said that
[27:57] Jeremiah lets us into a secret his outer
[28:00] life consisting of his Perpetual
[28:03] faithful Ministry was to be accounted
[28:06] for By His inward love of the word which
[28:10] he preached if you go back and you read
[28:11] the the book of Jeremiah just just
[28:13] recently got done reading it it's time
[28:16] after time there there's prophecy after
[28:18] prophecy a warning after warning and you
[28:21] know there it gets to a point where
[28:22] Jeremiah gets so discouraged in one of
[28:25] the chapters he gets so discouraged that
[28:27] he says I can't even I can't even talk
[28:30] about you anymore Lord I I can't even
[28:32] prophesy in your name anymore I'm so
[28:34] discouraged in my heart but then he says
[28:37] but their words were found as as a fire
[28:40] in my bones because I can't not prophesy
[28:44] I can't not give the word and his inward
[28:47] love of that word which he preached
[28:49] gives us something that we can look to
[28:52] and we can we can the the commentary
[28:55] keep goes on to say it is a very
[28:57] different thing from saying Thy Word was
[28:59] found and I did admire it or Thy Word
[29:02] was found and I did criticize it or Thy
[29:05] Word was found and I did divide it and
[29:07] make a sermon out of it that is a
[29:09] Minister's Temptation you know how many
[29:11] times can our hearts be honest and say
[29:13] that we found his word we heard his word
[29:16] we heard what was preached and we did
[29:18] eat it we didn't we didn't just listen
[29:20] to it and admire it with just a a solemn
[29:23] heart but we ate it and we allowed it to
[29:26] digest into our inward man
[29:29] amen Psalms 1 says blessed is the man
[29:33] that we just got a few minutes left
[29:34] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[29:36] the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth
[29:38] in the way of Sinners nor sth in the
[29:40] seat of the scornful but his Delight is
[29:43] in the law of the Lord and in his law
[29:47] doth he meditate day and night amen
[29:51] Psalms 1119 says teach me oh Lord the
[29:54] way of thy statutes and I shall keep it
[29:56] unto my end give me understanding and I
[29:58] shall keep thy law yay I shall observe
[30:01] it with my whole heart make me to go
[30:03] into the path of thy Commandments for
[30:06] therein do I Delight incline my heart
[30:10] unto thy testimonies and not to
[30:13] covetousness so he sees David sees that
[30:16] you know sometimes my heart can be
[30:17] inclined to Covetous things but I want
[30:20] you Lord to Incline my heart unto thy
[30:23] testimonies the Bible says turn away
[30:26] mine eyes from beh holding vanity and
[30:28] listen to this word and Quicken thou me
[30:31] in thy way establish Thy word unto thy
[30:35] servant who is devoted to thy fear turn
[30:38] away thy approach for thy judgments are
[30:40] good behold I have longed after thy
[30:43] precepts quicken in
[30:46] me thy righteousness that word Quicken
[30:49] means to make alive so we pray the
[30:52] prayer to Quicken and make alive thy way
[30:56] and thy rightous
[30:57] in us and so then when we have those
[31:00] intentions when we are on a path it
[31:02] doesn't matter what path that you're on
[31:04] we have to make sure that we keep this
[31:07] word ever before us and we constantly
[31:10] check it with Lord is this is this where
[31:12] you want me to be is this where you need
[31:14] me to be Lord then we then we have to
[31:17] submit our pride a little bit and just
[31:18] say Lord I I'm on this path and it seems
[31:21] so right it seems my intentions are so
[31:24] proper but Lord I don't know for sure so
[31:27] can you look down for me and then can
[31:29] you Quicken me in thy
[31:32] righteousness what was balam's mistake
[31:34] he didn't trust God's word he didn't
[31:36] seek him with his whole heart he didn't
[31:39] follow these statutes and neither did
[31:41] that the Rich Young Ruler but those that
[31:44] did they knew that the only way that it
[31:47] could be done is help from the almighty
[31:51] amen establishing Thy Word in thy heart
[31:53] says the psalmist turn my way eyes from
[31:56] beholding in vanities you know we can't
[31:59] check our decisions I said this before
[32:00] but we can't check our decisions or the
[32:02] road that you're on uh you know with how
[32:05] pure your intentions are or perceive
[32:08] something to be how it may look on the
[32:10] outside we have to check it with the
[32:12] word what does God's word say about it
[32:15] have you prayed about
[32:16] it you know your heart your flesh man
[32:20] it's wicked in every way it leads you
[32:22] away from trusting God just because
[32:24] that's the nature of our of our inward
[32:26] of our outward man it points you down
[32:29] sometimes the wrong direction you know
[32:31] it compromises because compromise
[32:33] sometimes is just the easier way to go
[32:34] it doesn't even you know you don't
[32:36] sometimes choose I'm going to compromise
[32:38] it just sometimes seems like the easier
[32:40] the the easier of two paths to take so
[32:42] then your flesh man will then go down
[32:45] that path amen but if you set your focus
[32:48] on the right thing and you bring that
[32:51] flesh man into captivity and if you set
[32:53] your heart to search only the word and
[32:56] seek him with your your entire heart the
[32:58] Bible says that he will be found of you
[33:02] saith the Lord even if you take the
[33:05] wrong road sometimes even if your heart
[33:07] leads you astray if you're willing to
[33:09] submit he will lead you into the way
[33:13] Everlasting amen glory to God let's all
[33:14] stand together this
[33:19] morning Heavenly Father Lord we're
[33:22] thankful and grateful for your word this
[33:24] morning Father we pray that you could
[33:25] just anoint the song leader as he comes
