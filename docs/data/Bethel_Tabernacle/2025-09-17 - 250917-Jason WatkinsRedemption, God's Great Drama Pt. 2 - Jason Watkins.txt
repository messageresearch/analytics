Brother Benny Perry and Sister Perry will be with us here. They're vacationing in Hilton Head um probably coming in town tomorrow or Friday. And uh so been trying to see if I could get brother Benny down here for quite a while. He hasn't been here in many years and uh probably at least more than a decade I would say. And so I'd been up there a couple of times ministering for him. So he owes me quite a lot. Amen. So we're going to be happy to have him come down and preach for us this Sunday. Praise the Lord. Amen. I think that was all the announcements I had. Just wanted to make you aware of that. We're going to go to prayer just in a little bit. Um kind of in a in a little bit of um of a unique situation. Brother Brad wrote me today to say that they're having a prayer line tonight in his service. And he estimates that right when they're starting to pray for run their prayer line, we'll be in our prayer part. And so I said, "Well, we'll sure have you, Amen, on the list." Amen. Praise the Lord. So we'll be joining with them in the spirit. Genesis chapter 3. We want to take this tonight. Amen. Redemption, God's great drama, part two. Amen. Let's um Oh, let's see. Okay. Um Genesis 3:8-11. And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, "Where art thou?" And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself. And he said, Who told thee that thou was naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should us not eat? Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your word tonight, and we look to it with earnest hearts for all that you will have for us. Lord, it's been a thrill for me throughout the day today to look and study and prepare for this next part, Lord. And I I saw began to look at it even from Sunday. And Lord, you're just so kind to us with your word. So we thank you. We ask that it be effective, Lord, that the spirit of God give us hearing hearts tonight and willing. May we be willing hearts tonight, ready to say amen to every word. Grant it, Lord. Don't let us come up short, Father. Because we realize, Lord, that that you have you have supplied us amply. And if we come up short and don't get what we need, then that's not on you. It's on us, Father. So help us tonight, Lord. We commit it to you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you friends. You can be seated. All right. Um, Gideon, so let's have my PowerPoint up, please. Amen. We'll get the title screen. Amen. I sent it to the Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Good deal. So, I wanted to take and recap just for a few minutes. I want to I've got I'm only going to use this PowerPoint for recap. In fact, because I don't want to be slowed down when I get uh beyond the recap. And I just want to look at Sunday. We were talking about uh various dramas. And so tonight we're going to take a subtitle, face tof face with God. And you'll understand that a little more as we go along. We picked up Sunday and from Sunday we had the garden drama. You'll remember brother Brandham says here when God knew that that shocking state of emergency, his children was lost and he came frantically up and down the through the garden. He went looking under every bush. Adam, oh my son, Adam, where art thou? We went from there and we looked briefly at the at the drama that unfolded at Kadesh Barnea. Brother Brandham calls it at that's his words there, a great drama of the Bible. And from the scripture here, brother Brandham uses this scripture. And Caleb stilled the people before Moses and said, "Let us go up at once and possess it for we are able to overcome it." And that was a big deal. That was a big drama that was being played out. And you talking about drama and some drama queens that were there. And all of those drama queens were saying, "Oh, they're like we're like grasshoppers. They're giants. There's no way. we don't stand a chance. And Caleb, Caleb didn't just, you know, come and say, "Fellas, I really think we can do this. Come on." Rah rah rah. Caleb just said, "Let us go up at once &gt;&gt; immediately. This conversation needs to stop right now. Let's go." God gave it to us. We've already seen it. We know we can take it. I mean, listen, we couldn't get ourselves out of Egypt. God got us out. So, why would we think we couldn't get ourselves in the promised land? God can get us in. See? So I'm I'm here to tell you something friends. Nothing that you face from the cradle to the grave. I'm here to tell you God has the solution. God has a plan. It's a meticulous plan and it involves you. &gt;&gt; See, and so but we we here is here's the rub to that is it's that it's that can we get past our own human frailty? Can we believe tonight that I am predestinated before the foundation of the world? Can I accept that I am predestinated not to fall? I understand I got all kinds of failures. But can I believe what the word has said about me and what God has already prophesied would happen. &gt;&gt; Now you say, "Well, absolutely. Anybody should be able to do that." Well, here was two and a half million people and only two people thought they could. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Even though God had brought them out of Egypt. Impossible. &gt;&gt; They had been trying to get out of there for 430 years. &gt;&gt; Finally, they get out under a mighty hand. They pass through the Red Sea. God and and you know, and they're they're running up down the bank shouting and jumping and playing a tambourine. And suddenly everything is going along. They're everything's uh exactly moving at God's exact pace. And suddenly they get to something that took them by surprise. They weren't expecting to see giant. They didn't expect to feel like grasshoppers &gt;&gt; in the sight of these people. They were looking in the word. They knew it was a land flowing with milk and honey. And God actually proved it to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He actually let them go in and they came back and they said, "It is exactly what God said it would be." Only God didn't tell us about the giants. I'm here to tell you something, friends. I get a big description about what the millennium will be and I and I get I get in the Bible that you there will be perilous times. We of course we know that. I get in the Bible that that we're coming to a time like has never been. But we're constantly running into things that we did not expect to run into. And my question is to you tonight, are you still willing to press? Are you still willing to believe what God has said about you &gt;&gt; and your part in the inheritance? &gt;&gt; Amen. The future drama. We touched on this one. From the junction of time, we're going into the millennium. You believe that? &gt;&gt; It's a prophet. &gt;&gt; We're going into the millennium. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Time will cease at this junction. That junction where this world's 6,000year run in a fallen condition expires. I want you to understand that the earth has an expiration date. &gt;&gt; The earth always had a shelf life. Once sin started, it was only going to go so long. And God was going to use these dramas to bring about redemption. This is all about God redeeming his family. And he's never failed to redeem it. It's incredible that we would imagine that somehow right here at the finish line, he got us all the way to here over 2,000 years and he kept the church going and somehow we won't make it. I'm here to tell you we will make it. I say tonight, let us go up at once and take the land. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are more ca Caleb said we are more than able &gt;&gt; to do it. And so he says here, "Eternity will begin for us and never no more." Now, we realize the earth in the millennium is still living out its seventh day, that seventh day, that last 1,000 years that that Adam and they fell before that that day could be lived out. And so, we're going to go back and get a restored Eden. And that's what the millennium will be. And that's going to be really big and loom large here in just a few minutes. So now that's our future. So we've looked at a garden drama, how it all got started. &gt;&gt; We looked at what Paul said were our examples at Kades Barnea and Paul said we're supposed to learn from that. &gt;&gt; We're not The whole reason that story is in the Bible is so you don't repeat it. So we don't get here right at the crossing overtime and somehow doubt that God can get me there. &gt;&gt; I'm not doubting it. I'm going to go up at once because God said I could do it. &gt;&gt; And we then we're given a future promise of a millennium coming. And I live for it. I look for it every day. Oh, I I I want I just say, "Oh, for the millennium." &gt;&gt; But at the same time, you've often heard me say, "I don't want a shortcut." &gt;&gt; I want to finish my course. I want to finish my course. I'm not looking for a shortcut. I'd like to be there yesterday, but if I still need to be here tomorrow and next week and next month, then I'll say I'm going to stay here and I'm going to fight. And when I cross the line, I'll still be busting devils in the head and running full steam. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you, you know, couple of weeks ago, you know, brother Matt and I, he and I love how concerned he stays over me. He's worries over me almost more than his mama. and he was with he wanted to go with me to see the cardiologist. No, Dad, I'm going. I'm You don't Oh, I'm going. Okay, you're going. So, we're meeting there. And uh when I got done with all my questions and I and the doctor was pretty well spent at that point because he walks in the office, he goes, "Why are you here? I just checked you out of the hospital. You're fine. Go home." And I said, "Well, I had I had some questions I want to ask you." Okay, ask. You know, um you know what exactly happened? Nothing. Well, I had some kind of distress. Yeah, it was nothing. Don't worry about it. You're fine. I said, so what what about, you know, I'm I'm thinking, do I need to scale back on my preaching? Do I need to worry about exercise? He says, I'm putting no restrictions on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have need of no restrictions. And so I, you know, I come around and in a long circle back around, I managed to ask him that again. And he said, and this time he wouldn't even let me finish. I said, "Well, what about?" He said, "I have no restrictions on you." &gt;&gt; So, tonight, friends, I'm free. And when I got done, then Matt pulls out his list. Well, I've got some some more questions. And I seen my poor doctor breathe a sigh. Okay. And then he Matt rattled off his four or five or 30 questions. I don't remember how many it was. And he just said, "Well, I've already answered that. I've already answered that. I've already answered that." And by the before Matt could even finish, he was standing up, walking. I think he was just going to walk out on us, wasn't he, son? He was like, "Goodbye. I've got other patients that actually need my help today." So, I'm happy to report to you tonight. I'm ready to go take it at once. &gt;&gt; I'm ready to go take it at once. I'm I'm not interested in in in taking a shortcut. I want to see the bride of Christ attain obtain every ounce of victory that is promised to her. &gt;&gt; And I want it for myself. And I want it for you. I want it for your families. I want it for your children. &gt;&gt; Do you fault me for wanting it for your children? &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to see us all make it home. &gt;&gt; So, we've got a future drama coming. I hope you're living for it. But not so much that you're not living for the here and now because we also got a present drama of our day unfolding now. That means it's happening in real time. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "What's the matter?" This is the last year before judgment set in on the nation. This is this is Cub Scout days. What's the matter? What makes people so nervous? Why is it even psychiatrists are coming to be prayed for? You remember we read this Sunday. I think I read over it. I don't I didn't use any I didn't put any slides up. Why is it that the world is in a nervous age, a neurotic age? Now he says in three kinds of believers that's a genuine believer when the Holy Spirit not some persuaded by some other person not by some other thing. It doesn't take very long to to for the for the word to find you out whether or not you've just been persuaded into this truth or whether it's actually been revealed to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, not by some other thing, but when the Holy Spirit has revealed to you the word itself and you see the word made plain, vindicated, then the spirit of God come and get into that age for the word for that age and make it manifested. And that is what I underscored on Sunday. The whole point is to make it manifested. It's it's the devil doesn't care that you can quote it. &gt;&gt; He's not worried, you know. He will he'll let you go to church. He'll let you call yourself a believer. It's the life. He doesn't care how religious you are. And he's not afraid of how right and correct you are in your doctrine. Because brother Brandham said he has a secret. What he has a great military secret that what he knows is is even if you are religious even very religious and have and understand all the mysteries but if you miss that life you won't come up in the resurrection anyhow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so he wins by default unless you push on to the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost is something worth pursuing. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you he be not far from any of us. It's not hard to get. All All it requires is a full a full unequivocal, unconditional, no holds barred, nothing held back, a complete surrender and repentance and faith in God and the Holy Ghost is promised to you. &gt;&gt; People don't get it sometimes because they repent 99.99%. And the devil only needs an infantismally small part to get a tow hold on and rebuild his castle right back inside you again. &gt;&gt; It might take him a month or a year or five years, but he'll get that thing rebuilt. And you'll say, "Man, what happened to those days when I love the Lord and my prayer life was on I was on fire for God?" Oh, I'm here to tell you something, friends. That can listen, that can even happen to people who are born again of the spirit. What chance do you have if you've never come all the way in Christ? See, no wonder the the gospel seems difficult and hard. It's not supposed to be. As we read Sunday, Jesus said, "My yoke is easy. My burden is light." See, of course, it would be light. Listen, friends, if I have to lift this pull pit and move it over there, do you know how do you know how a captain gets a flag pole moved in the military? &gt;&gt; Exactly, Mo. He says, "Private, move that flag pole. That's how he does it. And if I need to get this pull pit moved, I got people. Do you think I'll struggle moving it? I'll get it moved. I'll move it. But I won't struggle doing it cuz I'll say, "Brother Luther, come up here. Brother Matt, come over here. Get in. Get up here. Get up here and get this thing moved for me." And and and I'll walk right behind him like as if I'm involved. Okay. Right over here. Right over here. And set it down right there. And let me make sure my toes are out of the way. And I won't break a sweat. I'm here to tell you. He says, "My my yoke is easy. My burden is light." Cuz I'll do all the work. I'll do all the lifting. I just need your whole heart and mind completely committed to my word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Christian life is not hard. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not. It's the grievous part to a Christian is when we don't do that and then we stumble and we fail. That's where that's where we really find ourselves in in despair. So he goes on, it's manifested and then we're at the closing of the history of the world. The book is now being finished. The last line will be wrote across it someday. Hear a prophet. Hear him. Hear him. Don't miss this. &gt;&gt; The last line will be wrote across it someday. It has a shelf life. &gt;&gt; Amen. the the the earth in its current condition, the kingdoms of this world are to become the kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ. &gt;&gt; So, Satan's Eden has an expiration date known to God. &gt;&gt; And I don't want to be here when it expires, friends. Not not at least not on that side of it. I want to make sure that I rode out of heaven with Christ in Revelation 19 and his name is the word of God. And that's good for me because I'm also a part of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says it'll ride across it someday and she'll be closed up. And there is a great drama. See, he keeps going back to this. Brother Brandham says in one place and I think it's in shalom to God. It's all of it's all a drama. All of redemption is a drama being played out. And he says, "And there is a great drama being set and angels are standing over the skies watching." You know what a drama is? The actors are ready. You can see them acting. But you can also see the raptured church making herself ready. It's a great scene. You can see the presence of God vindicating, vindicating, vindicating, and making the great drama that's foretold here in this Bible to act itself out. Oh, I I love that last line. What a time to live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a time to live. Don't let that be lost on you. You're you're coming to the time where the future drama is ready to unfold. You're coming to a time where the last line of code is being written for this age. And after that, once that expires, the program's done and the whole thing gets deleted and a new world begins. Oh, what a time to live. What a time to be alive. Oh, do you feel that down inside your heart tonight, friends? &gt;&gt; What a time to live. So when we come then and we pick up our text tonight because what they heard him in the eth verse and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden. I want you just to pay real close attention because I want to make some some real uh incredible statements that have been incredible to me and I would not by any means make them nor would I be able to make them nor would I have any valid or vindication or validation. They would be unsubstantiated if I if it weren't for the fact that I'm only going to be saying what a prophet said. &gt;&gt; The voice of the Lord God walking in the in the garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves among the uh from the presence of God amongst the trees of the garden. So the Bible describes here a time in this in this part of the early early part of the drama. The Bible is describing a time when Adam experienced God's presence in a very personal way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then sadly, we go on down to the ninth and 10th and 11th verse and suddenly there's a problem. Adam, it it's not like it's been before. God would come down in the cool of the day. And that and even in the Hebrew that word the cool of the day uh literally means it's sometimes even translated as an evening breeze or a gentle wind. You know you know that time in the evening when sometimes and especially in the fall when we have our beautiful millennial weather and it's it's perfect outside and there's no humidity and bugs and you can just walk out in the evening and there's that nice evening breeze &gt;&gt; moving through the air and you just feel like oh my what what a wonderful time. how good it is to be here. I just enjoy this so much. And that's when you can really enjoy nature. All the stifling heat and humidity of summer is gone. And and that and so that's what it means. And friends, that's that's that's what that's what the millennium holds for you. Do you understand that? every every minute of every hour of every day for a thousand years is going to be a wonderful breeze. And you're going to sit back and enjoy the beauty of a millennial world. &gt;&gt; Unencumbered by sin, unencumbered, unpolluted, &gt;&gt; uncontaminated. No more people cursing. No more half-dress. No more beer bottles. No more nothing. No more traffic. No more horns. No more sirens. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And so, so we we see that this was a a a time where God would on purpose at the end of a day would come down and they would have like a a little evening devotional time. And it's something that's always good to have before you go to sleep. I want to tell you something. You really you really should practice. Let me let me tell you. Uh it's a it's a great practice uh to go to sleep talking to the Lord and wake up talking to the Lord. I can tell you from years of doing it, there's nothing like it. There's nothing like shutting my eyes and the last thing I remember, I was talking to the Lord and I'm waking up the next morning and I just pick up the conversation again. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's nothing like being a Christian. Like brother Bam said, if I couldn't be a Christian, I just don't even know what I would do. &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful life. &gt;&gt; And so we find that there's an interruption now. Something's not the same as as it had been day after day, year after year, for however many hundreds of years into that seventh day, they were able to uh enjoy. Uh but at some point, we find verse nine and now God, they're not where they're supposed to be. And God says, "Where art thou?" See, so it's not he can't find them. It's that hey, for every evening at this time, you come to church. Why are you not here anymore? &gt;&gt; You knew that I would be coming. It's church time. Adam, where are you? &gt;&gt; Oh, I I'd say tonight add to the Adams that should be here and aren't here. Adam, where are you? &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; the presence of God is here. And Adam says, you know, he I heard the voice in the garden. I was afraid. It goes on down because I was naked. Who told you you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree? Where have I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? This is a federal case. This was serious business. This was going to break the world if true. This wasn't a light thing. God said, "Surely, surely you haven't done the worldbreaking thing." Adam, where are you at? What has happened? How did you let yourself get into this situation? I put the world under your care and you're about to hand the book of life over to the devil. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Fortunately, Satan's greedy hands couldn't hold it and it went back to God. I'm so glad cuz my name was in that book and I needed it back in God's hands, not the devil's hands. So, these verses, especially, you know, verse eight, they show that God was literally present in the Garden of Eden. Now, of course, we have to weigh that against the the scripture because and and and I don't have all the answers. I can tell you and Brother Brandham didn't give us all the answers and and and there's lots of parts about the millennium we don't even understand to say nothing of the new heavens and the new earth. I don't I can't fully explain to you even what that means that in the new heavens and the new earth in the last chapter of the book of revelation finally for the first time in the whole Bible and it says and God himself shall dwell with man &gt;&gt; and that's never been said until after the millennium and we go into a new heavens and a new earth and God himself shall dwell here is a here is God visibly talking interacting and you're going to see it's astonishingly personal and even physical contact is had according to a prophet describing it. So, but yet I've got the Bible saying no man hath seen God at any time. So, so we realize that God, Brother Brandham taught us and this is where a prophet comes in. He said he took a form something that could be seen. Yes. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; so he has appeared in theophonic appearance and and all down through the ages and sometimes he was in a theophony, sometimes he was actually in a human body that he built for a temporary like when he met Melzdc there um um in Genesis 18. So, so we find then that that verse 8 is literally showing that there's a literal presence of God in the garden walking and interacting with Adam and and Eve and in the cool of the day. And it was, as I've said already, I'll say it again. It was a very direct, very, you couldn't get more direct. And I'm going to read you the quote here in a minute. Just hang on. It was a very direct. It was exceptionally intimate relationship and it was astonishingly literal and actually physical as brother Brennham will describe. Now, the beauty of this, even if I can't explain every jot and tit to you, just take this home with you that this this is the level, whatever you whatever this was, this is the level it will be in a restored earth when God brings Eden back to the earth again in a millennium. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the whole purpose in the millennial world to come where Jesus dwells in the in the flesh glorified and moving among among his family who are also in glorified bodies. But after we find in that after verses 9, 10 and 11 and sin enters the world, then that level of fellowship and that contact was broken and Adam and Eve hid themselves because of their shame. Brother Brandham says here in what does it take to make a Christian life? January 1957. He's describing this scene that we're reading prior to the fall. He's re he's going to describe to you and only a prophet could do this. Look, I figure if Ezekiel can go up there and see all that he saw and wrote about it, and I believe it, and I can see that Moses went up there and saw a tabernacle, and God said, "Make sure you build that one like the one you saw in heaven." Amen. If John can write that he went into the throne room of God, I believe John. &gt;&gt; I believe Moses. I believe, you know why? Because I believe vindicated prophets. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham says, "I can hear." Now, this is their church service. This is the evening time when God would come down for however many hundreds of years, the unbroken years, however many there were. In that first part of that seventh day, I can hear the loving voice of the father say, "Now, we're going to break in on the church service. You ready?" They're they're they're having a little evening devotional right before bed. All right. I can hear the loving voice of the father say, "Children, have you enjoyed yourself today? Papa has come down to kiss you good night and lay you down for the night and a kiss upon the cheek of Adam and a kiss upon the cheek of Eve. And as he lays his big arm out and she lays her head, little dainty head upon his arm as a pillow, they went to sleep and perfect. Nothing can bother them. Few months later, why some people can't keep the victory. I think it's incredible that he's using this to describe in the sermons what does it take to live a Christian life and why some people can't keep the victory. Maybe you need this kind of relationship like Adam had. And I'm here to tell you in Christ that's restored. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when God looked upon Adam, brother Brandham uses the analogy. He said sometimes my wife and I will go into the room at night and little Joseph, I think he's about nine years old. Well, let's see here. would have been even younger than that, maybe six years old, five or six years old. Actually, probably four years old. And and brother Brandham said they would go in there and and pray with him and kiss him good night and tuck him in. And he said me and mother would stand back many times and say, "Oh, isn't he adorable? Isn't he beautiful? He looks like you, Billy. He looks like this one. Looks like this one." And brother Brandon moves from there. He says, "And when God looked upon Adam and Eve and seen it was, they resembled him, for they was made in his image, how he kissed them, and how his great heart must have felt." Here's a dad looking down at his son who's in his image. And knowing how he feels, he said, "How much more God must have felt when he come down into the cool of the evening, and there was his son and his son's wife in church, right where they were supposed to be, worshiping the Lord. And you were to hear it. I I left off a lot of the description. Go back and and catch what does it take to make a Christian life and why some people can't keep the victory January and March of 57. And brother Brandham talks about that God would come down and they would they had a forest church and they would go to the altar and there they'd begin to commune and God would come. He said the thunder would clap and and the wind would blow and here he would come down through the woods and drop right down in among them. Why? because he's coming in to tuck them in for sleep. He's coming to kiss him on the cheek. This is a very personal God. &gt;&gt; This is how God wants your relationship to be with him. Make no mistake about it. This is what you're learning from Genesis. &gt;&gt; He's not impersonal. He's not a way off somewhere. He's not on a vacation. He's very present. He wants to be very present and very real and very literal in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought to myself today when I read this these quotes I thought what a different kind of conversation is found in Genesis 3 9-11. Adam, where art thou? What a different kind of a conversation from however many years it was into that seventh day that that before the fall. However many years that was or how many days we don't I don't know I don't know if brother Brandham ever said and I I don't know of a scripture that that identifies it just somewhere in that seventh day. I know they didn't get to finish it out but what a difference it was. Listen friends, God made a way to get Adam and Eve back. &gt;&gt; There was a time when you made in his image were a part of God and you had fellowship with the father. Brother Brandham said, "You don't remember it because there's a veil over your memory." And then son, then one day we were born here in the earth and we were cut off from God, but God got us back. God came back and pulled you back into a relationship with him again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, but but I don't I don't have that physical contact." You're mistaken. &gt;&gt; You are the physical contact. It's the Holy Ghost living inside you. You're He has no hands but your hands. This is the beauty of Christianity in a lost world that God like in Genesis is giving sinful people the opportunity to contact God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To literally come and and respect you and believe you and have faith in you and for no other reason and based on no other contingency receive eternal life for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't underestimate what God has in in plans for daily usage. You say, "I'm a nobody. God can never use me." You are so wrong. You couldn't be more wrong than that. See, so how sin had changed that perfect setting in Eden, that perfect life, that that perfect product of the word. And brother Brandham teaches us that as long as the as long as the word was followed, it would have remained perfect forever. And and so that's what I was saying earlier. I don't want it to be lost on us tonight that this time of of perfection that a prophet is describing because you don't you don't get so much of that detail. It took a prophet in this day to give you detail that Moses didn't include. and and and this this perfection that they had is literally a reflection of how close God desires. Brother Brandon wasn't giving us those details to give us more theology. He was pointing to the fact that this is how God wants to have a relationship with me and you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why he's willing to come to you in the morning if you'll meet him. That's why he's willing. If you're in a crisis in the day, you can step aside and say, "Father," and he's so quickly ready to help you. That's why at night you can go to sleep talking to him, wake up talking to him. He's a real person. &gt;&gt; And I get it, friends. We're sometimes we have doubts of our own our own position. and you're we we get like Sister Georgie Bruce and I you're going to love me uh referring to you as Sister Georgie Bruce. And the reason you're going to love it is because she was uh she was a real Christian lady. And Brother Brandham testifies to that on tape. A very godly sister, a real Christian, full of the Holy Spirit. And Brother Brandham told her, he says, "Sister Georgie," because she's back there at an interview. But brother Brandham, I just I I don't know if I'll make it. I I want the Holy Ghost. And Brother Brandham is trying to let her know. Sister, you've been a Christian for years. You've long ago had an experience. What are you so worried about? And just keeps talking to her. And he keeps letting her talk and he keeps talking and she keeps talking and and he he's trying to he's trying to position her in the word of God. But sister, he you're a great sister. I've known you. I've watched your life. I've watched your life for years. I've never known you to be anything other than a gallant Christian sister. And you know what she did? She came back with what we often come back to God with. But I but brother Brandham, I make so many mistakes. Can I give you a prophet's response to her? That's why Jesus had to die. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he didn't give a a theological exit Jesus. He didn't write an essay. He didn't he didn't pull out the Greek and the Hebrew. He said, "Sister, but Brother Brandham, I make so many mistakes. I just want to say, Lord, but I make so many mistakes. How do you keep loving me? That's why I had to die, son. Because I saw you and I'm not going to lose you and I love you." I'm going to here to tell you tonight, you bring your so many mistakes to the Lord. And he'll forgive you for every last one of them tonight. &gt;&gt; If we confess our sin, he's faithful and just to forgive us. that you remember I I was at you remember years ago, many of you probably wouldn't remember it. We played the video testimony of brother Dawson Riley and he was the the the lion hunter that took brother Brandham on lion hunts and they would lay out in the wilderness and and and and he gave a testimony how that one time he he he he got tangled up and I think it involved a you know some bad situation with some illicit uh woman and and it just it just he was so destroyed over it. He he couldn't believe that he had let himself, you know, and not not talking about adultery. Wasn't a married man. Not talking about that. But but he had he had he had been where he shouldn't have been and was involved in things he shouldn't have been. And and he just felt so bad cuz now he's got to be with brother Brandham. And he said, you know, you can't hide things from a prophet. And he said all day long, he said, I I tried to hide it. I tried to keep it down. He said, but but he said, it just got me. And he said, finally, he said, brother Brandon begin to talk about it. He said, I knew he knew what was happening. And he said, "We stopped the car and he said,"I just had to get out. I couldn't sit there in the presence of that prophet knowing he could see my whole life." And he said, "I got out and I walked back and I sat down on the guardrail, I believe it was." And he said, "Brother Brandom, come walking back there just like I would or you would." I'm glad God sent us just a real man. &gt;&gt; He just sent us a real man. He wasn't some great king. He wasn't some monarch. He was just a sassifrass homegrown hillbilly. and he just walks back there with with such authority and he says, "Brother Dawson, Satan set a trap for you and you fell for it." Now, you would think, "Oh my goodness, then I'm doomed for sure." His very next words, according to Brother Riley, God will forgive you if you'll ask him. Oh, he said, "Ask him. Oh Lord, will you forgive me?" And he said, "At that moment, God forgave me and I was completely restored." I'm here to tell you, I got so many mistakes. You got so many mistakes. Bring your so many mistakes to the King of Kings. He wants you to come to him. &gt;&gt; Don't go the opposite direction. Come toward him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the Israel did when he came down on the mountain and they retreated back and Moses ran to him. Said, "Don't back up. Go forward. He He wants to talk to you. No, we're too sinful. He's too scary. No, you've got him all wrong. He wants to be a father to you. He's got a He got a promised land. He loves you. You're you're you're his family. And somehow they had a hard time believing that. Oh, don't you have a hard time believing that tonight, friends? The whole reason you're able to comprehend the love of God is because you're part of God's family. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Once we start to believe the eternal truth that is it is it is unviable. It cannot be violated. It cannot be altered. It cannot be changed when you tonight can accept the eternal word that God knew you before the foundation of the world and will not lose you. Full stop. &gt;&gt; Full stop. &gt;&gt; Come on. Don't Don't let the devil add an addendum to that. Don't let you don't let your own weary mind add an addendum to that. He knew me before the foundation of the world. He sent Jesus to die. The blood speaks for me. Brother Brandham said, "How can he see me? How can I be guilty a sinner when he can't even see my sin?" &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; This is the drama. &gt;&gt; This is part of the redemption drama. You're part of the redemption drama. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. This isn't just Bible stories. You're writing a second book of Acts. &gt;&gt; And that's not just the second book of Acts. The book of Acts isn't just about miracles. The book of Acts is about sinners repenting. &gt;&gt; The book of Acts is people who didn't have the Holy Ghost came to Christ and got the Holy Ghost. This last day church is writing an entire book of Acts behind it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'm so glad he sees it like that. I I don't know what I would do. Brother Brandham says here, he says, "And God wanted us to be uh earthly creatures." This is from Shepherd of the Sheepfold, 1956. He said, "God wanted us to be earthly creatures." It was, you see, that's why there's a millennium. That's why you're going to be there &gt;&gt; cuz God wanted you to be earthly creatures. &gt;&gt; He's got a heaven full of angels. He wanted sons and daughters to be earthly creatures. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham explains that. I I I just got a little bit of a snippet here, but if you go back and listen to that message, he explains it in detail. God wanted us to be earthly creatures. It was sin that made us die and go off this earth. See, when we die, we we leave the earth. God put us here to be here forever. You understand? That's what the millennium restores. That's what the new heavens and the new earth. God didn't you weren't you weren't created to die. That's that wasn't God's doing. That's sin doing that. See, it was sin that made us die and go off the earth. It's sin that brought old age and sickness on. But when all that's done away with, his creatures and his delegates of his great domain will be just like they was in the Garden of Eden, without sin, without death. He says in 1965, "Things that are to be, but we're going to a real place where we're going to do things. We're going to live. We're going to work. We're going to enjoy. We're going to live. We're going to life to real eternal life. We're going to a heaven, a paradise. Just like Adam and Eve worked and lived and eat and enjoyed in the Garden of Eden before sin came in. So based on that, I can say just like Adam and Eve worked and lived and enjoyed and worshiped and prayed and got kissed good night and had a personal relationship with Almighty God walking among them. That's what he's restoring back to us in Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like Adam and Eve before sin came in, we're on our road back there again. There's your drama. We're on our road back there again. Right. Right back. Oh, I'm so glad, friends, he sent us a a perfect word to take us back to that perfect Eden. You're talking about an end of darkness. Think about that. You're here you are. You're coming up on the age and and and how we should be rejoice. You are the you the Bible says this is the generation upon whom the ends of the world will come. You're going to see the end of darkness. Oh, I want to see that. I want to see the end of darkness. I want to see myself in a new body. I want to see you in a new body. I want to see a new earth. Oh, hallelujah. The end of all darkness, the end of all thread, the end of all of that stuff. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Oh, the second Eve. Think about it, friends. The second Eve now with a commission to bring Christ back, predestinated not to fall, ordained and chosen to believe every word of God. You see, you see, when you think about it that way, you realize that in the millennium, we we walk out upon the ashes of the wicked to rebuild the earth. And you say, "Hm, wonder what that's going to be like. I mean, we're going to rebuild the earth. Uh, so we're going to have tools and equipment or is it going to be spoken word? Is it are we going to wave our hands? Are we going to have magic wands? I mean, what how what do you mean we're going to rebuild the earth?" Well, can I just say to you today that the equipment has already been field tested with a prophet in the woods when he said, "Say where they'll be. You don't have to worry about rebuilding Eden." I'm here to tell you the power of the spoken word has already been identified among us. It's already been field tested. It's already passed the test. It creates things. &gt;&gt; It doesn't just renew. It doesn't just rebuild. It doesn't just restore. It takes nothing and turns it into something. Oh, I'm so glad for a perfect word that could take a nothing and turn me into something. Not not patch me up, but make me a new creation in Christ Jesus. This is exactly what brother Brandham was showing us because we already know it works. A a prophet has already showed it in operation. Brother Brandham says it like this and look away to Jesus. He says, "So now, oh, I got to I got to close. Let me close with this. So now I'm going to say something to you now that I haven't said all along. And this is 1963, December 1963. Look away to Jesus. And this is the thing that we have looked forward to for so long. &gt;&gt; He's talking about the third pull. &gt;&gt; And an element of the third pull of course is the open word. The element of the third pull is the power of the spoken word. The ele the third pull is a broad term. And I'm not here tonight to dissect it all down, but let just suffice to say that it's the it's the word in the mouth of the bride. &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom describes that in the fourth seal. If you go there and he says like from God's mouth to Moses mouth said, Moses, you go out there. He said because God uses man and you call for this and you call for that. And he said it'll happen because it'll be the mouth of God speaking through the the mouth of Moses. See, so it's the power of the spoken word. Now watch. So he says this is the thing we have looked forward to for so long. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says for at least many years, four or five years or maybe longer. And that's exactly right because brother Brandham in 1959 he's already tested it in the woods of Indiana and two weeks later testes it again in the woods of Kentucky and God just says say where they'll be and he says he'll be right there and there he was and then when he shoots one and can't find it and brother and God just says we'll just say where it'll be. Oh, I'm here to tell you something friends. Brother Brandham almost felt like he was losing his mind. I've preached on that before. He was, he thought he was going crazy. And the next thing you know, he's in the woods screaming out, "Where are you? What do you want?" And he said, "Usually I see that light. I hear a voice and I see a light. This time I just I'm hearing voices. Am I going crazy? Who are you?" And it was because God was not going to let him take that scripture. If you say to this mountain, "Be moved." And brother Brandon wouldn't preach on that. He said, "Because I did not understand how if I said because I thought everything had to be in the atonement, meaning that it would be Christ saying it. I couldn't say that. Everything had to be in the atonement." So, Brother Brandham said, "I just made up my mind that if somebody ever asked me, well, what about that?" He said, "I would just say, well, that was before Calvary, so that was before the atonement." Which was a perfectly good Baptist answer, but it's not one that God was going to let him get by with. And God takes him into the woods and almost drives him to the point of insanity to show him that God meant exactly what he said. If you say to this mountain and brother Brandham when he couldn't get it, oh, I'm so glad I I forgive me for saying it this way. I'm so glad brother Brandham couldn't get it. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he just had a hard time believing it. &gt;&gt; Did I say that out loud? Go listen to it yourself. I invite you. go back and listen to the tapes. Go back and listen to him tell the stories. And and and he he he's he's struggling with it. He's doubting it. He's admitting he's doubting it. He can't he's not doubting God's word. He just can't. He's doubting that it could possibly be true about him. &gt;&gt; Isn't that what we doubt? We don't doubt God's word, but we doubt that it could be true about me. And God just said to him, you know, when you know the secret of people's hearts and you're able to cast out devils and do do you think that's you doing that? And brother Brandham caught it. Oh, all he needed was that example. And he said, "No, Lord, that's you." He said, "I realize then that any man, any son and daughter of God who's willing to live in those high atmospheres, if you say to this mountain, oh, and don't doubt it in your heart. I'm here to tell you something, friends. you you're hearing God say tonight, "Do you think it's you that makes you overcome sin? Do you think it's you that makes you a believer in 2025 when the world is abandoning it and the world is crazy and you're still here a bunch of weirdo oddball believers?" &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you, it's not you doing it. It's Christ in you doing it. &gt;&gt; And it's that same Christ where he says here, and that was in 1959. And even prior to that, God had already told him about his the next phase of his ministry coming. So, brother Brandham says this is this is 63. So, he'd had the squirrels in 59. I think it's around 57 58. He was told about his another his next ministry, the third pull. And he says, "For at least, this is what we have looked forward to for so long. For at least many years, four or five years or maybe longer. Hang on, I'm almost done. The third pull has now been vindicated. And I'm sure you all know what it is. See, and he says, he says, "Now remember, there'll never be an impersonation of that." &gt;&gt; Cuz it can't be. See, do you realize how secure God's word is from the third pole is from the devil impersonating it? People who don't have the Holy Ghost can't even impersonate a real Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan can't even get an impersonation of a real Christian. How's he going to get an impersonation of the spoken word of God? Oh, hallelujah. He says, remember, there'll never be an impersonation cuz it can't be. See, it cannot be now. It's inexistent. And I am warned of this that soon, right at this time now, it's just happened. So here's why. So it could identify its presence among you. But it will not be used in a great way until the church until the council begins to tighten up. And when it does, the Pentecostal and so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done. But when that time comes, when the squeeze comes down, then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested. There's that. There's that word again. Be manifested in the fullness of its power. Oh my precious brother and sister. You say when the squeeze is coming, whatever you do, don't go singing the song somewhere over a rainbow. I'm here to tell you the squeeze is upon us &gt;&gt; and the world is falling apart. And even the whole world knows it.
