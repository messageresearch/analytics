I'm gonna finish it amen I want to preach to you this evening the Lord being my helper with a title I'm taking hiding in plain sight you'll understand it better by and by Philippians CH 4 verse 10 and we'll go 10 11 12 and 13 we'll let you be seated but I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again wherein ye were also careful but you lacked opportunity not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned in whatsoever State I am therewith to be content I know both how to be a based and I know how to abound everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me let's pray father we thank you Lord for your presence in our midst tonight now Lord we want to gather our thoughts and focus our mind in your word Lord and we want to Humble ourselves and submit ourselves into the control of the Holy Spirit father this is after all your word lord it's your plan it's your people it's your church it's all about you Lord so we're just here tonight to assist you in speaking to your people you're the one chose this methodology ology Lord and we're just happy to stand here at your side and assist you in any way we can I pray you give us Open Hearts tonight hearing hearts Lord grant us hearing hearts in your word Lord not only in this visible audience but across the airwaves and times to come in the archive people who will see it we commit it to you in Jesus name amen God bless you you can all be seated amen praise the Lord my whole church full of Honeys can be seated amen amen praise God you ready for some good practical thoughts from the word of God what we might call uh you know rather on the Deep Side of expository preaching but tonight I just have simple thought that that has struck my heart I've actually um brother uh Josh brother Gideon and uh brother Uriah actually heard some of this material in in one of our morning devotionals there at Watkins mechanical that we do on Tuesday Mornings actually G Manic goes all the way back to the very first one we ever did but we titled it different and my angle was different and uh but I'm I'm borrowing some of that you might recognize parts of it tonight so good deal you must need to hear again praise the Lord that's right I can say that to my grandson right the phrase hiding in plain sight is quite archaic it goes way back some of the earliest writings where it actually appeared in literature it seems to be a rural saying and some of the earliest times that I could find um with not a very in-depth study but it looked like it went all the way back to the late 1800s and they were using this this statement or statements similar to it and it refers to something or someone that is not concealed but remains unnoticed uh and that can that can be simply due to human perception limitations uh originally it was a military tactic and I thought wow that doesn't surprise me because that's what it means when you hear them say we need to create a diversion and so because they're going to move through an open area where they're going to be noticed and so we need a diversion so that we can run in in plain sight and no one will notice so it suggests that objects can be overlooked even when they are clearly visible the concept was popularized in literature most notably by uh Edgar Allen Poe and he emphasized that the best hiding places are very often the most obvious places the phenomenon and that's what they call it the phenomenon is linked to and I didn't know this was a term I got to make sure I say it right inattentional blindness now not unintentional inattentional intentional blindness where f focus on one aspect causes neglect of others so I want to speak of something this evening that may be hiding in plain sight from you Philippians 4:11 Paul said not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned in whatsoever State I am therewith to be content in fact as this passage in Philippians 4 is called the contentment Passage and and that's because of its practical teaching towards contentment as a lifestyle now I think that that you would agree with me tonight that it that even just a brief observation of the world order that we live in today we can see that contentment is pretty grossly overlooked as a virtue um everybody is chasing that hustle and fact is it's almost deafening uh these days the shout uh the shouts of entitlement that we hear constantly everywhere it's it's permeating the fabric of society itself and it's it's it's every gender it's every race it's every Creed it's every age doesn't matter everybody feels entitled and everybody feels like it's somebody else's fault and everybody feels like somebody owes me and if you understand that the age that we live in being the leoan church age historically speaking leoa means by definition people's rights so this is the age for that so it doesn't surprise us it doesn't take us catch us off guard I would even go as far as to say that a lack of real contentment ought to be here it is a sign of the nearing time when a new world is going to come into being where I promise you contentment is going to be a reigning virtue amen contentment is so powerful a force for peace of mind it's almost unequal it it it's packed full of Peace it's packed full of Tranquility it's packed full of a settled settled happiness and I would say regardless of circumstances in fact even in difficult circumstance and it's actually as as plain an ancient truth as you could ever want I would call it a Time tested Memorial of joy and satisfaction would you agree with that uh but it goes largely unappreciated You' think something so valuable would be front and center it's actually way down at the Bottom Rung of the ladder uh and some people have nothing to do with it whatsoever it's it's has no factor it's not a factor in their life at all they're content with nothing and uh it's it's it's almost as if nobody notices the beauty it holds it's almost as if it's hiding in plain sight intentional blindness which was a term I'd never heard or another term for it is Perpetual blindness occurs and this is straight from Wikipedia it occurs when an individual fails to perceive an unexpected stimulus in in plain sight purely as a result there's nothing wrong with their eyesight and that's very clear in the definition I I fared it out just the main parts of it but one of the things it kept emphasizing was not that somebody's got they're blind or they or they don't see very well they might have 2020 Vision but inattentional blindness or Perpetual blindness occurs when an individual fails to perceive an unexpected stimulus in plain sight purely as a result purely as a result of a lack of attention rather than any Vision defects or deficits when it becomes impossible to attend to all the stimuli in a given situation a temporary blindness a temporary effect of blindness can occur as your senses become overwhelmed and I've seen I've seen skits of that where you'll have a group and they're all doing something Everybody's In Motion a lot of times it's all choreographed and you're watching everybody's hands and feet and the chore choreography and somebody dressed in a gorilla suit just walks right behind them waves at the camera and walks on off and you never see it till they show it back again and say now look what you missed and they bring him out and freeze FR him you go how did I miss that a a big hairy gorilla walked right behind him and waved at me and I never saw him looked right at him it's because I was overwhelmed with all of the motion don't think the devil doesn't know how to run that and contentment is God is godliness real Godly contentment and I will assure you it's hiding in plain sight but the world is blind to it and and that's to be expected but what's not to be expected is God's family to be blind to it you agree contentment you try to say that into the world oh shouldn't we want to thrive yeah God's word doesn't call for us to live in mediocrity nothing in the word compelling you to to live like that on purpose uh Proverbs 6 6-11 Josh if you can catch up and get that one Proverbs 66 to1 go to the ant Solomon says go to the ant thou sluggard consider her ways and be wise which having no guide overseer or ruler provideth her meat in the summer and gathereth her food in the Harvest how long wilt thou sleep o sluggard when wil thou arise out of thy sleep yet a my brother Eddie Used To quote this all the time yet a little sleep a little Slumber a little folding of the hands remember that Mom little folding of the a little folding of the hands to sleep so shall thy poverty come as one that TR travaileth and thy want as an armed man so it doesn't matter how how um able you feel to defend yourself if you're a sluggard that poverty is going to take you like an armed man you're going to get mugged in the street and you're not going to be able to defend yourself against it and you're going to walk around in poverty so the Bible doesn't call for us to live in mediocrity there's nothing mediocre about the great champions of Faith you go read Paul's Faith chapter oh my goodness friends men women boys and girls and they they they lived in caves and dens and holes in the ground and they suffered persecution and and sometimes they they put to flight the armies of the enemies they swung a sword sometimes they didn't swing a sword sometimes they they suffered persecution and sometimes they wouldn't even accept Deliverance because they were content with the next Life coming I don't need to chase this one see so so thriving by all means but here are some things for you to think about here are some questions that you may want to ask yourself first question one how would you define or describe thriving what does that look like to you what what does that look like in your mind the world describes thriving hear me and you know it's true I'm not saying anything you don't know the world describes thriving way different than God does come on that's the first thing you need to take ownership of tonight God's definition of thriving and the world's definition of thriving are light years apart they're as far as the East is from the West so back to my question what does thriving look like to you how do you do you how do you interpret thriving is it the world's version you want be honest be honest not going to embarrass anybody put anybody on the spot not going to say let me see you show hands of all you Sinners that are chasing the world if I say anything like that I'll say something like how many of you love the Lord and then everybody can raise their hand how many of you love the Lord am good he loves you too but which which one is it that you're choosing if it's the world's vision of thriving then ask yourself this next question what are you willing to pay for it to what level are you willing to sacrifice those around you to achieve it even even the ones you love even to our families friends families get sacrificed all the time on the altar of pursuing fortune and fame Am I Wrong families get sacrificed all the time because somebody in the family or part of the family or all the family are trying to thrive by the standards of the world and it literally is burning lives down I say that unapologetically because I see it on the streets not only is it not you know when we talk about contentment not godly contentment not only is it you know uh or are are are are or I mean it's it's it's absent let's just be honest Godly contentment is looked at as failure yeah you're not striving you're not thriving God's family is striving more than you think they are and you're striving more than the devil wants to let you believe you are if you're still a believer in this hour in this impossibly dark hour I'm here to tell you you are striving and you are striving rather well see and so so we have people who are sacrificing families sacrificing friends sacrificing ing those who they say they love not only is it not uncommon in the modern day but I would even say it's flourishing and spreading unchecked in society if there's not somewhere a voice of God's family to say hold on what are you chasing brother bam used to say people fly down the road 90 miles an hour to go in a bar and drink for three hours he says what you heard where you going it's actually prophesied to be part of the poisonous Spirit of the last age did you know that parents without natural affection that's part of the prophecy of this age a father tells his son or his daughter hey you know I did all this for you guys I I I worked all those hours I got all this money I acquired all this success only to hear that child say back but Dad I didn't really want your money I wanted you I'm so glad I raised three humans and I never had to hear those words I can't tell you how grateful I am to God that I've never had to hear one of my sons say but Dad I didn't want all your hard work I wanted you oh I'm GNA tell you something friends the family of God is at a whole different level at least we're supposed to be amen we're supposed to be next level uh having Next Level Lifestyles and so you know I uh you know but but that's got to be painful you know to hear a child say I wanted you more than money or success and hey may I say not just parents living selfishly what about teens what about children the Bible says a prophecy in the last days that children will rise up to be their parents' Tormentor that's Bible prophecy man I'd hate to read that and go gee whiz that's me I'd rather read over here about somebody that love God and humbled his heart and say there I am oh Hallelujah somebody that was willing to say father forgive me so I you know it's it teens sometimes living in a home who want their way so bad that they'll set an entire family on edge just to get their way amen amen amen you parents better amen teens aren't going to you know sometimes I'm I'll just say it like this and and I honest to goodness have asked myself all day Lord why in the where is this sermon coming from who am I even going to be preaching to because I can't think of a case that I'm and and yet this is the Lord I know for sure woke me up early this morning and I've been studying it all day and I wasn't even scheduled to preach but our Lord already told me I would be and you know sometimes I have to say friends that when you get a situation like that where you get teens and children even down to small children I'm truly not sure which is more um astonishing to me you know um teens that'll live that selfishly or parents will let them I don't know which one is more astonishing parenting is certainly not for the faint of heart or the irresponsible and I haven't even mentioned to ask what you know what if your vision of thriving is contrary to God's word maybe I should just pause for five minutes and let you think about that what what if you're I mean I should have made I probably should have had this at the front of it and here I am at the end of it saying hey wait a minute hold on time out what if your vision of thriving young man young woman older man older woman married single young old doesn't matter what if your vision of thriving is is different than God's plan for you see and um what if it's contrary to God's word for our lives as his children and now and listen hey let me let me just say maybe not nothing bad or even sinful uh but but but what if your Pursuit just happens to be opposite of his plan and his goal for your life see say well but Pastor I I have a free will I love that one I have a free will I love me some people who have a free will to which I always just say sure you've got a free will guess what so does God where you think you got Free Will from you think God doesn't have free will who do you whose will you think should win yours or the creator of all the universe and The Giver of all life so you know I just think that him being the creator of all things and The Giver of life itself you know I I I think maybe we are to think about his will for our lives see now now you can relax you can breathe because I got a little bit of good news for you but it's a trick it's it's kind of like like Eugene come in there F in Odyssey and said hey guys I got some really good news and some news that pretty much cancels the good news I mean he not were laughing at that the other day because here here's the good news God tends to give you he he tends to give people the desire of their heart if they want it bad enough he's known for doing that even if you know if they insist on it hard enough and long enough he'll finally give them the desire of their heart even if it's only his permissive will the rub is and here's the news that pretty well cancels the good news the rub is that anyone in the Bible that I can find whoever got that and accepted God's permissive will um um they regretted that decision later on and sometimes it can take years manifest sometimes you don't notice it the wheels of judgment grind slow God is very patient very kind very loving very longsuffering giving he said I I I keep Mercy for thousands the Bible says his throne is established in Mercy that's one of the the fundament building materials of his throne Imagine a King that rules on a throne built out of mercy and his his Justice is all the time trying to redeem people and sometimes it can take years I've seen it Go many years decades even where it looks like they took God's permissive will and everything turned out hunky dory and everything's going to be fine and looks like we we escaped it mm- you didn't you didn't Escape it you see friends sometimes it doesn't show up for years but the laws of sewing and reaping work on autopilot it's not God following you around paying you back God's not vindictive like that he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't have to be like that that's beneath him to act like that but God put laws in nature that if you plant a seed in good ground it's going to grow a crop you don't have to ask it to and you can't talk it out of it oh I'm so glad that there's a rescue plan for that because friends come on let's look at all let's look each other in the eye and admit we've all sowed some bad seed and we've all prayed for a crop failure amen but I'm here to tell you the beauty of it is I mean God has a rescue plan for that I want you to know that tonight let me give you some hope God has a rescue plan that's where Esther faced that when she was there in a hazus and they had they had SED a seed that on this certain certain day everybody can get a weapon and kill all the Jews which was going to include Esther and you know how that got done by the trickery of the devil and how many times has the devil put us over a barrel by trickery and by Deceit by slight of hand and we thought it was God it wasn't God and we thought we had his permission we really didn't we went forward we seed the wrong seed or maybe we did it with our eyes wide open and we knew we were wrong we didn't care or we didn't think about the consequences and here's coming the crop and all we're doing is waiting on the date and I'm going to get slaughtered and when she says your majesty change your change your mind well he was the king he was in the position of like God God says I'm God I change not he said Esther I can't do that I'm a hazus I change not it's the laws of the mes and Persians I can't even I can't change my own thing that I said see but Esther here's what I'll do I'll make a new law and I'll write it over the top of the other law that instead of on the on the 29th when everybody gets to kill all of you you Jews here's a law on the 28th all the Jews can kill all their enemies so that when the 29th came the law was still in effect but the 28th had killed the effect of the law on the 29th if you've seed a crop full of Bad Seed start sewing good seed over the top of it just start sewing good seed over the top of it and it might come up but I'm here to tell you it can kill the effect of that thing oh I'm glad for a rescue plan tonight I'm glad he didn't just leave me in that kind of a situation Hallelujah see so understanding The crucial difference between the Doge eat dog survival of the fittest where the the the strong crush the weak and you know and and and and understanding this crucial difference between survival that the world has and and the profound the difference between that and I will dare say the profound potential for True flourishing true genuine thriving from God's view now that's unfortunate L you talking about something hiding in plain sight the truth of that is hiding in plain sight it's a great secret but yet it eludes most of humanity and it does so far easier than you might imagine and it'll elude you far easier than you might imagine I'm here to tell you something friends take it from an old veteran I fought the devil for for many years he's a master of Illusion young people hear me he's a master of Illusion he has led Untold billions to their Doom brother brandham says in the patmas vision what a horrible thing for a drifting Soul on the sea of life no pilot to guide him loose floating with the tides to hear the Roar of of the great cataracts of Falls and what a steep fall it often is what a horrible thing he says for a poor uh for a drifting a soul drifting what a horrible thing it would be to a soul drifting and he mentions the voice of many Waters and the voice of many Waters is the voice of the ministers who have cried out in every age it's the Judgment of God but but before the Judgment Falls he sends a good news before the Judgment Falls and guess what it's coming it's here it's falling but good news the voice of the ministers down Through the Ages crying out trying to get everybody out of the danger zone it's happening tonight it's happening in real time it's happening right now there's a preacher standing in the pull pit screaming waving his hands trying to get you to say come on there's a real contentment there's a chasing of of of Fortune and Glory there's a chasing and Solomon said it's a chasing of the wind it's Grievous and vexation of Soul even if you get it the the voice of ministers oh my I thought to myself today Lord let me be a let me be a different voice tonight than the voice they hear in leoa everywhere you go you in schools in Universities at McDonald's at Walmart driving up and down the streets everywhere you go uh you you can't even check your email without hearing the voice of Leo deia oh let me be a different voice tonight Hallelujah let me give you something new to think about my would you be willing to stop just a moment and hear a different voice for I want to tell you something tonight friends there is a true thriving there is a satisfying portion the Lord wants to give you and he wants to give it to you so very bad there third John brother Josh go John's third epistle that he wrote to the church third John chapter 1 and we will get that second verse beloved 1 John 1:2 beloved I wish above all things third third John did I say third John brother Josh thir John 1 Chapter 1 Verse two beloved I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health now here it is even as thy Soul Prosper amen so so he's not Santa Claus he's not just here to pour out you know blessings and pixie dust on you he's trying to make you healthy mind body and soul he's trying to make your home life happy your work life happy your married life happy your church house happy he's trying to make your relationships happy your love affairs happy this is what God is doing I would this is what I wish above not most things I wish above all things that thou mayest now he doesn't say you will but that you might he's giving you an opportunity it's on you it's up to you I wish above all things that thou mayest PR prosper and be in health don't ever doubt that God wants you in health right there it is don't ever doubt that he's got it in for you he wants you to prosper he wants you to be in health but he wants to tie it to the health of your soul tonight oh you ought to thank him for that he's not just trivial he's not just trying to be a pie in the sky this is something that's real something that can get a hold of your life and then it won't matter how many zeros are in your bank account or how what year model your car is or what or what the health is in your body or what kind of a hardship you're facing because your soul is prospering John is not preaching a health and wealth gospel it's not what John is doing it's not a it's not a one of these charismatic name it claim it gospels that's not scriptural Prosperity doesn't even always mean gaining riches see so John's not even talking talking about the the idea of wealth here but rather that the Lord promises to always make sufficient provision for the believer you know as a father raising a family I could say that I always wanted my children to be in health and prosper I get it I read this about a heavenly father and I go yeah makes sense to me because I was a dad am a dad but as a father father I also knew sometimes character is only gained by fighting through suffering and hardship Josh don't follow on this one because I'm going to read it from the NLT 2 Thessalonians 13-5 listen listen to me dear brothers and sisters we can't help but thank God for you because your faith is flourish and your love for one another notice how Daisy changed those together your faith is flourishing and your love for one another is growing you can see how those two go hand in hand when the love of God between them between the family of God is growing faith is flourishing you know why you know why that's true because you're looking beyond our each other's faults you're looking at you're saying well you know that's a that's a that's a problem in my brother but I got a problem too and how why you know I'll pray for you you pray for me and we'll all make it home we won't have that problem over there amen so he says because your faith is flourishing and your love for one another is growing verse four we proudly tell God's other churches about your endurance and faithfulness in all the persecutions and hardships you are suffering hold on what this is the F this is a family of God this a church of of Christ what do you mean they're having they're having hardships and sufferings Where's God what how are you letting this happen and Paul is saying Your Love is Growing your faith is flourishing I'm telling everybody about you guys because people think oh anybody can be happy when things are going good but you guys are suffering and your love is still growing you guys are in the middle of hardship but yet your faith is flourishing see in all persecutions and hardships you are suffering and God listen to this friends God will use this persecution to show his Justice and to make you worthy of his kingdom for which you are suffering you know as a father I I could teach perseverance and overcoming in God's word but I but I knew that the best teachers always experience and sometimes my kids uh they had bad ideas and uh they went in a direction that I knew wasn't the best one but you know as long as I knew that if worse come to worse I could recover them I could reach out and save them and fix it and pick them back up and clean them and pay the bill and and set them back up on their feet again I knew I could recover them and so sometimes you know when I knew things weren't going to turn out so good I'd even actually let them make a mistake just so that they could learn the lesson through experience I want to tell you something friends the pursuit of excellence in all we think and do that is a worthy goal I want to really I want to really put that to you so you don't think that this message is about oh I got to be poor and run down you don't I'm just simply saying have the right balance go after God's Prosperity go after God's Enlightenment go after God's word go after God's peace see because that'll be lasting that'll be enduring and and and and and I get it the pursuit of Excellence I'm I'm All About that I give no I offer No Quarter to any of my sons or grandsons who are who do not strive for excellence my girls none of them I don't allow that I tell them all the time you know papa is not GNA that's not going to work for me you ask any of them I I I want you to be excellent and if you fail that's okay as long as you're trying and as long as you'll just keep pressing and have some spunk and have some perseverance see and so the pursuit of excellence in all we think and all that we do that is a worthy goal but the problem is that the message that's drilled into US is is usually only one of two extremes I'm talking about leoa the message they drill into US is either there's only winners and losers and if you're not winning you're losing see so either you're winning or you're losing but I want to tell you tonight that a third reality is possible and it offers a much healthier Outlook and again again again not mediocrity in the middle that's not that's not what I'm talking that's not the third option mediocrity is not the third option we see from the scriptural text that we read in Philippians 4 that Paul discovered you know or or you know Paul discovered or or I would say as the King James uh version put it that he learned see he didn't just Discover it that almost sounds like he just walking along and found a treasure and stumbled over it no he learned this he had to go through something right that Paul learned that heartfelt contentment and gratitude should be thought of as a more genuine form of thriving not only a more genuine form of thriving but I would say a a a more valid form of thriving and and even Beyond genuine and even Beyond valid a more satisfying reality that what Paul learned is that there's a more satisfying form of thriving than the world is telling you about today there's a more valid form there's a more genuine form there's a more original form there's a more eternal form there's a more lasting form of thriving you can Thrive but who thriving are you following see and it's easier to accomplish than you might think that's why our verse Philippians 4:11 not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned and the whatsoever State I am there withth to be content the New Living Translation reads the 12th verse like this I know how to live on almost nothing or with everything and that's two different lessons because you have to learn how to live live with nothing and be content but you also have to learn how to live with everything and not let it ruin you I know how to live on almost nothing or with everything I have learned the secret it's hiding in plain sight I have learned the secret in every situation whether it is with a full stomach or an empty with plenty or with little verse 13 for I here's the secret he learned I can do everything through Christ who gives me strength who are we trusting you see Paul wasn't trusting the age he was trusting the Lord you know so if you're going to if you're going to cash cash in on the precious life that God has given you if you're going to cast your precious life in with those who have decided to take the broad way that leads to destruction here are some things you should know first before you begin Job 14 follow me on this one Josh job 141:5 job 14 1:5 I want to make this statement again if you're going to cast your precious life and you're going to cast it in with those who are on the Broadway that leads to destruction because they want everything now and they're not willing to trade this short little insignificant vapor trail of a life for all eternity see friends I wouldn't miss heaven for the world would you if you're going to do that if I have failed tonight to convince you that you should cast in with the Lord you should throw your light in with Jesus that you should let him teach you about real thriving real peace real contentment real satisfaction not a chasing of the wind but if I haven't convinced you here's some things you should think about first before you begin down that broad path job 141:5 man that is born of a woman is a of few days and full of trouble get as much money as you want have as many likes get get as many subscribers but man is born of a woman it's just a few days and it's full of trouble he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not and Dost thou open Thine Eyes Upon such a one and bringest me into judgment with thee who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean not one you can't get cleanness out of chasing this world young people you can't get cleanness out of chasing something filthy see verse five seeing his days are determined the number of his months are with thee thou Hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass James chapter 4 very familiar to us 13 to 15 go to now ye that say today or tomorrow we will go into such a City and continue there for a year and buy and sell and get gain whereas you know not what shall be on the tomorrow what is your life it is even a vapor that appear for a little time and then vanisheth away for that you ought to say if the Lord will we shall live and do this and that friends the masses trade that Eternal day coming for this fleeting day that's passing away forever they trade an eternal day for this fleeting day a few days and full of trouble that only leads to pain and misery and they trade that for all the and they take that and trade away all the eternities the question I remember many years ago right in this pull Pit Brother John short ministering and he said you have to decide do you want riches or you want Treasures you want the riches of this Dying World or do you want the treasures awaiting in the the eternals amen that's where Jesus said you lay up your Treasures Zachariah 3:7 watch this Zechariah 3:7 thus saith the Lord of hosts he's the Lord speaking now Zechariah 3:7 all right thus sayith the Lord of hosts if ye will walk in my ways and if thou wil keep my charge then Thou shalt also judge mine house and shalt also keep my courts and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by Count Me In Count Me In count I'll take that I'll take that I'll take curtain number one Hallelujah you can have this world Give Me Jesus you can have this world I'll take the next one hallelujah oh my Phil our text those that uh from Philippians 4 that 12th and 13 verse Josh you won't be able to follow me this is from the whis translation listen at it again we read it from the NLT we read it from the KJV listen to the whis translation I know in fact is what Paul said I know in fact how to discipline myself in lowly circumstances I know in fact how to conduct myself when I have more than enough look at that contrast I want to read that again I know in fact how to discipline myself in lowly circumstances and I know in fact how to conduct myself when I have more than enough so it doesn't ruin him see in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be satiated and to be hungry and to have more than enough and to lack I am strong for in all things in the one who constantly infuses strength in me I would say to you today today friends that you're going to want to allow the peace and the contentment that comes from doing right am you're going to want the peace and the contentment that comes from doing well you're going to want that to guide you I want to say to you tonight as we're getting ready to close seek that kind of threat amen I'm All For You thriving Paul John said I would wish above all things that you may be in health and prosper but even as your soul prosperous never despise the day of small things one of brother Dale's the whole Smith tribe one of their favorite things I've heard them say that this this has come out of their home so many times I've been sitting in the Smith home and I'll hear this little is much if God is in it I have that is I so adopted that so many years ago I'm here to tell you something friends that's a lesson Nehemiah and Ezra had to learn little as much don't despise the day of small things little as much if God is in it I'm going to tell you something friends in this fast paced world that's fueled by constant achievement and The NeverEnding Lust For more finding contentment in your personal growth finding contentment in your spiritual strength sometimes friends let's be honest that can feel like how do I even get that it can almost feel like a paradox I would like to feel that brother Jason I'd like to feel contentment in my spiritual strength I'd like to find contentment in my spiritual growth it just seems like a a paradox you know but but I'm here to tell you something friends if you can Master it like Paul did if you can Master the secret if you can Master the art of true cont repent and there's only one person who can teach it to you that's the Holy Spirit you can Master the art of contentment that's akin to discovering a secret path to happiness and well-being that will never run out that well will never run dry those breezes will never stop blowing oh it's not about stagnation or mediocrity you know I would just say to you tonight refine your journey did you know you're on a journey did you know that's what life is about you're headed somewhere life is a journey it's why God was so almost flabbergasted at Israel and they they had such such epic failures and God had helped them so much and they would and he would help them and he would bless them and they'd rise up and they'd love him and serve him and and it's almost like as soon as God turned his back then they' then they' get fat and lazy and and turn back to other gods who never done nothing for him but give them misery and sorrow and the only one that took care of him they constantly spat in his face and that astonished God it just astonished him that that they that they would actually he said he finally said to them in the Bible he said do you not even understand that you were just on a journey I was taking you somewhere you were in Egypt you were in your prisoners I brought you out I led you across the red see I slew all the enemies before you you crossed over took impossible citadels you didn't lose a man in battle I blessed your land I gave you houses you didn't build lands and Fields and Vineyards you didn't plant do you not even understand you were on a journey how did you let how did you let the prosperity that I gave you ruin you in that way am understand friends that contentment doesn't mean settling for Less it doesn't mean stressing over your future but what contentment means is valuing the present amen it's a great secret I would say to you tonight learn like Paul cultivate you know how to you cultivate a garden amen cultivate gratitude for small things there's a practical Little Nugget cultivate gratitude for small cultivate it learn to appreciate Little Things No matter how insignificant ific they may seem in the grand scheme of things as I said uh the Smith the Smith Mantra as little as much if God is in it see so finding balance in striving for more while being grateful for the now is so crucial if you don't get that point this whole sermon will be forgotten by you in a matter of days finding balance in striving for more while being grateful for the now let your end goal and form your thinking would you do it if your goal is eternal life is it if your goal is eternal life you need to be thinking about your maker and why he placed you here amen let's stand I did it a oneof hallelujah praise the Lord amen and come on team let's sing some songs we got a h pile of prayer requests that came in I sure want to thank everybody for um being studious about
