you're reaping out there on the streaming the labor of the brothers they've worked tirelessly to make sure that stream is working good we are certainly still aware that we still have more work to do so we continue to ask you to pray for us and to be patient amen as we're fixing a number of things on on all ends but we're working hard on it the brothers have worked tirelessly all day yesterday even some of them here after midnight last night so just keep them in prayer amen but Anthony I got a they were hitting the chat saying brother Anthony's singing like there's 500 people a man and brother Diggs and I were in the back we concurred Amen praise the Lord we're happy to have brother Diggs with us today and he was scheduled I was supposed to be in Phoenix cuz we had those meetings so we scheduled him to be in here to cover base for me and so we I talked to him several weeks ago we decided this to carry on he said he don't mind at all preaching to a few brothers here and preaching to the Internet audience so we want to invite brother Diggs to come onto the platform give us what the Lord has forced today how many enjoyed by the Jason's Sunday school class I thought I don't know maybe it's because it was cumulative but I thought part six was that was the best so far I've enjoyed every one of them it just keeps building and keeps building keeps getting gooder and gooder as we say I did I get astounded every time that brother Jason just goes right in and makes it so incontrovertible by the history by the verifiable history you you can't deny what the brother you can't sensibly deny what the brother is bringing out about how the whole misconception and the Trinity and everything became such a political movement today said about by men who weren't even Christians mind and history is is replete with evidence like that amen so I sure appreciate that a man with brother Jason we had to send him home right after his Sunday School class because we can't have more than ten in the in the sanctuary we want to obey that very very strictly and also social distancing brothers please remember for prudence for wisdom and - so that we can honestly say we are complying with the request of the federal government and CDC makes sure that we have no more than two brothers in the booth they're keeping distance apart we're not shaking hands are embracing we're fist and elbow bumping or even virtual bumping say man so we're trying to monitor that very closely appreciate all of you brothers being here to make the service possible let's sing some more that Ruth Andrews brother Diggs comes [Music] [Applause] [Music] right [Music] [Music] ha [Music] a man praise the Lord it's good to be in the house of God and to know that God is in control of everything in our lives as always we certainly appreciate pastor Jason and you know for allowing us to come having us and and we give on and thanks to Jesus Christ and we want to greet everyone again on the streaming or higher your getting the service but we pray that your heart is not settled with being away from church that we're praying and we're doing everything we can do to gather together again you know because the Bible says as we see these things approach that we want to fellowship the more so our heart should be longing to be in the presence of one another if you are okay with not coming to church you need to search yourself amen amen because you actually if we all got Jesus in to us why wouldn't you want to be around Jesus amen so we we appreciate God and again like bruh jason said you know you want to render to Caesar what is Caesar's but let's have a word of Prayer and we'll get right into the Word of God Lord Jesus father we know that these are perilous times Lord and many people are troubled and many things are taking place but Lord we know that we serve a God who's never taken by surprise we know that you're always on your throne and your all-seeing eye is always looking at your children and father we know that you've never lost one and you even leave the 99 to go get that one so father we put all our hope and trust in you for you our Jehovah Jireh and we know that you're still upon the mercy seat and your blood is still atoning for our lives Lord so father we pray that our minds are steadfast on the Lord that we concentrate on the will of God and the purpose of God in these times lower than we bind the spirit of fear in a very presence of fear that are trying to take our focus from what you are doing Lord to live in natural rim when we are supernatural beings Lord no we thank you we give you honor and glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you know I just feel sorry for one person and that's that's the no no I'm gonna brought my useless okay okay um by the grace of God you know I just feel sorry for one brother's cameraman he's not gonna get a break today so he's just gonna do what God call us to do a man we certainly enjoyed the worship amen you know I think God for brother Tony a man just coming out here and set the atmosphere right and all the musicians and everyone so let's turn to Luke the 14th chapter Luke 14 st. Luke 14 let's start reading at the start reading at verse 25 the Bible says and there where great multitudes with him and he turned and said unto them if any man come unto me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters yay and his own life also he cannot be my disciple my though that sounds kind of rough God is saying don't put nobody before me he says and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple for which of you intending to build a tower sitteth not down first and counted the cost whether he have sufficient to finish this happily after he have laid the foundation and it is not able to finish it all that behold it began to mock him oh my let's go to Romans chapter 8 Romans Chapter eight I'm gonna read a familiar verse out of here Romans eight and let's just reverse well that's God at verse 18 the Bible says Romans eight and 18 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which God shall the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God they made a lot of blessing to read of his word you didn't have your seats amen you know by the grace of God today I want to use for a subject the cost of being positionally placed or you can say the cost of being put in place but we wanna we wanna count what I want to do today I want to take the authority of covet 19 completely away and I want to take the focus of that completely away and what I want to establish today something that we should all be aware of is that God is in control amen if there's any sickness God has allowed if someone in your family is affected by the sickness God has allowed oh yeah but the question I want to expose what is God doing for us what do we see hey man where are you in this journey haruya of these of this troubling time and I want to say it if I can say it like this there is a cost to be paying haruya there is something that somebody has to answer for amen but I wouldn't when I say it like that there's a cost to be paid when we read a loop the 14th chapter Jesus is saying we're here he says you got to forsake your children you got to forsake your wife your husband oh your kinfolk to walk with me oh yeah now there is a cost to walk with God but how many of us are looking at earlier that cost of walking with God as being a blessing oh yeah because whatever you lose you get back a hundredfold if you stick with God earlier but to no tension when we look through the scriptures and we we run down that that the people of God heylia serving him it always cost him something oh yeah and we hear that brother Branham saying we're not high bad plants every wheel has to be sanded and all these things basically saying that it will cost you to serve God Georgia will go back into history in the church agents and you'll get the churches before us it cost them great things to walk with God and we are standing on their shoulders right now oh yeah and we should we should not be afraid to say Lord pretty girls are suffering because instant suffering that makes you follow into your adoption oh yeah this is the calling of the cows that puts you in prayer earlier and desperation oh yeah with a slow desperation with astral tribulation they're still suffering there's still Haggerty there's no pain earlier you have no reason to get closer to God so God allows things to happen just two jaws closed up clearly God allows things to happen hardly just so he can show up and show all of his greatness I oh yeah sighs I don't know about you earlier but in our church we've been experiencing some of the best services you might say we're brothers in this time of adversity in this time of trial you should yes you should be experiencing the goodness and greatness of God so I want to use for my mama my mama subject or inspiration my my subtitle refocus let's refocus for a minute earlier let's take our eyes off code 19 and let's look behind the scenes we know haruya through through a prophet of the hour that all these things are already prophesied even in the Bible that there be pestilence they'll be sickness they'll be famine hunger in the land so turn move be shaking holy we should be looking in the Bible looking at our surroundings oh it's time to get out of here let's refocus huh but what we're doing we're running back and forth I need hand sanitizer we're running back and forth I need this I need that now do what you got to do according to your faith but let me tell you something hey your pretty little sanitized in heaven and when the real tribulation come you ain't gonna give me so this persecution that we're experiencing the things that I have now I know some of you gonna say yeah brother we wanna be right well I say it like this let's refocus are you with me let's refocus for me now if if I were Jason if I was outside and I was working in the yard or playing with my dog or whatever first thing I would do when I come back here before I eat or my family or whatever I wash my hands cuz that's something we naturally feel ugly so if it's something you naturally do why is the government hire you pushing these things with fear cuz they wanna steal the focus highly and make something that's normal not normal we normally do this we normally wash our hands oh yeah before we eat before we do different things but you look earlier the enemy is always push in the narrative Harley and I let me let me get away from this because I don't wanna I don't wanna give it no more credit than what it deserves oh yeah as far as I'm concerned hariya just disease honey just sick this is no more than what has always been and that's a lie spirit it's never been any more do we not understand focus thousand seven hundred people estimated that's 1 million people here is the government talking about that this we focus there are over thirty eight huh Oh 38 million people sick every year over the flu is the government talking about that and we talk about how many people died from the flu every year it's the government talk about that so what is this all about it's about stealing your focus oh yeah taking your eyes of God earlier and you're missing earlier that the cost of this the cost of all these things that are taking place is really persistently placing people who a church it took a world a nation earlier the whole world to get in a back sitting condition a condition with God look there's eight hearts and sand that is no more than evil for God hurry to find grace in North it took the wickedness of the world for an ark to be born but Noah had to pay the costs Church their father of many days he wanted to just you know it's nice and sunny like this what he wanted to just go sit on the porch family and sit down but the cost to escape judgment he had to build that boat honey so he could always go ahead take his wife at the dealer because always who I did with his children go to the park he had to pay a cost her Lea just to be persistently placed whatever Church hallelujah don't lose focus you know what in times like this we ought to be enjoying it you say oh my brother you talk about look look at this I want to cover 94 miles per hour and I'm gonna keep saying it let's look at what God has given us the ability to do God is giving us the ability to stay home early spend time with your family don't worry about a job your jobs gonna be there oh yeah stay home spend time with your family spend time with your wife honey hey man you now brothers you get the opportunity to sit down with your children and pick their brains you probably couldn't do that huh a couple months ago when you were so busy on the job but God has allowed us to enter into his rest but always looking at it oh am I gonna have a job after this when God is giving you a time harder to interact with something that means way more than a job you can sit down you know and you know uh uh I'm uh I'm not good at this but I know my daughter pilot watching listen and you know my kids and uh uh uh uh my baby girl she likes just take top stuff you know going around doing all the stuffing called us so when she ain't ready I get the camera huh and I make a video she ain't ready for honey but what does that do I couldn't do that earlier months ago when I was so busy her God's given me holy by His grace he's giving me special time with my children hallelujah just to come on a level and reconnect let's look at the calls church holy and you know we're having some of the some of the best times you know riding the biking going to play ball and all these things we're connecting and people are worried about germs when the real germ is coming forth the germ of life that's what we ought to be paying attention you pay attention sit your family down you better sit down go take a walk with them fathers sit down with your boys I still watch their future plans let's refocus this is not for us as Christians this is not about Korea or co19 we've always had diseases on the arts God is trying to show us something let's refocus let's take that time earlier and bring forth life because when every cost is supposed to bring forth life oh yeah you take her what does a bear do honey a bear goes into a hibernation what does salmon do they go back to their birthplace struggle preach love life but look at the cost you get the cost of a salmon to go back to his birthplace he has to go upstream church and as it's diving as it's going it's coming down the rocks it's so hurt and so damaged by producing that birth going back to his birthplace it ruses his life to give life so look at the cost look at the cost of that mother salmon honey that's giving birth hallelujah to reform or salmon what is the cost it's a life for life and I'm not being insensitive about people that lose their life he said in the Bible he says look you don't think God has already counted the cost he knows whose families are gonna be affected you don't think God has already carried the cost for those of you brothers and sisters who's worried about losing your jobs you don't think God when this is over already got another job waiting on you oh my brother Jason said this morning are we believers or not I don't know about you but in these times I've been seeing earlier my god come on the scene he steals Jehovah Jireh holier he's still Joe Marasco he's still a banner he's still a sail he's still a shepherd let's count the cost if I can I don't want y'all know me I'm about to close oh yeah but if I can let's look at a church you know let's look in the scriptures in look at what it cost no one to build that boat 420s huh he probably didn't have the to do is that he wanted to sit down with his family why because the burden hallelujah to build that boat was something greater didn't he put there he didn't put that burden there God did you know he he probably lost precious moments oh yeah but what was more important fulfilling the thoughts of God do you do we understand honey that Ark came out of the minds of God and as long as Noah was building that boat oh yeah what he was doing shouldn't affected him in a negative way because he was right in the will of God so sometimes we look at the things that we buy the seeds that we are going to gain but you can't measure the grace of God like that because the things you gonna change might not be in the will of God for you so as long as Noah's building that boy boy boy I say come on dad let's go shoot some ball he's that caked hunger the pitch is getting cold let's keep going but what it cost Noah and in his old family in that moment you think about his neighbors huh I know some of us got neighbors who are watching us I was talking to my buddy I'm sorry my Crosby honey god bless him and sister Flo they in London right now and you know their laws are a little bit stronger than ours they can't even walk the streets can't even out say it was trying to do the live streaming and he he finished upon to do live streaming and they open the door what are you doing what are you going you're not supposed to go the threat of the neighbors calling the law on him does that sound like religious persecution to you see touch let's refocus someplace somewhere the Bible is being fulfilled but we look like we're we're in America we're not experiencing the squeeze when somebody else can be experiencing the squeeze some places they can't tote day Bibles some places they can't even go to church and it isn't a kakoen virus to do that let's refocus but what is it sometimes things happen just so God can put you in position Berner God and it might be something that you can't explain it might be something you lost dear to your heart it might be a child going in the world it might be a wife it might be a husband but all it is God put you in position remember remember Jacob Jacob's wife couldn't have any children holy you know he probably really wanted her to have children because we feel like I pop up my papa right how many want ba ba ba I believe she bought that fall huh well Rachel huh Rachel Rebecca wanted to she could have anything you know but look at the cost look at what it costs her so that Jacob might get in position she had to share her husband oh yeah with women she probably would have never done if she could have children can you imagine it but that was God putting Jacob in position and sometimes you'll be a part of something and you'd be hurt by what going on and it's God put you in position not able to have children but she's like my sister outdo me but are you brother to just give you a wife to your brother cuz you're not able to have kids think about the cost think about her emotional state oh yeah and what it felt like you want to know what it felt like let's go back to Sarah and Hagar Sarah her Leah she paid a cost for wanting the Word of God to be fulfilled huh but she didn't even realize because she had the enemy take a off of the streets of God so she got her own self and she said you know what I'm gonna make this happen she said you know what I'm gonna give you Hagar and we're gonna bring four children like that and didn't once it happened her real feelings the cost of how she felt he came out but was it it was God putting Abraham in position so sometimes at your expense at my expense at the pastor's expense somebody behind the scenes is being blessed somebody's being blessed by the cost you might be paid you look it had to go down like that because it was gonna be a type from Abraham to run out through history that there would be two seasons i oh yeah there'd be a spiritual serum natural seed oh yeah and they'd be warring against each other but think about what it cost era to let it happen look look now you have Rachel you have Leah you have the two hands means and it looked like it's four women fighting over one man but let me ask some who you think felt the most hurt out of that whole thing I guarantee you one Jacob you see Rachel hallelujah because it wasn't it wasn't Rachel idea that Leah kills huh me leah was a wife now Rachel couldn't stop that huh so here comes Leo huh Rachel keeps humming hallelujah she has children so real say you know what you ain't gonna outdo me earlier I'm gonna give my honey now everybody's having children but Rachel look at what it costs her so that a husband may get in position but all of that was the plan of God God allows suffering so that someone may be blessed Church I'm speaking from experience and aggression the grace of God honey you know what my whole my whole thing is now church I want to be built in such a way so that the words of Paul when he says hooyah he joy count it all joy in the thing she saw earlier that day he says if he glory in anything let it be in the things he suffered he look at he is rejoicing in what it cost him huh Paul was a man no doubt hariya could've had children couldn't have a wife but he forsook all for the gospel can you imagine Paul going out to witness and Families coming up to him tell him Paul we appreciate your ministry the children of the Brotherhood you probably look at some of those kids and had these old feelings and probably said I wish I had a family but that was his cost for the gospel buddies what are you saying I'm saying in moments like these let's not be fear for us and it's just God God is the great harlot God is the greatest chess player ever oh yeah and let's let's understand this one thing honey it's the devil on one side and gods on the other side you know his chips are all his horses are white huh well I want you to understand his God on his side Satan on his side God is never playing defense he's never playing defense because he's the author and creator of life every position and you achieve God already nobody it's the devil playing defense because it's the enemy tried to stop God's plan and like I say like this the enemy is a part of God's plan his whole life doesn't belong to him Church let's look at the cost a little bit more not not now we step up earlier and we look at oh yeah let's just say uh-uh we look in the scriptures and we look at the children and let's let's back up to Jacob and Esau and you'll get Isaac twice earlier oh yeah you look at her and Isaac begin to pray Lord let my wife have some kids she's not she's not she don't feel complete let my wife has never better please Lord then I have some kids so you know what because of his prayer Rebecca gets pregnant honey honey but go back and read it her pregnancy is not a normal pregnancy she starts to question God why do I feel like this what's going on inside of me and God comes back and tell her there's a war going on inside of you honey your husband acts that you get pregnant but he didn't know the cost he didn't know there were gonna be two nations inside of you and they were gonna fight in the womb to the time therefore they didn't understand the cost honey but even after they're born honey Jacob comes out grab he loved he saw somebody had to pay the price but look huh if we if we go all the way into the life of Jacob Padilla and God positionally placed him little church what did it cost take him to get your birthright you might say well he he you know he has a paper right birth right here favor with God let's let's drop down to the just to the human real church do you know holy following God and having and getting that birthright it cost him his family how many y'all got siblings that you love and you grew up with and you became tight Jacob didn't get that chance Esau became his enemy his blood brother whom he probably loved he became enemies why for the cost of being positionally price and you'll understand he saw you understand oh yeah it even got by isaac the cost of tricking his dad the cost of tricking his brother earlier cost him his family cost him his childhood he had to grow up fast church so don't give me that I don't know what I'm gonna do to my heart my job is my job you don't know what God is about to do in your life maybe he's putting you in position huh no Church hey you know me and my brothers we grew up together earlier and by the grace of God I'm the youngest of four so it didn't cost me any of those relationships when I came into the ministry because they were already older than me huh oh yeah but can you imagine if we twins huh if we twist you door and say some twins can finish each other's sentences let's just say that I was Jacob and Esau and now God is positionally placing her these two boys he's gonna let East I'll go out this day and not be able to finally food and Jekyll's in the kitchen Harley cooking up something and now he's being motivated huh he'd been motivated by any so suffering but it was gone but look at what it cost him it cost him the fellowship with his family it cost him a real brother just to get in position but was it God so let me listen to like I say I want a strip covert like G from all this power now the question would easy access out selves is do we see God in the midst of this ain't worried about what Trump saying I ain't worried about what seeing in saying I'm worried about what God is trying to get out of me just I don't know about you but it's it's causing me to search myself oh yeah because we as the bride are supposed to be higher yeah the manifestation of God hurry up a city set on a hill for this in time evangelism what are we doing ain't saying be rebellious I'm not saying go do the complete opposite of what the world is doing no what I'm saying is refocus refocus Oh Church I give you I give you know only count the cost remember remember Abraham's seed it was put into bondage a man put into bondage over 400 years but somebody has to pay the price for their deliverance there was a couple people that paid the price huh for one honey Josephine holy Moses mom and daddy they had to pay the price why because Pharaoh sit down Cody could decree that every young child from to another must die male and they got this fine handsome two-year-old precious Hebrew with something special oh it's like the momma saw that at birth but she don't know what it is yet so can you imagine the cost what it costs her to give up her child who she'd already saw something supernatural over his life Oh God already she gave us something supernatural her experience with her child and she had to give him up not knowing what his future holds and so were some of us we had to give up loved ones we have to give up children and different things so that they could go the path that God already planned for them and it made her Leah it may look like instruction to us it may look wrong to us but all it's doing we know what it could be doing putting you in position they could be putting you in position Joseph and they had to give up their child sitting on a river and they don't know what's going to come of him and now you look who else had to pay a price Miriam had to pay a price honey she couldn't just be just a little innocent little girl she had to go be a spy can you imagine her free is like they're planning they having a good time they play pattycake no baby baby no no no can you imagine all her friends doing it and she and my uncle's hey I need you go follow Moses go follow him down the river and she has to get in the river earlier or on the sides of the River or whatever on the banks of the river and forget about her childhood it'd be a spot for Mama huh and not only that church she hung had to be willing to go into enemy territory Oh a little young girl the cost just to please her parents and you might not want to believe this but some of your children are doing things just to please you and you don't understand what it's costing them estas mother pastor says the preacher sailors why don't you take this time sit down with them and see what they really cuz I had one of my kids hallelujah tell me how some years ago they were doing a certain thing and I said why are you doing that and they said well cuz I don't want to disrespect you and I'm like I appreciate that I appreciate you not wanting to disrespect me but were you doing is God looking at you forget about me and just that conversation alone allowing them to have their own conviction when it comes to God even though I know what they doing is wrong it made our relationship even that much better cuz sometimes that's parents let's stop trying to play God and let's just be parent huh this would be prayer let's stop being God let God be God you Delta G 1 of my consolation is if you God did this are you with me with my oldest Harley he said hey you dedicated her to me not take your hands off and God is God is faithful God is good at church I'm looking I'm looking back on it now and like I said honey I've learned to appreciate to shut your mouth ministry how best ministry ever came in contact with its decision my ministry some of us need to prank that ministry at home hold the job and especially in church shadow mouth if you don't know what's going on cuz you look at something you can say this happening that happens but you don't know what is costing that person just to go through it just to bear with it just to come to church and let you look at him with you downgrading eyes and I ain't above know about this but you know what some of the nasties people can be church people so the most uncompassionate people can be church people especially in this message because with knowing truth there is an element of pride that comes along and you need the Holy Ghost to contain it cuz y'all know we didn't heard somebody preaching something and he don't know what he talking about you know what that is do you know what that is that's right but it takes the Holy Ghost holy for you to see without God you'd be in that same position so church I try not to judge what's going on in somebody else's house whether they message believe it or not God is in control honey and well it looks like something like oh my I can't believe he did this oh my I can't believe she did that best minister in the world is the sex on my ministry especially you preaches let me lead hello let's look at the cost look at what it costs honey I take them just to get the birthright to keep the Holy Ghost it costs him his fellowship with his twin it cost him hooyah being fully tulitt by his daddy church he didn't have the chance to be adopted under his father's ministry do you realize that you need to receive his adoption under his father's ministry he received it at Pannell all alone here we go he had to wrestle for it he had to wrestle for that adoption huh think about if he would have been home earlier as he had people already set up for his boys to teach them and show them right from wrong huh that say was coming to that adoption but he had to leave his family running from his life look at the cost you know the devil the devil is and I look a little fight but I want to say this the devil is so dumb he's so dumb Church he he allowed this teacher going to the masses and he's taking over the world you know what it's doing huh he's making a bride pull for more of God it's making the anointing in our churches more pure honey because I guarantee you the people that are streaming the people that are coming are the people that really want to so it's making it more let's refocus hey hey if you sit at home and you think about going count alone don't blame it on me it's a universal pool hallelujah it's a pool in the fourth dimension one of my buddies takes me before service say he's gonna be watching he's in Louisiana and I guarantee he pulling I can feel it bro oh wow let's refocus God is placing us oh you look at Jacob all the stuff he gave up Church you know I love these I love when God give me stuff like this progestin because it's like brothers Jews saying it takes away my wives and wives he will it takes away my complaining it takes away my feeling sorry for myself it takes away all the channel everybody else is saying about me just to know that God is in control of my life Church looking sometimes God is trying to place you and you will do things that you couldn't imagine you doing but God allowing just to get you in position just to get you position church you couldn't tell me honey Moses got to desire hallelujah now he's looking at one as people being being beat up in all the stuff and he has a desire to see hurry the Hebrews go free but look at what it cost him because he would've been pop somebody's neck he didn't visit himself doing it but God allowed him to get in that position earlier why because he had to go in the desert where Jethro's that and the only place he could get there is if he has a reputation of a murderer look at what it costs him to build an era before he was literal he had the testimony of a murderer but why was he grabbed he grabbed Egyptian pull some is something pop-pop and word gets out Moses didn't kill somebody who was once the Great Prince now he's a murderer he was next in line to be on the throne now he's a murderer now he has to run from his life run for his life what was it that was God's plan y-you said birdies how was that God playing because before the foundation of the world God had a bush on the backside of desert that he had already tested they could he could speak out of it he had a bush already in place all he needed was Moses to be in position oh yeah okay what it cost him because Moses Moses being delivered it costs him hallelujah it's real identity he grew up on the lie lie with me church he grew up huh nothing I want a woman as his mother who really wasn't his mother huh he grew up not knowing his father like a son would he grew up not knowing his natural siblings that's what it costs him to be put in position what do you think God is doing Church I'm rejoicing because what gives me strength brother Jason is death you can go through things that it seemed like it would break you apart and strength comes from somewhere to keep serving him another day huh the average person with a bit of quit and made every excuse to go live some old crazy kind of life but God has put stabilizing power inside of you that is a mist of every suffering every trial used to remain strong listen hey bud all right I know I need I need to wrap this up Holly if y'all don't mind let me read something the church Facebook listen this is a message this morning turkeys listen he says now the Lord God Almighty since I know just we are to live by that God is already saying I know nothing is catching him by surprise I know in 2020 hallelujah April of 2020 God still remains to say I know will you need a job God says I know you need food of your house I know the Holy Ghost I know using your body I know whatever it is God is already proclaim over two thousand years ago that he is hung up Nishat he says I know that there he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he steam the trip to the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation I am NOT holy at all holy unmindful of your suffering what is holy he says I'm not at all unmindful of your suffering these are prophecies what a stumbling block hallelujah keep this so many people he says suffering is a stumbling block to the believer because we think we supposed to go to nothing let's narrow it down to Abraham go through something amen hey Rebecca anyway he says what a stumbling-block Holly this is to so many people he said like Israel they wasn't if God really loves them how can God be just as loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer you know why cuz he's put you in position God allows it because he knows that suffering is going to put you in position G that is what they ask in Malachi 1 1 & 3 he says the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you said the Lord yet we say wearing has now left us was not Esau Jacob's brother said the Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and ladies Mountains and his heritage waste to the dragons of the wilderness you see is that you see they could not figure how God's love see Church how does God shows his love by just as much by agony by pain the prophet of God say you wanna love you worthy he said it's when God sees you through a trial anybody going through something we ought to be giving our praise listen he says I thought that love meant no suffering they thought they loved made a baby with parental care but God says that his love was effective elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven highly truly by the fact they were chosen unto salvation because God have chosen you hurry to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit hungry belief of truth now listen he says he may commit you to death as he did all that was God's love oh and did he not put Paul in position to suffering so he's suffering I want you to catch this what the enemy thought he was getting on God was really God putting a weapon in Paul's hand he says he may commit you to suffering as he did told Jobe loved his children always always always he says this is his way people looked at him is his status he lost his family he lost his wife he lost everything but was not God with him in the thing about Joe what we have to realize is sometimes God will never tell you why you went through what you went through he never came back to job as a job you know what this happened because the devil tested me he just restored him with that whole part of his life just being a question mom but really it was asset because God came back and begin to replenish so Joe should've knew the question mark was God was in control huh he said that is his prerogative he is sovereign but it holier he said but it is with a purpose purpose like Esther's church he said if he did not have a purpose seeing he would be the author of frustrations and not a peace so if you going through something and it's aggravating is trying trust me God has to have a purpose because if he didn't have a purpose the public I say he'd be the author frustration and not of peace and the Bible says that he's not that all he's not no other frustration he says his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we will be made perfect holier be established strengthening settled as Joel said he pushed treating us so what is this all about God positions us so that we may walk before him perfect remember he told Abraham before he went to eat easy walk before me and be thou perfect hull so like being there was God's perfection holy him goes out there fighting the three kings was God's perfection holy king I almost taken his wife was God's perfection every child he was walking before God and be made perfect Jace rotates forgive me they got a whole world song when I was coming I used to say you made me feel like this feel like dancing that's what the Word of God does for me church I hope you catching it wholly refocus we all like to be things me whirring hold on we can't go out I can't go to wall my like I won't do it I can't do it I can't go to work if I had a full-time job and they told me stay home you still keep your child and we gonna pay you you think I'll be worried I'll be there praise God you know what I said when I heard top saying we will sit on some kings as they thanked God for Trump first time those words I became my mama so I take that real quick thank God for that man no he don't I couldn't read all this brother I'm here the clothes he says the purpose is after a while your stuff in a while then he will make you perfect be established strengthen itself as he did Joe listen y'all go back and read that cuz that's a powerful from 17 to 18 that's powerful that whole thing in there but I want to get to this and I'm a close by God's grace church let's realize this for us to be here soundly still living you know there's people all over the world have turned their back on this truth what is it that's keeping us because we have to go through the persecution they call us a cult they call us just a car that you know and we have to go through that persecute they got us online all this other stuff and as soon as somebody who was in your church something happens it's blast out all over the place then go tell the good that's going on then go tell her brother Jason supports the ministry or or when somebody's sick in church and he calls him or visits him they go tell that harder go tell us someone so they left his church but all this doing is putting him in position for perfection honey but listen for us hariya to be recipients of this in time revelation it cost somebody something and if I can close like this there's a manhunt that it costs him greatly to bring forth this revelation it costs to profit greatly oh yeah if I can't when God gave him the inspiration to go to the Pentecost Pentecostal church honey there were two people that he loved standing in his way his mother-in-law and his wife what did it cost him let me read this week listen Church now he was the ex for his hand the hands of his wife and foot two he had to go to us his father-in-law him in the mother-in-law and Majid he had to tell them that we were feeling leaves us Baptists assembly we believe this that we go in the Pentecostal church and the mama the mama wasn't trying to hear mom was like huh huh no you ain't taking my daughter listen what she says she says look she said well he says he says well I went and had to tell her mother and that didn't work so good she said William she said she's your wife you may take her if you want to but I don't want my daughter drug among that bunch of trash this is his wife mother-in-law somebody he respected somebody he knew his wife loved and respected and now her Lea he he has a word from God to go down a word from God to go down to the Pentecostals but now he's caught in the emotional realm listen to God or listen to my love it cost him I'm gonna just paraphrasing you know the story he says what the mother-in-law saw to be trashed was really the cream of the crop he say hope she went but she really didn't want to go oh he didn't go quite dear right there and he was stuck in between going and his wife and loving her and everything and then he goes on down you read he says she didn't live much longer after that once he was gone so he was being sweet earlier off the path of perfection he took all those things out of his life that was hinder that process he took hope hurry the daughter haruya just to get him in position look at what it cost him after that his daddy died brother died seven people died because all the people that had great influence on his life God had to move my way so it cost there's a cost earlier to be position replaced but what I'm trying to say is what's our attitude in my closing in my closing catch this real good what's your attitude towards God while he's making you perfect he's making you perfect you complain he knows he knows God is in control don't let us never think that the enemy has one up on us listen you can't what it costs rehab oh yeah to build that house hold it on the wall with the reputation of a harlot look at what it costs her reputation Rahab the harlot Rahab the harlot with a burning desire in her heart not to want that testimony but she had to live through it nobody knows the Bible say how long she lived in that condition with wanting to be safe let's just put yourself in her shoes now I don't know about you but I wanted to be saved and feel the Holy Ghost long before it happened so I went through a lot of stuff oh yeah just so God could get me there can you imagine she walking through the streets in there by looking at Harley and you know heart she want to be a Christian cleaning women looking at look at you ain't no you just so filthy and in her heart she believed in God look at what it cost to bring forth Abu ass Wow Chloe Church let's refocus I don't know about you but I believe he's right here where we are God is priming us to perfection and I don't want to get caught up so worried about what the government gonna do it covert 19 in all that church this ain't no different from aids no when it came to was an epidemic it was sweeping the world and listen and I nobody even talked about could it be then it's happening all over again let's refocus and let's give God his glory in the midst of all this cuz remember he said all these things gotta happen before he come so what he's doing he's showing us that he's on his way hey man let's pray so Jesus father we thank you for your word Lord we pray there was something said to help your people Lord Lord and we shall bless your name Lord to be the few that are called and chosen by the grace and mercy and blood of Jesus Christ and all God we pray that we will just refocus on

take up your cross and follow sing again take up your cross take apology [Music] take out your car each and every day is that your purpose [Music] say that you take of your cross [Music] wow I'm in one of those positions where I want to say no words I have no words but yet I have a thousand words I want to say my goodness I'm just looking back over everything the brother said and my notes as he went along I just feel like I need to go somewhere in the world and preach that sermon amen you know you know something brother Diggs when you that last point you made there what is our attitude towards God while he's making you perfect you know I was thinking about where you was talking about there in Genesis 17 where he had said to Abraham walk before me and be thou perfect I went and grabbed it and pasted it into my notes when Abraham was ninety years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the Almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect now he's only Abram here he's not even had the H added to be Abraham that's going to come because H means deity God's gonna add deity into his name and bring him to something but that was never gonna happen unless Abraham agreed to this covenant right here and the Bible says in verse three Abram fell on his face he humbled himself to that but what struck me is that Abraham fell on his face and he humbled himself and he had no idea what all he would have to face and endure to be all that God already said he made him for me God said in the fifth verse he says you know neither shall thy name be any more Abram because now he's humbled himself he said but you should be called Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee God had already made him I already had all of that everything out there in front of him Abraham didn't have a clue he didn't have a clue what that meant to be perfected because remember what brother Diggs read out there judge book that you're perfected through your sufferings and so God just comes down and says here's his promise I'll multiply the exam for him amen my covenant is with thee amen you should to be a father of many nations and here Abraham is agreeing and humbly and he and walk before me and be thou perfect and Abraham's might be thinking well I'll try to be good no it was going to be way more than that and wasn't gonna be about being a good boy are you gonna walk before me Abraham I'm prophesying to you I'm not really asking you a question Abraham I already made you a father of many nations I already done this the backside of this already finished amen I just need you to cooperate in the vision Abraham a vision and go ahead and and admit it and fall on your face and humbler now I'm going to add H to your name I'm gonna put DeeDee inside you and I'm gonna make you everything that I already determined you're gonna beat Wow Wow you know some friends man I feel like preaching Wow brother Diggs oh my goodness I'm gonna tell you something friends now this is a straight-up fact there's the straight truth there's no way a man can preach something like that who ain't had to walk some path of hardship and trials that brother Diggs has went through I was telling some ministers the other day but they come up conversation I said brother Diggs ain't even same man since all these trolleys been through ain't even the same ministry he still brother Diggs he's still gonna be up he gonna be a nervous breakdown for the devil and brother Diggs is still gonna walk the aisles and still gonna sniff out but I'm gonna tell you brother Diggs has hit a whole new level because of the suffering now I guarantee if you'd asked him years ago you willing to go through this brother digs mite had to say hold on now what what all is this I wanted to face but I'm gonna tell you because the brother stood faithful and has come out the other side of all of that trials faithfully he can stand here today I'm gonna tell you you can take this sermon and go home with it because the man that was preaching it wasn't preaching something just off of theology man was preaching something he's lived and he's seen God keep his word amen how many witnessed that Amen we've been hearing brother Diggs you know even before and then during and then after and just praying for him all the way along you don't go through something like that and come out you know it without in victory without going through some things and then when you do and you endure and you keep going and you come out I'm gonna tell you you become something altogether brand new you become a tool in the hands of God amen so I I appreciate brother Diggs well done amazing Wow we are you willing today to be like Sarah and to be like Rachel that they had to be willing to go through amazingly terrible things in order for their husband to become everything the word for Abraham and Jacob to become everything the word had said about them those wives had to go through it now you're the Bride of Christ are we willing to endure suffering to allow our husband the word Christ to be seated on the throne to be up there and the Bible says he's going to be king of kings and Lord of lords are you willing to put him there are you willing to make the way in your life so that your husband the word Christ says he says he the kingdoms over there of our Lord have become the kingdoms of our Lord and His Christ the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ that's Jesus and his bride amen how many say I'm all-in how many do they say I'm only and now you know be careful you like Abraham you don't know what what's tomorrow houghton but how many still gonna put that hand on say I'm in I'm all-in Amen praise the name Lord listening some more brother Anthony amen praise the Lord Jesus Jesus Jesus [Music] that may be breezy singing I'm so glad oh Jesus set me free sing glory hallelujah Jesus set me free will hold my way to heaven shout victory o my way to ever victory [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] she set me free [Music] she's escaped me [Music] Jesus [Music] [Music]
