[31:01] how to speak again without a uh an
[31:04] interpreter standing next to me you get
[31:06] so used to that flow that your brain
[31:09] starts slowing down a little bit and uh
[31:12] so we just pray the Lord helps to speed
[31:15] my brain up
[31:18] again are you downloading the
[31:23] PowerPoint problems okay well all I have
[31:25] is a PowerPoint tonight to show you you
[31:28] so that is a real
[31:32] problem but it was
[31:34] a a wonderful trip to Egypt the Lord
[31:39] really moved in a amazing way I I I know
[31:41] it's going to take a little bit because
[31:43] it's a lot of pictures and videos in
[31:46] that but I'll kind of get started with
[31:48] the initial portion um I traveled from
[31:52] January 27th to the February 10th thank
[31:56] you brother Tony brother Alex mulus
[31:59] traveled with me it's wonderful to have
[32:01] someone with me I'm so used to traveling
[32:03] by myself
[32:05] that the blessing of having someone that
[32:08] can communicate in your culture and
[32:10] language when you're in the Middle East
[32:12] is
[32:14] Untold um because you go many times two
[32:17] weeks three weeks and they really can't
[32:20] fully understand you and you really
[32:22] fully can't understand them though the
[32:25] though you can speak English to some of
[32:26] them it's just a it's a difficult thing
[32:28] so it was really uh strengthening for me
[32:32] to have brother Alex with and of course
[32:33] he preached a lot as well and the Lord
[32:36] used him in a mighty way we had 13
[32:39] services in total during our time there
[32:42] several days where there was multiple
[32:44] services and we were in uh the Cairo
[32:47] metro area and also in uh Upper Egypt
[32:52] which I've got some if if we ever get it
[32:55] up I have some uh pictures that I can
[32:58] show on the map there our program that
[33:01] we've done the last two times in Egypt
[33:05] is we've really prayed and sought the
[33:07] Lord with this open door and really what
[33:09] we do is we preach the word just in
[33:12] Simplicity to the people they're very
[33:15] very simple uh humble people and so just
[33:20] in a very simple basic way bringing the
[33:22] word to them and then we follow the
[33:25] scripture we lay hands upon the sick
[33:28] and watch what God does for them and
[33:32] also give out a uh printed booklet uh of
[33:37] brother BR one of brother bram's sermons
[33:39] that's been translated into Arabic so
[33:41] that's really our program for every
[33:44] every church that we go to and um it's
[33:48] been the Lord's been moving through that
[33:51] uh the last time I was there it was
[33:52] about a year ago and I could see the
[33:55] results um from the ministers that we
[33:58] interacted with and and spoke to and
[34:01] there's a
[34:02] real critical thing going on there now
[34:05] um we had services at two Baptist
[34:08] Churches two Assemblies of God churches
[34:10] and then nine Pentecostal churches and
[34:14] uh I'll just say it's really refreshing
[34:17] to preach the message to people that
[34:19] have never heard it before because I
[34:21] think sometimes we get uh Stuck In The
[34:24] Weeds too often when we're preaching the
[34:27] message here and this one's got a quote
[34:29] to throw this way and this one's got a
[34:30] quote to throw that way but when you're
[34:32] preaching to people that they don't want
[34:34] a quote cuz they don't believe in the
[34:36] quote they want the scripture so you
[34:38] show them the scripture and it's amazing
[34:41] the reality of the message amen that
[34:44] goes along with it um when you bring the
[34:46] scripture to them and you know the Lord
[34:49] Has Done miracles in people's lives uh
[34:53] both both trips that we've done just
[34:55] taking the Simplicity of the word there
[34:57] the Pentecostal Church the difference
[34:59] between the Pentecostal church and the
[35:00] Assemblies of God church is the
[35:01] Pentecostal Church separated from
[35:03] Assemblies of God and be over the fact
[35:06] that they didn't believe that tongues is
[35:07] the initial evidence of receiving the
[35:10] Holy Ghost so it's they've started along
[35:12] the process already of on their own of
[35:15] receiving the message so it's just a I
[35:17] think it's a a natural process the Lord
[35:20] is leading them on we gave up out over
[35:23] 1500 books uh we laid hands uh upon over
[35:28] a thousand people and I'm still in the
[35:31] process of gathering testimonies but
[35:35] um uh one of the brothers that we
[35:38] visited and preach for his church last
[35:40] uh March um he he arranged and took us
[35:44] to a Baptist Church that he was in
[35:46] communication with the pastor with in
[35:49] aute and it was uh we pre I when I went
[35:53] there I was on my heart to preach what
[35:55] is the name and so I brought out water
[35:57] baptism just in a very simple way and
[36:00] the whole church including the pastor C
[36:02] caught it very very very easily very
[36:06] simply and then at the end we just took
[36:08] time to explain what the scripture says
[36:11] lay laying on on of hands we don't
[36:13] doesn't even say you need to pray for
[36:14] him just just lay laying on of hands is
[36:17] the promise if we do it in the name of
[36:19] Jesus miracles happen gave we gave
[36:22] testimonies and so we just brought them
[36:24] forward and they came and we
[36:25] just put our hands upon him in jesus'
[36:28] name one of the one of the sisters had
[36:30] been having severe headaches for two
[36:33] months and when we laid hands on her she
[36:36] was
[36:37] instantly
[36:39] healed um another one came forward and
[36:42] she's been having terrible pain in her
[36:45] knee from uh
[36:48] osteoarthritis and it's been been that
[36:50] way for many many years and the Lord
[36:53] touched and healed her from that amen
[36:56] another church uh was got the testimony
[36:59] right after the service when I was
[37:00] speaking with people um we laid hands
[37:04] upon her and she had a uh you know
[37:06] sometimes it's lost they don't know how
[37:07] to translate medical terminology unless
[37:10] they have Google Translate in front of
[37:11] them so she has a pain in her wrist I
[37:14] didn't know what the pain was or what
[37:15] the source but she's had it for a while
[37:18] and when we laid hands on her the Lord
[37:20] instantly healed
[37:23] her so the Lord is really uh supernat
[37:27] naturally vindicating the message to
[37:29] these people there um if I can skip
[37:36] forward but we're still in the process
[37:38] of gathering testimonies I hope
[37:39] everybody can see that okay um
[37:44] so you have Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt
[37:49] which is turned around you would think
[37:52] it's the opposite way we think in terms
[37:53] of strongly in ter terms of North and
[37:56] South but they think in terms of
[37:58] elevation and where the Nile is coming
[38:01] from so for them basically anything
[38:05] under uh Cairo and the where the
[38:08] Pyramids of Giza are is they all
[38:10] consider that Upper Egypt
[38:13] so when when we aute is in Upper Egypt
[38:16] and magaga where we went to is also in
[38:20] in Upper Egypt there and it's uh it's
[38:24] it's just amazing you could see here
[38:26] what
[38:28] this looks like it's the there's two
[38:30] freeways that go back and forth or go up
[38:33] to Cairo on either side of that green
[38:37] patch that green patch of course is the
[38:38] Nile and then the Nile Delta at the
[38:41] top and I mean it's just very abrupt
[38:44] it's like this there's no well it slowly
[38:48] turns into the desert no it's like
[38:50] here's farmland and here is the desert
[38:53] it's just absolutely instant and um I I
[38:57] learned uh recently that so you see
[39:01] there there's like a green patch sort of
[39:05] halfway in the middle I'll just walk
[39:07] over and point to
[39:09] it that's a lake that was created um
[39:14] there was a there was a prince in Egypt
[39:16] many years ago named uh
[39:18] Joseph that uh
[39:22] built a
[39:24] canal for feeding other areas of
[39:27] Farmland built it off of the Nile so
[39:30] really it if you look at it you'd think
[39:32] it's a river
[39:33] now but it's a canal and it goes up and
[39:36] it actually empties out in a man-made
[39:38] lake that they made there and it's
[39:41] called the canal of
[39:43] Joseph and I started doing some re
[39:45] research and realized that yeah that's
[39:48] actually goes back he's the one that
[39:51] he's the one that commissioned it and
[39:53] had it built it's obviously not in
[39:54] Biblical history but it's in uh Egyptian
[39:58] history is quite quite
[40:00] amazing so
[40:03] um the the Arabic names are
[40:06] just very funny the
[40:09] shamal means it's it's one of the
[40:12] followers of of of Muhammad so this
[40:16] little Christian village it's all
[40:18] Christians is named after one of the
[40:20] followers of the prophet of
[40:22] Muhammad so um that sham zalan is the
[40:27] the city that we stay in when we go down
[40:30] to the magaga area and brother Prince
[40:33] you'll see some pictures of him he's
[40:35] he's our host he hosted us last year and
[40:37] he hosted us also this year and the
[40:39] Lord's really revealing himself to this
[40:42] brother so as as is obligatory right
[40:46] brother Ken uh everyone that's new I
[40:49] should be a tour guide
[40:51] um at least charge the fees of a tour
[40:54] guide right took brother Alex to the the
[40:57] pyramids
[40:59] and got a chance to see that went to a
[41:03] during the during the day you're just
[41:04] kind of hanging out resting and
[41:07] fellowshipping so uh when especially in
[41:09] Cairo get a chance to go see a few
[41:11] different things it's it's good never
[41:14] ceases to amaze me how massive these
[41:17] stones are for the Great
[41:21] Pyramid it's hard to it's hard to really
[41:24] even capture it with a with a picture
[41:26] but as you see there the people and then
[41:30] as the size of the stones and it just
[41:32] goes
[41:33] up
[41:35] forever Alex also didn't listen to me
[41:38] brother Ken and
[41:40] uh somebody ended up he didn't even have
[41:43] a cell phone with him he had an iPad I
[41:45] walked out of the bathroom he's got a
[41:47] thing on his head they're trying to put
[41:48] him on a camel and he's they got his
[41:51] iPad taking a picture I just walked up
[41:53] this guy and I said give me that no
[41:54] we're going to take a picture I said I'm
[41:56] capable of taking a a picture and I
[41:57] don't charge a tip
[42:00] so so but we had to give him a tip
[42:03] anyways and the camel needed a tip
[42:08] also
[42:10] so yeah it happens brother
[42:13] Ken if they can trick you they'll find a
[42:15] way to trick you into getting a
[42:18] tip so there's at the
[42:21] Sphinx somebody asked me there if I
[42:23] liked Obama
[42:31] and this is uh I just put in a bunch of
[42:34] different pictures I'll kind of go
[42:36] through them and talk a little bit about
[42:38] them and some of the services um like I
[42:41] said every service was preaching the
[42:43] word doing our best to keep it as as
[42:46] simple as possible praying for the sick
[42:50] and uh you know you you you you do pray
[42:52] for a lot of sick people but everybody
[42:54] wants to bring their kids forward to be
[42:56] to be blessed also so so you you end up
[42:58] you know laying hands on the entire
[43:00] church basically and maybe some people
[43:02] from the street
[43:05] too but uh the the the first night we
[43:08] preached I had service at a Baptist
[43:10] Church and um I think I realized that I
[43:16] needed to bring my uh airpods to every
[43:18] service because I was looking on my
[43:20] watch and it was consistently like 105
[43:23] 110 DB and it was like I was getting
[43:26] sick it was so so loud we asked we asked
[43:29] them even brother megaly who who travels
[43:31] with us got up and said you know if it's
[43:34] over 90 cuz I told Brother megal if it's
[43:35] over 90 DB at 30 minutes people are
[43:38] losing their hearing as the days went
[43:41] along and we're praying for everybody I
[43:43] realize the half the old people are
[43:45] coming and saying will you pray for me
[43:47] my ears hurt I have a headache and I'm
[43:50] like brother megaly the reason why every
[43:52] a message of brother brandham and the
[43:54] Holy Spirit can take that however he
[43:57] wants to do that into their hearts so
[43:59] we're we're thankful for
[44:03] that people still have actually year
[44:05] round it seems like people still have
[44:07] their Christmas
[44:08] decorations up maybe a tree in the
[44:11] corner sometimes a bunch of things of
[44:13] Santa Claus we one of the churches they
[44:15] preached at they had Santa Claus all
[44:17] over the place I counted there was
[44:21] 15 stickies or whatever of Santa Claus
[44:24] around I was like brother megal uh I
[44:26] think my should have a talk with this
[44:28] brother so we did and he's like oh I
[44:30] didn't know all that let me take it
[44:36] down some of the different brothers that
[44:39] we preach for and their elders and
[44:42] ministers and their
[44:43] churches
[44:46] um that particular Church uh that that
[44:51] service I felt to go a totally different
[44:54] way just went with no notes all I had
[44:57] the scripture was there was a man sent
[44:58] from God whose name was John and I went
[45:01] there and I just started going into
[45:03] telling about you know in in this hour
[45:06] in this day there's another man sent
[45:08] from God Amen whose name was William
[45:10] Branham and started going through his
[45:13] his life and his his birth and uh when
[45:17] the Whirlwind met him when he was young
[45:20] young boy into 1933 1946 1963 and then
[45:25] brought it to to into my testimony and
[45:29] and what the Lord can do for them and
[45:31] was it was uh the Lord really moved in
[45:33] this service
[45:35] wonderfully and
[45:39] um the the best part about all this is
[45:42] we have there's a brother that brother
[45:44] Prince as I mentioned I'm sure I have
[45:46] him and he helped us hand out the books
[45:48] of brother brandham last time we were
[45:50] there when we had a bunch of books with
[45:52] them brother Prince wanted to have keep
[45:54] them he didn't want brother megal to
[45:55] take them out I want to keep them in him
[45:57] out to the rest of the churches and this
[45:59] time as he's listening to our messages
[46:01] I'm just trying to I'm looking at him
[46:03] like how's he doing with all this and so
[46:06] finally the Lord led me down the line to
[46:08] preach and what is the name and to go
[46:10] into baptism and I said so what did you
[46:12] think of that message he's like brother
[46:14] I thought it was true before because I
[46:16] read the the book but now now it's now
[46:19] I'm completely convinced so I said okay
[46:22] so we have this church and another
[46:25] church and your church I said where
[46:26] should should we when should we meet for
[46:29] re-baptized everybody as I made that
[46:31] part of my message Acts 19 these these
[46:34] men had to be re-baptized in the name of
[46:36] the Lord Jesus Christ then I told my own
[46:38] testimony about because they're all
[46:40] they're all part of the Coptic church so
[46:43] they're sprinkled as infants then
[46:46] they're now now they're in a Pentecostal
[46:47] Church they've been baptized or baptized
[46:51] in the titles so I I told them my
[46:55] testimony I was a Lutheran got sprinkled
[46:58] then I got grew up and my family moved
[47:00] to a Baptist Church and so I got
[47:02] immersed in the titles Father Son and
[47:04] Holy Ghost but then the Lord brought
[47:06] brought the truth to me and I had I got
[47:08] re-baptized again so I emphasized that
[47:10] with them and the brother was like yeah
[47:12] there's a pool over here we can we can
[47:14] bring everyone there to re-baptize him
[47:16] so I was I was I was really surprised at
[47:19] his answer but
[47:23] thankful kids getting getting the books
[47:26] too so
[47:37] cute some of the services we did take
[47:40] you know people's requests and pray over
[47:42] them but we found that it was like the
[47:44] pastor walks up to us and is
[47:48] like it's time to get out of here it's
[47:50] like okay yeah it is
[47:53] 11:00 and service usually would start
[47:55] like 6:37
[48:15] that's uh so next to me there is brother
[48:19] uh megaly he's the one I've been working
[48:21] with in Egypt for for seven years and uh
[48:26] man he's he put in tremendous amount of
[48:29] work to translate and preach and share
[48:32] the message and honestly for the up
[48:35] until just recently it's been in many
[48:38] ways quite a fruitless work at least to
[48:41] the eyes because he had a church and we
[48:44] introduced them the message did many
[48:46] conference with with them and some other
[48:48] guy promised to give everybody in the
[48:50] church money and so the whole church
[48:53] just left him so he said okay I'll just
[48:56] go start another Church in a poor area
[48:59] and help those people so he he did and
[49:00] he started there but then the Lord
[49:02] opened this door amongst this
[49:04] Pentecostal group and it's just uh we're
[49:08] so thankful to see this and he was he
[49:10] was about in tears hearing what brother
[49:12] Prince was saying and the different
[49:13] pastors were saying about about what
[49:16] they were hearing of the
[49:19] message and this is is uh brother meal's
[49:23] son who he's 23 years old and he's been
[49:26] been translating for me for 7
[49:29] years and he's he's gone all his life to
[49:32] an English school and just uh tremendous
[49:35] I think about that as a 16-year-old
[49:37] trying to translate some of the messages
[49:39] we did for the people there and
[49:42] uh this very talented and and uh
[49:47] intelligent young
[49:50] man this is our typical thing so in once
[49:53] you get out of Cairo um you can't really
[49:57] go without military uh and police escort
[50:01] so typically they'll be they'll F they
[50:03] follow us wherever we go and this before
[50:06] there was just a few people but this
[50:08] time there was like four people in
[50:10] military
[50:12] fatigues and uh they were really you
[50:16] could see that they were really serious
[50:17] and they were concerned about it of
[50:19] course in in Upper Egypt it's a lot of
[50:21] villages and kind of
[50:24] backwards backwards uh Islamic ways and
[50:28] so the Muslim Brotherhood is very active
[50:30] in these areas so there really is a
[50:32] serious concern about
[50:36] um uh security and uh so every time you
[50:40] got you got the police behind you and
[50:42] there's a few times where we went back
[50:43] by by big groups of people and they
[50:46] quick get in front of you and the guys
[50:48] are getting their rifles ready
[50:51] um to go as they're going forward by
[50:54] God's grace everything was fine I'm I'm
[50:56] sure that the main reason why it was
[50:58] fine was the Lord and then second reason
[51:01] was that these military officials were
[51:04] pretty serious and then they after uh
[51:07] president Trump made his comments about
[51:09] Gaza you could see that they were really
[51:11] stepping up the security even more and
[51:13] more concerned even even one of the
[51:15] churches we were supposed to go preach
[51:16] at it was in a city called the Sons of
[51:19] Muhammad uh and the the it was about an
[51:22] hour away from where we were staying and
[51:24] they said no I don't think that's a good
[51:27] security situation I we you shouldn't go
[51:30] to that so we end up canceling that
[51:31] service
[51:33] and on on that Friday before we
[51:37] left so I'm not sure if it's going to
[51:39] play the videos but the uh yeah get just
[51:44] a little picture even if there's no
[51:46] sound
[51:47] of your brain getting jostled the entire
[51:51] way roads are incredibly bumpy pretty
[51:55] much I would say that's the typical
[51:58] Honduras and uh Africa Road situation
[52:03] you there's no falling asleep unless
[52:05] you're like coma toast pretty
[52:10] much man this this is the church we
[52:12] preach in in uh the typical way that the
[52:17] Protestant churches set up their
[52:18] churches they'll have like the the
[52:21] sanctuary on the main level and then
[52:23] they'll have Sunday school rooms on the
[52:25] next level and then they'll have living
[52:27] quarters on an upper level and so the
[52:29] living quarters are typically for
[52:31] visitors to stay in so that's we
[52:33] preached on this is the ground floor and
[52:35] the place we stayed was two floors up
[52:38] from this during the week that we were
[52:40] in the magaga
[52:45] area so um each day during the day we
[52:49] would get out get out for a little walk
[52:51] through the farm fields and when we did
[52:55] um they always called one of the the
[52:57] local police officers to to go with us
[53:00] and kind of watch over us and uh make
[53:02] sure security was
[53:05] good
[53:09] but beautiful beautiful Farmland I think
[53:12] they're growing
[53:13] wheat
[53:16] now um
[53:26] love seeing this just the
[53:28] traditional very very modest women in uh
[53:33] Upper Egypt very traditional even the
[53:35] men you'll see many times in the the
[53:39] full tunic that goes down to the their
[53:41] feet with the turbans on their heads and
[53:44] as an American you can't imagine that
[53:45] they're actually Christians you think
[53:47] well this is how Muslims dress but
[53:48] they're that's how that's how the
[53:50] Christians
[53:52] dress mus the Muslims stole it from them
[54:12] brother megal
[54:29] see I think there's a video here we we
[54:31] took this this is hooked up to just a
[54:34] pulley and you just pull yourself across
[54:36] this this is the
[54:39] um uh this is the Joseph's uh
[54:42] Canal we went across crocod I don't know
[54:47] that there's
[54:49] crocodiles Alex up there pulling us
[54:51] across the the river
[54:59] we're
[55:01] crossing this is also the typical Egypt
[55:04] they've got these canals in the middle
[55:05] of the cities and it ends up being a
[55:07] place where they pull water for their uh
[55:10] farmlands and also pretty much a garbage
[55:14] dump the poverty level there is pretty
[55:17] incredible um I was speaking with them
[55:20] just about like wages day wages and so
[55:23] forth and in Upper Egypt a farmer
[55:27] working like the first half of the day
[55:29] that would be hired in the field makes
[55:30] $3 so if you work both halves of the day
[55:33] you make
[55:34] $6 a day
[55:42] there this church was incredible they
[55:44] actually don't have a pastor it's just a
[55:47] uh a group of Elders and you know kind
[55:51] of a head Elder that oversees things and
[55:55] I uh when I was preaching on on on water
[56:00] baptism I want I wanted to take it a
[56:01] little different way I went into first I
[56:04] read in uh John 17 where Jesus says I
[56:09] I've
[56:09] manifested father I've manifested your
[56:12] name unto the men you have given me so I
[56:15] really spent time emphasizing so there's
[56:18] an importance of having a revelation of
[56:20] the name of the father I if you want to
[56:23] be one of those men that are in
[56:25] connection with Christ you have to be
[56:28] one that has the father's name revealed
[56:30] to you so then took it through you know
[56:32] there's one place that he put his name
[56:34] and then brought it to I've come in my
[56:36] father's name I said so I just asked the
[56:38] whole church I said so what's the F
[56:39] father's name Jesus then I went to John
[56:43] 14 and said you know the the comforter
[56:46] the Holy Spirit whom the father will
[56:48] send in my name said so what name does
[56:50] the Holy Spirit come in Jesus all right
[56:54] so
[56:54] then then I go go into and they're
[56:58] answering for me I'm not answering it
[56:59] for them they're answering it then I go
[57:01] into Luke 24 repentance and forgiv
[57:05] remission of sins should be preached in
[57:08] my name I said what name
[57:10] Jesus then Mark 16 so I go each gospel
[57:14] now we see in John 17 we see it's the
[57:17] name of Jesus in Luke 24 it's the name
[57:22] of Jesus in Mark 16 what it's the name
[57:25] of Jesus
[57:26] so now we go to Matthew 28:19 the name
[57:29] of Father Son and Holy Ghost is Father a
[57:31] name is son a name is Holy Ghost a name
[57:33] no no no all right so what name is it
[57:37] and I I just expected silence like this
[57:39] is the thinking time how am I going to
[57:41] figure it out people are just shouting
[57:43] over the whole church Jesus and I was
[57:45] like my goodness I didn't even open the
[57:47] book of Acts yet that was the particular
[57:50] service that I asked brother Prince
[57:52] afterwards so what is your what is your
[57:55] take on all this
[57:56] I see
[57:58] it so so thankful to see what the Lord's
[58:02] doing very simple faith when these these
[58:05] men came forward um asking for for a
[58:10] move a great move of the holy spirit in
[58:12] their church that was most of their the
[58:14] elders
[58:16] requests really touched my
[58:21] heart in
[58:23] the in the regular clothes next to me
[58:26] the Egyptian there uh one over from me
[58:29] that's brother Prince who's our host in
[58:32] uh this area he's also the secretary of
[58:36] the um Pentecostal Church in Egypt so uh
[58:43] he's has contact with almost all the
[58:45] pastors there and the fact that the
[58:48] Lord's really dealing with him it's a
[58:50] really a tremendous thing and a
[58:52] tremendous opportunity that opens up
[58:55] most all the churches
[58:57] that that are there that are Pentecostal
[58:59] across the whole country of
[59:03] Egypt he's he's in the back just
[59:06] surprises me I see that in the back he
[59:09] was in charge all the time every time
[59:11] going out to hand out brother bram's
[59:13] messages to everybody
[59:26] this is at uh the orphanage in acute
[59:29] this is how many has ever heard of
[59:31] Lillian Trasher or read her testimony
[59:34] okay so this is this is the orphanage
[59:37] that she started there she she passed
[59:40] away in
[59:41] 1961 but still it's still going and uh
[59:45] we have an open door to minister there
[59:48] it's Assemblies of God uh Under the
[59:51] Umbrella of Assemblies of God
[59:53] denomination so they they they support
[59:55] it
[59:57] brother megaly actually I was I was
[1:00:00] thinking about this while I was there
[1:00:02] and you know how God how God does things
[1:00:04] and how he moves in different ways and
[1:00:06] he can you know he to in order to get to
[1:00:09] his predestinated seed he will move
[1:00:11] Heaven and Earth and use a whole
[1:00:13] person's life just to get to that one
[1:00:16] seed and I begin to think about all the
[1:00:18] testimony and all the great things that
[1:00:21] God used lilan Trasher to do and I
[1:00:23] realize maybe she maybe back in the
[1:00:28] early 1900s God led her there because
[1:00:31] they knew there was going to be brother
[1:00:33] megali was going to
[1:00:35] need his mother was going to die his
[1:00:38] father was going to say I can't take
[1:00:39] care of this child they're going to say
[1:00:41] bring her to the orphanage bring him to
[1:00:43] the orphanage and they were going to
[1:00:44] raise him to love the word of God to
[1:00:47] understand the word of
[1:00:49] God and then the revelation of the
[1:00:51] message comes to his heart and now he's
[1:00:53] I mean really if if you if you look at
[1:00:56] at it he he's really one of the only
[1:01:00] full Believers of the message of the
[1:01:02] hour in Egypt at this point in time and
[1:01:05] one of the very few arabic
[1:01:08] speaking Believers of the word and so a
[1:01:12] lot rests on his shoulders so pray for
[1:01:14] him hold him up he's got a surgery
[1:01:17] coming up on a hernia surgery this this
[1:01:20] Saturday so remember him in prayer but
[1:01:23] wonderful to be a part of this and be
[1:01:26] able to see the kids we stay I think on
[1:01:29] the on the campus of the orphanage for
[1:01:33] three days so got out and walked around
[1:01:36] the campus and got to meet all kinds of
[1:01:38] kids they all want to shake your hand
[1:01:39] and say hi and ask if you like American
[1:01:43] or not American football but if you like
[1:01:45] the real football as they call
[1:01:47] it who's your
[1:01:50] favorite I don't know I only know Messi
[1:01:53] that's
[1:01:54] all don't follow it
[1:01:58] but just tremendous to see the kids
[1:02:00] there
[1:02:05] [Music]
[1:02:07] and God bless you probably my favorite
[1:02:11] part of the whole trip I'm going to
[1:02:12] switch I'm going to switch to this
[1:02:14] oneing out candy to all the
[1:02:21] kids than
[1:02:38] really special place
[1:02:40] and just so
[1:02:43] thankful how the Lord is opening doors
[1:02:45] and how the seed is being planted in
[1:02:48] Hearts you know it's it's been a long
[1:02:50] time and many people paying lip service
[1:02:53] to the message and saying that believe
[1:02:55] it but to really see you know brothers
[1:02:58] that that uh are catching it and their
[1:03:02] their desire is come back so we can
[1:03:03] re-baptize people so by God's grace in
[1:03:08] uh April end of April into early May
[1:03:11] I'll be going back and then in August
[1:03:14] we're going to try to gather all the
[1:03:15] ministers together to really lay the
[1:03:18] message out to everybody um probably in
[1:03:21] in the middle of August working on a
[1:03:23] plan for that but remember that in
[1:03:25] prayer it's kind of be most mostly my
[1:03:28] focus is working on that um we're going
[1:03:31] to do a full edit of the church ages
[1:03:34] book and try to get that printed as well
[1:03:36] as uh translate the Seven Seals like to
[1:03:40] have those both translated and edited
[1:03:43] and and printed by by August so we could
[1:03:46] put one in the hands of all their
[1:03:47] ministers in their church so just
[1:03:50] remember that all in prayer and uh I
[1:03:53] can't believe I went through 64 screens
[1:03:55] that fast but we're going to go to the
[1:03:58] scriptures and take a few
[1:04:00] minutes
[1:04:02] Galatians uh chapter
[1:04:10] three speak a little bit
[1:04:14] about be justified by faith but after
[1:04:19] that faith is come we're no long longer
[1:04:21] under a school Master for you are all
[1:04:24] children of God by faith in Christ Jesus
[1:04:27] for as many of you as have been baptized
[1:04:29] into Christ have put on Christ there is
[1:04:32] neither Jew nor Greek there's neither
[1:04:34] Bond nor free there's neither male nor
[1:04:36] female for you're all one in Christ
[1:04:39] Jesus and if you be christs then are you
[1:04:41] Abraham's seed and HS according to the
[1:04:45] promise amen so as we look at the
[1:04:49] background in the book of this letter to
[1:04:53] Galatians that Paul writes of course we
[1:04:56] understand that there's a there's a big
[1:04:58] problem going on and that's that these
[1:05:00] people have had an experience with God
[1:05:03] they've heard the true gospel and
[1:05:05] someone's come behind and is sowing
[1:05:07] false seed amongst them and it's
[1:05:09] bringing confusion in them and so as we
[1:05:13] see Paul is building he's first telling
[1:05:15] them you know if anybody preaches
[1:05:18] anything then you've already heard and
[1:05:19] received let him let him be a cursed
[1:05:22] even if even if I change the message or
[1:05:24] an angel comes from heaven changes the
[1:05:26] message no it it can't be done can't be
[1:05:29] done what's already been preached to you
[1:05:31] is the truth and it didn't come to you
[1:05:34] you know by agreement of men or by me
[1:05:38] going to the apostles and saying please
[1:05:39] teach me the gospel I went into Arabia
[1:05:42] and I received the message directly from
[1:05:44] Jesus Christ by Revelation from Jesus
[1:05:47] Christ I didn't consult with any man
[1:05:49] except for when I went to Jerusalem I
[1:05:52] made known what the Lord had revealed to
[1:05:54] me to Peter and James and John and all
[1:05:57] they could say is praise the Lord that's
[1:06:00] exactly right just remember the poor
[1:06:03] that's that's all that's the only advice
[1:06:05] we can give to you so they added nothing
[1:06:08] to the Apostle
[1:06:10] Paul and didn't contradict
[1:06:12] him and so then he said many of there's
[1:06:16] there's uh false brothers that have
[1:06:18] crept in
[1:06:20] unawares and they they're bringing a
[1:06:23] false
[1:06:24] gospel to you and now you're lisening
[1:06:27] and you're putting up with
[1:06:28] that and why you were you were already
[1:06:33] under the school master and you
[1:06:36] graduated you already graduated because
[1:06:39] you've received the promise of the
[1:06:41] Spirit by faith amen you you have been
[1:06:45] placed as Sons so now you've been put
[1:06:49] positionally put into the place as sons
[1:06:52] and now you want to go back and say dear
[1:06:54] School master please help me please give
[1:06:57] me direction I need the school Master to
[1:07:00] come back
[1:07:01] that's you're you've already you've
[1:07:03] already entered into the position of
[1:07:05] sunship Amen why do you want to go back
[1:07:09] as Paul says to the weak and beggarly
[1:07:12] elements the law you're go you're going
[1:07:15] back to the law to try to assure
[1:07:18] yourself did you receive the Holy Spirit
[1:07:21] by The Works of the law or did you
[1:07:24] receive the Spirit by the the hearing of
[1:07:26] Faith
[1:07:28] amen and so the the answer to the
[1:07:31] question is is obvious they received it
[1:07:32] by the hearing of Faith they didn't
[1:07:34] receive it because well they got
[1:07:36] circumcised and they started following
[1:07:38] the law of Moses and now suddenly they
[1:07:39] have the Holy Spirit no Paul says
[1:07:41] actually those people that are telling
[1:07:44] you to go back to circumcision and the
[1:07:45] law they're just telling you you have to
[1:07:48] become a little baby
[1:07:49] again go back to
[1:07:53] Childhood you've already graduated you
[1:07:56] the father has taken you out done a
[1:07:58] ceremony over you and said your name on
[1:08:00] the check is just as good as mine amen
[1:08:03] he's given you the the Holy Ghost amen
[1:08:06] whereby you cry ABA father you've
[1:08:08] already received it why is it necessary
[1:08:12] now to go back to
[1:08:14] kindergarten don't go back to kinder
[1:08:16] Garten
[1:08:18] continue you know and this is what Paul
[1:08:21] this is the kind of the emphasis that
[1:08:24] Paul is having he's giving different
[1:08:26] examples and different things but the
[1:08:28] whole picture of the book of
[1:08:30] Galatians is that is that you have you
[1:08:33] you have entered into a
[1:08:36] relationship with God that's that is the
[1:08:40] fruition of what he did for Abraham amen
[1:08:44] you you've received the promise you've
[1:08:46] already the promise seed is Christ not
[1:08:49] the Jews amen Christ is the promised
[1:08:52] seed you've received that promised seed
[1:08:54] and through Christ you're all children
[1:08:57] of
[1:08:58] Abraham and of course you know
[1:09:00] throughout all of Paul's Epistles and
[1:09:02] especially the book of Galatians we
[1:09:04] understand God was always saving people
[1:09:06] by Faith No One kept the law with
[1:09:08] perfection did David keep the law of
[1:09:10] perfection I would say
[1:09:12] not a million miles from it so how was
[1:09:15] he saved by faith he how was he saved it
[1:09:17] was by faith the just shall live by
[1:09:20] faith that's
[1:09:21] habach that's not a new testament thing
[1:09:24] that's the whole thing Abraham was saved
[1:09:26] by
[1:09:27] faith even if they were following the
[1:09:29] law they never it was just proving they
[1:09:32] couldn't follow the law and it was
[1:09:34] merely a school Master to forward them
[1:09:37] to
[1:09:41] Christ the school Master can't make you
[1:09:43] a new
[1:09:45] creation the tutors and governors is
[1:09:48] training you so you can get to the place
[1:09:51] where you receive what you need to
[1:09:52] receive so when you receive what you
[1:09:54] need to receive you don't have to go
[1:09:56] backwards under the tutor anymore under
[1:09:59] the school Master anymore you've
[1:10:02] graduated the man the man that is the
[1:10:05] son of a property owner he of course the
[1:10:08] property owner is busy so he assigns a
[1:10:11] tutor to teach him and train him so that
[1:10:14] he understands what his position is so
[1:10:18] he can learn how to properly relate to
[1:10:21] those that he is to govern to to to to
[1:10:24] lead and to provide for and to manage
[1:10:28] right and so he's been tutored he's been
[1:10:30] trained and that's what the law is sent
[1:10:33] for even Paul alludes to that in
[1:10:36] Galatians 4 that even for the Gentiles
[1:10:39] the weak and beggarly El elements
[1:10:42] idolatry for them was even a school
[1:10:45] Master to lead them to Christ strange
[1:10:47] very strange that Paul puts it that way
[1:10:50] but he's saying why would you want to go
[1:10:52] back to what you were before when you've
[1:10:54] already re received the promise
[1:10:57] amen and that's a great danger even for
[1:11:01] Christians of of our day is that we can
[1:11:04] get so zealous for God we really have an
[1:11:07] experience with him he changes us but
[1:11:09] then we want to maintain our walk by The
[1:11:13] Works of the law and it becomes a
[1:11:16] stumbling block to us and to everyone
[1:11:18] around us it's only by faith
[1:11:22] amen many times we look we we miss that
[1:11:26] Faith
[1:11:28] produces fruit right how do I know if I
[1:11:32] really have faith how do I know if I'm I
[1:11:35] I really have the Holy Spirit always
[1:11:37] produces fruit that's what brother
[1:11:38] brandom said every time when brother
[1:11:40] when the Lord dealt with brother
[1:11:42] brandham and corrected him on what the
[1:11:44] evidence of the Holy Ghost is as you see
[1:11:46] and go through the different statements
[1:11:48] that the prophet makes it's believing
[1:11:51] the written word when it's Vindicated
[1:11:53] that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:56] well brother brandom how do I know if I
[1:11:58] have it it produces the same life that's
[1:12:02] what he says over and over and over
[1:12:04] again the evidence is not the production
[1:12:08] of the life that's the problem and
[1:12:09] that's where the mind of man goes to
[1:12:12] immediately well I've got I've got this
[1:12:14] and I've got that brother bham says
[1:12:17] nonsense they can out the the Pharisees
[1:12:19] can outdo you
[1:12:22] yeah Matthew 7 tells us that that can't
[1:12:25] be the evidence because they prophesied
[1:12:28] they cast out Devils they did many
[1:12:30] mighty works in the name of Jesus and
[1:12:32] Jesus said that's no evidence of
[1:12:35] anything it's the one that does the will
[1:12:37] of my
[1:12:41] father what's the will of the father
[1:12:43] believe on the one that he
[1:12:45] sent brother brandham in Christ is the
[1:12:48] mystery of God revealed says what is the
[1:12:49] new birth you'd say well brother brandom
[1:12:51] what is the new birth it's the
[1:12:52] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:12:55] you amen see not you joined a church you
[1:12:58] shook a hand you done something
[1:12:59] different you said a Creed you promised
[1:13:00] to live by a code of rules but Christ
[1:13:02] the Bible he is the word that was
[1:13:04] revealed to you and no matter what
[1:13:06] anybody says what takes place it's
[1:13:08] Christ Pastor priest whatever it might
[1:13:10] be it's Christ in you that is the
[1:13:13] Revelation that the church was built
[1:13:15] upon
[1:13:17] amen amen what is what is what is first
[1:13:20] of all what is
[1:13:22] faith faith is a revelation
[1:13:27] so how do you let's let's dig a little
[1:13:29] further on that so how do you faith is
[1:13:33] more than merely a revelation because
[1:13:36] faith in in encapsulates also
[1:13:39] trust right you trust God you believe
[1:13:43] you take his word as it is and you
[1:13:46] believe it no matter what so you obtain
[1:13:50] Faith by spiritual Revelation amen so
[1:13:55] it's not your faith it's not you doing
[1:13:59] it it's not human Faith amen It's
[1:14:03] Supernatural faith is a gift of God not
[1:14:07] of Works lest any man should boast so
[1:14:09] how do I how do I obtain it God has to
[1:14:12] give it to you I can't give it to you I
[1:14:15] can preach brother Jason can preach 365
[1:14:18] days a year and that can never give you
[1:14:21] the faith God has to sovereignly give it
[1:14:24] to you as a gift through his unmar
[1:14:30] favor so how do we know how do we know
[1:14:32] if we have faith I I think that's a
[1:14:35] that's an interesting
[1:14:37] question how do you know if you have
[1:14:40] faith you
[1:14:42] know you know there's a witness Amen in
[1:14:46] you isn't that what scripture says his
[1:14:49] Spirit Bears record with bears witness
[1:14:52] with our spirit that we are the sons of
[1:14:55] of
[1:14:57] God Amen and we don't go by feelings
[1:15:00] emotions experiences we go by what the
[1:15:03] word
[1:15:04] says the word has become everything to
[1:15:06] you right and you want to live that word
[1:15:09] with all your heart am amen and there's
[1:15:13] something inside of you that God is
[1:15:15] causing it to
[1:15:16] live besides your stupid choices and
[1:15:20] your mistakes and your failures
[1:15:22] something's rising up with you push in
[1:15:25] you forward that you can't
[1:15:28] control cuz salvation and the outworking
[1:15:31] of Salvation is a sovereign work of God
[1:15:34] we must absolutely make a choice we must
[1:15:37] surrender to that work you know it's
[1:15:40] it's work out your salvation with fear
[1:15:43] and trembling but that's not that's one
[1:15:44] verse the next verse tells us how we
[1:15:47] work out our salvation with fear and
[1:15:48] trembling it says because it is God that
[1:15:51] works in you both to Will and to do of
[1:15:53] his good pleasure so if God is working
[1:15:55] in you to Will and to do of his good
[1:15:57] pleasure therefore you are going to work
[1:16:01] out your salvation with fear and
[1:16:04] trembling you working is a result of God
[1:16:08] working and ultimately it comes to
[1:16:10] there's something inside of you that's
[1:16:13] pushing you forward that's carrying you
[1:16:15] through that you're sure you're you're
[1:16:17] sure that in yourself I can't make it I
[1:16:20] can't do it I I won't survive that and
[1:16:23] somehow you're just walking walking and
[1:16:25] you're going forward and God is keeping
[1:16:28] you and he's strengthening you and he's
[1:16:30] using these difficulties and trials and
[1:16:32] horrible things that are happening and
[1:16:34] suddenly you're you're you're you're
[1:16:36] you're growing you're maturing you're
[1:16:38] strengthening it's it's it's an
[1:16:40] amazing thing that God does that uh
[1:16:45] truly you know we can we can understand
[1:16:47] the fact of it but we can't really
[1:16:50] understand what's exactly causing this
[1:16:52] to happen because most people other
[1:16:54] people happens to and suddenly they're
[1:16:56] none of it works and they're out in the
[1:16:58] world and it makes no sense and God
[1:17:00] didn't help me it's
[1:17:03] like I can't do anything but
[1:17:06] believe that's what God even Bes even
[1:17:10] besides my own doubts all I can do is
[1:17:18] believe brother bam says and who do you
[1:17:20] say this is is there any here that
[1:17:22] hasn't received the baptism of the
[1:17:24] spirit yet now you say brother brandom I
[1:17:26] tell you I shouted one time that's very
[1:17:28] good I spoke in tongues once that's very
[1:17:30] good too but still that ain't what I'm
[1:17:33] talking about how can you shout and
[1:17:35] speak in tongues and deny the word the
[1:17:38] evidence of the Holy Ghost is believing
[1:17:41] the word always been every age if you
[1:17:45] can receive the word
[1:17:50] amen in the sermon Shalom brother bam
[1:17:54] says how would you know what's right the
[1:17:56] manifestation of the spoken word of God
[1:17:58] being made manifest light of the hour
[1:18:00] certainly there is what the evidence of
[1:18:03] the holy spirit is believing the word of
[1:18:05] God when it's manifested he was the word
[1:18:08] manifested and some of them denied it
[1:18:10] laughed at it made fun of him called him
[1:18:12] a fortune teller some evil spirit there
[1:18:14] is evidence speaking in tongues there's
[1:18:16] evidence of the fruits the only evidence
[1:18:18] there is is when a man believe the
[1:18:19] written word when it's Vindicated walk
[1:18:22] in the light of it Jesus was the light
[1:18:24] of the hour because he was the promised
[1:18:25] word of the hour and tried to tell them
[1:18:27] so but they were too much in darkness to
[1:18:30] understand it so is it today now
[1:18:37] amen it isn't so much about initial
[1:18:41] evidences I think this this uh te
[1:18:45] Pentecostal teaching is sort of becomes
[1:18:48] a misnomer the initial
[1:18:51] evidence is more than just an initial
[1:18:55] evidence this is a continuous work of
[1:18:58] God in our
[1:19:01] lives you know brother brandham says in
[1:19:03] broken sisters but one day the Lord in a
[1:19:04] vision straightened me out and he said
[1:19:06] that the evidence of the spirit was
[1:19:07] those who could receive the word neither
[1:19:10] love nor speaking in tongues but it's
[1:19:12] receiving the word now we can go and say
[1:19:15] well what about this and and what about
[1:19:17] that and what about over uh here well I
[1:19:21] mean we can see it in the message we can
[1:19:24] see see it in the
[1:19:26] scripture what about all the exceptions
[1:19:29] that we have maybe the exceptions that
[1:19:31] we have in our brain to this are
[1:19:33] actually just manifestations of
[1:19:36] unbelief and that's problematic for all
[1:19:39] of
[1:19:41] us we have to go we have to go by what
[1:19:44] the word says not what our
[1:19:46] interpretations not the things that make
[1:19:48] us feel
[1:19:51] comfortable when Peter was speaking to
[1:19:54] Cornelius in the house of Cornelius and
[1:19:57] I when I see when I hear this and I see
[1:19:59] this I think back to what he says in the
[1:20:01] book of
[1:20:02] Galatians while Peter yet spake these
[1:20:05] words the Holy Ghost fell on all them
[1:20:08] which heard the word
[1:20:10] amen we want to work ourselves up into
[1:20:13] something we want to we want to make
[1:20:14] sure that everybody sees that you know
[1:20:17] our services are the best
[1:20:19] Services what about producing people
[1:20:21] that believe the word regardless of what
[1:20:23] circumstances they are in
[1:20:25] I regard that personally as something
[1:20:28] far
[1:20:29] above great manifestations in the
[1:20:31] service I believe in manifestations in
[1:20:33] the service I believe in shouting I
[1:20:35] believe in dancing but if it's only that
[1:20:37] and that's our main focus and emphasis
[1:20:40] then we're not really preaching the word
[1:20:42] of the word of God for this age amen
[1:20:46] this only would I learn of you receive
[1:20:48] ye the Spirit by The Works of the
[1:20:51] law or by the hearing of faith it's as
[1:20:55] simple as that brothers and
[1:20:57] sisters do you believe the
[1:21:00] word yeah but I didn't do this and I
[1:21:02] didn't do that do you believe the word
[1:21:05] because we're saved by faith not by
[1:21:07] works not by outward
[1:21:09] demonstrations Christ saved us he
[1:21:13] accomplished the work it's faith in a
[1:21:15] finished work of Jesus Christ and the
[1:21:18] New Covenant is when the Holy Spirit
[1:21:20] comes into your life and changes you
[1:21:23] amen amen has that happen for you if
[1:21:25] that hasn't happened then get that if it
[1:21:29] produces emotions it might it might not
[1:21:33] but get the change get the
[1:21:34] transformation be
[1:21:36] regenerated be converted have a nature
[1:21:40] change that causes you to believe the
[1:21:42] word no matter what that's that's the
[1:21:45] emphasis that's what's
[1:21:47] important
[1:21:49] amen Galatians 3 3-5 are you so foolish
[1:21:53] having be done in the spirit are you now
[1:21:56] made perfect by the flesh have you
[1:21:58] suffered so many things in vain if it
[1:22:01] yet be in vain he therefore that
[1:22:04] ministereth the spirit to you and
[1:22:05] worketh miracles among you doeth he it
[1:22:09] by The Works of the law or by the
[1:22:11] hearing of faith if you want to be
[1:22:13] healed you can be healed right now by
[1:22:15] faith I don't have to lay hands on you
[1:22:17] the pastor doesn't have you can just
[1:22:19] receive it you want to be saved just
[1:22:23] believe
[1:22:25] amen but but I got to come up and you
[1:22:27] got to lay hands on me and I got to
[1:22:28] shout no you
[1:22:32] don't maybe I'm a heretic that's fine
[1:22:35] call me a heretic but I believe the word
[1:22:38] of God no matter what man says about it
[1:22:41] and that's what Christians
[1:22:52] do 1 Corinthians 21:14 says the natural
[1:22:55] man receives not the things of the
[1:22:56] spirit of God for their foolishness unto
[1:22:58] him neither can he know them because
[1:23:01] they are spiritually
[1:23:05] discerned so only only a man that has
[1:23:08] been changed that has receive the Holy
[1:23:11] Spirit we're given the holy spirit so
[1:23:13] that we can know the things that are
[1:23:15] freely given to us by God that's what
[1:23:17] scripture says so the holy spirit is
[1:23:21] what comes to produce a spiritual
[1:23:23] Revelation in our hearts
[1:23:26] in the church age book brother bam says
[1:23:27] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:29] you can never have your eyes open to a
[1:23:30] true spiritual revelation of the word a
[1:23:33] man without the spirit is blind to God
[1:23:36] and His
[1:23:38] truth so then Romans 10:17 so then Faith
[1:23:43] cometh by working yourself up into
[1:23:48] emotions oh whoops read it wrong so
[1:23:52] Faith then Faith cometh by hearing
[1:23:55] and hearing by the word of God Amen so I
[1:23:58] want to I want to tell you something I
[1:24:00] want to give you a secret you want to
[1:24:01] know how to grow in your walk with God
[1:24:04] hear the word of God with
[1:24:07] faith you want to grow more hear it more
[1:24:10] with faith amen it's not necessary to
[1:24:13] work yourself up God will take care of
[1:24:15] that just be open to God moving in your
[1:24:18] life but make sure it's always according
[1:24:20] to the word that's what the prophet
[1:24:22] instructed us every experience we judge
[1:24:25] it by the word but be open to the Holy
[1:24:27] Spirit moving in you but first approach
[1:24:30] him by faith don't think you have to
[1:24:33] work yourself into it to get healed to
[1:24:35] get saved to whatever it is that's not
[1:24:38] the gospel amen the gospel Comes To Us
[1:24:41] by faith Abraham was was justified by
[1:24:47] faith he's the father of us all he
[1:24:50] simply believed what God said he heard
[1:24:52] what God said he believed it and he was
[1:24:53] justified amen same thing applies for us
[1:24:57] and even the Holy Spirit receiving the
[1:24:59] Holy Spirit it isn't suddenly well
[1:25:01] you're saved by faith but then you got
[1:25:02] to work yourself into the Holy
[1:25:04] Spirit did you re this only will I learn
[1:25:07] of you are you so foolish Galatians did
[1:25:11] you receive the Spirit by The Works of
[1:25:13] the law or by the hearing of Faith
[1:25:16] hearing of faith
[1:25:30] Jesus said no man can come to
[1:25:35] me I know there's more to that verse but
[1:25:37] I'm just stopping there so that you can
[1:25:40] catch the emphasis CU he says no man can
[1:25:43] come to
[1:25:44] me no man wants to come to him we don't
[1:25:47] seek God that's not how it
[1:25:50] works human nature turns away from God
[1:25:53] and rejects the word of God no man can
[1:25:57] come to me except the father draws him
[1:26:01] first so it's not us coming to God and
[1:26:03] then God suddenly giving us something
[1:26:05] but it's God by his Sovereign purpose
[1:26:09] drawing us to him first and it's in that
[1:26:13] drawing that God gives Faith amen and
[1:26:18] it's a gift it's a free gift it's not
[1:26:20] something we earned it's not something
[1:26:22] that we worked ourselves into so
[1:26:24] it is
[1:26:26] only by his grace he has given you Faith
[1:26:30] because you you know many people humanly
[1:26:34] believe in the great qualities of Jesus
[1:26:36] Christ many people humanly say this is
[1:26:39] this is right this is true they they
[1:26:41] grow up in church and they come to
[1:26:42] understand that Christianity is the
[1:26:45] truth but that's different than
[1:26:47] receiving the gift of
[1:26:48] faith that's different than God coming
[1:26:52] in and making a conversion experience in
[1:26:55] your life and that's only God can do
[1:26:57] that we can't save ourselves we can
[1:27:00] neither can we move God to change his
[1:27:03] mind and save
[1:27:07] us if you ever were saved you were saved
[1:27:10] before the foundation of the world am in
[1:27:12] Christ because Christ is the elect the
[1:27:15] one in who his his soul Delights he's
[1:27:18] the Beloved that we're accepted in
[1:27:24] so from from start to finish we have to
[1:27:26] understand that salvation is the Lord
[1:27:27] but it's God the god that makes us
[1:27:30] willing right but it's not of him that
[1:27:33] Wills not of him that willth or of him
[1:27:35] that runneth but of God that showeth
[1:27:37] Mercy oh yeah amen it's God's Sovereign
[1:27:41] choice of us it's not that God said well
[1:27:45] I like this jacob guy a little bit
[1:27:47] better and he seems like he's better
[1:27:49] actually by the eyes the eye test we're
[1:27:52] going with Esau
[1:27:55] wasn't by the eye test it was so that
[1:27:57] God the purpose of God according to
[1:27:59] election would stand Jacob have I loved
[1:28:02] and Esau have I hated and so it was
[1:28:05] God's mercy that that draws us not our
[1:28:08] own will not our own
[1:28:12] choosing but God's choosing of us
[1:28:15] musicians if you
[1:28:17] come 1 John 51 says whosoever believeth
[1:28:21] that Jesus is the Christ
[1:28:24] is born of God and everyone that loveth
[1:28:27] him that begat loveth him also that is
[1:28:31] begotten of him right there you see the
[1:28:33] picture laid out perfectly how do we
[1:28:36] know if we're born of God by spiritual
[1:28:39] revelation we believe that Jesus is the
[1:28:43] Christ amen and then he next next thing
[1:28:46] that he goes right into is love right
[1:28:50] someone that's born of God loves amen
[1:28:57] so it's it's not is it us that loved him
[1:29:01] first no it's God that loved us first
[1:29:04] amen and that's why we love
[1:29:08] him amen let's
[1:29:15] pray father

[1:40:10] know all good to go um and I went to bed
[1:40:14] in my dream and this small little about
[1:40:20] the size of a seven-year-old kid comes
[1:40:22] running across AC cross my the foot of
[1:40:24] my bed and up the side and jumps on me
[1:40:26] and grabs my throat it was a greenish
[1:40:29] grayish figure
[1:40:31] and I grabbed it and I asked Esther in
[1:40:34] the dream I said I was screaming what is
[1:40:36] this what is this and as it jumped on me
[1:40:39] it said are you ready for the
[1:40:41] comeback no I don't want none of that I
[1:40:44] you know and I couldn't I couldn't see
[1:40:47] it in my dream I couldn't tell what it
[1:40:49] was and it was just this nasty thing
[1:40:52] while I you know woke my myself up and
[1:40:55] just bothered me and I went throughout
[1:40:57] the house and just kind of claimed the
[1:41:00] name of Jesus over everything and
[1:41:01] rebuked that and everything it stood
[1:41:02] with
[1:41:03] so just let it go didn't think of
[1:41:06] anything of it really but uh Saturday
[1:41:09] night this last Saturday it was
[1:41:12] just something was just
[1:41:14] wrong something was grieving my spirit
[1:41:16] really really badly and I just kind
[1:41:19] of started thinking about that again and
[1:41:22] you know went to bed thinking
[1:41:25] whatever um well Saturday night had
[1:41:28] another dream where it was just a
[1:41:30] horrible horrible feeling
[1:41:32] of where you're watching your life kind
[1:41:35] of you're watching your life through
[1:41:38] your eyes but you're not living in your
[1:41:39] life and I had felt amazing you know
[1:41:42] being in this church and being
[1:41:43] everywhere just growing in the word and
[1:41:46] everything but I never had that moment
[1:41:47] where it was like that's where I got to
[1:41:49] make my
[1:41:50] stand um well in this dream you know a
[1:41:54] whole bunch of stuff happens and
[1:41:55] everything like that and I'm just
[1:41:56] feeling so depressed and anxious and in
[1:42:00] the dream very suicidal and stuff like
[1:42:02] that well something happens in the dream
[1:42:05] and it clicks it said are you ready for
[1:42:07] the comeback and I had dealt
[1:42:10] with you know massive depression suicide
[1:42:14] stuff that you know throughout 145 to
[1:42:18] about 19 or something like that and then
[1:42:20] got got delivered of it well when that
[1:42:23] thing said are you ready for the
[1:42:24] comeback that's what that was and I can
[1:42:26] tell now it's like I understand what
[1:42:28] Spirit I'm dealing with so I knowing
[1:42:32] what spirit I just felt total power over
[1:42:36] it and you know leave me alone leave my
[1:42:39] family alone you're done we're done
[1:42:43] so woke up again woke myself up again

[1:42:50] out
[1:42:51] and just praying and you know thanking
[1:42:55] God for it and immediately after that it
[1:42:58] was just such a heavy burden
[1:43:01] to get re-baptized and it it felt like

[1:43:05] re-baptized because that was a struggle
[1:43:07] with me you know brother Jason kind of
