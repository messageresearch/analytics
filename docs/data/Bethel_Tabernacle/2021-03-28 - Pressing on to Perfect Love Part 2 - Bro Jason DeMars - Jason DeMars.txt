look like someone i know from lima ohio so god bless you god bless him in lima ohio too brother russ and brother josiah god bless you both back there they're they're my buddies from minnesota and they're here vacationing over on fripp island so glad to have you with us and all the others as well we're gonna look in the scriptures continuing on part two pressing onto perfect love first corinthians 13 verse 4 will be our text we had a few prayer requests come in one we will pray for after the service for sister chastity writer to come up and pray for her also sister amariah some terrible pain and and went in for a uh attack on her appendix she's in the she's in the hospital now and they're just trying to determine whether they need to do surgery or not so i think the er thought that she was further along in appendicitis than than what she really is when they sent her up so we're just praying that she wouldn't have to have the surgery and that the lord would touch her and that nutrition and supplements could really take care of it rather than having to have the surgery at her age so amen want to pray for brother jason as well he's right now he's back is he back there he's not back there he's in the office still he's strong he's he's as far as the heart goes and all those issues blood pressure doing great but still with the dizziness this morning even feeling a little seasick so we want to pray for him as well so let's read our scripture by the way that tv back there is not on so i should say a monitor you can't say tv in a message church not allowed amen all right so first corinthians 13 4 through 7 and then verse 13. charity love suffereth long love is patient and is kind charity envies not charity vaunts not itself it doesn't boast is not puffed up it's not arrogant does not behave itself unseemly that means love is not rude seeks not her own in other words doesn't insist on her on its own way love is not easily provoked it's not irritable thinks no evil it's not resentful rejoice is not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity love amen heavenly father we just come to you lord and we're so thankful for your word we're so thankful lord for the revelation of that word that we're experiencing on a daily basis lord we just ask that you would come now by your by your spirit lord and work in every heart help me to just step out of the way that i would be a vessel that would speak that it would be you speaking directly to the hearts making that connection in your people lord we thank you for it lord we want to lift up brother jason our pastor even even now father would you just touch him lord take away that dizziness that he's experiencing lord we rebuke that in the name of jesus christ father we also want to pray for sister amariah lord and what she's going through lord would you just touch her lord would you just pull things back from there may she be completely healed she not need to have the surgery now lord may she walk out of that hospital feeling right and well without any problems father lord we ask that just for healing touch for everyone here lord if there's any with a need both spiritual healing or physical healing may they raise their hands to you lord and by an act of faith say healing is mine we thank you lord for that in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated i just want to go back and remind you kind of on the on the basis of what we're talking about pressing onto perfect love from the sermon adoption brother branham says thus saith the lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place for that's all there was there no matter what money how much religious demonstrations how many good deeds you've done or whatever you've done that won't count nothing on that day it'll take perfect love so whatever you do you lay aside everything else into your just so filled with the love of god till you can love those who hate you amen may it be so in us and i also want to remind you when we have the holy goat when we receive the true genuine baptism of the holy ghost that makes us subject to having perfect love amen it's not something that we work ourselves into work ourselves up to but it's him thank you brother working within us by his spirit to achieve perfect love through a vessel again it's him doing it it's not you working into it in other words we're living in the hour that perfect love is to come amen amen every other age they had the first age when paul was on the scene they had the full word they fell away from that they had partial word so what did they have had then partial love so now we have the restoration of the full word so what are we subject to perfect love what did the restoration of the word come to do in make us really knowledgeable no to bring us to that hour of maturity maturity and what what is the greatest commandment love the lord your god with all your heart all your soul all your mind and all your strength and love your neighbor as yourself you say that's way too simple we got all these mysteries all those mysteries are given so that we would be able to grow into that loving our neighbor as ourself amen in a complete and mature way amen romans 12 9 and 10. let love be without dissimulation abhor that which is evil so that first love that's agape abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affection kindly affection that's the word philosophy remember from last time four different kinds of love filio which is friendship really uh storgos family passion between husband and wife and agape which is divine love unselfish love sacrificial love so be kindly affection means is combining friendship and family amen together so what are we we're a family the body of christ is a family it's a family of friends amen one to another with be kindly affection one one to another be filo store ghost one to another with philadelphia it's so interesting to to me when you think about that word philadelphia we have a city in our country called philadelphia and the very thing they're not known for is brotherly love isn't that astounding that's just the way the devil works he takes a place that's named after a christian virtue and turns it into a complete opposite perversion of that be philosophers one to another with philadelphia in honor preferring one another so really let love agape so we have all these things really are combined within us none of them are like well this is lower than this and we know divine love agape love is the highest but when we have agape love the other ones get covered too you can't just say i have agape love but not have filio love right right it's not going to work that way they're not separate different things one flows out of the other filial love should flow out of agape now you can have filial love without having agape you can have a friendship but the friendship is not based on self-sacrifice of divine love right the whole world is full of people that have friendship love the pharisees would felio one another you scratch my back all scratch yours that kind of friendship but agape is if you slap me in the face i'll scratch your back that's real friendship that's real filio love so again um we talked about before the different kinds of love let's get past that first thessalonians 4 9 and 10. so filio the literal meaning of that means to be a friend to filio comes from the word philos which means friend all right so philadelphia again that's the act of loving as a friend it's translated as brotherly love that's true but it's it's looking at the the looking at it in the sense of a friendship not in the sense of a blood family right and so i i i've said this before but i want you to understand filio is a lesser love than agape but we can't say well i want agape and just pass by filio we can't pass by friendship you say well i i love i love those people now there's an aspect where you can you're supposed to agape your enemy right that doesn't mean you have a friendship with them right it doesn't mean you have a friendship but you're too agape you're supposed to agape them regardless of relationship right but then there's that filial love which we are to have to one another as christians because why because the holy ghost teaches us to agape one another amen all right first thessalonians 4 9 and 10 but as touching philadelphia brotherly love you need not that i write unto you for you yourselves are taught of god to agape one another amen he doesn't need to write them about philadelphia filial love because their the holy ghost is teaching them agape so that's why i'm saying when you have agape filio is going to be covered by that for one another friendship when you have agape love you're going to behave like a real scriptural friend to someone and indeed you do it toward all the brethren which are in all macedonia but we beseech you brethren that you increase more and more so we have the holy ghost we have love love within us but we have to grow more in agape love you have it god's teaching you yeah but you got to grow you gotta you gotta get more mature you gotta you've gotta increase in this love you can't just say well i got the holy ghost i don't need anything else no you have the holy ghost and it's time to grow it's time to increase in love it's easy to love when people are nice and agreeable to us and it's easy to talk about it when it's just this is our church these are people and everyone is at a distance from you but when you have fellowship with one another when you see really what people are like sometimes you struggle to love them why why why do we why do we struggle with that why why is it it's it's immaturity it's what it is and all of in me you know you might be mature in one area but immature in another area right that's com that's common for all of us my blind spot is not travis's blind spot they're different and so we need to in some areas some areas others need to increase other areas others need to increase but one area we all need to increase in is love i can promise that all areas i want to increase in all areas i never want to shut god off from working in my life because once we say well i've arrived we're saying we're putting up a big brick wall and saying god i don't need you that's not the right attitude saying i'm still here so that means that there's more for me to grow into that's exactly what brother branham taught us over and over and over and over again we need to increase more and more we need to have our hearts knit together in unity more and more colossians 2 1-2 i just wanted to mention to everyone the i haven't been involved with the senior youth um brother matt is involved in other other the other brother matt is involved too and and different ones are reaching out pray for the senior youth there is a move of the holy spirit happening in the senior youth i'm really excited about it and just just i want everyone let's bond together and pray because there's a real it's going to start a lot of times revival it starts with young people and then it carries over to us so let it start in the young people and carry over to us old fogies amen colossians 2 1-2 for i would that you knew what great conflict i have for you and for them at laodicea and as for many for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh that their hearts might be comforted look at this being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god and of the father and of christ i love that knit together in love knit together it speaks of how our bodies are joined together with joints and tendons and all of those things he's saying what's going to knit us together theology doctrine well we need those things we can't have spiritual health without good solid scriptural doctrine amen but what nits us together is agape love we want to be knit together with that love so that we can walk then in unity because part of what the body of christ is to experience in this day is the unity of the faith the unity of the revelation of the word right but it's it's it's beyond just having the same revelation it's having the same heart it's having being one mind of one accord that doesn't mean no mind that means one mind we have a unity in our heart and how are we going to get it by being knit together in perfect agape love all right so i want to take some time looking more at filio looking more at friendship again it's not a lower love it's not a weaker love it's not a a bad love it's just speaking about love in a different way the only way that this feeling friendship is completed isn't a christian that has the holy ghost and has agape love living in them because otherwise i'm just waiting to see uh did travis well he invited me over by it's my turn to invite him how many times did okay all right i gotta i gotta catch up oh my goodness that's not agape love that's feeli that's only merely filial love that's what the world does we gotta we've got to give back what we've been given whether whatever whatever that might be good bad or ugly but agape love says it doesn't really matter what they do that's how real friendship happens when everybody says it doesn't really matter what they do how they do but i love them anyways because they're a son of god a daughter of god and they have a need and i'm looking beyond mere flesh life and i'm looking to that soul that's in connection with christ that soul is worth ten thousand worlds even that is an understatement it's way more than that in god's eyes it's infinite value why is it have infinite value because he came in the form of his son to die on the cross so that soul would be saved so what kind of value should we place on one another amen lord help us to increase more and more the christian ethic is not selfish it's not let every man seek his own good that's what the world does that's what our carnal nature teaches us to do brother michael sent me a text last week that was so so good he was talking about it was talking about satanism and how in in the satanic bible they have this approach where everything is natural we think of it everything is maybe it's supernatural everything is just natural appealing to the flesh of man their idea is do unto others as they do to you that's the world's pattern and program if they're evil to you pay it back if they're good to you pay it back well real brother branham says the greatest power that we have greatest weapon that's been given to us is love so if we want to fight the devil how would we do it take up take up the sword of the spirit but we also take up what love love our enemies when we do unto others as we would have them do unto us it's actually we're taking a part in a spiritual battle by the holy spirit we are engaging in warfare against the world we're saying no satan i'm not following your ways no satan i'm not engaging in the warfare that you want me to be work with you i'm working with jesus christ and that means when this person curses me i will bless them and when we do that we actually fight that real warfare that takes place brother branham talks about that um frequently but he talks about that and he he's advising different the husband where he's his wife starts talking against the service i suppose he spoke in tongues and rolled on the floor and he said i just the husband was like i just started rebuking that devil satan i cast you out get up he's like brother branham we're going to get a divorce he's like sure sure you are that's that's completely the wrong way to do it when she does that so oh honey that's all right that's all right and do be kind to her treat her nice and he comes back later and says brother branham our the home is revolutionized so i told he said how what do you think is going to win the battle fussing and fighting no it's love and so that's that's so important for us to understand our battle is not with flesh and blood when somebody does you wrong when somebody speaks against you when somebody lies about you it might even be a good believer right it might be a good believer that's hurt you say that's all right they didn't mean that isn't that what jesus did brother branham told us they didn't mean that and don't spread it around don't talk about it pray for him right away why do we do that again it goes back to what we're we were saying satan's tactics are repay the person for what they did to you good or bad but god's tactic is when they do not do not be overcome by evil how are you overcome by evil by engaging in evil for evil contrary wise repay evil with good isn't that beautiful i always remember that little children's song my uh my little one kid one person was talking about worldly things and so forth and my my little nephew at the time he was little started singing do not be do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good and the guy was just like okay well i'm sufficiently rebuked he didn't even know what he was doing but it was the spirit of the lord correcting that man let every man seek not his own good but the good of others this is what we as believers have to be engaged in this has to be our focus okay that doesn't mean we don't provide for our family you know all these things together in balance if you don't provide for your family are you seeking the good of your family no no if you want to excel in your job you do it for the glory of god and to do what to help other people to be a blessing to other people if you want to make more money don't do it for selfish ambition do it so that you can give more and be more of a blessing and to be a channel so it doesn't mean that you're not supposed to ask for a raise at the job you're supposed to you should not for yourself for other people don't seek your own good but the good of others that also means your family sometimes we lose track of that we're supposed to seek the good of our family and then the good of others we're supposed to love one another fervently when we're also supposed to love the world love the people in the world amen so it all of these things there's a scriptural balance in all of it and we can't get out of whack with that when we get out of whack that's when we bring hurt hurt to our family hurt to those around us you also can go in the other direction be so focused on your family that you have no time to serve the people around you no time to love the people around you because your whole soul focus is just all i do is spend time on my family and i i don't focus on how i can be a blessing outside of that so again all of that has to be taken into consideration how do we balance it out jason i don't have an equation but i have a person that's the holy ghost the holy ghost will balance you out amen and all of these things and he'll correct you on one side and he'll correct you on the other side that's what we have to have all right so just like nature what hap what happens what would happen to this facility here if we just stopped maintaining it all together didn't cut the grass didn't trim the trees didn't trim the bushes didn't clean what would happen over time nature would reclaim it it would be wild what happens to friendships and relationships when we don't tend to them when we don't take time for them they get wild they go they go like this they go far apart their distance past hurts how many have had hurts if you don't raise your hand you're lying we have all had past hurts we've all had past frustrations from churches from family from best friends betrayals the list goes on remember that christ had it too he already experienced that too and it didn't stop him from doing what god wanted him to do no matter how bad it hurt he was first smite the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered his closest friends have completely abandoned him one of his inner circle his closest group of friends peter did what denied he even knew him that's crucial [Music] that is unbelievable imagine imagine if your best friend came i don't know i don't even know who that is wow that's betray that's real betrayal so don't think that christ doesn't know he's a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities the worst betrayal you can imagine he's experienced it yeah and guess what it never stopped him or derailed him from following god's plan and it can't do that for us does it hurt does it make us nervous does it make us upset does it make us frustrated yep should it stop us from doing what god wants us to do do not let it do that that's what satan wants sometimes whereas the worst wounds that christ got in the house of his friends sometimes god allows people that we respect that we know are real believers that we know have an experience with god to lash out and hurt us what do we do how do we respond what what should we do it's simple it's simple love them we sh it shouldn't change our love paul said even though you i'll gladly spend and be spent for you even though you love me less i will love you more amen okay that's contrary to what i'm feeling on the inside well let the holy spirit take away that feeling pray ask the lord to help you because we're all subject we're all subject to like passions like elijah was we're all subject to those feelings but we're not supposed to give in to those feelings because we have the holy spirit within us that gives us power to overcome human reactions and feelings amen john 15 15. henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but i've called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you isn't that beautiful i don't call you servants anymore i'm calling you my friends what is the definition of friendship jesus all things i've heard of my father i made an own unto you what that's ultimate friendship what do we have with jesus christ ultimate friendship it's we can bear all of our burdens all of our struggles all of our trials we can expose ourselves completely to him and he will expose himself completely his heart to us and that's really what changes us and think about that in the realm of us to one another what does that mean it's opening up your heart and your secrets to another person you say i don't know if i want to do that well it is carry risk with it it carried great risk to it with jesus christ but when two hearts are connected together there's a real love that flows forth we'll talk we'll read that scripture later about jonathan and david and how god worked through that but a real biblical friendship is opening up our hearts to one another that's a real biblical friendship and praying for one another and correcting each other when we need correction with love and encouraging one another building each other up it demands loyalty and it also demands trustworthiness it demands continually fighting the spirit of gossip you've all experienced the spirit of gossip we all of us without exception and the spirit of gossip we want to tell something and it brings a satisfaction to the flesh because you've shared some secret information with other people but what does that do does that build someone up 99.9 of the time it doesn't it it it damages friendships it it it brings hurt because because that person was trusting you to be honest and to not share things so we have to fight that spirit of god gossip and again it opens us to the possibility of being hurt and to having our trust broken but it should not that this should not stop us that should not prevent us because it exposed jesus christ to the same thing it didn't stop him he made himself transparent to us and for us and what did it get him amen he was killed he was executed for it it didn't stop him [Music] that's the kind of friendship that god wants us to have with one another you say that's difficult that's hard yes absolutely it is but it's real friendship and it's transforming friendship we look at ministry for example we're all we talked about in sunday school we're all called we're we're a royal priesthood we're all called to have a ministry a service to one another right and we look at that well i have to have a degree in counseling people and i've got to be able to that's just friendship that's just listening that's just caring that's just trying to understand the person's heart sometimes i've seen it all over the place on the missions field here everywhere a person says i need counseling they come and they talk and they talk and they talk and they talk and i all don't even say anything and at the end they say thank you for ministering to me you're welcome you're welcome i didn't do anything they just needed to get it off their chest that's okay they trusted me to do that now what do i do next pray for him keep my mouth quiet that's friendship it's not really complicated we want to make counsel there's a counseling session there was this and i told him that's just the holy spirit in you loving the person pointing them to the scripture it's really not complicated it's for all of us to be a part of spiritual gifts are for the whole body of christ not just for the preacher amen the true servant the heart of a true servant says i will lay down my life for my brothers and sisters we're ready to do maybe we're ready to do that as far as like physically but what about spiritually what about emotionally what about on a daily basis not the it's not the big confrontation but it's the things of just caring for each other just following up saying you know he was having a hard time how are you doing today you know just showing a little bit of concern and care for people go go such a far away to heal hurts and sometimes people are so broken you feel like i can't open myself up to anyone and even when i'm talking right now maybe you have such a such a wall in front of you you're like you're almost not even hearing what i'm saying because it's it's such a scary thing to even talk about um the lord wants to heal you the lord wants to heal that he doesn't want you to be in that condition where you have a wall around your heart amen they say it's too dangerous i can't trust people i'm not asking you to trust people i'm asking you to trust the lord trust the lord that he has your best in mind and ask the lord to heal you but beyond that ask the lord to send a real friend to you that would listen and would care because many times more times often than not that is what brings healing to people just an individual that says i care enough to close my mouth my one mouth and use my two ears to listen to what's being said and and and not i don't have to fix whatever the problem is i just have to care and then after that after i listen and after i understood i can really help someone and the bible puts a great deal of value upon that kind of friendship we mentioned before david and jonathan first samuel 18 verse 1 and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto saul that the soul of jonathan was knit with the soul of david and jonathan loved him as his own soul what was happening here david was testifying and saying i can i can kill this goliath i can i can come against him because he god helped me with the bear so god can do it with this uncircumcised philistine jonathan saw that and immediately that's my that that is me that is me we are one here in our faith in god and they loved each other as their own very own soul and then we go on and see what great length that jonathan went to protect and be a real friend i mean he stuck his neck out with his own father he knew his father was unjust and what he was doing towards david so he was willing to sacrifice everything knowing knowing it wasn't a mystery knowing that david was anointed to be the next king jonathan said i know i'm supposed to be in the monarchy and i'll be the next one that comes up but i'm going to sacrifice everything for david who's going to take my place now that is love amen that is real love philemon 1 10 through 12. i'll just read it real quick i appealed to you from my child onesimus whose father i became in my imprisonment formerly he was useless to you but now he is indeed useful to you and to me i am sending him back to you sending my very heart isn't that beautiful what a friendship that paul had developed with philemon there in rome he said he could say this is this man is my very heart think about that proverbs 17 verse 17. a friend loveth at all times and a brother is born for adversity a real friend loves at all times why does it say loves at all times because there's lots of ups and downs in life in friendship hey has anyone ever had a really close friend and something happened and you misunderstood what happened and you thought that they were upset with you or they were distancing themselves from you you ever had that happen did it make you stop loving that person i hope not i hope not many times you you go and talk to that person and what happens completely had no you completely misunderstood the situation just talk just talk to each other just communicate that's part of being a real friend friend loves at all times don't misconstrue the behavior of another person based on your own opinion get it out of their own mouth get it out of their own mouth i think that's a wonderful wonderful thing that we have to do for one another a friend loves you when you have no money and a friend loves you when you have a little bit of money and a friend loves you when you have lots of money he always loves you that it that should not change love i mean we live in a world where people will see oh it's a rich guy man i love him man i want to be close to him and then the request comes it's not real friendship friend loves that person don't matter what their situation is in life is uh job 19 verse 14. job came to this place where he realized his friends weren't his friends my kins folk have failed and my familiar friends have forgotten me when job was prosperous oh man job's a good guy he's the best guy around he throws the best parties and he has he has the best the funnest things to do at his home but then he lost everything and what happened i abandoned him that's not real friendship a real friend loves at all times brother branham in lifting him up out of history in 1958 says seems like that real family love doesn't exist anymore just something has happened home life is running out we don't have the old american home as we used to have it long years ago there's another thing that i would like to say is another thing that is running out is friendship is running out it don't seem like we have the friends that we used to have and the friends that we have are not loyal friends like used to be it used to be i can remember when someone got sick in the neighborhood that everybody come around and they helped with all help them with all their work and landed a hand anything could be done set up with them all night at a time as i've often said it's truth that we hardly know the neighbor is dead until we see it in the paper so brother branham speaks about friendship and he speaks about loyalty service and sacrifice amen i i really like that how he brought that out loyalty it's not there's not the loyalty of friendship they go over and they lend a hand and they get their work done that's sacrifice because you got your own work to get done at your home and you go and help them with their work loyalty service sacrifice proverbs 27 verse 10. thine own friend and thy father's friend forsake not neither go into thy brother's house in the day of calamity for better as a neighbor that is near than a brother that is far off so i want to kind of leave that last part alone or that verse but the main thing i want to look at is do not leave forsake or desert your friend the bible commands it did you realize that don't forsake your friend amen that's a commandment from scripture now okay let's let's look at the bigger picture let's look at a big picture here young people what kind of friends do you have the bible says not to be unequally yoked together with unbelievers so it's not talking about it's it's it's talking about a real friend it's not talking about a fake friend it's talking not talking about the wrong kind of friends again we're not to be unequally yoked does that mean i can't have a friend that's an unbeliever it doesn't mean that but it means you can't be unequally yoked with them what does that mean let me break it down when i got saved i had a lot of friends around me what did they like to do the things that i liked to do before i got saved which were bad habits bad things so what was the norm of my relationship we were in a yoke together doing the same things together i got saved and i was like oh these are my buddies i'll continue to hang out with them what happened when i wasn't fully sanctified yet i started to do what drink say words that i didn't want to say do things i didn't want to do what was the result conviction frustration upset what did i do lord help me lord help me and then what did i do the next day hung out with those friends again and the lord's saying i can't help you you got to do something yourself here so i remember speaking about this to my my brother-in-law and we went to uh we went to the church and on a saturday night and the minister started speaking about being unequally yoked together with unbelievers and he was saying you know you got you get saved and you're continuing on the same behavior as you were before you're saved because your friends are dragging you into the same behaviors well he said here's here's the step to not be unequally yoked go to your friends and say ah christ has changed my life i don't want to live that way anymore i don't want to smoke marijuana i don't want to party i don't want to cuss i don't want to listen to that music i don't want to go to the dance club i don't want to just list off whatever it is that you don't want to have in your life and then say i want you to help me live a godly life strange thing to say but understand i want you to help me make the choices that you know i want to make if you don't want to be friends anymore that's fine that's your choice i want to be your friend but i cannot go and do those things anymore and be specific help me not do them if we can if you want to do that we can continue to continue being friends if you don't want to do that we'll just shake hands give a hug and part our ways so i did that all my friends said oh yeah of course i want to be your friend of course i want to still be with you only one friend continued with me after that that's okay that's okay because one person decided i want to be a true friend i want to help him with what he wants help with the rest of them left me behind but what happens it gives you an opportunity to witness and it changes you from being yoked together it takes the yolk and it goes boom breaks it into pieces on the floor why because now you're the one influencing them not them influencing you on an equal level you've broken that yoke continue to be friends you're just not going to do the things that you used to do you can get together you can talk but what are you going to probably talk about different things you're going to talk about the lord you're going to pray for them you're going to talk about what god is doing in your life you're going to talk about what you're learning from the from the word of god amen you're not going to continue to go back to what it was before right well you have to you have to decide to do that you have to make the steps to do that so when we're saying forsake not your friend we mean a real friend a real friend that wants you to live a godly life that wants to help you get closer to christ that's a real friend uh james 1 verse 19. i'll just read it real quick no my beloved brothers let every person be quick to hear slow to speak slow to wrath or slow to anger we spoke about that before be fast to hear listen quickly don't speak quickly listen quickly and after you've listened then be slow to speak and slow to anger that's that's a real quality of friendship job 6 verse 14. to him that is afflicted pity should be showed from his friend but he forsaketh the fear of the almighty so let me let me break that down a little bit basically what's being said is he who withholds kindness from a friend is forsaking the fear of the almighty wow if there is someone that needs a kindness done to them and you look and say god bless you and don't do anything about it you're not fearing god anymore you're not reverencing god right john speaks about that in his epistle if you you basically say god bless you and shut up your bowels of confession and do nothing for them how is the love of god dwelling in you true love a true friend does what helps the one who's in need reaches out doesn't just i don't have time for that do you fear god then you should have time for it amen proverbs 27 verse nine in other words how we treat others is a direct reflection of how we feel about god amen right if we see someone in need don't do anything it shows your feeling is very weak for god ointment and perfume rejoice the heart sowed out the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel hold that in your mind then go back to verse six faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful so a friend is someone you can turn to for advice they understand you they care for you they can help with encouragement or loving rebuke faithful are the wounds of a friend that's speaking about a friend who tells you the truth when you're doing the wrong thing thinking the wrong thing they speak the truth to you that's a real friend that's right but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful in other words it's talking about correction versus flattery we are supposed to encourage one another we're supposed to build each other up we're supposed to recognize when someone does something that's a blessing that's helpful we're not supposed to not do that we are we're supposed to reach out thank you for doing that we enjoyed that or we appreciated that we enjoyed that special thank you for we're supposed to appreciate one another but if it's just flattering flattering flattering then you're just waiting for what's next what's next it's not a real it's not a real a real friendship will build you up and also give you a wound what does it mean give you a wound correction yeah say that's not right you shouldn't you shouldn't you shouldn't be thinking that way or you shouldn't be acting that way or shouldn't be talking that way you shouldn't have done that and the person will will say yeah thank you you're right that hurts ouch it's a wound but it's it's a faithful wound amen because it's meant to help you get closer to christ that's a real friend and again i know religious spirits can latch onto that thing only and say love is corrective and therefore they go around to everyone judging and beating them up with their words and say oh i i have real love for you i'm telling you the truth no you're just ornery you're just mean rude disrespectful etc no it's not that's not it it's there's a heart of compassion when the correction comes when there's a heart of compassion and the words of correction come the person hearing it might not love it but they're not going to say that person hates me no they're going to feel that there's love there proverbs 17 verse 9 he that covereth a transgression seeks love but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends love covers a multitude of sins is how the new testament writers refer to this aren't we supposed to expose the unfruitful works of darkness so how do we how do we grab this verse and that verse and go in the right direction here jesus very clearly makes that known matthew 17 i believe it is and he says when your brother is in a fault go to him directly speak to him if he doesn't receive it get someone else preferably someone that's a witness bring them with and confront him they don't receive that then tell it to the church and if they don't receive it then then treat them like a tax collector or a sinner that's what you run from a tax collector right so again love covers a multitude of sins as soon as we find out about someone usually this is what happens you find out about what so so-and-so did through the grapevine and then you want to blast it out on facebook or on whatever it is it's not love that's stupidity ignorance and hatred the real response would be either say ignore it or say i heard this i'm going directly to the person that's the real loving response but unfortunately it's way easier to do the other thing love cover it covers a multitude of sins i hope you understand it a little bit better now love seized someone else and not only that but you might see someone and say my goodness why are they doing that that's just wrong so what's the response what's the reaction to tell everybo you know so-and-so is doing such and such no it should be let's pray for them i'm going to pray for them in secret to see what the lord would work in their life you don't have to you don't have to run and act upon every judgment that you make a lot of times your judgment's wrong we're human we're in flesh we might have or we might it might be partially right and so the the best response when we see things to do is say lord help them lord help me to know what to do how many times any of you have experienced this that you saw something and you're like oh i got to do something and then the lord says did you pray and then you pray and then what the lord says to do nothing just keep praying and then you watch and see my goodness god is changing that god want that that's the priesthood of all believers [Music] not sometimes we do have to talk to them i'm not saying we don't but i'm saying god knows the answer to that question you might want to ask him first proverbs 16 28. a dishonest man a forward man a dishonest man sows or spreads strife and a whisper whisperer separates chief friends or close friends do we want to be sowers of strife are sowers of the word do we want to be peacemakers or separators these things are so really simple i sometimes i feel like my goodness what there's all these wonderful things to preach about in the message and here i am preaching on this simple thing why am i preaching on this simple thing i don't think we're doing it very well we're not doing it as well as we need to i'm not doing it as well as i need to and we get caught up in all the mysteries and we leave off the very very simple things of christianity i love the mysteries i mean you're not you should understand you know me i lo i love them i would really like to be preaching on them right now but that's not what god asked me to speak about these are simple things but it shows our maturity or our lack of maturity and you can't say i've got a great understanding of the message and be immature in your character that's not right that's not what the message came to produce we are not to be a bunch of babies with a lot of head knowledge imagine imagine a little newborn baby carrying around a steak and trying to chomp on it it doesn't make any sense go back and if you're if if you're acting like a baby then go back and drink milk and build up your way into strong meat that's what we have to do friendship is and can be destroyed by gossip i can't emphasize that enough because it's really really easy because our flesh loves to share secret news somehow it's it's wired into us but in the wrong way in the wrong way why because of the fall because of sin we still have a sin nature in this flesh and it likes to tell secrets and you know you sit sometimes and people will jokingly say oh they're over there i'm over there with the sisters gossiping why is that funny it's not funny it's not scriptural it's just it's sinful it's it's sinful like other like other sins that we look down on and hate and rightfully so but why don't we look down on gossip because it's because we do it we do it because it's easy for us to do and we have to guard against the spirit of gossip it is this evil spirit it is a it is a person it is a demon yeah there and there's many demons that are named gossip and they're working everywhere around the world to spread it and bring that satisfaction into your heart to gossip but it's not the spirit of christ it's the enemy of christ love covers hatred spreads strife think about that for a minute let your first reaction as a christian be i heard this news love covers a multitude of sins and then pray and ask what the next step is but let it be your first reaction love covers a multitude not spreading strife john 15 12 and 13. this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends we are to love one another just like christ loved the church you say that's the scripture for husbands and wives absolutely you're absolutely right at the same time it's this scripture that we just read right there love one another as i have loved you we are to love each other like christ love the church in other words we're supposed to sacrifice ourselves for the blessing and building up of others we don't we don't live for ourselves we cannot live for ourselves if you live here for yourself you'll die eternal life is what living for others hebrews 3 13. but exhort one another daily exhort one another daily every day we should exhort each other while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin have you ever stopped to think about what that verse is saying for a second so we can be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin we're christians we're filled with the holy ghost and we can be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin what's god's antidote to that exhort one another daily amen that's impo that's pretty important right if if we can be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin then we need to do what exhort one another encourage each other build each other up send a send a thought pray for someone and let them know you're praying for them build one another up connect with each other let's look at some characteristics of true friendship put christ first in your heart and in everything opening up to opening up the secrets of each other's hearts connecting two hearts together loyalty you enter into the troubles of your friend and help them a friend listens and understands you not just at a surface level but at a deep level a real friend gives godly advice or correction pointing his friend back to the truth of god's word a true friend keeps private conversations private doesn't gossip a true friend lays down his life for his friend a true friend exhorts daily a true friend helps bear your burdens amen part of our service to christ is making and keeping friends think about that for a minute part of our service to the lord jesus christ is making some of you might have that down and keeping friends some of you might have that down it's both of those things people need a friend people are dying for a friend someone that would love them and care for them unconditionally not on conditions of you like what i like you might like something that i have no time for that shouldn't change anything we might be completely different we might be from different nations different skin color that should make no difference that makes no difference that's true friendship is part of our service to christ not again it's not in the worldly sense we do activities together we go do this we go do that we might do that that's fine but in a biblical sense as we do life together sure we do fun things together too but in a greater sense it's you because we come the burden bearers for each other lifting one another up in prayer and bringing healing and happiness and joy to one another and again that can't be hap that can't happen i've said this before and bears repeating that can't happen when i'm waiting for so and so to meet this need right when you go through this and you say oh i look no no one's a true friend to me don't look outward look on the inside are you a true friend to someone else you're not going to answer i will not answer for what caleb does i'm not going to i'm not going to answer for what brother jason does i'm going to answer for what this brother jason does right and so it isn't about so-and-so hasn't met my need so what it's nothing to do with anything yeah yeah that's literally has nothing to do with anything and if you're thinking along those lines that's the enemy the enemy wants you to look at other people well they haven't fulfilled their duty so so you are to fulfill your duty before god whether anyone does it to you or not that is the only way that there could be a true friendship otherwise it's a fake friendship if you're ju again it's 50 50 it's waiting for them to do what i want them to do and then i'll respond in kind that is not friendship that's not godly love i don't even know what it is it's just doing fun activities together that's not a friendship that's what the world calls a friendship it's not what god calls a friendship if christ if in christ he wants us to be other focused not self-focused again the thinking that says other people haven't done da da da da that's me that's me me me me it isn't about you amen it's not about your needs it christ has met your needs and your portion is to be christ psalm 63 our satisfaction completely has to be in christ then when our satisfaction is completely in christ we can be true friends outside of that it's false we are not to be self-centered we're not looking for our own pleasure that other people can afford to us there's nothing wrong with having a friend that you enjoy being around i'm not saying that but the purpose of friendship is not merely enjoying one another the purpose of friendship is christ in you reaching out to others proverbs 18 24 a man that has friends must show himself friendly amen and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother so if you want a friend you have to be a person that is friendly to others it starts with you say i don't have any friends i don't everybody i'm close to starts with you don't wait for another person to meet your need christ is already meeting your needs look to christ and then say lord i want to be a friend to other people that's the road to satisfaction the road to satisfaction is not why i go to church or this church they just don't have any love nobody's reaching out to me okay sorry that's your experience but reach out to someone and you'll find a hand reaching out to you amen again again our purpose is not to be self-serving it's to serve others if you want friends then reach out to others and do things that are friendly i don't want to have to go into that but invite someone to your house go meet them for coffee text them to go rent a boat together to go fishing and fellowship about the lord the list goes on and on and on and on it's not complicated it's really simple stuff but it's things that we have to we we have to look inside of ourselves and say okay how can i reach out not how i'm waiting for everybody to reach out to me no i want to reach out and be a help and a blessing to others and in turn you'll find that you're the one that's the most blessed amen why because you're pouring yourself out for other people and what happens when you do that you get the blessing from god amen we have to take the initiative we have to do things that friends would do simple things visit them if there's if they're sick right now you probably can't go to the hospital and visit people unless they're your immediate family but just reach out do it it's really simple things let god into your schedule let god into your time let let god dictate those things for you so that you can be available for him to use you to be a friend to other people that's not a low-level spiritual thing to say you can be a friend to someone that's a high-level thing that's a big deal that's what sons and daughters of god do they're friends for other to other people musicians if you'd come demanding friendship is sitting alone with a frustrated look not what you're doing when you're doing that you're doing the opposite of what you want you're you're not attracting people to you you're not welcoming people to you but with your in your heart and with your expectations you're pushing them away you're holding them accountable for being friendly to you when you'll be held accountable for not being friendly to others again i've i've seen it over and over again with people they leave a church the people are not loving they didn't do this they didn't do that they didn't do that guess what every word that they're saying is pointing back right at themselves they never did any of that they were just waiting for someone else to do it what is it that's a lot of times what it is it's a person who really needs healing it's a person that's broken it's a person that's hurting and when you see those signs of crossed arms and man look and say don't say look at that ordinary guy say look at that broken individual lord help me to be the hand of healing for that person they're hurting they're struggling but don't but don't the best thing is you if you're in that condition go to go to the lord and ask him to help you and send someone that would be a means of healing he wants to use friendship as a means of healing people that's not very spiritual we want to have a prayer line [Music] okay let's have a prayer line but i'll pray that the lord will anoint you to be a real friend to bring healing supernatural healing in the lives of those who are hurting that's what friendship is very important if christ says i'm your friend what does he bring to you he brings healing salvation transformation satisfaction of heart what are you supposed to be as a friend you're supposed to be that christ in you doing that through you to others amen let's stand up and pray [Music] heavenly father we're so so thankful for your word lord i pray lord that you just go down and search every heart lord that you bring bring healing and strength to every heart let us each one have the attitude of christ the heart of christ to reach out to others when they're unfriendly
