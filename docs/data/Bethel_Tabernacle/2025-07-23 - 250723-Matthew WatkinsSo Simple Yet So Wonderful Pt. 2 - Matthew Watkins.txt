Because God is good. We aren't always, but he always is good. Amen. Praise the Lord. If you have your Bible, turn to the book of Matthew, chapter 20. Amen. Thank you for all that worship. Brother Ken and then Matthew chapter 20. We'll just begin reading the first verse. For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, which went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard. And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, and said unto them, "Go you also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right, I will give you." and they went their way. Again he went out about the sixth hour and 9th hour and did likewise. And about the 11th hour he went out and found others standing idle and said unto them, Why stand you here all the day idle? They said unto him, because no man hath hired us, he said unto them, Go you also into the vineyard, for whatsoever is right, that shall you receive. So when evening was come, the Lord of the vineyard said unto his steward, Call the laborers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. And when they came that were hired about the 11th hour, they received every man a penny. But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more, and they likewise received every man a penny. And when they had received it, they murmured against the good man of the house, saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden of the heat of the day. But he answered one of them, and said, friend, I do thee no wrong. Did thou didst not thou agree with me for a penny? Take that thine is, and go thy way. I will give unto this last even as unto thee. &gt;&gt; It is Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil because I am good? So the last shall be first and the first last. For many be called, but few be chosen. Acts chapter 2. Just before you're seated, I'll just read our text from last Wednesday as we're going to be carrying that same burden from last Wednesday. So simple yet so wonderful. Aren't you glad things are so simple? &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were seated sitting. There appeared unto them cloven tongues of like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and begin to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we thank you for the reading of your word tonight. How we need Lord you to come now Jesus. We're just depending upon you wholly and completely. I pray Lord God that you would just make your self Lord comfortable and welcome amongst us Lord to move freely Lord and have liberty Jesus I pray Lord and the words that I speak may they not just be the words of my own thoughts Lord or things Lord that I would ponder Lord but may they be Lord divine words of inspiration God touching Lord not just the humanity of emotion Lord or the humanity of knowledge or reasoning of a of a mind, Lord, but may they go further and go down to the very soul, Lord, to bring a transformation. We ask it now, Lord God. We just ask you to come and be our help. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You can be seated. Like to carry on from last Wednesday from where we left off. So simple yet so wonderful. I'll just read that slide from the first one. If you have that, you can just display it. As brother Brandham says this in the Ephesian church age, as like begets like, the true church will always be the one that tries to follow in the steps of her founders at Pentecost. &gt;&gt; And her messengers will follow the Apostle Paul, the first messenger to the first church age. It is that simple and that wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh just to start here just for a moment. I'm just going to uh take just some time to just lay a foundation as the Lord would just help me tonight. Um want to just be faithful again to what he's laid upon our heart. And I just want to say a few things and that is that the truth has always been simple. In fact, it's brother Brandham who would preach a message right before the opening of the seven seals called God hiding himself in simplicity. And brother Brandham says in that message that God hides himself in simplicity. It's his title. And he also reveals himself in the same. Right? So he not just hides himself, but he also uh he also reveals himself in the same. So it's simplicity often that can offend restlessness. I'll say that again. It's simplicity sometimes that can offend restlessness. You see, restlessness is a result of impatience. And impatience is something that we all deal with. Everyone in this building &gt;&gt; deals with impatience. &gt;&gt; And it doesn't matter what category it is in your own life. You can from a very natural perspective be an impatient person. Think of just how the age that we live in uh today of the impatience that we see with people. And if we're not careful, we and we be honest, you know, friends, sometimes that impatience can even affect us to where we become impatient with others, impatient with ourselves, impatient with our children. Amen. &gt;&gt; Impatient with our families, &gt;&gt; and impatient with life. Many times this restlessness that we feel is because we've lost our the the the sense of the simplicity. I know this is simple but it's for a no pun intended. It's for a purpose. I'm preaching on simplicity because it's so simple. But often times that restlessness comes because we've lost touch with the simplicity of life &gt;&gt; or divine life. You see, life is not simple at all. Life is very complex. The life that you live in is a very complicated one from a human from a very natural humanistic way. Thank you, brother Aaron. I did start my timer. Don't get scared on my computer. I'm not just starting it right now. Amen. Praise the Lord. But life is can become very complex. And we know that that it would be the desire of the enemy. It would be the devil that would try to bring complication and use that the the the the complexity of life to take something that God intended to be simple. He intended to be easy. He intended to be uh uh for the uneducated. He didn't intend for it to be way out of reach or way out of your grasp. But the things of God, God made them simple to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even the mystery of God in this generation has been fully unveiled. And it is not the desire of God to take that mystery that's been simplified and make it complex to the layman unreachable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's simplicity as I said that often offends uh restlessness that a a simplicity that offends the restlessness and the impatience. And we become impatient in life, impatient with our progress, impatient with how where we're at. And that the devil will use this impatience in our fallen nature to even bring stress. He'll use it to bring anxiety. He'll use it to bring depression. Many people find themselves unhappy or unsatisfied or not content with where they are. when that discontentment and that unsatisfaction never came from the Lord, but it actually comes from the enemy using your imagination to make you think you're not where you should be. Your life isn't as far along as it should be. You'd be somewhere else had you done something different. And the devil uses all of this to cloud the simplicity that God has called us to in this generation. that that that that life the way that God looks at life is very simple. &gt;&gt; I'll give you the words of the Bible. What has he required of you, oh man? To love God, to assu to assue evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to seek peace. Now, that's very simple. What is it that he requires of us? Education. God doesn't require that at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Great financial gain. God doesn't require that of us at all. In fact, what God requires of us is so simple that it could be summed up in just what Jesus said. I am the vine. You are the branches. &gt;&gt; And you cannot bear fruit within yourself. Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you've got to yield to the vine. Yield to the husbandman of the vine and let the Lord produce the fruit out of your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; We can become weary as I to say even with the Lord we can grow impatient. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And people can become weary throughout generations. We can see examples of this. I can give you many in the Bible, many different examples of impatience. It was actually Moses when he delayed from coming down from the mountain that the people, the Bible says, got impatient uh waiting on the voice of the Lord. And so rather than waiting on the voice of the Lord, they just made up their own God. They made up their own golden calf and and they took gold, which was a blessing that God had actually given them when they left Egypt, and used it to craft a false image, and call it called it the God who brought them out of Egypt. Go read it. It's in your Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so impatience leads people to take things that God meant as blessings and turn them into idolatry. And instead of waiting on the voice of the Lord to speak, they make something flashy, golden &gt;&gt; and then call that truth when it wasn't truth. It was man's imagination. &gt;&gt; It was Saul's impatience in 1st Samuel 13. I almost preached on this tonight and took a totally different direction and the Lord just uh brought me back to where I'm at here tonight. But uh this was a lot of my inspiration in 1st Samuel 13 actually reading it just all day today. But it was incredible because this was the first test true test uh of Saul. I should say the first failure that really if you study the life of Saul his life didn't start out in failure. In fact, it started out with with uh you know a great a man who loved the Lord, who uh you know wanted to do what was right. Saul was not an evil man. Saul had a desire to be a king that that that would lead according to the ways of God and would be obedient to the Lord. But you if you notice the turning point in his life or his be the beginning of his downfall was actually uh there in 1st Samuel 13 when Saul was told to wait for Samuel who I think the Bible says he would be gone for seven days that at the end of those seven days uh s Sam Samuel would return to Saul but here was here was uh Saul and he was surrounded by the Philistines and and and it looks like he's going to get overrun. Their chariots are coming. In fact, reading it today, you could almost relate to Saul and say, "Man, I could sort of see why he got it, I mean, sort started to get worried. It looked like he was going to be wiped out." I mean, here was the Philistine army and even his own soldiers are sort of peeking out, ducking out and running and and deserting Saul and his number shrink and it and here's this, "But here was a word from the Lord. Saul, don't don't don't act. All I've called you to do is to wait." You know, obedience sometimes all the Lord's calling us to do is wait, not to act. &gt;&gt; I I know that there's times in our life, but the prophet of God said when Moses had to, you know, speak unto the children of Israel and not just stand here and and and and cry. Why cry? You speak. And so, there's times in your life when the Lord is not wanting you to wait, but wanting you to move forward. But can I just say that that many times the obedience the Lord is looking for is for us just to be patient. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And wait on the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; But Saul gets ahead of God. It looked like the enemy was closing in. He offers. He finally, you know, just can't wait anymore. Here's the here's the almost the end of the seven days of waiting before Samuel the prophet returns and makes a sacrifice. And then he calls priest. He makes a sacrifice and and Saul Samuel shows up and says, "You've done a horrible thing, Saul. But Lord, I was but but Samuel, I was surrounded. We were about to be overrun, but all God asks you to do is wait." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham and Hagar, we know I got a lot of these written down. God promises a son to Abraham, but the wait was long. And instead of resting in the simplicity of that promise, Abraham and Sarah both devised a plan to, you know, help God out. &gt;&gt; And how many times have we found oursel in that same spot where God has given us a word from the Lord and we've believed it, but after time runs its course, we become impatient with the Lord and we just want to help God out &gt;&gt; and it produces an Ishmael every single time. Amen. &gt;&gt; And here's Ishmael, a work of the flesh that brought strife. It didn't bring peace. And so, I could just say it this way. When you don't wait on the promise that God makes you, uh, as Abraham and Sarah did, you you will end up birthing your own man-made attempt that will just bring strife and complications. And it lasted generations even still today. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can think of the Galatians in Galatians 3:1 when Paul comes to them and and you know the scripture very well. He said, "Having you having begun in the spirit, are you now perfected by the flesh?" &gt;&gt; In other words, you began in the simplicity of go you into the upper room, wait ye in Jerusalem until you be endued with with power. Amen. &gt;&gt; You imagine I I could imagine the impatience that you could grow when but the only word you had from the Lord was to wait. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Power was going to come, but they had to first wait on the Lord. &gt;&gt; I love how brother Brandon says it. He says, you know what they began to do while they were waiting? They didn't get impatient. They didn't say, "Where's the Lord? We're waiting." But here's all we know is Jesus said to wait until the promise of my father which say he you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you. And the prophet of God picks it up and said you know what they started to do in that upper room in that moment of waiting. In that moment when it didn't look like God was doing anything in that moment when it didn't make a lot of sense brother Brandon said they started worshiping the Lord. They got in one mind and one accord and started worshiping the Lord for what he had not yet sent. In other words, you can start to praise the Lord for what you don't even yet have. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said when they got to that place, then there came a sound like a rushing mighty wind. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can think of these examples all the way when Jesus says to wait to to to be obedient to wait in 2 Corinthians chap 11. I think it's verse three. You know the scripture very well from uh when you're teaching on the original sin. And the apostle Paul says, "But I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve &gt;&gt; so your minds should be corrupted." What does he say? From the simplicity &gt;&gt; that is in Christ. Is that what the Bible says? How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even second Timothy when they and I you to say, "Brother Matt, what are you preaching on?" The simplicity of the gospel that it's so simple. So simple &gt;&gt; yet so wonderful. And if and and and I could imagine that there was a great pressure even for Noah. You imagine after preaching the same message for a hundred to all of you that want to complain on the pastor or the preacher preaching part nine and part 10 and part 14 and part 19 and part 25 some pastors you know brother Donnie part n 633 I don't know that he makes that many but I tell you what Noah preached that same message for 120 years &gt;&gt; you imagine the the impatience that that that that that grew grew within the people. Come on, Noah. You've been preaching the same thing for the past 50 years. Ain't you got no new inspiration? Don't you ever hear anything else from the Lord. But you know what Noah knew? God gave him a word and all God asks him to do was be faithful to what he promised. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To not over complicate it. Come on, somebody help me preach. To not try to reinterpret it or reinvent it. Just say what the Lord told you to say, brother, and let the rest be up to God. Don't try to over complicate the gospel. Listen to me, friends. What we've received is not a complex, complicated, untainable, unattainable, ununderstandable truth. But it's simple to understand. And all God asks you to do is believe it the way he spoke it. Don't try to change it. Don't try to add to it or take from it. &gt;&gt; Just preach it the way it was delivered. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Uh they they'll not even in in in in 2 Timothy 4:3, I know you know the scripture that they will not endure sound doctrine, but after their own lust, they shall turn their ears from the truth and be turned unto fable. So this was the danger of of failing to wait. And this is just my burden. I I I I felt like last Wednesday I really couldn't express it the way the Lord gave it to me. And it's I keep wanting to say it's so simple, but that's my title. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That it's so that we if we that what I I I'm afraid that we can do with the truth and the truth that we've received is because of impatience of not seeing what we thought would be the result. You know, then we go to try to brother Brandham said this about those who would say the days of miracles are passed and the prophet said they have to say that because when you are confronted with the miraculous &gt;&gt; you have to make a choice either you you you you ask the Lord why why don't I see the miraculous that I see even in his own ministry. So you had men and ministers who didn't have the gifts operating didn't have a gift like that operating in their ministry. So they had a choice, one of two things. Either they would admit that they don't have it and then cling to the word of the hour and follow the word of the hour or say that the days of miracles are passed and we don't need that anymore. &gt;&gt; Just just for a moment, just ponder that here for a minute that when we don't when we don't see what we think we should see, then we have a choice. And we can, if we're not careful, go in a direction to say, "Well, maybe, you know, maybe maybe it wasn't for us. Maybe it was for somebody else. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Maybe it was for another generation." And so we we move from the simplicity. People can grow weary waiting on the Lord. And in their impatience, as we see from the scripture, can begin to fabricate ideas, doctrines, &gt;&gt; experiences &gt;&gt; that are not grounded in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They walk away from the simplicity of Christ. Even when Jesus says, "Terry the city of Jerusalem until you be undoed." But you know, the problem is is that right there with that word, &gt;&gt; Terry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't like to terry. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, let's go. &gt;&gt; Let's get this thing moving. &gt;&gt; But he said, Terry, we want to move. We want to act. We want to feel. We want to do. And many times we get ahead of God. We run without being sent. We speak without hearing first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I just unburden my heart here? Listen to what brotherham says. This I love this so much. And now that man coming to Jesus, listen to this. Coming to Christ today in the coming through the blood. I love this. Comes into the blood cell. He's talking about this here um in the sill of of of Christ. The man coming to Jesus Christ today coming through the blood comes into the blood cell in fellowship by the Holy Spirit. Don't you just love that? You come into the blood cell by fellowship with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says that God, what did he said? Emanuel took and wrapped himself around a blood cell and the and here was what brother Brandon has wrapped himself in a in a blood cell. Not cells, but the blood cell &gt;&gt; and becomes a part of God. Has God's life in him becomes a son and daughter of God. It's just as impossible for that man to be lost as it is for God himself to be lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For I will give them everlasting life. Everlasting comes from the Greek word Zoey. God's own life. God's life is in the individual and you're sealed by it until the day of redemption. That's the seal of God. And when you do, you become Christlike. &gt;&gt; Amen. You love those that hate you. &gt;&gt; You're for one purpose, to do the will of the father. Bring in all the brothers. Put your arms around your enemies and love them. &gt;&gt; And the great works of the Holy Spirit. Oh wow. So you mean the great works of the Holy Spirit is not casting out devils and casting out demons and opening blind eyes. Hello. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. The great works is to put your arm around your enemies and love them. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; The great works, as brother Brandham says, you love those that hate you. You're for one purpose. &gt;&gt; Bring in all the brothers. Read it again. Put your arms around your enemies and love them. And the great works of the Holy Spirit. Rejoice not in iniquity, but rejoice in truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what you have when you have that nature of Christ living inside of you. As brother Brandham says, you come into that blood cell by fellowship with the Holy Ghost. And he says, then you have eternal life. God's own life. God's life is in the individual. You're sealed into the day of redemption. You become Christlike. What do you have? You have the nature of the lamb living through your humanity. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want that in my life. &gt;&gt; I I I I dwell on this just for a moment even today that that this was the words of in John chapter 15. I I just if you have your Bible, you can read them with me or that I won't have them take that down just because I'll get to back to it too too quickly. But Jesus says, "I am the vine." You know this very well. You are the branch. I'm sorry. I am the vine and my father is the husbandman. This is John 15. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away. And every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. &gt;&gt; So what is one of God's great concerns for our life? Miracles, raising the dead. You say, "Brother Matt, are you against any of those things?" No. I believe God can perform a miracle. He did in my life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every one of you that are here today that have a love for the word of God in your heart, you're a miracle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But notice in John 15, he doesn't say, "Every branch that doesn't perform the supernatural, I'll cut it off." &gt;&gt; But here's what he said. Every branch that doesn't bear fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, I I I beareth fruit. He purgth it that it may bring forth more fruit. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned. What a warning from the Lord &gt;&gt; that this is actually what he's saying that bearing fruit is actually not optional. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the husbandman watches over his vine. He watches over his branches and all the branches that are connected to that vine. And and and with great jealousy, the Bible says, "And with great concern that those branches sprang forth Christ like fruit." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he patiently patient. Oh, I'm so glad that as impatient as I can be on the Lord, he he's patient with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He patiently waits for the branches to bring forth more fruit. He stands beside it with a pruning knife of your life. And anything that comes, if you're a real son of Abraham, a real son of God, daughter of God, listen friends, God won't let you. He might let others and they might get away with it, but he won't let you get away with it. and anything in your life that doesn't bring forth fruit. The nature of Christ, he stands by with a pruning knife ready to cut away anything that is bringing death to the vine. I'm glad I It doesn't feel comfortable. It it it's maybe not what I always like, but but overall at the end of the road, I promise I'll be thankful that I had a patient husband, one who wouldn't let me not bear fruit in my life, but pruned off anything that was unlike him. Amen. &gt;&gt; He he he stands there with with a knife waiting, watching for the slightest evidence of corruption, &gt;&gt; disease, anything to the plant that would cause it to not grow properly. And friends, there are so many things that we can take in that hinder growth. &gt;&gt; But God expects fruit. without fruit. It's actually to be this is this is what Jesus said. Herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit. That's verse eight. Here in my father glorified that you bear much fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So shall you be my disciples. How many want to please God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many want to live a life pleasing to God? You see, we thought that being pleasing to God was to, you know, have great uh, you know, powerful stories and testimonies and send us on the mission field and come back and testify of our meetings and testify of how many a blind eyes were. I listen, I I do that, too, and I'm glad for it. &gt;&gt; But what God's looking for, many will come to me in that day saying, "Lord, Lord, have we not done many wonderful works &gt;&gt; in your name? But what he's looking for is fruits. &gt;&gt; You say, "What kind of fruits?" Fruits that match the word, &gt;&gt; right? And so he says with, he says, "You have not chose me." This is verse 16. "But I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain. For whatsoever you shall ask in my father's name, he may give it to you." you. Aren't you glad he's going to give it to us? &gt;&gt; And so, it's amazing because this is this is exactly what the Lord is saying. I just want to go through some of this in Matthew chapter 21. We read from Matthew 20, but he this is what he he speaks of a and he and he says he says that he taketh away, he prunes it even when he sees the fig tree that's barren and and and he sees that fig tree and he curses the life. He found no fruit on that tree. And he found leaves but no fruit. Right? And so so he says he says here when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing thereon but leaves only and said unto it lo on thee henceforth forever and presently the fig tree withered away. You know what he could do? He could see what no other eye could see. He could see a disease. Well everybody else looked at that tree and maybe thought it was perfectly healthy seen leaves. But Jesus seen further. He seen a corruption or a death that had set in on that tree and said to it, "Let no fruit grow from thee again, because disease lays beneath the bark, and there's death in that disease." Notice he didn't curse. What he cursed was the death that was in what appeared to be life. You see, this is what he says when when he tells us to have righteous judgment that by their fruits you shall know them by what they produce. Not what you say, not what you even externally live, but what you are, who you are. That's the fruit God will judge us by. And so he says here that that you may bear more fruit. So say, brother Matt, what kind of fruit are you talking about? This kind of fruit right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. that put your arms around your enemy and love them and the great works of the Holy Spirit. Rejoice not in iniquity but rejoice in truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We we know these from Galatians chapter 5 and and we won't take all the time just here just as much time as the Lord will before we go on to the next one. I just want to feel that I've I've said what the Lord wanted me to say in Galatians 5:22. Turn there if you could. Galatians 5:22. We'll just read just a few verses from this. And he says, "But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance. Against such there is no law. And they that are in Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust. If we live in the spirit, let us also walk in the spirit. So these were the fruits that he talks about. And I'm just going to read you a few things that brother random said that I thought were just so good in connection to this. And and and and we'll just take just some time just here for a moment. But but I I want you to see that that it was the prophet of God would make this statement. You you might speak in tongues. &gt;&gt; You might, you might not. Amen. &gt;&gt; But here's one thing you will have. You will have evident fruit. &gt;&gt; Evident fruit. Love. We know that word is that word agape. Not the love like we think of from the world, but actually agape love. Christ's own love. The love of God. Not the love of man. That'll fail. The love of affection. That'll fail. That's only temporary. But true charity, true love, true love from the love of God only is imparted to us supernaturally by the Holy Ghost. In fact, you can't humanly have the right kind of love for your wife or a wife or her husband unless the Holy Spirit through you projects that love that a love beyond mistake, love beyond failure, love beyond faults because there's many of them. And it's him. And you say, "Brother Matt, I got to love my brother." You could never love your enemy. &gt;&gt; Because most of us can't even love our brother. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "How can you love, you know, love the ones that you say you love the one God that you don't see, but you don't love the ones that you you hate the ones that you do see?" &gt;&gt; So you say, "How would it happen?" By the indwelling of the Holy Ghost. Love comes from God and God alone. The Holy Ghost is the love of God. Listen to what brother Brandham says here. I can prove it by the Bible. Though I speak with the tongue of men and angels and have not love, it profits me nothing. If you want to know what I think the evidence of the Holy Ghost is, it's love. No matter what else, you can scream, shout, do whatever you want to. If you haven't got love, Paul said you've got nothing. I know people love to just stop on this quote and say, "Well, Brother Brandon almost corrected, Brother Matt. The evidence of the Holy Ghost is not love." Well, that's right. It's not the evidence, but it is a evidence. &gt;&gt; Should have got a bigger amen than that. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know that brother Brandon was corrected in love. Brother Brandon says, "Love, Christian Science, loves everybody, gives to the poor, feeds the widow, you know, takes care of the hungry." And he says they they don't even believe in the divinity of Christ. But it's not to diminish or to take away what he did say about true love. In fact, it would be that same prophet on the uh beyond the curtain of time that would come back with this declaration. Whatever you do, uh make sure you you you don't miss perfect love. Get to the place where you can love everybody. That's what he said. Is that not what he said? Get to the place where you even love your enemy &gt;&gt; because nothing will enter there outside of divine love. I say, God, I want that in my life. I want the the real love of Christ &gt;&gt; to come and project itself through me where I can love anybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean you got to agree with them. Doesn't mean you got to just just accept them. You you know true true true love will tell them that they're wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "How can you say that, brother Matt?" Because if you really believed in God, then you really believe in a heaven. And if you really believe in a heaven, then you really believe in a hell. &gt;&gt; And if you really believe in a hell and you know someone is on their way there, true love will commend them. We'll command them. We'll plead with them. Don't ever end up there, brother. There's a better way. There's a better life. God can free you and set you free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; False love says, "Oh, you know, I don't want to hurt their feelings. I don't want to, you know, be make it uncomfortable and make it awkward." And you know that's not true love friends. &gt;&gt; True love tells the truth. &gt;&gt; True love is honest. I don't know why I'm here man but I am not able to get away from it. &gt;&gt; True love will tell the truth in love but it will tell the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is not love to just say nothing. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you see sin, when you see a person going down a path of of sin and chains of darkness, it is not love just to pray for them silently and never let the love of God project through you to to give them the truth. Tell them the gospel. Tell them what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad I had somebody in my life that could could say it with love, in love, brother, this is what the Bible says. This is what the word of God promises. The way that you're going is a path to destruction. Oh, but there's a hope. There's a better life. There's a way out of that prison. There's a man who can break the chains of your life. His name is Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's true love. Joy. The Bible says, "Joy, restore to me the joy." This one, Brother Brandon says, "I love this." Now, David had not lost his salvation. This is the words of David. Restore to me the joy of my salvation. Brother Adam says, "David had not lost his salvation, but the joy of it." &gt;&gt; And when it comes to a place that I cannot enjoy my religion, there's something wrong somewhere because it's joy unspeakable and full of glory. &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. When we got to be begged to worship God, that's only because our hearts have grown cold. Amen. &gt;&gt; When we've got to be begged to come to church, it's only because if we'd be honest, our hearts have gotten cold. We haven't. You say, "Brother man, have we lost our salvation?" No, but you might have lost the joy of your salvation. Because real salvation comes with joy, unspeakable, and full of glory. When you got to be to say amen to the word of God, it ain't the preacher's fault. It ain't God's fault. It's it's our own lazy spiritual carnal lazy condition that we got to with rubbing our shoulders with the world. We ought to have something inside of us. Even when we don't feel good, even when the day didn't go good, when everything might be going against us, yet we can say, "God, you are still worthy of my praise. You are still worthy of my of my worship, Lord." &gt;&gt; In fact, it's true worship that comes when it's you're not feeling good. You don't feel up to. You don't feel like it. I tell you what, that's when you really can worship the Lord. It's when you don't feel I don't feel worthy. Real worship comes when you don't really feel worthy because it ain't never been about you and it never will be about you. But I tell you what true worship will do. It will break the grip of the enemy out of your life. It'll break the grip of depression in your life. &gt;&gt; You want to know what it'll break the power of darkness? Worship the Lord. It set Paul free in a prison when he was bound with chains and he began to worship from his own prison. &gt;&gt; It was Judah who was called what did his name even Judah? His name means praise. &gt;&gt; Oh, we ought to get back to the to the what the Bible says around the sixth hour Jesus visited a well by said I must go by the way of Samaria. And what did Jesus tell her? I'm searching those looking for those who who worship me in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; You say, "I got the spirit." Hello. I've got the truth. Then it will produce worship. &gt;&gt; I said the spirit and the truth will produce true worship. &gt;&gt; That Judah's name meant worship. His name I thought about that today. His name meant praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's literally in fact you go read it when he his name there and God says Judah your name shall be Judah which mean pra which means praise and he says and your hand will be on the neck of your enemy. Notice what he's saying about worship and about praise. That worship and praise puts your hand on the neck of your enemy. And it's not like I looked it up. It's not like this. It's actually like this to put on the back of the head and make it bow down unto you. Listen, you want to know how to make your depression bow down? Start worshiping the Lord. Put your praise on the neck of that devil and say, "Satan, you got to bow down to the name of Jesus." Depression, you will bow at the name of worship and at the sound of praise. All the chains that Satan tries to put on me can be broken and loosed in Jesus' name. &gt;&gt; That's what true worship will do. It'll make the devil bow down to you. &gt;&gt; That was free. It wasn't on my notes, but this is what true joy. Brother Brandham says, "Restore to me the joy of my salvation." It's joy. Listen what he says. One scripture said, "Taste and see that the Lord is good. It tastes like honey in the rock." Brother, I'm so glad I have tasted that the Lord is good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One of the fruits is peace. Peace. Listen to this. Prophet of God says, "And in all this time, you'll certainly above everything bear the fruit of the spirit." &gt;&gt; There's one sure thing you will do. Says, "Is your life worthy of the gospel?" There's one sure thing you will do. You will bear the fruit of the spirit. And the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, faith, longsuffering, meekness, gentleness, patience. And this is what true peace is. Listen. Still listening. Brother man says, he says, "Christians are still outside on the first altar if you're still listening to what the neighbor will think." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Instead, the Holy Spirit brings a life that's characterized by peace, love, joy, longsuffering, goodness, gentleness, patience. Don't fuss about the other things. &gt;&gt; Get that in your life. &gt;&gt; And you'll never get it until you're hid away with God. &gt;&gt; Listen to kindness. Be kind one to another. &gt;&gt; Be kind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One to another. &gt;&gt; And all the Christians say, "Okay, I can do that." Be kind to your enemies. Amen. &gt;&gt; Love everybody. No matter what they've done, &gt;&gt; love them anyhow. And if you can't do that, brother, you need to be at the altar. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what brother Brandham says is true kindness leads to forgiveness. Even those who oppose us, those who hurt us. I tell you what it will do. it'll be one sure sign that it ain't you who's living anymore but Christ living in you. If a person can find themsself just to and and I can just say this here and I know it's very simple &gt;&gt; but if we ain't able friends if we ain't able to show kindness &gt;&gt; how can we call ourselves Christians &gt;&gt; would that not be the most basic fundamental evidence &gt;&gt; that you've really met the Lord &gt;&gt; is that you're a kind person kindness. Listen to what he says about goodness here. When the Holy Spirit comes into a life, he terraces off a nice big place and puts up a great big mansion &gt;&gt; and he lives there. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the flowers of love, joy, peace, longsuffering, goodness, mercies, kindness, faith are blooming all around this house. You know, we got a problem if what's growing and blooming around our house is anger and malice and jealousy and envy and strife and argument. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't think we could say the Lord lives there. Somebody lives there, but it ain't the Lord. &gt;&gt; He says, why is it that so many this is in why why is it that so many Christians find it hard to live a Christian life? And so it's it's actually goodness is a garden. Goodness is a fruit that is born out of our life. Beautiful flowers, fruits blooming all around the house and they flourish in the life of a true believer. faithfulness, which we know is faith. No matter how loyal you are to anything else, be loyal to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll say it again. No matter how loyal you are to anything else, be loyal to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what true faithfulness is. One who holds on to faith is loyal and faithful to Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is exactly what it means to have genuine faith. Faithfulness. Genuine faith. As the brother Adam says, there's only one evidence of the Holy Spirit that I know. That's a genuine faith in the promised word of the hour. That's what it means to be truly spiritfilled as you will believe the word for your hour. &gt;&gt; Gentleness, which also is what we use for meekness. Why did he choose the lamb? This is the this is the prophet of God and the lamb and the dove in 1956. Why did he choose the lamb and the dove? It's because the dove could not abide on nothing else but a lamb. Because their natures are the same. &gt;&gt; Did you catch that? &gt;&gt; The reason the dove can abide on the lamb is because their nature's the same. That tells me that if my nature does not match the nature of the Holy Spirit, it cannot abide on me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Their natures are the same. Their nature, the nature of a dove, the nature of a lamb, he brother says their natures were meek, &gt;&gt; humble, teachable. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And lowly, and that's why they could dwell together. Now what if the lamb would have snorted like a wolf? Why? The dove would have been gone. &gt;&gt; And if we are lambs of God, we should have the nature of lambs &gt;&gt; if we expect the dove to abide. &gt;&gt; This is what it means to have the seal of God. When you do, you become Christlike. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're gentle. You're sweet. You've got a gentle, humble spirit. So simple, Brother Matt. I know. But so wonderful. &gt;&gt; Self-control. This is what temperance means. I could we could spend sermons on each and every single one of these. This is what temperance means. It means to be controlled, self-control. Listen to what brother Adam says here. Temperance doesn't mean to stop drinking alcohol. No, &gt;&gt; temperance doesn't mean alcoholic cure. Not in this case. Listen to what brother Brandham says here. This is Bible temperance, Holy Spirit temperance that we're talking about. That means how to control your tongue. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not be a tattler. &gt;&gt; How to control your temper. &gt;&gt; Amen. not fly off every time anybody speaks cross to you. How to answer in kindness when wrath is spoke to you. Somebody says, "You bunch of holy rollers." Don't jump out and roll up your sleeves, &gt;&gt; but talk with godly love, temperance, kindness. When you're riled upon, rile not back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let Jesus be your example. statue of a perfect man. I love how Brother Brandham says that. Don't rile back when you're riled upon. Don't rile back. Let the Lord be your example. So, what is true temperance? It's the governor that the Holy Ghost puts upon our life. &gt;&gt; And it ought to govern our temper. It ought to govern our tongue. &gt;&gt; Amen. It ought to govern what we say, what we confess because our words have power &gt;&gt; and our words create things. It ought to control our confession. It ought to control our reactions and our attitudes. This is what true self-control of the Holy Ghost brings. It controls. As the prophet of God said, it brings your whole body in subjection to the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Whatever he says, you say, "Yes, Lord." Whenever he says no, you say, "No, Lord. I don't want it." Whenever he says go, you say, "I'm going to go, Lord." Whenever he says stop, you say, "Okay, I'll stop, Lord." &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost getting control, temperance of our life to be able to control what we think. control what we say, control what we do. That's only comes by the nature of the Zoey life that comes inside of you. That true true nature. You say, "Brother Matt, why are you preaching on these things?" Because last Wednesday you preached all about what they had uh what what it what what what it meant to be uh key that unlocked the Bible was what the first church had. And I believe that with all of my hearts, friends, that's exactly what it means. It means that there will be something that came on the day of Pentecost that brought a nature, not just gifts, not just tongues, not just miracles, not just outward uh things like that, but it brought the people in full control of the life that they had received. And when you have the life of the token inside of you, you have all of his miracles. You have his gifts. You have his fruits. You have his manifestation because it's the literal life of Jesus Christ. And not everybody's the same. &gt;&gt; You know, that's that's a truth that is as old as the Bible itself. You you I can think of so many examples. The way that God natured each one of Gad and Reuben and Simeon and Levi and and all of the sons of Jacob, all of those different tribes would represent a different nature characteristic because God is a God of variety and and even in the Bible, those gifts that you read in Corinthians and and even even uh you know the the the the the difference in varieties. The Bible speaks of that. I think in Romans chapter 12, it talks about the ministers and varieties. Let ministers wait on their ministering and and teaching on those that exhort and those kind of things. And so, but but what makes up the body of God is that bouquet of of of flowers, not just one culture, not just one people, not just one style, not just one approach. Listen, friends, but God is a God of contrast. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's a God of of variety. I know you have your preference and so do I. But many times we confuse our preference with God's preference. &gt;&gt; And many times what we call right and wrong ain't got nothing to do with right or wrong. It's just you what you prefer and what you don't prefer. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; And and people if they're not careful, they just cut everyone out that's not like you, thinks like you, talks like you, looks like you. We've seen it. We've seen it. And in the world that we live in, it's it draws separation. It draws boundaries between people. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and many people think that the, you know, I can I'm just going to get into the weeds here just for a moment, but you know, many people think that the biggest enemy, you know, to the message sometimes is is a man who's educated or or refined in their speech or articulate, you know, and maybe they, you know, maybe they hadn't is, you know, aren't just a rough gruff, you know, uh, evangelistic kind of a preacher. And many people think that, you know, that that that, you know, that's the kind of people who lead people away from the the the truth. Listen friends, let me just say this. Today, there has been just as many screaming uh uh uh uh uh uh dynamic, charismatic uh uh uh men who stood behind the pull pit and preached what we call the message of the hour. That has led just as many men astray that were more refined in their speech. It ain't got nothing to do with personalities. It personality was not the problem. The problem is they never had the token Zoey seed life of God. They were never born again. That was the whole problem. &gt;&gt; It's not about it's the problem has not been a type of personality or or their delivery. The problem is men who have invaded the pullpit without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because none of us are the same. Can we just all admit that here tonight? We're not all the same. &gt;&gt; We don't all like the same thing. &gt;&gt; You know, people from the south are different. And people, I'll just say it first that we're weird. And so are northerners. They're weird. And I called me weird first. So don't get mad. They're different. Westerners are different. It's just how people are. Canadians are different. I I went to, you know, Africa. Africans are different. Chinese are different. You know, it's just different. And it's not about right or wrong. Right? &gt;&gt; It's not about right or wrong. Many times we call these things that are right or wrong prefer and all they are is truly preferences that we have. &gt;&gt; But none of us are the same. The east are different than the west. &gt;&gt; It gets even bigger when you look at other countries, different foods, different flavors, different spices. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, certain things that they eat even you just think, how could they ever eat that? Well, that's because you're not them and they're not you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they look at you and your, you know, you know, pigs feet that some people eat and some people eat cowbrain, mano, lingua, cow tongue. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's part of their culture. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't eat it. &gt;&gt; But it's just a difference. It's not about right or wrong. I don't know why I'm here, but I'm here. It's just difference. But does that mean God is only going to rapture a certain people out of a certain area that speak a certain way, have a certain style or out of one country? No. The body of God is many members. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From many different tongues and peoples and tribes &gt;&gt; uh many different The problem has not has not been that. The problem is is that our nature, it's not about your personalities or your preference. is does your nature match the nature of the lamb? That's all that God cares about. That's all we should care about. &gt;&gt; Does the nature match the nature of him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Does it mean that all the bride of Christ around the world will talk the same, preach the same, look the same, act the same? American culture, southern culture, Western culture. I tell you what God was going to do. He wasn't going to dress us in a southern culture or a northern culture or an American way or a western way. He was going to come to dress the bride with the nature of the lamb. He was going to dress the bride and it wasn't going to be a culture of man. It would be a bride united by one thing, the word and the word only. It would be a variety of people of all different kinds of languages, different countries, but all led under the same Holy Ghost. Then you say, "Brother Matt, what will be the same between all of us?" I'll tell you what will be the same. It will be the same message of the book of Acts original message. It will be one. Listen, I believe my Bible says this. It says there is one Lord. There is one faith. There is one baptism. How many believers do we have of that here today? There's not many approaches to God. There's only one and there's one thing that unites us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's that original message, that standard, that pattern. And the Holy Ghost will produce the same person, the same sanctified life. Not the same personality, but the same sanctified life, the same gifts, the same miracle, the same miracles, the same character of Christ. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because it will all be the same anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not an ox, not a man, not a lion, but an eagle. &gt;&gt; And when you get around eagles, they're the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've traveled got the privilege of traveling to other countries. And man, I I can just report to you one simple thing. Believers in other countries have that same eagle nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know when you're really around one, you can fellowship on the same exact thing. You say, "How, brother Matt?" Because they're all pregnantated with the same word and they're all producing the same life. They're producing the same thing. Listen to what Brother Brandham says here. We're just going to take just let me find out where we are. Okay? We are I won't tell you, but we are close. We are in the end time. Don't worry. This is what brother says. Remember this. Christ in Somebody say true church. &gt;&gt; True church. &gt;&gt; Christ in the true church. is a continuation of the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; Hold on. You mean the book of Acts wasn't a previous dispensation that was closed and then we moved to a No, friends. In order to be a continuation, it couldn't be a closure in a different dispensation. No, we're not planting this church back down to seven more ages. But the same life that went in the ground would be found in the seed form again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts. But the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless. It exposes Satan revealing his works attempted destruction of God's people and the discredited of God's word right down to the time he's cast a lake of fire. He fights that. He cannot stand that. He knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and I love this and what she stands for &gt;&gt; and that she can do the greater work, she will be an invincible army &gt;&gt; if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian church &gt;&gt; and by God's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit, Satan will be powerless before her. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; If they recognize that within the same framework is people confessing the same message, confessing the same prophet, believing that they say believe say that they believe the same thing, but the spirit would not be the same spirit. Hello. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You can have all the message and miss the spirit of the message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said you can have all of the message and miss the spirit of the message itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can have all the truth and miss the miss the spirit behind the truth because the the Bible says it's the spirit of truth. &gt;&gt; Truth has a spirit. It's a person. So you can have the truth but not have the spirit of truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. The tree of knowledge produced clever men, men of renown, but their ways are the ways of death. God's people are simple. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But spiritually minded, leaning toward God and nature, calmly tilling the soil, caring for truth rather than wealth. I love that, friends. caring for truth rather than wealth. &gt;&gt; Can I just say you you would be hardpressed to convince to convince me that you've truly been born of the spirit of God if you don't have a hunger and a care for the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's one of the most evident fruits a person has truly been born of the spirit of God is that they love and care for the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They want to know what it says. They want to know what it says to them. They want to live what it says. They want to know what it says. You can't tell me you've been born truly born of the spirit of God and there's no thought or time ever to know and read your Bible &gt;&gt; to never break this Bible open and read it for yourself. Friend, I'm just going to be honest with you. I I I I don't see how &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; that there's got if there's not a simple not just a not just a not just a wanting to know but a care as brother Brandham says there they care for the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; rather than wealth. The seed of the serpent has brought tremendous commerce, wonderful inventions. But with it all comes death. Their gunpowder and atomic bombs kill in war. and in peace a time. Their mechanical inventions such as the car kill even more in a time of peace than do the inventions of war that destroy in the time of trouble. Death and destruction are the fruit of her of her labors. But they are religious. They believe in God. They are like their father, the devil, and their ancestor Cain. Both of them believed in God. They go to church. They mingle with the righteous as do tears with the wheat. In so doing, they corrupt and produce a nicicoatan religion. They spread their poison and every effort to try to destroy the seed of God, even as Cain killed Abel. Jude says, "Their spots in your feast of charity when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear, clouds they are without water, carried about of winds, trees whose fruit witherth without fruit, twice dead." You know how you become twice dead? Because you're already spiritually, you're already dead when you're born. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But now you're spiritually dead, plucked up by the roots. So this is this is this is how close it would be. As the Bible says, it would be so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible. What would be the difference, brother Matt? The token will be the difference. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not a manifestation, not a sensation, not even one of the fruits of the spirit. &gt;&gt; But the difference will be the token &gt;&gt; which is the literal life of Christ in the nature of the soul projecting itself. &gt;&gt; Listen what brother, this is Matthew chapter 20 was our scripture. I'm just going to read it and then we'll close. The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that's a householder which went out early in the morning to hire laborers. We read this. Notice early in the morning. Let's read verse three. And when he went out about the third hour, I love this. He went out about the third hour and saw where where else do you find that third hour in your Bible? I think it was Acts two that we read that Peter said, seeing it's about the third hour of the day. These are not drunk. So what was it? This was the first hours. This was the early morning. As the prophet of God said, these workers that he's that he's telling us about in Matthew chap 20 are the laborers, the original laborers in the vineyard on the day of Pentecost in the book of Acts. These were those original workers that received the the the the the wages for their labors. &gt;&gt; And he says he went about the other third hour and saw others standing idle. said to them, "Go you also in the vineyard. Whatsoever is right, I'll give you." They went in their way. Again he went out about the 6th and the 9inth hour and did likewise. And about the 11th hour he went out. Hold on a minute. It goes from 6 to 9 to 11. And he found others standing idle and said, "What is the 11th hour?" The 11th hour is the last hour &gt;&gt; of the day. Because something special is going to come not at the first, second, third, fourth, fifth hour, sixth hour, ninth hour, but something very special is going to happen on the 12th hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, the Bible says that the kingdom of heaven is likened unto two virgins. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "But at the 12th hour, the midnight hour, &gt;&gt; a cry went forth, go you out to meet him." So what was going to happen on the 12th hour would be the coming of the Lord. But there would be an 11th hour gentile worker that would receive the same pay as the first worker. &gt;&gt; And and and this is what he says here. He says about the 11th hour and found others standing idle. And and verse 8, so when even was come, that means the evening time, the Lord of the vineyard said unto his steward, call the labors and give them their hire, beginning from the first to the last. Listen to this. And and because this is this is so beautiful here. And brother Random says this and and I'm just going to skip some of this here. Notice he says, "The seventh angel message, seventh angel's message is to open the mystery of the seals, calling the 11th hour gentile workers to receive the same pay that the first hour workers got." &gt;&gt; Jesus taught it. He said there was people went into the harvest. They were hired and when they did of early morning, they received a penny for the day. And then at noon time, someone else came and went to work. And then at the 11th hour, that's the last hour of the day, that someone came in and received the same kind of pay they did at the first hour, the last hour. And it's so perfectly how the first hour messengers with the word, with the gospel, with the truth, they came in at the day of Pentecost. Then there was a a dark age that blacked them out at the middle of the day. Luther Wesley came in. And then there had there is to be an evening time message and to receive the same thing. Somebody say same thing. &gt;&gt; To receive the same thing they did at the beginning. The evening time message is to restore back again. To bring the same thing back again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Matt, what are you preaching?" I'm just preaching what it says in Matthew chapter 20. that the end time worker didn't get what the the what the you know some other pay, you know, something else or something more or some new gospel or some new teaching or some new idea. They try to make the message some kind of new thing or new dispensation and the book of acts was a previous dispensation. My Bible says the 11th hour gentile worker gets the same pay as the first age, first off Ephesus, first messenger, first gospel. It was the alpha and the omega. &gt;&gt; And they would receive the very same pay. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Matt, well, why is that important?" Here's why. Because he said, "The bride will come into preview again." And here come the bride. Notice Brother Bam sees this worldly church, USA. Brother Bham says, "What a horrible sight." And he says, "I've watched." He's that first church comes through preview and he says marching beautiful white flowing and he said just just a pure unadulterated group and brother Brandham says then he said then the the church of America will come into preview and brother Brandham says if I ever seen such a horrible mess he said oh I just I bowed my head and said Lord after all the times all the gospels went sea to sea and we've stood and preached for you and this is the best we could produce. He was seeing what was he seeing? And I'll tell you what he was seeing in some of the modern churches you see around uh uh us even here today on YouTube and and got millions of followers and they became a you know a social culture where they just accept everybody tolerate everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And some of the things that we think are pure you know even some of the most purest things that it's hard to find good pure things to to even uh entertain yourself with anymore friends because they've all drunken of the wine of her wrath of her fornication. You almost can't find nobody to really take a stand for Jesus. I'm just going to go ahead and say it, you know, and I I don't want to I don't want to draw a circle or draw a line here, even bring it up because I'm not I'm not like that. But I was just reading today of Chip and Joanna Gains. Here was a what was supposed to be be a you know a wholesome you know thing. People visited went to Waco and seen you know that Magnolia all of that and I you know not I'm not here to to only God will be their judge. But but I was reading what even here here was after all the criticism that people make and the uproar of them allowing a same-sex couple. I don't even watch that show. I'm just telling you what uh just what I just read. You know, a lot of same-sex couple, you know, and and and and and there was this outrage and this great outrage and this cry against it. How could you do this? And and they were just silent until I think it was yesterday. And and here was here's opportunity to respond. You know what he said? He said it's so sad that people can't accept I'm trying to remember the way that the words that he used, but he said they can't accept a modern cultured Christian. Something like that. &gt;&gt; A modern cultured Christian. &gt;&gt; In other words, I the reason I'm doing this because I've got to be a modern cultured Christian. One who just, you know, we we've got to change with the times. We've got to, you know, become more tolerant. And he says, "It's so sad that the first hate that they receive is is your people who are criticized in a modern culture. Do you go look it up?" Maybe you maybe it wasn't the exact way he said it, but I promise you if you got the Holy Spirit inside of you, it'll nauseate you as bad as it nauseated me to read it. And I'm not here to criticize, you know, that man or that show or anything like that. I'm just here to to tell you tonight. I'm just here to declare one thing. The gospel of Jesus Christ has never been about making people feel good or to make everybody feel good about themselves or to be socially accepted or to be accepted by the masses. It was meant to separate the good from the evil. It was a sword that was to to to come to divide the truth from the error. And we've got to stand on the word of God and preach it the way that it was preached originally. It was the same faith, the same gospel, one Lord, one faith, one baptism. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says that notice he said they seem that modern church twisting and to the beat of rock and roll music almost nude, nothing covered in a little gray piece of newspaper. Brother Brandham says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; And he says, and I bowed my head, said, "Lord, is this the best we can do after all that we've done?" He said, the voice spoke and said, "The bride will come into preview again." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And here the bride came behind her. The very same looking bride. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The very same looking bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, so the bride of the end time looks like the bride of the first time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride of the end time matches what the &gt;&gt; first end time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "I wonder what the end time I wonder what, brother Matt, I've always wondered what would the first church look like." Well, if we'd be honest, it looks a lot like this church. &gt;&gt; You want to know what the first church looked like? Look at a real believer. It'll tell you what the first church age looked like &gt;&gt; because this was to be a return. Brother Brandham says, "Looking bride that passed at the beginning, then my heart jumped for joy to know there will be a bride." Are you glad you're part of it? &gt;&gt; And she will be made of the same thing, clothed in the same thing the one was at the beginning. &gt;&gt; The same as she was at the beginning. Let's all stand to our feet tonight. The same life, the same love, peace, joy, wisdom, demonstration of the Holy Ghost. You see friends, this what we believe is not some new religion or new denomination, new idea. The message was never about when we make it some kind of new dispensation and say that Acts two was some previous dispensation and that was a different baptism and there's the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit are two different things. You make the message I'm just going to say it as plain as I can. When we make the message some kind of new thing, you remove it from what the Bible said it was to be. You remove it from what the what what gave the truth would be the word of God would define what the truth was. Not men, not not preachers, though. Thank God for preachers, but it wouldn't be them. It would be God who defined what the original pattern was. And the message of the hour was never about coming to some new thing. It was always about a restoration of the original. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I get a hearty amen from Bethl Tabernacle? &gt;&gt; Amen. It was never a new dress code. We don't have a new dress code. We have the original. &gt;&gt; It was ne never about a new doctrine. It was not about that that one thing. Listen friends, when when brother Brandon goes beyond the curtain of time there and and he's standing there even even in another place, he's telling about the vision and and how that he says you have to the angel the voice said you'll have to be judged with your people according to the things that you preached. And brother Baron says a fear gripped his heart. This is what I've preached. &gt;&gt; And then the prophet of God says, 'I I asked and said, will Paul have to stand with his people, Luther? He says, yeah. Will Paul? Yep. Brother Brandham says, will Paul be accepted? And the voice says, yes, Paul will be accepted. And brother Random says, I breathed a great sigh of relief and said, praise God. then we'll be accepted too because I preached what Paul preached. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And the voices of thousands of people cried out, we are resting upon that." &gt;&gt; What was the church resting upon? Their works, their ability, their behavior, how good of a grade they would make. No, that wasn't the rest of the bride. The rest of the bride is that they believed the message for their hour &gt;&gt; and that messenger was faithful to the word, the original word pattern &gt;&gt; and I'm resting upon it. &gt;&gt; I'm resting upon that. It's so simple and I'm so glad he came to the simple and it's so wonderful and I'm glad. I just want to say Lord, thank you that I'm a part of it. How many want to do that here tonight? Thank you, Lord. As the song says, you you you didn't have to open my eyes. You could have easily passed me by. Oh Lord, you didn't have to do it, but you did. I just want to say thank you, Lord God. What What did I do, Lord, to deserve nothing I could do? nothing I could bring, Lord, but grace, amazing grace in my life. I just want to say maybe someone could say it by an uplifted hand. Lord, if I've not borne those type of fruits, then Lord, prune me. Prune every branch that's not bringing forth that kind of fruit in my life. I got both of my hands raised. Prune it, Lord God, if it would be anything, Lord, that would not bring forth true life. Not anything I produce, Lord. Not produced from the impatience or produced from not wanting to wait, Lord. But if there would be anything that would be producing a spirit that would be unlike the spirit of my original lamb, that lamb can only that dove can only rest on a nature that matches his nature. So God, prune it out of my life. Take it from me, God. If you've got to rip it out of my hands. Oh, can you do that, friend? Can you keep your hand up? If you got to rip it out of my hands, Lord, rip it out, Jesus. I might love it, might cherish it, Lord, but if it's if it's not bringing forth fruit, in this will you be glorified. that we bear fruits. What kind of fruits? Peter says the fruits of righteousness, not numbers, not success by wealth, success by prosperity, success by external things. But Peter tells us it's the fruit of righteousness. That righteousness is not our own, Lord. That's your your righteousness, Lord. Clothed in your garments. [Music] You've given it to us, Lord. And your word tells us to let these things be in us and abound. To become partakers of the divine nature. Those are the things that we want Lord in our life to be a partaker of the divine nature. That life Lord that was came back on the day of Pentecost. That life Lord God is the same life that's available here tonight. It's available to every person. It's available to every young person, every old person, every family. For you said, "The promise is unto you, to your children, to them that are a far off, as many as the Lord our God shall call." That promise, Lord, that you made, you still stand behind it. You still back it up, Lord. It's the promise, Lord, of prevailing power. When we can't overcome, there's a overcomer living on in the inside of us. When we feel like giving up, oh, but there's a spirit that won't let us. Lord, when we make mistakes, there's there's a conviction that comes, Lord, by your Holy Spirit says, you ought not to do that. You ought not to have said that, Lord, when we need understanding, you're the teacher. You're the guide. You're the spirit of wisdom. You're the spirit of knowledge. When we're in trouble, Lord, your spirit brings peace. When we're down, we can put on the garments of praise. you be the joy of our salvation. I pray Lord that if we'd find oursel in any condition, anything Lord God that would be less than that original pattern, then convict our hearts. Lord, bring us back to to the true benchmark, the true keystone, the true plum line as your prophet said. Not a new gospel, Lord. Not to not a not another Jesus, Lord, but that same original. Yeah. Men have gotten impatient. Men have men, Lord, have have not been able to just believe the simplicity of what you said. And they've they've created, Lord, all kinds of ideas, ideas of men. And it's produced Ishmails. It's produced destruction. It's produced death. All because we we can't accept the simplicity of the gospel. But I just raise my hand and say, "Lord, I accept it with all of my heart. I don't need something new. Oh, do you can you say that, friend? I don't need something new. I don't need some kind of new idea. I don't need some kind of new fresh thing. You know, the the latest and the greatest, the cutting edge. Oh, I believe you're revealing things, Lord. Revelation upon revelation. It's the greatest power in our life. But that revelation will match what the word said. It won't be some kind of new idea. It'll always bring us back to the original. &gt;&gt; I pray God that you would bring us back to that Jesus. That truth that's so simple, so wonderful, Lord. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Oh, let's sing it. Sing Brother Ken. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let's sing this as we gather. Come and gather now. &gt;&gt; And I will search for &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus, take my life and lead me on.
