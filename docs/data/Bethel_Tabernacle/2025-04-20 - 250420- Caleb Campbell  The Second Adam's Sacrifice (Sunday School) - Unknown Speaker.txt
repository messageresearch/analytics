TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Amen. God bless you all this morning. Good to be in the house of the Lord here this Easter Sunday morning. Um if you just want to all stand to our feet if you don't mind on this day a little over 2,000 years ago the tomb was emptied. Amen. and uh Jesus 40 40 days on earth prior to his ascension um back to heaven began. I've always been so fascinated by that span of time, that 40 days. I mean, you know, seeing Jesus as a man, as a young man, that would have been amazing. Seeing his earthly ministry, watching him through the miracles and the signs and the wonders and even listening to him preach firsthand. But to see Jesus come back in his glorified body and you know this was think about this is the god of god of the world. This is our this is our savior tabernacled himself in a body and then chose to appear to a certain group of people during that time. And I just think that's amazing. Um my lesson this morning has been dealing with my heart this last week and I I was praying the Lord would just inspire my my heart with something special kind of along the lines of Easter this morning. So um it's right along those lines. If you turn in your Bibles to Leviticus chapter 1, we have two readings. Leviticus chapter 1. We're going to catch the first few verses and then turn into 1 Corinthians 15. So it says, "And the Lord called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, if any man of you bring an offering unto the Lord, ye shall bring your offering of cattle, even of the herd and of the flock. If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish. He shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord. And he shall put, and I want you to catch this specific verse, and he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering. And it shall be accepted for him to make an atonement for him. And he shall kill the bullock before the Lord. and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. Um, and we're going to actually just go ahead and go into 1 Corinthians chapter 15. 1 Corinthians chapter 15 this morning. And we're going to catch the last five verses of that chapter. 1 Corinthians or I'm sorry, not the last five verses, but ch uh verses 45. Starting at 45, we're going to read down to 50. And it says, "And so it is written, the first man, Adam was made a living soul. The last Adam was a made a quickening spirit." Amen. How be it, that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy. The second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthly, such are they also that are earthly. And as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthly, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, in the flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither do corruption inherit incorruption. Let's just bow our heads this morning. Heavenly Father, we thank you, Lord, for the reading of your word, Lord. We know that this is, Lord, a Sunday school lesson, Lord, but we still consider it, Lord, just a sacred time to come before your throne, Lord, and just hear from you, Lord. There's an opportunity, Father, for ears to hear your word. I just pray that you could open it up to us, Lord. Father, be with the entirety of the service. We love you. We commit ourselves to you, Lord. Thank you for what this day means, Lord. It's more than just a celebration in our hearts, Lord. It's everything to us. We ask it now in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you this morning as you take your seats. So most of us understand that referring back to Leviticus there that the Old Testament law here that we read was how uh the believer in that time would atone for their sins. Sin from the very beginning of time was what separated man from God. You know God is holiness. The very essence of God is holy. And when the first separation took place there there in the garden, the original sin, what it did is it broke the connection that God had with us. So in the great redemption story, God always had a plan to restore us back to that unfettered fellowship so that we could once again dwell in his presence. And you know, as brother Brandon would say, walk in the cool of the evening and fellowship with the creator. That's that's what God that's always what he had envisioned for us. But see, blood was the only way that it could be truly restored. And we're not going to get into this part of it very much this morning, but it had to be innocent blood. Um, so for a time, as we read there in Leviticus, it was the innocent blood of an animal that God put in place. It was a sacrifice. And really was what it was. It was a substitution. It was a way for man to make amends with the evil that they had done. And you know, I believe that the Lord does things in a a certain way for a reason. So you see, when it came time for those priests to make these sacrifices, there was something very personal about this process. Verse four, and I told you guys to I I told the class this morning to to think about that scripture. Verse four says, "He shall put his hand on the upon the head of the burnt offering." I found this point to be so incredible because I believe so often times in the the worldview of modern Christianity this concept is misunderstood. On the surface you read in the Bible that they put their hand upon the offering meaning that they made contact with the sacrifice. But it it was something it became personal to them. But if you start to really study this verse out in Hebrew, the word there that they use is actually, and I don't know if I'm pronouncing this right, but it's sach, which means that they leaned heavily into because it was more than just making con contact with this innocent animal. Amen. It was when when the tr it was a transfer of what you did upon this innocent animal. Amen. And that's what that's what the sacrifice is to us. It's the the Lord is is is innocent, but he chose to become the sacrifice for you and for I. And I want you to notice this morning that when you put your hand up when they put their hand upon that sacrifice in literal speaking back in those days, it wasn't that they just set their hand upon it and it was, you know, like they were petting a an animal. It was something that it was a personal connection that you were to make with this animal to let you know that this thing was about to die for what you did. It was a transfer of your sin upon this animal. And I thought that that verse you leaned heavily into it. It was a recognition, amen, that it was that sin that was being transferred and it was literally going to take your place in death because you were the one that deserved to die. Amen. Who whoever committed the sin was the one who deserved to die. But God made a way so they wouldn't have to die by a transfer of that sin upon the innocent animal. But because there had to be because there was a personal connection that you were going to make with this animal. Amen. and it was literally going to take the place uh for you. And then this poor innocent creature was giving its life for yours. So, you know, it wasn't just about kind of bringing it back to our our time now because that's just spiritually speaking. It's not just about making contact with the creator. It's not just about a surface level religion where you have an idea, an understanding, a concept of what Jesus did for you. You need to lean heavily into the sacrifice that was made for you. Amen. You have to personally identify yourself that there was a lamb that was slain from before the foundation of the world. And all of the the scriptures that we read are types until we get to Jesus Christ. They're types of what Jesus was going to do. Amen. As a sacrificial lamb for us on our behalf. Amen. So it was it was more than making contact and touching. You would lean upon it with sincere conviction. You would weep and you would cry over this this animal. You'd be sorry. You'd be sorrowful for it because it was taking your place. And you know what I'm what I'm I'm I'm afraid that too many people do today is they've never fully identified themselves with the sacrifice. They've never fully leaned into the sacrifice. They've they've made contact with it. You know, you come to church and you make contact with it. You you see that there's a God. You see that he's going to take away the sins of the world, but have you ever fully identified yourself with that sacrifice and made it something personal? I believe we all have here this morning. But just as a refreshing, I want you to refresh yourself in that tonight that we are to fully identify with the sacrifice that Christ made for us because we were guilty. We were we were we were completely guilty. He was completely innocent. But the transfer took away the guilt. And one one thing I think I have actually this in my notes a little bit later, but one thing that's amazing is is even though that you're going to you were going to be the priest was going to look at this animal and maybe be sorry for what it was about to do, it knew that it would take away because that was what God had in store had in place. it. He knew that after after the the the atonement, after the blood was was shed and it was poured upon the altar that there would be an atonement. So even though it was a hard thing because sometimes, you know, repenting of your sins, you know, you you feel so so crept into it, but you know that there's going to be something take place, a release of that guilt. Amen. Because he takes away the sin. He takes away there's a transfer. Amen. and and uh these are some words of Spurgeon I think it was that he says believer do you remember that rapturous day when you first realize that pardon through Jesus Christ the sinbearer can you not make glad confession and join this is like poetry and join with the writer in saying that my soul recalls her day of deliverance with delight laden with guilt and full of fear years. I saw my savior as my substitute and I laid my hand upon him. Have you seen your savior as your substitute and laid your hand upon him? How timidly, he says, at first, but courage grew and confidence was confirmed until I leaned my soul entirely upon him. And now it is my unceasing joy to know that my sins are no longer imputed to me but laid on him and like the debts of the wounded traveler Jesus like the good Samaritan has said that all of my future sinfulness set that to my account blessed discovery he says eternal solace of a grateful heart that's what we are to do when we recognize that we need that sacrifice in our lives. Amen. I know we've all done this this morning. I just had this thought, you know, have we ever have we today have we fully leaned into Christ the way that those priests were instructed to lean into their sacrifice with true conviction? Amen. With all your heart because it's more than making contact with that understanding or with a concept. Amen. It's got to go, it's got to go further than that because one will never understand full and true freedom until they've recognized that they are living in sin, separated from God. Because the amazing thing about this process and I we just we touched on this is that even though you would feel guilty and low down and no good, you knew that once that transfer was made and the blood of that animal was on the altar, your sins were covered and that meant more to you than anything else. It meant more to you than the love that you might have had for that animal. You might have been a shepherd and this might have been your friend, but it meant more to you to be back into contact and fellowship with your creator. Amen. And now because Christ Jesus has become the lamb upon the altar for you, it was more than a covering. Amen. At that point it was a covering. But now it was a true atonement. When we come to Christ, you know, something significant takes place. It's more than just it's more than just a surface level contact. Amen. It's it's we come to Christ with our burdens because whether whether you're a Christian or not, you've got burdens. Amen. But but the Christian has somewhere to place those burdens. Let me just express that to you today. You're going to have burdens in this life. You're going to have trials whether you're a Christian or not. But if you're a Christian and you have made contact with the Savior, you have someplace to put those things. Amen. And he has he has an atonement. And he doesn't just have an atonement. He makes a a way for fellowship with you. Amen. He chose you as his habitation. Amen. Glory to God. And we're instructed to lean into those loving arms. Uh my heart was just on fire when I began to think of this. Um I was listening to the prophet. We're going to play a clip here in just a minute as my last few minutes from a sermon Brother Brandon preaches. Um but my heart was on fire for this. I was listening to him and he he just began to talk about the second Adam there in 1 Corinthians where we read. And Paul there in his letter to the Corinthians, he catches the revelation that Christ was the second Adam and not second in the way that our natural minds would perceive it. But Christ did what Adam longed to do. You know, you brother, he makes this clear. You know, Adam wasn't deceived by the serpent. Eve was deceived. But Adam had such a love for Eve that he didn't want to live without her. So, he sinned willfully, separating that fellowship. But when Jesus Christ came, he did what Adam could not do. You know, and this is just I like to think about this. This isn't there's no prophet doesn't say this that I know of, but I like to think that Adam longed to redeem Eve. I like to think that before he willfully did, I I I like to think that he had thoughts in his mind that he longed to have that time back where where before Eve was beguiled. But he he couldn't. He He didn't have that. He didn't have it. But there was something in him because part of Christ was in him. Amen. And Christ came to do what Adam could not do. Amen. So he his only choice was to go to torment with her. Brother Bandom says that. And then Jesus came. Amen. And he knew that no one else could do what he had to do. He went to hell. Let me tell you this this morning. He went to hell so you would not have to. I'm so glad for that. He went to hell so you would not have to. I've always thought it was so incredible when when you read of that and when you read about even with David and with Abselon and you know he he just kept have he had this heart for him and I believe it was because Christ was living in him. There was a part of Christ in him. It was a shadow and he longed to redeem him but he but he but he couldn't. There there was just something that couldn't do it because that was Christ in him. That was that was a part of Jesus living in him. And he longed because he that was his son. That was part of him. Amen. But God came to do what he could not do. Glory to God. It's always it was a shadow. It's always been Christ through through the scriptures. When when when you hear that that Jesus Christ is all through the Old Testament, it's because he is in shadow and type. Amen. If we can get that that clip going. Um, we go ahead and we hopefully play it on the screen. Just enjoy this with me. In the Garden of Eden, I see Adam back there when he put his arms around his little sweetheart to walk out with her. But God had condemned him. And he started out with his arms around his darling and was not deceived. He didn't have to walk out, but he walked out because he loved his wife. That's right. He walked out with both eyes wide open. No matter if she had to go to torment, he had go with her. When God looked down and seen that love of a human being, it was so great that he couldn't stand it himself. That's right. He said, "I'll come and go to" and he said, "I'll put image between her seed and the serpent's seed." Listen closely. 4,000 years later, y'all are in the city of Jerusalem. Let's change our scenes and look there. Come down the streets of Jerusalem. Bumpity bumpity bump out the gates of Damascus go towards Ga. A little fella with a crown and all the thorns on his head and across over his shoulder. Look all over his back, his little red spots. Where are they? Look back at when Adam was leaving with his sweetheart going out under condemnation with a shadow. a shadow of redemption somewhere because there was blood running over him somewhere. That was a shadow. He knew it. And I hear something going, "What is it?" It's the old bloody sheep skin beating up down his leg. Speaking of some There's a lamb beyond the river that they call the sweet forever. And we only reach that shore by degrees, knowing it someday they get back into Eden again. Now I just see him going down there now. The second Adam going up the yellow little spots on his back. They get bigger, bigger, bigger as he walks on. What is it? As you all go into one spot, I hear something beating again. What is it? There goes a second Adam no more than Jehovah himself who come down and was made. What? He'll go to hell with his sweetheart and redeem it back to redeem his bride. Hallelujah. He's seen Adam and he come down with flesh in thunder that he might marry the human race to himself. There he is going out to Calvary as he's moving up the hill and his poor old shoulder rubbing the old bee of death humming around him. It ain't going to be long till I'll get him buzzing all around and around. I had to had to sting him. But friend, you know, if a bee ever stings anybody deeply, he can't sting no more. He pulls his stinger out. So, he hasn't got no more stinger. And I'll tell you, that's the reason God was made flesh here on earth in order to hold the stinger of death. And now the death has no more sting. The beacon harm death free where is our victory but Christ the king and redeemer has made a way of escape our universe believer on this earth today. The bee might harm. The bee might buzz. The bee might try to make you afraid. But I can point G to Calvary where God himself has made flesh. where he helped the stainer of death and took my place as a sinner and paid the price. And he laid out the welcome mat of me to come home. Whosoever will, let him come and drink from the fountains of the waters of life freely. He that comes, I will in no wise cast out. Oh my, no wonder what Paul could say when he heard the axes out there being sharpened. Oh, when I stood in his cell a few days ago where he chopped his head off and he's bringing the axe in, the old bee hung around. He said, "Now I got you." He said, "Death worries your stain." Amen. It was left in Calvary on earth. Grace is a victory. But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. God so loved the world that he gave so love. Adam so loved Eve that he went out with her. Christ so loved the church that he went with her. God so loved the world. Adam went with Eve in her wrong. She was wrong. He knows you're wrong. He was innocent but she was guilty. But Adam said, "I'll go with her." And Christ looked at the church and knowing it was wrong. Yet Christ went with us to take our place hunter as a sinner to die for us to take the sting out of death for us. Sinner, how can you reject such matchless love? No wonder Job said, "I know my redeemer liveth. At the last days he's going to stand upon the earth. And though the skin worms destroys this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God. I'll see him for myself. My eyes shall behold and not another." Do you believe it tonight? are times of swayed from us. Oh, how the Holy Spirit seem to be moving in my heart. I can't think of nothing, friends. Nothing no greater than how that Jesus come down here on earth and made the way of redemption and fulfill every plan come from the garden of Eden. Way before that, before the foundation of the world, Jehovah spoke and here comes Jesus taking his taken a spot and went out here and come and died was made sin that you could be saved. How could you reject such matchless love as that blessed redeemer hanging out of the gods of spit in his face, mockery and scandalized and a crown of thorns on his head, an innome man dying under the blood dripping from Emanuel's veins. Where sinners can plunge beneath the flood, lose all their guilt and shame. Shall we bow our heads? Heavenly Father, oh God, with my heart turning around and around it seems. Amen. knowing that you're here that this morning some someday that they'd get back to Eden again. That's what he said. Amen. The the plan of redemption. There's that's the grand plan. Amen. Hallelujah. There there is a way of escape. You know, don't miss that this morning when we're in service today. Let it be fresh for you. Amen. Go further than making contact with the sacrifice. Lean heavily into it this morning. Amen. Don't let that sacrifice lose its value in your life. Let it be fresh this morning. Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this day, Lord. We're so grateful for the sacrifice that you made for us, Lord. Lord, it's just fresh in our hearts this morning. We're just asking that you'd come and move upon the service, Lord, in a special way, Lord. Grace us once more with your presence. We pray. Be with your people. We love you and we commit the service to you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
