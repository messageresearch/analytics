[3:27] find it so hard to comprehend sometimes
[3:31] when we slip and fall.

[3:42] requests upon their hearts, Father,
[3:45] as our brother spoke before we get up.
[3:47] We could just lay all of our burdens
[3:49] aside. We just bring them to your altar
[3:51] this morning, Father, and we rejoice in
[3:54] the victory that you've brought. Pray
[3:56] that you bless the tithes and offerings,
[3:58] Father. We thank you for the Sunday
[4:01] school lesson. And Lord, we are looking
[4:03] forward to a further breaking of your
[4:04] word, the greatest form of worship.

[36:16] and then they can go and eat lunch and
[36:18] and then make it back on time. And
[36:21] please, senior youth, please plan ahead.
[36:23] Uh don't be at 4:00 and you're in a
[36:26] restaurant still because you went too
[36:28] far and then it was a long wait. So plan
[36:30] ahead. Um go go to Burger King, get
[36:33] something unhealthy, gobble it down, get
[36:36] back here, and be inside. Amen. Praise
[36:39] the Lord. So, so um those who fail to
[36:43] plan plan to fail.
[36:47] Amen.
[36:48] Man, learned that in business school.
[36:50] Those who plan, those who fail to plan,
[36:53] plan to fail. Amen. So, a lot of times,
[36:56] you know, people who work with me know
[36:58] that a long time ago, I learned a
[37:00] philosophy from brother Ernie Villoeva.
[37:03] He said, "Brother Jason," he said, "Uh,
[37:05] as long as you always inspect what you
[37:07] expect, you'll never get surprised or be
[37:09] disappointed." So, a lot of times I'll
[37:11] ask somebody something I know they
[37:12] already know, and I know they've already
[37:14] done it. But I say, "Now, I'm just
[37:16] inspecting what I'm expecting." Amen.
[37:19] So, praise the Lord. Helps me deal with
[37:21] my OCD and stay normal.
[37:24] Um there is no Wednesday service this
[37:29] week because we're postpon we're pushing
[37:32] it forward. There is a midweek but it
[37:35] starts on Friday. That's really not
[37:36] midweek. It's the end of the week. So
[37:39] our uh our meetings will begin uh on
[37:42] Friday with brother Donnie. Now
[37:43] consequently there will be brother Brad
[37:46] and sister Sarah will be conducting the
[37:48] final senior youth choir practice before
[37:51] the meetings begin on Wednesday. So
[37:53] that'll be at 6:30. So, uh, all the
[37:56] senior youth, please plan like you
[37:58] normally would to be at church. Amen. Be
[38:02] here a little early and get you home a
[38:03] little early. So, um, all right. So,
[38:06] we've got the the practice immediately
[38:08] after service today. Sister Jean's
[38:10] presentation starts promptly at 4. Uh,
[38:13] there's no Wednesday regular service.
[38:16] It's moved to Friday. There will be the
[38:18] final senior youth choir practice on
[38:22] Wednesday at 6:30. Our special meetings
[38:24] with brother Donnie will begin Friday,
[38:27] Friday evening and Saturday evening at
[38:29] 700 p.m. Sunday morning at 11. There'll
[38:32] be no Sunday school classes. We'll have
[38:34] those three straight services. I was
[38:37] hoping uh to get pastor uh Ibuka here
[38:41] from Nigeria and had he been able to
[38:44] come, it's not completely ruled out, but
[38:47] it doesn't look likely. Uh then we we
[38:49] want him to be able to come if he can
[38:52] make it uh for these meetings. We may
[38:55] have a service Saturday morning where he
[38:58] will give his testimony of being
[39:00] kidnapped. uh leaving his pull pit, went
[39:03] home after church on Sunday morning
[39:04] after preaching, was taken by gunpoint
[39:07] at his car uh and held for 30 days and
[39:10] threatened to die, threatened to kill
[39:12] him. And it's a a it's a it's a spine
[39:14] tingling. I just heard an overview of it
[39:16] and it is gripping uh and and how that
[39:19] God was moving supernaturally uh in that
[39:22] whole thing. And so there's there's a
[39:24] lot to tell and um and yes, thank you,
[39:28] sir. There's a lot to tell. And so he he
[39:30] not only wants to tell the details of
[39:32] it, but he wants to tell all of the um
[39:36] you know uh things that he learned while
[39:39] that was happening. Don't forget,
[39:41] brother Matt uh posted that the men's
[39:43] breakfast uh will be uh coming on on
[39:47] Saturday morning. Now, if we we we'll
[39:51] figure out how to do that. If brother uh
[39:53] Pastor Brook can make it, we'll figure
[39:56] that out. There's a Saturday morning
[39:57] men's breakfast. Brother Doug will be
[39:59] coming. Amen. To uh be here for that.
[40:01] And so we're looking forward to having
[40:03] his help during the meetings. But you,
[40:05] if you're going to make that breakfast,
[40:07] please do the nonbethal tabernacle thing
[40:11] and actually RSVP to Brother Bradley
[40:14] Campbell. Amen. So for one time, don't
[40:17] be a homie. And
[40:20] three people have RSVPd. So brothers,
[40:24] please uh do the right thing.
[40:28] not the Bethl thing and actually RSVP
[40:32] and let brother Bradley know he's the
[40:34] one who coordinates and lets us know the
[40:36] count and who all we're going to have.
[40:37] So, it's highly important so we don't,
[40:40] you know, waste a bunch of money buying
[40:41] too much food. And like I say, if
[40:43] anything changes with brother Ibuka
[40:46] coming, we'll make sure we let you know
[40:48] uh promptly. Amen. I'd love for him to
[40:51] come in on Thursday and uh you know and
[40:54] maybe uh brother Brad have him with the
[40:56] senior youth. That would be amazing. I
[40:58] promise you he's he's a young pastor and
[41:01] uh the Lord has done wonderful things in
[41:04] his ministry. So that's all coming.
[41:07] Amen. All right, Ra, thank you honey. So
[41:10] also there is um getting updates here on
[41:14] in real time. Um, there's a meal after
[41:18] Friday night and Saturday night service.
[41:21] Okay. Now, we're not going to have filet
[41:24] minan steak and lobster. No, but there
[41:27] will be food served and I think they've
[41:30] got a plan for that. I think brother
[41:31] Jay's involved in that. So, doing some
[41:33] barbecue. So, that'll be Friday night
[41:35] and Saturday night after each service.
[41:39] And we're arranging it. Let me just say
[41:41] that I've I've tasked my daughter-in-law
[41:45] to make sure that it's set up in a way
[41:48] that I don't have people out there
[41:50] slaving away while the word is being
[41:52] preached in here. I don't even like to
[41:54] see that. So, so, so we're we're working
[41:57] it in a way that we want all of our
[42:00] preparers and cooks and everybody who's
[42:02] involved with that, we're arranging it
[42:04] so that you can be in the service. We
[42:07] want you in the service, not out there.
[42:10] uh running around trying to get food.
[42:11] The most important thing is the
[42:12] spiritual food. Amen. So uh so so you'll
[42:16] you'll see that it's arranged that way.
[42:18] We don't want to see I don't want to see
[42:21] young people milling around. Even
[42:22] visitors, we're going to uh kind of
[42:25] deputize a few extra deacons to help
[42:27] Brother Luther like we do at our at our
[42:29] youth camp. And so they will they will
[42:32] be making periodic patrols to make sure
[42:34] you're not people aren't meandering.
[42:36] Adults or young people are not going to
[42:38] be allowed just to meander around. We
[42:39] want them in where the word is being
[42:41] ministered. If we have an overflow, they
[42:43] have a plan for that. Amen. So, God
[42:46] bless you. Amen. This morning. Amen. I
[42:50] hope that's uh all clear. You've had
[42:52] already announcements in the church
[42:53] chat. There'll be follow-ups to that.
[42:55] So, just be on the lookout. Amen. Second
[42:57] Kings chapter 2. Amen. I'm starting
[43:00] late, so is that okay? It's I had I had
[43:03] these announcements I needed to make and
[43:05] so um we want to now get to the word.
[43:07] So, don't start my timer until now.
[43:10] Amen. And then make sure you save me a
[43:13] big chunk of overtime because I've got
[43:16] uh a maddening amount of material that I
[43:19] want so bad to get to today. It's been
[43:21] an extremely stressful thing on this
[43:23] series. I will say that on the onset to
[43:26] because every time I think I've okay,
[43:29] I've got it. the windows of heaven open
[43:31] and the Lord just keeps piling stuff in.
[43:33] And I think I'm stressing my own self
[43:35] trying to go go through it and say,
[43:38] "Okay, that's it. We're going to do it."
[43:39] And uh and so today, I'm just going to
[43:42] once again not wor not watch that clock.
[43:45] If you see me glance at it, it'll be an
[43:47] accident. And uh and I'm going to try to
[43:49] not look at at into your faces. And uh
[43:53] but at the same time I I I I will keep
[43:57] my um my way of not wearing you out. And
[44:00] I don't do that just because of some you
[44:03] know idiosyncrasy. I have a I have a
[44:05] purpose in that because I know the human
[44:07] mind can only absorb so much. I learned
[44:09] that in school. It's why they it's why
[44:11] the classes are this many minutes. And
[44:13] so so I don't want you to lose sight.
[44:16] But at the same time I also want you to
[44:18] see the whole picture. Amen. Now, I
[44:21] still haven't started yet. Okay, praise
[44:24] the Lord. And we're happy to have any
[44:26] visitors here with us today. God bless
[44:28] you. Sorry if I haven't greeted you. 2
[44:30] Kings chapter 2 and we're going to start
[44:33] from verse 8, I believe, is what I said.
[44:37] 2 Kings chapter 2 verse 8.
[44:43] You know the story of Elisha following
[44:46] Elijah and they went from place to place
[44:48] to place. And I'm not going to go into
[44:50] all of that. I think even some of the
[44:52] other brothers have some burden on their
[44:54] heart in those areas. So I'm just going
[44:56] to try to stick where where I want to
[44:58] zero in on verse 8. And Elijah took his
[45:01] mantle. He's at the Jordan. Now this is
[45:03] an important point. He's at the Jordan
[45:05] River. See, don't now how many remember
[45:08] Jordan means death to self.
[45:10] Amen.
[45:11] That's huge. Jordan means death to self.
[45:15] All right. And he took his mantle and
[45:18] wrapped it together and smoked the
[45:20] waters. And they were divided hither and
[45:22] thither, so that they too went over on
[45:26] dry ground. This is Elijah and Elisha.
[45:28] And it came to pass when they were gone
[45:30] over that Elijah said unto Elisha, "Ask
[45:34] what I shall do for thee before I be
[45:36] taken away from thee." And Elisha said,
[45:40] I pray thee, let a double portion of thy
[45:42] spirit be upon me. And he said, Thou has
[45:44] asked a hard thing. Nevertheless, if
[45:46] thou see me, when I am taken from thee,
[45:50] it shall be so unto thee. But if not, it
[45:52] shall not be so. Wow. And it came to
[45:56] pass as they went on and talked that
[45:58] behold, there appeared chariot, a
[46:00] chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and
[46:02] parted them both a sunder, and Elijah
[46:04] went up by the whirlwind into heaven.
[46:07] So, all right. So, so Elijah is taken
[46:10] away much like we're going to be taken
[46:12] away in the rapture. All right. So Eli
[46:15] and Elisha saw it and he cried, "My
[46:17] father, my father, the chariot of
[46:19] Israel, and the horsemen thereof." And
[46:21] he saw him no more. And he took hold of
[46:23] his own clothes and rent them into
[46:26] pieces. That's a big point. He took up
[46:28] also the mantle of Elijah that fell from
[46:30] him and went back and stood by the bank
[46:33] of Jordan. And he took the mantle of
[46:35] Elijah that fell from him and smoked the
[46:38] waters and said, "Where is the Lord God
[46:40] of Elijah?" And when he also had smitten
[46:43] the waters, they parted hither and
[46:45] thither, and Elijah went over. Amen.
[46:49] Let's pray. Father, we thank you for
[46:52] your word today. We ask for your divine
[46:55] grace and mercy, Lord, uh upon our
[46:59] spiritual meal today. We're asking for
[47:02] your help that we can keep it together
[47:05] and go in a way that's Lord that is that
[47:09] is beneficial to your people. We commit
[47:12] it to you. Be with my human spirit now
[47:14] Lord. Keep me under your perfect
[47:16] control. Let me not predetermine. Lord,
[47:20] I'm not in control of this. You are. So
[47:22] now I humble myself before you in Jesus
[47:25] name. Amen. God bless you friends. you
[47:28] can be seated.
[47:30] So, the only thing I know to do today is
[47:34] to just uh be loyal to how the Lord has
[47:38] led me and uh in the order that I
[47:41] believe that he has led me and uh that's
[47:44] really all I can do and that's all I can
[47:46] be responsible for and we will we will
[47:50] make sure that we get hopefully we'll
[47:52] get everywhere that we need to get to.
[47:55] All right. So,
[47:59] praise the Lord. You love him.
[48:03] All right. So, that's going to be
[48:05] already the wrong thing. Excuse me one
[48:08] second.
[48:11] I need this one.
[48:14] Voila.
[48:16] Okay. So, now
[48:19] I want to um just make a few opening
[48:23] comments and then we're going to go
[48:25] straight to my PowerPoint. Brother
[48:26] Ethan, you'll be running it for me, I
[48:28] suppose. All right. I I don't want to
[48:30] deal with the clicker, so you can just
[48:32] handle that for me. Man, love having
[48:34] good, reliable, trained people. Amen.
[48:37] So, you know, when they when they come
[48:40] to this crossing, there's a number of
[48:42] points, a lot of points that I could
[48:44] make. As I said, I don't want to get too
[48:46] bogged down in it, but but a couple of
[48:49] the points that I want to make is one
[48:51] that I've already made, and that is that
[48:53] Jordan is death to self. I nearly titled
[48:56] this as a subtitle today. I nearly put
[48:59] in a subtitle, death to self. I didn't,
[49:01] but you can just know that's the real
[49:04] aim of my heart today. Death to self.
[49:07] And so, so when we when they come here,
[49:10] you notice you're going to notice
[49:12] brother Brandham in a couple of quotes
[49:13] that I've got. He's going to point out
[49:15] if I get to it, how that he it's notable
[49:18] to him in the Bible that when Elisha
[49:23] when that mantle fell from Elijah, that
[49:26] the first thing Elij Elisha did was tear
[49:30] his own garment away from him. And
[49:33] brother Brandham is going to show how
[49:35] that that's what you've got to do to
[49:37] receive the spirit of Christ. You've got
[49:39] to die to self. You've got to tear your
[49:41] own self apart and receive the engrafted
[49:45] word. In other words, receive the very
[49:47] real presence and power of God into your
[49:51] life. How many would like to have that
[49:53] be a reality in their life? Amen. And
[49:56] so, so now when we when we continue to
[49:59] look at all of this, we find that that
[50:02] that brother that in the in our
[50:04] scripture, we find that, you know, he's
[50:07] asked a he's asked a hard thing. And I I
[50:10] so appreciate uh a brother Matt made a
[50:13] statement. And I heard him preaching
[50:14] along these lines recently that it
[50:16] wasn't hard for Elijah and it wasn't
[50:20] hard for Jehovah. But where the real
[50:23] work would come would be to Elisha. You
[50:26] want a double portion. You've asked a
[50:29] difficult thing. You you're never going
[50:32] to get that Elisha if you're just uh
[50:35] infected, you know, with the with the
[50:38] spirit of the age. And let me just bring
[50:40] it down to the day and hour that you and
[50:42] I live in. Remember, he said to him, if
[50:45] you can do this and you see me when I
[50:47] go, then you'll have it. But if you're
[50:50] not diligent, if you don't follow on, if
[50:52] you don't stay right close, if you if
[50:54] you're too lazy, if you're too worldly,
[50:56] if you're too carnal, then then then
[50:59] forget this double portion working on
[51:01] you. Not saying, Elisha that you're not
[51:04] a child of God. I'm just simply saying
[51:06] you're not going to be one of those
[51:08] doing great exploits at the last day.
[51:10] Say, "Well, I, you know, I don't care if
[51:12] I do spectacular stuff." That
[51:14] spectacular stuff might be casting a
[51:16] demon off of your child.
[51:20] That spectacular stuff might be rescuing
[51:22] a marriage.
[51:24] We're not talking about calling fire
[51:26] down. We're talking about real life. And
[51:28] brother Brandham in perfect faith said
[51:30] the reason he was preaching perfect
[51:32] faith is because you've had a faith but
[51:35] he said but I'm don't I'm now I'm coming
[51:37] to a perfect faith. This was something
[51:39] now further than the faith that was in
[51:41] the ages. And he said I'm preaching on
[51:43] it because trust me down the road you're
[51:47] going to need it.
[51:49] Amen.
[51:50] Amen.
[51:51] See, and so so that's why you know when
[51:54] they went those those 50 uh school of
[51:57] the prophets went, you know, they they
[51:59] went to they went to look for Elijah and
[52:02] and brother Brandham makes an amazing
[52:04] statement there. Let me try to get to it
[52:06] really quick. Um so he says, so let me
[52:09] see here if I can find it. Yeah, I got
[52:11] it. So brother Brandham says, "So they
[52:13] said unto him, you know, behold now
[52:15] there be with thy servants 50 strong
[52:17] men. Let them go. we pray thee and seek
[52:19] thy master, lest per adventure the
[52:21] spirit of the Lord hath taken him up and
[52:23] cast him upon some mountain and into
[52:25] some valley. And Elisha said he you
[52:28] shall not sinned. There's there's there
[52:31] don't you you're going to go about it
[52:32] the wrong way. See, and so so you know,
[52:35] it's a lot of times I I remember years
[52:38] ago looking at that and I said, you
[52:40] know, the the spirit of Elijah is now
[52:43] resting on Elisha. So there's no need
[52:46] for 50 return ministry preachers to go
[52:49] looking for Elijah.
[52:51] Amen.
[52:52] You understand?
[52:54] Wouldn't do you any you won't find him
[52:55] cuz he went home
[52:57] and you you're you're and and so the the
[52:59] point is now the the ministry that was
[53:01] on him is now upon Elisha.
[53:04] Mrs. Jesus,
[53:06] you understand? So, so brother Ben
[53:08] Brandham said, you know, here in uh
[53:11] getting getting in the spirit, he said,
[53:14] you know, go on cuz the next verse we
[53:17] didn't read, they urged him. They kept
[53:18] pressing him. And finally, Elisha said,
[53:20] go on, but you won't find him.
[53:22] You know, hard-headed people, carry on.
[53:25] See, uh, refuse to see the further
[53:27] light, refuse to see the progression of
[53:29] the word. Go ahead,
[53:31] go back and try to live back. Go try to
[53:33] relive all of those stories. But but the
[53:36] word is now on the move. And there's a
[53:38] double portion. That's that's to that's
[53:41] to have a benefit in Israel.
[53:43] See, so brother Brennham says getting in
[53:46] the spirit said, "Go on, but you'll not
[53:48] find him. Make fun of me. Call me an
[53:50] idiot if you want to, but God has you'll
[53:54] you'll never find him in your organized
[53:57] system." See, they were a school. You'll
[53:59] never find him in your organized
[54:00] systems. No, sir. He was lifted up and
[54:03] he comes again in the form of the
[54:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And you'll
[54:07] never educate people to it. They've got
[54:09] to be born again. Got to be the baptism
[54:12] of the Holy Spirit. Nothing short of
[54:14] that.
[54:15] So, it's not about a school of the
[54:17] prophets. It's not about chasing
[54:18] something from yester year. It's about
[54:21] the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[54:24] You're not gonna find him in organized
[54:26] religion of man-made creed. All right.
[54:30] So, so now I want to take a look at a
[54:33] number of statements brother Brandham
[54:35] makes that are familiar to us and we we
[54:39] look at these as as something to be
[54:44] ahead of us. At the same time, we have
[54:47] to be very careful that we don't imagine
[54:51] because here here's what's happened.
[54:53] You're going to read, you're going to
[54:54] read with me, brother Brandham talking
[54:57] about a power that's to come upon the
[55:00] church.
[55:01] There's an anointing that that's to come
[55:03] upon the church that agrees with the
[55:06] scripture. On the last day, the people
[55:09] who know their God will do great
[55:12] exploits.
[55:13] But now bear in mind, it's not the
[55:15] people who have a mental concept knowing
[55:17] him. It's the people who know him. Like
[55:20] a husband knows a wife in a in a
[55:22] relationship. It's much further than a
[55:24] head knowledge. The people who really
[55:26] know him, the people who are really
[55:28] close to him. It's amazing that you can
[55:29] see marriages go for years sometimes.
[55:32] And and I I've had situations where you
[55:36] can see a marriage that's decades long
[55:38] and they're sitting there, you know, for
[55:40] counseling and she's saying about him or
[55:43] he's saying about her, "I don't even
[55:44] think he knows me.
[55:47] If he thinks that, he he don't even know
[55:49] me. If she thinks that, she don't even
[55:51] know me."
[55:52] See? And so, so, uh, when you're in a
[55:54] marriage relationship, it it it's not
[55:57] sufficient just to wear a ring and have
[55:59] a license, live in the same house, sleep
[56:02] in the same bed, and produce children.
[56:04] See, so, so, so, you know, a lot of men,
[56:08] they certainly have proven that they
[56:10] know how to bring children and they know
[56:12] how to sew seed and bring forth
[56:14] children. But have they proven that they
[56:16] can be a high priest and lead a family?
[56:19] Amen.
[56:19] Have they Have they been able to prove
[56:21] that?
[56:22] See, bringing children into the world is
[56:24] just nature taking its course. But I'm
[56:27] here to tell you it it the the world
[56:29] that we live in is trying to destroy
[56:32] manhood, trying to destroy w ladies,
[56:35] trying to trying to crisscross the
[56:37] genders, trying to bring bring insanity.
[56:39] And this is a time where we need real
[56:41] men and real women who know their God.
[56:49] Now that's not that's not unusual that
[56:51] brother Brandham it's not new these
[56:54] quotes I'm going to read you but what we
[56:57] have had is these quotes have been read
[56:59] for 60 years
[57:02] and periodic and all through those 60
[57:06] years we've had supermen rise with their
[57:10] super doctrines and their super camps
[57:13] and their super anointings trying to
[57:16] force this to come.
[57:18] You understand? Running and and and and
[57:21] and the reason that it always flames out
[57:24] and ends up with a lot of brokenhearted
[57:26] people because they they made it a thing
[57:31] and it's something to chase and we got
[57:33] we got and it's a golden pot at the end
[57:35] of the rainbow. And when they get to the
[57:37] end of the rainbow after two decades of
[57:38] chasing it, there's no golden pot.
[57:42] Young people are disillusioned. Married
[57:44] couples are disillusioned. People jump
[57:46] out and leave. Oh, there's nothing to
[57:48] it. They leave the message and then
[57:49] become almost atheistic. See? And so,
[57:53] Brother Brandham warned us not to do
[57:55] that. See, that we are to we are to stay
[57:59] in the word and stay humble and be
[58:02] Christians and be real and be full of
[58:04] the Holy Spirit and and get the world
[58:06] out of your home and get the get the
[58:08] leaven. Go go go go go through your home
[58:10] with a candle of God's word and keep the
[58:12] leaven out and keep the token applied.
[58:15] You don't have to go make yourself odd.
[58:18] Brother Brandon, when he saw the seven
[58:19] seals and that part flew across that, he
[58:22] said, "I saw it fly across, but I
[58:24] couldn't make it out. It was in another
[58:26] language." He said, "It's just not quite
[58:28] the time for it."
[58:30] Amen.
[58:31] So, this this strikes people in
[58:34] sensationalism. They chase it and chase
[58:36] it and chase it and and I'm here to tell
[58:38] you that that it's never been a thing to
[58:40] chase. It's all about self-denial and
[58:43] being a real Christian. And God is now
[58:45] coming in the hour that you live in. And
[58:47] I'm here to tell you, friends, there are
[58:49] things that are happening in rapid fire
[58:51] around this world that God is now
[58:53] beginning to pour out. And I am
[58:55] convinced that we are on the threshold
[58:58] of these very things that the prophet
[59:00] said all those years ago. And if there
[59:02] was ever a time when we need to be
[59:04] dedicated and humble and sincere before
[59:08] God,
[59:09] we're not here to chase something. We're
[59:11] here to make ourselves ready for God to
[59:14] bring it down upon us. I'm here to tell
[59:16] you, it's not something coming. I
[59:18] believe it's in the atmosphere happening
[59:20] right now. And the only thing we need to
[59:22] do is elevate up into that realm.
[59:29] It's not going to be a man-made effort.
[59:31] It's not going to be charisma.
[59:33] It's not going to be some somebody with
[59:36] some super duper something.
[59:39] We were told not to chase that.
[59:41] See, let's take a look at a few of them.
[59:44] I'm going to go chronologically in a
[59:46] chronological order.
[59:49] First, we'll start in 1960. There's I'm
[59:52] not reading them all. I'm just catching
[59:54] a few. There's a number of places. These
[59:56] to me have been some of the most notable
[59:59] in the message. Uh, let's have my
[1:00:01] PowerPoint, ETH. So, we'll we'll go
[1:00:04] immediately to slide one. This is be not
[1:00:06] afraid. It is I.
[1:00:09] All right. Hope you can make that out.
[1:00:13] And now being that tonight, now let me
[1:00:16] just say, don't read ahead. Let me just
[1:00:19] say, brother Brandham has already at
[1:00:21] this point had a number of experiences
[1:00:23] in the third pole. Understand? Some
[1:00:26] amazing things have already taken place.
[1:00:28] And brother Brandham is saying now being
[1:00:30] that tonight is rather pushing for the
[1:00:33] service of healing or praying for the
[1:00:34] sick. We want to say I want to make this
[1:00:36] statement. The reason I haven't had any
[1:00:39] healing lines this week, there's been
[1:00:41] something that's been on my heart. And I
[1:00:45] told you last time I was here, there was
[1:00:47] a new ministry coming. Remember it went
[1:00:49] first pull, second pull, and now the
[1:00:50] third pull is coming. A new ministry
[1:00:52] coming. I spoke with some of the
[1:00:54] brethren today and was telling them
[1:00:57] about what's happened.
[1:01:00] Just remember
[1:01:02] that the first time I was here, you
[1:01:05] remember the Lord had told me something
[1:01:07] was going to happen, change in the
[1:01:08] ministry. It happened. Said another
[1:01:10] one's going to happen and it happened.
[1:01:12] And each time those pulls would change,
[1:01:15] Brother Brandon would catch a notice of
[1:01:17] it. And he said, "You'll see a certain
[1:01:18] thing. There'll be a man come in. He'll
[1:01:20] be wearing a brown suit and blah blah
[1:01:21] blah. And right away you'll know the
[1:01:22] secrets of his heart. And that
[1:01:24] transition from pull one to pull two.
[1:01:26] Pull one didn't go away. It still
[1:01:28] operated. But now it's a it's a further
[1:01:31] work. You understand? So he says here
[1:01:34] now there's another one greater far
[1:01:38] greater than all the rest of them put
[1:01:41] together already confirmed and ready. I
[1:01:44] hope it happens tonight. I just might
[1:01:45] say that. I don't have time to explain
[1:01:47] it to you. But the brethren who does
[1:01:50] know about it, it's wonderful. Watch
[1:01:52] this now. It be such a great thing for
[1:01:55] the people. And I am grateful to God
[1:01:58] that the hour is soon at hand. I believe
[1:02:00] it when God is going to help his
[1:02:04] children. Stay right there. God's going
[1:02:06] to help his children. Now you have to
[1:02:09] understand that
[1:02:11] brother Brandham himself is over time
[1:02:15] progressively gradually understanding it
[1:02:19] more and more and more and more.
[1:02:21] I've shown you that in the in the
[1:02:23] preaching prior prior weeks where
[1:02:25] brother Brandham is even sometimes
[1:02:27] thinking it's going to go this way and
[1:02:29] it goes that way and he's like oh okay
[1:02:31] let's go this way only to find out got
[1:02:33] you again it's actually going to go this
[1:02:34] way. Oh wow. Okay. So, let's go this
[1:02:37] way. And all all a prophet can do is
[1:02:40] keep following the Lord. That's all he
[1:02:42] can do. That's all we can do. We can't
[1:02:45] run ahead and figure all of this out. We
[1:02:47] I can see certain things that are common
[1:02:50] denominators. And one of the things that
[1:02:52] I see as a common denominator every time
[1:02:54] Brother Brandham is talking about this
[1:02:56] third pull operating, we find that he
[1:02:59] says he goes back to repentance and
[1:03:02] dedication and consecration. And I've
[1:03:04] been saying that to you over and over
[1:03:06] and over again. God's not coming with
[1:03:09] Barnaman Bailey.
[1:03:11] This isn't a three- ring circus. This
[1:03:13] isn't the charismatic movement.
[1:03:16] You understand? This is not that. This
[1:03:18] is not some some revival of past. This
[1:03:20] isn't a revival that's striking Asbury
[1:03:22] College. That's fine. We've got
[1:03:24] scripture. We know what that is.
[1:03:26] That's not the bride's revival at any by
[1:03:29] any means. But it is assigned to us that
[1:03:32] that way. If God is doing that, he's
[1:03:34] also moving here. And I got quotes to
[1:03:36] support that.
[1:03:39] So he he he moves on. All right. Now,
[1:03:43] there's another one. Greater, far
[1:03:45] greater. Okay. It's going to help his
[1:03:46] children. Um I think we read that one.
[1:03:49] Yeah, we it's going to help his
[1:03:51] children. Especially,
[1:03:53] it'll be for those who can't muster the
[1:03:56] faith to raise up and get a hold of God
[1:03:59] like they should. I believe the Lord,
[1:04:02] you have no idea how how wonderful this
[1:04:05] is for a pastor's heart.
[1:04:07] I believe the Lord is providing a way
[1:04:09] for us now to take care of them. Also,
[1:04:13] some runs into faith that they can just
[1:04:15] reach over and receive anything. Why?
[1:04:17] That's great faith. Some of them has
[1:04:19] mustard seed faith and has to wait so
[1:04:21] long to get through. I believe the Lord
[1:04:23] is making a way for those people now.
[1:04:26] And I don't know when it will be, but it
[1:04:28] will be. Just as certain as I'm standing
[1:04:30] here,
[1:04:32] it will be.
[1:04:33] So, I'm here to tell you something,
[1:04:35] friends. There's a power coming in this
[1:04:37] word that's going to help you get past
[1:04:40] mustard seed faith and the things that
[1:04:42] you've struggled so hard in your
[1:04:43] humanity. And and it's just a grabag of
[1:04:46] life. We're all built and made
[1:04:47] different. We are the sum of our
[1:04:48] experiences. Your your thinking is is is
[1:04:51] informed by your experiences. And and
[1:04:53] and the bottom line is that most of us
[1:04:56] are some some messed up, jacked up,
[1:04:59] broken down. We've got trauma in life
[1:05:02] and trauma from our birth and trauma in
[1:05:04] other churches and trauma and and man
[1:05:06] born of a woman's few days and full of
[1:05:08] trouble. And we've had a lot of trouble
[1:05:09] and you've been the bullseye of the
[1:05:11] enemy. And sometimes our minds are just
[1:05:14] all over the place. But my heart looks
[1:05:16] to God. And I'm here to tell you, there
[1:05:18] is something among us now that's
[1:05:21] dropping upon us now that God is going
[1:05:23] to say, "All of your weaknesses, I'm not
[1:05:25] going to stop it. And all of your
[1:05:27] conflicts, I'm going to go right over
[1:05:28] it. I'm going to lift you up above the
[1:05:31] shadows."
[1:05:34] Amen.
[1:05:37] So he comes now to what shall I now?
[1:05:39] This is November 12, 1963. What shall I
[1:05:41] do with Jesus called Christ?
[1:05:44] The dynamics of this church
[1:05:47] will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit
[1:05:52] that we have worked in a small measure
[1:05:55] while the headstone is coming down to
[1:05:56] unite with the body. But when that head
[1:05:59] and body unites together, the full power
[1:06:01] of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:03] would raise her up just exactly like
[1:06:05] that. Even the dead that's dead in
[1:06:07] Christ for hundreds of years ago will
[1:06:10] rise in the beauty of his holiness and
[1:06:11] take a flight to the skies.
[1:06:14] The dynamics is the Holy Spirit. Now
[1:06:17] hold right there.
[1:06:19] So we realize that, you know, when
[1:06:23] you're born again of the spirit of God,
[1:06:26] you're not translated in all three of
[1:06:29] your realms yet. You see, it's not your
[1:06:32] body that died, brother Brandham said,
[1:06:33] or your spirit that died, but it's your
[1:06:36] nature. That soul, that old fallen
[1:06:39] nature was annihilated, but you still
[1:06:41] live in an unredeemed body. Hence, the
[1:06:44] greatest battle ever fought. Now, you've
[1:06:46] actually got a battle cuz now the inner
[1:06:48] man's in heavenly places with Christ
[1:06:49] Jesus commanding the body to follow the
[1:06:51] word. But the fallen nature in the flesh
[1:06:54] is still saying, "But I still want to
[1:06:55] party and have fun and be popular and I
[1:06:57] and I and I want to have likes and and
[1:06:59] and clicks and I want to have all this
[1:07:01] kind of stuff." And the Holy Spirit is
[1:07:02] saying, "Abandon that. Abandon that.
[1:07:04] Come to Christ. Come to the word."
[1:07:07] And so we we live a process of of
[1:07:11] growing in grace and growing in strength
[1:07:14] and growing in wisdom and growing in
[1:07:16] understanding. But it's a it's a it's a
[1:07:20] um a flawed concept
[1:07:23] to imagine that you you know there there
[1:07:26] there is a something that floated for
[1:07:29] years and you know and to where you say
[1:07:32] well when I'm born again but then I I've
[1:07:36] got to start growing and get mature and
[1:07:38] then I get adopted and that's that's a
[1:07:41] that's an inside out upside down way to
[1:07:43] look at it that when you're born again
[1:07:45] you are adopted into the family.
[1:07:48] That's what adoption is. You've been
[1:07:49] adopted into Christ through the baptism
[1:07:51] of the Holy Spirit and new birth. Sure,
[1:07:53] you're a child. Sure, you got to grow.
[1:07:55] But I'm here to tell you, from the day
[1:07:57] you are filled with the Holy Ghost, you
[1:07:58] are fully empowered to cast out devils,
[1:08:01] pray for the sick, you're fully
[1:08:03] empowered to witness around the world.
[1:08:05] You have all of heaven right behind you.
[1:08:08] Amen.
[1:08:08] God may not throw you into a pull pit
[1:08:11] until you get some training, but I'm
[1:08:12] here to tell you, you're in no way less
[1:08:15] than a than a son and daughter of God
[1:08:17] with the token on display.
[1:08:20] And when you walk down the street, if
[1:08:22] you walk down the street with the Holy
[1:08:25] Ghost on display, whether it's been for
[1:08:27] five days, five minutes, or five years,
[1:08:30] demons howl and faint as you approach.
[1:08:35] Amen.
[1:08:37] Hallelujah.
[1:08:38] The fullness of adoption is the change
[1:08:40] of the body.
[1:08:42] So, so we, so we realize then that
[1:08:45] brother Brandham is showing here that on
[1:08:47] that day when the dead for thousands of
[1:08:49] years shall raise, when the when the
[1:08:51] headstone and the and the and the has
[1:08:53] come down upon the body and the dead in
[1:08:56] Christ have risen and we which are alive
[1:08:58] and remain are changed in a moment, in
[1:08:59] the twinkling of an eye, then of course
[1:09:01] that's full adoption. That's full power.
[1:09:04] That's that's that's when the the
[1:09:06] dynamics will be applied to the
[1:09:08] mechanics. And brother Brad said it like
[1:09:10] this. Mechanics become dynamics.
[1:09:15] Now that sounds cryptic until you
[1:09:17] realize. Okay. So he said he described a
[1:09:20] car with that with all the mechanics.
[1:09:23] Perfect. The engine, the
[1:09:25] everything works. The tires,
[1:09:26] everything's everything's great. The car
[1:09:28] has no problem. It has a tank full of
[1:09:30] gas, but it still needs a fire. to eat
[1:09:33] spark.
[1:09:34] See, he said if the gasoline doesn't get
[1:09:36] the spark, it might as well be water for
[1:09:38] all the good it would do you. Now, it's
[1:09:40] not water. But if it doesn't get the
[1:09:42] spark of the Holy Ghost, it might as
[1:09:43] well be.
[1:09:45] See, just like you before you came to
[1:09:47] know the Lord in a new birth. You were
[1:09:49] always a gene child, a geneed child of
[1:09:52] God, but you differed nothing from a
[1:09:54] servant. Though actually, you were Lord
[1:09:56] of all, but you had no allotment to you
[1:09:58] because you weren't born again. But once
[1:10:00] you're born again of the Holy Spirit,
[1:10:02] now you're not just an heir of God,
[1:10:03] you're a joint heir with Christ. So now
[1:10:05] it's not just that you have an
[1:10:07] allotment, but something's actually been
[1:10:08] allotted to you. And so, so when the
[1:10:11] spark strikes the gas, then the car will
[1:10:13] go down the road. And so when brother
[1:10:15] Brandham says dynamics that he says
[1:10:18] mechanics, which is the word we're
[1:10:20] feeding on, that that that when all of
[1:10:22] this happens, the dead in Christ rise
[1:10:24] and we are changed. that that's the
[1:10:26] fullness of mechanics, the word becoming
[1:10:30] dynamics.
[1:10:31] Amen.
[1:10:32] And you say, "Well, I'm not I can't get
[1:10:34] a picture of that." Go get a tub of
[1:10:37] gasoline and drop a match, a lit match
[1:10:40] into it.
[1:10:42] Mechanics become dynamics,
[1:10:45] immediately.
[1:10:47] You understand? It's not a gradual
[1:10:49] process. You take a fire and drop it
[1:10:52] into fuel, that fuel becomes the fire.
[1:10:57] You got me? Mechanics become dynamics.
[1:11:01] So now, now the the the thing of it is
[1:11:04] we're not sitting back sitting on our
[1:11:07] luggage waiting on the old ship of Zion.
[1:11:10] As soon as I'm saying just be a
[1:11:11] Christian and just be humble and just
[1:11:13] serve God and God will do it. But I'm
[1:11:15] here to tell you something, friends.
[1:11:16] There ought to be a pursuit in your
[1:11:18] spirit to say, Lord, let me grow high in
[1:11:21] the power and presence of almighty God.
[1:11:23] Let me learn to use your word. Let me
[1:11:26] learn to have faith. Teach me thy ways.
[1:11:30] And sometimes we call that the process
[1:11:33] of adoption. But don't ever think of
[1:11:35] that as as as suddenly up the road
[1:11:38] somewhere you actually become a sealed
[1:11:41] in son of God. You're sealed by the Holy
[1:11:42] Ghost from the day you're born again.
[1:11:44] So, so and the fullness of adoption is
[1:11:47] the change of the body. But there
[1:11:48] certainly is that area of growth and
[1:11:51] maturity and that's where we are now.
[1:11:53] And you need to be aware of it.
[1:11:57] Otherwise, you're just a churchgoer.
[1:11:59] And I mean, you might even be a message
[1:12:02] believing churchgoer
[1:12:04] and the only the the the only real
[1:12:09] energy is the warmth you leave on your
[1:12:12] seat.
[1:12:14] And there's there's no there it doesn't
[1:12:17] project to anyone. It doesn't do
[1:12:19] anything. It doesn't even worship God.
[1:12:23] It does. It's not even aware that angels
[1:12:25] are moving around this building. And God
[1:12:28] is now an anointing is flowing off the
[1:12:30] platform. I'm here to tell you
[1:12:31] something, friends. Don't be asleep at
[1:12:33] the switch. God is doing something
[1:12:35] mighty in this hour.
[1:12:39] Amen.
[1:12:40] Oh my.
[1:12:43] Where we at, Heath? Where's my last
[1:12:44] quote?
[1:12:47] All right. So, let me catch up. All
[1:12:50] right. Now,
[1:12:53] and now the dynamics of this great
[1:12:55] regime that they've got built. Now,
[1:12:57] watch. See, because now it's not just
[1:13:00] the word. Now, there's a an energy and
[1:13:04] an anointing and revival even on
[1:13:08] anti-word.
[1:13:09] Yes. see the dynamics of this church
[1:13:12] will or he says all right now now the
[1:13:14] dynamics of this great regime that
[1:13:16] they've got built with this big machine
[1:13:18] will work someday in the United Council
[1:13:22] of the World Council of Churches which
[1:13:24] will make a forcing but remember you say
[1:13:28] when that happens see remember when that
[1:13:31] happens it's going to be too late then
[1:13:35] for you you're already in it see you're
[1:13:38] already in a tribulation
[1:13:40] Amen.
[1:13:40] All right. You're already in it. See,
[1:13:43] it's too late. Whether you want to be or
[1:13:46] not, you're already there. Notice you've
[1:13:49] already got that spirit upon you.
[1:13:52] So, there is an anointing that convinces
[1:13:55] the world that the Antichrist is correct
[1:13:58] and they follow him all the way into a
[1:14:01] tribulation period.
[1:14:03] And somehow someway an anointing strikes
[1:14:06] the unwise virgin. And she realizes when
[1:14:09] we're gone, no, I must not take the mark
[1:14:11] of the beast. And she's hunted down like
[1:14:13] dogs and martyed for that faith. But God
[1:14:16] has eternal life waiting on her
[1:14:19] at the judgment bar. But the tribulation
[1:14:22] is not your destiny. The your destiny is
[1:14:24] when the dead in Christ from 2,000 years
[1:14:27] rise, you change, and we all rise
[1:14:30] together to meet the Lord in the air.
[1:14:32] And that dynamic is upon the church
[1:14:35] right now.
[1:14:37] Amen.
[1:14:40] From the token, we're going a little
[1:14:42] further. Went from the 24th now to we're
[1:14:44] in the 28th.
[1:14:46] In the token,
[1:14:49] in the day when the winds of the spirit
[1:14:53] is blowing from east, north, west, and
[1:14:55] south, persuading people out of it and
[1:14:58] showing the people. And I'm looking for
[1:15:01] a time of a breaking forth. You see,
[1:15:03] this isn't just locked in Jerusalem like
[1:15:06] the early church.
[1:15:08] And this message isn't just locked in
[1:15:10] America.
[1:15:11] It's a global. They come from the east
[1:15:14] and west.
[1:15:16] They come from lands afar to feast with
[1:15:19] the king to dine as his guest. How
[1:15:22] blessed these pilgrims are. Do you know
[1:15:24] you're part of that pilgrimage?
[1:15:27] And so now it's not just one thing
[1:15:29] happening. It's not just God as the
[1:15:31] lightning strike comes out of the east
[1:15:33] even under the west and it and it and it
[1:15:35] comes out there in central Europe and
[1:15:37] then it jumps across to England and then
[1:15:39] it jumps the pond and hits the west
[1:15:41] coast and then and but now we realize
[1:15:43] that this thing is coming from there's
[1:15:46] winds from east and north and west and
[1:15:49] south and you've got a entire global
[1:15:51] pride. I'm here to tell you you're part
[1:15:52] of a global family of God. Amen.
[1:15:56] Amen.
[1:15:57] See, and I'm looking for a time, a
[1:15:59] breaking forth of the spirit of God in
[1:16:02] these last days that we're living in for
[1:16:04] another surge of the Holy Spirit. This
[1:16:07] is after the seals are open.
[1:16:09] Amen.
[1:16:10] He's looking for another surge of the
[1:16:11] Holy Spirit into the church for a
[1:16:14] rapturing faith just before uh just
[1:16:19] before he comes. Let me see where I'm at
[1:16:20] here. Uh
[1:16:23] all right. Now just Yeah, correct. Just
[1:16:25] before he comes and everything
[1:16:28] and everything is sitting straight in
[1:16:31] order for that.
[1:16:33] And I believe that we're now at the time
[1:16:35] that the word should have preeminence.
[1:16:40] Do you realize that's the key?
[1:16:42] Amen.
[1:16:43] And a prophet is not talking about
[1:16:47] mental knowledge,
[1:16:48] right?
[1:16:49] The word should have preeminence,
[1:16:52] you know.
[1:16:53] Rephrase that, brother Jason. Christ
[1:16:56] should be the center of your life.
[1:17:00] He should be the center of your rising
[1:17:03] and walking and talking and your
[1:17:05] everyday movement. When you lay your
[1:17:07] head on your bed at night, when you rise
[1:17:08] in the morning, I go to sleep. I rise
[1:17:11] up. Give me Jesus. I go to sleep. I have
[1:17:14] Jesus. I rise the next day. Give me
[1:17:17] Jesus. I go through the day with him. I
[1:17:19] go to sleep with him. I wake up with
[1:17:21] him. He's the center of my life. Brother
[1:17:25] Brandham said he he wants to be first.
[1:17:27] He doesn't want to be second. He said he
[1:17:30] doesn't deserve to be second.
[1:17:33] Amen.
[1:17:34] See, so it should have preeminence.
[1:17:38] I believe that the time to lay aside our
[1:17:41] creeds, our thoughts, and come back to
[1:17:43] the word. Now moving on
[1:17:47] uh to the next day. Look away to Jesus.
[1:17:50] So now I'm going to say something to
[1:17:52] you. Now I haven't said all along and
[1:17:54] that is the thing we've looked have
[1:17:56] looked forward to for so long for these
[1:17:59] last many years four or five years.
[1:18:01] Remember he started telling about it in
[1:18:03] our 1960s. All right. And he was telling
[1:18:05] about it even in the 50s telling about
[1:18:08] the squirrels and telling about the fish
[1:18:09] and telling about these things. See so
[1:18:11] he says
[1:18:14] we have looked forward to it uh many
[1:18:17] years four or five years or maybe
[1:18:19] longer. The third pole has now been
[1:18:21] vindicated. I'm sure you know all know
[1:18:23] what it is. Now remember, there will
[1:18:24] never be an impersonation of that
[1:18:25] because it can't be cannot be. Now it's
[1:18:28] in existence.
[1:18:30] See, and I have I am warned of this that
[1:18:34] soon right at this time now it's just
[1:18:36] happened so it could identify its
[1:18:37] presence among you. It happened again.
[1:18:39] See, he said it's to identify its
[1:18:42] presence among you, but it will not be
[1:18:44] used in a great way until this council
[1:18:45] begins to tighten up. And when it does,
[1:18:47] when that does, the Pentecost and so
[1:18:48] forth can almost impersonate anything
[1:18:50] can be done. But when that time comes,
[1:18:52] when the squeeze comes down, then you'll
[1:18:54] see what you've seen temporarily be
[1:18:56] manifested in the fullness of its power.
[1:18:59] Now, all right, I think that's probably
[1:19:02] my last slide, Ethan. Yeah. So, now, you
[1:19:06] know, I I I want you to be aware of
[1:19:08] something, and I'm sure you are, but
[1:19:11] maybe I can shock you and give you a
[1:19:13] little shock therapy today. The squeeze
[1:19:15] ain't coming.
[1:19:18] It's here.
[1:19:20] And you say, "Well, brother Jason, I
[1:19:23] feel a little bit sad." Well, why? Well,
[1:19:26] because if the squeeze is here, then
[1:19:28] where's all this third pull dynamic
[1:19:31] power that you keep talking about?
[1:19:33] You're still standing, aren't you?
[1:19:36] You're still a believer, aren't you?
[1:19:38] Do you realize how impossible that is?
[1:19:40] Do you realize you're living in an age
[1:19:42] so dark no one could even see into it?
[1:19:44] Not even a prophet thought no one could
[1:19:46] survive that. Hello survivors.
[1:19:49] Oh my. If it was possible we could wave
[1:19:52] back at brother Brandham and say we're
[1:19:53] still here. We're still alive. We're
[1:19:56] still a believer.
[1:20:00] God is doing more in you than you're
[1:20:03] aware of. Don't go chasing a thing.
[1:20:06] Don't make it a thing. This is about a
[1:20:08] life that's filled with the richness and
[1:20:11] the fullness of God operating in our
[1:20:14] home, operating on our job, operating in
[1:20:16] our life, operating when we go on
[1:20:17] vacation, operating in our recreation.
[1:20:20] It's a Christ-c centered life and it's
[1:20:22] working.
[1:20:26] There is everything here to take you
[1:20:29] out. That's right.
[1:20:31] Amen.
[1:20:32] And it has taken out people who were
[1:20:35] perceived to be stalwarts among us that
[1:20:38] we thought could never, oh, if anybody,
[1:20:40] but certainly never this person, only to
[1:20:43] find out that they have been leveled by
[1:20:45] the God of this evil age.
[1:20:49] But I'm here to tell you today, say, how
[1:20:51] do you know that you won't be one of
[1:20:53] them, Brother Jason? Because I can tell
[1:20:55] you that I'm more of a believer now than
[1:20:58] I was yesterday.
[1:21:00] And I'm Yesterday was more than last
[1:21:02] week. And last week more than last month
[1:21:04] and tomorrow when you see me, I'll be
[1:21:07] more of a believer than you see right
[1:21:08] now. I'm not I'm not I'm in no ways
[1:21:11] tired. I'm not discouraged. I feel God
[1:21:15] moving, stirring my soul. And he's he's
[1:21:18] driving me to say to you, "Come on,
[1:21:20] Bethl Tabernacle. Let us rise up. This
[1:21:23] is the hour for God to move.
[1:21:26] There's no time for lingering in the in
[1:21:29] the things of the world.
[1:21:35] So I I you know we have been looking at
[1:21:38] at a number of the
[1:21:41] experiences brother Brandham had and two
[1:21:44] of them that I've been trying to get to
[1:21:47] and I've touched them briefly is the the
[1:21:51] two episodes. One in the state of
[1:21:52] Indiana with red squirrels, one in the
[1:21:54] state of Kentucky two weeks later with
[1:21:55] gray squirrels. In both cases, animals
[1:21:58] were created by the spoken word like
[1:22:01] Abraham did in Genesis 18 when he needed
[1:22:05] a ram because otherwise he needed a ram
[1:22:07] instead of his son. So this ain't God
[1:22:10] entertaining. This is about a need.
[1:22:13] You got a need today. You got a problem
[1:22:15] in your life. Why don't you just say,
[1:22:17] "Lord, I believe I'm living in the hour
[1:22:19] where dynamic power can come upon my
[1:22:22] life right now and make me everything I
[1:22:25] need to be. I don't need to wait."
[1:22:29] Hallelujah.
[1:22:32] So, Brother Brandon makes a number of
[1:22:34] statements and I'm just going to go
[1:22:35] through it.
[1:22:38] Normally, I'd be out of time. So, I'm
[1:22:39] I'm in overtime.
[1:22:41] All right. I've only been preaching 35
[1:22:44] 38 minutes. All right. You good?
[1:22:47] So, brother Ben talks about in the
[1:22:49] message speak to the mountain. This is
[1:22:51] 1959. He's telling about the two
[1:22:53] incidents. He's going to tell about the
[1:22:56] red squirrels, about the grays, and then
[1:22:57] about the sister had right. See, and and
[1:23:02] just speak whatever you say, you'll have
[1:23:04] it right now.
[1:23:07] And so he's he's going to try to build
[1:23:10] his foundation and say, you know, that
[1:23:13] when when that light that you see in the
[1:23:15] picture, how that he he comes and
[1:23:19] whenever he reveals the scripture, he
[1:23:21] says, "It's so perfect." And he said, "I
[1:23:24] I go to my Bible." I love that, man. And
[1:23:28] do I love that he he he goes to his
[1:23:31] Bible to see if what the angel told him,
[1:23:34] you say, "That's a lot of audacity."
[1:23:36] Does the angel get offended at that? No.
[1:23:38] The angel's counting on that.
[1:23:40] See, because even Satan can appear as an
[1:23:43] angel of light.
[1:23:45] And brother Brandham says, "If he ever
[1:23:47] told me anything outside of his Bible, I
[1:23:50] wouldn't believe the angel.
[1:23:52] I would know he's not the angel of the
[1:23:55] Lord because the angel of the Lord will
[1:23:57] never disagree with his word.
[1:23:59] And no revelation you ever get will be
[1:24:01] contrary to the word.
[1:24:03] I don't care who you said gave it to
[1:24:05] you. I don't care what your surname is.
[1:24:09] If you take it upon yourself to
[1:24:11] reinterpret Paul's teaching on the
[1:24:14] five-fold ministry, who do you think you
[1:24:17] are?
[1:24:18] Not even William Brham had the
[1:24:20] authority. Not even not even an angel
[1:24:22] from heaven, not even Paul could change
[1:24:24] that.
[1:24:25] Paul laid down a clear teaching about
[1:24:29] the duties and the accomplishments of
[1:24:31] the five-fold ministry. What it would
[1:24:33] do, how it would work, when it would go
[1:24:35] all the way to a certain time. And
[1:24:37] nobody, no man, no angel, nobody has a
[1:24:42] right to reinterpret Paul's teaching.
[1:24:45] Amen.
[1:24:48] When William Brandon was here,
[1:24:49] everything he taught us about the
[1:24:51] five-fold ministry agreed with Ephesians
[1:24:53] 4.
[1:24:55] Amen.
[1:24:56] See,
[1:24:57] so so exactly. So we find then
[1:25:01] that he he goes on he says now see an
[1:25:04] angel could come and preach anything
[1:25:05] else you know that that that that Paul
[1:25:07] said and it wasn't right. See, but if
[1:25:09] it's the word of God, the angel will
[1:25:11] verify that word every time to be the
[1:25:13] truth. If it's an angel of the Lord, if
[1:25:15] it's something off color, then don't you
[1:25:17] listen to it. See, I I've I've
[1:25:19] encountered people like that. I've
[1:25:21] encountered people who say, you know,
[1:25:23] almost use the same language, like
[1:25:24] they're trying to really what they're
[1:25:26] trying to do is say, "I'm kind of equal
[1:25:27] to the Elijah messenger of this day. The
[1:25:29] angel of the Lord walks before me."
[1:25:32] Okay. Well, then why is your doctrine
[1:25:34] left of sinner?
[1:25:36] Don't tell me the angel of the Lord,
[1:25:38] whatever's walking in front of you might
[1:25:40] not be the angel of the Lord. that voice
[1:25:43] you're hearing. You might need to go
[1:25:44] back and check it by the word. And
[1:25:46] you're going to have to say only what a
[1:25:48] prophet said.
[1:25:49] See?
[1:25:51] And so, so, so we find then that that he
[1:25:54] he he goes on and and I I'm trying to
[1:25:56] I'm trying to move through this quickly.
[1:25:59] And I can see I won't try. I already
[1:26:01] feel in my spirit the Lord's given me
[1:26:03] permission. I can stop at the end of
[1:26:05] this. I've got a whole another set of
[1:26:06] notes. I won't get to it today, but uh I
[1:26:10] I want to get to this
[1:26:12] because this really if I can finish this
[1:26:15] today, this part right here will really
[1:26:19] I'll feel like I have succeeded in
[1:26:21] anchoring this thought in you
[1:26:25] that this third pull is happening in
[1:26:28] real time.
[1:26:29] It's happening right now.
[1:26:32] And what you need to operate it is and
[1:26:34] you say, "Well, I'm not sure I want to
[1:26:35] operate it." Good luck with that. You
[1:26:38] know, when the devil comes into your
[1:26:39] home and tries to wreck it and blow your
[1:26:41] family apart, you're going to wish you
[1:26:43] had perfect faith in operation.
[1:26:45] You're going to run to me then. Oh, pray
[1:26:47] for me, Brother Jason. And all I'm going
[1:26:48] to do is tell you to get to an altar and
[1:26:50] repent
[1:26:52] because you need to go back to Calvary.
[1:26:54] You need to go back and have a fresh
[1:26:56] experience of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:58] because the Holy Ghost operating in you
[1:27:00] will operate his own word. You don't got
[1:27:02] to chase it or make it happen.
[1:27:04] Amen. That's right. See, and and the
[1:27:06] real burden on my heart is that that
[1:27:09] that that every revival, if you want to
[1:27:12] have a revival, that starts with
[1:27:13] repentance.
[1:27:15] That starts with a contrite heart. That
[1:27:17] starts with humility before God.
[1:27:20] Hallelujah. I I was announcing to you, I
[1:27:23] think I announced it that I don't know
[1:27:25] if I did now. I think Thursday night,
[1:27:27] Thursday night at 6:30, the we're
[1:27:30] calling for all the men. We've got
[1:27:32] meetings coming up Friday, Saturday, and
[1:27:33] Sunday. How many want to see God move?
[1:27:37] Amen. Well, 80% of you, hey, what about
[1:27:38] the other 20%? How many want to see God
[1:27:40] move?
[1:27:41] How many want your your your young
[1:27:43] people to be full of the Holy Ghost? How
[1:27:45] many How many are sick? How many have
[1:27:47] financial needs? How many have marriage
[1:27:49] problems? Come on. We want to see God
[1:27:51] move.
[1:27:53] And I met with my ministry team the
[1:27:54] other night. I said, "Brothers, we are
[1:27:56] going to be like a fire starter. When
[1:27:57] you got a whole big fire and you got a
[1:27:59] little fire starter, you pop it in there
[1:28:00] and light that and it burns the whole
[1:28:02] thing." I said, "We're going to we're
[1:28:04] going to we're going to partner with our
[1:28:05] dear brother Don Gurgle who's been our
[1:28:07] hero and the and the other brothers and
[1:28:10] different ones, a few of the other
[1:28:11] brothers who have been so faithful with
[1:28:13] brother Don for the men's prayer
[1:28:15] meeting." And I said, "We're going to be
[1:28:16] a fire starter and we're going to have
[1:28:18] all of these men, get them to praying,
[1:28:20] get them calling on the on the on the
[1:28:22] spirit of God."
[1:28:23] Listen, friends, you want a you want a
[1:28:25] spiritual church? Amen.
[1:28:28] You want a spiritual church,
[1:28:30] that starts with the men.
[1:28:33] It has to start with the men.
[1:28:37] And if you want spiritual men, that has
[1:28:39] to start with prayer.
[1:28:41] And if you want God to move and have a
[1:28:44] revival, that starts with contrition and
[1:28:47] repentance and laying before God in
[1:28:49] humility.
[1:28:51] And I'm here to tell you, God has sent a
[1:28:54] ministry team here, and they are in
[1:28:56] solidarity. said one brother said,
[1:28:57] "Brother Jason, I've been looking all my
[1:28:59] life for a church who would do this and
[1:29:01] go forward and we're going to meet here
[1:29:03] on Thursday night at 6:30 and we want
[1:29:05] all the men and all the older boys to
[1:29:08] come here and call on God."
[1:29:12] How many want to call on God?
[1:29:15] And I would invite every one of you
[1:29:16] mothers, get your children, say, "We're
[1:29:19] going to pray for daddy. He's going to
[1:29:21] the house of God. He's going to call on
[1:29:23] God for us. He's going to be Boaz. He's
[1:29:25] going to step in the gap. We're going to
[1:29:27] get down and pray for dad.
[1:29:31] It's not a time for sisters to have a
[1:29:33] social gathering. It's time for you to
[1:29:35] be praying for your man so that he can
[1:29:37] come here and call God on the scene.
[1:29:41] How many sisters are willing to do it?
[1:29:44] How many brothers are willing to come
[1:29:46] and say, "I will take the way with the
[1:29:48] Lord's despised few, and I want to call
[1:29:51] God on the scene.
[1:29:53] Amen.
[1:29:55] We're not just trying to do it for our
[1:29:57] meetings. We're trying to set it in
[1:29:59] permanent.
[1:30:00] We're trying to set it in permanent. I'm
[1:30:02] here to tell you something, friends. The
[1:30:03] rapture of the bride is very close. It's
[1:30:06] very close. And if there was ever a time
[1:30:09] when you need to be on fire for God, it
[1:30:12] is right now.
[1:30:14] It is right now. These things that you
[1:30:16] read, God is still ready to do them in
[1:30:19] even a greater way. even more than just
[1:30:22] standing but actually to do great
[1:30:24] exploits for God.
[1:30:30] So he says here, watch now. So that was
[1:30:34] the two things
[1:30:36] that the third pull happens in real time
[1:30:40] and that it's not always like you think.
[1:30:43] Amen.
[1:30:44] Amen. It's not always like you think.
[1:30:47] And it c and and it calls for a fresh
[1:30:50] repentance.
[1:30:52] Those two things. It's happening in real
[1:30:55] time, but not always like you think.
[1:30:59] When brother Brandham talks about the
[1:31:02] red squirrels, it's pretty
[1:31:03] straightforward. Not a whole lot of
[1:31:05] confusion. He does. He's He's very much
[1:31:09] distressed
[1:31:10] over this voice talking to him and
[1:31:14] saying, taking him back to Mark 11, if
[1:31:16] you say to this mountain, and that's
[1:31:19] strange. He's like, but that's how is
[1:31:21] that possible? Everything's got to be in
[1:31:23] the atonement, and it Christ hasn't even
[1:31:25] been offered yet. And why is that
[1:31:27] promise coming before it? And he he's
[1:31:30] like, I don't understand what that means
[1:31:32] until God clears it up with him that
[1:31:33] it's not you doing the talking. It's not
[1:31:36] you saying to the mountain, it's me
[1:31:38] through you.
[1:31:40] So the whole key then is for you to live
[1:31:42] in a surrendered state so I can.
[1:31:45] You get that?
[1:31:49] So he says, if you say to this mountain,
[1:31:52] be plucked up, cast in the sea, don't
[1:31:54] doubt, but believe
[1:31:57] in your heart that what you've said will
[1:31:59] come to pass. I don't have this on
[1:32:00] PowerPoint on purpose.
[1:32:02] I'm just reading snippets.
[1:32:05] then you can have what you've said. Now,
[1:32:08] see, he says, I I could not understand
[1:32:10] it. How how could it be that I would say
[1:32:13] something as a man? See, well, if I said
[1:32:15] something that wasn't what if I said
[1:32:17] something was according to his word and
[1:32:18] ask something not according to his word,
[1:32:21] then it would have to come to pass. But
[1:32:23] Jesus said, if you say, see, and so, you
[1:32:27] know, he it it puzzled him.
[1:32:30] How can this be? And so he goes, like
[1:32:34] often when we do, when we're needing
[1:32:36] some mental relaxation and the cares of
[1:32:39] life have gotten to us, he tries to go
[1:32:41] into the woods, tries to go for a little
[1:32:43] recreation.
[1:32:44] Unfortunately, the angel Lord just
[1:32:46] followed him. Go do go run run, take a
[1:32:50] vacation, go take 10 of them, go to the
[1:32:52] sea, go to the islands, go to the
[1:32:53] mountain, you know, go see Muhammad,
[1:32:55] bring Muhammad, whatever,
[1:32:58] you know, go go do what you want. live a
[1:33:01] life of of Riley and recreation, but the
[1:33:03] Holy Spirit will just walk around and
[1:33:04] drill holes in you until you come to
[1:33:08] humility and agree with God's word.
[1:33:12] Try to hide, try to try to try to not be
[1:33:15] a part of God's body. Good luck with
[1:33:17] that because God has determined he's
[1:33:20] going to have a body that's unified and
[1:33:22] brought together.
[1:33:24] So he says, so he goes on. All right,
[1:33:28] let me let me let me try to keep moving
[1:33:30] here.
[1:33:33] All right. So he says, um,
[1:33:37] he starts telling about the story in the
[1:33:39] boat, and I've mentioned this to you
[1:33:41] before. And you know, his son, brother
[1:33:45] Joseph, squeezes a little kitten, it
[1:33:47] rolls around, dies, and he's standing in
[1:33:50] the boat, and he there's going to be a
[1:33:53] great miracle, and God has already
[1:33:55] warned him about it. There's going to be
[1:33:56] something great happen. He says, "What
[1:33:58] will it be, brother Bill?" He said, "I
[1:33:59] don't know. We'll see." And they're
[1:34:01] stand they're sitting in in the fishing
[1:34:02] boat. And he does he breaks a cardinal
[1:34:05] rule. You don't you know, you're not in
[1:34:07] a little a little a little small. If you
[1:34:09] ever seen Brother Brandham's boat, Billy
[1:34:10] Paul actually has it now. I mean, three
[1:34:13] men in it. You don't want nobody
[1:34:14] standing up.
[1:34:16] That's like the wrong thing to do. And
[1:34:18] and the Holy Spirit says, "Stand up."
[1:34:20] And he stands up and Lyall says, looks
[1:34:22] at Bank says, "What is he doing?" He
[1:34:24] said, "Just watch him. Hold on.
[1:34:25] Something's happening." And here's a
[1:34:27] little fish that's been dead on the
[1:34:28] water. Little sunfish been dead for
[1:34:30] hours laying there floating with its
[1:34:31] intrs
[1:34:34] floating.
[1:34:36] And and he says, "Speak to the fish and
[1:34:38] give him back his life."
[1:34:40] Now, that's astonishing enough. And he
[1:34:44] speaks, "Little fishy, Jesus Christ
[1:34:46] gives you back your life." And
[1:34:47] immediately intros went back in or I
[1:34:50] don't know what happened. Maybe they
[1:34:51] vanished and new ones replaced. All I
[1:34:53] know is little fish flipped over and
[1:34:56] went as hard as he could back down into
[1:34:57] the pond alive and well. Probably hadn't
[1:35:00] felt that good in years.
[1:35:04] Wow, I got to bite that hook more often.
[1:35:11] And the and the and the be and the thing
[1:35:13] that really got brother Brandon was
[1:35:14] this. He said, "I was amazed." He said,
[1:35:18] "Because in my pocket, I had a list of
[1:35:21] more than 300
[1:35:24] children, children with
[1:35:26] terrible, crippling diseases that I was
[1:35:28] praying for." And he said, "Why would
[1:35:31] God, it blew the prophet's mind." You
[1:35:33] know, here he's talking about, you know,
[1:35:35] this great dynamics will come and, you
[1:35:38] know, a fresh surge of the Holy Spirit
[1:35:39] and it's going to be the thing we've
[1:35:41] worked and it's done in a little way,
[1:35:42] but it's going to be great. You think,
[1:35:44] my goodness, you you you'd think this
[1:35:45] would have been resurrecting at least a
[1:35:47] whale, but it's a little fish. And he
[1:35:49] says with children. And he said,
[1:35:52] "But God was doing it to show me that in
[1:35:54] the third pull with all that power, with
[1:35:57] all that world building, world creating
[1:35:59] power, he even cares about the little
[1:36:02] things."
[1:36:04] I'm here to tell you, there's third pull
[1:36:05] for your little things. You know what
[1:36:07] that says to me? That there's really
[1:36:09] nowhere you should be living outside of
[1:36:11] under that anointing.
[1:36:13] There's no there's no you say, "I just
[1:36:15] want to live a simple life." It works in
[1:36:16] the simple life.
[1:36:18] Don't don't think Satan won't come into
[1:36:20] your simple life.
[1:36:23] So, I I don't want to pay the price. I
[1:36:25] just just leave me alone. I'll be a
[1:36:26] Christian. I'll be a believer, but I
[1:36:27] just don't want to be all that
[1:36:28] spiritual. Oh, you are a Oh my goodness.
[1:36:31] Are you setting yourself up to be a
[1:36:33] target?
[1:36:34] You think Satan doesn't catch what
[1:36:36] you're doing? You're going to find
[1:36:38] yourself in a position where you're
[1:36:40] going to need God real fast and it's
[1:36:42] going to take you a long time to get
[1:36:44] back where you need to be. And so he
[1:36:47] says,
[1:36:51] so he he he goes on, I I want to keep
[1:36:54] moving.
[1:36:55] So he says, "Human beings laying, dying,
[1:36:57] cancer, cases, leukemia, all kinds of
[1:36:59] sickness around the world and
[1:37:00] everywhere." And he would bring a little
[1:37:01] fish back to life. So then they go and
[1:37:04] they're at another place. Now he's
[1:37:05] telling all these stories. This is
[1:37:06] Brother Brandham's narrative. I can't
[1:37:08] tell as good as he does. Go listen to
[1:37:10] Speak to the Mountain. It's gripping.
[1:37:13] And he he says, "You know, me and
[1:37:14] brother Banks, we were at a certain
[1:37:16] place." And he said, "I I took him up
[1:37:18] into the Aderondikes to show him that
[1:37:20] place where I had hunted bear and left
[1:37:21] my wife and child and they were in the
[1:37:23] tent and I got lost and you know, and
[1:37:24] God didn't remember he and the Lord let
[1:37:26] led him back." And he said, "And that's
[1:37:28] where he come back and preached a
[1:37:29] guide." And he said, "I was showing," he
[1:37:31] said, "I was showing brother Woods all
[1:37:33] these places. I was right here and me
[1:37:34] and Billy was right here and I went over
[1:37:37] here and I was chasing a bear, tracking
[1:37:38] a bear." And he says all of the sudden
[1:37:40] he said something happened and he said I
[1:37:43] felt something happening and he said I
[1:37:44] stepped to the side and he said all of a
[1:37:47] sudden I just started shaking and he he
[1:37:50] didn't even know what was happening. He
[1:37:51] just started shaking and he said the the
[1:37:54] spirit of God spoke to him and said be
[1:37:56] very careful. There's a trap set for
[1:37:58] you. Satan's got a trap. Be very
[1:38:00] careful. What is it? That was it. It's
[1:38:02] all he got. And he and he goes back into
[1:38:06] the next day and he tells all the
[1:38:07] brothers, "Pray for me. Satan's got a
[1:38:08] trap set for me. What is it, Billy? I
[1:38:10] don't know. Just pray for me. He didn't
[1:38:11] tell me everything. See, sometimes
[1:38:14] life's like that. God God is allowing,
[1:38:18] you know, don't listen. When brother
[1:38:20] Brandham is operating this kind of
[1:38:22] divine power, don't think the devil is
[1:38:25] not watching on the sidelines and
[1:38:27] crafting a plan.
[1:38:29] You know that the Zulu nation, the Zulu
[1:38:31] tribe, when they face the British
[1:38:33] regulars on their front lines, you know
[1:38:34] what they would do? You know what the
[1:38:35] Zulu king would do? He would send forth
[1:38:38] sacrificial troops to charge the front
[1:38:41] lines just to count the number of guns
[1:38:43] the British had and see what kind of
[1:38:45] weaponry they had. And all he's doing is
[1:38:47] testing their defenses. Don't think that
[1:38:50] Satan won't come in at great expense to
[1:38:52] his kingdom and test your metal and see
[1:38:53] what you really made out of. And he's he
[1:38:56] comes the next night and he's in a
[1:38:58] meeting and he said and just a few
[1:38:59] nights later here come a young boy and a
[1:39:01] young girl and they're acting vulgar out
[1:39:03] in the seats and here he's saying young
[1:39:05] man don't do that. take that young lady
[1:39:07] and go somewhere respectable. This is
[1:39:09] the house of God. And he said, "Oh, he
[1:39:10] laughed at me and all these people,
[1:39:12] thousands of people, and you know, the
[1:39:14] deacons are ready to pounce." And
[1:39:15] brother Brown is trying to handle it.
[1:39:16] Don't do that, young man. Please, this
[1:39:18] the house of God. And all of a sudden,
[1:39:20] that anointing drops on him. And the
[1:39:22] angel of the Lord says, "Say what'll
[1:39:24] happen to them.
[1:39:26] Say what it'll be. They're in your
[1:39:28] hands. You're now judge, jury, and
[1:39:31] executioner. Say what it'll be. You're
[1:39:33] now God on the scene.
[1:39:35] say what it'll be.
[1:39:38] And brother Brandham said, I stopped and
[1:39:40] I thought, now watch, here's this whole
[1:39:42] real time human stuff. And a prophet
[1:39:45] said, I thought, what do I do? What,
[1:39:47] Lord, what do I say? I don't even know
[1:39:48] what to do. What? Well, help me, Lord.
[1:39:50] You help me. I didn't know what to say.
[1:39:51] What should I say? And he said, as I was
[1:39:54] thinking it, before I could think, he
[1:39:57] said, something uttered through me, I
[1:39:59] forgive you.
[1:40:01] And that broke the power of that devil.
[1:40:03] And they that was that was over. And
[1:40:05] they left. And brother Brandham said,
[1:40:06] "See, Satan was trying to set a trap for
[1:40:08] me to get me to use it in his own
[1:40:11] strength. But God, rich in mercy, come
[1:40:13] down." You know what? You know what
[1:40:15] enabled a prophet to be bulletproof
[1:40:17] against a mistake was his sincerity and
[1:40:20] his consecration and his dedication. And
[1:40:22] I'm here to tell you that'll be your
[1:40:24] only that'll be your bulletproof vest.
[1:40:26] Also, that'll be the only thing keeping
[1:40:28] you on the right path. Amen.
[1:40:32] God is training a prophet so we can read
[1:40:34] the stories and learn how this is
[1:40:36] operating. This isn't about making
[1:40:38] somebody great. This isn't about you
[1:40:40] making a decision. This isn't about you
[1:40:42] going forward in your own zeal. This is
[1:40:45] about humility. This is about a mind
[1:40:47] that's so sold out to God that God can
[1:40:49] just speak through you and you'll move.
[1:40:55] And so he says,
[1:40:57] "God, what must I do?"
[1:41:00] See, he says here now,
[1:41:03] he says, I knowed it was all leading to
[1:41:06] something,
[1:41:07] but what was it?
[1:41:09] Amen.
[1:41:10] There's a prophet. I He He I knew it was
[1:41:13] leading to something, but what was it?
[1:41:17] What to do? He says, you know, you have
[1:41:21] to watch with the divine gift what you
[1:41:23] do with it. Remember what Moses did. He
[1:41:25] starts talking about, you know, Moses
[1:41:27] smoked the rock twice.
[1:41:29] He's talked about John. Some people
[1:41:31] criticize him and John was ready to call
[1:41:33] fire down out of heaven. Do you realize
[1:41:35] why God is in such control of this end
[1:41:37] time friends? Because now we've come to
[1:41:40] the point of the harvest of the whole
[1:41:42] earth. Brother Brandham said said, "See,
[1:41:44] Genesis was the sewing chapter. Almost
[1:41:46] like a former rain. It's almost like a
[1:41:48] sewing of seed. And now he says, now
[1:41:51] he's come 6,000 years all the way to the
[1:41:53] end. And now we're in harvest time." and
[1:41:55] 6,000 years. I'm here to tell you, God
[1:41:57] is not taking any chances. He's not
[1:42:00] allowing you to be a Moses and strike
[1:42:02] the rock twice. He's not going to allow
[1:42:04] you to be John and call fire down on
[1:42:06] people. And what he's doing is he's
[1:42:09] trying to get you under his complete
[1:42:10] control like a prophet to say, "I
[1:42:13] forgive you." And that breaks the
[1:42:15] spirit. You don't you don't have to say
[1:42:17] anything more than just what God can
[1:42:19] speak through you. Amen.
[1:42:23] So he says you know the says Jesus came
[1:42:26] to save life not destroy it. So just his
[1:42:29] mercy see be careful what you said. He
[1:42:32] said and from then on after he did that
[1:42:35] after he passed that test he said from
[1:42:38] then on there was a relief come then
[1:42:40] about I began to notice the different
[1:42:43] things that I would speak out
[1:42:44] unconsciously. So now we've got a number
[1:42:46] of instance where brother M tells on
[1:42:48] tape here's a whole collection of stuff
[1:42:50] he don't even tell just like Jesus if
[1:42:53] everything he ever did the the books the
[1:42:54] the world couldn't contain the books and
[1:42:57] he says from that moment once I pass
[1:42:59] that test from that moment I just began
[1:43:01] to unconsciously speak things and there
[1:43:02] it would be unconsciously speak things
[1:43:04] and there it would be this this my
[1:43:07] friends is the point where we have
[1:43:09] arrived to this was all all of this was
[1:43:12] was a precursor it was God that's why
[1:43:14] brother Brandham said and look away to
[1:43:15] Jesus Jesus, it's not going to be used.
[1:43:17] It's only showed you that it's here.
[1:43:18] It's identified itself, but it will be
[1:43:21] used as that system begins to tighten
[1:43:23] up.
[1:43:23] Amen.
[1:43:24] See, so he says, I begin to speak things
[1:43:26] unconsciously.
[1:43:29] So now he goes to Indiana. He's got two
[1:43:31] weeks. He got a week or I think less
[1:43:32] than a week left of hunting season in
[1:43:34] Indiana. He's going to go squirrel
[1:43:36] hunting for red squirrels. And he said,
[1:43:38] "You know, I I I you know, I I was
[1:43:41] tired. I wanted to catch a little nap."
[1:43:43] And he says, 'I I scooted down in
[1:43:45] between these two trees to warm myself
[1:43:47] is cold. I was going to lay in the in
[1:43:49] the sun. And and he said that scripture
[1:43:50] came to me again. You know, whatsoever
[1:43:53] you say, believe what you shall say come
[1:43:56] to pass. You can have what you said.
[1:43:58] Well, I thought, why does that scripture
[1:44:00] keep coming to me when I can't even
[1:44:02] preach on it? I mean, this is what I
[1:44:05] said a while ago. Prophet's just trying
[1:44:06] to go hunting. So, go ahead, try to run.
[1:44:10] Go ahead, go hunting. Go fishing. Go to
[1:44:12] Disney. Go, go to California. Go
[1:44:14] wherever you want. Go to Europe. Take a
[1:44:16] trip. You won't escape this angel.
[1:44:18] You've arrived at the time. And you're
[1:44:20] God's people.
[1:44:22] You understand this? There's no escaping
[1:44:24] this. I'm I just say, "Lord, I don't
[1:44:26] even want to escape it. I want to raise
[1:44:28] up my hands and surrender to it."
[1:44:33] Why does that scripture keep coming to
[1:44:34] me? Can you Can you feel a prophet being
[1:44:36] a human being? Can he be a human?
[1:44:38] Everybody be okay if we let brother
[1:44:40] Brandham just be a human.
[1:44:43] And he says, "So, you know, I I didn't
[1:44:45] know, well, I I here's what I'll say if
[1:44:47] I ever get asked, and I don't really
[1:44:48] know what to say, but here's what I'll
[1:44:50] say." And he said, ' Then all of a
[1:44:52] sudden, something spoke to me. Cuz
[1:44:54] brother Brandham said, "So yeah, so it
[1:44:56] must be that, you know, because before
[1:44:58] the atonement and then after the
[1:44:59] atonement, so my answer will be this,
[1:45:01] that, and yeah, well, it was before the
[1:45:02] atonement." And he and he said, "Then
[1:45:04] something spoke to me and said, "What
[1:45:06] about the prophets?"
[1:45:09] and said what when I when he said it
[1:45:13] began to unfold to me and a voice kept
[1:45:15] talking what do you think that taken
[1:45:17] place in the meeting when you're
[1:45:19] standing there do you think you're the
[1:45:20] one who knows those people do you think
[1:45:22] that it's you that can predict and say
[1:45:24] and those people that you're doing on a
[1:45:25] certain certain thing and a certain
[1:45:27] certain thing and happen and a certain
[1:45:28] certain thing will happen and do you
[1:45:30] think that's you
[1:45:32] and he says oh my and I thought surely
[1:45:35] not Lord it's you he says well then do
[1:45:37] you think it's you talking when I say to
[1:45:40] you, say to this mountain, do you think
[1:45:42] that's you talking? And he says, "No."
[1:45:45] He says, "Do you think it do you think
[1:45:47] it was in the prophets talking had you
[1:45:50] not just I mean, here is the angel of
[1:45:52] the Lord given him the watch for?"
[1:45:54] Yeah.
[1:45:54] Amen.
[1:45:55] He's trying to get He's trying to catch
[1:45:57] a nap. Angel of the Lord, sit up. This
[1:46:01] is too important. I got to get you to
[1:46:04] understand this. This has got to go on
[1:46:05] tape and people are going to have to sit
[1:46:07] in the 21st century and hear it and
[1:46:10] realize we're here. We've arrived.
[1:46:14] You just got through preaching that the
[1:46:16] prophets was so anointed with the Holy
[1:46:18] Spirit. It wasn't them that done the
[1:46:20] speaking. It was the Holy Spirit and
[1:46:21] them crying out. Then whatever you say,
[1:46:23] if you're anointed wouldn't be you
[1:46:25] saying it. It would be the Holy Spirit
[1:46:27] saying it. And now the prophet is
[1:46:29] starting to come clear. Well, I thought
[1:46:32] that's right. If the person through the
[1:46:34] atonement sanctified by the blood of
[1:46:36] Jesus Christ can listen. Oh, listen. I
[1:46:40] got you. You haven't went to Walmart on
[1:46:43] me, have you?
[1:46:45] All right. Listen.
[1:46:48] If a person through the atonement
[1:46:52] sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:46:54] can live in a sphere with God so close
[1:46:59] that he can be wrapped so completely in
[1:47:02] God by the blood of Jesus that it
[1:47:04] wouldn't be him talking. It would be the
[1:47:06] Holy Spirit.
[1:47:09] Amen.
[1:47:11] Someone who's born again but who can
[1:47:13] live in a sphere with God so close
[1:47:19] He says, "Till the anointing of the Holy
[1:47:21] Spirit struck me." At that moment, it
[1:47:23] struck me like I had never had in all my
[1:47:25] life. God knows that. I raised up to my
[1:47:27] feet. I got scared. He's a human. I got
[1:47:30] scared and something said to me, "Now,
[1:47:33] now is the beginning of your new
[1:47:36] ministry. Now, ask what you will and
[1:47:39] it'll be given to you." He goes on
[1:47:41] telling it and he says, you know, ask
[1:47:44] what you will and it shall be given to
[1:47:47] you and I'm I'm I'm confirming the
[1:47:50] things that I will do. And I and I said,
[1:47:53] now watch this now. And I said, but what
[1:47:56] what should I I thought, who am I who am
[1:47:58] I talking to? I felt like I'd lost my
[1:48:01] mind. He says, I thought, who am I
[1:48:04] talking to? I don't see a person.
[1:48:06] Where's that light at? It's usually the
[1:48:09] one that talks to me. There's no light
[1:48:10] here. Who are you? What do you want?
[1:48:15] There's a prophet almost having a
[1:48:16] nervous breakdown. This angel won't
[1:48:18] leave him alone.
[1:48:21] Who are you? What do you want with me?
[1:48:25] Say the word. Speak it. I thought
[1:48:28] something said, "Ask what you will." I
[1:48:31] was thinking of that scripture, Mark 11,
[1:48:33] asks what you will. I thought, "Well,
[1:48:34] what would I ask for?" I love this
[1:48:36] statement. Oh, I love this statement. I
[1:48:38] love this statement. He said, "Well,
[1:48:41] what would I ask for? There's no sick
[1:48:44] people here."
[1:48:47] Can you imagine if that was an
[1:48:49] invitation to all of these TV evangelist
[1:48:53] charlatans out there and the Lord just
[1:48:54] said, "Ask what you want." Could you
[1:48:56] imagine how many Gulfream jets would be
[1:48:58] parked in their driveway?
[1:49:02] Can you imagine? Can you imagine the
[1:49:05] size of their new word created
[1:49:06] tabernacle and their satellite programs
[1:49:09] they would call down? And here's a
[1:49:11] prophet being offered by God just ask
[1:49:14] anything. And the only thing in his mind
[1:49:17] he can even think to ask is if any of
[1:49:20] y'all are sick.
[1:49:22] Amen.
[1:49:23] And people want to criticize a man like
[1:49:25] that.
[1:49:27] Oh my, there's no sick people here. What
[1:49:29] what could I do? I thought there's no
[1:49:31] maybe maybe I'm beside myself. What
[1:49:34] would I ask for? And something said just
[1:49:37] as plain as you hear my voice, aren't
[1:49:38] you honey? And you have no game. Do you
[1:49:42] are you are you with me understanding
[1:49:44] that this is in real life? This is just
[1:49:48] everyday life. This is not super
[1:49:51] spectacular fireworks exploding. This is
[1:49:54] God trying to walk around in your
[1:49:56] everyday life.
[1:49:58] Amen. And he says,"Aren't you hunting?
[1:50:01] You have no game." And I said, 'I
[1:50:03] thought, 'Well, you know, if I'm doing
[1:50:04] anything wrong, Lord, you forgive me. He
[1:50:06] He's still not even sure. Voice talking
[1:50:08] to him. He's not even sure if he's
[1:50:09] insane. And he says, you give me a
[1:50:12] vision. Said it be confirmed. A little
[1:50:14] building somewhere in a meeting when
[1:50:15] when the tent gets started, said, "Is
[1:50:18] this what it's leading to? If it is,
[1:50:19] Lord, then I'll take you at your word."
[1:50:22] See, and so so he just he just said,
[1:50:24] "I'm just going to make it impossible."
[1:50:26] Being a hunter, he knew where squirrels
[1:50:28] would be. And being a hunter, he knew
[1:50:29] where they wouldn't be. So, he names
[1:50:31] three places where they wouldn't be. As
[1:50:33] a hunter, he knew they'll never be
[1:50:35] there. So, I'll stay right here. And the
[1:50:36] other one will come this way. And the
[1:50:37] other one will go up and run out that
[1:50:38] limb. And he said, "There's some farmers
[1:50:40] over there with their hay." And he said,
[1:50:41] "He'll run out, look out that limb, and
[1:50:43] he'll stand there and watch those
[1:50:44] farmers."
[1:50:47] And and he says, "And I and all of a
[1:50:50] sudden he says, "I I looked and I found
[1:50:52] that old locust thicket." And he says,
[1:50:54] "And I and and there he was. It was
[1:50:57] impossible." And there was the squirrel
[1:50:59] exactly where I said, and he said, "You
[1:51:01] know, I I took the shot and you know,
[1:51:04] and I and I never shoot one that I don't
[1:51:06] get a clean." He's talking about a clean
[1:51:07] shot on. I'm not reading his exact
[1:51:09] words. And he and he said, I said,
[1:51:10] "That's 50 yards. That's about the
[1:51:12] distance across this building." And I
[1:51:13] said, "There come a young red squirrel
[1:51:15] and set on that old naked limb out
[1:51:16] yonder and I'll shoot him from here."
[1:51:18] And there come the squirrel. I turned
[1:51:20] the gun, aimed through the little
[1:51:21] telescopes. I seen his eye, shot it,
[1:51:23] dropped down. I walked over to look at I
[1:51:25] thought it's bleeding. A vision don't
[1:51:27] bleed.
[1:51:29] And he goes on to tell. So I stood there
[1:51:31] just a bit and I and I said, "Lord, if
[1:51:33] that was you, you know, the the the the
[1:51:35] Bible talks about, you know, there's
[1:51:36] just two or three witnesses because
[1:51:38] right away a second one come
[1:51:41] and he shot the second one right where
[1:51:42] he said it would be. And now he's
[1:51:45] waiting and a third one's not coming."
[1:51:48] So look at this human being. Look at
[1:51:51] this human being with human being ups
[1:51:54] and downs and weaknesses like the old
[1:51:55] Elijah had.
[1:51:57] And he just he starts reasoning, well,
[1:51:59] okay, I'm not I'm not going to get the
[1:52:01] third one. Okay. Uh the the Bible says
[1:52:04] two or three witnesses. So two, okay,
[1:52:06] I've still got a witness. I'm still
[1:52:07] good. Everything's fine. I'm just going
[1:52:09] to go. Thank you, Lord, for the two I
[1:52:10] got. And the voice says, uh, no, you
[1:52:14] said three.
[1:52:16] Well, I mean to's witness to it. No, but
[1:52:18] you you already said it. You already
[1:52:20] said it. Now go back and get that
[1:52:21] squirrel. And he goes back and and and
[1:52:24] he he he he starts telling the story.
[1:52:26] I'm trying not to read it all. And he
[1:52:28] said, "I thought, you know, it'll come
[1:52:30] another squirrel and sit over there in
[1:52:31] them bunch of grape vines and I and I
[1:52:34] took my I right in those grape vines."
[1:52:36] And he said, "I took my finger down.
[1:52:38] There was no squirrel." And he said, "I
[1:52:41] thought, hm,
[1:52:43] now he's thinking." And before he can
[1:52:45] think too long, he said, "And all of a
[1:52:48] sudden," he said, 'I looked back and I
[1:52:49] thought, 'What is that? Pulled up my
[1:52:51] telescope and there was a squirrel
[1:52:52] looking right at me. 50 yards, I shot
[1:52:53] squirrel, walked over, picked him up.
[1:52:54] Wasn't a vision. Wasn't a vision. It was
[1:52:56] a squirrel. I eat them. So, I eat them.
[1:53:00] So, I picked up that one and I thought,
[1:53:01] "Oh my, oh," he said, I just felt real
[1:53:04] funny. I thought, you know, and then and
[1:53:06] then and that that's actually how he got
[1:53:08] from the second one. And now he goes to
[1:53:09] what I've already told you about the
[1:53:10] third one. And he has to go back. I'm
[1:53:12] going to have to skip it because I'm so
[1:53:13] out of time now. And he says, "But you
[1:53:15] wanted three." And I didn't hear a
[1:53:17] voice, but something just inside of me
[1:53:19] said that. And I said, "It shall come to
[1:53:21] pass that a young squirrel will go out
[1:53:22] on that limb, sit on the end of that
[1:53:23] limb, and look over the farmers cutting
[1:53:25] their corn, shocking their corn, and
[1:53:26] I'll kill him, and this will be three
[1:53:28] right here, and I it'll be that way."
[1:53:30] And I stood there a minute, no squirrel
[1:53:31] looked back. Five minutes past, no
[1:53:33] squirrel. Well, I thought, well, it is
[1:53:35] enough anyhow. And that's when the
[1:53:36] Lord's sending him back. He won't let
[1:53:37] him go. The scripture says, "If you'll
[1:53:39] not doubt it in your mind, you already
[1:53:41] spoke it. Don't doubt it in your mind."
[1:53:43] I waited up against the side of the
[1:53:44] tree. He said, "How could a squirrel
[1:53:46] ever go out there?" I said, "Well, I
[1:53:47] guess I'll just move along and I'll be
[1:53:49] going home now." He's still trying to go
[1:53:52] home.
[1:53:55] He here's an angel talking to him and
[1:53:57] he's already shot, too. And he's still
[1:54:00] reasoning. Listen, friends, I hope that
[1:54:03] this will encourage you today.
[1:54:05] I'm not here to tell you we're going to
[1:54:06] have all the answers. and we know how
[1:54:08] it's all going to go. I'm here to tell
[1:54:10] you if you want to be insulated, have
[1:54:12] the spirit of God moving in and out of
[1:54:14] your life.
[1:54:16] Amen.
[1:54:17] And I and he says, and I I said, "No."
[1:54:19] He said, and the Holy Spirit said, "Are
[1:54:21] you doubting? Are you now listen to what
[1:54:23] he says, the the voice said, he said,
[1:54:27] God," he said, "Are you doubting?" He
[1:54:28] said, "God knows how to school you." Are
[1:54:31] you doubting
[1:54:32] what you said?
[1:54:37] I said, "No, I'm not doubting." And just
[1:54:40] as I said that, coming out of the limb
[1:54:41] there, a young squirrel walked out into
[1:54:42] the limb, stood there, and looked over
[1:54:44] the farmer, shot him right there, making
[1:54:45] them three squirrels. And I said, "I'm
[1:54:46] going to I'm going to see if there's
[1:54:48] another squirrel in the territory." And
[1:54:49] I sit there about three hours, was three
[1:54:51] hours late to pick up Brother Sman. He
[1:54:53] said, "I didn't even hear another
[1:54:54] footstep for three more hours." And then
[1:54:58] he goes to Kentucky.
[1:55:00] And he starts talking about, you know,
[1:55:02] the gray squirrel is a little little
[1:55:03] smaller. And he he goes there and all he
[1:55:06] said, "Oh, this there's no way. This is
[1:55:09] no." He's thinking about that. He knows
[1:55:11] what happened two weeks ago. And it's on
[1:55:13] his mind that maybe it could happen
[1:55:16] again. But you know why? He doesn't even
[1:55:18] want to try it cuz the conditions are
[1:55:20] too impossible. He don't want a chance
[1:55:22] that he might fail.
[1:55:24] It's rainy. It's cold. It's snowing.
[1:55:28] There's all the leaves are down. I sound
[1:55:31] like I heard an analopee walking through
[1:55:32] here. Uh it's okay, Lord. We're not
[1:55:34] going to push it. Oh friends, do you
[1:55:37] understand God is trying to get you to
[1:55:39] push beyond your boundaries? Get you to
[1:55:42] push into the realms that might be a
[1:55:43] little uncomfortable to believe God for
[1:55:46] every word. How many want to have that
[1:55:48] kind of life?
[1:55:51] Oh no, it's too unlikely this morning.
[1:55:53] Sure enough, no. No squirrels here. No,
[1:55:55] not this time of year. And I was walking
[1:55:57] along like that. It struck me again
[1:55:59] said, "Ask what you will." I mean, I
[1:56:02] could imagine myself going, "Can you
[1:56:03] please leave me alone?
[1:56:07] My nerves can't handle another one."
[1:56:10] And I stopped. I put my gun down, took
[1:56:13] off my head, and I said, "Heavenly
[1:56:14] Father, I'm down here in these
[1:56:15] mountains. What's What's these things
[1:56:17] about? What are you doing? What's this
[1:56:21] about? Is that you speaking to me? Is it
[1:56:23] you, Lord? Where are you at? I usually
[1:56:26] see that light. Where are you at? Speak
[1:56:29] to me, Lord. If there's anything you
[1:56:30] want me to do, I'll do it. You don't
[1:56:32] have to chase me out here. I'll do it.
[1:56:35] But you see, God's got him in school for
[1:56:37] you and me.
[1:56:38] Amen. Amen.
[1:56:40] And I said, and it said, "Ask what you
[1:56:42] will, and it'll be given to you." And I
[1:56:43] said, "Then if it be you, I shall have
[1:56:45] my three squirrels this morning, gray
[1:56:47] squirrels, the reds in Indiana." And I
[1:56:49] said, "I'll I'll have my three
[1:56:50] squirrels." Something said, "Which way
[1:56:52] will they come from?"
[1:56:56] And I said, "Oh, well, one will come
[1:56:58] this way and one will come back that way
[1:57:00] and another will come from up that way."
[1:57:03] And I leaned up against a little tree
[1:57:04] and waited a few minutes, I didn't see
[1:57:06] any squirrels. Getting late. Time to go
[1:57:08] almost. I looked back across the hill.
[1:57:10] Way up about 150 yards, I guess. I seen
[1:57:14] something. I thought, "What is that? Is
[1:57:16] that a squirrel?" And I he he takes his
[1:57:18] rifle. I knelt down, you know, on my
[1:57:20] knees and laid my gun across the side,
[1:57:23] you know, of my head. And and he and he
[1:57:25] he wasn't even sure if it was a squirrel
[1:57:26] until he saw it move. And then he took a
[1:57:28] shot three times further than he
[1:57:29] normally would take.
[1:57:31] See? And I and I said and I said that
[1:57:34] then the next one will have to come this
[1:57:36] way. And so he wheels around. He's going
[1:57:38] to There's another one coming up this
[1:57:40] way. And he wheels around and I and I
[1:57:42] just turned myself on the tree and I
[1:57:43] said, "It'll come that way." I waited
[1:57:45] about 15 minutes here. Here come a
[1:57:47] squirrel. What happened to my sound
[1:57:50] here?
[1:57:51] Uh, something suddenly got very echoey.
[1:57:56] Um, all right. See if you can fix that,
[1:57:58] brother Jackson. Don't know why. I sound
[1:58:00] like I'm in a well. So he says,
[1:58:05] "So then I the another one will come up
[1:58:07] this way." So I just turned myself on
[1:58:08] the tree and I said, "It'll come up this
[1:58:09] way." I wait about 15 minutes. Thank
[1:58:11] you. And here come a squirrel. I throw
[1:58:13] another shell up in the gun and level
[1:58:15] down. And just I started level down
[1:58:17] another squirrel. He calls it a second.
[1:58:20] And you have to follow his language cuz
[1:58:21] he's telling the story and he's already
[1:58:23] shot one. So this this this is a second
[1:58:25] one. And then he says and then a second
[1:58:28] one come meaning the third one cuz now
[1:58:30] he's he's got a beat on the on the
[1:58:31] number two. All right. And so he says
[1:58:34] and so here he So I might I might just
[1:58:36] help you and and and insert my so so you
[1:58:39] understand it so I don't have to keep
[1:58:40] explaining that. So here come another
[1:58:42] one. And I said, "Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:58:44] There there there's my other one there.
[1:58:46] That's going to be my my last one." And
[1:58:47] and there they are. And I raised up and
[1:58:49] I shot the first one. Killed him right
[1:58:51] dead. See, that's number two. Hit him
[1:58:53] right through the eye. And then the
[1:58:55] other squirrel jump. He he run and
[1:58:57] jumped up on a log and it run down over
[1:58:59] like picked up a hickory nut and started
[1:59:01] eating on it. Just a perfect shot about
[1:59:03] 50 yards. I thought there's there's my
[1:59:06] last one. There it is. That's one, two,
[1:59:09] three. Just what I said. I laid my gun
[1:59:11] down and shot and I hit the log. And he
[1:59:14] said, "Now, out of uh out of about 149
[1:59:17] squirrels this year, I've only missed
[1:59:19] five shots." So I thought, "Wow, how did
[1:59:21] I miss that squirrel?" Never scared him.
[1:59:22] He jumped up, run back around the other
[1:59:24] side of the log, and stood. I looked
[1:59:26] around. I put another shell in the gun.
[1:59:27] I thought, "I'll get him this time." I
[1:59:28] leveled down right across with a hair
[1:59:31] right across as I pulled the trigger and
[1:59:32] I hid about two feet under him. And I
[1:59:35] said, "My gun's out."
[1:59:37] No, it wasn't.
[1:59:39] You know what was wrong?
[1:59:41] Amen. that that what was wrong was that
[1:59:44] third one he was trying to kill wasn't
[1:59:47] the one he spoke into existence
[1:59:50] because the because the third one was
[1:59:52] supposed to come from another way
[1:59:55] and it just so happened this this
[1:59:57] expendable crewman squirrel jumped in
[2:00:00] the path of the number two and almost
[2:00:03] got killed
[2:00:05] but his bullets were going low and high
[2:00:08] and left and right and he couldn't hit
[2:00:09] him and he's only 50 yards away and he's
[2:00:11] a dead shot. Can drive attack at 50
[2:00:13] yards.
[2:00:15] And he said, "I my gun's out." Oh my
[2:00:18] goodness. And so he says, he says,
[2:00:20] "Why?" He he jumped off the log, run
[2:00:22] right broadside of me. I said, "Well, I
[2:00:24] haven't I haven't shot a squirrel
[2:00:26] sideways in a long time. Now he's going
[2:00:27] to break his own rule. He's not going to
[2:00:29] shoot him in the eye." He says, "So
[2:00:30] desperate." Do you hear the humanity?
[2:00:33] Do you hear the humanity? This This is
[2:00:36] you and me. trying to make it human to
[2:00:38] you so you don't think this is some you
[2:00:40] know supercalifragilistic expialidocious
[2:00:43] somehow I can never attain it. You can
[2:00:46] you can attain it. It's for human
[2:00:48] people. It's for common Christians.
[2:00:52] It's what God is trying to do for us in
[2:00:54] this hour.
[2:00:58] And he said, "I haven't shot one in
[2:01:00] Cypus a long time, but I'm going to see
[2:01:01] if this gun's out or not." I said, "I'll
[2:01:03] certainly get him this time. Maybe I'm
[2:01:04] just cold and shaking." So I got a
[2:01:05] little limb, leaned across it, gun
[2:01:07] pulled the bush, leveled down. I was
[2:01:09] right broadside, not over 35 yards away.
[2:01:12] The squirrel's running down the hill,
[2:01:14] right across the mid center of him, pull
[2:01:16] the trigger. I don't know where I hit. I
[2:01:18] missed that squirrel and I was out of
[2:01:20] shells in my little old gun. Squirrel
[2:01:22] went up over the hill. I thought, "Wow,
[2:01:26] there I missed three straight shots in
[2:01:28] the whole season. Only missed five. How
[2:01:31] could that be?" Indeed. He said, "Then I
[2:01:32] happen to think I couldn't have got that
[2:01:34] squirrel. I said the other one would
[2:01:36] come from this way. There's two. There
[2:01:39] was three. But his word is perfect."
[2:01:43] You understand, friends, what this is
[2:01:44] meaning that you don't have to be
[2:01:47] afraid. God is not even going to let you
[2:01:50] do the wrong thing.
[2:01:54] It's not about you might be wrong. It's
[2:01:56] not you talking. It's not you deciding.
[2:02:01] It's him deciding. It's him talking.
[2:02:05] Who's he talking through? Anybody who's
[2:02:07] willing to live up in that sphere and be
[2:02:10] close to God.
[2:02:13] That's what's happening. That's what
[2:02:15] this whole series is about.
[2:02:18] We are at the time of the unsealing.
[2:02:20] These are the things that God is ready
[2:02:22] to do among us.
[2:02:23] Hallelujah.
[2:02:24] I'm going to finish up right here. I
[2:02:27] started now. Now he's got to now this
[2:02:29] third one. Two of them was there. But
[2:02:31] his word is perfect. See, he'd already
[2:02:33] said three. I started waiting till
[2:02:34] almost dark. I said, "If the other
[2:02:36] squirrel comes, I'm going to have to
[2:02:37] shoot him up real close cuz I there
[2:02:39] there's a thicket here and he has to
[2:02:41] come down through the through this
[2:02:42] thicket cuz that's the way he said he
[2:02:43] would come."
[2:02:45] Cuz remember, he made it impossible
[2:02:48] when he thought he had plenty of time.
[2:02:51] See, he made it impossible never
[2:02:53] imagining what was going to transpire.
[2:02:56] And the angel of the Lord just standing
[2:02:57] there watching it all, taking it all in.
[2:03:03] And so he says, I'd have to shoot him
[2:03:04] real close. He's got to come down
[2:03:06] through this thing. I don't know what he
[2:03:07] can get. Well, I thought, well, it
[2:03:09] wasn't so this time. Okay. I I knew it,
[2:03:12] Lord. You know, I knew it. It was pretty
[2:03:13] stormy today. I, you know, I probably
[2:03:15] got messed up with that other squirrel.
[2:03:17] And I'm sorry. It's on me, Lord. It's my
[2:03:18] fault. I know I'm not going to get that
[2:03:20] third one, but it's not your fault,
[2:03:21] Lord. It's on me. It's okay. I got two.
[2:03:24] Uh, I messed up. You know, I should have
[2:03:26] I I should have not wasted all my
[2:03:27] bullets on that other squirrel. I should
[2:03:29] have knew I couldn't shoot him. And so
[2:03:31] now he's ready to go. See, it wasn't so
[2:03:33] this time. The anointing maybe maybe I
[2:03:36] just happened to get those two. So I
[2:03:38] went over and picked up my squirrels and
[2:03:40] started home and it was real dark in the
[2:03:42] hollow and I started down through the
[2:03:44] hollow. Something said to me, "What
[2:03:45] about that other squirrel?"
[2:03:49] Oh boy, here we go again.
[2:03:52] And I said, 'Well, I already got two.
[2:03:56] It's It's too late now. I can't even see
[2:04:00] through my scope hardly. It's too late
[2:04:01] to get one. I mean, you know, is this
[2:04:04] going to be Joshua turning the sun? Am I
[2:04:07] going to be He has He has Hezekiah
[2:04:08] turning the sun dial. Is is am I going
[2:04:10] to make Joshua make the sun stand still?
[2:04:13] And it's too late to get one. I started
[2:04:15] on down. Now, here's a here's the voice
[2:04:18] of God spoke to a prophet and said,
[2:04:20] "What about that other squirrel?" And
[2:04:22] now he's saying, he reasons it out.
[2:04:24] Well, it's too dark. Can't see. Here's
[2:04:25] my scope. Can't do it. It's too dark.
[2:04:27] And he says, "And so I just after the
[2:04:29] Lord even said that, I'm still headed on
[2:04:30] down."
[2:04:33] I just said, "Lord, I'm so glad to read
[2:04:34] this humanity because it gives me a
[2:04:36] hope. It gives me I can feel
[2:04:39] I can just say, Lord, you are train.
[2:04:41] This is my training. You're putting him
[2:04:42] through training. It was for our
[2:04:44] examples."
[2:04:46] See, so that's why I kept telling you
[2:04:48] friends, this third pull, don't get it
[2:04:49] in your mind that it's just all
[2:04:52] something super spectacular. It might
[2:04:54] just be everyday life for when you need
[2:04:56] him at the right moment and the word
[2:04:59] will come upon you.
[2:05:02] Oh, he said, "So it's too late." And I
[2:05:05] headed on down and something said, "Turn
[2:05:08] and go back and get that other
[2:05:11] squirrel." Now, the Holy Spirit is not
[2:05:14] even going to let his word fail.
[2:05:17] Amen.
[2:05:18] A man's word. The angel of the Lord's
[2:05:21] not even going to let a man's word fail.
[2:05:25] Go back and get that other squirrel.
[2:05:28] You've already said it.
[2:05:31] Hallelujah.
[2:05:33] and he he tells he goes through the
[2:05:35] whole story
[2:05:37] and he shoots the squirrel and he he he
[2:05:43] shot at it. I'll just I'll just give you
[2:05:44] the the the speed the speed story and he
[2:05:47] he find here's a third one and he he
[2:05:49] said I barely saw it just the sunlight
[2:05:51] coming up over the hill just barely any
[2:05:53] light at all and he said I thought what
[2:05:55] is that and he put his and he said I
[2:05:57] didn't think it was a squirrel till it
[2:05:58] moved and he said so I put it and I shot
[2:06:01] it and he said and it and he said it it
[2:06:04] jumped down off the tree
[2:06:05] and took off running and he said oh man
[2:06:09] oh he and then he said right then right
[2:06:12] then another squirrel right where he
[2:06:14] jumped down and out of brother
[2:06:15] Brandham's sight another one come from
[2:06:17] right there and ran up another tree he
[2:06:18] said oh there he is I got him now he
[2:06:20] jumped from that tree to that tree I'll
[2:06:22] shoot again and he shot him and he said
[2:06:24] that time buddy kplunk he said I heard
[2:06:27] him hit kplunk he said he was dead this
[2:06:30] man had shot enough squirrels to know
[2:06:31] when one hit the ground dead
[2:06:34] and now he goes walking up through there
[2:06:37] and he's headed for the one he shot
[2:06:39] until suddenly he comes on the one he
[2:06:41] thought he missed
[2:06:43] that he thought ran down the tree and
[2:06:45] ran up over there. No, it ran down the
[2:06:46] tree and died and another one ran up
[2:06:48] that tree. That's a fourth one.
[2:06:51] Is this Is this microphone gone again?
[2:06:54] The pullpit.
[2:06:56] Oh, the wireless isn't here, but I'll
[2:06:58] just I'll just try to stay close. All
[2:07:00] right. Not sure why I'm still still
[2:07:02] green here. All right. So, I'm gonna
[2:07:05] turn it off.
[2:07:08] You still good?
[2:07:10] Well, I'm in overtime today, ain't I?
[2:07:12] And so he he comes along and now here's
[2:07:16] this now here's this third one and
[2:07:17] that's obviously a fourth one. He must
[2:07:19] have killed a fourth one. And now he's
[2:07:21] all excited and he's all happy. And now
[2:07:23] he's got his three squirrels and now
[2:07:25] he's going to get a fourth bonus but he
[2:07:26] can't find it. But he knows he shot it
[2:07:30] and he goes down. Finally he's got his
[2:07:31] three. He leaves. He goes down. He meets
[2:07:33] the brothers. He tells them the story.
[2:07:35] He says now I think that fourth one he
[2:07:37] went into a log. I reached a stick in
[2:07:39] there and I I could feel him flipping.
[2:07:41] He was dead. And he said, "I'll go back
[2:07:42] tomorrow and get him." And they're all
[2:07:44] rejoicing. And he said, "You know, it'll
[2:07:46] be there. Don't worry. I shot that
[2:07:47] fourth one." He said, "God gave me a
[2:07:48] fourth one. Gave me three. Gave me one
[2:07:51] for good measure." And praise the Lord.
[2:07:53] And they're sitting around, you know,
[2:07:54] talking about that. And then here's
[2:07:55] here's a deacon. No offense, Brother
[2:07:58] Luther. So, here's a deacon innocently,
[2:08:02] you know, says goes into a prayer for
[2:08:05] the next day. Lord, to to prove that the
[2:08:07] prophet is telling the truth, let him
[2:08:09] find that fourth scrum. Brother Brown
[2:08:11] said about fainted
[2:08:12] and he thought, "Brother Tony, have I,"
[2:08:14] Brother Tony Zable was his deacon. He
[2:08:16] said, "Have I, you know, been this long
[2:08:18] with you? You You think I wouldn't be
[2:08:20] telling the truth? You think I would lie
[2:08:21] about something like that?" And he's not
[2:08:23] saying that. He's just hurt his
[2:08:24] feelings. So, can you believe somebody
[2:08:26] who can operate the third pole can get
[2:08:28] her feelings hurt?
[2:08:30] Can you believe somebody who can speak
[2:08:31] animals into existence can get their
[2:08:33] feelings hurt? Yep.
[2:08:35] See, you think somebody like that can
[2:08:37] still be suffering a little bit of a
[2:08:38] complex? Yep.
[2:08:40] This is real life, friends.
[2:08:43] This is real life.
[2:08:45] And and the next day they're going to go
[2:08:48] back and he says as he started up
[2:08:50] through there to get that fourth one
[2:08:51] because now now it wasn't even supposed
[2:08:53] to be that really the fourth one was
[2:08:55] just a bonus. Had nothing to do with the
[2:08:57] with the Lord saying it. Just he just
[2:08:58] happened to shoot a fourth one.
[2:09:00] So So really he doesn't even like that.
[2:09:03] Brother Tony's putting that one in with
[2:09:05] the vision. He said that had nothing to
[2:09:06] do with it. That's a bonus one. That's
[2:09:08] for free. the three I He told me and I
[2:09:10] got them.
[2:09:11] Yeah.
[2:09:13] The story's over.
[2:09:14] And so he says, "Well," he says, "We'll
[2:09:16] see anyhow.
[2:09:18] It'll be there anyhow, Brother Brandham.
[2:09:20] Don't you worry." Now, Brother
[2:09:21] Brandham's all stressed. He's going back
[2:09:23] up the mountain. And he says something
[2:09:26] said to him, "What if that squirrel
[2:09:28] isn't in there now? What? And there your
[2:09:31] own deacon will say that you're not
[2:09:33] right."
[2:09:38] And I started to walk on. I thought,
[2:09:40] well, I sure hope it's there. That's one
[2:09:42] thing. Sure. I certainly hope and I've
[2:09:44] I've never said nothing about that
[2:09:46] squirrel. You all understand. How many
[2:09:48] understands what this is about? Sure.
[2:09:50] The three squirrels is what I spoke
[2:09:52] about. The fourth one had nothing to do
[2:09:53] with it, but the Lord knows how to train
[2:09:56] and what to do. So going on up there,
[2:09:58] that anointing struck me again and said,
[2:10:02] "If it isn't there, say it'll be there
[2:10:06] and you'll find that squirrel."
[2:10:09] Now that anointing fell on him.
[2:10:11] Wow.
[2:10:12] And I said, "Lord, I'm taking you at
[2:10:14] your word." And I said, now here was the
[2:10:17] problem. What he said was a little
[2:10:19] vague.
[2:10:20] And I said, "I shall find the squirrel."
[2:10:24] I know. A little while later, he was
[2:10:27] kicking himself for not saying exactly
[2:10:29] where.
[2:10:31] But the mountain I went, I thought, "No
[2:10:33] need me fearing anymore because I'm
[2:10:34] gonna find it. That's all. I done said
[2:10:36] it." And the Lord said when that
[2:10:37] anointing was on me, I said anything,
[2:10:39] it'd be that way. So, I'm just going on.
[2:10:41] He just went on hunting. He didn't go
[2:10:42] get it. He just He went on and enjoyed
[2:10:44] his day. Hunted around, done all this,
[2:10:47] done all that. He said, "Well, you know,
[2:10:48] it's getting about time. I guess I
[2:10:49] better go get that squirrel I spoke into
[2:10:51] existence."
[2:10:53] And I looked down there and he said,
[2:10:54] "Uh, I I I I I I got my knife and I cut
[2:10:57] that log open and he said, I reached
[2:10:59] down in there to get my squirrel and I
[2:11:00] realized I was looking down in there. I
[2:11:03] was picking up some roots and it was
[2:11:05] falling some roots under they was laying
[2:11:07] in this old snag and I thought, "Oh my."
[2:11:10] And we're supposed to be there exactly
[2:11:13] 9:00. So I thought now with no squirrel
[2:11:17] now I'm going to go back and I don't
[2:11:18] even have the one I told and now I spoke
[2:11:21] it into existence and it's not even here
[2:11:24] and oh my that listen to what he says.
[2:11:28] Oh my that morning was terrible.
[2:11:34] Oh it was a it's a blizzard going on and
[2:11:36] I thought that's terrible and I thought
[2:11:37] where there's only one thing I can do to
[2:11:39] prove it Lord it wasn't your fault Lord
[2:11:42] it's not on you. See, because you told
[2:11:44] me to speak and I spoke those three and
[2:11:46] that three was there. But brother Tony
[2:11:47] just misunderstood it. That's all. He
[2:11:49] was misunderstood. And I just said, I'm
[2:11:50] just going to go back down there and
[2:11:51] pick them up and the other brother and
[2:11:53] bring them here and I'm going to show
[2:11:55] them what happened. I was mistaken. I
[2:11:56] thought it was roots. It's I thought it
[2:11:57] was a squirrel. I'm sorry. You know,
[2:11:59] still had nothing to do with the three.
[2:12:00] Uh here's the stump. Just to let them
[2:12:02] know. And I thought I was right. Okay. I
[2:12:05] told the truth about knowing the
[2:12:06] squirrel was there. And I and I put it
[2:12:08] and I started down the hill and
[2:12:10] something said to me, "But you said
[2:12:12] coming up you'd find that squirrel."
[2:12:15] Amen. Amen.
[2:12:17] Amen. Oh, you just don't know what that
[2:12:20] does to me. You said you shall find the
[2:12:23] squirrel. I thought, "Where could I find
[2:12:27] him? Here's the woods. Not a leaf on a
[2:12:30] tree. They're all piled up around here.
[2:12:32] They're there. There's the tree where
[2:12:34] the squirrel fell." And I he he's you
[2:12:36] know he I mean he just I don't what am I
[2:12:39] going to do you know and and and there's
[2:12:43] the squirrel and there's the tree and
[2:12:44] here's the one thing he he could have
[2:12:46] hid under it and it have been this log
[2:12:48] and I I've took everything apart. I took
[2:12:50] it to pieces and not another hole in a
[2:12:52] tree nowhere and there's only one place
[2:12:54] and he's not there. And he said but you
[2:12:57] said you would find it.
[2:13:00] Amen.
[2:13:01] Well I kicked around in the leaves and
[2:13:03] everything. And I thought, "Oh, Billy,
[2:13:05] you went off the deep end." And I
[2:13:07] started going down and started said, and
[2:13:10] that he started going down again. And
[2:13:11] the voice said, "But you said you'd find
[2:13:14] it."
[2:13:15] Come on.
[2:13:15] And I thought, "Well, that's right." I
[2:13:16] said, "Uh, when the anointing was on me
[2:13:18] and I I find the squirrel and and that's
[2:13:20] a confirmation the ministry began to
[2:13:22] begin again." And then and then the
[2:13:24] squirrel's got to be here somewhere. I
[2:13:25] can't find it. Where's it at? And
[2:13:27] something said, "Look under that piece
[2:13:29] of bark." And I went and I picked it up.
[2:13:30] I started I said, "Yes, sir. Now, praise
[2:13:33] the Lord, it's under that bark. And he
[2:13:35] said, and I went over and I picked up
[2:13:37] the piece of bark and something said,
[2:13:39] but what if it isn't under there?
[2:13:45] What if it isn't under there?
[2:13:47] Oh, I said, it'll be under there. And I
[2:13:50] picked it up and there was no squirrel.
[2:13:55] And I thought, there's something funny.
[2:13:58] I said that was the same inspiration
[2:14:01] that told me the three would be there.
[2:14:04] The same inspiration. See, now he's
[2:14:06] going back on his history with God.
[2:14:08] God had never failed him. And now it
[2:14:11] didn't matter how stressful
[2:14:14] life was becoming.
[2:14:16] He knew
[2:14:18] God had never failed.
[2:14:21] It didn't matter. He kept guessing at
[2:14:23] it. He kept being wrong. He guessed at
[2:14:26] it again. The angel would speak to him.
[2:14:28] and try to ignore it and go home. No, go
[2:14:30] back. Okay. Well, I still can't. Okay,
[2:14:31] I'm going home again. No, go back. Okay,
[2:14:33] well, I still can't. So, I'm going home
[2:14:34] again. You go back and find it. Okay, I
[2:14:39] don't know where it is. Find it. Well,
[2:14:41] where would I look? Go look under that
[2:14:44] piece of art. Okay, but what if it's not
[2:14:46] there?
[2:14:48] It's not there.
[2:14:51] And you talking about somebody having
[2:14:55] almost a breakdown. Amen. I got to step
[2:14:57] here in your microphone. Thank you, sir.
[2:15:00] Oh, thank you. You've been hanging out
[2:15:01] with preachers, haven't you?
[2:15:03] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:15:06] And and yet God now, what have we seen?
[2:15:11] God is forcing him to come to the word.
[2:15:15] If you say Mark 11, God will not let him
[2:15:19] get out of what he spoke.
[2:15:22] God lets life confuse him.
[2:15:26] and lets the circumstances bewilder him.
[2:15:30] And yet God will still not give an inch.
[2:15:34] That goes to show you God doesn't give
[2:15:37] an inch on his word at all. If you're
[2:15:40] going to be a Christian, you really need
[2:15:43] to be a real one.
[2:15:45] If you're going to trust the Lord, you
[2:15:47] need to trust him all the way. cuz he'll
[2:15:49] tell you to get in a boat, go out into a
[2:15:52] raging river and pitch your oars over.
[2:15:55] And he'll leave you out there and trying
[2:15:57] to figure out what to happen before he
[2:15:59] rescues you. And he might get you out
[2:16:01] there and pull the plug and sink the
[2:16:03] boat from underneath you. But you got to
[2:16:05] go back in your mind to say, "He's never
[2:16:08] failed to keep his word. And I'm a
[2:16:11] believer and I'm standing here believing
[2:16:13] every word. Sink or swim. It doesn't
[2:16:16] matter what happens. I've arrived at the
[2:16:19] hour that prophecy said I would be here.
[2:16:21] And I'm going to be one of those who
[2:16:23] believe God for every word. And I know
[2:16:26] life is going to get hard. And I know
[2:16:28] it's going to be confusing. And I know
[2:16:29] I'm not going to always get it right.
[2:16:31] I'm going to make a mistake, but he's
[2:16:33] not going to let me make a mistake. And
[2:16:35] then I might do it again. And he'll turn
[2:16:36] me around again. He's going to bring
[2:16:38] this bride to her perfection.
[2:16:41] [Applause]
[2:16:42] That's the anointing that's upon us,
[2:16:44] friends.
[2:16:46] Hallelujah. And he goes and he says, "I
[2:16:48] stood there. I didn't know what to do.
[2:16:50] Wasn't there. I picked it up and he
[2:16:54] said, "I looked and I looked there again
[2:16:56] and I seen just a little couple gray
[2:16:59] hairs sticking out from under the
[2:17:01] leaves. I picked it up and there was my
[2:17:04] squirrel." He said, "You talking about a
[2:17:08] little Irishman shouting? You ought to
[2:17:11] heard me." Listen friends, your promise
[2:17:15] that you need so desperately,
[2:17:18] you might only be needing to look for
[2:17:20] two little hairs. And it might not be
[2:17:23] out in the plain open. It might not be
[2:17:25] something you would even expect. It
[2:17:28] might catch you completely offguard, but
[2:17:30] God is training you to trust his word.
[2:17:35] God is training you to trust his word no
[2:17:39] matter what. How many say, "No matter
[2:17:43] what." You want to raise a hand to the
[2:17:44] Lord today? Say, "No matter what, I'm
[2:17:46] going to trust your word. I'm going to
[2:17:49] believe I'm a part of it." Let's stand
[2:17:50] to our feet. I'm going to believe I'm a
[2:17:52] part of it. I'm not going to back up. I
[2:17:55] don't care about circumstances. I might
[2:17:57] even trip and stumble and mess it up
[2:17:59] myself, but I but here's what I know.
[2:18:02] He'll still make it happen. He'll still
[2:18:04] correct me when I'm wrong. He's going to
[2:18:06] bring me back to his word. I just say,
[2:18:08] "Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[2:18:10] That's the kind of life I want, friends.
[2:18:13] All it takes, all it all that brother
[2:18:15] Brandham had to do to make sure that
[2:18:18] everything that turned out turned out
[2:18:20] was he just had to have a life
[2:18:22] completely consecrated. And he had to
[2:18:25] remember
[2:18:27] he had to remember times when he didn't
[2:18:30] obey the Lord. And there were times he
[2:18:34] didn't obey the Lord when he told him to
[2:18:35] first go and he listened to his
[2:18:37] mother-in-law and he paid a hard price.
[2:18:38] He didn't obey the Lord in Africa and
[2:18:41] and even old brother Bosworth, you know,
[2:18:43] got him to kind of pressured him. And
[2:18:46] uh, Brother Brandham, I think maybe
[2:18:47] you're just wrong this time. He said,
[2:18:49] "Oh, that great old man like that who I
[2:18:52] love so much could tell me that." And he
[2:18:54] said, "And even and and you know, he
[2:18:55] just and you know what he did? He knew
[2:18:57] that he was right, but he bowed to
[2:19:00] pressure."
[2:19:02] You know why? Cuz he's a human. He bowed
[2:19:05] to pressure. And now he's standing here
[2:19:07] in the woods. No, he ain't going to be
[2:19:09] bowing to no more pressure. We're not
[2:19:12] bowing to anything. I am not here to be
[2:19:15] intimidated by the devil. Don't you be
[2:19:18] intimidated by the devil. I don't care
[2:19:20] what your need is. All you need is two
[2:19:22] little gray hairs. That's all you need
[2:19:24] to believe your promise. Say, "Oh, my
[2:19:26] children, my family, my home, my
[2:19:28] marriage, my job, my money, my this, my
[2:19:30] that." Let me tell you something. God
[2:19:32] has already promised in his word that
[2:19:35] this bride would of the last day, she's
[2:19:37] the one who would operate. She would
[2:19:40] operate this segment of the third pull.
[2:19:43] We're not looking for another word
[2:19:45] revival. No way. The next word revival
[2:19:49] goes to Israel. That's why brother
[2:19:51] Brandon would say at the end of his
[2:19:52] life, he said, "I'm not looking for
[2:19:53] another revival. I'm looking for the
[2:19:55] coming of the Lord." But yet the prophet
[2:19:57] did not deny the fact that while it
[2:20:00] wasn't a a new word revival because that
[2:20:02] goes to the Jews. And we have to keep
[2:20:04] that separated. You go in the seals, you
[2:20:06] have to know what you're doing or you'll
[2:20:08] have your you'll have the bride doing
[2:20:09] things assigned to Moses and Elijah.
[2:20:11] See, that's why you have ministers who
[2:20:14] can rightly divide and teach you these
[2:20:15] things. You go and read the fourth seal
[2:20:18] and you'll think you're supposed to do
[2:20:19] the things Moses and Elijah do. And if
[2:20:21] you just stop reading right there, but
[2:20:23] fortunately you've got a pastor that can
[2:20:24] say, "Well, all you got to do is go read
[2:20:25] the sixth seal." And he goes back and
[2:20:27] corrects that and says, "No, that's
[2:20:28] Moses and Elijah, not the bride. She has
[2:20:31] nothing to do with that whatsoever." But
[2:20:33] I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[2:20:35] God has this exactly mapped out, planned
[2:20:38] out, and and all he needs is a church. I
[2:20:41] just have made up my mind. I said,
[2:20:42] "Lord,"
[2:20:45] and I I covered about half my material
[2:20:47] today, and I've kept you double long. I
[2:20:52] preached over probably an hour and 35,
[2:20:55] 40 minutes. But I'm here to tell you
[2:20:57] something, friends. I was determined
[2:20:59] today if I couldn't accomplish anything
[2:21:02] else is to prove to you that the time is
[2:21:06] now.
[2:21:07] The people is you.
[2:21:09] Amen.
[2:21:11] Say it's me.
[2:21:12] Say the time is now and God is bring all
[2:21:16] the other ones are having their revivals
[2:21:18] and and brother Brandham said if you see
[2:21:20] that then you know God is doing among
[2:21:22] his elect as well. And we're not here to
[2:21:25] make the same mistake that they made
[2:21:27] through the 70s and 80s and 90s and all
[2:21:30] through the 20th century. Chased after
[2:21:32] fancy things and doctrines and
[2:21:34] anointings and built camps, raised up
[2:21:36] super men to build super kingdoms around
[2:21:38] supermen. and even into the 21st century
[2:21:41] and even to this very hour, Satan is
[2:21:44] still duping people into that. We're not
[2:21:47] here to chase a thing. We're here to
[2:21:49] surrender our lives to God. We're here
[2:21:52] to be so in tune. There's nothing I
[2:21:54] could want for myself more or want for
[2:21:56] you more than to be in perfect harmony
[2:21:59] with the Holy Spirit.
[2:22:01] When we meet
[2:22:04] this Thursday, brothers, I will invite
[2:22:06] every young man. I think we're going to
[2:22:08] hold it from like age 13 and up. Every
[2:22:11] young man and every father and man that
[2:22:14] comes, husband, every man from 13 and
[2:22:18] up, we want you to join with us to pray.
[2:22:20] We're going to pray over needs. You got
[2:22:22] needs, send them to me. We'll pray over
[2:22:23] them. We might repay for Wednesday's
[2:22:25] needs again. And we're going to we're
[2:22:29] going to we're going to we're going to
[2:22:30] figure it out as we go. But we know
[2:22:31] we're going to take up needs. The theme,
[2:22:34] the theme of what the ministry team and
[2:22:37] I want to express to you brothers is the
[2:22:41] theme is not not that we're going to go
[2:22:42] chasing this or praying for that or
[2:22:45] praying for this or praying for power,
[2:22:47] praying for gifts or praying for any of
[2:22:48] that stuff. You know what we're going to
[2:22:49] pray for? What brother Brandham said
[2:22:51] that the dynamics come down upon the
[2:22:54] mechanics and in whatever form that
[2:22:57] comes, I want to be ready. I want to be
[2:23:00] a part of that, friends. Whether it's
[2:23:01] three easy reds in Indiana or three
[2:23:04] insanity grays in Kentucky, I want to be
[2:23:07] ready. Whether I understand what he does
[2:23:10] or not, I I I know he's never lied. He's
[2:23:13] never failed. And I know I'm a believer.
[2:23:16] And the only thing that that can take
[2:23:17] this church into that level is dedicated
[2:23:20] people.
[2:23:21] Amen. God bless you friends today. It's
[2:23:23] been wonderful preaching to you. I
[2:23:26] didn't get but halfway done, but believe
[2:23:28] it or not, I feel exceptionally
[2:23:30] satisfied. I think I've made this these
[2:23:33] main points to you of what this whole
[2:23:36] series is. I can now take that folder
[2:23:38] and it's got seven, eight, nine sermons
[2:23:40] in it and I can stick it over and and
[2:23:42] I'm done. And I've got another half of
[2:23:44] material for to to go on in a different
[2:23:47] way, but that that'll be for a different
[2:23:48] time. You love the Lord.
[2:23:51] Let's bow our heads. Father,
[2:23:56] I just I went with how I felt led today.
[2:24:00] It was different. It was unusual.
[2:24:03] It's not my normal way. But I I was
[2:24:06] determined, Lord, for the people to see
[2:24:08] this crystal crystal clear. I feel that
[2:24:13] you helped me, Lord, and I feel that you
[2:24:15] gave the people eyesight, spiritual
[2:24:16] eyesight to see what it is so that we
[2:24:19] understand what it's not.
[2:24:22] We understand what we're trying to
[2:24:24] achieve so we don't misunderstand and go
[2:24:26] after the wrong thing. We're not trying
[2:24:29] to make it a thing or chase a thing,
[2:24:31] Lord. We're trying to humble ourselves
[2:24:34] and say, "Father, we look at the signs
[2:24:36] of the time. We look at the things
[2:24:37] around us. We see the promises in the
[2:24:39] word and we believe them. And we believe
[2:24:41] that we are the people and we believe
[2:24:43] this is the time. We believe it's now.
[2:24:46] And I know that your word, Lord. I know
[2:24:48] that that before this bride leaves here,
[2:24:50] there's going to be that demonstration
[2:24:52] of the Holy Spirit. And I I don't say
[2:24:54] it's in the future. I see the
[2:24:57] demonstration of it. Every time I stand
[2:24:58] in this pullpit and look out at people
[2:25:00] who are believing the word of God in an
[2:25:02] impossible day, I see the third pole in
[2:25:05] action already.
[2:25:07] I pray you'll help us, Father, in the
[2:25:09] coming days to meet the challenges of
[2:25:11] the hour. We believe you'll do it, Lord.
[2:25:13] We humble ourselves for it before you
[2:25:16] for this very reason. And I ask you now,
[2:25:19] Father, take what's been said today.
[2:25:21] It's a seed. It's been planted in the
[2:25:23] hearts. I've been studying it, Lord, for
[2:25:26] weeks and weeks and weeks, and it's just
[2:25:28] been rolling me around to say, "You need
[2:25:30] to move up higher. You need to move up
[2:25:32] higher." I'm saying today with Brother
[2:25:34] Brandon, me, I I need a revival. I need
[2:25:38] a fresh repentance. I need to move up
[2:25:40] higher. That's what a prophet said. He
[2:25:42] put it on himself. He said, "You folks
[2:25:44] understand, I'm talking about me. I need
[2:25:46] a fresh revival. Lord, may it be upon
[2:25:50] Bethl Tabernacle in the coming days,
[2:25:53] whatever days there are that remain.
[2:25:55] Lord God, we want to be ready. We want
[2:25:57] to be ready. We commit ourselves into
[2:26:00] your hands in Jesus' name."
[2:26:03] Let's sing, Brother Tony. Amen.
[2:26:08] [Music]
[2:26:11] Oh yes,
[2:26:13] he's already
[2:26:18] my
[2:26:19] [Music]
[2:26:21] I'll keep on trusting.
[2:26:25] Yes, Lord.
[2:26:27] That is working everything for my good.
[2:26:32] Lift it up now.
[2:26:34] He
[2:26:36] walks beside
[2:26:39] me
[2:26:41] and heaven is in my view.
[2:26:47] Oh,
[2:26:48] I
[2:26:50] going to make
[2:26:53] it
[2:26:55] through.
[2:26:58] Oh, raise up those hands and sing it
[2:27:00] now.
[2:27:03] I'm going to
[2:27:06] raise your hands now.
[2:27:08] He's already said that I would.
[2:27:13] Thank you, Lord.
[2:27:16] I'll
[2:27:17] keep on trusting
[2:27:22] that he's working everything for my
[2:27:26] good.
[2:27:30] He
[2:27:31] walks beside
[2:27:34] me.
[2:27:35] Oh yes. And heaven is in my view.
[2:27:41] Oh,
[2:27:43] I'm
[2:27:45] going to make
[2:27:48] it
[2:27:50] through.
[2:27:52] Oh, that's an anthem, friends. Wave at
[2:27:54] him now. Sing it like an anthem. I'm
[2:27:58] going to make it.
[2:28:02] Thank you, Lord.
[2:28:03] He's already said that I will. You
[2:28:07] already declared it, Father.
[2:28:10] I
[2:28:12] keep on trusting
[2:28:15] trusting
[2:28:16] that he's working everything for my
[2:28:20] good.
[2:28:23] Oh, he
[2:28:26] walks beside
[2:28:28] me
[2:28:30] and heaven is in my view.
[2:28:36] Oh,
[2:28:38] I'm
[2:28:40] going to make
[2:28:43] it. You need prayer today, you're
[2:28:45] welcome to come. Some have come already.
[2:28:47] God bless you. Amen. If you need prayer,
[2:28:50] keep singing. Brother Tony, I'm
[2:28:53] going to make it.
[2:28:58] He's already said I would.
[2:29:05] I'll keep
[2:29:09] trusting.

[2:30:27] Father in the name of Jesus I lay hands
[2:30:30] upon him. Lord I can feel this fever. I
[2:30:33] condemn the work of the devil. I call
[2:30:36] for the healing power of Jesus Christ.
[2:30:39] We rebuke this fever. We've seen it in
[2:30:42] the scripture. You're the same God.
[2:30:44] We're the same people. We have the same
[2:30:45] word. We believe the same thing. Satan,
[2:30:47] you're just as defeated as when Peter
[2:30:50] cast you off of Lord. When when one was
[2:30:52] a mother was cast and the fever was cast
[2:30:55] off of her. We cast off this fever. We
[2:30:57] ask the Holy Ghost, Lord. We ask the
[2:31:00] enemy take his hands off of God's
[2:31:01] property, Lord. And may he be made
[2:31:04] completely whole even right now. Lord,
[2:31:06] we condemn Satan in the name of Jesus
[2:31:08] Christ. Amen. Go accepting it, sister.
[2:31:12] And thank God for it. God bless you. God
[2:31:14] bless you, my brother.
[2:31:16] Heaven is in my
[2:31:20] pray.
[2:31:23] I'm
[2:31:24] going to make
[2:31:28] it through.

[2:34:24] Amen. As they just keep playing that for
[2:34:25] me, let's bow our heads one last time.
[2:34:28] Father, we thank you for your presence
[2:34:30] among us today.
[2:34:32] Thank you for your word, Lord. Thank you
[2:34:35] for this audience of people who came
[2:34:36] out, sat so patiently, Lord. We've sent
[2:34:39] forth your word, Father. And when I
[2:34:41] think back in my heart, I feel a
[2:34:44] satisfaction of the Holy Spirit.
[2:34:46] Everything was said that needed to be
[2:34:48] said today. And Lord, everything that
[2:34:51] was said, for all I know, Lord God, it's
[2:34:53] perfectly in line with your word. We
[2:34:55] went back and forth, Lord, proving it
[2:34:57] forwards and backwards. We looked into
[2:34:59] the scripture. We know the promises that
[2:35:01] you gave us through Elijah. Lord, we're
[2:35:04] not trying to make it anymore, but we're
[2:35:06] also don't want to reduce it, Lord. We
[2:35:08] don't want to say put it off somewhere
[2:35:11] somewhere over a rainbow. No, Lord,
[2:35:13] right now, this day, this is the hour.
[2:35:16] We believe it with all of our heart,
[2:35:18] Lord God, that you want to do great and
[2:35:20] mighty things among us. Lord, your
[2:35:22] coming might still be for we don't know.
[2:35:24] Your coming could be many years off, but
[2:35:27] what does it matter? I want to live in
[2:35:28] the in the spheres of God. I want to
[2:35:31] live close to God. wrap myself, tear my
[2:35:34] own mantle as Elisha did and wrap myself
[2:35:37] in the mantle of the same one that the
[2:35:39] prophet had worn. Grant it Lord in a
[2:35:41] double portion. We commit it to you
[2:35:43] today. Go with this people Lord. We have
[2:35:46] other events to take place. I pray
[2:35:48] you'll bless the senior youth Lord in
[2:35:50] their endeavor here. Bless the uh sister
[2:35:53] Deborah, Sister Sarah, different ones
[2:35:55] Lord who'll be working with them for
[2:35:56] their practice. I pray Lord that you
[2:35:58] will give them a vision today that this
[2:36:01] isn't about performance. This is a
[2:36:02] worship to his majesty the king. Who
[2:36:05] could not want to be a part of that? I
[2:36:08] pray for them Lord that you will give
[2:36:09] them a special anointing. We think about
[2:36:12] our afternoon gathering with our own
[2:36:14] sister Jean to hear her Lord express her
[2:36:17] heart Lord in her own personal
[2:36:19] testimony. We love her. Love that that
[2:36:21] we have that Lord one more time to hear
[2:36:24] the great things and what God has meant
[2:36:25] to her Lord. Since a young woman,
[2:36:28] Father, it's been intriguing to us,
[2:36:30] Lord, we've been fascinated with it, to
[2:36:32] see a veteran like this this many years
[2:36:34] to find out what have been the secrets
[2:36:36] to her strength. Grant it, Lord, a great
[2:36:39] blessing upon her. We commit ourselves
[2:36:41] to your hands now for the balance of our
[2:36:43] day, Lord, in Jesus' name. Amen. God
[2:36:47] bless you, friends. You can be dismissed
[2:36:49] in Jesus name. Amen. Sing, brother.
