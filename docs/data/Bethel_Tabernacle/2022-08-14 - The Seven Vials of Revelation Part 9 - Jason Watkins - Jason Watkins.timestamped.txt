[30:27] days they've actually taken her off the
[30:29] ventilator she's breathing on her own
[30:31] amen

[42:58] chapter 17 this morning

[43:03] please just keep those in mind
[43:05] um
[43:06] people
[43:07] write in those prayer requests because
[43:09] they have confidence
[43:11] in prayer and we certainly have
[43:13] confidence in prayer don't you have
[43:14] confidence in prayer my prayer people
[43:17] say prayer changes things i some years
[43:19] ago i started saying prayer changes
[43:21] everything
[43:23] i mean when you start when you realize
[43:24] the position that the bride of christ
[43:27] holds in the earth say what position is
[43:29] that the word made flesh and the earth
[43:31] again same way it was embodied in a the
[43:34] only difference is in jesus it was a
[43:36] single body walking the shores of
[43:38] galilee but god never intended to stay
[43:41] bottled up in one body walking the
[43:43] source of galilee his whole plan was to
[43:46] send to to come back into his body again
[43:49] in the earth and walk among a
[43:51] many-membered bride are you part of that
[43:53] number today amen praise the lord
[43:56] we want to continue part nine today uh
[43:59] in our series on the seven vows of
[44:01] revelation
[44:03] revelation 17 and we'll catch these
[44:06] first two verses
[44:11] and there came one of the seven angels
[44:14] which had the seventh seven vials now
[44:17] this would be the same this angel is
[44:20] synonymous with the angel of revelation
[44:22] 10 7.
[44:24] the revel uh the the same angel in
[44:26] revelation 3 to the laodicean church age
[44:28] all right so 3 14 10 7 um the the met
[44:33] the revelation 5 the strong angel
[44:36] standing there calling for a mighty come
[44:38] for someone worthy here he is again
[44:41] the seventh angel holding this seventh
[44:43] vial because he's the one who brings the
[44:45] full mystery of god back to the earth
[44:48] there came one of the seven angels with
[44:50] which had the seven vials and talked
[44:52] with me saying
[44:54] unto me come hither i will show unto
[44:57] thee
[44:58] the judgment of the great that
[45:01] sitteth upon many waters so i mean when
[45:04] you hear what he's going to show who do
[45:06] you imagine it is it's certainly the
[45:08] seventh angel given the open book and
[45:11] the mystery the un the unfolding of the
[45:13] seals all right and this is the very
[45:16] thing that brother branham and his
[45:17] ministry identified he identified this
[45:20] great that set upon many waters
[45:22] verse 2 with whom the kings of the earth
[45:25] now catch it now because this is part
[45:27] remember now we're teaching on the the
[45:29] impact of the vials pre-tribulation all
[45:33] right where they're partially impacting
[45:36] the earth
[45:37] when i look at the history and i see
[45:39] what the partial impact has done to the
[45:41] world today
[45:43] when i see the insanity released into
[45:45] the air under the seventh vial and what
[45:47] it's had an effect on the world today
[45:49] and it's just partial
[45:51] friends you don't want to be here in the
[45:53] tribulation because then it's full
[45:55] so now notice what he noticed now he's
[45:58] coming to identify
[46:00] this beast's system and he says come
[46:03] hither i will show unto thee the
[46:04] judgment of the great that sitteth
[46:07] upon many waters now look at the warning
[46:09] with whom the kings of the earth
[46:12] have committed fornication
[46:14] so this is all the leadership of the
[46:16] world have committed fornication
[46:18] and the inhabitants of the earth have
[46:21] been made drunk with the wine of her
[46:25] fornication all right so now we we when
[46:28] you when you think about what brings
[46:31] the oil and the wine to the to the new
[46:35] testament church
[46:36] it was god's holy spirit revealing a
[46:40] word that brought a stimulation upon the
[46:42] people and it caused us to not only
[46:46] hear
[46:47] and recognize the word but it caused us
[46:50] to act upon the word amen
[46:52] so now this is why brother branham would
[46:55] talk about
[46:56] fornication remember in the book of
[46:58] revelation fornication and adultery is
[47:01] primarily the fornication against the
[47:04] word
[47:05] as calling jesus your husband and you've
[47:08] taken a
[47:09] man-made system and the whole world has
[47:12] been duped into believing that man-made
[47:15] system and because that he has believed
[47:17] that false word
[47:20] then now he's under a stimulation he's
[47:23] drinking a wine that is corrupting his
[47:26] mind and placing him in a stupor placing
[47:29] him in an insanity and it all came from
[47:33] following
[47:34] feeding on discrepancies in the word of
[47:36] god now how glad are you for a message
[47:41] you'd be drunk you'd be drunk with them
[47:43] that's why paul said to the
[47:44] thessalonians we're we're sober we're of
[47:46] the day we're not drunken in the night
[47:48] as the world see so this is all tying
[47:51] together i want to draw that picture in
[47:52] your mind as we go to the our next
[47:55] reading right go a chapter over to
[47:57] chapter 18 verse 1.
[48:03] and after these things i saw another
[48:07] angel come down from heaven
[48:09] having great power
[48:11] and the earth was lighted with his glory
[48:14] and he cried mightily with a strong
[48:16] voice saying
[48:18] babylon the great is fallen is fallen
[48:22] and is become
[48:23] the habitation of devils
[48:26] and the hold of every foul spirit
[48:28] and a cage of every unclean and hateful
[48:32] bird
[48:33] for all nations have drunk of the wine
[48:37] of the wrath of her fornication
[48:40] and the kings of the earth have
[48:42] committed fornication with her and the
[48:45] merchants of the earth are waxed rich
[48:49] through the abundance of her delicacies
[48:52] and i heard another voice from
[48:54] voice from heaven saying come out of her
[48:57] my people
[48:59] that you be not partakers of her sins
[49:03] that you receive not of her plagues
[49:06] for her sins have reached unto heaven
[49:10] and god hath remembered her iniquities
[49:15] amen amen let's pray father
[49:19] we thank you for your word
[49:21] this morning i thank you for the
[49:23] unveiling of these great mysteries to us
[49:26] i thank you for the anointing and the
[49:27] unction of the holy spirit already that
[49:30] i see operating this morning i commit
[49:32] myself further now into your hands for
[49:35] these things these are vital times lord
[49:38] tremendous hour and perilous times on
[49:40] the earth and we must we must see you in
[49:43] your movements we must hear the rhythm
[49:46] and time of the sheep music we must be
[49:48] in the spirit of the composer lord we
[49:50] can't be out of step we've got to be in
[49:52] step father i pray that you'll grant it
[49:55] to us now this is necessary if we hope
[49:58] to if we hope that our lives are a
[50:01] reflection of shalom lord there's only
[50:04] two spirits anointing the world shalom
[50:07] and insanity father we want the peace of
[50:10] god that passes all understanding may
[50:12] you grant it to us may your presence now
[50:15] be in our midst show yourself alive and
[50:18] mighty lord by breaking down your word
[50:20] and let it let it be quickened to the
[50:22] hearts of the people we commit it to you
[50:24] today in jesus name amen god bless you
[50:27] you can be seated
[50:53] so um brother matthew if you will
[50:57] put 18
[50:58] 3 back up for me please on the screen
[51:02] and then we'll go from there i want to
[51:04] make some comments and then we'll make
[51:06] some comments on the fourth verse as
[51:09] well
[51:10] so
[51:11] you know when we when we see all of
[51:14] these connections and i
[51:16] i trust that your minds are sharp today
[51:18] to see all of these connections thank
[51:20] you for the kenny to see all of these
[51:22] connections because these things aren't
[51:24] accidents
[51:26] when the lord is connecting the dots
[51:29] like this for us
[51:30] uh it really it amazes us it astonishes
[51:34] us but it's not it's not there just to
[51:36] amaze you and just to so so it can make
[51:39] us all smarter and go wow i see all
[51:41] these mysteries i connect all of these
[51:43] you know in school we used to get these
[51:45] things where you had to connect the dots
[51:46] to make the picture
[51:48] and it's you know it's it's not just
[51:50] about
[51:51] uh having a picture it's there's a
[51:54] journey connecting the dots and you're
[51:57] on a journey today and you know as you
[51:59] start to get those dots connected more
[52:01] and more the picture starts coming clear
[52:04] suddenly the more you learn the more you
[52:06] know what it should look like which then
[52:08] in turn helps guide you to make the rest
[52:10] of the connections and this is what the
[52:12] journey i want to speak about that a
[52:14] little bit more today this journey i was
[52:16] listening on our on our call in show
[52:19] yesterday brother brother uh david
[52:21] samuel my goodness what a what a lesson
[52:24] he taught us and i have some notes and
[52:26] outlines some i want to make a few
[52:27] comments and repeat a few things he said
[52:30] because it was so conducive to what i
[52:31] want to teach today
[52:33] but we find that you know when you when
[52:36] you start looking at this scripture for
[52:38] all nations have drunk of the wine of
[52:41] the wrath of her fornication and the
[52:43] kings of the earth have committed
[52:45] fornication with her and the merchants
[52:47] of the earth have waxed rich through the
[52:50] abundance of her delicacies now you know
[52:53] when you when you look at it that way it
[52:55] then it's it's not very hard
[52:58] to
[52:58] understand why the world runs after it
[53:01] because they're waxing rich it's what
[53:04] you know as what brother branham said if
[53:05] you really want to be a success
[53:09] in the world he said one time to young
[53:11] men he said if you young men want to be
[53:13] a a worldly heartthrob you know and and
[53:16] and that's the that's your goal he said
[53:18] then then you better not follow this
[53:21] he said you know if you want to be a
[53:22] success by the world's standards you
[53:24] better just go the way of the world
[53:26] because one thing's for sure this won't
[53:28] make you popular and this will make you
[53:31] a target of the enemy and he'll attack
[53:33] your health he'll attack your finances
[53:35] he's the god of economics he's not going
[53:37] to let it go good for you
[53:39] see
[53:40] and he's going to attack your home your
[53:42] family but i just say look uh we're
[53:44] going to have to fight and i'd rather
[53:46] fight on the winning side i'd rather
[53:48] fight on the side that i that that
[53:50] fights for something noble i'd i'd
[53:52] rather i'd rather give my life i'd
[53:54] rather go down and defeat defending the
[53:56] right than survive defending the wrong
[54:03] and so you know when we begin to look at
[54:05] it how that go up to verse 2 brother
[54:08] matt sorry verse 2 and he cried mightily
[54:10] with a strong voice saying
[54:12] babylon the great is fallen it's fallen
[54:16] and it's become the habitation of devils
[54:19] and a hold of every foul spirit and a
[54:22] cage of every unclean and hateful bird
[54:26] now we've now leave that right there
[54:27] we've shown you
[54:29] how that
[54:31] babylon this is really a spirit yeah it
[54:33] manifested itself in history just like
[54:36] the the plagues that come out of the
[54:38] vials it you know it's it's actually had
[54:41] a manifestation
[54:43] in history and you can we've actually in
[54:46] our series been able to go back and tie
[54:49] relevant historical events you know and
[54:52] and we didn't get them all because
[54:54] because the early parts of the vials are
[54:56] ambiguous and unclear to us i think
[54:58] moses and elijah will know exactly what
[55:01] every one of them were when they go to
[55:02] the jews but we find that the prophet
[55:05] did give us the ones that were relevant
[55:07] to us we understand how that how the how
[55:10] that that fourth trumpet and fourth vial
[55:12] and fifth trumpet and fifth file and six
[55:15] trumpet and six file and seven and seven
[55:17] how they begin churning
[55:19] as the 20th century approached and and
[55:22] god's going to start it all in and pick
[55:24] up the woes and the churches
[55:26] the church is going to have an effect
[55:27] and the politics are going to have an
[55:29] effect and these things aren't accidents
[55:31] to me that when the world looks at the
[55:33] world and the tragedies that have
[55:35] befallen it yes to us we're not
[55:38] numb to that
[55:40] we don't say oh well it just all had to
[55:42] be in in whatever whatever no we lament
[55:44] the loss of life we lament that babies
[55:47] died we lament the terrible wars and the
[55:49] terrible plagues but you know i i but at
[55:52] the same time i'm i'm i'm ready to
[55:55] remind mankind you chose this path
[55:59] this is the cruelty of sin that not only
[56:02] did you choose in genesis you've been
[56:05] choosing it down through history you're
[56:08] still choosing it today
[56:11] they will not god sent the greatest
[56:14] message the world has seen since the
[56:16] days of christ in the early church and
[56:18] the same way they rejected jesus then
[56:21] they reject jesus now the same way they
[56:24] rejected his church then they reject it
[56:27] now so you know man cannot it is it is
[56:31] illegitimate of man to blame god
[56:35] for the
[56:36] horrors of the world
[56:39] god is trying everything he can to save
[56:42] man even save him from his own self
[56:45] man seems hell-bent and determined to
[56:49] end up in destruction and we're gonna i
[56:52] don't want to get ahead of myself i'm
[56:53] being very careful i want to be very
[56:55] very
[56:56] studious today because i want to make
[56:57] these points uh slowly and i'll get to
[57:00] preaching between them that's the way
[57:02] i've decided to go with it today
[57:04] and so
[57:05] so when we when we look at how
[57:09] they've committed fornication and it and
[57:11] babylon the great is fallen cried with a
[57:15] mighty voice strong voice saying babylon
[57:18] the greatest fallen has fallen we showed
[57:20] you babylon in the beginning of the
[57:22] bible
[57:23] under ancient babylon under nimrod
[57:25] babylon in the middle of the bible under
[57:27] nebuchadnezzar and babylon at the end
[57:30] time our day only now it's called
[57:33] mystery babylon
[57:36] and it's a mystery to the world and
[57:38] that's why they fall for it i'm thankful
[57:40] that i've been brought into the mystery
[57:43] and it's no longer confusing to me
[57:46] a mystery is only mysterious when you're
[57:48] on the outside
[57:49] once you've been brought into the
[57:51] mystery once you've come into the
[57:53] fellowship that's why paul said you've
[57:55] been called under this gathering and
[57:57] paul says that several times in
[57:59] scripture you
[58:01] you've been called to a gathering it's a
[58:03] gathering around the word of god it's a
[58:05] gathering around the re the revelation
[58:07] of the hour
[58:08] to bring you into the right mental state
[58:11] to bring you into the mind of christ so
[58:14] that you become impervious to the
[58:17] deception of the world and that's really
[58:20] what this age is called to overcome
[58:25] your calling
[58:27] and your election is made sure unto you
[58:30] because you have overcome the deception
[58:34] of the
[58:34] hour all right
[58:36] that's what that's the burden that's
[58:38] upon us we must overcome the deception
[58:41] of the hour and then and then from there
[58:44] god will take care of every last other
[58:47] single detail about it he'll have you
[58:50] perfected don't you worry he'll have you
[58:53] ready amen
[58:55] so we find then that
[58:57] that this whole idea
[58:59] how that it could be this whole thing of
[59:01] fornication
[59:03] and how that people could say
[59:05] wow you know that's that's sexual
[59:07] misconduct well
[59:09] remember that that a deed
[59:12] is only the manifestation of a thought
[59:14] not brought subject to god
[59:17] so first it had to be a thought see
[59:19] and so just like that's why the bible
[59:22] says you bring every thought that's
[59:24] contrary to god's word anything that's
[59:26] sinful evil or ungodly is contrary to
[59:28] god's word anything that reasons god's
[59:30] word or doubts god's word you're to
[59:32] bring that subject you're to capture it
[59:34] in your mind
[59:36] but if you don't capture it in your mind
[59:37] it'll become a deed
[59:39] see and you capture it in your mind and
[59:41] you take it to the holy spirit in prayer
[59:43] and the holy ghost will quash it
[59:45] immediately
[59:46] and so so we cast down vain imaginations
[59:49] and anything that exalts itself like
[59:52] telling you oh that's a little thin sin
[59:55] it doesn't really matter a whole lot
[59:57] that's a thought that's exalting itself
[59:59] against the word of god see
[1:00:01] so so you so we find then that
[1:00:04] that the world has a hard time reckoning
[1:00:07] when we
[1:00:08] when they read in their bible about
[1:00:10] fornication and we come along and say
[1:00:13] that's false teaching
[1:00:16] and they go false teaching but it says
[1:00:18] fornication right but remember it's a
[1:00:20] spirit and the first act of fornication
[1:00:24] in genesis was not the act between eve
[1:00:28] and the serpent the first fornication
[1:00:31] was when satan misinterpreted god's word
[1:00:33] and he felt for it and brother branham
[1:00:35] says when she believed his lie
[1:00:38] then she received his l-i-f-e
[1:00:42] amen so you you realize then that the
[1:00:45] world is found to be an adulterous woman
[1:00:48] this is why the bible calls the great
[1:00:54] and her daughter's
[1:00:55] harlots
[1:00:57] it's not because they're all having sex
[1:00:59] orgies
[1:01:00] it's because they have a they're they're
[1:01:03] having a fornicating spirit against the
[1:01:06] seed of christ and his seed is his word
[1:01:09] and when you deny his word that's
[1:01:12] fornication with the world
[1:01:15] which proves i mean what you're reading
[1:01:17] here in genesis i'm sorry in revelation
[1:01:21] proves the serpent's seed in genesis it
[1:01:24] proves what that was all about
[1:01:26] see
[1:01:27] that the act the physical act only was a
[1:01:30] was a consequence of the spiritual act
[1:01:34] that preceded it so then today friends
[1:01:37] how are you going to be found virgins in
[1:01:39] christ because you have believed the
[1:01:42] word
[1:01:43] you have like mary said i hear the word
[1:01:45] i don't understand it all i can't figure
[1:01:47] out how it's going to be to me it looks
[1:01:49] impossible but you said it i believe it
[1:01:52] amen
[1:01:53] so be it unto me and that is the pattern
[1:01:57] of the bride of christ through millennia
[1:02:00] amen
[1:02:01] it's never not been that way see
[1:02:04] she's always believed that's been her
[1:02:06] identifying mark a virtuous woman that's
[1:02:09] always been her identifying mark
[1:02:11] is that is that she remains faithful
[1:02:14] see to to receive only the seat of her
[1:02:16] husband which is which in this case is
[1:02:18] god and and or christ so whether it's
[1:02:21] old testament new testament that was
[1:02:23] always the sin
[1:02:25] that that brought about the deeds
[1:02:28] all right now
[1:02:29] so when we when we find that he says
[1:02:32] here in in in verse 2
[1:02:34] that it's become the habitation of
[1:02:37] devils
[1:02:38] and the hold of every foul spirit
[1:02:41] and a cage of every unclean and hateful
[1:02:44] bird now it's hard to comprehend
[1:02:48] how that how how that something that
[1:02:50] started so small
[1:02:53] and seemed so innocent in matthew 13
[1:02:57] how that that could could become what we
[1:03:01] read here
[1:03:02] that it's because in matthew 13 it was
[1:03:05] simply uh
[1:03:06] it was simply a a a a a mustard seed
[1:03:10] that grew into a he said the kingdom of
[1:03:12] heaven is like a man who planted a
[1:03:14] mustard seed which is the smallest
[1:03:17] and it started out as planting a mustard
[1:03:20] seed but then that mustard seed and
[1:03:22] here's where people miss it
[1:03:25] they don't realize seeds grow
[1:03:28] it doesn't stay a small thing one little
[1:03:31] seed of discrepancy against god's word
[1:03:33] will grow into something that will
[1:03:35] pollute your mind your soul your family
[1:03:39] your loved ones whole churches
[1:03:42] have been swept aside
[1:03:45] and put on a shelf by god unable to use
[1:03:48] them effectively anymore because they
[1:03:50] ran out on what looked like a little
[1:03:52] innocent seed but when but see this seed
[1:03:55] grew into a plant
[1:03:56] and then it grew into a tree
[1:03:59] and then the third stage was fowls of
[1:04:01] the air came and lodged in the branches
[1:04:03] and you don't really it's and even in in
[1:04:05] matthew 13 because matthew 13 is the
[1:04:07] seven church ages has them all perfectly
[1:04:10] you you find that that by the time
[1:04:12] revelation identifies that little bitty
[1:04:15] tree that started out as a tiny seed
[1:04:17] grown to a plant and grown to a tree and
[1:04:21] birds landed and lodged in it you find
[1:04:23] by the time you get to the book of
[1:04:25] revelation that that seed small so small
[1:04:29] had perverted and became a hold of every
[1:04:33] fowl spirit and a cage of every unclean
[1:04:37] and hateful bird that's the false church
[1:04:42] so you wonder how can they do
[1:04:45] what they do
[1:04:47] in the name of christ
[1:04:49] because it's a hold of foul spirits
[1:04:52] you wonder why
[1:04:54] there's such a thing as christian rock
[1:04:58] amen
[1:04:59] because it's a cage
[1:05:01] of unclean
[1:05:03] and hateful birds
[1:05:05] you wonder why you can see
[1:05:08] pentecostal charismatic worship services
[1:05:11] and it's nothing but they're back in the
[1:05:13] clubs
[1:05:16] and they've even got all the lights and
[1:05:17] all the booms and everybody's jumping
[1:05:19] and dancing and and and it's and they're
[1:05:22] and they're pretending to worship god
[1:05:25] and actually believe they are and they
[1:05:26] are worshiping a god
[1:05:28] just not the right one
[1:05:30] say how
[1:05:32] have they come to that brother branham
[1:05:33] warned pentecost
[1:05:35] that that would happen he said if you
[1:05:37] don't turn is what he told them in the
[1:05:39] 60s if you don't come back to the word
[1:05:42] of god in 50 years you'll be worse than
[1:05:46] the catholic church
[1:05:49] and they are
[1:05:51] you'll have a more of a decent service
[1:05:54] going to a catholic mass than you will
[1:05:57] to some of these charismatic church
[1:05:58] services
[1:06:00] i don't recommend you take the mass i'm
[1:06:01] just saying you'll have a you'll have
[1:06:04] more of a decency in the air and more of
[1:06:07] a respect than you'll see in some of
[1:06:09] these so-called church services of today
[1:06:12] how's that become possible because it
[1:06:14] became a hold of every foul spirit and
[1:06:16] the cage of every unclean bird verse
[1:06:18] three for all nations have drunk over
[1:06:20] the wine
[1:06:22] of the wrath of her fornication and the
[1:06:24] kings of the earth have committed
[1:06:26] fornication with her and the merchants
[1:06:28] of the earth are waxed rich through the
[1:06:30] abundance of her delicacies verse 4 and
[1:06:33] i heard another voice from heaven saying
[1:06:36] come out of her my people
[1:06:38] notice it's my people
[1:06:40] so even in a perverted world god has
[1:06:42] people
[1:06:44] that ye be not partakers of her sins so
[1:06:47] that so you're different
[1:06:50] see
[1:06:50] and that you and that ye receive not of
[1:06:53] her plagues and so brother branham makes
[1:06:56] this statement why i'm against organized
[1:06:58] religion everybody always wondered
[1:07:00] william branham you know why are you
[1:07:02] always rocking the boat why are you
[1:07:05] always against things why are you always
[1:07:06] criticizing our organizations so brother
[1:07:09] branham preaches two sermons why we are
[1:07:11] not a denomination
[1:07:14] and why i'm against you've asked the
[1:07:15] question i'm going to give you an answer
[1:07:17] why i'm against organized religion he
[1:07:19] says look immediately
[1:07:21] after her mystery was made known who she
[1:07:24] was what she was
[1:07:26] who her daughters was
[1:07:28] the see
[1:07:29] watch see who her daughters was the
[1:07:32] mystery has been made known
[1:07:35] then god sent an angel
[1:07:38] a messenger to what
[1:07:40] call
[1:07:41] out
[1:07:43] the message of the hour see so the
[1:07:46] message of the hour came to identify
[1:07:49] that's why revelation 17
[1:07:51] when it opens up with an angel having
[1:07:53] having one of the seven vials it's
[1:07:55] obviously the seventh because of it what
[1:07:57] he's what he's gonna do he's going to
[1:08:00] identify the system and call it
[1:08:02] out and identify her harlot daughters
[1:08:05] and identify it as death and he's gonna
[1:08:07] come out of her my people
[1:08:09] see
[1:08:11] so clearly the messenger of the last day
[1:08:16] you will notice that he has an
[1:08:18] identifying message because he must be
[1:08:21] able to identify the antichrist system
[1:08:24] and his deeds he's got to be able you
[1:08:28] know to discern the secrets uh and past
[1:08:31] sins of that horse system that only a
[1:08:35] prophet could
[1:08:36] do no one could discern
[1:08:40] the
[1:08:41] thoughts and intents of the heart of
[1:08:43] lucifer except a prophet
[1:08:46] and lucifer held that close but one day
[1:08:50] isaiah stood up and said i'm going to
[1:08:52] reveal to the whole world satan you
[1:08:54] should have stayed out of my prayer line
[1:08:56] i'm about to tell the whole world i'm
[1:08:57] going to discern the very thoughts and
[1:08:59] secrets of your heart now i'm going to
[1:09:00] write it in a book and tell the whole
[1:09:02] world about it
[1:09:03] here's what you did here's how this
[1:09:05] whole thing got started back in the
[1:09:07] eternities you were fine you were
[1:09:09] perfect in all your ways until iniquity
[1:09:11] was found in you because you had an eye
[1:09:14] disease you said i will ascend i will be
[1:09:16] like god i will set up my kingdom see
[1:09:20] and this and that and that became the
[1:09:22] first signs of an antichrist spirit and
[1:09:24] started a war in heaven which of course
[1:09:26] then uh which as we know spilled over
[1:09:29] into the earth all right now let me keep
[1:09:31] moving
[1:09:33] so for all nations okay uh verse 5 for
[1:09:36] her sins have reached unto heaven
[1:09:39] and god hath remembered her iniquities
[1:09:43] so now all things then are being driven
[1:09:47] by the word of god do you accept that
[1:09:49] today
[1:09:50] the pure word you know and but now watch
[1:09:54] so so now we've established in the and
[1:09:57] i've taken my first 15 or 20 minutes to
[1:09:59] establish
[1:10:01] that what you see happening
[1:10:03] why you have a people who are
[1:10:06] who are chastened and virgins of christ
[1:10:10] in the earth who are living apart from
[1:10:12] the world who don't suffer from the
[1:10:14] madness of the seventh vial
[1:10:18] aren't you glad
[1:10:20] your mind is already sealed from the
[1:10:22] effects of the seventh vial you've
[1:10:24] already passed from death unto life and
[1:10:26] you are impervious
[1:10:28] to the insanity of the world oh we ought
[1:10:30] to just rejoice in that alone i'm
[1:10:32] impervious to the insanity of the world
[1:10:36] see
[1:10:37] so you say well but i got all kinds of
[1:10:39] failures but you have believed the
[1:10:40] message you have understood it you have
[1:10:42] received it and you have desired it from
[1:10:44] your whole heart
[1:10:46] which is why you lament your weaknesses
[1:10:48] you ever think about that it proves that
[1:10:50] you don't want to do those things or
[1:10:52] else why did you repent
[1:10:54] it proves something has happened on the
[1:10:56] inside of you friends your failure
[1:10:58] doesn't mean you're not a son of god
[1:10:59] your failure means that you repent of it
[1:11:02] and that shows the real desire of your
[1:11:04] heart you never wanted to do that in the
[1:11:05] first place
[1:11:07] oh i've rejoiced in that i've gained
[1:11:09] freedom so many times the devil tried to
[1:11:11] mock me and i just remind them of that
[1:11:13] and i go away with my hands up in
[1:11:14] victory every time
[1:11:16] because i believe
[1:11:18] the word of this hour and i see it and i
[1:11:21] crave it and i long for it it's changed
[1:11:22] my whole life change my whole heart
[1:11:24] change my whole perspective
[1:11:26] i'm not the same person i used to be
[1:11:30] see
[1:11:31] there's a difference between
[1:11:33] repenting because you don't want to go
[1:11:34] to hell
[1:11:35] and repenting because that's just not
[1:11:38] you anymore you don't ever want to be
[1:11:40] like that see
[1:11:43] so we find then that there is a pure
[1:11:46] word
[1:11:47] that has been delivered by god for his
[1:11:50] family and that's in the earth
[1:11:52] and that's a seed
[1:11:54] and if you if you feed on it it'll grow
[1:11:57] amen
[1:11:58] so we have the pure word of god
[1:12:00] delivered by the holy spirit for his
[1:12:01] family we also have the seeds of
[1:12:03] discrepancy
[1:12:05] for the uh from the antichrist for the
[1:12:09] world so if the world you know if
[1:12:12] if they would if they could grasp in
[1:12:14] their minds
[1:12:15] that the word of the antichrist
[1:12:18] is literally transforming people
[1:12:22] the the madness that you see
[1:12:25] is because they're being changed into
[1:12:27] the things they gaze at
[1:12:30] and the things they hear is a seed
[1:12:33] that's planted in their heart they don't
[1:12:35] bring it they don't they won't repent of
[1:12:37] the thought and it becomes a deed and
[1:12:39] that's what you're seeing on the streets
[1:12:41] today in every facet of society it
[1:12:44] doesn't matter whether you want to talk
[1:12:45] about politics or the ecumenical system
[1:12:48] or the education system the realms of
[1:12:50] science the realms of technology doesn't
[1:12:52] matter the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:12:54] evil people are making their choice and
[1:12:56] it's it's it's they're literally being
[1:12:59] conformed to the world they're being
[1:13:03] conformed to a false word and paul says
[1:13:06] to you don't be conformed but be
[1:13:09] transformed
[1:13:11] because listen friends if an anti-word
[1:13:14] is is polluting the world and bringing
[1:13:16] insanity and you can see it
[1:13:18] do i have to convince you it's crazy
[1:13:21] do i have to convince you it's perverted
[1:13:23] you can see it i can see it we all see
[1:13:26] it it's a reality that's not a metaphor
[1:13:28] we live with that every day but i'm here
[1:13:30] to tell you if that anti-word can
[1:13:33] produce that in people then surely a
[1:13:35] real word can produce the word of god in
[1:13:38] our lives
[1:13:41] see
[1:13:44] brother david samuel was talking about
[1:13:46] the whole
[1:13:48] concept of
[1:13:49] of you know
[1:13:50] satan talking about how that he's a
[1:13:52] thief
[1:13:57] and then of course god comes christ
[1:13:59] comes as a thief so this whole thing
[1:14:01] about a thief and
[1:14:03] you know he made this point i just
[1:14:05] thought it was so brilliant
[1:14:07] of how is it
[1:14:10] now we're gonna really
[1:14:11] i'm probably going to give you
[1:14:14] in what it what would be in my mind
[1:14:17] the greatest effect of the insanity say
[1:14:19] oh it's the perversion and it's the
[1:14:20] gender identity no that's that's pretty
[1:14:23] bad
[1:14:24] but i'm going to actually show you an
[1:14:26] even greater level of insanity
[1:14:28] say goodness gracious how much worse can
[1:14:30] it get i you know i just i think this is
[1:14:33] going to help you
[1:14:34] not to think about something that's
[1:14:35] coming but to become cognizant that it's
[1:14:38] here now
[1:14:40] and it's happening all around you every
[1:14:42] day of your life this is why we come to
[1:14:44] church this is why we read the bible
[1:14:45] this is why we pray this is why we hear
[1:14:47] tapes it's why we have live ministry
[1:14:49] see it's what paul talked about you're
[1:14:51] you're coming together gather to christ
[1:14:54] gather to the word it's necessary you
[1:14:56] need it see
[1:14:59] so
[1:15:00] so then
[1:15:02] so then here's the insanity
[1:15:05] how is it
[1:15:07] that the lord can actually come as a
[1:15:09] thief
[1:15:12] when he's already given away all the
[1:15:14] secrets
[1:15:17] he's already told everything
[1:15:20] he he
[1:15:21] he's laid out his total plan
[1:15:24] to the whole world
[1:15:26] of how everything will go
[1:15:28] he wrote it in a bible
[1:15:30] he sent a prophet to translate it
[1:15:32] interpret it and point this and make
[1:15:34] modern events clear by prophecy
[1:15:37] how's he going to come as a thief
[1:15:40] when he's already laid out the total
[1:15:41] plan of how everything it will go when
[1:15:44] when he will come
[1:15:46] the the the signs that will be seen
[1:15:50] openly not in a corner
[1:15:53] but around the world seven times
[1:15:56] i mean he already showed when he would
[1:15:59] come he would come in the last age he
[1:16:02] would send a message to redeem a pride
[1:16:05] he would open up the mysteries and be
[1:16:07] united with his bride and the and the
[1:16:09] end result would be the spirit of the
[1:16:10] bride speaking in a unified voice saying
[1:16:13] come
[1:16:15] he's already told how he would do it
[1:16:16] through seven ages how he would send
[1:16:18] seven angels seven stars in his right
[1:16:21] hand he proved it down through history
[1:16:23] nobody could contend with william
[1:16:25] branham's historical selections because
[1:16:27] their life proved
[1:16:29] they were that angel their message
[1:16:31] proved it
[1:16:32] he sends the seventh one and it's been
[1:16:34] proven proven proven proven
[1:16:38] unmistakably so
[1:16:41] people have to be willfully blind
[1:16:45] to look the other way
[1:16:46] see he showed everything it has happened
[1:16:51] just exactly in every detail as he
[1:16:55] promised
[1:16:57] how he will come in the form of his word
[1:17:00] through a prophet with a supernatural
[1:17:02] ministry how he would call out a bride
[1:17:05] from all the systems of man and and so
[1:17:08] so then that then that begs the question
[1:17:11] how does the world end up in a
[1:17:13] tribulation and judgment
[1:17:16] i mean my goodness when god so clearly
[1:17:19] identified the source of the antichrist
[1:17:23] when god has so clearly
[1:17:26] taught it out of the scriptures
[1:17:28] manifested it by signs and wonders the
[1:17:30] the likes of which you take every other
[1:17:34] ministry on the field during the days
[1:17:36] all of his peers if you put all of the
[1:17:39] ministries on the field in the days of
[1:17:41] william branham and you combined all of
[1:17:44] their miracles and all of their of their
[1:17:46] supernatural power it would not begin to
[1:17:50] even come close
[1:17:53] to matching what god did in one kentucky
[1:17:56] hillbilly
[1:18:00] how does the world how when god would so
[1:18:04] clearly identify the truth
[1:18:07] and so clearly identify the antichrist
[1:18:10] scheme how he would deceive the nations
[1:18:14] by a false light how he would lead the
[1:18:16] world into perversion of the word and
[1:18:19] then and then when fed upon would lead
[1:18:22] minds to being poisoned and through
[1:18:24] science and through technology and
[1:18:26] beauty that would grow exponentially and
[1:18:29] it would it would start to permeate all
[1:18:31] facets of our life
[1:18:33] and it would literally just begin to
[1:18:34] move through society and it all started
[1:18:37] with a little perverted word
[1:18:40] and it and it and it took over pulpits
[1:18:42] which then took over holmes which then
[1:18:44] broke motherhood the backbone of the
[1:18:46] nation which then moved into politics
[1:18:47] which moved into the courts which moved
[1:18:49] into science which moved into all forms
[1:18:51] of education which then ramped up the
[1:18:53] entertainment industry which then ramped
[1:18:55] up everything else and then in craft and
[1:18:57] commerce and the whole thing has become
[1:18:59] global
[1:19:00] and the whole thing has twisted it
[1:19:02] upside down and perverted inside out and
[1:19:04] nasty and filthy
[1:19:06] and when god showed it what happened how
[1:19:10] it happened why it happened how to
[1:19:12] escape it and the world and almost in
[1:19:15] almost the entire majority of the world
[1:19:17] millions will go we are will will be a
[1:19:20] fighter for an atomic age that's right
[1:19:23] amen
[1:19:24] now you want to talk about insanity
[1:19:27] so i said to you
[1:19:29] that's a far greater
[1:19:31] level of insanity
[1:19:34] people who miss the rapture will do so
[1:19:37] because they're insane
[1:19:40] because it's been made too clear
[1:19:43] it's been made too plain see
[1:19:46] how that he goes on to describe the
[1:19:48] antichrist system
[1:19:50] how that the antichrist would the bible
[1:19:53] is so clear see
[1:19:55] you know
[1:19:56] especially young young people as you
[1:19:59] study the word of god and you're taught
[1:20:00] the word of god by your parents and your
[1:20:02] sunday school teachers and and uh and
[1:20:05] and and the at the youth meetings you
[1:20:07] just remember that that this word that
[1:20:10] we believe and i'm not just talking
[1:20:12] about god sending a prophet i'm talking
[1:20:13] about everything we believe
[1:20:15] is so clear and so provable in the
[1:20:18] scriptures that it's incontrovertible
[1:20:20] and can't be confounded using this book
[1:20:25] i have challenged that openly around the
[1:20:27] world and have proved it
[1:20:29] i've stood face to face with doctors of
[1:20:31] divinity and phds and lld's and some of
[1:20:34] the most rudimentary things that we
[1:20:36] understand and how the bible all begins
[1:20:38] to connect and it absolutely leaves them
[1:20:41] without any solution or answer and
[1:20:43] they're finally just put to complete
[1:20:44] silence
[1:20:46] say brother jason does that make you
[1:20:48] anything it doesn't make me anything i
[1:20:49] was a dummy and a sinner but god loved
[1:20:52] me and saved me and sat me down in front
[1:20:55] of this book when i was a young man and
[1:20:56] i've been studying it my whole life and
[1:20:57] i went through those tapes and i
[1:20:59] compared them to the bible and i
[1:21:00] listened to the tape and i compared it
[1:21:02] to the bible and it fits it fits it fits
[1:21:04] it fits it fits and then i look out in
[1:21:06] the world and it fits and it fits and it
[1:21:08] fits and it fits and then i look in my
[1:21:10] life and it fits and it fits and it fits
[1:21:12] and it fits i'm here to tell you we have
[1:21:14] not followed cunningly devised tales
[1:21:18] hallelujah this is life-giving
[1:21:20] life-changing word that god has brought
[1:21:22] in this hour
[1:21:26] and so
[1:21:27] it told how the antichrist
[1:21:30] would take over the old world
[1:21:33] and that it would become mystery babylon
[1:21:35] and
[1:21:36] and then finally how that by the time
[1:21:38] you get to revelation 13
[1:21:41] that it's crossed the ocean now it's
[1:21:42] across the pond
[1:21:44] and now it's coming to ameri into the
[1:21:46] americas and it rises up out of the land
[1:21:48] not out of the sea
[1:21:53] it comes now to to this nation
[1:21:56] to to to
[1:21:58] finish
[1:21:59] his complete takeover of the world
[1:22:03] the bible tells us prophecy tells us the
[1:22:06] message shows us in the scriptures
[1:22:09] how that he would consolidate his
[1:22:11] control
[1:22:12] once he once he came across and got the
[1:22:15] western world
[1:22:17] he now he's not the old one now it's not
[1:22:19] the beast that was rose up out of the
[1:22:22] water that had a deadly wound but was
[1:22:24] healed now it's a beast rising up in
[1:22:27] chapter 13 the number of america
[1:22:30] and now it's a and now he's got both
[1:22:32] sides he's got east and west and now
[1:22:34] satan's in the driver's seat
[1:22:37] you see friends
[1:22:38] he's following christ because just like
[1:22:41] the the red horse goes out and the lion
[1:22:44] goes out to me or the white horse the
[1:22:46] land goes out to meet him and then and
[1:22:48] then you find the red horse goes and the
[1:22:49] ox goes out and then the black horse and
[1:22:51] then a man goes out and then a pale
[1:22:53] horse and then a flying eagle and it's
[1:22:55] this warfare that's been going on and as
[1:22:57] the lightning came out of the east to
[1:22:59] the west so has the antichrist come from
[1:23:01] the east to the west
[1:23:04] that's not an accident
[1:23:06] see
[1:23:08] once he had the western powers of the
[1:23:10] americas
[1:23:13] then he would begin through the early
[1:23:14] part of the 20th century to consolidate
[1:23:16] his control of the world
[1:23:19] through leagues of nations through
[1:23:21] unitings of nations and and and global
[1:23:24] and control of global commerce and
[1:23:27] global craft and everything is known so
[1:23:31] so then how is he
[1:23:33] how is it satan can be a thief how is he
[1:23:35] stealing from people
[1:23:37] when when state has been so identified
[1:23:40] if if a thief was trying to break into
[1:23:42] your home
[1:23:44] and i walked up to your front door he's
[1:23:46] trying to break in and i tap himself
[1:23:47] excuse me and i knock on your door and
[1:23:49] get you out of bed and bring in the door
[1:23:50] and say say brother mark this guy's
[1:23:52] trying to break into your house
[1:23:54] you think the guy's going to be able to
[1:23:55] brother is going to go okay all right
[1:23:57] well anyway you know
[1:24:00] that thief's not going to get in his
[1:24:01] house
[1:24:02] brother mark's got women to defend that
[1:24:04] he's going to find a rude awakening
[1:24:06] trying to come into that house
[1:24:08] how is it that satan is a thief when a
[1:24:11] prophet has so identified him when the
[1:24:12] word is so identified he went out
[1:24:13] everything it said in the world does
[1:24:15] that does that does that impact your
[1:24:17] minds at all today
[1:24:20] see
[1:24:26] how is it that the world
[1:24:28] could be duped by the antichrist
[1:24:31] and miss the real thing
[1:24:34] and the only logical answer is
[1:24:37] is the world is asleep
[1:24:41] and when you're you know the the we we
[1:24:43] read from the
[1:24:44] scriptures that
[1:24:46] that that they have blinded themselves
[1:24:51] that's prophecy
[1:24:53] the bible says their eyes
[1:24:55] they have closed
[1:24:58] their ears they have stopped
[1:25:01] lest at any time the glorious light of
[1:25:04] the gospel should come and they should
[1:25:05] see it and hear it
[1:25:06] and be converted and i would heal them
[1:25:10] see so now god is showing his intention
[1:25:12] if they would just believe it th this is
[1:25:14] god's showing mercy like he did to cain
[1:25:16] if you'll just do as your brother i'll
[1:25:18] make a way for you
[1:25:19] see god's trying to give everybody a
[1:25:21] legitimate shot to save themselves
[1:25:24] but he says your eyes you have closed
[1:25:26] and you will not come to me jesus said
[1:25:28] you won't come to me that you may
[1:25:29] receive life why
[1:25:31] why will you die
[1:25:33] see
[1:25:35] and so there we find they're asleep they
[1:25:38] have they have blinded themselves and
[1:25:40] closed their own ears mankind chose the
[1:25:43] path of rejecting god's word and every
[1:25:46] age from genesis to now i think that's
[1:25:48] pretty clear
[1:25:49] i don't think that can be
[1:25:51] denied unless you're insane
[1:25:56] so now
[1:25:57] now that he's done that
[1:26:00] and and i mean a rudimentary look at
[1:26:03] history will show that he's done that
[1:26:05] i mean that's what wars and rumors of
[1:26:08] wars are all about
[1:26:10] that's what pestilence and plagues and
[1:26:12] things are all about mankind eating from
[1:26:14] the tree of knowledge has destroyed
[1:26:16] himself
[1:26:18] that many of the plagues that they have
[1:26:19] even to this day ebola and marburg and
[1:26:22] all these different kinds of
[1:26:24] lethal viruses they found that they were
[1:26:27] in the jungles naturally and they
[1:26:28] cleared all the rain forest and cut down
[1:26:30] all the jungles because of progress
[1:26:33] and they ended up moving those things
[1:26:35] into a different state that released
[1:26:36] them as a viral uh pathogen
[1:26:40] and and it and it and it literally
[1:26:42] people breathe it in and it becomes a
[1:26:44] virus down on the inside of them that
[1:26:46] liquefies their organs
[1:26:48] and they die of most horrible death
[1:26:50] see
[1:26:51] and brother branham says the more he
[1:26:53] eats from the tree of knowledge the more
[1:26:55] death is associated with it that's
[1:26:57] undeniable
[1:26:59] that's undeniable the more knowledge the
[1:27:01] more death say yeah but there's a lot of
[1:27:03] good well sure it's a tree of knowledge
[1:27:04] of good and evil that's the whole point
[1:27:06] but you're going to get one with the
[1:27:08] other i want to treat a life that has no
[1:27:10] death associated at all i'm looking for
[1:27:12] a world that won't need science and
[1:27:15] technology
[1:27:16] brother branham said i'll have no
[1:27:17] education at all and then he turns right
[1:27:19] around he says it'll be an education so
[1:27:20] far superior to this man-made
[1:27:23] understanding won't even be comparable
[1:27:27] see
[1:27:30] so now that he's done that
[1:27:32] and he's spent 6 000 years since eden
[1:27:36] rejecting the word of god rejecting god
[1:27:39] in every age from genesis to now
[1:27:42] now
[1:27:43] now
[1:27:44] he arrives at the seventh vial
[1:27:48] now he's got a problem
[1:27:50] because the seventh vial starts with a
[1:27:53] plague released into the air
[1:27:55] driving the insanity to levels on before
[1:28:00] unknown before
[1:28:02] and that's why we can look and and say
[1:28:04] just in our short lifetime just in my
[1:28:06] short lifetime i can just look back
[1:28:08] halfway just halfway through my short
[1:28:10] life and look at what from there to here
[1:28:13] and it's almost unrecognizable
[1:28:16] what the the minds of men have come to
[1:28:20] and you know we were brother um already
[1:28:22] was talking here about
[1:28:24] uh about the
[1:28:26] some of the european and this is true
[1:28:27] i've experienced the same thing you know
[1:28:29] they they've been taught so long this
[1:28:32] gender identity thing that when they see
[1:28:34] perverted uh relationships homosexual
[1:28:37] relationships over in some of those
[1:28:39] scandinavian countries and european
[1:28:40] countries kids have been taught that so
[1:28:42] long in school since kindergarten that
[1:28:44] to them it's absolutely nothing
[1:28:47] and they're all they're actually shocked
[1:28:48] that like you have a problem with that
[1:28:50] are you like weird
[1:28:52] and they're not it's not a religious
[1:28:54] devil it's that they've literally been
[1:28:56] brainwashed for decades
[1:28:58] we're just now starting to get it
[1:29:00] because it that the perversion keeps
[1:29:02] coming in this way you understand and so
[1:29:04] that's the agenda to to show that the
[1:29:08] that the antichrist the antichrist has
[1:29:10] always wanted to portray himself as the
[1:29:13] god worthy of worship
[1:29:15] see that he's always wanted to have a
[1:29:17] kingdom like christ
[1:29:19] and so we find that now he comes to the
[1:29:22] seventh age the seventh vial the seventh
[1:29:25] seal and now insanity is being released
[1:29:28] on an insane age get it insanity is now
[1:29:31] being released tribulation insanity is
[1:29:34] being released on an already insane age
[1:29:38] satan has control of all the channels
[1:29:40] now all the agendas he's filling the air
[1:29:44] with the plague under the seventh vial
[1:29:48] you need to be aware of that friends
[1:29:50] he's literally he's controlling all
[1:29:52] channels he's controlling all agendas
[1:29:55] doesn't matter which
[1:29:57] part of the society fabric of society
[1:30:00] you want to talk about politics religion

[1:30:15] under the seventh vial and
[1:30:18] i mean he's got control and hey you you

[1:30:23] minute he controls both sides

[1:30:34] amen and people say oh there's a
[1:30:36] pandemic oh it's a plan gimmick how
[1:30:39] about we use brother branham's word it's
[1:30:40] a plan demonic
[1:30:43] that's what it is satan is in control
[1:30:46] and he controls both sides the red and
[1:30:48] the blue the conservative and the
[1:30:49] liberal it doesn't matter he's
[1:30:51] controlling all agendas he controls both
[1:30:55] sides of the media both sides of the
[1:30:57] entertainment industry both sides
[1:31:04] so i hate the media i do too
[1:31:07] especially since he's in control of both
[1:31:09] sides of it
[1:31:11] one side is just as bad as the other yes
[1:31:14] i mean it doesn't doesn't matter it
[1:31:16] doesn't matter which which political hot
[1:31:18] potato you want to talk about he's in
[1:31:20] control of it all
[1:31:23] even even noble endeavors yeah
[1:31:26] it's a racial injustice is a noble
[1:31:28] endeavor i'm sorry satan controls both
[1:31:30] sides of it
[1:31:31] amen
[1:31:32] there will be no peace till jesus comes
[1:31:35] hallelujah oh that's why i love the
[1:31:37] family of god it never has mattered one
[1:31:40] second to the family of god red yellow
[1:31:43] black and white they are all precious in
[1:31:45] his sight
[1:31:46] hallelujah

[1:31:59] here's an insane for you now he controls
[1:32:01] social media
[1:32:04] now that's a that's the next level
[1:32:07] see
[1:32:08] i want you young people to think about
[1:32:09] that old people too think about social
[1:32:13] media i get that it's part of life and
[1:32:15] we use it to communicate and all these
[1:32:16] kinds of different things but you just
[1:32:18] remember who's in control of it friends
[1:32:20] people will get involved with social
[1:32:23] media and entertainments that they would
[1:32:26] never be associated with out in the open
[1:32:33] enough said
[1:32:36] satan
[1:32:37] already has
[1:32:39] control of the politics he already has
[1:32:41] control of the educational system he
[1:32:44] already has control of science and
[1:32:46] technology he already has control of
[1:32:48] finance and wealth
[1:32:50] the whole world
[1:32:52] uh is geared to it and and the whole
[1:32:55] system of the world is facilitating this
[1:32:58] 24 7 tree of knowledge say are you why
[1:33:02] are you preaching uh on this today
[1:33:04] because i'm stirring you up i'm i'm
[1:33:07] making you aware
[1:33:08] be be aware of his devices
[1:33:12] they're very cunning and very subtle and
[1:33:15] the whole world is geared now to
[1:33:17] facilitate this tree of knowledge
[1:33:19] although god has warned them
[1:33:23] and god has described in detail how the
[1:33:26] antichrist will move they still
[1:33:29] fall for it
[1:33:31] though he has declared
[1:33:33] his own plan of redemption since the
[1:33:36] days of genesis it's all through the
[1:33:38] bible yet the world stumbles right
[1:33:42] past it amen
[1:33:44] see
[1:33:45] you know when you're asleep
[1:33:48] you're alive
[1:33:50] but you're unaware
[1:33:54] you're alive
[1:33:56] when you're asleep you're alive
[1:33:58] but you're unaware see
[1:34:01] they are they are literally
[1:34:04] passing out drunk
[1:34:07] how they get drunk on the wine of the
[1:34:10] fornication of the beast
[1:34:14] but there's a people
[1:34:15] who can't miss it hallelujah
[1:34:19] there's a word that's been activated
[1:34:21] down in you and i and i'm here to tell
[1:34:23] you just as that antichrist system has
[1:34:25] accomplished its purpose this word once
[1:34:28] activated in a believer will accomplish
[1:34:30] its purpose
[1:34:31] this word will also take on an image
[1:34:34] that anti-word is building an image but
[1:34:36] this word is also building an image of a
[1:34:38] virtuous queen
[1:34:39] a bride who's
[1:34:41] come apart from the world and said i
[1:34:43] will not be a part of that i may live
[1:34:45] here but i'm not of here and i'm not
[1:34:47] from here and i ain't staying here
[1:34:50] hallelujah
[1:34:51] i'll come back when jesus is the king of
[1:34:53] the whole earth
[1:34:55] oh my in all seven ages
[1:34:58] to those who would be called out of this
[1:35:01] world
[1:35:02] we are being trained we are being
[1:35:04] conditioned do you accept that today
[1:35:07] the word came to call you out and to
[1:35:09] train you and lift you up
[1:35:12] and transform you
[1:35:15] there's a hidden manna
[1:35:18] that's unknown to the world
[1:35:21] say well that's unfair no they blinded
[1:35:23] their own self remember
[1:35:24] they closed their own eyes they stopped
[1:35:27] up their own ears see
[1:35:29] it's a hidden manna
[1:35:30] it wasn't that god was trying to be
[1:35:32] devious
[1:35:33] it's that mankind didn't want it and
[1:35:35] when you don't want god's word then
[1:35:37] he'll just retract it and you'll never
[1:35:39] be able to see it again
[1:35:40] see he's only obligated to call you one
[1:35:43] time
[1:35:44] to be a just god
[1:35:46] and so we find that that that that we
[1:35:48] have a bride here today that's a bride
[1:35:51] like mary who's received the word of our
[1:35:54] day and we're being transformed
[1:35:56] into what into the image of the word
[1:35:59] that happened to mary physically it's
[1:36:01] going to happen to you physically
[1:36:03] mary physically was transformed in her
[1:36:05] body to match the image of the word
[1:36:09] virgin shall be beacon shall conceive
[1:36:12] and bring forth a child hallelujah it
[1:36:14] became obvious who the virgin was to the
[1:36:17] whole world now they had a bad opinion
[1:36:19] of her but not god god knew exactly who
[1:36:22] the virgin was
[1:36:24] because why she had said be it unto me
[1:36:27] and her body began to be transformed
[1:36:30] say oh if i could just transform myself
[1:36:32] mary didn't transform herself no man
[1:36:34] touched her it was the word of god
[1:36:37] believed in her heart and it literally
[1:36:39] changed her abraham had a change in his
[1:36:42] body sarah had a change in her body
[1:36:44] because they believed god
[1:36:48] hallelujah
[1:36:50] that's word that's the word that's
[1:36:52] becoming flesh
[1:36:53] that's what happens in every believer
[1:36:55] the word which you receive
[1:36:57] takes on an image
[1:37:00] god sends his word forth
[1:37:02] you believe it
[1:37:05] and he knows and those who are in the
[1:37:07] mind of god before the foundation of the
[1:37:09] world
[1:37:10] they'll run to that light every single
[1:37:12] time people it might be people who don't
[1:37:14] know anything about god
[1:37:17] you don't have to be somebody great that
[1:37:19] might probably will hinder you you could
[1:37:21] be a you could be a nobody oh my i like

[1:39:38] me
[1:39:39] from glory to glory it's changing me oh
[1:39:42] my if you think about it friends you
[1:39:44] didn't choose the age you would come in
[1:39:46] you didn't choose the word that would
[1:39:48] come to you you didn't choose the
[1:39:49] outcome somebody else chose you
[1:39:53] somebody else is in control of this
[1:39:55] thing and his word will not return void
[1:40:01] hallelujah is rejoicing that today
[1:40:04] his word will not return to him void
[1:40:09] oh
[1:40:10] my
[1:40:12] he has made it secure
[1:40:14] to all of his family
[1:40:16] i want to read you two quotes and we're
[1:40:18] gonna we're gonna we're gonna stop for
[1:40:19] today i'll carry on
[1:40:22] next time
[1:40:28] brother branham says
[1:40:32] in communion he says this in february
[1:40:36] teaches this and he's going to do it
[1:40:37] again the very next month in march but
[1:40:39] i've there's no need to read two of them
[1:40:41] saying the same thing
[1:40:42] but brother branham is talking about now
[1:40:45] the number the numbers three
[1:40:47] and the number five
[1:40:49] and three being perfection and five
[1:40:52] being grace
[1:40:53] see so it's
[1:40:55] j-e-s-u-s or it's g-r-a-c-e
[1:40:58] or it's
[1:40:59] f-a-i-t-h
[1:41:01] c
[1:41:01] num five is the number of grace now it's
[1:41:04] significant to a prophet now watch him
[1:41:06] make a modern event
[1:41:08] that happened
[1:41:09] in 1962
[1:41:11] might have been the end of 1961 i didn't
[1:41:13] confirm it in the story
[1:41:16] but they had an alignment
[1:41:18] of five stars now this is just prior to
[1:41:21] the seals coming
[1:41:24] and brother branham says we see that the
[1:41:26] astronomers are predicting oh it's
[1:41:28] actually coming
[1:41:29] sometime
[1:41:30] in this early part of the first of the
[1:41:32] month
[1:41:36] beginning on the second or the fifth or
[1:41:38] somewhere
[1:41:39] along this month
[1:41:41] see now
[1:41:42] bear in mind
[1:41:43] if you go look at the titles the
[1:41:45] sequence of events is going to go from
[1:41:47] here on he's more more doors are going
[1:41:49] to be closed brother branham is going to
[1:41:51] finally get completely shut out of
[1:41:53] everything they don't even they don't
[1:41:55] even want his miracles anymore they they
[1:41:57] just as far as they're concerned he's
[1:41:58] gone off the deep end and he finally
[1:42:00] comes to the to the sermon there's the
[1:42:02] present stage of my ministry all men
[1:42:04] hath forsaken me
[1:42:06] and then he has a strange vision that
[1:42:08] troubles him and he hears a blast and he
[1:42:10] comes to the pulpit and sirs is this the
[1:42:14] time
[1:42:15] is this the time sirs what time william
[1:42:18] branham the time he prophesied that
[1:42:20] would come at the end
[1:42:21] when a message would strike the earth to
[1:42:23] call a bride separate her out perfected
[1:42:26] transformer into the image of the word
[1:42:27] and take her home to glory
[1:42:29] have we reached that hour that the
[1:42:31] church have we reached i'll tell you
[1:42:33] something friends on resurrection
[1:42:34] morning it's going to be the day i've
[1:42:36] waited for and looked for my whole life
[1:42:38] here was a prophet saying my goodness
[1:42:40] we've had 2 000 years of church history
[1:42:43] have we finally reached the time
[1:42:46] is this the time of the end sirs
[1:42:50] so now what's he doing he's coming to an
[1:42:53] astronomical
[1:42:55] to to something in astronomy and he says
[1:42:58] he says sometime in the early part of
[1:42:59] the first part of this month beginning
[1:43:01] on the second or fifth somewhere in this
[1:43:02] month the the indian astronomers predict
[1:43:05] the world to blow to pieces
[1:43:07] and the american newspapers make fun of
[1:43:09] it i do not believe the world's going to
[1:43:12] blow to pieces he says but i do say it's
[1:43:15] wrong to make fun of it because
[1:43:17] something's fixing to happen
[1:43:19] one of these days something similar to
[1:43:21] that
[1:43:22] when the five planets mars jupiter venus
[1:43:25] and so forth comes into there he says i
[1:43:27] predict that this has a special
[1:43:29] application i believe
[1:43:32] it's the coming in of the issue of god
[1:43:36] that the great revelations of the word
[1:43:39] will be opened during this time i'll ask
[1:43:42] you a question believers did it happen
[1:43:45] oh my
[1:43:47] oh my remember
[1:43:49] they claim it was three stars come into
[1:43:51] their orbits when jesus was born
[1:43:54] and this is five and five is grace
[1:43:58] the number of grace
[1:43:59] three is the number of perfection
[1:44:02] five is the number of grace j-e-s-u-s
[1:44:06] g-r-a-c-e f-a-i-t-h so forth number of
[1:44:10] grace god ever sends his power to the
[1:44:13] church
[1:44:14] see
[1:44:15] if god ever sends his power to the
[1:44:18] church
[1:44:19] it'll be his grace
[1:44:21] it won't be
[1:44:23] the obedience of the people
[1:44:26] isaiah said in the 40th chapter how to
[1:44:28] cry to jerusalem that her warfare was
[1:44:31] over yet she was guilty of idolatry but
[1:44:34] it was god's grace that was sending it
[1:44:37] god sends anything to us it'll be his
[1:44:39] grace not our merits so it may mean
[1:44:43] something i predict that there will be a
[1:44:44] change i don't know what it'll be but i
[1:44:46] believe it's fixing to happen we're
[1:44:48] right on the eve of it now he goes on in
[1:44:50] the next month to describe it he says
[1:44:52] what is what three stars announced the
[1:44:54] coming messiah announced christ the baby
[1:44:57] he said five stars have lined up he said
[1:44:59] what is it announcing an infant bride
[1:45:01] it's announcing her approach i'm going
[1:45:04] to tell you something friends when god
[1:45:06] took a prophet and he took him into the
[1:45:08] wilderness and fulfilled that vision and
[1:45:12] sent him back for the opening of the
[1:45:13] seals and a message began to sweep in
[1:45:16] and a prophet and the word
[1:45:18] and everything exactly and an infant
[1:45:20] bride who was now ready to come on the
[1:45:22] scene like mary who would believe the
[1:45:24] word of god it would be as i preached
[1:45:27] you here some time ago
[1:45:29] grace is the encampment of the redeemed
[1:45:32] the headstone comes crying grace grace
[1:45:35] unto it
[1:45:37] it's no longer going to be about our
[1:45:39] works and trying to do this and trying
[1:45:41] to do that it's going to be grace say
[1:45:43] well we got faults and we got failure so
[1:45:45] did israel but god was coming to them we
[1:45:48] got idolatry that's right but i'm
[1:45:50] bringing grace i'm coming to redeem
[1:45:52] jerusalem even though jerusalem didn't
[1:45:55] look like they deserved redemption but
[1:45:57] it was grace that came
[1:46:00] and that is what the world now imagine
[1:46:02] being blind to the greatest thing that
[1:46:05] has ever happened in the world where a
[1:46:07] message would come that you could
[1:46:09] believe and receive with your whole mind
[1:46:12] and your whole heart to where it could
[1:46:14] transform you and come down inside and
[1:46:16] activate a seated seat gene of god and
[1:46:18] begin to grow you and mature you and
[1:46:21] raise you up so that god would no longer
[1:46:24] look at you he would only look at his
[1:46:26] word and you're a believer and
[1:46:28] righteousness is imputed to you like it
[1:46:31] was abraham
[1:46:33] hallelujah i'm glad my eyes are open
[1:46:36] i'm glad i see blessed are your eyes and
[1:46:38] your ears for they see in here
[1:46:42] oh we are to be glad this morning
[1:46:44] friends we ought to rejoice in the grace
[1:46:48] of almighty god
[1:46:50] see this is exactly why now watch now
[1:46:53] brother branham is going to extrapolate
[1:46:55] that now you're going to find out
[1:46:57] why this next point was so important to
[1:46:59] him and i'm going to stop right here
[1:47:02] now brother branham comes the end of
[1:47:03] 1965
[1:47:06] and he's in his vile series he's
[1:47:08] finishing it out
[1:47:10] a thinking man's filter
[1:47:13] now the bride has come a long ways
[1:47:15] since february 1962.
[1:47:18] now she's in night the end of 1965
[1:47:22] and everything that i've preached you
[1:47:24] this morning has become true
[1:47:26] and a prophet is about to leave the
[1:47:28] earth
[1:47:29] and here's one of the last things
[1:47:31] that he's going to give to the church
[1:47:34] to get you home how many want it
[1:47:38] this is one of the last points
[1:47:41] that he wants you to absorb
[1:47:44] lest the plague of the seventh vial
[1:47:47] affect your mind
[1:47:50] how many want it
[1:47:52] how many want to keep a sane mind
[1:47:54] how many want to stay pleasing to god
[1:47:57] you want to avoid the insanity of the
[1:47:59] world
[1:48:00] all right here he comes
[1:48:02] uh we've been quoting and quoting and
[1:48:04] quoting
[1:48:04] during this series what have we been
[1:48:06] telling you it's brother branham he
[1:48:08] wasn't preaching on the vials but he was
[1:48:10] preaching the things that would impact
[1:48:13] us because the vials were partially
[1:48:15] poured out
[1:48:16] and this is how you stay sane and this
[1:48:18] is how you one of the ways among all the
[1:48:20] other ones that we've been reading to
[1:48:22] you
[1:48:23] here's one of the last ones
[1:48:28] as the days grow closer
[1:48:31] and closer

[1:49:05] closer
[1:49:07] and the narrowing of the path

[1:49:18] these weeks remember i read you the
[1:49:19] quote where he come to the end he said
[1:49:20] now i think you've got a better idea of
[1:49:23] what those vials have been about

[1:49:29] end of our series i've got other
[1:49:30] meetings to go preach now let me give
[1:49:32] you one of these last things
[1:49:34] as the day grows closer and closer and
[1:49:37] the narrowing of the path we want to
[1:49:39] grow closer together
[1:49:41] we must be just one
[1:49:44] one
[1:49:45] body we must move together
[1:49:49] i hope you're going to say amen to this
[1:49:50] one forgetting one another's sins
[1:49:55] and our differences
[1:49:58] and just stick closer and closer and
[1:50:01] closer as we see that day approaching
[1:50:06] assembling of ourselves together
[1:50:10] that was weak assembling ourselves
[1:50:12] together
[1:50:15] all with one accord
[1:50:18] and one heart and if a brother
[1:50:20] sister
[1:50:21] gets out of the way in any way
[1:50:26] that's pretty broad
[1:50:28] this is seventh vial advice
[1:50:30] this keeps you sane this is an
[1:50:32] inoculation
[1:50:35] if a brother sister gets out of the way
[1:50:38] in any way
[1:50:40] don't do nothing
[1:50:42] but pray for that person
[1:50:46] and in love
[1:50:48] always
[1:50:49] considering
[1:50:51] one another
[1:50:54] here's some vile protection
[1:50:56] don't never
[1:50:58] let one of you get away stay
[1:51:00] together
[1:51:02] and if you can
[1:51:03] add more to it constantly
[1:51:06] all the time
[1:51:08] hallelujah
[1:51:10] i just say okay brother branham
[1:51:13] all right thank you thank you faithful
[1:51:15] messenger i'm going to do that i'm going
[1:51:16] to put it into practice because i
[1:51:19] realized that five stars came and it was
[1:51:21] grace and it's no longer going to be my
[1:51:24] ups and downs and ins and outs and my
[1:51:26] favorites and my weaknesses and all my
[1:51:28] obedience whether i am or whether i'm
[1:51:29] not i have a desire to be because why
[1:51:32] i've been changed i've cut something has
[1:51:35] been activated inside of me
[1:51:38] and my whole desire now is for god and
[1:51:41] if i make a little mistake don't hold it
[1:51:43] against me
[1:51:44] don't do nothing but pray for me if you
[1:51:46] make a little mistake i won't hold it
[1:51:48] against you we won't we'll we'll stay
[1:51:50] together we'll pull together we'll pray
[1:51:52] for one another we'll assemble ourselves
[1:51:54] together come on bethel amen hallelujah
[1:51:58] that's our protection that's just as as
[1:52:00] big of a part of your seventh vile
[1:52:03] inoculation as as it is to understand
[1:52:06] the mystery of the antichrist system
[1:52:09] because he might he might can't fool you
[1:52:12] on doctrine but if he if he trips you on
[1:52:14] that one you'll still you'll still
[1:52:16] offend one for whom christ died
[1:52:19] and you'll still judge your brother when
[1:52:21] paul said you should never do that
[1:52:24] see
[1:52:26] so

[1:57:47] sung about it we've preached about it
[1:57:50] for years but lord i could say now just
[1:57:53] as that prophet right before it was
[1:57:54] happening just months away
