[36:16] amen um I want to say today how grateful
[36:20] I am I was uh uh had a an ability I was
[36:24] actually back there working and
[36:25] listening to the Sunday school at the
[36:26] same time I sure enjoyed brother Matt
[36:29] Smith's class today uh it was tremendous
[36:32] and is um conducive to the direction I'm
[36:35] going in today we're going to hit part
[36:37] nine of our series May finish a day
[36:39] we'll see no promises um but uh I was
[36:43] really enjoying it and I I made a note
[36:45] to myself to remind me to thank you
[36:50] because the the attendance has picked up
[36:52] and I'm so grateful for that we ask you
[36:54] to be more Mindful and try to get here
[36:56] early because of the value that we see
[37:00] in our adult Sunday school class it is
[37:03] it is getting good and good and good her
[37:06] and so you're going to want to be here
[37:08] for that and I just appreciated today
[37:11] all of the attendance that I saw it's
[37:13] not quite uh the full crowd but hey I
[37:16] get it uh but uh you're going to just
[37:18] trust me you're going to want to try to
[37:20] be here for those they're really really
[37:23] good all right um now let me let me
[37:27] switch gears now that I've got you
[37:29] smiling and laughing we might have to
[37:30] make you a little
[37:32] afraid so uh I want to just make a
[37:35] special note that we had um because of
[37:38] the rain and you all know the situation
[37:40] we have with our fellowship hall so we
[37:42] had a particular leak that created a
[37:45] very musty smell so I had instructed
[37:48] brother Charles to leave both doors open
[37:51] and to stay out there as long as he
[37:52] could and ventilate that so when we go
[37:55] out there for lunch it's not stifling
[37:57] cuz it was a rather stifling smell um
[38:01] but but unfortunately that almost like
[38:03] opened the barn door as an invitation
[38:05] for everybody to move in and out of
[38:08] there interrupting the children's Sunday
[38:10] school class that was active and
[38:12] underway sister Nita has taken up that
[38:14] mantle and uh and so we definitely don't
[38:18] want to see that that is um let me to
[38:21] say and this is a little bit of an
[38:23] inside joke with my family we're not
[38:25] talking about the video Booth but the
[38:27] Fellowship Hall is not going to be a
[38:29] youth hangout and my family will
[38:31] probably look at me and giggle over that
[38:33] because they know what that is but but
[38:35] uh Hey listen adults teenagers children
[38:40] parents with ch small children you know
[38:42] we really don't want to see uh and you
[38:45] really shouldn't have you know between
[38:47] our
[38:48] intermission uh all kinds of socializing
[38:51] out around here we're here for a limited
[38:54] amount of time and I'd like to see all
[38:56] the teenagers and little children and
[38:58] adults inside preparing this team works
[39:01] very hard uh to to conduct and make an
[39:05] atmosphere conducive to the presence of
[39:07] the Lord and i' just like them to know
[39:09] that it's worth it and uh we want to be
[39:12] in here doing our part to uh be in
[39:15] prayer be in the presence of God and by
[39:19] no means should teenagers or adults or
[39:22] anyone be going into the fellowship hall
[39:25] during sister Nita Sunday school class
[39:28] and I've asked brother Luther to enforce
[39:31] that strictly now so he's not going to
[39:34] reach out and kill you however he is
[39:38] going to enforce it very very strictly
[39:42] and so um so we're we're we want to have
[39:45] our hearts prepared and uh and our
[39:48] hearts and Minds prepared a lot of hard
[39:50] work uh goes on uh for the atmosphere
[39:54] here to be something the Lord can be
[39:56] pleased with don't just want to rush in
[39:58] and try to get your mind on the I mean
[40:00] it takes some time you know why CU
[40:02] you're a human and it takes you're not a
[40:04] machine it takes a little while to calm
[40:07] your spirit quieten your mind and be
[40:10] ready to enter in to worship so um we uh
[40:15] I I've asked brother Luther to enforce
[40:17] that we don't have a lot of Milling
[40:19] around and socializing outside prior to
[40:24] service starting and in between the
[40:26] intermission and by no means should
[40:28] anyone be invading the the fellowship
[40:31] hall during the time when the children's
[40:33] class is going on sometimes I get it

[42:43] series opposing the Judgment of Heaven

[42:55] to this opening text
[42:57] because I chose it on purpose and in the
[43:00] sermon we're going to circle back and
[43:02] revisit this briefly all right
[43:05] watch but Christ being come and high
[43:09] priest of good things to come by a
[43:12] greater and more perfect Tabernacle not
[43:15] made with hands that is to say not of
[43:18] this building neither by the blood of
[43:22] goats and calves but by his own blood he
[43:25] entered in one into the holy
[43:29] Place having obtained Eternal Redemption
[43:32] for us isn't that beautiful he he
[43:35] obtained Eternal Redemption for
[43:39] us and um for if the blood of bulls and
[43:44] of goats and the ashes of an hepher
[43:47] sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to
[43:52] the purifying of the flesh how much more
[43:56] shall the blood of Christ who through
[43:59] the eternal spirit offered himself

[44:37] at the edge of starting to feedback amen
[44:40] praise the
[44:42] [Music]
[44:44] Lord
[44:47] so the Lord led us in this series to
[44:52] close it out with a real thorough look
[44:56] at perfect faith and we've had an
[44:58] enjoyable time I've uh very greatly
[45:01] enjoyed your U your Keen attention and
[45:05] we're learning together uh the things
[45:08] that I believe that it's time for us to
[45:10] learn and these were things that brother
[45:12] Brandon in his language makes very clear
[45:15] in perfect faith and in not just perfect
[45:17] Faith but in other sermons where he
[45:20] would say things like now today I'm
[45:22] bringing you something that you're going
[45:25] to want to you're going to want to pay
[45:26] close attention to it and he would say
[45:28] because you're going to need it down the
[45:30] road see and so that prophetic insight
[45:34] and you say what was he seeing he might
[45:37] not necessarily have been talking about
[45:39] any specific thing but the Bible talks
[45:42] about how that prophets were often
[45:45] warned in their heart and they would cry
[45:47] out to the people the Bible talks about
[45:49] their when Jesus came in you know for
[45:52] his for his dedication and circumcision
[45:54] as a baby that that Anna
[45:57] uh she was moved by the Holy Spirit and
[46:00] Zacharias was moved by the Holy Spirit
[46:03] and so a lot of times sometimes prophets
[46:06] say things and I you know sometimes
[46:09] they're very clear and then sometimes
[46:11] you wonder do even do they even realize
[46:14] and I I have I think we're at a point
[46:17] where we can say without anybody having
[46:20] a coronary is that this message was
[46:23] Progressive to brother brandham as well
[46:26] it's Progressive to us and he would he
[46:28] would talk about uh you know he come to
[46:30] the end of perfect faith and here's
[46:32] another example where he says now I I'm
[46:35] trying to uh I'm trying to Circle back
[46:39] and I'm trying to come back in again
[46:40] with a fresh understanding to get you to
[46:43] see he says where you've had a faith but
[46:47] I'm trying to get you to understand
[46:49] perfect faith and it's it's it's
[46:52] countenanced in the in the thought of
[46:55] that that down the road and he actually
[46:57] makes the statement you know we're not
[47:00] exactly and and I'm this is in so many
[47:02] words you'll have you'll see the quotes
[47:04] here in a minute but in so many words
[47:06] he's trying to say we're we're not all
[47:09] the way there yet but we are going
[47:12] somewhere and you're really going to
[47:13] need this see and so I'm here to tell
[47:16] you that we're here and we've arrived
[47:19] and you're really going to need this see
[47:21] because this is an hour that is Darkness
[47:24] Beyond almost description the closest
[47:27] that the Bible could come is it would
[47:29] say total darkness covering the Earth
[47:32] and gross Darkness upon the people so we
[47:35] see The Madness of that is in society
[47:37] today and you're not going to fix it I
[47:41] don't care who they elected for
[47:43] president you're not going to fix it you
[47:46] understand because you know I I mean I I
[47:49] I'm glad that that that woke ideology
[47:52] took took a beating on Election Day I'm
[47:55] glad but but I didn't vote for either
[47:57] side cuz I voted for Jesus you
[48:00] understand but I I just want to remind
[48:02] you friends that you can say well you
[48:06] know the the best person got in I would
[48:08] say that you have no way to judge that
[48:11] but here's what you can judge God's
[48:13] person got
[48:15] in so let's just say God's person got in
[48:18] because regardless of which one would
[48:21] have won it neither one of them espouse
[48:25] the Judgment of heaven right amen amen
[48:28] they both oppose the Judgment of Heaven
[48:32] you understand so so we find that the
[48:36] word of God and and you can say well one
[48:38] was closer than the other I probably
[48:40] wouldn't disagree with that that's not
[48:42] my point I'm not here to to make a
[48:45] political supporting statement I'm just
[48:47] here to tell you that the whole world is
[48:50] in opposition to God's word and he knew
[48:53] they would be and he said they would be
[48:55] and they are be right and we're
[48:58] Witnesses of it so we really do need
[49:02] that word that brother brandham said
[49:03] you're going to need that going forward
[49:06] and uh we are here today so I can say to
[49:09] you today you need it all right let's
[49:12] have my um my presentation uh brother
[49:15] Mark and I will um I think I can take it
[49:18] over right here so opposing the Judgment
[49:21] of Heaven part nine which is just for
[49:24] those of you who may not remember it's a
[49:26] it's a very simple the whole theme is in
[49:29] that title that you would think that
[49:31] when the creator of all the world and
[49:33] all the heavens and all the universe and
[49:34] all the people and all the animals and
[49:36] all the air and all of everything cuz
[49:38] there was nothing and he made everything
[49:40] out of nothing then you would think that
[49:42] when God judges a matter and sends down
[49:44] a decree like we get decrees that come
[49:46] down from our Supreme Court they've
[49:48] judged a case and they've said here's
[49:49] what we decided you would think that
[49:52] when the Creator that made everything
[49:54] has has judged a matter and sent down
[49:57] his decree you would think that all
[49:59] creation would go yes sir amen thank you
[50:03] we'll get right on that but we have
[50:05] found that in the streets and in the
[50:08] government and in Social scenes they are
[50:11] demonstrating for everything God is
[50:13] against amen and and they are and they
[50:17] are demonstrating they they are
[50:19] demonstrating for everything God is
[50:21] against and they are demonstrating
[50:23] against everything God is for
[50:27] and we're not we're not we're not here
[50:29] to to you know we're not trying to make
[50:31] a judgmental statement but we're we're
[50:34] the bride is not an infant bride anymore
[50:36] this is a mature bride and we need to
[50:39] face these things and understand that
[50:41] you really can't operate like you did 10
[50:44] years ago even five years ago I'm here
[50:47] to tell you you better not be trying to
[50:49] live in 2024 with the level of
[50:52] spirituality you had in
[50:55] 2023 and and in 2025 you're going to
[50:58] need to more of a spiritual experience
[51:01] not
[51:02] less I think that the Holy Spirit
[51:06] knowing that the
[51:08] tendency would be at the end time even
[51:11] among his family because Paul is talking
[51:13] to his
[51:14] family he's talking to God's family you
[51:17] wouldn't think God's family would need
[51:19] to have this said to them by the Apostle
[51:22] but speaking to God's family he says see
[51:24] that you assemble yourselves more as you
[51:27] see that day approaching it's obvious in
[51:30] that statement that the Holy Spirit knew
[51:33] we would have a tendency or there'd be
[51:35] an atmosphere or life would be too busy
[51:38] or whatever whatever I don't even know
[51:40] all the whatevers but but but there
[51:42] would be a tendency to cause us to pull
[51:44] back from that and the Holy Spirit is
[51:46] saying hey when you get there yeah amen
[51:49] because you're going to get there make
[51:52] sure you don't do that
[51:55] see so so we're looking then at the
[51:59] realization of what perfect faith is and
[52:03] and today by the help of the Lord I I
[52:05] hope to take us to what I'm just for
[52:09] lack of a better way to describe it it's
[52:11] just next level yeah amen and we've
[52:14] already covered quite a a lot of
[52:16] profound truths in the word of God in
[52:19] our study have we not well I hope you're
[52:21] buckled up today because this one's
[52:23] really going to push your limits all
[52:26] right but I but I've I've studied it
[52:28] back and forth through the message
[52:30] through the scriptures and it dovet
[52:33] Tales everywhere perfectly I've spent a
[52:35] lot of time talking to the Lord about it
[52:37] so are are you buckled in all right so
[52:41] we come to Hebrews uh
[52:44] 111:3 now Faith is the substance of
[52:49] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[52:52] Not Seen for by it the elders OB ained a
[52:56] good report through faith we understand
[52:59] that the worlds were framed by the word
[53:01] of God so that things which are seen
[53:04] were not made of things which do appear
[53:06] that is a mouthful so last time when we
[53:11] finished uh our our eighth installment
[53:14] we were we had you know Peter we found
[53:17] Peter sadly turning his attention to the
[53:21] circumstance that was around him he was
[53:23] operating perfect Faith he was violating
[53:26] never law of physics you can't walk on
[53:29] water that's
[53:31] impossible in the natural right but the
[53:34] Supernatural is not bound by the laws of
[53:37] the natural Universe you understand and
[53:41] so what so he at one point he is
[53:45] following the word he's got his eyes on
[53:48] Jesus he's hearing the word of God and
[53:52] and Jesus is saying you know as we said
[53:54] Jesus didn't say go get pray up Jesus
[53:57] just said he said Lord if it's you bid
[53:58] me he said come that was it Peter didn't
[54:02] go he did he didn't he didn't need to go
[54:04] pray as we said he didn't need anyone to
[54:07] pray for him he didn't need a prayer
[54:09] line he didn't need all of these things
[54:11] he because he had his focus on the word
[54:15] of God and all of the circumstances
[54:18] which were around him were
[54:20] dire but there was but but and and just
[54:24] when he stepped out of the boat they
[54:26] didn't get greater or lesser you
[54:29] understand basically what your
[54:32] understanding is is that the
[54:34] circumstances didn't matter amen when
[54:38] you're following the word of God here's
[54:41] perfect Faith the circumstances don't
[54:44] matter they should not have a voice in
[54:47] your head but it was when he turned his
[54:50] attention to the voice in the
[54:53] circumstances oh my and then the and
[54:56] then he began to leave the Realms of the
[54:58] Supernatural and he began to come down
[55:01] as I said last time Satan uh helped
[55:04] Peter come to his senses amen and that's
[55:07] the last thing you need to have happen
[55:08] to you is come down and operate by your
[55:11] human senses which brother brandom said
[55:12] we're not given to you they were they
[55:15] were only given to you to contact this
[55:17] world they were not given to you to lead
[55:19] you spiritually we have a sixth sense
[55:22] that is in the word of God and it
[55:25] ignores all human reasoning and and and
[55:29] circumstances it doesn't look at them
[55:31] and so so he effectively Peter Peter not
[55:37] Jesus Peter himself effectively hindered
[55:41] the supernatural flow uh that uh that
[55:44] had G that was operating in him from the
[55:46] words of the Lord which was not bound by
[55:49] the law of physics and so so there is so
[55:53] then there is
[55:54] today as we closing out last time we're
[55:58] making this point to you that there is
[56:00] an ever increasing challenge that we see
[56:04] today as that great day of the of the
[56:08] Lord now the day of the Lord don't ever
[56:11] forget in the Bible the day of the Lord
[56:13] is Judgment
[56:15] Day I'll send you Elijah the prophet
[56:17] before the great and Dreadful day of the
[56:19] Lord see man the Bible talks about in
[56:22] The Book of Revelation they will they
[56:24] will wail because the day of the Lord
[56:26] has come see and so so we realize that
[56:30] it's in the day of the Lord coming with
[56:33] judgment that's the time when the bride
[56:36] hath made herself
[56:38] ready oh my friends and so we find an
[56:42] ever increasing need and an ever
[56:45] increasing challenge as we see that
[56:48] great day approaching where you you may
[56:50] not have the time to go get prayed up or
[56:55] or brother said you know you wouldn't
[56:56] need a prayer line you're you're facing
[56:58] a time where you might can't get to a
[56:59] prayer line it's not a as we said it's
[57:02] not a Prohibition on a Prayer Line it's
[57:04] it's simply saying that you need to be
[57:07] operationally at a level to where you
[57:09] wouldn't need that if you couldn't get
[57:11] to it to where you wouldn't need to go
[57:13] get prayed up because your life is
[57:15] constantly in a Channel of fellowship
[57:18] with the holy
[57:20] spirit
[57:21] amen we found that perfect Faith isn't a
[57:25] power coming it's here now and the
[57:27] secret is to stay prayed up amen now let
[57:31] me let me let me add a little bit of
[57:34] definition to that to say prayed up
[57:37] that's almost just like a vague
[57:39] statement but it is to it is further to
[57:43] organize your life amen today amen
[57:48] organize your life today in a way that
[57:52] allows you to live tomorrow in that rich
[57:56] communion with Christ amen and you know
[57:59] what your job will be tomorrow is to
[58:02] prepare yourself for Tuesday to live and
[58:05] you know what your job will be on
[58:06] Tuesday to prepare yourself for
[58:08] Wednesday so you prepare your life daily
[58:12] you constantly Die daily you read your
[58:14] Bible daily you pray daily you
[58:17] fellowship and this these are all part
[58:20] and parcel of one great plan uh that
[58:23] comes from God with it with and it in
[58:26] its point is to instruct you how to
[58:29] overcome am see and so this is why we we
[58:34] showed you that brother bram's platform
[58:37] for perfect the operation of perfect
[58:40] faith is he preaches how can I overcome
[58:43] so it's all about organizing your life
[58:46] which is exactly
[58:49] then so then ex that's
[58:52] exactly that process is exactly what
[58:56] Satan will do and try to interrupt amen
[59:01] I mean what do you think he would do if
[59:04] your strength is in Daily preparing your
[59:08] life by by being in prayer and in your
[59:10] Bible and in fellowship and talking to
[59:11] the Lord and having a
[59:14] relationship amen you understand so I
[59:17] mean do does a does a does a a human
[59:21] marriage survive very long if there's no
[59:25] effective work on the relationship and
[59:27] there just two ships passing in the
[59:29] night you tell me that that marriage is
[59:33] headed it got married on this street
[59:35] corner in Vegas and it's headed for a
[59:36] divorce on that street corner in Vegas
[59:39] because there's no there's no they're
[59:41] just two ships they're too busy there's
[59:43] no building there's no nurturing there's
[59:45] no caring there there there's no there's
[59:47] none of that interaction and it's the
[59:49] same in the spiritual between Christ and
[59:51] his bride if you want to have perfect
[59:53] Faith operating in your life and believe
[59:55] me you do
[59:56] if you love your family you love your
[59:58] children believe me you do then you do
[1:00:01] those things which which which grow the
[1:00:04] relationship between you and the and the
[1:00:07] and the person of perfect Faith amen
[1:00:10] amen CU perfect Faith's not a gift it's
[1:00:12] a
[1:00:13] person now I've just jumped ahead of
[1:00:15] myself but that's where we're going next
[1:00:18] level all
[1:00:20] right so this is exactly then what what
[1:00:24] Satan moves to disrupt and
[1:00:26] too bad that we we go along with it come
[1:00:30] on Amen we go along with it we we allow
[1:00:34] distractions we get too busy we the the
[1:00:38] our church attendance slips our Bible
[1:00:40] reading slips our prayer life slips our
[1:00:42] fellowship slips it's almost like we
[1:00:44] prioritize everything about life and
[1:00:47] just push those down the priority chain
[1:00:49] and I just say that we break that cycle
[1:00:52] I say that we raise up young people who
[1:00:54] say I'm going to break that cycle we're
[1:00:57] looking to go in a Rapture we're looking
[1:00:59] to see the dead saints come back and
[1:01:01] it's
[1:01:04] imminent so we come away from the world
[1:01:07] and we turn our Eyes Upon Jesus more and
[1:01:10] more the darker it
[1:01:13] gets so at the end of the day Satan's
[1:01:16] ambition Satan's plan is not hard to
[1:01:18] figure out friends uh it's to get you to
[1:01:21] allow the cares of this world to break
[1:01:24] your fellowship ship your daily
[1:01:27] fellowship with the spirit of God it is
[1:01:31] the ambition of the Holy Ghost to lead
[1:01:34] you into greater depths of Fellowship
[1:01:37] that is his ambition and and and I and I
[1:01:41] and I just say it like this that the
[1:01:43] operation of perfect Faith um is just
[1:01:47] that
[1:01:49] simple because it's a person it's not a
[1:01:53] gift or an emotion it's a person
[1:01:56] and we've learned that perfect faith is
[1:01:58] tied directly to your level of
[1:02:01] relationship with God and your
[1:02:02] dedication to him in your
[1:02:04] life see because remember that perfect
[1:02:07] Faith as we've already defined is the
[1:02:10] mind of Christ remember it's not just
[1:02:12] merely faith in the Son of God but it's
[1:02:15] actually the faith of the Son of God the
[1:02:16] faith he had let this mind which was in
[1:02:19] him be in you let it operate in you like
[1:02:22] it operated in him how did it operate in
[1:02:24] him first of all he had no condemnation
[1:02:26] in his heart he did all that which
[1:02:27] always pleased the father amen amen
[1:02:31] secondly he knew who he was he he was
[1:02:33] able to identify himself in the word
[1:02:35] both of those you have access to you
[1:02:38] have and I know that that that if I if
[1:02:42] if you could live the preceptive sight
[1:02:44] of the word perfectly then he wouldn't
[1:02:46] have needed to do it on your behalf I
[1:02:48] get it we're humans we're you know he
[1:02:50] was in a a word created body we're in
[1:02:53] we're in under a sex birth and so our
[1:02:56] our even with the new birth our our sin
[1:02:58] nature remains but that's why brother
[1:03:01] Brandon preached before perfect Faith
[1:03:04] lest it put too much on you he would say
[1:03:07] here's what you got to start with how
[1:03:09] can I
[1:03:12] overcome so that makes sense to you I
[1:03:14] can see it making sense to you
[1:03:16] see so so we find then that brother
[1:03:20] brandham says this all
[1:03:23] right watch
[1:03:26] he says in the message it is the rising
[1:03:28] of the
[1:03:29] Sun as people today are trying to
[1:03:33] say we should so see th th this is this
[1:03:38] is and and all these underlining places
[1:03:41] are places that the Holy Spirit had me
[1:03:42] to underline to comment on because I
[1:03:45] want you to know that people are trying
[1:03:48] today people today are trying to say we
[1:03:50] should wash feet once a year on Thursday
[1:03:52] on Friday we should take communion and
[1:03:53] all different doctrines of they argue
[1:03:56] about see so they argue about
[1:04:00] nonsense and and but that's the spirit
[1:04:02] of the age everybody's got a everybody
[1:04:05] wants to argue everybody's got their
[1:04:07] point and if you don't agree with their
[1:04:09] point then you're out of something
[1:04:11] whatever you might like to be out of
[1:04:13] their something whatever see so they
[1:04:16] argue whether it should be this day or
[1:04:19] that day see this is this to me is where
[1:04:22] we have been talking about how that the
[1:04:25] argument against prayer lines is a silly
[1:04:27] argument and brother bam is trying to
[1:04:29] deal with that here watch now watch
[1:04:31] watch how this
[1:04:32] goes as people today are trying to say
[1:04:35] we should wash feet once a year on
[1:04:37] Thursday and on Friday we should take
[1:04:39] communion and all different doctrines of
[1:04:42] they argue about whether it should be
[1:04:43] this day or that day or whether it
[1:04:45] should be a Sabbath day or the first day
[1:04:47] of the week all these things are just
[1:04:50] merely
[1:04:52] Tradition now
[1:04:54] watch what good would any of it do you
[1:04:59] whether you had lent or not lent if
[1:05:02] there is no life in you
[1:05:05] amen see amen so what do you think Jesus
[1:05:09] was talking about in Luke's gospel when
[1:05:12] he said in vain or Mark's gospel in vain
[1:05:14] do they worship me teaching for Doctrine
[1:05:16] the Commandments of men didn't deny they
[1:05:18] weren't that they were trying to worship
[1:05:20] him but it was pointless see he says
[1:05:24] what good would any of it do you whether
[1:05:26] you had lint lint is a Catholic thing
[1:05:28] that they do uh preceding uh Easter and
[1:05:32] uh and but what good would that do you
[1:05:34] if there's no life in you it's only a
[1:05:36] memorial which there's nothing against
[1:05:38] it but they have certainly carried out
[1:05:40] their Traditions but left off the main
[1:05:43] thing see now watch this and and and and
[1:05:48] I had a very good friend a trainer that
[1:05:50] I was working with a Serbian guy and so
[1:05:53] we were fast friends I told him about
[1:05:55] all my travels over there he respected
[1:05:56] me as a minister and um he was um he was
[1:06:01] he was
[1:06:02] Orthodox and very devout Orthodox
[1:06:06] Catholic Eastern Catholic not not Roman
[1:06:08] he was Orthodox and um he he observed
[1:06:12] lint and he did all these different
[1:06:13] steps but yet I could see and I and I
[1:06:16] was able to get just enough uh enough of
[1:06:19] the true word of God dropped into his
[1:06:21] heart I hope someday he was a very
[1:06:23] wonderful friend of mine ended up
[1:06:25] finally moving away to another state and
[1:06:27] uh but it it made me sad because I could
[1:06:31] talk to him about the real life of God
[1:06:36] and you could see that he could he could
[1:06:38] see it but he was he was he was
[1:06:42] befuddled on how do I get there yeah and
[1:06:45] he he he kept always doubling back to I
[1:06:49] I do lent I do communion I take the
[1:06:51] Eucharist I I'm in a church I'm a I I
[1:06:53] Believe In Christ and all these things I
[1:06:55] pray to the Virgin and and all of these
[1:06:57] different things and and and you know it
[1:06:59] it's it's it's hard it's hard on our
[1:07:02] hearts when we have people that we love
[1:07:04] and they have certainly carried out the
[1:07:08] Traditions amen they go to church they
[1:07:11] sing songs they read bibles they've
[1:07:13] carried out the Traditions Jesus ran
[1:07:15] into those religious people in Israel
[1:07:18] and he said you you but by your
[1:07:20] Traditions you've made the real word of
[1:07:22] no effect and so brother Ram says
[1:07:24] they've carried out their Traditions but
[1:07:26] they've left off the main thing watch
[1:07:29] this Satan doesn't care how religious
[1:07:35] you are how right you are even in your
[1:07:41] Doctrine see if you miss that life you
[1:07:45] won't come up anyhow no matter how
[1:07:48] religious how good how many churches
[1:07:51] you've belonged to or will belong to it
[1:07:54] doesn't matter what one thing unless you
[1:07:57] have been born
[1:07:59] again amen so there's nothing that you
[1:08:02] should value above the baptism of the
[1:08:05] Holy
[1:08:06] Spirit and however we got to facilitate
[1:08:09] that whether we meet here two times a
[1:08:10] week five times a week whether we have
[1:08:12] special meetings youth weekends youth
[1:08:14] camps prayer lines singing whatever we
[1:08:17] have to do I want to see you filled with
[1:08:20] the Holy Ghost not here to argue a
[1:08:23] Doctrine why I want to see you filled
[1:08:25] with the Holy Ghost see so I'll use any
[1:08:29] and all means see so so do you see
[1:08:31] friends why I say that arguments against
[1:08:34] prayer lines is
[1:08:35] silly so what it is is that Satan is
[1:08:40] just using that to distract people
[1:08:44] yeah see it's not about it's not about
[1:08:46] whether you went in a prayer line it's
[1:08:48] not about whether you shouted or or you
[1:08:50] didn't shout or you went in a prayer
[1:08:52] line or you didn't go in a prayer line
[1:08:54] it's about do you know him and the power
[1:08:57] of his resurrection do you know him we
[1:09:01] often quote it and and brother brandham
[1:09:03] quoted it both ways and we often say to
[1:09:05] know him in the power of his
[1:09:06] resurrection that's actually not the
[1:09:08] scripture it's do it's to know him and
[1:09:11] the power of his resurrection because
[1:09:14] when you know him you're born again but
[1:09:16] are you living an overcomer life do you
[1:09:19] know him and the power is the power of
[1:09:23] his resurrection moving through your
[1:09:25] life I'm not talking about have you had
[1:09:28] the Holy Ghost are you born again you
[1:09:30] you've got to start there but then God
[1:09:32] is going to build you up you're a li
[1:09:35] you're buildt of lively Stones you're
[1:09:37] the Temple of the living God's
[1:09:39] presence see
[1:09:43] amen so is you know when you know him in
[1:09:47] the power by the power of his
[1:09:50] resurrection then uh brother Matt was
[1:09:52] dealing with that today the the token is
[1:09:54] certainly on display
[1:09:56] you certainly are living above the
[1:09:57] lukewarmness of the age for
[1:10:00] sure if you're you know if you're
[1:10:04] hanging out with the and you're you're
[1:10:06] mingling with the with the spirit of of
[1:10:10] leoda then I'm not here I can't judge
[1:10:13] whether you've been born again or not
[1:10:14] but I know this you're not overcoming
[1:10:17] you're getting
[1:10:18] overcome see and you just need to own
[1:10:21] that and ask God to help
[1:10:23] you so so we find then that when we read
[1:10:30] our text all right I'm going to back up
[1:10:33] to it or did I yeah okay I'm G to go to
[1:10:36] it right right back here
[1:10:39] again now Faith is the substance of
[1:10:43] things hoped for all right so in the jfb
[1:10:49] uh commentary which is one of my
[1:10:50] favorite commentaries uh Jameson faet
[1:10:52] and brown this word substance
[1:10:56] it actually
[1:10:58] substantiate it it substantiates
[1:11:01] Promises of God which we hope for as
[1:11:05] future in fulfillment we come and we
[1:11:07] pray we ask the Lord for a certain
[1:11:09] petition and then we're told to believe
[1:11:12] that it will come to pass right and so
[1:11:16] it so but but what this substance that
[1:11:20] Greek word substance is trying to get
[1:11:23] you to understand that
[1:11:26] the way you're supposed to believe for
[1:11:29] it is not just believe it in the future
[1:11:32] but you're supposed to make it a present
[1:11:34] reality now that is exactly what brother
[1:11:37] brandham taught so I know that that's
[1:11:40] accurate because the when you've got
[1:11:43] substance Faith that's perfect faith
[1:11:45] when you've got substance faith and as
[1:11:46] we've said it's the mind of Christ
[1:11:50] flowing through you unhindered amen see
[1:11:56] and so it's not you deciding anything
[1:11:58] it's you as a vessel being led by the
[1:12:00] Holy Spirit Prophet talks about those
[1:12:03] those Apostles say you know why why did
[1:12:05] they you know why how is it that Peter's
[1:12:07] Shadow healed people how is it that
[1:12:09] prison doors opened how is it that this
[1:12:11] and that happened because they brother
[1:12:14] Bram said they were so in tune with the
[1:12:16] Holy Spirit many times God didn't even
[1:12:18] have to speak to them just nod his head
[1:12:20] and off they'd go amen that's how that's
[1:12:23] how in tune I I can relate to that as a
[1:12:26] father a lot of times in a crowded room
[1:12:28] and my boys and I need to get an
[1:12:30] instruction I didn't always need to
[1:12:31] speak I could have a certain look or a
[1:12:33] certain nod or a certain you know a
[1:12:35] certain motion and they already knew
[1:12:37] because they knew me they live with me
[1:12:39] you understand and this is this is how
[1:12:42] you live an overcomer life when you have
[1:12:44] that kind of
[1:12:46] Lifestyle so the whole point of of
[1:12:50] substance faith is that it literally in
[1:12:54] your mind mind makes what you hope for
[1:12:58] as a future fulfillment it actually
[1:13:01] makes it a present reality they go on to
[1:13:04] say the whole thing that follows is
[1:13:08] virtually contained in the first
[1:13:10] principle now the first commencement of
[1:13:13] the things hoped for in us through the
[1:13:17] ascent of Faith which virtually contains
[1:13:21] all the things hoped for so in other
[1:13:24] words there's nothing that you could
[1:13:27] desire from God's promise that you can't
[1:13:31] have because in that word substance is
[1:13:36] everything see amen now let me let me
[1:13:39] show you why that's true and I'm going
[1:13:40] to get ahead of myself but I just feel I
[1:13:42] need to make this
[1:13:45] point look at what it says faith is the
[1:13:49] substance of things hoped for the
[1:13:50] evidence of thing not seen verse three
[1:13:52] for through faith we understand that the
[1:13:54] worlds were Fram by the word of God so
[1:13:56] that things which are seen were not made
[1:13:58] of things which do
[1:13:59] appear wait a minute I I thought God
[1:14:03] created the heavens and the
[1:14:06] Earth well this is almost a con a
[1:14:09] conflict wait a minute you're you're
[1:14:11] saying that through faith we understand
[1:14:13] that the worlds were framed I thought
[1:14:15] God did it so the only conclusion you
[1:14:18] can have is substance is a
[1:14:22] person because the Bible's not
[1:14:25] disagreeing with itself it is substance
[1:14:28] Faith or as I'm saying to you perfect
[1:14:31] faith is a person it's a reality of the
[1:14:34] person of Christ operating through you
[1:14:37] Jesus said to his disciples greater than
[1:14:40] this shall you do cuz I go to the father
[1:14:43] what's the significance of that by going
[1:14:45] to the Father the atonement could be
[1:14:47] made and that that body laid on the
[1:14:49] altar as a Perpetual sacrifice and that
[1:14:51] life sent back into the church so that
[1:14:53] you are now the Contin continuation of
[1:14:55] the ministry of
[1:14:57] Jesus it's now the word made flesh
[1:15:00] living in the Earth again see so this is
[1:15:04] what I'm I'm I'm starting to Peck at
[1:15:06] that now watch because we're seeing it
[1:15:08] that it's by the Elder by this
[1:15:11] substance this Faith which is a
[1:15:14] substance that the elders obtained a
[1:15:16] good report by it by this substance
[1:15:20] through this Faith which is a substance
[1:15:22] we understand the worlds were framed by
[1:15:24] the word of God see so so that things
[1:15:29] which are seen were not made of things
[1:15:32] which do appear there's no one can do
[1:15:35] that but
[1:15:36] God he's the only one with the powers of
[1:15:40] creation that's why your new birth makes
[1:15:43] you a new
[1:15:47] creation old things are passed away and
[1:15:51] behold Al things are new
[1:15:57] amen you with
[1:16:00] me see so this is why you know so then
[1:16:04] they go on to say so through
[1:16:07] faith the future object in its
[1:16:12] beginning the future object in its
[1:16:15] beginning is already fulfilled amen amen
[1:16:18] now we're thinking on a different level
[1:16:20] now you're going to have to go beyond
[1:16:22] the Realms of of of Na of nature
[1:16:25] right and we're going to we're going to
[1:16:27] help you in a minute so this is why
[1:16:29] brother Brandon would say to his
[1:16:33] audience that if Jesus
[1:16:36] Christ was here on this platform wearing
[1:16:40] this suit he could not heal
[1:16:45] you that's a
[1:16:47] Mindbender okay you just mean like a
[1:16:50] figment of Jesus no Jesus himself in
[1:16:53] person the one brother r saw in a wheat
[1:16:55] field and the wind was blowing His
[1:16:57] Garment he said if he was standing on
[1:16:59] this platform wearing this suit that I'm
[1:17:01] wearing said he could not heal you he
[1:17:04] would simply say to you child I already
[1:17:06] healed you 2,000 years ago see friends
[1:17:09] we're going to a whole different plane
[1:17:10] of reality here you got to stop thinking
[1:17:13] of your life as linear it's like like
[1:17:15] I'm praying for it now and I hope to get
[1:17:17] it in the future the hope you have is
[1:17:19] that you have it now and all you're
[1:17:21] doing is watch as your faith is
[1:17:23] persevering no matter what the
[1:17:24] circumstances are to bring the reality
[1:17:28] of what already is in
[1:17:33] Christ so in the Old Testament days it
[1:17:36] only had the strength of the blood of
[1:17:38] bulls and goats and that's why I took
[1:17:40] you to Hebrews 9 because Paul said look
[1:17:44] he said if the blood of bulls and goats
[1:17:46] and the ashes of a he sprinkling the
[1:17:48] unclean sanctify through the puring of
[1:17:50] the flesh how much more shall the blood
[1:17:52] of Christ who through the eternal
[1:17:54] eternal spirit now catch it the eternal
[1:17:58] spirit now remember that verse 12 had
[1:18:02] said to us neither by the blood of goats
[1:18:05] and calves but by his own blood he
[1:18:07] entered in once into the holy Place
[1:18:10] having obtained Eternal Redemption so
[1:18:15] you didn't become a son or daughter of
[1:18:17] God when you nailed at an altar you
[1:18:19] found out you always had been and all
[1:18:23] you now come you've come to your Eternal
[1:18:25] Redemption that you always were a part
[1:18:28] of this is the plane of perfect faith it
[1:18:31] has to start with knowing who you
[1:18:35] are and to stop let the devil telling
[1:18:38] you uh you're something different you're
[1:18:40] a failure you're too weak you are too
[1:18:42] weak you don't have enough but in Christ
[1:18:44] I can do all
[1:18:46] things but I make mistakes of course I
[1:18:48] do but the blood of Jesus atones for my
[1:18:51] mistakes if I sin I have an advocate
[1:18:53] with the father but I never break my
[1:18:56] eternal connection
[1:19:00] Hallelujah so it's an eternal
[1:19:03] Redemption it's an eternal that they
[1:19:06] which are called might receive the
[1:19:10] promise of
[1:19:11] Eternal
[1:19:13] inheritance if it's if it's an
[1:19:18] inheritance that you can get on a
[1:19:20] certain day and lose it on another day
[1:19:22] then it's not eternal
[1:19:25] you understand so this is why Jesus
[1:19:27] would say once you've passed from Death
[1:19:28] to life you never come into the Judgment
[1:19:30] because why because you've passed from
[1:19:32] Death to life
[1:19:35] amen all right
[1:19:38] now that's that's almost Elementary to
[1:19:42] where we're
[1:19:44] headed I'm going to have to help you
[1:19:46] because we're going to say some things
[1:19:49] that are going to challenge your
[1:19:51] mind and so I'm going to have to base it
[1:19:55] on what a prophet made clear that this
[1:19:57] and of itself you've read it before
[1:19:59] probably and it is
[1:20:02] mindbending
[1:20:04] watch excuse we got to get down to it
[1:20:07] here here we
[1:20:08] go um right here semeran Church
[1:20:12] age now pay close
[1:20:15] attention watch carefully now and see
[1:20:19] this
[1:20:21] before there was ever a speck of
[1:20:25] Stardust before God was God because God
[1:20:29] is an object of of adoration and no one
[1:20:32] was there to worship him and so he was
[1:20:35] at that time only potentially God only
[1:20:38] potentially an object of worship nothing
[1:20:39] was worshiping him yet but he he says so
[1:20:42] and and so he was uh so he was at that
[1:20:46] time only potentially God and he was
[1:20:49] known only as eternal spirit so he was
[1:20:53] the eternal spirit see he wasn't like a
[1:20:56] something of an of a less than God he
[1:20:59] wasn't worshiped so he's only he's only
[1:21:03] potential to eventually get to worship
[1:21:05] and adoration but he's already
[1:21:08] absolutely God start to finish and he
[1:21:12] can't he can't even get any better or
[1:21:14] any less he can't increase or diminish
[1:21:16] he's everything he would ever be yes
[1:21:19] only his plan was that he eventually
[1:21:21] would become an object of
[1:21:23] worship see
[1:21:25] so he's known only as the eternal spirit
[1:21:27] the bride was
[1:21:31] already in his
[1:21:33] mind yes she was she was and catch it
[1:21:38] I've got it I've got those two words
[1:21:39] underlined already in his mind yes she
[1:21:43] was she was existing in his thoughts
[1:21:47] amen say
[1:21:48] well thoughts okay that's not a whole
[1:21:51] lot it's it's going to get better it's
[1:21:53] going to get good
[1:21:56] okay so you were in his
[1:21:59] thoughts and what about those thoughts
[1:22:01] of God they are Eternal are they not you
[1:22:04] agree with
[1:22:05] that the Eternal thoughts of God let me
[1:22:08] ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal
[1:22:10] if you can see this you will see many
[1:22:13] things see if you can see this today
[1:22:15] then you'll be able to see where we're
[1:22:17] going after this quote is over amen all
[1:22:19] right God is unchangeable in both
[1:22:23] Essence and behavior avor he's the same
[1:22:25] yesterday today and forever God is
[1:22:27] infinite in his abilities so therefore
[1:22:29] he as God must be omniscient so I'm here
[1:22:33] to tell you he already knows everything
[1:22:36] about you that's what Boaz said to Ruth
[1:22:39] it's been fully shown me all that you
[1:22:42] ever did I just say he already knows
[1:22:44] everything I ever did he already knows
[1:22:47] that my what my heart will love him he
[1:22:48] already knows I'm a Believer he knew
[1:22:50] that before said before you were born
[1:22:52] before the earth existed before there
[1:22:54] was Stardust he knew there would be a me
[1:22:57] and he knew there would be a you and he
[1:22:58] knew we would sit in this building and
[1:23:00] say Amen to his
[1:23:02] word when no concept of creation even
[1:23:05] existed he already knew that that's how
[1:23:07] real you were
[1:23:10] amen if you can see this you'll see many
[1:23:12] things God is unchangeable all right God
[1:23:14] must be
[1:23:16] omniscient if he is
[1:23:18] omnition then he is not now learning nor
[1:23:23] is he taking counsel even with himself
[1:23:26] man I'll tell you what you know I didn't
[1:23:29] I didn't really expect that brother or
[1:23:31] sister to do that man they broke my word
[1:23:34] I'm gonna have to think about
[1:23:36] this I thought they love me I got their
[1:23:39] name in my book I didn't see this
[1:23:44] coming I'm so glad that's not
[1:23:48] true I'm so glad he sees me inside and
[1:23:52] out outside and in he sees my past he
[1:23:55] sees my future he sees my heart he sees
[1:23:58] everything and he knows no matter what
[1:24:00] failure I have I'm never going to not
[1:24:03] believe his
[1:24:04] word because I'm a part of his
[1:24:08] word if he can add to his knowledge then
[1:24:12] he's not
[1:24:13] omniscient the best the best we could
[1:24:16] say is that sometimes he will be
[1:24:18] sometime he will be but that is not
[1:24:20] scriptural he is omniscient so he
[1:24:23] doesn't need to
[1:24:24] watch you he's not here today saying now
[1:24:28] I know this world I tell you what that
[1:24:30] teenager I saw what they did last week I
[1:24:32] better uh I better say something here I
[1:24:35] better I better reach out and do
[1:24:37] something he's not learning you didn't
[1:24:40] show him anything he didn't already know
[1:24:43] so I but if you only knew my secret
[1:24:45] fears I'm glad I don't but I'm glad he
[1:24:48] does and you should be glad he does He's
[1:24:52] Got The Whole World in His Hands friends
[1:24:54] you understand that Jesus Christ is the
[1:24:56] same yesterday today and forever you
[1:24:58] want him to be that Hallelujah people
[1:25:01] that resist that astonish me if that's
[1:25:04] not true I don't stand much of a chance
[1:25:07] see
[1:25:09] watch he has never had a new thought
[1:25:13] about anything because all his thoughts
[1:25:17] he has always had and always will have
[1:25:20] and knows the end from the beginning
[1:25:23] because he is God
[1:25:25] thus the thoughts of God are Eternal
[1:25:29] they are
[1:25:32] real am they are not simply like a man
[1:25:36] with a blueprint he has drawn up and
[1:25:38] which one day will be translated into
[1:25:41] substance and form you get that brother
[1:25:43] Steve the blueprints aren't the building
[1:25:46] see but it doesn't actually exist it's
[1:25:49] only on blueprint see but they are God's
[1:25:52] thoughts are all already real and
[1:25:55] eternal catch it and part of
[1:26:01] God so if you're the thought of God what
[1:26:05] are you you're part of God so then what
[1:26:09] is substance it's a person what is
[1:26:12] perfect Faith it's a person what are you
[1:26:14] the people of his choosing that the
[1:26:17] person wants to live
[1:26:19] through so this is why Peter should have
[1:26:22] never looked at circumstances this is
[1:26:24] why he should have kept his eyes on
[1:26:28] Christ see
[1:26:31] watch part of God all
[1:26:35] right that's actually in the quote I
[1:26:38] just put it on the screen to capture
[1:26:40] your
[1:26:41] attention so how see how this works
[1:26:45] everything we've just said now let's see
[1:26:47] how it works you
[1:26:50] ready God always had his thought
[1:26:54] thoughts for
[1:26:57] Adam if Adam fell that was in God's
[1:26:59] thoughts amen whatever the serpent did
[1:27:02] whatever Eve did that was in God's
[1:27:04] thoughts footsteps of the righteous are
[1:27:06] ordered of the
[1:27:08] Lord Brother Brandon would say people
[1:27:10] say Jonah disobeyed the will of God he
[1:27:13] said I always take up for old brother
[1:27:14] Jonah he said because he was a prophet
[1:27:16] of God he said he he was never out of
[1:27:19] the will of God and when I read that I
[1:27:22] scratch my head and I go wait a minute
[1:27:25] hold on the Lord said go here and Jonah
[1:27:29] didn't he went
[1:27:31] there how is not here going there he
[1:27:36] gets credit for going here and that
[1:27:38] that's not what brother Brandon was
[1:27:40] suggesting brother Brandon wasn't saying
[1:27:42] you're crazy for thinking he was simply
[1:27:45] saying that it's all in the thoughts of
[1:27:48] God and nothing's out of catering God
[1:27:50] already knew it and already had a
[1:27:52] specially prepared fish to accommodate
[1:27:55] Jonah's unbelief I'm glad he had
[1:27:58] something to accommodate my unbelief I'm
[1:28:01] glad when I go in the opposite of his
[1:28:03] Direction he's already got a remedy for
[1:28:06] me
[1:28:09] Hallelujah God always had his thoughts
[1:28:12] for Adam Adam as his thoughts was yet
[1:28:17] unexpressed you see what you just read
[1:28:20] God always had his thoughts for Adam
[1:28:23] Adam as his thoughts was yet unexpressed
[1:28:26] Psalms 139:1 15- 16 will give you a
[1:28:29] little idea of this here it is my
[1:28:32] substance was not hid from thee when I
[1:28:35] was made in secret and curiously wrought
[1:28:40] see uh in the lowest parts of the earth
[1:28:44] Thine Eyes did see my substance yet
[1:28:48] being
[1:28:49] unperfect see I wasn't I wasn't even in
[1:28:53] the earth yet you already saw
[1:28:55] me I'm in the earth now so are you look
[1:28:59] around and say you're in the
[1:29:00] earth God already saw everything you've
[1:29:03] ever been would be and what you
[1:29:06] are and and you say well I I hope to get
[1:29:11] perfect so do I but God already saw this
[1:29:17] person
[1:29:18] unperfect not yet fulfilled I I know I
[1:29:22] already don't look perfect believe me I
[1:29:25] beat my own self up with that all the
[1:29:27] time that I I want to be perfect I know
[1:29:30] I already know I'm not perfect but I
[1:29:32] know that he knows I will
[1:29:34] be because why it's already happened
[1:29:38] it's already a reality stop thinking
[1:29:41] about Einstein it's already a reality
[1:29:45] Christ was slain he was the lamb slain
[1:29:48] not 2,000 years ago that was only an
[1:29:50] Earthly manifestation of what had
[1:29:52] happened before the world was form
[1:29:55] brother brandham said you're already on
[1:29:57] the other side this thing's already in
[1:29:59] God's mind it's already wrapped up we're
[1:30:02] already shouting on the other side no
[1:30:04] wonder I feel like shouting here
[1:30:07] today I've heard from my
[1:30:10] theany and it's influencing my life to
[1:30:13] love God's word why because over there
[1:30:16] it loves God's
[1:30:17] word
[1:30:21] hallelujah Thine Eyes did see my sub
[1:30:24] yet being
[1:30:27] unperfect and in thy book all my members
[1:30:30] were written this guy hasn't even been
[1:30:33] born
[1:30:35] yet all my members were written which in
[1:30:38] continuance were fashioned when as yet
[1:30:41] there was none of
[1:30:44] them do you think for a second and if
[1:30:49] you do you'd be wrong so let me say it
[1:30:52] like this don't think for a second that
[1:30:55] however he was going to be perfect he
[1:30:59] was going to become what God
[1:31:02] ordained and nothing when he got to the
[1:31:05] Earth and began to live there was
[1:31:08] nothing he could do to interrupt that
[1:31:11] amen nothing there's nothing you can do
[1:31:14] God trains us God chastises us God
[1:31:17] corrects us I'm here to tell you
[1:31:19] something friends but nothing can
[1:31:21] separate me from the love of God that
[1:31:24] was in Christ Jesus doesn't matter
[1:31:26] height nor depth fear famine sword Peril
[1:31:30] nothing can separate me and and if
[1:31:32] nothing can separate me then me can't
[1:31:34] separate me and you can't separate you
[1:31:37] this is the next level friends this is
[1:31:39] where perfect faith is operating that
[1:31:42] you're not hoping like oh I hope
[1:31:44] something will come to pass if you
[1:31:46] believe God's promise see it as already
[1:31:49] done put put the future in your past and
[1:31:53] just say I already he have
[1:31:55] it see that's what Abraham did and his
[1:31:58] body obeyed his
[1:32:02] confession so so so so he says here he
[1:32:07] goes
[1:32:09] on that as I said was not written about
[1:32:12] Adam but it gives you the idea and
[1:32:15] knowledge that the thought was there in
[1:32:18] his mind and that thought was eternal so
[1:32:23] I thought about that for a second I
[1:32:24] underlined it because it blew my it
[1:32:26] cooked my noodle blew my mind I thought
[1:32:28] wait a minute
[1:32:30] so the whole thought of the whole
[1:32:33] thought was already there which this
[1:32:37] didn't get said Till Psalms
[1:32:39] 139 but it applies to Adam before he was
[1:32:42] ever born so who's on first uh but he
[1:32:47] but he said but I thought did it become
[1:32:49] true no it had always been true it
[1:32:51] didn't matter that it was thousands of
[1:32:53] years before it God said it was always
[1:32:55] true you see friends it when you're on
[1:32:58] the other side it doesn't matter how
[1:32:59] many years it doesn't matter what
[1:33:01] happens when you get there you were
[1:33:03] always going to be there Hallelujah
[1:33:05] you're a believer of the word CU you
[1:33:07] always were going to be a believer of
[1:33:08] the
[1:33:09] word so the whole thing comes down to
[1:33:12] getting rid of your human reasoning and
[1:33:15] that's why you need fellowship with the
[1:33:17] spirit of God that's why you have to
[1:33:19] have that relationship to keep you out
[1:33:22] of the way
[1:33:24] because you're the
[1:33:27] interference right see Peter was the
[1:33:30] interference to God's word performing
[1:33:32] not at first but it became became an
[1:33:35] interference
[1:33:37] see so he says
[1:33:39] here and that thought was eternal and
[1:33:42] had to be expressed so when Adam was
[1:33:44] formed of the Dust of the earth and his
[1:33:48] spiritual being created by God then Adam
[1:33:52] became God's thought
[1:33:54] expressed and those Eternal thoughts
[1:33:57] were now
[1:33:58] manifested that doesn't change just
[1:34:02] because Adam sinned
[1:34:05] amen you know why it can't you know why
[1:34:09] because it's Eternal yeah and eternal
[1:34:11] can't be altered God can't get a new
[1:34:14] thought about you every thought he's
[1:34:17] ever had he's always had and will always
[1:34:20] have and God can't change his mind about
[1:34:23] you
[1:34:24] see all right so we're we're way in the
[1:34:28] next level watch and those Eternal
[1:34:32] thoughts were now
[1:34:34] manifested so I am the manifested
[1:34:37] thoughts of God watch brother random
[1:34:38] goes on down through the centuries we
[1:34:40] could go we find a Moses a Jeremiah John
[1:34:44] the Baptist and each one of those were
[1:34:46] God's Eternal thoughts expressed in its
[1:34:48] season see uh so
[1:34:52] listen when Moses lost his cool and
[1:34:56] smoked the rock a second time did he
[1:34:59] suddenly step outside of God's Eternal
[1:35:02] thought of
[1:35:03] him of course not you know why not
[1:35:08] because God's a a a nice fuzzy feel-good
[1:35:12] gentleman but because Moses was a part
[1:35:15] of his thought and God couldn't change
[1:35:18] his
[1:35:19] thought and and you think you when God
[1:35:22] made the promise today David and David
[1:35:25] committed heinous sins I mean really bad
[1:35:29] we're talking about adultery with
[1:35:31] another man's wife a very noble man and
[1:35:33] then had the man murdered and then
[1:35:36] covered it up yeah amen but God had
[1:35:39] promised that he would set a man on his
[1:35:42] throne and establish it forever through
[1:35:45] his seed did Jesus
[1:35:48] come did so so it wasn't broken no
[1:35:51] matter what David did that promise was
[1:35:53] not broken Jesus came and did exactly
[1:35:57] through the line of David what God said
[1:35:59] he would do and nothing David could do
[1:36:02] could stop that oh Hallelujah I read in
[1:36:05] the Book of Revelation that there was a
[1:36:07] great group of people saying hallelujah
[1:36:10] and that's you and that's me and there's
[1:36:12] nothing there's not enough devils in
[1:36:13] hell you me all of us together we can't
[1:36:16] stop
[1:36:19] that this is perfect Faith perfect faith
[1:36:23] is a person it's you in a the operation
[1:36:26] of perfect faith is you in a
[1:36:28] relationship am you with close close
[1:36:32] relationship so that your mind is clean
[1:36:35] and clear of carnality and the world and
[1:36:38] worldly thinking and your conduit and
[1:36:40] the Holy Spirit can then flow out
[1:36:42] through
[1:36:43] you perfect faith has never been you
[1:36:46] trying to have Mind Over Matter that's
[1:36:50] human
[1:36:51] Faith that's just human faith that's not
[1:36:54] as I've said to you before brother
[1:36:57] brandom says now you've had a faith I'm
[1:36:59] trying to get you to see a perfect Faith
[1:37:00] you're going to need this in the hour we
[1:37:03] live in today you need
[1:37:05] it see so so it's not you trying to have
[1:37:09] mind over matter it's not I mean even
[1:37:12] the whole part about we cast down vain
[1:37:14] imaginations those are all the things we
[1:37:15] do we do that so we don't hinder the
[1:37:18] word we bring every thought we're humans
[1:37:21] born in a sinful body and we're still in
[1:37:24] a sinful body so we have to bring our
[1:37:26] sinful thoughts subject to the Holy
[1:37:28] Spirit you know why so that that doesn't
[1:37:31] hinder the
[1:37:33] flow because that's the operation of
[1:37:36] perfect Faith perfect faith is a person
[1:37:40] the operation is when that person can
[1:37:42] flow through you according to his own
[1:37:44] will and fulfill his Eternal Word and
[1:37:47] when it gets fulfilled and it's then
[1:37:49] it's an eternal manifestation that can't
[1:37:50] be reversed when you have passed from
[1:37:53] Death to life yeah that can't be
[1:37:54] reversed see so he goes on all
[1:37:59] right so he says
[1:38:02] um down through the century we could go
[1:38:05] we find a Moses a
[1:38:07] Jeremiah I already know I won't finish
[1:38:09] today it's all good we find a Moses and
[1:38:11] a
[1:38:12] Jeremiah a John the
[1:38:15] Baptist and each one of those were God's
[1:38:17] Eternal thought expressed in its season
[1:38:21] amen then we come to Jesus the Lord he
[1:38:24] was the perfect and complete thought
[1:38:26] expressed remember the book of
[1:38:28] Colossians calls him the express image
[1:38:31] amen see no man hath seen God at any
[1:38:33] time God is invisible he's a spirit no
[1:38:35] man ha seen God at any time but the only
[1:38:38] begotten of the father ha declared him
[1:38:40] so we we we had no way to know what God
[1:38:42] was really like until Jesus came and now
[1:38:45] God is living as a human if you ever
[1:38:48] wanted to know what would God be like if
[1:38:50] he ever became a man just go study the
[1:38:52] life of Jesus
[1:38:54] that's what God would be like and that's
[1:38:56] what he wants you to be like see so he
[1:39:00] says he became known as the
[1:39:02] word he became known as the word that is
[1:39:06] what he is and forever will be amen and
[1:39:11] see how far I want to
[1:39:18] go yeah now it says that
[1:39:23] he hath chosen Us in him all right now
[1:39:27] let me go back to this again he's
[1:39:29] already explained to you how he's done
[1:39:31] this all down through time he did it
[1:39:33] through Moses he did it through Jeremiah
[1:39:34] he did it through Adam he did it through
[1:39:35] David until then he comes to Jesus you
[1:39:38] see do you see the process he's been
[1:39:41] he's not new at this he's been doing
[1:39:43] this for thousands of years he's been
[1:39:46] securing his family regardless of their
[1:39:48] weaknesses he's been putting the devil
[1:39:51] in his place no matter what king or
[1:39:52] emperor tried to circumnavigate God's
[1:39:55] word it would it never worked it never
[1:39:58] will work Satan cannot deceive this en
[1:40:01] time bride cuz she's predestinated to
[1:40:03] not fall say well if we're restored back
[1:40:06] to the original Church why did they fall
[1:40:09] because they were supposed
[1:40:11] to because the seed had to go into the
[1:40:15] ground and die they already had it
[1:40:18] abstract they already had the token they
[1:40:19] were already on their way to the Rapture
[1:40:22] but the seed had to to go into the
[1:40:24] ground brother random said it had to to
[1:40:26] fulfill God's plan CU that was his plan
[1:40:29] that they without us could never be made
[1:40:34] perfect so they went into the ground
[1:40:36] because that was ordained of God but God
[1:40:39] still saved his family it did not stop
[1:40:41] his Eternal Word but at the end time we
[1:40:44] have a bride who are ordained and
[1:40:46] predestinated to not fall but to
[1:40:49] actually go all the way to a body chain
[1:40:53] say oh I I'm going to get a body change
[1:40:56] because that I'm going to get all this
[1:40:58] kind of power to break the laws of
[1:41:00] physics I'm going to speak to storms and
[1:41:02] create squirrels you might do all the
[1:41:03] above times 10 or times a thousand I
[1:41:05] don't know it don't
[1:41:07] matter here's what I do know that I have
[1:41:09] passed from Death To Life here's what I
[1:41:11] do know that I am saying Amen to every
[1:41:13] word here's what I do know that I am or
[1:41:15] ordering my life in the line and Order
[1:41:18] of God's word cuz I know that whatever's
[1:41:20] outside of his line and order will fail
[1:41:22] because it has to fail it's not Eternal
[1:41:24] the prophet
[1:41:25] said so we are here today why are you at
[1:41:28] church to be taught how to line your
[1:41:31] life up with the word of God and and let
[1:41:33] go of the carnality of the
[1:41:37] world so down through he go he goes down
[1:41:40] he shows all of this being true and so
[1:41:43] now with that principle in mind now it
[1:41:45] says that he hath he hath chosen who us
[1:41:51] us in him
[1:41:55] you know it doesn't say he hath chosen
[1:41:57] us because he picked the best
[1:42:00] people he hath chosen Us in
[1:42:04] him I've said to you before the 42nd
[1:42:07] chapter of I of Isaiah declared there is
[1:42:10] only one elected son and that's Christ
[1:42:14] how did I get elected because I was in
[1:42:17] Christ he was expressed now I'm
[1:42:20] expressed it was his turn now it's your
[1:42:21] turn the word is made flesh again in the
[1:42:24] earth and God's whole plan is for you to
[1:42:27] be able to operate not a faith but a
[1:42:30] perfect
[1:42:32] Faith because that's the one that'll
[1:42:34] bring the sleeping Saints for hundreds
[1:42:36] of years out of the Grave he hath chosen
[1:42:39] Us in him Jesus before the foundation of
[1:42:42] the world that means that we're right
[1:42:45] there with him in the mind and thoughts
[1:42:47] of God before the foundation of the
[1:42:50] world that is almost too good to be
[1:42:54] true amen
[1:42:57] amen but he's he's stating the obvious
[1:43:01] he's stating the obvious if he hath
[1:43:03] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[1:43:05] of the world did he do that does the
[1:43:07] bible say that that's true that's what
[1:43:09] the Bible says he hath chosen Us in him
[1:43:12] before the foundation of the world and
[1:43:14] we believe that well then if that's true
[1:43:16] then that means that we were right there
[1:43:19] with him in the mind and thoughts of God
[1:43:21] before the foundation of the world and
[1:43:23] that gives an eternal quality to the
[1:43:25] elect you can't get away from that
[1:43:29] tomorrow when the Devil comes with his
[1:43:31] brags just say I was in him before the
[1:43:35] foundation of the world and you can't
[1:43:37] get away from that but when the devil
[1:43:39] says but you did this and you did that
[1:43:41] say but I was in him before the
[1:43:43] foundation of the world and look at the
[1:43:45] Devil and say you can't get away from
[1:43:47] that and you're not going to pull me
[1:43:48] away from that I'm a Believer in the
[1:43:51] word of this hour and that proves where
[1:43:54] I
[1:43:57] started that's what Jesus said all that
[1:44:00] hear my voice have been taught have been
[1:44:03] taught of my father have been taught of
[1:44:06] God Mark
[1:44:08] 6 so this is where the reality of it
[1:44:11] comes down
[1:44:13] to so now when we look at Faith being
[1:44:17] the substance now we come back full
[1:44:18] circle and I'm going to take my last
[1:44:20] eight minutes you good amen more to say
[1:44:23] but I'm just going to stop right here
[1:44:25] because this is this is
[1:44:27] heavy so my substance was not hid from
[1:44:33] thee I'm I'm sorry now Faith is the
[1:44:36] substance of things hoped for all right
[1:44:40] the the evidence catch it now Faith is
[1:44:43] the substance of things hoped for the
[1:44:46] evidence of Things Not Seen for by it
[1:44:48] the elders obtained a good report
[1:44:51] through faith we understand understand
[1:44:53] that the worlds were formed by the word
[1:44:56] of God so that things which are seen
[1:45:00] were not made of things which do appear
[1:45:05] so I'm I'm not can I say it like this
[1:45:08] before we go off the air
[1:45:11] today thank God that in Christ I don't
[1:45:15] get graded on things that
[1:45:18] [Music]
[1:45:20] appear because if that's true I'm
[1:45:22] finished that's right you might not see
[1:45:25] it but when I when I stand in the mirror
[1:45:27] I see it when I look in this mirror I
[1:45:29] really see it and you do too come on you
[1:45:34] do too not one of us are worthy of this
[1:45:36] friends not one of us earned it not one
[1:45:39] of us deserved it and you couldn't
[1:45:40] deserve it or earn it but we that is
[1:45:44] that is a Superfluous point the pro the
[1:45:46] the fact of the matter is I was in
[1:45:49] Christ before the foundation of the
[1:45:51] world and that's why I'm a Believer I've
[1:45:55] already operated perfect faith when I
[1:45:58] accepted the word of God for this hour
[1:46:01] and receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:46:03] Ghost why would I not go in the
[1:46:06] Rapture I've already op I don't never
[1:46:09] get to perfect Faith you already are
[1:46:11] perfect Faith you already are
[1:46:14] functioning in perfect Faith by saying
[1:46:17] Amen to every word and even the parts in
[1:46:19] your life come on let's be honest even
[1:46:22] the parts in our life where we're
[1:46:23] ashamed of we w't want anybody to know
[1:46:25] but I'm here to tell you God says listen
[1:46:27] child all I need you to do is get closer
[1:46:30] to me get closer to me uh Turn Your Eyes
[1:46:33] Upon Jesus look away from the
[1:46:36] world you can't do this God is the one
[1:46:40] who will do
[1:46:41] it all you can do is live a life like
[1:46:44] Christ did and do always that and
[1:46:48] surrender Christ surrendered you know
[1:46:50] what he's start you know the first thing
[1:46:52] he surrendered was he laid aside his
[1:46:55] crown he laid aside his royalty he laid
[1:46:58] aside his robe and Paul said he this was
[1:47:01] a being who had no problem saying I'm
[1:47:05] God I'm equal to God same thing and yet
[1:47:09] he took upon himself the form of a man
[1:47:14] and became sin for the whole
[1:47:17] world if he was quite confident that he
[1:47:20] could get himself out I promise you
[1:47:23] he's quite more than confident he can
[1:47:25] get me out and he can get you out aren't
[1:47:28] you glad for that today let's stand to
[1:47:31] our feet friends I'm so glad for that
[1:47:34] today I'm so glad that he already knows
[1:47:37] As we sing the song He Knows My Name
[1:47:39] amen he knows my every thought he sees
[1:47:43] each tear I each tear that falls and
[1:47:45] hears me when I call amen we should
[1:47:48] probably sing that brother Kenny he
[1:47:50] knows my name amen oh oh my goodness I I
[1:47:55] I'm I got to stop CU if I take the next
[1:48:00] step really wow great minds think likee
[1:48:04] it'd already sent that to the booth
[1:48:05] praise the Lord amen he knows my name
[1:48:08] are you glad for that
[1:48:09] friends now listen I want you to
[1:48:13] absorb
[1:48:17] that Satan I today I have given you not
[1:48:21] everything there's still a lot more
[1:48:23] there's other levels I want to
[1:48:25] reach but now I've got your mind
[1:48:27] thinking Next Level now you're realizing
[1:48:30] wait a minute hold
[1:48:32] on this is this is actually a little
[1:48:35] bigger than just me coming to church and
[1:48:37] praying more am the the stakes are way
[1:48:41] higher than that the consequences the
[1:48:42] blessing is way more than that we're not
[1:48:45] just talking about you lining up your
[1:48:48] life to a set of rules and Rags this is
[1:48:50] about you understanding that you are a
[1:48:52] part of the Eternal framework of God's
[1:48:55] mind and that he actually saw you here
[1:48:58] and here you are and you're a part of
[1:49:00] his eternal thought and therefore God is
[1:49:02] looking to you to manifest his Eternal
[1:49:07] Word not a man-made word not a
[1:49:10] denominational word that could never
[1:49:13] reproduce The Life of Christ the Jews
[1:49:15] tried that Jesus pleaded with them
[1:49:18] you'll never do it that way all you are
[1:49:20] at the end of the day is you're a grave
[1:49:22] that men walk over and they don't even
[1:49:24] realize you're full of dead men's bones
[1:49:26] you're just a a seler and people walk
[1:49:29] over walk right in here thinking they're
[1:49:31] gaining eternal life and their worship
[1:49:33] is
[1:49:35] vain but there is a
[1:49:37] fountain that has been opened there is a
[1:49:40] the mind of God has been released
[1:49:42] because God released his mind in this
[1:49:45] day because it was going to take more
[1:49:47] than man-made religion to get us out of
[1:49:49] here it it's just too dark it's too evil
[1:49:52] it's too Wicked it's too deceptive You'
[1:49:54] never be able to figure your way through
[1:49:57] all the mindfield of of what we know as
[1:50:00] Leo deia no way you'd never be able to
[1:50:04] accomplish it you'd never be able to
[1:50:06] find your way home had God not come in
[1:50:10] this hour and brought to us a revelation
[1:50:12] you'd never see it you'd never be able
[1:50:13] to find it this can't be something that
[1:50:16] is just students comparing verse with
[1:50:18] verse Prophet said it's going to take
[1:50:20] someone a messenger with prophetic
[1:50:23] Insight it can't just be students
[1:50:25] comparing verse with verse we've had
[1:50:27] that for 20 centuries see you love him I
[1:50:32] love him friends let's bow our heads
[1:50:33] before we have brother Kenny sing all
[1:50:35] over the building bow your
[1:50:38] head Lord I commit what was said to you

[1:50:45] said to these

[1:50:50] in my heart and trying
[1:50:53] to as best I can explain it in a way
[1:50:56] that it draws a
[1:50:58] picture Lord that is a that it's a word
[1:51:00] picture that people can see what it
[1:51:02] actually is and not only what it
[1:51:04] actually is but see the role in it and
[1:51:07] how to interact and how it works and
[1:51:09] what it's all about we see who we are
[1:51:13] what we are we see why we're here we see
[1:51:16] what we're to be doing but Lord all of
[1:51:19] that aside it's going to take courage

[1:51:27] teenagers to be willing to say I will
[1:51:30] take the way with the Lord's despised

[1:54:54] me I
[1:54:57] call you know I love the
[1:55:00] meaning of Jehovah
[1:55:03] Gyra and when Abraham had really no way
[1:55:08] to even fulfill the command of God he
[1:55:12] had to lean on Jehovah
[1:55:14] Gyra he he had been given a commission
[1:55:17] like you he had been told what to do and
[1:55:20] what to accomplish the problem was he he
[1:55:24] had the wood he had the fire but the
[1:55:27] sacrifice this is an
[1:55:29] issue this this ought not to be
[1:55:32] happening there's got to be a better
[1:55:33] solution but in obedience he just kept
[1:55:36] walking he just kept walking and when
[1:55:38] Isaac questioned him he said Son Jehovah
[1:55:41] Gyra the Lord will provide do you
[1:55:44] believe that friends we're walking away
[1:55:46] we're walking in a way that seems
[1:55:48] sometimes impossible we know the
[1:55:50] commission we know we're headed to a
[1:55:51] body change we know that it is our
[1:55:54] relationship with Christ in the Capstone
[1:55:56] that literally brings the dead out of
[1:55:59] the Grave for hundreds of years it seems
[1:56:02] impossible
[1:56:03] amen sometimes If we're honest although
[1:56:06] we might not want to admit it I'll admit
[1:56:08] it on your behalf sometimes you go from
[1:56:10] day to day and wonder how will you ever
[1:56:12] get to that position yeah you do oh yeah
[1:56:15] you do yeah you do you know how I know
[1:56:17] you do cuz I
[1:56:19] do amen amen but I know this he's
[1:56:22] Jehovah Gyra and you say yes that's
[1:56:25] right the Lord provides well it it
[1:56:27] doesn't just mean that it does mean that
[1:56:31] provider but it means when you when you
[1:56:34] take the whole definition of Gyra it
[1:56:39] means that Jehovah
[1:56:41] sees and will see to
[1:56:45] it say I don't know how I'm gonna
[1:56:48] Jehovah sees it yeah but my family
[1:56:50] Jehovah sees it all but my sickness all
[1:56:53] but this problem Jehovah sees it he'll
[1:56:56] see to it he'll see to it he knows my
[1:57:00] name he sees it you you believe that
[1:57:03] friends today can you rejoice in that
[1:57:05] today he knows my name oh he
[1:57:09] knows my name Follow Me Now
[1:57:15] oh oh he
